    "the uniform electron gas ( ueg ) ( i.e. , electrons in a uniform positive background ) is inarguably one of the most fundamental systems in condensed matter physics and quantum chemistry@xcite .",
    "most notably , the availability of accurate quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) data for its ground state properties@xcite has been pivotal for the success of kohn - sham density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite .    over the past few years ,",
    "interest in the study of matter under extreme conditions has grown rapidly .",
    "experiments with inertial confinement fusion targets @xcite and laser - excited solids @xcite , but also astrophysical applications such as planet cores and white dwarf atmospheres @xcite , require a fundamental understanding of the warm dense matter ( wdm ) regime , a problem now at the forefront of plasma physics and materials science . in this peculiar state of matter , both the dimensionless wigner - seitz radius @xmath2 ( with the mean interparticle distance @xmath3 and bohr radius @xmath4 ) and the reduced temperature @xmath5 ( @xmath6 being the fermi energy ) are of order unity , implying a complicated interplay of quantum degeneracy , coupling effects , and thermal excitations . because of the importance of thermal excitation , the usual ground - state version of dft does not provide an appropriate description of wdm .",
    "an explicitly thermodynamic generalization of dft@xcite has long been known in principle , but requires an accurate parametrization of the exchange - correlation free energy ( @xmath7 ) of the ueg over the entire warm dense regime as an input@xcite .",
    "this seemingly manageable task turns out to be a major obstacle .",
    "the absence of a small parameter prevents a low - temperature or perturbation expansion and , consequently , green function techniques in the montroll - ward and @xmath8 approximations@xcite break down . further , linear response theory within the random phase approximation@xcite ( rpa ) and also with the additional inclusion of static local field corrections as suggested by , e.g. , singwi , tosi , land , and sjlander@xcite ( stls ) and vashista and singwi@xcite ( vs ) , are not reliable .",
    "quantum classical mappings@xcite are exact in some known limiting cases , but constitute an uncontrolled approximation in the wdm regime .",
    "the difficulty of constructing a quantitatively accurate theory of wdm leaves thermodynamic qmc simulations as the only available tool to accomplish the task at hand .",
    "however , the widely used path integral monte carlo@xcite ( pimc ) approach is severely hampered by the notorious fermion sign problem@xcite ( fsp ) , which limits simulations to high temperatures and low densities and precludes applications to the warm dense regime . in their pioneering work ,",
    "brown _ _ et al.__@xcite circumvented the fsp by using the fixed - node approximation@xcite ( an approach hereafter referred to as restricted pimc , rpimc ) , which allowed them to present the first comprehensive results for the ueg over a wide temperature range for @xmath9 .",
    "although these data have subsequently been used to construct the parametrization of @xmath7 required for thermodynamic dft ( see refs .  ) , their quality has been called into question .",
    "firstly , rpimc constitutes an uncontrolled approximation@xcite , which means that the accuracy of the results for the finite model system studied by brown _ _ et al.__@xcite was unclear .",
    "this unsatisfactory situation has sparked remarkable recent progress in the field of fermionic qmc@xcite .",
    "in particular , a combination of two complementary qmc approaches@xcite has recently been used to simulate the warm dense ueg without nodal restrictions@xcite , revealing that the nodal contraints in rpimc cause errors exceeding @xmath10 .",
    "secondly , brown _ _ et al.__@xcite extrapolated their qmc results for @xmath11 spin - polarized ( @xmath12 unpolarized ) electrons to the macroscopic limit by applying a finite-@xmath13 generalization of the simple first - order finite - size correction ( fsc ) introduced by chiesa _ _ et al.__@xcite for the ground state .",
    "as we have recently shown@xcite , this is only appropriate for low temperature and strong coupling and , thus , introduces a second source of systematic error .    in this paper ,",
    "we give a concise overview of the current state of the art of quantum monte carlo simulations of the warm dense electron gas and present new results regarding the extrapolation to the thermodynamic limit .",
    "further , we discuss the remaining open questions and challenges in the field .    after a brief introduction to the ueg model ( [ sec : ms ] )",
    "we introduce various qmc techniques , starting with the standard path integral monte carlo approach ( [ sub : pimc ] ) and a discussion of the origin of the fsp ( [ sub : sign_problem ] ) .",
    "the sign problem can be alleviated using either the permutation blocking pimc ( pb - pimc , [ sub : pbpimc ] ) method , or the configuration pimc algorithm ( cpimc , [ sub : cpimc ] ) , or the density matrix qmc ( dmqmc , [ sub : dmqmc ] ) approach . in combination , these tools make it possible to obtain accurate results for a finite model system over almost the entire warm dense regime ( [ sec : finite ] ) .",
    "the second key issue is the extrapolation from the finite to the infinite system , i.e. , the development of an appropriate finite - size correction@xcite , which is discussed in detail in sec .",
    "[ sec : finite_size ] . finally , we compare our qmc results for the infinite ueg to other data ( [ ss_compare ] ) and finish with some concluding remarks and a summary of open questions .",
    "following refs .  , we express the hamiltonian ( using hartree atomic units ) for @xmath14 unpolarized electrons in coordinate space as @xmath15 with the well - known madelung constant @xmath16 and the periodic ewald pair interaction @xmath17 here @xmath18 and @xmath19 denote the real and reciprocal space lattice vectors , respectively , with @xmath20 and @xmath21 three - component vectors of integers , @xmath22 the box length , @xmath23 the box volume , and @xmath24 the usual ewald parameter .      in second quantized notation using a basis of spin - orbitals of plane waves , @xmath25 , with @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , the hamiltonian , eq .",

    "let us consider @xmath35 spinless distinguishable particles in the canonical ensemble , with the volume @xmath36 , the inverse temperature @xmath37 , and the density @xmath38 being fixed .",
    "the partition function in coordinate representation is given by @xmath39 where @xmath40 contains all @xmath41 particle coordinates , and the hamiltonian @xmath42 is given by the sum of a kinetic and a potential part , respectively .",
    "since the low - temperature matrix elements of the density operator , @xmath43 , are not readily known , we exploit the group property @xmath44 , with @xmath45 and positive integers @xmath46 .",

    "this recasting is advantageous as the high temperature matrix elements can easily be approximated , most simply with the primitive approximation , @xmath51 , which becomes exact for @xmath52 . in a nutshell , the basic idea of the path integral monte carlo method",
    "@xcite is to map the quantum system onto a classical ensemble of ring polymers @xcite .",
    "the resulting high dimensional integral is evaluated using the metropolis algorithm @xcite , which allows one to sample the @xmath53-dimensional configurations @xmath54 of the ring polymer according to the corresponding configuration weight @xmath55 .",
    "to simulate @xmath35 spin - polarized fermions , the partition function from the previous section has to be extended to include a sum over all @xmath56 permutations of particles : @xmath57 where @xmath58 denotes the exchange operator corresponding to the element @xmath59 from the permutation group @xmath60 .",
    "evidently , eq .  ( [ fermi_z ] ) constitutes a sum over both positive and negative terms , so tht the configuration weight function @xmath55 can no longer be interpreted as a probability distribution .",
    "to allow fermionic expectation values to be computed using the metropolis monte carlo method , we introduce the modified partition function @xmath61 and compute fermionic observables as @xmath62 with averages taken over the modified probability distribution @xmath63 and @xmath64 denoting the sign .",
    "the average sign , i.e. , the denominator in eq .",
    "( [ eq : average ] ) , is a measure for the cancellation of positive and negative contributions and exponentially decreases with inverse temperature and system size , @xmath65 , with @xmath66 and @xmath67 being the free energy per particle of the original and the modified system , respectively .",
    "the statistical error of the monte carlo average value @xmath68 is inversely proportional to @xmath69 , @xmath70 the exponential increase of the statistical error with @xmath71 and @xmath35 evident in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fsp ] ) can only be compensated by increasing the number of monte carlo samples , but the slow @xmath72 convergence soon makes this approach unfeasible .",
    "this is the notorious fermion sign problem @xcite , which renders standard pimc unfeasible even for the simulation of small systems at moderate temperature .      to alleviate the difficulties associated with the fsp , dornheim _ _ et al.__@xcite recently introduced a novel simulation scheme that significantly extends fermionic pimc simulations towards lower temperature and higher density",
    "this so - called permutation blocking pimc ( pb - pimc ) approach combines : ( i ) the use of antisymmetrized density matrix elements , i.e. , determinants @xcite ; ( ii ) a fourth - order factorization scheme to obtain accurate approximate density matrices for relatively low temperatures ( large imaginary - time steps ) @xcite ; and ( iii ) an efficient metropolis monte carlo sampling scheme based on the temporary construction of artificial trajectories @xcite .",
    "in particular , we use the factorization introduced in refs .",
    "@xmath73 where the @xmath74 operators denote a modified potential term , which combines the usual potential energy @xmath75 with double commutator terms of the form @xmath76,\\hat{v } ] = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{m } \\sum_{i=1}^n |\\mathbf{f}_i|^2 \\quad , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and , thus , requires the evaluation of all forces in the system .",
    "furthermore , for each high - temperature factor , there appear three imaginary time steps .",
    "the final result for the partition function is given by @xmath77 where the determinants incorporate the three diffusion matrices for each of the @xmath46 factors@xcite , @xmath78    the key problem of fermionic pimc simulations is the sum over permutations , where each configuration can have a positive or a negative sign . by introducing determinants , we analytically combine both positive and negative contributions into a single configuration weight ( hence the label permutation blocking ) .",
    "therefore , parts of the cancellation are carried out beforehand and the average sign of our simulations [ eq .",
    "( [ eq : average ] ) ] is significantly increased .",
    "since this effect diminishes with increasing @xmath46 , we employ the fourth - order factorization , eq .",

    "nevertheless , the value of @xmath80 remains significantly larger than zero , which means that , for the three depicted temperatures , pb - pimc simulations are possible over the entire density range . in contrast , the green curve shows the density - dependent average sign for standard pimc simulations@xcite at @xmath82 and exhibits a significantly steeper decrease with density , limiting simulations to @xmath83 .      for cpimc@xcite , instead of performing the trace over the density operator in the coordinate representation",

    ", title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=44.0% ]    to conclude this section , we use our finite - size corrected qmc data for the unpolarized ueg to analyze the accuracy of various other methods that are commonly used . in fig .",
    "[ fig : isotherm_theta2 ] a ) , the potential energy per particle , @xmath149 , is shown as a function of @xmath81 for the isotherm with @xmath143 .",
    "although all four depicted curves exhibit qualitatively similar behavior , there are significant deviations between them [ see panel b ) , where we show the relative deviations from a fit to the qmc data in the tdl ] .",
    "let us start with the qmc results : the black squares correspond to the uncorrected raw qmc data for @xmath12 particles ( see ref .  ) and the red diamonds to the finite - size corrected data from ref .  .",
    "as expected , the finite - size effects drastically increase with density from @xmath157 , at @xmath158 , to @xmath159 , at @xmath151 .",
    "this again illustrates the paramount importance of accurate finite - size corrections for qmc simulations in the warm dense matter regime .",
    "the rpa calculation ( green curve ) is accurate at high density and weak coupling . however , with increasing @xmath81 the accuracy quickly deteriorates and , already at moderate coupling , @xmath144 , the systematic error is of the order of @xmath10 .",
    "the yellow asterisks show the slts result which agrees well with the simulations ( the systematic error does not exceed @xmath160 ) over the entire @xmath81-range considered , i.e. , up to @xmath158 .",
    "finally , the blue curve has been obtained from the recent parametrization of @xmath7 by karasiev _ _ et al.__@xcite ( ksdt ) , for which rpimc data have been used as an input . while there is a reasonable agreement with our new data for @xmath161 ( with @xmath162 ) , there are significant deviations at smaller @xmath81 , which only vanish for @xmath163 .",
    "let us summarize the status of _ ab initio _ thermodynamic data for the uniform electron gas at finite temperature .",
    "the present paper has given an overview of recent progress in _ ab initio _ finite temperature qmc simulations that avoid any additional simplifications such as fixed nodes .",
    "while these simulations do not `` solve '' the fermion sign problem , they provide a reasonable and efficient way how to _ avoid it _ , in many practically relevant situations , by combining simulations that use different representations of the quantum many - body state : the coordinate representation ( direct pimc and pb - pimc ) and fock states ( cpimc , dmqmc ) . with this",
    "it is now possible to obtain highly accurate results for up to @xmath164 particles in the entire density range and for temperatures @xmath165 . as a second step we demonstrated that these comparatively small simulation sizes are sufficient to predict results for the macroscopic uniform electron gas",
    "_ not significantly loosing accuracy _",
    "this unexpected result is a consequence of a new highly accurate finite - size correction that was derived by invoking stls results for the static structure factor .    with this procedure",
    "it is now possible to obtain thermodynamic data for the uniform electron gas with an accuracy on the order of @xmath1 . even though pure electron gas results can not be directly compared to warm dense matter experiments , they are of high value to benchmark and improve additional theoretical approaches .",
    "most importantly , this concerns finite - temperature versions of density functional theory ( such as orbital - free dft ) which is the standard tool to model realistic materials and which will benefit from our results for the exchange - correlation free energy .",
    "furthermore , we have also presented a few comparisons with earlier models such as rpa , vahista - singwi , stls or the recent fit of karasiev _ et al . _",
    "( ksdt ) the accuracy and errors of which can now be unambiguously quantified .",
    "we found that among the tested models , the stls is the most accurate one .",
    "we wish to underline that even though exchange - correlation effects are often small compared to the kinetic energy , their accurate treatment is important to capture the properties of real materials , see e.g. @xcite    in the following we summarize the open questions and outline future research directions .",
    "1 .   construction of an improved fit for the exchange - correlation free energy due to their key relevance as input for finite - temperature dft .",
    "such fits are straightforwardly generated from the current results but require a substantial extension of the simulations to arbitrary spin polarization .",
    "this work is currently in progress .",
    "the presently available accurate data are limited to temperatures above half the fermi energy , as a consequence of the fermion sign problem .",
    "a major challenge will be to advance to lower temperatures , @xmath166 and to reliably connect the results to the known ground state data .",
    "this requires substantial new developments in the area of the three quantum monte carlo methods presented in this paper ( cpimc , pb - pimc and dmqmc ) and new ideas how to combine them .",
    "another idea could be to derive simplified versions of these methods that treat the fsp more efficiently but still have acceptable accuracy .",
    "the present _ ab initio _ results allow for an entirely new view on previous theoretical models .",
    "for the first time , a clear judgement about the accuracy becomes possible which more clearly maps out the sphere of applicability of the various approaches , e.g.  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the availability of our data will allow for improvements of many of these approaches via adjustment of the relevant parameters to the qmc data .",
    "this could yield , e.g. , improved static structure factors , dielectric functions or local field correlations .",
    "4 .   similarly , our data may also help to improve alternative quantum monte carlo concepts .",
    "in particular , this concerns the nodes for restricted pimc simulations which can be tested against our data .",
    "this might help to extend the range of validity of those simulations to higher density and lower temperature . since this latter method does not have a sign problem it may allow to reach parameters that are not accessible otherwise .",
    "a major challenge of metropolois - based qmc simulations that are highly efficient for thermodynamic and static properties is to extend them to dynamic quantities .",
    "this can , in principle , be done via analytical continuation from imaginary to real times ( or frequencies ) . however , this is known to be an ill - posed problem .",
    "recently , there has been significant progress by invoking stochastic reconstruction methods or genetic algorithms .",
    "for example , for bose systems , accurate results for the spectral function and the dynamics structure factor could be obtained , e.g.  @xcite and references therein which are encouraging also for applications to the uniform electron gas , in the near future .",
    "finally , there is a large number of additional applications of the presented _ ab initio _ simulations .",
    "this includes the 2d warm dense ueg where thermodynamic results of similar accuracy should be straightforwardly accessible .",
    "moreover , for the electron gas , at high density , @xmath167 , relativistic corrections should be taken into account . among the presented simulations ,",
    "cpimc is perfectly suited to tackle this task and to provide _ ab initio _ data also for correlated matter at extreme densities .",

    "<S> warm dense matter is one of the most active frontiers in plasma physics due to its relevance for dense astrophysical objects as well as for novel laboratory experiments in which matter is being strongly compressed e.g. by high - power lasers . </S>",
    "<S> its description is theoretically very challenging as it contains correlated quantum electrons at finite temperature  a system that can not be accurately modeled by standard analytical or ground state approaches . </S>",
    "<S> recently several breakthroughs have been achieved in the field of fermionic quantum monte carlo simulations . </S>",
