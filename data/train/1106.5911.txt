    "the quantum mechanics of open systems , i.e. systems interacting with an external environment , is currently the focus of widespread attention@xcite .",
    "of particular recent interest is the issue of the extent to which quantum coherence of the system is maintained in the presence of the environment .",
    "two significant modern examples may be noted : ( a ) the need to maintain coherence in order to implement methods for quantum mechanically controlling molecular processes@xcite , and ( b ) issues of the role of such quantum coherent processes in natural environments , such as the observed long - lived coherent electronic energy transfer ( eet ) in photosynthesis@xcite .    in either of these cases , and in many other examples as well , dynamical evolution of the open system provide a significant computational challenge . as such , a variety of approximations",
    "are often invoked to propagate the system , such as the second born approximation to master equations and the markov approximation , both of which are the focus of this paper . in particular ,",
    "in this paper we introduce a simple method to solve the second born quantum master equation without doing the markov approximation on the slowly decaying envelope of the density matrix .",
    "in addition to being straightforward , this approach allows , by comparing to results using the markov approximation , a reliable determination of the range of coupling strengths and decay rates of the bath auto - correlation function , over which one can use the markovian theory and the second order approximation .",
    "in addition , by examining the size of the fourth order term , this approach affords an estimate of the range of validity of the widely used second - order approximation for model photosynthetic systems .",
    "although the method developed here is applicable to general systems with exponential bath correlation functions , for computational simplicity we study , as do others , the dimer system , generally regarded as a simple photosynthesis eet model . in this case",
    "our markovian analysis contrasts with , for example , that in ref .",
    "@xcite in which markovian redfield theory is used apriori and its consequences analyzed , as opposed to comparison with exact results .",
    "the particular challenge arising from these eet types of systems relates to the parameter range in which the dynamics occurs .",
    "specifically , quantum dynamics can be readily analyzed in two limiting cases defined by the relative contributions of the inter- system coupling @xmath1 responsible for excitation energy transfer ( eet ) , and system - bath coupling constant @xmath2 , responsible for decoherence .",
    "these parameters define two important time scales : the excitation transfer time scale @xmath3 , and the decoherence time scale @xmath4 .",
    "if the system - bath coupling is very weak and @xmath5 , the system is almost closed and the schrdinger equation can be used to study the dynamics . in the opposite case @xmath6 ( strong system - bath coupling ) , the system is open , the decoherence rate is very fast , the dynamics is almost incoherent and a simple pauli type master equation description suffices .",
    "these limiting regimes are well understood .",
    "many real systems , such as a number of harvesting systems @xcite , however , fall between these extremes .",
    "recent observations @xcite of the long - lived eet has reactivated interest in these systems .",
    "the standard approach used to treat this intermediate regime is to use the second born quantum master equation @xcite , a perturbative master equation up to second order in system - bath interaction with weak system - bath coupling , plus its markovian approximation ( e.g. , as in the redfield master equation ) .",
    "recently , two approaches have been studied for arbitrary coupling regimes .",
    "one is based on weakening the system - bath coupling removal of system - bath interaction and repartitioning the hamiltonian term using a polaron transformation , followed by the standard second born master equation @xcite .",
    "the second approach is based on a reduced hierarchy equation of kubo and tanimura , starting from the path integral approach for quantum dissipative systems @xcite .",
    "additional methods are also being developed by the community . here ,",
    "as noted above , we introduce and utilize a particularly direct approach .    in the following section ( section ii ) we outline the basic model for a dimer . in section",
    "iii we introduce the second born quantum master equation and phonon correlation function , diagonalize the hamiltonian and cast the master equation into both the site and energy representations .",
    "section iv gives a new auxiliary function method of solving these equations , and provides an analysis of results in the markovian approximation .",
    "discussion of the results and the underlying physical picture is given at the end of section v. in section vi we discuss the regime of validity of the second order approximation in the master equation by estimating the order of magnitude of the fourth order term .",
    "the vast majority of treatments in the literature utilize coherence - free initial conditions and study the subsequent dynamics .",
    "results for these initial conditions are compared to that obtained with model excitation with weak light in section vii .",
    "the last section provides a brief conclusion .",
    "consider a model dimer system given by the following standard frenkel exciton hamiltonian @xcite :    @xmath7    here @xmath8 represents the state in which only the @xmath9 site is excited and all others are in the ground state .",
    "the quantity @xmath10 is the excited electronic energy of the @xmath9 site in the absence of phonons , and @xmath11 is the electronic coupling between the sites which is responsible for eet .",
    "the ground state energies of the donor and acceptor are set equal to zero and @xmath12 is the reorganization energy of the @xmath13 site that is dissipated in the bath after the electronic transition occurs .",
    "the quantity @xmath14 is the dimensionless displacement of the equilibrium configuration of the @xmath15 phonon mode between the ground and the excited electronic state of the @xmath13 site , and @xmath16 are the dimensionless coordinates and momenta of the @xmath15 phonon mode of frequency @xmath17 .",
    "the method of projection operators used to obtain open system master equations is well known @xcite . with the help of projection operators one can obtain the following quantum master equation for the reduced density matrix of the system in the second born approximation , which is valid when system - bath coupling is weak as compared to the characteristic energy scale of the system [ see , e.g. , ref .",

    "the markov approximation can be performed when the time scale on which the envelope of the density matrix decays is much longer than the decay time of the phonon correlation function @xcite .",
    "then one can introduce the following approximation : @xmath59    as discussed in ref .",
