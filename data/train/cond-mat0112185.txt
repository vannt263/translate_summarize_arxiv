    "the equations defining the frequencies of single particle excitations from a weakly - interacting dilute bose gas at zero temperature were introduced by bogoliubov @xcite and applied to low - temperature fermi systems by de gennes @xcite .",
    "the underlying assumption is that temperatures are sufficiently low such that the condensate is not significantly depleted and that the interparticle interactions are weak and the gas dilute . under such constraints the dynamics",
    "are dominated by single particle excitations meaning that semiclassical approximations can be used for the field excitations and the equations are equivalent to linear response theory @xcite .",
    "trapped hydrostatic ultracold gas clouds can be modeled to a high degree of precision under these conditions . even within this framework",
    "the equations must be solved numerically because of the inhomogeneity and nonlinearity of the condensate .",
    "determining the elementary excitations is much more complex in situations in which the condensate is flowing or permeated with defects such as vortex arrays .",
    "the extraordinary coldness of the atom cloud means the condensate dynamics occur on millisecond time scales and thus are accessible to measurement as they evolve .",
    "shape distortions , created by manipulating the condensate with external electromagnetic fields , can be used to measure mode frequencies @xcite , wave - mixing @xcite and damping rates @xcite . in this way elementary excitation frequencies at low temperatures can be measured to an accuracy within a few percent , and the agreement with theory for the low - lying modes is astonishingly good @xcite .",
    "precise measurements closer to the critical temperature are much more uncertain , and indeed theoretical modeling is also challenged by the influence of complex pair excitations @xcite .",
    "the agreement between theory and experiment is much less satisfactory in this region .",
    "the experimental and theoretical study of condensates in the time domain mirrors experimental breakthroughs in ultrashort laser pulses used to probe ultrafast processes in chemistry and biology .",
    "dynamic simulations and experiments applied to bose condensates have provided insight into the transition from superfluid flow to dissipation and drag @xcite and in condensate formation and destruction .",
    "trapped condensates are particularly suited to spectral methods , specifically the split - operator technique @xcite combined with the fft method @xcite .",
    "we report results in which efficient parallel computing techniques have been implemented within the spectral method to determine the elementary excitation frequencies and densities .",
    "the method is ideally suited to the analysis of elementary excitations in complex flows and in the presence of defects .",
    "the method also allows the excitation mechanism of experiments to be modeled realistically and thus help devise schemes which produce optimal excitation of certain modes or superposition of modes leading to squeezed and entangled states @xcite , and observe collective excitations of quadrupoles giving evidence of superfluid motion @xcite .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in section  [ sec : qft ] the units and notation are described , and the field equations are introduced . the case of excitation in the presence of condensate circulation",
    "is discussed .",
    "the equations describing excitations in a cylindrically symmetric trap and quadrupole excitations in an asymmetric trap are given . in section  [ sec : tdlr ] the time - dependent method is formulated .",
    "finally , in sections  [ sec : res ] and  [ sec : conc ] , results are compared betwen the two methods and some general conclusions are given on the relative merits of each method .",
    "[ sec : level1 ]    .values of the chemical potential ( @xmath0 ) of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 states for the isotropic 2d trap as a function of interaction strength , @xmath3 , in units of @xmath4 [ cols= \" > , > , > , > \" , ]",
    "in this article we compare the time - dependent ( tdlr ) and time - independent methods ( dvr ) for excitation in 2d traps . for the dvr calculations we used @xmath5 and @xmath6 radial mesh points with a scaling factor @xmath7 .",
    "the results presented , using @xmath6 , are converged to at least 6 decimal places . for reference ,",
    "the values of the chemical potential are presented in table [ chempot ] .",
    "the tdlr calculations were performed on grids of @xmath8 points .",
    "convergence and accuracy can be calibrated by comparison with exact results .",
    "for example , the 2d dipole ( @xmath9 ) mode is a feature of the trap and independent of the particle interactions ( @xmath3 ) and circulation @xmath10 , so that @xmath11 .",
    "the dvr results for this mode are accurate to at least six decimal places , while the tdlr results are within 0.3% of the exact values over the range @xmath12 .",
    "table [ qr1qt0 ] shows the results for the lowest breathing mode ( @xmath13 ) for @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "again , in 2d this mode is not sensitive to particle interactions .",
    "tdlr results are stable and consistent for this mode as @xmath3 increases , slightly underestimating the frequency in the fourth significant figure .",
    "the loss of precision in the tdlr results for high @xmath3 is of the same order as the errors in the chemical potential results .",
    "the quadrupole modes are more sensitive to changes in @xmath3 and also to the condensate circulation . in figure",
    "[ fig : xylz0 ] the correlation @xmath14 is shown for @xmath15 .",
    "the smooth sinusoidal curve translates to the fourier transform spectral density shown as the dashed line in figure [ fig : pow_c1000 ] .",
    "the spectral density shows a noise - free profile with a well - defined peak at the value @xmath16 . as @xmath17 , @xmath18 . in table",
    "[ quad1 ] results are presented for the mode : @xmath19 .",
    "the agreement between the time - dependent and time independent results is extremely good over the entire range of @xmath3 . given that the dipole mode showed the tdlr accuracy is within four figures , the accord to five figures for @xmath20 and @xmath21 is fortuitous .",
    "when condensate circulation is present the quadrupole circulation can flow with or against the background and the @xmath22 modes split .",
    "this is evident in the beats arising in the @xmath14 correlation figure [ fig : xylz1 ] and the corresponding spectrum ( figure [ fig : pow_c1000 ] ) .",
    "the agreement with dvr results , indicated in table [ quadcomplz1 m ] is excellent .",
    "since the tdlr method is based upon a cartesian grid , it is readily used for arbitrary geometries of the trap .",
    "for example , the quadrupole modes @xmath23 of an asymmetric 3d ellipsoidal trap can found in the same way . in this case",
    "we used a mixed perturbation of all three symmetries and then frequency analyzed the correlations of each moment .",
    "the results are presented in table [ asymm ] .",
    "the data tends to the correct high @xmath3 limit uniformly and accurately .",
    "we have compared methods for calculation of the excitation frequencies of a condensate at zero temperature .",
    "the method based on linear response theory is extremely efficient and successful at producing accurate results and can be tailored to the experimental methods used to create the excitations of interest .",
    "the method is straightforward to implement , yields reliable results , and can be computed cheaply and efficiently .",
    "the versatility of the method extends to complex trap geometries and condensate topologies .",
    "thus it is suitable for the study of excitations and sound propagation in traps where the condensate contains soliton and vortex structures @xcite .",
    "we are very grateful for the support of bergen computational physics laboratory in the framework of the european community - access to research infrastructure action of the improving human potential programme .",
