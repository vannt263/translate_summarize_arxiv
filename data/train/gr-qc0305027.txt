    "the propagation of classical scalar fields in a fixed black hole spacetime has been studied extensively ever since the work of price  @xcite that described the behavior of such fields in the schwarzschild geometry .",
    "higher - spin fields , such as linearized gravitational perturbations , behave qualitatively similar to the zero - spin case , and therefore scalar fields are often used to gain insight into more general situations .",
    "although the behavior of scalar fields in schwarzschild spacetime is well - understood , the situation for a kerr background geometry is still under active investigation and has been a topic of some controversy ( see , _",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the evolution of a scalar field in curved spacetime is governed by the massless klein - gordon equation @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the value of the scalar field and @xmath7 is the dalembertian operator in curved spacetime . according to no - hair theorems , the only nonsingular time - independent solution to eq .",
    "( [ wave ] ) in a black hole background is @xmath8 everywhere , and furthermore , if @xmath6 initially varies in time or space it will evolve until it reaches this time - independent solution  @xcite . when observed at a fixed spatial location as a function of time ,",
    "the evolution of a scalar field in a black hole spacetime consists of three distinct phases , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : example ] .",
    "the first stage is the initial burst , which is determined by the initial conditions imposed on the scalar field .",
    "the second stage is the quasinormal ringing phase , during which outgoing waves interfere with incoming waves that backscatter off the black hole s potential well . during this phase @xmath6 oscillates and",
    "decays exponentially , and can be written as a sum of terms of the form @xmath9 for a discrete set of complex eigenfrequencies @xmath10 . during the third stage , or tail phase ,",
    "@xmath6 depends on incoming radiation that has been backscattered off the spacetime curvature at large distances . during the tail phase",
    ", the scalar field decays as a power law , @xmath11 , for the case of a schwarzschild background , and there is good analytical  @xcite and numerical  @xcite evidence that it decays as a power law for a kerr background as well .",

    "are the l2 norms of @xmath6 and @xmath12 on a spherical surface of fixed radius @xmath13 , defined by @xmath14 . here",
    "the integration is taken over a surface at @xmath15 .",
    "the duration of the initial burst is about 50@xmath16 .",
    "after the initial burst , the scalar field settles into the quasinormal ringing phase until about 200@xmath16 when the tail phase begins.,width=288 ]    for a scalar field in schwarzschild spacetime , the power - law decay in the tail phase is computed using the spherical harmonic decomposition of the initial data .",
    "the amplitude of each @xmath1 mode present in the initial data will eventually decay like @xmath17 at late times  @xcite , assuming that @xmath6 initially falls off quickly enough at infinity at large distances is initially a static solution of eq .",
    "( [ wave ] ) , then the late - time decay rate  @xcite is @xmath18 .",
    "note that all static solutions of eq .",
    "( [ wave ] ) that are regular at infinity diverge at the horizon  @xcite ] .",
    "if one measures @xmath6 at a single point in space or by some other method that does not select specific spherical harmonic components , the decay rate measured at late times will be determined by the smallest @xmath19 present in the initial data , because this is the most slowly decaying mode .",
    "the late - time behavior of the scalar field becomes more complicated in kerr spacetime because of the lack of spherical symmetry .",
    "although axisymmetry prevents mixing of spherical harmonics with different @xmath20 values , harmonics with different values of @xmath19 no longer evolve independently .",
    "because of this mode mixing , if the initial data are proportional to a pure spherical harmonic @xmath21 , the evolution should produce spherical harmonics with different values of @xmath19 , and in particular smaller values of @xmath19 .",
    "it is not unreasonable to assume the same power - law time dependence as the schwarzschild case , namely @xmath22 , because the tails are due to radiation backscattered off the weak - field asymptotic region of spacetime . given this assumption , the late - time behavior of the scalar field should be dominated by the smallest value of @xmath19 that is produced by mode mixing , since this is the most slowly decaying mode .",
    "given that @xmath23 and that parity is conserved ( i.e. the equatorial symmetry of the initial data is preserved ) , the lowest - order spherical harmonic that may be generated from initial data proportional to @xmath21 is @xmath24 if @xmath25 is even and @xmath26 if @xmath25 is odd . therefore , according to this simple picture one would expect at late times @xmath27    however , analytical work by hod  @xcite predicts different behavior for scalar fields in kerr spacetime .",
    "according to hod s analysis , the late - time decay rate does not just depend on the lowest multipole index @xmath19 permitted by parity and axisymmetry ; the initial value @xmath28 also plays a role : @xmath29 this is a deeply surprising result , for it implies that the generated modes somehow `` remember '' the properties of the initial data that created them .",
    "it has been recently argued by poisson  @xcite that _ both _ eq .  ( [ eq : hod ] ) and the simple picture leading to eq .  ( [ eq : naive ] )",
    "are valid descriptions of the late - time dependence of scalar fields in a rotating spacetime that is weakly curved everywhere ; the difference is merely the choice of spatial coordinates @xmath2 used when setting the initial data .",
    "poisson assumes a metric equal to minkowski space in spherical coordinates @xmath2 plus a stationary nonspherical perturbation which he treats to linear order . for initial data proportional to @xmath30 for some function @xmath31",
    ", he finds that the field decays like @xmath32 ( there is no mode mixing to first order in the perturbation ) .",
    "he then repeats the calculation using initial data proportional to @xmath33 , where @xmath34 are spheroidal coordinates defined by @xmath35 for some constant @xmath36 . in this case",
    "he finds that the modes mix because of the nonspherical coordinates , and the scalar field decays according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : hod ] ) .",
    "poisson then argues that since radiative falloff is essentially a weak - field phenomenon , similar conclusions should be true for scalar fields in a kerr background , so that coordinate effects would account for the discrepancy between eq .",
    "( [ eq : naive ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq : hod ] ) .",
    "consider initial data proportional to @xmath37 where @xmath2 are any coordinates in which the weak - field limit of the kerr metric is spatially isotropic .",
    "then the only mode mixing will be due to the strong - gravity region at early times , and at late times , when the scalar field probes only the weak - gravity region , each mode that was generated by the mixing will decay like @xmath38 .",
    "one therefore expects eq .",
    "( [ eq : naive ] ) to hold .",
    "now consider initial data proportional to @xmath39 where @xmath34 are any coordinates in which the weak - field limit of the kerr metric is spheroidal . such coordinates include boyer - lindquist coordinates , the coordinates used in hod s analysis , which in the weak - field limit reduce to flat space in spheroidal coordinates @xmath34 with the parameter @xmath36 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : spheroidaldef1 ] ) equal to the kerr spin parameter . for such initial data ,",
    "if strong - gravity mode mixing can be ignored relative to the mode mixing resulting from the spheroidal coordinate system ( this key assumption is discussed in more detail in section  [ sec : coordinate - effects ] ) , then the scalar field should behave according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : hod ] ) .",
    "the `` memory '' effect implied by eq .",
    "( [ eq : hod ] ) , according to this argument , is due to coordinates and not physics .",
    "surprising and seemingly contradictory results have resulted not only from analytic studies of this problem but also from numerical simulations .",
    "early simulations  @xcite considered cases for which eq .",
    "( [ eq : naive ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq : hod ] ) agree , and were consistent with both predictions , but a more recent simulation  @xcite yielded the puzzling result that a scalar field initially proportional to @xmath40 , the lowest multipole mode for which eq .",
    "( [ eq : naive ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq : hod ] ) differ , decays approximately like @xmath41 , in conflict with both predictions .",
    "most recently , a 2 + 1 simulation of an initial @xmath40 mode using ingoing kerr coordinates  @xcite agrees with eq .",
    "( [ eq : naive ] ) to high accuracy .    here",
    "we solve the scalar wave equation in a fixed kerr background in kerr - schild coordinates using a 3 + 1 numerical evolution code .",
    "we reproduce the known fundamental quasinormal frequency and the known tail falloff behavior for the schwarzschild case .",
    "we find that for a black hole with nonzero spin , when we choose initial data proportional to @xmath42 , where @xmath2 are kerr - schild coordinates , we find late - time tail behavior consistent with eq .",
    "( [ eq : naive ] ) .",
    "we then choose a different set of initial data proportional to @xmath43 , where @xmath4 are the boyer - lindquist coordinates .",
    "note that the boyer - lindquist coordinates are spheroidal in the sense discussed earlier and the kerr - schild coordinates are spherical , and that the transformation between @xmath44 and @xmath45 is the same transformation  ( [ eq : spheroidaldef1][eq : spheroidaldef2 ] ) used by poisson .",
    "for this initial data , we obtain a quite different evolution at intermediate times , with different magnitudes of lower - order spherical harmonics generated during the evolution , even though the initial data differs from the kerr - schild case by a small amount .",
    "however , at very late times it appears that the scalar field decays according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : naive ] ) .",
    "our results indicate that the coordinate effects discussed by poisson play an important role in the details of the evolution at intermediate times , but they do not affect the asymptotic decay rate , presumably because of mode mixing in the strong - field region , an effect that was not included in poisson s analysis .",
    "because kerr spacetime is axisymmetric , a 2 + 1 dimensional simulation would suffice for the present problem .",
    "we work in 3 + 1 dimensions because we have available a 3 + 1 dimensional code ( see , _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite ) which is designed to solve the full nonlinear einstein evolution equations and is being used to study the binary black hole problem .",
    "this code can be applied to not only the einstein equations , but to any first order strongly hyperbolic system of equations .",
    "for such a numerical code it is extremely useful to find test problems that are simpler than , for example , the binary black hole problem , but difficult enough so that they still provide nontrivial tests of our numerical algorithms .",
    "the simulation of late - time tails is just this type of problem . because it is linear and involves fewer dynamical fields , this problem is simpler than those involving dynamical black holes . yet",
    "our treatment of this problem contains many of the features currently thought to be desirable in a solution of the binary black hole problem : wave propagation , multiple computational domains , parallelism , black hole excision with no boundary condition imposed on the excision surface , and constraint - preserving boundary conditions on certain fields at the outer boundary .",
    "these features will be discussed further in section  [ sec : numerical - method ] .    although this problem is simpler than the evolution of dynamical black holes , it is still technically challenging in 3 + 1 dimensions because of the requirement for high resolution , long integration times , and a distant outer boundary . as discussed in section  [ sec : numerical - method ] , we overcome these difficulties by the use of multiple computational domains and a pseudospectral evolution algorithm . the latter yields",
    "exponential convergence of spatial numerical errors for smooth problems , allowing us to achieve a given level of accuracy using a small fraction of the computational resources that would be required by a unigrid finite - difference code .",
    "we write the spacetime metric in the usual 3 + 1 form @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the three - metric , @xmath48 is the lapse and @xmath49 is the shift .",

    "we apply a filter to the right - hand sides of eqs .",
    "( [ odiffeq ] ) before incorporating boundary conditions via the bjrhus algorithm .",
    "the filter consists of simply setting high - frequency spherical harmonic coefficients to zero .",

    ".      the simplest outer boundary condition is obtained by setting the time derivatives of the incoming characteristic fields @xmath124 , @xmath125 , and @xmath126 to zero .",
    "while this works well for a schwarzschild background in painlev - gullstrand coordinates , for a kerr background in kerr - schild coordinates , even for @xmath67 , this boundary condition produces strong violations of the constraint @xmath86 at the outer boundary , even at @xmath127 .",

    "therefore , although it is important that the outer boundary condition is well - behaved when there is no wave there , the magnitude and nature of the reflections produced when a wave passes through the boundary is largely irrelevant , because the evolution ends before these reflections reach the observation point .",
    "the convergence properties of a pseudospectral code is more difficult to analyze than , for instance , a second - order finite - difference code .",

    "the angular truncation error is already small , even at low resolution ( as is expected for initial data that is pure @xmath148 without higher angular components ) , so except for the difference in the two lowest resolutions one does not see any dependence on the number of angular collocation points .",

    "the purpose of maximizing the error over neighboring points is to treat the cases in which @xmath170 and @xmath171 spuriously agree at a single point  without the maximization",
    "this point would have an artificially small error estimate .",
    "the size @xmath172 of the maximization window is typically @xmath173 , where @xmath174 is the total number of discrete values of @xmath175 that we use for the fit . near the points @xmath176 and @xmath177",
    "we translate the maximization window in eq .",
    "( [ eq : errorestimate ] ) , so that , for example , for @xmath178 the window goes from @xmath179 to @xmath180 .",
    "using a linear fit to the form  ( [ pindevol ] ) we obtain @xmath181 , and using a quadratic fit we obtain @xmath182 .",
    "these agree with the accepted value to within about a percent .",
    "we perform the fits only for data in the tail region of figure  [ pgy10 ] , that is , for @xmath183 .",
    "the estimate of @xmath164 is relatively insensitive to the exact region of @xmath91 in figure  [ pgy10 ] that we choose to perform the fit .",
    "following our numerical trials with a schwarzschild background , we turned our attention to scalar fields around rotating black holes . for our background spacetime",
    "we used a kerr geometry with spin @xmath184 .",
    "figure  [ kerrring ] displays the evolution of the scalar field on this kerr background for three different choices of initial data .",
    "the initial data are taken to have the form  ( [ initial ] ) , where now @xmath2 are related to the kerr - schild coordinates @xmath185 defined in section  [ sec : background - spacetime ] in the usual way @xmath186 the top , middle , and bottom plots in the figure show the decay of a scalar field initially proportional to @xmath187 , @xmath137 , and @xmath40 , respectively .",
    "since the latter two cases have the same initial value of @xmath151 and are of even parity , we expect that a @xmath187 mode will be generated during these evolutions .",
    "thus , according to the simple mode - mixing picture discussed above , all three evolutions in figure  [ kerrring ] should follow the same power - law decay at late times .",
    "figure  [ kerrring ] supports this prediction : although the quasinormal ringing phases are dissimilar , the slope of the tails do appear to match .    the evolution of the power index for these cases is shown in figure  [ kerrpow ] .",
    "the power indices approach a value of three , which corresponds to the price decay rate formula @xmath188 for an @xmath189 mode .",
    "estimates of @xmath164 obtained by least - squares fits to the numerical data can be found in table  [ table ] .",
    "these estimates all fall within a few percent of the value @xmath190 .",
    "the tails have a much smaller magnitude for evolutions with larger initial values @xmath28 .",
    "for example , for @xmath191 , the scalar field approaches a magnitude of @xmath192 at late times , and its time derivative is two orders of magnitude smaller .",
    "thus we are forced to use larger number of spectral coefficients to resolve the large @xmath28 cases . however , because the accuracy of pseudospectral methods increases exponentially with the number of collocation points , increasing the number of coefficients only by roughly a factor of two in each dimension was sufficient to resolve even the @xmath191 case .",
    "note that the @xmath191 case shown in figures  [ kerrring ] and  [ kerrpow ] is the smallest value of @xmath28 for which the two analytical predictions , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : naive ] ) and  ( [ eq : hod ] ) , disagree .",
    "our results support the simple picture leading to  ( [ eq : naive ] ) , which yields a @xmath193 falloff for this case , rather than eq .",
    "( [ eq : hod ] ) , which predicts a @xmath194 falloff .    .numerically - determined power - law decay rates . shown",
    "are the spherical harmonic indices of the initial data , the @xmath44 coordinates used in the initial data function @xmath195 in eq .",
    "( [ initial ] ) ( painlev - gullstrand , kerr - schild , or boyer - lindquist ) , the spin of the hole , and the best - fit power index at late times . [ cols=\"^,^,>,^,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     table  [ table ] summarizes various cases that we have studied numerically .",
    "in addition to the @xmath151 cases discussed above , we have also computed power - law decay rates for @xmath196 and @xmath197 . these cases allow us to test the predictions of eq .",
    "( [ eq : naive ] ) and eq .  ( [ eq : hod ] ) more thoroughly .",
    "for example , initial data proportional to @xmath198 is forbidden to evolve by mode - mixing into any lower @xmath1 mode ( @xmath189 is forbidden by @xmath20 conservation and @xmath159 is forbidden by parity ) .",
    "therefore , the @xmath165 law predicts a tail decay rate of @xmath199 , which is what we observe .",
    "it has been argued  @xcite for a rotating weakly - curved spacetime that the difference between the predictions of eq .",
    "( [ eq : naive ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq : hod ] ) is related to the choice of coordinates , and in particular , that eq .",
    "( [ eq : hod ] ) is correct if the initial data were proportional to a spherical harmonic in spheroidal coordinates . to test",
    "whether this might be true for kerr , we repeated the evolution of initial data proportional to @xmath40 , but with a small coordinate change : we still take initial data of the form  ( [ initial ] ) , but we choose @xmath200 where @xmath201 is the boyer - lindquist coordinate defined by @xmath202 . because @xmath203 and @xmath204 , this initial data differs slightly from the form  ( [ initial ] ) .",
    "in fact , the magnitude of this difference is only about one part in a thousand .    for brevity , here and in the following we will refer to the evolution of initial data  ( [ eq : initialdatabl ] ) as the `` bl '' case , and we will refer to the @xmath191 evolution shown in figure  [ kerrring ] as the `` ks '' case ,",
    "since the two evolutions differ only in which radial and polar coordinate ( boyer - lindquist or kerr - schild ) are used in the expression  ( [ initial ] ) for the initial data .",
    "note that the kerr background is expressed in the same coordinate system for both the bl and the ks evolutions , and is given by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : ksg][eq : ksk ] ) . note",
    "also that the transformation between the bl and ks radial and polar coordinates is exactly the transformation  ( [ eq : spheroidaldef1][eq : spheroidaldef2 ] ) studied in  @xcite .    )",

    "shown are the absolute values of selected kerr - schild spectral coefficients of @xmath6 for both cases .",
    "for both cases the resolution is 30/29 .",
    "the initial data for the ks and bl differ by only @xmath207 , yet the details of the evolutions are quite different.,width=288 ]      if the argument of  @xcite applies to the kerr geometry , then for the bl case , the power law falloff rate should be @xmath194 , in agreement with eq .",
    "( [ eq : hod ] ) , rather than @xmath193 , which is predicted by eq .",
    "( [ eq : naive ] ) .",
    "it is quite difficult in the bl case to obtain an accurate value for the late - time power index @xmath164 by the method used in sections  [ sec : schwarzschild ] and  [ sec : kerr - background ] .",
    "this is because even though the initial data  ( [ eq : initialdatabl ] ) differs only slightly from that used in the ks case , the evolution proceeds quite differently : the resulting late - time tail is a few orders of magnitude smaller than for the ks case , and by the time the solution displays its late - time asymptotic behavior , the scalar field time derivative is so small ( @xmath208 ) that machine roundoff error ( not numerical truncation error ) obscures the results .",
    "fortunately , this roundoff error turns out to be largest at high angular frequencies , so it is still possible to determine the late - time behavior of the bl case for low - frequency spherical harmonic components of the solution . in figures",
    "[ blversusks ] and  [ blversusks2 ] , different spherical harmonic components of the solution are plotted as a function of time for both the bl and ks evolutions .",
    "the spherical harmonic components are computed by @xmath209 where the integral is taken over the surface @xmath134 .",
    "note that for all plots shown in figures  [ blversusks ] and  [ blversusks2 ] , the spherical harmonic appearing in the integral  ( [ eq : sphericalharmonicintegral ] ) is defined using the kerr - schild @xmath210 and @xmath211 coordinates , and the integral is taken over a surface of constant @xmath13 , not a surface of constant @xmath212 .",
    "thus the quantities plotted in figures  [ blversusks ] and  [ blversusks2 ] are in all cases the spherical harmonic components of @xmath6 with respect to the kerr - schild coordinates .",
    "note also that @xmath213 and the analogous quantity @xmath214 can be used to compute a power index for each individual spherical harmonic component .",
    "for the ks evolution shown in figures  [ blversusks ] and  [ blversusks2 ] , the initial data consist of pure @xmath215 , but @xmath148 and @xmath189 components appear at very early times because of mode mixing .",
    "the tail of the @xmath189 component can be seen as early as @xmath216 , but does not exceed the quasinormal ringing of the @xmath215 component until @xmath135 , after which it dominates .",
    "its measured power index is @xmath217 .",
    "the tail of the @xmath148 component can be seen for @xmath218 , but it is extremely small ( @xmath219 ) .",
    "its decay rate is roughly @xmath199 , but it is difficult to determine the exponent accurately because it is buried in the noise .",
    "the tail of the @xmath215 component can not be seen ; the @xmath215 component is buried in machine roundoff error after @xmath220 .    the bl evolution shown in figures  [ blversusks ] and  [ blversusks2 ] is initially almost identical to the ks case .",
    "initially the bl case is not pure @xmath215 ( recall @xmath19 here refers to the index of the kerr - schild harmonic ; the bl case _ is _ pure @xmath215 with respect to boyer - lindquist spherical harmonics ) , but also has a very small mixture of other components , the largest being @xmath221 ( not shown ) and @xmath148 .",
    "as the bl case evolves in time , the tail of the @xmath189 component first appears at @xmath222 , but it is a few orders of magnitude smaller than the corresponding @xmath189 tail for the ks case . its power index is @xmath223 .",
    "the tail of the @xmath148 component , however , appears at @xmath224 and is a few orders of magnitude _ larger _ than the corresponding @xmath148 tail for the ks case .",
    "its power index is @xmath225 . as in the ks case",
    ", the tail of the @xmath215 component can not be seen because of machine roundoff error .",
    "although at intermediate times the @xmath148 mode is important for the bl case , it is clear from figure  [ blversusks2 ] that at very late times , the @xmath189 mode will eventually dominate , resulting in a decay rate of @xmath193 . in other words",
    ", the asymptotic decay rate appears to be independent of whether the initial data are expressed in terms of kerr - schild or boyer - lindquist spherical harmonics .",
    "thus , the argument in  @xcite apparently does not carry over to the kerr geometry .",
    "this is presumably because kerr has strong - gravity regions that influence the scalar field , and strong - gravity effects were not included in  @xcite .",
    "we perform all our evolutions of bl initial data using a background expressed in ks coordinates ; this is because black hole excision requires coordinates that are regular through the horizon .",
    "a natural question to ask is whether our results are different than they would be if we had expressed our background in bl coordinates .",
    "the answer is yes , but only because we set `` bl initial data '' on a hypersurface of constant ks time , not on a hypersurface of constant bl time .",
    "setting initial data on a hypersurface of constant bl time would require an integration in bl coordinates ( at least until the solution were known on a full hypersurface of constant ks time , and from that point on the evolution could proceed in ks coordinates ) , and is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "however , for investigating the coordinate effect described in  @xcite , it is unnecessary to evolve initial data on a bl time slice ; the derivation of this effect in  @xcite involves no change in time slicing but only a transformation of spatial coordinates , the same transformation that we have done here",
    ".    it would also be interesting to repeat the evolutions in this section with an outgoing initial pulse centered far from the black hole , so that only the weak - gravity region is seen by the scalar field until extremely late times . in this case",
    "the weak - field approximation assumed by  @xcite would be valid for an extended period of time , so during this time one should see a difference in decay rates between the bl and ks evolutions .",
    "such a computation would be more difficult than the ones presented here because it would require a more distant outer boundary and therefore longer integration times .",
    "a single run such as the one shown in figures  [ blversusks ] and  [ blversusks2 ] takes about 23 hours on 30 processors of the ia-32 linux cluster at ncsa ; the run time scales like @xmath226 if all subdomains have the same number of radial collocation points @xmath143 .",
    "future work may involve a self - gravitating scalar field ; in this case the equations would be fully nonlinear .",
