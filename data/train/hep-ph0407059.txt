    "as the time of the lhc turn - on draws nearer , the search for alternative theories to the standard single higgs boson picture of electroweak symmetry breaking is intensifying .",
    "one such scenario @xcite is particularly appealing in that it employs a minimal particle content in a 5-dimensional spacetime and exploits the geometry of the additional dimension to break the electroweak symmetry .",
    "the model is based on the randall - sundrum framework @xcite with an @xmath9 gauge group in 5-d anti - de sitter space .",
    "the ads@xmath1 slice is bounded by two branes , with the scale of physics on the ir(tev)-brane being given by @xmath10 , with @xmath11 corresponding to the rs curvature parameter and @xmath12 being the radius of the compactified dimension .",
    "the set of boundary conditions , which differ for the two branes , generate the breaking chain @xmath13 at the planck scale with the subsequent breaking @xmath14 at the tev scale .",
    "the electroweak symmetry is thus broken without the introduction of a higgs field .",
    "after the planck scale symmetry breaking occurs , a global @xmath15 symmetry is present in the brane description .",
    "this breaks on the tev - brane to a diagonal group @xmath16 which corresponds @xcite to the custodial @xmath17 symmetry of the standard model ( sm ) and helps preserve the sm tree - level relation @xmath18 .",
    "we denote this scenario as the warped higgsless model ( whm ) .    in this scenario , the role of the goldstone boson in generating masses for the @xmath19 and @xmath20 bosons is played by the would be zero - mode of the kk tower corresponding to the @xmath21 component of the bulk gauge fields ( , @xmath22 ) .",
    "the @xmath20 boson observed at lep / slc / tevatron is the first excitation of a neutral gauge boson kk tower , while the photon corresponds to the massless zero - mode of this tower .",
    "the @xmath19 boson observed in experiments is then the first state of a kk tower of charged gauge bosons , and there is no charged massless zero - mode .",
    "the experimentally observed values of the @xmath19 and @xmath20 masses and couplings are essentially reproduced in this model .",
    "however , the presence of the gauge kk states affect a number of processes .",
    "in particular , much work has been performed analyzing the contributions to the set of precision electroweak measurements in higgsless scenarios @xcite . in the flat space analog of the whm @xcite , , a higgsless model based on a flat higher dimensional spacetime , unacceptably large deviations from precision electroweak data are generated .",
    "however , good agreement with the data can be obtained at tree - level in the warped higgsless scenarios , provided that the masses of the kk excitations are sufficiently heavy .",
    "in addition , the kk excitations must satisfy the constraints from direct production of new gauge bosons at the tevatron and from their contribution to contact interactions in four fermion processes at lepii .",
    "note that precision observables are sensitive to one - loop electroweak effects .",
    "in general , the loop corrections in this model will be qualitatively similar to those in the sm ( up to small shifts in the couplings ) .",
    "however , there are three types of loop corrections that may cause large deviations : the gauge kk excitations , the absence of loops with a physical higgs , and the top quark .",
    "since the gauge kks are playing the role of the physical higgs in ww scattering , it is expected that they will do the same here , so the first two effects should largely cancel . in our model all fermions",
    "are localized to the planck brane , and the parameters of the model are adjusted so the couplings are as close to the sm couplings as possible . hence , the top corrections should again approximate the standard model values .",
    "( in a model where the top mass is generated on the tev brane @xcite a more careful treatment would be needed . )",
    "since we expect all loop corrections to qualitatively approximate the sm corrections , we will require that the tree level whm approximate the tree level sm as closely as possible in the analysis below .    in the absence of a higgs boson , or any other new physics , perturbative unitarity ( pu ) in elastic @xmath3 scattering",
    "is violated at an energy scale of @xmath23 tev .",
    "however , in these higgsless scenarios , it is in principle possible that the exchange of the neutral gauge kk tower in @xmath24 can restore pu , provided that a set of conditions on the kk masses and couplings are satisfied @xcite .",
    "this works well in the flat space analog of the whm , but is problematic within the warped scenario .",
    "in particular , the region of parameter space which enjoys good agreement with the precision electroweak and collider data leads to low - scale ( @xmath25 tev ) perturbative unitarity violation ( puv ) in gauge boson scattering @xcite .",
    "one would at least expect the theory to remain perturbative up to the cutoff scale of the effective theory on the tev - brane , @xmath26 , where @xmath26 is roughly on the order of 10 tev .",
    "this leads to a tension in the model parameter space in terms of finding a region which simultaneously satisfies all of the model building requirements as well as the experimental constraints .",
    "in @xcite the effects of including the ir - brane terms associated with the @xmath27 and @xmath16 gauge symmetries were examined ; the presence of such terms is known to alter the corresponding kk spectrum and couplings @xcite . in these analyses",
    "it was found that the addition of the @xmath27 ir - brane term could lead to improved agreement with the electroweak data @xcite and the inclusion of the @xmath16 brane term could delay puv in @xmath28 to scattering energies of order @xmath29 tev @xcite .",
    "however , a scan of the full parameter space was not performed in order to determine whether there exists a region where all the constraints discussed above are simultaneously satisfied .    in this paper , we perform a detailed exploration of the whm parameter space via monte carlo techniques .",
    "there are a number of parameters present in this scenario : ( i ) the set of coupling strengths for each gauge symmetry : @xmath30 which is fixed by @xmath31 , the ratio @xmath32 which is fixed by the value of @xmath33 , and the ratio @xmath34 which lies in the restricted range @xmath35 , but is otherwise free .",
    "( ii ) the brane kinetic terms associated with the ir - brane , @xmath36 , and the uv - brane , @xmath37 . here",
    "the brane terms will be treated as free phenomenological parameters but should in principle be calculable from the full theory once the uv - completion is known .",
    "the parameter space is sufficiently large such that it is best scanned by monte carlo sampling .",
    "for each set of parameters , we subject the model to a succession of tests : ( i ) model requirements , such as the absence of ghosts and tachyon states , ( ii ) consistency with the precision electroweak data , ( iii ) consistency with the direct and indirect collider bounds on new gauge boson production , and ( iv ) pu in elastic @xmath3 scattering . in particular , we require that this scattering process be unitary up to @xmath38 tev . we find that the conditions ( i - iii ) are relatively easy to simultaneously satisfy , but that none of the models satisfied perturbative unitarity beyond the scale of @xmath39 tev .",
    "we conclude that if a successful model of this type exists , it must be highly fine - tuned , or must contain other sources of new physics .",
    "we present our analysis in the next two sections .",
    "the formalism of the whm is presented in detail in our earlier work @xcite and will not be reproduced here .",
    "as discussed above , the model in its present form contains five free parameters : @xmath40 , the ratio of the two @xmath41 gauge couplings which is expected to be of order unity , and the four brane kinetic term parameters , @xmath42 , corresponding to the various unbroken gauge groups on the tev and planck branes : @xmath43 and @xmath44 , respectively .",
    "our approach is to choose a value for @xmath45 and then explore the parameter space spanned by @xmath42 via monte carlo methods . to be definitive",
    "we will assume that all the @xmath46 are constrained to lie in the range @xmath47 as suggested in @xcite , and we fix @xmath48 in our numerical study .",
    "for each set of values of the @xmath46 we define a successful model as one which passes through a number of cuts and filters that we now describe in some detail .",
    "our results are compiled in tables 1 and 2 , which displays the amount of statistics generated for each value of @xmath45 and the number of models which survive each successive constraint .",
    "our statistics are concentrated near @xmath49 as in this case the kk spectrum is relatively light and we are more hopeful that pu constraints will be satisfied .    upon generating a set of @xmath46",
    "we first calculate a group of model parameters which are associated with the lightest massive charged and neutral gauge bosons , and ensure that they are identified with the observed sm fields , @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "we take the experimental values of their masses @xmath52 gev and @xmath53 gev @xcite as input to our analysis .",
    "this numerically fixes the low energy scale @xmath54 that gives the masses of the kk excitations in the rs model , as well as the value of the on - shell weak mixing angle , @xmath55 .",
    "next , the requirement of the absence of ghosts in the unitary gauge of any physical theory implies that these two states , @xmath56 and @xmath57 , must have positive norms .",
    "similarly , the field that represents the photon must also have a positive norm .",
    "in addition to these constraints , we demand that the ratio of the squares of the gauge couplings , @xmath58 , be positive definite .",
    "as can be seen from table 1 , these few simple cuts can remove as much as @xmath59 of the parameter space volume .",
    "assuming that the sm fermions ( at least the first two generations ) are localized near the planck brane we can now calculate a number of electroweak quantities . recall that our philosophy is that we want the tree level higgsless model to match the tree level sm as closely as possible , outside of the higgs sector , since in many cases we expect approximately similar one - loop radiative corrections .",
    "as we found in our earlier works @xcite , a description of the @xmath60 and @xmath20 couplings to the sm matter fields can be parameterized in terms of two other definitions of the weak mixing angle in addition to @xmath61 .",
    "these two additional angles are defined via : @xmath62 , with @xmath63 being the coupling of the @xmath19 to sm fermions on the planck brane , and @xmath64 being given by the couplings of the @xmath20 to the same fermions at the @xmath20-pole as discussed below .",
    "the electromagnetic coupling is , as usual , defined through the interaction of the massless neutral mode , @xmath65 , which we identify as the photon , to the sm fields .",
    "all three definitions of the weak mixing angle are identical at the tree level in the sm but are , in general , quite different numerically in the whm .",
    ".data samples and their responses to the various constraints as described in the text .",
    "the values represent the number of cases surviving each of the cuts . [ cols=\"<,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     in order to verify this result we generated a larger statistical sample , an additional @xmath66 models , distributed over various values of @xmath45 , assuming all of the @xmath67 .",
    "the results from performing these runs are shown in table 2 using the same cuts as above . here",
    "we see that although many models pass the combined collider and electroweak constraints none of them survive the non-@xmath68 coupling requirement .",
    "thus all of these models fail , confirming our previous results .",
    "we checked that this also occurs in the analog flat space model .",
    "we now return to the models with at least one negative @xmath46 .",
    "ordinarily , such models would not be considered since having negative @xmath46 at the tree - level implies the existence of tachyons with all their related difficulties @xcite .",
    "indeed , we have verified numerically that such tachyonic states do indeed exist in the spectrum for all the models in this class , and found that the tachyon masses are quite sensitive to the magnitudes of the @xmath46 .",
    "nomura @xcite , however , has argued that potentially large and negative boundary terms associated with the planck brane may be benignly generated at loop level without the significant influence of tachyons .",
    "these negative brane terms can be of sufficient importance numerically as to require their inclusion in a detailed tree - level analysis such as we are performing here .",
    "in such a case one could view the existence of tachyons as an artifact of including only partial one - loop effects .",
    "since we are ignorant of the possible origin of negative @xmath46 in the full uv - completed theory , we must in principle consider these cases further .",
    "when analyzing the models with negative @xmath46 , one has to take care that the existence of tachyons at the tree level does not have important phenomenological effects , , tachyons that have significant couplings to sm fermions or which contribute substantially to sm processes such as @xmath3 scattering . at the very least ,",
    "if we are to consider models with such states , the tachyons must be _ truly _ benign .",
    "certainly models where these tachyons can lead to important physical effects must not be allowed . however , if the tachyons are significantly decoupled from the sm fields we will consider such theories as benign and examine their pu properties .",
    "based on the analysis of nomura @xcite , as well as our previous work @xcite , one might suspect that the tachyons induced by planck brane kinetic terms , @xmath37 , are benign while those arising from kinetic terms on the tev - brane , @xmath36 , may not be .    as an initial filter ,",
    "we analyze the couplings of tachyons to the sm fermions localized near the planck brane ; clearly , these couplings can depend sensitively on the magnitude of the @xmath46 .",
    "first , we must determine the number of tachyon states that are in the spectrum .",
    "in the flat space analog @xcite of whm it is easy to see that there can be only a single complex conjugate pair of tachyons in each of the neutral and charged kk towers ; we expect this result to be equally valid in the warped case",
    ". a numerical study verifies these expectations and so we need to concern ourselves with only two tachyonic states , @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "we find that in all the sample cases examined the relevant couplings of these states to the sm fermions are suppressed by powers of @xmath71 and are thus exponentially small .",
    "such a result might have been anticipated since the bessel functions of an imaginary argument , @xmath72 and @xmath73 , which are needed to describe the tachyonic wavefunctions , are asymptotic to exponentials instead of sines and cosines as is case for the usual @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "this suppression of couplings is similarly observed to take place in the flat space analog of the current model , though in a more modest fashion due to the absence of warping , where sinh s and cosh s replace the usual sines and cosines in the expression for the tachyonic wavefunctions",
    ". thus consideration of the fermion - fermion - tachyon coupling places no additional constraints on any of the models under consideration .",
    "one should note , however , that such constraints may be of some importance in a wider class of models .    as a second test we turn to @xmath3 elastic scattering . here",
    "we expect a different result as the gauge fields are in the bulk and their wave functions sample the entire region between , as well as on , the two branes .",
    "a quick way to analyze this case is to consider the contribution of the neutral tachyon to the first sum rule of csaki  @xcite , which is one of the conditions for pu .",
    "their derivation of this sum rule relies heavily on the completeness of the set of eigenstates of hermitian operators ; thus the neutral kk spectrum in the case of @xmath76 is not complete unless the tachyon state is included .",
    "clearly as the magnitude of the negative brane terms increase the couplings of the tachyon to sm gauge fields will also increase and the tachyon will become lighter . the important issue for us is whether or not the tachyon state makes a numerically _ significant _ contribution to the sum rule .",
    "our results show that there are essentially three possibilities : ( @xmath77 ) when @xmath78 , we find that the tachyon makes a substantial contribution to the sum rule , which is on the order of @xmath79 or more of that of the photon , even when the magnitude of @xmath80 is small .",
    "in addition , this contribution is _ negative _ , , the tachyon is also a ghost state ! certainly all such cases must be excluded .",
    "this is a powerful constraint as many of the surviving models shown in figs .",
    "3 - 5 have negative values of @xmath80 in the region near @xmath81 .",
    "( @xmath82 ) when @xmath83 , the tachyon is generally sufficiently decoupled as to make almost no significant contribution to the sum rule .",
    "not only are the couplings weak but the masses tend to lie in the multi - tev range .",
    "for example , when @xmath84 , a very extreme value , the tachyon coupling to @xmath85 is found to be @xmath86 which is only dangerous if the tachyon is light . for @xmath87 values of lesser magnitude",
    "the couplings are significantly smaller .",
    "this is as expected since we showed in our earlier work@xcite that in , , a model with @xmath88 , the sum rules were very well satisfied without including any tachyonic contributions .",
    "thus we will retain all such models for further study .",
    "( @xmath89 ) the remaining case where @xmath90 is a bit more problematic .",
    "as we saw in earlier @xcite , @xmath91 has little influence on @xmath3 elastic scattering since it only modifies the spectrum and couplings of the neutral kk s which couple predominantly to @xmath68 .",
    "the tachyon @xmath3 coupling is found to be generally intermediate in strength between that of the @xmath78 case and those for @xmath83 , unless the magnitude of @xmath92 is reasonably large @xmath2 .",
    "our analysis of the surviving sample of models , however , indicates that the values of @xmath92 are indeed of this magnitude or larger .",
    "correspondingly the masses of these states are also dangerously light implying that they can significantly contribute to sm processes .",
    "we thus drop these cases from further consideration below .",
    "summarizing , our numerical study confirms our expectations that the tachyons induced by negative tev - brane kinetic terms are dangerous while those induced by the corresponding planck brane terms are benign unless @xmath87 is very near its lower bound .",
    "figures 6 and 7 show what little remains of our surviving models after we employ the requirement that @xmath93 .",
    "these 10 cases are mostly clustered ( those with large negative @xmath94 ) at high @xmath95 masses in excess of 1.3 tev and have pure isospin - like couplings . those with negative @xmath87 tend to have much lighter @xmath95 masses , of order less than 400 gev . their rather small couplings to fermions place them outside the range accessible to the tevatron .",
    "these are the cases with small masses and large @xmath68-like couplings that have survived the @xmath68 cut imposed above .",
    "unfortunately , these models all have values of @xmath96 and thus have light tachyons with potentially significant couplings @xmath97 and are thus dropped from further consideration .",
    "this leaves only the 7 cases with negative @xmath94 for further examination .",
    "we now turn to the pu characteristics of these few surviving models ; naively we expect all these cases to be problematic since the first kk excitation is always in excess of 1.3 tev even though they are isospin - like coupled .",
    "indeed all of these cases lead to puv in the 1.9 - 2.2 tev range which is not a significant improvement over the case of the sm without a higgs boson .",
    "we thus conclude that none of the surviving models pass our pu requirements leaving us with no remaining models .",
    "note that in obtaining these results we have not required pu to be valid up to the cutoff but only that the successful model to reasonably better than the sm without a higgs .",
    "since we found that puv occured at @xmath98 tev in the surviving models it is interesting to compare this value to that of the cutoff scale , @xmath99 , as determined by naive dimensional analysis@xcite , , @xmath100 following the notation of our earlier work , @xmath101 , where @xmath102 is a number near unity which depends in detail on the values of the @xmath46 . with @xmath103 fixed via @xmath31",
    "this now yields @xmath104 where @xmath48 in our analysis . taking typical model values",
    "we find that @xmath105 tev , which is much larger that the @xmath106 values obtained above for puv .",
    "thus puv is apparently lost long before the cutoff is reached .",
    "in this paper we have performed a detailed tree - level monte carlo exploration of the parameter space of the 5-d warped higgsless model which is based on the @xmath107 gauge group in the randall - sundrum bulk .",
    "we have generated several millions of test models allowing for arbitrary gauge kinetic terms on both the planck and tev branes which are parameterized through the @xmath46 coefficients . as we have seen from our earlier work",
    "this scenario suffers from a serious tension between constraints arising from precision electroweak measurements and collider data as well as the requirements of perturbative unitarity in @xmath3 elastic scattering up to the @xmath108 tev scale .",
    "we have shown that it is relatively easy to find a class of models which satisfy all of the current direct and indirect collider bounds and yet has electroweak properties which are extremely close to those of the tree - level sm .",
    "as before , the size of the parameter space that satisfies the precision ew constraints increases dramatically as @xmath45 increases .",
    "the real difficulty arises when we require the same theories to also satisfy perturbative unitarity while being free of dangerous tachyons .",
    "though we have generated a fairly large data sample , none of the models we have examined have been able to satisfy all of our requirements simultaneously .",
    "we do note that if a generic solution of the puv problem is found , there appears to be enough room in the parameter space to accomodate precision ew constraints .",
    "absent such a solution , we can thus conclude that either successful models of this type are highly fine - tuned or must include additional sources of new physics @xcite which unitarizes the @xmath3 scattering amplitude .",
