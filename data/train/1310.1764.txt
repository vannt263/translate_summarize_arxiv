    "several lattice calculations @xcite have predicted the existence of a critical point in the qcd phase diagram , which marks the boundary of cross - over and first - order phase transition between the hadronic and qcd matter in the plane of baryochemical potential @xmath4 and temperature @xmath5 .",
    "however , only the cross - over phase transition was seen in the continuum extrapolated results @xcite . in 2010 , a beam energy scan program was launched at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) to study the features of the phase diagram and to investigate if any signals of a critical point can be found within the available range of @xmath4 .    by running experiments at different beam energies , collisions with varying peak temperatures and values of @xmath4",
    "are produced that span a large region in the phase diagram of strongly interacting matter .",
    "so far , the scanned energy range reaches from @xmath6 gev down to 7.7 gev , extending the baryochemical range from @xmath7 up to @xmath8 mev .",
    "additional fixed target collisions down to @xmath9 gev have been planned , which increase the @xmath4-range even further @xcite .",
    "this region of the phase diagram will also be the target for more detailed studies with much higher luminosities at the facility for antiproton and ion research ( fair ) , which is currently under construction .",
    "one of the key observables considered as the evidence of the formation of the strongly interacting matter , `` quark - gluon plasma '' ( qgp ) at rhic and the large hadron collider ( lhc ) is the elliptic flow , typically characterized by coefficient @xmath0 of the fourier expansion of the azimuthal angle distribution of the final state particles .",
    "one would expect @xmath0 to decrease at lower beam energies , as the duration of the qgp phase gets smaller .",
    "however , the inclusive charged hadron @xmath0 has demonstrated surprisingly weak dependence on the collision energy between 7.7 and 39 gev @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the preliminary results for the next fourier coefficient @xmath1 , known as triangular flow , display a clearer change in magnitude for this observable between @xmath10 gev @xcite .",
    "the weak energy dependence of the elliptic flow thus requires an explanation .",
    "the beam energy dependence of the collective flow has been recently studied with several different models @xcite .",
    "the method chosen for the present study is a hybrid approach , where a transport model  a microscopic description of the system  is utilized for the non - equilibrium phases at the beginning and in the end of a heavy - ion collision event , while a macroscopic hydrodynamical description is used to model the hot and dense intermediate stage incorporating the phase transition between the qgp and hadronic matter .",
    "such a hybrid model provides a consistent framework for investigating both high - energy heavy ion collisions with negligible net - baryon density and a large hydrodynamically evolving medium , and the collisions at smaller energies with finite net - baryon density , where no such medium is formed .",
    "thus , this approach is optimal for studying the beam energy dependence of the elliptic and triangular flow .",
    "the next section provides a brief account of the main features of the applied hybrid model .",
    "the simulation results are presented in section  [ sec_results ] . after comparing the transverse mass spectra of various particles against the experimental data in subsection  [ sec_res_spectra ] , we study the elliptic and triangular flow in subsections  [ sec_res_v2 ] and [ sec_res_v3 ] , respectively , concluding with an investigation of the dependence of flow coefficients on the initial collision geometry in  [ sec_res_geometry ] .",
    "we then summarize our findings in section  [ sec_summary ] .",
    "this study was performed using a boltzmann + hydrodynamics hybrid model described in @xcite . in this framework , both the initial state before equilibrium and the final state with hadronic rescatterings and decays is calculated within the ultrarelativistic quantum molecular dynamics ( urqmd ) string / hadronic cascade @xcite .",
    "the intermediate hydrodynamical evolution starts , when the two colliding nuclei have passed through each other : @xmath11 where @xmath12 represents the nuclear radius and @xmath13 is the lorentz factor in the center - of - mass frame of the colliding nuclei .",
    "a minimum starting time of 0.5 fm is chosen based on the hybrid model results at the collision energy @xmath6 gev @xcite . at this time",
    ", the energy- , momentum- and baryon number densities of the particles are mapped onto the hydro grid .",
    "the particles are represented by 3d gaussian distributions that are lorentz - contracted in the beam direction .",
    "the width parameter of these gaussians is chosen to have the value @xmath14 fm to preserve the event - by - event initial state fluctuations .",
    "the spectator particles , which do not participate on the hydrodynamical evolution , are propagated separately in the cascade .",
    "the evolution of the system in the intermediate phase is based on ( 3 + 1)-d ideal hydrodynamics , solving the evolution equations using the shasta algorithm @xcite .",
    "the equation of state ( eos ) is based on a hadronic chiral parity doublet model including quark degrees of freedom and the thermal contribution of the polyakov loop @xcite .",
    "this eos qualitatively agrees with the lattice qcd data at @xmath15 and , most importantly , is also applicable at finite baryon densities .",
    "after the last step of the hydrodynamical evolution , the active equation of state is changed from the deconfinement eos to the hadron gas eos , to ensure that the active degrees of freedom on both sides of the transition hypersurface are exactly equivalent @xcite .",
    "the transition from hydro to transport , also known as `` particlization '' , is done when the energy density @xmath16 is smaller than the critical value @xmath17 , where @xmath18 mev/@xmath19 represents the nuclear ground state energy density .",
    "this corresponds roughly to a switching temperature @xmath20 mev at @xmath6 gev au+au collisions @xcite .",
    "while the switching criterion with respect to the energy density is kept constant over all collision energies , it will correspond to different combinations of temperature and baryochemical potential at different values of @xmath21 .",
    "the four - dimensional iso - energy density spacetime surface is constructed using the cornelius hypersurface finder @xcite . from this hypersurface ,",
    "the particle distributions are generated according to the cooper - frye formula .",
    "rescatterings and final decays of these particles are then computed in urqmd .",
    "the end result is a distribution of particles which is directly comparable against the experimental data .",
    "the dynamic change in the importance of the non - equilibrium transport and the hydrodynamic part of the evolution and having a proper equation of state applicable at high net baryon densities are the main advantages of this hybrid approach . as it is enough for the purposes of this study to reach a qualitative agreement with the experimental results , we neglect the viscosity effects during the hydrodynamical evolution .",
    "the high viscosity in the hadron gas phase is included , however .",
    "compared to the previous investigations of the elliptic flow using the same hybrid approach @xcite , the new features in this study are the new implementation of the cooper - frye hypersurface finder and particlization , described above , and replacing the reaction plane ( rp ) analysis with the event plane ( ep ) method @xcite when computing @xmath0 and @xmath1 from the particle momentum distributions .",
    "our first step is to check how well the current setup of the hybrid model reproduces experimental data for bulk observables .",
    "the @xmath22 spectra at midrapidity @xmath23 for @xmath24 and @xmath25 in pb+pb -collisions with beam energy @xmath26 agev ( corresponding to the collision energy @xmath27 gev ) is illustrated in figure  [ figure_mt_spectra]a . a good agreement with the na49 data @xcite is found ,",

    "it remains as a question for a future study to see if both the particle spectra and the flow can be made to match the data with the same choice of parameters ; likely the viscous corrections will prove to be necessary .",
    "however , for this investigation the most important thing is the qualitative agreement with the data  for midcentral collisions , the observed modest collision energy dependence is well reproduced by the model . in the most central collisions ,",

    "the triangular flow @xmath1 is a good observable for measuring the system sensitivity to the initial state fluctuations , as it is generated solely by event - by - event variations in the initial configuration of the colliding nucleons . compared to the elliptic flow , triangular flow is considerably less sensitive to the overall collision geometry",

    "the energy dependence of midecentral @xmath1 is very similar to what was seen for the hydrodynamically produced @xmath0 in figure  [ figure_v2_phases]b , suggesting that in this case the transport part of the model is unable to compensate for the diminished hydro phase .",
    "like @xmath1 , the event plane elliptic flow @xmath31 is also affected by the initial state fluctuations , as the event plane angle ( and thus the tilt of the @xmath0-generating ellipsoid ) varies event - by - event .",

    "@xcite .",

    "[ figure_timedependence]b that , with the exception of the most central collisions at @xmath3 gev , the scaled @xmath1 points form an uniform , monotonically increasing function of @xmath68 . for @xmath0 , the different centralities do not have such uniform behavior because of the additional elliptic flow produced by the transport part at low energies . in other words ,",
    "the final triangular flow is purely a product of hydrodynamics at all beam energies , while the final elliptic flow at low @xmath21 is not .",
    "in this article , we have investigated the collision energy dependence of the flow coefficients @xmath0 and @xmath1 in a hybrid transport + hydrodynamics approach . in such a framework",

    "in addition , the scaled @xmath1 points over several collision energies and centrality classes form an uniform function of the hydro duration @xmath68 , whereas for the elliptic flow the relation is distorted by the transport dynamics . thus , compared to @xmath0 , the triangular flow provides a clearer signal for the formation of ( near-)ideal fluid in heavy ion collisions .    for the future studies , the issues with kaon production and @xmath39 overestimating the data at higher @xmath40 will necessitate a slight re - tuning of the model parameters and possibly the addition of viscous corrections to the hydrodynamical phase for the optimal agreement with the experimental data",
    "also , while the values for the triangular flow @xmath1 at high collision energies ( and also at the lower limit @xmath73 gev ) quantitatively agree with the experimental results , there is a qualitative disagreement with the preliminary star data , where no beam energy dependence is seen within 0 - 5% , 5 - 10% or 10 - 20% centrality at @xmath74 gev @xcite .",
    "as the hadron resonance gas has proven to be too viscous for producing @xmath1 from initial state fluctuations in this investigation , the current discrepancy between the simulation results and the preliminary experimental data implies that larger quantities of low - viscous state of matter is manifested at lower collision energies than expected in this study . on the other hand ,",
    "the inconsistent behavior of flow observables at @xmath3 gev compared to the higher energy points suggest that the lower energy limit of applicability may have been reached for the ideal hydrodynamics approach .",
