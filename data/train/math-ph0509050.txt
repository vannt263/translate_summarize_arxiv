    "being invented 40 years ago by buchberger  @xcite for algorithmic solving of the membership problem in the theory of polynomial ideals , the grbner bases method has become a powerful universal algorithmic tool for solving various mathematical problems arising in science and engineering .",
    "though overwhelming majority of the grbner bases applications is still found in commutative polynomial algebra , over the last decade a substantial progress has also been achieved in application of grbner bases to noncommutative polynomial algebra , to algebra of differential operators and to linear partial differential equations ( see , for example , book  @xcite ) . as to the difference algebra , i.e. algebra of difference polynomials , in spite of its conceptual algorithmic similarity to differential algebra ,",
    "only a few efforts have been done to extend the theory of grbner bases to difference algebra and to exploit their algorithmic power  @xcite .",
    "recently , two promising applications of difference grbner bases were revealed : generation of difference schemes for numerical solving of pdes  @xcite and reduction of multiloop feynman integrals to the minimal set of basis integrals  @xcite .    in this note",
    "we describe an algorithm ( sect.4 ) for constructing grbner bases for linear difference systems that is an adaptation of our polynomial algorithm  @xcite to linear difference ideals .",
    "we construct a grbner basis in its janet - like form ( sect.3 ) , since this approach has shown its computational efficiency in the polynomial case  @xcite .",
    "we briefly outline these efficiency issues in sect.5 .",
    "the difference form of the algorithm exploits some basic notions and concepts of difference algebra ( sect.2 ) as well as the definition of janet - like grbner bases and janet - like reductions together with the algorithmic characterization of janet - like bases ( sect.3 ) .",
    "we conclude in sect.6 .",

    "it is clear that condition  ( [ jlgb ] ) implies ( [ gb ] ) .",
    "note , however , that the converse is generally not true .",
    "therefore , not every grbner basis is janet - like .",
    "the properties of a janet - like basis are very similar to those of a janet basis  @xcite , but the former is generally more compact than the latter .",
    "more preciously , let @xmath75 be a reduced grbner basis  @xcite , @xmath76 be a minimal janet basis , and @xmath77 be a minimal janet - like basis of the same ideal for the same ranking . then their cardinalities satisfy @xmath78 where @xmath79 abbreviates",
    "_ cardinality _ , that is , the number of elements .    whereas the algorithmic characterization of a grbner basis is zero redundancy of all its @xmath80 polynomials  @xcite , the algorithmic characterization of a janet - like basis @xmath46 is the following condition  ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) : @xmath81 this condition is at the root of the algorithmic construction of janet - like bases as described in the next section .",
    "janet - like grbner basis(@xmath82)[jlb ]    @xmath83 , a finite set ;  @xmath22 , a ranking @xmath46 , a janet - like basis of @xmath18 @xmath67 with the lowest @xmath84 w.r.t .",

    "it outputs a minimal janet - like grbner basis which ( if monic , that is , normalized by division of each polynomial by its leading coefficient ) is uniquely defined by the input set @xmath17 and ranking @xmath22 .",
    "correctness and termination of the algorithm follow from the proof given in  @xcite ; in so doing the displacement of some elements of the intermediate sets @xmath46 into @xmath96 at step 13 provides minimality of the output basis .",
    "the algorithm terminates when the set @xmath96 becomes empty in accordance with  ( [ alg_char ] ) .",
    "the subalgorithm * normal  form*@xmath97 performs the janet - like reductions ( sect.3 ) of the input difference polynomial @xmath98 modulo the set @xmath46 and outputs the janet - like normal form of @xmath98 . as long as the intermediate difference polynomial @xmath99 has a term janet - like reducible modulo @xmath46 , the elementary reduction of this term is done at step 4 . as usually in the grbner bases techniques  @xcite",
    ", the reduction is terminated in finitely many steps due to the properties of the ranking ( sect.2 ) .",
    "normal form@xmath97    @xmath100 , a polynomial ; @xmath101 , a finite set ; @xmath22 , a ranking @xmath102 , the @xmath73normal form of @xmath98 modulo @xmath46 @xmath103 @xmath104 such that @xmath105 with @xmath106 @xmath107 @xmath99    an improved version of the above algorithm can easily be derived from the one for the involutive algorithm  @xcite if one replaces the input involutive division by a janet - like monomial division  @xcite and then translates the algorithm into linear difference algebra .",
    "in particular , the improved version includes buchberger s criteria adjusted to janet - like division and avoids the repeated prolongations @xmath108 at step 16 of the algorithm .",
    "the polynomial version of algorithm * janet - like grbner basis * implemented in its improved form in c++  @xcite has disclosed its high computational efficiency for the standard set of benchmarks . if one compares this algorithm with the involutive one  @xcite specialized in janet division , then all the computational merits of the latter algorithm are retained , namely :    * automatic avoidance of some useless reductions . *",
    "weakened role of the criteria : even without applying any criteria the algorithm is reasonably fast . by contrast , buchberger s algorithm without applying the criteria becomes unpractical even for rather small problems .",
    "* smooth growth of intermediate coefficients .",
    "* fast search of a polynomial reductor which provides an elementary janet - like reduction of the given term .",
    "it should be noted that as well as in the involutive algorithm such a reductor , if it exists , is unique .",
    "the fast search is based on the special data structures called janet trees  @xcite . *",
    "natural and effective parallelism .",
    "though one needs intensive benchmarking for linear difference systems , we have solid grounds to believe that the above listed computational merits hold also for the difference case .    as this takes place , computation of a janet - like basis",
    "is more efficient than computation of a janet basis by the involutive algorithm  @xcite .",
    "the inequality  ( [ cardinalities ] ) for monic bases is a consequence of the inclusion  @xcite : @xmath109 there are many systems for which the cardinality of a janet - like basis is much closer to that of the reduced grbner basis than the cardinality of a janet basis .",
    "certain binomial ideals called toric form an important class of such problems .",
    "toric ideals arise in a number of problems of algebraic geometry and closely related to integer programming . for this class of ideals",
    "the cardinality of janet bases is typically much larger than that of reduced grbner bases  @xcite",
    ". for illustrative purposes consider a difference analogue of the simple toric ideal  @xcite generated in the ring of difference operators by the following set : @xmath110 the reduced grbner basis for the degree - reverse - lexicographic ranking with @xmath111 is given by @xmath112 the janet - like basis computed by the above algorithm contains one more element @xmath113 whereas the janet basis adds another six extra elements to the janet - like basis  @xcite .",
    "the presence of extra elements in a janet basis in comparison with a janet - like basis is obtained because of certain additional algebraic operations .",
    "that is why the computation of a janet - like basis is more efficient than the computation of a janet basis .",
    "both bases , however , contain the reduced grbner basis as the internally fixed  @xcite subset of the output basis .",
    "hence , having any of the bases computed , the reduced grbner basis is easily extracted without any extra computational costs .",
    "the above presented algorithm is implemented , in its improved form , as a maple package  @xcite , and already applied to generation of difference schemes for pdes and to reduction of some loop feynman integrals ( see some examples in  @xcite ) .",
    "the last problem for more than 3 internal lines with masses is computationally hard for the current version of the package .",
    "one reason for this is that the maple implementation does not support janet trees since maple does not provide efficient data structures for trees .",
    "another reason is that in the improved version of the algorithm there is still some freedom in the selection strategy for elements in @xmath96 to be reduced modulo @xmath46 .",
    "though our algorithms are much less sensitive to the selection strategy than buchberger s algorithm , the running time still depends substantially on the selection strategy : mainly because of dependence of the intermediate coefficients growth on the selection strategy . to find a heuristically good selection strategy one needs to do intensive benchmarking with difference systems . in turn",
    ", this requires an extensive data base of various benchmarks that , unlike polynomial benchmarks , up to now is missing for difference systems .",
    "in addition to our further research on improvements of the maple package , we are going to implement the difference algorithm in c++ as a module of the open source software ginv available on the web site http://invo.jinr.ru .",
    "the comparison of implementations of polynomial involutive algorithms for janet bases in maple and in c++  @xcite shows that the c++ code is of two or three order faster than its maple counterpart .",
    "together with efficient parallelization of the algorithm this gives a real hope for its practical applicability to problems of current interest in reduction of loop integrals .",
