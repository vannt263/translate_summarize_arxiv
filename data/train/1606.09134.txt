    "a nonrelativistic test particle of charge @xmath0 and mass @xmath1 , placed at a distance @xmath2 from an infinite and perfectly reflecting flat wall , presents a stochastic motion induced by vacuum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field .",

    "this model was extended by including two plates @xcite and finite - temperature effects @xcite , and more recently a model for `` noncancellation of vacuum fluctuations '' based on this system was proposed @xcite .",
    "notice that @xmath16 diverges at @xmath17 , and both components @xmath16 and @xmath13 diverge at @xmath18 , which corresponds to a round trip of a light signal between the test particle and the reflecting wall .",
    "it was suggested @xcite that these divergences appear as a consequence of assuming an oversimplified model with a sharp boundary condition on the electric field at the perfectly reflecting wall .",
    "improved models were proposed by introducing a smooth ( instead of a sudden ) switching - on / off mechanism @xcite , and later by considering a gaussian wave - packet distribution in the time direction @xcite . in both cases some different results",
    "were obtained , as compared to those in ref .",
    "the main difference is the prediction that the perpendicular component of the velocity variance vanishes as @xmath14 , suggesting that no stationary behavior would remain .",
    "the focus of these works was on the temporal asymptotic regime .",
    "the results were not obtained exactly for all regimes .",
    "furthermore , when the smooth switching mechanism was introduced @xcite only the dispersion of the perpendicular component of the velocity was examined .",
    "the existence of the above - mentioned divergences in a more realistic model has not been properly discussed so far .",
    "we notice however that when an idealized lorentzian switching is implemented @xcite , the divergence at @xmath19 is naturally regularized . nevertheless , the physical system studied here requires a switching function that assumes a nonzero constant value in a finite interval  a flat measuring part @xcite .",
    "such an interval characterizes the region where the particle is under the effect of the modified vacuum fluctuations induced by the presence of the wall . despite the fact that a lorentzian switching does not contain a flat measuring part ( and",
    "thus it is not suitable to model the system ) , this result already suggests that an appropriated switching mechanism would remove this divergence .    a similar system based on a quantum scalar field in ( 1 + 1 ) dimensions was recently studied @xcite . in such a model it is concluded that allowing the particle position to fluctuate leads to a nonsingular behavior of the dispersion of its velocity .",
    "an extension of this model for ( 3 + 1 ) dimensions has not yet been discussed .    in this paper",
    "we go a step further in the analysis of the motion of a test charged particle driven by vacuum fluctuations in the presence of a reflecting wall .",

    "no divergences appear .",

    "our analysis is restricted to the case where the particle displacement is negligible so that we may take its position @xmath27 to be a constant @xcite . relaxing this condition amounts to assuming that @xmath28 , and time integrals involving @xmath27 should be taken over the worldline of the particle . however , whenever low - velocity regime is assumed , it can be shown that corrections arising from this assumption are negligible .",
    "a specific case of allowing the particle to be initially undergoing nonrelativistic motion in a given direction will be discussed in more detail later .",
    "equation ( [ eq1 ] ) admits a sort of sudden switching process , where the interaction is instantaneously turned on at an initial time @xmath29 and turned off after an interval of time @xmath3 . in a more realistic setup , finite intervals of time associated with starting ( switching on ) and ending ( switching off ) an interaction regime should be considered .",

    "( [ switching ] ) we are assuming that a smooth transition must exist between the two different stages : a particle near the wall and a particle in empty space .",
    "for instance , we can imagine that the wall is placed near the particle in a certain interval of time ( the switching time ) , after which it is removed , or that the particle moves from an empty region of space to the region where the wall is placed . in both cases",
    "the interaction between the particle and the wall effectively begins before @xmath33 and still exists after @xmath34 .",
    "this aspect is clearly satisfied when a smooth transition is assumed .",

    "however , regarding the magnitude of the effects induced by vacuum fluctuations , for large values of @xmath36 both methods may lead to the same results , as contributions related to the tails will be completely negligible .",
    "we wish to study the case where the charged particle is subjected to a fluctuating electric field @xmath20 . more specifically , in our approach the electric field @xmath20 is a purely quantum quantity and has a null mean value @xmath45 , but presents non - zero second - order correlations @xmath46 .",

    "the presence of the wall will modify the minkowski vacuum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field and will produce an effect on the state of motion of the particle that can be measured by looking at the fluctuations of its velocity .",

    "as seen in sec . [ secsw ] , the parameter @xmath36 introduced by @xmath41 depends upon the switching interval of time @xmath40 . in order to examine a specific example , suppose the system is prepared in such a way that a charged particle , initially in an empty region , experiences the presence of a perfectly reflecting plane wall of size @xmath78 during a time @xmath3 .",
    "assume the transition between the different stages ( the empty region and the region with the wall ) occurs in an interval of time corresponding to one - hundredth of @xmath3 .",

    "it comes from an empty region , passes by the wall , and continues traveling through empty space .",
    "the travel time of the particle across the wall is thus @xmath83 , and corresponds approximately to the time interval during which the electron is under the influence of the modified vacuum fluctuations due to the presence of the wall .",

    "the interval of time in which the electron moves from the wall to the condensation plate is given by @xmath95 .",
    "hence , concentrating on the effect in the @xmath2 direction , an electron is expected to arrive at the condensation plate within a range of positions given by 2@xmath96 .",
    "a possible realization of the above experiment could be achieved by setting @xmath97 , @xmath98 , and @xmath99 . with this configuration ,",
    "we would obtain @xmath100 this seems to be a measurable consequence of the quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field .",

    "hence , it is a straightforward numerical exercise to obtain the magnitude of the effect for heavier particles in different configurations , provided the limits of applicability of the model are observed .",
    "the speed of the electron in the above estimates is just @xmath106 , which leads to a relativistic factor of the order @xmath107 . in this regime",
    "we do not expect to have contributions from the dynamical casimir effect .",
    "however , as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , radiation is expected to be emitted by the electron as a switching effect .",
    "considering the specific model studied in the last section , in which the electron moves parallel to the wall , the angular spectral density of radiation @xcite from the electron has a magnitude that decreases exponentially with the distance from the electron to the edge of the wall .",
    "just to have an estimate , it can be shown that the total energy emitted perpendicularly to the wall ( in the entire frequency range ) when the electron is in its maximum approximation to the edge of the wall is approximately given by @xmath108 .",
    "now , if we assume that this energy is concentrated in a single photon it would lie in the microwave frequency band , and its backreaction over the electron velocity would be of the order of @xmath109 .",
    "hence , this effect also contributes to the total dispersion of the electron velocity , but with a lower magnitude .",
    "the contribution of this effect to the total dispersion of the particle velocity could be tracked by measuring the radiation emitted by the electron during the switching , and it could eventually be experimentally distinguished from the contribution produced by vacuum fluctuations .",
    "in a previous work @xcite a simplified ( 1 + 1)-dimensional model based on a test particle interacting with a quantum scalar field near a perfectly reflecting boundary was investigated .",
    "it was shown that the dispersion of the velocity of the test particle exhibits a behavior similar to that of a charged particle under the influence of vacuum fluctuations of the electric field in the presence of a reflecting boundary @xcite .",
    "in such a simplified model , when a gaussian blurring is performed on the position of the particle ( which partially models its quantum behavior ) it is shown that the divergence at @xmath19 is regularized . however , when generalized to higher dimensions , it can be shown that this kind of regularization does not work on all components of the particle velocity .",
    "we suspect that this method of introducing a blurring in the particle position will work well for a particle in a box , because then there would be boundary conditions in all spatial directions .",
    "this issue deserves further investigation .",
    "a new aspect introduced in this paper was the implementation of a smooth two - parameter switching function connecting the distinct stages in the description of the system .",
    "as a consequence , the dispersions in all components of the particle velocity were found to be non - singular functions of time and distance to the wall .",
    "divergences previously found in the literature , and linked to an oversimplification of the model , were naturally regularized .",
    "in particular , we conclude that the divergence at @xmath19 is more closely related with the assumption of a sudden switching approach than that of a sharp boundary condition on the wall . additionally , the switching functions we introduced have the advantage of allowing analytic integration of the dispersions , which gave handle results that can be easily adapted to possible experimental situations .",
    "our results suggest that the quantum - vacuum - induced effects on the motion of a charged test particle could be tested by means of measuring the dispersions of the trajectory of the particle .",
    "another important result we found is the late - time behavior of the dispersions when the smooth switching is implemented .",
    "compared to the sudden switching [ which leads to a finite dispersion @xmath16 even in the limit @xmath110 , when the smooth switching is implemented the dispersions of all velocity components go away in this limit , which is expected from the energy conservation law .",
    "the dispersions appear as consequence of the way the system is set up , which is translated in terms of the specific switching that is implemented .",
    "a sharp boundary condition and sudden switching are rather convenient idealized assumptions that keep calculations simple , but they usually lead to singular behavior of certain physical quantities .",
    "there are several different methods of implementing regularization in problems involving idealized boundaries .",
    "the central idea is to perform a blur of the boundary position . a different way to look for a regularization of the above - mentioned divergences would be by assuming more realistic boundaries , such as considering the particle near a half - space filled with a dielectric material .",
    "quantum correlations of electric and magnetic fields near a homogenous nondissipative dielectric have already been considered in the literature ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "it would be interesting to investigate the effect studied here in the presence of such boundaries .",
    "the existence of a classical interaction between the charged particle and the conducting wall was ignored in our study .",
    "it is a well - known fact that a charged particle interacts with a conducting wall and is affected by a force caused by the redistribution of free charge on the wall .",
    "however , such an effect is only responsible for a deflection of the trajectory of the test particle , with no contributions to quantum dispersions .",
    "for instance , in the figure illustrating a possible experiment to measure the consequences of such dispersions , the same distribution of arrival positions of the electron around a central point would be observed , but the whole distribution would appear shifted by a certain distance , say @xmath111 , caused by the classical effect .    as a final remark , in sec .",
    "iv we implemented renormalization with respect to the minkowski vacuum , i.e. , we subtracted from the dispersions the terms related to the free - space electric field correlation functions .",
    "so , the modified vacuum is solely responsible for the effect we studied .",
    "in fact , free - space vacuum fluctuations do not induce measurable effects on the motion of the test particle .",
    "this is because such fluctuations are highly anticorrelated @xcite . as a concrete example , ref .",
    "@xcite explicitly showed that test particles in the scalar - field free vacuum do not experience any influence on their motion .",
