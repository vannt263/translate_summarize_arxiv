    "in order to understand the basic properties underlying the observed agn s spectra , a number of consistent correlations among the observational parameters have been explored . among these properties ,",
    "the eigenvector 1 ( e1 ) introduced by boroson & green ( 1992 , hereafter bg92 ) is a milestone .",
    "these authors examined the properties of a sample of 87 bright palomar - green ( pg ) quasars and found from a principal component analysis ( pca ) that the e1 correlates with the strength of feii and anti - correlates with the strength of the [ oiii ] line emission .",
    "up to date , the best e1 correlation space involves ( 1 ) rfe , defined as flux ratio between the feii complex and h@xmath4 , and ( 2)fwhm of h@xmath4 broad component , supplemented by ( 3 ) soft x - ray photon index , @xmath5 ( e.g. wang et al . 1996 ; sulentic et al . 2000a ; xu et al . 2003 ; sulentic et al . 2002 ; grupe 2004 , laor et al . 1997 ; lawrence et al . 1997 ; grupe et al . 1999 ; vaughan et al . 2001 ; sulentic et al . 2004 ) .    at present",
    ", a great deal of evidence suggests that the eddington ratio , defined as @xmath6 , is the principle physical driver of e1 ( e.g. sulentic et al .",

    "; grupe 2004 ; marziani et al . 2003b ; bg92 ) .",
    "moreover , marziani et al .",
    "( 2001 ) reproduced an artificial relationship between rfe and fwhm of h@xmath4 , the strongest anti - correlation in e1 space , by combining some observational and numerical simulation results . in their process",
    ", the relation can be interpreted as driven by @xmath6 associated with central black hole mass .",
    "the evolutionary significance of e1 was suggested that it might represent the `` age '' of agn ( grupe et al .",
    "1999 ; grupe 2004 ) .",
    "narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxies ( nls1s ) with large @xmath6 and small black hole mass might be young agns with more activity and in their earlier evolution phase ( mathur 2000 ) .",
    "over past few years there have been remarkable developments in understanding of connection between agn and star formation in their host galaxies . a tight correlation between the mass of the black hole and the mass of galactic bugle",
    "within which it resides has been firmly established in past decade ( e.g. ferrarese & merritt 2000 ; gebhardt et al .",
    "2000 ; marconi & hunt 2003 ; magorrian et al . 1998 ; richston et al .",
    "1998 ; tremaine et al .",
    "on the basis of this correlation many investigations indicated that there might be a close connection between the formation of the black hole and that of its host galaxy ( heckman et al .",
    "2004 and references therein ) .",
    "if the black hole co - evolves with galactic bulge , and if the e1 is related with the `` age '' of agn as suggested by grupe ( 2004 ) , it is logically expected that the nuclear stellar population is related with the e1 correlations .",
    "this relationship could be directly examined by investigating the nuclear stellar populations by optical stellar absorption features ( most notably the balmer series and hei lines ) in broad line agns .",
    "in fact , so far a few attempts to detect the nuclear stellar features in type i agns have been made .",
    "canalizo & stockton ( 2001 ) investigated the age of nuclear stellar populations in the host of nine nearby qsos by detection of balmer absorption lines in the surrounding of the qso or nebular hii emission lines .",
    "the estimated ages range from a few myr old to poststarburst ages .",
    "brotherton et al .",
    "( 1999 ) identified a stellar component with 400 myr old instantaneous starburst in quasar unj1025 - 0040 .",

    "zhou et al .",
    "( 2005 ) recently compiled a sample of 74 poststarburst type i agns from sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) .",

    "the question of the nuclear stellar population can be approached in an alternative way .",
    "the far - infrared warmness as quantified by the @xmath2(60,25 ) index   is defined as @xmath7}{\\log(\\lambda_2/\\lambda_1)}$ ] , where the wavelengths are in units of @xmath8 m .",
    "] has been usually used as an important tool to discriminate agn and starburst activity in the nuclear or circumnuclear regions of galaxies ( de grijp et al .",
    "1985 ; lipari 1994 ; barthel 2001 ) .",
    "because of additional heating input from the hard continuum radiation of central active nucleus , agns have warmer dust the do starburst regions ( e.g. low et al .",
    "1988 ) . the color @xmath2(60,25 ) , therefore , allows us to address the relative importance of agn - activity and starburst - activity in not too distant active galaxies ( see section 4.1 for details ) .",
    "in this paper , we will use the infrared colors adopted from the iras survey to extend the well - known e1 relationships to agn s infrared properties .",
    "there is another goal of this paper .",
    "recently , a new relationship between flux ratio of [ oiii ] to h@xmath4 narrow component and flux ratio of optical feii blends to h@xmath4 broad component was found in an agn sample with high x - ray to optical flux ratio from rosat all - sky survey ( rass ) ( xu et al .",
    "2003 ) . in their analysis",
    ", there were always large uncertainties in the determining the fraction of h@xmath4 emitting from the nlr .",
    "deblending the optical permitted lines in a majority of cases is difficult because no transition between the narrow and broad components is observed .",

    "intermediate - type balmer emission profile allows us to accurately extract narrow h@xmath4 component from the integrated profile of emission line .    in this paper",
    ", we examine the properties of optical emission lines of 50 bright seyfert 1.5 galaxies and discuss their connection with infrared colors .",
    "these nearby agns were selected from the catalog of quasars and active nuclei : 10th edition ( veron - cetty & veron 2001 ) and the catalog of the the iras survey .",
    "both direct correlations and pca method are used to analyze the observed properties .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",

    "the statistical properties are investigated in  3 .",
    "several diagnostically important correlations are studied .",

    "a brief summary of main conclusions of this paper is given in the final section .",
    "a cosmology with cosmological constant : @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 is adopted for luminosity calculations .",
    "the sample of objects was compiled from the catalog of quasars and active nuclei : 10th edition ( veron - cetty & veron 2001 ) and iras survey . because of the constraint of the observatory site and instrumental capability , the objects were selected by requiring the objects to be in the northern sky ( @xmath14 ) and to be optical bright ( @xmath15 ) . specially , there are total 66 such objects listed in veron - cetty & veron ( 2001 ) .",
    "seven of the objects were not observed because of the poor weather conditions .",
    "total 59 high quality spectra were obtained by using naoc 2.16 m telescope in xinglong observatory during several observing runs performed from november 2001 to october 2004 .",
    "the observations were carried out by omr spectrograph , using a tektronix @xmath16 ccd as detector .",
    "two sets of spectra , denoted as set a and b , were involved in final emission lines measurements . for each object ,",
    "the observation was performed with either set a or b. the set a spectra were taken with a grating of 300 @xmath17 and a slit of 2oriented in south - north direction .",
    "this setup provided a spectral resolution @xmath18 as measured from comparison spectra .",
    "the observations of set b spectra with a resolution of @xmath19 were performed with a grating of 600 @xmath17 and a slit of 2.5  oriented in south - north direction .",
    "the blazed wavelengths were 6000  and 5400  in set a and b spectra , respectively .",
    "generally , the setup in set a provided a wavelength coverage of 3800 - 8700  in observed frame .",
    "this attempt covered both h@xmath4 and h@xmath2 region in a single exposure in almost all set a spectra , except objects cso409 , 3c351 and 3c48.0 , because of their large redshifts . on the other hand , only h@xmath4 region , from 4200  to 6600  in observed frame , was covered in set b spectra .",
    "exposure time was generally between 600 - 3600 seconds depending on the brightness of the object . in a majority of the observations ,",
    "each object was exposed successively twice .",
    "the two frames were combined prior to extraction to enhance the s / n ratio and eliminate the contamination of cosmic - ray easily . the wavelength calibration associated with each object",
    "was carried out by helium - neon - argon comparison arcs obtained at the position being nearly identical to that of particular object .",
    "two or three kpno standard stars ( massey et al . 1988 ) were observed per night both for performing flux calibration and for the removal of atmospherical absorption features .",
    "all the objects were observed as close to meridian as possible .    in our final spectral data set , we find that the spectra of five out of 59 objects are contaminated strongly by spectra of their host galaxies .",
    "in addition , there were no obvious broad h@xmath4 component ( with no or very faint h@xmath2 ) in other four objects .",
    "these 9 objects are finally excluded from our spectral measurements and from finally statistical analyses .",
    "the log of observations of remaining 50 objects is given in table 1 .",
    "the unprocessed frames were reduced in standard procedures using iraf package .",
    "the ccd reductions included bias subtraction , flatfield correction , and cosmic - ray removal before sign extraction .",
    "one - dimensional sky - subtracted spectra were wavelength and flux calibrated .",
    "for each of the standard stars , the observed flux at wavelength 5000  was compared to its absolute flux .",
    "this procedure roughly yields that the uncertainty of the flux calibration is generally no larger than 20% .",
    "the galactic extinctions were corrected by color excess , parameter e(b - v ) from ned , assuming an @xmath20 extinction law ( cardelli et al .",
    "the spectra were transformed to rest frame , along with k - correction , according to the narrow peak of h@xmath4 .",
    "it was long time to be known that the contamination of the feii complex is a complicating factor in measuring strength and profile of particular emission lines such as h@xmath4 , [ oiii]@xmath214959,5007 and heii@xmath224686 . in order to reliably measure line properties and to determine the strength of the feii blends it is necessary to appropriately model the feii complex .",
    "the generally accepted model is the empirical template of the feii complex described in bg92 .",
    "the feii template is the optical feii emission in izw1 , a bright nls1 being of strong and narrow permitted feii emission ( phillips 1978 ; oke & lauer 1979 ; veron - cetty et al .",
    "briefly , the template is a two - dimensional function of line width ( fwhm ) and intensity of the feii blends .",
    "the same method described in bg92 was adopted in our measurements .",
    "the whole template is broadened to the fwhm of the broad component of h@xmath4 line by convolving with a gaussian profile and scaled to match the line intensity .",
    "usually , the contribution of the feii complex around h@xmath4 can be well removed in terms of this template .",
    "the best subtraction of the feii complex is derived by searching in the parameter space and producing a slick continuum at blue of h@xmath4 and between 5100  and 5500  after the subtraction .",
    "the flux of the feii complex is measured between the rest wavelength 4434  and 4684  as in bg92 .",
    "the schemes of the feii subtraction in two typical cases 3c48.0 and iizw1 are illustrated in figure 1 . in each panel , the observed spectrum and resulting feii - subtracted spectrum are displayed by the upper and middle curves , respectively .",
    "note that the observed spectra are offset upward arbitrarily for visibility .",
    "the best adopted feii templates are shown by bottom curves .",
    "the feii - contamination subtracted spectra are used to measure the non - feii properties .",
    "the first step in the processing of the spectra is to remove the continuum from each object .",
    "the continuum is fitted by a power - law to the regions which seemed to be uncontaminated by emission lines .",
    "the two selected strong emission - line free windows are generally from @xmath224500 to @xmath224600 and between 5100-5500 .",
    "there are two parameters in determining each continuum component , i.e. , the flux and the slope .    in our study ,",
    "the observed line profiles are reproduced by a single gaussian component and/or by a set of several gaussian components because of their simplicity and practicability ( xu et al .",
    "2003 ; evans 1988 ; rodriguez - ardila et al .",
    "the line profiles are modelled and measured by specfit task ( kriss 1996 ) in iraf package .",
    "the fitting is persisted until the minimum of @xmath23 , the measurement of goodness of profiling , is achieved . in each spectrum ,",
    "the line profiles are modelled as follows .",
    "1 ) each of the forbidden lines [ oiii]@xmath214959,5007 are modelled by a single gaussian component .",
    "the atomic relationships , @xmath24 ( storey & zeippen 2001 ) and @xmath25 , are used to reduce the number of free parameters and to improve the reliability of fitting procedure .",
    "2 ) the profile modelling of h@xmath4 line is straightforward in the spectra of objects of intermediate type .",
    "each h@xmath4 profile is modelled by a set of two gaussian components : a narrow and a broad gaussian components .",
    "the broad component of h@xmath4 is referred as h@xmath3 and is considered as representative of the broad line region ( blr ) .",
    "the narrow component is referred as h@xmath1 .",
    "this adopted procedure accords with the generally accepted unified model of agn in which the narrow and broad h@xmath4 components are emitted from nlr and blr , respectively .",
    "the distribution of ratio between fwhm(h@xmath1 ) and fwhm([oiii ] ) ( both with instrumental resolution correction , see  3.1 for details ) is illustrated in figure 3 .",
    "a statistical analysis indicates that this ratio has a mean value of 1.26 and a standard deviation of 0.57 .",
    "it is noted that there are a few objects in which a distinct narrow component is invisible in our sample .",
    "the interpretation of the profile de - composition should be careful , although the observed profile can be fitted with two gaussian component adequately .",
    "detailed examination of the results suggests that the flux of narrow h@xmath4 is generally overestimated because the fwhm(h@xmath1 ) is much large than that of [ oiii ] line ( e.g. 5 objects with fwhm(h@xmath1)/fwhm([oiii])@xmath262.0 ) . for these cases",
    ", we set the h@xmath1 is unavailable and set the total h@xmath4 flux as h@xmath3 ( see also in wang et al .",
    "2005 , zheng et al .",
    "as described in bg92 , the contribution of narrow component is rarely more than 3% of total h@xmath4 flux , even when there is a distinct narrow h@xmath4 emission .",
    "the modelling described above works well in most objects except in a few cases , for example the objects 3c390.3 and mark509 .",

    "2003 ) . to measure the broad h@xmath4 emission of 3c390.3 , we employ two separated broad gaussian components to reproduce the observed double - peaked profile . in 3c390.3",
    ", the flux of h@xmath4 broad component includes the contributions of both broad gaussian profiles . in mark509 , a very broad h@xmath4 component ( @xmath27 )",
    "must be acquired to reproduce the observed profile .",
    "generally , the very broad emission line region ( vblr , @xmath28 ) is suggested to be optically thin to balmer ionizing continuum and located at the inner edge of classical blr ( e.g. corbin 1997a , b ; brotherton & wills 1994 ; kuraszkiewicz et al .",

    "these authors suggested that the wing of h@xmath4 line are dominated by emission from optically thin vblr .",
    "moreover , the existence of vblr is also supported by the observation of very broad and boxy profile of high ionized emission lines such as heii@xmath224686 ( marziani et al .",

    "( 2003 ) and contamination of starburst .",
    "it is noted that an eigenvector is always specific to a certain sample depending on which observed parameters have been used and the range of parameters",
    ". there is , therefore , no one `` eigenvector 1 '' for every agn sample . in our infrared - selected seyfert 1.5 galaxies sample ,",
    "the eigenvector 1 is dominated by mid - infrared color @xmath0 .",
    "the most prominent correlations indicates the trends for objects with `` cold '' mid - infrared color to have small flux ratio [ oiii]/h@xmath1 , small ew(h@xmath3 ) , low luminosity of [ oiii ] , and large value of rfe .",
    "the understanding of role of the infrared color @xmath0 is not straightforward .",
    "generally , the infrared color @xmath0 allows us to determine the relative importance of agn - activity and starburst - activity in a galaxy .",
    "low et al . ( 1988 ) pointed out that in many cases agns display a warmer dust than do starforming regions .",
    "this warmer dust is heated by an additional heating caused by an intense radiation emitted from the nucleus , and strongly influence the mid - infrared flux at 25@xmath8 m .",
    "de grijp et al .",
    "( 1985 ) reported that the infrared color @xmath2(60,25 ) can be used as an efficient parameter to discriminate agn and starburst activity in the nuclear and circumnuclear regions of galaxies .",

    "they found that the agns have on average a warmer infrared color than starbursts .",
    "hao et al.(2005 ) indicated that the infrared selected qsos with significant far - ir excess contributed by starburst have smaller color index @xmath53 .",
    "as additional evidence , gonzalez delgado et al .",

    ".    the far - infrared color - color diagram has been generally used as an efficient tool to discriminate between different types of activity in the nuclear and circumnuclear starforming region of galaxies . as an additional test",
    ", the iras infrared color - color diagram is shown in figure 9 . in the same diagram ,",
    "the power - law line is also indicated .",
    "the agn and starburst loci are shown by short and long dashed lines , respectively .",
    "the agn locus is adopted from canalizo & stockton ( 2001 ) , and the starburst locus from lipari ( 1994 , and references therein ) .",
    "the size of each point is proportional to the projection on eigenvector 1 of the corresponding object .",
    "it is noted from figure 9 that the objects with small projection on eigenvector 1 are mainly located in qso / seyfert region , while the objects showing large projection are distributed in / near the starburst region .",
    "some comments on the objects located in / near the starburst region are discussed more detailed as follows :    * _ 3c48.0 , this object displays morphological evidence for a recent merger event with a likely double nuclei and a tidal tail extending several arcseconds ( canalizo & stockton 2000 , stockton & ridgway 1991 , chatzichristou et al . 1999 ) .",
    "very young stellar populations were suggested in the second nucleus about 1 northeast of the qso ( canalizo & stockton 2000 ) .",
    "recent near infrared observations of the second nucleus indicated the presence of warm dust that is likely heated by starbursts or ongoing starformation ( zuther et al .",
    "_ * _ ngc3227 , this object is a nearby seyfert galaxy interacting with a gas - poor companion . a clear 3.3@xmath8 m polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) emission feature , which is usually associated with starformation activity , was identified in its inner 60pc ( @xmath64 , rodriguez - ardila & viegas 2003 ) .",
    "these authors also observed another two objects : mark766 and 1h1934 - 063 that are listed in our sample . in mark766 ,",
    "the pah feature has been detected as well ( @xmath65 ) , while no evidence for pah feature has been observed in 1h1934 - 063 ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "the position of 1h1934 - 063 in the color - color diagram is indicated by an open star . as a first inspection ,",
    "both ngc3227 and mark766 have much cooler @xmath0 than does 1h1934 - 063 . _ * _ ngc7469 , this object is an luminous infrared source .",
    "its circumnuclear ( 1.5 - 2.5 ) ring structure has been observed at radio , optical , near - infrared , and mid - infrared bands ( see references in davies , tacconi & genzel 2004 ) . using the 2.3@xmath8 m co 2 - 0 absorption and continuum slope , davies , tacconi & genzel ( 2004 ) resolved the nuclear star cluster ( 0.15 - 0.20 ) and found that the age of the cluster is less than about 60 myr . _ * _ mark732 , cid fernandes et al . ( 1998 ) obtained the spatial resolved long slit spectra of this object .",
    "circumnuclear young stellar features are identified in the spectrum of region being north - east of the nucleus ( 4 away from the nucleus ) .",
    "_    in summary , in our ir - selected agn sample , the eigenvector 1 not only holds the correlations appeared in bg92 s e1 , but also first extends the well - documented e1 space into infrared color @xmath2(60 , 25 ) and ratio [ oiii]/h@xmath1 .",
    "this extension suggests that the e1 relates with nuclear starformation history , and that the e1 can be interpreted as `` age '' of agn as suggested by grupe ( 2004 ) .",
    "when the eigenvector 1 increases , agn with larger rfe tends to co - existent with relatively young stellar populations .",
    "both observational evidence and theoretical scenario indicate that starburst is a key piece of the agn machinery through evolutionary processes .",
    "the understanding of co - existence of agn and star formation in their host galaxies is accumulating .",
    "powerful circumnuclear starbursts ( @xmath67gyr ) have been unambiguously identified in @xmath6840% of nearby seyfert 2 galxies by several optical spectroscopic investigations of moderately large samples of type 2 seyfert nuclei ( e.g. joguet et al.2001 ; gonzalez delgado , heckman & leitherer 2001 ; cid fernandes et al .",
    "2001 , storchi - bergman et al . 2001 ) .",
    "gonzalez delgado ( 2002 ) summarized the evidence in favor of the co - existence of agn and starburst activity by showing the observations at optical and near - infrared band .",
    "theoretical studies also provided a plausible picture about the co - evolution of agn and circumnuclear starburst ( e.g. granato et al . 2004 ) . in the early phase of agn development",
    ", the star - formation rate is high , which means there are plenty of gases that can be attracted into the nucleus of galaxy under the gravitation of the central black hole .",
    "these gases are ultimately accreted onto black hole and lead to a high accretion rate . at latter phase , the accretion rate decreases because of the diminishing of content of gas .",
    "pca is a quantitative method for replacing a group of variables with a new variable .",
    "this group of variables might be generally measuring the same driving principle .",
    "generally , the ratio [ oiii]/h@xmath1 ( and also @xmath42([oiii ] ) ) is orientation independent because both lines are emitted only from optically thin region at large enough distance from the nucleus to be unobscured by the material causing the anisotropy in the featureless nuclear continuum and in the broad lines ( jackson et al .",
    "the isotropy of [ oiii ] line emission has been questioned by some studies of radio - loud agns ( baker 1997 ; di serego alighieri et al .",
    "however , the correlation between [ oiii ] and orientation independent [ oii ] emission indicates that the [ oiii ] emission is not dependent on orientation effect ( kuraszkiewicz 2000 ) .",
    "the mid - far - infrared color is also a nominally unbiased isotropic property .",
    "it is a reasonable first approximation , although this may not be strictly true if the torus is optically thick in the mid - infrared ( e.g. pier & krolik 1992 ; granato & danese 1994 ) . on the basis of these results ,",
    "it is not likely that the correlations in our eigenvector 1 is only due to the orientation effect .    at present",
    ", the e1 is mostly interpreted as governed by @xmath6 ( e.g. boroson 2002 ; grupe 2004 ) .",
    "it is , therefor , reasonable to expect that our eigenvector 1 is most possibly driven by @xmath6 as well .",
    "the parameter rfe is usually considered as a good tracer of @xmath6 ( bg92 ; boroson 2002 ; marziani et al .",
    "2001 ; zamanov & marziani 2002 , netzer et al . 2004 ) and scales with @xmath6 as @xmath69 ( marziani et al .",
    "if so , the anti - correlation between rfe and mid - far - infrared color @xmath2(60,25 ) possibly reveals a linkage between @xmath6 and nuclear starformation history , and that @xmath6 is large in agn with relatively strong starburst - activity ( e.g. hao et al .",
    "2005 ) . in order to test this scenario , @xmath6 and black hole mass",
    "are necessary to be calculated .",
    "this calculation is , however , not convincing in our seyfert 1.5 sample , because of the influence of orientation effect which obscures a large fraction of continuum emitting from the central engine .",
    "the role of @xmath6 will be tested in the next work by a larger sample of type i agn .",
    "on the basis of above discussions , we further conjecture that the correlation between rfe and @xmath2(60,25 ) implies an evolutionary trace of seyfert galaxies and qsos .",
    "cid fernandes et al .",
    "( 2001 ) speculated that the composite starburst plus seyfert 2 nucleus system evolve into pure seyfert 2 galaxies .",
    "as analogue with the evolutionary scenario of ultra infrared luminous galaxies ( uligs ) suggested by sanders et al .",
    "( 1988 ; see also in hao et al .",
    "2005 and references therein ) , we suspect that the `` cold '' seyfert galaxies possibly evolve into `` warm '' seyfert galaxies .      as shown in  3.2 , both our sample and the sample in xu et al .",
    "( 2003 ) show that the seyfert galaxies are not uniformly populated in the digram plotted as [ oiii]/h@xmath1 vs. rfe .",
    "we note that there are significant number of objects with very small [ oiii]/h@xmath1 for the sample of xu et al .",
    "this phenomenon , however , does not appear in our sample .",
    "these very low [ oiii]/h@xmath1 might be caused by the overestimate of h@xmath1 component as described in  1 .",
    "( 2003 ) speculated that the anti - correlation between [ oiii]/h@xmath1 and rfe is mainly driven by density effect .",
    "although this explanation can not be proved or excluded by our analysis in current data set , we propose that the contamination of starforming can also be a possible interpretation .",
    "in fact , as shown in  3.1 , both [ oiii]/h@xmath1 and rfe are tightly correlated with @xmath0 . when rfe is large , the increased relative importance of starburst could reduce the observed value of [ oiii]/h@xmath1 .",
    "the detection of [ oiii ] velocity shift is difficult to be doubted for following two reasons : 1 ) in a majority of cases , the resulting wavelength accuracy is better than 1 .",
    "the corresponding uncertainty of velocity is less than @xmath70 ; 2 ) the narrow components of h@xmath4 can be modelled accurately because of the apparent profile inflection .",
    "zamanov et al .",
    "( 2002 ) found that the large [ oiii ] blueshift relative to h@xmath1 ( @xmath71)>250\\ \\rm{km\\ s^{-1}}$ ] ) is confined to sources with @xmath72 .",
    "these authors interpreted the large blueshift of [ oiii ] with respect to h@xmath1 as a result of outflow whose origin is considered to be strong radiation pressure due to large @xmath73 .",
    "their purely kinematical model suggested that the [ oiii]@xmath225007 blueshifts are associated with the high - ionization outflow generated in objects with high accretion rate .",
    "many theoretical studies suggested that a high @xmath6 is prefer to result in strong mass outflow .",
    "king & pounds ( 2003 ) proposed a model in which winds in quasars are probably produced when the black holes accrete at or above the eddington limit .",
    "the dynamical model of accretion disk wind indicates that the vertical outflow ratio strongly depends on the accretion rate .",
    "the magnitude of outflow increases significantly with the accretion rate , assuming a constant viscosity parameter ( witt , czerny & zycki 1997 ) .",
    "the simplest , and mostly possible , interpretation of the correlation between [ oiii ] shift amplitude @xmath74})$ ] and rfe is , therefore , that we are clear seeing a dynamical linkage between the outflow of emission material and central accretion power in terms of a relatively strong wind arising from the central region of agn .",
    "this paper presents the statistical study of optical emission - line properties of a sample of 50 seyfert 1.5 galaxies .",
    "the line properties are compared with their continuum properties in infrared wavelength to extend the documented e1 relationships into infrared property of agn . the statistical analysis allows us to draw following conclusions :    1 .",
    "we first extend the e1 relationships into infrared color @xmath0 and flux ratio [ oiii]/h@xmath1 .",
    "in addition to confirm the bg92 s e1 , the pca analysis indicates that our eigenvector 1 is dominated by mid - far - infrared color @xmath2(60,25 ) .",
    "the color @xmath2(60,25 ) is found to be strongly anti - correlated with rfe ( @xmath75 ) , and correlated with ew(h@xmath4 ) ( @xmath76 ) , [ oiii]/h@xmath1 ( @xmath77 ) , and @xmath42([oiii ] ) ( @xmath78 ) .",
    "the eigenvector 1 is inferred to increase with relative importance of starburst with respect to agn activity , and to be , therefore , related with nuclear starformation history .",
    "we further suspect that a `` cold '' seyfert galaxy perhaps evolves into a `` warm '' one .",
