    "a higgs boson was discovered at the lhc .",
    "further measurements at the lhc have revealed its properties , such as its mass , spin - parity , and couplings to the standard model ( sm ) particles . at the present experimental precision",
    ", it seems quite consistent with the higgs boson in the sm .",
    "the determination of the whole structure of the higgs sector is an important task at future experiments , since various kinds of the higgs sector are predicted in models for the physics beyond the sm ( bsm ) . to explore the whole structure of the higgs sector at collider experiments , two major approaches have been considered ; the direct searches of second , third and even more higgs bosons , and the indirect searches of the bsm effects through the deviations in the observed higgs boson properties by precision measurements .",
    "in general , it is argued that the direct searches are performed at the energy frontier experiments , such as the lhc , and the indirect searches are performed at the precision frontier experiments , such as the international linear collider  ( ilc )  @xcite . in this talk , we discuss the direct searches of additional higgs bosons at the ilc  @xcite in addition to the lhc , and their complementarity .",
    "we consider the two higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) as a benchmark model of the extended higgs sector .",
    "especially , we focus on the heavy ( neutral ) higgs bosons which predominantly decay into a @xmath1 pair resulting multi - top - quarks events as a signal of such higgs bosons .",
    "we study the discovery potential of such events at the lhc and the ilc , and compare the parameter regions to be explored by the searches at these experiments .",
    "we find that the parameter regions to be explored at the lhc and the ilc are different , therefore , searches at the two experiments are complementary to survey the wider parameter regions in the extended higgs sector .",
    "we consider the 2hdm as a benchmark model of the extended higgs sector .",
    "the model has various phenomenologically plausible features , such that the electroweak rho parameter is preserved to be unity at the tree - level ; sources of additional @xmath2 phases are provided ; and additional four higgs bosons are predicted . under the assumption of the @xmath2 invariance in the higgs sector for simplicity , these can be identified as @xmath2-even @xmath3 , @xmath2-odd @xmath4 , and a pair of charged @xmath5 , in addition to the lighter @xmath2-even @xmath6 which can be identified as the higgs boson discovered at the lhc with the mass of @xmath7  gev .",
    "flavour changing neutral currents whose existence is experimentally severely constrained can be avoided at the tree level by imposing the softly - broken @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "yukawa interactions of additional higgs bosons to the sm fermion are given as @xmath8\\nonumber\\\\ & + \\left\\ { \\frac{\\sqrt{2}v_{ud}}{v}\\bar{u}\\left[m_u\\xi_a^u{\\rm p}_l + m_d\\xi_a^d{\\rm p}_r\\right]dh^+ +   \\frac{\\sqrt{2}m_\\ell}{v}\\xi_a^\\ell\\overline{\\nu_l}\\ell_rh^+ + { \\rm h.c . }",

    ", there are four kinds of the model for the yukawa interactions , depending on the assignment of the fermion parity under the @xmath0 symmetry , namely , type - i , type - ii , type - x and type - y .",
    "detail expressions for the scaling factors in each type of yukawa interactions can be found , e.g. , in ref .",
    "@xcite . for any type of yukawa interactions , couplings of the additional higgs boson",
    "to top quarks are enhanced for small @xmath14 .",
    "thus , the signatures for such parameter regions can be heavy higgs bosons which dominantly decay into top quarks .",
    "therefore , the searches for the multi - top - quarks events can be a new signals of additional higgs bosons in future collider experiments .",
    "first , we study multi - top - quarks production at the lhc through the production of additional higgs boson(s ) .",
    "the process with largest cross section is expected to be @xmath15 since it occurs via the strong interaction .",
    "the other process can be pair production of @xmath3 and @xmath4 , @xmath16 followed by the decays of @xmath3 and @xmath4 into top quarks , and also the associated production of @xmath5 and @xmath3(a ) , which subsequently decay into @xmath17(@xmath18 ) and @xmath1 @xmath19 resulting three top - quarks plus one bottom - quark final - states .",
    "the hadronic cross sections for the above processes can be predicted in perturbative qcd , and by multiplying the branching ratios of additional higgs bosons into top quarks , expected number of events can be estimated  @xcite .",
    "the cross sections of the production of a pair of additional higgs bosons , ( [ eq : ha ] ) and ( [ eq : hhp ] ) , do not depend on @xmath14 , but that of the process ( [ eq : tth ] ) does through the top yukawa coupling .",
    "the largest cross sections are realized for the mass of additional higgs bosons at around 350  gev . below this value ,",
    "the branching ratio into @xmath1 is suppressed because one of the top quarks is forced to be off - shell , while above that value the production cross sections of additional higgs bosons decrease . for @xmath20 ,",
    "the cross section of the four top - quarks production can be at most 6  fb ( 50  fb ) for the lhc 8  tev ( 14  tev ) .",
    "the cms collaboration has set the limit on the cross section at 8  tev as @xmath21  fb at the 95% cl ( confidence level )  @xcite , by observing the lepton plus multi - jets events .",
    "on the other hand , the sm prediction to the four top - quarks production at the lhc 8  tev is about 1  fb .",
    "therefore , the limit is not enough to constrain the parameter regions in the 2hdm .",
    "we study the prospect of measuring four top - quarks production by the production of additional higgs bosons at the lhc with the collision energy of 14  tev in the 2hdm .",
    "the total cross section within the sm is estimated to be @xmath22  fb with @xmath23  fb  @xcite .",
    "we follow the signal - to - background analysis in ref .  @xcite . in their analysis ,",
    "the background rate of @xmath24  fb is obtained with the signal efficiency of @xmath25 . by taking into account the statistical and systematical uncertainties for the signal , sm and background processes , the accuracy of measuring the signal cross section @xmath26",
    "can be estimated to be @xmath27 where @xmath28 denotes the systematic uncertainty of the background rate which is taken to be @xmath29 in our analysis . by solving eq .",
    "( [ eq : acc ] ) , we find that the signal total cross section @xmath26 greater than 25  fb ( 63  fb ) is required to achieve @xmath30 ( 0.2 ) with the integrated luminosity of @xmath31  fb@xmath32 . in our setup , the total uncertainty is dominated by the systematic uncertainty from the background .",

    "[ fig : lhc4top ] , we show the parameter regions in which the additional higgs bosons contribution can be detected in the four top - quarks events at the @xmath33 and @xmath35 cl in the type - ii and type - x 2hdm .",
    "the dependence on the type of yukawa interactions is small .",
    "we find that only @xmath36 regions can be probed at the @xmath33 cl at most .",
    "since these regions are constrained by flavor experiments , the lhc searches in the four top - quarks events may not have significant impact on exploring the parameter regions in the 2hdms .",
    "second , we consider the multi - top - quarks production at the ilc . in the 2hdm , the four top - quarks final - state is generated via the pair production of @xmath3 and @xmath4 , @xmath37 which is kinematically accessible for @xmath38 , and via the single production of @xmath3 or @xmath4  @xcite , @xmath39 which is allowed even in the case with @xmath40 .",
    "the @xmath41 pair production cross section does not depend on @xmath14 at the tree level , and thus the four top - quarks production rate depends on @xmath14 only through the decay branching ratio of @xmath3 and @xmath4 . on the other hand ,",
    "the single production process can be increased by the enhanced yukawa coupling of @xmath3 and @xmath4 to top quarks  @xcite .",
    "we perform a simulation analysis on four top - quarks production at the ilc .",
    "the sm backgrounds processes , such as @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 are taken into account .",
    "the sm four top - quarks production cross section is negligibly small .",
    "our simulation analysis includes the decay of top quarks , qcd showering , hadronization , jet clustering , flavor tagging , detector acceptance and momentum resolution effects , etc  @xcite .",
    "we make use of the designed detector performance at the ilc experiment  @xcite .    through the decay of top quarks",
    ", the four top - quarks events can be observed in all - hadronic , single lepton plus jets plus missing momentum , dilepton plus jets plus missing , trilepton plus jets plus missing , tetralepton plus jets plus missing channels . in principle , optimal selection cuts may be constructed for each channel . however , in this work , we propose an inclusive analysis which take into account all the channels at once for simplicity . to extract the signal events out of the sm background ,",
    "we impose following selection cuts ; ( i ) small thrust , @xmath45 , ( ii ) @xmath46 , and ( iii ) large multiplicity of hard objects , @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the sum of the number of isolated leptons ( @xmath49 and @xmath50 ) and the number of hadronic @xmath51-jets , @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) is a number of @xmath54-tagged ( light - flavor ) jets in a event .",
    "the event distributions of the signal and background processes in the kinematical variables used for the selection cuts as well as the background reduction and signal detection efficiencies can be found in ref .",
    "we obtain that the signal events can be extracted with the detection efficiency of 40 - 50% depending on the mass of additional higgs bosons , while only about 50  ab of the background events is remained .",
    "the accessible value of the total cross section is evaluated to be 0.034 - 0.048  fb ( 0.11 - 0.15  fb ) at the @xmath33 ( @xmath35 ) cl , depending on the mass of additional higgs bosons .",
    "we evaluate the parameter regions in the 2hdms where the four top - quarks events can be detected at the ilc 1  tev run with the integrated luminosity of 1  ab@xmath32 .",
    "we take into account the statistical uncertainties only , since the systematical ones can be expected to be well under control at lepton colliders . in fig .",
