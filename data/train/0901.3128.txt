    "the simplest process leading to unstable universal patterns is _ laplacian growth _",

    "we examine the simplest example of laplacian growth : quasi - two - dimensional ( 2d ) viscous fingering in a hele - shaw cell @xcite , where a viscous fluid is displaced by an inviscid fluid between two horizontal closely spaced parallel plates .",
    "figure [ fig : fig1 ] shows four viscous fingering patterns grown in the radial hele - shaw cell described in section  [ sec : experiment ] . viscous silicone oil is removed from a buffer surrounding the plates and air enters between the plates through a central hole in the bottom plate .",

    "because the air is nearly inviscid , the pressure in the air is essentially uniform , and its value can be taken as zero .",
    "thus the pressure jump across the oil / air interface coincides with the oil pressure at the interface and is given by @xcite    @xmath11    where @xmath12 is surface tension and @xmath13 is the local curvature of the interface in the horizontal plane .",
    "( an updated boundary condition including a @xmath14 multiplicative factor and an additional term correcting for wetting will be presented in section [ subsec : theorywetting ] . )",

    "interior moments , which are relevant for interior laplacian growth when a viscous fluid is inside the interface , are defined similarly , but with positive powers of @xmath22 under the integral , which is taken over the interior of the pattern .",
    "harmonic moments are of fundamental importance for laplacian growth because in the absence of surface tension , there is an infinite number of conservation laws : all moments @xmath23 ( except for @xmath24 = 0 ) are _ conserved in time _",

    "the conservation laws have been extended to the exterior case @xcite and are experimentally confirmed in this work . in the harmonic moments",

    "the origin of harmonic moments dates back to isaac newton s study of the inverse potential problem , which was subsequently investigated by kelvin , poincar and many researchers in the twentieth century .",
    "the inverse potential problem @xcite asks how to recover the shape of a domain occupied by a uniformly distributed mass , given the gravitational potential created by this mass outside the domain .",
    "surprisingly , this classical mathematical problem was found to be at the heart of the underlying mathematical structure of laplacian growth @xcite . in two dimensions",

    ", the moments are defined as @xmath43 .",
    "this geometry is relevant for laplacian growth in a rectangular hele - shaw channel , which has been studied since the work by saffman and taylor @xcite .      in science and engineering",
    "it is often of interest to find the shape of an object from the indirect measurement of the harmonic moments @xmath23 .",
    "the problem of domain reconstruction from its moments has applications in many areas , including signal processing , probability and statistics , tomography , and the inverse potential problem in geophysics ( magnetic and gravitational anomaly detection ) @xcite . while the recovery of shapes from moments is often an ill - posed problem , it was recently recognized that the moments problem allows the complete closed form solution for so - called quadrature domains @xcite , a branch of mathematics created in 1970s @xcite .",
    "remarkably , these solutions are based on a technique of numerical _ linear _ algebra that yields numerically stable and fast algorithms and exposes a deep connection between harmonic moments and a theory of analytic approximation @xcite .",
    "in laplacian growth with nonzero surface tension the harmonic moments are no longer conserved . to relate the dynamics of the harmonic moments to measurable quantities in viscous fingering",
    ", we now obtain an expression for the time derivative of the harmonic moments in terms of a line integral over the air / oil interface .",
    "the time derivative of @xmath23 follows from the definition ( [ eq : moments ] ) and ( [ eqdarcy ] ) : @xmath45 we want to exchange the derivative between @xmath46 and @xmath47 , so we add and subtract @xmath48 from the integrand ,    @xmath49    here @xmath50 is the arc length along the interface @xmath21 .",

    "surface tension is now a regular rather than a singular perturbation .",
    "the pressure jump at the interface ( [ eqpsk ] ) must be modified because as the air bubble advances between the glass plates , it leaves behind a wetting film on each plate .",
    "the thickness of this film increases with the interface s velocity @xcite .",
    "this film can be seen as interference fringes on the images in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] , because the interface is slowing down as the bubble expands .",
    "in addition , a factor @xmath63 is needed in ( [ eqpsk ] ) .",

    "the thickness of the film predicted by park and homsy was experimentally confirmed by tabeling and libchaber @xcite for @xmath65 .",

    "alternatively , we can use the theory to determine a fluid property if the other four quantities are independently known .",
    "this is the way in which we determine the surface tension in section v. however , since numerical differentiation of the data for @xmath68 is difficult to do accurately , we take one more step to obtain a working equation with improved signal to noise : equation ( [ workingequation ] ) is integrated over a time interval to obtain    @xmath70",

    "an oil layer is contained in a hele - shaw cell consisting of two horizontal , closely spaced glass plates with a hole through the center of the bottom plate .",
    "when oil is pumped out of a buffer that surrounds the oil layer , air ( at nearly atmospheric pressure ) enters the layer through the hole in the bottom plate and forms a bubble in the center of the oil layer .",

    "the frame rate ranged from 1/6 to 2 frames / s , depending on the growth rate of a bubble .",
    "experiments were initiated by obtaining a nearly circular air bubble , grown by slowly withdrawing oil from the buffer surrounding the gap between the plates .",
    "after an initial nearly circular bubble had been grown to a radius of at least 2 cm ( to give good spatial resolution in the images ) , multi - fingered bubbles like those in fig . 1 were grown by using a precision computer - controlled syringe pump to remove oil from the annular buffer at a specified rate .",
    "growth of a full - sized bubble ( 15 - 20 cm diameter ) took from 30 to 1600 s ( typically 300 s ) .    after obtaining a nearly circular bubble ,",
    "a multi - fingered bubble can be obtained by pumping oil out of the buffer .",
    "usually fluid is removed at a fixed rate , as in our laboratory s previous viscous fingering experiments @xcite . however , with a fixed pumping rate , the @xmath35-fold mode that is the fastest growing changes with time , and the resultant bubble has many azimuthal modes with a substantial amplitude [ e.g. fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1](d ) ] .",
    "our procedure for obtaining the harmonic moments and deducing the surface tension is applicable for bubbles grown with _",
    "any _ pumping rate , @xmath82 .",
    "however , results for the harmonic moments are more robust if a bubble retains an approximate @xmath35-fold symmetry as it grows . to achieve this",
    ", the pumping rate must decrease in a way that maintains an approximate @xmath35-fold symmetry . a linear stability analysis by bataille @xcite provides an expression for the pumping rate needed to maintain the same @xmath35-fold perturbation of a circle as the fastest growing @xcite mode ,    @xmath83    where @xmath33 is the radius of the bubble .",

    "conventional pumping with constant @xmath16 would appear as a vertical trajectory in fig .",
    "[ fig : figq ] . for future experiments",
    "one should consider using park - homsy pressure jump , @xmath85 , instead of using bataille s assumption that @xmath86 .    the particular multi - fingered pattern that develops depends not only on pumping rate but also on initial perturbations and non - uniformities of the glass plates .",
    "in the early stages of the pattern growth , when a bubble begins to deviate from a circle , small unavoidable departures from the circular shape have a greater influence on the development of the interface than the accuracy of pumping or non - uniformities of the glass plates . in practice , we found the smallest @xmath87 achievable was 5 ; for smaller target @xmath87 the growth was too slow to overcome initial perturbations on the bubble s surface before the bubble reached the edge of the cell .",
    "we found that although the application of the bataille formula for small perturbations of a circular bubble is not justifiable for bubbles that have grown large fingers , in practice the bataille s expression remains helpful in maintaining a symmetrical target pattern .    the present work concerns bubbles that are growing throughout an experiment .",
    "if the pumping were stopped , the surface tension would begin to smooth the interfacial regions of high curvature , and an interface could even reverse direction , absorbing the wetting film it left behind .    in most viscous fingering experiments where oil is withdrawn at a constant rate ,",
    "the process has a natural separation of time scales : @xmath88 , determined by pumping rate , is usually much less than the `` capillary '' time , @xmath89 ( for not very high @xmath35 ) , which corresponds to smoothing of a pattern by surface tension . the difference between time scales ( @xmath90 ) makes possible the rich interfacial patterns .",
    "however , in our case there is only a single time scale because the pumping @xmath16 is adjusted continuously to maintain approximate @xmath35-fold symmetry . equating the scales @xmath91 , one recovers ( within a multiplicative factor that depends on @xmath35 ) the bataille formula .",

    "the oil / air interface in each image was first obtained by subtracting the background image , thresholding , and using an edge detection algorithm .",
    "this located the interface to within a pixel .",
    "the resolution of the interface was typically 50 pixels / cm , so that one pixel s length was about 0.2 mm .",
    "the position of each point on an interface was then obtained with sub - pixel accuracy by interpolating the location along a line perpendicular to the rough interface that was half of the intensity difference between the inside of the bubble ( more intense ) and the outside of the bubble ( less intense ) .",
    "the algorithm typically found a position of half - intensity to 0.1 pixel ( about 20 @xmath5 m , which is small compared to the 125 @xmath5 m or 384 @xmath5 m plate separation ) .",

    "further , we have obtained an equation for the dynamics of the harmonic moments , equation ( [ eq : finalint ] ) , which involves quantities that can all be directly determined by experiment , thus providing a quantitative test of the theory of harmonic moments .",
    "the result from measurements on 26 bubbles for two different hele - shaw cell gap thicknesses is that theory and experiment agree within the experimental uncertainty ( about 20% ) .",
    "this agreement was obtained both on nonsymmetric bubbles and on bubbles with approximate @xmath35-fold symmetries varying from 5 to 14 .",
    "this agreement is robust and , within our experiments , does not depend on how far a bubble has deviated from a circle .",
    "further , we have indicated how it should be straightforward to reduce the experimental uncertainty by an order of magnitude , to test the theory at about a 1% level .    for convenience",
    "we have used an expression obtained by bataille ( [ eq : bataille ] ) to adjust the pumping rate @xmath110 to grow bubbles that are approximately @xmath35-fold symmetric .",
    "we find that if an @xmath35-fold bubble is grown initially from a slightly perturbed circle , the @xmath35-fold symmetry is retained even for large amplitude fingers , far beyond range of applicability of ( [ eq : bataille ] ) , which was obtained from a linear stability analysis .",
    "harmonic moments @xmath23 form a complete basis for any complicated time domain @xmath20 , provided that @xmath20 is analytic and singly connected .",
    "these moments are exceptionally useful for laplacian growth phenomena such as viscous fingering because all other known representations involve coefficients that change quickly because of instability , thus creating analytic and computational difficulties . in contrast",
    ", harmonic moments are free of these problems , no matter how much the domain @xmath20 deviates from a circle . loosely speaking , for harmonic moments the whole instability is simply concentrated in the lowest one , @xmath27 ( the area of @xmath20 ) .    from a fundamental perspective , the moments @xmath23 for laplacian growth are exactly the basis that linearizes and `` solves '' the zero surface tension problem , generating a multitude of exact solutions ( summarized in @xcite ; see also references therein ) , which are impossible to obtain in any other basis . in this sense",
    "the harmonic moments constitute the most natural basis for laplacian growth .",
    "our experiments confirm that for nonzero surface tension , the derivative of the moments @xmath44 is simply proportional to @xmath12 ( neglecting the wetting correction ) , so that the zero surface tension limit is smoothly approached .",
    "this indicates that the fundamental theoretical results mentioned above , which have been obtained for laplacian growth theory for the case of zero surface tension , are relevant to real physical systems .    in conclusion ,",
    "the implications of the demonstration of the harmonic moments description of viscous fingering extends into various branches of mathematical physics ( cf . section ii ) because of the deep connection between laplacian growth and other problems .",
    "we thank olivier praud for developing the method for maintaining an approximate @xmath35-fold symmetry of a bubble ( section iv.b ) , and we thank dmitry leshchiner for helpful discussions .",
