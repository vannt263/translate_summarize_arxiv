    "the main aim of the series ` paris cosmology colloquia ' , in the framework of the international school of astrophysics * ` daniel chalonge ' * , is to put together real cosmological and astrophysical data and hard theory approach connected to them .",
    "the chalonge paris cosmology colloquia bring together physicists , astrophysicists and astronomers from the world over .",
    "each year these colloquia are more attended and appreciated both by phd students , post - docs and lecturers .",
    "the format of the colloquia is intended to allow easy and fruitful mutual contacts and communication .",
    "the subject of the 14th paris cosmology colloquium 2010 was ` the standard model of the universe : theory and observations ' .",
    "the colloquium took place during three full days ( thursday july 22 , friday 23 and saturday july 24 ) at the parisian campus of paris observatory ( hq ) , in the historic perrault building .",
    "the * 14th paris cosmology colloquium 2010 * was within the astrofundamental physics spirit of the chalonge school , focalized on recent observational and theoretical progress on the cmb and inflation with predictive power , dark matter , dark energy , dark ages and lss in the context of the standard model of the universe .",
    "never as in this period , the golden age of cosmology , the major subjects of the daniel chalonge school were so timely and in full development : the wmap mission released in 2010 the new survey ( 7 years of observations ) and the planck mission launched in may 2009 is performing its first survey .",
    "the * main topics * were : observational and theoretical progress in deciphering the nature of dark matter , large and small scale structure , warm ( kev ) dark matter and sterile neutrinos .",
    "inflation after wmap ( in connection with the cmb and lss data ) , slow roll and fast roll inflation , quadrupole suppression and initial conditions .",
    "cmb polarization .",
    "cmb measurements by the planck mission and its science perspectives .",
    "all lectures were plenary and followed by a discussion .",
    "enough time was provided to the discussions .",

    "this paris colloquia series started in 1994 at the observatoire de paris .",
    "the series cover selected topics of high current interest in the interplay between cosmology and fundamental physics .",
    "the paris cosmology colloquia are informal meetings .",
    "their purpose is an updated understanding , from a fundamental point of view , of the progress and current problems in the early universe , cosmic microwave background radiation , large scale structure and neutrinos in astrophysics and the interplay between them .",
    "emphasis is given to the mutual impact of fundamental physics and cosmology , both at theoretical and experimental -or observational- levels .",
    "deep understanding , clarification , synthesis , a careful interdisciplinarity within a fundamental physics approach , are goals of this series of colloquia .",
    "sessions last for three full days and leave enough time for private discussions and to enjoy the beautiful parisian campus of observatoire de paris ( built on orders from colbert and to plans by claude perrault from 1667 to 1672 ) .",
    "sessions took place in the cassini hall , on the meridean of paris , in salle du conseil ( council room ) in the historic perrault building ( btiment perrault \" ) of observatoire de paris hq , under the portraits of laplace , le verrier , lalande , arago , delambre and louis xiv and in the grande galerie ( the great gallery ) .",
    "an * exhibition * retraced the 19 years of activity of the chalonge school and of george smoot participation to the school . the books and proceedings of the school since its creation , as well as historic daniel chalonge material , instruments and the daniel chalonge medal were on exhibition at the grande galerie .",

    "all these features can be quantitatively explained with the action of cosmic rays accelerated in the magnetic winds of very massive stars , when they explode ( biermann et al .",

    "while the leptonic part of these observations may be explainable with pulsars and their winds , the hadronic part clearly needs very massive stars , such as wolf - rayet stars , their winds and their explosions . what the cosmic ray work ( biermann et al",
    ". , from 1993 through 2010 ) shows , that allowing for the magnetic field topology of wolf rayet star winds ( see , e.g. parker 1958 apj ) , both the leptonic and the hadronic part get readily and quantitatively explained , close to what had been predicted , without any significant free parameter , so by occam s razor the wolf - rayet star wind proposal is much simpler .",

    "2008 aa does not apply for stars at near zero heavy elements , since such stars have weak winds .",
    "black holes in turn also merge , but in this manner start their mergers at masses of a few million solar masses ; the mass is given by the instability of stars at such a mass due to general relativity and radiation effects .",
    "this readily explains the supermassive black hole mass function as the result of mergers between black holes .",
    "the corresponding gravitational waves are not constrained by any existing limit , and could have given a substantial energy contribution at high redshift .",
    "our conclusion is that a right - handed neutrino of a mass of a few kev is the most interesting candidate to constitute dark matter",

    "structure formation proceeds in a hierarchical `` bottom up '' approach : small scales become non - linear and collapse first and their merger and accretion leads to structure on larger scales , dense clumps that survive the merger process form satellite galaxies .",

    ". simulations within the @xmath0cdm paradigm also yield a density profile in virialized ( dm ) halos that increases monotonically towards the center and features a cusp , such as the navarro - frenk - white ( nfw ) profile [ 2 ] .",
    "these density profiles accurately describe clusters of galaxies but there is an accumulating body of observational evidence [ 3,4 ] that suggest that the central regions of ( dm)-dominated dwarf spheroidal satellite ( dsphs ) galaxies feature smooth cores instead of cusps as predicted by ( cdm ) .",

    "a model independent analysis suggests that dark matter particles with a mass in the kev range is a suitable ( wdm ) candidate [ 7,8 ] , and sterile neutrinos with masses in the @xmath16 kev range are compelling ( wdm ) candidates [ 9,10 ] .",

    "this @xmath0cdm model describes structure formation at large scales very well , however it fails on small scales : the standard model predicts much more small scale structure than observed .",
    "the problem of @xmath0cdm overabundance on small mass scales has its origin in the mismatch between the faint end of the observational luminosity function and the mass function of the dm halos predicted by the @xmath0cdm model .",
    "numerically , the problem initially showed up as the `` missing satellites problem '' - strong excess of substructures in simulated milky way sized dm halos with respect to the observed number of dwarf galaxies in the local group ( lg ) ( klypin et al . , 2009 ) .",
    "more than 10 years of `` solving '' the problem has led to the statement that there should be many truly `` dark '' halos without stellar or gas components .",
    "but still none of the solutions became `` essential '' or `` concordant '' .",
    "for instance , in some recipes procedure of construction of lg satellites lf when accounting for sdss incompleteness assumes uniformity of missed dwarf galaxies population ( tollerud et al .",
    "2009 ) which is a very poor approximation for known and newly discovered dwarf lg population .",
    "tikhonov & klypin ( 2009 ) have found that the @xmath0cdm model exhibits the same problem concerning the problem of void dwarf galaxies .",
    "they found that in the @xmath0cdm model the minivoids are too small when compared to observations .",
    "our analysis led to the conclusion that the @xmath0cdm model fits the observational spectrum of minivoids defined by galaxies with @xmath235 assuming that these galaxies can contain only dm halos with circular velocities @xmath236 km / s ( which roughly corresponds to @xmath237 ) .",
    "this is a quite interesting result from the theoretical side - according to some estimates , halos with @xmath238km / s had essentially no gas infall and star formation inside them .",
    "the extrapolation of a ` common mass scale ' ( strigari et al . , 2008 ) for lg s dsphs points to a similar total mass of the smallest observable gravitationally bound systems in the universe containing dark matter .",
    "the problem ( for the @xmath0cdm model , not for nature ) is that about 100 of nearby dwarf galaxies with @xmath235 rotate slower than 35 km / s .",
    "there are some things special about dwarf isolated galaxies  most of them are old , they rotationally support thin disks and they produce stars right now .",
    "we have a small but nonnegligible collection of galaxies such as camelopardalisb , cgcg269 - 049 , ddo125 exhibiting regular rotation with maximum rotational velocities as low as 10 - 15km / s with clear indications of modern star formation .",

    "<S> inflation effective theory predicts negligible primordial non - gaussianity , negligible scalar index running and a tensor to scalar ratio @xmath1 at reach / border line of next cmb observations ; the present data with this theory clearly prefer new inflation ; early fast - roll inflation is generic and provides lowest multipoles depression . </S>",
    "<S> cmb secondary anisotropies progress rapidly with new cmb high-@xmath2 constraints and sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) amplitudes smaller than expected : cmb and x - ray data agree but intracluster medium models need revision ( they overestimate sz ) , relaxed and non - relaxed clusters need distinction as wmap7 shows.(ii ) the milky way is not formed from dsph - like systems . </S>",
    "<S> feedback does not operate as already suggested : it was extremely mild in the lowest luminosity galaxies , it does not substantially modify initial conditions . </S>",
    "<S> ( iii ) the cosmic ray positron and electron excess recently observed is explained by natural astrophysical processes , while annihilating / decaying dark matter models face growing tailoring to explain observations . </S>",
    "<S> ( iv ) cored ( non cusped ) dm halos and warm ( kev scale mass ) dm are increasingly favored from theory and astrophysical observations , they naturally produce the observed small scale structures ; sterile neutrinos are suitable candidates . </S>",
    "<S> wimps ( heavier than 1 gev ) are strongly disfavoured combining theory with galaxy observations . putting all together , </S>",
    "<S> evidence that @xmath0cdm does not work at small scales is staggering . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0wdm simulations with 1 kev particles reproduce observations , sizes of local minivoids and velocity functions . overall </S>",
    "<S> , kev scale dm particles deserve dedicated searchs and simulations . </S>",
