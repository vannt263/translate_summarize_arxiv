    "with the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _",
    "khz qpos have been discovered in about 20 neutron star lmxbs ( see van der klis @xcite for a review ) . in many cases , two simultaneous khz peaks ( @xmath0 hz )",
    "are observed in the power spectra of the x - ray count rate variations , with the separation frequency @xmath1 roughly constant ( e.g. , strohmayer et al .",
    "@xcite ; ford et al .",
    "@xcite ; wijnands et al .",
    "sometimes a third khz peak is detected in a few atoll sources during type i x - ray bursts at a frequency @xmath2 equal to the separation frequency @xmath1 of the two peaks or twice that ( see strohmayer , swank , & zhang @xcite for a review ) .",
    "these two results suggest that a beat - frequency mechanism is at work , with the upper khz peak at the keplerian orbital frequency at the inner edge of the accretion disk around the neutron star , the third peak at the neutron star spin frequency ( or twice that ) , and the lower khz peak at the difference frequency between them ( strohmayer et al .",
    "@xcite ; miller , lamb , & psaltis @xcite ) .    within the beat - frequency model",
    ", the burst oscillations @xmath2 and the khz peak separations @xmath1 are both believed to be close to the neutron star spin frequency and thus @xmath1 should remain constant .",
    "however , recent observations have challenged this interpretation : in sco x-1 ( van der klis et al .",
    "@xcite ) , 4u 1608 - 52 ( mndez et al .",
    "@xcite ) , and 4u 1735 - 44 ( ford et al .",
    "@xcite ) , @xmath1 slowly decreases as the frequencies of both qpos increase .",
    "moreover , in 4u 1636 - 53 the frequeny @xmath2 of the burst oscillations ( or half this value ) does not match the frequency difference @xmath1 between the khz qpos ( mndez , van der klis , & van paradijs @xcite ) . in the atoll source 4u 1728 - 34 ,",
    "mndez & van der klis ( @xcite ) find that @xmath1 is always significantly smaller than @xmath2 , even at the lowest inferred mass accretion rate , when @xmath1 seems to reach its maximum value , and that @xmath1 decreases significantly as the frequency of the lower khz qpo increases .",
    "a different approach was recently invoked by osherovich & titarchuk ( @xcite ) and titarchuk & osherovich ( @xcite ) , who proposed a unified classification of khz qpos and the related low frequency phenomena . in this model ,",
    "khz qpos are modeled as keplerian oscillations under the influence of the coriolis force in a rotating frame of reference ( magnetosphere ) .",
    "the frequencies @xmath3 of the upper khz qpo branch hold a hybrid frequency relation with the keplerian frequencies @xmath4 ( referred to the lower khz qpo branch ) : @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the rotational frequency of the star s magnetosphere . for sco x-1 , the qpos with frequencies @xmath7 and 90 hz",
    "are interpreted as the 1st and 2nd harmonics of the lower branch of the keplerian oscillations ( osherovich & titarchuk @xcite ) .",
    "the same interpretation is applied to the @xmath8 hz qpos in the atoll source 4u 1702 - 42 ( osherovich & titarchuk @xcite ) . the observed low lorentzian frequency in 4u 1728 - 34 is suggested to be associated with radial oscillations in the boundary layer of the disk , whereas the observed break frequency is determined by the characteristic diffusion time of the inward motion of the matter in the accretion flow ( titarchuk & osherovich @xcite ) .",
    "predictions of this model regarding relations between the qpo frequencies mentioned above compare favorably with recent observations of sco x-1 , 4u 1608 - 52 , 4u 1702 - 429 , and 4u 1728 - 34 .",
    "the discovery of khz qpo features allows to probe not only the interaction between the accretion disk and the stellar magnetosphere , but also the structure of the compact stars involved . in this _ letter _",
    ", based on the work of osherovich & titarchuk ( @xcite ) and titarchuk & osherovich ( @xcite ) , we study the mass - radius ( @xmath9 ) relation of the atoll x - ray source 4u 1728 - 34 , and show that it is possibly a strange star .",
    "titarchuk & osherovich ( @xcite ) suggest a model for the radial oscillations and diffusion in the viscous boundary layer of the accretion disk in lmxbs .",
    "their dimensional analysis has identified the corresponding frequencies which are consistent with the low lorentzian and break frequencies for 4u 1728 - 34 observed by ford & van der klis ( @xcite ) , the predicted values for the break frequency related to the diffusion in the boundary layer are also consistent with the observed ones for the same source .",
    "the presence of the break frequency and the correlated lorentzian frequency suggests the introduction of a new scale in the phenomenon . one attractive feature of the model is the introduction of such a scale in the model through the reynolds number .",
    "the best fit for the observed data was obtained when @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the stellar mass , @xmath12 is the inner edge of the accretion disk , @xmath13 is the schwarzschild radius , and @xmath14 is the spin frequency of the star . given the 364 hz spin frequency of 4u 1728 - 34 ( strohmayer et al .",
    "@xcite ) , from eq .",
    "( 1 ) we derive the inner disk radius @xmath15 where @xmath16 . since the innermost radius of the disk must be larger than the radius of the star itself , this leads to a mass - dependent upper bound on the stellar radius , @xmath17 which is plotted in dot - dashed curve in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . the dotted curve in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] represents the schwarzschild radius , which presents the lower limit of @xmath18 .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] compares eq .",
    "( 3 ) with the theoretical @xmath9 relations ( solid curves ) for nonrotating neutron stars given by six recent realistic models for the equation of state ( eos ) of dense matter . in models uu ( wiringa , fiks , & fabrocini @xcite ) , bbb1 and bbb2 ( baldo , bombaci , & burgio @xcite )",
    ", the neutron star core is assumed to be composed by an uncharged mixture of neutrons , protons , electrons and muons in equilibrium with respect to the weak interaction ( @xmath19-stable nuclear matter ) .",
    "these models are based on microscopic calculations of asymmetric nuclear matter by use of realistic nuclear forces which fit experimental nucleon - nucleon scattering data , and deuteron properties . in model hyp ( prakash et al .",
    "@xcite ) , hyperons are considered in addition to nucleons as hadronic constituents of the neutron star core .",
    "the curve labeled bpal12 is a very soft eos for @xmath19-stable nuclear matter ( prakash et al .",
    "@xcite ) , giving a lower limiting mass and a smaller radius with respect to a _ stiff _ eos .",
    "finally , we consider the possibility that neutron stars may possess a core with a bose - einstein condensate of negative kaons ( e.g. glendenning & schaffner - bielich @xcite ) .",
    "the main physical effect of the onset of k@xmath20 condensation is a softening of the eos with a consequent lowering of the neutron star maximum mass and possibly of the radius .",
    "this is shown with the curve labeled k@xmath20 .",
    "it is clearly seen that only the upper part of eoss uu , bbb1 , bbb2 , and bpal12 are compatible with eq .",
    "another constraint on the mass and radius of 4u 1728 - 34 results from the requirement that the inner radius @xmath12 of the disk must be larger than the last stable circular orbit @xmath21 around the star , which is given by ( bardeen , press , & teukolsky @xcite ) , @xmath22^{1/2}),\\ ] ] where @xmath23^{1/3}[(1+a/\\rh)^{1/3}+(1-a/\\rh)^{1/3}],\\ ] ] @xmath24^{1/2},\\ ] ] with @xmath25 and @xmath26 ( where @xmath27 is the moment of inertia and @xmath28 is the angular velocity of the star , respectively ) . for a given mass @xmath11 , from eq .",
    "( 2 ) we can find @xmath29 . from the inequality @xmath30 and eqs .",
    "( 4 - 6 ) , one can calculate the lower limit of @xmath31 , and from there the lower limit of the moment of inertia @xmath27 . to account for the inflation of the radius caused by rotation",
    ", we adopt the formula @xmath32 proposed by burderi et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , to obtain the lower limit on the stellar radius @xmath18 . and",
    "@xmath11 , one serves as the upper limit of @xmath18 and the other the lower limit of @xmath18 .",
    "but the former solution gives an unphysically small radius , and is rejected .",
    "] the results are shown in the dashed curve in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . combining the constraints @xmath33",
    "and @xmath34 reveals that the allowed distribution of the mass and radius of 4u 1728 - 34 must lie between the dot - dashed curve and the dashed curve .",
    "none of the neutron star eoss extends to this region .",
    "thus it seems to rule out the possibility that 4u 1728 - 34 is a neutron star ! including rotational effects",
    "will shift the theoretical neutron star @xmath9 curves to up - right in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , making the contrast between the theoretical neutron star models and the derived mass and radius range of 4u 1728 - 34 even worse .",
    "the difficulty of the neutron star model for 4u 1728 - 34 suggests that it may belong to another type of compact objects , that is , strange stars , which are entirely made of deconfined _ u , d , s _ quark matter ( _ strange matter _ ) . the possible existence of strange stars is a direct consequence of the conjecture ( bodmer @xcite ; witten @xcite ) that strange matter may be the absolute ground state of strongly interacting matter .",
    "detailed studies have shown that the existence of strange matter is allowable within uncertainties inherent in a strong interaction calculation ( farhi & jaffe @xcite ) ; thus strange stars may exist in the universe .",
    "most of the previous calculations ( e.g. alcock , farhi , & olinto @xcite ; haensel , zdunik , & schaeffer @xcite ) of strange star properties used an eos for strange matter based on the phenomenological nucleonic bag model , in which the basic features of quantum chromodynamics , such as quark confinement and asymptotic freedom are postulated from the beginning , though the deconfinement of quarks at high density is not obvious in the bag model .",
    "recently , dey et al . (",
    "@xcite ) derived an eos for strange matter , which has asymptotic freedom built in , shows confinement at zero baryon density , deconfinement at high density , and gives a stable configuration for chargeless , @xmath19-stable strange matter . in this model",
    "the quark interaction is described by an interquark vector potential originating from gluon exchange , and by a density dependent scalar potential which restores the chiral symmetry at high density .",
    "using the same model ( but different values of the parameters with respect to those employed in dey et al .",
    "@xcite ) we calculated the @xmath9 relations , which are also shown in solid curves labeled ss1 and ss2 in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , corresponding to strange stars with maximum masses of @xmath35 and @xmath36 and radii of 7.07 km and 6.53 km , respectively .",
    "it is seen that the region confined by the dashed and dot - dashed curves for 4u 1728 - 34 in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] is in remarkable accord with the strange star models with masses @xmath37 .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] clearly demonstrates that a strange star model is more compatible with 4u 1728 - 34 than a neutron star one .",
    "this seems to be important since the model of dey et al .",
    "( @xcite ) employs quark masses which decrease with increasing density , a manifestation of chiral symmetry restoration ( csr ) , and the parametrization of csr can be deduced from the mass and radius of the strange star fitted .",
    "the lower limit on the moment of inertia deduced above does not depend on the eos .",
    "in particular eq .",
    "( 7 ) is an extrapolation from neutron stars and it may be doubted whether it is valid for strange stars .",
    "we have checked that the standard calculated moment of inertia of the strange star of mass @xmath38 agrees with eq . ( 7 ) with an error of about @xmath39 , and the numerical factor 0.21 can change to 0.28 ( ss1 ) or 0.26 ( ss2 ) depending on the model parameters .",
    "the moment of inertia calculation of the strange star with variable density layers may not in fact satisfy the assumptions of the standard calculation .",
    "it is satisfying to find that an eos - independent estimate can already reproduce the inertia to a reasonable accuracy .",
    "we have shown that strange stars are more consistent with the properties of 4u 1728 - 34 compared to neutron stars , _ if _ the model of osherovich & titarchuk ( @xcite ) and titarchuk & osherovich ( @xcite ) correctly interprets the high- and low - frequency qpo phenomena in 4u 1728 - 34 .",
    "since our analysis does not involve any unknown physical factors such as the magnetic field strength and topology , radiation processes , and the mass accretion rate , it seems to provide the first definite evidence for the existence of strange stars .",
    "it remains to see whether other compact stars in lmxbs would be identified as strange stars from observations of their qpo phenomena .",
    "if so , there will be very deep consequences for both physics of strong interactions and astrophysics .",
    "of course our conclusion is subject to the uncertainty in the parameter , which is determined by the best fitting of the observed data .",
    "increase or decrease in @xmath40 will enlarge or reduce the allowed region of the mass and radius of 4u 1728 - 34 in fig .",
    "for example , if @xmath41 , nearly all neutron star eoss are compatible with 4u 1728 - 34 .",
    "however , according to titarchuk & osherovich ( @xcite ) , the dependence of @xmath42 on @xmath40 is quite strong : @xmath43 $ ] .",
    "a @xmath44 variation of @xmath40 from the preferred value 1.03 will double the value of @xmath42 , greatly reducing the confidence level of the fit .",
    "thus we expect that the possible change in @xmath40 and in the derived @xmath9 relation is rather small .    if 4u 1728 - 34 is a strange star , fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] reveals that it possesses a mass @xmath45 , which is quite small compared to the @xmath46 masses of standard neutron stars like psr 1913 + 16 , though still barely consistent with the estimated masses of quite a few radio pulsars within @xmath47 confidence limit ( see thorsett & chakrabarty @xcite ) . since the mass accretion rates in lmxb atoll sources are lower than the eddington limit accretion rate by @xmath48 orders of magnitude , it is conventionally thought that in such systems almost all of the matter transferred from the companion stars should be accreted by the compact stars .",
    "the light mass of 4u 1728 - 34 , however , seems to support the conclusion of thorsett & chakrabarty ( @xcite ) that there is no evidence for extensive mass accretion occurred in lmxbs , implying that even the simplest evolution of lmxbs is far from being fully understood",
    ". however , formation of strange stars may be different from that of neutron stars ( i.e. type ii / ib supernova explosions ) concerning the glitching phenomena observed in some radio pulsars ( e.g. alpar @xcite ) , suggesting that some exotic formation channels may be at work .",
    "accreting massive neutron stars in binary systems are not favorable progenitor candidates of strange stars , at least in the case of 4u 1728 - 34 , since it requires too large mass ( @xmath49 ) ejected during the conversion as the neutron star masses exceed @xmath50 .",
    "accretion - induced collapse of white dwarfs remains an open possibility of strange star formation , and could be responsible for the light mass of 4u 1728 - 34 .",
    "the detailed investigation of this subject is beyond the scope of this paper and wil be discussed elsewhere .",
