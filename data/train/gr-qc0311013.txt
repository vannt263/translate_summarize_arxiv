    "gravitational lensing is an important tool in astrophysics .",
    "observable phenomena of lensing by stars and galaxies can be explained in the weak field approximation , that is to say , keeping only the first order term in the expansion of the deflection angle @xcite .",
    "but when the lens is a black hole , a full general relativistic treatment is in order .",
    "+ recently , several articles studying strong field lensing appeared in the literature .",
    "virbhadra & ellis @xcite numerically analyzed the situation where the lens is a schwarzschild black hole placed in the center of the galaxy .",
    "they obtained the lens equation with an asymptotically flat metric and found that , besides the primary and secondary images , two infinite sets of faint relativistic images are formed by photons that make complete turns ( in both directions of rotation ) around the black hole before reaching the observer .",
    "fritelli , kling & newman @xcite found an exact lens equation without any reference to a background metric and compared their results with those of virbhadra & ellis .",
    "bozza et al @xcite developed an approximate analytical method ( generally called , as well , the strong field limit ) by which they obtained the positions and magnifications of the relativistic images for the schwarzschild black hole .",
    "subsequently , eiroa , romero & torres @xcite applied the strong field limit to the reissner - nordstrm black hole and discussed the possibility of detection of the relativistic images in the next few years .",
    "bozza @xcite extended the strong field limit to any static spherically symmetric lens and analyzed the case of a charged brans - dicke black hole .",
    "bhadra @xcite studied the gibbons - maeda - grafinkle - horowitz - strominger charged black hole of string theory in the strong field limit .",
    "virbhadra & ellis numerically investigated the lensing by naked singularities @xcite .",
    "bozza & mancini @xcite used the strong field limit to study the time delay between different relativistic images , showing that different types of black holes are characterized by different time delays .",
    "spinning black holes are more difficult to tackle .",
    "bozza @xcite analyzed the case of quasi equatorial lensing by rotating black holes and vzquez & esteban @xcite studied the kerr black hole where the observer and source have arbitrary inclinations .",
    "many of these recent advances ( if not all ) deal with theoretical implications of general relativity in a regime which is well beyond our current technological capabilities for detection . henceforth , the emphasis of these studies is not as much in predicting new phenomena that could be tested in a short period of time as it is in gaining insight on how gravitational lensing in particular , and gravity in general , behave in the strong field regimes .",
    "+ in ordinary lensing situations , the lens is placed between the source and the observer .",
    "but if the lens is a compact object with a photon sphere and the observer is placed between the source and the lens , it leads to the formation of images with deflection angles closer to odd multiples of @xmath0 .",
    "the observer sees the images in front and the source behind .",
    "this situation is called retro - lensing and was studied for the first time by holtz & wheeler @xcite , who analyzed only the two stronger images for a black hole placed in the galactic bulge with the sun as source .",
    "they also proposed retro - lensing as a new mechanism for searching black holes .",
    "a similar idea was suggested in the context of defocusing gravitational lensing by capozziello et al @xcite .",
    "de paolis et al @xcite recently analyzed the retro - lensing scenario for a bright star close to the massive black hole at the galactic center .",

    "we can take @xmath4 without loosing generality .",

    "in ordinary lensing the angular positions of the two sets of relativistic images , for a point source , are given by @xmath84 and @xmath85 with @xmath86 and @xmath87 we see that for both cases ( ordinary and retro - lensing ) , the images are formed close to @xmath52 , which has values of the order of the angular radius of the photon sphere of the lens . from eqs .",

    "then , taking by example the lensing by a schwarzschild black hole , and considering a situation where the factor involving the distances and the source angular position is the same , the magnification of the relativistic images in retro - lensing is greater by a factor about 24 compared with ordinary lensing .",
    "+ in addition , with ordinary lensing , besides the two set of relativistic images , two weak field images with small deflection angles are produced by the lens .",
    "these weak field images do not appear in retro - lensing , and it is the main difference in both cases .",
    "the weak field images are orders of magnitude stronger than the relativistic ones @xcite and lie very close to them .",
    "this makes detecting the relativistic images in ordinary lensing a very difficult task . in the case of retro - lensing , instead , the faint relativistic images are stronger and relatively easier to identify due to the absence of the brighter weak field images .",
