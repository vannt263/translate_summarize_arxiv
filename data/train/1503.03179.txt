    "observations of x - ray binaries suggest a depletion in the mass distribution of compact remnants between the highest mass nss ( @xmath10 ) and the lowest mass bhs ( @xmath11 )  @xcite . inferring masses electromagnetically is challenging and systematic errors may dominate . including variable emission from the accretion flow in the analysis of the same x - ray binaries systematically finds lower masses and disfavors the mass gap  @xcite .",
    "the mass distribution of nss and bhs has implications on plausible explanations for the core - collapse supernova mechanism .",

    "find that a bimodal mass distribution for compact remnants is a natural consequence of high mass red supergiants ending their lives as failed supernovae .",
    "gw observations have been suggested as a means of resolving this controversy because the component masses are directly encoded in the signal .",
    "we use our study to forecast whether lv observations can confirm or falsify a mass gap between nss and bhs .",

    "@xcite investigated how well lv can distinguish between nss and bhs by approximating parameter confidence intervals using the match between a proposed signal and a grid of templates .",
    "their study used a simplified version of the full pn waveforms parameterized by a single `` effective spin '' and concluded that most lv detections will not provide unambiguous separation between nss and bhs .",
    "the effective spin approximation overstates the degeneracy between mass and spin because it ignores precession of the orbital plane and spin alignments .",
    "@xcite revisited the topic of component - mass determination with a markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) analysis using waveforms that included spin and orbital precession .",
    "their study found that spin precession reduces mass - spin correlations , concluding that bns systems with components consistent with known nss in binaries would not be misidentified as either low - mass black holes or `` exotic '' neutron stars which they define as having masses either below @xmath23 or above @xmath24 , and/or with dimensionless spins @xmath25    in this work we use the same methodology of @xcite  employing an mcmc with templates that include full two - spin precession effects to infer the pdf  but use a large ensemble of nsbh and bbh signals , paying particular attention to lv s ability to identify sources which have one , or both , components in the mass gap .",

    "_ lalinference _  is part the lsc analysis library ( lal ) which has a wide variety of template waveforms available . * for this work we use the spintaylort2 waveform implemented in lal .",
    "a detailed description of the waveform can be found in appendix b of @xcite*. to simulate a population of plausible lv detections we draw 1000 binary parameter combinations from a uniform distribution in component masses with @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",

    "it is important to note that our simulated population includes binaries at sufficiently high mass ( @xmath34 ) that the merger and ringdown portion of the signal is detectable  @xcite .",
    "our study is focused on quantifying how well masses can be determined purely from the inspiral part of the waveform , for which we have reliable waveforms appropriate for parameter estimation ( i.e. , valid across all parameter space ) .",
    "using inspiral waveforms for both our signal simulations and parameter recovery allows us to assess the inspiral effects separate from merger - ringdown effects .",
    "however we are in urgent need of precessing waveforms that include the merger / ringdown and are valid over the full prior range to avoid systematic errors in analyses of real data .",
    "currently no such waveforms are available .",
    "available inspiral models that include precession and merger ringdown must be calibrated to numerical relativity simulations and to date are only valid at mass ratios @xmath35  @xcite .",
    "such limited - validity waveforms lead to non - quantified , systematic biases and can not be used for parameter estimation at present . in the absence of generic waveforms",
    "it may be necessary to apply a low - pass filter on real data to mask any merger and ringdown signals . *    * because gw emission is strongest along the orbital angular momentum direction , the detected binaries from a population uniform in orientation and volume is biased against systems whose orbital plane is edge - on to the observer ( defined as having an inclination angle near @xmath36 ) .",
    "[ fig : inclination ] shows the cumulative distribution function of our observed population ( red ) compared to an underlying population distributed uniformly in orientation .",
    "this selection effect has an important role in mass measurement for lv observations .",
    "precession - induced effects on the waveforms , which are relied upon to break the degeneracy between mass ratio and spin , are less detectable for face - on systems @xcite .",
    "previous studies which have used hand - selected populations of signals to study the effects of precession have not accounted for this selection bias , overemphasizing the role precession can play for generic signals .",
    "for example , the inclination used by @xcite ( 63@xmath37 ) is larger than @xmath38 of our sources so the improvement they found will be fully realized for a small fraction of our simulated population . *    for each binary we compute the response of advanced lv at design sensitivity @xcite with a low frequency cutoff at 20 hz .",
    "each simulated `` detection '' is then analyzed with ` l`alinference_mcmc which returns independent samples from the pdf for the model parameters .",
    "we do not simulate instrument noise in this study because our focus is on the degree to which lv s frequency - dependent sensitivity , and the flexibility of the pn waveforms , limit mass measurements .",
    "adding simulated noise to our signals introduces uncontrollable contributions to the pdf without adding any value to our assessment of each simulated signal .",
    "posterior distributions in true detections will be altered by the particular noise realization in which the signal is embedded .",
    "we take @xmath39 to be the dividing line between the masses of nss and bhs , with all nss located below this threshold and all bhs located above .",

    "horizontal gray dashed lines denote the mass gap .",
    "we find all of our simulations with @xmath42 to be clearly identified as containing at least one neutron star , however our population yields only ten such systems so these are small - number statistics . most binaries with a ns below 2 @xmath43 constrain the ns to have a mass below 3 @xmath43 although occasional the posterior supports the smaller object being a low - mass bh .",
    "detections of larger mass neutron stars ( @xmath44 have @xmath41 credible intervals which consistently extend into the bh regime .",

    "rule out _ the possibility that the system contains a neutron star , and definitively declare that we have detected a binary black hole ?",
    "in figure  [ fig : m2pe ] we see that the true mass of the smaller object must exceed @xmath45 before the @xmath41 credible intervals rule out a ns . *",

    "the fisher approximation is only suitable at sufficiently high snr that the posterior distribution function is well approximated by a multivariate gaussian , in which case the inverse fisher matrix is the covariance of the posterior .",
    "implicit in this condition is the assumption that the model waveform is a linear function of the source parameters .",
    "see  @xcite for a thorough deconstruction of fisher matrix - based intuition being applied to gw signals . for typical",
    "ligo / virgo binaries these conditions are not satisfied for the mass parameters .",
    "the width of the @xmath22 credible intervals is driven by uncertainty in @xmath49 which , due to the degeneracy with spin , is extremely non - gaussian and can span the entire prior range .",

    "three of the mass - gap sources were constrained to be @xmath52 .",
