    "since the seminal aumann and shapley s book @xcite , it is widely recognized that the theory of value of nonatomic games is strictly linked with different concepts of derivatives .",
    "a few papers , up to the recent literature , have investigated these relations ( see for example @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .    in the search of meaningful and simple formulas to express the value , the space @xmath2 and its important subspace @xmath3 play a preeminent role , though in the literature other more general forms of absolute continuity for set functions are well known , and each of them gives rise to a space of set functions which is therefore worth investigating .",
    "continuing in the framework intiated in @xcite , in section 2 we introduce and study four different spaces of absolutely continuous games , corresponding to as many forms of absolute continuity for set functions , the smallest one , termed as @xmath4 , actually coinciding with the well known space @xmath2 of aumann and shapley .",
    "we characterize scalar measure games @xmath5 , with @xmath6 a nonatomic nonnegative measure , in each of these spaces : they belong to the @xmath7 s under rather mild assumptions on @xmath8 .",
    "furthermore , we give a more general version of theorem c of aumann and shapley .",
    "however , it should be mentioned that the spaces @xmath9 turn out to be too large , for they are not even contained in @xmath10 .",
    "this is particularly undesirable for the purposes of this paper , where some form of continuity is part of the aim of the probe .",
    "for this reason , we bound our analysis to subspaces of @xmath4 , where suitable norms are available .",
    "as for the link among derivatives of set functions and value theory , to the best of our knowledge the more recent and general contribution so far is that proposed in @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the question of the relation between the refinement derivative and the value is posed , and a possible direction sketched ; in @xcite , the authors apply their more general ( i.e. without the nonatomicity restriction ) notion of refinement derivative to the study of the value on certain spaces of games by extending the potential approach of hart and mas - colell ( @xcite ) to infinite games .    in a previous paper ( @xcite )",
    "we had pointed out that , in a nonatomic context , the refinement derivative is connected with the classical burkill - cesari ( bc ) integral of set functions and , for bc integrable functions , the bc integral coincides with the refinement derivative at the empty set .",
    "though less general , the bc integral is analitycally more treatable .    motivated by all these facts , in @xcite we have started the study of the bc integral in the framework of transferable utility ( tu ) games",
    ". in this paper we extend and develop this approach , in particular in connection with the theory of value or of semivalue .",
    "in section 3 we introduce the general class of burkill - cesari ( bc ) integrable games , and prove that under natural assumptions , a wide variety of measure games belongs to this class .",
    "in addition , on the subspace of those bc integrable games which belong to @xmath4 , the bc integral turns out to be a semivalue .",
    "moreover , the class of bc integrable games contains a dense subspace of the largely used space @xmath3 , where continuous values and semivalues are largely described in the literature ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , the bc integral proves to be not continuous with respect to the bv norm on these games .",
    "as continuity appears to be a crucial property for the value on subspaces of @xmath10 , in section 4 we specialize to the subspace @xmath11 of so called lipschitz games , where a suitable finer norm ( the @xmath12-norm ) is defined and used as an alternative ( see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "we completely characterize the scalar measure games ( where the measure is nonnegative ) that belong to @xmath1 and we show that the bc integral on an appropriate subspace is a milnor ( therefore @xmath13-continuous ) semivalue , and hence a value ( though not unique ) when restricted to the natural space of feasible games .",
    "some convergence results for bc integrable games in the @xmath13-norm are also given and motivated .",
    "in every section convenient examples and counterexamples complement the coverage .",
    "a deeper investigation on uniqueness of the value on alternative subspaces of @xmath1 requires a better access to the @xmath14-norm",
    ". this will be the object of a forthcoming paper .",
    "from now on we will denote by @xmath15 a standard borel space ( i.e. @xmath16 is a borel set of a polish space , and @xmath17 the family of its borel subsets ) .",
    "@xmath16 represents a set of players , and @xmath17 the @xmath18-algebra of admissible coalitions .    a set function @xmath19 such that @xmath20 is called a _ transferable utility ( tu ) game .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite and to @xcite for the terminology concerning tu games : in particular @xmath10 will denote the space of all bounded variation games , endowed with the variation norm @xmath21 .",
    "the subspace of nonatomic countably additive measures will be denoted by @xmath22 and the cone of the nonnegative elements of @xmath22 by @xmath23 .    in @xcite",
    "we have reminded several notion of absolute continuity between two games , and compared them .",
    "following @xcite , we shall say that @xmath24 iff @xmath25 ( where @xmath26 .",
    "more classically , we shall say that @xmath27 is @xmath28-_absolutely continuous _ , and write @xmath29 iff for every @xmath30 there exists @xmath31 such that when @xmath32 there also holds @xmath33 .    in @xcite",
    "the authors introduce the concept of @xmath34-continuity of a game , when @xmath34 is a measure , ( but it can be extended to the more general case of @xmath34 monotone and subadditive ) .",
    "a game @xmath27 is _ @xmath34-continuous ( in symbols @xmath35 ) when @xmath27 is a continuous map from the pseudometric space @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the usual frchet pseudodistance @xmath38 .",
    "hence @xmath35 if for every @xmath30 there exists @xmath39 such that if @xmath40 then @xmath41 _    finally we shall write @xmath42 when we shall mean that the absolute continuity by chains holds ( see @xcite ) . the space @xmath2 introduced in @xcite is the space of all games @xmath27 on @xmath17 such that there exists an element @xmath43 such that @xmath44 .",

    "note that in @xcite we erroneously wrote that @xmath49 does not imply @xmath50 .",
    "it is therefore rather natural to ask whether the space @xmath10 is large enough to contain also @xmath7 for some @xmath51 . to show that this is not the case we need the following characterization of scalar measure games .",
