    "heavy fermion materials have been playing a particular important role in our understanding of strongly correlated electron systems@xcite , and the kondo lattice model is believed to capture the basic physics of heavy fermion systems@xcite .",
    "the model describes a lattice of local spin-1/2 magnetic moments coupled antiferromagnetically to a single band of conduction electrons . when the number of conduction electrons is less than the number of the local magnetic moments , the coherent superposition of individual kondo screening clouds gives rise to the huge mass enhancement of the quasiparticles , and the resulting metallic state is characterized by a _ large _ fermi surface with the luttinger volume containing both conduction electrons and local moments@xcite .",
    "competing with the kondo singlet formation , the local magnetic moments indirectly interact with each other via magnetic polarization of the conduction electrons  the ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yosida ( rkky ) interaction .",
    "such an interaction dominates at low values of the kondo exchange coupling and is the driving force for the antiferromagnetic ( afm ) long - range order near the half - filling of the conduction electrons doniach , lacroix - cyrot , zhang-2000 .",
    "in addition , there have been growing evidence that the antiferromagnetism is also intimate with superconductivity in some typical heavy fermion compounds , such as cecu@xmath0si@xmath0 ( ref.@xcite ) and cerhin@xmath1 ( ref.@xcite ) .",
    "so far various mechanisms for heavy fermion superconductivity have been studied , including paramagnon exchangeanderson , scalapino , conventional phonon - mediated@xcite , and kondo - boson - mediated pairings@xcite .",
    "so far the pairing mechanism of the heavy quasiparticles is still under investigation theoretically .",
    "however , various experimental evidences in some heavy fermion materials strongly support the d - wave pairing superconductivity@xcite .",
    "it is well established that the large-@xmath2 fermionic approach can be used to treat the kondo lattice model very efficiently , leading to a stable paramagnetic heavy fermi liquid stateread - newns , millis-1986,auerbach-1986 .",
    "qualitatively , the rkky interaction promotes singlet formation among the local magnetic moments , reducing the tendency of singlet formation between the local moments and conduction electrons . to simplify the rkky interaction , one can explicitly introduce the local afm heisenberg superexchange @xmath3 among the local moments to the kondo lattice systemcoleman-1989,coqblin-1997,senthil-2004,coleman-2005,pepin-2008,senthil-2009,zhang-2011 .",
    "thus , the paramagnetic heavy fermi liquid state ( @xmath4 ) provides a good starting point for theoretical considerations , because a number of instabilities can be further discussed , including the afm ordered state and unconventional heavy fermion superconductivity .",
    "recently , some numerical evidences on robust d - wave pairing correlations have been given in small size kondo - heisenberg lattice system@xcite .",
    "in this paper , we try to establish an effective mean field ( mf ) theory to the kondo - heisenberg lattice model on a two - dimensional square lattice in the limit of @xmath5 .",
    "after carefully examining three different mf treatments for the local afm heisenberg superexchange , we find that the spinon or f - fermion pairings can substantially save the ground state energy in the presence of the kondo screening .",
    "near the half - filling , the cooper pairs between the conduction electrons can be induced via the kondo screening effects .",
    "we further find that the resulting superconducting pairing function has a d - wave symmetry . whether there are nodes or not depends on the ratio of the local afm heisenberg and the kondo exchange couplings @xmath6 .",
    "there is a continuous phase transition between the nodal and nodeless superconducting phases . before the magnetic phase transition",
    ", the kondo screening order parameter is strongly suppressed , and the present mean field theory is no longer valid .",
    "the model hamiltonian of the kondo - heisenberg lattice model is given by : @xmath7where @xmath8 creates a conduction electron on an extended orbital with wave vector @xmath9 and z - component of spin @xmath10 .",
    "the spin-1/2 operators of the local magnetic moments have the fermionic representation @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the pauli matrices .",
    "there are two local constraints : @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the former local constraint restricts any charge fluctuations , the f - fermions just describe the spin degrees of freedom of the local moments , and we will refer them to spinons .",
    "the latter constraint is imposed by the spin su(2 ) symmetry and the extended s - wave spinon pairing between spinons can be excluded .",
    "so the paramagnetic fermi liquid limit ( @xmath5 ) provides us a good starting point of theoretical considerations .",
    "it is first noticed that the kondo spin exchange can be expressed as the singlet pairing attraction between the spinon holes and conduction electrons up to a chemical potential shift @xmath15then the kondo screening order parameters can be introduced as @xmath16for the non - magnetic states , the local afm heisenberg superexchange can be expressed in terms of either the spinon hopping or singlet pairing operators @xmath17however , most of previous theoretical studies on the kondo - heisenberg lattice modelcoqblin-1997,senthil-2004,coleman-2005,pepin-2008,senthil-2009,zhang-2011 , only introduced the spinon hopping order parameter .",
    "actually , coleman and andrei@xcite had emphasized that the local su(2 ) gauge invariance of the local heisenberg spin operator generally requires the consideration of both mf order parameters .",
    "moreover , recent advances in this area have been made by usingsymplectic representation of the local magnetic spins @xcite .",
    "here we first introduce two mf valence bond order parameters to characterize the short - range afm correlations between the local moments@xmath18    to avoid the incidental degeneracy of the conduction electron band on a square lattice , we choose @xmath19 , where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the first and second nearest neighbor hoping matrix elements , while @xmath22 is the chemical potential , which should be determined self - consistently by the density of conduction electrons @xmath23 . when the local afm correlation hopping parameter @xmath24 is simply chosen as a uniform parameter , the spinons form a very narrow band with a dispersion @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the lagrangian multiplier to impose the local constraint @xmath27 on average .",
    "for the short - range afm spinon singlet pairing order parameter @xmath28 , the local pairing constraint @xmath29 excludes the extended s - wave pairing , and then d - wave symmetric pairings lead to a lower ground state energy@xcite , corresponding to @xmath30 .",
    "then the mf model hamiltonian in momentum space can be written as @xmath31where @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "when a nambu spinor is defined by @xmath34 , we can express the mf model hamiltonian in a matrix form@xmath35diagonalizing this mf model hamiltonian , we obtain two quasiparticle energy bands@xmath36where@xmath37due to the particle - hole symmetry of the superconducting quasiparticles , all the negative energy states are filled up at zero temperature , and the ground state energy per site is thus given by @xmath38where @xmath39 .",
    "the saddle point equations for the mf order parameters @xmath40 , @xmath24 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 can be determined by minimizing the ground state energy : @xmath43the chemical potential @xmath44 is determined by the relation @xmath45 .",

    "we choose @xmath52 , @xmath53 and fixing @xmath54 , we have carefully solved the self - consistent equations and compared the ground state energy densities for the three different types of mf schemes .",
    "the numerical results are not sensitive to the parameters chosen .",
    "the numerical results are displayed in fig .",

    "however , the ground state energies for two other mf schemes grow up in the beginning and then blend down after reaching their maximal points .",
    "only when @xmath58 , the ground state energy of the second mf ansatz starts to become lower than that of the first mf ansatz . in the present paper , we will confine our following discussions to the small local afm heisenberg exchange coupling @xmath59 , so only the first type of mf scheme ( @xmath47 and @xmath48 ) will be used .    .",
    "the other parameters are @xmath52 and @xmath53 . ]",
    "when there is only one short - range afm correlation order parameters @xmath60 , the mf model hamiltonian is simplified by@xmath61where the spinons have a flat band . due to the hybridization effect , the heavy quasiparticle bands form . on the other hand ,",
    "the spinon singlet pairings imply a special non - magnetic state with short - range afm correlations among the local magnetic moments . although there are no any direct attractions among the conduction electrons , the spinon singlet pairings provide an indirect glue for the formation of the cooper pairs via the kondo screening / hybridizing effect .",
    "so the resulting mf ground state represents a heavy fermion superconducting state .    on a two - dimensional square lattice",
