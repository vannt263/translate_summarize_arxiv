    "known popularly as the gelfand - pinsker channel , it has been widely studied for a broad range of applications which include fingerprinting , watermarking , broadcast communication , etc .    in this paper , we are concerned with the _ strong converse _ for this channel as well as its _ reliability function _ , i.e. , the largest exponential rate of decay , with block codeword length , of the decoding error probability . even for a dmc without states ,",
