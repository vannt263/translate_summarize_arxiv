    "the cooling of nano mechanical mirrors by the process of optical up - conversion has become a standard technique @xcite .",
    "however the same technique does not quite work for cooling of brilliouin acoustic modes @xcite in a bulk material medium . in this case",
    ", one has to satisfy constraints arising from the phase matching conditions and at the same time avoid the generation of stokes radiation .",
    "in the simplest case it is known that the stokes process dominates @xcite .",
    "the latter becomes critical because a thermal distribution of phonons would give rise to the generation of both stokes ( down conversion ) and anti - stokes ( up conversion ) fields .",
    "the dominant stokes process would lead to heating .",
    "ar5 solved this problem by using a sophisticated resonator so that the incident pump and generated anti - stokes fields were resonant with two different resonator modes , but the generated stokes field was nonresonant .",
    "in addition , they found a suitable brilliouin mode in the spherical resonator geometry , so that the relevant phase matching condition was satisfied .",
    "more generally phonons are known to have many different types of dispersion relations @xcite which in turn determine the phase matching conditions and therefore one has to examine the cooling of phonon modes under more general conditions .",
    "it is also very interesting to study the cooling of two or even several different phonon modes simultaneously , via anti - stokes upconversion .",
    "this is very relevant in the context of applications in quantum information science when phonons are used as carriers of quantum information . in the light of this , in this paper we develop a more general framework for possible cooling of general phonon modes .    as mentioned above",
    ", our main aim here is to present a general theory of laser cooling of low frequency phonon modes in matter , via the anti - stokes up- conversion process of the inelastic light scattering .",
    "although , our formulation will begin with an overview of the known case of laser cooling of a single longitudinal acoustic phonon mode via the anti - stokes brillouin scattering process , it will go on to develop a general theory of cooling of low frequency phonon modes of arbitrary polarization , whether these are acoustic or optical phonons , and whether these are modes in an extended bulk matter or in a confined geometry .",
    "in fact , the formulation has been kept general enough to be applicable not only to phonons but to any type of low frequency collective excitation modes in matter which can give rise to inelastic light scattering ( raman scattering ) via the modulation of the linear optical dielectric function .",
    "the cooling via the three -wave anti - stokes up -conversion is possible in principle for any such mode , provided that it has a sufficiently long life time compared to the resonant cavity anti - stokes optical mode , and the corresponding raman tensor coupling of the mode is not too weak .",
    "we will also consider the possibility of cooling more than one phonon mode simultaneously via the three - wave up - conversion process , which has not been considered earlier even for the case of longitudinal acoustic phonons @xcite .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows - in sec ii we introduce the basic features of the phonon photon interaction , relevant to anti - stokes generation .",
    "we derive the basic equations for the coupled phonon and electromagnetic fields . in sec iii",
    "we derive the equations for phonon and photon fields in terms of the relevant resonator modes .",
    "the nature of the phonon dispersion or its frequency spectrum , and its relevance for phonon - photon interaction are discussed in sec iv . in sec",
    "v we describe quantum langevin equations and show how the single mode cooling emerges ar2 . in sec",
    "vi we discuss collective effects in simultaneous cooling of two modes .",
    "the numerical results for the simultaneous cooling of two modes are given in sec vii , with a discussion of these results .",
    "in this section , we present , for completeness , a first principle derivation of the basic equations for the stokes and anti - stokes scattering from vibrational modes .",
    "this basic description would enable us to formulate the problem of more general three wave interactions in a resonator . for simplicity ,",
    "let us first consider the case of longitudinal acoustic waves in matter , which give rise to the brillouin scattering .",
    "the long wavelength longitudinal acoustic waves can be described either in terms of density fluctuations @xmath0 or the displacement field @xmath1 , which are related by @xmath2where @xmath3 , @xmath4 are , say , mass densities , and @xmath4 is the mean mass density of the medium . in terms of the displacement field @xmath5 ,",

    "[ fig2 ] is@xmath221it should be emphasized that the cooling parameter @xmath200 introduced here should not be confused with the effective bulk raman coupling constant @xmath222 introduced in eq .",
    "( [ e14b ] ) . for fig.[fig2 ] for the values of @xmath223 and @xmath224 used , @xmath225 if @xmath226 ; @xmath227 if @xmath228 . the parameters @xmath223 and @xmath224 [ eq . ( [ ev4 ] ) ]",
    "depend on the phase matching parameter @xmath98 and the power of the stokes field .",
    "clearly if we increase the power of the stokes laser i.e. if we increase @xmath229 then @xmath200 goes down .",
    "we note that the parameter @xmath200 also gives the ratio of the temperature of the cooled phonon mode to its initial temperature .",
    "this is because the factor @xmath230 if @xmath231 . for phonon frequency , say in the range , @xmath232mhz @xcite , the parameter @xmath233 even at a temperature like @xmath234k .",

    "( [ ev20 ] ) represents the conversion of phonons into anti - stokes in the lowest order of the coupling @xmath239 and @xmath224 .",
    "note that the spectrum of the generated antistokes radiation has signatures of the phonon spectrum .",
    "the spectrum of the generated radiation can be studied by examining the output field at frequency @xmath56 .",
    "note that the anti - stokes photons leak out of the cavity and the phonon modes are constantly interacting with the thermal bath , the conservation of photon and phonon numbers in the cavity does not hold .",
    "if we use the actual numerical parameters of the experiment on the single- mode cooling of the acoustic phonon modes done by bahl _",
    "_ ar5 , we can also examine the possibility of bimodal phonon cooling in such a system . in their experiment , @xmath141 was of the order of @xmath240mhz , and they had observed cooling of the surface acoustic phonon mode of frequency @xmath241mhz , with their intrinsic line width of the order of only @xmath242khz at the ambient temperature of @xmath243k .",
    "thus , if one can find another similar phonon mode in the system with its frequency within a few mhz away from the @xmath244mhz mode , say in the range of @xmath245 to @xmath246mhz , which also has an appreciable coupling @xmath98 , defined by eq .",
    "( [ e30a ] ) , we should be able to observe simultaneous cooling of two such modes in the same experimental system . otherwise , one has to search for another appropriate phonon system to observe this effect .",
    "note that in the experimental system discussed above , if there are more than two phonon modes near the @xmath244mhz mode within @xmath247 range , each one with appreciable coupling , all those modes are expected to be cooled simultaneously .    in conclusion , we have presented a general theory of cooling of phonon modes via their interactions with suitable optical fields . the theory is formulated in terms of the spatial mode functions for the relevant interacting modes , in any given geometry , allowing it to be applicable to a variety of systems with diverse phonon dispersion relations and frequency spectra .",
    "in particular , we show the cooling of two phonon modes at the same time if the line width of each of the phonon modes is very small compared to the decay rate @xmath144 of the resonant anti - stokes cavity mode and their frequency difference is smaller than the line width @xmath144 . in any experimental set - up similar to",

    "_ ar5 , if one can find two nearby sharp phonon modes satisfying the above conditions , one should be able to observe the bimodal cooling described in this paper .",
