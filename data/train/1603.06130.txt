    "the search for supersymmetry ( susy ) is among the main priorities of the lhc collaborations . up to now",
    "no sign for supersymmetry or any significant deviation from the standard model ( sm ) prediction has been found .",
    "in contrast , the last particle predicted by the sm has been found @xcite marking one of the most important milestones in particle physics .",
    "its mass is already known rather precisely : @xmath0  ( stat . ) @xmath1  ( syst . )  gev @xcite",
    ". moreover , the strengths of the various lhc - signals are also close to the sm predictions . the combination of the higgs discovery with the ( yet ) unsuccessful searches has led to the introduction of a model class called ` natural susy ' @xcite .",
    "the basic idea of this class of models is to take only those susy particles close the electroweak scale which do give a sizeable contribution to the mass of the higgs boson in order to avoid a too large tuning of parameters and to take all other particles at the multi - tev scale . in particular , the higgsinos ( the partners of the higgs bosons ) , the light stop ( the partner of the top - quark ) and in case that it is mainly a left - stop also the light sbottom are assigned masses of the order of a few hundred gev . in addition",
    "the gluino and the heavier stop should be close to the tev scale .    in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) the mass of the higgs boson",
    "is bounded to be below the mass of the @xmath2-boson at tree level implying the need of huge radiative corrections close to 90% as @xmath3  gev . due to the large yukawa couplings of the top - quark such corrections",
    "can indeed be achieved by the requirement of either a large geometric average of the stop masses and/or a large left - right mixing parameter @xmath4 . in non - minimal extensions ,",
    "the tree - level bound can be pushed to larger values due to the extra @xmath5-contributions as in the nmssm @xcite or due to extra @xmath6-term contributions in models with an enlarged gauge group @xcite .",
    "the searches for the stop in various channels have been carried out in the context of the mssm by the atlas collaboration , see e.g.  @xcite and the cms collaboration , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the reinterpretation of the corresponding data in terms of natural susy in the mssm context has been carried out in @xcite , of scenarios based on a compressed spectrum between higgsino and gluino in @xcite , the natural nmssm in @xcite and in a scenario with @xmath7-sneutrinos in @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we will focus on models which can emerge as a low energy limit from the breaking of an extended gauge sector .",
    "if these models are left - right symmetric then one has also to include right - handed neutrinos and their superpartners , the @xmath7-sneutrinos .",
    "here it might well be that actually the lightest r - sneutrino is the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) . in these models ,",
    "the neutrino yukawa couplings are rather small if neutrino physics is explained via a low scale seesaw mechanism of type i @xcite .",
    "provided that this results in rather long life - times of the next to lightest susy particle ( nlsp ) , e.g.  in case that the stop is the nlsp one expects it to live so long that it can actually leave the detector @xcite . in such cases",
    "the searches for @xmath7-hadrons apply resulting in a mass bound of about @xmath8  gev @xcite . similarly also",
    "the case of a chargino nlsp would lead to a stable particle at the relevant time scales of collider measurements .",
    "however , it might well be that an inverse seesaw mechanism @xcite is the correct explanation of the observed neutrino data . in this case",
    "the neutrino yukawa couplings are in general large enough that the nlsp decays inside the collider . here",
    "we will focus on such scenarios and study to which extent the bounds on the stop masses are changed compared to the mssm searches .",
    "similar scenarios , motivated by dark matter arguments , have been considered in @xcite .",
    "this work differs in several aspects : ( i ) in their case the resulting r - sneutrino is mainly of @xmath9 flavour type whereas we will investigate the case where all three lepton flavours contribute significantly .",
    "also the part of the parameter space considered differs from ours .",
    "( ii ) they use the package smodels @xcite to obtain the constraints whereas we will use the checkmate @xcite . while ` checkmate ` , ` atom ` @xcite , ` pgs ` @xcite or ` madanalysis ` @xcite deduce limits with a detector simulation for generated events , ` smodels ` or ` fastlim ` @xcite constrain models by comparing the cross - section times branching ratio for certain topologies with the observed upper limits taking the respective efficiencies into account . `",
    "pgs ` has been used in @xcite and there only the case of a pure right - handed stop @xmath10 has been considered in detail , whereas we will present here results for various stop mixing angles .    in the next section",
    "we will introduce the model focussing on the parts relevant for this investigation . in section [ sec : scan ]",
    "we summarize the relevant lhc analyses as implemented in the package ` checkmate ` @xcite , as well as the generation of the underlying monte - carlo data . in section [ sec : results ] we present our results and conclude finally in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the simplified model under consideration is based on the relevant natural susy particle content , where one adds to the sm the superpartners of the third generation squarks , the two stops @xmath11 and the two sbottoms @xmath12 , and the partners of the higgs - bosons , the so - called higgsinos consisting of two neutral states and a charged one . as usual",
    "we will assume that the heavier sbottom @xmath13 is too heavy to contribute wherever possible but it will turn out that in some case it has to be included for consistency .",
    "moreover , we add three @xmath7-sneutrinos @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) which take over the role of the lightest supersymmetric particle(s ) ( lsp ) and , thus , they can form the dark matter of the universe as we assume conserved @xmath7-parity , see e.g.  @xcite . to be more precise ,",
    "we consider a scenario where neutrino - data are explained via an inverse seesaw and , thus , one needs in addition three fields @xmath16 which carry lepton number as well .",
    "however , for our purposes they are essentially decoupled apart from the mixing with the @xmath7-sneutrinos .",
    "the same holds for the heavy neutrino - states . in principle",
    "they could show up in the decays of the susy particles but the corresponding decay widths are kinematically suppressed .",
    "all other supersymmetric particles are assumed to be too heavy to play any role here .",
    "the relevant part of the superpotential reads as @xmath17 where the @xmath18 indicates the @xmath19 invariant product . for the explanation of neutrino data one would have to add a term @xmath20 where max(@xmath21 ) has to be much smaller than any of the masses discussed here .",
    "therefore , we can safely neglect it here as its effect would be a tiny mass splitting between the real and imaginary parts of the sneutrinos , see e.g.  @xcite , which is not measurable at the lhc or even an ilc .",
    "the existence of the @xmath22 allows us also to take @xmath23 as flavour diagonal .",
    "the corresponding soft susy breaking terms are given by @xmath24    it is well known that there can be a sizeable mixing between l- and r - states in case of third generation squarks which is expressed by @xmath25 here we use the convention that @xmath26 and @xmath27 . in the following we will take the masses of the physical states as well as the mixing angles @xmath28 and @xmath29 as free parameters . note that only five out of the six parameters can be chosen freely as the parameter @xmath30 appears in the mass matrices of both , @xmath31 and @xmath32 implying the following relation @xmath33 at tree - level .",
    "therefore we take as input @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 . in case of @xmath37",
    "it can happen that the calculated @xmath38 is actually smaller than the input value for @xmath36 .",
    "in such cases we will relabel the corresponding states according to the correct mass ordering .",
    "in the slepton sector we have a mixing between @xmath39 and @xmath40 . neglecting generation mixing one finds the following mass matrix @xmath41 for completeness we note that there are corrections proportional to the left - right mixing in the sneutrino sector of the l - slepton masses squared which we neglect here as the l - sleptons are assumed to be very heavy . provided that the @xmath42 has a similar size as @xmath43 one finds a rather light state with mass of order @xmath44 and a rather heavy state with mass of @xmath45 and a nearly maximal mixing . despite",
    "the nearly maximal mixing we still call the light states @xmath39 in an obvious abuse of language",
    ". we will neglect for simplicity in the following generation mixing in this sector and assume that the three lightest states are mass - degenerate to reduce the number of free parameters . in the same spirit",
    "we will assume that @xmath46 is diagonal and that all entries have the same size .",
    "this set - up is equivalent to assuming only one light @xmath39-state which couples with equal strength to all charged leptons and the charged higgs boson .",
    "we will also comment on the expected changes when departing from these assumptions .",
    "the masses of the higgsino - like neutralinos @xmath47 and the chargino @xmath48 are given by @xmath49 up to small corrections of order @xmath50min@xmath51 , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the resulting mass differences are at most a few gev and will be neglected in the following because the visible products of the corresponding decays , e.g.   @xmath52 , are very soft and can not be detected at the lhc .",
    "thus we will set @xmath53 .",
    "last but not least we assume also the gluino to be too heavy to be produced at the lhc with @xmath54  gev at a sizeable rate . summarizing , we have thus the following set of eight free parameters : @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath55 , @xmath46 and @xmath56 .    we assume , as mentioned above , that the @xmath39 is the lsp and , thus",
    ", we have essentially two different mass orderings depending on whether the squarks are lighter or heavier than the higgsinos . in the second case the squarks decay according to @xmath57 with @xmath58 .",
    "if there is a sufficient large mass splitting , then there are in addition bosonic final states @xcite which we take into account as well @xmath59 whose relative importance depends on the mixings in the stop- and sbottom sectors , respectively . in case that only the fermionic decay modes are allowed at a sizable rate ,",
    "then the final states of stops and sbottoms are practically the same in the standard natural susy scenarios as the decay products of of @xmath60 and @xmath61 are too soft to be detected , e.g.all higgsino like states lead to the same missing energy signatures as the lsp . in our scenario",
    "the higgsinos will decay further to @xmath62 with @xmath63 .",
    "this results in cascade decays with final states like @xmath64 in case that the higgsinos are heavier than the squarks one has the same final states which are now mediated via off - shell higgsinos resulting in somewhat changed angular distributions between the charged fermions , e.g.  in the @xmath65 and the @xmath66 systems .",

    "an important observation is that for large @xmath75 the final states containing a @xmath76-quark get reduced and correspondingly the final states with a @xmath77-quark are enhanced .",
    "the reason is that for smaller @xmath75 the kinematical differences are compensated to some extent by the differences in the corresponding yukawa couplings .",
    "the kink in the stop branching ratios close to @xmath78 is due to a negative interference between the higgsino component , which is suppressed by @xmath79 , and the gaugino component of the @xmath80-@xmath77-@xmath81 coupling .",
    "for this investigation we have used a series of public programs : as a first step we have used ` sarah ` @xcite in the ` susy / bsm toolbox 1.2.9 ` @xcite to implement the aforementioned model into the event generator ` whizard 2.2.6 ` @xcite .",
    "we use the ` cteq6l1 ` pdf set @xcite in ` whizard ` , which uses ` pythia 6.427 ` @xcite internally for showering and hadronization with the atlas ` auet2b - ct6l ` tune to generate events at tree - level .",

    "these event samples are then re - weighted according to the corresponding total cross - section which we compute with ` prospino 2.1 ` @xcite to get a more reliable result . ` checkmate ` compares the number of events passing each signal region of every considered analysis with the observed @xmath84 limit obtained by the atlas collaboration via the parameter @xmath85 with @xmath86 being the number of the considered signal region , @xmath87 as the error from the monte carlo and @xmath88 is the expected or experimentally observed 95% confidence limit on the signal @xcite .    ` checkmate ` contains also cms analyses which we did not exploit here for a practical reason : in the version used one can combine easily different analyses carried out by one collaboration in a single run but not those carried out by two different collaborations . thus their inclusion would have nearly doubled our computation time . in view of the fact , that both collaborations have obtained rather similar results , we do not expect any significant differences from the results obtained here compared to the combined analyses of both collaborations .",

    ".list of the atlas analyses used in this study . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in figure  [ fig : condensed - exclusion ] we summarize the exclusion statements in a condensed way .",
    "we put the ambiguous either conservatively to the set of allowed points ( left column ) or to the excluded set ( right column ) to get a rough idea of the underlying uncertainty .",
    "the upper row gives the cases with an unflipped sbottom mass spectrum .",
    "we see in plot a ) that only the case of @xmath89 gev is strictly excluded if the ambiguous points are counted as allowed .",
    "the corner with @xmath90gev and @xmath91  gev is not constrained at all which was expected due to the small production cross section .",
    "the exclusion statement for all other points is strongly dependent on the underlying parameter combinations as can be seen from the discussion of the individual cases before .",
    "a comparison with the right column shows that the range of excluded stop masses for all other parameter combinations gets somewhat larger if the ambiguous points are counted as excluded indicating that this region deserves further investigations .",
    "this also correct for some parameter combinations in the the higher stop and sbottom mass region close to 800 gev .",
    "a particular case is @xmath92  gev which seems now to be excluded for all parameter combinations .",
    "however , this has to be taken with a grain of salt as we have restricted @xmath93  gev and , thus , having always two - body decays .",
    "we have also checked that this point is not excluded , which means having @xmath94 values below 2/3 , for some parameter combinations if only three body decays of the squarks are allowed by setting @xmath95  gev for this particular case .",
    "the lower row gives the cases where the sbottom mass ordering is flipped .",
    "here we exclude right from the start all points where the sbottom is lighter than the sneutrino .",
    "we see that these cases are consistent with the findings in the upper row .",
    "however , in addition we have here a couple of points where the lighter sbottom has a mass below 300 gev . it is intriguing that in the rather low mass region the exclusion depends on the parameter combinations in the conservative case ( left side ) .",
    "the reason for this lies in the particular mass hierarchies : in cases , where the decay @xmath96 is the only viable one due to a large @xmath56 , the value of the sneutrino mass determines the @xmath97 and visibility of the exiting @xmath77 quark which helps to pass the particular analysis jet requirements in addition to the jets coming from the @xmath98 .",
    "moreover , the mass splitting between @xmath99 and @xmath100 is rather small leaving little phase space for the @xmath98-boson which in turn implies that the resulting jet energies hardly pass the required @xmath97-cuts .    a comparison of our exclusion with those ref .",
    "@xcite shows that due the fact , that we do not only consider @xmath101 , implying @xmath102 , but consider three different values , we do not reach their strict exclusions of @xmath103 up to 900 gev .",
    "however , if for a pure @xmath10 we do not reach this value which is due to the differences between ` checkmate ` and ` pgs ` .",
    "similarly , we get lower bounds on the mass bounds of the chargino and sneutrinos from the direct chargino production : we get roughly a bound of @xmath104 gev and @xmath105 gev whereas in @xcite the bounds @xmath106 gev and @xmath107 gev .",
    "the main difference is the more conservative @xmath94-measure of ` checkmate ` given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : r - value - definition ] ) whereas in ` pgs ` the measure @xmath108 is used with @xmath109 and @xmath110 being the number of events from the new physics and the experimental upper bound , respectively .",
    "in this paper we have studied a variant of the natural supersymmetric models containing a right - handed sneutrino lsp as it can emerge as effective model from models with extended gauge groups .",
    "we have considered different scenarios taking also into account the case that at least one of the sbottoms gets light .",
    "the latter can in particular occur if the lighter stop is essentially left - handed .",
    "provided that the mass difference is not too small we find that only stop masses of up to about 300 gev can be excluded in this scenario independent of its nature .",
    "depending on the scenario , where the main parameters are the stop mixing angles and the ratio of stop mass to @xmath56 to sneutrino mass , one can exclude larger masses of up to 700 gev . here",
    "we roughly confirm the findings of @xcite where the case of a pure @xmath10 had been considered .",
    "in addition we obtain similar results for the sbottoms .",
    "last but not least we find that the bounds are somewhat weaker in case of large @xmath75 as the number of produced @xmath76-quarks from the squark decays is smaller which in turn reduces the average number of hard leptons in the final state .",

    "<S> the data obtained by the lhc collaborations clearly show that supersymmetric models are not realized in nature in a vanilla form and that in particular strongly interacting supersymmetric particles are most likely heavier than expected . </S>",
    "<S> an exception are the partners of the third generation quarks , which also play a dominant role in the breaking of the electroweak symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> we consider here an extended class of so - called ` natural supersymmetric models ' where we allow for a sneutrino as the lightest supersymmetric particle as it appears for example in left - right symmetric models and/or models where supersymmetry is explained via an inverse seesaw mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> we evaluate how much existing atlas data constrain such scenarios and obtain roughly a bound of 300  gev on the charginos if the sneutrinos are lighter than about 120  gev . for the stop </S>",
    "<S> we find that only masses up to 300 gev are excluded independent of the mixing angle . for larger values </S>",
    "<S> the exclusion depends on the detail of the scenario and if the mass exceeds 800 gev no bound is obtained . </S>"
