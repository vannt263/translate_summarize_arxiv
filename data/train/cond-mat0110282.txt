    "mechanical shear proved to be a successful technique .",
    "alignment by application of an electric field @xmath11 is also possible , but for macroscopic samples it requires high voltage difference between the two bounding electrodes .",
    "nevertheless , this technique is especially suitable for thin films , because the thickness involved makes the required large fields ( typically @xmath12 ) accessible .",
    "we consider in this paper thin films of lamellar diblock copolymers , under the influence of a perpendicular electric field .",
    "initially , the lamellae are parallel to the confining surfaces , because of preferential short - range interactions with the surfaces . in section [ 7:wsl ]",
    "we consider diblock copolymers in the weak segregation regime .",
    "we show in section [ 7:rowsm ] that electric field applied perpendicular to the surfaces can cause the melt to transform from a parallel to a perpendicular orientation through a first - order phase transition .",
    "the critical field @xmath0 for this transition is caused by a competition between the electric field and surface interactions . in section [ 7:ssl ]",
    "we investigate the thin - film alignment for diblocks in the strong segregation regime . in this regime ,",
    "the surface correlations are finite , and thus the range of parallel ordering induced by the surfaces is finite as well .",
    "we give the transitions between parallel , perpendicular and mixed lamellae in terms of the system parameters , using a phenomenological model . in both weak and strong segregation regimes ,",
    "large distortions are present in the copolymer film , and these could be observed in experiments .",

    "the surface interaction , @xmath30 , can be written as an integral over the bounding surfaces ( in units of @xmath31 ) @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "terms which do not depend on the copolymer order parameter are not important to subsequent calculations , and were dropped out .",

    "depending on the values of @xmath39 , an integer ( @xmath45 ) or half integer ( @xmath46 ) number of lamellae exist between the two surfaces . in the former case",
    "the ordering is symmetric ( the same type of monomers wet both surfaces ) , while in the latter it is antisymmetric ( a monomers wet one surface , whereas b monomers wet the other surface ) .",

    "under conditions of constant voltage difference across the electrodes situated at the two bounding surfaces , the minimum of the free energy is obtained by maximizing the capacitance . noting that since the a- and b - monomers ( blocks ) have different dielectric constants , the effect of the electric field is to align the bcp layers parallel to the field , i.e. perpendicular to the surfaces . at a certain field strength , @xmath0 , this tendency balances the preference for parallel lamellae as induced by the surfaces . further increase of @xmath52 above the critical value @xmath0 gives rise to a perpendicular lamellar ordering .",

    "the dimensionless amplitude @xmath55 is determined by the strength of the surface interactions , and can be larger than unity if @xmath39 are sufficiently large .",
    "namely , the surface induced order can be stronger than in the bulk . upon increase of the electric field , the function @xmath56 of this parallel state diminishes , while the function @xmath57 of perpendicular lamellae ( parallel to the electric field ) increases .",
    "this can be modeled by using the superposition ansatz for the order parameter @xmath58 in the presence of the field @xmath52 : @xmath59 the order parameter of the perpendicular lamellae is @xmath60 .",

    "although the perpendicular ordering may be very strong , some parallel ordering is still present ( finite @xmath55 ) . as the electric field is further increased , there is only little reminiscence of the parallel ordering , and the perpendicular lamellae are nearly perfect .",
    "this can be seen in fig .",
    "4 d , where we choose @xmath177 .",
    "in this section we consider the same alignment phenomenon under an electric field as in the previous section , but the bcp melt is assumed to be in the strong segregation limit , i.e. @xmath178 . in this regime",
    "the lamellae are not easily deformed , and the effect of the surface field is important only close to the confining walls , in contrast to the long - range ordering induced by the surfaces in the weak segregation .",

    "in this paper we study the influence of an applied electric field on the morphology of thin film diblock copolymers . in the absence of an electric field",
    "the lamellae are taken to be ordered parallel to the confining surfaces .",
    "strong enough @xmath52 fields in the direction perpendicular to the surfaces will eventually orient the lamellae in a perpendicular direction .",
    "however , the response of weakly segregated lamellae is different than the response of strongly segregated lamellae . in the former case ,",
    "the bcp order parameter is obtained as a function of electric field strength @xmath52 and other system parameters ( such as the degree of segregation @xmath154 , strength of surface interactions @xmath39 and film thickness @xmath155 ) .",
    "the field applied in the perpendicular direction diminishes the amplitude of the parallel bcp state . above the critical field ,",
    "@xmath134 , a first - order phase transition occurs , from the parallel into the perpendicular state .    the first @xmath141-mode which becomes stable in the perpendicular state @xmath61 has a finite periodicity , equal to the bulk spacing @xmath18 .",
    "moreover , modulations of adjacent inter - material dividing surfaces ( imds ) are out - of - phase with each other .",

    "the weak segregation imds undulations studied here appear because in this regime it is relatively easy to deform the lamellae .",

    "this superposed state is yet to be verified in experiments .",
    "the critical field @xmath0 as a function of inter - surface separation @xmath155 decays with characteristic oscillations of period @xmath145 .",
    "these oscillations are the result of lamellar frustration , occurring when the period @xmath262 is different than @xmath145 ( while @xmath61 is taken always to be equal to @xmath140 ) .",
    "the deviation of the critical field @xmath0 from the @xmath263 scaling ( of unstrained films ) is important only for small surface separations . for large @xmath155 values ,",

    "the weak segregation treatment we present relies on mean - field theory .",
    "it is valid close to the critical point , but not too close where critical fluctuations become important.@xmath264 we have ignored the deviations of the inter - material dividing surface from the perfect flat shape that occur near the surfaces .",
    "these deviations can be important for small surface separations ( @xmath265 ) , or close to the odt,@xmath266 and should be properly accounted for .    in the second part of the paper we consider bcp film in the strong segregation regime .",
    "in contrast to the weak segregation case , here the surface induced ordering has a finite range of length @xmath201 .",
    "this added length ( taken in the weak segregation limit to be much larger than the film thickness @xmath155 ) results in the existence of two critical fields . provided that the parameter @xmath216 is large enough , @xmath218 [ eq [ 7:deltastar ] ] , for small electric fields , @xmath267 , the film has parallel lamellae . as the field",
    "is increased above @xmath1 but below @xmath3 , a region of size @xmath268 of perpendicular lamellae nucleates in the middle of the film . in this mixed state ,",

    "these diagrams do not take into account the frustration effects caused by a mismatch between the wall separation and the natural lamellar periodicity in the bulk . in this respect , they are qualitatively applicable to non - polymeric systems such as ferrosmectics in magnetic fields,@xmath270 and to bcp in the hexagonal phase , as investigated experimentally .",
    "@xmath271 the difference between the hexagonal and lamellar phase behavior comes from the different value of the depolarization factors @xmath186 , @xmath187 , and different numerical coefficients in eqs .",

    "finally , we have not considered the copolymer density undulations as was done by onuki and fukuda.@xmath259 these might change the boundary lines between the parallel , perpendicular and mixed phases .    the main prediction of this paper is the dependence of the transition fields on the block copolymer film thickness @xmath155 and the phase diagrams of fig .",
    "9 . it will also be of interest to check experimentally under what conditions the mixed state exists .",
    "in addition , the energy penalty @xmath180 of the defect created in the film as well as the difference in surface energies of the two blocks , @xmath272 , can be deduced in experiment from the measured values of @xmath1 , @xmath3 and @xmath237 using eqs .
