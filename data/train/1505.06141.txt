    "photon pairs and heralded single photons are key prerequisites for many schemes in quantum information processing @xcite . making their central frequency and bandwidth compatible to resonances of other physical systems enables a variety of applications , such as efficient quantum memories @xcite , photon - phonon interactions @xcite , and coupling single photons or squeezed light with single atoms @xcite or atomic ensembles @xcite .",
    "it also provides the technology for quantum repeater schemes @xcite that are proposed to enhance long - distance quantum communication @xcite .    presently available single photon sources @xcite do not provide quantum - mechanically pure single - mode optical states with a high tunability in wavelength and bandwidth .",

    "the challenge is to make spontaneous nonlinear conversion both continuously tunable and narrowband to be compatible with quantum memories .    to achieve this we use a triply - resonant cavity .",
    "this scheme increases the efficiency of spontaneous nonlinear conversion processes and provides the narrow bandwidth of the cavity in use .",
    "continuous tuning of the output bandwidth in a triply - resonant whispering - gallery mode resonator is possible @xcite by changing the out - coupling rates .",

    "we use the tunable signal photons ( 790 - ) for addressing the atomic transitions and the corresponding idler photons ( 1064 - ) for heralding at telecom wavelengths . for precise tuning of the signal frequency to the cs d1 line at and the rb d1 line at",
    ", we introduce a set of tuning mechanisms based on mode analysis @xcite of the wgmr spectrum at the pump wavelength .",
    "relying solely on temperature tuning one is limited to discrete solutions of the phase - matching conditions .",
    "we show continuous tuning of the signal frequency across the doppler - broadened absorption line of a cs d1 hyperfine transition by manipulating the evanescent fields of pump , signal , and idler with a movable dielectric substrate .",
    "this continuous frequency - tuning with mhz - precision allows for heralded single photon spectroscopy which we demonstrate at this cs d1 hyperfine transition .",
    "our source of single photons @xcite and squeezed light @xcite is based on natural phase - matching @xcite in a whispering - gallery mode resonator with radius @xmath2 manufactured from a congruent mgo - doped lithium niobate wafer ( see fig . [",

    "[ fig : temperaturetuning](b ) and ( c ) show the stepwise tuning behavior for the fundamental conversion channel around the cs and rb d1 lines , respectively .",
    "these steps originate from the interplay between the discrete eigenresonances and the phase - matching requirements .",
    "phase - matching in wgmrs @xcite is mainly characterized by :    @xmath19    [ eq : phasematch ]    representing energy and momentum conservation , respectively .",
    "the resonance frequencies @xmath20 depend on the temperature t and the distance d between the wgmr and the dielectric substrate controlled with the second piezo actuator .",
    "[ eq : momentumcons ] is equivalent to the conservation of angular momentum for electronic transitions in atomic physics and explains the stepwise tuning behavior in our case .",
    "for small temperature changes we can assume @xmath21 to be linear functions in temperature . if eq .",
    "[ eq : phasematch]a , b are fulfilled for a fixed triplet of modes with @xmath22 and @xmath23 at a given temperature t@xmath24 , then phase - matching for this mode combination is typically allowed only in a narrow interval , i.e. the phase - matching bandwidth around t@xmath24 .",
    "the magnitude of the phase - matching bandwidth is determined by the bandwidths of the three modes and the different slopes of @xmath25 . however , phase - matching for : @xmath26 is allowed according to eq .",
    "[ eq : phasematch]a , b at a temperature t@xmath27 t keeping the same pump mode .",
    "the temperature steps @xmath28 t are determined by the different slopes of @xmath29 and the difference in the respective fsr of signal and idler .     of the pump mode accompanied by a temperature adjustment results in an average change in the signal emission frequency by @xmath30 .",
    "( b ) tuning across the doppler - broadened line is achieved by shifting the resonance frequencies of the pump and the parametric modes with a movable dielectric substrate in the evanescent fields ( we estimate the distance change per applied voltage on the actuator to be ) . ]      for measuring the absolute signal frequency on the mhz scale , we beat the signal with a ti : sapphire reference laser .",
    "this reference laser scans over the approximately @xmath31 wide doppler - broadened cs d1 line in a saturated absorption configuration .",
    "the beat signal then only appears when the frequency difference between the reference laser and the signal is within the detector bandwidth ( pda36a from thorlabs with bandwidth ) .",
    "notably , above the threshold the bandwidth of parametric light @xcite is determined by the pump bandwidth in contrast to the sub - threshold operation when it is determined by the resonator linewidth ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : spdcabs ] and [ fig : spdc]).the atomic line data for cs and @xmath12rb were taken from @xcite . by changing the pump mode azimuthal mode number as : @xmath32",

    "[ fig : temperaturetuning](b , c ) can be covered if an overall tuning of the pump laser over approximately is provided .",
    "furthermore , all conversion channels that are allowed by the phase - matching conditions can be used for tuning to the desired wavelength , which relaxes the requirements on the pump laser tuning .",
    "for example , for our tuning to the rb d1 line we used the non - fundamental conversion channel @xmath15 . here",
    "again we measured the beat signal of the generated signal and the ti : sapphire reference laser at the doppler - broadened @xmath35rb d1 f3-f2 line .",
    "triply - resonant opos offer efficient pdc and narrowband photon pairs under the constraint of the stepwise tuning behavior discussed in the previous section .",
    "an addressing of atomic transitions with arbitrary detuning requires continuous frequency adjustments at the mhz - scale .",
    "we achieve continuous tuning of the phase - matching by combining temperature tuning and the effect of a movable dielectric substrate , i.e. a curved glass substrate coated with highly refractive zinc oxide ( n@xmath36=2.03 at @xcite ) by atomic layer deposition @xcite , within the evanescent fields of the wgmr @xcite .",
    "this does not lead to a reduction of the optical quality factor via out - coupling since the refractive index of the wgmr is higher than the refractive index of the dielectric substrate .",
    "as all three modes , the pump , signal and idler , are affected , we adjust the pump laser frequency to the new phase - matching condition .",
    "in contrast to changing the mode numbers of the three modes , we change their resonance frequencies by @xmath37 while fulfilling the energy conservation requirement given by eq .",
    "[ eq : energycons ] .",
    "thereby , the signal frequency @xmath38 shifts as : @xmath39 an increase in the voltage of the second piezo actuator , which changes the distance between the dielectric and the wgmr , in combination with temperature adjustments allows for continuous tuning of the signal frequency over approximately shown in fig .",

    "this tuning range exceeds the previously reported values of achieved via the electro - optical effect of lithium niobate @xcite , which provides an additional method for fast switching .",
    "in the previous section we show accurate frequency measurements of the generated parametric beams above the opo threshold using the spectral lines as a reference . in the following we",
    "directly show light - atom coupling for the desired single photon states .",
    "the single photon regime @xcite in this wgmr - based opo is reached by reducing the pump power far below the opo threshold @xcite of at the temperature t= with the signal and idler wavelength @xmath40 and @xmath41 , respectively .",

    "[ eq : phasematch]a , b determine the threshold of the pdc process and also the efficiency of the spdc process .",
    "the possibility to fulfill energy conservation ( eq .  [ eq : energycons ] ) for three given modes is highly dependent on the temperature of the wgmr . in fig .",
    "[ fig : spdcabs ] we show the temperature - dependent detuning of the modes from the phase - matching point via the count rates of the signal photons .",

    "it is possible to generate photons in multiple pdc conversion channels at the same time .",
    "this aspect can not be deduced from the above threshold measurements presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : beatmeas ] due to the different working principle of pdc above threshold based on self - seeding and the limited detection range of approximately in the beat signal measurement .",
    "however , the high absorption values of @xmath44{97\\pm3}{\\percent}$ ] for cs and @xmath44{98\\pm4}{\\percent}$ ] for rb show that all signal photons in this measurement were residing within the approximately wide doppler - broadening of the alkali atoms .",
    "single - mode operation @xcite without an additional bandpass filter occurs if the phase - matching temperatures of the most efficient conversion channels are separated by more than the phase - matching bandwidth .",
    "this can in principle be achieved with an adaption of the radius and the curvature of the wgmr .    .",
    "this yields the respective decay time of @xmath45=9.4ns corresponding to a photon bandwidth of @xmath46 .",
