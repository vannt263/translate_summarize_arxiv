    "random graphs are mathematical models commonly used to study real - world networks such as the world - wide web , social , financial , neural , and biological networks .",
    "many real - world networks exhibit the following two properties :    * _ the small - world property : _ distances within the network are very small in comparison to the number of nodes .",
    "with `` small '' we mean distances are at most of order of an iterated logarithm .",
    "some real - world networks are even _ ultra - small , _ meaning that the distances are at most a double logarithm . * _ the scale - free property : _ the number of connections per node behave statistically like a power - law .",
    "this implies that the variation is typically very high .",
    "an example of a random graph model with these properties is the _ norros - reittu random graph _",
    "@xcite ( see figure [ figurenorros ] ) .",
    "this model produces a random graph @xmath1 on a fixed set of vertices @xmath2 , but with a random edge set @xmath3 as follows : every vertex @xmath4 is assigned an i.i.d",
    ".  random weight @xmath5 . conditioned on the weights of its end - vertices ,",
    "the edge @xmath6 is present in @xmath7 with probability @xmath8 , independently of the status of other possible edges ( here @xmath9 is a normalizing constant ) .",
    "see @xcite for more results on inhomogeneous random graphs .",
    "these two properties are important , but the structure of many real - life networks , such as social networks , often have other features that influence the structure and formation of networks :    * _ geometric clustering : _ in social networks this manifests itself because people who are geographically close to each other are more likely to know each other , giving rise to formation of locally concentrated clusters within the network . *",
    "_ hierarchies : _ again in social networks , the more ` important ' people are , the more likely they know other important people , even if those people might be far away , giving rise to hierarchies within the network .",
    "a well - known model that has geometric clustering and the connections over long distances required for the existence of hierarchies is _ long - range percolation _ ( lrp , see figure [ figurelrp ] ) @xcite .",
    "lrp is a percolation model that produces random subgraphs of the graph @xmath10 wherein an edge @xmath11 is ( independently ) _ retained _ with probability @xmath12 for some positive constants @xmath13 and @xmath14 , and removed otherwise .",
    "thus , the connection probabilities are monotonically decreasing in @xmath14 , and increasing in @xmath13 .",
    "for many choices of @xmath15 and @xmath14 , lrp has a _ percolation phase transition _ in @xmath13 , meaning that there exists @xmath16 such that when @xmath17 there exists an infinite cluster almost surely , whereas when @xmath18 , all clusters are almost surely finite . when @xmath19 , this model has the clustering property , as well as something akin to the small - world property @xcite .",
    "it is , however , clearly not scale - free , since the decay of the degree distribution is faster than exponential .",
    "various models have been introduced in the recent years that combine three or four of the network properties described above .",

    "we consider another model that has all four properties : _ scale - free percolation _ ( sfp , also known as _ heterogeneous long - range percolation _ ) .",
    "sfp interpolates between long - range percolation and the norros - reittu random graph ( see figure [ figurescalefree ] ) .",
    "sfp was introduced by deijfen , van der hofstad , and hooghiemstra in @xcite .",
    "we start with a formal definition of the model .",
    "[ sfpdef ] consider the graph @xmath10 for some fixed @xmath20 .",

    "conditionally on the weights , an edge @xmath30 is retained independently of all other edges with probability @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are positive constants of the model .- norm because it is a practical metric , but defining sfp with respect to any @xmath34-norm with @xmath35 $ ] gives qualitatively similar results . ]",
