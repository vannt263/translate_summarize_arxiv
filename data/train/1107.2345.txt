    "hadrons produced in collisions of light and medium size nuclei at collision energies higher than the energy of the onset of deconfinement may freeze - out just below the transition line between hadron gas and qgp .",
    "thus their production properties may be sensitive to properties of the transition .",
    "in particular , freeze - out in the vicinity of the critical point may lead to a characteristic pattern of event - by - event fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "motivated by these predictions na49 and na61/shine at the cern sps as well as star and phenix at the bnl rhic have started a systematic search for the critical point .",
