    "all that remains of blocker duality is the relation @xmath5 , valid for every antichain @xmath1 .",
    "the first question we deal with is : _ what posets have the property that @xmath6 for _ all _ antichains @xmath1 ?",
    "_ such `` strong blocker duality '' is characterized in section 2 .    in @xcite",
    "symmetric antichains and their blockers in the partition lattice @xmath7 play an important role due to their relevance for the theory of subspace arrangements .",
    "the second question we address is : _ how does one compute the blocker of a symmetric antichain in @xmath7 ? _",
    "the answer , presented in section 3 , involves both the dominance and the refinement orderings of number partitions .    in the final section we discuss an algebraic approach to finding minimal size blocking sets to set families that can be realized as families of flats in a geometric lattice realizable over a field .",

    "then , the assertion that @xmath147 has the turn property is equivalent to the assertion that the smallest number of edges in any graph that intersects every @xmath151-clique is attained in a clique graph on @xmath150 cliques . by passing to complements",
    ", one sees that this is precisely the famous turn theorem of graph theory .",
    "it seems reasonable to inquire which antichains have the turn property . in particular ,",
    "if antichains in @xmath7 corresponding to @xmath108-orbits have the turn property , this gives rise to turn type graph theorems .",

    "one sees from theorem [ th : blocker ] that @xmath210 and @xmath211 in @xmath212 .",

    ".     the converse of theorem [ pr : turanideal ] does not hold in general , not even for blockers . a construction of d.  kozlov ( see ( * ? ? ?",

    "moreover , @xmath171 is a blocker in @xmath176 .     a graph - theoretic theorem by simonovits ( * ?",

    "phrased in our language , this means precisely that the antichain @xmath224 in @xmath7 has the turn property . by corollary [ co : hook ] , this antichain is not a blocker ( unless @xmath120 is a hook shape ) , so , by ( 1 ) , its blocker ideal does not equal its vanishing ideal .",
    "thus , we have another example showing that the converse of proposition [ pr : turanideal ] is false .",
    "it is easy to find antichains in @xmath7 that do not satisfy the turn property .",
    "one example is the antichain of any pair of atoms in @xmath225 .",

    "thus , the assertion that @xmath126 has the turn property is equivalent to the assertion that the smallest number of edges in any graph on vertex set @xmath230 $ ] that intersects every complete matching is attained in an @xmath231-clique .",
    "however , a star ( the graph containing every possible edge from a single vertex ) also intersects every complete matching , and the star has fewer edges than the @xmath231-clique if @xmath232 .",
    "we end by describing a class of symmetric antichains with the turn property which is not produced by theorem [ pr : turanideal ] .",
    "let @xmath233 be the finite field on @xmath234 elements , and consider the geometric lattice @xmath235 of all subspaces of @xmath236 ordered by inclusion .",

    "the following proposition is therefore a reformulation of theorem 3.5 in @xcite , which says that a set of points in @xmath240 that intersects every @xmath119-dimensional subspace has cardinality at least @xmath241 ."
