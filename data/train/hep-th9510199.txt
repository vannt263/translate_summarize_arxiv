    "a major goal of theoretical physics is the construction of a self - consistent quantum theory of gravity coupled to matter in four dimensions .",
    "because such a theory has proven to be very difficult to construct , it is interesting to consider toy models of gravity coupled to matter in lower dimensions , in the hope that such simplified theories can provide information about the nature of quantum gravity . in particular , it has been possible to construct consistent quantum theories of ( euclidean ) gravity in two dimensions coupled to conformal matter .",
    "these theories have been the subject of considerable interest over the last decade , partly because they are the simplest available theories of gravity coupled to matter and partly because of the relevance of these models to string theory .",
    "two dimensional gravity theories of this type can be defined either through the continuum liouville theory approach @xcite , or through discrete models of dynamically triangulated gravity ( for reviews see @xcite ) .",
    "the study of discretized two - dimensional gravity theories has a long history @xcite .",
    "a major breakthrough occurred when it was realized that a summation over `` triangulations '' of a 2-manifold by equilateral polygons ( not necessarily triangles ) can be described by a zero - dimensional field theory , or matrix model [ 9 - 14 ] . by writing a discretized 2d gravity theory as an integral over hermitian matrices",
    ", it becomes possible to use analytic methods to calculate correlation functions in these models , and to show that in an appropriate continuum limit these models appear to correspond to continuum theories of liouville gravity coupled to conformal matter field ( for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "the matrix model technology which was developed also made it possible to sum the partition function for these models over riemann surfaces of all genera , giving nonperturbative results for many theories of this type @xcite .",
    "one approach which has been used to analyze matrix model theories involves the use of schwinger - dyson equations @xcite .",
    "these equations , derived by demanding the invariance of the matrix model correlation functions under infinitesimal changes of variables , may be interpreted geometrically as `` loop equations '' describing the deformation of two - dimensional geometries .",
    "the schwinger - dyson / loop equations are a powerful tool for analyzing the algebraic structure of correlation functions , although it has proven difficult to find solutions in more complex theories .",
    "recently , the schwinger - dyson equations for matrix models have been used to discuss @xmath4 string field theories [ 22 - 31 ] . in this paper",
    "we generalize the schwinger - dyson technique , developing a systematic method for deriving a single equation satisfied by the generating function in a very general class of discrete 2d gravity theories .",
    "our approach is based on the combinatorial methods pioneered by tutte @xcite , who found an algebraic description of one class of triangulations by writing a discrete recursion relation for the number of triangulations of a 2-manifold with a fixed number of boundary edges ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "we show how this type of recursion relation can be derived in the presence of discrete data defined on the triangulation , representing matter fields in the continuum . using this technique we are able to describe a variety of theories , including theories such as the recently described dually weighted graph models",
    "@xcite which do not always admit a simple description in terms of matrix models . for matrix model theories , this formalism can be used to describe generating functions for correlation functions with a general class of boundary conditions , which can lead to results which can not be easily obtained through the matrix model formalism .    in theories with matter ,",
    "the generating function for the disk amplitude is a formal sum over all possible matter configurations on the boundary of the triangulations .",
    "we encode boundary data for the matter fields as a string of free ( noncommuting ) variables associated with the matter configuration on the edges or vertices of the boundary . in this way",
    "the generating function is an element of the free algebra generated by the variables representing different matter states .",
    "one of the principal results presented in this paper is the derivation of a `` generating equation , '' satisfied by the generating function .",
    "this generating equation is closely related to the master equation which has recently been discussed by a variety of authors [ 37 - 42 ] .",
    "the generating equation describes the effect of removing a marked edge from a triangulation , which results in one of two basic geometric `` moves ''  the removal of the triangle attached to the edge or , if the edge is connected directly to another boundary edge , the removal of that pair of boundary edges .",
    "in fact , the correspondence between these moves and the generating equation is sufficiently precise that the equation may be written down directly upon consideration of the possible effects of the moves , without going through the intermediate step of an explicit recursion equation .",
    "once we have a single generating equation in terms of noncommuting variables for the correlation functions in the theory , the next step is to try to find a subset of correlation functions for which a closed system of equations can be written in terms of commuting variables .",
    "this is analogous to the technique used in ref .",
    "@xcite to find the cubic equation satisfied by the generating function of homogeneous correlation functions in the @xmath0 matrix model which describes an ising matter field coupled to 2d gravity ; a description of this calculation in terms of noncommuting variables was given in ref .",
    "@xcite . from a polynomial equation of this type",
    "it is straightforward if somewhat tedious to derive information about the scaling behaviour of correlation functions in the continuum limit .",
    "a principal focus of this paper is the development of a systematic approach to finding and solving closed sets of equations in commuting variables starting from the noncommuting generating equation .",
    "we give several examples of polynomial equations which can be derived in this fashion .",
    "in particular , we explicitly solve a 1-parameter family of two - matrix models which may be thought of as the ising model coupled to gravity with a boundary magnetic field .",
    "this family of models includes both the ising theory ( in which ising spins are located on the faces of the triangles ) and its dual model ( in which the spins are located on the vertices of the triangulation ) .",
    "the solution reproduces the cubic equations for the ising and dual theories , and shows that the intermediate models satisfy a quartic .",
    "we also describe the generating equations for the 3-state potts model and the @xmath5-matrix model with @xmath1 which describes @xmath6 ising spins coupled to 2d gravity ; in both of these examples we are unable to find a closed system of equations in commuting variables , and we discuss the obstacles encountered in this approach .",
    "we do not discuss the continuum limit of any of the polynomial equations that are derived in this paper .",
    "all the equations are at most quartic in a single commuting generating function , and contain a finite number of functions that correspond to boundary data for the generating function .",
    "the continuum limit is given by the expansion of the parameters of the theory around their critical values , as governed by the appropriate polynomial equation ; for an example see @xcite .",
    "the continuum limit of some of the more interesting models considered in this paper will be discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the approach we have taken in this paper is to develop the general formalism in a piecewise fashion , introducing each additional complication in the context of a particular model where extra structure is present .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in section 2 we describe the geometric approach used throughout the paper by examining in detail the generating equation for pure triangulated 2d gravity , which can be written in terms of a single variable that encodes boundary information . in section 3 ,",
    "we consider gravity coupled to a single ising spin , and associate boundary configurations with words in a free algebra generated by noncommuting variables .",
    "we derive the cubic equation governing homogeneous boundary configurations in this model .",
    "we also give a generating equation for a more general class of boundary variables in this model which incorporates information about nearest - neighbor spin pairs . in section 4",
    "we study the ising theory on the dual lattice , and derive the cubic equation for the homogeneous disk amplitude in this formulation of the model . in section 5",
    "we find the generating equation for a general two - matrix model with cubic interactions , which includes the ising theory , dual ising theory , and the 1-parameter family of models describing the ising theory with boundary magnetic field .",
    "we also outline the derivation of a quartic equation for the homogeneous disk amplitude in these models .",
    "some of the results mentioned in this section will be described in greater detail in a separate paper @xcite . in section 6",
    "we examine the 3-state potts model , which serves as an example of the obstacles faced by this kind of approach . in section 7 , we describe the generating equation for the theory of triangulated gravity coupled to multiple ising spins ( @xmath1 ) . in section 8 , we consider a more general class of discrete gravity models , and derive the generating equation for a simple dually weighted graph model .",
    "section 9 contains concluding remarks .",
    "in this section we consider pure 2d gravity in the absence of matter fields ; this corresponds to the generic one - matrix model .",
    "we use this simple model to present an introduction to the geometrical techniques that are applied to solve more complex models in subsequent sections .",
    "we derive the well known equation for the disk amplitude generating function , in the case of cubic interactions @xcite .",
    "although the generating function in this model is written in terms of a single commuting variable , we show how this result may be written in a form that generalizes to free variables .",
    "finally , we derive a more elaborate system of generating equations for higher - genus amplitudes .      the partition function for pure 2d gravity",

    "the correspondence with the matrix model language is that @xmath26 is equal to the number of planar diagrams ( up to symmetry factors ) with @xmath27 trivalent vertices and @xmath6 external legs ; these may be thought of as the dual graphs to the triangulations .",
    "thus , @xmath25 is given by the matrix model expectation value @xmath28 so that @xmath29 ( note : in this paper all matrix model expectation values are evaluated in the large @xmath13 limit . )",
    "there are two simple ways to solve for the function @xmath23 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a recursion relation is derived for the number of triangulations in which no two edges join the same pair of vertices , no internal edge is connected to two external vertices , and no two triangles have three vertices in common . from the point of view of the dual graphs ,",
    "this is equivalent to demanding that the graphs be built from connected , one - particle irreducible diagrams with no self - energy corrections to the propagator .",
    "similar recursion relations are discussed in ref .",
    "alternatively , @xmath23 can be evaluated by computing the functional integral over matrices . in this case , all feynman graphs are summed over automatically , and the coefficients of @xmath23 can be obtained by saddle point methods or by the method of orthogonal polynomials @xcite .",
    "although the numerical values of the coefficients @xmath30 are different in the tutte and matrix model schemes , the universal behaviour of @xmath23 ( which governs the continuum limit ) is the same .",
    "we shall follow tutte in deriving recursion equations for the number of triangulations , but we adopt the matrix model conventions for counting : our dual graphs need not be connected nor one - particle irreducible , and we allow self - energy corrections to the propagator .",
    "we now proceed to derive a recursion relation for the coefficients @xmath30 , which leads to a single generating equation satisfied by @xmath23 .",
    "we consider a triangulation of a disk @xmath31 with @xmath27 triangles and @xmath6 external edges , one of which is marked .",
    "the given triangulation can be disassembled step by step , by repeatedly removing the marked edge and marking a new edge on the resulting , smaller triangulation .",
    "( a similar approach has been used recently to derive a discrete hamiltonian operator for string field theory in the proper time gauge @xcite . ) each time a marked edge is removed , this has the effect of either removing a triangle , or removing a pair of boundary edges . in this way",
    ", for each triangulation there is a unique sequence of `` moves '' reducing to the trivial triangulation , a single dot . by considering all possible sequences of moves",
    ", we can recursively count the number of triangulations @xmath30 .",
    "some conventions are necessary to make the recursion relations well - defined .",
    "when the marked edge is a boundary of a triangle , one removes the triangle attached to the edge ; the resulting triangulation has one less triangle , but one additional edge .",
    "we use a convention that marks the edge which was counterclockwise from the original marked edge in the triangle that was removed ( see fig . [",
    "f : remtri ] ) . in the case where the marked boundary edge is connected to another boundary edge , one should remove the pair of edges , leaving two triangulations . on each of the remaining triangulations , we choose the convention of marking the edge next to edge which was just removed ( see fig .",
    "[ f : remedges ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ f : apart ] , we illustrate the results that can be obtained upon removing various possible marked edges from a simple triangulation .",
    "the number of triangulations with @xmath27 triangles and @xmath6 boundary edges is therefore equal to the number with one fewer triangle and one additional edge , plus the sum of all possible combinations of two triangulations with the same number of triangles but a total of two fewer boundary edges : @xmath32 in order that this recursion relation completely determine @xmath33 , it is necessary to impose boundary conditions : there is one trivial triangulation , so that @xmath34 , and in addition we specify that @xmath35 for all @xmath36 .",
    "these conditions suffice to recover the counting of the matrix model .    using ( [ eq : gf ] ) , it is straightforward to rewrite ( [ eq : rr ] ) as an equation for the generating function @xmath23 : @xmath37 the first term on the right hand side of ( [ eq : ge ] ) fixes the boundary condition @xmath38 .",
    "the second term corresponds to the first term in ( [ eq : rr ] ) , and represents the removal of a triangle , as in fig .",
    "[ f : remtri ] ; the negative terms are subtracted from @xmath23 since no move that removes a triangle can result in a triangulation with fewer than two edges .",
    "the third term corresponds to the second term in ( [ eq : rr ] ) .",
    "it is important to note that ( [ eq : ge ] ) can not be solved for @xmath39 directly , since it contains the function @xmath40 which is a boundary condition for @xmath23 that must be computed separately",
    ". equations of this general form have been studied extensively in the literature , and it is possible to show that the requirement that @xmath23 have a well defined power series expansion in @xmath41 and @xmath12 around the origin is sufficient to completely determine the power series @xmath40 from ( [ eq : ge ] ) .",
    "we refer the reader to refs .",
    "@xcite for details of this procedure for the present example , and for the more complicated cases that we shall encounter in later sections .",
    "the generating equation ( [ eq : ge ] ) may be written more compactly by introducing a special derivative operator , which will turn out to be useful in more complicated matrix models where @xmath39 will be a function of free variables .",
    "we define the operation of @xmath42 on a polynomial in @xmath41 so that it removes one power of @xmath41 from terms proportional to @xmath43 ( without introducing a factor of @xmath6 ) , and annihilates terms which are independent of @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "thus , @xmath44 such an operator does not obey the usual leibniz rule ; rather , @xmath45 using this definition , we have @xmath46 and ( [ eq : ge ] ) reduces to @xmath47    in this notation , the correspondence between the terms in the generating equation and the graphical representation of the basic moves becomes precise , in the sense that every symbol appearing in eq .",
    "( [ eq : nge ] ) has a direct interpretation . on the right hand side",
    "there are three terms , corresponding to a boundary condition , the move which removes a triangle , and the move which removes two identified boundary edges ; each of these three types of terms will appear in the more elaborate generating equations we present in the remainder of the paper .",
    "the right hand side of each such equation will begin with a one , which sets the number of triangulations with no boundary edges equal to one .",
    "the terms corresponding to removal of a triangle will have a factor of the weight for a single triangle ( in this case , @xmath12 ) and an operation in free variables ( in this case , @xmath48 ) which represents replacing the single marked edge with two new edges .",
    "may seem to suggest replacing two edges with a single one , rather than the other way around .",
    "this is merely because we have been using language in which the triangulations represented by @xmath39 are disassembled step by step , rather than being built up from nothing ; but either sense is equally legitimate . ] the terms corresponding to removing two identified boundary edges will contain a variable for each boundary edge ( in this case , two factors of @xmath41 ) and two functions ( in this case , two factors of @xmath39 ) representing the two triangulations that remain after the removal of the boundary edges . in more complicated models these terms may be multiplied by coupling constants representing the interaction between matter fields , as we shall see in the next section .",
    "( [ eq : nge ] ) is closely related to the schwinger - dyson equation for the 1-matrix model , which can be written as @xmath49 it is easy to see that acting by @xmath42 on ( [ eq : nge ] ) yields ( [ eq:1msd ] ) .",
    "the generating equation includes the information contained within the schwinger - dyson equation , as well as additional boundary conditions .",
    "this will continue to be the case for more complicated theories described by multi - matrix models , where we shall derive a single equation equivalent to the entire set of schwinger - dyson equations plus boundary conditions .",
    "it is reasonably straightforward to extend the recursion relation ( [ eq : rr ] ) from the disk amplitude to an amplitude for a higher genus surface with an arbitrary number of boundaries .",
    "we imagine that the set of boundaries is ordered , and that each one has a marked edge , and derive a recursion equation by removing the marked edge on the first boundary loop .",
    "the number of triangulations of a surface with genus @xmath15 and with @xmath50 boundaries , represented by @xmath51 with all @xmath52 , is given by the equation @xmath53 where @xmath54 in the second term represents the set of all permutations of @xmath55 such that @xmath56 and @xmath57 , and we set @xmath58 when any of the @xmath59 s are zero ( except that , as before , @xmath60 ) .",
    "once again , each term in this expression has a geometric interpretation ( see fig [ f : topology ] ) .",
    "the first term on the right hand side corresponds to the removal of a single triangle ( fig [ f : topology]a ) , while the remaining three correspond to the removal of an identified pair of boundary edges .",
    "the second term is related to the second term in ( [ eq : rr ] ) , derived from the splitting of a single triangulation into all possible combinations of two ( fig [ f : topology]b ) .",
    "the third term corresponds to the removal of two identified edges which belong to different boundary components ; the result is to decrease the number of boundaries by one ( fig [ f : topology]c ) .",
    "the last term comes from the removal of two identified edges belonging to the same boundary component , such that the resulting triangulation does not split into two ; the result is to increase the number of boundaries by one , while decreasing the genus by one ( fig [ f : topology]d ) .",
    "one can define generating functions @xmath61 for triangulations of a surface with @xmath50 boundaries of arbitrary genus .",
    "it is now possible to convert the recurrence relation ( [ highergenusrec ] ) into an equation that relates amplitudes for surfaces of arbitrary genus with different numbers of boundaries : @xmath62   \\labell{eq : geg }   \\\\    & & +     h u_1 ^ 2 \\sum_{j=2}^b    \\phi^{(b+1)}(u_1 , \\ldots , u_{j-1},u_1,u_{j } , \\ldots , u_{b},g , h)\\ , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath54 is defined as before , the operator @xmath63 is defined by @xmath64 and @xmath65 is an ordinary derivative operator .",
    "equation ( [ eq : geg ] ) is useful in part because it contains a set of linear relations that permit an iterative solution for generating functions of arbitrary genus and with an arbitrary number of surfaces starting from the solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ge ] ) for the disk .",
    "for example , the simplest relation contained in that equation is obtained by projecting out the genus zero component @xmath66 and taking @xmath67 .",
    "this gives a relation between the disk and cylinder generating functions ( the @xmath66 components @xmath68 and @xmath69 of @xmath70 and @xmath71 ) : @xmath72 another simple relation exists between the generating functions for the disk , the cylinder and the single - boundary torus ( the @xmath73 component taking @xmath74 ) : @xmath75 this procedure may be continued to obtain equations for arbitrary genus and number of boundary components .",
    "we now consider 2d gravity coupled to the ising model .",
    "this model corresponds to the @xmath0 minimal model cft coupled to liouville gravity , and has a simple description as a two - matrix model . as in the previous section ,",
    "most of the results we describe here have long been understood in terms of the matrix model description of the theory ; the novelty of our presentation lies in the purely geometric derivation of a single generating equation written in terms of noncommuting variables .",
    "the coupling of the ising model to gravity is described by summing over all triangulations of a closed 2-manifold just as in the pure gravity model .",
    "now , however , each triangle carries a label @xmath21 or @xmath76 , corresponding to ising spins up or down respectively .",
    "the weight of a given triangulation @xmath17 is defined to be @xmath77 where the notation is the same as in ( [ eq : pgpf ] ) , with the addition of a new coupling constant @xmath78 ; @xmath79 is the number of edges in @xmath17 separating two @xmath21 triangles , and similarly for @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "the coupling @xmath78 is related to the usual ising model coupling @xmath82 by @xmath83 we use @xmath78 rather than @xmath82 because this is the natural notation in the description of the theory as a 2-matrix model , with partition function given by @xcite @xmath84 with @xmath85 where @xmath21 and @xmath76 are @xmath22 hermitian matrices .",
    "we would like to analyze the generating function associated with a disk , as in the pure gravity theory discussed in section 2 .",
    "however , in this model it is necessary to specify the configuration of ising spins on the boundary rather than just the number of edges .",
    "thus , we must associate with each boundary a length @xmath86 , and a string of @xmath86 labels , each of which is either a @xmath41 or a @xmath87 .",
    "these labels may be thought of as spins lying _ outside _ the boundary of the triangulation , meaning that each boundary edge contributes a weight @xmath88 or @xmath89 depending on whether the spin on the boundary edge is the same as or different from the spin on the triangle adjacent to that edge ; although this may seem to be a counterintuitive convention , it will simplify the following analysis . by choosing an orientation and a marked edge on the boundary",
    ", we have a natural ordering to the boundary labels ; this ordering is given by beginning with the marked edge and proceeding around the boundary .",
    "it is now natural to consider @xmath41 and @xmath87 as noncommuting variables ; the generating function for the disk can then be written as ( throughout this section we suppress the dependence of @xmath39 on the couplings @xmath90 and the noncommuting variables @xmath91 ) @xmath92 the coefficients @xmath93 represent the disk amplitude for triangulations with boundary condition specified by @xmath94 , a word in the free algebra generated by @xmath41 and @xmath87 ( _ i.e. _ , an ordered product of @xmath41 s and @xmath87 s ) .",

    "we can now , as in the previous section , use purely geometrical arguments to derive a single generating equation satisfied by @xmath39 , taking advantage of the interpretation discussed after eq .",
    "( [ eq : nge ] ) to write down the generating equation directly , without first deriving a recursion relation .",
    "we have associated the first symbol in a word @xmath100 with a marked edge on the boundary of a triangulation .",
    "if we remove this edge , then as in the pure gravity case there are two possibilities : either the edge is identified with another edge of the boundary ( which must also be removed ) , or the edge is attached to a triangle which can be removed .",
    "unlike the pure gravity case , however , in each of these cases there are multiple possible spin configurations which must be included .",

    "a diagrammatic description of the fourth and eighth terms inside the brackets is given in figure  [ f : diagram48 ] .",

    "now that we have a single generating equation describing the set of all disk amplitudes , we would like to find a closed form solution for @xmath39 in terms of noncommuting variables .",

    "but the result of performing such operations on the right hand sides is already contained in the other equations in this set ( [ eq:3sp7 ] ) , so there must be a consistency condition , reducing the number of independent equations by one . on the other hand , the two equations for @xmath236 and @xmath237 do not share this problem , since the right hand side of the equation for @xmath237 contains @xmath238 and @xmath239 , and the act of removing an edge from the triangulations represented by these quantities is not contained in the seven equations . we therefore are left with six equations in seven unknowns , insufficient to find a single equation for @xmath115 .    by expanding the set of unknowns to include the three additional quantities ( @xmath240 , @xmath241 , @xmath242 ) , we can derive four additional equations : @xmath243 but once again , there is an additional consistency condition which reduces the number of independent equations by one . in this case",
    ", we have introduced equations with @xmath238 and @xmath239 on the left hand sides , which leads to another condition on the moves represented by the @xmath236 and @xmath237 equations , as discussed above .",
    "we are therefore still left with one fewer equation than unknowns .",
    "as far as we can determine , this will continue to be the case no matter how many additional equations we introduce , although we have not been able to find a general proof of this fact .",
    "it remains an open question whether some other method of solution can yield information about this model from the generating equation ( [ eq:3spgen ] ) .",
    "the major limitation on the usefulness of matrix models is the fact that no known methods for solving matrix models apply to theories with central charge @xmath244 . since the systems of the greatest physical interest fall into this category , the `` @xmath245 wall '' has always been a major obstacle in the further understanding of 2d gravity and string theories .",
    "however , the fact that it is difficult to integrate out angular degrees of freedom in matrix models with @xmath246 has always seemed to be a rather technical problem , and it has been unclear whether some other method might make it possible to find analytic results or solutions for systems with larger central charge .    in this section",
    "we shall discuss a class of matrix models formed by taking @xmath6 independent ising spins coupled to quantum gravity .",
    "the model with @xmath6 spins corresponds to a cft with @xmath1 coupled to gravity , and can be described as a @xmath5-matrix model .",
    "we analyze the 4-matrix model corresponding to the 2-spin @xmath245 cft coupled to gravity . as was the case with the 3-state potts model",
    ", we find that it seems to be impossible to find a closed system of equations describing the disk amplitude .",
    "the multiple spin ising theory is defined in a manner precisely analogous to the ising theory in section [ sec : ising ] , except that each triangle carries @xmath6 independent ising spins .",
    "thus , in the language of triangulations , we sum over all triangulations @xmath17 where each triangle carries @xmath6 spins @xmath247 .",
    "we set the interaction energy to be identical for each type of spin , so that the weight of a given triangulation @xmath17 is given by @xmath248 where @xmath227 is the total number of adjacent pairs of unequal spins with the same index , and @xmath78 is the interaction between unequal spins ( note that we the normalization factor @xmath249 is moved into the matrix model action for convenience in this section ) .",
    "the matrix model description of this partition function is given by an integral over @xmath5 matrices @xmath250 , where @xmath251 : @xmath252 with @xmath253\\ .",
    "\\labell{eq : msmact}\\ ] ] by the same geometric argument as has been used throughout the paper , we can write a generating equation for the disk amplitude as a function of free noncommuting variables @xmath254 which takes the very simple form @xmath255      for simplicity , we shall restrict attention for the remainder of this section to the 2-spin model with @xmath245 .",
    "this 4-matrix model has a continuum limit which can be identified with the orbifold @xmath245 bosonic string at radius @xmath256 @xcite .",
    "labeling the 4 matrices according to their binary representations for shorthand ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath257 , @xmath258 , @xmath259 , @xmath260 ) , the matrix model action is given by @xmath261 - \\frac{g}{3 } \\sum_{i=0}^3 \\tr x_i^3 \\ ,    \\ ] ] with @xmath262 the generating equation ( [ eq : generaldisk ] ) becomes @xmath263 as for the 3-state potts model , it appears not to be possible to derive a single algebraic equation for the homogeneous disk amplitude from this equation .",
    "once again , however , we do not have any proof that this must be the case",
    ". however , it seems unlikely that any algebraic equation for the homogeneous disk amplitude exists in view of the logarithmic behavior of other previously studied @xmath245 models .",
    "it is nevertheless conceivable that some other means of analyzing the generating equation ( [ eq : generating2 ] ) could lead to a single equation characterizing @xmath115 .",
    "furthermore , we mention the promising result that all coefficients @xmath264 can be determined in terms of the three coefficients @xmath265 , @xmath266 , @xmath267 , just as in the ising theory where only two such coefficients were necessary .",
    "presumably , however , any method for solving the @xmath245 model would not generalize to the @xmath1 models with @xmath268 since the number of unknowns in the higher @xmath6 models grows much faster than when @xmath269 .",
    "so far in this paper , all of the specific models which we have considered have simple descriptions in terms of the matrix model formalism ( although we described a class of boundary conditions for the ising theory in section  [ sec : boundarycorrelation ] which can not easily be described using matrix model methods ) .",
    "however , the methodology we have developed is applicable to a much wider class of discrete gravity models . in general , we can construct discrete matter fields by endowing a dynamical triangulation with an arbitrary set of local discrete data .",
    "for example , we can simultaneously give discrete labels ( @xmath270 , @xmath271 , @xmath272 ) to faces ( polygons ) , edges , and vertices of a triangulation .",
    "if we make the weight function local , in the sense that the only interactions are between adjacent faces , edges , and vertices , then the partition function corresponding to such a theory is of the form @xmath273\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is a set of combinatorial data @xmath274 on the simplices in a triangulation @xmath17 ; @xmath275 is a function of the geometry and labels of a fixed face @xmath124 and the edges and vertices on its boundary ; similarly @xmath276 is a function of a fixed edge @xmath186 , the faces of which @xmath186 is a boundary , and the vertices on the boundary of @xmath87 ; and @xmath277 is a function of a vertex @xmath87 and the edges and faces of which it is a boundary .    a generating equation can be derived for a model of the general form ( [ eq : general ] ) by associating independent noncommuting variables with the discrete labels on edges , vertices , and faces .",
    "although the complexity of such an equation will increase significantly as the set of discrete matter fields increases , in principle the methods of this paper can provide an approach to the analysis of any such theory .",
    "a particular set of theories in this more general class are the `` dually weighted graph '' models recently studied by di  francesco and itzykson @xcite and by kazakov , staudacher , and wynter @xcite . in these models ,",
    "weights are associated with vertices of a triangulation according to the coordination number , and weights are associated with the faces of a triangulation according to the number of incident edges as in a general one - matrix model .",
    "the dually weighted graph models are of particular interest because they contain continuous families of theories which interpolate between conformal field theories on flat space and conformal field theories completely coupled to liouville gravity .",
    "although it is possible to construct most dually weighted graph models as matrix models by introducing external matrices encoding the vertex weights , the resulting models are rather unwieldy and difficult to solve by standard matrix model techniques .",
    "an example of a model which can be analyzed using matrix model methods is the model where vertices of both the original and dual graph are restricted to have even coordination number @xcite .",
    "we now derive the generating equation for a general dually weighted graph model .",
    "the most general dually weighted graph model has a weight of @xmath278 for every face with @xmath279 edges , and a weight of @xmath280 for every vertex with coordination number @xmath279 .",
    "thus , the partition function for a general dually weighted graph model is given by @xmath281 \\ ] ] where @xmath282 is the number of @xmath279-gon faces in @xmath17 and @xmath283 is the number of vertices with coordination number @xmath279 .",
    "to describe the generating function for the disk amplitude of this model , we must associate noncommuting variables with the vertices on the boundary of the disk .",
    "these noncommuting variables must contain information about the coordination number of the vertex , as well as the number of faces inside the disk which are incident on that vertex .",
    "thus , we choose variables @xmath284 , with @xmath285 to denote a vertex with @xmath279 interior faces and a coordination number of @xmath286 .",
    "( an example is shown in figure  [ f : dwg ] . )",
    "the generating equation for the general dually weighted graph model is @xmath287 where we have defined @xmath288    as an extremely simple example , let us consider a `` flat space '' dually weighted graph model where only hexagonal faces and vertices with coordination number 3 are allowed ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath289 ; @xmath290 ) .",
    "this is simply a theory of `` triangulations '' of flat surfaces by hexagons ; each term in the disk amplitude for this theory corresponds to a closed path on the honeycomb lattice which bounds an embedded oriented surface composed of hexagons .",
    "the generating equation for this model reduces to ( writing @xmath291 ) @xmath292 x_2 ( \\partial_1 \\phi ) \\\\ & & + x_2 \\left [ x_2 ( \\partial_1 \\phi ) x_2 + x_1 ( \\partial_0 \\phi ) x_2 + x_2 ( \\partial_0 \\phi ) x_1 \\right ] x_1 ( \\partial_0 \\phi ) \\\\ & & + x_1 \\left [ x_2 ( \\partial_1 \\phi ) x_2 + x_1 ( \\partial_0 \\phi ) x_2 + x_2 ( \\partial_0 \\phi ) x_1 \\right ] x_2 ( \\partial_0 \\phi).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    there are a number of slightly more interesting models which are very simple to describe , and which connect flat space theories such as the above with fluctuating 2d gravity theories which presumably correspond to coupling in some form of matter fields .",
    "for example , consider the theory with only square faces , and vertices of coordination number between 3 and 5 defined by @xmath293 when @xmath294 , this is simply another flat space theory . as @xmath295 and @xmath50 become nonzero , fluctuations are introduced .",
    "it should be possible by tuning the ratio @xmath296 to find a 1-parameter family of theories which correspond to a continuous limit ; any detailed understanding of the behavior of this class of theories would be extremely interesting for understanding the effects of coupling dynamical gravity to a flat theory . the generating equation for this model is simply the restriction of ( [ eq : general ] ) to the theory with weights ( [ eq : squares ] )",
    ".    it would be interesting to see whether for these simple models there is any reasonable algebraic method for extracting information from the generating equation .",
    "we have developed a systematic method for analyzing discretized theories of 2d gravity with matter .",
    "our method combines a geometric / combinatorial approach with the tools of free variables and loop equations which have previously been used to study matrix models .",
    "although this approach gives rise to equations which are essentially equivalent to the schwinger - dyson loop equations for standard matrix model theories , our results are more general in several ways .",
    "first , because our methodology is completely based on a geometric definition of the discrete gravity theories , the analysis applies to models which can not be described in terms of the matrix model language .",
    "second , we can describe correlation functions in standard matrix model theories using variables which are apparently inaccessible using the matrix model formalism . for example , in @xcite we describe the calculation using our techniques of the exact correlation function between disorder operators in the ising theory .",
    "as far as we have been able to ascertain , this correlation function can not be computed in any simple way using matrix model methods . finally , we believe that the principal result presented in this paper , the general single generating equation for the generating function of all disk amplitudes , represents a conceptual and algebraic simplification and synthesis of previous work in this direction .",
    "the methods we have presented here have enabled us to analyze in a systematic fashion a variety of models describing 2d gravity with matter fields .",
    "one question which has never been fully resolved is the question of which matrix models allow solution by loop equation methods . to date , the only theories which have proven tractable using this approach have been the pure gravity and @xmath0 models .",
    "we have found that it is possible to use this approach to derive polynomial equations satisfied by the generating function of disk amplitudes not only in the standard ising formulation of the @xmath0 theory , but also in the dual formulation , and even in a continuous family of models connecting these two formulations .",
    "in addition , we have found that a very general class of two - matrix models , which _ can not _ be solved by orthogonal polynomials , have uniform boundary condition disk amplitude generating functions which satisfy a quartic .",
    "we have attempted to solve several other models using these methods , including the 3-state potts model and the @xmath245 model defined by two ising spins coupled to gravity .",
    "we have found that these models resist solution , in accordance with the empirical belief that models whose target graphs contain loops somehow have more intrinsic degrees of freedom , and are not soluble by loop equations or algebraic means .",
    "however , in our attempt to solve these equations , we uncovered algebraic structure to the obstruction , characterized by degeneracies in subsets of the loop equations .",
    "this algebraic structure may give some hint of how to use other approaches to solve these models .",
    "in the discrete theories that we have considered , the existence of a single equation describing the effect of all possible moves that reduce a triangulation suggests that this equation should be related to a hamiltonian operator for the theory . in this context",
    "it would be interesting to consider the continuum limit of the equation in terms of noncommuting variables and see if can be related to recent attempts to construct string field hamiltonians for theories with @xmath297 [ 22 - 30 ] .",
    "the approach we have detailed here simplifies the calculation of correlation functions in a variety of interesting 2d theories .",
    "some particular results along these lines will be described in @xcite . however , the major conceptual issue which needs to be dealt with for these methods to be applicable in a truly general context is the development of some more sophisticated and powerful methods for dealing with algebraic equations in noncommuting variables such as ( [ eq : generateising ] ) .",
    "this is a very difficult problem , as has been emphasized in a number of recent papers @xcite ; however , in these works and others some progress has been made , giving hope that in the future these equations may seem more tractable .",
