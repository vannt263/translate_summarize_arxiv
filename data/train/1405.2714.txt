    "this article studies the dynamics of two massive bodies of finite extent subject to their mutual gravitational attraction .",
    "we assume that one of the bodies , the primary , has a mass much greater than the other , the satellite , and that the primary body is spherically symmetric .",
    "the problem is then equivalent to the dynamics of a single rigid body in a central gravitational field .",
    "this system has the mathematical structure of a hamiltonian system with symmetries .",
    "the symmetry assumption allows for considerable simplifications and provides a valuable approximation from which additional effects can be further studied using perturbation theory .    in the traditional approach to this problem ( see @xcite ) , the additional assumption that the motion of the center of mass of the satellite is unaffected by the finite extent of the body was frequently used .",
    "that is , the orbit described by the center of mass of the satellite is the same as if the satellite were replaced by a point mass .",
    "this further assumption is known in the literature as the _ restricted problem_. in our geometric approach",
    "we will not adopt this assumption , we will consider the full coupling of the system , or _",
    "unrestricted problem_.    since the global dynamics of this system may be very complicated we will focus on the study of its relative equilibria , which are dynamical evolution orbits which are contained in group orbits . relative equilibria act as organizing centers for the dynamics of a hamiltonian system with symmetries and therefore the study of the set of relative equilibria gives important information about the qualitative behavior of the dynamical flow . there are several classical studies on the coupling between orbital and attitude motion for the satellite motion but in most of them the natural geometric and group - theoretic properties of the problem are not fully exploited .",
    "the first geometric treatment of this system is @xcite , where poisson reduction and the energy - casimir method were the main tools employed in giving a full description of relative equilibria for large orbits . in this article",
    "we will extend that work to the low - orbit regime , and in particular we provide an analytic description of the complete set of relative equilibria that exist for small values of the orbital radius .",
    "one novelty of our geometric treatment is that we also study the axisymmetric case , where in addition to the spatial rotational symmetry there is a @xmath0 body symmetry corresponding to rotations about a symmetry axis of the satellite .",
    "this also expands the work of @xcite , where only the spatial rotational symmetry was considered .",
    "this axisymmetric case has been previously studied in @xcite using the energy - casimir method , whereas we treat this case via the reduced energy momentum method .    for both the asymmetric and axisymmetric cases",
    "we have found a complete description of all the existing relative equilibria families . in the axisymmetric case",
    "we have shown that a family of conical equilibria exists for arbitrary large orbits .",
    "this is a new family of relative equilibria that does not seem to have been described in the literature before .",
    "in fact , in @xcite , based on routhian reduction and numerical continuations , it is suggested that there were no conical equilibria for large orbits but that conclusion is due to the fact that their continuation path only detected the conical equilibria for very small orbits . had they used a different continuation path they would have found the conical equilibria .

    "our main instability result will be the following .",
    "we will combine symplectic eigenvalue analysis and the reduced energy momentum splitting . the linearized vector field with respect to a symplectic slice ( see @xcite ) is an infinitesimally symplectic transformation with eigenvalues coming in @xmath367-tuples .",

    "moreover the sign of the determinant of the linearized field has to be equal to the sign of the determinant of @xmath379 .",

    "combining the reduced energy momentum and the results of @xcite it can be shown that if @xmath322 is a relative equilibrium with discrete stabilizer such that both the arnold form and the smale form are non - degenerate then there is a family of dimension @xmath385 of relative equilibria containing @xmath323 and all the relative equilibria near @xmath323 lie in that family .",

    "the previous result implies that at a bifurcation point the arnold form or the smale form must be degenerate . therefore the points which are candidates for the existence of a bifurcation are those points at which at least one of these forms becomes degenerate .",
