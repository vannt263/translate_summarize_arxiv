    "toward the improved magnetic - properties of the nd - fe - b permanent magnet , one of important technologies is the hydrogenation of nd@xmath0fe@xmath1b , which is employed in the so - called hddr ( hydrogenation , disproportionation , desorption , recombination ) process@xcite .",
    "the hddr - processed magnet possesses a submicron grain - size , contributing a higher coercivity .",
    "h@xmath0 atmosphere with rather low pressure ( @xmath5 1 atm ) is introduced in the hydrogenation process .",
    "after the heat - treatment at 750 @xmath5 900 @xmath2c for 30 min @xmath5 3 h , the magnet disproportionates into nd hydride ( ndh@xmath3 ) , @xmath4-fe and fe@xmath0b .",
    "several groups have reported the reactive milling of nd - fe - b powder under hydrogen at room temperature@xcite .",
    "the mechanical activation of nd - fe - b powder leads to the decomposion into ndh@xmath3 and @xmath4-fe , although we need high pressure of h@xmath0 gas ( @xmath5 1 mpa ) .",
    "these studies motivated us to investigate the conventional hydrogenation of nd - fe - b under a high pressure of h@xmath0 gas , which has not been reported . in this study , we have studied the hydrogenation of nd - fe - b under a high pressure of hydrogen .",
    "we used a commercial nd - fe - b magnet .",
    "the ground magnet powder , after demagnetization , weighting approximately 0.45 g were placed in a home - made cell with the volume of about 7.5 cc . after evacuating the cell",
    ", we introduced h@xmath0 gas of 0.45 mpa .",
    "the cell was heated to the temperature ranging from 500 @xmath2c to 600@xmath2c , taking 2 h , by an electric furnace , and kept at that temperature for 6 to 84 h , followed by a furnace - cooling .",
    "the heat - treated samples were evaluated using the powder x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) pattern ( cu - k@xmath4 radiation ) .",
    "we also hydrogenated nd - fe - b powder in a continuous h@xmath0 gas flow at 600@xmath2c for 12 h , in which the heating and cooling rates are the same as those in the above - mentioned hydrogenation process .",
    "c . the xrd pattern of nd - fe - b ingot is also shown . ]",
    "the xrd patterns of samples heat - treated at 500@xmath2c for 12 and 24 h are shown in fig .  1 , where the pattern of nd - fe - b ingot is also exhibited . the pattern of nd - fe - b ingot is mainly composed of nd@xmath0fe@xmath1b in addition to the minor phase of ndfe@xmath6b@xmath6 . the peaks of nd@xmath0fe@xmath1b in the samples heat - treated at 500@xmath2c",
    "are shifted to lower 2@xmath7 values compared to those of the starting ingot .",
    "this implies the lattice expansion of nd@xmath0fe@xmath1b due to the insertion of hydrogen@xcite .",
    "the decomposition of nd@xmath0fe@xmath1b does not occur because of no appearance of @xmath4-fe , which is confirmed by further extending the heat - treatment time to 84 h. the ndh@xmath3 phase denoted by triangles would be generated from a nd - rich phase@xcite .",
    "c . ]    fig .",
    "1 also shows the xrd patterns of samples heat - treated at 550@xmath2c for 12 and 36 h. the shift of peaks of nd@xmath0fe@xmath1b does not occur in each sample , indicating no insertion of hydrogen in nd@xmath0fe@xmath1b .",
    "although nd@xmath0fe@xmath1b is not completely decomposed , the simultaneous appearance of ndh@xmath3 and @xmath4-fe means the partial hydrogenation of nd@xmath0fe@xmath1b .    as shown in fig .  2 , the hydrogenation of nd@xmath0fe@xmath1b proceeds by increasing the heat - treatment temperature to 575@xmath2c .",
    "the peaks of ndh@xmath3 and @xmath4-fe phases dominate over those of unreacted nd@xmath0fe@xmath1b and ndfe@xmath6b@xmath6 , which is observed throughout the heat - treatment time of interest .",
    "c . ]    at the heat - treatment temperature of 600@xmath2c for longer than 12 h , the almost complete decomposition of nd@xmath0fe@xmath1b is observed ( see fig .",
    "we can not say whether the fe@xmath0b phase , which is detected after the disproportionation in the hddr process , exists or not . to investigate the effect of high - pressure h@xmath0 gas ,",
    "we have carried out the hydrogenation of nd - fe - b in a continuous h@xmath0 gas flow .",
    "the xrd pattern of the sample is shown at the top of fig .",
    "we have found that , even at the heat - treatment temperature lower than that in typical hddr process , the complete decomposition of nd@xmath0fe@xmath1b into ndh@xmath3 and @xmath4-fe can be achieved for the prolonged heat - treatment time .",
    "however the peak intensity of ndh@xmath3 is very weak compared to that in samples hydrogenated under high h@xmath0-pressure .",
    "in addition , nd@xmath0o@xmath8 phase is detected ( see arrows in fig .  3 ) . during the furnace - cooling",
    ", some hydrogen might desorb from ndh@xmath3 transforming into nd@xmath0o@xmath8 . on the other hand",
    ", the samples hydrogenated under high h@xmath0-pressure do not show the desorption of hydrogen after the furnace - cooling .",
    "we have investigated the hydrogenation of nd - fe - b powder under the high pressure of hydrogen .",
    "the hydrogenation of nd@xmath0fe@xmath1b proceeds almost completely at the heat - treatment temperature of 600@xmath2c , although the prolonged heat - treatment time is necessary for the sufficient decomposition of nd@xmath0fe@xmath1b ."
