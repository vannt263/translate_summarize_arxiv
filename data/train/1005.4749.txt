    "a field theoretical calculation @xcite predicts a single irrelevant scaling field with the rg exponent @xmath147 .",
    "these corrections to scaling are related with the extrapolation length , which was introduced in the context of mean - field theory ; see the review @xcite .",
    "it is given by the zero of the extrapolated magnetization profile .",
    "the authors of @xcite have employed the concept of the extrapolation length in their monte carlo study of the magnetization profile of the three - dimensional ising model on the simple cubic lattice with free boundary conditions , which belong to the ordinary surface universality class .",

    "they find that the data for different values of @xmath149 only fall nicely on a single scaling curve , when the extrapolation length that depends on @xmath149 is properly taken into account .",
    "finally we like to mention that there had been attempts to eliminate corrections due to the surface by a proper choice of @xmath149 @xcite .",
    "it is beyond the scope of the present manuscript to check whether the result of the field theoretical calculation @xcite carries over to the extraordinary surface universality class , which is relevant for the present study .",

    "this is done in the following way : first we compute all clusters that include sites on the boundary . then all spins on sites that do not belong to these clusters are flipped .    with the local heat bath algorithm we run through the lattice in typewriter fashion .",
    "running through the lattice once is called one `` sweep '' in the following .",
    "one cycle of the hybrid algorithm is composed of two sweeps of the local heat bath algorithm followed by one cluster update as discussed above . at the bulk critical point",

    "these are due to fluctuations of the interface between the @xmath20 and the @xmath19 phase . as discussed in @xcite standard cluster algorithms are not suitable to overcome this problem .",

    "@xmath234 is then given by the free energy required to add a single site to this incomplete layer .",
