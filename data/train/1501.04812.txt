    "the paper is about a painlev iii equation of type @xmath0 and its relation to isomonodromic families of vector bundles on @xmath1 with meromorphic connections .",
    "this equation is very classical , and indeed many of the results below can be extracted from the literature .",
    "but we are motivated by more recent developments , of which this particular equation provides an illuminating and nontrivial example .",
    "the purpose of the paper is two - fold : it offers a conceptual language for the geometrical objects underlying painlev equations , and it offers new results on a particular painlev iii equation of type @xmath0 , which we denote by @xmath2 .",
    "this is equivalent to the radial sine ( or sinh ) gordon equation and , as such , it appears very widely in geometry and physics .",
    "the length of the paper is due to the systematic development of the material in the language of vector bundles with meromorphic connections , together with their additional structures which take care of all relevant symmetries .",
    "our motivation is to explain in a leisurely fashion the language of this general theory , by means of a concrete example .",
    "we emphasize that it is not necessary to read this paper from beginning to end ; different parts of the paper will be of interest to different readers .",
    "however , we recommend that chapter [ s1 ] be read from beginning to end , in order to understand how to find those parts .",
    "this chapter is a guide to the paper and a summary of results .",
    "_ viewpoint of this paper _",
    "the relevant geometrical objects are vector bundles with flat meromorphic connections . by choosing local trivializations",
    "one obtains scalar ( or matrix ) differential equations . while the sine - gordon equation",
    "may itself look very natural , certain aspects of its solutions appear quite awkward if the underlying geometrical objects are ignored .",
    "this holds even more so for the painlev equations , whose explicit formulations have historical but no other significance .",
    "it is well known that the ( nonlinear ) painlev equations describe isomonodromic deformations of associated linear meromorphic differential equations , that is , families of linear equations whose monodromy data remains constant within the family .",
    "this theory ( like the theory of isospectral deformations ) is of great importance as it links nonlinear p.d.e .  with algebraic methods of integrable systems theory .",
    "it has far - reaching applications to differential geometry ( harmonic maps and harmonic bundles ) , to variations of hodge structure and their generalizations , and to quantum field theory in physics ( most recently , mirror symmetry ) .",
    "however , the foundation for all this is the underlying geometry of families of vector bundles with meromorphic connections on @xmath1 , rather than the linear equations themselves , and a description of this geometry forms our starting point .",
    "we emphasize that two variables ( or rather two spaces ) are involved : the time variable  @xmath8 of the original painlev equation , and the deformation variable @xmath9 of the linear system .",
    "our vector bundles are rank 2 complex vector bundles @xmath10 whose restrictions @xmath11 are holomorphic bundles on @xmath1 , or twistors .",
    "the first half of the article introduces the fundamental moduli space of vector bundles with meromorphic connections on @xmath1 , then shows how it may be identified with two other spaces .",
    "first we have the ( slightly less canonical ) space @xmath12 of monodromy data , which arises through the riemann - hilbert correspondence",
    ". then we have the ( much less canonical ) space @xmath13 of initial conditions , which arises when local bases are chosen .",
    "the familiar painlev and sine - gordon equation appear only at this point .",
    "we obtain complex analytic isomorphisms @xmath14 which are highly nontrivial as they encode the solutions of the equations .",
    "the second half of the paper addresses in this way the complex multi - valued solutions of @xmath2 on the time variable space  @xmath15 . of particular interest are the poles and zeros of these solutions and the behaviour of the solutions at @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "so far all data is holomorphic .    in the last four chapters we consider real solutions ( with singularities ) on @xmath4 .",
    "the vector bundles there mix holomorphic and antiholomorphic structures .",
    "they are generalizations of variations of hodge structures , called terp structures ( for twistor extension real pairing ) and are related to @xmath5 geometry and harmonic bundles . in this language",
    ", the paper gives a complete picture of semisimple rank 2 terp structures .",
    "it also shows what general results on terp structures tell us about the asymptotics of solutions near @xmath6 and @xmath7 .    in the last chapter ,",
    "results about the asymptotics near @xmath6 and @xmath7 are combined with the global geometry of @xmath13 and @xmath12 .",
    "this combination leads to a new global picture of all zeros and poles of all real solutions on @xmath4 . very briefly , this can be stated as follows . for real solutions @xmath18 of @xmath2 , there are four types of behaviour at @xmath16 and four types of behaviour at @xmath17 : @xmath19 where the zeros   converge to @xmath6 and the zeros / poles   alternate and converge to @xmath7 .",
    "extrapolating naively to the whole of @xmath4 , this gives 16 possibilities , but ( i ) and ( ii ) can not occur together for the same @xmath18 , hence just 14 remain .",
    "we prove that _ precisely these 14 possibilities occur , and there are no other solutions .",
    "_ that is , there are no solutions with _ mixed zones _ between the specified types at 0 and at @xmath7 .",
    "the 14 possibilities correspond to 14 explicit strata of the space @xmath12 .",
    "we give most proofs in detail , and sometimes alternative proofs , without striving for the shortest one .",
    "it would be possible to extract shorter proofs of our new results , depending on the background of the intended audience .    before giving a more detailed description of the contents , let us reiterate the motivation for our approach .",
    "the main point is that the bundle point of view deals with intrinsic geometric objects .",
    "these become progressively more concrete ( but less canonical ) as various choices are made .",
    "the intrinsic approach leads to a clear understanding of the space of solutions , and of the global ( qualitative ) properties of the solutions themselves .",
    "moreover , it is an approach which could be adapted for other equations .",
    "we are aware that our approach has some disadvantages .",
    "the length of the paper and level of detail may be off - putting for the reader who is interested only in a specific aspect of the solutions . despite this length , the paper is not entirely self - contained ; at several key points we rely on references to the literature , notably for some of the asymptotic results .",
    "another omission is that we have not yet exploited lie - theoretic language , nor the hamiltonian or symplectic aspects .",
    "this project started when the authors attempted to reconcile the ( algebraic / complex analytic ) approach to variations of hodge structures via meromorphic connections with the ( differential geometric ) approach to harmonic maps via loop groups .",
    "the current article is written primarily from the first viewpoint ; a supplementary article from the second viewpoint is in preparation .",
    "however , both approaches are linked by the fundamental idea  the riemann - hilbert correspondence  that the monodromy data of the associated linear o.d.e",
    ".  represents faithfully the solutions of the nonlinear equation . in the first approach ,",
    "this monodromy data , or rather the meromorphic connection from which it is derived , is explicitly at the forefront . in the second approach ,",
    "the monodromy data lies behind the so called generalized weierstrass or dpw data , and @xmath20 is the spectral parameter .    _",
    "summary of this chapter _    in order to make the results in the paper approachable and transparent ,",
    "this chapter 1 is quite detailed . unlike the main body of the paper ( chapters [ s2 ] -[s18 ] )",
    ", it starts in section [ s1.1 ] with the painlev iii equations , and explains immediately and concretely the space @xmath13 of initial conditions .",
    "although this is quite long , it is just a friendly introduction to essentially well known facts on painlev iii .",
    "section [ s1.2 ] gives , equally concretely , the space @xmath12 of monodromy data ( at this point , without explaining where it comes from ) .",
    "section [ s1.3 ] presents the main results on real solutions .",
    "no special knowledge is required to understand these statements .",
    "section [ s1.4 ] is intended to orient the reader who is interested primarily in knowing where the above results can be found in the paper , and which parts of the paper might be most relevant for applications .",
    "the history of the subject is rich , and some references and historical remarks are given in section [ s1.5 ] .    in section [ s1.6 ]",
    "we summarize our treatment of vector bundles with meromorphic connections .",
    "the terminology is cumbersome , but it is designed to be used , not just looked at .",
    "it reflects the properties of these bundles and the additional structures which underlie the symmetries of the equations .",
    "section [ s1.7 ] goes on to relate these bundles to the important geometrical concepts which motivated the entire project , and which are ( for us ) the main applications : terp structures , variations of hodge structures , and tt * geometry .    finally , in section [ s1.8 ] we list some problems and questions that we leave for future consideration .",
    "the painlev iii equation with parameters @xmath21 is the second order ordinary differential equation @xmath22 this is a meromorphic o.d.e .  whose coefficients have a simple pole at @xmath23 , so we assume from now on that @xmath24 .",
    "it is a basic fact of o.d.e .",
    "theory that for any @xmath25 and any _ regular initial datum _",
    "@xmath26 there exists a unique holomorphic local solution @xmath18 with @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "the painlev property   is the following nontrivial extension of this :    [ t1.1 ] ( painlev property ) any local solution extends to a global multi - valued meromorphic function on @xmath15 .",
    "painlev s proof was incomplete .",
    "the painlev property follows from the relation to isomonodromic families ( and fundamental results on isomonodromic families )  see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , or theorem [ 10.3 ] below .",
    "other proofs can be found , for example , in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the painlev property implies that analytic continuations of solutions with regular initial data give meromorphic functions on the universal covering of @xmath15 , i.e.   their singularities are at worst poles ( in fact they are all simple poles ) .",
    "however the location of such poles varies drastically with the initial data .",
    "in addition , there are other solutions corresponding to singular initial data , and the same applies to their poles as well .",
    "the _ global _ description of all these solutions and their poles presents a nontrivial problem , which ( as far as we know ) has not so far been addressed in the existing literature .",
    "if one chooses locally a logarithm @xmath29 then @xmath30 branches at the poles and zeros of @xmath18 , but equation simplifies to @xmath31 where @xmath32 means @xmath33 .",
    "one sees immediately the following symmetries ( here @xmath34 ) : @xmath35    in @xcite four cases are identified : @xmath36 the four parameters can be reduced to 2,1,0,1 parameters ( respectively ) by rescaling @xmath37 and @xmath18 .    in particular , @xmath0 can be reduced to @xmath38 with @xmath39 . in this paper",

    "preserve the space of solutions of @xmath2 .",
    "the following lemma makes precise statements about the zeros and poles of solutions of @xmath2 and gives a meaning to _ singular initial data _ at zeros or poles of solutions .",
    "it generalizes to all @xmath0 equations .",
    "the lemma is known , but for lack of a suitable reference we sketch the proof .",

    "second , the concrete form of the leading term is important .",
    "theorem [ t12.4 ] describes which leading terms are possible .",

    "the proof in @xcite treats the three cases @xmath209 and @xmath210 separately . in chapter [ s12 ] the formulae for @xmath200 and for @xmath204",
    "are derived from the formula ( with the leading term _ and _ the next term ) for @xmath191 .",

    "they correspond to real solutions of the radial sinh - gordon equation @xmath215 with negative sign , and the radial sine - gordon equation @xmath216 these solutions are much easier to deal with : they are all smooth on @xmath4 , because the condition @xmath151 in lemma [ t1.2 ] is impossible when the values are in @xmath213 or in @xmath214 .",

    "it has some similarities , but also some differences from our isomorphism .",
    "all reducible vector bundles with connections are completely reducible in our case , and are not completely reducible in their case .",
    "they have more objects , whereas our objects ( the @xmath223-tejpa bundles ) are richer .",

    "<S> the paper is about a painlev iii equation of type @xmath0 and its relation to isomonodromic families of vector bundles on @xmath1 with meromorphic connections .    </S>",
    "<S> the purpose of the paper is two - fold : it offers a conceptual language for the geometrical objects underlying painlev equations , and it offers new results on a particular painlev iii equation of type @xmath0 , which we denote by @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> this is equivalent to the radial sine ( or sinh ) gordon equation and , as such , it appears very widely in geometry and physics .    </S>",
    "<S> the length of the paper is due to the systematic development of the material in the language of vector bundles with meromorphic connections , together with their additional structures which take care of all relevant symmetries . </S>",
    "<S> our motivation is to explain in a leisurely fashion the language of this general theory , by means of a concrete example .    </S>",
    "<S> complex multi - valued solutions on @xmath3 are the natural context for most of the paper , but in the last three chapters real solutions on @xmath4 ( with or without singularities ) are addressed . </S>",
    "<S> the vector bundles appearing there can be regarded as mixing holomorphic and antiholomorphic structures . </S>",
    "<S> they are generalizations of variations of hodge structures , called terp structures ( for twistor extension real pairing ) and are related to @xmath5 geometry , and harmonic bundles . </S>",
    "<S> the paper gives a complete picture of semisimple rank 2 terp structures . </S>",
    "<S> general results on terp structures can be applied to study the asymptotics near @xmath6 and @xmath7 of real solutions .    finally , results about the asymptotics of real solutions near @xmath6 and near @xmath7 are combined with results on the global geometry of the moduli spaces of initial data and monodromy data . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to a new global picture of all zeros and poles of all real solutions of @xmath2 on @xmath4 .    </S>",
