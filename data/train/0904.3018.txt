    "the shastry - sutherland antiferromagnet @xcite is a rare example of an exactly soluble frustrated spin model in two spatial dimensions .",
    "its ground state is a direct product of near - neighbor spin - singlet pairs , and there is an energy gap to all excitations . much theoretical and attention",
    "has been lavished on this model after the discovery @xcite of its experimental realization in @xmath1 .",
    "this paper will examine the phases of the shastry - sutherland antiferromagnet for the case of exchange interactions with a strong ising anisotropy , and in the presence of an applied magnetic field .",
    "this is motivated by a recent experimental study @xcite of @xmath2 , in which the magnetic tm ions are believed to be ising - like .",
    "the experimental studies on the compound @xmath2 determined both on its phase diagram as a function of temperature , and the magnetization diagram@xcite as a function of the external magnet field . in the magnetization diagram , as the external magnetic field increased from 0 , magnetization plateaus with @xmath3 are seen , followed by a major 1/2 magnetization plateau before reaching saturation@xcite .    in this paper",
    "a classical ising model was first used in monte carlo calculation to simulate the magnetization process .",
    "based on the simulation result , a more detailed analysis was done on the ground state phase diagram for ising - like shastry - sutherland ( ss ) lattice .",
    "going beyond the classical ising limit , we accounted for the quantum effects of the transverse spin interaction by the effective hamiltonian method of sen , wang and damle@xcite ; this is valid in the limit of large spin @xmath4 .",
    "we will show that this effective hamiltonian does contain terms which stabilize a 1/2 magnetization plateau .",
    "the theoretical models in this paper were all based on the two - dimensional lattice , with magnetic ion located on each site of the ss lattice .",
    "the magnetic ion interacts only with the nearest neighbors through exchange interactions , with square bond strength @xmath5 and diagonal bond @xmath6 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : ssl ] ) .",
    "acts between sites separated by the horizontal and vertical links , which the exchange @xmath7 acts across the diagonal links.[fig : ssl],width=144 ]    while this work was being completed , we learnt of the work of meng and wessel @xcite ; where their results overlap with ours , they are in agreement .",
    "a naive approach to the problem is the classic spin-@xmath8 ising model .",
    "spins , which can take two different values ( up or down ) , are located at each corner of the ss lattice , with anti - ferromagnetic exchange interaction @xmath9 and @xmath10 between the nearest neighbors . to simulate the magnetization process ,",
    "the monte carlo method was used in the simulation .",
    "the simple hamiltonian was taken as : @xmath11 where the first summation runs over all the square bonds and the second runs over all the diagonal bonds , @xmath12 denotes the spins with @xmath13 , and @xmath14 term denotes the energy gained from the external magnetic field .",
    "the detailed monte carlo process was done in the following way .",
    "the lattice size was chosen to be @xmath15 , which is a common multiple of both 2 and 3 ( the reasons will follow ) , with periodic boundary condition at the four sides .",
    "periodic boundary condition in ss lattice requires the length to be a multiple of 2 . in the metropolis algorithm ,",
    "iteration times before reaching equilibrium and after reaching equilibrium were all set to be 100,000 times , the temperature was set very close to zero , and the bond strength @xmath16 was set to one .",
    "take the three different values : @xmath17 .",
    "[ magnetization ] ]    the results of the simulation are shown in fig .",
    "[ magnetization ] , where different lines represent different values of @xmath18 ratio .",
    "as can be seen from the figure , for all values of the @xmath18 ratio , there s always a very large @xmath19 magnetization plateau , and no @xmath8 plateau is observed .",
    "it will be shown later in this section that no @xmath8 plateau is possible at zero temperature in the ising model .",
    "similar simulation results were also be obtained when lattice size was chosen to be 12 or 24 ( again , both as integer multiple of 2 and 3 ) .",
    "it is important to note that in this simulation , the choice of the lattice size matters , and a wrong choice of lattice size could lead to different conclusions . to understand the choice of lattice size , the resulting spin configuration in our @xmath19 magnetization plateau",
    "is shown here in fig .",
    "[ 1/3 plateau spin config . ] .        in fig .",
    "[ 1/3 plateau spin config . ] , empty dots represent spin ups while black dots represent spin downs . in the figure , @xmath19 of the total spins are pointing down while others pointing up . also , every spin down is surrounded by spin ups both through @xmath16 bond and @xmath7 bond .",
    "this is the key feature of this spin configuration , which makes its energy the lowest among all that have @xmath19 of spins pointing down ( c.f .",
    "( [ ising hamiltonian ] ) ) . due to the period of 3 in this spin configuration ( a repetition of three rows in the figure )",
    ", the lattice size has to be a multiple of 3 to make this configuration possible .",
    "note that the degeneracy of this spin configuration has a very limited value of 6 , compared to the large degeneracy of other types . from the figure , we can now write down the hamiltonian for this particular spin configuration ( hamiltonian for the @xmath19-plateau phase ) by using eq .",
    "( [ ising hamiltonian ] ) : @xmath20 where @xmath21 represents the total number of lattice sites , and other parameters are the same as eq .",
    "( [ ising hamiltonian ] ) .",
    "we are now at the position of giving out a full ground state phase diagram .",
    "the proposed ground state phase diagram is shown here in fig .",
    "[ ising phase diagram ] .     and",
    "@xmath22 being two independent variables .",
    "the boundaries are obtained simply by comparing the hamiltonian of different phases using eq .",
    "( [ ising hamiltonian ] ) . ]",
    "different phases shown are the different zero - temperature ground states of the general ss lattice with hamiltonian of eq .",
    "( [ ising hamiltonian ] ) .",
    "as shown in the figure , when the external field is zero , we have the neel state ( opposite spins on square bonds ) when @xmath23 , and the ising dimer state ( opposite spins on diagonal bonds ) when @xmath24 . as the external field increases ,",
    "the @xmath19 plateau phase will arise , giving us a positive total magnetization .",
    "when the external field is large enough , the all spin - up state will show up , giving us the magnetization saturation .",
    "further reflection explains the existence of @xmath19 plateau : if we rewrite the hamiltonian as a function of the ratio between spin - down - number and total - spin - number ( denoted by @xmath25 ) , the @xmath19 plateau phase will have the largest @xmath25 value among all states that have the key feature ( all the spin downs are surrounded by spin ups through both @xmath16 and @xmath7 bonds ) .",
    "that is to say , the @xmath19 plateau state will have the largest number of spin downs while keeping the key feature .",
    "this will make the 1/3 plateau phase an extreme .",
    "different extremes of the hamiltonian are obtained at @xmath26(all spin - up state ) , @xmath27(1/3 plateau phase ) and @xmath28 ( neel state and ising dimer state ) , which are exactly the different phases shown in fig .",
    "[ ising phase diagram ] .    to demonstrate the reliability of the proposed ground state phase diagram ,",
    "an exhaustive computational simulation was done on a @xmath29 lattice , by going through all the possible spin configurations and picking out the ones with the lowest energy ( altogether @xmath30 configurations ) .",
    "the result of the simulation agreed completely with fig .",
    "[ ising phase diagram ] .",
    "it s also very instructive to look back and compare fig .  [ ising phase diagram ] with the magnetization result obtained in fig .  [ magnetization ] .",
    "the two figures agree well at the critical points when phase transition occurs from the 1/3 plateau to the all spin - up state , with @xmath18 value being 1 , 2 , 4 , and @xmath22 value being 5 , 6 , 8 , respectively .",
    "to conclude , as a direct application of the obtained phase diagram , we ll present here a short proof showing that no @xmath8 plateau ground state is possible at zero temperature in the ising model .",
    "this is achieved by showing that there s always a lower energy state than any possible states with a 1/2-saturation magnetization .",
    "first , in view of eq .",
    "( [ ising hamiltonian ] ) , it s not hard to get the lowest energy expression for states with a 1/2 magnetization : @xmath31 in the above equation , by minimizing the energy expression , both @xmath16 and @xmath7 terms accidentally vanished , leaving only the @xmath14 term .",
    "the minimizing process could be easily understood as follows : for states with a 1/2-saturation magnetization , the total number of spin downs would be @xmath32(@xmath21 being the total site number ) , so that the maximum number of antiparallel square - bond pairs would be @xmath33 .",
    "noting that there re altogether @xmath34 square - bonds , the antiparallel pairs and parallel pairs would cancel each other in the @xmath16 term .",
    "similar analysis applies to the @xmath7 term .    the energy expression for the all spin - up state is also needed for the proof : @xmath35 now , by direct comparison of the three energy expressions ( eqs .",
    "[ 1/3 plateau hamiltonian ] , [ 1/2 plateau hamiltonian ] and [ all spin - up hamiltonian ] ) , we see that either the all spin - up state ( eq .  ( [ all spin - up hamiltonian ] ) ) or the 1/3 plateau phase ( eq .  ( [ 1/3 plateau hamiltonian ] ) )",
    "have lower energy than the minimum energy we obtained for states with 1/2-saturation magnetization ( eq .  ( [ 1/2 plateau hamiltonian ] ) ) throughout the phase diagram .",
    "that is to say , states with 1/2-saturation magnetization could never have the lowest energy .",
    "thus no 1/2 magnetization plateau is possible in the ising limit at zero temperature .",
    "as the classical ising model does not give us an understanding of the major 1/2 plateau observed in the experiment , @xcite improvements were made to our ising model hamiltonian . in this section ,",
    "we focus on the perturbative effects of the transverse fluctuation on the ssl spin multiplets with large easy axis anisotropy : @xmath36\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the above equation , @xmath37 is the strength of the easy axis anisotropy along the @xmath38 axis , @xmath39 are the spin multiplets , @xmath16 and @xmath7 are the bond strengths same as in eq .",
    "( [ ising hamiltonian ] ) , and the @xmath40 term was introduced to take care of the transverse interaction , with parameter @xmath40 adjustable to count for the asymmetry between @xmath38 axis and the @xmath41 axis .    as argued in ref .",
    ", since the problem turns out to be a strong ising anisotropy problem ( see ref .  ) , a @xmath42 expansion of the hamiltonian will give us the leading quantum effects .",
    "for the perturbation process , following the method introduced by ref .  , we first split the hamiltonian as @xmath43 , in which @xmath44 @xmath45 note that @xmath46 is actually the @xmath40 term in eq .",
    "( [ easy axis hamiltonian ] ) .",
    "when @xmath37 is large , the ground state manifold of @xmath47 is just the ising limit we adopted in the previous section , where the spins are all maximally polarized along the @xmath38 axis ( so that @xmath48 ) .",
    "this ground state manifold is referred to as the ising subspace .",
    "degenerate perturbation theory will now be applied by treating @xmath46 as a perturbation on this @xmath47 ground state manifold ( or , the ising subspace ) .",
    "it s not hard to check that both the first - order perturbation terms and the second - order off - diagonal perturbation terms vanish , leaving only the second - order diagonal terms : @xmath49 where @xmath50 denotes the ising subspace , @xmath51 denotes any state in the ising subspace , @xmath52 denotes any state outside the ising subspace , and @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the energies for the corresponding states . for further convenience ,",
    "rewrite the above expression in the following way : @xmath55 where @xmath56 are the states that , compared with states in the ising subspace , have different spins only at the two ends of one single square bond , while @xmath57 having different spins only at the two ends of one single diagonal bond ( it is not hard to see that @xmath56 and @xmath57 will include all the states with non - vanishing value in eq .",
    "( [ h-(2 ) ] ) ) .",
    "after a somewhat lengthy calculation of the above equation by calculating the two terms separately ( note that in the calculation , the two terms would have different energy denominators ) , and by performing a small-@xmath42 expansion for both terms , we finally arrive at the resulting perturbation term : @xmath58 \\\\\\label{perturbation hamiltonian } & -\\frac{p^{2}j_{2}^{2}s^{2}}{2d(2s-1)}\\sum_{j_{2}\\langle i , j \\rangle}\\frac{1-\\sigma_{i}\\sigma_{j}}{2}\\left[1-\\frac{j_{2}}{2d}+ \\frac{j_{1}s(\\sigma_{i}h_i+\\sigma_jh_j)}{2d(2s-1)}\\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the effective hamiltonian in the ising subspace was obtained as : @xmath59 in eq .",

    "note that this is far from a rigorous proof of the diagram , as the hamiltonian is much more complex than in the ising model , and there s now no direct way to get the global energy minimum . also , the exhaustive simulation is impossible in this case .",
    "yet as the new hamiltonian is based on the original ising hamiltonian , it s reasonable to start from the ground states in the original phase diagram .    ]    in fig .",
    "[ newphasediagram1 ] , we directly adopted the previous four ground states without rigorous proof .",
    "the boundaries in the figure are all obtained using the new hamiltonian , where we ve set the magnitude of the spin multiplet @xmath4 to be @xmath65 ( as in the experiment@xcite ) , the @xmath66 value to be @xmath67 , and the parameter @xmath40 to be @xmath68 . for the convenience of direct comparison with the original phase diagram ,",
    "the unit of the vertical axis was divided by a factor of @xmath4 .",
    "comparison with the original phase diagram ( fig .",
    "[ ising phase diagram ] ) shows their similarities , which should be the case .",
    "of course , minor corrections are necessary for the new phase diagram , especially at the boundaries between the four  old \" ground states ; here presented in fig .",
    "[ newphasediagram1 ] is only a correction we found at the boundary between  all spin - up state \" and the  1/3 plateau phase \" .",
    "as could be seen in the figure , the boundary now split up , and a new state with magnetization being 1/2-saturation is found to have lower energy .",
    "its detailed spin configuration pattern is showed here in fig .",
    "[ 1/2 plateau spin config . ] ( again , black dots represent spin downs while empty dots ups ) .    ]",
    "although it s impossible to prove that this configuration has the lowest energy , this interesting finding at least gives a region where the  1/2 magnetization plateau \" is possible . if we redraw a diagram of magnetization against the external field , before the magnetization reach its saturation value , a 1/2 plateau may occur . to make this region more dramatic and easy to see in the phase diagram ,",
    "the parameter @xmath40 was tuned to be @xmath69 in fig .",

    "the parameter @xmath40 is changed to 5 in the figure , to make the possible  1/2 plateau phase \" more obvious to see .",
    "note that in the figure , the boundaries began to cross each other , which means that the boundary behavior of the phase diagram is more complex than before , and further analysis are needed.[newphasediagram2 ] ]    at the end , it s also reasonable to further suspect that the small fractional magnetization plateaus with @xmath3 found in the experiment @xcite could also be possibly explained by similar arguments .",
    "as the boundary between  neel state \" and  1/3 plateau phase \" start to split up , fractional plateau phase may have lower energy and arise from the effective hamiltonian correction .",
    "in this paper , a thorough analysis was done for the two dimensional ss lattice with the ising model , giving us the full ground state phase diagram ( see fig .",

    "the phase diagram is consistent with both the monte carlo simulations and the exhaustive simulation for a small system .",
    "as shown in the diagram , except for the neel state , ising dimer state and the all spin - up state , only a 1/3 magnetization plateau phase could be found , and no 1/2 magnetization plateau is possible in the ising limit .",
    "further study was done by considering the perturbative effects of the transverse fluctuations , followed by @xmath42 strong anisotropy expansion .",
    "the new effective hamiltonian showed minor corrections to the phase diagram , and more importantly , it gave a possible region in the phase diagram where 1/2 magnetization plateau may occur .",
