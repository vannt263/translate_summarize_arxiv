    "the @xmath0 ( @xmath7 ) photo - production in the @xmath8 reaction is an interesting tool to gain a deeper understanding of the interaction among strange hadrons and also on the nature of baryon resonances .",
    "there have been some experimental efforts dedicated to this reaction .",
    "there exist measurements from two old experiments in the high energy region @xmath9 gev by the lamp2 collaboration  @xcite , and @xmath10 gev by boyarski et al .",
    "recently , this reaction has been examined at photon energies below @xmath11 gev in the spring-8 leps experiment  @xcite . for an invariant @xmath12 mass @xmath13 gev ,",
    "this latter experiment has reported a new bump structure in the differential cross section at forward @xmath14 angles , which might hint to a sizeable contribution from nucleon resonances in the @xmath4channel .    on the theoretical side ,",
    "there exist several effective hadron lagrangian studies of this reaction for laboratory photon energies ranging from threshold ( @xmath15 1.7  gev ) , up to about 5 gev , where the old experimental measurements were available .",
    "different dominant mechanisms have been proposed to describe the lamp2 high energy results for angular and energy differential cross sections .",
    "thus , in refs .  @xcite it is claimed a large contribution from the @xmath2channel @xmath16 exchange , while a large contribution from a gauge invariant contact term along with @xmath2channel @xmath3 exchange and baryon pole ( @xmath4 and @xmath17 channels ) is advocated in  @xcite . on the other hand , a quark - gluon string reaction mechanism , which was realized in the @xmath3 meson reggeon exchange model ,",
    "is also able to reproduce the available experimental data in the high photon energy region from @xmath18 gev up to @xmath19 gev , as discussed in  @xcite . in this latter work ,",
    "the coupling of the @xmath20 resonance , which is dynamically generated within a chiral unitary model  @xcite , to the @xmath21 pair is shown to be quite small and hence , the contribution of @xmath2channel @xmath16 exchange is taken to be much smaller than that due to exchange of the pseudoscalar @xmath3 meson .",
    "indeed , this minor role played by the @xmath16 exchange gets support from the decay asymmetry measured by the clas collaboration  @xcite . besides",
    ", the photon beam asymmetry for @xmath22 photo - production has been also proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite as tool to unravel the reaction mechanism , since it is predicted to be very small for the contact and @xmath4 and @xmath17 baryon pole terms , while much larger for @xmath2channel @xmath3 and @xmath16 exchanges .",
    "moreover , @xmath3 and @xmath16 exchanges give rise to different signs of the photon - beam asymmetry  @xcite .",
    "all these models fail , however , to describe the forward bump structure that appears in the new leps differential cross section data at low energies .    in the present work ,",
    "we reanalyze the @xmath23 reaction within the effective lagrangian method near - threshold , where the new experimental data from the leps collaboration  @xcite have been taken .",
    "in addition to the `` background '' contributions from the contact , @xmath2channel @xmath3 exchange , and @xmath4channel nucleon pole terms , which were already considered in previous works , we have also studied possible contributions from nucleon resonances aiming at describing the bump at forward angles reported by leps . unfortunately , the information about nucleon resonances in the relevant mass region ( @xmath24 ) gev is scarce  @xcite , which means that the evidence of their existence and the knowledge of their properties are poor .",
    "thus , it is necessary to rely on theoretical schemes , such that of ref .",
    "@xcite based in a quark model ( qm ) for baryons . among the possible nucleon resonances , we have finally considered only the two - star @xmath25wave @xmath26 @xmath5 ( @xmath27 ) one , which is predicted to have visible contributions  @xcite to the @xmath8 reaction . although the @xmath5 resonance is listed in the particle data group ( pdg ) book , the evidence of its existence is poor or only fair and further work is required to verify their existence and to know its properties , accordingly , its total decay width and branching ratios are not experimentally known , either . in this respect ,",
    "we show in this work how the leps measurements could be used to determine some of the properties of this resonance .    to end this introduction , we would like to mention that in refs .",
    "@xcite , the role played by the @xmath5 resonance in the @xmath28 reaction has been also studied . in these works , in sharp contrast with our findings , it is pointed out that the @xmath5 resonance has a negligible contribution and therefore its contribution is not expected to explain the bump structure at forward angles reported by leps .",
    "this is greatly due to the small @xmath29 coupling and large width of the resonance used in refs .",
    "@xcite , and we will comment on this below .    the paper is organized as follows . in sect .",

    "however , we have shown here that the photo - production of the @xmath5 resonance off the proton and its subsequent decay into @xmath176 might also provide a simple explanation of the bump structure observed in the experimental data .",
    "this contradicts the findings of refs .",
    "@xcite , where unnecessarily small @xmath183 couplings and probably a too large width for this resonance were used .",
    "finally , we would like to stress that thanks to the important role played by the resonant contribution in the @xmath184 reaction , accurate data for this reaction can be used to improve our knowledge on some @xmath5 properties , which are at present poorly known .",
    "this work constitutes a first step in this direction .",

    "<S> we investigate the @xmath0 photo - production in the @xmath1 reaction within the effective lagrangian method near threshold . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the `` background '' contributions from the contact , @xmath2channel @xmath3 exchange , and @xmath4channel nucleon pole terms , which were already considered in previous works , the contribution from the nucleon resonance @xmath5 ( spin - parity @xmath6 ) is also considered . we show that the inclusion of the nucleon resonance @xmath5 leads to a fairly good description of the new leps differential cross section data , and that these measurements can be used to determine some of the properties of this latter resonance . however , serious discrepancies appear when the predictions of the model are compared to the photon - beam asymmetry also measured by the leps collaboration . </S>"
