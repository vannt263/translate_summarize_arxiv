    "in statistical physics , to calculate the free energy of solvable lattice models for finite temperature is one of the important problems . for this purpose ,",
    "thermodynamic bethe ansatz ( tba ) equations have been often used @xcite . in general , the tba equations are an infinite number of coupled nonlinear integral equations ( nlie ) with an infinite number unknown functions . then it is desirable to reduce tba equations to a finite number of coupled nlie with a finite number of unknown functions .",
    "destri , de vega @xcite and klmper @xcite proposed nlie with two ( or one ) unknown functions for the @xmath5 ( or @xmath6 ) model . to generalize their nlie to models",
    "whose underlying algebras have arbitrary rank seems to be a difficult problem as we need considerable trial and errors to find auxiliary functions which are needed to derive the nlie . then there are nlie of abovementioned type for models whose underlying algebras have at most rank 3 ( for example , @xcite ) .    several years ago , takahashi discovered @xcite an another nlie for the @xmath5 model in simplifying tba equations .",
    "later , the same nlie was rederived @xcite from fusion relations ( @xmath4-system ) @xcite among quantum transfer matrices ( qtm ) @xcite .",
    "in addition , it was also rederived @xcite for the @xmath7 model from a fugacity expansion formula .    in view of these situations ,",
    "we have derived nlie of takahashi type for the @xmath8 model @xcite , the @xmath9 model @xcite , the higher spin heisenberg model @xcite , the @xmath10 perk - schultz model @xcite . in these cases ,",
    "the number of unknown functions and nlie coincide with the rank of the underlying algebras . in this paper",
    ", we will further derive nlie with a finite number of unknown functions for the @xmath0 perk - schultz model @xcite , which is a multicomponent generalization of the 6-vertex model and one of the fundamental solvable lattice models in statistical mechanics .",
    "for example , a special case of this model is related to the supersymmetric @xmath11 model , which is important in strongly correlated electron systems .    in section 2",
    ", we introduce the @xmath0 perk - schultz model , and define the qtm for it . as a summation over tableaux labeled by @xmath12 young ( super ) diagram , we introduce an auxiliary function ( [ dvf ] ) @xcite which includes an eigenvalue formula ( [ qtm - eigen ] ) of the qtm as a special case .",
    "we also introduce a system of functional relations ( @xmath4-system ) which is satisfied by this auxiliary function .    in section 3 ,",
    "we derive two kind of nlie which contain only @xmath1 unknown functions .",
    "the first ones ( [ nlie - general ] ) , ( [ nlie - generalb ] ) reduce to the nlie for the @xmath10 perk - schultz model in @xcite if @xmath13 .",
    "however our new nlie are not straightforward generalization of the ones in our previous paper @xcite .",
    "in fact for @xmath14 case , a straightforward generation of our previous nlie becomes a system of an infinite number of coupled nlie which contains an infinite number of unknown functions ( see ( [ nlie4 ] ) ) . to overcome this difficulty",
    ", we will use the quantum ( supersymmetric ) jacobi - trudi and giambelli formula ( [ jacobi - trudi ] ) and a duality ( [ dual ] ) for the auxiliary function , from which a closed set of nlie can be derived .",
    "we will also propose another nlie ( [ nlie - xi=-1 ] ) and ( [ nlie - xi=-1b ] ) in the latter part of the section 3 , which have never been considered before even for the @xmath15 case . in deriving the nlie",
    ", we assume that @xmath3 is generic .",
    "however we expect that our results can be also analytically continued to the case where @xmath3 is a root of unity .    in section 4",
    ", we calculate the high temperature expansion of the free energy based on our nlie .",
    "in particular , we can derive coefficients ( [ coe1])-([coe5 ] ) up to the order of 5 for the arbitrary rank @xmath1 .",
    "the point is that if we fix the degree of the high temperature expansion , we can write down a general formula of the coefficients . on the other hand ,",
    "if we specialize parameters , we can derive the coefficients for much higher orders .",
    "for example for @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 case , coefficients of the high temperature expansion of the specific heat up to the order of 40 are presented in appendix .",
    "it will be difficult to derive the coefficients of such a high order by other method .",
    "section 5 is devoted to concluding remarks .",
    "in this section , we will introduce the @xmath0 perk - schultz model is a quantum affine superalgebra , which characterizes the @xmath19-matrix of this model .",

    "we find a good agreement between our result and their result except for very low temperature region .",
    "we can also calculate the high temperature expansion from the nlie for @xmath110 in subsection 3.2 . similar to @xmath109 case , we assume @xmath306 where @xmath307 . here we do not expand @xmath308 with respect to @xmath257 .",
    "( [ hte - ta ] ) for @xmath226 should coincide with ( [ hte - tm ] ) for @xmath189 up to a factor from the normalization function ( [ normal ] ) .",
    "thus we have @xmath309 due to symmetry between the nlie for @xmath109 and the one for @xmath110 , the following relation follows : @xmath310 for example , ( [ ty1 ] ) and ( [ ty2 ] ) for @xmath311 and ( [ coe1 ] ) reproduce the @xmath152-system ( [ q - sys ] ) for @xmath94 . from the relations ( [ ty1 ] ) and ( [ ty2 ] ) for @xmath312 and ( [ coe2 ] )",
    ", we obtain identities among characters @xmath313 where we have used the fact that @xmath151 does not depend on @xmath314 .",
    "these relations can be proved from the relations ( [ jacobi - trudi ] ) , ( [ jacobi - trudi2 ] ) and ( [ limit ] ) .",
    "some comments on references on the high temperature expansion are in order .",
    "the high temperature expansion of the free energy was calculated from the takahashi s nlie for the @xmath7-model up to the order of 100 @xcite ; the @xmath5-model up to the order of 99 @xcite .",
    "as for the higher rank or higher spin case , we have some results @xcite from nlie . in particular , our result on the @xmath9 uimin - sutherland model in @xcite was applied @xcite to spin ladder models and good agreement was seen between theoretical results and experimental data .",
    "we note that the coefficients ( [ coe1])-([coe3 ] ) coincide with eqs .",
    "( 4.14)-(4.16 ) in @xcite .",
    "note however that the coefficients in our paper are more general than the ones in @xcite since the value of @xmath149 ( [ limit ] ) was restricted to @xmath13 case in @xcite .",
    "there are also several works on high temperature expansions by different methods ( see for example , @xcite ) .",
    "in this paper , we have derived nlie which contain only @xmath1 unknown functions for the @xmath315 perk - schultz model .",
    "the key is a duality for the auxiliary function ( [ dual ] ) and the quantum ( supersymmetric ) jacobi - trudi and giambelli formula ( [ jacobi - trudi ] ) and ( [ jacobi - trudi2 ] ) .",
    "although we assumed that @xmath3 is generic , we expect that our nlie ( at least reduced ones ( [ nlie - general])-([nlie - s=0b ] ) , ( [ nlie - xi=-1])-([nlie - r=0b ] ) ) will also be valid even for the case where @xmath3 is root of unity as we will not need to take into account truncation of the @xmath4-system .",
    "the high temperature expansion of the free energy in terms of characters was calculated from our nlie .",
    "there are nlie with a finite number of unknown functions for algebras of arbitrary rank in different context @xcite .",
    "these nlie are different from takahashi - type .",
    "whether one can generalize ( or modify ) their nlie for finite temperature case is still not clear .",
    "a deeper understanding of this subject is desirable .",
    "there is an another kind of formulation of transfer matrices which is based on the graded formulation of the quantum inverse scattering method . in this formulation ,",
    "the row - to - row transfer matrix is defined as a supertrace : @xmath316 , where the @xmath19-matrix is defined as @xmath317 and the graded tensor product is adopted . as far as the free energy ( in the thermodynamic limit ) is concerned , we think that there is no difference between this graded formulation and the one we have adopted .",
    "the author would like to thank a. klmper and k. sakai for comments on a figure of specific heats .",
    "he also thank y. nagatani for a remark on programming of mathematica .",

    "if one substitute ( [ q - q=1 ] ) , @xmath322 and the values of @xmath323 into ( [ coe1])-([coe5 ] ) , one can recover ( [ hte - sl30])-([hte - sl32 ] ) up to the order of 5 through @xmath324 . a formula for @xmath325 can be obtained from the relation @xmath326 ."
