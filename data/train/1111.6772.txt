    "multi - particle production in strong fields is a typical unstable phenomenon that can be seen in extreme situations such as ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collisions , high - energy astrophysical objects , and possibly high - intensity laser .",
    "this phenomenon is in general nonperturbative even for weakly interacting systems because the coupling with external strong fields compensates the weakness of the interaction . a straightforward description of such an instability may be given by the effective action of the strong fields .",
    "a famous example is the euler - heisenberg action , which is an effective action of strong electromagnetic fields due to electron s one - loop contribution .",
    "however , such an effective action does not directly tell us the information of dynamical processes which cause instability . to obtain dynamical pictures of instabilities",
    ", we have to resort to other methods which allow us to describe the degrees of freedom relevant for instabilities .",
    "when the produced particles are normalizable and asymptotically stable modes , one can describe particle production within the canonical quantization .",
    "this is indeed the case with the schwinger mechanism @xcite where a pair of a charged particle and an antiparticle is created in a strong field .",
    "on the other hand , when a system contains genuine unstable modes which are unnormalizable and keep growing even at asymptotic regions , one can not apply the canonical quantization to those modes .",
    "when the mode amplitude grows in an unnormalizable way , this mode should be treated as not a particle but a field . however , if the instability lasts only for a finite duration , we have , after the instability , an asymptotic region where stable particle modes can be defined",
    ". then we can provide particle interpretation of the modes by the canonical quantization , and therefore the instability can be viewed as a particle production phenomena . in fact , this situation is seen in the parametric resonance , where the time - dependent external field induces instability only for a finite time interval , and particle number is defined in the free regions @xcite .",
    "notice that one encounters both of the cases in non - abelian yang - mills theories ; the one - loop effective action of non - abelian gauge fields under constant electric or magnetic background has an imaginary part , which indicates the existence of instabilities @xcite .",
    "the instability in a purely electric field consists of normalizable and asymptotically stable modes , and thereby can be interpreted as particle productions @xcite .",
    "one can formulate it as a non - abelian analog of the schwinger mechanism @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the instability in a purely magnetic background is caused by rapid growth of particular fluctuations and thus can not be formulated as particle production unless the magnetic field is turned off in finite time so that the modes are stabilized .",
    "nielsen  olesen ( n - o ) instability \"",
    "@xcite is characteristic of non - abelian gauge fields because the properties of self - interaction and spin-1 are necessary .",
    "the instabilities in these two limiting cases have been individually studied in the context of early time dynamics of ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collisions @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "however , the strong non - abelain fields that appear in reality ( called a ` glasma ' ) would consist of longitudinally extended flux tubes in which both the electric and magnetic fields are non - vanishing and collinear along the beam axis @xcite .",
    "it is important to investigate particle production in this configuration to understand time evolution of created matter towards a thermalized quark - gluon plasma . in this letter",
    ", we study , within the canonical quantization approach , the gauge field instability ( gluon production ) when both electric and magnetic background fields are present .",
    "we consider the su@xmath0 pure yang - mills theory , and decompose the gauge field @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) into a classical background @xmath3 and a quantum fluctuation @xmath4 around the background : @xmath5 .",
    "we take a covariantly - constant background field @xcite satisfying @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a covariant derivative with respect to the background : @xmath8 , and @xmath9 is a classical field strength : @xmath10 .",
    "we employ the background covariant gauge @xcite : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a gauge parameter ( to be set as @xmath13 ) and @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) is the faddeev  popov ( anti-)ghost . the last covariant derivative @xmath16 contains both the background @xmath17 and the fluctuation @xmath18 . in order to be consistent with the one - loop calculation of the effective action , we retain in the lagrangian up to quadratic terms with respect to the quantum fields .",
    "then , the equations of motion for the quantum fields are linearized as follows : @xmath19    we consider the classical background field which gives spatially constant field strength",
    ". then , one can express the field strength as @xcite @xmath20 where @xmath21 is an abelian field strength and @xmath22 is a color vector , normalized as @xmath23 .",
    "the field strength is given by the gauge potential @xmath24 where @xmath25 is an abelian gauge field giving @xmath26 .",
    "this is actually a solution to eq .  .",
    "the global residual gauge symmetry allows us to rotate the color vector @xmath22 into the cartan subspace of su@xmath0 : @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is a constant su@xmath0 matrix , @xmath29 are generators of su@xmath0 and @xmath30 @xmath31 are elements of the cartan subspace : @xmath32=0 \\}$ ] .",
    "we expand the su@xmath0 space by @xmath30 and @xmath33 , instead of @xmath29 .",
    "here , @xmath34 are eigenvectors of @xmath35 ( i.e. , @xmath30 in the adjoint representation ) : @xmath36 the corresponding eigenvalues @xmath37 may be regarded as an @xmath38-dimensional vector , which is called the root vector . according to this cartan decomposition , we re - organize the quantum fields @xmath4 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 as @xmath41 this decomposition simplifies the interaction between the fluctuations @xmath4 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 and the classical field @xmath42 .",
    "the fields in the cartan subspace , @xmath43 , are free from the background field : @xmath44 , and thus we need not consider these fields in the following .",

    "@xmath54 and @xmath55 are c - number solutions of the equations of motion and , respectively .",
    "@xmath56 are polarization vectors satisfying the orthonormal condition @xmath57 and the completeness condition @xmath58 with the metric @xmath59 such that @xmath60 and other components are vanishing .",
    "we identify the solutions @xmath54 and @xmath55 as positive frequency modes , and @xmath61 and @xmath62 as negative frequency modes .",
    "the positive frequency solutions are to satisfy the following normalization conditions : @xmath63 where the inner product is defined as @xmath64 notice that the norms of the negative - frequency modes have the sign opposite to those of the positive - frequency modes , and the positive and negative frequency modes are orthogonal to each other . with these orthonormal conditions , the canonical commutation relations imposed on new fields @xmath65 yield the following commutation relations : @xmath66 =    \\left [ b_n ^{(\\sigma ) \\alpha } , b_m ^{(\\tau ) \\beta \\dagger } \\right ] = \\tilde{\\eta } ^{\\sigma \\tau } \\delta _ { \\alpha \\beta } \\delta _ { nm } , \\label{com1 } \\\\ \\left\\ { c_n ^\\alpha , \\bar{c } _ m ^{\\beta \\dagger } \\right\\ } =    \\left\\ { d_n ^\\alpha , \\bar{d } _",

    "with the canonical framework defined above , we investigate the quantum dynamics of fluctuations in the collinear color - electric and magnetic background field : @xmath69 which is realized by @xmath70 .",
    "it is convenient to choose the polarization vectors as eigenvectors of the field strength @xmath71 .",
    "then , all the equations that the mode functions @xmath72 and @xmath55 follow can be put together into a klein  gordon - like equation @xmath73   \\phi ( t,\\x   ; m^2 ) = 0 , \\ ] ] where @xmath74 . in the following , the subscript @xmath75 of @xmath76 will be often omitted .",
    "the  mass squared \" @xmath77 represents the effects of spin - electromagnetic field interaction and is given by @xmath78 because the @xmath79 modes acquire pure imaginary @xmath77 , we should suppose that the negative frequency solution for @xmath80 mode is @xmath81 , and _",
    "vice versa_.    let us first consider the case where we have only a color - electric field ( @xmath82 ) .",
    "ambjrn and hughes @xcite have studied the schwinger particle production in the canonical quantization approach in the background covariant gauge  ( [ gauge_fixing ] ) .",
    "one can find exact solutions of eq .   and show that all the mode functions satisfy the normalization conditions and .",
    "therefore , in the pure electric field the canonical quantization can be completed to give particle interpretation of the fields . however , under electric fields , selection of the positive and negative frequencies",
    "is not unique .",
    "there are infinite numbers of solutions satisfying the conditions and .",
    "if there is no electric field , we can choose the positive and negative frequencies uniquely as @xmath83 respecting the translational invariance in time .",
    "in contrast , under electric fields , the system loses that invariance , so that we can not select a specific set of solutions without other criterion . to decide proper solutions , asymptotic wkb criterion",
    "is employed @xcite . in this criterion ,",
    "the positive and negative frequency solutions are selected so that they behave at asymptotic region , @xmath84 , as @xmath85 with @xmath86 being the classical action of a charged particle under the electric field . as a direct consequence of particle production , positive and negative frequency solutions defined at @xmath87 and those at @xmath88 are different .",
    "the former , which are referred to as in - solutions , are @xmath89 with @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "@xmath93 is a parabolic cylinder function .",
    "the latter , out - solutions , are @xmath94 both solutions have the structure of plane waves distorted by the electric field .",
    "associated with these two kinds of mode functions , we get two kinds of particle creation and annihilation operators , @xmath95 and @xmath96 , etc . accordingly , two kinds of vacua @xmath97 and @xmath98 are defined .",
    "the creation and annihilation operators of in and out are related with each other via bogoliubov transformations .",
    "then one can relate the in - vacuum and the out - vacuum and calculate the vacuum persistence probability @xmath99 .",
    "it has been shown that contributions from the unphysical modes , @xmath79 , and those from the ghost modes are totally canceled out , and the pair creation rate @xmath100 defined by @xmath101 with @xmath102 and @xmath103 being space and time volume , respectively , is just twice as large as that of a massless charged scalar field @xcite .",
    "also , we can calculate the momentum distribution of out - particles condensed in the in - vacuum , in other words , the momentum distribution of particles which are created during infinite - time imposition of the electric field . for the physical modes , @xmath104",
    ", we find @xmath105 which depends only on the transverse momentum @xmath106.-dependence of the distribution can not be obtained by the method of the asymptotic wkb criterion . ]",
    "this result is the same as that of a massless charged scalar field .",
    "in contrast , for the unphysical modes , @xmath79 , and the ghost modes , the expectation is vanishing because of their unusual commutation relations and .",
    "in contradistinction to the electric field , the magnetic field has no dynamical effect .",
    "it just discretizes the transverse momenta into the landau levels as @xmath107 under the pure magnetic field ( @xmath108 ) , one can find a solution of eq .   as @xmath109 where @xmath110 and @xmath111 . the spin - magnetic field interaction ( with @xmath112 )",
    "shifts the landau levels as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : landau ] .",
    "notice that the transverse mass squared defined as @xmath113 is negative for the lowest landau level @xmath114 with @xmath115 mode , and the one - particle energy reads @xmath116 .",
    "this is pure imaginary when @xmath117 .",
    "therefore , the mode functions show exponential growth @xmath118 .",
    "this is the n - o instability @xcite .",
    "when this instability occurs , the normalization can not hold , so that we can no longer gain particle interpretation of the field . if the magnetic field is not constant in time and if there are asymptotically free regions where particle modes can be defined by the canonical quantization , the n - o instability could be described as particle production phenomena .",
    "however , as far as the authors know , there has been no explicit demonstration of it",
    ". we will show that we can define asymptotically stable particle modes even in the presence of the constant magnetic field provided there is a constant electric field parallel to the magnetic field .    ]",
    "--3pt    notice that the n - o instability occurs only at low longitudinal momentum region @xmath119 .",
    "under the collinear electric and magnetic fields ( @xmath120 ) , particles are accelerated by the electric field and their momenta increase in time as @xmath121+const . therefore , even if a particle lies in the unstable momentum region @xmath119 at some time , it escapes from there unfailingly at later time .",
    "owing to this mechanism , the exponential growth of the mode function is regularized in the presence of the color - electric field , and we can carry out the canonical quantization and obtain the particle interpretation for all the modes .",
    "indeed , exact solutions of eq",
    ".   under the collinear fields @xmath122 with @xmath123 do not diverge at @xmath88 and satisfy the normalization conditions and .",
    "this is true even for the lowest landau mode with @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "since the magnetic field has no dynamic effect , the selection of the in- and out- mode functions is not affected by it .",
    "therefore , the bogoliubov relations are almost the same as those in the pure electric field .",
    "the differences are the emergence of the landau levels and the level splitting between the two transverse modes ( see eq .  ) . because @xmath77 for the unphysical modes are independent of @xmath124 , cancellation between those modes again holds even in the presence of the magnetic field",
    "actually , the pair creation rate has contributions only from the two physical transverse modes : @xmath125 .\\ ] ] furthermore , the in - vacuum expectations of out - number operators for the unphysical modes are all vanishing also in the presence of the magnetic field .",
    "those for the physical transverse modes are @xmath126 in eqs .   and , the lowest level ( @xmath115 and @xmath114 ) is worthy of great remark . in this mode ,",
    "the effective mass square is negative , @xmath127 , so that the index of the exponential factor is positive : @xmath128 this means that an anomalously large number of gluons are produced in the lowest mode when compared with the usual schwinger mechanism of qed or scalar qed .",
    "this is because the field fluctuations amplified by the n - o instability are converted to real particles by the electric field .",
    "the collinear color electromagnetic field may be realized in flux tubes created at the initial stage of heavy - ion collisions @xcite .",
    "the strongly enhanced particle production causes rapid decay of those coherent fields into particle degrees of freedom , which would be followed by the formation of a quark - gluon plasma .",
    "our analysis has relied on the linear approximation .",
    "if the field amplification by the n - o instability continues for a long time , the linear approximation would get invalid .",
    "a typical time scale of the n - o instability is given by the inverse of the growth rate @xmath129 .",
    "therefore , the time scale when the non - linear corrections become important would be @xmath130 .",
    "actually , it has been demonstrated by numerical calculations that the exponential growth of the gauge fluctuations stops at some time ( later than @xmath131 ) due to non - linear corrections @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , the time scale of the stabilization process by the electric field @xmath132 is given from the condition that a particle is accelerated away from the instability condition @xmath119 , so that @xmath133 . if the electric and magnetic fields are the same order of magnitude , which is a situation expected in a glasma , @xmath132 is the same order as @xmath131 , so that the electric field plays a dominant role to stabilize the n - o instability .",
    "to understand more clearly our result that the n - o instability is stabilized by the electric field and induces the strong particle production , the following simple toy model which describes particle production by an instability may be useful .",
    "let us suppose that , without specification of background fields , a real scalar field suffers an instability during a finite period , @xmath134 .",
    "the mode functions of the field have the following properties : ( i ) for @xmath135 the modes are stable and have the plane wave solutions ; @xmath136 @xmath137 , ( ii ) for @xmath134 the modes are unstable and show exponential growth or decrease ; @xmath138 @xmath139 , and ( iii ) for @xmath140 the modes are again stable ; @xmath141 @xmath142 .",
    "the canonical quantization can be performed at @xmath135 and at @xmath143 , and correspondingly two kinds of particle definitions of ` in ' and ` out ' are obtained .",
    "one can find the relation between these two kinds of particle definitions by smoothly connecting the mode solutions in the three time regimes . if the solution @xmath144 for @xmath135 is smoothly connected to the linear combination of the solutions for @xmath134 , and is subsequently connected to those for @xmath143 as @xmath145 , then the particle annihilation ( creation ) operators of in - particle , @xmath146 , is related with those of out - particle , @xmath147 , by the bogoliubov transformation : @xmath148 .",
    "one can explicitly confirm the condition @xmath149 , which guarantees the unitarity , holds irrespective of the values of @xmath150 , @xmath151 , @xmath152 and @xmath103 .",
    "the number of particles created by the instability is @xmath153 thus , the number of created particles increases exponentially with respect to the time interval of the unstable region , @xmath103 . in this simple demonstration",
    ", the existence of the stable modes in asymptotic regions has been crucial to formulate the particle production in a canonical way .",
    "if we compare this simple model with our original problem of the gluon production , the instability parameter @xmath154 corresponds to @xmath155 .",
    "though there is no explicitly stable region in temporary direction under the constant magnetic field , the electric field provides us with the stable regions in the momentum space , _ i.e. _ @xmath156 .",
    "hence , @xmath103 should be replaced by @xmath133 . by substituting these parameters ,",
    "we find the exponential factor @xmath157 in eq .",
    "roughly reproduces the exact result .",
