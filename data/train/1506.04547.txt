    "there are a multiplicity of different types of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , yet there are only a limited number of fundamental parameters which can determine their behaviours .",
    "there is black hole mass , mass accretion rate and spin , with inclination , abundances and environment as further factors which can affect how the agn is seen as well as non - deterministic factors such the history of the accretion flow ( hysteresis and/or magnetic flux accumulation ) .",
    "black hole mass can now be estimated e.g. through scaling relations using the fwhm of the h@xmath2 line together with optical luminosity .",
    "a thin disc model fit to the optical / uv data then directly gives the absolute accretion rate , @xmath3 , though the outer disc for a given inclination angle ( laor & davis 2011 ) . emission from the inner disc does not affect this as smaller radii emit at higher temperatures , so contribute to the far uv rather than to the optical for typical agn parameters . thus simply observing the optical emission from the outer disc is sufficient to set the absolute mass accretion rate of the entire flow in standard disc models .",
    "the inner disc properties instead determine the total bolometric luminosity as spin sets the inner edge of the disc , and hence the total efficiency .",
    "high prograde spin leads to additional luminosity at higher temperatures from the same mass accretion rate through the outer disc compared to a lower spin .",
    "if the mass , inclination and spin are known , then the absolute @xmath3 through the outer disc directly predicts the total bolometric luminosity , and hence @xmath4 of the accretion flow .",
    "laor & davis ( 2011 ) used this argument in reverse .",
    "they measured @xmath3 from the optical / uv flux , then integrated the observed spectral energy distribution ( sed ) to estimate @xmath5 and hence constrained spin in their sample of agn .",
    "however , there are other ways to constrain spin .",
    "firstly , via the peak temperature and luminosity of the disc continuum as discussed above . this disc continuum fitting technique can be used to good effect in black hole binaries , where the disc peaks at x - ray temperatures ( e.g. ebisawa et al .",
    "1991 ; kubota , makishima & ebisawa 2001 ; done , gierlinski & kubota 2007 ) .",
    "however , in agn the disc typically is expected to peak in the far uv , which is unobservable due to interstellar absorption . instead , the iron line profile can be used to constrain spin .",
    "x - ray illumination of the disc produces a fluorescence iron k@xmath6 line , whose profile contains the imprint of the ( spin dependent ) innermost disc radius as well as the illumination pattern and inclination ( fabian et al . 1989 ; 2000 ) .",
    "the new reverberation technique uses this together with the light travel time delays ( fabian et al .",
    "2009 ) to map the reflecting structures ( see e.g the review by uttley et al .",
    "2014 ) .",
    "multiple agn now have high spin as determined by the iron line profile ( see e.g. the compilation of reynolds 2013 ) .",
    "the most convincing of these have reverberation mapping as well , and tend to be narrow line seyfert 1s ( nls1 ) such as 1h0707 - 495 ( fabian et al .",
    "the iron line profile also gives inclination , so for these systems the optical / uv continuum gives absolute @xmath3 , which , combined with the known spin gives @xmath5 and hence @xmath4 .",
    "here we use this technique on two specific , well studied nls1 , pg 1244 + 026 ( hereafter pg1244 ) and 1h0707 - 495 ( hereafter 1h0707 ) .",
    "these have very similar h@xmath2 line widths , and very similar optical / uv continua so they form a well matched pair in mass and absolute mass accretion rate .",
    "both also have high spin as determined from the iron line / reverberation techniques , though it is clear that this is a much stronger constraint in 1h0707 ( fabian et al .",
    "2009 ; zoghbi et al .",
    "2010 ; kara et al .",
    "2013 ) than in pg1244 ( kara et al .",
    "we derive @xmath4 from the outer disc mass accretion rate and find that both are highly super - eddington .",
    "the disc is unlikely to remain flat under such conditions , with numerical simulations showing that such flows should power a strong , clumpy wind from the inner disc ( takeuchi et al .",
    "2014 ) . inclination with respect to this wind should then be an important additional parameter determining the observational appearance of the inner flow .",
    "this is interesting , as while pg1244 and 1h0707 are very similar as regards their optical / uv emission , they have very different x - ray properties .",
    "1h0707 shows deep x - ray dips , with extremely strong fe k@xmath6 features in these low flux episodes , whereas the dips ( and associated extreme iron features ) are absent in pg1244 .",
    "this difference in x - ray behaviour was classified as ` complex ' and ` simple ' , respectively ( gallo 2006 ) .",
    "reverberation lags are typically very short in the complex nls1 ( 30  s for 1h0707 : fabian et al .",
    "2009 ) and longer in the simple ones ( 200  s for pg1244 : alston , done & vaughan 2014 ) .",
    "we propose that inclination with respect to a strong wind from a super - eddington accretion flow is the major underlying difference between these two different types of nls1 .",
    "absorption in a highly ionised wind can fit the observed iron features seen in the non - dip spectra of 1h0707 , while stochastic occultations by cooler clumps in the wind can produce the dips and give rise to more complex spectral curvature ( hagino et al .",
    "2016 , see also mizumoto , ebisawa & sameshima 2014 ; miller et al . 2007 ; 2010 )",
    "these dips also shorten the reverberation time lags , so that the observed @xmath7 reverberation delay seen in 1h0707 can be produced from an intrinsic lag of 200 - 300  s , as seen in pg1244 ( gardner & done 2015 ) .",
    "more face on inclination angles do not intercept ( much of ) the wind , so do not show the extreme features at iron , nor the dips .",
    "this is very different to the standard lamppost model used to derive the high black hole spin in these objects , where an extremely compact x - ray source on the spin axis of the black hole illuminates a flat disc ( miniutti & fabian 2004 ) . in this geometry ,",
    "the dips are caused by an extremely compact x - ray source on the spin axis of the black hole approaching the event horizon .",
    "the resulting strong light bending focusses the intrinsic continuum away from the observer ( producing the drop in flux ) so it instead strongly illuminates the very inner disc , producing a very centrally concentrated emissivity for the line which can simultaneously explain the very strongly relativistically smeared , reflection dominated emission seen in the dips ( miniutti & fabian 2004 ) .",
    "however , if the lamppost geometry is not correct , then the spins derived from it need not be correct either .",
    "this could remove the requirement that there are high spin _ radio quiet _",
    "objects , re - opening the possibility of the spin - jet paradigm where high spin is a necessary and sufficient trigger for highly relativistic jets .",
    "the classic way to measure black hole spin is via the iron line k@xmath6 profile in the 2 - 10 kev bandpass ( fabian et al . 1989 ; 2000 ) .",
    "1h0707 always shows strong broad features at 6 - 7 kev , especially during the deep x - ray intensity dips .",
    "fitting reflection models to these spectra give a spin measurement which is always high ( e.g. fabian et al .",
    "2004 ; 2009 ; 2012 ) .",
    "the most complete models of zoghbi et al .",
    "( 2010 ) give a disk inner radius of @xmath8 ( corresponding to spin @xmath9 ) for a disc inclination of @xmath10 and emissivity index of @xmath11 .",
    "while these can all be explained within the lamppost model , the data additionally require that iron is overabundant by a factor @xmath12 in order to match the observed features .",
    "fitting the lag - frequency and lag - energy data from reverberation mapping also gives constraints on the black hole mass , spin and disc inclination , though there are significant degeneracies between these parameters from the spectral  timing data alone ( e.g. cackett et al . 2014 ) .",
    "assuming that the lag timescale @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the physical height of the lamppost and @xmath15 is this in terms of gravitational radii , only constrains the product @xmath16 rather than each parameter separately . in 1h0707 ,",
    "the observed 30  s soft lag ( fabian et al . 2009 ; zoghbi et al . 2010 ; 2011 ) corresponds to an intrinsic 80  s light travel time after correcting for spectral dilution , which implies a lamppost height of @xmath17 for a @xmath18 black hole ( kara et al . 2013 ) .",
    "however , the spectral data discussed above strongly require that the lamppost height is small from the strongly centrally peaked emissivity ( e.g. fabian et al .",
    "hence for these data a lamppost height of @xmath19 implies a black hole mass of @xmath20 , though at such low heights relativistic effects become very important .",
    "light bending will increase the proper path length , and time dilation ( shapiro delay ) will increase the time difference .",
    "a lamppost source at height @xmath19 above a flat disc around a maximally spinning black hole has a minimum lag time of @xmath21 ( face on - edge on ) if light travels in straight lines without time dilation .",
    "including all relativistic effects lengthens these to around @xmath22 ( dovciak , private communication , see also dovciak et al .",
    "thus a lamppost height of @xmath19 still implies a @xmath18 black hole .    in sharp contrast , the simple nls1 pg1244 has no deep intensity dips , so the iron features are not so strong and do not of themselves require high spin ( jin et al .",
    "2013 ) , nor very strong iron overabundance ( jin et al .",
    "2013 assume solar , kara et al .",
    "2013 find iron is @xmath23 solar ) .",
    "however , interpreting a ( rather low significance : see alston et al .",
    "2014 ) lag of 1000  s at the iron line energy in a reflection dominated scenario gives @xmath24 ( corresponding to spin @xmath25 ) and inclination of @xmath26 for a lamppost height of @xmath27 above a @xmath28 black hole ( kara et al .",
    "figure 1 shows the optical spectrum of 1h0707 from ctio ( black , leighly & moore 2004 ) together with that of pg1244 from sdss .",
    "these are redshift corrected using @xmath29 and @xmath30 , de - reddened with @xmath31 and @xmath32 ( bessell 1991 ; kalberla et al .",
    "2005 ) , and fluxed with distances of 168.6 and 206.2 mpc , respectively .",
    "note that the redshift of 1h0707 used here is slightly different to that of @xmath33 quoted in the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) from the 6df survey ( jones et al .",
    "2009 ) , as this redshift gave a noticeable offset with respect to the feii lines in pg1244 .",
    "the 6df redshift was calculated from cross - correlation with a late type galaxy template , using the absorption lines .",
    "however , leighly & moore ( 2004 ) detect no absorption lines from the host galaxy in their spectrum , and instead determined a redshift of @xmath34 ( no uncertainty given ) from the broad mgii and h@xmath2 emission lines .",
    "we determine our redshift by cross - correlating the spectrum of 1h0707 with that of pg1244 in the 4000 - 6700    region , after blacking out the regions where strong narrow lines dominate in pg1244 but not in 1h0707 .",
    "this gives @xmath35 factoring in the uncertainty on the pg1244 redshift from sdss .",
    "we use this slightly lower value as we are most interested in a comparison of 1h0707 with pg1244 , but the change in implied distance is less than 2% so this has no significant impact on the luminosity .",
    "we rescale pg1244 by a factor of 0.84 so as to overlay it on top of 1h0707 .",
    "hence the two objects have the same optical luminosity to within 20% .",
    "figure 1 shows that 1h0707 has much weaker narrow emission lines than pg1244 , but that the broad emission lines are extremely similar , especially the strength of the feii emission line blends and the ratio of feii to the broad h@xmath2 ( pg1244 has a narrow h@xmath2 line component which makes it appear stronger ) .",
    "the feii emission is clearly not a factor @xmath36 larger in 1h0707 than in pg1244 , so this does not support the difference in iron abundance suggested by the relativistic reflection fits ( section 2 ) , though we note that the feii strength depends also on @xmath37 as well as abundance ( ferland et al . 2009 ) .",
    "this is discussed further in section 5.2 .",
    "= 0.47    the h@xmath2 line width is determined as in jin et al .",
    "( 2012a ) , i.e. after subtraction of the strong fe ii lines , and subtraction of a narrow component of h@xmath2 with width fixed to that of the [ oiii ] lines .",
    "this gives very similar h@xmath2 fwhm of 980 and 940 km / s , and @xmath38 and @xmath39  ergs  s@xmath40 for 1h0707 and pg1244 , respectively .",
    "thus they have very similar mass estimates from h@xmath2 , with @xmath41 or @xmath42 depending on whether the scaling relations of vestergaard & peterson ( 2006 ) or woo & urry ( 2002 ) are used .",
    "the similarity in line widths do not at all support the factor of nearly 10 difference in mass from the reverberation results .    the bolometric luminosity is typically estimated as @xmath43 ( e.g. kaspi et al .",
    "2000 ) , so both these sources have @xmath44  ergs  @xmath45  s@xmath40 .",
    "this is close to the eddington limit , @xmath46  ergs  s@xmath40 for a black hole mass of @xmath47 .",
    "however , bolometric correction @xmath48 clearly changes with mass and mass accretion rate .",
    "several studies have shown that the ` standard ' value of @xmath49 used above is only appropriate for the broad line seyferts ( @xmath50 ) , while objects around @xmath51 require correction factors of 20 - 40 ( vasudevan & fabian 2007 ; 2009 , jin et al . 2012a ; b ) .",
    "this would put both 1h0707 and pg1244 at @xmath52  ergs  s@xmath40 , strongly super - eddington for either black hole mass .    at such high eddington fractions",
    "it is clearly debatable as to whether the h@xmath2 scaling relations hold .",
    "marconi et al . ( 2008 ) suggest a correction to the mass scalings such that the blr clouds trace the effective gravity . using this ,",
    "the black hole masses increase to around @xmath53 , with @xmath54  ergs  s@xmath40 , so the accretion flow is still close to the eddington limit as required for the higher bolometic correction .",
    "the radiation pressure correction to the mass is not widely used as the general lack of observed wind features for the low ionisation blr lines form a strong argument against such effects being important ( baskin , laor & stern 2014a ) .",
    "physically , this could indicate that the clouds are optically thick to electron scattering , with columns of @xmath55  @xmath56 ( consistent with the low ionisation broad lines forming in the disc : collin - souffrin et al .",
    "1980 ) , or that the radiative acceleration only affects the front face of the cloud ( baskin , laor & stern 2014b ) .",
    "however , part of the h@xmath2 line is clearly blue - shifted ( figure 1 ) , indicating that these objects could be so extreme that even part of the low ionisation lines ( as well as the high ionisation lines such as civ ) come predominantly from a wind ( see also leighly & moore 2004 ; leighly 2004 ) .",
    "the new results from reverberation mapping ( see section 2 ) strongly require that the radiation pressure corrected mass is not appropriate , and that the mass for 1h0707 is @xmath57 .",
    "the similarity of the h@xmath2 emission line widths support a similarly low mass for pg1244 .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]      the wind model sketched above gives a potential geometric explanation for the large difference in x - ray spectral behaviour between simple and complex nls1 .",
    "this difference must have its origin in a difference in one of the parameters which can affect the appearance of the black hole accretion flow , but several sources are seen to transition between simple and complex behaviour ( gallo 2006 ) . thus the difference can not originate with a fixed parameter such as spin . instead , it must be associated with something which can vary .",
    "figure [ fig : sketch ] clearly shows that inclination angle with respect to the wind can make a large difference in the observed properties of the inner x - ray source .",
    "numerical simulations show that the polar and opening angle of the wind can fluctuate stochastically , as well as vary with @xmath37 , so the inclination angle with respect to the wind could be the required parameter determining the difference between simple and complex nls1 .",
    "1h0707 ( complex nls1 ) and pg1244 ( simple nls1 ) have very similar h@xmath2 line widths and optical luminosity , so have similar mass and mass accretion rates to zeroth order , and their masses are most probably low just from x - ray variability timescale arguments .",
    "if 1h0707 is at higher inclination than pg1244 then it should have higher @xmath37 for the same black hole spin .",
    "we take as an example 1h0707 at @xmath58 and pg1244 at @xmath59 , both with low spin and mass of @xmath18 .",
    "the colour(non - colour ) temperature corrected discs give a mass accretion rates of 44(31)@xmath60 eddington for 1h0707 and 13(9 ) for pg1244 , so both are still highly super - eddington , but 1h0707 is more extreme that pg1244 , as required by the optical spectra shown in figure 1 , where 1h0707 lacks the narrow [ oiii ] emission lines .",
    "weak narrow lines are a characteristic of low ionisation broad absorption line ( bal ) qso s ( boroson & meyers 1992 ) , where this is likely due to shielding of the narrow line region by obscuration in a wind ( see also leighly 2004 ) .",
    "if 1h0707 is accreting at a higher eddington ratio , this should also affect other features of the spectrum .",
    "@xmath37 is known to affect the ratio of equivalent widths of emission lines in the broad line region , particularly feii/(broad ) h@xmath2 ( ferland et al .",
    "the iron blends shown for both nls1 in figure 1 are quite similar , and similar also in terms of their ratio of feii / broad h@xmath2 .",
    "if the correlation continues at these high @xmath37 then 1h0707 should have a slightly lower iron abundance that pg1244 in order to produce the same ratio of feii / broad h@xmath2 .",
    "however , it seems likely that the feii / h@xmath2 ratio would also be affected by geometry of the wind , so the stronger wind in a more highly super - eddington flow in 1h0707 could compensate for this .",
    "eddington ratio is also known to correlate strongly with the 2 - 10  kev spectral index ( shemmer et al .",
    "2006 ; vasudevan & fabian 2007 ; 2009 ; jin et al .",
    "1h0707 should then have a higher @xmath61 than pg1244 , though this is poorly constrained from spectral fits .",
    "simple wind models fit to 1h0707 give @xmath62 ( done et al .",
    "2007 ) , while more complex wind models are consistent with @xmath63 ( hagino et al . 2016 ) , whereas pg1244 has @xmath64 ( j13 ) .",
    "hence the data are consistent with a steeper index in 1h0707 as expected if it does have a higher @xmath37 , but do not significantly require this .",
    "thus there is no obvious inconsistency with a model for these two nls1 where they have similar low masses and spins but where 1h0707 has higher inclination , and hence its similar optical flux requires higher mass accretion rate . both are super - eddington , but 1h0707 is more super - eddington that pg1244 , so has a stronger wind which explains its lack of narrow optical line emission by shielding the nlr , suppressing the narrow [ oiii ] lines compared to pg1244 ( leighly 2004 ) .",
    "the combination of more highly super - eddington flow leading to stronger mass loss , together with higher inclination angle means that the wind is more likely to be in the line of sight for 1h0707 .",
    "this interpretation has much less soft x - ray emission than the low mass , high spin models required by the relativistic reflection interpretation .",
    "nonetheless , the observed soft x - ray flux is still a factor @xmath65 larger than the maximum observed from 1h0707 , and @xmath66 that observed in pg1244 .",
    "thus there is still a strong requirement of energy loss from the inner disc in 1h0707 and probably in pg1244 also .",
    "strong energy losses are easily accommodated within the super - eddington flows , as they can advect some of the power , and/or use it to launch a wind .",
    "it could also potentially launch an accretion powered jet , but both 1h0707 and pg1244 are very radio quiet , so substantial jet losses seem unlikely .",
    "a similarly extreme sed shape , with large advection / wind losses is seen in one of the lowest mass agn in the local universe , gh08 ( aka rx  j1140.1 + 0307 : miniutti et al .",
    "2009 ; jin , done & ward 2016 ) .",
    "a low spin solution requires less extreme energy loss , but this is still over - predicts the observed 0.3 - 2  kev luminosity by a factor @xmath67 for the low mass / high inclination solution for 1h0707 , even with no colour temperature correction .",
    "highly relativistic jets are the most dramatic pointer to an accreting black hole .",
    "apparently superluminal radio blobs can be explained only if the bulk lorentz factor , @xmath61 , is high , and if the angle , @xmath68 , between this motion and the observer s line of sight is small . the intrinsic emission of the blob is blue - shifted by a factor @xmath69 and brightened by a factor @xmath70 , so the jet emission from the core appears much more luminous in aligned versus non - aligned objects .",
    "this means that they are extremely bright in radio ( synchrotron from the jet ) and also in high energy gev gamma - rays ( synchrotron self compton or external compton from the jet : e.g. ghisellini et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "another pointer to such relativistic jets is the radio lobe emission on much larger ( kpc ) scales .",
    "this is the interaction of the jet with its ( stationary ) environment , so is easily visible in non - aligned objects .",
    "population studies show that the fanaroff - riely type i and ii galaxies are consistent with being the misaligned versions of the highly beamed bl lacs and flat spectrum radio quasars ( fsrq ) , respectively ( urry & padovani 1995 ) .",
    "most agn do not show such large scale radio structures , but weak core radio emission is ubiquitous",
    ". clearly , the radio luminosity can also be dependent on the accretion power , so a better way to parameterise the importance of the radio jet is via the radio - loudness parameter , @xmath71 , defined as the ratio of flux at 5 ghz to that in the optical b band .",
    "this ratio changes by more than a factor 1000 , even when restricted to black holes of the same mass ( mclure & jarvis 2004 ) , or to black holes of the same @xmath37 ( sikora , stawasz & lasota 2007 ) . clearly , it is very important to understand the origin of this spread in radio power , not only to understand relativistic jets but also to track their impact on their host galaxy via jet mode feedback .",
    "black hole binaries give some insight into the origin of this spread .",
    "these show a dramatic transition in their accretion flow properties at eddington scaled mass accretion rates @xmath72 .",
    "this most probably marks the transition from a geometrically thin disc at high mass accretion rates ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) to a radiatively inefficient flow ( adaf : narayan & yi 1995 ; esin et al .",
    "1997 ) , see e.g. the review by done , gierlinski & kubota ( 2007 ) .",
    "this change in accretion mode is strongly correlated with radio jet properties in the bhb , with a steady , compact jet seen at low luminosities , which collapses , often by ejection of discrete blobs , when the flow makes a transition to a thin disk ( fender , belloni & gallo 2004 ) .",
    "thus a single black hole binary can make a transition from being radio loud to radio quiet ( maccarone , gallo & fender 2003 ) .",
    "however , none of this radio emission is ever associated with a highly relativistic outflow .",
    "even the ejected blobs have speeds which are only mildly relativistic , at @xmath73 ( gallo , fender & pooley 2003 ) while the similarities of the radio - x - ray correlation seen in binaries with very different inclinations shows that the steady compact jet has @xmath74 ( gallo , fender & pooley 2003 ) .",
    "similarly , the ubiquitous radio emission in radio - quiet agn is also not from a highly relativistic jet , as it has comparable in both high and low inclination sources ( seyfert 2 and seyfert 1 s : thean et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "thus the radio emission seen in ` radio - quiet ' agn is mostly from an outflow which is not highly relativistic , but this does not in itself rule out a highly relativistic jet being present in all objects , perhaps forming a spine within a much slower outer sheath , as is also required in the blazars ( chiaberge et al .",
    "2000 ; ghisellini , tavecchio & chiaberge 2005 ; chiaberge et al .",
    "however , a bl lac type spine emerging from every agn with @xmath75 is inconsistent with the statistics of the gev detections of agn .",
    "the spine is highly beamed , so is aligned in only 1 out of @xmath76 agn , and the spine jet should scale with accretion power ( heinz & sunyaev 2003 ) .",
    "nonetheless , the resulting aligned jet is bright enough and the numbers of low luminosity agn are large enough that this over - predicts the observed fermi all sky survey numbers of bl lacs by a factor of 1000 ( gardner & done 2014b ) .",
    "current consensus is that all jets are probably powered by a combination of rotation and magnetic field , but there are two main models for their formation , either using the rotational energy of the black hole ( blandford & znajek 1977 , hereafter bz or spin powered jet ) , or the accretion flow ( blandford & payne 1982 , hereafter bp or accretion powered jet ) .",
    "high black hole spin producing a spin powered jet has long been identified as the possible trigger for launching and powering the most highly relativistic jets ( blandford & znajek 1977 ; begelman , blandford & rees 1984 ; wilson & colbert 1995 ) .",
    "this is supported by recent numerical simulations of the accretion flow which show that truly relativistic outflows are produced predominantly by spin power , while lower velocity outflows are driven by a combination of bp and other mechanisms ( see e.g. the review by yuan & narayan 2014 ) .",
    "there are two types of jet in theory and numerical simulations , one highly relativistic and one not , and two types of jet seen in observations , one highly relativistic and one not .",
    "it is clearly inherently a very attractive idea to associate the highly relativistic jets with bz and hence high spin black holes , and the rest to low spin black holes producing only accretion powered outflows ( e.g. maraschi et al .",
    "the only reason this very attractive idea was dropped was the observational evidence for high black hole spin in radio quiet objects ( ghisellini et al .",
    "however , the majority of high spin measurements of radio - quiet objects are for complex nls1 such as 1h0707 ( see e.g. the compilation of reynolds 2013 ) . if these other nls1 are likewise super - eddington , as claimed by collin & kawaguchi ( 2004 ) , then these also have inner discs which are unlikely to be flat , inconsistent with the lamppost / flat disc geometry used to derive the high spin values .",
    "if these high spin values are not robust then this removes the argument against the simplest models of jets , whereby a low lorentz factor accretion powered jet is present in all sources , though its structure and power depends on the accretion flow configuration , with a spin powered jet only in the highest spin objects , again with its structure and power depending on the accretion flow configuration .",
    "high spin can then be a necessary and sufficient condition for a highly relativistic jet .",
    "if instead the ` complex ' nls1 do indeed have high spin , then the trigger for highly relativistic jets must instead be some additional , external parameter such as accretion of magnetic flux from the halo ( sikora & begelman 2013 ) .",
    "such models have no predictive power , which limits the confidence with which the jet mode feedback can be modelled in cosmological simulations of the growth of large scale structure in the universe ( e.g. bower et al .",
    "both 1h0707 and pg1244 have optical / uv spectra which clearly require super - eddington mass accretion rates through their outer disc .",
    "however , these over - predict the observed bolometric luminosities so there must also be advective and/or kinetic losses . the inner accretion disc is then not at all likely to be flat , as assumed in the lamppost models , with a smooth shape produced by pure advection losses but with an additional clumpy turbulent wind produced in the numerical simulations .",
    "any such vertical structure on the disc means that inclination angle is important , and can dramatically alter our view of the central regions .",
    "we suggest that this is the origin of the distinction between ` simple ' and ` complex ' nls1 , with the characteristic deep x - ray intensity dips seen in the ` complex ' nls1 being produced by occultation of the central source by the upper edge of the vertical structure .",
    "we speculate that this may allow low spin models for the ` complex ' nls1 , in which case high black hole spin may be a necessary and sufficient condition required to produce highly relativistic jets .",

    "<S> relativistic reflection models of the x - ray spectrum of the ` complex ' narrow line seyfert 1 ( nls1 ) 1h 0707 - 495 require a high spin , moderate inclination , low mass black hole . with these parameters </S>",
    "<S> fixed , the observed optical / uv emission directly determines the mass accretion rate through the outer disc and hence predicts the bolometric luminosity . </S>",
    "<S> this is @xmath0 the eddington limit . </S>",
    "<S> such a disc should power a strong wind , and winds are generically expected to be clumpy . changing inclination angle with respect to a clumpy wind structure gives a possible explanation for the otherwise puzzling difference between ` complex ' nls1 such as 1h 0707 - 495 and ` simple ' ones like pg 1244 + 026 . lines of sight which intercept the wind show deep absorption features at iron from the hot phase of the wind , together with stochastic dips and complex absorption when the clumps occult the x - ray source ( complex nls1 ) , whereas both these features are absent for more face - on inclination ( simple nls1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this geometry is quite different to the clean view of a flat disc which is assumed for the spin measurements in relativistic reflection models , so it is possible that even 1h 0707 - 495 has low spin . </S>",
    "<S> if so , this re - opens the simplest and hence very attractive possibility that high black hole spin is a necessary and sufficient condition to trigger highly relativistic ( bulk lorentz factor @xmath1 ) jets .    </S>",
