    "rydberg molecules formed by the low - energy scattering of a rydberg electron and a ground - state atom constitute a distinct class of molecular states that have in recent years become the subject of significant theoretical and experimental interest .",
    "developments include studies of diatomic rydberg molecules in low - angular - momentum rydberg s - states  @xcite , p - states  @xcite , and d - states  @xcite , the realization of coherent bonding and dissociation of s - type molecules  @xcite , and the first observation of a permanent electric dipole moment in a homonuclear molecule  @xcite .",
    "polyatomic rydberg molecules have also been generated  @xcite and employed in a demonstration of the continuous transition between a few - body to many - body regime in an ultracold quantum gas  @xcite .",
    "the theoretical framework for these molecules is generally well - established .",
    "the interaction between a low - energy rydberg electron and ground - state atom can be described using a fermi pseudo - potential approach  @xcite . in the fermi model ,",
    "the ground - state atom is treated as a delta - function perturber of the rydberg - electron wave function , resulting in oscillatory potential curves with localized minima capable of sustaining bound molecular states . in alkali systems ,",
    "the potential curves are strongly affected by low - energy @xmath6s - wave and @xmath6p - wave electron - atom scattering resonances  @xcite .",
    "the influence of these scattering resonances on the potentials has been studied in rb@xmath1 .",
    "the @xmath6s interaction leads to so - called `` trilobite '' molecules  @xcite , which are very long - range ( their size is on the order of @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the principal quantum number of the rydberg level ) .",
    "the @xmath6p interaction produces potentials  @xcite that are about an order of magnitude deeper and about a factor of five shorter - range than the `` trilobite '' potentials .",
    "the molecular potentials , wave functions and electric dipole moments for both rb@xmath1 and cs@xmath1 have also been calculated using a green s function approach , accounting for the finite size of the perturbing ground - state atom via an effective short - range electron - atom interaction potential  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the electron - atom scattering interaction , the molecular potentials and properties of long - range rydberg molecules are dependent on the rydberg - atom wave function as well as the angular - momentum couplings of the rydberg- and ground - state constituents .",
    "rydberg molecules exhibit a broad range of different angular momentum coupling schemes . for low-@xmath7 rydberg molecules ( @xmath10 in rubidium ) , the angular - momentum coupling configurations span three hund s cases [ ( a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) ] , dictated by the relative strength of the rydberg atom s fine structure coupling compared to that of the @xmath11 scattering interaction . the rb@xmath12 molecules are unique among the low-@xmath7 molecules because their scattering and fine - structure couplings are comparable , and fall anywhere between two hund s cases ( a ) and ( c ) by a mere change in principal quantum number @xmath9 . for high-@xmath7 rydberg molecules , the molecular binding interaction is stronger than the fine structure coupling , and is comparable to the hyperfine coupling of the ground - state perturber .",
    "inclusion of the 5s@xmath2 hyperfine coupling in the model generates additional adiabatic potentials of mixed triplet and singlet character . for both high- and low-@xmath7 molecules , the hyperfine structure results in additional adiabatic potentials deep enough to sustain bound states .    in this work we present a study on the influence of angular - momentum couplings on the properties of long - range rydberg molecules .",
    "we first describe a fermi model for rydberg molecules with the relevant angular - momentum couplings included . in our analysis",
    "we include singlet and triplet s- and p - wave scattering . by selectively enabling the different interactions in the model ,",
    "the effects of each of these individual interactions on the adiabatic molecular potentials are revealed .",
    "typical vibrational - state wave functions , binding energies , lifetimes , and dipole moments are discussed with an emphasis on the role of angular - momentum couplings .",

    "adiabatic potentials near @xmath149 of @xmath0rb@xmath1 rydberg + 5s@xmath2 molecules a ) without and b ) with hyperfine structure included .",
    "the plots indicate the `` trilobite '' potentials  @xcite , the dominant types of scattering interactions leading to deep potentials , the asmyptotic states of the potentials , the regions where bound `` trilobite '' molecules may be found ( gray areas ) , and the intersections between `` trilobite '' potentials and @xmath143 ( @xmath150 ) lines ( dashed circles ) .",
    ", width=321 ]    the `` trilobite '' molecules  @xcite generated by the @xmath6s interaction are long - range and on the order of 10  ghz deep , which is on the same order as the hyperfine interaction of the @xmath14 perturber .",
    "it is therefore of interest to explore hyperfine effects on the `` trilobite '' adiabatic potentials . in figs .",
    "7a and b we show these potentials without and with hyperfine coupling for @xmath149 , for all relevant values of @xmath151 and @xmath152 , respectively .",
    "while the hyperfine interaction does not affect the general shape and depth of the `` trilobite '' potentials , with hyperfine structure included there are three instead of only one .",
    "since the number of @xmath6p potential curves also triples , the crossing pattern between @xmath6s and @xmath6p potentials becomes considerably more complex , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : trilobite ] . considering that the modulations near the bottom of the `` trilobite '' potentials are several 100  mhz deep , which is sufficient to support individual bound vibrational states , the hyperfine structure is expected to have profound effects on the detailed vibrational level structure of these molecules . in fig .",
    "7b , one may expect to find long - lived @xmath6s - dominated states in the gray regions .",
    "further , as indicated by the circles in fig .  7b , the crossing locations and the detailed coupling behavior of @xmath7=3 rydberg levels ( which are optically accessible form low - lying atomic states ) to molecular states in the long - range potentials also strongly depend on the hyperfine structure of the system under investigation .",
    "in summary , we have systematically explored the role of fine - structure and hyperfine angular - momentum couplings in @xmath0rb@xmath1 molecules formed between rydberg and 5s@xmath2 ground - state atoms .",
    "as has been done extensively in previous work , we have treated the electron-5s@xmath2 scattering with a fermi model that includes s - wave and p - wave singlet and triplet scattering .",
    "the fine structure mostly influences the behavior of low-@xmath7 rydberg molecules .",
    "we have explored in detail how @xmath0rb@xmath153 molecules realize hund s cases ( a ) and ( c ) .",
    "the hyperfine structure originates in the perturber atom and therefore has consequences for all types ( low-@xmath7 and high-@xmath7 ) of rydberg molecules . in the case of @xmath0rb@xmath153 molecules , mixing of singlet and triplet potentials results in a set of shallow adiabatic potentials , whose quasi - bound states should be experimentally observable ( in addition to those in the hyperfine - independent pure triplet potentials ) .",
    "we have obtained electric and magnetic dipole moments , which could , in future work , be measured spectroscopically in weak electric and magnetic fields .",
    "the hyperfine structure has also been seen to alter the deep , @xmath6s - scattering - induced trilobite potentials as well as their crossing behavior with @xmath7=3 rydberg states ; experimental spectroscopic studies should reveal these details . since molecular level energies and properties are very sensitive to the scattering phase shifts used in the fermi model , we expect that spectroscopy of rydberg molecules can serve as a sensitive tool to provide measurement - based input to future theoretical studies in low - energy electron scattering .",
