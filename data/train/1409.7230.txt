    "recent studies have shown that the cmd of a small but increasing number of gcs is made of two or more continuous sequences of stars which run from the bottom of the ms up to the red - giant branch ( rgb ) and correspond to stellar populations with different content of light elements and helium ( e.g.milone et al.2012a ; piotto et al.2014 and references therein ) .",
    "the most - widely accepted possibility is that gcs have experienced at least two episodes of star formation , with second - generation star formed from material polluted by a previous stellar generation ( e.g.ventura et al.2001 ; decressin et al.2007 ; de mink et al.2009 ; denissenkov & hartwick2014 , but see bastian et al.2013 and cassisi & salaris2014 for an alternative scenario ) .",
    "the knowledge of the helium content of multiple stellar populations provides constraint on the nature of the polluters and is fundamental to shed light on the series of events that led from massive clouds in the early universe to the gcs we see today .",
    "a correct determination of the stellar age , mass , and mass function requires accurate measure of y. since the 1960s , metallicity has been considered as the main parameter governing the hb morphology .",
    "however the presence of clusters with the same [ fe / h ] but different hb , suggests that at least another parameter is needed ( see catelan2009 ; dotter et al.2010 ; gratton et al.2010 ; milone et al.2014 and references therein for recent review ) . for a long time helium",
    "has been considered a viable second - parameter candidate ( dantona et al.2002 ; dantona & caloi2004 ) .",
    "this idea was however difficult to test as it requires the determination of helium in a large number of gcs and these measurements were challenging .",
    "there are three main techniques used in literature to estimate the helium abundance of stellar populations in gcs .",
    "firstly , helium can be inferred from spectroscopy of very warm stars , like hb stars ( see villanova et al.2009 , 2012 ; marino et al.2014 ) .",
    "if this method is able to provide direct determination of helium , it can be applied to stars in a limited temperature interval where spectroscopic analysis is difficult .",
    "indeed , highly excited he lines are not visible in stars cooler than temperatures @xmath28500  k , while stars with temperatures higher than @xmath211500  k are subjected to phenomena like he sedimentation and the levitation of metals which alter the original surface abundance . furthermore , since the distinct stellar populations in gcs usually occupy different regions along the hb ( marino et al.2011 , 2013 ; lovisi et al.2012 ; gratton et al.2011 , 2012 , 2013 ) , the hb segment with t@xmath28500 - 11500  k provides partial information only .",
    "a second spectroscopic approach is based on the analysis of chromospheric infrared lines in red - giant stars ( pasquini et al.2011 ; dupree et al.2014 ) , as done so far for a few stars in ngc2808 and @xmath3centauri only . however , chromospheric lines are very difficult to shape and sophisticated choromospheric models are required to infer stellar abundances . a third approach to infer helium variations in gcs is based photometry . indeed ,",
    "recent work suggests that the analysis of multiple mss and rgbs in the color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) may provide a more efficient method to infer the helium content of multiple stellar populations in gcs ( see milone et al.2013 and references therein ) . in visual bands , helium impacts the luminosity of the ms star through the stellar temperature ( dantona et al.2002 , 2005 ) .",
    "since helium - enhanced stars have bluer colors than helium - normal stars with the same luminosity , multiple mss can provide useful tool to infer the helium abundance of stellar populations through their color separation .",
    "recent investigations on multiple sequences based on high precision photometry suggest that multiple stellar populations with different helium content could be a common feature of gcs ( milone et al.2014 ) .",
    "the helium variation measured so far ranges from @xmath1y@xmath20.01 in the cases of ngc6397 and ngc288 ( milone et al.2012b ; piotto et al.2013 ) up to @xmath20.12 or more in ngc2808 and @xmath3centauri ( piotto et al.2007 ; bedin et al.2004 ; norris2004 ; king et al.2012 ) .",
    "the internal helium variation in gcs seems to correlate with both the cluster mass and the color extension of the hb : massive clusters and gcs with very - extended hbs also host stellar populations that are highly helium enhanced ( milone et al.2014 ) .",
    "however , i note that these conclusions are based on a small sample of gcs , which includes those objects where high - precision photometry was available to allow the helium measurements from multiple sequences .",
    "the massive ngc6266 is an ideal candidate to investigate the relation between cluster mass , hb morphology and the helium content of multiple stellar populations .",
    "this gc hosts two main stellar populations with different content of c , mg , al , and na ( yong et al.2014 ) and is among the ten most luminous galactic gcs ( @xmath4=@xmath59.18 , harris1996 updated as in 2010 ) .",
    "it exhibits a very extended hb that is well populated both on the red and the blue side of the rrlyrae instability strip ( e.g.piotto et al.2002 ; beccari et al.2006 ; valenti et al.2007 ) , and hosts a large populations of rrlyrae stars whose periods agree with the oosterhoff type i group ( contreras et al.2005 , 2010 ) . in this paper",
    ", i will exploit _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) photometry to investigate , for the first time , multiple populations along the ms of ngc6266 and estimate their helium content .",
    "to investigate multiple stellar populations in ngc6266 i have used images collected with the wide - field channel of the advanced camera for surveys ( wfc / acs ) and the ultraviolet and visual channel of the wide field camera 3 ( uvis / wfc3 ) on board of _ hst_. details on the dataset are provided in table  1 .",
    "the poor charge - transfer efficiency ( cte ) in the wfc / acs and uvis / wfc3 images have been corrected by using the recipe and the software by anderson & bedin(2010 ) .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     atmospheric models for the ms stars with @xmath6=@xmath7 have been calculated by using the atlas12 code ( kurucz1993 ; sbordone et al.2004 ) and have been used to generate synthetic spectra with synthe ( kurucz & avrett1981 ) at a resolution of @xmath8=600 from 2800 to 10000 .",
    "results are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : spettri ] for ms stars at @xmath7=20.6 .",
    "synthetic spectra for these stars are shown in panel ( a ) , which compares the spectrum corresponding to the o - rich composition ( red ) , and those corresponding to the o - poor composition at y=0.246 ( black ) and y=0.320 ( blue ) .",
    "the flux ratios of the black and blue spectra with respect to the red ones are plotted in panel ( b ) .",
    "finally , panel ( c ) shows the normalized response of the uvis / wfc3 and the acs / wfc filters used in this paper .",
    "synthetic spectra of o - poor and o - rich stars have been integrated over the transmission curves of the f390w uvis / wfc3 and the f435w , f625w , and f658n acs / wfc filters to determine synthetic colors .",
    "the filled circles in the panel ( d ) of fig .  [ fig : spettri ] show the @xmath9 color difference between the fiducial line of the two mss at @xmath7=20.6 against the central wavelength of the given x filter ; the color differences from theoretical models are represented with open symbols .",
    "the o - poor model with primordial helium ( triangles ) provides a very poor fit with the observations thus demonstrating that the two stellar populations of ngc6266 have different helium abundance .    to determine the value of y that best matches the cmd sequences ,",
    "i have compared observations with synthetic colors derived from helium - enhanced blue - ms stars with different values of helium assumed , ranging from y=0.247 to 0.400 in steps of 0.001 .",
    "the best fit between observations at @xmath1020.6 corresponds to the case where the o - poor population is enhanced in helium by @xmath1y=0.074  dex ( blue circles ) .",
    "this procedure has been repeated for @xmath7=20.2 , 20.4 , 20.8 , and 21.0  mag .",
    "the values of @xmath11 , log(@xmath12 ) , and @xmath1y that provide the best fit are listed in table  3 for each value of @xmath7 . from the average",
    "i obtain @xmath1y=0.078@xmath00.003 , where the error is determined as the rms of the five determinations of @xmath1y divided by the square root of four .",
    "the helium abundance inferred from this method depends on the chemical composition assumed for the red and the blue ms .",
    "the main contribution may come from the nitrogen abundance , which affects the f390w magnitude trough the nh band around @xmath133300  . to quantify the impact of the choice of n on the inferred @xmath1y",
    ", i repeated the same procedure above for two extreme scenarios where : i ) the blue ms is highly n - enhanced by 2 dex with respect to the red ms and ii ) the two mss have the same n abundance .",
    "from the first scenario i infer a value of @xmath1y which is 0.011 dex larger than the previous estimate , while the later scenario corresponds to a @xmath1y lower than 0.007 dex with respect to the best estimate .    in order to investigate the impact of the adopted abundance of c and o on the estimate of helium abundance",
    ", i again repeated the procedure above by changing the values of [ c / fe ] and [ o / fe ] adopted for the blue ms by @xmath00.4 dex .",
    "in all the cases the resulting @xmath1y is consistent with the best estimate within 0.001 dex .",
    "similarly , i verified that variations in al , mg , and na do not affect @xmath1y .",
    "it is worth noting that the adopted values of [ c / fe ] come from spectroscopy of rgb stars . as pointed out by the referee , both theory and observations",
    "have shown that as a star ascend the rgb , carbon and nitrogen are exposed to mixing phenomena which alter the original surface abundance of c and n , while maintaining constant c+n ( e.g.iben1967 ; charbonnel1994 ; gratton et al.2000 ; martell et al.2008 ; angelou et al.2011 and references therein ) . to estimate the effect of mixing on the results of the paper",
    ", i assumed that both red- and blue - ms stars have 0.3-dex higher c abundance lower than that inferred from the rgb by yong et al.(2014 ) .",
    "the adopted carbon variation between ms and rgb stars approximately matches the predictions from models by angelou et al.(2011 ) for cn - weak and cn - strong stars in m3 .",
    "[ n / fe ] has been determined with the criteria that the sum of carbon plus nitrogen remains constant .",
    "the obtained nitrogen abundance of red - ms stars is 0.3-dex lower than that inferred from the rgb , while , in the case of the helium - rich population of ngc6266 , an enhancement in c by 0.3 dex leaves n almost unchanged .",
    "i again derived @xmath1y by using the procedure above but assuming [ c / fe]=@xmath50.1 and [ n / fe]=0.2 for the ms , and [ c / fe]=@xmath50.5 and [ n / fe]=1.6 .",
    "i infer a value of @xmath1y which is 0.004 dex larger than the best estimate .",
    "this investigation shows that , while the derived helium abundance does not depend on the choice of c , o , mg , al , and na , the adopted nitrogen abundance can affect the value of @xmath1y by @xmath20.01 dex .",
    "i conclude that the group of blue - ms stars analyzed in this paper is enhanced in helium by @xmath1y=0.08@xmath00.01 dex with respect to the red ms .",

    "[ fig : sep ] have been represented with red and blue points , respectively .",
    "two isochrones from dotter et al.(2008 ) have been superimposed onto the cmd .",
    "both of them have the same iron abundance ( [ fe / h]=@xmath51.15 ) and [ @xmath17/fe]=0.40 , but different helium content of y=0.246 ( orange - dashed line ) and y=0.324 ( cyan - dashed line ) .",
    "the helium difference corresponds to that derived from the analysis above .",
    "i adopted for all the isochrones reddening , e(b@xmath5v)=0.52 , age of 12.5 gyr , and a distance modulus , @xmath18=15.55 which provide the best fit with the observations .",

    "[ sec : elio ] the abundance of c , n , o have a significant effect on the @xmath16 color of red- and blue - ms stars .",
    "to estimate it , i have used the procedure described in sect .",
    "[ sec : elio ] to calculate two sets of synthetic spectra for blue - ms stars with y=0.324 at the reference magnitudes @xmath22= 20.4 , 20.8 , and 21.2 .",
    "i assumed different chemical - composition mixtures for each set of spectra .",
    "for the first one , i adopted the same c , n , o abundances used for red - ms stars ( [ c / fe]=@xmath50.4 , [ n / fe]=0.5 , [ o / fe]=0.8 ) , and in the second group i used the same chemical composition of the blue ms ( [ c / fe]=@xmath50.8 , [ n / fe]=1.6 , [ o / fe]=0.2 ) .",
    "spectra have been used to derive synthetic @xmath16 colors as in sect .",
    "[ sec : elio ] .",
    "n - rich stars have slightly redder color than n - poor ones , thus suggesting that , when the detailed light - element abundance of the two populations is taken into account , the color difference between the isochrones decreases by @xmath20.02 mag as indicated by the cyan arrows plotted in the panel ( @xmath21 ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : isocrone ] . in the panels ( @xmath23 ) , ( @xmath24 ) , and ( @xmath25 ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : isocrone ] , i have extended the analysis to the @xmath6 vs.@xmath26 cmd . in this case the color distance between the fiducial of the blue ms and the helium - rich isochrone is smaller . indeed",
    "the abundance of c , n , o affects the @xmath26 by @xmath20.005 mag as indicated by the cyan arrows in the panel ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "the comparison with isochrones of this section reinforces the conclusion that the two mss of ngc6266 are consistent with two stellar populations with a difference in helium of @xmath20.08 dex .",
    "moreover , as discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec : cmd ] , the red ms is broadened much more than can be accounted for by photometric errors in @xmath16 by @xmath20.03 mag .",
    "i have used isochrones from dotter et al.(2008 ) with [ fe / h]=@xmath51.15 and different helium to estimate the helium difference that would led to the observed spread and found that , if helium is the only cause of the ms broadening , then it would imply a spread in helium by @xmath20.025 dex .",
    "i used photometry from acs / wfc and wfc3/uvis on board of _ hst _ to investigate stellar populations in ngc6266 .",
    "the cmds have been corrected for differential reddening , and most of the field stars have been separated from probable cluster members on the basis of stellar proper motions .    the presented photometric analysis shows , for the first time , that ngc6266 exhibits a complex and multiple ms . specifically , a red and blue ms have been detected and found to host the 79@xmath01% and the 21@xmath01% of ms stars , respectively . in the studied luminosity interval , between @xmath21 and @xmath22 f658n mag below the ms turn off , the color separation between the red and the blue ms is about 0.1  mag in @xmath27 , and decreases for shorter color baseline like @xmath26 and @xmath28 .",
    "in contrast , the sgb does not show any significant vertical spread , even at the level of a few hundreds of magnitude .",
    "i have demonstrated that the double ms in ngc6266 is intrinsic and can not be due neither to photometric errors nor to residual differential reddening .",
    "this fact demonstrates that the red and the blue ms of this massive gc correspond to distinct stellar populations .",
    "recent work has shown that the analysis of multiple mss from multi - wavelength photometry allows us to infer precise determination of the helium content of multiple stellar populations . to determine the helium content of stellar populations in ngc6266 , synthetic spectra assuming different chemical - composition mixtures have been calculated for ms stars , and the corresponding predicted colors have been integrated through the _ hst _ filters to allow the comparison with the observed ones .",
    "the result of this comparison is that the red ms is consistent with a stellar population with primordial helium , and o - rich / n - poor , while the blue ms is consistent with being made of he - enhanced , o - poor / n - rich stars .",
    "the enhancement in the helium mass fraction of the blue - ms stars has been derived to be @xmath1y=0.08@xmath00.01 .",
    "moreover , the color width of the red ms is much larger that that of blue - ms stars .",
    "this additional broadening could be due by an intrinsic spread in y of @xmath20.025 dex among red - ms stars and suggests that the red ms hosts two or more sub - populations of stars .",
    "dantona et al.(2002 ) first investigated the possibility that stellar populations with different helium abundance may be responsible for the hb morphology of gcs .",
    "this group of authors have shown that the hb of ngc2808 is consistent with three stellar populations , each with distinct content of helium .",
    "they have suggested that the red hb of this cluster is made of stars with primordial ( y@xmath20.25 ) , while blue - hb stars are helium enhanced up to y@xmath20.32 and y@xmath20.38 , with the hottest hb stars also having the highest helium content ( dantona & caloi 2004 , 2008 ; dantona et al.2005 ) .",
    "this scenario has been confirmed by the discovery by piotto et al.(2007 ) that ngc2808 hosts a triple ms and by the direct measurement of helium abundance from high - resolution spectroscopy of hb stars ( marino et al.2014 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : red ] of this paper as well as fig .",
    "4 from piotto et al.(2002 ) shows that ngc6266 exhibits an extended hb which is populated on both sides of the rrlyrae instability strip .",
    "as suggested by the referee , stars in the bluest tail of the hb of ngc6266 could be the precursors of blue - ms stars , in close analogy with what observed in ngc2808 .",
    "spectroscopy of hb stars together with suitable theoretical hb models ( e.g.dantona et al.2005 ; busso et al.2007 ; di criscienzo et al.2014 ) are mandatory to firmly establish the location of multiple stellar populations along the hb .",
    "the range of helium abundance variations has been estimated in a few gcs to date .",
    "so far , helium variations larger than @xmath1y@xmath20.07 have been detected in four massive gcs with extended hb , namely @xmath3centauri , ngc6441 , ngc2808 , and ngc2419 .",
    "less - massive gcs , with less - extended hb , like ngc288 , ngc6397 , and ngc6752 , also have smaller helium variation ( e.g.king et al.2012 ; bellini et al.2013 ; piotto et al.2007 , 2013 ; di criscienzo et al.2010 , 2011 ; milone et al.2012b , 2013 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : elio ] shows the logarithm of the maximum helium difference among stellar populations in gcs based on the analysis of multiple mss or multiple rgbs , as a function of the absolute magnitude of the host cluster .",
    "black dots mark the eleven gcs studied in literaturey@xmath20.02 , nardiello et al.(2014 ) ) and ngc7089 @xmath1y@xmath20.07 , milone et al.(in preparation ) . ]",
    "while the value for ngc6266 , inferred here , is marked with a red circle .",
    "an inspection of this plot immediately suggests that there is a significant correlation between log@xmath1y and @xmath4 with a spearman s rank correlation coefficient @xmath29=@xmath50.70 .",
    "the recent discovery that multiple stellar populations with different helium abundance are a common feature of gcs , provides a new perspective to understand the morphology of their hb and shed light on the second - parameter phenomenon .",
    "freeman & norris(1981 ) suggested that both a @xmath30 parameter that varies from cluster to cluster , and a @xmath31 parameter that varies within the cluster , are needed to explain the hb shape in gcs .",
    "milone et al.(2014 ) analyzed the hb morphology of 74 gcs observed with acs / wfc and found that the color distance between the rgb and the reddest part of the hb ( @xmath32 ) correlates with the metallicity and age of the hosting gc .",
    "they concluded that metallicity and age are the main @xmath30 parameters defining the hb morphology in gcs .",
    "the same authors also found that the color extension of the hb ( @xmath33 ) correlates with the cluster mass .",
    "the relation between the gc mass and @xmath1y shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : elio ] suggests that the range of helium , associated with the presence of multiple stellar populations , is the main @xmath31 parameter .",
    "the reported results for ngc6266 , which is among the ten most - massive gcs in the milky way and exhibits a very - extended hb , fit very well in the observational scenario for the hb morphology presented in milone et al .",
    "indeed , the large helium difference between the two mss of this massive gc further supports the idea of a close relationship among @xmath1y , gc mass , and hb extension .",
