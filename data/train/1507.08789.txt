    "however , in reality , any chemical reaction is a combination of the physical breaking of chemical bonds , splitting , and diffusion of new chemical moieties over a time span  a defined elementary timestep needed for the progression of the spatial - limited chemical process .",
    "therefore , for the description of the b - z reaction , we chose a kind of cellular automaton  a hodgepodge machine , see e.g. @xcite  for the time - spatially discrete simulation .    in brief , we consider four processes in the hodgepodge machine algorithm which describe the behavior of the chemical reaction at the quantum ( electron ) scale  @xcite :    1 .",

    "more precisely , we aim to understand how the ratio @xmath0 influences the processes under the items 34 .",
    "we used the wilensky netlogo hodgepodge model @xcite , which was modified in two ways to improve its similarity to the b - z experiment @xcite . the first change ( the generation of the random - exponential noise )",
    "was introduced to ensure that the simulation started with a small number of ignition points .",
    "the second modification ( the rounding of the weighted occupied neighboring cells ) was implemented in order to allow us to start from these few points , where the original rule ( the calculation in integers ) did not .",

    "the final states of the b - z reaction and hodgepodge simulation are considered to be limit sets , and the courses of the experiment and its simulation are called trajectories through the state space .",

    "the @xmath0 ratio of 1:7 ( fig .",

    "[ fig : typical_state_trajectory_phases ] ) , after the ignition , the structures evolved in a sequence of square waves with round centers .",
    "after that , the first spiral doublet arose in the vicinity of two central objects such that the waves collided in one point .",

    "this paper examines the suitability of the hodgepodge machine simulation for the description of the belousov - zhabotinsky self - organizing reaction .",
    "the reason for doing so is that the hodgepodge machine represents a time - spatial discretization .",
    "the time - spatial discretization is the idealized process , where the time element determines ( a ) a set of events achieved at the time within a spatial element ( a cell )  the @xmath4 constant  and ( b ) the rest of events on the spatial element s ( cell s ) borders  the @xmath1 constant .",
    "we may consider analogies for such behaviour in known energy transfer processes , i.e. the difference between resonance energy transfer and energy transfer in systems of overlapping orbitals .",
    "the analysis of these constants showed that the @xmath0 ratio determined the thickness of waves and the course of the state space trajectory irrespective to the total @xmath1 value .",
    "the decreasing @xmath0 ratio led to the loss of the wave structure , which eventually resulted in a fully diffusive picture .",
