    "the editors of the recently - created journal _ cilia _ called their inaugural article `` cilia - the prodigal organelle '' @xcite .",
    "this is perhaps an appropriate denotation for a biological appendage found on the surface of a variety of eukaryotic cells , with a fascinating and still not fully understood relationship between internal structure and biological function @xcite .",
    "cilia not only have the capacity to transport surrounding fluids by means of periodic movements but they also play important sensory roles @xcite . remarkably , their basic morphology and internal structure ( the so - called axoneme ) , which is the same as in all eukaryotic flagella , has been conserved throughout evolution @xcite .",
    "the active dynamics of cilia plays a crucial role in a major aspect of biology , namely fluid transport @xcite .",
    "the motion of biological fluids induced by the collective beating of an array of cilia is the third major form of mechanical fluid transport done by the inner organs of superior animals , ranking only behind blood pumping and peristaltic motion . in humans ,",
    "the flow produced by the deformation of cilia is involved in the transport of several biological fluids , including the removal of tracheobronchial mucus in the respiratory track @xcite , the transport of ovulatory mucus and the ovum in the oviduct of the female reproductive track @xcite , and the motion of epididymal fluid in the efferent ducts of the male reproductive track @xcite .",
    "failure of the transport functionality of cilia can lead to serious illness of the respiratory system @xcite .",
    "in addition , it is believed that cilia found in specialized brain cells ( ependymal cilia ) are involved in the transport of cerebrospinal fluid at small scales @xcite .",
    "when cilia are anchored on a free - swimming cell , such as in many protozoa including the oft - studied _ paramecium _ , their collective deformation and active transport of the surrounding fluid leads to locomotion of the cell , typically at very low reynolds number @xcite .",
    "the study of fluid transport by cilia , and more generally by eukaryotic flagella , requires an understanding of their beating patterns as well as the physical properties of the surrounding fluid .",
    "many biological fluids in the examples above display strong non - newtonian characteristics , including nonzero relaxation times and shear - dependent viscosities @xcite .",
    "past work has addressed theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite the effect of fluid viscoelasticity on transport and locomotion , but the impact of shear - dependance material functions on the performance of cilia and flagella has yet to be fully quantified @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we mathematically address the role of shear - dependent viscosity on the propulsion performance of a two - dimensional undulating surface whose boundary conditions model the beating strokes of a cilia array or of a waving flagellum .",
    "the calculation is an extension of the classical results by taylor @xcite to the non - newtonian case . in the next section",
    "we describe the physics of the cilia beating patterns , distinguish individual vs.  collective motion , and introduce the mathematical models that have been proposed to quantify cilia dynamics both in newtonian and non - newtonian fluids .",
    "a variety of beating patterns is displayed by cells employing cilia or flagella , depending on the surrounding geometry , the purpose of the beating ( locomotion , ingestion , mixing ... ) as well as genetic factors and biochemical regulation @xcite .",
    "a detailed description of the stroke of cilia has been offered in the past @xcite and we summarize the main features here .",
    "in general , the beating pattern of an individual cilium displays a two - stroke effective - recovery motion , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ cilia ] ( top ) . during the effective stroke",
    ", the cilium extends into the fluid dragging the maximum volume of fluid forward .",
    "in contrast , the recovery ( or backward ) stroke is executed by bending the cilium towards itself and the nearest boundary , minimizing thereby the drag on the surrounding fluid in the opposite direction . it is this asymmetry in the beating pattern that induces a net fluid flow in the direction of the effective stroke . in some cells",
    ", the cilium not only bends towards the wall during the recovery stroke but also tilts with respect to the vertical plane described by the effective stroke , hence displaying a three - dimensional pattern @xcite .",
    "cilia in the respiratory track seem , however , to remain two - dimensional @xcite .",
    "if we now turn our attention to the collective motion of cilia array , the cilia are observed to beat in an organized manner such that an undulating surface will appear to form on top of the layer of cilia , and to deform in a wave - like fashion .",
    "these waves , known as metachronal waves , are due to a small phase lag between neighboring cilia , and are akin to waves created in sports stadiums by waving spectators .",
    "many biological studies have been devoted to this collective effect @xcite . in table",
    "[ tableone ] we reproduce some typical values of the beating parameters measured experimentally for cilia movement in the respiratory track ( tracheobronchial cilia ) .",
    "the cilia length and the distance between cilia at their base are denoted by @xmath0 and @xmath1 , while @xmath2 is the beat frequency and @xmath3 is the metachronal wavelength .",
    "different types of metachronal waves can be classified according to the relationship between their dynamics and that of the effective stroke of the constituting cilia @xcite .",
    "when the propagative direction of the metachronal wave is the same as the direction of the effective stroke , the beat coordination is called symplectic .",
    "if instead both directions oppose each other then the coordination is termed antiplectic @xcite .",
    "other types of metachronal waves that requires certain three - dimensional coordination have also been identified @xcite .",
    "although there is no yet agreed - upon explanation for the origin of these different types of coordination , it seems that patterns close to the antiplectic metachrony ( including tracheobronchial cilia ) are more widely used than the symplectic wave @xcite possibly because the first one is characterized by the separation of consecutive cilia during the effective stoke , allowing them to propel more fluid volume and thus increasing the stoke efficiency @xcite .",
    "two different approaches have been proposed to model the periodic motion of cilia , namely the sub - layer and the envelope models @xcite . in sub - layer modeling ,",
    "one keeps the basic ingredients of the cilia beating cycle by parametrizing each cilium shape along its stroke period .",
    "this approach allows to compute the forces and bending moments induced by each cilium to the surrounding fluid and at the same time obtain the mean flow produced above the cilia layer , although the hydrodynamic description can be tedious and usually has to be done numerically @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the envelope modeling approach takes advantage of the formation of metachronal waves above the cilia layer .",
    "the motion of the cilia array is simplified as an undulating surface that covers the cilia layer ( fig .",
    "[ cilia ] , bottom ) , ignoring the details of the sub - layer dynamics . in this case , the metachronal waves are prescribed by setting appropriate boundary conditions on the material points of the envelope . in the case where the boundary conditions are nearly inextensible , the dynamics of the flow produced by the cilia array becomes similar to the undulating motion of a two - dimensional flagellum @xcite .",
    "the simplification allowed by the envelope model has been useful in comparing , even quantitatively , the swimming velocities obtained theoretically with those observed in water for a number of microorganisms @xcite .",
    "furthermore , this model , which is originally due to taylor @xcite , is amenable to perturbation analysis and allows to incorporate certain non - newtonian effects in a systematic fashion @xcite .    to address the limit of validity of the envelope model ,",
    "brennen @xcite derived the set of conditions to be satisfied in order for the envelope model to be approximately valid , which are @xmath4 and @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid . with the numbers from table [ tableone ] , we see that the envelope model is valid for the case of the cilia array in the respiratory track when the liquid has a viscosity similar to that of water ( and @xmath6 will be actually higher if the fluid is a polymeric solution , hence the model is expected to always be valid ) .",
    "because of the importance of mucus in human health , numerous theoretical papers have attempted to elucidate the mechanisms of tracheobronchial mucus transport using both modeling approaches outlined above @xcite .",
    "mucus is a typical example of a non - newtonian fluid , displaying both elastic behavior and stress relaxation as well as a shear - dependent viscosity @xcite .",
    "in order to incorporate a variation of the viscosity in the transport problem , a two - fluid model has been proposed consisting of a low - viscosity fluid located at the cilia layer ( peri - ciliary fluid ) with a second high viscosity fluid laying above the first one @xcite .",
    "this hypothesis of a two - fluid layer , supported by experimental observations of tissue samples , allows to obtain values of the mucus flow similar to those measured in experiments @xcite .",
    "an alternative modeling approach proposed to use a fluid with a viscosity whose value changes linearly with the distance from the cell wall @xcite . such approximation , however , is not a formal mechanical model that rigorously takes into account the rheological properties of the fluid .",
    "later work considered formally the elastic properties of mucus by introducing the convective maxwell equation in the theoretical formulation @xcite .",
    "the values of the mean velocity of the fluid in this case were found to be much smaller than the experimental ones , indicating that the shear - thinning properties of mucus also need to be considered .",
    "elastic effects were the focus on a number of studies on flagellar locomotion , both theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite , and the consensus so far seems to be that for small - amplitude motion elastic effects do always hinder locomotion whereas it can potentially be enhanced for large amplitude motion corresponding to order - one weissenberg , or deborah , numbers .    for mucus transport by cilia ,",
    "it is in fact believed that it is a combination of shear - thinning , which can reduce the fluid flow resistance at the cilia layer , and elastic effects , which maintain a semi - rigid surface at the upper mucus layer , which allow for the optimal transport of particles in the respiratory track @xcite .",
    "a constitutive equation that takes into account a shear - dependent viscosity was formally used within the lubrication approximation in the context of gastropod @xcite and flagellar locomotion @xcite .",
    "these models consider the locomotion due to a tangential or normal ( or both ) deformation of a sheet above a thin fluid layer with shear - dependent viscosity . in the case of tangential deformation of the sheet ,",
    "the average locomotion speed is seen to go down for a shear - thinning fluid whereas in the case where normal deformation are also included the speed increases .",
    "this indicates that the impact of shear - dependent material function on transport depends on the particular beating pattern , something our model also shows .",
    "recent studies on the effect of shear - dependent viscosity on waving propulsion showed that locomotion is unaffected by shear - thinning for nematodes ( experiments , @xcite ) , increases in a two - dimensional model flagellum with an increase in flagellar amplitude for shear - thinning fluids ( computations , @xcite ) , while decreases in the case of a two - dimensional swimming - sheet - like swimmer model in shear - thinning elastic fluids ( experiments , @xcite ) .",
    "other models focused on the presence of yield stresses and the heterogeneity in the surrounding environment @xcite .",
    "the presence of a yield stress in the limit of small amplitude oscillations hinders the mean propulsion or transport velocity whereas the inclusion of obstacles mimicking an heterogeneous polymeric solution enhances propulsion .",
    "in this paper we solve for the envelope model in a generalized newtonian fluid using a domain perturbation expansion .",
    "the fluid is the carreau model for generalized newtonian fluids where the viscosity is an instantaneous nonlinear function of the local shear rate .",
    "we solve for the flow velocity and rate of work in powers of the amplitude of the sheet deformation .",
    "in particular , we compute analytically the influence of non - newtonian stresses on the fluid velocity induced in the far field : that velocity can be interpreted either as a transport velocity in the context of fluid pumping or as a propulsive speed in the context of locomotion . in section [ formulation ]",
    "we present the formulation of the envelope model and the dynamic equations that govern the fluid flow .",
    "section [ asymptotic ] details the asymptotic calculations followed by section [ analysis ] which is devoted to an analysis of our mathematical results and the illustration of the importance of non - newtonian effects .",
    "finally in section [ discussion ] we discuss the impact of our results in the context of biological locomotion and transport and conclude the paper . in [ appendix ] the applicability of our results to a wider class of generalized newtonian fluid models is examined .",
    "in the envelope model approach , the cilia tips , attached to a stationary base , display a combination of normal and tangential periodic motions . depending on the phase shift @xmath7 between these two motions and their relative amplitude ( @xmath8 ) , in general the cilia tips will describe an elliptic shape in the @xmath9-plane over one period of oscillation ( fig .",
    "[ cilia ] ) .",
    "we assume that the cilia tips are connected by a continuous waving sheet , and the variation of the distance between adjacent cilia is therefore idealized as a stretching or compression of the surface .",
    "the positions of material points ( @xmath10 ) on the sheet are given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the maximum displacements of the material points in the @xmath14 and @xmath15 directions respectively .",
    "the wave amplitude is thus @xmath16 ( dimensions of length ) while the relative values of the dimensionless parameters @xmath17 and @xmath18 reflect the ratio of the tangential and normal motions .",

    "[ materialpoints1 ] occurs in the positive @xmath14 direction ( fig .",
    "[ cilia ] ) and the material points of the sheet can describe a cyclic motion either in a clockwise direction ( symplectic ) , or a counterclockwise direction ( antiplectic ) .",

    "[ materialpoints1 ] as @xmath21 where we have defined @xmath22 .",
    "assuming that the cilia array propagates metachronal waves with a single characteristic amplitude much smaller than its wavelength , we can use a standard domain perturbation method to solve for the pumping velocity in the limit @xmath23 . in the remaining text we will use for convenience @xmath24 and @xmath25 . using the formula @xmath26",
    ", we will also define @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 .      neglecting any inertial effects in the fluid",

    "the fluid problem is two - dimensional , and we can therefore reduce the number of scalars used in the formulation by introducing a streamfunction , @xmath37 . the incompressibility condition is satisfied everywhere in the fluid provided we use @xmath38 using eq .",

    "clearly , other classical models used to describe inelastic fluids may be used to fit the rheological data of mucus .",
    "we chose the carreau model due to its wide range of applicability ; in [ appendix ] we discuss the class of generalized newtonian fluids for which our analysis remains valid .",
    "we demonstrate in particular that the model we chose allows us to formally derive the leading - order effects of shear - dependence on the flow .",
    "any other model , provided that it is well - defined in the zero - shear - rate limit , would either give results mathematically equivalent to ours , or would predict an impact on the flow generated by the sheet arising at a higher - order in the sheet amplitude .",

    "first we see that if the sheet does not display normal deformation ( @xmath136 ) or no tangential deformation ( @xmath137 ) then @xmath138 ; in order for the shear - dependent viscosity to affect transport , it is this important that both modes of deformation be present , @xmath139 .",
    "the second interesting point is that the effect scales linearly with @xmath140 , and thus with the difference between the power - law index , @xmath55 , and 1 .",
    "consequently , when they have an influence on transport , shear - thinning and shear - thickening fluids always act in opposite direction and if one type of fluid hinders transport the other fluid will facilitate it .",
    "we now turn to the calculation of the rate of work , @xmath141 , done by the sheet to transport the fluid ( per unit area of the sheet ) .",

    "we then demonstrate that the maximum energetic gain is always obtained for antiplectic metachronal waves .",
    "when the sheet is viewed as a model for flagellar locomotion in complex fluids , for example spermatozoa , we then show that , at the order in which we carried out the calculations , there is no influence of the shear - dependent viscosity on the kinematics of swimming .",
    "we finally address the more general case of viewing the sheet as an envelope for the deformation of cilia array , and address the impact of non - newtonian stresses on the magnitude of the flow induced in the far field for a variety of sheet kinematics .",
    "we start by considering the non - newtonian contribution to the rate of working by the sheet , eq .",
    "we can write @xmath166 where the function @xmath167 is @xmath168 we are going to show that this function is always positive , meaning that for shear - thinning fluids ( @xmath169 ) , the sheet expends less energy than in a newtonian fluid with the same zero - shear rate viscosity .    in order to show that @xmath170 we calculate its minimum value and show that it is positive .",
    "the derivative of @xmath167 with respect to the phase is given by @xmath171 while its second derivative is @xmath172 the local extrema of @xmath167 are reached when @xmath173 which occurs at three points : @xmath174 and , when @xmath175 , @xmath176 .",
    "when @xmath177 , only the points @xmath174 are extrema , and plugging them into eq .",
    "[ d2 ] we see that the minimum of @xmath167 is obtained at @xmath178 ( positive second derivative ) . from eq .",

    "[ ff ] , and using that @xmath184 we obtain that @xmath185/8 $ ] which is also always positive .",
    "we therefore always have @xmath186 and the non - newtonian contribution to the rate of working by the sheet , @xmath187 , always has the same sign as @xmath117 . for shear - thinning fluids @xmath188 and therefore the cost of fluid transport is always reduced  a result which remains true even if the non - newtonian contribution to the flow at infinity , @xmath189 , is equal to zero . as a consequence , the last term in eq .  [ eff_final ] , @xmath190",
    ", will always be negative for shear - thinning fluids , indicating a contribution to an increase in the efficiency .",
    "the opposite is true for shear - thickening fluids which always add to the energetic cost .",
    "this result is reminiscent of earlier work on the cost of transport by gastropod showing that shear - thinning fluids are advantageous , although for a completely different reason ( mechanical work versus mucus production ) @xcite .    as a final note ,",
    "it is worth pointing out that , had the flow kinematics been unchanged at all orders compared to the newtonian ones , then this result of reduction in @xmath141 would have in fact been obvious . indeed ,",
    "if the shear is the same everywhere in the fluid , and if the viscosity decreases , then the total dissipation should also decrease .",
    "however , as detailed in  [ work_calculation ] , the dissipation rate at order four in @xmath69 depends on the third - order kinematics in the fluid which are different from what they would have been in the absence of shear - dependence .",
    "the fact that our calculations show that shear - thinning fluids always decrease the cost of transport is therefore not obvious .",
    "another general result can be gained from a close inspection of the function @xmath167 in eq .",
    "[ ff ] . for given values of both amplitudes @xmath129 and @xmath130 , it is clear that @xmath167 it is maximized when @xmath191 and @xmath192 , which occurs when @xmath193 .",
    "this is thus the value of the phase between normal and tangential motion leading to the maximum non - newtonian decrease in the energy expanded by the sheet to transport the fluid . for this particular value of the phase difference , the kinematics of the material point at @xmath194 ,",
    "is @xmath195 , @xmath196 which means that material points follow elliptical trajectories of semi axes @xmath197 and @xmath198 in the anticlockwise direction .",
    "viewing the sheet as a model for the motion of cilia tips this is therefore a wave for which the effective stroke is in the @xmath199 direction while the recovery stroke occurs in the @xmath200 direction . given that the metachronal waves are assumes to propagate in the positive direction , this means that antiplectic metachronal waves offer the largest non - newtonian energy saving in a shear - thinning fluid .",
    "we have seen in  [ asymptotic ] that the presence of non - newtonian stresses affects the fluid transported by the waving sheet only if both oscillatory motions , normal ( @xmath201 ) and tangential ( @xmath202 ) , are present . in the frame moving with the fluid at infinity , this induced speed can be also interpreted as the swimming speed of a free - moving sheet , which prompted taylor s original idea to propose it as the simplest model of flagellar locomotion @xcite .",
    "the difference however between the waving kinematics of a flagellum and the one we have studied in this paper is that a flagellum is inextensible .",
    "consequently , the flagellum has @xmath203 motion only in the normal direction , while the tangential deformation is @xmath204 as a result from the requirement of inextensibility ( material points on a flagellum describe a typical figure-8 motion ) .",
    "higher - order kinematics can also be described similarly @xcite .    to address the impact of a shear - dependent viscosity on locomotion we have followed the same procedure as above and computed the swimming velocity systematically up to @xmath151 using the carreau model and enforcing inextensibility condition .",
    "we obtain formally that @xmath205 : the shear - dependence of the viscosity does not affect the locomotion speed of the sheet at this order .",
    "inextensible swimmers , such as those employing flagella , and deforming in a constant , small - amplitude waving motion of the type modeled here are thus expected to be hardly affected by the shear - dependence of the fluid . since the rate of working decreases for shear - thinning fluids ,",
    "swimmers are thus more efficient than in newtonian fluids ( see eq .  [ eff_final ] ) .",
    "our theoretical result is consistent with experiments by shen and arratia @xcite which have shown that the swimming velocity of a nematode ( _ c .  elegans _ ) waving freely in a shear - thinning fluid ( xanthan gum solution ) is the same as that observed in a newtonian fluid with similar viscosity .",
    "returning to the sheet as a model for fluid transport by the tips of cilia arrays , we investigate here the effect of the shear - dependent viscosity on the pumping performance as a function of the values of @xmath129 , @xmath130 , and @xmath7 .",
    "recall that the magnitude of the non - newtonian contribution , @xmath189 , scales with the absolute value of @xmath206 while its sign is that of @xmath140 , which is positive if the fluid is shear - thickening , and negative is the fluid is shear - thinning . among the many combinations of @xmath129 , @xmath130 , and @xmath7 that we may choose , we limit the study to three relevant cases : @xmath116 , @xmath207 , and @xmath208 , and in each case consider four illustrative values of @xmath7 , namely , @xmath178 , @xmath209 , and @xmath193 . in fig .

    "a shear - thinning fluid renders the flow transport more efficient , and in eight out of the twelve cases it also increases the transport speed  in particular for the biologically relevant case where the magnitudes of the normal and tangential deformation are of the same order . a further numerical investigation in  [ numerics ] also identifies the regions in which the non - newtonian term is stronger than the newtonian one .    in this paper",
    "we have assumed that the fluid has no memory but instead its viscosity is an instantaneous function of the shear rate  a class of models known as generalized newtonian fluids .",

    "if the derivative in eq .   is zero then the effect will be at higher order .",
    "if instead the derivative is not defined , then the model is not appropriate to describe flow behavior at small shear rates . in the case of the carreau model",
    "considered above , the derivative @xmath277 takes a finite value , so we indeed obtain a nonzero effect at second order .",
    "there are other models that could potentially be used as well to fit rheological data .",
    "one of such model is that of a cross fluid , given in a dimensionless form by @xmath278^{-\\mathcal{n}}.\\ ] ] in that case , it is first straightforward to show that only @xmath279 ( shear - thinning fluid ) leads to a finite value of the viscosity at zero shear rate .",
    "computing the derivative in eq .   to perform the taylor expansion",
    "it is then easy to show that only the specific case @xmath280 leads to a finite value for @xmath277 . when @xmath280 the results obtained for a cross fluid would thus be similar to the results described in the paper ; when @xmath281 the cross fluid is not well defined near the zero - shear - rate limit while when @xmath282 the derivative of the viscosity is zero , and therefore non - newtonian effects on the fluid flow would appear at a higher order .",
