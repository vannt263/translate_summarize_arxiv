    "the two - dimensional fluid of point - like spinless bosons interacting with a @xmath4 potential has drawn attention in the literature@xcite as a model in quantum statistical mechanics which parallels the physically more relevant fluid of electrons . at zero temperature ,",
    "the model is specified by the coupling parameter @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the density and @xmath7 the bohr radius . for small @xmath8",
    "the system is a weakly coupled fluid , well described by the random phase approximation,@xcite whereas it becomes strongly correlated and eventually undergoes wigner crystallization upon increasing @xmath8 .",
    "several results for the ground state energy , static structure , screening properties and elementary excitations have been reported using the correlated basis function theory,@xcite various implementation of the singwi - tosi - land - sjlander ( stls ) formalism,@xcite and the overhauser model.@xcite the momentum distribution has been calculated for low @xmath8 in the bogolubov approximation .",
    "@xcite a comparison between the stls results for the @xmath4 potential and the ln@xmath9 potential has been reported by moudgil _",
    "et al_. @xcite    although the charged boson model may find applications to superconductors , either as a system of bound electron pairs@xcite or in terms of an effective action with fermionic degrees of freedom integrated out,@xcite no direct realization of the system is experimentally available .",
    "therefore numerical results provided by quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulations constitute the only reliable benchmark for analytic approaches .",
    "extensive simulation results are available for 3d charged bosons@xcite and for the 2d system with the ln@xmath9 interaction.@xcite    in this work we present qmc results for several ground state properties of the 2d fluid of charged bosons with the @xmath4 potential .",
    "we use two different algorithms , namely diffusion monte carlo ( dmc),@xcite which is more efficient in the calculation of mixed averages , and reptation quantum monte carlo ( rqmc),@xcite which gives easier access to correlations in imaginary time .",
    "the exact ground state energy and the mixed estimate@xcite of the one - body density matrix are calculated with the former .",
    "unbiased estimates of the static structure factor and the susceptibility are instead obtained , using rqmc , from the auto - correlation in imaginary time of the density fluctuation operator .",
    "the inverse laplace transform of the same auto - correlation function yields valuable information on the spectrum of elementary excitations .",
    "quantum monte carlo is the method of choice for strongly interacting bosonic systems in their ground state , because it yields exact numerical results for a number of quantities , subject only to known statistical errors .",
    "the dmc method@xcite samples a probability distribution proportional to the `` mixed distribution '' @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is a point in the @xmath12-dimensional configuration space of the system , @xmath13 is a trial wave - function , and @xmath14 is the ground - state wave - function . the exact ground state energy is obtained as the average over the mixed distribution of the local energy , @xmath15 . for a general operator not commuting with the hamiltonian , ground - state averages can be approximated by the extrapolated estimate ( twice the average over the mixed distribution minus the variational estimate),@xcite which leads to an error quadratic in the difference @xmath16 .",
    "our results for the one - body density matrix are given in terms of this extrapolated estimate , as in ref .  .",
    "for operators diagonal in @xmath17 we avoid mixed estimates resorting to the rqmc method@xcite ( one could alternatively use the forward walking technique@xcite within the dmc method ) . in rqmc , the evolution in imaginary time of the system is represented by a time - discretized path @xmath18\\{@xmath19}. the algorithm samples the distribution @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is a short - time approximation to the importance - sampled green s function @xmath22 .",
    "assuming @xmath23 is large enough , the inner time slices of the path are individually sampled from the distribution @xmath24 , and sequentially sampled according to the quantum dynamical fluctuations in the ground state .",
    "pure estimators , @xmath25 , and imaginary - time correlation functions , @xmath26 , are thus readily accessible ( here @xmath27 means average over the random walk in the space of quantum paths @xmath28 , and @xmath29).@xcite    in all simulations we consider a system of @xmath30 particles in a square cell with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the trial function is chosen of the pair product form , @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the rpa pseudopotential following ref .  .",
    "both the pseudopotential and the coulomb interaction are evaluated using generalized ewald sums.@xcite as usual,@xcite we estimate the finite - size effect on the ground - state energy from variational monte carlo simulations .",
    "variational energies @xmath33 , calculated with @xmath30 in the range @xmath34@xmath35 , are used to determine the best ",
    "fit parameter in the form @xmath36 .",
    "assuming that the same size dependence holds for the exact dmc energies , the optimal parameters @xmath37 and @xmath38 are then used to extrapolate to the thermodynamic limit the result of a single dmc simulation with @xmath39 .",
    "other quantities have comparatively smaller finite - size errors , typically below the statistical accuracy of the present simulations .",
    "the dmc ground state energies of the 2d bosonic fluid in the thermodynamic limit are compared in table [ tab_ene ] with the results obtained with the singwi  tosi  land ",
    "sjlander ( stls ) method by gold,@xcite with a parametrized wave function approach by sim , tao and wu@xcite and within the hypernetted chain approximation ( hnc ) by apaja _",
    "et al._.@xcite while all computations agree qualitatively , we note that the agreement between hcn and the exact dmc results is particularly good .",
    "our dmc results can be accurately reproduced by the parametrized function : @xmath40^{-c}\\label{eqbos2drs0}\\]]where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are fixed by the small @xmath8 behavior @xcite ( @xmath43 ) , @xmath44 is fixed requiring a constant sub - leading term for @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 by requiring leading terms in @xmath48 and @xmath49 for @xmath50 .",

    "the reduced @xmath60 for the fit with 4 parameters and 7 data points is @xmath61 at @xmath62 .",

    "on purpose of clarity we plotted @xmath65 , with @xmath66 , while the inset shows the corresponding @xmath67 curves .",

    "( [ all_ene ] ) our results are compared with the previous dmc results by rapisarda and senatore @xcite for 2d fermions and for the 2d wigner crystal . in two dimensions bosons crystallize at @xmath0 and fermions at @xmath68 .",
    "the difference in critical density is analogous to the difference obtained in the 3d case , where bosons crystallize at @xmath69 and fermions at @xmath70.@xcite       the condensate fraction decreases very rapidly with increasing @xmath8 , the depletion being already 50% at @xmath62 , in agreement with the result of the bogolubov theory@xcite ( in 3d@xcite a similar depletion occurs at @xmath71 ) . for large couplings ,",
    "the bogolubov theory overestimates the condensate fraction . in a wide density range in the liquid phase ,",

    "the minimum of @xmath83 deepens and shifts to larger @xmath86 upon increasing @xmath8 .",
    "we note that a negative dielectric function can not be interpreted as a signal of instability of the bosonic fluid due to the presence of the rigid background .",
    "as in the case of the structural properties , in the large coupling regime the monte carlo data for the effective potential show more pronounced features than the results of apaya _",
