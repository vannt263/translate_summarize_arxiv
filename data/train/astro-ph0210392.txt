    "the engineering array of the southern pierre auger observatory ( pao ) @xcite in argentina has recently started to take data .",
    "the interpretation of the measurements requires reliable numerical simulations of extensive air showers ( eas ) in the extremely - high energy ( ehe ) range @xmath0  ev . a large uncertainty in such simulations arises from the models which describe the hadronic interactions . as one has to extrapolate in energy from accelerators by several orders of magnitude and into the forward kinematical range which is unobserved by collider experiments , the models have to rely on theoretical guidelines to describe the ehe collisions . in this contribution model predictions for single interactions of p-@xmath1 , p-@xmath2n , and @xmath3-@xmath2n collisions",
    "are compared , and we examine how their features influence measurable eas quantities such as the longitudinal development with the shower maximum @xmath4 and the lateral distributions of particle densities at ground .",
    "presently three hadronic interaction codes coupled with the eas simulation program corsika @xcite are able to treat hadronic collisions at energies @xmath5 10@xmath6 ev :        dpmjet 2.55 @xcite , qgsjet 01 @xcite , and sibyll 2.1 @xcite . in this study",
    "nexus 2 @xcite is partly included despite of its upper limit of @xmath7ev recommended by its authors .",
    "but already at this energy some interesting trends of this model show up . fig .",
    "[ fig - sigma_p_air ] shows the proton - air cross - sections for production of secondary particles as function of energy .",
    "all models are tuned to reproduce the available collider data .",
    "they agree fairly well in the pseudo - rapidity , multiplicity , and transverse momentum distributions obtained by the ua5 @xcite , cdf @xcite , and p238 @xcite experiments .",
    "-@xmath8 collisions at @xmath9 = 10@xmath10 ev . ]    -@xmath2n collisions at @xmath11=  10@xmath10 ev . ]    but when extrapolating to higher energies , already at @xmath9 = 10@xmath12ev ( corresponding to @xmath13 tev , which will be reached by the future lhc - collider ) , the mid - rapidity density at @xmath14 of qgsjet exceeds that of nexus by up to a factor of @xmath152 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - pprap1e17 ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig - pinmult1e17 ] the charged particle multiplicity distribution of @xmath3-@xmath2n collisions shows a similar behaviour .",
    "again qgsjet predictions are higher than those of all other models , while the nexus distribution repeats the low multiplicity already shown in the @xmath16-@xmath8 collisions of fig .",
    "[ fig - pprap1e17 ] .",
    "this behaviour reflects the different treatment of the pomeron exchange by the various models .",
    "in qgsjet a hard pomeron is always coupled to the partons of projectile and target via soft pomerons , which finally produce the large number of secondary particles .",
    "-@xmath2n collisions at @xmath11=  10@xmath6 ev . ]    secondaries produced by cutting soft pomerons appear in the mid - rapidity range and take away only a minute energy fraction .",
    "therefore they influence the development of charged particle numbers in eas rather insignificantly .    already in the calculation of",
    "the pomeron exchange probabilities nexus applies strict energy conservation , which reduces the number of cut hard and soft pomerons , thus reducing the overall multiplicity .",
    "this decreases the number of particles emitted in the pseudo - rapidity range below @xmath17 while the fraction of secondaries produced in the very forward direction @xmath18 resembles that of the other considered models .",
    "the distribution of the longitudinal momentum fraction taken away by the leading particle is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig - pnxf1e19 ] .",
    "large differences up to a factor of 10 show up in the diffractive region @xmath19 , but also around @xmath20 significant deviations are visible .",
    "the extremely low probability of dpmjet to produce baryons at @xmath21 0.97 in p-@xmath2n collisions is remarkable .",
    "it reflects the insufficient knowledge on high- and low - mass diffraction : any detailed treatment within the interaction codes is strongly model dependent .",
    "in hadronic eas the @xmath22-mesons are the most frequent secondary hadronic    -@xmath2n collisions as function of energy . ]",
    "particles and nitrogen is the most abundant component of air .",
    "therefore the character of an eas is essentially influenced by the features of @xmath3-@xmath2n collisions .",
    "in such interactions qgsjet exhibits a lower average elasticity than dpmjet and sibyll , see fig .",
    "[ fig - pinxaver ] .",
    "therefore eas simulated with qgsjet develop faster than those produced with the other models .    the second important influence on the development process arises from the cross - sections .",
    "the @xmath3-air production cross - sections behave similar to those shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - sigma_p_air ] , but with dpmjet staying well below qgsjet above 10@xmath23 ev .",
    "therefore eas simulated with the dpmjet model are expected to develop late , while sibyll showers will fall somewhere    = 10@xmath24ev , @xmath25mev .",
    "the vertical dotted line indicates the vertical depth of the pao in argentina @xcite . ]     of shower maximum as function of primary energy .",
    "vertical incidence , @xmath26=10@xmath24ev , @xmath25mev .",
    "references to experiments ( fluorescence = full symbols , cherenkov techniques = open symbols ) are given in @xcite . ]    in between qgsjet and dpmjet .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig - longi_charg_1e19 ] for proton and iron induced showers of 10@xmath6 ev . at the upper margin of fig .",
    "[ fig - longi_charg_1e19 ] the positions of the maxima are indicated .",
    "they nearly coincide for iron induced showers , but for proton induced eas the difference between qgsjet and dpmjet amounts to @xmath15 40 g/@xmath27 .",
    "the depth of shower maximum @xmath4 as function of primary energy is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig - xmax ] .",
    "while for iron induced showers even at highest energies the @xmath4 values coincide within @xmath28g/@xmath27 , with a tendency of dpmjet to predict deeper penetration , the lines of proton induced showers show a clear divergence with increasing energy reaching 55  g/@xmath27 at 10@xmath29ev .",
    "especially the qgsjet distribution flattens with increasing energy . starting at 10@xmath23 ev with 65  g/@xmath27 per energy decade",
    "the slope reaches 45  g/@xmath27 per decade at 10@xmath30  ev .",
    "the flattening has to be attributed to the lowering of the @xmath3-@xmath2n    = 10@xmath6  ev , @xmath31 = 10@xmath32 ( optimized @xcite ) , @xmath33 mev , @xmath34  gev . ]",
    "elasticity ( fig .",
    "[ fig - pinxaver ] ) together with an increasing @xmath3-@xmath2n cross - section of qgsjet which exceeds that of dpmjet by 10% at @xmath35ev . above 10@xmath23 ev",
    "the @xmath4 slopes of the other models show no significant change for proton induced eas .    because of its early development qgsjet exhibits the flattest lateral distribution for electrons and for muons .",
    "this results in the highest particle densities at distances @xmath36 m not only for proton but also for iron induced eas . therefore we compare in fig .",
    "[ fig - lat_1e19_e_mu_ratio ] the lateral distributions of the other models relative to those of qgsjet . with increasing distance from the shower core the densities predicted by the other models are always smaller .",
    "the effect is more pronounced for proton induced showers . in general",
    "the sibyll densities are lowest and the differences are larger for the muon distributions .",
    "we emphasize the importance of future collider experiments to measure the very forward range of particle production thus reducing the present uncertainties in eas simulations caused by the hadronic interaction models . despite the unknown elemental composition of the primary cosmic radiation at ehe",
    ", the pao should be able to constrain the hadronic interaction models by evaluating hybrid eas events which combine the longitudinal information measured by fluorescence telescopes and the lateral particle densities registered by water cherenkov surface detectors .",
