    "bright - rimmed clouds ( brcs ) found in and around hii regions are sites of ongoing star formation due to compression by ionisation / shock fronts , and provide an excellent laboratory to study the influence of uv radiation from nearby massive stars on the evolutionary process of molecular clouds .",
    "numerous molecular line , millimetre / sub - millimetre continuum and mid - ir surveys have revealed very detailed structures and physical properties of brcs in various astrophysical environments @xcite .",
    "one of the most intriguing characteristics of the observed brcs is the diversity of their morphologies . the observed",
    "brcs appear in different morphologies even when they are in similar stellar environments .",
    "sugitani et al ( 1991 , 1994 ) classified 89 brcs from a whole sky survey into three types depending on the curvature of the rim of brcs .",
    "the three types are categorised with type a cloud with a rim displaying moderate curvature , type b cloud with a rim of a high degree of curvature which sometimes is also described as an elephant trunk morphology , and finally type c cloud with a tightly curved rim and a tail , which is also called cometary globule .",
    "@xcite presented a 2-dimensional numerical simulation of the effect of uv radiation on the dynamical evolution of a molecular cloud based on the radiation driven implosion ( rdi ) model .",
    "although their hydrodynamical modelling successfully created a complete sequence of the morphological evolution of a molecular cloud from type a to b and then to c , it seems difficult to provide physical explanations for the following questions derived from brc observations :    \\1 ) why are there so many more type a brcs ?",
    "the first whole sky survey by sugitani et al ( 1991,1994 ) revealed that 61% of the observed 89 brcs have type a morphology .",
    "if all of the clouds followed the same evolutionary sequence revealed by lofloch s modelling , from type a to type c morphology , there should be a balanced number of brcs with different morphologies to be observed .",
    "\\2 ) why do some of observed brcs evolve to a quasi - stable type a rimmed morphology and show signs of star formation at the heads of their structures ?",
    "if all of the clouds should evolve to type c morphology and finally were completely photoevaporated as described by lelfloch s modelling , no star formation should be triggered in type a brcs .",
    "the recent radio continuum and molecular line observations on brcs in the catalogue of sfo @xcite presented by @xcite and many other observations in molecular lines and submilimeter lines @xcite provided strong evidences of ongoing star formations in the condensed head of type a rimmed clouds where a pressure equilibrium at the boundary between the clouds and its environment has been reached .",
    "therefore it seems that for some of the molecular clouds , further evolution to type b or c rimmed morphologies is not necessary , i.e. , not every brc s morphological evolution follows the sequence from type a to b then to c rimmed morphology , it may terminate their morphological evolution at any one of the three morphologies .",
    "\\3 ) what causes the spatial morphological distribution of brcs in some of molecular cloud clusters ? the remnant molecular clouds in the ori ob 1 associations @xcite presented a spatial sequence from type a@xmath0b@xmath0c rimmed brcs with their distance from the ionising star .",
    "it was once suggested that some molecular clouds which were farther away may directly evolve to type c rimmed morphology @xcite , but there is no physical foundation for this speculation .    for the molecular clumps very close to an ionising star",
    ", the ionised gas can not expand freely from the surface of the clump , because their expansion is constrained by a material flow accompanying with the ionisation radiation flux .",
    "lefloch s simulation showed that a zero radial velocity boundary condition , ( the extreme case of flow effect ) favours the type a brc formation @xcite .",
    "this result may partly explain the predominance of type a brcs at the border of the hii regions .",
    "however question remains for the type a brc structures found at the outer location of the hii regions or type b / c brcs found at the border of hii regions @xcite and there are must be some other physical mechanisms which play dominant roles in the morphological evolution of molecular clouds .    therefore searching for satisfactory solutions to the above puzzles requires a more comprehensive model which should include as many physical processes as possible so that reliable physical explanations on what observations revealed can be derived , hence to greatly improve our understanding on how the intensive uv radiation from nearby stars affects the dynamical evolution of the surrounding molecular clouds .",
    "the fact that iras sources and bipolar outflows in cloud globules are very often found at the edges of brcs strongly suggests that the self - gravity of a molecular cloud can play an active role even in the early stages of evolution in molecular clouds @xcite .",
    "nevertheless the self - gravity of a molecular cloud was neglected in lefloch s model , because the initiative of the model was to investigate photo - evaporation effect of molecular clouds , for which self - gravity does not play a dominant role . however , as pointed out by @xcite at the end of the discussions of their modelling results , inclusion of the self - gravitation of a molecular cloud is necessary in order to build a appropriate model for investigation on the dynamical evolution of globule clouds under the effect of uv radiation .",
    "recently , @xcite have developed the first 3-d sph rdi model for investigation of the effect of uv radiation on the dynamical evolution of molecular clouds .",
    "their model includes both self - gravity and the hydrogen ionisation of the molecular cloud in the dynamical evolution equations and revealed further features of molecular cloud evolution under the effect of ionising radiation .",
    "however a self - consistent treatment for the energy evolution was not included which sets a barrier for a rigorous study on the evolution of the physical properties of a cloud , so that a direct confrontation with observations is difficult",
    ".    therefore it is our intention to build a comprehensive rdi model in order to obtain a consistent description about the effect of the uv radiation on the dynamical evolution of a molecular cloud and to reveal the physical origin for the observed characteristics of brcs morphology formation .    in the following sections we first give an outline for our 3-d rdi model ,",
    "then briefly present an analytical solution which uses some observable physical properties of a condensed globule and the uv radiation flux to define a maximum mass a stable condensed globule could have to against the gravitational collapse .",
    "next the dynamical evolution of the cloud will be detailed and the corresponding kinematics will be analysed based on numerical simulation results .",
    "finally we will apply the derived knowledge to confront with brcs observations and the conclusions are drawn at the end of the paper .",
    "in this section , we present a brief description of the basic equations and various physical processes included in our model .",
    "the hydrodynamical equations are solved with smoothed particle hydrodynamical(sph ) technique . for the detailed description of the sph theory and the corresponding technique ,",
    "readers are directed to @xcite .",

    "the molecular cloud in our model is under the effects of both uv and fuv radiation fields .",
    "the uv radiation is from a nearby star and interacts with the molecular cloud through the top layer of the surface facing the star ( front surface ) .",
    "the fuv radiation onto the front surface is from the nearby star and that onto the rear surface is from the background star light @xcite .",
    "then the fuv radiation field around a molecular cloud can be approximated as a spherical radiation field @xcite .",
    "the the effect of the fuv field on the molecular cloud is mainly through the photoelectric emission of electrons from grains and is treated in the same way as that in @xcite . in the following part of this subsection we only need",
    "discuss how to deal with the ionising radiation ( uv ) field from the nearby star .",
    "although helium ionisation was included in the chemical network , we could safely neglect it when dealing with the ionisation radiation transfer , ionisation heating and cooling for simplicity , because of the much lower abundance of the helium compared to hydrogen atoms @xcite .",
    "the implementation of ionising radiation from nearby stars into the above sph code is based on solving the following ionisation rate and radiative transfer equations , @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the ionisation rate with @xmath23 being the effective ionisation cross section ; @xmath24 is the recombination rate with @xmath25 being the effective recombination coefficient under the assumption of the on the spot approximation @xcite . in its original definition ,",
    "the recombination coefficient @xmath26 includes all of the individual recombination coefficients @xmath27 to the hydrogen atomic energy level @xmath28 . in the on the spot assumption , recombinations into the ground level ( @xmath29 )",
    "do not lead to any net effect on the change in ionisation rate , since the photons released from this recombination process are able to re - ionise other hydrogen atoms on the spot .",
    "therefore @xmath30 can be neglected and the resulting net recombination coefficient can be written as @xmath31 for a planner infall of ionising photons from a distant source on the boarder with a flux @xmath32 as the lyman continuum photons per unit time and square area , the solution of eq.([j0 ] ) is @xmath33\\ ] ] where @xmath34 is the optical depth for ionising photons along the line of sight parallel to the infall direction of the photons , and @xmath35 is the distance from the border of the integration volume along the line of sight . neglecting the absorption effect of dust on ionising radiation",

    "we employ the method introduced by @xcite in the above three - step work .",

    "so we do nt repeat them here ; b ) the hydrogen ionisation heating @xmath62 produced by the illumination of uv component ( @xmath63ev ) from a nearby massive star , which is highly directional and whose strength is dependent on the distance of the cloud from the star .",
    "its formula can be derived through the following considerations .",
    "when an atom with ionisation energy @xmath64 is ionised following the absorption of one photon of frequency @xmath65 and energy @xmath66 , it releases one electron which carries the excess kinetic energy @xmath67 which will be transfered to the gas through collisions with other gas particles .",
    "the resulting heating rate is described by the following equation . @xmath68 where @xmath48 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath69",
    "is expressed as @xcite @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the stellar temperature , and @xmath72 with @xmath73 being the frequency of the lyman limit .",
    "heating of the gas is also affected by cosmic ray heating , h@xmath74 formation heating and gas - dust thermal exchange , for which the same formulae as that in @xcite are used in our model .",
    "the cooling function @xmath75 is affected by recombination of the electrons with ions , the collisional excitation of oii lines and by co , ci , cii and oi line emission .",
    "when a free electron in the plasma is captured by a proton , a photon is emitted and an amount of energy @xmath76 is removed from the internal energy of the gas . the cooling rate due to this process is @xcite @xmath77 where @xmath78 .",
    "another important cooling resource comes from the collisional excitation of low - lying energy levels of oii ions in spite of their low abundance , since oii has energy levels with excitation potentials of the order of @xmath79 .",
    "we use the following simplified formula derived by @xcite to calculate the cooling rate due to the collisional excitation of oii , @xmath80 with @xmath81 = 7.9 t_1 - 26.8\\ ] ] @xmath82 = 1.9 \\frac{t_2}{|t_2|^{0.5 } } - 20.5\\ ] ] with @xmath83 = @xmath84 k@xmath85 and @xmath86 k@xmath85 and @xmath87 .",
    "the above formula is valid under the limit of low electron density @xmath88 @xmath89 , which is true for the brcs structure .",
    "the cooling affects @xmath90 by co , ci , cii and oi line emission are same as those in the @xcite .",
    "the molecule cloud is assumed to have a spherical symmetry and its mass is uniformly distributed through a sphere of radius @xmath91 .",
    "it is embedded in surrounding hot medium with a constant density ( hii region ) @xcite .",
    "the external pressure by the surrounding hot medium provides an inwardly directed pressure force whose characteristic magnitude is similar to that expected from a hii region . the value of the assumed boundary pressure @xmath92 we adopted here is equivalent to an ionised gas with @xmath93@xmath89 and @xmath94k@xcite , which resembles to lefloch s zero radial velocity boundary condition .",
    "an outflow condition is imposed at a fixed radius equal to several times of the original radius of the cloud .",
    "material that expand beyond this radius is simply removed from the calculation . by this time",
    ", these particles represent very low density material and so provide little uv extinction or other influence in the simulations .",
    "the initial turbulent velocity field was set up in the usual manner , as described by @xcite , with perturbations set up with a flat power spectrum @xmath95 , and with a minimum wavenumber @xmath96 corresponding to a wavelength equal to the cloud diameter .",
    "eight wave numbers were used to set up the velocity perturbations with the maximum , @xmath97 .",
    "the velocity perturbations were drawn from a gaussian random field determined by its power spectrum in fourier space .",
    "for each three dimensional wavenumber @xmath48 , we randomly select an amplitude from a gaussian distribution centred on zero , and of height @xmath95 , and selected a random phase uniformly distributed between 0 and @xmath98 .",
    "the field is then transformed back into real space to get the real velocity for each particle , and then multiplied by the amplitude needed to obtain the required total kinetic energy for the cloud .",
    "this procedure is repeated for each velocity component independently to get the full three dimensional velocity field .",
    "the amplitude of the turbulent motion was normalised such that the total kinetic energy of the clouds equals their initial gravitational potential energy .",
    "the initial geometry of the cloud and radiation field configurations are shown in figure [ geometric ] . since the distance of the cloud to the nearby illuminating star",
    "is assumed to be large compared to the radius of the cloud , the uv radiations from the star can then be treated as a plane - parallel radiation onto the front surface of the cloud @xcite while the fuv radiation is isotropic to the cloud @xcite    the radiation flux distribution at the boundary is    @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the value of the lyman continuum flux at the surface of the cloud for which we take the typical value of @xmath101 @xmath102 s@xmath103 @xcite ; @xmath104 is the value of the interstellar radiation at the surface of the cloud which has the value of 100@xmath105 , where @xmath106 is the mean interstellar medium radiation flux and traditionally known as the habing flux @xcite ; @xmath107 is the azimuthal angle in a spherical coordinate .",
    "@xcite classified the initial physical properties of a cloud and uv radiation field in a two dimensional parameter space ( @xmath108 ) , which are defined by the following equations@xcite , @xmath109 where @xmath110 relates the overpressure of the ionised gas to the undisturbed neutral gas and @xmath111 is the ratio of recombination rate to the ionisation rate , @xmath112 is the ionised gas density around the cloud , @xmath113 is the initial density of the hydrogen in the cloud .",
    "@xmath114 is a parameter to describe the effective thickness of the recombination layer around the molecular cloud and @xmath115 is the isothermal sound speed in the ionised gas with @xmath116 being the gas constant .",
    "the 2-d parameter space can be divided into five different regions according to the effect of the uv radiation on the evolution of a cloud .",
    "region i is defined by @xmath117 , where the opacity of the cloud is very low ( @xmath118 ) so that it is initially transparent to the uv radiation",
    ". region ii is defined by @xmath119 with @xmath120 being the isothermal sound speed in the neutral gas of temperature @xmath121 , in which the effect of the ionisation is too weak to produce any noticeable dynamical effect .",
    "therefore clouds starting in region i and ii are too trivial to be discussed .    on the other end ,",
    "when @xmath110 is high , i.e. , @xmath122 , which defines the region iii , the cloud is entirely photo - ionised in an ionisation flash by lefloch s model in which the self - gravity of the cloud is not taken into account .",
    "region iv is defined by @xmath123 , where the whole dynamical evolution of the cloud will be governed by the propagation of a d type ionisation front preceded by an isothermal shock in the cloud .",
    "finally @xmath124 defines the region v , where an initial weak r ionisation front would gradually become a d type ionisation front propagating toward the interior of the cloud .    for the clouds starting in regions iii - v ,",
    "although the detailed evolutionary features of the cloud can only be obtained through the numerical simulations described above , an existing simplified analytical result derived by @xcite could help astronomers predict the final evolution of the globule under observation and also provides us a way to validate our numerical results .",
    "therefore we briefly present it in the following subsection .",
    "in the simplified analytical result , only the effect of uv component is considered since it is much stronger than fuv radiation as given in section 2.5 . the viscosity term in equation ( 2 )",
    "will be neglected because of its smaller magnitude than the other terms .",
    "after an initial ionising stage by the uv radiation flux , the stream of the ionised hydrogen forms a warm halo around the globule which has a radius @xmath125 , at which the globule is bounded by an ionisation front while an isothermal shock propagates toward the interior of the globule . assuming a steady ionised gas flow from the surface of the globule which can be approximated as a spherical isothermal sphere and a balanced ionisation - recombination in the halo , @xcite derived a necessary condition for the globule to be stable against the gravitational collapse . based on the analytical solutions of equation ( 1 - 2 ) in the ionised gas halo and in the neutral globule , this critical condition is expressed by the current mass of the neutral globule @xmath126 where @xmath127 is the gravitational constant .",
    "the importance of this result is that the quantities such as @xmath128 , @xmath129 and @xmath32(lyman ) can be estimated by the observational data , then equation([mass1 ] ) can be used to estimate the maximum mass for the globule to contain in order not to go collapse if the structures of both the globule and halo can be regarded as steady . on the other hand",
    "if the current mass @xmath130 of the globule derived from the observational data is higher than @xmath131 , the globule under the investigation would finally collapse to form new star at the end of the evolution , vice verse , the globule may stay stable until it is completely evaporated by the uv radiation .",
    "the advantage of the equation([mass1 ] ) is that the criteria for globule s stability is in terms of the current mass of the globule instead of the initial mass of the cloud , the latter is hardly known by observations .    in the following",
    ", we will discuss the detailed evolutionary features of clouds , based on the numerical simulations . in this paper",
    "we will mainly study the morphological evolution of brcs and try to find solutions for the questions raised in the beginning of the paper . a systematic investigation on the ionisation radiation triggered star formation in brcs",
    "will be presented in our next paper .",
    "the most important difference between our newly developed rdi model and lefloch s model is the inclusion of the self - gravity of a molecular cloud , therefore we will firstly investigate the role of the self - gravity of a molecular cloud in its dynamical evolution when it is under the effect of uv radiations , so that we can explore the possibility to relax the extreme zero velocity boundary condition in order to derive the predominance of type a brcs , and discuss the possible modification to the classification of lefloch s 2-d parameter space caused by the inclusion of the self - gravity of the molecular cloud .",
    "we then will explore the effects of initial thermal state of a cloud , the strength of uv radiation flux , and also initial turbulent state ( non - thermal motion ) on the morphological evolution of molecular clouds .",
    "the molecular cloud is presented by 20,000 sph particles . in the following analysis to the numerical results , we will concentrate on the effect of the uv radiation falling onto the surface of the front hemisphere , since the heating effect of photoelectric emission of electrons from dust grains by the isotropic fuv radiation is much weaker than that of hydrogen ionisation by lyman continuum radiation which only affects those gas particles at the front surface layer .",
    "the gravitational potential energy of a spherically uniform molecular cloud of mass @xmath130 and radius @xmath91 is @xmath132 . in order to explore the role of the initial self - gravity of a molecular cloud in its morphological evolution ,",
    "we perform two different sets of simulations , one set of the three clouds having a same mass of 35m@xmath133 but different radii , the other having a same radius of 0.5 pc but different masses .",
    "therefore our simulations cover different cases in which the initial self - gravity of a molecular cloud changes .",
    "the initial temperature of the molecular clouds is all set to 60 k. these chosen initial conditions guarantee that the simulated molecular cloud will not collapse by self - gravity if there is no external radiations .      due to the change of the radii of clouds , the initial ionisation / recombination states change as well .",

    "list the parameters of the first set clouds called a , b , c and their initial locations in the ( @xmath108 ) parameter space respectively .",
    "the features of cloud d in the list will be discussed later .",
    "the ratio of the initial gravitational energy of the three cloud a , b , and c is @xmath134 and the ratio of gravitational forces of the clouds a , b and c onto a mass element at their surfaces are correspondingly @xmath135 , which defines significantly different initial self - gravity in the three molecular clouds .    according to lefloch s model , cloud",
    "a would evolve into a cometary globule after passing a morphological sequence from type a to type b then to type c , and finally it will be completely evaporated in a few mys , while cloud b and c would be evaporated in a so called ionisation flash. it is our interest to see how these clouds would evolve differently if the self - gravity of a cloud is taken into account .    *",
    "i : cloud a *    the images in figure [ figa1 ] reveal the morphological evolution of cloud a by number density of hydrogen nuclei and the line plots in figure [ figb1 ] describe how the uv radiation induced shock front leads the ionisation front propagating into the interior of the cloud and finally results in the collapse of the cloud .",

    "the highest value of the initial self - gravitational energy of cloud a is about 20 times of the lowest value for cloud a@xmath211 .",
    "it is obvious the difference in the initial self - gravitational energies among the three clouds is much more distinctive than the difference in their initial ionisation states .",
    "therefore , we can safely conclude that the different morphological evolutions of the three clouds are caused by their different initial self - gravitational states .",
    "the role of the initial self - gravity in determining the morphological evolutions of the brcs is further confirmed .      from the morphological evolution paths of the 7 clouds",

    "we have shown that the self - gravity indeed plays an important role in the morphological evolution of the molecular clouds . for any change in the initial conditions of a cloud , if it greatly results in a change in its initial self - gravitational state , the cloud will alter its morphological evolution .      in order to see how the three clouds would evolve",

    "we re - run the simulations for cloud a , b and c respectively by setting a zero initial velocity field to each of them .",

    "this is because the density in the initial halo of a cloud is lower than that in the same part of the initially uniform cloud hence the halo in the front hemisphere is at a higher initial ionisation state , in which particles are easier to be ionised and then to be photo - evaporated .    in summary",
    ", the initial mass condensation state does affect a cloud s morphological evolutions because it changes the initial self - gravitational state of a cloud .      as stated in section 2.5",

    "the variation of the initial temperature of molecular clouds between 10 - 100 k does not significantly change the morphological evolution of a cloud , which is physically understandable since the thermal pressure of a cloud is not important in the dynamical evolution in brcs @xcite .",
    "higher initial temperature in a cloud delays its collapsing time , for the initial thermal motions of gas particles dissipate over a period of time .",
    "the morphological evolution of a cloud is mainly decided by the dynamical behaviour of the gas particles within the two sides of the cloud ( @xmath247 ) , which is largely dependent on the strength of the ionising flux and the self - gravity of the cloud as shown in section 4.1 .",
    "however , the initial temperature of a cloud does affect the amount of mass condensed in the core of a brc , for which we will have a detailed discussion when we study the uv radiation triggered star formation in brcs in our next paper .",
    "we also carried out a set of simulations on the influence of the strength of an ionising flux on the evolutionary process of brcs .",
    "the change in the strength of ionising flux incident on the front surface of a molecular cloud corresponds to two different cases : i ) a cloud can be at different distances from an ionising star ; ii ) an ionising star in different types radiates with different flux strength .",
    "this set of simulations is to see whether the molecular clouds within one giant cloud cluster would exhibit essential difference in their morphological evolutions due to their different distances from the central star .    since the ionising flux @xmath248 , where @xmath249 is the distance of a cloud from the ionising star . for each of cloud a , b and c",
    ", we re - run the simulations twice by setting two different @xmath250 flux values .",
    "if we assume cloud a , b and c in section 4.1.1 are in a distance of @xmath251 from the ionising star , then @xmath252 means we move the star twice distance away , i.e. , @xmath253 .",
    "if we set @xmath254 which means the original cloud is moved to half distance closer , i.e , @xmath255 .",
    "the spatial range of 0.5 - 2 @xmath251 from the ionising star should be large enough to include most molecular clouds in one cloud cluster .",
    "the simulation results revealed that for all of the three molecular cloud a , b , and c , their morphological evolutions are not very sensitive to the strength of the ionising flux in the above specified range and they follow very similar evolutionary sequences to that when ionising flux is @xmath256 .",
    "the result looks a bit puzzling at the first glance , since the velocity component @xmath195 of the ionised gas in the top layer of the cloud increases with the ionising flux , as shown in figure [ figv ] , so that we should expect the angle @xmath200 decreases with the ionising flux , which will favour the formation of type c rim morphology .",
    "however , if we consider the effect of the enhanced shock effect due to increased ionising flux , the compression to the core in the front hemisphere will be stronger .",
    "therefore the core will exert a stronger attractive force on its peripheral gas particles which then results in a higher @xmath154 so that angle @xmath200 of the velocity remains basically unchanged although the magnitude of the total velocity may increase , which would decrease the time needed for the gas particles in the ear - like structures to collapse onto the symmetrical axis .",
    "the same consideration can explain the insensitivity of the morphological evolution of the cloud to the decreased radiation flux and the time needed for the gas particles to collapse onto the symmetrical axis is found to be elongated .",
    "the simulations on a set of molecular clouds reveal that the morphological evolution of a molecular cloud under the effect of the uv radiation does not necessarily go through all of the three morphologies and then end up at cometary type c morphology as described by the previous models . depending on its initial gravitational state",
    ", a cloud could evolve to any one of the three type brcs .",
    "the diversity of the evolutionary sequence of brcs revealed from our modelling provides a good prospect for us to explore the possible explanations for the questions raised from brcs observations and presented in the introduction of this paper .",
    "the modelling results for the molecular cloud a , b , c under the same initial temperature and ionising flux tell us that the evolutionary paths of all molecular clouds would firstly pass the type a morphology .",
    "however some of molecular clouds would only evolve to a quasi - equilibrium type a morphology plus a highly condensed core at the head of its front hemisphere , if their initial self - gravitational energy is high enough .",
    "therefore we shall statistically be able to observe many more type a brcs than type b or c brcs in a random observation .",
    "our modelling results also shows that the uv radiation triggered collapse of a cloud onto the centre core in its front hemisphere could occur with any one of the three morphologies , so it is not surprising at all that the uv radiation triggered star formation occurring in type a brcs could be observed .",
    "finally , we come to understand the spacial sequence of type a - b - c brcs with their distance from the centre star in the ori ob 1 association @xcite . we might think this morphological distribution of brcs as the result of decreasing illuminating flux with distance .",
    "however as shown in the argument in section 4.6 , the morphological evolution of the cloud is insensitive to the change of the uv radiation flux in the range discussed .",
    "based on the results derived from the simulations , we can understand this observation from two aspects .",
    "first , we know that where a new star is formed inside a giant molecular cloud as a result of local molecular gas collapse onto a central point , the density of the surrounding gas can be reasonably assumed to decrease with the distance from the central star . it is also known that giant molecular clouds are very clump @xcite . considering the above two points we can assume that the densities of molecular clumps surrounding a new star decrease with their distance @xmath249 from the central star . if we further assume that the clumps in a giant molecular cloud are of similar radius @xmath91 , then the initial gravitational potential energy of a clump decrease with their distance from the centre of the star for the gravitational potential energy can be written as @xmath257 , where @xmath20 is the initial number density of the clumps .",
    "the molecular clumps closest to the central star could possibly evolve to a quasi - equilibrium type a brc because they have highest initial self - gravitational potential energies , while for those clumps farther away , they evolve from type a to a quasi - equilibrium type b brc because of their moderate initial self - gravitational potential energies . for those farthest away from the central star , they evolve to pass type a and b morphologies , then to a cometary type c morphology due to their lowest initial self - gravitational potential energies .",
    "secondly , we already showed in section 4.4 that at the borders of hii region , type a brcs are favoured .",
    "therefore the spatial sequence of type a - b - c brcs with their distance to the central star can be seen as a manifestation of the mass density distribution of the very clumpy giant molecular clouds .",
    "a three dimensional and comprehensive rdi model has been developed with the sph technique , which self - consistently includes the hydrodynamical evolution , the self - gravity of the cloud , the energy evolution , radiation transferring and a basic chemical network .",
    "t the investigation on the morphological evolutions of brcs are carried out by employing the newly developed model in order to understand a series of puzzles coming from brcs observations .",
    "it is found that the morphological evolution of a molecular cloud is much more sensitive to its initial self - gravitational state than to other physical conditions such as the initial temperature between 20 and 100 k , or the ionising radiation flux within one order of magnitude higher or lower than @xmath32(lyman ) .",
    "our modelling results have revealed that there are three different evolutionary prospects when a molecular cloud is under the effects of ionisation radiations .    for a molecular cloud of an initial mass 35 m@xmath133 and initial temperature 60 k under the effects of uv and fuv radiation fields specified above , the simulation results revealed : a ) if its initial radius is 0.5 pc , it will evolve to a quasi - stable type a brc ; b ) when its initial radius increases to 1.3 pc , its evolution will firstly pass a type a morphology and continue its journey to a quasi - stable type b rimmed morphology ; c ) when the initial radius further increases to 1.9 pc , its evolutionary process follows a sequence of type a@xmath0b@xmath0c morphologies .",
    "d ) further increasing the cloud s radius to 4.7 pc , the evolution of the cloud also follows the sequence of type a @xmath0b@xmath0c , but the finally formed type c brc will be totally photoevaporated .",
    "further simulation results also show that the initial central condensation of the mass in a cloud could change its morphological evolution in term of its initially uniform correspondence . at the border of hii regions ,",
    "the formation of type a brcs are favoured . when a molecular cloud is set to a zero initial self - gravitational potential energy or with a low initial density ,",
    "its morphological evolution sequence is consistent with that by lefloch s model which is a 2-d model and did nt include the self - gravity of the cloud .    with the knowledge obtained from the modelling ,",
    "we are now able to confront with the questions raised by observations . since all of the clouds evolve to pass a type a morphology and some of the clouds with enough high initial gravitational potential energy would just evolve to a quasi - stable type a morphology , statistically many more type a brcs",
    "should be observed over a random observation . for those brcs who evolve to a quasi - stable type a rimmed morphology ,",
    "if the core mass contained in their front hemisphere is high enough for it to collapse , new star could be triggered to form .",
    "star forming signal should be observed .",
    "furthermore if the initial densities of the molecular clumps in ori ob 1 associations decrease with their distances from the centre of the ionising star , a spacial distribution of type a - b - c brcs with distance from the central star could exist .",
    "it is obvious that the inclusion of the self - gravitation in our model revealed a diversity of the evolutionary sequence of a molecular cloud under the effects of uv radiations .",
    "the satisfactory explanations based on the modelling results to the observational puzzles state that the self - gravity of a molecular cloud indeed plays an important role in controlling the evolutionary destiny of a molecular cloud and should not be neglected especially when we try to achieve a whole picture of the dynamical evolutions of molecular clouds .",
    "this is because the radiation induced shock dramatically enhances the effect of the self - gravity of the clouds .",
    "consequently , some modifications on the region classification in lefloch s parameter space have been confidently derived .",
    "the boundary between the d - type ionisation front and ionising flush is extended from @xmath258 to 23 as a result of the inclusion of the self - gravity of the molecular cloud .",
