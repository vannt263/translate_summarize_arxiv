    "the classical infinite hilbert matrices @xmath1 have been widely studied in the mathematical literature , for a variety of good reasons ( see @xcite for a nice survey of their astonishing properties ) . in this paper , we present results and conjectures on spectral properties of these matrices and related types of matrices . we first review known results in section [ sec : survey ] and then introduce new results in section [ sec : new ] on generalized weighted hilbert matrices of the form @xmath2 our results can be summarized as follows",
    ". theorem [ thm : maj ] below states a surprising property of these matrices : their spectral norm depends monotonically in the absolute values of their entries , a property known a priori only for matrices with positive entries .",
    "a second important result ( theorem [ thm : det ] ) is that the determinant of such matrices are polynomials in the square of their entries .",
    "we prove next in lemma [ lem:5 ] a key relation between the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of these matrices , that lead to a chain of nice consequences ( among which corollaries [ cor:1 ] and [ cor:2 ] ) .",
    "the present work finds its roots in the seminal paper of montgomery and vaughan @xcite , which initiated the study of generalized hilbert matrices .",

    "the infinite - dimensional matrices presented in are two different versions of the classical hilbert matrix .",
    "notice first that @xmath17 is a toeplitz matrix ( i.e.  a matrix whose entry @xmath18 only depends on the difference @xmath19 ) , while @xmath20 is a hankel matrix ( i.e.  a matrix whose entry @xmath18 only depends on the sum @xmath21 ) .",
    "the original hilbert inequalities state ( see @xcite ) that for @xmath22 ( resp .  in @xmath23 ) with @xmath24 , @xmath25 where @xmath26 can not be replaced by a smaller constant instead of @xmath26 ; the optimal constant was found later by schur . ] .",
    "this is saying that @xmath17 ( resp .",
    "@xmath20 ) is a bounded operator in @xmath27 ( resp .  in @xmath28 ) , with norm equal to @xmath26 .",
    "hardy , littlewood and plya obtained an explicit expression for @xmath29 in @xcite , for all values of @xmath30 : @xmath31 and titchmarsh proved in @xcite that @xmath32 . also , @xmath33 is clearly greater than or equal to @xmath29 , as @xmath20 may be seen as the lower - left corner of @xmath17 ( up to a column permutation ) , but no exact value is known for it ( except in the case where @xmath34 or @xmath35 for some integer @xmath36 ; see @xcite for a review of the subject ) .",
    "consider now the corresponding finite - dimensional matrices @xmath37 and @xmath38 of size @xmath39 : @xmath40 the above hilbert inequalities imply that for every integer @xmath41 , both @xmath42 clearly also , both @xmath43 and @xmath44 increase as @xmath45 increases , and @xmath46 .",
    "a question of interest is the convergence speed of @xmath44 and @xmath43 towards their common limiting value  @xmath26 . observing that up a column permutation ,",
    "@xmath38 can be seen as the lower - left corner of @xmath47 , we see that @xmath48 for every integer @xmath49 .",
    "this hints at a slower convergence speed for the matrices @xmath38 than for the matrices @xmath37 .",

    "the above theorem does however not apply to hilbert matrices of the form @xmath37 , as the harmonic series @xmath78 diverges , so condition is not satisfied .",

    "the problem of evaluating the convergence speed of the spectral norm is a difficult one when @xmath58 attains its maximum at a point of discontinuity .",
    "an interesting matrix entering into this category has been the object of a detailed study by slepian in @xcite ( see also @xcite for a recent exposition of the problem ) .",

    "let @xmath93 be a vector of distinct real numbers , @xmath94 be another vector of real numbers , and let us define the matrices @xmath95 and @xmath96 of size @xmath39 as @xmath97 and @xmath98 if there is no risk of confusion , the matrices @xmath95 and @xmath96 will be denoted as @xmath99 and @xmath100 , respectively .",
    "in order to motivate the study of generalized hilbert matrices , let us mention here both a result and a conjecture made by montgomery and vaughan .",
    "the next section will be devoted to applications of these questions .    in @xcite , montgomery and",
    "vaughan showed the following result . if @xmath95 is the @xmath39 matrix with entries as in , then @xmath101 where @xmath102 .",
    "they further showed that if @xmath96 is the @xmath39 matrix with entries as in with @xmath103 and @xmath104 , then @xmath105 they also conjectured that the tightest upper bound is actually @xmath106 . in @xcite , montgomery and vaughan s result was improved to @xmath107 , but the conjecture remains open so far .",
    "let @xmath108 be real numbers which are distinct modulo @xmath109 .",
    "let also @xmath110 be the distance from the real number @xmath111 to the closest integer and let @xmath112 for @xmath113 an arbitrary sequence of complex numbers , we write @xmath114 a large sieve inequality has the generic form @xmath115 using hilbert s inequality , one can show that the previous inequality holds with @xmath116 .",
    "equivalently , this says that @xmath117 besides , generalized hilbert inequalities of the type are particularly useful when studying irregularly spaced @xmath118 ( such as farey sequences ) .",
    "these generalized inequalities allow to prove the following refined large sieve inequality : @xmath119 this last result is useful for arithmetic applications , as it allows e.g.  to show ( see @xcite ) that @xmath120 ( @xmath121 being the number of primes smaller than or equal to @xmath122 ) , whereas the inequality @xmath123 stands as a conjecture so far .",
    "another important application of large sieve inequalities is the bombieri - vinogradov theorem ( see for instance @xcite ) , which is related to various conjectures on the distribution of primes .      in @xcite , montgomery and vaughan study variants of hilbert s inequality ( with for instance @xmath124 replaced by @xmath125 ) , which allow them to show the following result : if @xmath126 , then @xmath127 the key idea behind the proof of the main result in @xcite is the following identity : @xmath128 which is of the same type as our relation below .",
    "building on this , a further generalization of hilbert s inequalities has been performed in @xcite , where the following functional equations are solved : @xmath129",
    "notice for matrices @xmath133 with positive entries , it holds that if @xmath134 for all @xmath135 , then @xmath136 .",
    "consider indeed the normalized eigenvector @xmath137 corresponding to the largest eigenvalue of @xmath138 : as @xmath138 has positive entries , @xmath137 is also positive , so @xmath139 . the above result",
    "states that a similar result holds for matrices of the form @xmath96 , even though these do not have positive entries .",
    "notice first that @xmath152 as @xmath153 , we may consider @xmath154 in the above sum .",
    "for each @xmath155 , define @xmath156 ( where by convention , we set @xmath157 in the above definition ) . ordering the terms in the above sum according to the value of @xmath158",
    ", we obtain @xmath159 which is the first equality in the lemma .",
    "the second one follows from and the fact that @xmath100 is antisymmetric .",
    "_ proof of theorem [ thm : maj ] .",
    "_ observe that since the matrix @xmath161 is hermitian , it has @xmath45 real eigenvalues @xmath162 corresponding to an orthonormal basis of eigenvectors , so @xmath163 and for a positive integer @xmath142 @xmath164 therefore , we obtain @xmath165 and the theorem follows from lemma [ lem:3 ] .",
    "@xmath166                _ proof of theorem [ thm : det ] . _ by definition , @xmath183 now , every permutation @xmath184 is a product of cycles , say @xmath185 .",
    "let us denote by @xmath186 the respective cardinalities of these cycles and let us set @xmath187 in the above expression for @xmath188 , the contribution of the permutations having these sets as support for their cycles is @xmath189 by and the fact that the main diagonal is zero , a non - zero contribution can therefore only occur when all cycles are of cardinality @xmath190 , which proves the theorem .",
    "@xmath166    the above statement allows to recover part of the conclusion of lemma [ lem:3 ] .",
    "first notice that by theorem [ thm : det ] and for all @xmath191 , @xmath192 , where @xmath193 , is also a polynomial in @xmath167 .",
    "define then @xmath194 where @xmath195 are the eigenvalues of @xmath100 .",
    "notice that @xmath196 indeed , let @xmath197 be the polynomial defined as @xmath198 . we observe that on one hand , the matrix - valued version of this polynomial is given by @xmath199 while on the other hand , @xmath200 so identifying the coefficients , we obtain equality .",
    "this implies that @xmath201 is also a polynomial in @xmath167 . finally , for @xmath202",
    ", we have the following recursion , also known as newton - girard s formula : @xmath203 for example , @xmath204,@xmath205 , @xmath206 , @xmath207 , etc .",
    "we therefore find by induction that for all @xmath142 , @xmath208 is also a polynomial in @xmath167 , but this alone does not guarantee the positivity of the coefficients , obtained in lemma [ lem:3 ] above .    [",

    "the approach taken below generalizes the method initiated by montgomery and vaughan in @xcite .",

    "therefore , @xmath218 where @xmath219 corresponds to the terms in the sum with @xmath220 , i.e. @xmath221 and @xmath222 as @xmath223 are all distinct in the above sum , we can use and the antisymmetry of @xmath99 gives @xmath224 so @xmath225 with @xmath226 as @xmath227 is an eigenvector of @xmath100 , it follows that @xmath228 likewise , noticing that @xmath229 is also an eigenvector of @xmath100 ( with corresponding eigenvalue @xmath230 ) , we obtain @xmath231 from , we deduce that @xmath232 now , using this together with and , we finally obtain @xmath233 which completes the proof .        indeed , if in the basis of eigenvectors of @xmath100 , there were two eigenvectors corresponding to the same eigenvalue , then it would be possible to find a linear combination of them ( which is also an eigenvector ) such that one component ( say @xmath235 ) would be equal to zero .",

    "the left - hand side inequality is clear , as the @xmath267 column of @xmath99 is the image by @xmath99 of the @xmath267 canonical vector . for the right - hand side inequality , we use , choosing @xmath268 such that @xmath269 for all @xmath270 , and @xmath271 .",

    "we shall now prove inequality , namely the fact that there exist positive constants @xmath275 and @xmath276 such that @xmath277 the lower bound can be deduced from lemma [ lem:5 ] . from equation , we indeed see that if @xmath278 , then @xmath279 so @xmath280 which is indeed of the type @xmath281 .",
