    "recently the geometrically frustrated electron systems have provided hot topics in the field of condensed matter physics @xcite .",
    "ferromagnetic pyrochlore @xmath3mo@xmath4o@xmath5 ( @xmath6=nd , sm , gd ) is one key type of the geometrically frustrated systems @xcite , which consists of corner - sharing tetrahedrons and the antiferromagnetic interactions between nearest - neighbor spins are frustrated .",
    "it was recently pointed out that even the ferromagnetic interaction is frustrated , if the spin easy axis points to the center of the tetrahedron @xcite . in this case , the spin chirality @xcite , which originated from the noncoplanar spin configuration , is expected to affect the quantum of the electrons , especially the transverse conductivity .",
    "this mechanism is also called berry phase contribution  because a non - vanishing spin chirality is associated with a non - vanishing spin berry phase for conduction electrons . to interpret the transport experiments on ferromagnetic pyrochlore @xcite , ohgushi et al .",
    "@xcite studied the hall effect in a two - dimensional ( 2d ) kagom lattice , which is the cross section of the porochlore lattice perpendicular to the ( 1,1,1 ) direction @xcite .",
    "they obtained that if the chiral spin state is realized , the system can show a quantized hall effect . in their model",
    "an important limit is used , which is that the electron conduction spins are colinear with lattice ( ions ) spins .",
    "this limit is called that the strong ( or infinite ) hund s coupling limit .",
    "however , detailed experiments on the pyrochlores @xcite show that the chiral mechanism alone can not explain the anomalous transport phenomena in these systems . to explain these experiments , taillefumier et al .",
    "@xcite studied the same lattice in a general case , which extrapolates the strong and weak hund s coupling regions .",
    "they found that the spin berry phase contribution does not depend only on the spin chirality , but also on the strength of the local hund s coupling .    on the other hand ,",
    "the orbital magnetism of bloch electrons has been attracted renewed interest , due to the recent recognition @xcite that the berry phase effect plays an important role on orbital magnetism as well as on the hall conductivity .",
    "the berry phase effect on orbital magnetism was until now partially presented by very few studies @xcite .",
    "due to its basic importance in understanding the magnetism and transport features of the materials , obviously , more work are needed in exploiting the berry phase effect on the properties of the orbital magnetization ( om ) in various kinds of realistic physical systems .    in this paper",
    "we extend the study of the om to the ferromagnetic pyrochlore systems ; more specially , we focus our attention to the 2d kagom lattice with spin anisotropies and hund s coupling included .",
    "it is found that the two parts in om ( see sec .",
    "ii ) , i.e. , the conventional part @xmath7 and the berry - phase correction part @xmath8 , oppose each other .",
    "in particular , the om displays fully different behaviors in metallic and insulating regions due to the different roles @xmath7 and @xmath8 play in these two regions .",
    "moreover , similar to the role the hund s coupling plays in determining the anomalous hall conductivity as observed in the above - mentioned experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite works , we find that the om is also importantly affected by the hund s coupling . in particular , in the weak coupling case that the mott gap bewteen the upper and lower hurbard bands is overcome by the electron kinetic energy , we show that the om exhibits complex behaviors when scanning the fermi energy through the whole series of occupied bands .",
    "furthermore , by using the obtained values of the om we also calculate the anomalous nernst conductivity , which is featured by a complicated peak - valley pattern as a function of the electron fermi energy .",
    "before studying the om of the 2d kagom lattice , we simply review the general multiband formula for finite - temperature om in the semiclassical picture of bloch electrons . in the semiclassical picture @xcite ,",
    "the bloch electron for the @xmath9th band is treated as a wave packet @xmath10 with its center ( @xmath11 ) in the phase space .",
    "the orbital magnetic moment characterizes the rotation of the wave packet around its centroid and is given by @xmath12=@xmath13 is the charge of the electron and @xmath14 is the velocity operator . by writing the wave packet in terms of the bloch state , one obtains (",

    "however , it was further found @xcite that the presence of a weak magnetic field @xmath21 will result in a modification of the density of states in the semiclassical phase space , @xmath22 , where @xmath23-space . due to this weak - field modification and",

    "( [ e3 ] ) is a berry phase effect and exposes a new topological ingredient to the orbital magnetism .",
