    "serotonergic neurons in the drn , which extensively innervate most brain regions , have a large influence on many aspects of behavior , including sleep - wake cycles , mood and impulsivity ( liu et al , 2004 ; miyazaki et al . ,",
    "the firing patterns of these cells have been much studied and many properties of the ionic currents underlying action potentials have been investigated ( aghajanian , 1985 ; segal , 1985 ; burlhis and aghajanian , 1987 ; penington et al . , 1991 , 1992 ; penington and fox , 1995 ) . in order to quantitatively analyze action potential generation in drn 5-ht neurons , it is desirable to have accurate knowledge of the activation and inactivation properties of the various ion currents for some of which there is relatively little or no data available . here",
    "we report results for the fast transient potassium current which plays an important role in determining the cell s firing rate .",
    "mathematical modeling of electrophysiological dynamics has been pursued for many different nerve and muscle cell types .",
    "some well known neuronal examples are thalamic relay cells ( huguenard and mccormick , 1992 ; destexhe et al . ,",
    "1998 ; rhodes and llinas , 2005 ) , dopaminergic cells ( komendantov et al . , 2004 ; putzier et al . , 2009 ; kuznetsova et al . ,",

    ", 2001 ; traub et al , 2003 ; yu et al . , 2008 ) .",
    "cardiac myocytes have also been the subject of numerous computational modeling studies with similar structure and equivalent complexity to that of neurons ( faber et al .",
    ", 2007 ; williams et al . , 2010 ) .    the methods employed by hodgkin and huxley ( 1952 ) to describe mathematically the time ( and space ) course of nerve membrane potential have , for the most part , endured to the present day",
    "an integral component of their model consists of differential equations for activation and ( if present ) inactivation variables , generically represented in the non - spatial models as @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively , where @xmath8 is time and @xmath9 is membrane potential .",
    "these equations are = , .2 in = , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are steady state values and @xmath12 and @xmath13 are time constants which often depend on @xmath9 . for voltage - gated ion channels the current",
    "is often assumed to be i= ( v - v_rev ) m^ph where @xmath14 is the maximal conductance , @xmath15 is the reversal potential for the ion species under consideration and @xmath16 is ( usually ) a small non - negative integer between 1 and 4 .",
    "the inactivation is invariably to the power one , as in ( 2 ) .",
    "although these equations have solutions which can only yield approximations to actual currents , it is nevertheless desirable to have accurate forms for the steady state activation and inactivation functions @xmath10 and @xmath11 , the time constants @xmath17 and @xmath18 , and the remaining parameters @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "our concern in this article is to describe and illustrate a novel and straighforward yet accurate method of estimating these quantities from voltage - clamp data .",
    "in order to isolate , currents for activation and inactivation protocols were obtained in 20 mm tea , as described in section 4.1 , for several identified serotonergic neurons of the rat dorsal raphe nucleus . in many cells",
    "the outward currents were clearly a mixture of components with different dynamical properties .",
    "in some cells , however , the currents decayed smoothly from an early peak to near zero and were apparently a manifestation of a single channel type , presumed to be uncontaminated .",
    "thus neither cocl@xmath19 nor cdcl@xmath19 was employed .",
    "one cell in particular , dr5 , with an apparently pure set of current traces was singled out for analysis .",
    "its activation current traces are shown in figure 1 .",
    "results for other cells with composite outward currents will be analyzed in future articles .",
    "the current traces of figure 1 were obtained in digitized form and the time constants @xmath12 and @xmath13 and the value of @xmath16 were estimated by the best fitting of the current traces to the analytical formula ( 6 ) .",
    "only two of these three parameters can be independently chosen by virtue of the constraint given by formula ( 7 ) for the time of occurrence @xmath20 of the maximum current , which rearranges to _",
    "h = ( e^ -1 ) the current was required to pass through the maximum point at @xmath21 and one other point on the trace , called @xmath22 .",
    "the value of @xmath23 was found to give excellent fits to the current traces .",
    "an example of the resulting curve with best fitting time constants @xmath12 and @xmath13 is shown in figure 2 along with the experimental current for a step from -120 mv to -20 mv .",
    "table 1 summarizes the data and estimates of time constants for cell dr5 , all of which quantities are required to estimate the three parameters @xmath14 ( conductance ) , @xmath24 and @xmath25 ( boltzmann parameters for activation ) . in this table @xmath26 is the maximal experimental current over time .",
    "activation experiments for in cell dr5    .maximal currents and estimated time constants in [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     @xmath27this study ; @xmath28belluzzi & sacchi ( 1988 ) ; @xmath29huguenard & mccormick ( 1992 ) ; @xmath30bekkers ( 2000 ) .    in order to construct a computational model of action potential generation in drn 5-ht neurons , such that the role of the various ionic components can be properly understood",
    ", it is desirable to have accurate knowledge of the activation and inactivation properties of the various ion currents , including that addressed here , .",
    "the need for considerable accuracy is made the more important because several components , including the low threshold t - type calcium and operate in overlapping ranges of potential . in this paper",
    "we have illustrated that the often - used procedure of finding activation functions @xmath31 by taking ratios of current to maximal current or conductance to maximal conductance may produce inaccurate results due to the fact that the quantity @xmath32 in ( 8) depends on the clamp voltage and does not cancel .",
    "not taking this into account can lead to substantial errors in the estimates of the parameters @xmath25 and @xmath24 .",
    "inactivation functions , however , do not have such a complication and can be estimated in the usual way .    l - type calcium currents , particularly through channels , have been found to sometimes play a role in pacemaker activity in neurons and cardiac cells ( koschak et al . , 2003 ; putzier et al .",
    ", 2009 ; marcantoni et al . , 2010 ) .",
    "however , in drn 5-ht cells , there is only a small ( about 4% of total @xmath33 ) contribution from l - type calcium currents ( penington et al . , 1991 ) so it is yet to be determined what role these play in the pacemaking activity .",
    "these latter results were , however , obtained in dissociated cells .",
    "burlhis and aghajanian ( 1987 ) hypothesized that the low threshold calcium t - type current played a key role in pacemaking and segal ( 1985 ) proposed that was also important .",
    "however , considering the fact that the resting potential for these cells is about -60 mv and that threshold for spiking is about -50 mv , and judging by the curves for @xmath34 and @xmath35 in figure 4 , it is likely that is only important during the spike itself and not between the commencement of the afterhyperpolarization and the next spike , probably implying a lesser role for in pacemaking as it tends to be switched off during the greater part of the isi .",
    "we will explore by means of a computational model the ionic basis of the mechanisms of pacemaking in drn 5-ht cells in future articles .",
    "finally we note that the results obtained here for @xmath0 and the time constants bear a resemblance to those given in gutman et al .",
    "( 2005 ) for the transient a - type channels @xmath36 ( @xmath37 mv , @xmath38 mv , @xmath39 ms , and two other @xmath13 values ) .",
    "this contrasts with the finding by bekkers ( 2000 ) who suggested that in rat layer 5 cortical pyramidal cells , was carried by @xmath40 channels , which accounts for their smaller time constants of inactivation ( gutman et al . , 2005 ) .",
    "data of the kind analyzed in this paper were obtained from 2 month - old male sprague - dawley rats that were anesthetized with halothane and then decapitated with a small animal guillotine in accordance with our local animal care and use committee regulations .",
    "three coronal slices ( 500 @xmath41 m ) through the brain stem at the level of the drn were prepared using a `` vibroslice '' in a manner that has previously been described ( yao et al . , 2010 ) .",
    "pieces of tissue containing the drn were then incubated in a pipes buffer solution containing 0.2 mg / ml trypsin ( sigma type xi ) under pure oxygen for 120 min .",
    "the tissue was then triturated in dulbecco s modified eagle s medium to yield individual neuronal cell bodies with vestigial processes .",
    "recording was carried out at room temperature , 20@xmath42c-25@xmath42c .",
    "cells recorded from had diameters of about 20 @xmath41 m .",
    "steinbusch et al .",
    "( 1981 ) showed using immunohistochemistry that most of the cells in a thin raphe slice with a soma diameter greater than 20 @xmath41 m contain 5-ht while the smaller cells were largely gabaergic interneurons . using a method similar to that of yamamoto et al .",
    "( 1981 ) , we also found that the proportion of isolated cells with diameters larger than 20 @xmath41 m that stain for 5-ht , was greater than 85% , and a similar percentage responded to serotonin .",
    "the cells were voltage - clamped using a switching voltage clamp amplifier ( axoclamp 2a ) and a single patch pipette in the whole - cell configuration ( hamill et al . , 1981 ) .",
    "pipettes pulled from thick - walled borosilicate glass ( resistance from 5 - 7 m@xmath43 ) allowed a switching frequency of 8 - 13 khz with a 30% duty cycle .",
    "the seal resistance measured by the voltage response to a 50 pa step of current was often greater than 5 g@xmath43 ) .",
    "the voltage - clamp data were filtered at 1 khz and digitized for storage at 16 bits , or experiments were run online with a pc and a ced 1401 interface .",
    "the external saline was designed to isolate potassium currents and contained : outside the cell ttx 0.2 @xmath41 m and in mm nacl 147 , kcl 2.5 , cacl@xmath19 2 , mgcl@xmath19 2 , glucose 10 , hepes 20 , ph 7.3 . inside : k@xmath44 gluconate 84 , mgatp 2 , kcl 38 , egta - koh 11 , hepes 10 , cacl@xmath19 1 , ph 7.3 .",
    "the total [ k@xmath44 ] inside was 155 mm ( since 33 mm is added to make the salt of egta ) .",
    "the osmolarity was adjusted with sucrose so that the pipette solution was 10 mosm hypoosmotic to the bath solution .",
    "drugs were either dissolved in the extracellular solution and added to the perfusate or applied by diffusion from a patch pipette ( tip 15 @xmath41 m ) lowered close to the cell ( 50 @xmath41 m and then removed from the bath ) . as a control ,",
    "the same procedure was carried out without addition of the drug to the application pipette ; this did not affect . in some cells , to investigate any influence of currents on either 2 mm cocl@xmath19 or 20 @xmath41 m cdcl@xmath19",
    "was added to the bath by a pipette placed near the cell .",
    "this sometimes changed the magnitude of @xmath46 but had little effect on its time course .",
    "suppose that in a voltage clamp experiment the voltage is , after equilibration at a voltage @xmath47 , suddenly clamped at the new voltage @xmath48 .",
    "then , assuming a current of the form of equation ( 2 ) , according to the standard hodgkin - huxley ( 1952 ) theory , the current at time @xmath8 after the switch to @xmath48 is i(t ; v_0 , v_1 ) = ( v_1-v_rev ) [ m_1 - ( m_1-m_0 ) e^-t/_m ] ^p [ h_1 - ( h_1-h_0 ) e^-t/_h ] , where we have employed the abbreviations @xmath49 for the activation , @xmath50 for the inactivation and @xmath51 for the time constants .      in activation eperiments",
    "there is a step up from a relatively hyperpolarized state @xmath47 to several more depolarized states @xmath48 so that one usually assumes that @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "this gives the simplified expression for the current i(t ; v_1 ) = ( v_1-v_rev)[m_(v_1 ) ( 1- e^-t/_m)]^p e^-t/_h .",
    "finding the maximum by differentiation yields the time at which the maximum occurs as t_max(v_1 ) = _ m ( 1 + ) and its value as i_max(v_1 ) = ( v_1-v_rev)m^p_(v_1)f_p ( ) where f_p ( ) = and where @xmath54 , which depends on @xmath48 , is defined as ( v_1)=. since @xmath48 is here considered a variable , the time course of the current changes as @xmath48 varies . by rearrangement",
    "the steady state activation is given by    m_(v_1 ) = ( ) ^    if it is known that for some ( usually well - depolarized ) state @xmath55 one has @xmath56 ( but note that this can only ever be approximately true as @xmath0 can only approach unity asymptotically ) then the maximal conductance @xmath14 can be estimated from voltage clamp experiments from = . once @xmath14 is known then ( 11 ) can be used to find @xmath57 for various @xmath48 because all remaining quantities , @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 are known .",
    "in summary , the steps to find the activation function @xmath61 are :    \\(a ) from the time course of the current find the maximum current and its time of occurrence for a given @xmath48    \\(b ) estimate the time constants @xmath62 and @xmath63 and the value of @xmath16 .",
    "\\(c ) hence find @xmath64 and also @xmath60 .",
    "\\(d ) using a suitably highly depolarized state @xmath55 estimate @xmath14 according to ( 12 ) .",
    "\\(e ) hence estimate @xmath61 at various @xmath9 below @xmath65 .",
    "\\(f ) find the best fitting boltzmann curve passing through the values obtained .",
    "however , the formulas ( 6)-(8 ) were derived on the assumption that @xmath66 and this will usually be valid for @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is below the half - activation potential @xmath24 .",
    "this means that the half - activation function @xmath61 can be obtained accurately for @xmath69 , and thus by symmetry for @xmath70 .",
    "another approach is as follows .",
    "if @xmath65 is not known or is uncertain , then least squares estimates can be made as follows .",
    "it is assumed that m_(v ) = is the steady state activation function .",
    "then one may estimate @xmath14 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 by minimizing the sum of squares of the differences between experimentally obtained maxima of the current at various @xmath71 and the values given by formula ( 8)      here is given a brief description of the 4 methods employed to estimate the parameters of @xmath61 and @xmath14 given in table 2 . + * method a * + having estimated the values of the time constants @xmath72 and @xmath73 and the power @xmath16 as described in the text , experimental maximum currents at various @xmath71 are compared with those obtained from formula ( 8) i_max(v_i ) = ( v_i - v_rev)m^p_(v_i)f_p ( ) with @xmath54 evaluated at @xmath71 .",
    "thus the parameters @xmath14 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are estimated by least squares .",
    "+ * method b * + it is assumed that @xmath74 , with @xmath75 mv in the present example , so that @xmath14 is given directly by equation ( 12 ) . then @xmath76 can be obtained for various @xmath71 uising equation ( 11 ) . a best fitting boltzmann is then obtained for the various vaules of @xmath76 .",
    "+ * method c * + the experimental values of the maximum currents ( over time ) @xmath77 at each test voltage @xmath71 are divided by @xmath78 to give corresponding conductances @xmath79 .",
    "the conductances @xmath79 are assumed ( from equation ( 8) without the correction factor ) to be given by g_i(v_i ) = m^p_(v_i ) . with m_(v ) = the parameters @xmath14 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 ( and possibly @xmath16 if not already known ) are estimated by least squares fitting of the experimental @xmath80 values to the predicted ones , without any assumption on @xmath65 ( normalization ) . + * method d * + the same procedure is carried out as in method c , but the @xmath80 values are divided by the maximum value @xmath81 , assumed to occur at @xmath65 ( -20 mv in the above ) , to give the normalized values = .",
    "then since @xmath82 there are only two parameters @xmath24 and @xmath25 to estimate with a best fitting boltzmann curve .",
    "the maximal conductance @xmath83 can be obtained as = .",
    "if there is no inactivation in the course of the clamp experiment then the maxiumum current will be the asymptotic value i_max(v_1 ) = ( v_1-v_rev)m^p_(v_1 ) .",
    "so , with @xmath65 as above , @xmath14 is again given by ( 18 ) , and it is straightforward to obtain the required activation function from the remaining @xmath58 measurements .      here",
    "steps are made from a number of relatively hyperpolarized states @xmath47 to a fixed relatively depolarized state @xmath48 .",
    "it is usually assumed that @xmath84 and @xmath53 , so that the current is approximately i(t ; v_0 , v_1 ) = ( v_1-v_rev)m^p_(v_1)h_(v_0 ) ( 1-e^-t/_m)^p e^-t/_h . here",
    "the time course of the current ( but not its magnitude ) is the same for all @xmath47 .",
    "the time of occurrence of the maximum @xmath85 of @xmath86 is again given by ( 7 ) but the value of the maximum is now i_max(v_0,v_1 ) = ( v_1-v_rev)m^p_(v_1)h_(v_0)f_p ( ) .    assuming that @xmath14 has already been estimated and that @xmath87 is such that @xmath74 , then the inactivation function can be found at @xmath47 from h_(v_0 ) = i_max(v_0,v^ * ) ( v^*-v_rev ) f_p((v^ * ) ) it can be seen that normalizing the currents by dividing by the maximum of the @xmath58 gives a reasonable estimate of the steady state inactivation function .",
