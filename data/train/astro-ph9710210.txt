    "the gunn - peterson limit implies that the igm was reionized and reheated by @xmath0 , by energy released by objects which previously condensed out of the background and formed stars , agns or some other sources .",
    "this exerted a negative feedback on the rate of collapse of gas out of the background igm by raising the jeans mass there and affected the appearance and evolution of the igm and the structure which subsequently collapsed out of it .",
    "how early could starlight have reionized the igm ?",
    "shapiro and giroux attempted to answer this question by solving linear equations for the growth of density fluctuations in the igm and using a press - schechter approach to determine the baryon fraction which had collapsed out at any epoch , releasing energy to reheat and reionize the igm , coupled to a detailed numerical evolution of the thermal and ionization balance of a coarse - grained , spatially - averaged igm and the equation of radiative transfer for the ionizing radiation background , including the opacity of the observed quasar absorption line gas , as described in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the maximum - possible efficiency was assumed for energy release by massive stars , which form at a rate proportional to the rate of collapse of baryons out of the igm and stop forming when they have enriched the collapsed fraction with a solar abundance of heavy elements , in a flat , cobe - normalized , standard cdm model ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) .",
    "the igm was found to reheat by @xmath4 to @xmath5 when the collapsed baryon fraction was only @xmath6 , while the h atom ionization breakthrough was @xmath7 when @xmath8 , implying a net metallicity averaged over all baryons in the universe at these epochs equal to these values of @xmath9 , in solar units @xcite .",
    "since the cobe - normalization is almost twice that typically assumed in recent simulations of the lyman alpha forest and galaxy formation , our results are _ conservative _ in the sense of maximizing @xmath10 ; a lower initial amplitude would make reionization and reheating occur a little later than this . in my talk ,",
    "i also presented asph simulations by shapiro and martel which demonstrated that global reheating can significantly affect the small - scale structure formation responsible for quasar absorption line gas(@xcite,@xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "this contribution is too brief to present that material , but i refer the reader to @xcite for a summary . here",
    "we will focus , instead , on new work on the effects of photoionization .",
    "the first sources of ionizing radiation which turned on in the neutral ( i.e. postrecombination ) igm prior to @xmath0 resulted in isolated , expanding h  ii regions .",
    "the expansion and eventual overlap of the weak , r - type cosmological ionization fronts bounding these h  ii regions was previously described analytically by treating the igm as a uniform , cosmologically expanding gas ( @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "the density fluctuations required to explain galaxy formation and the lyman alpha forest were accounted for approximately by treating the igm as `` clumpy , '' with a universal clumping factor . that approximation is correct in the limit in which the clumps are either too small to `` self - shield '' or else constitute only a small fraction of the total mass inside the hii region .",
    "it does not , however , address the possible dynamical consequences for the clumps , themselves , of the passage of i - fronts . in what follows ,",
    "we present the first simulations of the gas dynamics and radiative transfer of an intergalactic cloud overtaken by a cosmological i - front .",
    "the fate of this cloud depends fundamentally on whether or not it can shield itself against the incident radiation from the external source responsible for the intergalactic i - front .",
    "if the cloud size exceeds the `` strmgren length '' ( the length of a column of gas within which the unshielded arrival rate of ionizing photons just balances the total recombination rate ) , it can trap the i - front . in that case , the weak r - type i - front which swept into the cloud initially , moving supersonically with respect to gas both ahead and behind , decelerates to the sound speed of the ionized gas before it can exit the cloud , thereby becoming a weak , d - type front preceded by a shock .",
    "typically , the side of the cloud which faces the radiation source expels a supersonic wind which causes the remaining cloud material to be accelerated away from the source by the so - called `` rocket effect '' as the cloud photoevaporates ( cf.@xcite ) . for a uniform gas of h density @xmath11 , located a distance @xmath12 ( in mpc ) from a uv source emitting @xmath13 ionizing photons per second ( in units of @xmath14 ) ,",
    "the strmgren length is only @xmath15 .",
    "gas bound to dark matter halos whose virial temperature is less than @xmath16 will photoevaporate unimpeded by gravity . for larger halos gravity",
    "competes with the effects of photoevaporation .    as a first study of these important effects",
    ", we have simulated the photoevaporation of a uniform , spherical , neutral , intergalactic cloud of gas mass @xmath17 , radius @xmath18 , density @xmath19 and @xmath20 , in which self - gravity is unimportant , located @xmath21 from a quasar with emission spectrum @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) and @xmath24 , initially in pressure balance with an ambient igm of density @xmath25 which at time @xmath26 has just been photoionized by the passage of the intergalactic r - type i - front generated when the quasar turned on .",
    "apart from h and he , the cloud also contains heavy elements at @xmath27 times the solar abundance .",
    "our simulations in 2d , axisymmetry use an eulerian hydro code ( called coral ) , with adaptive mesh refinement and a riemann solver based on the van  leer flux - splitting algorithm , which solves nonequilibrium ionization rate equations ( for h , he , c , n , o , ne , and  s ) and includes an explicit treatment of radiative transfer which takes account of bound - free opacity of h and he ( @xcite,@xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "our grid size in @xmath28 was @xmath29  cells ( fully refined ) .",
    "figure  1 shows the structure of the cloud @xmath30 after it was overtaken by the quasar s i - front as it sweeps past the cloud in the igm .",
    "since @xmath31 initially , the cloud traps the i - front , as described above , and drives a supersonic wind from the surface facing the quasar .",
    "it takes more than @xmath32 to evaporate the cloud , accelerating it to 10 s of @xmath33 in the process .",
    "figure  2 shows selected observable diagnostics , including column densities of h  i , he  i and ii seen along the symmetry axis at different times and the spatial variation of the relative abundances of selected metal ions at @xmath30 .",
    "the cloud starts as a high - column - density lyman limit absorber , but ends with the h  i column density of a lyman alpha forest cloud , with @xmath34/[h\\,i]\\sim10 ^ 2 $ ] and metal ions .",
