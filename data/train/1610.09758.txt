    "the syk model @xcite is a quantum mechanical model of fermions with random couplings .",
    "the most widely studied version of the model has @xmath1 real fermions @xmath2 , @xmath3 , with @xmath4-fold random couplings , for some even integer @xmath5 .",
    "the model can be described by the action [ syk ] i = t ( _ i_i _ i -i^q/2j_i_1i_2  i_q _ i_1_i_2  _i_q ) . here the couplings are gaussian random variables . if we write @xmath6 for a multi - index @xmath7 , the the @xmath8",
    "are drawn from a gaussian ensemble with variance [ variance]j_i j_i=_ii , for some constant @xmath9 .",
    "the model is solvable in the limit of large @xmath1 , fixed @xmath9 by a saddle point method that reflects the fact that the dominant feynman diagrams in this limit have a simple type .",
    "they can be generated by an iterative procedure that is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ iteration ] . at each stage of the iteration ,",
    "one takes a propagator ( fig [ iteration](a ) ) and replaces it by the diagram of fig .",
    "[ iteration](b ) .",
    "this can be done any number of times to generate more complicated diagrams .",
    "for example , at the second step of the iteration , one can generate the diagram of fig .",
    "[ iteration](c ) .    a model of this general type",
    "was formulated many years ago @xcite to describe a spin - fluid state , but the subject has attracted renewed interest because of the suggestion @xcite that the large @xmath1 limit of the model is dual to a black hole in an emergent @xmath10-dimensional spacetime .",
    "this type of model was first discussed in relation to holographic duality in @xcite . for recent work ,",
    ".    one question that one might ask about the syk model is whether , instead of formulating it as a model with quenched disorder , one can find similar physics in a more conventional large @xmath1 limit .",
    "one idea might be to interpret the couplings @xmath8 as quantum variables with very slow dynamics , rather than random constants . even if it works , this has the drawback that the thermodynamic entropy of the @xmath8 ( roughly @xmath11 bosonic variables ) will overwhelm that of the @xmath2 ( @xmath1 fermionic variables ) .",
    "the present paper is devoted to another approach that does not have this drawback .",
    "in fact , there is an already known class of `` tensor models '' whose large @xmath1 limits are governed by precisely the same feynman diagrams that dominate the large @xmath1 limit of the syk model .",
    "there have been many papers on this subject , a sampling being @xcite . in this literature ,",
    "the dominant graphs are called `` melons '' or `` melonic graphs . ''",
    "a convenient reference is @xcite .",
    "the construction of tensor models was motivated by the idea of generalizing to higher dimensions the familiar relation of matrix models to random two - dimensional geometries .",
    "limit similar to that of the syk model .",
    "see for example @xcite . ] in that application , the dimension @xmath12 is related to the order @xmath4 of the syk interactions by @xmath13 .",
    "the status of this program is unclear , since it is not clear that the rather special feynman diagrams that are generated by the procedure summarized in fig .",
    "[ iteration ] describe a useful class of random @xmath12-geometries .",
    "but because the tensor models are governed in the large @xmath1 limit by the same feynman diagrams as the syk model , they do give a framework to eliminate the quenched disorder of the syk model in favor of a more standard large @xmath1 limit .    .",
    "figures are drawn for @xmath14 ( quartic vertices ) . at each step of the process",
    ", one replaces a propagator ( part ( a ) ) with the two - loop diagram of part ( b ) .",
    "for example , after another iteration , one can generate the four - loop diagram of part ( c).,width=432 ]    it is not entirely clear that this is helpful , but there are at least two reasons that it might be .",
    "first , the average of a quantum system over quenched disorder is not really a quantum system , so the reliance on quenched disorder might make it difficult to apply the syk model to some subtle questions about black holes . second , in the syk model , certain bilinear expressions in the @xmath2 , which roughly speaking are `` singlets '' in a disorder - averaged sense , appear to have natural duals in the emergent two - dimensional world .",
    "but it is not clear that the @xmath1 fields @xmath2 themselves have a natural interpretation of that sort . at any rate ,",
    "their analogs do not have bulk duals in better - understood examples of gauge / gravity duality .",
    "the tensor models that mimic the syk model can be chosen , as we will do in section [ themodel ] , to have a global symmetry group @xmath15 whose dimension is relatively large , but still much less than @xmath1 .",
    "gauging the @xmath15 symmetry leaves as gauge - invariant operators the singlet operators that are relevant in the gravitational dual description , but eliminates the elementary fermion fields themselves .",
    "but because the dimension of @xmath15 is much less than @xmath1 , gauging the symmetry does not significantly affect the thermodynamics of the model when @xmath1 is large .    in section [ themodel ] ,",
    "we describe a variant of the syk model that has a similar large @xmath1 limit but without quenched disorder . in doing this ,",
    "we adapt and modify the construction described in @xcite ( and other papers cited above ) in minor ways .",
    "our fields are fermion fields in @xmath16 spacetime dimensions rather than boson fields in 0 dimensions .",
    "also , we construct a simple model with a relatively large amount of symmetry ( which could be gauged ) and do not discuss some of the more generic models that have been considered in the literature .",
    "none of this affects the counting of powers of @xmath1 in feynman diagrams . as in @xcite and many subsequent papers , we use real fermion fields . as a result ,",
    "the index loops we encounter are unoriented and certain two - manifolds that arise may be unorientable .",
    "we could instead use complex fermion fields as in @xcite ; then as in @xcite , the index loops and two - manifolds will be oriented .    in section [ somedetails ] , following @xcite , we sketch the proof that the feynman diagrams that survive in the large @xmath1 limit of the tensor model are precisely those of the syk model .",
    "the @xmath17 corrections are different , though the significance of the difference is not clear .",
    "the model will be constructed with @xmath18 real fermion fields @xmath19 .",
    "each will have @xmath20 real components , for some integer @xmath0 , so the total number of real fermion fields will be @xmath21 .    for each @xmath22 , the field @xmath23 will transform in a real irreducible representation of a symmetry group @xmath15 , as follows .",
    "first of all , for each unordered pair @xmath24 of distinct elements of the finite set @xmath25 , we introduce a copy @xmath26 of the group @xmath27 .",
    "since the pair @xmath24 is unordered , we do not distinguish @xmath26 from @xmath28 .",
    "the full symmetry group of the model is then a product [ torf]g_0=_a < bg_ab(n)^d(d+1)/2 , up to a discrete quotient that we consider in a moment .    for each @xmath22",
    ", we now declare that @xmath23 transforms as the tensor product of the vector representations of @xmath26 for every @xmath29 , and transforms trivially under @xmath30 if @xmath31 . the vector representation of @xmath26 is @xmath0-dimensional , and there are @xmath12 groups @xmath26 with @xmath29 , so @xmath23 has @xmath20 real components , as stated above . with this choice for the fermion representation ,",
    "a certain discrete subgroup of @xmath32 acts trivially .",
    "the center of @xmath27 is @xmath33 , acting by sign change on the vector representation , so the center of @xmath32 is @xmath34",
    ". a certain subgroup @xmath35 acts trivially on all the @xmath23 , so the group that will be a faithfully acting symmetry group of the theory is [ symgr]g = g_0/_2^(d-2)(d+1)/2 .",
    "we now replace the syk action with [ nsyk ] i = t ( _ i_i _ i -i^q/2j _ 0_1  _d ) , with a real coupling parameter @xmath36 .",
    "the meaning of the expression @xmath37 is as follows . for each @xmath38 , precisely two of these fields , namely @xmath23 and @xmath39 , transform as vectors under @xmath26 . contracting the vector indices of @xmath26 for each pair @xmath24 , we arrive at a @xmath15-invariant that we denote for brevity as @xmath37 .",
    "note that the hamiltonian of the theory is @xmath40 .",
    "this hamiltonian is odd under a _ unitary _ transformation that changes the sign of one of the @xmath23 .",
    "( for a discussion of hamiltonians with the unusual property of being odd under a unitary symmetry , see @xcite . )",
    "it is observed in @xcite that the hamiltonian of the syk model has this property on a statistical basis .",
    "permutations of the @xmath23 accompanied by corresponding permutations of the @xmath26 are global symmetres ( an odd permutation must be accompanied by a sign change of one of the @xmath23 ) .",
    "now we describe some basic properties of feynman diagrams of this theory . in fig .",
    "[ comparison ] , we depict in two different ways the basic feynman vertex of the theory for @xmath41 or @xmath14 . in part",
    "( a ) , it is simply shown as a basic quartic vertex for four fields @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 .",
    "propagation of one of these fields is represented as usual by a `` line '' in the feynman graph . in part ( b ) , we take note of the fact that each of the @xmath23 is a trifundamental of a certain product of three copies of @xmath27 , and so can be considered to carry three @xmath0-valued `` indices . ''",
    "accordingly , we resolve each `` line '' in part ( a ) into three `` strands '' in part ( b ) .",
    "for example , a line of type 0 is resolved into strands of type 01 , 02 , and 03 , reflecting the fact that @xmath42 transforms as a trifundamental of @xmath46 . then to construct the feynman vertex",
    ", we connect all of the strands in the only way consistent with their labeling , arriving at the figure .     or @xmath41 ) .",
    "in ( a ) , the vertex is drawn as a simple quartic vertex with external lines labeled @xmath47 , or 3 . in ( b ) , each line is resolved into three `` strands , '' representing how the `` indices '' of a field transform under a symmetry group .",
    "for example , the field @xmath42 is a trifundamental of @xmath46 , so it is represented with three strands labeled @xmath48 @xmath49 , and @xmath50 .",
    "the vertex is constructed by connecting these strands in the only way consistent with their labeling .",
    "it can be visualized as a tetrahedron.,width=480 ]     limit.,width=480 ]    hopefully the reader can visualize fig .",
    "[ vertex](b ) as representing a tetrahedron , with each vertex labeled by an index @xmath51 and the edge connecting vertices @xmath22 and @xmath52 labeled as @xmath53 .",
    "this interpretation of the vertex as a tetrahedron is part of the relationship of the tensor models described in @xcite ( for @xmath41 ) with three - geometries . for larger @xmath12 ,",
    "the tetrahedron is replaced by a @xmath12-simplex and the graphs can be interpreted as @xmath12-geometries . however , as noted in the introduction , the dominant feynman diagrams , for large @xmath0 , correspond to a fairly special class of @xmath12-geometries .",
    "the relation to the syk model gives an alternative motivation to consider this class of model .",
    "now we make some preliminary remarks on the large @xmath0 limit , or equivalently the large @xmath1 limit .",
    "to count powers of @xmath0 in a feynman diagram , it is very convenient to think about the fact that each line in the diagram represents @xmath12 strands , as in fig .",
    "[ vertex](b ) .",
    "the strands can form closed loops and , as in the more familiar matrix models , such a closed loop gives a factor of @xmath0 .",
    "a difference from matrix models is that there are different kinds of closed loops .",
    "a strand may be of type @xmath53 for any unordered pair @xmath54 and hence there are altogether @xmath55 distinct kinds of strand .",
    "we let @xmath56 be the number of closed loops made of strands of type @xmath53 , and [ zelf]=_a < b_ab . in @xcite",
    ", @xmath56 is called the number of faces of type @xmath53 and @xmath57 the total number of faces .",
    "( the rationale for this terminology is that if one glues in a disc whose boundary is a closed strand of type @xmath53 , one gets a two - dimensional `` face '' of some triangulated geometry . )",
    "summing over index loops will give a factor of [ welf]n^=_a < bn^_ab .",
    "let us work this out in some simple examples .",
    "some simple feynman diagrams for @xmath41 are drawn in fig .",
    "[ comparison ] .",
    "the diagrams are drawn in the standard way , representing the propagation of one of the @xmath23 by a line and not resolving the lines into strands .",
    "the reason is that diagrams soon become rather complicated if drawn in terms of strands . with a little practice",
    ", one can easily count powers of @xmath0 without drawing the strands .",
    "every closed loop in the graph that only contains lines of type @xmath22 or @xmath52 will , when resolved in strands , give a closed strand of type @xmath53 .",
    "this is the only source of closed strands of this type , so @xmath56 is just the number of closed loops that can be drawn in the graph using only lines labeled @xmath22 or @xmath52 .",
    "we call these loops of type @xmath53 .",
    "( loops of type @xmath53 are always disjoint , because of the form of the interaction vertex . ) for example , in fig .",
    "[ comparison](a ) one can form a single closed loop of type @xmath58 , @xmath59 , or @xmath60 , and none of type @xmath61 for any @xmath22 .",
    "so for this diagram , @xmath62 .",
    "thus the diagram is proportional to @xmath63 .",
    "so to ensure a large @xmath0 limit , we must take [ pelf ] j= for some constant @xmath9 .",
    "once we scale the coupling with @xmath0 so that fig .",
    "[ comparison](a ) has a large @xmath0 limit , it is almost immediate that any diagram made by the iterative procedure of fig .",
    "[ iteration ] likewise has a large @xmath0 limit . however , other diagrams vanish for large @xmath0 . postponing a systematic explanation for section [ somedetails ] ,",
    "we first examine in fig .",
    "[ comparison](b ) a simple diagram that is not generated by the iterative procedure .",
    "this diagram has one closed loop of type 01 , one of type 23 , one of type 12 , and one of type 13 . with four vertices ,",
    "this diagram is of order @xmath64 .",
    "thus the diagram is subleading in the large @xmath0 or equivalently the large @xmath1 limit .",
    "however , the @xmath65 corrections are different in this model from what they are in the syk model , as the expansion in that model is an expansion in integer powers of @xmath17 .",
    "the examples we have considered were contributions to the two - point function . in a similar way",
    ", we can consider vacuum diagrams .",
    "in free field theory , we would just have the one - loop diagram of fig .",
    "[ basic](a ) . with @xmath1 fermion fields",
    ", it makes a contribution of order @xmath1 .",
    "applying once the usual iterative step of fig .",
    "[ iteration ] , we get the first nontrivial contribution to the vacuum amplitude in fig .",
    "[ basic](b ) .",
    "it is of order @xmath66 and thus is again of order @xmath1 for large @xmath1 .",
    "another iterative step can lead , for example , to the diagram of fig .",
    "[ vacuum ] , which is of order @xmath67 . in general , the leading contributions to the vacuum amplitude are generated by the iterative procedure and are of order @xmath1 .     to the one - loop diagram in ( a).,width=384 ]     limit.,width=336 ]",
    "following @xcite , we will explain how to analyze the large @xmath0 behavior of the perturbative expansion in a model of this kind .",
    "( we describe only the leading behavior .",
    "it is not clear how difficult it is to systematically describe the diagrams that arise in each order in @xmath65 . )",
    "it does not matter very much whether we study the large @xmath0 limit for vacuum diagrams or for correlation functions , since leading order contributions to the @xmath68-point function are made by `` cutting '' @xmath69 lines in a diagram that makes a leading order contribution to the vacuum amplitude .",
    "thus , to understand the large @xmath0 behavior of the perturbation expansion , it essentially suffices to consider the vacuum amplitude .",
    "this will give a minor simplification in the following .",
    "let @xmath70 be an unoriented cyclic ordering of the set @xmath25 ; the term `` unoriented '' means that two cyclic orderings that differ by a mirror reflection are considered equivalent .",
    "given such a @xmath71 , we can reduce any feynman graph @xmath72 , such as the graph of fig .",
    "[ vacuum ] , to the graph of a more familiar matrix model , as follows .",
    "each line in @xmath72 of type @xmath73 ( for some @xmath74 ) can be resolved in strands of type @xmath75 for all @xmath76 , making @xmath12 strands in all . in the abstract",
    ", there is no natural way to pick just 2 of the strands associated to a given line .",
    "however , once we are given the cyclic arrangement @xmath77 , each label @xmath73 has the two `` neighbors '' @xmath78 and @xmath79 . for each line of type @xmath73 , we remember only the two strands of type @xmath80 and forget the others .",
    "when in this way we keep only two strands for each line in the graph , the lines we keep always meet smoothly at vertices and @xmath72 becomes a ribbon graph or fatgraph of a matrix model .",
    "( this will be a matrix model with unoriented index loops , as our fields are real and the individual strands are unoriented . ) in the fashion familiar from matrix models , by gluing in discs whose boundaries are the closed index loops of type @xmath81 ( for all @xmath74 ) , we make a closed two - manifold that we will call @xmath82 , since it depends on @xmath71",
    ".    an important fact will be that the euler characteristic of @xmath82 , which we denote @xmath83 , can be no larger than @xmath84 .",

    ", we consider the diagram of fig .",
    "[ vacuum ] and take @xmath89 .",
    "this means that we are supposed to keep strands of type @xmath90 for any @xmath74 .",

    "let @xmath91 and @xmath92 be the number of vertices and edges in the graph @xmath72 .",
    "these do not depend on the choice of @xmath71 .",
    "however , the number of faces ( discs that are glued in when we construct @xmath82 ) does depend on @xmath71 .",

    "the euler characteristic of @xmath82 is [ chiz]_=v_0-v_1+v_2 , = -()v_0+_i _ a_i a_i+1 . from this formula and ( [ zegree ] )",
    ", we can work out a useful formula for @xmath97 : [ pliz]()=d+v_0 - .",

    "[ vacuum ]  with @xmath100 .",
    "it remains then to understand which graphs do have @xmath100 .",
    "the basic statement here ( lemma 1 in @xcite ) is that any graph with @xmath100 has a face of some type @xmath53 with only two vertices ( in other words , some strand of type @xmath53 forms a closed loop after passing through only two vertices ; for example , in fig .",
