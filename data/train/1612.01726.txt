    "the stability of relativistic stars is a longstanding problem  @xcite .",
    "it is well known that relativistic stars exhibit some special properties , related to their structure , in comparison with the newtonian ones  @xcite .",
    "one of these properties , is the condition for stable configurations .",
    "there are various methods to examine the stability of a relativistic star  @xcite . in the present work we will employ the variational method which has been developed by chandrasekhar  @xcite .",
    "in particular , we will examine the stability of three analytical solutions of the einstein s field equation for a spherical relativistic fluid .",
    "these solutions are suitable to describe normal neutron stars and in general very compact objects .",
    "they have the specific property that the derived density and pressure of the fluid interior vanishes at the surface .",
    "these solutions are the tolman vii  @xcite , the buchdahl  @xcite and the nariai iv  @xcite .",
    "it has been remarked firstly by tolman  @xcite that the static character of an analytical solution is self sufficient to assure that the solution describes a possible state of equilibrium for a fluid , but is not sufficient to tell us if the state of equilibrium would be stable towards disturbances .",
    "in addition , the question of stability is important since an unstable solution can not be able to describe a physically permanent state and consequently is not of physical interest .",
    "it is worth to pointing out that it is more natural to use a realistic equation of state of the fluid interior in order to solve the einstein s field equations .",
    "it has been remarked also by tolman  @xcite , that by adopting a mathematically instead of a physically motivated method to solve the field equation may lead to not physically interesting solutions . however , this method has the advantage that by having an explicit solution it then becomes easier to examine the implied physics .",
    "we should remark that the analytical solutions are _ source _ of infinite number of equations of state ( plausible or not ) .",
    "consequently , they can be used extensively , in order to introduce and to establish some universal approximations . moreover , and this is one of the motivation of the present work , we investigate the possibility , using physical reliable analytical solutions , to introduce some general constraints related with the internal structure and the stability of relativistic objects .",
    "the three mentioned solutions have been extensively employed in the literature for the study of very compact objects including mainly neutron stars  @xcite . in particular , the tolman vii solution is the most popular one , with applications in various problems related to very compact object ( in contradiction with the tolman s statement  @xcite that this solution , due to the complicate dependence of the pressure on the distance @xmath1 , is not a convenient one for physical consideration ) .",
    "the stability of the tolman vii solution has been examined by negi  @xcite .",
    "it was found that the solution is stable for a large range of the compactness parameter @xmath2 .",
    "the buchdahl solution has been also employed in the literature in related studies and is a subject of relevant textbooks and review papers  @xcite .",
    "however , there is a contradiction in the literature concerning the stability of the buchdahl solution .",
    "firstly , knutsen  @xcite found out that this solution is unstable .",
    "later on , negi  @xcite re - examined the instability of the this solution .",
    "he found that it remains stable for a large range of the compactness parameter .",
    "the nariai iv solution is the more complicated one , compared to the previous ones and is used less in the literature .",
    "the stability of narai iv solution , according to our knowledge , has never been examined in the past .",
    "the adiabatic index is an important parameter which characterizes the stiffness of the equation of states at a given density .",
    "the instability criterion of chandrasekhar  @xcite , which is an elegant interlay between the macroscopic attractive gravitation field and the microscopic repulsive nuclear forces , strongly depends on the adiabatic index . in the present work",
    "we intend to probe the possibility to impose constraints on the neutron star equation of state via the instability condition of chandrasekhar .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in section  2",
    "we review briefly the einstein s field equations while in section   3 we present the chandrasekhar instability criterion .",
    "section  4 is dedicated to the adiabatic index and in section  5 we present in detail the analytical solutions .",
    "the results are presented and discussed in section  6 and section  7 contains the concluding remarks of the study .",
    "for a static spherical symmetric system , the metric can be written as follow  @xcite @xmath3 the energy density distribution @xmath4 and the local pressure @xmath5 are related to the metric functions @xmath6 and @xmath7 as  @xcite @xmath8 @xmath9 @xmath10 where derivatives with respect to the radius are denoted by @xmath11 .",
    "the mechanical equilibrium of the star matter is determined by the three equations together with the equation of state @xmath12 of the fluid .",
    "the combination of eqs .",
    "( [ gre-2 ] ) , ( [ gre-3 ] ) and ( [ gre-4 ] ) leads to the well known tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff ( tov ) equations  @xcite @xmath13 @xmath14 it is most natural to solve numerically the tov equation , by introducing an equation of state describing the relation between pressure and density expected to describe the fluid interior .",
    "the other possibility , is to try to find out analytical solutions of the tov equation with the risk of obtaining solutions without physical interest  @xcite .",
    "actually , there are hundreds of analytical solutions of tov equations  @xcite .",
    "however , just few of them are of physical interest .",
    "moreover , there are only three that satisfy the criteria that the pressure and energy density vanish on the surface of the star and also that they both decrease monotonically with increasing radius .",
    "these three solutions are the tolman vii , the buchdahl and the nariai iv and summarized in section  5 .",
    "the dynamical stability may be assured by using the variational method . according to this method",
    "the sufficient condition for the dynamical stability of a mass is that the right - hand side of the equation  @xcite @xmath15 vanishes for some chosen _ trial function _",
    "@xmath16 which satisfies the boundary conditions @xmath17 obviously , there are infinite numbers of _ trial functions _ which satisfy the conditions  ( [ cond-2 ] ) .",
    "the most well used are the following @xmath18 @xmath19 and also @xmath20 the function @xmath21 represents the amplitude of the lagrangian displacement from equilibrium , which has the form @xmath22 where @xmath23 represent the pulsation of the oscillations . in particular , when the squared pulsation @xmath24 is negative the configuration is unstable since the displacement @xmath25 grows exponentially in time . when the pulsation is positive @xmath25 decreases also exponentially and the configuration is stable  @xcite .",
    "the stability condition  ( [ cond-1 ] ) expresses a minimal , and not merely an external principle  @xcite .",
    "a comprehensive discussion of various methods for studying the normal modes of radial pulsation of general - relativistic stellar models is presented by bardeen _",
    "et al_.  @xcite . in reference",
    "@xcite the advantage and disadvantage of the present method are also analyzed and discussed .",
    "for an adiabatic perturbation , the adiabatic index @xmath26 , which appears in the stability formulae  ( [ cond-1 ] ) can be expressed in the form  @xcite @xmath27 where the subscript @xmath28 indicates the derivation at constant entropy and @xmath29 is the speed of sound in units of speed of light .",
    "the role of the adiabatic index in the stability condition is very important and its effect will be presented in detail in the next section .",
    "the adiabatic index is a basic ingredient of the instability criterion  ( [ cond-1 ] ) . in particular",
    ", it is the quantity which incorporates all the basic characteristics of the equation of state on the instability formulae and consequently consists the _ bridge _ between the relativist structure of a spherical static object and the equation of state of the interior fluid .",
    "specifically , for most of the equation of state of neutron star matter , @xmath26 varies from 2 to 4 .",
    "more precisely , in some cases the adiabatic index is a weak function of the density while in other cases exhibits a more complicated density dependence  @xcite .",
    "the stability of a compact object mainly depends on the interplay between the equation of state of the fluid interior and the strength of the relativistic field . in view of the above , the question which is naturally rises is the following : is it possible , in the framework of stable configurations , to impose constraints on the equation of state of compact objects with respect to the values of the adiabatic index ? and even more :",
    "is it possible to gain some useful information concerning extreme condition ( maximum mass , maximum central pressure and density and e.t.c ) by studying the interplay between the adiabatic index ( equation of state ) and the stable configuration of a compact object ?    the adiabatic index is a function of the baryon density and consequently exhibits radial dependence on the instability criterion  ( [ cond-1 ] ) . in a very few cases , as for example in a polytropic equation of state ,",
    "the adiabatic index is a constant .",
    "nevertheless , it is possible to define , via the instability criterion  ( [ cond-1 ] ) , the averaged adiabatic index @xmath30 as  @xcite @xmath31 in the special case where @xmath32 the above formulae is considerably simplified and reduces to the expression @xmath33 the averaged adiabatic index @xmath34 is a functional both of the function @xmath21 as well as of the compactness parameter @xmath35 .",
    "obviously , @xmath34 is related to the condition of stability .",
    "chandrasekhar  @xcite found that in the case of schwarzschild constant - density interior solution , in the newtonian limit , in order to avoid the instability @xmath34 must satisfy the inequality @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the critical value of the adiabatic index ( see discussion below ) .",
    "now , we will employ the approximation that the adiabatic index @xmath26 is a constant through the star  @xcite .",
    "obviously , this is an artificial treatment since @xmath26 ( except in some specific cases ) depends on the radius @xmath1 .",
    "however , this approximation leads to a very useful insight and imposes some marginal constraints .",
    "in particular , this approximation directly relates the equation of state , which characterizes the fluid , with a possible stable configuration . in view of the above consideration we will define the critical value @xmath37 of the adiabatic index , as an effective constant index which corresponds to neutral configuration @xmath38 .",
    "now , in the case where @xmath32 , @xmath37 is given by the equation @xmath39",
    "\\times\\left(9\\int_{0}^r e^{(\\lambda+3\\nu)/2 } pr^2 dr   \\right)^{-1}. \\label{g - cr-1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] obviously , the stability condition @xmath40 leads to the inequality @xmath41 the case @xmath42 , as mentioned before , corresponds to the onset of the instability .",
    "finally , it should be noted that the adiabatic index defined in eq.([gamma-1 ] ) , is a local characteristic of a specific equation of state and obviously is a function of the interior fluid density and consequently of the parameter of distance @xmath1 .",
    "however , the effective adiabatic indices @xmath30 and @xmath37 have a global character and they combine both characteristics of the equation of state as well as characteristics of the relativistic field .",
    "in the case of the schwarzschild interior solution , the density is constant through the star .",
    "there is no physical justification of this solution , actually it is not a real solution .",
    "however this solution is very interesting since it combines the following : a ) in the interior of neutron stars the density is almost constant , b ) it is very simple to allow an exact solution of einstein s equations , c ) it is useful for pedagogic reasons  @xcite . in the present work we will use this solution in comparison with the three others .",
    "actually , the definition of the critical adiabatic index has been introduced by chandrasekhar by employing the constant interior solution  @xcite .",
    "briefly we present below the basic ingredients of the schwarzschild interior solution .",
    "the metric functions are defined as @xmath43 the energy density and the pressure read @xmath44 @xmath45 the ratio of the central pressure to central energy density @xmath0 , which plays important role on the stability condition is given by the expression @xmath46    according to this solution the central pressure becomes infinite when @xmath47 ( actually , this upper limit holds for any star  @xcite ) .",
    "the main drawback of this solution is the infinite value of the speed of sound .",
    "the tolman vii solution is the most famous of the analytical solutions .",
    "it is of great interest since it has the specific property the pressure and the density to vanish at the surface of the star .",
    "this solution has been extensively employed to neutron star studies while its physical realization has been examined in detail very recently  @xcite .",
    "actually , the stability of this solution has been examined by negi _ et al_.  @xcite . in the present work",
    "the stability is reexamined and in addition the results are compared with the other similar solutions .",
    "the basic ingredients of the tolman vii solutions are presented below .",
    "the metric functions are defined as follows @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 the energy density and the pressure read @xmath51 @xmath52 there are some constraints related with the validity of the tolman vii solution . in particular ,",
    "the central value of pressure becomes infinite for @xmath53 while the speed of sound remains less than the speed of light only for @xmath54  @xcite .",
    "we pay special effort to examine the stability of the buchdahl solution .",
    "firstly , knutsen  @xcite found that this solution is unstable with respect to radial oscillations and consequently must be discarded as a model for a star , where the temperature is essentially at absolute zero ( this is the case of white dwarf and neutron star ) or a convective equilibrium , that is a supermassive star .",
    "later on , negi  @xcite showed that this solution is stable and also gravitationally bound for all values of the compactness parameter .",
    "this analytical solution has been already used in the literature for studies related with the neutron star structure and may be a subject of future similar studies .",
    "we consider that it is worth to reexamine , with respect to the previous efforts , the stability of this solutions .",
    "the buchdahl s solution has no particular physical basis .",
    "however , it does have two specific properties : ( i ) it can be made casual everywhere in the star by demanding that the local speed of sound is less than one and ( ii ) for small values of the pressure @xmath55 it reduces to @xmath56 , which , in the newtonian theory of stellar structure is the well known @xmath57 polytrope  @xcite .",
    "so , buchdahl s solution may be regarded as its relativistic generalization .",
    "the equation of state , in buchdahl s solution , has the following simple form @xmath58 where @xmath55 is the local pressure and @xmath59 is a parameter . in particular",
    "the metric functions are defined as @xmath60 where @xmath61 the energy density and the pressure read @xmath62 @xmath63 where @xmath64 it is more convenient to use the variable @xmath65 instead of @xmath66 and in this case we have @xmath67 where @xmath68 the upper limit of @xmath69 which corresponds to the surface of the fluid sphere is given by @xmath70 .",
    "the buchdahl solution is physically meaningful in restricted domains  @xcite .",
    "these are : a ) in order to ensure that @xmath71 then must @xmath72 , b ) the causality condition @xmath73 demands that @xmath74 and c ) the condition @xmath75 satisfied only when @xmath76 .",
    "the nariai iv solution  @xcite is the most complicated and less known , compared to the previous ones .",
    "this solution has been employed in neutron stars studies  @xcite .",
    "however , the stability of this solution , according to our knowledge , is examined for a first time in the literature . in the present work",
    "we will employ the parametrization used in ref .",
    "@xcite , since it is more convenient and with obvious physical representation . due to the complicated character of this solution",
    ", the presentation is given below with all the details .",
    "in particular , the metric functions are defined as @xmath77 where @xmath78 and @xmath79 , \\quad g(r')=\\cos^{-1}c+\\sqrt{\\frac{3\\beta}{2}}\\left[1-\\left(\\frac{r'}{r ' } \\right)^2\\right ] , \\label{nariai-1 - 1}\\ ] ] @xmath80 the energy density @xmath81 and the pressure @xmath82 are expressed in terms of the parametric variable @xmath83 @xmath84 , \\label{nariai-1-den}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath85 .",
    "\\label{nariai-1-pres}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in addition the central energy density and pressure are @xmath86 @xmath87 and also @xmath88 the central pressure , remains finite only when @xmath89 , while the causality is satisfied when @xmath90  @xcite .",
    "it is more convenient now to use the variable @xmath65 instead of the variable @xmath66 .",
    "the upper limit of @xmath69 , which corresponds to the surface of the fluid sphere , is given by @xmath91 .",
    "1a we display the dependence of the frequency of the pulsations @xmath92 on the compactness parameter @xmath2 for the three analytical solutions .",
    "we employ , in each case , the _ trial _ function @xmath93 .",
    "the tolman vii solution becomes unstable for @xmath94 ( confirming the value that found also by  @xcite ) and still remains unstable up to the value @xmath53 where the ratio @xmath0 remains finite .",
    "the nariai iv solution is stable up to the value @xmath95 where the ratio @xmath0 becomes infinite .",
    "the buchdahl solution is stable up to the value @xmath96 since for @xmath97 the speed of sound becomes @xmath98 .",
    "it is worth to noticing that all the analyzed solutions are stable even in the region of @xmath35 where the causality condition is violated ( see section  5 for more details ) .",
    "nevertheless , the mentioned violation does not lead to instability of the compact object ( see also ref .",
    "however , in order to compare the results with those originated from realistic equation of states the causality constraints must be taken into account ( see also the discussion below ) .",
    "we concentrate now on the stability of the buchdahl solution .",
    "we performed a taylor expansion of the instability condition ( [ cond-1 ] ) and we founded , for low values of @xmath35 , the approximation @xmath99 the above approximation confirms the stability of the buchdahl solution and also reproduces very well the numerical results up to the value @xmath100 .",
    "moreover , in fig .",
    "1b we present the @xmath92 dependence on @xmath35 for three different _ trial _ functions @xmath21 . the analytical approximation ( [ aprox - sigma ] )",
    "has been also included for comparison .",
    "the dependence @xmath92 on @xmath35 is almost insensitive on the choice of the trial function @xmath101 , especially for low values of @xmath35 .",
    "the present results , are very close to the results of negi  @xcite and we confirm his statement that the buchdahl solution is stable for all values of @xmath35 . in order to provide more details of our study , we present in table  1 the numerical results concerning the buchdahl solution in comparison with the results of negi  @xcite and for future studies .    in fig .",
    "2a we plot the averaged adiabatic index @xmath34 and the corresponding critical adiabatic index @xmath37 for the three analytical solutions as a function of the compactness @xmath35 . in addition , the result of the uniform density for @xmath37 , and also the approximation @xmath102 ( introduced by chandresekhar  @xcite ) are also included . in the newtonian limit @xmath103 , all the cases reproduce the expected result that is @xmath104 , while in the post - newtonian approximation dynamical instability requires that @xmath105 .    fig .",
    "2a demonstrates the stability of the analytical solutions since in each case the condition @xmath106 is ensured for the relevant range of @xmath35 .",
    "the only exception is the tolman vii solution where for @xmath107 , the inequality @xmath108 takes place , ensuring the instability of the solution in the mentioned region ( see also fig .",
    "it should be noted that the dependence of @xmath34 on @xmath35 is model dependent .",
    "however , the most distinctive feature indicated in fig.(2a ) is a similar dependence of @xmath37 on @xmath35 , for all the analytical models , even for high values of @xmath35 .",
    "the above result leads to the conjecture that @xmath37 exhibits a universal behavior , at least for the configurations originated from analytical solutions of the relativist equations .",
    "however , the above statement must be considered for the case where realistic equations of state are used for the construction of spherical relativistic configurations . using the tolman vii solution as a guide of the mentioned universal relations we found that the expression @xmath109 reproduces very well the numerical results of the tolman vii solution , up to the value @xmath110 ( which corresponds to the causality limit ) and also the results of the other analytical solutions .",
    "it is also natural to extent the above conjecture and to consider that the dependence  ( [ gamm - fit ] ) can be generalized to include also the adiabatic index which corresponds to realistic equation of state .",
    "in addition , we consider also the possibility , to impose some constraints on the value of the adiabatic index in order to ensure the stability of a very compact object ( dwarf with mass close to the limiting mass , neutron stars and also supermassive stars ) .    in order to clarify further the effects of the equation of state , via the adiabatic index , on the stability condition , we plot in fig .",
    "2b the dependence of the averaged adiabatic index @xmath34 and the critical adiabatic index @xmath37 on the ratio @xmath0 for the four analytical solutions .",
    "the chandrasekhar approximation  @xcite @xmath111    have been also included for comparison .",
    "the most distinctive feature is the occurrence of an almost linear dependence between @xmath37 and @xmath0 in all the cases .",
    "in particular , this dependence is of the form @xmath112 where the values of the parameter @xmath113 for the tolman vii , buchdahl and nariai iv are @xmath114 , @xmath115 and @xmath116 respectively .",
    "actually , the values of @xmath37 provide , for each solution , the lower limit which correspond to stable configurations .",
    "we note that in all cases the upper bound @xmath0 is taken in order to ensure the causality of the central value of the speed of sound .    in the uniform density solution ,",
    "since there is no restriction from the speed of sound , we can extend the study even for higher values of @xmath35 and consequently on the ratio @xmath0 .",
    "considering , for physical reasons , as an upper bound the value of @xmath117 , we found that expression ( [ g - pcec-1 ] ) holds in a very good accuracy .",
    "however , the values of @xmath113 exhibit moderate dependence on the form of the trail function @xmath21 , for high values of @xmath0 .",
    "in particular , we found that @xmath118 for @xmath119 and @xmath120 for the @xmath121 .",
    "we conjecture that the schwarzschild interior solution marks the absolute lower limit to the critical adiabatic index , given by the expression @xmath122 consequently , for any analytical or numerical solution of the tov equation and for a given value of @xmath0 , it always holds @xmath123 the universality of the expression ( [ g - pcec-1 ] ) , mainly for low values of @xmath0 , is essential in order to relate the present results with those originating from realistic equations of state .",
    "moreover , it is of significant interest to examine , in the framework of realistic equations of state , in which extent the condition of neutral configuration @xmath124 satisfies the expression ( [ g - pcec-1 ] ) .    in any case",
    ", useful insight can be gained from the comparison of the results originating from numerical and analytical solution of the tov equations .",
    "for example , the stable configurations , which correspond to a numerical solution of the tov equation using realistic equation of state will satisfy the inequality @xmath125 .",
    "now , from eqs.([gamma - mv-2 ] ) and ( [ g - pcec-1 ] ) we get the deduced stability inequality @xmath126 in general , the adiabatic index @xmath26 , which corresponds to any realistic equation of state , is a function of the density and consequently of the distance .",
    "however , in some cases @xmath127 is a weak function of the density  @xcite . in these cases , considering that the adiabatic index is almost a constant , the inequality ( [ cond - eos-1 ] ) leads to the following simple constrain , in order to ensure the stability of the configuration @xmath128 the inequality ( [ eos - cons-2 ] ) holds in a very good accuracy mainly for @xmath129 where the value of @xmath130 is quite well fixed",
    ". for higher values of @xmath0 one has to impose the proper uncertainties on the values of @xmath130 . in any case , it is interesting that the onset of instability exhibits so simple dependence on the ratio @xmath0 even for the case of relativistic stars . in fig .",
    "3 we indicate the stability ( instability ) window which defined by the analytical solutions employed in the present study . the upper curve is the absolute upper limit given by the expression @xmath131 which corresponds to eq .",
    "( [ eos - cons-2 ] ) with @xmath118 ( originated from the schwarzschild constant - density interior solution ) .",
    "the lower curve corresponds to the value @xmath132 which originated from the nariai iv solution .",
    "the relative uncertainty indicated also by the intermediate shaded region .    finally , it is worth to point out that there is a simple and practical criterion which can be obtained assuming that the adiabatic index is the same as in a slowly deformed matter  @xcite . in this case",
    "the model is stable when the inequality @xmath133 holds .",
    "however , the above condition is just necessary but not sufficient as stated for the criterion @xmath134 .",
    "the stability of three analytical solutions , suitable to describe compact relativistic objects , has been examined . the stability in all the cases",
    "is ensured for a large range of the compactness parameter @xmath35 .",
    "our study , concerning the stability of the buchdahl solution , supports the finding of negi  @xcite that the solution is stable and is in contradiction with the corresponding statement of knutsen  @xcite .",
    "our study leads to the conclusion that the nariai iv solution is also stable and suitable for physical applications . according to our knowledge the stability if this solution has never been examined in the past .",
    "we found that the critical adiabatic index exhibits a universal dependence on @xmath135 even for high values of the compactness and also an almost linear and universal dependence on the ratio @xmath0 .",
    "this relation holds even for higher values of the compactness ( @xmath136 ) and the ratio @xmath0 ( @xmath137 ) .",
    "a planned future work will extend the study in order to include results originating from the use of realistic equations of state . in this case",
