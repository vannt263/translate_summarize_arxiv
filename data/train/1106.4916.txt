    "with the field of cold and ultracold molecules coming of age in the past few years , efficient cooling methods are becoming more and more valuable .",
    "optical methods have the advantage that they do not rely on collisional processes which are hard to predict and which often open severe collisional loss channels . a number of ingenious optical cooling schemes for molecules have been devised : it has been realized , e.g. , that translational cooling of molecules might be possible with light sources with a specifically designed set of lines @xcite . alternatively , the almost - closed level scheme a molecule like caf has been exploited @xcite to laser cool molecules as it is usually done with @xcite . even a 3d scheme has been proposed resembling the popular magneto - optical trap for atoms @xcite .",

    "optical cavities have been predicted @xcite and used for atoms @xcite as a way to achieve translational cooling without relying on spontaneous emission , in principle allowing cooling of molecules . in refs .",
    "@xcite we have shown that cavity - enhanced raman scattering can enable one to cool both the internal and the external degrees of freedom of molecules , using simulations based on ab - initio calculations for oh and no radicals . in this proposal",
    "the cavity enhances the anti - stokes , cooling transitions over other heating transitions . in a recent paper vuleti and co",
    "workers demonstrated sideband cooling of the motion of a single trapped ion to the ground state of the trap potential via cavity enhanced scattering @xcite . in the present article",
    "we make the next step and demonstrate theoretically cavity - enhanced sideband cooling of molecules and molecular ions in a strongly confining external potential , in the setup sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] .",
    "we show that cooling to the ground state of the external potential can be achieved for experimentally feasible setups .",
    "the new scheme thus offers the possibility to reach lower final temperatures compared to the previously reported cooling schemes @xcite , where the limit is given by the cavity linewidth .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec:2 ] the theoretical model is introduced and the derivation of the rate equations for cooling the external motion of the molecules is sketched .",

    "[ sec:4 ] .",
    "we theoretically explore the efficiency of performing sideband cooling of a molecule of mass @xmath0 , which is confined by a harmonic potential and couples to the mode of a high - finesse resonator .",
    "the level scheme is sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup:2 ] : a two - level transition of the molecule is driven transversally by a laser with coupling strength @xmath1 ( rabi frequency ) , and emits photons at frequency @xmath2 .",
    "the bad - cavity limit is assumed , which implies that the molecule scatters prevalently photons into the cavity mode , which are then lost via cavity decay .",
    "let us now provide a specific example .",
    "the two - level transition , which is driven by electromagnetic radiation , is composed of two vibrational states @xmath3 , @xmath4 of the electronic ground state of a molecule , which we denote by @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "let @xmath7 be the transition frequency .",
    "this level scheme is closed inside the vibrational subspace .",
    "spontaneous emission into different rotational substates is suppressed by the cavity , while any residual leakage can be handled by microwave re - pump schemes .",
    "these properties allow one to use this transition for cavity cooling .",
    "we further note that this sort of vibrational transitions is usually in the infrared regime ( 100 - 4000@xmath8 ) and has typically a homogeneous linewidth below 1khz , which allows one to spectrally resolve the motional sidebands . in order to obtain convenient cooling rates , and hence efficient cooling , spontaneous emission is here enhanced by coupling with the mode of an infrared high - finesse resonator",
    ". the spatial confinement can be obtained by means of dipole or ion traps , depending on whether the molecule is neutral or charged @xcite .    in order to perform sideband cooling ,",
    "the initial spatial localization of the molecule must be smaller than the wavelength of the driving laser .",
    "this requirement can be rewritten as @xmath9 , with @xmath10 the mean occupation of phononic states of the harmonic oscillator and @xmath11 the lamb - dicke parameter , @xmath12 , with @xmath13 the wave vector of the transition and @xmath14 the trap frequency in angular units@xcite .",
    "one necessary condition is that the lamb - dicke parameter is smaller than unity @xmath15 .",
    "moreover , the molecule should be pre - cooled , e.g. , by means of an optical cooling schemes  @xcite or other non - optical methods @xcite",
    ". nevertheless we note that sideband cooling can be efficient even for @xmath16  @xcite .",

    "we characterize the efficiency of cavity - enhanced sideband cooling by means of a rate equation , which gives the dynamics of the occupation of the oscillator levels @xmath60 , @xmath61 .",

    "we have also checked that in the limit where the perturbative treatment is expected to be valid , the predictions of analytics and numerics are almost identical . in the following we refer then to the numerical results .",
    "the analytical results , nevertheless , serve for a double purpose . in first place , they allow one to identify the parameter interval where cooling is optimal ( allowing to quickly find the region where the numerical effort should be concentrated on ) .",
    "moreover , since the dynamics described by the analytical solution is well understood , see e.g. @xcite , by comparison with the numerical results they permit one to identify the physical origin of the discrepancies .",

    "we have identified experimental parameters for trapping and cooling the cos molecule , which may be realized in the near future . the use of infrared transitions well - resolved sidebands may easily be achieved in different types of harmonic traps .",
    "as long as the strong - coupling regime can be implemented with a chosen vibrationally transition , concurrent decay channels are outrun by the enhancement .",
    "moreover the scheme is well suited for ion traps due to their long storage times and their low anharmonicities . under these considerations ground - state cooling on a sub - millisecond time scale seems possible . more efficient",
