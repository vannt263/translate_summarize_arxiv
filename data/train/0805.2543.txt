    "after the first experimental observation of negative refraction  @xcite , some intriguing or even counter - intuitive phenomena in left - handed materials ( lhms ) , such as amplification of evanescent waves  @xcite , unusual photon tunneling  @xcite , negative goos - hnchen shift  @xcite , and reversed linear doppler effect  @xcite have attracted much attention .",
    "linear doppler effect is a well - known phenomenon by which the frequency of a wave is shifted according to the relative velocity of the source and the observer  @xcite .",
    "the conventional understanding of linear doppler effect is that increased frequencies are measured when a source and an observer approach each other .",
    "applications of the effect are widely established and include radar , laser cooling , flow measurement , and the search for astronomical objects .",
    "the inverse linear doppler effect refers to frequency shifts that are in the opposite sense to those described above .",
    "for example , increased frequencies would be measured on reflection of waves from a receding boundary  @xcite .",
    "the interaction of a moving medium with a lagurre - gaussian ( lg ) field raises the fundamental question of the doppler effect . as a medium moves across the helical wave fronts of the lg field , it experiences , in addition to the usual linear doppler shift related to the velocity in the light propagation direction , a most intriguing frequency shift , the so - called rotational doppler effect associated with the azimuthal velocity .",
    "the rotational doppler effect results in frequency shift when the light beam is rotated around its propagation axis . the rotational doppler effect has been extensively studied in regular right - handed materials ( rhms )  @xcite .",
    "veselago has suggested that lhms would reverse nearly all known optical phenomena  @xcite .",
    "now an interesting question arises : what happens to the rotational doppler effect in lhms ?",
    "when the lg beams incident into lhms , the helical wave fronts should reverse their screwing fashion  @xcite .",
    "thus we can predict that the rotational doppler effect will result in many intriguing phenomena .",
    "the investigation of the rotational doppler effect will provide insights into the fundamental properties of lhms and will allow us to better understand the interaction of light with lhms .    in this work ,",
    "we try to reveal the rotational doppler effect associated with light beams carrying orbital angular momentum in lhms .",
    "first , starting from the maxwell s equations in moving frame , we obtain the analytical description for lg beams propagating in rotating lhms .",
    "our formalism permits us to introduce the effective index to describe the wave propagation .",
    "next , we attempt to recover how the wave - front evolves , and how the screwing wave - fronts result in upshifted and downshifted frequencies . in order to explore the rotational doppler effect",
    ", we examine a simplest intensity pattern formed by lg beams with equal magnitudes and waist parameters .",
    "then , we want to investigate how the rotational doppler effect gives rise to the anomalous upstream transverse poynting vector and angular momentum flow .",
    "finally , we attempt to explore how the rotational doppler effect influences the rotation of intensity pattern inside the lhm .",
    "to investigate the effective index of rotating lhm , we firstly use the maxwell s equations to determine the field distribution inside the lhm . we consider a monochromatic electromagnetic field , @xmath0 $ ] and @xmath1 $ ] , of angular frequency @xmath2 propagating from a conventional rhm to the lhm .",
    "the field can be described by maxwell s equations @xmath3 from the maxwell s equations , we can easily find that the wave propagation is permitted in materials with @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "veselago termed these lhms , because the vectors @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 form a left - handed triplet instead of a right - handed triplet , as is the case in regular rhms  @xcite .    in order to investigate the effective index ,",
    "we introduce a rest frame and a moving frame  @xcite . in the rest frame",
    "the lhm rotates with an angular velocity @xmath9 and in the moving frame the lhm is at rest .",
    "we restrict our analysis to a small velocity with @xmath10 . for the lhm at rest , we have the following constitutive relations : @xmath11 where we have used primes to denote the fields and their frequencies in the moving frame .",
    "the fields in the moving frame can be expressed in the rest frame by a lorentz transformation , which gives to first order in @xmath12 : @xmath13 here electric permittivity @xmath14 and magnetic permeability @xmath15 are given as a function of the frequency in the moving frame .",
    "we also assume that @xmath14 and @xmath15 depend only on the frequency and is independent of the state of motion of the lhm . on combining these two equations",
    ", we can obtain the following wave equation : @xmath16\\omega\\omega(\\sigma\\pm \\partial_\\varphi)d,\\label{wv}\\ ] ] where we have introduced the relation @xmath17 , and @xmath18 corresponds to left- and right - handed circularly polarized light , respectively . to determine the effective indices , we solve the wave equation for helical wave - front lg beams .",
    "we introduce the lorentz - gauge vector potential to describe the propagation characteristics of lg filed .",
    "the vector potential of the beam propagating in the @xmath19 direction can be written in the form @xmath20 here @xmath21 is a complex amplitude , @xmath22 is the effective index , @xmath23 , @xmath24 is the speed of light in vacuum , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are unit vectors , respectively .",

    "( [ f1 ] ) denotes the gouy phase which is given by @xmath45 .",
    "now let us study the screw of the wave front . here",
    "the sense of the positive angles is chosen as anticlockwise , while negative angles are considered in the clockwise direction . in the rotating lhm ,",
    "the constant wavefront satisfies @xmath46 the schematic view of the wave front is a three - dimensional screw surface of ( @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 ) .",
    "the plotting range of @xmath50 is from @xmath51 to @xmath52 with the interval of @xmath53 and that of @xmath54 is from @xmath51 to @xmath55 with the interval of @xmath56 .",
    "the wavefront structure reverse their screw types with a pitch of @xmath57 and @xmath58 , respectively ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the helical wave fronts with clockwise or anticlockwise screwing fashion will result in different effective indices .",
    "substituting the lg beam in the wave equation , we have @xmath59 \\frac{\\omega\\omega}{c^2}(\\sigma\\pm l).\\label{wv}\\ ] ] thus from eq .",
    "( [ wv ] ) , and using the relation @xmath60 , we can obtain an equation of the refractive indices associated with the waves of each screwing fashion : @xmath61\\frac{\\omega}{\\omega}(\\sigma\\pm l).\\label{efield}\\ ] ] here we have approximated the refractive indices to the first order in @xmath62 . to obtain the indices , we need to know the effective frequency .",
    "strictly speaking , we can not obtain it from the wave equation in the moving frame .",
    "now a question arises : how to determine the value of effective frequency in the lhm ?",
    "in the case of electromagnetic radiation this usually means that the subunits must be much smaller than the wavelength of radiation .",
    "then the unit cells of metamaterials can be modeled as the atoms ( or molecules ) in ordinary materials . in particular , electric atoms with an electric - dipole moment leading to a negative electric permittivity , and magnetic atoms with a magnetic - dipole moment leading to a negative magnetic permeability .",
    "hence the rotational doppler effect in lhms is the result of the optical properties of the individual metamaterial `` atoms '' ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .    to quantify the changes that occur in the doppler effect for metamaterial `` atoms '' interacting with light beams with orbital angular momentum ,",
    "the quantum mechanical derivation  @xcite is developed for describing the rotational doppler effect in lhms . the doppler shift experienced by a lg field in a moving frame",
    "is given by @xmath63v_z -\\frac{n k_0 r}{r } v_r-\\frac{\\sigma\\pm l}{r}v_\\varphi,\\label{dop}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 are the axial , radial , and azimuthal velocity components of the metamaterial `` atom '' , respectively .",
    "the axial doppler shift is obtained from @xmath67 .",
    "there are two additional terms which account for the radial phase and the gouy - phase .",
    "note that the two additional terms should be reversed , since the negative index and the inverse gouy - phase shift  @xcite .",
    "thus we can conclude that the linear doppler effect associated with light beams is slightly different form the counterpart of plane wave  @xcite .",
    "further investigation shows that the radial doppler shift , given by the term proportional to @xmath65 , should also be reversed in lhms .    a most intriguing frequency shift , the so - called rotational doppler effect arises from the azimuthal velocity @xmath68 . the rotational doppler effect results in frequency shift when the light beam is rotated around its propagation axis .",
    "the corresponding rotational doppler shift in lhms is given by @xmath69 , which is proportional to the total angular momentum .",
    "it can be seen that beams propagate differently in a rotating lhm , depending on whether the wave fronts turn in the same rotation sense as the lhm or in the opposite sense .",
    "the frequency of an incident lg beam whose wave - front is screwing as the lhm is downshifted to @xmath70 , whereas a lg beam of the opposite sense is upshifted to @xmath71 .",
    "unexpectedly , the rotational frequency shift in lhms is unreversed .",
    "when a lg beam incident into a lhm , the helical wave fronts reverse their screwing fashion  @xcite .",
    "why is the rotational frequency shift unreversed ? by closely examining the evolution of wave - front",
    ", we find the phase velocity also inverses its direction ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) . hence the dynamic evolution between the metamaterial `` atom '' and",
    "wave - front remains unchanged .",
    "we conclude that the physics underlying the unreversed effect is collective contributions of negative phase velocity and inverse screw of wave - front .",
    "though the rotational doppler effect is unreversed , much more counter - intuitive phenomena will be caused in the lhms . in order to explore the rotational doppler effect ,",
    "we will examine a simplest intensity pattern which is formed by @xmath72 and @xmath73 beams with equal magnitudes and waist parameters . in principle , any arbitrary light beam can be described by a superposition of lg modes  @xcite . in the case of equal frequencies , such a combination is well known to be equivalent to an ordinary hermite - gaussian ( hg ) beam with a double - spot intensity distribution .",
    "we will explore the energy flow and angular momentum flow caused by rotational doppler effect .",
    "first let us examine the propagation characteristics of energy flow , which is usually discussed by use of the poynting vector .",
    "there has been considerable interest in orbital angular momentum of lg beams relating to azimuthal component of poynting vector  @xcite .",
    "the time average poynting vector , @xmath74 , can be written as @xmath75.\\label{pv}\\ ] ] we denote the radial , azimuthal , and axial components of the vector @xmath74 in the cylindrical coordinates by the notation @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 , respectively .",
    "the component @xmath76 , relates to the spread of the beam as it propagates .",
    "the azimuthal component @xmath77 describes the energy flow that circulates around the propagating axis .",

    "note that the momentum flow is significantly different from that obtained by minkowski or abraham momentum  @xcite .",
    "the cross product of this momentum density with the radius vector yields an orbital angular momentum flow .",
    "the orbital angular momentum flow in the @xmath49 direction depends upon the component of @xmath87 , such that @xmath88 .    in order to accurately describe the poynting vector and momentum flow",
    ", it is necessary to include material dispersion and losses  @xcite .",
    "thus , a certain dispersion relation , such as the lorentz medium model , should be introduced .",
    "the constitutive parameters are @xmath89 to avoid the trouble involving in a certain value of frequency , we assume the material parameters are @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 . it should be noted that , as we will see in the following , the dispersion and negative indices will play a very important role in the rotation of poynting vector and momentum flow .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows the characteristics of poynting vector and momentum flow .",
    "the circumstance is really intriguing : the novel azimuthal energy flow and momentum flow present in the hg field .",
    "counter - intuitively , the angular velocity @xmath31 of the rotating lhm and the circulation of poynting vector are opposite , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) .",
    "the presence of the azimuthal momentum flow @xmath87 has been identified as the orbital angular momentum .",
    "we thus predict that the rotational doppler effect can induce a transfer of angular momentum of the lhm to obitual angular momentum of the beam .",
    "the sign of the orbital angular momentum coincides with handedness of rotation of the lhm .",
    "positive orbital angular momentum is associated with the counter - clockwise rotation @xmath93 , as plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) . on the contrary , the sign of the orbital angular momentum in the hg field is negative : when the lhm rotates clockwise @xmath94 , the angular momentum flow seemingly corresponds to the clockwise circulation .",
    "the physical origin of transfer of angular momentum is rooted in the geometric phase difference between @xmath72 and @xmath73 beams .    whether the rotational doppler effect induce the downstream or upstream angular momentum depends on the normal or anomalous dispersion . in the normal dispersion region , @xmath95/\\partial\\omega>0 $ ] , the rotational doppler effect induces a upstream energy flow [ see fig .",

    "[ fig2](b ) ] . in the anomalous dispersion region , @xmath96/\\partial\\omega<0 $ ] , however , the rotational doppler effect induces a downstream energy flow and a upstream momentum flow .",
    "interestingly , we find that the transverse energy flow in the lhm is antiparallel to the transverse momentum flow . in our opinion ,",
    "the main reason for such an inconsistence is the negative refractive index .",
    "note that the novel phenomenon is significantly different from the counterpart in regular rhms  @xcite .",

    "the schematic view of the spatial structure of instant field is plotted in fig .",
    "here we have neglected the phase difference caused by radial and gouy phases .",
    "the spatial structure exhibits an screwing type with a pitch of @xmath97 along the @xmath19 axis .    in this case , the constituent lg beams propagate differently in the lhm which leads to a change in their relative phase .",
    "the pattern rotates with an angular velocity @xmath104 .",
    "the angle per unit length by which the intensity pattern is rotated is called the specific rotary power @xmath105 .",

    "thus negative group velocities are possible only in the presence of absorption .",
    "in a recent experiment  @xcite , the negative group velocity have been demonstrated by observing that the pulse advances in time with respect to the same wave packet propagating in vacuum .",
    "the low - loss lhms are therefore good candidates for the experimental observation of significant upstream rotation of intensity pattern .",
