    "one - dimensional ( @xmath0 ) quantum many - body systems of interacting fermions have attracted theoretical and experimental interest for more than fifty years  @xcite .",
    "contrary to what happens in higher dimensionality , these systems can not be described by the conventional landau theory of normal fermi liquids  @xcite due to a subtle interplay between topology and interactions . the appropriate paradigm for @xmath0 interacting fermions is instead provided by the luttinger - liquid concept introduced by haldane in the early eighties  @xcite .",
    "strongly correlated @xmath0 systems that are nowadays available for experiment range from ultra - cold atomic gases  @xcite to electrons in single - wall carbon nanotubes  @xcite and in semiconductor quantum wires  @xcite .",
    "chiral luttinger liquids at fractional quantum - hall edges  @xcite also provide an example of @xmath0 electronic conductors and have been the subject of intense experimental and theoretical studies  @xcite . in many experimental situations the translational invariance of the fluid",
    "is broken by the presence of inhomogeneous external fields .",
    "examples are the confining potential provided by magnetic and optical traps for ultra - cold gases  @xcite and the barriers at the end of a quantum wire segment in cleaved edge overgrowth samples  @xcite .",
    "these strong perturbations induce the appearance of a new length scale and can cause novel physical behaviors relative to the corresponding unperturbed , galileian - invariant model system .    of special relevance to the present work are the studies carried out in ref .  , where momentum - resolved tunneling experiments between two closely situated parallel quantum wires have been carried out to probe the phenomenon of spin - charge separation in a luttinger liquid  @xcite . in these experiments",
    "a top gate is used to deplete the central portion of one of the two wires , thus locally decreasing the electron density , and a dramatic transition is observed when the electron density is reduced below a critical value .",
    "there is strong evidence that in this regime the electrons in the depleted wire segment are separated by barriers from the rest of the wire  @xcite , and it is suggested that the electrons in the segment are localized by the combined effect of the barriers and of the electron - electron interactions .",
    "the magnetic - field dependence of the tunneling conductance for a field perpendicular to the plane of the wires provides a direct probe of the many - body wavefunction of the localized electrons  @xcite , offering the possibility to investigate systematically the role of interactions in creating exotic phases of matter in reduced dimensionality .",
    "in fact , the experimental parameters in ref .",
    "are such that the electrons in the wire segment are in the strong - coupling regime .",
    "an exact diagonalization study was carried out in ref .   for a number @xmath1 of electrons up to @xmath2 .    a powerful theoretical tool to study the interplay between interactions and inhomogeneity from external fields of arbitrary shape is density - functional theory ( dft ) , based on the hohenberg - kohn theorem and the kohn - sham mapping  @xcite .",
    "many - body effects enter dft _ via _ the exchange - correlation ( xc ) functional , which is often treated by a local - density approximation ( lda ) requiring as input the xc energy of a homogeneous reference fluid . for @xmath3 and @xmath4 electronic systems",
    "the underlying reference fluid usually is the homogeneous electron liquid ( el ) , whose xc energy is known to a high degree of numerical precision from quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) studies  .",
    "several density - functional schemes have also been proposed for strongly correlated @xmath0 systems  @xcite and in the case of the @xmath0 luttinger liquid with repulsive contact interactions , where the xc energy of the homogeneous fluid is exactly known from bethe-_ansatz _ solutions , tests of the lda have been carried out against qmc data  @xcite .    in the present work we test a novel lda xc functional to treat few - electron systems confined by power - law potentials inside a segment of a quantum wire .",
    "the homogeneous reference system that we adopt is the @xmath0 el with coulomb interactions , previously studied by a number of authors  @xcite and very recently evaluated by a novel lattice - regularized diffusion monte carlo method  @xcite .",
    "the correlation energy determined in this latter study is used in our lda calculations , whereas earlier dft - based studies of @xmath0 `` quantum dots ''  @xcite have used the correlation energy of a @xmath3 el . while such choice can be justified for thick wires , a @xmath0 reference fluid is more appropriate to treat inhomogeneous electron systems in ultrathin wires of our present interest ( see also the discussion given in ref .  ) .",
    "we nevertheless find that the @xmath0-adopted lda is unable to describe the transition of the confined electrons from a fluid - like state to the localized `` wigner - like '' state that is observed to occur as the coupling strength is increased .",
    "in essence , the confining potential pins the phase of density oscillations in much the same way as an impurity inserted into the infinitely extended @xmath0 fluid does in producing friedel oscillations in the surrounding electron density .",
    "however , a cross - over from a @xmath5 to a @xmath6 periodicity occurs in these oscillations with increasing coupling in the luttinger liquid .",
    "we proceed in the later part of the paper to give a detailed analysis of this transition in the case of two electrons subject to axial harmonic confinement in a wire segment . from previous work on the two - particle problem with contact repulsive interactions",
    "@xcite we presume that a local spin - density approximation could help in transcending the limitations of the lda .",

    "<S> motivated by current interest in strongly correlated quasi - one - dimensional ( @xmath0 ) luttinger liquids subject to axial confinement , we present a novel density - functional study of few - electron systems confined by power - low external potentials inside a short portion of a thin quantum wire . </S>",
    "<S> the theory employs the @xmath0 homogeneous coulomb liquid as the reference system for a kohn - sham treatment and transfers the luttinger ground - state correlations to the inhomogeneous electron system by means of a suitable local - density approximation ( lda ) to the exchange - correlation energy functional . </S>",
    "<S> we show that such @xmath0-adapted lda is appropriate for fluid - like states at weak coupling , but fails to account for the transition to a `` wigner molecules '' regime of electron localization as observed in thin quantum wires at very strong coupling . </S>",
    "<S> a detailed analyzes is given for the two - electron problem under axial harmonic confinement . </S>"
