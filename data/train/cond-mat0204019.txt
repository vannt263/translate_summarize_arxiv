    "<S> meanwhile , the magnitudes of these structures exhibit a non - monotonous dependence on the mw  strength . </S>",
    "<S> feature ( 1 ) is quite different from the sideband effect in n - qd - n , where photon - assisted peaks appear near @xmath78 . in n - qd - s junctions , however </S>",

    "<S> feature ( 2 ) is dramatically distinguished from those in either n - qd - n or n - qd - s , indicating that mw irradiation can lead to @xmath4-junction transition in the photon - assisted current through s - qd - s .    to understand the feature ( 2 ) </S>",
    "<S> requires the knowledge of paabs . for this purpose , the time averaged current is rewritten in the form @xmath79 . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis of the current carrying spectrum @xmath80 provides the information of the supercurrent carried by each of the paabs . </S>",
    "<S> fig.2 illustrates the spectrum of @xmath80 for mw strength @xmath81 , with @xmath82 . for comparison , the spectrum of @xmath5 and @xmath83 without mw irradiation </S>",
    "<S> are also shown on top of fig.2 . without mw irradiation , </S>",
    "<S> the spectrum of s - qd - s has two abs within the superconducting gap , located near @xmath84 , carrying supercurrent with opposite signs . </S>",
    "<S> the spectrum also has continuous parts outside the superconducting gap , negative for @xmath85 and positive for @xmath86 . </S>",
    "<S> turning on the mw , the original two abs split into two sets of paabs , due to various photon - assisted processes . </S>",
    "<S> the paabs marked with a@xmath87 locate near @xmath88 , carrying supercurrent with positive signs ; while those marked with b@xmath87 locate near @xmath89 , carrying supercurrent with negative signs . on the contrast , </S>",
    "<S> mw  has negligible effect on the continuous spectrum , because the contribution from these parts depends strongly on the density of states in the s electrodes and hence photon - assisted processes is largely suppressed . </S>",
    "<S> notice that at zero temperature @xmath69 is contributed by the spectrum in the range of @xmath90 . for @xmath5 ( fig.2a ) , </S>",
    "<S> the states a@xmath87 and b@xmath87 are energy degenerate , carrying opposite supercurrent weighted by a distribution factor @xmath91 , similar to the sideband in n - qd - n . the contributions from a@xmath92 and b@xmath92 , a@xmath93 and b@xmath93 , etc . </S>",
    "<S> cancel with each other exactly , and the positive contribution from a@xmath94 overwhelms the negative contribution from c@xmath95 , resulting in a positive current . with the change of the resonant energy level @xmath1 , a@xmath87 and b@xmath87 move toward @xmath96 and @xmath97 , respectively . for @xmath98 ( fig.2d ) , </S>",
    "<S> the states a@xmath87 and b@xmath99 are energy degenerate , and therefore strongly hybridized with each other . </S>",
    "<S> so the weight of a@xmath87 and b@xmath100 are re - distributed , such that they carry the same amount of supercurrent with opposite signs . </S>",
    "<S> the contributions from a@xmath94 and b@xmath92 , a@xmath92 and b@xmath93 , etc . cancel with each other exactly , leaving the negative continuous spectrum c@xmath95 contribute to the supercurrent . </S>",
    "<S> this is the origin of the @xmath4-junction transition in the photon - assisted supercurrent . </S>",
    "<S> further investigation shows that the evolution of paabs  from ( a ) to ( d ) is more complex than stated above . in fact </S>",
    "<S> , the hybridization of a@xmath87 and b@xmath99 already occurs before the energy degeneracy ( see fig.2d and its inset ) . the hybridizing of paabs obeys the following rule : when two states a@xmath101 and b@xmath102 approaches each other , they `` interact '' with each other only if the energy of a@xmath101 is higher than that of b@xmath102 . with this rule , the abrupt sign change in the current near @xmath103 </S>",
    "<S> is readily understood .    in the above </S>",
    "<S> , we have shown that mw irradiation can reverse the sign of photon - assisted josephson current . </S>",
    "<S> we are still curious whether the main resonance located at @xmath5 can also be reversed . in the case of @xmath5 , the current formula </S>",
    "<S> is further simplified since @xmath104 is required by the resonant tunneling . </S>",
    "<S> fig.3 shows the curves of @xmath105 vs the mw  strength @xmath106 , for four groups of mw frequencies . </S>",
    "<S> these numerical results reveal some of the properties of @xmath107 : ( 1 ) @xmath107 has non - monotonous dependence on @xmath106 , which is natural due to the oscillatory nature of bessel function . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 ) for some frequencies , e.g. , @xmath108 in fig.1 , @xmath107 is always positive ; while for others , e.g. , @xmath109 , @xmath107 reverses its sign in a certain range of @xmath106 . in other words , </S>",
    "<S> mw  with proper strength and frequency may also induce @xmath4-junction transition on the main resonance . </S>",
    "<S> ( 3 ) the dependence of @xmath107 on @xmath106 changes abruptly around the frequency of @xmath110 @xmath111 . </S>",
    "<S> roughly , the reason is that when the frequency crosses @xmath112 , a@xmath113 and b@xmath113 jump out of the superconducting gap and feel the singularity in the density of states of selectrodes .    in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> we have shown theoretically that mw irradiation has a non - trivial effect on the josephson current flowing through s - qd - s structure .. the photon - assisted tunneling structures appear near @xmath114 , and each contains a negative and a positive peak , indicating @xmath4-junction transition induced by mw . the main resonance located at @xmath5 may also reversed with proper mw strength and frequency . </S>",
    "<S> the understanding of these results requires the knowledge of paabs , which are formed due to multiple paar . </S>",
    "<S> we hope that this work can stimulate experimental interests in s - qd - s structure , where qd may be a nanoparticle or a gate defined geometry in 2deg .    </S>",
