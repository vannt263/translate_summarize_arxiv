    "the imposed cutoff radius has a physical justification when considering a realistic system , which would inevitably include thermal noise .",

    "we observe that the results do not depend qualitatively on the range of the cutoff radius , and that the large scale behavior is dominated by the diffusive coupling .",

    "_ @xcite might provide valuable insight into the behavior of sto arrays .",
    "the coupling in the kuramoto model is defined simply as an interaction strength given by @xmath19 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : kuramoto ] ) . in the micromagnetic model the coupling comes from dipolar interactions , determined by the magnetic material properties and the sto spacing . in order to investigate the scaling behavior in the micromagnetic solution ,",

    "the good agreement between the micromagnetics result and the kuramoto model indicate that they both follow the same scaling law , strengthening the suggestion of the kuramoto model as a valid description for arrays of sto .",
    "to investigate the implications of the scaling with system size , we consider a model calculation of the output power as we increase the number of sto . for applications of sto as e.g. nanoscale microwave generators , the power output of a single sto is not competitive .",
    "decisive improvement is expected from the synchronization and phase locking of several sto , as this would result in a quadratic increase of the output power , @xmath64 for @xmath41 synchronized oscillators .",
    "the output of a single sto can be described by its amplitude and phase , @xmath65 . in our model",

    "the power output is proportional to @xmath68 , and for n oscillators we obtain @xmath69 , from the definition of the order parameter @xmath40 in eq .",
    "( [ orderparam ] ) .",
    "a quadratic scaling in the power output , @xmath64 , implies a perfectly synchronized and phase coherent state , given by @xmath44 . however , as the coupling strength to obtain a synchronized state scales with the number of sto , this will affect the power output when scaling up to large arrays .",
    "as an example , we consider a system of sto composed of 200 nm diameter spin valve nanopillars with 15 nm thick permalloy as the ferromagnetic layer .",
    "the average interaction energy can be extracted from micromagnetic simulations , and for an edge - edge spacing of 150 nm the interaction strength is found to be @xmath70 mhz @xcite . to increase the output power , we are now interested in scaling up to a large number of sto .",
    "we keep the same sto spacing when scaling up , e.g. keeping @xmath19 fixed . from fig .",
    "[ fig : scaling]a , we see that for an interaction strength @xmath71 , there is a corresponding number of sto , @xmath72 , where @xmath73 .",
    "this can be illustrated by calculating the total power output as the number of sto is increased , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : scaling]c . for a small number of sto",
    ", we see that the power output follows close to the ideal @xmath74 scaling .",
    "however , as the number of sto is increased , the scaling with system size becomes increasingly important . for a certain number of sto , indicated by @xmath72 in fig .",
    "[ fig : scaling]a , the interaction is no longer strong enough to obtain a synchronized state .",
    "this is also illustrated in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : scaling]c , where we plot the order parameter @xmath40 for arrays of @xmath75 and @xmath76 sto respectively , showing the transition from a synchronized state to chaotic behavior as the number of sto is increased above @xmath72 .",
    "this illustrates the importance of our findings that synchronization in such 2d arrays is purely a finite size effect .",
    "the interaction strength is limited by the material properties and sto spacing , and using realistic values of the coupling strength we start to see significant deviations from the ideal @xmath64 scaling for array sizes larger than @xmath77 sto ( see fig . [",
    "fig : scaling]c ) .",
    "this means that in a physical realizable system , the scaling with system size imposes an upper limit for the maximum number of sto that can be synchronized .      that the synchronized and phase coherent state is purely a finite size effect , is similar to that of the classical 2d xy model of magnetism .",
    "the kuramoto model is indeed similar to the 2d xy model @xcite , where the direction of spin in the xy model corresponds to the oscillator phase in the kuramoto model . in the 2d xy model a long range",
    "ordered phase is absent due to the presence of spin wave fluctuations and topological defects .",
    "the lack of long range order is a specific case of the mermin - wagner theorem in spin systems @xcite , stating that continuous symmetries can not be spontaneously broken in systems with sufficiently short range interactions in dimensions @xmath78 .",
    "the fluctuations preventing long range order in the 2d xy model diverge logarithmically with system size @xcite , in agreement with the logarithmic scaling observed in our system of sto .",
    "similar topological defects at the boundaries between locally synchronized clusters have previously been observed in the nearest neighbor kuramoto model @xcite as well as in other two - dimensional oscillator network models @xcite . in oscillator networks",
    "this is associated with the appearance of topological defects in the oscillator phase field , @xmath49 . in the continuum limit",
    "this is expressed as :    @xmath79    where @xmath80 is an integration path enclosing the defect , and @xmath47 is the topological charge .",
    "such topological features are observed also in our kuramoto model for arrays of sto .",
    "the presence of vortices in the phase field is more pronounced as the system size increases . as an example we here consider an array of @xmath81 oscillators .",
    "the disorder in the system is kept constant ( given by the difference in the nominal frequencies of the oscillators ) and the interaction strength @xmath19 is varied , acting as the inverse temperature : as coupling increases , the system becomes more ordered .",
    "starting from a disordered initial state and varying the interaction strength between each simulation , we observe 4 different regimes : for weak interaction strengths we observe the formation of locally synchronized clusters , where cluster sizes increase with interaction strength . apart from the localized clusters there is no long range order in the system ( indicated as regime 1 in fig .",

    "there are no topological defects in the phase field , and the lack of global phase coherence is due to spin waves in the phase field where the oscillator phases change smoothly across the array ( regime 3 in fig .  [",

    "the interaction strength is analogous to increasing the exchange coupling in a ferromagnetic system , resulting in a more ordered state .",
    "the result here is a gradual suppression of the spin waves in the phase field observed in regime 3 as the interaction strength is increased .",

    "previous work have shown that the synchronization transition in the globally coupled kuramoto model can be described as a phase transition , where the nature of the transition can be of first or second - order depending on the frequency distribution and coupling topology @xcite .",
    "the kuramoto model with finite range couplings is less studied , as these systems are difficult to analyze and solve analytically . a study of the locally coupled kuramoto model on a d - dimensional lattice have shown that the synchronization transition depends strongly on the lattice dimensionality , and indicates d=4 as the lower critical dimension for phase synchronization @xcite .",
    "this is in agreement with the observed scaling with system size in our model , which indicates that the synchronization transition is purely a finite size effect .    in order to investigate the synchronization transition in our model further",

    "[ fig : topology2]a we show a log - log plot of the correlation length normalized to the system size , @xmath89 , ( @xmath90 ) .",
    "the results indicate a power law relating the correlation length and the interaction strength as @xmath91 , where the exponent for this case was found to be @xmath92 .",
    "this means that the correlation length simply scales with the coupling strength , and the transition between regimes 1 - 4 in fig .",
    "[ fig : topology2 ] correspond to structures of ever increasing length scales .",
    "the transition to the phase coherent state ( @xmath93 ) occurs when the correlation length approaches the system size l , underlining the finite size effects on the synchronization transition and that the system is not undergoing a conventional phase transition .",
    "further investigations of finite size effects , the lack of long ranger order in the kuramoto model and the connection to the 2d xy model will be the subject of future work .",
    "to summarize , we have shown that the kuramoto model provides a good description of arrays of sto .",
    "it provides a simple theoretical model to study large populations of coupled sto , which were previously unaccessible due to the long computation time for a full micromagnetic solution . by investigating the collective dynamics in large arrays of sto",
    ", we observed a scaling with system size indicating that the synchronization in arrays of dipolar - coupled sto is purely a finite size effect . the critical coupling strength to obtain a globally synchronized state scales with the number of oscillators , as @xmath0 , preventing global synchronization for large system sizes . as a consequence of the scaling with system size",
    ", we showed that for realistic values of the dipolar coupling strength between sto this imposes an upper limit for the maximum number of oscillators that can be synchronized .",
    "further , we showed that the lack of long range order and scaling with system size is associated with the emergence of topological defects and the formation of patterns in the phase field , similar to that of the 2d xy - model of magnetism .    in the present study we considered dipolar - coupled sto , where the short time delay in the coupling between neighboring oscillators compared to the oscillator frequency",
    "means that phase delay in the couplings can be neglected .",
    "however , for other coupling mechanisms , time delay can become significant .",
    "interaction mediated by spin waves provide a different mechanism to obtain synchronization of sto @xcite , where the finite propagation speed of the spin waves results in a phase offset in the couplings .",
    "another recent proposal includes the use of non - local electrical couplings , where the coupling phase can be externally tuned through an electrical delay line @xcite .    from a dynamical systems point of view , the study of time delay induced modifications to the couplings is of fundamental interest , as well as of practical relevance for modeling of physical , biological and chemical systems . in such systems ,",
