    "electromagnetic ( em ) fields can carry not only energy , but also spin angular momentum and orbital angular momentum ( oam ) @xcite .",
    "the properties of oam have attracted an increasing interest in different research fields in the last two decades @xcite , bringing to several applications in applied physics @xcite .",
    "recently , the study of oam has been extended also to radio domain @xcite , in particular , to radio telecommunication for the possibility of implementing channel multiplexing and frequency reuse , as demonstrated in optics @xcite .",
    "in fact , oam waves do not interact during propagation in a homogeneous medium , i.e. , they form an orthogonal set of propagating modes @xcite . the exploitation of oam in communication links @xcite has opened a discussion about the actual possibility of overcoming some constraints , like the effect of oam modes propagation or the misalignment between transmitting and receiving antennas @xcite .",
    "this debate is restricted to long - distance transmission .",
    "whereas , no particular restrictions on the use of oam waves on short distances are evident .",
    "so , in near - field range , oam modes could represent a way to implement channel multiplexing and their natural orthogonality would simplify signals processing .",
    "also , oam modes could implement a multi - channel high - rate data link with low complexity processing and wireless applications for communicating within a data center or within a server farm .",
    "the study of such applications is fairly recent .",
    "some authors started with theoretical analysis , looking in particular at the systems performances and limitations @xcite .",
    "other authors performed communication experiments exploiting optics techniques at millimeter waves @xcite .    in this context , we present a short range oam based communication system implemented by means of circular arrays composed by patch antennas .",
    "circular arrays have already been considered in literature but only as oam generators @xcite . at the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this is the first experimental test in which patch arrays are used for communication purposes .",
    "more in detail , after this introduction , section ii reports a short theoretical frame on oam waves and antennas properties .",
    "section iii describes the arrays designed for the multiplexing system , section iv is dedicated to the communication tests and the obtained results while section v examines an application of oam waves to enhance the security level of communication systems .",
    "finally , the last section draws up the major conclusions , underlying the most relevant aspects of this work .",
    "em waves carrying oam are characterized by a spiral phase front and by a doughnut - shaped intensity profile . in general , considering a cylindrical reference system @xmath0 , an oam field at @xmath1 can be described as @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the amplitude factor , @xmath4 is the oam value and @xmath5 the wave - number .",
    "the term @xmath6 describes the spiral phase front of the field and denotes the presence of a central screw phase singularity @xcite responsible for the field central intensity minimum .",
    "due to diffraction effect , the size of this minimum increases during propagation .",
    "for this reason , it is fundamental to use a device of suitable size to collect the whole field at a certain distance from the source .",
    "oam waves can be generated and detected by several devices @xcite . among all , circular antennas arrays are particularly interesting because of their versatility .",
    "for generating an oam mode with topological charge equal to @xmath7 the antennas are fed with the same signal , but then delayed relative to each other so that the phase is incremented , in a turn , by @xmath8 .",
    "in other words , the overall phase between successive antennas is increased by @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the number of antennas on a circle around the beam axis , in a clockwise ( -@xmath11 ) or counter - clockwise ( @xmath12 ) direction .",
    "recall that the generation of an oam mode of order @xmath13 needs an array composed by a proper number of antennas : @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "otherwise , the beam phase distribution will be under - sampled , according to nyquist theorem . by using circular arrays",
    "it is also possible to control the angular direction of the main lobe of the field , and the secondary lobes distribution by acting on the array radius @xcite .",
    "circular arrays composed by elementary dipoles @xcite , patches @xcite or vivaldi antennas @xcite , have been simulated for oam generation .",
    "a patch array prototype has also been tested at the frequency of 2.5ghz @xcite but never used in a communication system .",
    "in our experimental setup , to generate and receive oam modes , we use two circular arrays , each composed by 9 patch antennas .",
    "one patch , placed at the center of the array , generates or receives the @xmath15 mode , whereas eight patches evenly spaced along a circle are equipped for @xmath16 modes .",
    "each patch is fed through a coaxial cable , linked with a sma connector .",
    "the length of each cable is calculated in order to produce the exact phase delay of the feeding signal , defined by the desired oam mode .",
    "the coaxial cables are then connected to the outputs of a wilkinson power divider , which equally splits the input mode signal .",
    "the set of cables with the wilkinson power divider form the so - called beam forming network ( bfn ) .",
    "an overview of the system can be observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : overview ] . to generate the @xmath16 modes , the coaxial cables connected to the patches of the circular array have been properly tailored , in order to induce a phase delay of @xmath17 between each pair of consecutive antennas .",
    "so , it is possible to induce a cumulative azimuthal phase delay to the transmitted field in a left - handed or right - handed direction , bringing to the generation of @xmath18 modes , respectively .    we designed and optimized the entire array , starting from single patch , of @xmath19 mm width and @xmath20 mm height , which has been analyzed by means of a fem code to operate at frequency of @xmath21 ghz .",

    "the connector pin feed is centered on the non - resonant side of the patch and distant @xmath27 mm from the lower edge .",
    "we characterized the patch antennas by using a vector network analyzer ( vna ) , by measuring the proper @xmath28-parameters .",
    "@xmath29 measurements allowed to observe that the patches resonant frequency is located at @xmath21 ghz @xmath30 @xmath31 mhz . moreover , the @xmath29 values at the working frequency are below @xmath32db , thus providing a good match of the 50 @xmath33 line impedance . a measurement example",

    "all the measurements were performed in free space and collected into 2d maps .",
    "the experimental results have been compared with numerical fem based simulations .",
    "two examples of simulated and measured maps , of @xmath46 and a @xmath51 beam , are reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : l+1 ] and [ fig : l-1 ] , respectively .",
    "azimuth and elevation values reported on the map axis correspond to the coordinates of the ccr on which the tx array is mounted .",
    "so , the center of the map corresponds to the configuration in which the transmitting and receiving antennas are aligned .",
    "a good match between the expected fields and the measured ones is found .",
    "in fact , the experimental fields are characterized by a well defined doughnut distribution and the beam phase presents the characteristic vortex shape with the central singularity .",
    "vortices turn in clockwise or counterclockwise direction , according to the negative or positive oam value , by convention .",
    "we calculated , by applying friis equation @xcite to experimental results , a maximum gain of about @xmath52 dbi both for @xmath46 and a @xmath51 modes radiation patterns , in good agreement with fem simulations prediction of about @xmath53dbi .",

    "small field imprecisions generate the spurious oam modes reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : spiral_spectrum ] .",
    "this spectra confirm the good quality of the generated oam modes .",
    "the second series of experiments tested the dependence of the generated oam fields on the number of radiating patch antennas .",
    "first of all , we sampled and observed an @xmath57 field generated by eight radiating elements . in subsequent experimental steps",
    "the patch antennas were progressively disconnected one at a time up to only one connected antenna .",
    "patch antennas were switched off by disconnecting the feeding coaxial cables . in order to prevent impedance mismatch at the wilkinson output",
    ", the corresponding coaxial cables were connected to a @xmath58 dummy load .",
    "[ fig : patch_lack ] reports some meaningful examples of the field distributions , both in amplitude and phase , generated by array configurations with an even number of patches .",

    "the patches position is represented , both on amplitude and phase maps , with superimposed gray rectangles.,width=336 ]    the arrangement of the active patches has been superimposed to each figure of the amplitude field distribution .",
    "the most important aspect to be stressed is that the phase singularity is present only when the sampling theorem is satisfied .",
    "in fact , the antennas number , @xmath59 , has to satisfy the condition @xmath60 , which corresponds to @xmath61 for generating an @xmath62 mode .",
    "for this reason in fig .",
    "[ fig : patch_lack]d , corresponding to the under sampled case @xmath63 , the phase singularity is not longer present .",
    "so , when @xmath64 , the number of active elements is not enough to reproduce neither intensity nor phase profile of an @xmath65 oam mode .      here",
    "we report the experimental results of a communication system based on the mutual orthogonality of oam states .",
    "we briefly recall , in terms of geometrical properties , how the orthogonality plays a role in the oam communication .",
    "when an oam antenna , ( in our case an array and the corresponding bfn ) , is used in the reception side , it behaves as an inverse phase antenna , because of the change of propagation direction @xcite . in particular",
    ", our rx oam antenna imparts to the received mode , an azimuthal phase delay @xmath66 , being @xmath67 the angular position of the @xmath38-th patch element with @xmath39 , opposite to that it would impart if used as in transmission .",
    "since the normal vector of the rx array plane is opposite to the propagation axis of tx one , an incoming field with left - handed ( right - handed ) topological charge is sampled in a right - handed ( left - handed ) way by the rx array elements .",
    "in other words , a transmitting @xmath68 antenna receives like a @xmath47 one . as a consequence",
    ", the output field of the receiving oam antenna is characterized by the topological charge of the impinging beam , plus the topological charge of the antenna in reception mode .    in order to test an oam - based communication ,",
    "a system has been assembled with the same setup used for producing the maps presented in the previous sections .",
    "the tx array was mounted on the ccr while the rx one was fixed at a distance of 0.5 m from tx .",
    "the vna , connected to the input and output ports of the bfn at tx and rx side , respectively , measured @xmath40 parameter , both in amplitude and phase .",
    "we evaluated the channel gain for each position of the tx array .",
    "resulting data are reported on 2d maps .    in the first test",
    ", a transmitting @xmath69 antenna communicates with an identical receiving one ( @xmath70 in reception mode , according to the change of propagation direction ) . in other words ,",
    "the tx array was pre - coded by means of its bfn to produce a @xmath71 mode while the rx antenna acted in order to impart to the received field an opposite azimuthal phase delay @xmath72 . in this way , the bfn at the receiving side acts destructively on the azimuthal phase carried by the transmitted field and reset to zero the transmitted topological charge from @xmath71 to @xmath73 .",

    "the tx array set to produce a @xmath69 operates in pair with an opposite one , i.e. , a patch array with bfn set to produce a @xmath76 that acts in reception mode as a @xmath69 , as stated above .",
    "the behavior of the communication system is significantly different , because the received twisted field is transformed into an @xmath77 beam , ( see fig .",

    "an increase of the topological charge of the transmitted field is observed ( @xmath78).,width=336 ]    in this case , based on the action of the bfn at the rx side , the resulting azimuthal phase delay induced to the transmitting mode is doubled .",
    "hence , the distribution , both in intensity and phase , can be attributed to an @xmath79 mode .",
    "the split of singularities , visible in fig .",
    "[ fig : tx1rx-1 ] , is due to small imprecision in the experimental setup , as observed in a vast literature when generating high order oam modes @xcite . in our experimental setup ,",
    "deviations are mainly caused by inaccuracies of the arrays and uncertainties on the feeding lines of the patch antennas .",
    "in fact , the feeding signals are affected by little errors in amplitude and phase , as reported in tab .",
    "[ tab : tab1]-[tab : tab2 ] of the previous section .",
    "even if these errors are very small , the field patterns generated by tx array are not perfectly balanced .",
    "moreover , the signal received by the patch antennas of rx array is not equally recombined .",

    "the @xmath57 mode was generated by 8 patch antennas , pre - processed by means of a proper bfn , while the central single patch antenna generated the standard @xmath73 beam .",
    "both the @xmath73 and @xmath57 modes were fed and piloted by a signal switch connected , in turn , to the first port of the vna .",
    "these two modes were received by a single patch antenna , connected to the second port of the vna .",
    "the instrument was set to measure the @xmath40 parameter .",
    "tx and rx antennas have been positioned face to face at 0.15 m distance .",
    "rx array was kept fixed , while the tx one was bound to translate along a ruler parallel to the rx array ( see fig .",

    "this confirms the importance of the alignment for an optimal modal isolation . the curve maximum of the @xmath46 channel is higher than the @xmath15 one",
    "this is caused by the different number of active antennas ( 8 for the @xmath57 mode and one for the @xmath73 mode ) .",
    "both lines present steep edges : a little translation , with respect to the alignment position , is sufficient to cause high degradation of the power ratio . in particular , in our experimental conditions , it is sufficient @xmath84 cm shift to significantly enhance a modal interference with a drop of about @xmath85db in the power ratio .    for the sake of completeness",

    "this deviation can be mostly explained by the mathematical model applied for the simulations .",

    "the main differences concern the curves slope , especially near the peaks and their maximum values .",
    "the main differences observed between the numerical simulations and the corresponding experimental results are due to a non perfect alignment between the axis of the ccr and the one of the tx array , since it was manually placed .",
    "moreover , the mechanical limit of our setup could have caused further small misalignment during the measurements .",
    "another contribution to the mismatches is given by the non - negligible error on the ccr positioning , equal to @xmath89 according to technical data sheet .",
    "as in the previous case , the simulations have been performed considering arrays composed by elementary point - like antennas , fed by loss - less bfn .",
    "so , once again , a lower power level of experimental curves is observed .",
    "we can also notice that the peaks of the experimental power ratio are in different angular positions .",
    "this behavior can be attributed to amplitude and phase errors introduced by the bfn , as confirmed by simulated curved , obtained by introducing small random deviations in the matrices describing the bfn behavior . in conclusion , we have shown , both with simulations and experimental data , that in a communication system based on oam modes the alignment between tx and rx antennas is of paramount importance . moreover ,",
    "special attention has to be paid also to the bfn of tx and rx antennas in order to avoid unwanted inaccuracies .",
    "the results presented in the previous section show how the relative position between the rx and tx array deeply affect the communication efficiency of a line of sight ( los ) oam - based link . in order to fully exploit oam mode orthogonality , the tx and rx array planes should be aligned ( fig .",
    "[ fig : snir_tr ] , [ fig : snir_tl ] ) and at proper distance , such that the rx array efficiently couples to the main lobe ( doughnut - shaped ) of the emitted radiation . deviations from this optimal configuration , in general , deteriorates the communication performances .",
    "these geometrical constraints limit the feasibility of an oam - based communication , since the use of oam modes restricts the physical space suitable for receiving . on the other hand",
    ", this characteristic can be of special interest for applications in which it is of crucial importance that the information exchanged between tx and rx must not be intercepted by third parties , like the exchange of personal data , electronic payments , etc .",
    "we can compare an oam - based communication link with respect to a standard one , showing that the physical space in which one can be intercepted is much smaller by using oam modes .",
    "to better explain this concept , we consider an example of communication link under the following hypothesis :    * tx and rx antennas are circular arrays comprising 9 patch antennas linearly polarized . as described in section iii , one patch is equipped for the @xmath15 mode and 8 patches , placed along a circle , for the @xmath71 one ; * the mutual coupling between patches of the same array is neglected ; * system operative frequency is equal to @xmath90ghz ; * the radius of each array is equal to @xmath91 m ; * bfns of both arrays are loss - free and designed to transmit , or receive , three signals associated to the @xmath51 , @xmath15 and @xmath92 oam modes ; * the three signals are transmitted with the same power ; * tx and rx arrays are normally faced and aligned at a distance @xmath93 m , ( note that @xmath94 is smaller than the arrays fraunhofer length : @xmath95 m thus allowing oam channel multiplexing @xcite ) .",
    "the quantity @xmath94 has been calculated applying the mathematical model described in appendix and imposing , for the three channels , a snir equal to @xmath96db ; * each of the three channels supports a digital modulation whose bit error rate is negligible ( i.e. below a given threshold for which the chosen error - correction code practically yields an error - free communication ) as long as the channel snir is larger than @xmath97db ;    as mentioned in the previous section , a misalignment between tx and rx antennas causes a degradation of oam modes orthogonality and consequently an enhancement of channels cross - talking . to quantify this effect",
    ", the mathematical model described in the appendix can be adopted to calculate the channels snir at different positions of the rx array , while keeping fixed the tx one . through numerical simulation it is possible to determine the spatial bounds within which the three channels can be received without errors .",
    "the first simulation studies the effects on the snir of a parallel shift between the rx array center and the tx one , ( similarly to fig .",
    "[ fig : movements]a ) .",
    "each position of the rx array is identified by two parameters : the lateral displacement @xmath80 and the distance @xmath94 with respect to the tx array .",
    "based on the results a receiving map can be calculated .        as can be observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : map]a , the three channels can be received only in a restricted area , identified by red lines , near the alignment position . on the contrary , in the yellow zone and in the green one , at most two channels can be correctly received . as previously suggested ,",
    "this particular behavior can be exploited to enhance the communication security : if the transmitted information is split over the three channels , it is more difficult for an eavesdropper to catch and reconstruct the whole data stream exchanged between tx and rx . the only way for an eavesdropper to intercept",
    "the information is to stay very close and almost aligned to the legitimate rx .    to better appreciate the security advantage of an oam - base communication system , it is useful to repeat the calculation with a different configuration of the communication system . in this case , it has the same antenna structure but it is based on the transmission of a single channel over a traditional @xmath15 mode .",
    "the assumptions about channel modulation properties are the same .",
    "this new configuration allows to simulate the behavior of a traditional communication system and to compare it with the previous oam - based one .",
    "the results obtained from simulations are collected in the map of fig .",
    "[ fig : map]b .",
    "as can be noticed , this second map is composed only by two zones since only a single channel is involved in the communication process .",
    "moreover , the red zone where the information can be received is much larger . by comparing the two maps of fig .",
    "[ fig : map]a and b it is clear that the second configuration is more vulnerable to eavesdropping because of the larger size of the reception area .    to complete the study , it is interesting to repeat the two aforementioned simulations in presence of an angular tilt of the rx array .",
    "in particular , each position of the rx array is now identified by a tilt angle @xmath81 and by the distance @xmath94 with respect to the tx array , ( similarly to fig .",
    "[ fig : movements]b ) .",
    "all the results are collected in the maps of fig .",
    "[ fig : map]c and fig .",
    "[ fig : map]d , for the oam - based system and for the traditional one , respectively .",
    "as expected , also in this second configuration the oam based system is characterized by a slightly smaller reception area respect to the traditional one .",
    "in fact , the tilt misalignment prevent the rx array to correctly recognize the transmitted oam modes with a consequent increase of channels cross - talking .    by comparing the results of fig .",
    "[ fig : map]a - b with the ones of fig . [",
    "fig : map]c - d , it is clear that multi - channel systems can be smartly employed to enhance , the security level of traditional communication systems .",
    "to implement such solutions , different set of orthogonal radiation modes may be considered . however , among all , oam beams are of particular interest .",
    "in fact , they are characterized by a regular and symmetric distribution of the em field which can be easily predicted @xcite in a symmetric cylindrical reference system . moreover , the oam modes are naturally orthogonal but exploiting this property in a communication link strongly relies on antenna setup . as a consequence",
    ", a simple misalignment destroys modes rx orthogonality , thus enhancing channel cross - talking and preventing the reception from an unauthorized user .",
    "finally , an oam - based multiplexing system requires fixed antenna structures and do not need further digital post processing .",
    "for these reasons , the use of oam modes in the near field range should not be limited only to the increasing of communication capacity @xcite but it should be taken under consideration also to enhance the communication security in a simple and practical ways .",
    "in this work we have studied and evaluated short range los communication systems based on oam - modes multiplexing .",
    "we designed two circular arrays , composed by patch antennas , in order to generate and detect oam modes with @xmath98 value , at the frequency of @xmath21ghz .",
    "a very good agreement with theoretical predictions is found .",
    "hence , the arrays are employed as tx and rx antennas to implement a short range radio link based on @xmath98 modes .",
    "numerical and experimental investigations have shown that when tx and rx oam antennas are aligned channels exhibit high reciprocal isolation , thanks to the intrinsic modal orthogonality .",
    "this confirms and fosters the idea of oam as means for carrying high - speed information over multi - channel links with low - complexity processing @xcite .",
    "moreover , based on these results , we propose an oam - based systems to implement secure communication links that may prevent the fraudulent interception of information by eavesdroppers or third parties .",
    "the potential of this new application is confirmed also by numerical simulations in which the security enhancement of oam - based systems is clearly underlined . in conclusion , the results presented in this work confirm that oam modes are powerful tools not only to improve communication systems capacity with low complexity , but also to enhance their security down at the physical level , notwithstanding any higher - level security protocol ( cryptographic keys , authorisation systems ... ) .",
    "this appendix describes the mathematical model , based on multiple input multiple output ( mimo ) formalism @xcite , used to simulate the behavior of the communication systems previously described .",
    "+ the mathematical model of a simple mimo system can be expressed by means of linear algebra .",
    "input and output data streams are mathematically described with column vectors called @xmath99 and @xmath100 , respectively .",
    "the beam forming networks are described by two matrices : @xmath101 for the tx array and @xmath102 for the rx one .",
    "@xmath101 and @xmath102 are also be called precoder and postcoder matrices respectively .",
    "the communication channel is described by a matrix @xmath103 whose entries characterize the relationship between each couple of antennas belonging to the tx and rx arrays respectively .",
    "all these elements are related to each other by the equation : @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the white noise at the receiver and @xmath106 stands for complex conjugate operator .",
    "+ the communication systems examined in this work are composed by circular arrays , in which each data stream is transmitted over a different oam mode . for this reason ,",
    "the entries of rows and columns of pre- and post - coder matrices are equal to : @xmath107 @xmath108 where @xmath11 and @xmath109 are the oam modes to be transmitted and received , respectively ; @xmath10 ( @xmath110 ) is the number of transmitting ( receiving ) antennas and @xmath111 , @xmath112 . according to our experimental configuration ,",
    "the @xmath15 mode is transmitted by a central antenna . moreover",
    ", the model has been refined taking into account , within the ray tracing method , the directivity of the antennas .",
    "in such a way , the entries of @xmath113 have been calculated as : @xmath114 where @xmath115 is the geometric distance between each antenna element while weights @xmath116 and @xmath117 are the transmission and reception gain respectively , taken from the fem simulation data , see fig .",
    "[ fig : directivity ] .",
    "@xmath118 is the center - to - center distance between the two arrays and has been introduced in order to normalize the mimo free space loss coefficient , @xmath119 , with that of a single - input single - output ( siso ) system , @xmath120 .",
    "the siso transmitted power is equal to @xmath121 .",
    "accounting for the antennas directivity .",
    "b : example of a patch radiation pattern calculated by means of a fem simulation.,width=302 ]    using the model just described it is quite simple to determine the mimo signal to noise and interference ratio ( snir ) of each received data stream . in particular , the snir normalized with respect to the signal to noise ratio ( snr ) of a reference siso link over the same distance and with the same power and noise per channel . within a mimo system ,",
    "the snir of a data stream is defined as : @xmath122 where @xmath123 is the stream received power while @xmath123 and @xmath124 are the interference and noise powers respectively .",
    "now , letting each stream to be transmitted with a power equal to @xmath125 it is possible to express eq .",

    "it results that : @xmath126 , @xmath127 and @xmath128 where the @xmath129 and @xmath130 coefficients come from the matrices @xmath131 and @xmath132 .",
    "finally , remembering that for the siso reference link the snr is equal to @xmath133 it results that @xmath134",
