    "human neuroscience has garnered increasing attention in recent years as functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fmri ) experiments have become more easily accessible and their results have found immediate application in cognitive studies .",
    "data obtained from fmri or anatomical experiments allow us to construct coarse - grained neural networks associated with given neural activities .",
    "this advanced technique provides new insight into understanding of the mechanisms and efficiency of the diverse neural activities of our brain network .",
    "one such subject is the retrieval of associative memory of neural networks  @xcite .",
    "new memories are initially labile and can be stabilized into long - term memories through retrieval and re - consolidation processes . in neurobiology",
    ", the memory retrieval process has been investigated from the perspective of local protein synthesis .",
    "however , it has been proposed in statistical physics that memory retrieval in our brain occurs by way of pattern recognition of collective excitations of associated neurons . in this regard , a spin model ,",
    "the hopfield model  @xcite introduced a long time ago has since become a paradigmatic model for memory retrieval in neural networks .",
    "the hopfield model was analytically solved for fully connected networks , known as the mean - field solution  @xcite .",
    "recently , however , fmri and anatomical experiments have revealed that human neural networks are scale - free ( sf ) networks  @xcite .",
    "this means that the number of synapses of each neuron , referred to as the degree in graph theory , is heterogeneous and their distribution follows the power law @xmath0 , where @xmath1 denotes the degree and @xmath2 is the degree exponent , or a heavy - tailed distribution  @xcite .",
    "particularly , we notice that the degree exponent obtained from the fmri data is close to @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the functionality of an individual neuron is partly determined by the pattern of its anatomical connections with other neurons in the brain network , so that neurons with similar connection patterns tend to exhibit similar functionality  @xcite .",
    "it is thus possible to infer that such fmri results on the functional connectivities reflect the structural sf feature of the brain networks on the neuron - to - neuron scale .",
    "for instance , the brains of schizophrenia  @xcite or comatose patients  @xcite may be related to the malfunction of the hub of heterogeneous networks on the neuron - to - neuron scale .",
    "therefore , it is expected that a hopfield neural network model structured on sf networks composed of numerous neuron vertices may be very helpful to understand some specific features of realistic brain networks .",
    "this paper aims to investigate the properties of retrieval patterns created by the hopfield model on sf networks in the limit @xmath4 using analytic method and to compare the obtained results with previous numerical results obtained from the fully connected networks and diverse sf networks such as the barabsi - albert model with @xmath5  @xcite and the molloy - reed model with several values of @xmath2 but in extremely narrow range of storage capacity @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "we also use the chung - lu model  @xcite for constructing uncorrelated sf networks over the entire range of @xmath2 .",
    "the details of the chung - lu model are presented in appendix  [ appen : chung_lu ] .",
    "using the replica method , we analytically obtain the phase diagram of the hopfield model for various degree exponent values ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] ) : when @xmath7 , the retrieval phase spans most of the low - temperature region , thus the system is enhanced for memory retrieval . at @xmath8 , error rate is obtained as a function of storage capacity @xmath6 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] ) .",
    "remarkably for sf networks with @xmath9 , our result shows that the error rate is almost zero when the number of stored memories @xmath10 is a few , and gradually increases but is less than 0.3 even when @xmath10 is increased up the total number of nodes in a network .",
    "this implies that the storage capacity is unlimited in the thermodynamic limit , but with some error . in short ,",
    "our findings suggest that the memory retrieval capacity is tremendously enhanced in the sf network , but with some error .",
    "these features seem to be in accordance with what we experience from our ordinary brain and to a recent discovery of enormously high storage capacity in human brain  @xcite .",
    "in the hopfield model , each neuron in a neural network is regarded as an ising spin with spin states representing excited and rest states for transmitting or not transmitting a signal , respectively  @xcite .",
    "memory is regarded as a collective pattern of neuron excitations .",
    "an excitation pattern of a neural network is denoted by @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the index of the neuron , @xmath13 is the index of the excitation pattern , and @xmath10 is the number of existing patterns , equivalent to the number of stored memories . the value of @xmath14 is either @xmath15 or @xmath16 .",
    "the state of the ising spin at each neuron is updated with time as @xmath17 such that @xmath18 is affected by the states of functionally connected neurons at time @xmath19 .",
    "the coupling strength @xmath20 , known as the synapse efficacy , for sf network is defined as @xmath21 following hebb s rule , where @xmath22 is the mean degree of a given chung - lu sf network @xmath23 of size @xmath24 .",
    "the time evolution is explored using the hamiltonian @xmath25 where the @xmath12-th spin value , i.e. , the state of @xmath12-th neuron , is assumed as @xmath26 , and @xmath20 is assumed symmetric @xmath27 , and @xmath20 is set zero for any disconnections in @xmath23 .",
    "the probability for a given graph @xmath23 to exist over ensemble is given as @xmath28 where @xmath29 .",
    "then the graph ensemble average for a given physical quantity @xmath30 is taken as @xmath31 where @xmath32 denotes the average over different graph configurations .",

    "a retrieval pattern is recognized as a spin state at the free energy minimum . in this approach , temperature @xmath39",
    "is involved , which represents the noise strength from a stochastic process of the system .",
    "the replica method is conventionally used to evaluate the free energy  @xcite .",
    "using the replica trick , the free energy @xmath40 is evaluated as @xmath41/n$ ] , where @xmath42 is the partition function for a given distribution of @xmath43 on a particular graph @xmath23 and @xmath44 . by evaluating the @xmath45-th power of the partition function @xmath46",
    ", we obtain the free energy as shown in eq .",
    "( [ eq : free_energy ] ) in appendix  [ appen : hopfield ] . for simplicity , only the first pattern @xmath47",

    "this simplification is based on the fact that the replica symmetry only appears to be broken in a particular case at @xmath48  @xcite .",
    "the mathematical details can be found in appendix  [ appen : rep_symm_sol ] .",
    "we characterize the phases of the hopfield model by three order parameters defined as follows : i ) the overlap parameter defined as @xmath49 , which represents the extent to which the @xmath33-th pattern of memory @xmath50 and the @xmath51-th state of the system @xmath52 overlap with each other .",
    "this quantity is used to measure the retrieval success rate of the @xmath33-th memory .",
    "ii ) the spin glass order parameter @xmath53 representing the extent to which the two states @xmath51 and @xmath54 of the replica overlap each other .",

    "henceforth , we denote @xmath56 as the storage capacity @xmath6 , because we are interested in the case @xmath57 .",
    "this quantity is necessary to derive the first two order parameters , and is interpreted as the sum of the effects of each non - retrieval pattern .",
    "we remark that the overlap and the spin - glass order parameters are defined similarly to those of the mean - field solution , but the factor @xmath58 appears , which is required to take into account heterogeneous degrees .",
    "@xmath58 is proportional to the degree @xmath59 of neuron @xmath12  @xcite .",
    "next , we take the replica - symmetric solution by setting @xmath60 and @xmath61 for all @xmath62 and @xmath63 for all @xmath51 .",
    "explicit formulas for those parameters are presented in appendix  [ appen : rep_symm_sol ] .",
    "the phase diagram we obtained are as follows : fig .  1 shows the phase diagrams of the hopfield model in the @xmath64 plane for different values of @xmath2 of sf networks with @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "first , we consider the case of the erds and rnyi ( er ) network , equivalent to the limit @xmath67 . the phase diagram shown in fig .",
    "1(a ) is similar to that in ref .",
    "@xcite , obtained from a fully connected network .",
    "four different phases exist : i ) the paramagnetic phase denoted as p , in which @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 because of thermal fluctuations .",
    "ii ) the spin - glass phase denoted as sg , in which @xmath68 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 . in this phase ,",
    "the retrieval of stored patterns is not possible .",
    "thus , it is often referred to as the confusion phase .",
    "iii ) the retrieval phase denoted as r , in which @xmath73 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 , and in which the retrieval of stored memory is possible .",
    "finally , the mixed phase denoted as m , in which the patterns of both the retrieval and the spin - glass phases coexist .",
    "the free energy of the system in each phase has also been investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite . in phase r , a stored pattern , for instance ,",
    "@xmath74 is matched to a state of the system @xmath75 at the global minimum of free energy .",
    "however , in phase m , a stored pattern is matched to a state of the system in a metastable state , while the sg state lies at the global minimum .",
    "for @xmath76 , which occurs when @xmath57 in the limit @xmath77 , there exist two phases , p and r. as @xmath6 is increased slightly from @xmath78 , the sg and m phases appear between the phases p and r. the transition between the p and the sg phases is a second - order transition , whereas that between sg and m is a first - order transition .",
    "likewise , the transition between m and r is also first order . at @xmath48 ,",
    "the transition between r and m occurs at @xmath79 , and the transition between m and sg occurs at @xmath80 .",
    "therefore , as temperature is lowered from a sufficiently high value , successive transitions occur following the steps p @xmath81 sg @xmath81 m @xmath81 r for @xmath82 . for @xmath83 ,",
    "successive transitions occur following the steps p @xmath81 sg @xmath81 m , and for @xmath84 , a transition from p @xmath81 sg occurs .",
    "second , we obtain the phase diagram for finite @xmath2 values . the phase diagram in fig .",
    "1(b)-(e ) undergoes drastic changes depending on @xmath2 .",
    "remarkably , the r phase intrudes into the region of the sg phase , but it also raises the boundary of the p phase to a higher - temperature region . as @xmath2 approaches 2.04 in fig .",
    "1(e ) , we observe that the r phase prevails , whereas the sg phase shrinks until it only exists at @xmath48 in the region @xmath85 .",
    "such changes in the @xmath64 diagrams can be understood analytically by examining the phase boundary between the p and sg phases .",
    "the details are presented in appendix  [ appen : phase ] .",
    "third , we consider a particular case , the noiseless case @xmath48 .",
    "the order parameters @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 are derived in appendix  [ appen : rep_symm_sol ] .",
    "2 shows the behavior of the error rate @xmath89 as a function of @xmath6 on sf networks with @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "this figure is obtained analytically for various degree exponent values including @xmath90 .",
    "we first consider the case in which @xmath67 , i.e. , the er limit .",
    "the result of this case is almost the same as that obtained in ref .",
    "when @xmath6 is less than @xmath80 , @xmath91 is very small , such that the error rate is negligible and the system is almost in the error - free state .",
    "the obtained value @xmath92 is close to @xmath93 , which is obtained from the fully connected network in ref .",
    "@xcite . as @xmath6",
    "is increased and reaches @xmath92 , @xmath91 suddenly jumps to 0.5 .",
    "this means that for @xmath84 , the system is in the error - full state ( i.e. , the state of complete confusion ) . as @xmath2 decreases , this behavior persists up to @xmath94 , and no longer holds for @xmath95 .",
    "note that the value of @xmath92 slightly decreases with decreasing @xmath2 , but their dependences are almost negligible .",
    "next , when @xmath2 approaches 2.0 , @xmath91 noticeably changes in its form from the step - function - like shape to a monotonously increasing one . as @xmath2 is lowered further and approaches @xmath96 , the range of @xmath6 for the state of complete confusion , with @xmath97 , disappears and @xmath92 can not be defined anymore .",
    "for instance , at @xmath9 , the error rate becomes less than @xmath98 for the entire range of @xmath6 .",
    "therefore , when @xmath2 is lowered to as small as 2.0 , while the range of @xmath6 for the state of @xmath99 ( the state of perfect retrieval without error ) is reduced , the range of @xmath6 for the state of @xmath97 ( the state of complete confusion ) disappears .",
    "the details are presented in appendix  [ appen : error_rate ] .",
    "these behaviors have never been observed yet in previous studies  @xcite .",
    "our results might provide some insight into constructing a certain artificial neural network ( ann ) : if we want to construct an ann that contains a function of perfect memory recall with a large value of @xmath92 as a basic topology of the ann , it may be more appropriate to choose an er - type random network or a fully connected one .",
    "however , should we prefer to construct an ann that sustains a large range of storage capacity , but only allows a small range of errors , it may be more appropriate to choose an sf - type network with @xmath90 .",
    "our main results imply that as the network changes from a hub - damaged network to a scale - free network with degree exponent two , the memory retrieval capacity is tremendously enhanced , but with some error .",
    "these features seem to be in accordance with what we experience from our ordinary brain and to a recent discovery of enormously high storage capacity in human brain .",
    "thus , hubs , i.e. , neurons with a large number of synapses , and other nodes with heterogeneous degrees in neural networks , play a central role in enhancing the capacity of memory retrieval .",
    "it is interesting to notice that a normal human brain has such a structure , even though detailed structural properties such as modularity and degree correlation are different .",
    "we consider the effect of degree correlation near @xmath100 by performing similar analysis for the static model  @xcite of which the degree correlation is disassortative between @xmath101 we find that the correlated sf networks in the vicinity of @xmath102 have lower values of @xmath91 compared with those of the uncorrelated ones . the details are presented in appendix  [ appen : static ] .",
    "finally , we have checked the error rate @xmath103 on several real neural networks , of which the degree distributions are heavy - tailed , but the degree exponent can not be determined precisely due to the small system sizes of those networks .",
    "the obtained patterns of the error rates are indeed similar to what we predicted theoretically . the details are presented in appendix  [ appen : real_nets ] .",

    "a pair of vertices @xmath109 is chosen with the probabilities @xmath58 and @xmath110 , respectively , and they are connected with an edge , unless the pair is already connected . this process is repeated @xmath111 times .",
    "then , the resulting network becomes an uncorrelated sf network following a power - law degree distribution , @xmath112 , where @xmath1 denotes the degree and @xmath2 is the degree exponent with @xmath113 .",
    "in such random networks , the probability that a given pair of vertices @xmath109 ( @xmath114 ) is not connected by an edge , as denoted by @xmath115 , is given by @xmath116 , while the connection probability @xmath117 .",
    "as a particular case , when we choose @xmath107 as 1 for all the values of @xmath33 , the cl model reduces to the static model @xcite , which has correlations for the range of @xmath118 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the weights for the static model are given by @xmath119 where @xmath33 is a control parameter in the range @xmath106 , and @xmath120 .",
    "note that @xmath121 for finite @xmath22 , however , @xmath122 for @xmath123 and @xmath124 .    for the erds - rnyi ( er ) graph @xcite ,",
    "@xmath33 becomes 0 and the weights of both models become @xmath125 , independent of the index @xmath12 . since @xmath126 ,",
    "the fraction of bonds present becomes @xmath127 and the total number of the connected edges @xmath128 is @xmath111 .",
    "so @xmath22 becomes the mean degree in the er graph .    when @xmath22 approaches @xmath24 , this network becomes a fully - connected one or a regular lattice with infinite - range interaction .",
    "note that previous studies on the hopfield model focused mainly on such extreme cases of @xmath129 @xcite .",
    "now we consider the hopfield model on sf networks . since amit _",
    "successfully applied replica analysis of spin glass theory to the hopfield model @xcite , neural networks have been regarded as analogous systems of spin glasses ( sgs ) @xcite . the sg transitions in euclidean space have already been studied by means of various theoretical methods @xcite .",
    "most of such studies have been carried out on regular lattices or for the infinite - range interaction model on fully connected graphs . to study the sg transitions on sf networks",
    ", we followed the previous approach used for the dilute ising sg model with infinite - range interactions , i.e. , the ising sg model on the er graph , first performed by viana and bray @xcite , and applied it successfully to the static model of sf networks @xcite .",
    "the ghatak - sherrington sg model was also studied on the same networks @xcite .    here",
    ", the replica method is used to evaluate the free energy , i.e. , @xmath130/n$ ] . to proceed ,",

    "the @xmath137 term can be linearized using the hubbard - stratonovich transformation    @xmath141    therefore ,      in the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath143 ) , we expand @xmath144 to the second order of @xmath145 , so that    @xmath146 \\nonumber\\\\ \\simeq \\exp \\bigg [ - \\frac{1}{2 }   nk \\mathbf{t}_{1 } \\sum_{\\mu = 2}^{p } \\sum_{\\alpha \\beta}^{n } m_{\\alpha}^{\\mu } k_{\\alpha \\beta } m_{\\beta}^{\\mu } \\bigg],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath147 . since eq.(16 ) is quadratic in @xmath145 , the integral over @xmath145 can be carried out using of the multi - variable gaussian integral as follows :    @xmath148 \\simeq   ( \\mathrm{det } \\mathbf{k})^{-(p-1)/2 } \\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\int \\prod_{(\\alpha \\beta)}^{n } d q_{\\alpha \\beta }   ~\\delta \\big ( q_{\\alpha \\beta }   -   \\sum_{i}^{n } w_{i } s_{i}^{\\alpha }   s_{i}^{\\beta } \\big )   \\exp \\big ( - \\frac{p-1}{2}~\\textrm{tr}_{n } \\ln \\ { \\mathbf{i } - k \\mathbf{t}_{1 } ( \\mathbf{i } + \\mathbf{q } ) \\ }",

    "the matrix @xmath156 consists of zeros along the diagonal elements and the off - diagonal elements @xmath155 .",

    "otherwise , the resulting integral diverges and the saddle point procedure fails .",

    "such a @xmath2-dependence of @xmath86 determines the behavior of the error rate @xmath91 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] .",

    "first , figs .",
    "[ figs1](*a * ) and ( * b * ) show the phase diagrams for the static model with ( a ) @xmath227 and ( b ) @xmath228 , which correspond to the figs .",
    "[ figs1](e ) and ( f ) of the main paper for the cl model .",
    "these phase diagrams for the static model are similar qualitatively to those for the cl model , but the transitions temperature between p and r phases obtained for the static model is somewhat larger than the one for the cl model .",
    "[ figs2 ] is the plot of the error rate @xmath89 vs storage capacity @xmath6 at zero temperature for the two different @xmath2 values for the static model .",
    "this figure corresponds to fig .",

    "[ figs3 ] show the comparison of the error rate for the two different models , the cl and the static models as a function of storage rate @xmath6 for different degree exponent values ( a ) @xmath228 and ( b ) @xmath231 at @xmath48 .",
    "these figures enable us to see qualitatively how the error rate depends on the degree - degree correlation .",
    "we recall that the disassortative degree - degree correlation is present for the static model in the region @xmath232 , but absent for the cl model .",
    "one can see that the degree - degree correlation reduces somewhat the error rate .",
    "accordingly one may infer that the error rate of realistic brain networks , in which the degree - degree correlation is present , should be smaller than those obtained from the cl model analytically .",
    "we check the error rate @xmath91 of the hopfield model on several real neural networks . for this purpose , we chose three real neural networks : the networks for macaque monkey 1 ( fve30 ; @xmath233 , @xmath234 ) @xcite , macaque monkey 2 ( macaque47 ; @xmath235 , @xmath236 ) @xcite and cat ( cijctx ; @xmath237 , @xmath238 ) @xcite .",
    "those networks are constructed based on the connectivity network data sets  @xcite . for the cat network ,",
    "all links with nonzero elements ( 1,2 and 3 ) of the adjacency matrix were regarded as connected .",
    "our simulations are performed following the random updating method of the hopfield model on those real neural networks : an excitation pattern of a neural network is denoted by @xmath239 , where @xmath12 is the index of the neuron , @xmath13 is the index of the excitation pattern , and @xmath10 is the number of existing patterns , equivalent to the number of stored memories . the value of @xmath14 is either @xmath15 or @xmath16 .",
    "an initial spin configuration of each neural network is set to be the first pattern , i.e. , @xmath240 for each node @xmath12 .",
    "once this spin configuration is set up , at the next step @xmath241 , a neuron @xmath12 is randomly chosen , its ising spin state is updated asynchronously as @xmath242 where the synapse efficacy @xmath20 is taken as @xmath243 following the hebb s rule , and @xmath244 is the mean degree of a given real neural network . if @xmath245 becomes zero , then @xmath246 takes + 1 definitely .",
    "this updating is repeated until the system reaches a stable fixed point , which is supposed to be the energy minimum state of the system .",
    "thus the retrieved pattern is the spin configuration in the energy minimum state .",
    "the error rate @xmath247 is finally calculated using the formula @xmath248 with @xmath249 .",
    "this whole procedure completes one run .",
    "we perform @xmath250 different runs with @xmath250 different ensemble of @xmath74 , and then obtain the error rate @xmath103 over those ensemble .",
    "[ figs4 ] shows the degree distributions ( left column ) and the error rates ( right column ) of those three different real neural networks .",
    "the degree distributions of three networks are heavy - tailed , but the degree exponents can not be determined precisely due to the small system sizes of those networks .",
    "to compare the error rates obtained from the simulations with the ones from the theory , we draw the error rates obtained from both methods together in the right column of fig .",
    "[ figs4 ] .",
    "indeed , with appropriate weight @xmath251 near @xmath252 , the two error rates behave similarly to each other as a function of the storage capacity .",

    "<S> the hopfield model is a paradigmatic model for understanding neural activities associated with memory retrieval in view of the collective behavior of neurons . </S>",
    "<S> the analytical solution of the model on fully connected networks revealed that information stored in the memory can be retrieved without any error up to a certain threshold of storage capacity , beyond which the information is completely lost . a normal human brain , however , has imperfect memory with some error even when its storage capacity is small . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , it has not yet been proven whether such a storage capacity threshold exists . here </S>",
    "<S> , we show analytically that as the network changes from a hub - damaged network ( e.g. , shown in brains of schizophrenia or comatose patients ) to a scale - free network ( e.g. , shown in brains of ordinary people ) with degree exponent two ( close to the degree exponent value of the networks constructed from fmri experimental data ) , the memory retrieval capacity is tremendously enhanced , but with some error . </S>",
