    "in recent years , an increasing number of new transients with unusual properties have been discovered thanks to the advent of modern , wide - field optical transient surveys , such as the texas supernova search ( tss , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) the catalina real - time transient survey ( crts , drake et al .",
    "2009 ) , the palomar transient factory ( ptf , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the panoramic survey telescope and rapid response system ( pan - starrs , * ? ? ?",
    "many new objects have been found in regions of the time - scale / luminosity parameter space unexplored before ( e.g. faint and/or fast evolving transients ) or were located in regions of the sky undersampled by traditional _ targeted_-surveys ( transients in faint hosts or in the outskirts of bright galaxies ) .",
    "driven by their observed characteristics , attempts have been made to arrange these novel transients in new classes , trying also to revise the classification of historical sne in the context of non - standard scenarios .",
    "in particular , major efforts have been made to theoretically explain new transients that may not be due to the canonical mechanisms of iron core collapse or the thermonuclear explosion of near - chandrasekhar - mass white dwarfs .    among these new transients ,",
    "a wide group of peculiar hydrogen - free supernovae ( sne ) has recently been studied in detail ( including sn  2008 ha : @xcite ; sn",
    "2005e : @xcite ; sn  2002bj : @xcite ; sn  2010x : @xcite ; sn  2005cz : @xcite ; ptf09dav : @xcite ; sn  2010et / ptf10iuv : @xcite ) .    sne  2002bj and 2010x are two rapidly declining sne @xcite . however , beyond the fast evolution they have in common , they differ in absolute magnitude and photospheric velocities . if the light curve is powered by @xmath4ni decay , their fast evolution indicates a very small ejected mass ( e.g. 0.16 for sn  2010x , * ? ? ?",
    "accretion - induced collapse of an o - ne - mg white dwarf @xcite , a thermonuclear helium shell detonation on a white dwarf @xcite and fallback core collapse @xcite are the most common scenarios proposed to explain these two sne .",
    "sn  2008 ha is probably the faintest hydrogen poor sn ever studied so far .",
    "its extremely low photospheric velocity and fast light - curve evolution ( but not as fast as in the rapidly declining sne mentioned above ) are consistent with a very low mass and kinetic energy @xcite . given these characteristics , the same models as mentioned above have been proposed to explain sn  2008 ha .",
    "however , a few additional models have been suggested , including fe or one core - collapse triggered by electron captures @xcite or a failed deflagration of a carbon oxygen white dwarf @xcite .",
    "recently , due to its spectral similarity with sn 2002cx , sn 2008 ha has been included as a low - velocity and low - mass member of the sn  iax subclass @xcite .",
    "sne  iax include objects with spectra similar to those of sn  2002cx , but that show a wide range of line velocities and luminosities @xcite .",
    "most sne belonging to this class exploded in late - type galaxies .    in this paper",
    ", we will mostly focus on a group of objects often referred to as ` ca - rich transients ' @xcite",
    ". these are faint type i sne , which reach peak absolute magnitudes of @xmath5 and exhibit photospheric expansion velocities of @xmath111000 .",
    "they preferentially occur in the outskirts of their presumed host galaxies @xcite and their designation stems from prevalent [ ] lines that dominate their spectra soon after maximum .",
    "the first recognized member of this class is sn 2005e , for which @xcite inferred a calcium mass of 0.135 , which is much larger than ever seen in other sne , combined with a very low total ejected mass ( @xmath1 0.3 ) .",
    "its location , the he - rich spectra , the low luminosity , and the small ejected mass led @xcite to suggest a helium detonation on a helium - accreting white dwarf .",
    "other members of this group of objects are sn  2005cz , sn  2010et and ptf11bij .",
    "they all show strong ca lines , he lines in early spectra , weak o features in late spectra , a modest luminosity and a fast transition to the nebular phase .",
    "the latter property is a robust evidence of a small ejecta mass ."
