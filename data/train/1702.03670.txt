    "recently , the voltage control of magnetism without electric current has been extensively studied in order to achieve minimum power consumption and device miniaturization in next - generation of spintronics.@xcite such a control is usually implemented through the magnetoelectric ( me ) coupling in heterostructures which possess coupled magnetic and electric properties .",
    "generally , in me heterostructures voltage can control the magnetism through the interfacial mechanisms such as elastic coupling via strain transfer,@xcite charge modulation,@xcite interface bonding,@xcite and exchange coupling.@xcite for the ferromagnetic / ferroelectric heterostructures , elastic coupling mechanism is most extensively investigated , i.e. a strain generated in a ferroelectric layer by a voltage is transferred to the ferromagnetic layer through the interface and thus can be used to tailor magnetization through the magnetoelastic coupling .",
    "the elastic coupling mechanism can work at the bulk level .",
    "all the other three mechanisms are localized to the region near the interface . among them",
    ", the exchange coupling is localized , but can induce propagation of the magnetization into the bulk .",
    "they offer more freedom to design reasonable and optimum nanoscale devices in which the interface plays a critical role .    by using these various mechanisms ,",
    "a voltage induced 180@xmath0 magnetization switching is of great interests .",
    "for example , in order to achieve a high signal - to - noise ratio in magnetic tunnel junction ( mtj ) , a significantly large electric resistance change of mtj is required , which can only be achieved by a 180@xmath0 switching in the free layer of mtj .",
    "trailblazing experiments have demonstrated strain - mediated , charge - mediated , and exchange - coupling - mediated voltage - driven 180@xmath0 switching in ni / batio@xmath3,@xcite bifeo@xmath3-based,@xcite and cofeb / mgo / cofeb@xcite heterostructures , respectively . from the theoretical point , a large number of studies are devoted to the strain - mediated 180@xmath0 switching either by designing the shape of magnets@xcite or by using the 3d precessional switching dynamics.@xcite however , since the substrate of the layered me thin heterostructures is usually clamped , the strain transfer is limited .",
    "the realization of strain - mediated commercial devices still remains challengeable due to some practical issues such as fatigue .",
    "alternatively , interface charge modulation has been deemed as an ideal way for realizing magnetic switching in thin film heterostructures.@xcite but most of the experimental and theoretical investigations show a charge - mediated magnetization switching between two states which are not exactly rotated by 180@xmath0 , i.e. not a 180@xmath0 switching.@xcite meanwhile , most studies deal with the thin film structure with a lateral size of several hundred nanometers to several micrometers or with a thickness of several tens nanometers . in such cases ,",
    "the magnet volume is relatively large so that the temperature effect on the switching dynamics is often ignored,@xcite or shown to be not so strong.@xcite however , in terms of the device miniaturization , if spintronic devices are further scaled down to nanodot shape , i.e. with the size of several tens of nanometers in the lateral direction , the huge reduction of the magnet volume will intensify the temperature effect . for instance , the granular film with @xmath4-ordered fept epitaxially grown on mgo substrate , which has been considered as a promising candidate for memory devices , usually contains fept nanograins with a size of several nanometers to several tens of nanometers.@xcite if such a small - scaled fept / mgo heterostructure is utilized , the consideration of temperature effect is indispensable .    in this work , we take epitaxial pt / fept / mgo heterostructures as a model system with a lateral size of several tens of nanometers . combining first - principles calculation and temperature - dependent magnetization dynamics",
    ", we demonstrate the deterministic in - plane and perpendicular 180@xmath0 magnetization switching at room temperature .",
    "it is anticipated that the present study provides valuable insight into the design of voltage control of both in - plane and perpendicular 180@xmath0 switching at room temperature for achieving low - power , high - speed , non - volatile , and highly compact spintronics .",
    "[ s2 ] the material model system for first - principles calculations is shown in fig . [ f1](a ) . since the lattice parameter of bulk mgo is @xmath5 @xmath6 and that of fept is @xmath7 @xmath6 , the lattice mismatch is up to @xmath8 . in experiments ,",
    "mgo with tunable lattice strain can be epitaxially grown at different temperature on different substrates like cu,@xcite , ge,@xcite si,@xcite etc .",

[ eq1 ] in methods ) . in the case of an in - plane 180@xmath0 switching ,",
    "the magnetic easy axis is along the semimajor axis when there is no electric field .",
    "the in - plane 180@xmath0 switching means the magnetization switching from the positive semimajor axis to the negative one , or vice versa .",
    "these two equivalent in - plane easy axes guarantee a non - volatile effect , i.e. when the 180@xmath0 switching is achieved the associated magnetization state will be kept even after the removal of the electric field . the necessary conditions for",
    "the 180@xmath0 switching imply two criteria .",
    "firstly , @xmath2 is small enough to ensure a magnetic easy plane when there is no electric field , i.e. @xmath26 ( eq [ eq1 ] ) in methods ) .",
    "secondly , after applying a positive electric field , @xmath2 is increased to be high enough to achieve a perpendicular easy axis , i.e. @xmath27 . using the criterion @xmath28 , we can estimate the conditions for the possible 180@xmath0 switching , as shown in fig . [ f4](a ) . it can be found that a positive electric field and a small range of @xmath9 potentiate an in - plane 180@xmath0 switching . since more negative @xmath9 already gives rise to larger k at zero electric field ( fig .",
    "[ f3 ] ) , a small increase in k is enough to overcome the in - plane shape anisotropy energy and thus a small positive electric field is sufficient .",
    "this leads to the lower - triangular shape in fig . [",

    ", the perpendicular 180@xmath0 switching denotes the magnetization switching from the positive perpendicular axis to the negative one , or vice versa .",
    "two criteria required by the necessary conditions for the perpendicular 180@xmath0 switching are opposite to those for the in - plane 180@xmath0 switching . on one hand , without electric field @xmath2 should be large enough to ensure a perpendicular magnetic easy axis .",

    "the magnetization possesses the equal possibility to revert back or go forwards . only by using the 3d precessional switching dynamics of magnetization,@xcite a deterministic 180@xmath0 switching can be achieved when the pulse width of the electric field is controlled . in the following ,",

    "thereby the thermal fluctuation of torque should be considered , as explained in the methods .",
    "here we do not perform the temperature - dependent first - principles calculations , but focus on the temperature effect in magnetization dynamics . even in the equilibrium states without electric field ,",

    "[ f8](a ) that at 0 k , the 180@xmath0 switching is deterministic and possesses a characteristic switching time .",

    "<S> voltage - driven 180@xmath0 magnetization switching without electric current provides the possibility for revolutionizing the spintronics . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrated the voltage - driven charge - mediated 180@xmath0 magnetization switching at room temperature by combining first - principles calculations and temperature - dependent magnetization dynamics simulation . </S>",
    "<S> the electric field ( @xmath1 ) induced interface charge is found to allow a giant modulation of the magnetic anisotropy ( @xmath2 ) of the nanomagnet . </S>",
    "<S> particularly @xmath2 is revealed to vary linearly with respect to @xmath1 and the epitaxial strain . </S>",
    "<S> magnetization dynamics simulations using the so - obtained @xmath2 show that both in - plane and perpendicular 180@xmath0 switching can be achieved by @xmath1 pulses . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature effect renders the 180@xmath0 switching as probability events . statistical analysis indicates a fast ( around 2 ns ) and deterministic 180@xmath0 switching achievable at room temperature by controlling the magnitude of e and the pulse width . </S>",
    "<S> the study inspires the rational design of miniaturized nanoscale spintronic devices where finite temperature effect has a great impact . </S>"
