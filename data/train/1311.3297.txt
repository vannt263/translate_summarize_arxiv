    "the problem of approximating the ground energy of a given hamiltonian is a natural quantum analog of classical constraint satisfaction .",
    "many authors have considered the computational complexity of such quantum ground state problems . for a variety of classes of hamiltonians and a suitable notion of approximation , this task is complete for the complexity class qma , the quantum version of np with two - sided error ( see reference @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "these results provide evidence that approximating the ground energy of such quantum systems is likely intractable .",
    "the first such example is the local hamiltonian problem introduced by kitaev @xcite .",
    "a @xmath2-local hamiltonian acts on a system of @xmath0 qubits and can be written as a sum of terms , each acting nontrivially on at most @xmath2 qubits .",
    "the @xmath2-local hamiltonian problem is a promise problem related to the task of approximating the ground energy of a @xmath2-local hamiltonian .",
    "given such a hamiltonian and two thresholds @xmath3 and @xmath4 , one is asked to determine if the ground energy is below @xmath3 or above @xmath4 ( promised that one of these conditions holds ) .",
    "kitaev s original work showed that the @xmath5-local hamiltonian problem is qma - complete @xcite ; subsequent works proved qma - completeness of the @xmath6-local hamiltonian problem @xcite , the @xmath1-local hamiltonian problem @xcite , and the @xmath1-local hamiltonian problem with interactions between qubits restricted to a two - dimensional lattice @xcite .",
    "the complexity of similar computational problems related to other classes of hamiltonians has also been considered .",
    "these include hamiltonians in one dimension @xcite , frustration - free hamiltonians @xcite , and stoquastic hamiltonians ( hamiltonians with no `` sign problem '' ) @xcite , among others .",
    "the qma - hardness of ground energy problems for local hamiltonians acting on qubits has implications for hamiltonians acting on indistinguishable particles ( bosons or fermions ) due to formal mappings between these systems . by applying such mappings to the local hamiltonian problem",
    ", one can show that certain bosonic @xcite and fermionic @xcite hamiltonian problems are qma - hard .",
    "a more restrictive class of qma - complete fermionic hamiltonians was considered by schuch and verstraete , who showed that the hubbard model with a site - dependent magnetic field is qma - complete @xcite .",
    "this is a specific model of interacting electrons ( i.e. , spin-@xmath7 fermions ) on a two - dimensional lattice , with a magnetic field that may take different values and point in different directions ( in three dimensions ) at distinct sites of the lattice .",
    "many of the qma - complete problems considered previously have the property that the form of the terms in the hamiltonian is part of the specification of the instance .",
    "for example , a @xmath1-local hamiltonian is specified by a @xmath1-local hermitian operator for each pair of qubits . in the hubbard model considered in reference @xcite ,",
    "there is a similar freedom in the choice of magnetic field at each site .",
    "in contrast , here we consider a system of interacting bosons with fixed movement and interaction terms .",
    "specifically , we consider the bose - hubbard model , which has one of the simplest interactions between particles that conserves total particle number . although the bose - hubbard model is traditionally defined on a lattice @xcite , here we consider its natural extension to a general graph .",
    "we consider undirected graphs without multiple edges and with at most one self - loop per vertex .",
    "any such graph @xmath8 ( with vertex set @xmath9 ) can be specified by its adjacency matrix , a symmetric @xmath10-@xmath11 matrix denoted @xmath12 . the bose - hubbard model on @xmath8 with hopping strength @xmath13 and",
    "interaction strength @xmath14 has the hamiltonian @xmath15 where @xmath16 creates a boson at vertex @xmath17 and @xmath18 counts the number of bosons at vertex @xmath17 .",
    "our results apply to the bose - hubbard model for any fixed positive hopping strength @xmath19 and any fixed positive ( i.e. , repulsive ) interaction strength @xmath20 . unlike in other qma - completeness results , in our work the coefficients @xmath21 are not inputs to the problem ; rather , each fixed choice defines a computational problem and we prove qma - completeness for each of them .",
    "observe that the bose - hubbard hamiltonian conserves the total number of particles @xmath22 .",
    "we focus on the space of @xmath23-particle states , which can be identified with the symmetric subspace of @xmath24 ( as we discuss in more detail in ) . the first term in allows particles to move between vertices ;",
    "the second term is an interaction between particles that assigns an energy penalty for each vertex occupied by more than one particle .",
    "the bose - hubbard model is an example of a multi - particle quantum walk , a generalization of quantum walk to systems with more than one walker .",
    "recently we showed that the bose - hubbard model on a graph can perform efficient universal quantum computation @xcite .",
    "sometimes universality goes hand - in - hand with qma - completeness , e.g. , for local hamiltonians , whose dynamics are bqp - complete @xcite and whose ground energy problem is qma - complete @xcite . however , not all classes of hamiltonians with universal dynamics have qma - complete ground energy problems .",
    "for example , the dynamics of stoquastic local hamiltonians are bqp - complete ( as follows from @xcite and time - reversal symmetry ) , whereas the corresponding ground energy problem is in am @xcite , which is presumably smaller than qma .",
    "similarly , the ground energy problem for a bose - hubbard model with @xmath25 is also in am @xcite , whereas the dynamics of such hamiltonians are universal @xcite .",
    "the ferromagnetic heisenberg model on a graph provides an even starker contrast : its dynamics are bqp - complete ( as can be inferred from @xcite using a correspondence between spins and hard - core bosons ) but its ground energy problem is trivial since the ground space is the symmetric subspace .      in this paper",
    "we define the bose - hubbard hamiltonian problem and characterize its complexity . in this problem one",
    "is given a graph @xmath8 and a number of particles @xmath23 and asked to approximate the ground energy of the bose - hubbard hamiltonian in the @xmath23-particle sector ( in a precise sense described in ) .",
    "we prove that this problem is qma - complete .",
    "to prove qma - hardness of the bose - hubbard hamiltonian problem , we show that in fact a notable special case of this problem , called frustration - free bose hubbard hamiltonian , is qma - hard . in this problem one",
    "is asked ( roughly ) to determine if the ground energy of the bose - hubbard hamiltonian in the @xmath23-particle sector is close to @xmath23 times its single - particle ground energy ( i.e. , @xmath23 times the smallest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix @xmath12 ) .",
    "this is always a lower bound on the @xmath23-particle energy , and when it is achieved we say the @xmath23-particle ground states are frustration free .",
    "a frustration - free state has the special property that it has minimal energy for both terms in , and in particular it is annihilated by the interaction term .",
    "frustration - free states therefore live in the subspace of _ hard - core _ bosons , where no more than one boson can occupy each site of the graph .    furthermore , we prove a reduction from frustration - free bose - hubbard hamiltonian to an eigenvalue problem for a class of @xmath1-local hamiltonians defined by graphs .",
    "the two problems are related by a well - known mapping between hard - core bosons and spin systems .",
    "specifically , given a graph @xmath8 ( with vertex set @xmath9 ) we consider the hamiltonian @xmath26 note that this hamiltonian commutes with the magnetization operator @xmath27 and has a sector for each of its eigenvalues @xmath28 .",
    "we reduce frustration - free bose - hubbard hamiltonian ( with @xmath23 particles on a graph @xmath8 ) to the problem of approximating the smallest eigenvalue of within the sector with magnetization @xmath29 .",
    "we call this the xy hamiltonian problem because of its connection to the xy model from condensed matter physics .",
    "since this problem is contained in qma , our reduction shows it to be qma - complete .",
    "we also obtain a related result that may be of independent interest . in",
    "we give a self - contained proof that computing the smallest eigenvalue of a sparse , efficiently row - computable @xcite symmetric @xmath10-@xmath11 matrix ( the adjacency matrix of a graph ) is qma - complete .",
    "this can alternatively be viewed as a result about the qma - completeness of a single - particle quantum walk on a graph with at most one self - loop per vertex . to prove this",
    ", we use a mapping from circuits to graphs that is also used in our main result . note that janzing and wocjan used a similar construction to design a bqp - complete problem @xcite .",
    "we prove our main result by direct reduction from quantum circuit satisfiability .",
    "we introduce several new techniques in order to do this using the bose - hubbard model on an unweighted graph .",
    "kitaev s original proof of qma - hardness of the local hamiltonian problem encodes a qma verification circuit using ideas from a computationally universal hamiltonian proposed by feynman @xcite .",
    "this hamiltonian uses a `` clock register '' to record the progress of the computation ; in an appropriate basis , the hamiltonian can be seen as a quantum walk on a path whose vertices represent the steps of the computation .",
    "other proofs of qma - hardness have used alternative encodings of the temporal structure of a verification circuit into a quantum state . in our construction",
    ", we encode the history of an @xmath0-qubit verification circuit in the state of @xmath0 interacting particles on a graph , where each particle encodes a single qubit .",
    "our construction uses a class of graphs we define called _ gate graphs_. gate graphs are built from a basic subgraph whose single - particle ground states encode the history of a simple single - qubit computation . by suitably combining copies of this basic unit , we define gadgets with other functionality .",
    "( note that these gadgets realize some desired behavior exactly ; they are not `` perturbative gadgets '' in the sense of @xcite . )",
    "in particular , we design gadgets for two - qubit gates such that each ground state of the two - particle bose - hubbard model encodes a two - qubit computation .",
    "we now give a high - level description of how these gadgets work and how we use them to construct a graph for a qma verification circuit .",
    "for each two - qubit gate @xmath30 from a fixed universal set , we design a graph @xmath31 that can be divided into four overlapping regions as shown schematically in .",
    "( the specific graphs we use for two - qubit gates each have 4096 vertices and are described using the gate graph formalism . ) the two - particle bose - hubbard model on this graph has ground states that encode the two - qubit computation .",
    "to describe them it is helpful to first consider the single - particle ground states , i.e. , the ground states of the adjacency matrix @xmath32 .",
    "this matrix has 16 orthonormal single - particle ground states @xmath33 .",
    "each index @xmath34 is associated with the corresponding region in the graph , as @xmath33 is supported entirely within region @xmath17 .",
    "the index @xmath35 corresponds to the computational basis states of a single encoded qubit .",
    "note that , since @xmath32 is a real matrix , the complex conjugate of any eigenstate is also an eigenstate with the same eigenvalue .",
    "the index @xmath36 is associated with this freedom , i.e. , @xmath37 .",
    "the ground space of the two - particle bose - hubbard model on @xmath31 is spanned by 16 states , indexed by two choices @xmath38 of computational basis states for the encoded qubits and two bits @xmath39 associated with complex conjugation .",
    "these states can be represented as symmetric states in the hilbert space @xmath40 ; they are @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the two - qubit gate of interest and @xmath43 is its elementwise complex conjugate .",
    "observe that each of these states is a superposition of a term where both particles are on the left - hand side of the graph , encoding a two - qubit input state @xmath44 , and a term where both particles are on the right - hand side of the graph , encoding the two - qubit output state @xmath45 where either @xmath30 or its complex conjugate has been applied .",
    "in other words , the particles `` move together '' through the graph as the gate @xmath46 is applied . while we might prefer the ground states to only encode the computation corresponding to @xmath30 , we must include the possibility of @xmath47 because the hamiltonian is real .",
    "the same issue arises for @xmath0-qubit verification circuits .",
    "fortunately , the complex conjugate of a circuit is equally useful for qma verification .",
    "it is natural to attempt to construct a graph for an @xmath0-qubit verification circuit by combining gadgets for each of the two - qubit gates .",
    "however , there is an obstacle to this approach , as illustrated by the example of a two - qubit circuit consisting of only two gates @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "one could construct a graph for such a circuit as shown schematically in , where the two - qubit gadgets for @xmath48 and @xmath49 are connected in some unspecified way in the middle . however , not every ground state of the two - particle bose - hubbard model on such a graph encodes a computation .",
    "for example , there could be a ground state where one of the particles is in the single - particle state @xmath50 localized on the left side of the graph and the other particle is in the state @xmath51 with support on a disjoint region of the graph on the right - hand side . to eliminate such spurious ground states ,",
    "we develop a method to enforce _ occupancy constraints _ on the locations of particles in gate graphs using the bose - hubbard interaction .",
    "although this interaction only directly penalizes simultaneous occupation of the same vertex , we show how to simulate terms that penalize simultaneous occupation of different regions of the graph .",
    "we formalize this method by proving an `` '' for gate graphs .    in summary , our construction of the graph for an @xmath0-qubit verification circuit proceeds in two steps .",
    "we first construct a graph @xmath8 by connecting two - qubit gadgets for each of the gates in the circuit . as discussed above",
    ", the ground space of the @xmath0-particle bose - hubbard model on @xmath8 includes a subspace of states that encode computations and a subspace of states that do not .",
    "we construct a set of occupancy constraints that are only satisfied by states in the former subspace .",
    "we then apply the to obtain a gate graph @xmath52 where each @xmath23-particle ground state encodes a computation .    unlike many previous works",
    ", we do not use perturbation theory in our analysis .",
    "instead , we use a `` '' that characterizes the smallest nonzero eigenvalue of a sum of two positive semidefinite matrices @xmath53 in terms of the smallest nonzero eigenvalue of @xmath54 and the smallest nonzero eigenvalue of @xmath55 restricted to the nullspace of @xmath54 .",
    "this lemma allows us to establish an eigenvalue promise gap ( i.e. , to bound the ground energies of yes instances away from those of no instances ) without having to multiply terms in the hamiltonian by large coefficients , something that is not allowed in the setting of the bose - hubbard model on a graph .",
    "whereas qma - hardness proofs such as those of @xcite require multiplying terms in the hamiltonian by unphysical , problem - size dependent coefficients , our approach avoids this .",
    "note that the was used implicitly in @xcite , which claimed to give a simple proof of the computational universality of adiabatic evolution .",
    "that paper encoded a circuit into the multi - particle ground state of a fermionic hamiltonian in a way that shares some features with our approach .",
    "unfortunately , although the encoding from @xcite is novel and interesting , the analysis of the resulting hamiltonian appears to lack details that are crucial to proving the stated result .",
    "our result shows that approximating the ground energy of the bose - hubbard model on a graph at fixed particle number is likely intractable . in showing this ,",
    "we introduce techniques that we expect will be useful in other contexts . here",
    "we briefly discuss some related questions for future work .",

    "one can define other variants of the bose - hubbard hamiltonian problem by lifting the restriction to fixed particle number .",

    "our reduction from frustration - free bose - hubbard hamiltonian to the ground energy problem for the spin model gives a stronger result for simple graphs , in which case the second term in vanishes .",
    "thus , if the frustration - free bose - hubbard hamiltonian problem for simple graphs is qma - hard , then approximating the ground energy of the xy model on a ( simple ) graph at fixed magnetization is qma - complete .",
    "there are many open questions concerning the complexity of the ground energy problem for other quantum systems defined by graphs .",
    "for example , one could consider fermions or bosons on a graph with nearest - neighbor interactions .",
    "one could also consider quantum spin models such as the xy model or the antiferromagnetic heisenberg model defined on graphs . both of these examples correspond to hamiltonians that conserve magnetization ,",
    "so one could consider the ground energy problem with or without a restriction to a fixed - magnetization sector .",
    "this would complement existing results about the complexity of computing the lowest - energy configuration of classical spin models defined by graphs ( for example , the antiferromagnetic ising model on a graph is np - complete , as it is equivalent to max cut ) .",
    "as emphasized previously , the hamiltonians we consider are determined entirely by a choice of graph , with the same type of movement and interaction terms applied throughout the graph .",
    "it might be interesting to find other qma - complete problems with similar features , such as a version of local hamiltonian with only one type of local term .",
    "analogous classical constraint satisfaction problems with a fixed type of constraint are well known ( e.g. , exact cover and not - all - equal sat ) and have been widely studied .",

    "we imagine that all - powerful merlin prepares the quantum proof @xmath61 and hands it to polynomially - bounded arthur , who checks it using his quantum computer .",
