    "there has been a great interest to the accretion process around black holes .",
    "the most famous accretion solution is the geometrically thin and optically thick cold disk model developed by shakura & sunyaev ( 1973 ; hereafter ssd ) and others .",
    "the second solution was discovered by shapiro , lightman & eardley ( 1976 ; hereafter sle ) .",
    "this solution is optically thin and hot , with @xmath0k .",
    "pringle ( 1976 ) found that sle is thermally unstable although it is not clear what is the consequence of such instability .    in both ssd and sle ,",
    "the energy advection is neglected .",
    "it was found that when the mass accretion rate is higher than the eddington rate @xmath1 , the large optical depth traps most of the photons therefore most of the viscously dissipated energy is stored in the gas and advected into the black hole rather than radiated away ( `` slim disk '' ; abramowicz et al .",
    "1988 ) .",
    "the fourth accretion solution is the advection - dominated accretion flow ( adaf ; narayan & yi 1995 ; abramowicz et al .",
    "1995 , hereafter a95 ; see reviews by narayan , mahadevan & quataert 1998 ; kato , fukue & mineshige 1998 ) .",
    "different from sle , the energy advection is included in the ions energy equation of an adaf , @xmath2 . here",
    "@xmath3 and @xmath4 are the rates of energy advection , viscous heating and coulomb cooling per unit area of the accretion disk , respectively . in a typical adaf ,",
    "the density of gas is very low , so @xmath5 , i.e. , _ the viscous heating is balanced by advective cooling_. since @xmath6 while @xmath7 , i.e. , @xmath4 increases faster than @xmath8 with increasing @xmath9 , there exists a critical rate @xmath10 , determined by @xmath11 . at this rate ,",
    "a large fraction of the viscously dissipated energy is transferred to the electrons and radiated away , so the accretion flow ceases to be advection - dominated . above @xmath10 , it was thought previously that no _ hot _ accretion solution exists and the only viable solution is ssd",
    ".    however , our recent work ( yuan 2001 , hereafter y01 ) indicated that this is not true : above @xmath10 , a new hot accretion solution exists .",
    "to illustrate , let s first write out the formula of the energy advection of ions , q_adv= h v_rq_int - q_com , i.e. , the energy advection consists of two terms , namely the internal energy gradient term @xmath12 and the compression work @xmath13 .",
    "_ the full condition for the existence of a hot accretion solution , when the flow starts out hot , is @xmath14 , i.e. , @xmath15 _ ( _ note @xmath16 _ ) . for an adaf , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , so @xmath19 . when @xmath20 , @xmath21 , but there obviously exists another critical accretion rate , @xmath22 , determined by @xmath23 .",
    "below @xmath22 , we still have @xmath24",
    ". therefore , the accretion flow can remain hot if it starts out hot .",
    "we denote this new solution as luminous hot accretion flow ( lhaf hereafter ) .    from the above analysis",
    ", we see that lhafs are along the line of adafs  the equations describing both are completely the same and we just extend adafs to higher accretion rates .",
    "however , the dynamics of an lhaf is quite different from an adaf . in an adaf , @xmath25 ,",
    "i.e. , the advection plays a `` cooling '' role from the lagrangian point of view .",
    "but in an lhaf , @xmath26 , so it plays a `` heating '' role . in the language of entropy , it is the conversion of entropy together with viscous dissipation that supplies the radiation of lhafs . in this sense , an lhaf is dynamically similar with bondi accretion and cooling flow in galactic clusters .    in this context",
    "we can understand why previous authors did nt find this solution . in narayan & yi ( 1995 ) and",
    "esin et al . (",
    "1997 ) , they _ a priori _ set the advection factor `` @xmath27''(@xmath28 ) as positive , so they only obtained the adaf solution .",
    "similarly , a95 and chen et al .",
    "( 1995 , hereafter c95 ) did nt find this solution because they set the parameter @xmath29 ( see eq .",
    "( 6 ) below ) as positive .    in this _",
    ", we will first show the thermal equilibria of lhafs in the @xmath9 vs. @xmath30 ( surface density ) diagram (  2 ) .",
    "such a diagram is widely used in the study of accretion disks ( e.g. , a95 ; c95 ; kusunose & mineshige 1996 ; bjnsson et al .",
    "1996 ) . then in  3 we investigate the thermal stability of lhafs .",
    "we take a one - temperature accretion flow as an example for simplicity . for the purpose of comparison , we adopt almost exactly the same equations as c95 ( see also a95 ) .",
    "= -2r v_r , = f _ * g^-1 , q_adv = q_vis - q_rad .",
    "they represent conservations of mass , angular momentum , and energy , respectively . here",
    "@xmath31 is the kinetic viscosity coefficient , @xmath32 is the surface density , @xmath33 $ ] with @xmath34 .",
    "the forms of @xmath35 and @xmath36 are , q_vis=^2f_*g , q_adv =- v_r = , q_rad=8t^4(++)^-1 . the optical depth @xmath37 , with @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "the equation of state is @xmath40 , with @xmath41 , and @xmath42 ( abramowicz et al .",
    "the bremsstrahlung radiation @xmath43 .",
    "the formula for @xmath44 and @xmath45 are from narayan & yi ( 1995 ) .",
    "another useful equation is the hydrostatic balance equation , @xmath46 , with @xmath47 is the local sound speed .",
    "the paczyski & wiita ( 1980 ) potential is used .",
    "we solve eqs .",
    "( 2)-(7 ) to obtain the thermal equilibrium curve of lhafs .",
    "one noticeable parameter is @xmath29 in eq .",
    "( 6 ) . from  1",
    ", we know that for an lhaf , @xmath26 , therefore we should set @xmath48 to recover this solution .",
    "we can recover all other accretion solutions by simply setting @xmath49 , as in a95 .",
    "the crudeness of the value of @xmath29 does nt affect our qualitative results although it does prevent us from obtaining the exact quantitative results such as the ranges of accretion rates to which various accretion disk models correspond .",
    "figure 1 shows the thermal equilibrium curves of different solutions . comparing with the figures in a95 or c95",
    ", we see that the three `` u '' shaped thick lines are new and they denote lhafs with different values of @xmath29 .",
    "these lines extend from optically thin regime to optically thick regime , bridging the sle and the ssd solutions .",
    "it is not clear what physical implications the `` bridging '' has , or it might just be a mathematical trick .",
    "but we note in this context that in the slim disk solutions , they did find solutions with the advection term being negative in some cases ( abramowicz et al .",
    "1988 ; szuszkiewicz , private communication ) .",
    "some segment of the `` u '' curves are superimposed on the sle and ssd lines .",
    "we find that advection in these `` superimposed '' segment is equal to zero , same with sle and ssd .",
    "only the `` separate '' segment denotes the genuine lhafs , since for this segment the energy advection is negative and plays a significant role in the energy balance of ions . we see that above the critical accretion rate of adaf , @xmath50 , both adaf and sle disappear and lhaf is the only available _ hot _ solution .",
    "this is consistent with our analysis in  1 .    for comparison",
    ", we also solve the _ global _ solutions of the standard accretion equations describing a one - temperature accretion flow with the same parameters as in fig . 1 ( see yuan 1999 for the equations except that the radiative term is now replaced by eq .",
    "( 7 ) of the present paper ) .",
    "the results are denoted by the filled circles ( for adafs ) and triangles ( for lhafs ) .",
    "we can see that our local algebraic analysis is qualitatively consistent with the global results , i.e. , when the accretion rate is lower than a certain value , the solutions are adafs ; while above this value , the solutions are lhafs .",
    "we also calculated the value of @xmath29 for a specific example of @xmath51 and the outer boundary conditions of @xmath52k , and @xmath53 .",
    "we obtained @xmath54 at @xmath55 .",
    "we want to emphasize that our `` u '' shaped line is completely different from the line with the similar shape in c95 , which was obtained by setting a very large viscous parameter @xmath56 with @xmath57 or larger .",
    "in fact , a later more accurate treatment of microphysics and the inner boundary condition by bjrnsson et al .",
    "( 1996 ) indicated that @xmath58 , therefore , the `` u '' shaped branch in c95 is unphysical .",
    "from the density profile of the global solution in y01 , we know that lhafs are viscously stable .",
    "an important problem then is to analyze its thermal stability . before doing that",
    ", we note that an lhaf is dynamically very similar to a cooling flow in galactic clusters .",
    "many authors have studied the thermal stability of cooling flow and concluded that it is unstable against local perturbations if thermal conduction is neglected ( e.g. , fabian & nulsen 1977 ; mathews & bregman 1978 ; nulsen 1986 ) .",
    "thermal conduction can strongly stabilize the cooling flow ( zakamska & narayan 2003 ; kim & narayan 2003 ) .    now let s investigate the thermal stability of lhafs against local perturbations .",
    "such perturbations can be , e.g. , that the local gas density increases wherever the initial ambient magnetic field is less than average .",
    "we follow the standard analysis approach presented by kato , abramowicz & chen ( 1996 ) . taking the surface density as an example ,",
    "we denote perturbations @xmath59 superimposed over the unperturbed quantities @xmath30 as @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the growth rate of perturbation and @xmath62 is the perturbation wave number . substituting the perturbed quantities to the time - dependent accretion equations",
    ", we can obtain the perturbed equations and the dispersion relation .",
    "the arguments for adafs presented in kato et al .",
    "( 1996 ) hold for lhafs as well although the advection is negative and radiative cooling is important here .",
    "we assume that thermal conductivity is suppressed by the presence of the tangled magnetic field in the accretion flow ( but see narayan & medvedev 2001 ) .",
    "we expect the flow will be thermally stable if thermal conduction is strong .",
    "the dispersion relation is , -3n = g , and the condition for instability is g -()_w -()_w < 0 . here",
    "@xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "since @xmath65 , so @xmath66 .",
    "for a one - temperature lhaf , @xmath67 , so ( q_rad/)_w > 0 .",
    "therefore one - temperature lhafs are thermally unstable against local perturbations .",
    "the case of two - temperature lhaf is a little bit more complicated . treating the energy equation in kato et al .",
    "( 1996 ) as the energy equation of ions , the instability condition is exactly the same as eq .",
    "( 9 ) except that we should replace @xmath36 with @xmath68 , the coulomb collision cooling rate . since @xmath69 , to determine the sign of @xmath70 , we must turn to the electron energy equation to obtain the relation between @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "writing the energy equation of electrons as @xmath73 , with @xmath74 and @xmath75 are the energy advection and radiative cooling of electrons respectively , the global solution of y01 indicates that for lhaf a good approximation to the electrons energy equation is @xmath76 in the region outside of @xmath77 and @xmath78 inside @xmath79 ( see figure 5 in y01 ) . taking @xmath76",
    "we can get @xmath80 .",
    "hence @xmath81 and g=-()_w = 65 > 0 .",
    "so a two - temperature lhaf is thermally unstable at least at the region outside of @xmath77 . inside @xmath77 ,",
    "the radiative cooling is in general dominated by the thermal comptonization .",
    "the seed photons can be the synchrotron photons , or other soft photons from cold matter such as a ssd underlying or outside of the lhaf , or cold clumps suspending in the hot gas .",
    "the origin of the cold clumps in lhafs can be due to the thermal instability of lhafs ( see below ) , or originally existed in the accretion material .",
    "for luminous sources the soft photons from the cold matter is likely to dominate over the synchrotron photons as the seed photons of comptonization ( e.g. , zdziarski et al .",
    "since @xmath82 , with @xmath83 denotes the flux of seed photon , using @xmath84 , we find that if @xmath85 or stepper , the two - temperature lhafs will be thermally stable , otherwise it is unstable .",
    "unfortunately , it is not easy to determine whether this condition can be satisfied or not , because of the complicated energy interaction between the cold and hot phases in accretion flow ( e.g. , ferland & rees 1988 )",
    ".    now let s discuss the consequence of the thermal instability against local perturbations .",
    "an important factor is how fast the perturbations grow compared to other related timescales .",
    "it is believed that as the result of instability cold dense clumps will form in the hot flow if the growth of perturbations is fast enough .",
    "this mechanism has been used to explain the condensations of galaxies from the intergalactic medium , formation of solar prominence , and condensations in planetary nebulae ( e.g. , field 1965 ) .",
    "in the case of accretion flows , we should compare the accretion timescale @xmath86 with the growth timescale of perturbations @xmath87 .",
    "for lhafs , from eq .",
    "( 8) , the timescale of the growth of local perturbations is t_grow=(n)^-1=3 g^-1=3 ^-1= this equals the thermal timescale of accretion flows , @xmath88 , t_grow = t_th = t_th , for adiabatic index @xmath89 .",
    "we compare the two timescales , @xmath86 and @xmath87 , by numerical calculations .",
    "this requires us to solve the global solution of two - temperature lhafs .",
    "this was done in y01 .",
    "the results indicate that depending on the value of @xmath9 , there are two types of lhaf .",
    "when @xmath90 , with @xmath22 can be as high as @xmath91 , the accretion gas in lhaf is hot throughout the disk ; when @xmath92 , up to @xmath93 , within a certain radius the density of the accretion gas is so high that even the sum of compression work and viscous dissipation can not balance the strong coulomb cooling . as a result , the hot accretion flow will collapse onto the equatorial plane and form an optically thick cold annulus .",
    "while the quantitative results such as the value of @xmath22 depend on parameters such as @xmath94 , the qualitative results should not .",
    "correspondingly , there are two kinds of results when we compare @xmath86 and @xmath87 , as shown by the two lines in figure 2 .",
    "the corresponding two models are taken from fig .",
    "the solid line corresponds to @xmath95 , so the accretion flow is hot throughout the disk ; the dashed line to @xmath96 , so the hot accretion flow collapses at a radius and form a cold annulus .",
    "we see that when @xmath97 , @xmath98 , so the perturbations have no time to grow before they are swallowed by the black hole , therefore , the thermal instability will have no effect on the dynamics of lhafs . when @xmath99 , @xmath100 at the transition radius",
    ". as a result , some cold dense clumps will form there if lhafs are thermally unstable at that region .",
    "we speculate that once the condensation of the hot phase makes @xmath101 , the condensation will stop",
    ". this constraints will be useful when quantitatively calculating the physical states of clumps such as their filling factor , density and temperature . in our calculations of @xmath86 and @xmath87 , we considered only the `` standard '' radiative processes , namely synchrotron , bremsstrahlung , and their comptonization .",
    "if we include the additional compton cooling due to the soft photons from the cold phase , @xmath87 will decrease ( @xmath10 and @xmath22 will also decrease ) .",
    "we expect that we will still have @xmath102 when @xmath103 .",
    "note that lhaf will not collapse into an optically thick cold disk as the result of _ local _ perturbation since the perturbation wavelength is smaller than the disk scale - height .",
    "the thermal stability of lhafs against long wavelength perturbations is hard to determine , and it is also not clear how fast the growth of perturbations is compared to the accretion timescale if the flow is unstable . on the other hand , if the filling factor of the cold clumps is large enough , it is possible that these clumps may assemble due to frequent collisions and form a disk - like large scale structure .",
    "many authors have proposed such cold / hot two - phase accretion flow model for agns ( e.g. , guilbert & rees 1988 ; ferland & rees 1988 ; kuncic , celleti & rees 1997 ) .",
    "but almost all these work focus on the thermal state of cold clumps and how the clumps re - radiate the energy they absorb .",
    "krolik ( 1998 ) also suggested a two - phase accretion flow model .",
    "different from our suggested physical mechanism of clumps formation , he suggested that such a two - phase feature is the result of the instability in the radiation - pressure - dominated innermost region of a ssd ( see e.g. , gammie 1998 ) .",
