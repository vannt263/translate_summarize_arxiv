    "restoring forces play a very fundamental role in the study of vibrations of mechanical systems .",
    "if a system is moved from its equilibrium position , a restoring force will tend to bring the system back toward equilibrium . for decades ,",
    "if not centuries , springs have been used as the most common example of this type of mechanical system , and have been used extensively to study the nature of restoring forces .",
    "in fact , the use of springs to demonstrate the hooke s law is an integral part of every elementary physics lab . however , and despite the fact that many papers have been written on this topic , and several experiments designed to verify that the extension of a spring is , in most cases , directly proportional to the force exerted on it  @xcite , not much has been written about experiments concerning springs connected in series .",
    "perhaps one of the most common reasons why little attention has been paid to this topic is the fact that a mathematical description of the physical behaviour of springs in series can be derived easily  @xcite .",
    "most of the textbooks in fundamental physics rarely discuss the topic of springs in series , and they just leave it as an end of the chapter problem for the student  @xcite .",
    "one question that often arises from spring experiments is , `` if a uniform spring is cut into two or three segments , what is the spring constant of each segment ? ''",
    "this paper describes a simple experiment to study the combination of springs in series using only _",
    "one _ single spring .",
    "the goal is to prove experimentally that hooke s law is satisfied not only by each individual spring of the series , but also by the _ combination _ of springs as a whole . to make the experiment effective and easy to perform ,",
    "first we avoid cutting a brand new spring into pieces , which is nothing but a waste of resources and equipment misuse ; second , we avoid combining in series several springs with dissimilar characteristics .",
    "this actually would not only introduce additional difficulties in the physical analysis of the problem ( different mass densities of the springs ) , but it would also be a source of random error , since the points at which the springs join do not form coils and the segment elongations might not be recorded with accuracy . moreover , contact forces ( friction ) at these points might affect the position readings , as well .",
    "instead , we decide just to use one single spring with paint marks placed on the coils that allow us to divide it into different segments , and consider it as a collection of springs connected in series .",
    "then the static hooke s exercise is carried out on the spring to observe how each segment elongates under a suspended mass .    in the experiment ,",
    "two different scenarios are examined : the mass - spring system with an ideal massless spring , and the realistic case of a spring whose mass is comparable to the hanging mass .",
    "the graphical representation of force against elongation , used to obtain the spring constant of each individual segment , shows , in excellent agreement with the theoretical predictions , that the inverse of the spring constant of the entire spring equals the addition of the reciprocals of the spring constants of each individual segment .",
    "furthermore , the experimental results allow us to verify that the ratio of the spring constant of a segment to the spring constant of the entire spring equals the ratio of the total number of coils of the spring to the number of coils of the segment .",
    "the experiment discussed in this article has some educational benefits that may make it attractive for a high school or a first - year college laboratory : it is easy to perform by students , makes use of only one spring for the investigation , helps students to develop measuring skills , encourages students to use computational tools to do linear regression and propagation of error analysis , helps to understand how springs work using the relationship between the spring constant and the number of coils , complements the traditional static hooke s law experiment with the study of combinations of springs in series , and explores the contribution of the spring mass to the total elongation of the spring .",
    "when a spring is stretched , it resists deformation with a force proportional to the amount of elongation .",
    "if the elongation is not too large , this can be expressed by the approximate relation @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the restoring force , @xmath2 is the spring constant , and @xmath3 is the elongation ( displacement of the end of the spring from its equilibrium position )  @xcite . because most of the springs available today are _ preloaded",
    "_ , that is , when in the relaxed position , almost all of the adjacent coils of the helix are in contact , application of only a minimum amount of force ( weight ) is necessary to stretch the spring to a position where all of the coils are separated from each other  @xcite . at this new position ,",
    "the spring response is linear , and hooke s law is satisfied .",
    "it is not difficult to show that , when two or more springs are combined in series ( one after another ) , the resulting combination has a spring constant less than any of the component springs .",
    "in fact , if @xmath4 ideal springs are connected in sequence , the expression @xmath5 relates the spring constant @xmath2 of the combination with the spring constant @xmath6 of each individual segment . in general , for a cylindrical spring of spring constant @xmath2 having @xmath7 coils , which is divided into smaller segments , having @xmath8 coils , the spring constant of each segment can be written as @xmath9 excluding the effects of the material from which a spring is made , the diameter of the wire and the radius of the coils , this equation expresses the fact that the spring constant @xmath2 is a parameter that depends on the number of coils @xmath7 in a spring , but not on the way in which the coils are wound ( i.e. tightly or loosely )  @xcite .    in an early paper , galloni and kohen",
    "@xcite showed that , under _ static _ conditions , the elongation sustained by a non - null mass spring is equivalent to assuming that the spring is massless and a fraction of one - half of the spring mass should be added to the hanging mass .",
    "that is , if a spring of mass @xmath10 and relaxed length @xmath11 ( neither stretched nor compressed ) is suspended vertically from one end in the earth s gravitational field , the mass per unit length becomes a function of the position , and the spring stretches _ non - uniformly _ to a new length @xmath12 . when a mass @xmath13 is hung from the end of the spring , the total elongation @xmath14 is found to be @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the _ dimensionless elongation factor _ of the element of length between @xmath3 and @xmath17 , and @xmath18 is the acceleration due to gravity .",
    "an important number of papers dealing with the static and dynamic effects of the spring mass have been written in the physics education literature .",
    "expressions for the spring elongation as a function of the @xmath19th coil and the mass per unit length of the spring have also been derived  @xcite .",
    "we want to show that , with just _ one _ single spring , it is possible to confirm experimentally the validity of equations   and  .",
    "this approach differs from souza s work  @xcite in that the constants @xmath6 are determined from the same single spring , and there is no need of cutting the spring into pieces ; and from the standard experiment in which more than one spring is required .",
    "a soft spring is _ divided _ into three separate segments by placing a paint mark at selected points along its surface ( see  ) .",
    "these points are chosen by counting a certain number of coils for each individual segment such that the original spring is now composed of three marked springs connected in series , with each segment represented by an index @xmath20 ( with @xmath21 ) , and consisting of @xmath8 coils .",
    "an initial mass @xmath13 is suspended from the spring to stretch it into its _ linear _ region , where the equation @xmath22 is satisfied by each segment .",
    "once the spring is brought into this region , the traditional static hooke s law experiment is performed for several different suspended masses , ranging from @xmath23 to @xmath24 .",
    "the initial positions of the marked points @xmath25 are then used to measure the _ relative _ displacement ( elongation ) of each segment after they are stretched by the additional masses suspended from the spring  ( ) . the displacements are determined by the equations @xmath26 where the primed variables @xmath27 represent the new positions of the marked points , @xmath28 are the initial lengths of the spring segments , and @xmath29 , by definition .",
    "representative graphs used to determine the spring constant of each segment are shown in figures  [ fig3 ] ,  [ fig4 ] , and  [ fig5 ] .",
    "as pointed out by some authors  @xcite , it is important to note that there is a difference in the total mass hanging from each segment of the spring .",
    "the reason is that each segment supports not only the mass of the segments below it , but also the mass attached to the end of the spring .",
    "for example , if a spring of mass @xmath30 is divided into three _ identical _ segments , and a mass @xmath13 is suspended from the end of it , the total mass @xmath31 hanging from the first segment becomes @xmath32 .",
    "similarly , for the second and third segments , the total masses turn out to be @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively .",
    "however , in a more realistic scenario , the mass of the spring and its effect on the elongation of the segments must be considered , and equation   should be incorporated into the calculations . therefore , for each individual segment , the elongation should be given by @xmath35 where @xmath30 is the mass of the @xmath20th segment , @xmath36 is its corresponding total hanging mass , and @xmath6 is the segment s spring constant .",
    "consequently , for the spring divided into three identical segments ( @xmath37 ) , the total masses hanging from the first , second and third segments are now @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively .",
    "this can be explained by the following simple consideration : if a mass @xmath13 is attached to the end of a spring of length @xmath11 and spring constant @xmath2 , for three identical segments with elongations @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 , the total spring elongation is given by @xmath44 & = \\int_0^{\\frac{l}{3 } } \\xi(x)\\,\\rmd x +     \\int_{\\frac{l}{3}}^{\\frac{2l}{3 } } \\xi(x)\\,\\rmd x +     \\int_{\\frac{2l}{3}}^l \\xi(x)\\,\\rmd x \\nonumber \\\\[10pt ] & = \\frac{(m + \\frac{5}{6 } m_{\\mathrm{s}})\\,g}{3\\,k } +     \\frac{(m + { \\frac{1}{2}}m_{\\mathrm{s}})\\,g}{3\\,k } +     \\frac{(m + \\frac{1}{6 } m_{\\mathrm{s}})\\,g}{3\\,k } \\nonumber \\\\[10pt ] & = \\frac{(m + { \\frac{1}{2}}m_{\\mathrm{s}})\\,g}{k}\\ , .",
    "\\label{eq : dl2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as expected , equation   is in agreement with equation  , and reveals the contribution of the mass of each individual segment to the total elongation of the spring .",
    "it is also observed from this equation that @xmath45 as we know , @xmath46 is the mass of each identical segment , and @xmath47 is the spring constant for each .",
    "therefore , the spring stretches non - uniformly under its own weight , but uniformly under the external load , as it was also indicated by sawicky  @xcite .",
    "two particular cases were studied in this experiment .",
    "first , we considered a spring - mass system in which the spring mass was small compared with the hanging mass , and so it was ignored . in the second case ,",
    "the spring mass was comparable with the hanging mass and included in the calculations .",
    "we started with a configuration of three approximately _ identical _ spring segments connected in series ; each segment having @xmath48 coils ( @xmath49 )   when the spring was stretched by different weights , the elongation of the segments increased linearly , as expected from hooke s law . within the experimental error ,",
    "each segment experienced the same displacement , as predicted by  .",
    "an example of experimental data obtained is shown in  .",
    "simple linear regression was used to determine the slope of each trend line fitting the data points of the force versus displacement graphs .",
    "( a ) clearly shows the linear response of the first segment of the spring , with a resulting spring constant of @xmath50 .",
    "a similar behaviour was observed for the second and third segments , with spring constants @xmath51 , and @xmath52 , respectively . for the entire spring ,",
    "the spring constant was @xmath53 , as shown in  ( b ) .",
    "the uncertainties in the spring constants were calculated using the _ correlation coefficient _",
    "@xmath54 of the linear regressions , as explained in higbie s paper `` uncertainty in the linear regression slope ''  @xcite . comparing the spring constant of each segment with that for the total spring",
    ", we obtained that @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "as predicted by  , each segment had a spring constant three times larger than the resulting combination of the segments in series , that is , @xmath58 .",
    "the reason why the uncertainty in the spring constant of the entire spring is smaller than the corresponding spring constants of the segments may be explained by the fact that the displacements of the spring as a whole have smaller `` relative errors '' than those of the individual segments .",
    "shows that , whereas the displacements of the individual segments @xmath59 are in the same order of magnitude that the uncertainty in the measurement of the elongation ( @xmath60 ) , the displacements of the whole spring @xmath61 are much bigger compared with this uncertainty .",
    "we next considered a configuration of two spring segments connected in series with @xmath48 and @xmath62 coils , respectively ( @xmath63 , @xmath64 ) .",
    "( a ) shows a graph of force against elongation for the second segment of the spring .",
    "we obtained @xmath65 using linear regression .",
    "for the first segment and the entire spring , the spring constants were @xmath50 and @xmath66 , respectively , as shown in  ( b ) .",
    "then , we certainly observed that @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "once again , these experimental results proved equation   correct ( @xmath69 and @xmath70 ) .",
    "we finally considered the same two spring configuration as above , but unlike the previous trial , this time the spring mass ( @xmath71 ) was included in the experimental calculations .",
    "figures  [ fig5](a)(b ) show results for the two spring segments , including spring masses , connected in series ( @xmath72 , @xmath64 ) . using this method , the spring constant for the whole spring was found to be slightly different from that obtained when the spring was assumed ideal ( massless ) . this difference may be explained by the corrections made to the total mass as given by  .",
    "the spring constants obtained for the segments were @xmath73 and @xmath74 with @xmath75 for the entire spring .",
    "these experimental results were also consistent with equation  . the experimental data obtained is shown in  .",
    "when the experiment was performed by the students , measuring the positions of the paint marks on the spring when it was stretched , perhaps represented the most difficult part of the activity .",
    "every time that an extra weight was added to the end of the spring , the starting point of each individual segment changed its position .",
    "for the students , keeping track of these new positions was a laborious task .",
    "most of the experimental systematic error came from this portion of the activity . to obtain the elongation of the segments , using equation   substantially facilitated the calculation and tabulation of the data for its posterior analysis .",
    "the use of computational tools ( spreadsheets ) to do the linear regression , also considerably simplified the calculations .",
    "in this work , we studied experimentally the validity of the static hooke s law for a system of springs connected in series using a simple single - spring scheme to represent the combination of springs .",
    "we also verified experimentally the fact that the reciprocal of the spring constant of the entire spring equals the addition of the reciprocal of the spring constant of each segment by including well - known corrections ( due to the finite mass of the spring ) to the total hanging mass .",
    "our results quantitatively show the validity of hooke s law for combinations of springs in series [ equation  ] , as well as the dependence of the spring constant on the number of coils in a spring [ equation  ] .",
    "the experimental results were in excellent agreement , within the standard error , with those predicted by theory .",
    "the experiment is designed to provide several educational benefits to the students , like helping to develop measuring skills , encouraging the use of computational tools to perform linear regression and error propagation analysis , and stimulating the creativity and logical thinking by exploring hooke s law in a combined system of _ springs in series _ simulated by a _ single _ spring . because of it easy setup , this experiment is easy to adopt in any high school or undergraduate physics laboratory , and can be extended to any number of segments within the same spring such that all segments represent a combination of springs in series .",
