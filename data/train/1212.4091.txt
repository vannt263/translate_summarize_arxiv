    "the apache point observatory galactic evolution experiment ( apogee ) is one of 4 experiments that are part of the sloan digital sky survey iii ( sdss - iii ; eisenstein et al .",
    "apogee is obtaining high - resolution ( r@xmath922,300 ) , high signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n@xmath10100 per pixel ) , h - band ( @xmath111.511.69 @xmath1 m ) spectra of evolved , late - type stars , with the goal being to measure chemical abundances of 15 elements per star .",
    "coupled with radial velocities that are accurate to @xmath9100 m - s@xmath12 , apogee is creating the first high - precision spectroscopic and radial - velocity survey of all galactic stellar populations ( bulge , bar , disks , halo ) using a uniform set of stellar tracers and spectral diagnostics , with a plan to observe and derive these parameters for 100,000 red giants by the end of 2014 .",
    "the physical and chemical parameters of the apogee stars are derived from a suite of software packages that , together , are called the apogee stellar parameters and chemical abundances pipeline ( aspcap ) ; the details of this software and its analysis techniques will be discussed by allende - prieto et al .",
    "( 2012 , in preparation ) .",
    "the first - generation output of aspcap , which will be based on 1-d stellar atmosphere analyses in lte , will consist of the stellar parameters of effective temperature , t@xmath13 , surface gravity ( noted as log g ) , and the 1-d microturbulence parameter ( @xmath14 ) , along with the abundances of up to 16 elements ( fe , @xmath4c , @xmath6n , @xmath7o , mg , al , si , k , ca , ti , v , cr , mn , co , ni , or cu ) and , for many stars , the @xmath5c isotopic abundance",
    ".    one of the central components of the aspcap machinery is a spectral linelist constructed to produce the synthetic spectra that are used to compare to the observed ones ; the apogee linelist will be presented and discussed in detail by shetrone et al .",
    "( 2012 , in preparation ) .",
    "the goal of this study is to analyze a small number nearby field red giants with well - defined stellar parameters and use the apogee linelist to derive detailed chemical abundances via standard `` manual '' abundance analysis techniques ( ramirez and allende prieto 2011 is a recent example using such techniques ) .",
    "the derived stellar parameters and chemical abundances can be compared to the same quantities derived via aspcap using the same spectra , linelist , and model atmosphere grid .",
    "this comparison will be an important test of aspcap .",
    "this work will also present new abundances in these stars based on an extensive and up - to - date spectral linelist in the near - ir h - band .",
    "abundances will be presented in this paper using two different types of nomenclature , with one abundance scale defined as a(x)=log(n(x)/n(h ) ) + 12.0 .",
    "the other scale compares the element ratio of n(x)/n(q ) in a target star to the sun via [ x / q]=(a(x)@xmath15  a(x)@xmath16 )  ( a(q)@xmath15 ",
    "a(q)@xmath16 ) .",
    "the apogee high - resolution spectra cover the wavelength range from @xmath9@xmath1115100 to 16900  and to analyze bright red giants over this spectral interval , data were obtained from the archives of the fourier transform spectrometer ( fts  hall et al .",
    "1979 ) that operated at the coude focus of the kitt peak national observatory mayall 4-m reflector .",
    "a more complete description of observing techniques and the original data is discussed in hinkle , wallace , & livingston ( 1995 ) , in particular for the spectral atlas of @xmath0 boo .",
    "the originally reduced spectra of selected stars were recorded as flux versus wavenumber ( cm@xmath12 ) over different dates and runs and covered a broad region in the h - band .",
    "the spectra analyzed here were resampled in wavelength space and restricted to a wavelength range of @xmath1115000 to 17000 .",
    "the resolution of the spectra for different stars varies from r=45,000 to 100,000 , but were all higher than what is being observed for apogee .",
    "the higher resolution allows for a detailed investigation of the limits of what can be derived high - quality ( i.e. , high resolution and high signal - to - noise ) red - gaint spectra when using the apogee linelist .",
    "there are five stars analyzed here : the well - studied @xmath0 boo , a mildly metal - poor k1.5 giant , @xmath1 leo , the prototype metal - rich star ( spinrad & taylor 1969 ) , which is a k1 giant , two near - solar - metallicity m giants , @xmath2 and ( m0iii ) and @xmath3 oph ( m0iii ) , and hd199799 , an agb star of spectral type ms with a mild enhancement of @xmath4c and a slightly elevated ratio of c / o ( relative to solar ) due to third dredge - up ( smith & lambert 1990 ) .",
    "figure 1 illustrates a small portion of the apogee wavelength coverage for four of the red giants here .",
    "this region from 15560 ",
    "15590  includes representative species and how they vary with spectral type ( or effective temperature ) and metallicity .",
    "lines from the main cno - containing molecules , co , oh , and cn fall within this region , as noted in the figure . of particular interest is the metal - rich k - giant @xmath1 leo , which exhibits quite strong cn lines ; much of the variation in the spectrum of @xmath1 leo compared to the other giants result from the high line - density of cn .",
    "this figure also points to the desirability of analyzing large numbers of red giants via spectrum synthesis techniques using a detailed linelist .    with a significant fraction of its red - giant targets in the thin and thick disks , plus the inner bulge and bar , the five types of red giants studied here",
    "span a range of temperature and metallicity that provides a good test for aspcap .",
    "the apogee survey targets red giants with effective temperatures from t@xmath13=3400k5000k , having surface gravities from log g=3.0 to -0.5 , and metallicities from [ fe / h]= -5.0 to + 1.0 .",
    "these nearby giants have well - measured photometry and parallaxes , so temperatures , luminosities , and masses are all rather well - constrained . in addition , four of the five stars have previous abundance analyses in the literature and thus provide comparison tests for the abundances derived from the apogee linelist .",
    "deriving stellar chemical abundances from high - resolution spectra requires as basic input the effective temperature ( t@xmath13 ) , surface gravity ( characterized as log g with g as cm - s@xmath18 ) , and overall metallicity as the fundamental parameters of the model atmosphere .",
    "in addition , high - resolution abundance analyses of cool stars that use static 1-d stellar atmospheres also require the derivation of a non - thermal doppler - like broadening term called microturbulence ( @xmath14 ) , which is determined as part of the spectral analysis .",
    "the first step is the determination of t@xmath13 and , for these relatively nearby red giants , is set by the near - infrared magnitudes of j and k. this particular choice is used because the apogee targets are selected from the 2mass catalog ( strutskie et al .",
    "2006 ) and therefore all have ( j  k ) available .",
    "the aim is to focus on utilizing near - ir data and then compare to published literature results .",
    "all of the red giants here have parallaxes measured by hipparcos and thus have distances known to various levels of accuracy .",
    "the parallax is used to set the distance and , thus , m@xmath19 .",
    "bolometric corrections from bessell , castelli , & plez ( 1998 ) are used in conjunction with ( j  k ) to determine m@xmath20 and consequently stellar luminosity .",
    "basic data for the red giants are presented in table 1 .",
    "the most important derived quantity affecting the overall shape of the spectrum is t@xmath13 , which here is based on an average of two t@xmath13-(j  k ) calibrations ; one from gonzalez hernandez & bonifacio ( 2009 ) and the other from bessell et al .",
    "the gonzalez hernandez & bonifacio calibration is defined in the 2mass photometric system of ( j  k@xmath21 ) , so the original johonson ( 1965 ) ( j  k ) colors and k magitudes for these bright red giants ( which have saturated magnitudes in the 2mass catalog ) were transformed to 2mass values using the prescription from carpenter ( 2001 ) .",
    "the differences between the two calibrations , for a given metallicity , are less than 30 - 50k for t@xmath13@xmath224500k , but above this temperature the bessell et al .",
    "( 1998 ) becomes cooler by about 100k for a given ( j  k@xmath21 ) ( where we have transformed the bessell et al .",
    "scale onto the 2mass system ) .",
    "there is also a small metallicity effect on the ( j  k@xmath21 ) calibration which , for a given ( j  k@xmath21 ) can be @xmath9100k over the broad metallicity range of [ m / h]= -2.0 to + 0.0 ( where m is taken to represent the generic abundance of metals , i.e. those elements other than h and he )",
    ". given differences between two independent t@xmath13 calibrations of less than 30 - 50k over the temperature range of the target stars , as well as their modest range in metallicity , and well - determined magnitudes with @xmath9 0.02 uncertainty in ( j  k@xmath21 ) ( which translates to @xmath23t@xmath13=30k ) , the derived values of t@xmath13 have uncertainties of @xmath2450k or less .",
    "given the stellar luminosity and effective temperature , these fundamental properties are then compared to stellar evolution models presented in bertelli et al .",
    "( 2008 ; 2009 , with data from these papers taken from the website http://stev.oapd.inaf.it/yzvar ) to estimate stellar masses and , ultimately , surface gravities through :    g / g@xmath16= ( m / m@xmath16 ) @xmath25 ( l@xmath16/l ) @xmath25 ( t@xmath13/t@xmath26)@xmath8 .    determining the surface gravity from evolutionay tracks is an iterative process , because it requires knowledge of the stellar metallicity .",
    "this is illustrated in figure 2 where the stellar luminosity and t@xmath13 are plotted along with evolutionary models from a range of masses , with each panel having a different metallicity : z=0.017 ( top panel ) , 0.008 ( middle panel ) , and 0.004 ( bottom panel ) , correpsonding to overall metallicities of [ m / h]= + 0.07 , -0.26 , and -0.56 , respectively , when taking z=0.0145 for the sun , as suggested by lodders ( 2010 ) .",
    "the illustrated evolutionary tracks follow stellar evolution up to the tip of the first ascent red giant branch ( which we label rgb ) .",
    "initial model metalliities for the stars studied here are based on previously published results , with @xmath2 and , @xmath3 oph , and hd199799 started with solar metallicity , @xmath0 boo with [ fe / h]= -0.5 , and @xmath1 leo with [ fe / h]= + 0.3 . as there are numerous fe i lines in this spectral region , a sample of fe i lines are used to determine the iron abundance .",
    "given the limited range of metallicity spanned by the nearby red giants studied here , the fe abundance is a good proxy for the overall stellar metallicity . if the derived fe abundance differed by more than 0.1 dex from the assumed value , a new surface gravity was derived and a new model generated in order to reanalyze the fe i lines until convergence between model abundance and derived abundance . for these relatively well - studied red giants ,",
    "no more than two iterations were required until convergence .",
    "table 2 presents , for these red giants , the derived parameters t@xmath13 , log ( l / l@xmath16 ) , mass , log g , microturbulent velocity ( @xmath14  see section 4.2 ) , and overall metallicity , which is represented by [ fe / h ] as discussed in section 4.2 .",
    "given the position of the stars in the log l versus t@xmath13 plane shown in figure 2 , it can be ascertained that 4 stars ( @xmath0 boo , @xmath1 leo , @xmath3 oph , and @xmath2 and ) are most likely first - ascent red giants of low to moderate mass .",
    "based on its warmer temperature and somewhat lower luminoisty , it may be more likely that @xmath1 leo is in , or very near the core - he burning phase ( clump giant ) and has thus already ascended the rgb and experienced the core - he flash .",
    "it is also possible that the other 3 stars already noted above may be post - he core - burning stars ascending the agb ; however , lifetimes on the two separate evolutionary sequences would favor them as being on the rgb .",
    "all fall above the `` luminosity bump '' ( fusi pecci et al .",
    "1990 ) and would have thus experienced any extra - mixing that may occur during that phase of stellar evolution .",
    "the coolest and most luminous red giant in this sample , hd199799 , is an agb star that is experiencing the third dredge - up , as evidenced by the observation of tc i in its spectrum and its elevated s - process abundances , such as [ y / fe]@xmath9 + 0.5 or [ nd / fe]@xmath9 + 0.4 ( smith & lambert 1988 ; 1990 ) .",
    "as with the initial abundances to be derived from apogee , the analysis here will rely on 1-d model atmospheres computed in lte . within apogee , the choice was made to base the initial abundance determinations on an extensive model atmosphere database generated using the atlas9 code ( kurucz 1993 ) , thus the model atmospheres used here are based on these apogee models .",
    "atlas9 is widely used as a universal lte 1d plane - parallel atmosphere modeling code .",
    "the details of constructing the atmosphere database for apogee using atlas9 are presented in meszaros et al .",
    "( 2012 ) .",
    "the individual elemental abundances themselves will also be derived under the assumption of lte with the spectrum synthesis code moog as the analysis tool ( sneden 1973 is the original reference , but updated information , data , and the most recent versions of the code can be found at http://www.as.utexas.edu/  chris / moog.html ) .",
    "an extensive effort was made to produce as complete a spectral linelist as possible , so the analysis technique used here , as in apogee in general , is to utilize spectrum synthesis in a quantitative comparison between synthetic and observed spectra .",
    "all abundances are determined for each spectral line , or group of closely spaced molecular lines , via minimizing the residuals between observed and synthetic spectra as a function of the abundance in question .",
    "due to both its relatively large cosmic abundance and large number of energy levels , iron has historically been used as a diagnostic species for certain stellar parameters , as well as an overall metallicity indicator , so the results for fe i lines selected from the apogee linelist ( shetrone et al .",
    "2012 ) are discussed here . in particular , fe i lines are well - suited for setting the microturbulent velocity , @xmath14 , that is required for 1-d model atmosphere abundance analyses .    a large number of fe i lines fall within the apogee spectral window ( 15100  16900  ) , although there are no fe ii lines strong enough to be detected in these red giants .",
    "since all abundance determinations are done via spectrum synthesis , the fe i lines were culled to include those lines which contain only contributions from fe i ( this was determined by preliminary synthesis of the red giant spectra , then setting the fe abundance to zero and ensuring that the spectral feature in question vanished ) ; since the fe i lines are so numerous , this stringent selection still results in an adequate list of lines .",
    "table 3 presents the fe i lines used for the iron abundance determinations . as is true of most of the atomic lines in the h - band ,",
    "the excitation energies are dominated by rather high - excitation lines , although for fe i there are two lower - excitation lines .",
    "the fe i lines span a large enough range in line - strength that they can be used to set the microturbulent velocity .",
    "this parameter is defined by the value of @xmath14 that produces no trend in the fe abundance as a function of line - strength . for a range of microturbulent velocities",
    "fe abundances were determined from each fe i line and the adopted value of @xmath14 was one in which a linear regression between a(fe ) as a function of log(w@xmath27/@xmath11 ) yielded a slope of zero .",
    "this procedure is illustrated graphically in figure 3 , where the abundances derived for each individual line is plotted versus @xmath14 ( the continuous lines ) ; the circle with errorbars shows where the slope of a(fe ) with line - strength goes to zero .",
    "the microturbulent velocities set by the fe i lines , as well as the fe abundances are listed in table 2 as part of the derived set of stellar parameters .",
    "the individual line - by - line abundances as determined for each fe i line are also listed in table 3 .",
    "the fe abundances were used to set the final overall metallicities of the atlas9 model atmospheres for the analysis of additional elements via atomic or molecular lines .",
    "abundances for @xmath4c , @xmath6n , @xmath7o , and the minor carbon isotope @xmath5c are derived from combinations of vibration - rotation ( v  r ) lines of co ( x@xmath28@xmath29@xmath30 ) and oh ( x@xmath31@xmath32 ) , along with electronic transitions of cn ( a@xmath31@xmath32  x@xmath31@xmath29 ) . although the details of the ingredients that went into these molecular lines in the apogee linelist will be found in shetrone et al .",

    "this process is repeated until the c and o abundances yield consistent abundances from co and oh . with these values of c and o , the cn lines are used to derive the abundance of nitrogen . in general , the abundance of n has little to no effect on the co and oh lines , however , the respective final c , n , and o abundances all provide self - consistent results from co , oh , and cn .    all spectral features were synthesized and the molecular regions that were used to extract the abundances are listed in table 4 . in this case , if a range of wavelengths is given it indicates that a spectral window containing numerous molecular lines was used ( for co and oh ) , while for cn individual transitions were identified and synthesized . as with table 3 ,",

    "o abundances in hand , additional elements are derived via atomic spectral lines in the wavelength interval 15100  16900 .",

    "this k - giant is often cited as the `` prototype '' for metal - rich stars , having been noted as such by spinrad & taylor ( 1969 ) , and some of its spectral regions contain numerous and strong cn lines .",
    "two older abundance studies in the literature ( gratton & sneden 1990 ; smith & ruck 2000 ) are used to compare to the abundances derived here , as well as a more recent analysis by fulbright , mcwilliam , & rich ( 2007fmr ) . as with the @xmath0",

    "the surface gravities were slightly different , with log g= 2.3@xmath240.3 in gratton & sneden and 2.2@xmath240.1 in smith & ruck ; both values agree with the value here , within the uncertainties , of log g=2.1 derived from the luminosity and estimate of stellar mass .",
    "the value of @xmath14=1.8 km - s@xmath12 found from the h - band fe i lines is slightly higher than 1.2 km - s@xmath28 found by both gratton & sneden ( 1990 ) and smith & ruck ( 2000 ) , but with all studies having uncertainties of 0.3 - 0.5 km - s@xmath12 , this offset can not be claimed to be significant .",
    "a comparison of abundances between here and gratton & sneden ( 1990 ) for 12 elements finds a mean @xmath23a(x)(this paper - gs)=-0.05@xmath240.14 dex , while the same comparsion with smith & ruck ( 2000 ) yields @xmath23a(x)=-0.05@xmath240.02 dex for the 3 elements analyzed by them : fe , mg , and ca .",
    "the abundance offsets are not significant and the scatter is within what is expected .",
    "the more recent abundance analysis of @xmath1 leo by fmr was part of their study of bulge red giants .",
    "their derived stellar parameters were quite similar to those found here , with t@xmath13(fmr)=4520k , ( @xmath23t(this study - fmr)= + 30k ) , log g = 2.33 ( @xmath23log g(this study - fmr)= -0.23 ) , and @xmath14=1.50 km - s@xmath12 ( @xmath23@xmath14(this study - fmr)= + 0.3 km - s@xmath12 ) .",
    "there are 7 elements in common ( fe , o , mg , al , si , ca and ti ) and the mean difference is @xmath23a(x)(this study - fmr)=-0.10 @xmath24 0.13 dex .",

    "this m - giant was analyzed previously by smith & lambert ( 1985 ) who derived t@xmath13=3800k ( from its ( v  k ) color ) , log g=1.6 , and @xmath14=2.1 km - s@xmath12 .",

    "beta and was also used as a comparison star by chou et al .",
    "( 2010 ) in their study of sgr dwarf - galaxy tidal streams in the galactic halo .",
    "chou et al . ( 2010 ) applied a similar technique as that employed here to estimate temperatures and gravities and found t@xmath13=3850@xmath2475k , log g=0.9 and @xmath14=1.96 km - s@xmath12 , giving differences of only 25k in t@xmath13 , 0.0 in log g , and + 0.24 km - s@xmath12 in @xmath14 .",
    "their analysis used the spectral region around @xmath117500  containing a sample of fe i and ti i lines and determined a(fe)=7.12@xmath240.06 and a(ti)=4.55@xmath240.12 , which can be compared to values of 7.23@xmath240.03 and 4.72@xmath240.02 , respectively , here , yielding differences of + 0.11 dex in fe and + 0.17 dex in ti .",
    "hd 199799 is classified as spectral type m2s , which means that it displayed enhanced bands of zro in classification spectra .",
    "smith & lambert ( 1988 ) detected the radioactive s - process element tc i in its spectrum , identifying this star as an intrinsic tp - agb star undergoing third dredge - up .",
    "a quantitative abundance analysis was then carried out by smith & lambert ( 1990 ) and they derived similar stellar parameters to those derived here : the same t@xmath13=3400k , with a slightly lower value of log g=+0.3 , compared to + 0.5 here . the microturbulent velocity determined here from the h - band spectra is @xmath14=2.4 km - s@xmath12 , which is 0.7 km - s@xmath12 larger than smith & lambert ( 1990 ) , who used fe i lines near @xmath117500 . taking into account the slightly lower gravity and smaller @xmath14 ,",
    "the abundances from smith & lambert ( 1990 ) can be compared to those here for fe , @xmath4c , @xmath6n , @xmath7o , ti , cr , co , and ni , with the mean difference being @xmath23a(x ) ( us - sl90)= -0.08@xmath240.13 .",
    "the respective carbon isotopic ratios compare well , with smith & lambert ( 1990 ) finding @xmath4c/@xmath5c=28 , while a value of 27 is obtained here .",
    "the derived c / o ratios are the same in the two studies , with @xmath4c/@xmath7o=0.68 .",
    "the comparisons presented here are between studies that have possibly used somewhat different families of model atmospheres ( e.g. marcs or atlas ) , different spectral regions , and linelists derived from heterogeneous sources . given the variety of data and analysis techniques , the derived abundances , in all cases , compare well at approximately the 0.10 to 0.15 dex level .",
    "a glance at table 7 reveals that such differences fall within this range of uncertainty for most elements given modest changes in fundamental model atmosphere parameters .",
    "since the derived stellar parameters themselves rely to some degree on the type of analysis , the generally good agreement between the derived abundances from the various published sources , along with the expected uncertainties in this study , as presented in table 7 , is encouraging .",
    "the gist of the comparisons , since many of the studies are based on optical spectra , is that h - band spectrscopy can be used to define a precise internal abundance scale that can also extended to abundances derived from other , more common spectral windows , such as in the optical .",
    "the abundances from table 6 and an estimation of their respective uncertainties from table 7 , along with the stellar parameters from table 2 represent , to some extent , what aspcap will produce from the apogee spectra .",
    "the following discussion highlights these abundances in light of internal red giant stellar evolution , as well as galactic chemical evolution and stellar populations .",
    "these discussion topics anticipate what sorts of information will be gleaned from the apogee targets .",
    "based on their luminosities and effective temperatures ( figure 2 ) , four of the red giants studied here are either first - ascent giants or , perhaps for @xmath1 leo , a clump red giant .",
    "hd 199799 is in a more advanced stage of stellar evolution where it is undergoing thermal pulses and third dredge - up on the agb .",
    "the combination of nucleosynthesis and convective mixing in evolved red giants should result in surface abundances of @xmath4c , @xmath5c , and @xmath6n that have been altered from their initial ( main sequence ) values due to cn - cycle h - burning and first dredge - up .",
    "the result of cn - cycle mixing is seen mostly easily in the @xmath4c/@xmath5c ratios which are much higher in main - sequence stars , with the sun having a value of 89 .",
    "all four of the rgb or clump giants have quite low values , ranging from @xmath4c/@xmath5c@xmath96 - 20 .",
    "gilroy ( 1989 ) and many subsequent studies of both open and globular clusters ( e.g. , mikolatis et al . 2012 or",
    "briley et al . 1995 ) have noted that the carbon isotopic ratios correlate with stellar mass in stars above the luminosity bump on the rgb or in the clump ; red giants more massive than m@xmath92.5m@xmath16 have values of @xmath4c/@xmath5c@xmath922 - 30 , while lower - mass red giants exhibit decreasing isotopic ratios with declining mass .",
    "the mass estimates derived here for field stars from distance - luminosity and stellar evolutionary tracks are modestly well - defined and the top panel of figure 5 shows the @xmath4c/@xmath5c values versus the estimated stellar mass . also plotted are representative results for open clusters from gilroy ( 1989 ) and mikolaitis et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , and the globular cluster m71 from briley et al .",
    "the cluster red giants have recently evolved from the cluster turn - offs , which have a well - determined masses . for the lower - mass stars included in these cluster studies , evolution along",
    "the rgb is rapid ( @xmath910@xmath45 yrs ) when compared to main sequence lifetimes ( @xmath910@xmath46 - 10@xmath47 yrs ) so the red giant mass is similar to the turn - off mass .",
    "this can be demonstrated using the evolutionary tracks from bertelli et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , where an isochrone with a turn - off mass of 4.0m@xmath16 has a red giant tip mass of 4.2m@xmath16 , or a ratio of rgb to to masses of 1.05 .",
    "this ratio of masses becomes even closer to 1.0 for lower masses , which include all of the points in figure 5 .",
    "the points from gilroy represent the mean values of @xmath4c/@xmath5c for 19 open clusters with a total of 55 red giants in her sample . the mean carbon isotopic ratios for two other open clusters ( with a total of 10 red giants from cr261 or ngc6253 ) from mikolaitis et al .",
    "( 2012 ) are also shown ( open blue squares ) . a representative globular cluster , m71 , which has a lower main - sequence mass ( m@xmath90.9m@xmath16 ) from briley et al . ( 1995 )",
    "is plotted as the open blue triangle and represents the mean of two of the cn - weak stars in this cluster .",
    "the cn - strong giants that briley et al . also studied are not plotted , as they exhibit slightly lower isotopic ratios but almost certainly represent 2nd generation stars in m71 that were formed from large fractions of the ejecta of 1st generation intermediate - mass red giants and thus are not representative of single - star red giant evolution .",
    "the curves in the top panel of figure 5 represent stellar evolutionary model results from charbonnel & lagarde ( 2010 ) ; the solid black line illustrates their predictions for standard rgb dredge - up ( no `` extra - mixing '' or rotation included ) .",
    "clearly , standard rgb first dredge - up does not fit the observed trend of @xmath4c/@xmath5c for red giants with m@xmath222.2m@xmath16 .",
    "this poor comparison between theory and observation has led to work in trying to identify other types of `` extra mixing '' mechanisms that would lead to lower carbon - isotopic ratios in the lower - mass red giants .",
    "two such hypothesized mechanisms are thermohaline mixing or thermohaline mixing coupled with rotational mixing , as discussed recently by charbonnel & lagarde ( 2010 ) .",
    "the dashed curves present results from charbonnel & lagarde also , with the short dashes for thermohaline mixing only and the long dashes for thermohaline mixing plus rotational mixing for models with initial equatorial rotational velocities of 110 km - s@xmath12 . the stellar models that incorporate these particular types of extra - mixing",
    "provide fair agreement with the observations , although these are not the only types of processes that have been studied and are used here to merely illustrate the effect of extra mixing .",
    "the trends found in the clusters also overlap well with the field stars analyzed here , except for hd 199799 , which is in a different evolutionary phase than the other red giants .",
    "this star has enriched its surface in @xmath4c that was synthesized by he - burning as a tp - agb star . in the simplest case of pure @xmath4c dredge - up",
    ", the surface @xmath4c/@xmath5c ratio would increase , which is where hd 199799 lies in the top panel of figure 5 relative to the other red giants .",
    "such an effect has been noted by both lambert et al .",
    "( 1986 ) and smith & lambert ( 1990 ) , where these studies find increasing values of @xmath4c/@xmath5c as tp - agb stars evolve from m to ms to s to c stars ( with increasing values of @xmath4c/@xmath7o ) .",
    "the bottom panel of figure 5 plots the abundance by number ratio of n(c)/n(n ) versus stellar mass , where the carbon abundance is now the total of @xmath4c + @xmath5c : for reference the solar ratio is 3.80 .",
    "nitrogen is also the total abundance , however in the case of the observations , @xmath48n is ignored as its abundance is very low ( and not detected in these red giants ) when compared to @xmath6n .",
    "there is an observed decrease in c / n with increasing mass as predicted by both standard rgb dredge - up and dredge - up plus thermohaline mixing ( charbonnel & lagarde 2010 ) , which are shown as the solid and dashed curves , respectively , and are from the same models as in the top panel . in the case of the c",
    "/ n ratios , the total carbon and nitrogen abundances are not as strongly influenced by non - standard mixing as the carbon isotopic ratios .",
    "figure 6 combines the c / n ratios versus @xmath4c/@xmath5c ratios for both the observed red giants and the models from charbonnel & lagarde ( 2010 ) . when displayed this way , the different behavior between c / n versus @xmath4c/@xmath5c is striking and these two values are purely spectroscopically derived quantities .",
    "the trend of c / n with @xmath4c/@xmath5 seems to provide a sensitive indicator of red giant mixing processes , as well as yields a mass estimate for stars on the rgb .",
    "again , hd 199799 stands apart from the other red giants as it has internally enhanced its @xmath4c abundance by about a factor of two since it was a rgb star , based on its @xmath4c/@xmath5c and mass , relative to other rgb stars in the top panel of figure 5 .",
    "the dashed - dotted line connects to the region in this diagram where hd 199799 would fall if its surface @xmath4c abundance were reduced by a factor of two , which is a simplified sketch of how tp - agb stars might evolve across such a diagram from the rgb .",
    "the assumption of only cn - cycle mixing taking place in the red giants is tested in figure 7 , where the total carbon abundance ( @xmath4c + @xmath5c ) is plotted versus the nitrogen abundance ( here @xmath6n ) .",
    "the solar values of c and n are also shown , along with the dashed line illustrating scaled solar - abundances for both c and n. the continuous blue curves represent decreasing carbon and increasing nitrogen abundances from the scaled solar lines , with the constraint that the number of c + n nuclei is conserved , as in the cn - cycle ( with no leakage into the on - cycle ) . each curve is scaled in its initial c and n abundances by the stellar value of [ fe / h ] for @xmath0 boo , @xmath2 and , @xmath3 oph , and @xmath1 leo .",
    "cn - cycle mixing alone is sufficient to represent the derived abundances of c and n with initial abundances having [ c +",
    "n / fe]@xmath90.0 for each rgb star . due to having undergone",
    "third dredge - up and @xmath4c enrichment , hd 199799 will be offset from its cn curve , so no curve is plotted for it .",
    "the dashed - dotted line simply shows the shift in a(c ) if hd 199799 has doubled its rgb @xmath4c abundance .",
    "having nearly the same metallicity as @xmath2 and , hd 199799 might be expected to have been near the cn curve for @xmath2 and before it began its evolution as a tp - agb star .",
    "the apogee h - band wavelength region presents good opportunities for probing many nuclear and mixing processes that occur over the various phases of red giant evolution .",
    "other than the c and n isotopes , the vast majority of apogee red giant targets will not have altered their surface abundances of the other studied elements , so the remaining elements are dominated by chemical evolution within the various stellar populations of the milky way ( or its accreted systems ) .",
    "the derived abundances of each of the other elements are discussed in the light of observed trends of these elements with a(fe ) from other studies in the literature .",
    "the number of published abundances is now enormous ; however in this first exploratory study using the apogee linelist , a comparison with a small number of selected literature sources is sufficient . for comparison purposes in this paper a stellar sample representative of the milky way stellar populations",
    "was constructed using reddy et al .",
    "( 2003 ; thin disk with some thick disk and having 58 stars ) , reddy et al .",
    "( 2006 ; thick disk with 176 stars ) , johnson ( 2002 ; halo with 23 stars ) , and fulbright ( 2002 ; halo with 178 stars ) .",
    "the investigation of elements derived from the apogee linelist is via a number of figures , beginning with figure 8 , which presents values of o / fe , mg / fe , and al / fe versus a(fe ) ; the shorthand notation here of x / fe denotes the logarithmic number ratio of element x to iron , log[n(x)/n(fe ) ] , or a(x ) - a(fe ) .",
    "this nomenclature is chosen over the [ x / fe ] in the plots as it presents a direct logarithmic number ratio with the solar abundance ratio being noted in each panel , thus no reference to the underlying solar abundance is needed , but the relative scales are equivalent to [ x / fe ] .",
    "the top panel of figure 8 shows the behavior of o / fe and , as has been well - known for decades , values of o / fe are elevated in the thick disk and halo stars . among the field red giants here ,",
    "the slightly metal - poor objects @xmath0 boo and @xmath2 and both have o / fe enhanced by @xmath9 + 0.2  + 0.3 .",
    "the near - solar metallicity m - giant @xmath3 oph has a near - solar ratio of o / fe , while the metal - rich giant @xmath1 leo also exhibits a near - solar value o / fe .",
    "the behavior of mg / fe is shown in the middle panel of figure 8 and , like oxygen , mg / fe ratios are typically elevated in the thick disk and halo populations .",
    "the four red giants closest to solar in a(fe ) all exhibit basically solar mg / fe ratios , with @xmath0 boo having a slight enhancement of@xmath9 + 0.1 dex , which overlaps the thick disk populations .",
    "aluminum abundances are plotted in the bottom panel of figure 8 and the behavior of al / fe versus a(fe ) is not so well - defined , with relatively large scatter .",
    "mu leo is found to be modestly enhanced in al / fe by about + 0.10+0.15 dex , as is @xmath0 boo , with an enhancement of @xmath9 + 0.2 .",
    "the abundances for the rest of the elements studied here are illustrated in figure 9 ( for si , k , and ca ) , figure 10 ( for ti , v , and cr ) , figure 11 ( for mn , co , and ni ) , and figure 12 ( for cu ) . in all elements , the general trends found in the general galactic populations are recovered in the small sample of field red giants included here .",
    "the one exception is ti in @xmath3 oph and @xmath1 leo , both of which are found to exhibit enhanced values of ti / fe of + 0.2 dex .",
    "there is no obvious explanation for this , however the continuing analysis of apogee spectra with this linelist wuill reveal if this possible effect appears in significant numbers of other red giants .",
    "the results presented and discussed here indicate that h - band spectra analyzed in lte with the apogee linelist and 1d model atmospheres can provide accurate results for chemical abundances .",
    "archival high - resolution fts spectra from @xmath111510016900  are analyzed to derive detailed chemical abundance distributions for five field red giants using the apogee linelist and model atmosphere grid .",
    "the red giants span a range in t@xmath13 from 3400k to 4540k and log g from 0.5 to 2.1 , covering a significant part of the effective temperature - surface gravity range being observed in the apogee survey .",
    "chemical abundances are determined for 16 elements , along with the minor carbon isotope , @xmath5c .",
    "comparisons of the abundances derived here with those from previously published studies of four of the target stars here , mostly from visual - wavelength high - resolution spectra , find abundance differences of @xmath90.1 dex .",

    "<S> these red giants consist of two k - giants ( @xmath0 boo and @xmath1 leo ) , two m - giants ( @xmath2 and and @xmath3 oph ) , and one thermally - pulsing asymptotic giant branch ( tp - agb ) star of spectral type ms ( hd 199799 ) . </S>",
    "<S> measured chemical abundances include the cosmochemically important isotopes @xmath4c , @xmath5c , @xmath6n , and @xmath7o , along with mg , al , si , k , ca , ti , v , cr , mn , fe , co , ni , and cu . </S>",
    "<S> the k and m giants exhibit the abundance signature of the first dredge - up of cn - cycle material , while the tp - agb star shows clear evidence of the addition of @xmath4c synthesized during @xmath8he - burning thermal pulses and subsequent third dredge - up . </S>",
    "<S> a comparison of the abundances derived here with published values for these stars reveals consistent results to @xmath90.1 dex . </S>",
    "<S> the apogee spectral region and linelist is , thus , well - suited for probing both galactic chemical evolution , as well as internal nucleosynthesis and mixing in populations of red giants via high - resolution spectroscopy . </S>"
