    "formation of heterogeneous spatial structures in binary phase - separating fluids and their fluidity are intriguing objects of research in the various fields such as non - equilibrium physics , fluid mechanics , and rheology @xcite .",
    "multi - component atomic bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) realized in recent decades are quantum fluids that display phase separation @xcite .",
    "the unique feature of atomic becs is the unprecedented controllability of relevant experimental parameters , which provides novel approaches for studying the physics of phase separation .",
    "for example , atomic interaction strengths can be tuned via feshbach resonances @xcite , and trapping potentials can be designed by using optical and magnetic fields . to date ,",
    "miscibility and immiscibility of binary becs were controlled by changing the atomic interaction strengths @xcite and by using rabi coupling @xcite .",
    "additionally , quantum tunneling across immiscible becs separated into two layers was observed by application of a state dependent potential @xcite . theoretically pattern formations at fluid interfaces have been predicted in two - component becs , which are due to interface instabilities such as rayleigh - taylor @xcite and kelvin - helmholtz instabilities @xcite .",
    "when two spatially overlapping immiscible becs are prepared , domain structures are spontaneously formed so that the free energy of the whole system is minimized @xcite .",
    "this spontaneous spatial structure formation has been widely observed in dual species becs @xcite and two - component becs composed of two different hyperfine states @xcite or zeeman states @xcite . in this paper , we investigate influences of spontaneous structure formation on the fluidity of immiscible two - component becs , and conversely influences of non - equilibrium fluid flow on the domain structures .",
    "spatially overlapping two - component becs comprised of different zeeman states of @xmath0rb atoms are prepared by application of a resonant radio frequency ( rf ) pulse .",
    "the two - component becs homogeneously overlap just after the rf pulse , and domain structures grow distinctly after 40 ms . in order to generate the relative flow between the two - component becs , a spin - dependent potential gradient is applied .",
    "we find that the center of mass ( c.m . )",
    "motion is drastically changed depending on whether the two - component becs are homogeneously overlapped or multiple domain structures are formed .",
    "when two - component becs are homogeneously overlapped , they readily separate into two layers , which is a stable configuration for immiscible fluids . in contrast , multiple domains refuse to separate against the spin - dependent potential gradient , and the relative flow is suppressed . in the previous experiments in refs .",
    "@xcite , the collective dynamics of immiscible becs in a highly displaced magnetic harmonic trap have been observed .",
    "the effects of periodic collisions between two - component becs on c.m . oscillations and shape oscillations were investigated . on the other hand ,",
