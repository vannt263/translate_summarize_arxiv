    "@xcite in that sense , quasi - one - dimensional chains have received much attention from experimental and theoretical points of view.@xcite theoretical approaches that focus on a single highest - occupied - molecular orbital ( homo ) or lowest - unoccupied - molecular orbital ( lumo ) have been successful in describing fascinating electronic ordered phase .",
    "such a treatment can be justified since in these conventional systems , the homo or lumo levels are well - separated from the rest of the mos spectrum.@xcite    nevertheless , new types of molecular solids have been recently synthesized , for instance , aiming at the metalization of the single - component molecular solids family @xmath3(tmdt)@xmath1 ( @xmath4 ni , au),@xcite where tmdt stands for trimethylenetetrathiafulvalenedithiolate .",
    "the molecular extension of the tmdt system is so large that a description based on a single molecular orbital ( mo ) is questionable . as a matter of fact , _",
    "ab initio _ calculations have been performed @xcite and an effective three - band hubbard model has been proposed and succeeded in describing electronic structures.@xcite in this respect , the quasi - one - dimensional molecular compound ( ttm - ttp)i@xmath0 , @xcite where ttm - ttp=2,5-bis(4,5-bis(methylthio)-1,3-dithiol-2-ylidene)-1,3,4,6-tetrathiapentalene looks like a promising candidate to investigate the theory limitation of a single - mo approximation . the presence of an i@xmath5 counter - anion is suggestive of formally organic [ ttm - ttp]@xmath6 cations in the crystal structure , i.e. , unpaired electrons localized within the organic moieties .",
    "the magnetic susceptibility@xcite and nmr measurements @xcite revealed phase transitions at finite temperature .",
    "insulating and non - magnetic behaviors have been confirmed at low - temperature .",
    "furthermore , based on raman - scattering @xcite and x - ray measurements , @xcite it has been suggested that an asymmetric deformation of the [ ttm - ttp ] molecule occurs and charge disproportionation within the molecule is possible below a transition temperature .",
    "this novel charge - ordered ( co ) state is different from the conventional co state @xcite and is called _ intramolecular _ co state.@xcite this nontrivial phenomena observed in this particular compound may not be described using a single - band description , i.e. , the present molecular assembly could give rise to a phenomenon beyond a concept expected from a knowledge of a single molecule although the trigger may be hidden in the properties of multi molecular orbitals .",
    "thus , there is a crucial need for theoretical description to rationalize the origin of such state .",

    "@xcite on top of the casscf wave functions , second - order perturbation theory calculations ( caspt2 ) were performed using an imaginary shift of 0.3 a.u .  and an ionization potential - electronic affinity ( ipea ) shift of 0.0 a.u .",
    "the ipea shift aims at correcting the energy differences calculations between states holding different open shells . since we are dealing with spin states",

    "the energy separation between the g and u valence mos ( see fig .  [",

    "however , it can be considered that the following results are not affected qualitatively . since we were not only interested in charge distribution , caspt2 calculations",

    "<S> starting from the structure of the ( ttm - ttp)i@xmath0 molecular - based material , we examine the characteristics of frontier molecular orbitals using _ ab initio _ ( casscf / caspt2 ) configurations interaction calculations . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the singly - occupied and second - highest - occupied molecular orbitals are close to each other , i.e. , this compound should be regarded as a two - orbital system . by dividing virtually the [ ttm - ttp ] molecule into three fragments , </S>",
    "<S> an effective model is constructed to rationalize the origin of this picture . in order to investigate the low - temperature symmetry breaking experimentally observed in the crystal , the electronic distribution in a pair of [ ttm - ttp ] molecules </S>",
    "<S> is analyzed from caspt2 calculations . </S>",
    "<S> our inspection supports and explains the speculated _ intramolecular _ charge ordering which is likely to give rise to low - energy magnetic properties . </S>"
