    "the quantum nature of black holes is one of the most important subjects in theoretical physics , since the theoretical discovery of particle - emissions from a black hole due to quantum effects  @xcite , which are often referred to as the hawking radiation .",
    "although there have been experimental searches for quantum black holes at the cern lhc motivated by the predictions on the basis of theories of tev - scale quantum gravity  @xcite , no evidence of the black hole creation has been observed thus far  @xcite . in this paper , we present a completely different route to experimental studies of quantum gravity by exploiting both holographic principle and unprecedented controllability of optical - lattice systems loaded with ultracold gases  @xcite .    in order to resolve paradoxes associated with the black hole evaporation that results from the hawking radiation , the holographic principle @xcite emerged , which claims that black holes , and more general quantum gravitational theories , are equivalent to non - gravitational theories in different spacetime dimensions .",
    "the gauge / gravity duality conjecture @xcite provides us with concrete setups : this conjecture claims that superstring / m - theory on certain spacetimes are equivalent to quantum field theories .",
    "although this conjecture has not been proven yet , it is believed to be correct at least in some simplest cases .",
    "for example , maximally supersymmetric matrix quantum mechanics ( also known as the matrix model of m - theory @xcite ) , which is believed to describe a black hole in type iia superstring theory near the t hooft large-@xmath0 limit @xcite , has been studied numerically starting in @xcite .",
    "the agreement with the dual superstring theory prediction has been confirmed including the effect of virtual loops of string @xcite .",
    "note that this is not merely ` analogy ' nor ` model ' ; quantum field theories should be literally equivalent to quantum gravitational systems , which means that they are not distinguishable in principle .",
    "thanks to their high controllability and cleanness , experiments with ultracold gases in optical lattices have succeeded in realizing various theoretical models , which were introduced in the contexts of condensed matter physics but did not have quantitative experimental counterparts .",
    "examples include the bose - hubbard model  @xcite , the lieb - liniger model  @xcite , the aubry - andr model  @xcite , the harper hamiltonian  @xcite , and the topological haldane model  @xcite .",
    "there have been theoretical proposals also for realizing lattice gauge models studied in high - energy physics  @xcite .",
    "these circumstances tempt one to expect that it may be possible as well to realize quantum field theories dual to quantum gravitational systems .    in this paper ,",
    "we propose a possible way to create the sachdev - ye - kitaev ( syk ) model  @xcite experimentally with use of ultracold gases in optical lattices .",
    "the syk model consists of spin - polarized fermions with an all - to - all random two - body hopping .",
    "its thermal state is a non - fermi liquid with nonzero entropy at vanishing temperature , which is called the sachdev - ye ( sy ) state  @xcite , and has been conjectured to be dual to charged black holes with two - dimensional anti - de sitter ( ads@xmath1 ) horizons  @xcite . for the purpose of experimental realization , this model is advantageous over the other known models with holography in the sense that it consists of non - relativistic particles and is not supersymmetric .",
    "here we emphasize that the experimental realization of the sy state in optical - lattice systems is equivalent to that of a quantum black hole if the duality is true .",
    "owing to the flexible controllability and diluteness of the optical - lattice system , it will allow for the first experimental investigation for various important properties of quantum black holes , such as the thermodynamics , the formation and evaporation dynamics , and the chaotic properties .",
    "our strategy to achieve the syk model is twofold .",
    "we first simplify the model into a form that can be experimentally accessed more easily .",
    "specifically , we numerically demonstrate that the original syk model , which has a complex two - body hopping with gaussian randomness , can be quantitatively approximated by the model possessing a real two - body hopping mediated via random couplings to multiple molecular states .",
    "second , we show that the latter model can be created by confining ultracold fermionic atoms into a deep optical lattice and utilizing photo - association ( pa ) lasers  @xcite that couple all the combinations of two atomic bands with molecular states .",
    "we discuss the feasibility of this proposed scheme by taking @xmath2li and a double - well optical lattice  @xcite as specific choices of atomic species and lattice configuration .",
    "we also present a protocol to measure two physical quantities characterizing the black hole dual to the sy state , namely out - of - time - order correlation ( otoc ) functions  @xcite and single - particle green s function  @xcite .",

    "@xmath226 , 3 .",
    "@xmath227 , 4 .",
    "@xmath228 , 5 .",
    "@xmath229 , 6 .",
    "@xmath230 , 7 .",
    "measure @xmath231 or @xmath232 ,    where @xmath233 denotes the identity matrix .",
    "@xmath231 and @xmath232 denote the @xmath234 and @xmath235 components of the pauli matrices for the control qubit . taking the offsite case that @xmath236 and @xmath237 , let us elaborate this protocol item by item .",
    "the onsite case can be treated in a very similar way .",
    "first , since @xmath225 is the ground state of an atom in the symmetric double well for @xmath238 , it can be straightforwardly prepared by turning off @xmath221 with use of the feshbach resonance .    in process ( ii ) , we need to annihilate an atom at site @xmath132 when the qubit state is @xmath220 . for this purpose , we prepare a lattice site for an atom in another state @xmath239 , which is neighboring to the syk site as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : otoc](b ) .",
    "this state @xmath239 may be a different hyperfine state or an electronically excited state as long as the linewidth of the state is sufficiently small . at @xmath240 , where @xmath241 denotes the present time during the protocol",
    ", the interaction between the qubit atom and the syk atom is turned on and it is set to be attractive , i.e. , @xmath242 . at the same time , we apply a @xmath243-pulse with frequency @xmath244 , which resonantly couples the @xmath245 and @xmath246 states if there is the qubit atom in the left well , i.e. , if the qubit state is @xmath220 . here",
    "@xmath246 denotes the energy of the lowest band of the atoms in another state .",
    "hence , the application of the @xmath243-pulse leads to the operation of @xmath247 for the @xmath220 state and that of the identity matrix for the @xmath219 state , thus creating process ( ii ) .",
    "we next turn off the atomic interaction and perform the unitary time evolution of the system until @xmath248 .",
    "this corresponds to process ( iii ) . at @xmath248",
    ", we apply a @xmath243-pulse with frequency @xmath249 , which resonantly couples the @xmath250 and @xmath246 states .",
    "this corresponds to the operation of @xmath251 , namely process ( iv ) .",
    "process ( v ) requires the sign of the hamiltonian to be inverted .",
    "although such a manipulation is rather hard in usual systems , it can be made for our sym model simply by inverting the sign of the detuning for all the pa lasers .",
    "we perform the unitary time evolution of the inverted hamiltonian until @xmath252 . at @xmath253 , we set the atomic interaction to be repulsive ( @xmath254 ) and apply a @xmath243-pulse with frequency @xmath255 , which leads to the operation of @xmath247 for the @xmath219 state and no operation for @xmath220 .",
    "this is nothing but process ( vi ) .    in order to obtain @xmath256",
    ", we need to measure the population of the bonding state in the qubit double well .",
    "such a measurement can be made by means of the band - mapping techniques used in ref .",
    "@xcite . on the other hand , in order to obtain @xmath257 , we need to measure the current between the two wells , which is possible using the optical lattice microscope techniques  @xcite .",
    "thus , process ( vii ) is feasible .",
    "it has been also suggested that the degeneracy of the ground state in the syk model can be read off from the low - temperature behavior of the single - particle green s functions  @xcite , @xmath258 we suggest that @xmath259 can be measured in a way very similar to the one described above .",
    "specifically , skipping processes ( iv ) and ( v ) corresponds to a protocol to measure @xmath260 .",
    "the offsite case ( @xmath217 ) is also possible simply by replacing @xmath261 operation in process ( vi ) with @xmath262 .",
    "we have suggested that ultracold gases in optical lattices can be applied to experimental studies of quantum gravity under the assumption of the holographic principle . as a specific example",
    ", we have proposed an experimental design for creating the syk model , whose low - temperature state has been conjectured to be dual to ads@xmath1 black holes  @xcite .",
    "moreover , we have shown how to measure the otoc functions and the single - particle green s function , which characterize black hole properties , with use of a control qubit consisting of an atom in a double well .",
    "we chose our specific example because it looked the simplest one currently available .",
    "however , the syk model is still rather complicated in the sense that it has an unnatural two - body hopping that has to be gaussian random .",
    "hence , it will be useful to explore its simplified variants or other quantum gauge models with holography that can be created more easily in optical - lattice experiments .",
    "for example , the randomness of the coupling in the syk model , which is technically most complicated part for the experimental realization , might be needed only to make the theory analytically solvable .",
    "if one could find a simple system without random coupling , then the experimental realization would become much easier .",
    "we finally note that while the hawking radiation is one of the most important issues regarding quantum black holes , whether the hawking radiation can be seen in the syk model is not clear at this stage . answering to this question",
    "will be an imperative task for future theoretical studies . at very least , a variant of the information puzzle , associated to the way that the information is encoded in a black hole [ 52 ] , should be studied .",

    "firstly let us show that the distribution of @xmath278 converges to @xmath279 for @xmath280 and @xmath281 for @xmath112 .",

    "because the sum with respect to @xmath83 can be regarded as a random walk , the distribution should be gaussian .",
    "then , in order to determine the width , we only have to calculate the average of @xmath293 .",
    "it can be evaluated as @xmath294 which means the width is @xmath6 .",
    "we can also show @xmath295 .",
