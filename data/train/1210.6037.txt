    "have provided tantalizing _ indirect _",
    "evidence for two emerging trends in imf variations .",
    "the first suggests that the imf may be bottom - heavy ( defined as an excess of the ratio of low mass stars to high mass stars with respect to a milky way imf ) in present - epoch early - type galaxies .",
    "complementary observational techniques have arrived at this conclusion , adding to its robustness . for example , recent observations of gravity - sensitive stellar absorption lines ( such as feh  the `` wing - ford '' band  ca ii , and na i among others ) combined with new empirical stellar libraries of cool stars @xcite have been able to distinguish k and m dwarfs from k and m giants , and found the imf to be bottom - heavy in 0 early - type galaxies @xcite .",

    "interestingly , both methods find that the imf varies systematically in a manner that more massive galaxies have increasingly bottom - heavy imfs .",
    "if elliptical galaxies are the end - product of massive starbursts , then the implication is that the imf may show an excess of low - mass stars in heavily star - forming environments .",
    "this is , however , in direct contrast to a number of indirect measurements of the imf in starbursts which all argue that the imf may be _ top - heavy _ in these environments , rather than bottom - heavy .",
    "evidence for this second trend in imf variations comes from a variety of complementary albeit indirect measurements .",
    "@xcite performed simultaneous modeling of the stellar masses , co-  conversion factors and stellar initial mass functions of 2 submillimetre - selected galaxies ( smgs ) , the most rapidly star - forming galaxies in the universe , and found a best fit model with a mass to light ratio roughly half that of a standard kroupa imf .",
    "similarly , @xcite suggested that the colour evolution and mass to light ratios for 1 early - type galaxies may best be explained by a bottom - light imf .",
    "more indirect evidence comes from models that have appealed to a top - heavy imf at 2 to resolve the noted discrepancy between the observed sfr-@xmath3 relation and simulated one @xcite .    some evidence for a top - heavy imf in heavily star - forming systems at 0 exists as well . for example",
    ", @xcite and @xcite suggest that the imf may have a turnover mass a factor @xmath4 larger than traditional @xcite imf in the nearby starburst galaxy m82 ( though see * ? ? ?",

    ", @xcite find evidence for a strong imf - sfr relation in galaxies , such that heavily star forming systems appear to have a more top - heavy imf .",
    "even in the galactic centre , observations suggest that a top - heavy imf may apply @xcite .",
    "while all of these observations can be explained without the need for imf variations , we review many of the arguments against a varying imf in the context of the aforementioned examples . ]",
    ", it is compelling that when a variable imf is inferred for a high - star formation rate surface density environment , it invariably tends toward top - heavy .    in short , while the evidence is by no means firm , deviations from a milky way imf appear to follow two trends : in present - day ellipticals , the imf tends toward an excess of low - mass stars , whereas in heavily star - forming galaxies from 0 - 2 , the imf appears to have an excess of high - mass stars . simultaneously understanding the origin of both of these trends presents a challenge for any theory of the imf .",
    "one possibility is that systematic variations in the imf owe to varying physical conditions in the star - forming molecular ism . @xcite and others ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    ", we explore the cosmic evolution of the imf in galaxies under the jeans conjecture to examine whether a stellar imf that varies with the jeans masses of molecular clouds can explain the tentative evidence for bottom - heavy imfs in early - type galaxies as well as the purported top - heavy imf in high - star formation rate density galaxies .",

    "if the imf is truly bottom - heavy in massive galaxies ( as recent results from stellar absorption line spectra suggest ) , then this poses a challenge for the jeans conjecture , and a bottom - heavy imf at all epochs would more straightforwardly solve the problem ( of course , at the cost of potentially exacerbating possible issues with high - redshift galaxies ) .",
    "observations that distinguish whether the imf varies in heavily star - forming systems , or as a function of formation age ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ) may prove to be a valuable model discriminant .",
    "@xcite present a toy model in which they allow the imf switch from bottom - light to bottom - heavy early during the sfh of a representative galaxy .",
    "this sort of model is able to both reproduce the observed chemical enrichment of massive galaxies , as well as the potential bottom - heavy nature of their imf .",
    "while this model does not self - consistently explain _ why _ the imf should switch rapidly from bottom - light to bottom - heavy , it does give some insight as to what the timing for imf changes should look like during a galaxy s sfh .",
    "if the imf of heavily star - forming galaxies is truly bottom - light , and of their remnants , bottom - heavy , then the @xcite toy model serves as a guide for constraining when and how rapidly the imf needs to change to match observed constraints .",
    "the most basic arguments surrounding the jeans conjecture is that it is not entirely clear what scale one should average over in order to derive the physical conditions in the cloud . in this work",
    ", we assume that the imf scales with global cloud properties , on scales of @xmath8 pc .",
    "if one were to choose significantly smaller scales , as an example , it is possible that the temperature and density would not vary in a manner that kept the jeans mass constant .",
    "a number of works have posited that a reasonable choice for scale may be one where the isothermality of the cloud is broken .",
    "@xcite suggested that this is when the gas becomes energetically coupled to the dust , though other works have argued that the isothermality may be broken due to radiative feedback @xcite .    while we can not resolve these scales , what likely matters most is not the physical conditions in gmcs as a whole , but rather the clumps that form stellar clusters .",
    "our model follows the typical enhancements and decrements of the jeans mass on cloud - wide scales given the physical conditions in a galaxy .",
    "so long as the physical conditions in star - forming clumps within a gmc scale in a self - similar manner with the global physical properties of the molecular cloud , then the galactic environment may indeed play a role in setting the fragmentation scale that impacts the distribution of core masses . from a simulation standpoint ,",
    "some tentative evidence exists that suggests a close connection between the cloud jeans masses and imf .",
    "work by @xcite and @xcite showed that the mass spectrum of collapsed objects varies with the jeans properties of the simulated cloud , and that conditions comparable to starbursts may have turnover masses as large as @xmath162 .",
    "this said , the degree of fragmentation is dependent on the exact form of the equation of state , and the scaling of the turnover mass may depend on the numerical resolution for isothermal simulations .",
    "perhaps the most convincing observational evidence for the jeans conjecture is that it is reasonably well - established that the stellar imf corresponds well with the cloud core mass function in some gmcs @xcite .",
    "if these cores are the result of clump fragmentation that lead to star formation @xcite , then a relationship between the characteristic fragmentation scale and the imf is natural .",
    "there is additionally some evidence from the taurus star - forming region and orion nebula cluster that suggest variations in the imf with cloud density in a manner that is consistent with a jeans scaling @xcite , though the dynamic range of physical conditions on global cloud scales in the galaxy is limited enough that unambiguous evidence for an imf that varies with cloud jeans masses is not yet present .",
    "alma observations will allow for better measurements of the relationship between gmc properties and core mass functions over a range of physical conditions which may shed light on the potential relationship between the stellar imf and cloud jeans mass .    whether the imf varies with the jeans properties of clouds , or",
    "at all with gas physical conditions remains an open question .",
    "while some observations show mild variations , unambiguous evidence for systematic variations are lacking @xcite .",
    "the jeans conjecture equally enjoys its share of tentative observational evidence , as well as contends against cogent theoretical arguments . in this work ,",
    "we remain agnostic as to the validity of the jeans conjecture , but rather simply aim to understand the potential consequences of an imf that scales with global cloud properties .",
    "utilising a combination of hydrodynamic galaxy evolution simulations , a radiative model for the interstellar medium , and cosmological models for the star formation histories of galaxies , we investigate the cosmic evolution of the stellar initial mass function under the assumption that the imf varies with the jeans masses of molecular clouds in galaxies .",
    "the imf can be both top heavy and bottom heavy ( at different times ) for massive galaxies . at early times , the ism is warm owing to the heating of dust by stars , and energy exchange between gas and dust .",
    "this drives jeans masses in molecular clouds up , and , under the jeans conjecture , results in a top - heavy imf .",
    "as galaxies evolve toward present epoch , their sfrs drop below milky way values , and a lack of cosmic rays allows the temperature of the ism to cool below the @xmath7 k characteristic of galactic clouds . at these late times , the typical jeans masses of clouds decreases , and the imf tends toward an excess of low - mass stars ( bottom - heavy ) . newly formed stellar clusters in prsent - epoch massive galaxies will form with a bottom - heavy imf under the jeans conjecture .",
    "this said , the majority of stars formed will have done so in a top - heavy phase , and are thus challenged by stellar absorption - line measurements that suggest that massive galaxies at 0 have imfs that are increasingly bottom - heavy with @xmath71 .",
    "more massive galaxies form a larger number of stellar remnants during their top - heavy phases , and thus have increased @xmath147 ratios .",
    "after convolving our models with stellar population synthesis calcuations , we find that the resultant @xmath147 ratio for massive ellipticals increases with increasing galaxy mass . given plausible galaxy star formation histories , a jeans model for imf variations provides a reasonable match to observed @xmath163 relations for observed elliptical galaxies at 0 .    in short , by exploring the ansatz",
    "that the stellar imf varies with the jeans properties of clouds galaxies , we conclude that a jeans model for imf variations in galaxies is able to simultaneously reproduce the observed @xmath147 ratios of present epoch massive galaxies , while motivating top - heavy imfs at early times that may help alleviate some tensions in high-  galaxy evolution .",
    "the jeans model suggests that increased @xmath147 ratios in present - epoch massive galaxies owes to stellar remnants .",
    "if the imf in massive galaxies is truly bottom - heavy , as gravity - sensitive spectral absorption features may indicate , then the jeans conjecture may not be valid .",
    "we remain agnostic as to the underlying jeans assumption , as well as regarding inferred imf variations at both low and high- . improving constraints on",
    "the imf in starbursting systems and confirming preliminary trends of varying imf with star cluster age would seem to provide viable paths towards discriminating the jeans conjecture model versus models that invoke bottom - heavy imfs throughout the lifetime of today s massive galaxies .",
