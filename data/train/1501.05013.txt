    "in the standard model ( sm ) , the weak charged - current transitions mix quarks of different generations , which is encoded in the unitary cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix  @xcite . in the case of three generations of quarks ,",
    "the physical content of this matrix reduces to four real parameters , among which one phase , the only source of @xmath5 violation in the sm ( neglecting @xmath5-violating effects induced by the strong - interaction @xmath6-term or neutrino masses ) : @xmath7 one can exploit the unitarity of the ckm matrix to determine all its elements ( and when needed , to obtain their wolfenstein expansion in powers of @xmath8 )  @xcite .

    "we find pull values for @xmath15 and @xmath32 of 2.4@xmath35 and 2.5@xmath35 respectively , illustrating the discrepancy between the two constraints in fig .",
    "[ fig : withasl ] .",
    "we do not quote pull values for @xmath36 in sc .",
    "i , as these observables are not constrained once their experimental measurement is removed .",
    "the global constraint on the argument of @xmath37 is more stringent than what could be assumed by the overlap of the constraints from @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath32 .",
    "this can be understood as follows : the fit including np in @xmath4 has a discrete ambiguity in the determination of @xmath40 , so that two solutions ( symmetrical with respect to the origin ) are allowed  @xcite .",
    "this translates into two possibilities for @xmath41 , with opposite signs .",
    "the constraint from @xmath32 also exhibits two preferred solutions for @xmath42 .",
    "these two solutions can not be distinguished at 1 @xmath43 if only @xmath32 is considered , but the degeneracy is lifted in favour of the sm - like solutions once the other constraints are added , leading to a global constraint centered around the solution corresponding to the sm - like solution for @xmath40 , with a domain smaller in size than the constraint from @xmath32    the comparison between the fits with and without @xmath15 shows a slight decrease for @xmath44 when @xmath15 is added , whereas @xmath45 is essentially unchanged .",
    "one notices also that in the absence of @xmath15 , the predicted value of @xmath46 can take two different values ( a small negative one or a large positive one ) , corresponding to the two branches allowed by @xmath47 .",
    "the predicted value for @xmath47 varies significantly when @xmath15 is added or not , since it comes from the combination of the constraint from @xmath0 measurements with the semileptonic asymmetries .",
    "this yields a noticeable change in the prediction for @xmath48 .",
    "even though the predictions for @xmath49 and @xmath50 also seem to vary , this mainly concerns the best - fit point and is much less the case once @xmath51 intervals are considered .",
    "one can also consider the @xmath52-value of the sm hypothesis following the discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite . without @xmath15 ,",
    "the @xmath52-value for the 2d sm hypothesis @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) is 0.9  @xmath43 ( 0.3  @xmath43 ) , and the 4d sm hypothesis @xmath55 has a p - value of 0.7  @xmath43 . with @xmath15 , the @xmath52-value for the 2d sm hypothesis @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) is 1.2  @xmath43 ( 0.3  @xmath43 ) , and the 4d sm hypothesis @xmath55 has a p - value of 1.0  @xmath43 .    the two complex np parameters @xmath56 and @xmath37 ( parametrising np in @xmath57 ) are not sufficient to absorb the discrepancy between the d  measurement of @xmath15 and the rest of the global fit . the situation has however improved compared to earlier analyses , due to the decreased discrepancy of @xmath15 compared to the standard model . without @xmath15 , the fit including np in @xmath4 is good , but the improvement with respect to the sm is limited .",
    "in addition , we stress that data still allow sizeable np contributions in both @xmath58 and @xmath59 sectors up to 30 - 40% at the 3@xmath43 level .",
    "this article collects a selection of sm predictions driven by the global fit of the ckm parameters , in view of related recent or foreseeable experimental measurements .",
    "the results were obtained by combining the inputs collected in table  [ tab : expinputs ] , using the statistical frequentist framework adopted by the ckmfitter group .",
    "the overall agreement of the standard model global fit is impressive , as confirmed by the representation of the various unitarity triangles and the results given in table  [ tab : pred : meas ] , gathering the sm predictions using the inputs .",
    "we discussed the status of some quantities of importance whose status has changed recently ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath60 ) .",
    "we also provided predictions for various observables of interest , as well as a table of pulls .",
    "we have also performed a global fit to flavour physics data in a scenario with generic new phiscs in the @xmath61 and @xmath62 amplitudes , as defined in refs .",
    "the discrepancy between @xmath15 and the rest of the neutral - meson mixing observables remains even in this extended scenario . if we remove @xmath15 , because of the potentially large ( and unknown ) systematics affecting its extraction , the fit improves significantly , with a sm - like scenario being very likely .",
    "however , significant contributions from np are still possible at the 3@xmath43 level .",
    "this is an invitation for more study of these observables with the lhcb upgrade and the start of belle - ii , as discussed in the prospective exercise of ref .",
