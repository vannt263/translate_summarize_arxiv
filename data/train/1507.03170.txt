    "diffuse x - ray emission from normal early type galaxies ( etg ) was first detected in the virgo cluster with the _ einstein _ x - ray observatory @xcite .",
    "although in a few cases ( e.g. , m86 ) the displacement of the x - ray emission from the stellar body of the galaxy pointed to hot gaseous halos , the @xmath8 arcminute resolution of the _ einstein ipc _ data could not disentangle observationally hot halos from the populations of low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) , which was likely to dominate the x - ray emission in a large number of the observed etgs @xcite . nonetheless , several authors discussed how the x - ray emission and the inferred hot gas contribution could be used to constrain both the binding mass of the galaxies and the physical evolution of the hot halos , including feedback from snia and agns , and interaction with intracluster and group media .",
    "thanks to the high spatial resolution of _ chandra _ and imaging / spectral capabilities of the acis detector @xcite , it has become possible to directly detect and characterize the different contributions to the x - ray emission of etgs in the near universe . with _",
    "chandra _ , lmxb populations - both associated with globular clusters ( gc ) and in the stellar field of the etg - have been studied to distances of several tens of megaparsecs ( e.g. , @xcite ; see review by ) .",
    "the integrated lmxb luminosity correlates well with the integrated etg stellar luminosity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the scatter in this relation is a factor of 2 - 3 , and it depends on both gc content @xcite , and the age of the stellar population @xcite .",
    "these detailed high resolution studies allowed ( * ? ? ?",
    "* bkf11 ) to accurately estimate the gaseous contribution to the x - ray luminosity @xmath9 of a sample of 30 etgs within 32 mpc . after subtracting lmxb , stellar , and nuclear contributions to the x - ray luminosity ,",
    "bkf11 found steep scaling relations between @xmath9 and both the stellar @xmath10 luminosity and the hot gas temperature @xmath11 .",
    "subsequent work by kim & fabbiano ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* kf13 ) ; ( * ? ? ?",

    "_ chandra _ deep field studies ( both detections and stacking of almost 1,000 etgs ) found that the mean @xmath13 of @xmath14 etgs remains equal or mildly increases over @xmath15 and that the ratio of the soft x - ray luminosity to the b - band luminosity evolves mildly as @xmath16 since @xmath17 @xcite , suggesting some heating mechanism preventing the hot gas from cooling , consistent with mechanical heating from radio agns .",
    "the evolution of the x - ray binary contribution to the x - ray emission ( both of lmxbs and high mass binaries ) across cosmic time , modeled by @xcite , led @xcite to conclude that energy feedback from x - ray binaries is also important in the early universe .    the cosmos survey , covering @xmath18 square degrees of sky with multi - wavelength coverage , which includes _ chandra _ x - ray coverage @xcite , has increased the available sample of etgs to over 6,600 galaxies ( * ? ? ?",
    "this survey provides a good z coverage out to @xmath19 ( and a few galaxies are detected out to @xmath20 ) .",

    "in particular , c14 focused on the relation between @xmath9 and the k - band stellar luminosity ( @xmath10 ) of etgs which is a good proxy of stellar mass for old stellar systems .",
    "the latter has been evaluated in the local universe by bkf11 as @xmath21 for sources with @xmath22 , while including sources with @xmath9 up to @xmath23 kf13 found a steeper @xmath24 relation .",

    "however , more distant ( @xmath26 ) and younger stellar age galaxies generally fall outside the relation observed in the local sample , and are x - ray overluminous with respect to their @xmath10 . for these sources",
    "c14 suggested that the higher x - ray luminosity may be due to the presence of hidden agns ( as suggested by observed hardness ratios ) , merging phenomena , which are expected to increase the halo x - ray luminosity , or nuclear accretion ( that could also induce agn activity during the merging phase , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in this work",
    "we perform a stacking analysis of the c - cosmos etg data in order to investigate the nature of fainter , x - ray undetected etgs .",

    "this stacking study also allow us to further explore redshift dependencies .",
    "our aim is to explore the properties of the non - stellar x - ray emission , i.e. the x - ray emission resulting from the subtraction of the expected x - ray binary contribution ( taking into account the cosmic evolution of the x - ray binary population * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the resulting emission will probe both hot x - ray halos and the possible emission of active nuclei in these galaxies .",
    "in particular , the large number of low - stellar - mass etgs in the sample will provide a unique probe of the existence of relatively low - mass massive black holes in their nuclei .",

    "we also collected additional galaxy properties ( stellar mass , age and star formation rate ) from @xcite , and we made use of the most recent near - infrared photometry from the ultra deep survey with the vista telescope . and @xmath31 may not necessarily be completely equivalent . ]",
    "we selected galaxies classified as e or s0 and that have a reliable photometric redshift @xcite .",
    "in addition we selected only sources with ultra - vista detection both in j and k bands , since these are needed to evaluate the rest frame @xmath10 ( see below ) .",
    "this narrows our sample to 10,808 ( the cosmos etg sample considered in c14 ) .",
    "we then selected only the 6436 etgs falling in the c - cosmos field , and then excluded the 48 x - ray detected etgs in common with the c - cosmos identification catalog @xcite .",
    "this leads us to our final sample of 6388 c - cosmos etgs - not detected in x - rays - which constitutes the starting point of the stacking analysis described in this paper .",
    "note that we selected sources with photometric redshift estimate in the catalog by @xcite , while c14 selected their sources to have a spectroscopic or photometric redshift estimates in the c - cosmos identification catalog , so the sample of etgs selected by the latter authors ( @xmath32 sources ) is not fully contained in our sample .",
    "following c14 we evaluated the k band luminosity of our sources from the ultra - vista k - band aperture magnitude of the cosmos photometric catalog . to calculate the rest frame k band luminosities we assumed a power law spectrum ( as appropriate over this small frequency range ) @xmath33 with @xmath34 ( where j and k are the ab magnitudes from the cosmos photometric catalog and @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the corresponding frequencies ) , and express the rest frame luminosities in solar luminosity as @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the photometric redshift from the cosmos catalog",

    "we compared the distributions of the physical parameters of the 6388 c - cosmos etgs with the entire 10,808 cosmos etg sample finding no significant difference , demonstrating as expected that the sample of etgs not detected in x - ray is representative of cosmos etgs overall .",
    "note that the luminosity threshold is a function of redshift because of the uniform magnitude limit of the ultra - vista cosmos survey ( @xmath40 , ) .",
    "the specific star formation rate for the majority of the etgs is in the regime where @xcite defines galaxies as quiescent , although higher star formation rate is observed in young etgs .",

    "masses and luminosities are in agreement with those of the k - selected elliptical galaxies of @xcite , extracted from a small area of the cosmos field .",
    "below we describe the procedures followed in our stacking analysis .",
    "the results are summarized in tables [ tab : stack ] and [ tab : stack_z ] .",
    "we used all 49 c - cosmos observations to evaluate source and background counts for our sample of etgs , excluding data in the acis - i chip gaps .",
    "we also excluded data from x - ray detected sources removing counts within a 10  radius of all sources in the c - cosmos source identification catalog @xcite .",
    "we replaced the excluded counts by sampling the poisson distribution of the pixel values nearby background regions with dmfilth ciao task .",
    "when a source lay in the field of view of more than one observation , we combined the data from the different observations using the prescriptions from @xcite , excluding observations where the source was more than 10 acrmin off - axis from the aim point .    due to the variation of the _ chandra _ point spread function ( psf ) radius @xmath41 , we used an extraction radius @xmath42 that was determined by the source position in each observation in order to extract an optimal fraction of x - ray photons from the diffuse halo . for sources with morphological information available in the _",

    "this method suppresses the noise in the background annulus , but also removes signal from the source , only pixels with two or more counts were clipped . ] .",
    "lastly , we divided the background annulus into eight @xmath55 degree sectors , and excluded all the sectors in which the mean count value was larger than @xmath54 , thus excluding regions of higher background without removing signal from the source . the net counts @xmath56 obtained with all three methods are consistent within statistics , so in the following we adopted the clipping procedure of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* method b ) .    to test the robustness of our results we also extracted counts from positions on the sky offset from the etg",

    "note that , at a given redshift , younger galaxies have larger fading correction than older ones . to compare our results with those of kf13 and c14 we considered sources with @xmath59 .",

    "we also plot in figure [ fig : volonteri ] the predictions from @xcite of @xmath155 for three values of @xmath85 for both efficient and radiatively inefficient accretion flows ( riafs * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "these authors models use the stellar density profile scaling with stellar mass , and predict the accretion rate from the normal stellar mass loss due to stellar evolution , and the consequent massive black hole luminosity for various radiative efficiencies gyr of c - cosmos etgs , which yields slightly smaller emitted x - ray luminosities ( see eq . 9 in @xcite ) . ] .",
    "the x - ray luminosity coming from accretion is computed as @xmath156 , where @xmath157 is the x - ray fraction of the bolometric luminosity , and @xmath158 is the accretion rate in eddington units with a @xmath159 accretion efficiency .",
    "radiatively efficient accretion flows have @xmath160 , while inefficient ones have @xmath161 , and for them @xmath162 .",
    "in order to compare our results with @xcite models we converted the @xmath163 lmxb subtracted counts into @xmath164 band luminosities , @xmath165 assuming a pow - law spectrum as appropriate for agn spectra . based on these models , inefficient accretion into the nuclei",
    "could explain even all the @xmath71 of the massive , high @xmath71 etgs ( green points ) , except for the most luminous ones , which are likely to be compton thick agns ( see above ) .",
    "the low - mass x - ray overluminous etgs ( red points ) are also consistent with the @xcite model . considering that a large fraction of the x - ray emission is due to hot gas ( see above ) ,",
    "the grey points show instead a possible agn emission even lower than predicted for radiatively inefficient accretion . in these etgs ,",
    "the @xmath71 is consistent with the local @xmath166 relation .",
    "this result can have the following possible explanations , that are not mutually exclusive .    1 .",
    "the volonteri et al.s models assume that the whole of their estimated mass accretion rate ( coming from the instantaneous mass loss of all stars , and obtained by integrating over the whole stellar density profile ) indeed reaches the massive black hole , while this represents an upper limit on the mass accretion rate of the massive black hole ( some gas may be outflowing , or may reach the massive black hole with a delay , or may possess angular momentum and form a disk , etc . ) .",
    "the accreting mass , that has already entered the accretion radius , is reduced on its way to the massive black hole , due to a wind from a riaf @xcite ; similarly , close to the nucleus , there may be a heating mechanism for the accreting gas , as a nuclear jet , again impeding or lowering the accretion rate ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "accretion onto the black hole is ( temporarily ) not taking place , as may be the case during feedback - regulated activity cycles .",
    "numerical simulations show that , during these cycles , agn outbursts are followed by major degassing of the circumnuclear region , with a precipitous drop of the nuclear accretion rate ; the outbursts are separated by long time intervals during which the galaxy is replenished again by gas from the stellar mass losses , until a new nuclear outburst takes place @xcite .",
    "4 .   @xmath167 might be lower than 1 as assumed here ( see also @xcite ) , or that @xmath168 at low @xmath169 decreases faster than adopted in the volonteri et al.s models , so that lower @xmath155 should be predicted .",
    "our results extend to higher x - ray luminosities a recent analysis of etgs in the amuse survey of virgo and field galaxies with _ chandra _ @xcite . amuse results indicate a significant presence of supermassive black holes in low stellar mass galaxies . due to the lower redshifts of the amuse etgs ,",
    "that survey is sensitive to x - ray luminosities ( @xmath170 ) one order of magnitude fainter are than our faintest bin 1 ( @xmath171 ) . for these dim sources the stellar wind accretion proposed by @xcite would predict higher x - ray luminosities than those observed , @xcite",
    "conclude that these black holes are probably powered by inefficient advection dominated accretion flows or , alternatively , by an outflow / jet component .",
    "we found that low - luminosity , x - ray  overluminous \" etgs can be adequately described by the riaf fueled by stellar winds as proposed by @xcite . instead ,",
    "etgs with @xmath172 may host compton thick agns .",
    "similarly , when comparing with the results of @xcite and @xcite on _ chandra _ deep fields , we extend to higher x - ray luminosities and to lower optical luminosities ( that is , lower stellar masses ) , finding sources that significantly exceed the expected emission from hot - gas dominated etgs , with @xmath173 ( see figure 7 in @xcite ) .",
    "we also note that , as reported by , the revision of black hole scaling relations by indicate that the local mass density in black holes should be five times higher than previous estimates .",
    "these authors advance the possibility that a sizeable population of highly obscured agns with covering fraction of obscuring material @xmath174 would explain the revised upward value of the smbh local mass density without exceeding the limits imposed by the x - ray and ir background .",
    "an example of these obscured agns can be that observed in the etg eso565-g019 with _",
    "suzaku _ and _",
    "swift_/bat @xcite .",
    "finally , we note that the hard x - ray slopes of the more luminous etg bins could be due to contamination from x - ray jets .",
    "however , the combined 1.4ghz vla cosmos large and deep project catalogs @xcite offer radio counterparts only to @xmath175 of our sample of etgs .",
    "the presence of radio emitters among non x - ray detected etgs will be addressed after the release of the jvla - cosmos project data .",
    "we have followed up our previous work ( c14 ) investigating the x - ray / k - band properties of the 69 etgs detected in the chandra cosmos survey @xcite , with a luminosity and hardness ratio stacking analysis of the _ chandra _ data for the sample of 6388 early type galaxies ( etgs ) not detected in x - rays .",
    "the stacking analysis allows the investigation of the average features of individually x - ray undetected etgs .",
    "our etg sample was selected as representative of normal galaxies , with no evidence of agn emission in their spectra and multi - band photometry ( c14 , section 2 ) .",
    "our purpose was to investigate the properties of the x - ray emission from hot gas and from possible  hidden \" agn components that may be revealed by their x - ray emission .",
    "to this purpose , the expected contribution of lmxbs was subtracted from the x - ray luminosity of each stacked bin , using established scaling relations with the k - band luminosity ( bkf11 ) .",
    "all luminosities were corrected to the local rest frame ; x - ray hardness ratios were based on the observed counts ( after subtraction of the lmxb contribution ) , and were compared to emission models for the appropriate average bin redshift .      1",
    ".   on average agn emission may be present in all etgs .",
    "2 .   agns may be faint and hidden in hot gas dominated etgs , which are consistent with the local universe scaling relation of virialized halos ( kf13 , kf15 , see c14 ) .",
    "3 .   agn emission appears to dominate the non - stellar x - ray emission in low - stellar mass etgs ( @xmath176 in solar units ) , which show marked x - ray luminosity excesses relative to their k - band luminosity ( a proxy of stellar mass ) , when compared with the local etg @xmath177 relation of the local universe ( bkf11 ) .",
    "this result confirms the conclusions of c14 and extends them to lower stellar mass galaxies .",
    "agn emission is also prominent in higher redshift etgs ( @xmath126 , @xmath127 ) especially those with x - ray luminosity @xmath178 .",
    "the latter group have hr values suggesting highly absorbed compton thick agns .",
    "we note that these agns were not visible in the cosmos colors and spectra , since agns were excluded by our etg sample ( c14 ) .",
    "5 .   given the nuclear bh mass predicted by the @xmath179 relation , the hidden agns in the x - ray over - luminous low stellar mass etgs are consistent with the presence of radiatively inefficient accretion fueled by stellar outgassing @xcite .",
    "the highly absorbed higher @xmath71 agns hidden in massive , higher z etgs instead suggest efficient accretion in highly obscured nuclei .",
