    "any single - mode gaussian channel @xmath33 can be reduced to a simpler ` canonical form ' up to gaussian unitaries , applied at the input and the output of the channel .",

    "@xcite for this formalism ) .",
    "they transform the cm @xmath143 of an input state as @xmath144 , with channel matrices @xmath145 and @xmath146  which are diagonal .",
    "the most typical and important canonical forms are phase - insensitive , with @xmath145 and @xmath146 both proportional to the identity , of the form @xmath147 where @xmath110 is the transmissivity and @xmath111 is thermal noise .",
    "the first example is the lossy channel ( form @xmath141 ) for which @xmath47 $ ] and @xmath148 with @xmath149 . in terms of the quadrature operators",
    "@xmath150 its action is expressed by the input - output transformations@xmath151 where @xmath152 are the quadratures of an environmental mode in a thermal state with variance @xmath153 , with @xmath154 being the mean number of thermal photons . at the border , for @xmath155 , this channel coincides with the form @xmath137 which is a completely depolarizing channel . for @xmath49",
    ", it just becomes an identity channel ( a particular instance of the form @xmath140 ) .",
    "the second example is the additive - noise channel ( form @xmath140 ) , which has @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "this channel corresponds to the transformation @xmath156 where @xmath157 is a classical random variable with cm  @xmath158 .",
    "the final example of phase - insensitive canonical form is the amplifier channel ( another kind of form @xmath141 ) which has @xmath159 and @xmath160 .",
    "this is realized by @xmath161 where @xmath152 are the quadratures of a thermal mode .",
    "then , we have canonical forms which are sensitive to phase .",
    "the most important is the form @xmath142 which is the conjugate of the amplifier channel , i.e. , the environmental output of a two - mode squeezer which dilates the amplifier channel .",
    "this form can be associated with negative transmissivities @xmath96 and is described by the matrices @xmath162 with @xmath163 and @xmath164 .",
    "its sensitivity to phase is clear from the fact that @xmath165 .",
    "it corresponds to the transformation@xmath166    in the main paper , our phase - insensitive gaussian channel is given by the forms @xmath141 and @xmath140 , while our extended gaussian channel is given by the forms @xmath141 , @xmath140 and @xmath142 .",

    "the output entropy of this extended gaussian channel is minimized by taking a coherent state at the input  @xcite .",
    "finally , we have the ` pathological ' canonical forms @xmath138 and @xmath139 , which are highly phase - sensitive .",
    "in particular , form @xmath138 is described by @xmath171 while form @xmath139 is described by @xmath172 form @xmath138 is highly symmetric in the transmission matrix , and represents a sort of ` half ' depolarizing channel which replaces one of the input quadratures with thermal noise .",
    "when this form is locally applied to a bipartite state , it completely destroys the correlations in one of the quadratures .",
    "by contrast , @xmath139 is highly asymmetric in the noise matrix and its effect is to add a unit of vacuum noise to only one of the quadratures .    for these pathological forms",
    ", the optimal input state is expected to be a squeezed vacuum .",
    "indeed , this can easily be proven for @xmath139 , for which the optimal input state is an infinitely - squeezed vacuum , with cm @xmath173 where @xmath174 .",
    "in fact , at the output we have a gaussian state with covariance matrix  @xmath175 whose determinant goes to @xmath128 , so that it is asympotically pure .",
    "this implies that the output entropy goes to zero , i.e. , to its minimum value .",
    "however , if we enforce an energy constraint at the input of this form , then we do not know the optimal input state which minimizes the output entropy .",
    "the situation is more involved for the other form @xmath138 . when @xmath176 , this is the conjugate channel of @xmath139 in a unitary dilation with a pure environment ( stinespring dilation ) . since the global output of this dilation is pure for an input pure state",
    "( we can always restrict the search to pure states due to the concavity of the entropy ) , we have that the output entropy of the conjugate channel @xmath138 is equal to the output entropy of @xmath139 .",
    "this trivially implies that the infinitely - squeezed vacuum is again the optimal input state .",
    "however , for @xmath177 , the dilation involves a thermal environment , and the optimality of this state is only conjectured for @xmath138 .",
    "furthermore , also for this form , the optimal input is not known if we enforce an energy constraint .",
