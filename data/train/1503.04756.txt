    "solar wind charge - exchange ( swcx ) occurs when a high charge state ion in the solar wind charge - exchanges with a neutral ; the resultant ion is in an excited state and in the transition to the ground state a photon is produced in either the soft x - ray or extreme ultraviolet . since the solar wind is temporally variable in density , speed , elemental abundance , and ionization fraction , the observed swcx emission varies as a function of time , look direction , and observatory location .",
    "the charge - exchange spectrum has the same transitions , from the same ions , with nearly the same strengths , as a purely recombining plasma , and thus makes a strong contribution to the lines used for astrophysical plasma diagnostics ( see , for example , the discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . because the swcx emission will be smooth over the fov of any recent , current , or near future x - ray instrument , and since it has no unique spectral signatures , it is a particularly problematic foreground to remove from observations of any diffuse emission that also fills the fov , such as that expected from the local hot bubble , the galactic bulge and halo , and the warm - hot intergalactic medium .",
    "it is also problematic for many observations of clusters of galaxies , nearby galaxies , local supernova remnants , and super bubbles .",
    "indeed , the uncertainty in the strength of the swcx emission in the _ rosat _  @xmath0 kev  band has led to significant controversy over the existence of the local hot bubble ( lhb ) .",
    "the clearest evidence for the soft x - ray emission from the lhb is significant emission in front of nearby ( @xmath5 pc ) molecular clouds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the distribution of hot gas was derived from an all - sky anti - correlation analysis @xcite which showed a rather hourglass shaped distribution where the waist is in the galactic plane , and the bulges extend towards the galactic poles . if , however , the bulk of the emission attributed to the lhb were actually due to swcx , then the lhb might not exist , and the distribution of the remaining hot gas could be explained in other ways @xcite .",
    "various other data , such as the pressure difference between the hot gas and the local interstellar clouds @xcite , the distribution of to refer to the parent ion . ]",
    "emission from the lhb - cool cloud interfaces ( * ? ? ?",
    "* among others ) , the shape of the local cavity @xcite , and the magnetic field in the wall of the lhb @xcite were variously deployed to argue both for and against the existence of the lhb . while it was generally recognized that some part of the soft x - ray emission previously attributed to the lhb is indeed due to swcx , estimates of the fraction of the emission due to swcx varied greatly ( compare , for example * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "further confusion arose because the more reliable calculations for the swcx emission were made in the @xmath4 kev  band , which is dominated by a few strong lines , while the bulk of the lhb emission is in the @xmath0 kev  band where swcx calculations are both difficult and highly uncertain .",
    "that uncertainty arises from the lack of reliable charge - exchange cross - sections for the multitude of faint lines that form the bulk of the @xmath0 kev  band emission .    in the intervening years ,",
    "observational verification of calculations of swcx emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) has focussed on the and lines because those lines are accessible to _ chandra _ , _ xmm - newton _ , and _ suzaku _ , while the @xmath0 kev  band is not .",
    "while such work has explored issues concerning the distribution of the neutral material with which the solar wind charge - exchanges and the structure of the solar wind itself , progress on the validation of our calculation of the swcx emission in the @xmath0 kev  band has been minimal . while the number of measured or calculated charge - exchange cross - sections",
    "has grown ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and several other studies in preparation ) , these do not yet form a sufficient database with which to calculate reliably the swcx emission in the @xmath0 kev  band . however , even if all of the contributing charge - exchange cross sections and branching ratios were well known , modeling of the swcx emission would still be problematic because of the lack of sufficiently detailed abundance and ionization state information for the solar wind .",
    "the dxl sounding rocket observation @xcite of the he focussing cone ( the region where the sun gravitationally focuses the interstellar he flowing through the solar system ) in the wisconsin c - band allows a more empirical approach ; the ratio of the observed x - ray emission to the model emission measure provides a broad - band abundance - weighted cross - section , or production factor . although the wisconsin c - band is not exactly the _ rosat _  @xmath0 kev  band , they are sufficiently similar that scaling from one to the other does not introduce significant uncertainties",
    ". however , dxl only provides the production factor for swcx with he ( the is h being strongly depleted near the he focussing cone ) , whereas a comparable emission is expected from swcx with h , both from the interstellar h flowing through the solar system and the exospheric h in the earth s magnetosheath .",
    "here we derive a _ rosat _",
    "@xmath0 kev  band production factor for swcx with h that requires no more than existing data and the application of relatively off - the - shelf magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) simulations .",
    "this work has implications beyond the lhb .",
    "study of the earth s magnetosheath has been carried out through _ in situ _ measurements of the particle populations and magnetic fields .",
    "however , there has been no means of imaging the entire magnetosheath at the timescales necessary for capturing the driving physical processes .",
    "imaging of the magnetosphere in the soft x - rays produced by swcx with either a wide - field imager in earth orbit , or a more traditional instrument in solar orbit can cover the entire magnetosphere @xcite .",
    "the primary issue with such an imager is the effective cadence , which can be determined only in the light of the expected flux . given",
    "that the magnetosheath swcx is due primarily to charge - exchange with h , and given that that emission is primarily in the @xmath0 kev  band , then the production factor derived in this paper is essential for such calculation .",
    "since there are multiple sites of swcx , besides comets and the atmospheres and surfaces of other planets , it is useful to define three different types of swcx emission based on location and phenomenology .",
    "the _ magnetosheath swcx _ is due to the solar wind plasma interacting with the neutrals , primarily h , in the earth s extended atmosphere , or exosphere .",
    "the terrestrial magnetic field is an obstacle to the charged particles that form the solar wind .",
    "the _ magnetopause _ is the surface where the ram pressure of the solar wind is balanced by the pressure of the terrestrial magnetic field . since the solar wind is supersonic and super - alfvenic , a roughly parabolic bow shock forms upstream of the magnetopause .",
    "the _ magnetosheath _ , the region between the magnetopause and the bow shock , contains shocked solar wind plasma . behind the nose of the bow shock ,",
    "that plasma has a density roughly four times higher than that in the free - flowing solar wind ; as the plasma flows away from the nose into the flanks of the magnetosheath , its density decreases and its velocity increases .",
    "the typical _ stand - off _ distance of the magnetopause in the direction of the sun is @xmath6 r@xmath7 from the earth , but varies with the solar wind ram pressure as @xmath8 .",
    "the magnetosheath has a thickness of a few r@xmath7 that varies with solar wind parameters . as the solar wind flux increases , the magnetopause is pushed deeper into the exosphere , so that the increased solar wind flux interacts with a higher neutral density , and the x - ray emissivity increases drastically .",
    "the continuous compression and expansion of the magnetosphere causes the magnetosheath swcx to be strongly time - variable . because the magnetosheath plasma fluxes decrease with distance from the nose of the bowshock , the observed magnetosheath swcx emission is also strongly dependent on the observation geometry .",
    "simulations of the soft x - ray emissivity in the gse - xz plane are shown in figure  [ fig : ms_demo ] .",
    "the _ local heliospheric swcx _ is due to the interaction of the solar wind with the neutral interstellar medium ( ism ) flowing through the solar system . due to ionization and solar wind pressure ,",
    "the h component of the ism is mostly excluded from the inner solar system , leaving predominately the he component .",
    "the emissivity declines with distance from the sun , due to the @xmath9 dependence of the solar wind density , so the heliospheric emission will be dominated by more local emission .",
    "although the solar wind is highly variable , it is , in the absence of a strong coronal mass ejection ( cme ) , strongly ordered in the parker spiral pattern .",
    "thus , the local heliospheric emission is temporally variable and dependent on the look direction , but not so strongly as the magnetospheric emission . a simulation of the soft x - ray emissivity in the earth s orbital plane is shown in figure  [ fig : plane_demo ] .",
    "the _ distant heliospheric swcx _ is due to the solar wind interacting with both interstellar h and he .",
    "the pathlengths are long , so the time variability is strongly reduced , but should reflect the solar cycle . due to the roughly parabolic shape of the heliosphere , the strength must depend upon the look direction .",
    "the `` upwind '' direction is roughly @xmath10 @xcite which suggests that the ism flow is due both to the solar peculiar motion as well as either radial gas motion in the galaxy or expansion from the loop i superbubble ( see the review by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the following",
    ", this component will be taken as temporally constant .    for completeness",
    ", it should be noted that there will be swcx due to the heliopause , but this will be a minor component . using the @xcite model for the distribution of interstellar neutrals in the heliosphere and the o@xmath11 cross - section therein , one can show that the fraction of o@xmath11 ions reaching a nominal heliopause at @xmath12 au is @xmath13% . if one makes the ( unlikely ) assumption that all the remaining ions charge - exchange in the heliopause , the ratio of heliopause emission to the total heliospheric emission is @xmath14 .",
    "assuming cross - sections of a similar order of magnitude for all of the species emitting in the @xmath0 kev  band , the heliopause is not a significant contributor to the heliospheric swcx .",
    "recent efforts have attempted to determine which of the temporally variable components dominates the swcx `` contamination '' of _ xmm - newton _  or _",
    "chandra _",
    "observations @xcite .",
    "the results have been equivocal and suggest that both components of the emission _ can _ be important in different situations .",
    "the simulations required to determine the swcx production factor bring new insights to this issue and will be discussed below .",
    "the swcx emission in a single emission line is given by the integral along the line of sight : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the density of neutral targets , @xmath17 is the solar wind proton density @xmath18 is the relative velocity of the neutrals and the ions , @xmath19 is the ratio of the density of the ion producing the line to the proton density , @xmath20 is the velocity - weighted interaction cross - section , and @xmath21 is the fraction of interactions that produce a photon in the line of interest .",
    "it is necessary to use an averaged interaction cross - section since the interaction cross - section is velocity dependent .",
    "however , the velocity dependence is generally small over the range of velocities found in the solar wind , so the uncertainty introduced by the need to weight by the velocity distribution is generally on the order of the uncertainty in the cross - section itself ( see , for example , the catalogue of cross - sections in * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the relative velocity of the ions and the neutrals is given by @xmath22 where @xmath23 for the solar wind .",
    "semi - empirical models of the distribution of the neutral material within the line of sight exist @xcite , as do semi - empirical models for the solar wind @xcite and measurements of the solar wind at the earth .",
    "thus , one should be able to calculate the swcx emission within a given line of sight at a given time , though only to within the rather large uncertainty inherent in the models .",
    "however , the primary problem is that the interaction cross - sections , @xmath20 , and branching ratios , @xmath21 , are poorly measured , particularly in the energy range of astrophysical interest ( see the extensive discussion of alternative methods in * ? ? ?",
    ". however , some important single lines , such as and have been somewhat characterized .",
    "the vast number of faint blended lines that contribute to the @xmath0 kev  band , however , have not .",
    "since , with the notable exception of the diffuse x - ray spectrometer @xcite and x - ray quantum calorimeter @xcite , the @xmath0 kev  band has not been observed with sufficiently high spectral resolution to identify line complexes , let alone individual lines , we must deal with the aggregate of all of these lines .",
    "in such a case the @xmath0 kev  band emission can be written as @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the _ production factor _ for the energy band , summing over all of the different species emitting in the band .",
    "it is the aim of this paper to determine @xmath26 for the _ rosat _  @xmath0 kev  band .",
    "the above expression is often simplified to @xmath27 where @xmath28 this expression assumes that the ionization structure is constant along the line of sight .",
    "although such an assumption is surely incorrect , we will see the degree to which it is immaterial ; the magnetosheath is smaller than the spatial / temporal scales upon which we can currently measure the changes in the ionization structure while the heliosphere is so large that the variations disappear when integrating along the line of sight .",
    "our primary source for @xmath0 kev  data is the _ rosat",
    "_  all - sky survey ( rass ) . in the course of constructing the maps from the survey",
    ", it was realized that there was a temporally variable component of the soft x - ray background whose frequencies ranged from hours to days .",
    "longer - term variations could not be characterized with the rass , while shorter term variations were identified with other phenomena , such as aurorae , and discarded .",
    "@xcite first suggested that these long - term enhancements ( lte , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) were correlated with the solar wind and @xcite demonstrated the correlation more concretely . since the foreground rate towards the dark moon was roughly consistent with the lte rate at the time of the observation @xcite , it would seem that the lte were due to swcx in the magnetosheath where the neutral species charge - exchanging with the solar wind is predominately h. in this case , one should be able to use an mhd model of the magnetosphere for the spatial distribution of the solar wind ions in the near earth environment , a model of the h distribution in the exosphere , and measurements of the local solar wind flux to calculate the quantity @xmath29 here , @xmath30 is the density of exospheric neutral h and @xmath31 is the @xmath32 for the magnetosheath alone .",
    "the ratio between the observed lte rate and @xmath33 should yield the production factor , @xmath26 , for the @xmath0 kev  band for solar wind charge - exchange with neutral h.    there are , of course , a number of complications to be considered .",
    "the primary complication is the local heliospheric swcx emission , which is due to the interaction of the solar wind with ( predominately ) neutral interstellar he flowing through the solar system .",
    "if the lte flux were correlated with the local heliospheric swcx emission , we would need to remove the variation due to the local heliosphere from the lte light - curve before determining the production rate from the magnetosheath . in the following",
    ", we will use a mhd model of the solar wind and a semi - empirical model of the interplanetary distribution of neutral h and he to measure the correlation between the local heliospheric swcx emission and the local solar wind flux .",
    "we will show that the local heliospheric emission provides a negligible contribution to the lte rate .    to address the issue of the existence of the lhb requires more than the h production factor ( derived here ) , and the he production factor derived by @xcite ,",
    "it requires careful understanding of the shape of the heliosphere and the extent of emission from the heliopause .",
    "both of these issues are beyond the scope of this work and will be addressed in the future .    in the following ,",
    " 2 describes the lte data , the solar wind data , the mhd model of the magnetosphere , the mhd model of the solar wind for @xmath34 au , the semi - empirical model of the interplanetary distribution of neutral h and he , and the semi - empirical model of the earth s exosphere .",
    "section 3.1 describes the correlation between the local solar wind flux ( @xmath35 ) and the magnetosheath emissivity while  3.2 describes the correlation between the _ rosat _  lte and the local solar wind flux .",
    "section 3.3 demonstrates that the local heliospheric swcx emission does not contribute significantly to the @xmath35-lte correlation .",
    "the discussion in  4 explores the implications of the swcx production factor .",
    "that section also discusses the implications of the heliospheric correlation analysis for observation and mission planning , as well as the question of the relative importance of the magnetosheath and heliosphere to swcx `` contamination '' .",

    "the spacecraft was spun on an axis perpendicular to the optical axis .",
    "the spin axis was set to be within @xmath37 of the sun and precessed at @xmath38 per orbit , nearly the same rate as the earth revolves about the sun .",
    "the spin period was nearly the same as the spacecraft s orbital period about the earth .",
    "thus , over the course of a single orbit , the spacecraft observed a great circle roughly perpendicular to the earth - sun line passing through the ecliptic poles per orbit while the plane of the look direction is fixed in gse coordinates , the relation between location of the spacecraft and the look direction is continuously changing .",

    "this time - varying component was removed from the rass , although some residual lte contamination remains and can be identified as stripes along lines of constant ecliptic longitude .",

    "the light - curve is discontinuous because the observations used for the rass were not entirely continuous , mostly due to passage of the satellite through the radiation belts and the south atlantic anomaly .",
    "a portion of the @xmath0 kev  lte light - curve , roughly days 270 to 300 , was used by @xcite to demonstrate that the lte were correlated with the solar wind flux ( as measured by _",

    "for this work we will use the entire light - curve , though the contributions past day 400 do not contribute significantly .",
    "the data were originally binned into @xmath40 minute intervals with a mean count rate of 0.7 count s@xmath41 .",
    "no uncertainty was assigned in the original measure of the lte rates and it is clear , given the way the values were derived , that the systematic uncertainties must be larger than the poisson statistics .",
    "we have rebinned the data into a uniform 95-minute spacing and have taken the uncertainty of each bin to be @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the rms variation of the data points contributing to an individual bin .",
    "bins containing fewer than two data points were discarded .",
    "the bin spacing was chosen so that each bin contains roughly a single orbit of data and that adjacent data points cover nearly the same part of the sky .",
    "thus , any systematic effects due to the cosmic background will vary by a small amount over a day and a half , rather than producing large variations between adjacent data points .",
    "_ cusp removal : _ for the bulk of each orbit , the line of sight passed through the flanks of the magnetosheath where the swcx emission is relatively low .",
    "however , in some seasons , the line of sight scanned near the magnetospheric cusps , where swcx should be strongly elevated , as shown in figure  [ fig : ms_demo ] .",
    "the cusps are relatively narrow throats of magnetic field lines just poleward of the last closed field line on the earth s day side where the earth s magnetic field lines are open and thus they are the regions where the solar wind plasma can have direct access to the upper atmosphere .",
    "the cusps are threaded by the field lines undergoing or having recently undergone reconnection , and the particle population is determined by kinematic effects not included in mhd theory .",
    "due to this limitation of mhd models , the density structures within the cusps are not properly characterized , and so need to be excluded from the analysis .",
    "typically , the cusp extends 3 - 4 degrees in magnetic latitude @xcite and 2 - 3 hours in longitude @xcite at a given altitude . due to the curved magnetic field lines threading the cusp ,",
    "a low altitude spacecraft can observe lines of sight through the cusp over @xmath44 in latitude , meaning that the spacecraft will scan across it in less than five minutes . in the rass processing ,",
    "short - term enhancements ( ste ) lasting just a few minutes when the line of sight passed near the earth s pole were attributed , at the time , to auroral emission but may have been due to the cusps .",
    "these ste periods were removed from processing , and thus are not included in the lte data .",
    "removal of the ste periods does not guarantee the removal of cusp periods .",
    "we have attempted to identify periods when the line of sight passes through the cusp .",
    "this is not a trivial matter as the location of the cusp varies with diurnal motion , the annual motion , the direction of the interplanetary magnetic field , and the strength of the solar wind flux .",
    "we have used the @xcite model of the earth s magnetic field to determine the magnetic field geometry along the line of sight , that is , whether the magnetic field lines through which the lines of sight pass are closed , open , or interplanetary .",
    "we first compared the lte light - curve with a representation of the magnetic field geometry along the line of sight and saw no obvious correlation .",
    "we further checked time intervals for which viewing through the cusp was most likely : when the spacecraft was on the dayside and the line of sight was within @xmath45 of the gse - z axis , or when we might expect to be under(over ) the northern(southern ) cusp and to be looking up(down ) through it . for each time interval meeting these criteria and",
    "for which there were both lte and solar wind data , we calculated the difference , @xmath46 , between the lte rate at that time and the lte rate at @xmath47 minutes .",
    "since the scan rate is @xmath48 minute@xmath41 , the cusp should fall in the center bin while the bins 10 minutes away should be free of the cusp .",

    "there is a slight positive asymmetry , with an excess of events with 0.5 to 1.0 fov@xmath41 s@xmath41 , and with a values extending to 1.3 count fov@xmath41 s@xmath41 .",
    "time intervals with particularly high @xmath46 did not show any particular distribution in spacecraft coordinates .",
    "since stes were removed from the lte data and our search for enhancements at times likely to contain cusp emission did not reveal systematic increases in emission , we can confidently state that the residual contribution by the cusp to the lte light - curve is small .    _",

    "the differences are due to the swcx spectrum .",
    "although the details of the swcx spectrum are poorly understood , the overall shape of the spectrum is set by the ion abundances in the solar wind and the location of their principal recombination lines .",

    "rather than a few strong lines , the @xmath0 kev  band contains a large number of faint lines from many different species .",

    "solar wind data for the period of the rass are somewhat sparse for two reasons . first , the only satellite monitoring the solar wind at that time was _ imp 8_. since _ imp 8 _  was launched to study not only the solar wind , but the magnetospheric boundary and the magnetotail , it was exposed to the free - flowing solar wind for only a portion of its orbit .",

    "the dependence is also due to the finite time for the magnetosphere to respond to changes in the solar wind .",
    "thus mhd models are superior to analytic models , such as that of @xcite , which have been used for previous swcx studies @xcite . in comparison to @xcite",
    "we find that bats - r - us  produces consistently different positions for the magnetopause and the bowshock ( see  4.2 ) .",
    "bats - r - us  also models the asymmetry of the magnetosheath .",

    "each sample produces proton density , speed , and temperature values for each point in a three - dimensional grid whose spacing is optimized to provide high resolution of strong gradients .",
    "one disadvantage of the bats - r - us  code is that it does not distinguish between protons originating in the solar wind , and those much lower energy protons originating in the plasmasphere closer to the earth .",
    "however , the amount of solar wind plasma within the magnetosphere is relatively low @xcite .",
    "thus , one can isolate the solar wind protons by removing regions that lie within the earth s closed field lines .",

    "it is expected that this relation should be non - linear ; as the solar wind flux increases , the bowshock is pushed closer to the earth , where the neutral density is higher .",
    "we must determine what part of this relation is comparable to the relation between @xmath35 and the @xmath0 kev  lte rate . by combining the two relations",
    ", we then get a direct relation between @xmath75 and the @xmath0 kev  lte rate , and thus the _ rosat _  @xmath0 kev  band flux .",
    "in order to understand the magnetosheath swcx flux that _ rosat _  ought to have observed during the all - sky survey , we sampled a number of magnetospheric simulations with lines of sight typical of the rass .",
    "it is important to bear in mind that the lte data with which we are to compare the results of simulations are binned to intervals of roughly one orbit .",
    "thus we wish to extract from the simulations the equivalent to what _ rosat _  would have observed over a single great circle scan .",
    "we begin with a `` reference '' scan , a great circle , centered on the earth , passing through the ecliptic poles , and rotated @xmath77 about the gse - z axis from the gse - yz plane . for each time step of each simulation we calculated integrated emissivity , @xmath31 , for 360 lines of sight",
    "uniformly distributed over this great circle . from those we then calculated the mean integrated emissivity @xmath78 for the scan .",
    "since this reference scan passes through the ecliptic poles ( the gse - z axis ) it avoids the cusps except for times around the solstices .",
    "once we understand the behavior of @xmath78 for the reference scan , we will explore the effects on @xmath78 of using more realistic scans .    as noted in  2.3",
    ", the bats - r - us  simulations do not distinguish between solar wind protons and the cold plasmaspheric protons , while the swcx emission can be associated with only solar wind protons .",
    "we thus need to remove the plasmasphere from the simulation before calculating @xmath31 .",
    "since these scans avoid the cusps , the proton density for any direction on a scan is peaked at the earth , declines with increasing radius to some relative minimum , and then shows another peak at the magnetosheath .",
    "the plasmasphere can be crudely but rather efficiently defined as the region inside the relative minimum in proton density , though the plasmasphere by no means fills that region .",
    "figure  [ fig : yz_demo ] shows the proton density for a gse yz slice through one step of a simulation , as well as the boundary of the `` plasmaspheric '' region to be removed .",
    "this cleaning algorithm works well when the cusp does not enter the scan .    in the top two panels of figure  [ fig : q_nv ] , each plot point represents the @xmath78 for an individual time step of a simulation listed in table  [ tab : runs ] .",
    "the points have been color - coded by season and , where possible , symbol - coded by simulation .",
    "the top panel shows the bulk of the parameter space covered by the simulations , while the middle panel covers only the values of @xmath35 found in the lte data periods .",
    "the bottom panel shows the values binned into @xmath79 cm@xmath2 s@xmath41 wide bins .",
    "the colored symbols are points from individual simulations while the black points are summed over all the simulations .",
    "the standard deviations are shown for bins containing more that five values .",
    "as one might expect , as the solar wind flux increases , the value of @xmath31 increases non - linearly .",
    "the relation between @xmath81 and @xmath35 becomes steeper as @xmath35 increases .",
    "below @xmath82 cm@xmath2 s@xmath41 the relation is relatively linear , or at least any non - linearity is obscured by the intrinsic variation .",
    "the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : q_nv ] shows a linear fit to the values with @xmath83 cm@xmath2 s@xmath41 and that fit seems adequate .",
    "the values do not deviate significantly from the linear fit until @xmath84 cm@xmath2 s@xmath41 .",
    "there is a significant dispersion in @xmath78 at any given value of @xmath35 for a single simulation , and clear systematic differences between simulations . at @xmath85 cm@xmath2 s@xmath41",
    "there are fewer simulation points and the behavior of the relation becomes quite uncertain .",
    "the first source of variation in @xmath78 at a given @xmath35 is the inherent difficulty of defining the solar wind pressure acting upon the magnetosheath .",
    "the solar wind takes roughly three minutes to move from the nose of the bowshock to a plane passing through the center of the earth .",
    "each portion of the magnetosphere responds to the ambient pressure at its location , and the response propagates rapidly throughout the magnetosheath .",
    "thus , setting a single characteristic @xmath35 for a time step is inherently inaccurate .",
    "there is , as well , the difficulty of propagating strongly variable solar wind conditions from their point of measurement to the ( moving ) magnetopause or bowshock . thus , there is an intrinsic error in setting @xmath35 , particularly when the solar wind conditions are changing rapidly . since high @xmath35 periods tend to be periods with strong , rapid variation in @xmath35 , the variation in @xmath78 increases with @xmath35 .",
    "the simulations with slower changes in the solar wind show significantly less scatter .",
    "a second source of variation is the asymmetry of the magnetosheath , which depends not so much on the @xmath35 of the solar wind , but upon the variation in the direction of the solar wind momentum vector and the direction of the interplanetary magnetic field .",
    "the asymmetry can be seen in figure  [ fig : yz_demo ] . nor is the neutral density spherically symmetric ; rather it is squashed at the poles , which leads to a rather asymmetric distribution of emission .",
    "since the scan path is rotated by 12  around the gse - z axis with respect to the yz plane , it samples the magnetosheath at much closer distances on one side than it does on the other , which leads to even more extreme asymmetries .",
    "the asymmetry in the emission for a typical scan , after removal of the plasmasphere , is shown in the right - hand panel of figure  [ fig : yz_demo ] .",
    "the average of the integrated magnetospheric emissivity over a great circle scan , @xmath78 , depends on the direction and amplitude of the rotation of the scan plane with respect to the underlying asymmetry .",
    "thus , for any given value of @xmath35 , one would expect a variation in @xmath78 due to the variation in the asymmetry . using a representative set of simulations , reversing the sense of the rotation of the scan path with respect to the gse - yz plane changed the @xmath78 for individual time steps from -20% to + 10% , with a mean change of -7% .",
    "this variation might be reduced if the @xcite model overestimates the equatorial bulge of the exosphere .",
    "a third source of variation is seasonal variation . as the earth nods , the cusp latitude changes , bringing the cusps closer or further from the scan path .",
    "however , as indicated in figure  [ fig : q_nv ] , this variation seems to be small compared to the intrinsic differences between simulations .",
    "the combined effect of all of these variations produce that scatter seen in figure  [ fig : q_nv ] .",
    "we have calculated the fractional variance as a function of @xmath35 .",
    "using values for all of the simulations , we calculated the mean @xmath81 for @xmath79 cm@xmath2 s@xmath41 wide bins ( the black boxes in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : q_nv ] ) .",
    "the standard deviation of the values in each bin is shown as the black histogram . for @xmath86 cm@xmath2 , the standard deviation in @xmath81 , @xmath87 ,",
    "is roughly 40% of the mean @xmath88 and is relatively independent of @xmath35 .    by fitting the data in the last panel of figure  [ fig : q_nv ]",
    "we find that @xmath89 = ( 0.037 \\pm 0.189 ) + ( 20.68 \\pm 0.41 ) \\left[\\frac{\\overline{q_m}}{10^{20}}\\right]\\ ] ] where @xmath35 is in cm@xmath2 s@xmath41 and @xmath78 is in @xmath90 s@xmath41 .",
    "the correlation is fitted from the values binned over all simulations ( the black boxes in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : q_nv ] ) since the individual values derived from each time - step of each simulation have no intrinsic uncertainties .",
    "the measured standard deviation of each point was used as the uncertainties in the fit .",
    "we fit only the values below @xmath83 cm@xmath2 s@xmath41 where the relation is most clearly linear .",
    "we have used a fitting method @xcite that minimizes the uncertainty perpendicular to the fit , and determines the uncertainties in the fit parameters using a bootstrap technique . note that the uncertainty in the intercept is significantly larger than the intercept itself , thus the intercept",
    "is not significantly different from zero .",
    "any intrinsic scatter in the @xmath35-@xmath78 relation translates directly into a scatter in the @xmath35-lte relation . besides the scatter explored above",
    ", there is also scatter due to the difference between the geometry of the reference scan and real _ rosat _  scans . over the course of an orbit",
    ", the spacecraft will move from @xmath91 r@xmath7 on the day side of the earth to @xmath91 r@xmath7 on the night side of the earth ; the scan path moves correspondingly with respect to the reference scan . as the emission increases towards the sub - solar point of the magnetosheath , the more sunward the scan , the higher the emission . a real _ rosat _",
    "scan will sample the magnetosheath on both sides of the reference scan , but since the emission is not linear with distance from the sub - solar point , the effects do not cancel .",
    "to measure the difference between realistic scans and the reference scan , we constructed four test scans for a single ( rather unrealistic ) test orbit lying in the gse - xy plane .",
    "each test scan was constructed such that the line of sight is towards the north ecliptic pole when the spacecraft is at one of the cardinal directions , dawn , dusk , noon , or midnight .",

    "we have compared the @xmath78 for these test scans to the @xmath78 for the reference scan .",

    "the uncertainties shown are the rms variations of the data being binned . as can be seen from the histogram of the solar wind data for the periods for which there is lte data ( figure  [ fig : c_nv ] ) the bulk of the data is for @xmath92 cm@xmath2 s@xmath41 . above that value of the local solar wind flux",
    "the data become increasingly sparse , tailing off by @xmath93 cm@xmath2 s@xmath41 .",
    "the bulk of the lte observations were made when @xmath35 was well within the range for which the @xmath35-@xmath78 relation is linear , and only the most extreme values fall in the regime where the linearity is dubious .",
    "we have fitted the correlation for @xmath83 cm@xmath2 s@xmath41using the bootstrap method of @xcite .",

    "the scatter in the @xmath35-lte relation is not unexpected .",
    "the measured scatter in the @xmath35-@xmath78 relation is roughly 40% .",
    "the difference between the reference scan path and a `` real '' scan path is roughly 10% . assuming that these variations are independent , that suggests a roughly 50% variation .",
    "the blue lines in figure  [ fig : c_nv ] show this variation .",
    "it encompasses the bulk of the data points , suggesting that there is no significant extra source of variation in the @xmath35-lte relation .",
    "we further note the lack of a significant intercept in the @xmath35-lte relation .",
    "this result is actually rather unexpected .",
    "the measurement of the lte rate was done without reference to the solar wind flux as that relation was unknown at the time .",
    "one might expect the lte rate to be systematically underestimated or over - estimated and indeed , there are a number of bright streaks in the lte - subtracted rass that suggest that the lte was underestimated in this process .",
    "the lack of an intercept in the @xmath35-lte relation suggests that the estimation of the lte , while imperfect for some scans , was not systematically low or high .",
    "therefore , we find that @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the _ rosat _  @xmath0 kev  band ( or r12 band ) count rate in count s@xmath41 fov@xmath41 and @xmath32 has its usual units of @xmath90 s@xmath41 .",

    "therefore we find that @xmath97     kev  lte flux as a function of the local solar wind flux .",
    "the _ dashed _ line is the best fit .",
    "this fit was used for scaling the solar wind flux to the lte data in figure  [ fig : m_lc ] .",
    "[ fig : m_nv],width=302 ]    the situation for the @xmath4 kev  band is rather different .",
    "figure  [ fig : m_nv ] shows the correlation of the @xmath4 kev  lte flux and the local solar wind flux .",
    "although there are more low lte flux data points at low local solar wind values , there is little correlation between the two values , and the pearson correlation coefficient is only 0.45 . in comparison ,",
    "the pearson correlation coefficient between the @xmath0 kev  lte flux and the solar wind flux is 0.74 .",
    "the pearson correlation coefficient between the @xmath4 kev  and @xmath0 kev  band ltes is only 0.14 , so the @xmath4 kev  band lte emission is better correlated with the local solar wind flux than it is with the lte emission in the @xmath0 kev  band .",
    "the overall lte flux in the @xmath4 kev  band is a factor of seven to eight lower than in the @xmath0 kev  band , so the uncertainties must consequently be larger .",
    "however , we note that the rms / mean for the @xmath4 kev  band is similar to that of the @xmath0 kev  band ( 33.06 _ versus _ 34.67 ) so the decrease in the correlation coefficient is not due to an increase in an intrinsic scatter in the @xmath4 kev  band .",
    "the lack of correlation in the @xmath4 kev  band , compared to the @xmath0 kev  band , suggests that the oxygen lines that dominate the @xmath4 kev  are less well correlated with the solar wind flux than the aggregate of the many lines that produce the @xmath0 kev  band .",
    "this is not unreasonable since the oxygen lines will be sensitive to the variation in the oxygen abundance and ionization fraction in the solar wind , while the aggregate of lines in the @xmath0 kev  lines should be less sensitive .",
    "combining the @xmath99-lte and @xmath99-@xmath81 relation to get the production factor is only valid if the only contribution to the correlation between lte emission and the local solar wind is the magnetosheath emission .",
    "so long as it is not correlated with the local solar wind flux , the heliospheric swcx will introduce only noise to the relation .",
    "thus , we must investigate the possible correlation of the heliospheric swcx with the local solar wind flux .",
    "the heliospheric emission along the line of sight is @xmath100 , where @xmath101 is the interplanetary h density , @xmath102 is the interplanetary he density , and @xmath103 is the ratio of the he charge - exchange cross - section to the h charge - exchange cross - section .",
    "since he cross - sections are usually only a factor of a few smaller than those for h ( see the compilation in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we have set @xmath104 .",
    "the solar wind proton density was extracted from the enlil models while the density of the interplanetary neutrals was taken from the model of @xcite .",
    "since the enlil model was calculated only to 10 au from the sun within @xmath105 of the solar equator , we can calculate a line of sight from earth to 9 au for only a limited number of directions .",
    "the distance of 9 au is sufficient for determining the correlation between the heliospheric swcx and the local solar wind flux : if we assume a heliopause distance of 100 au , then 70% of the total observed heliospheric emission occurs within the first 9 au .",
    "there is some variation between the upwind and downwind directions , but we have calculated this as an average over angle from the upwind direction .    for the region for which we can measure the heliospheric properties over lines of sight 9 au long ,",
    "we have calculated @xmath106 at @xmath107 spacing in both ecliptic latitude and ecliptic longitude for each enlil time step . for each line of sight",
    "we calculated the pearson correlation coefficient between the @xmath106 and the local @xmath35 , as recorded in the model at the location of the earth .",
    "figure  [ fig : corr_map ] shows the correlation coefficient as a function of ecliptic latitude and angle from the sun along the ecliptic .",
    "the pattern shown in this map is reasonably independent of the details of the recent solar wind history and the time of year .",
    "the strongest correlations are found between @xmath108 and @xmath109 from the sun , measuring in a positive sense around the ecliptic , or 50to 80from the anti - sun as seen in figure  [ fig : corr_map ] .",
    "this is the region where one is looking along the parker spiral beyond the earth s orbit .",
    "similarly , angles further than @xmath110 from the anti - sun have high correlations because one is looking down the parker spiral within the earth s orbit .",
    "the curvature of the spiral is stronger within the earth s orbit than without , so there is a shorter distance at which the line of sight is tangent to the spiral .",
    "only a small part of the parker spiral region is accessible to either _ rosat _  or _ xmm - newton _",
    ", so one should not expect a strong correlation between the local solar wind and the heliospheric swcx .",
    "this statement excludes , of course , strong cmes .",
    "the restriction to within 30of the solar equator is not of great concern for the correlation analysis .",
    "as can be seen from the diagrams in @xcite , during solar minimum , the solar wind between the equator and @xmath111 is characterized by a dense , slow `` equatorial '' flow , while at higher latitudes , the there is a faster , more tenuous `` polar '' flow . as can be seen in figure  [ fig : plane_demo_side ] there are coherent structures extending out of the plane . however , unlike the parker spiral , these structures have a wide range of tilts , so the direction in which one looks along the structure is not fixed .",
    "further , for a line of sight towards the poles , the equatorial flow accounts for only @xmath112% of the heliospheric swcx flux , assuming an emissivity that declines as @xmath113 as measured from the sun .",
    "thus , in general , the correlation between the local solar wind and the swcx observed towards the ecliptic poles should be weak , though swcx emission will be correlated with the local solar wind for some limited directions at some times . during the solar maximum , which is more relevant for the rass observations , the differentiation between equatorial and polar flows is missing , and the solar wind speeds and densities are strongly variable in both regions . in this case",
    "we again do not expect correlation between the locally measured solar wind and the solar wind at the higher solar latitudes not covered by the enlil model .",
    "in  3.1 and  3.2 we fitted the @xmath35-lte relation and the @xmath35-@xmath78 relation , and used the slopes of those relations to determine the _ rosat _",
    "@xmath0 kev  count rate as a function of @xmath31 , and thus the @xmath0 kev  production factor .",
    "further , we have shown that the scatter in the @xmath35-lte relation is comparable to that in the @xmath35-@xmath78 relation .",
    "@xcite calculated _ rosat _  production factors for a `` slow '' solar wind from the available atomic data .",
    "the slow solar wind conditions ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for definition ) are appropriate for the equatorial flow at solar minimum .",
    "although the solar wind experienced by the earth at solar maximum is a complex mixture of slow and fast solar wind , the distribution of velocities during the time of the rass is consistent with the slow wind , and it is common practice to approximate the equatorial solar wind , even at solar maximum , with the slow solar wind ion / abundance ratios .",
    "the calculated @xmath0 kev  production factor from @xcite for charge - exchange with h is @xmath114 count arcmin@xmath2 @xmath3 , ( @xmath115 count degree@xmath2 @xmath3 ) which is a factor of 4.5 lower than that derived here .",
    "this disagreement is not altogether surprising given the uncertainty in the atomic data .",
    "a comparison , for example , of the soft x - ray swcx spectrum shown in @xcite with that of @xcite shows strong differences despite a reliance on similar atomic data . a conversion of the @xcite spectrum into a production factor yields @xmath116 count degree@xmath2 @xmath3 , which is a factor of only 1.79 lower than that empirically obtained from the lte data .",
    "addition of further lines to the theoretical spectrum will decrease this difference .",
    "we do not find any combination of systematic uncertainties that could push the measured production factor , @xmath26 , significantly lower .",
    "had there been a heliospheric contribution to the @xmath35-lte relation , then the derived @xmath26 would have been an upper limit . however , as shown in  3.3 , the heliospheric emission does not contribute to the @xmath35-lte correlation .",
    "conversely , if the plasmaspheric contribution in the bats - r - us  simulations were not completely removed , then the derived @xmath26 would be a lower limit .",
    "as can be seen in figure  [ fig : yz_demo ] , the region removed for the plasmasphere , while adequate for that purpose , does not extend all the way to the magnetopause . an alternate cleaning which removes both the plasmasphere and",
    "the bulk of the low density region interior to the heliopause does not significantly change the calculated @xmath78 , though some individual lines of sight changed significantly .",
    "thus , the plasmasphere removal method does not significantly change the derived production factor .",
    "similarly , if the @xcite model overestimates the exospheric density , as suggested by @xcite , then the derived @xmath26 would again be a lower limit .",
    "the derived production factor is also a lower limit as we have not accounted for the loss of ions due to charge - exchange as they travel through the exosphere .",
    "this is , however , a negligible effect . assuming a path through the magnetosheath in the gse - xy plane from the sub - solar point around the earth to roughly @xmath117 from the sub - solar point ( a path - length of @xmath118 r@xmath7 ) and the o@xmath11 charge - exchange cross - section for a slow solar wind from @xcite ( @xmath119 @xmath120 )",
    ", we find that less than a tenth of a percent of the ions recombine , and we have not even corrected this value for the number of o@xmath121 ions that will have charge - exchanged to form o@xmath11 ions .",
    "thus , correction of the ion density for the effects of charge - exchange is inconsequential .",
    "efforts to understand the swcx in the _ chandra__xmm - newton _  era have been primarily driven by the problem of removing the swcx emission from observations of diffuse emission . @xcite",
    "used multiple _ xmm - newton _  observations with the same pointing but different epochs and observing geometries to show that swcx emission is not solely a function of the local solar wind flux ; some observations with low local solar wind flux showed swcx emission while the majority of the observations at those solar wind fluxes did not . further , the observations that showed swcx emission when the local solar wind flux was low often had lines of sight that avoided the high emissivity regions of the magnetosheath .",
    "however , they found no high local solar wind flux observations ( @xmath122 ) without swcx emission .",
    "finally , there were a number of observations that should have had lines of sight passing through the highest emissivity regions of the magnetosheath which showed no elevated swcx emission , while other such observations did .",
    "thus @xcite concluded that high local solar wind flux was necessary but not sufficient to predict swcx emission .",
    "although that swcx emission observed when the local solar wind was low was probably due to local heliospheric emission , they could not exclude magnetospheric production .",
    "@xcite and @xcite combed the _ xmm - newton _  archive for observations affected by swcx .",
    "they searched for observations where the 0.5 - 0.7 kev band containing the oxygen lines showed variation not seen in a 2.5 - 5.0 kev `` continuum '' band .",
    "their results were similar to those of @xcite , finding that observations containing swcx emission tended to occur when _",
    "xmm - newton",
    "_  was between the earth and the sun , but were not limited to such lines of sight .",
    "for each observation they also compared the expected magnetosheath flux , as calculated from a static model of the magnetosheath and the _ ace _  solar wind data .",
    "they found very poor correlation between the two values , suggesting both magnetosheath and heliospheric contributions .",
    "both @xcite and @xcite used the @xcite model for the size of the magnetosheath given the solar wind density , speed , and temperature .",
    "we have compared the magnetopause distance and the bowshock distance of the @xcite model with that found in the bats - r - us  simulations .",
    "the bowshock distance in the bats - r - us  simulations was set to be the radius along the gse - x axis at which the pressure drops to less than a tenth of the maximum pressure .",
    "the magnetopause distance was set to be the maximum radius along the gse - x axis at which the magnetic field lines are closed .",
    "figure  [ fig : spreiter ] compares the @xcite and bats - r - us  values ; the @xcite consistently underestimates the magnetopause and bowshock distances compared to those found by bats - r - us  . in the case of the bowshock ,",
    "the underestimate is often 2 - 3 r@xmath7 , while the magnetopause is usually off by @xmath123 r@xmath7 .",
    "thus , it is likely that both @xcite and @xcite found a poor correlation between lines of sight passing through the nose of the magnetosheath and swcx contamination because the lines of sight were actually passing several r@xmath7 behind the region of substantial emission .",
    "@xcite extracted `` blank sky '' spectra from all possible _ xmm - newton _  observations in order to study the galactic halo . to study the swcx emission they considered the oxygen line fluxes for cases of multiple observations of the same target .",
    "they looked , in particular , at the difference between the flux of any particular observation and the minimum flux for that direction .",
    "this quantity showed little correlation with the @xmath32 from the magnetosheath , in part because their model of the magnetosheath @xcite had a stand - off distance fixed to 10 r@xmath7 without regard to the solar wind flux ; their analysis suffered from a more extreme form of the problem suffered by @xcite .",
    "thus we conclude that many studies seeking swcx emission from the sub - solar point of the magnetosheath have been looking in the wrong location .",
    "whether the enhanced swcx emission is observed when looking at the correct location has not yet been determined ; a study of swcx emission in the _ xmm - newton _  archive using mhd models is currently ongoing at the university of leicester .",
    "@xcite also found  no universal association between enhanced swcx emission and increased solar wind flux \" , a finding consistent with previous studies .",
    "given the lack of correlation between the local solar wind flux and @xmath106 shown in  3.3 , this is not surprising .",
    "( note that _ xmm - newton _  observes only a slightly larger region of the sky than was accessible to _ rosat _  . )",
    "however , since we have shown that the magnetosheath emission produces a strong correlation between the @xmath0 kev  lte flux and the local solar wind , but does _ not _ produce as strong a correlation between the @xmath4 kev  lte flux ( dominated by the emission from the and lines ) and the local solar wind flux , then the @xmath4 kev  lte flux must be governed by some additional parameter , most likely the oxygen ion abundances in the solar wind .",
    "if the ion abundance variation is enough to remove the bulk of the correlation seen from the magnetosheath , then one would expect even less correlation with local heliospheric emission .",
    "unfortunately , the o@xmath121 abundance is poorly measured by _ ace _  , and the o@xmath11 is not much better measured , so it will be difficult to study this issue .    in summary ,",
    "the question of the relative contributions of the magnetosheath and the heliosphere , in general , to swcx emission events is ill - posed , and studies in the oxygen lines are problematic",
    ". there should be a strong correlation between the local solar wind flux and magnetosheath swcx emission , even if previous attempts to verify that correlation failed due to incorrect expectations for the location of the magnetosheath , and the use of the intrinsically more poorly correlated oxygen lines .",
    "such correlation is not expected , in general , for heliospheric swcx emission .      since the discovery of the hubble deep field swcx emission event by @xcite ,",
    "significant effort has been placed on swcx emission identification in @xmath4 kev  band observations , either to remove swcx `` contamination '' for astrophysical reasons , or to identify observations `` blessed '' with swcx emission for heliospheric reasons .",
    "@xcite thought it a lost cause to determine whether any arbitrary observation were effected by swcx without repeated observations of the same field , while @xcite showed if an observation was sufficiently long , then swcx affected intervals could be identified through differential light - curve analysis . @xcite applied a local solar wind flux limit to remove swcx emission affected observations .",
    "however , given the correlation analysis for the part of the sky observed by _ xmm - newton _  , and excepting cme issues , this limit is as likely to exclude data without significant heliospheric swcx emission enhancements as it is to include data with significant heliospheric swcx emission enhancements .",
    "a second method to deal with swcx emission is _ ex post facto _ modeling of the swcx emission .",
    "efforts to characterize the emission from the lhb have concentrated on repeated observations of nearby x - ray dark clouds to model and remove the swcx emission ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite has shown , in particular , that modeling the swcx emission for a line of sight falling entirely within the equatorial flow yields reasonably reliable results , while modeling the swcx emission for a line of sight dominated by the ( poorly characterized ) polar flow yields rather disappointing results .",
    "we note , however , that these results were obtained at solar maximum when the distinction between polar and equatorial flows becomes problematic . at solar minimum ,",
    "those flows are much more cleanly distinguished and the polar flow should be much more stable and amenable to modeling .    a third method to deal with swcx emission is to plan observations in order to minimize ( or maximize ! ) its impact .",
    "reference to figure  [ fig : corr_map ] suggests that to model the swcx emission for an object within @xmath111 of the ecliptic plane , one would want repeated observations of the object when it lies in the direction of the parker spiral in order to optimize the correlation between the local solar wind flux and the swcx emission that is actually observed ; observations in other directions will have significantly poorer correlations and thus poorer swcx emission removal .",
    "conversely , one might wish to observe in such a way as to minimize the variation in the heliospheric flux .",
    "this would be particularly useful for shadowing observations where the shadow and the background it is absorbing have to be observed separately . figure  [ fig : vari_map ] shows a map of the root mean square of the variation in @xmath124 normalized by the mean of @xmath124 .",
    "although @xmath125 appears to vary more from simulation to simulation than does the correlation , some features are consistent . the highest variation is perpendicular to the earth - sun line in the same quadrant as the parker spiral beyond the earth .",
    "the opposite direction does not have an elevated variation .",
    "thus it should be noted that high variability region is part of the sky accessible to _ xmm - newton _  and _ chandra _  , so swcx variation can be reduced by specifying the part of the year in which the observations are to be made .",
    "one of the prime motivations of this work is to pursue a suggestion first made in @xcite , that swcx emission from the magnetosheath could be used for remote sensing of the magnetosheath .",
    "this suggestion has spawned a number of mission proposals to observe the magnetosheath , including _",
    "storm _ @xcite and _ axiom _ @xcite , as well as smaller proposals to observe the cusps @xcite .",
    "this is a particularly well posed problem as the swcx production factor for hydrogen can be derived directly from measurements of the object that we desire to study , albeit in the flanks of the magnetosheath rather than in the much brighter region of interest .    as shown in figure  [ fig : ms_demo ]",
    ", the magnetosheath `` breathes '' in and out as the solar wind flux varies .",
    "figure  [ fig : storm ] demonstrates what would be seen with an x - ray imager 30 r@xmath7 from the earth , along the gse - y axis , looking back at the nose of the magnetosheath .",
    "the magnetopause and bowshock are clearly defined , as is emission beyond the bowshock due to the exosphere interacting with the free - flowing solar wind .",
    "there is a large literature exploring a wide variety of mhd phenomena that should occur within the magnetosheath , such as kelvin - helmholtz instabilities and flux - transfer events which may be observable in the x - ray @xcite . whether these structures can be observed depends critically on the count - rate and cadence of such an imager .",
    "kev  background level .",
    "[ fig : peak],width=340 ]    as a first - order demonstration of the potential utility of such an instrument , we can determine the flux from the magnetosheath and compare it to that of the soft x - ray background .",
    "we have calculated the magnetosheath emission as seen from a gse coordinate ( 10,-30,0 ) r@xmath7 , which produces images such as that seen in figure  [ fig : storm ] . for a characteristic value we calculated the emission along a line of sight through the peak emission on the projected gse - x axis . on the gse - x axis",
    "the emission at the bowshock is roughly 20% of that of the gse - x peak flux .",
    "we note that the magnetosheath closer to the dominant cusp tends to be even brighter than the `` subsolar '' flux .",
    "we have calculated the characteristic value for a number of simulations and have plotted the result in figure  [ fig : peak ] .",
    "these simulation values can be compared the background .",
    "kev  surface brightness from the rass .",
    "the conversion from _ rosat _  counts to fluxes was made using the spectrum of the soft x - ray background towards the galactic pole .",
    "[ fig : rass],width=321 ]    as figure  [ fig : rass ] shows , the mean @xmath0 kev  band ( r12 band ) flux over the entire sky is @xmath126 count s@xmath41 arcmin@xmath2 ( 2.22 count s@xmath41 degree@xmath2 ) while the mode is @xmath127 count s@xmath41 arcmin@xmath2 ( 1.35 count s@xmath41 degree@xmath2 ) .",
    "these background values are significantly below the `` subsolar '' flux for all but the very calmest solar winds .",
    "thus , imaging the magnetosheath is eminently feasible , given an instrument with a large field of view and modest collecting area .",
    "in this work we have calculated the x - ray production factor for solar wind charge - exchange with h. the value is somewhat higher than theoretically calculated values , perhaps because the calculated values did not include all of the faint lines contributing to the emission in the @xmath0 kev  band .",
    "this value is rather robust , being based on the ratio of observed flux to the @xmath32 derived from bats - r - us  simulations ; it is _ particularly _ robust for use with other bats - r - us  simulations being sampled for different observation geometries . as a result",
    ", we have shown that remote sensing of the magnetosheath from high earth orbit , looking back at the magnetosheath , is particularly promising .    on the way to deriving the production factor ,",
    "we may have resolved a few issues concerning swcx emission .",
    "we have shown how previous models of the magnetosheath swcx emission are unlikely to agree with _ xmm - newton _  observations , simply due to the magnetosheath not being in the expected location .",
    "we have also shown why analyses correlating swcx emission in the and lines with the local solar wind flux have found little correlation ; the correlation between the local solar wind and any heliospheric swcx emission will _ only _ occur in limited portions of the sky _ and _ the oxygen line emission is poorly correlated with the solar wind proton flux due to their sensitivity to abundance and ionization fraction effects .",
    "we have also proposed a number of methods to reduce the impact of swcx emission on various types of observations .    finally , it must be reiterated that study of swcx emission in the @xmath4 kev  band provides little information about the swcx emission in the @xmath0 kev  band ; the two bands are very poorly correlated because they are produced in very different ways .",
    "the @xmath4 kev  band is due to a small number of lines generated by parent ions with strongly variable abundances .",
    "the @xmath0 kev  band is produced by ( currently ) innumerable lines from many species .",
    "many of those lines are from l - shell charge exchange for which there is no operational theory @xcite . until wide - field high spectral resolution imaging becomes common , careful band - averaged studies such as this one will be a far more powerful tool than line studies in the @xmath4 kev  band for understanding the bulk of the swcx emission .    the initial studies that led to this work funded kdk and mrc through national aeronautics and space administration adap grant 06-adp06 - 32 .",
    "mrc was partially funded by nasa under grant lsso06 - 0032 issued through the science mission directorate s planetary science division .",
