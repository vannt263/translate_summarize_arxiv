    "since its discovery @xcite conductance quantization in ballistic quantum point contacts ( qpcs ) has become one of the hallmarks of mesoscopic physics .",
    "this quantization has a single - particle origin and is due to lateral confinement and cancellation of group velocity and density of states in one dimension .",
    "in addition to the conductance plateaus at integer multiples of @xmath0 , qpcs often exhibit features which require an explanation beyond the single - particle picture provided by the landauer theory , the most prominent one being the 0.7-anomaly .  @xcite the latter is usually referred to as an extra anomalous plateau at the conductance value of about 0.7@xmath1 . despite its name ,",
    "it is not the precise conductance value of this plateau but rather a set of qualitative features that is usually associated with the anomaly .",
    "@xcite the feature evolves smoothly into the spin - resolved @xmath2 plateau at high in - plane magnetic fields @xcite revealing its spin - related nature .",
    "moreover , while the conductance quantization gets weaker by increasing the temperature due to thermal smearing , the anomalous plateau typically gets stronger and drops in conductance .",
    "@xcite furthermore , close to pinch - off qpcs usually exhibit non - linearities and especially a peak around zero bias in their @xmath3 known as the zero bias anomaly ( zba ) .",
    "@xcite the empirical correlation between the 0.7-anomaly and the zba has suggested a connection between the two @xcite although this correlation and conclusions thereof have been debated .",
    "@xcite    possible explanations to date have been based on many - body phenomena including spontaneous spin polarization ,  @xcite separation of singlet and triplet channels @xcite or spin and charge channels ,  @xcite electron - electron interaction @xcite and coulomb repulsion arising from a quasi - localized state forming in the qpc .",
    "@xcite the latter includes kondo screening of an unpaired spin and a restoration of the conductance to @xmath0 at low temperature due to the kondo effect , consistent with the observation of the zba .    in spite of extensive studies ,",
    "a complete understanding of the conductance anomalies in qpcs is still missing .",
    "one technical reason is that some of the features associated with the 0.7-anomaly can also arise from extrinsic sources , like impurities or potential imperfections , and may overshadow the features due to the generic 0.7-anomaly .",
    "@xcite these imperfections can even arise during the fabrication process and are thus not totally excluded by using a high mobility heterostructure .",
    "thus the experimental separation of such impurity related contributions from the generic features is rather crucial .",
    "such a differentiation is actually not trivial and may require exploring the whole experimental parameter space . here",
    "we demonstrate the co - existence of the 0.7-anomaly and a signal with an extrinsic origin , show how to separate the two , and discuss what that extrinsic origin may be .",
    "we study transport properties of a qpc implemented in p - type gaas and demonstrate that it exhibits conductance anomalies which are very similar to a classic 0.7-feature . after a thorough analysis of the data and a comparison with a number of simple models",
    "we conclude that one of the anomalies observed here is _",
    "different _ than the conventional 0.7-anomaly and is caused by potential fluctuations .",
    "the presented data correspond to the rare situation where such a detailed understanding and thereby the separation of the anomalies arising from different origins is possible .",
    "furthermore , the results presented here suggest both coexistence and the interplay between an impurity resonance and the 0.7-anomaly .    the more pronounced carrier - carrier interactions in p - type qpcs compared to their n - type counterparts make them especially suitable for investigating many - body effects such as the 0.7-anomaly .",
    "@xcite the valence band holes are spin-3/2 carriers yielding interesting consequences , e.g. the recent observation of non - conventional kondo physics in these systems .",
    "@xcite moreover , the holes strong spin - orbit interaction leads to the peculiar property that their @xmath4-factor is influenced by the lateral confinement .",
    "@xcite this confinement anisotropy opens a possibility to test a conjectured connection between the conductance anomalies and the spin subbands .",
    "@xcite     recently we have shown by studying a number of p - type qpcs  @xcite that the 0.7-anomaly in these samples is transformed to a narrow conductance peak accompanied by a diamond - like suppression of the differential conductance under the application of a magnetic field perpendicular to the transport plane .",
    "while this effect has been reproduced in many different qpcs and is believed to be a generic effect , the features reported in this article are special to this particular sample ( but robust against thermal cycling ) .",

    "the features present in an in - plane field of @xmath41  12  t are already developed at the perpendicular field of @xmath42  2.5  t. from this we estimate a ratio of @xmath43  5 for the two corresponding @xmath4-factors . since the @xmath4-factor of 1d subbands is expected to be zero for in - plane magnetic fields perpendicular to the qpc axis , we speculate that our non - zero value is the consequence of a possible misalignment between the field and the qpc axis and/or the crystallographic directions .      it has been suggested  @xcite that the zba can be caused by the presence of a peak in the local density of states of the qpc due to the kondo effect , very similar to what happens with an unpaired spin in the strong coupling regime of a quantum dot .",
    "however , a zero bias peak can also have non - kondo origins @xcite and , to this date , there is no consensus about the source of the zba . to shed more light on possible origins of the zba observed here , we study the effect of @xmath34 on the zba in this section .",

    "several @xmath32 curves corresponding to different gate voltages get closer in conductance . at a positive asymmetry of @xmath34  = + 113  mv the zba",
    "is split into two peaks and a bunch of @xmath32 curves are accumulated to form a plateau - like structure that follows the shape of the zero bias peak near @xmath45 .",
    "this plateau is the finite - bias signature of the anomaly we observed in the linear conductance before .",
    "note that the zba is more symmetric above this plateau .",
    "the zero - field asymmetry of the zba at @xmath34  = -186  mv can be understood within a kondo picture in terms of a coupling asymmetry of the impurity to the leads .",
    "@xcite    , scaledwidth=45.0% ]    in order to see whether the zba observed here is related to the kondo effect , we investigate the effect of an in - plane magnetic field on the splitting of the peak as shown in fig.[fig : fig4](d)-(f ) . here",
    "a negative @xmath34 is chosen for which the zba is symmetric .",
    "the single peak at zero field splits at @xmath46=  2  t and the splitting grows further at @xmath46=  4  t. the peaks are marked by small brown arrows .",
    "these splittings can be compared to the @xmath4-factor . in a kondo system",
    "such a splitting is expected to be twice the zeeman energy @xcite and therefore the results would be consistent with a kondo picture if @xmath47 .",
    "this value is reasonable in a qpc where the current is not perfectly perpendicular to the in - plane magnetic field and is consistent with the values reported in the literature .",
    "@xcite      in this section we compare the experimentally observed signatures of the anomaly discussed so far with two simplified models for the impurity .",
    "the first is a single - particle model employed in the framework of the landauer theory , where transport properties can be calculated from a transmission function .",
    "here we model a potential imperfection by assuming the transmission to be a lorentzian resonance superimposed on top of the transmission of a saddle - point potential  @xcite as shown in fig.[fig : fig5](a ) . the temperature dependence shown in fig.[fig : fig5](b )",
    "implies that such transmission resonances disappear quickly by increasing the temperature .",
    "it is interesting though that the resonances lead to a zero bias peak in the differential conductance as shown in fig.[fig : fig5](c ) that also disappears by increasing the temperature ( not shown ) .",
    "differential conductance traces shown in this figure are calculated assuming a symmetric bias voltage applied to the qpc .",
    "the assumption that the energy - dependence of the transmission is the same for all the subbands ( except for a relative shift by the subband spacing ) results in the appearance of the zero bias peak at all the three rises of the differential conductance shown in the figure . taking into account screening effects would suppress the higher zero bias peaks .",
    "note that there are also curves with split zero - bias peaks in the zero - field differential conductance .",
    "application of an in - plane magnetic field splits the subbands and since we assumed equal transmission for spin - split subbands , the resonance appears in both subbands as shown in fig.[fig : fig5](d ) .",
    "the finite bias spectroscopy at finite magnetic field shows similar pattern as the zero - field one , but here the split zero - bias peaks are even more evident .",
    "therefore a zero bias peak can appear in @xmath4 due to a transmission resonance , get suppressed by increasing the temperature and may even split at certain gate voltages with or without the application of an in - plane magnetic field .",
    "a qualitative discussion on the origin of the different features arising in this model is presented in the appendix .    ,",
    "scaledwidth=45.0% ]    another type of imperfection that we consider is the capacitive coupling between the qpc channel and a potential well or an isolated state that can get occupied at a certain gate voltage .",
    "the qpc has a saddle - point transmission but the potential of the nano - structure shown in fig.[fig : fig6](a ) has a minimum with a certain state that can get filled by an electron / hole from either the channel or the leads .",
    "we assume that this state is weakly coupled to its environment and its occupancy is given by a fermi - dirac distribution .",
    "upon filling the impurity state at a certain gate voltage the conductance trace of the qpc is shifted along gate voltage axis proportionally to their capacitive coupling and a feature appears in the linear conductance as shown in fig.[fig : fig6](b ) .",
    "increasing the temperature leads to two effects : first , the conductance of the qpc decreases at this gate voltage and therefore the conductance value of the feature also gradually decreases , very similarly to the ` standard ' 0.7 anomaly .",
    "second , it extends the width of the feature by broadening the occupation profile of the impurity in gate voltage .",
    "this occupation profile is given by the depth of the potential well and the temperature .",
    "for temperatures above the ionization energy of the impurity , not considered here , the anomaly is expected to vanish .",
    "figure [ fig : fig6](c ) shows differential conductance data which look very similar to those of an ideal qpc .",
    "the only difference is the bunching of several @xmath32 curves at the gate voltages corresponding to the filling of the impurity ( see red arrows ) .",
    "this feature is similar to the results presented in fig.[fig : fig1](d ) . note that in contrast to the experimental data , the model assumed here does not produce any zero bias peak .",
    "the most interesting feature of this model is that the application of a zeeman field , shown in fig.[fig : fig6](d ) , results in a shift of the anomaly very similarly to the data shown in fig.[fig : fig3](a ) . a finite zeeman splitting ( with a @xmath4-factor of 2 ) is assumed for the subband but not for the localized charge state .",
    "as the spin - degenerate subbands split gradually only one subband is affected by the impurity filling .",
    "starting from 0.75@xmath37 the conductance anomaly crosses 0.5@xmath37 , saturates at 0.4@xmath37 and a seemingly independent half - plateau appears at higher fields , all very consistent with the data presented in fig.[fig : fig3](b)-(d ) .",
    "the comparison of the model with the perpendicular magnetic field experiment is based on the assumption that the effect of the perpendicular magnetic field on the qpc within the range @xmath48 5 t applied in the experiment and after subtracting the @xmath39-dependent series contact resistance is mainly a zeeman splitting and the orbital shift of the subbands and the impurity level .",

    "the factor of @xmath65 in @xmath66 comes from the spin degeneracy of the subband and in the presence of a zeeman field , @xmath67 is replaced by @xmath68 .",
    "the linear conductance @xmath29 is obtained from the zero bias ( @xmath69 ) part of this formula .",
    "the integrand is a linear functional of the transmission @xmath64 and therefore different contributions to the transmission add up in the differential conductance .",
    "first , we consider the case of a saddle - point potential whose inflection point is labelled by symbol @xmath17 in fig.[fig : fig8](a ) .",
    "if the fermi energy is at @xmath17 , an increasing bias does not change the differential conductance to first order and @xmath3 is flat at low bias voltages . at higher ( lower ) transmissions",
    "an increasing bias decreases ( increases ) the differential conductance and @xmath3 has a broad peak ( valley ) as sketched in fig.[fig : fig8](d ) .    .",
    "the red curves represent the two fermi - dirac distribution derivatives in the integrand and the blue curve represents the transmission probability .",
    "the scales are adjusted for better visibility .",
    "( d - f ) the qualitative @xmath70 dependence of @xmath71 at low biases as the fermi energy equals to the energies labeled by @xmath72 , @xmath17 and @xmath73 on the corresponding panels of ( a - c ) , respectively . ]",
    "second , we consider the case of a saddle - point potential with a resonance shown in fig.[fig : fig8](b ) .",
    "when the fermi energy is at the point @xmath17 , the @xmath3 clearly develops a sharp peak on the top of the broad background peak or valley ( caused by the saddle point potential ) discussed before . on the other hand , when the fermi energy is at point @xmath73 , the @xmath3 has a minimum at zero bias , resulting in the apparent zero magnetic - field peak - splitting .",
    "the splitting of the peaks is related to both @xmath74 and the curvature of transmission minima ( fig.[fig : fig8](e ) ) .",
    "lastly , we consider the case when there is a finite zeeman splitting between the two 1d spin subbands as depicted in fig.[fig : fig8](c ) . the potential is assumed to be the same as in fig.[fig : fig8](b ) . in this case",
    ", we have two copies of all the previously - discussed features in the differential conductance plus some new features . in particular",
    ", there is a peak whenever the fermi energy is at the resonance and the voltage bias matches the zeeman splitting .",
    "this is visible in the sketch of @xmath71 at the point @xmath17 in fig.[fig : fig8](f ) .",
    "therefore , having a peak in the differential conductance that splits with the zeeman splitting does not unambigiously point to a kondo effect .",
    "the ultimate proof of the kondo effect is the observation of a splitting that is twice the zeeman splitting .",
    "@xcite as we do not have an independent measure of the g - factor in our qpc , a quantitative comparison of the peak - splitting and zeeman shift is not feasible in this case .",
