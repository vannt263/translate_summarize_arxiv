    "the iron pnictides exhibit a rich phase diagram @xcite including magnetic , structural ( tetragonal - to - orthorhombic ) , and superconducting phase transitions @xcite .",
    "the magnetic state exhibits @xmath0 ordering of fe moments in the @xmath7-@xmath8 plane , with a concomitant structural distortion @xmath7>@xmath8 possibly correlated with the ferro orbital order @xmath1@xmath9@xmath2 as seen in arpes studies @xcite .",
    "inelastic neutron scattering experiments @xcite have shown well defined spin wave excitations with energy scale @xmath10 200 mev , persisting even above the nel temperature @xcite . evidently , short range antiferromagnetic ( af ) and ferromagnetic ( f ) order remain in the @xmath7 and @xmath8 directions respectively even above the disordering temperature for long - range magnetic order , which may account for the narrow nematic phase @xcite above the nel temperature where the ferro orbital order @xcite and structural distortion survive , as well as the temperature dependence of the measured anisotropies in @xmath7 and @xmath8 directions of magnetic excitations and resistivity @xcite .",
    "evidently , the complex multi - orbital character of the underlying microscopic description of iron pnictides plays an important role in understanding their macroscopic behavior as seen from the interplay of magnetic , orbital , structural , and transport properties .",
    "another important macroscopic behavior of iron pnictides is associated with the energy gap in the @xmath0 ordered magnetic state , as seen in optical conductivity , transport and scanning tunneling microscopy studies ; investigating the role of the multi - orbital character on the magnetic - state electronic structure is therefore of interest",
    ".    for the non - magnetic state , intensive investigations of the electronic structure of these materials by first - principle calculations @xcite and angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) experiments @xcite have revealed that the fermi surface consists of two nearly circular hole pockets around the center and elliptical electron pockets around the corner of the bz which are primarily contributed by @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 fe @xmath11 orbitals .",
    "a variety of experimental techniques have confirmed the opening of a small energy gap in the excitation spectrum associated with the onset of the @xmath0 spin - density  wave ( sdw ) order in iron pnictides @xcite . the fermi surface ( fs ) undergoes a complex multi - orbital reconstruction through the non - magnetic to antiferromagnetic transition .",
    "arpes experiments have revealed that the electronic states are strongly modified across the sdw transition @xcite .",
    "bands get folded and hybridized , resulting in band splitting and opening of sdw gaps .",
    "consequently , the fermi surface breaks up into small droplet - like structures , supporting only a fraction of the original fs areas .",
    "these results are consistent with quantum oscillation measurements @xcite showing the reconstruction and drastic reduction of fermi surface area , which can be as small as @xmath12 of the original bz area for @xmath13 .    in addition",
    ", investigations of optical and transport properties by optical spectroscopy @xcite and broadband spectroscopic ellipsometry @xcite measurements on single - crystalline iron pnictides have found an energy gap for electronic excitations in the sdw ordered state .",
    "the carrier density is reduced substantially in the ordered state with consequent decrease in optical conductivity .",
    "also , as inferred from the results of infrared studies , short - range af correlations have been suggested as being responsible for the pseudogap in iron superconductors @xcite .",
    "moreover , scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) studies have also seen an energy gap in the density of states near the fermi energy @xcite .",
    "close proximity of the superconducting phase and magnetically ordered parent phase in iron pnictides have naturally led to comparisons with cuprates @xcite .",
    "however , the magnitude of the experimentally measured energy gap at the fermi energy ( up to @xmath14 mev for @xmath15 ) is significantly smaller than the usual sdw gap @xmath16 associated with af ordering with staggered magnetization @xmath17 and local coulomb interaction @xmath18 , as in the hubbard model representation for cuprates .",
    "moreover , these sdw gaps open at energies typically away from the fermi energy in realistic multi - band tight binding models which yield the correct fs structure in agreement with dft calculations and arpes studies in the non - magnetic state .    in this paper , a magneto - orbital coupling mechanism is proposed for a realistic three - band model at half filling for iron pnictides involving @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 orbitals of fe , which is shown to account for the weak non - conventional energy gap at the fermi energy due to a composite effect of the orbital mixing ( hybridization ) between the @xmath3 and @xmath4 orbitals and the @xmath0 sdw magnetic order .",
    "for realistic three - band - model parameters , the energy gap is found to be in quantitative agreement with experiments .",
    "the gapped sdw state in the realistic three band model at half filling therefore provides , in analogy with cuprates , a suitable reference state for theoretically investigating effects of electron / hole doping in iron pnictides .",

    "there are two circular hole pockets around the center and elliptical electron pockets around ( @xmath39 ) and ( @xmath40 ) in the unfolded bz .",
    "the two hole pockets involve primarily the @xmath25 and @xmath26 orbitals , while the electron pockets centered at ( @xmath39 ) [ ( @xmath40 ) ] arise mainly from the hybridization of the @xmath33 and @xmath26 [ @xmath25 ] orbitals .",

    ", there is a weak band gap involving the @xmath33 and @xmath25 orbitals which opens up near the fermi energy , as seen in fig .",
    "3 , which is found to be robust with respect to small variations in the hopping parameters .",
    "it is important to note that while partial density of states for @xmath25 and @xmath26 orbitals are symmetric in the pm state [ fig .",
    "2(a ) ] , they become anisotropic in the sdw state [ 2(b ) ] .",
    "the dos for the @xmath26 orbital has a peak further away from fermi energy ( @xmath53 ) than that for @xmath25 and has a relatively smaller contribution at @xmath53 .",

    "it is important to note that the opening of this gap for the @xmath25 and @xmath33 orbitals due to the orbital mixing term @xmath34 critically requires the presence of the sdw magnetic ordering , as is evident from the absence of any gap in the non - magnetic state ( @xmath54 ) , even with the mixing term @xmath34 included [ fig .",
    "4 ( a ) ] . for simplicity ,",
    "we have taken equal exchange fields ( @xmath55 ev , @xmath56 ev ) for all three orbitals .    to summarize , _ both _ the sdw order as well as the orbital mixing term @xmath34 between the @xmath25 and @xmath33 orbitals are critically important in the formation of the weak energy gap near the fermi energy .",
    "only the @xmath34 term ( non - magnetic state ) or only the sdw order ( @xmath57 ) are independently not sufficient to open the gap , both must be present together .",
    "a magneto - orbital coupling mechanism is proposed below to account for this non - conventional weak energy gap near the fermi energy involving the @xmath25 and @xmath33 orbitals . in the ( @xmath19 )",

    "the sdw band energies for the upper ( + ) and lower ( - ) bands are given by : @xmath67 the exchange fields @xmath68 and @xmath69 open band gaps at @xmath52 where @xmath70 . however , these gaps open at energies away from the fermi energy , as discussed earlier [ see fig . 4 ] . for @xmath59 close to zero , which is far away from where the band gaps opens ,",

    "as the orbital mixing terms also play an important role in the mixed composition ( @xmath33 and @xmath36 ) of the elliptical electron pockets in the non - magnetic - state fs structure , the magneto - orbital coupling provides a subtle link between the non - magnetic - state fs features and the sdw state weak energy gap .",
    "furthermore , the non - conventional nature of the weak energy gap for quasiparticle excitations with orbital mixing provides a sharp contrast from the conventional strong sdw gap in cuprate antiferromagnets .",
