    "we investigated the interference effect of the open charm - resonances with the short distance penguins in the sm .",
    "the interference seen in the lhcb - data @xcite shows a more pronounced structure with opposite sign as compared to the fa of the sm .",
    "the fa prediction follows from first principles from a dispersion relation through @xmath46 ( besii - data ) . whether or not the effect can be described within the sm depends on the size of non - factorisable correction .",
    "the latter are @xmath61-suppressed but colour enhanced .",
    "a parton estimate indicates an average correction of a factor @xmath62 as compared to the fa which is too small a result by a factor of seven . by performing combined fits to the besii- and lhcb - data we tested for cancellations under the duality - integral .",
    "we found no indications that the parton estimate falls shorts by a sizeable amount .",
    "in this first analysis , we have not found any signs that the sm or qcd respectively could account for the effect .",
    "physics related to charm is known to be a notoriously difficult and further investigations are certainly highly desirable .",
    "we have shown that the effect is presumably connected to the @xmath63-anomalies found in 2013 . out of the three scenarios chosen , to resolve the ambiguity from passing to @xmath64 to @xmath65 , the @xmath63-data favours scenario ( i ) with @xmath66 .",
    "the reader is referred to table [ tab : ps ] and section [ sec : lowq2 ] for further remarks",
    ". we have devised strategies to test for the microscopic structure of the effect . for example",
    "the @xmath63 and the @xmath67 observables are sensitive to the opposite parity combination @xmath68 of wilson coefficients .",
    "the knowledge of both parity combinations would allow to infer on right - handed currents which can not be explained by qcd interactions .",
    "in the last section we have given a brief outlook on consequences of the effect and how they could relate to other observables and old standing puzzles such as the non - leptonic @xmath23-decays .",
    "one of the most important outcomes of our investigations are that the anomalous resonance - behaviour , the 2013 @xmath63-anomalies and presumably the @xmath23-decays have the same roots . whether it is new physics or aspects of strong interactions which we do not understand is the real question .",
    "we therefore feel that these new findings sharpen the quest for investigations into @xmath69-physics .",

    "the complete anomalous dimension matrix to three loops is taken from @xcite , and the expressions for the wilson coefficients @xmath117 at the electroweak scale are taken from @xcite for @xmath118 and @xmath119 and @xcite for @xmath120 .",
    "these are always employed at @xmath121 to set the initial conditions for the rg flow ; that is to say the uncertainty owing to @xmath61 terms at this scale is ignored , although uncertainty of the masses of the @xmath122 boson and top quark is accounted for . since @xmath123 is small this should have a negligible effect on the overall uncertainty of our calculations .",
    "the values of the wilson coefficients are given in table 8 of @xcite .",

    "note , generally , only the @xmath37 terms are colour suppressed since all higher order corrections couple to the colour octet operator .",
    "the factorisable contribution comes with the colour suppressed ( c.f .",

    "the low scale @xmath143 is only present in the form factor .",
    "this is the picture of factorisation into uv and ir physics .",
    "it might in principle be that in a full computation effects of @xmath143 would be visible but since @xmath143 is put to zero in @xmath144 it would also seem that this effect can not be estimated by varying @xmath145 to a very low scale .",
    "moreover , it is clear that by varying there is a certain trading between the factorisable and non - factorisable contributions .",
    "the special circumstance that we have got @xmath146 from the data , which is more reliable and improvable with experimental data , suggests to choose the scale towards the direction where the factorisable contribution grows in relative size .",

    "<S> ignoring this aspect there are are still constraints from the @xmath35-quark scale to be accounted for . </S>",
    "<S> operators of the type potentially contribute to @xmath36 through closed charm - loops . </S>",
    "<S> these observables are highly constrained by current data yet at @xmath37 the contribution can be avoided if @xmath38 which is the case for all dirac structures @xmath39 except @xmath40 and @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> we refer the reader to reference @xcite for a discussion of effects of new physics on @xmath36 . in a low scale </S>",
    "<S> new physics scenario the study of higher dimensional operators seems imperative since the @xmath42-suppression argument does not apply . </S>",
    "<S> the renormalisation group evolution and classification of dimension 7 operators for @xmath43 has been studied in @xcite . * </S>",
    "<S> a very important aspect is that for @xmath44 the charm - loop in the fa is not described by a diagonal correlation function . </S>",
    "<S> this has two consequences : ( i ) the residues @xmath45 in are not proportional to the residues in @xmath46 ( ii ) the residues @xmath45 are generally not positive ( note that ( ii ) implies ( i ) ) . or in terms of a model independent statement : the discontinuity is not positive definite anymore . </S>",
    "<S> hence the tendencies , although not compelling , seen in fits c ) and d ) in table [ tab : fit1 ] for scaled residues might be explained by _ either _ the presence of new operators in the fa or sizeable non - factorisable corrections . * </S>",
    "<S> the quantitative description of @xmath47-decays has a long and problematic history . </S>",
    "<S> the situation is most pronounced for the @xmath48-wave charmonium states @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> for example @xmath50 , @xmath51 @xcite where the former but not the latter vanishes in the fa . in the sm </S>",
    "<S> it is usually concluded that there have to be large non - factorisable corrections . in qcd </S>",
    "<S> factorisation non - factorisable corrections , which were shown to be free of endpoint divergences upon inclusion of colour octet operators @xcite , lead to a qualitative improvement in many aspects . on the quantitative level </S>",
    "<S> the essence of the analysis @xcite ( c.f . </S>",
    "<S> figure 9 in that reference ) seems to be that for very large charm masses the @xmath52 branching fractions can nearly be accommodated for but the smallness of @xmath53 @xcite remains unresolved . with the current pdg numbers the mismatch is roughly a factor of five or higher . even in the absence of a concrete approach to non - facorisable </S>",
    "<S> correction it seems difficult to explain why @xmath54-rate is so small as compared to the @xmath55-rate when both vanish in the fa . </S>",
    "<S> it is tempting to speculate that this puzzle is related to our findings . it might be possible to introduce operators which contribute at @xmath37 to @xmath56 but not to @xmath57 .      in this subsection </S>",
    "<S> we would like to address possible improvements and further steps of investigation . without further data the basic directions are to analyse whether or not qcd can explain the excess and to investigate the effects of operators of the type on all kinds of observables through computations and global fits . with the advent of new data </S>",
    "<S> there are , as usual , new possibilities . </S>",
    "<S> first , one can try to fit for @xmath58 in the high @xmath12-region as outlined above . </S>",
    "<S> second , deviations in the low @xmath12-region below the @xmath59-resonance , where perturbation theory is trustworthy , are signals whose effects can not be associated with resonance physics . yet , based on our findings , we expect deviations to grow towards the @xmath59 resonance region . </S>",
    "<S> third , one could improve on the fit - model by a k - matrix formalism , including information on the @xmath59 , @xmath60 and incorporating a background model for the discontinuity . then one can use the dispersion relation to obtain the amplitude and fit the real subtraction constant from the data . </S>"
