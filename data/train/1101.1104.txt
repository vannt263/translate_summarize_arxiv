    "the michaelis - menten ( mm ) scheme  @xcite is a fundamental building block of many models of protein interactions : an enzyme , @xmath0 , reacts with a protein , @xmath1 , resulting in an intermediate complex , @xmath2 . in turn",
    ", this complex can break down into a product , @xmath3 , and the enzyme @xmath0 .",
    "it is frequently assumed that formation of @xmath2 is reversible while its breakup is not .",
    "the process is represented by the following sequence of reactions  @xcite @xmath4    frequently catalytic activity in protein interaction network is modeled by mm equations  @xcite .",
    "this gives rise to _ coupled enzymatic networks _",
    ", where the substrate of one reaction acts as enzyme in another reaction . a direct application of the law of mass action to such models typically leads to high dimensional differential equations which are often stiff , and difficult to study directly .",
    "a number of methods have been introduced to address these problems .",
    "most of these methods are based on _ quasi steady state assumptions _ which take advantage of the differences in characteristic timescales of the quantities being modeled .",
    "it is typically assumed that the chemical species , or some combinations of chemical species , can be divided into two classes : one which equilibrates rapidly , and a second which evolves more slowly  @xcite .",
    "assuming that the members of the first class equilibrate instantaneously leads to a reduced model involving only elements of the second class .",
    "reduction methods differ in their assumption on which chemical species , or combinations thereof , are assigned to the two different classes .",
    "for instance , the _ standard quasi steady state assumption ( sqssa ) _ posits that the concentrations of the intermediate complexes change quickly compared to the protein concentration  @xcite .",
    "an alternative is the _ reverse quasi steady state assumption ( rqssa ) _ where the protein concentration is assumed to change rapidly compared to intermediate complexes  @xcite .",
    "rigorous justifications of these methods are largely available only for isolated reactions of the type shown in scheme  , and the goldbeter - koshland switch  @xcite .    the total quasi steady state assumption ( tqssa ) was introduced to broaden the range of parameters over which a _ quasi steady state assumption _ is valid . under this assumption",
    "the concentration of the intermediate complex , @xmath2 , evolves quickly compared to the sum of the intermediate complex and the protein concentration  @xcite .",
    "numerical experiments and heuristic arguments suggest that tqssa may be valid in coupled enzymatic networks over a very broad set of parameters  @xcite .    here",
    "we aim to provide a theoretical foundation for the reductions used in numerical studies of enzymatic networks .",
    "a standard model reduction technique for systems involving quantities that change on different timescales is geometric singular perturbation theory ( gspt )  @xcite .",
    "for instance , this theory has been used by khoo and hegland to prove several results obtained earlier by borghans , et al . using self consistency arguments  @xcite .",
    "gspt has also been used to reduce other models of biochemical reactions  @xcite .",
    "we derive a sufficient condition for the validity of tqssa in arbitrary networks of proteins and enzymes provided the interactions are of mm type and can be modeled by mass action kinetics .",
    "this directly extends previous work , like that of pedersen , et al .",
    "@xcite who proposed a sufficient condition for the validity of tqssa in the goldbeter - koshland switch .",
    "the direct application of the tqssa to coupled enzymatic networks generally leads to a differential - algebraic system .",
    "the algebraic part of this system consists of coupled quadratic equations that are typically impossible to solve .",
    "our second aim is to show that , under certain assumptions on the structure of the network , it is possible to circumvent this problem using ideas introduced by bennett , et al .",
    "this allows us to obtain reduced set of differential equations for a class of protein interaction networks in terms of protein concentrations only .",
    "we proceed as follows : in section  [ isolatedmichaelismentenreaction ] we review the original michaelis  menten scheme .",
    "we introduce terminology , and illustrate our approach in a simple setting . in this section",
    "we also give a brief overview of the theory of geometric singular perturbation theory , which is fundamental in proving the validity of the reduced equations . in section  [ sec : may3010_twoprotein ] we extend our approach to a well studied two protein network that plays part in the g2-to - mitosis phase ( g2/m ) transition in the eukaryotic cell cycle .",
    "we present the ideas in the most general setting in section  [ sec : thegeneralproblem ] , where we derive the general form of the reduced equations .",
    "each section begins by the discussion of the tqssa in the context of the network under consideration , and closes with a derivation of the reduced equations under the tqssa , as well as sufficient conditions under which the tqssa holds .",
    "a number of technical details used in the proofs of the main results are given in the appendices .",
    "we note that throughout the presentation the law of mass action is assumed to hold .",
    "the mm scheme is frequently used to model enzymatic processes in solution which are ubiquitous in biology . as discussed in the introduction",
    ", a number of different approaches have been proposed to justify the reduced equations mathematically .",
    "we start by giving a detailed overview of the tqssa approach based on geometric singular perturbation theory ( gspt)@xcite . the setting of a single mm type reaction will be used to introduce the main ideas and difficulties of reducing equations that describe larger reaction networks .    for notational convenience we will use variable names to denote both a chemical species and its concentration . for instance",
    ", @xmath0 denotes both an enzyme and its concentration .",
    "reaction   reaction obeys two natural constrains : the total amount of protein and enzyme remain constant .",
