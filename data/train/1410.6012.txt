    "over the past years , there has been continuing interest in topological phase transitions of polymers .",
    "one focus has been on modelling dna .",
    "for example , in experiments @xcite single molecules of twist - storing polymers such as double stranded dna can be held torsionally constrained and under constant stretching force .",
    "these experiments show abrupt phase transitions known as buckling , and the formation of conformational structures known as plectonemes .",
    "we are interested here in what topological and/or geometrical phase transitions might occur in a single - stranded polymer : can one , for example , find buckling and the formation of plectonemes .    to this end , we consider a model of self - avoiding walks on the simple cubic lattice in a half - space with an appropriately defined writhe .",
    "we will refer to the variable conjugate to writhe as ( pseudo-)torque , and work in an ensemble in which this torque is held constant .",
    "we perform simulations with the flatperm algorithm @xcite , in which walks are grown from an end that is tethered to the surface .",
    "it is important to realise that in these simulations only one end is held fixed .",
    "we find that upon varying torque there is a first - order phase transition between states of small and high average writhe .",
    "however , in contrast to the experimental situation described above , we do not see a buckling transition . instead , the low and high writhe states are dominated by different distributions of effective knot types .",
    "this scenario seems unchanged by the presence of a pulling force applied to the endpoint .",
    "because this transition is driven by the change of knot - type , we argue that it is also insensitive to the choice of lattice .    while it is not clear how to create an experimental realisation of our model , we are interested in the principle of the existence of a topological phase transition .",
    "another motivation comes from recent work @xcite , where it was shown that the linking number of a lattice ribbon , which is a lattice version of a double - stranded polymer @xcite , is equal to the writhe of the center line of the ribbon .",
    "the center line is a restricted three - dimensional self - avoiding walk on the half - integer simple cubic lattice , so a model weighting the writhe of such a self - avoiding walk can be considered as weighting the linking number of a lattice ribbon .",
    "there are two key differences between the experiments mentioned above and such a model based on a lattice ribbon .",
    "the experiments are conducted in a fixed linking number ensemble .",
    "this means that the number of times the molecule is turned is equivalent to the linking number of the dna .",
    "this relation between linking number and turns is guaranteed by the experimental setup , which prevents the dna from passing over its endpoints .",
    "otherwise the dna could just change its linking number by passing over its endpoints so that adding turns to the molecule becomes irrelevant in the sense of statistical mechanics .",
    "another consequence of the fact that the dna can not pass over its endpoints is that it can not form knots .",
    "in contrast , the lattice ribbon model related to the model we study here allows for knotting .",
    "such an ensemble is not easily realized in experiments , since you would presumably still require the above relation between the number of turns and the linking number to hold .",
    "consider self - avoiding walks ( saw ) on the simple cubic lattice .",
    "an @xmath0-step saw @xmath1 is formed by @xmath0 edges , or equivalently @xmath2 vertices @xmath3 such that    1 .",

    "the pulling force is aligned along the @xmath10 direction so that the extension of the saw is given by @xmath11 .",
    "let @xmath12 be the number of saws of length @xmath0 with extension @xmath13 and a parameter @xmath14 which corresponds to writhe and which is defined below .",
    "then , the canonical partition function reads @xmath15.\\label{eq : partition - function}\\ ] ]    the parameter @xmath16 shall be referred to as ( reduced ) torque , whereas @xmath17 shall be referred to as ( reduced ) force .",
    "technically , writhe is defined only for a closed curve . to make sense of the writhe of an open curve , it is usually necessary to close the open curve in a well defined way .",
    "we approach this problem in a different way .",
    "the writhe of a self - avoiding closed curve or polygon @xmath18 @xcite on the simple cubic lattice can be expressed as @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a copy of @xmath18 translated by a vector @xmath21 and @xmath22 is the linking number of the two polygons @xmath18 and @xmath20 .",
    "the vectors @xmath21 can be chosen to be @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 .",
    "on the other hand , linking number can be computed as the number of signed crossings in a projection plane .",
    "suppose the curves @xmath18 and @xmath20 are projected into the @xmath27-plane at @xmath28 , then the operator @xmath29 can be defined to sum up all the signed crossing @xmath30 @xmath31 so that @xmath32 and in particular @xmath33 .",
    "when the curves are not closed , linking number is not defined but the operators @xmath34 remain defined . while the operator result in general depends on the projection plane , by averaging over all planes the result becomes trivially independent of the plane . for an open self - avoiding curve @xmath35 , we define the integer @xmath36.\\ ] ]    when the curve is closed then @xmath37 , so that @xmath38 is closely related to the writhe .",
    "it can be considered an approximation of the writhe of a closed curve @xmath39 $ ] that is obtained when one tries to close a given open self - avoiding curve @xmath35 `` simply '' .",
    "@xmath40 is invariant under rotations and translations that respect the lattice symmetry .",
    "thus , @xmath14 is a true microcanonical parameter of a saw on the simple cubic lattice . under reflections at a coordinate plane , @xmath14 picks up a sign . the quantity @xmath14 shall be referred to as the writhe of the walk .",
    "an embedding of the circle @xmath41 is called a knot @xcite .",
    "any knot defines an equivalence class called the knot type @xmath42 .",
    "two knots are equivalent if one knot can be transformed into the other via homotopy transformation .",
    "there are two kind of knot types .",
    "prime knots like the unknot @xmath43 and composite knots like the concatenation of two trefoils @xmath44 .    for any saw @xmath45",
    "as defined above , define the corresponding knot by the following procedure .",
    "in the first step , add @xmath46 vertices @xmath47 @xmath48 in @xmath10 direction to the end of the saw .",
    "the coordinates of these vertices read @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 .",

    "finally , add vertices in @xmath58 direction until the @xmath53 component becomes zero .",

    ", we expect the gross features of our conclusion not to be affected , as they relate to changes in whether dominant configurations in the ensemble are typically knotted and the way we construct our reference polygon is consistently applied .    for any saw @xmath61 with defined knot type",

    "we use an algorithm similar to the one used in @xcite to detect whether the reference polygon of a saw is the unknot .",

    "the flatperm algorithm grows a saw one vertex at a time by selecting randomly one out of @xmath67 possibilities that keep the walk self - avoiding .",

    "turning to the case when no pulling force is applied ( @xmath109 ) , we consider the scaling of the half - width of the peak of the writhe @xmath149 , the peak height of the writhe @xmath150 , and the writhe distribution itself .",
    "figure  [ fig : scaling ]  ( a ) shows that the half - width @xmath149 decreases to zero faster than @xmath151 , and figure  [ fig : scaling ]  ( b ) shows that the peak height @xmath150 increases faster than linear in @xmath0 .",
    "this is again indicative of a first - order transition , as the build - up of a bi - modality goes along with stronger super - linear scaling .",

    "the peak rapidly moves with @xmath0 towards smaller values of the torque and becomes more pronounced.,width=384 ]    figure  [ fig : lambda_n16_n24 ] shows @xmath167 for saws between @xmath164 and @xmath168 .",
    "when @xmath164 , there is no peak in @xmath122 on varying the torque , while for @xmath169 there exists a distinct peak in @xmath122 .",
    "this can be understood by noting that @xmath170 is the minimal length for a saw to form a loop and pass through that loop with exactly one edge .",
    "this allows the saw to gain a significant amount of writhe .",
    "when we look at the reference polygon of a walk that has stepped through a loop we find that the polygon is knotted .",
    "the knot that is produced is the trefoil @xmath171 , and so the open configuration forms a partial trefoil .",
    "this indicates that the existence of knots is important in driving this transition .",
    "the graphic shows representative configurations of the two phases for a saw of length @xmath172 on both sides of the phase transition at @xmath173 and @xmath174 . at these two values of the torque",
    "the fluctuation in writhe is half of the peak fluctuation .",
    "the low - torque ( left ) and high torque ( right ) configurations have writhe @xmath175 and @xmath176 , respectively .",
    "these values are close to the expectation values at these torques .",
    "the @xmath10 direction is to the right , so that by forming the reference polygon we find that the given configurations with @xmath175 and @xmath176 are equivalent to the unknot and the trefoil , respectively.,width=576 ]    figure  [ fig : equilibrium ] shows two typical configurations of @xmath168-step saws . on the left - hand side , a saw with writhe @xmath175",
    "is shown , which will occur for small values of torque .",
    "the reference polygon for this configuration is the unknot . on the right - hand side , a saw with writhe @xmath176",

    "the reference polygon for this configuration is the trefoil .",
    "for walks of length @xmath172 , the figure shows the probability that walks with a fixed writhe @xmath14 have no reference polygon ( thick / violet line ) .",
    "it further shows the conditional probability that the reference polygon of these walks is an unknot , given that a reference polygon exists ( open circles ) . ]    for walks of length @xmath172 that have a reference polygon , figure  [ fig : unknot - density_n30 ] shows the probability that the reference polygon of walks with fixed writhe @xmath14 is the unknot .",
    "there is a sharp transition between walks of small writhe where that probability is close to one and walks of large writhe where that probability is close to zero . walks with @xmath177 are typically unknotted , whereas walks with writhe @xmath178 are typically knotted .",
    "figure  [ fig : unknot - density_n30 ] also shows the probability that walks of length @xmath172 with fixed writhe @xmath14 have no reference polygon .",
    "one can see that while these walks exist for all values of @xmath14 , the proportion is around @xmath179 , and in fact decreases for large writhe .",
    "we thus conclude that in neither phase configurations without reference polygon are significant .",
    "we note that there is a peak in this probability near the transition , which is due to the fact that in configurations that are not tight , a reversal of the final step of the walk both increases the writhe and decreases the probability of the existence of an associated reference knot .",
    "configurations with large writhe are tight and typically have the ends of the walk on their exterior boundary , hence increasing the probability of the presence an associated reference polygon .",
    "in this paper we considered the ensemble of self - avoiding walks in the half - space on the simple cubic lattice , weighted by their writhe and the distance of their endpoint from the surface .",
    "we showed that there is a first - order phase transition between states of small and high average writhe upon varying the torque .",
    "our investigation of short lengths indicates that the low and high writhe states are dominated by different knot types .",
    "more generally , this transition should be regarded as a transition between phases dominated by configurations of different knot type distributions . for small torque",
    ", a saw can contain a knot , with the knot type drawn from a certain distribution of knot types .",
    "this clearly depends on the length of the saw ; short saws are unknotted , whereas saws are almost certainly knotted if they are sufficiently long .",
    "when increasing torque , the distribution of knot types seem to change abruptly at a critical value of the torque .",
    "this happens regardless of the strength of the pulling force applied to the endpoint . because this transition is driven by the change of knot - type , we believe that it is insensitive to the choice of lattice",
    ".    walks with less than 17 steps can not knot , and the transition is absent .",
    "in contrast , for a reasonably short walk of length @xmath168 , we find that below the transition the ensemble is dominated by unknotted configurations , whereas above the transition the ensemble is dominated by trefoil configurations having knot type @xmath171 .",
    "in our simulations we have considered saws up to 256 vertices , which when considering knot types for saw is relatively short @xcite .",
    "we can not rule out the appearance of further phase transitions as the length of the walk is increased , but it is certainly likely that there exists at least one phase transition in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "we further note that there are many composite knots with small writhe @xcite , so that increasing the torque will bias towards the appearance of certain types of knots .",
    "lastly , we have performed some short simulations weighting the linking number of lattice ribbons @xcite .",
    "these simulations indicate the same scenario as described here , with a transition associated with different knot types , rather than the formation of plectonemes .",
