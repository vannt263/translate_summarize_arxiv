    "the phenomenon of bi - drifting has been seen as a challenge to the carousel model for polar cap emission , first proposed by ruderman & sutherland in 1975 . in this popular model emission in the form of drifting subpulses",
    "arises through the rotation of `` sparks '' located on the pulsar s polar cap .",
    "the rotation is due to @xmath0 drift on open magnetic field lines , and represents the failure of the plasma to precisely corotate with the star , so the drift around the polar cap is opposite in sense to the rotation of the pulsar . by its nature , in the aligned geometry assumed by ruderman & sutherland the drift can only have one sense around the magnetic pole ( otherwise the sparks and associated emission would rotate faster than the star itself ) .",
    "however , the rate of drift may vary with the degree of discharge of the electric potential difference .    in an inclined pulsar",
    "the _ observed _ drift direction in the pulse window will depend on whether the observer s line of sight crosses the carousel within or outside the angle between the pulsar s rotation and magnetic axes ( ruderman 1976 ) . if the carousel is circular ( or symmetric about the plane containing both the rotational and magnetic axes  the fiducial plane )",
    "only one sense will be observed in both components ( or in all four components if we are dealing with two nested carousels ) . in most pulsars which exhibit subpulse drift",
    "the observed sense is always in the same direction in a given pulsar ( weltevrede 2006 , 2007a ) .",
    "exceptionally , examples have been found ( psr b2303 + 30 , redman 2005 ) where the drift appears to reverse , but does this in all components at the same time and can be argued to arise from aliasing , a consequence of the observer s inability to sample the rapidly - moving drift sufficiently often and thereby giving the illusion of reverse drift ( gupta 2004 ) .",
    "in contrast , `` bi - drifting '' , whereby the subpulses in different components move _ simultaneously _ in opposing directions , has not found an easy explanation .",
    "it is a feature originally observed uniquely in the four - component pulsar j0815 + 09 ( mclaughlin 2004 ) but later also in psr b183904 ( weltevrede 2006 ) .",
    "a description of the properties of psr b183904 are given in weltevrede 2016 ( henceforth paper i ) , where the difficulties for modelling the bi - drift emission are described in detail .",
    "psrs j0815 + 09 and b183904 have rotational periods which are slightly above average ( 0.85 s and 1.8 s respectively ) and inferred magnetic field strengths somewhat below average , ( 0.8 and 0.1 @xmath1 g respectively ) , but these properties are in no way unusual among pulsars .",
    "there is therefore no suggestion that bi - drifting is the result of exceptional physical conditions .",
    "furthermore , for many pulsars  for example in the detailed work on psr b0943 + 10 ( deshpande & rankin 2001 , suleymanova & rankin 2009 , backus 2011 , bilous 2014 )  the assumption of a perfectly circular carousel has proved capable of giving insight into the likely number of sparks and their rotation speed .    however , the imposition of precise circularity has always been a mathematical convenience , requiring a precise dipolar magnetic field surrounding the magnetic pole , whereas it is known that the ruderman & sutherland model requires the presence of multipoles to function as a source of pair - creation .",
    "there is then no reason why the @xmath0 drift would be perpendicular to the dipolar radial vector .",
    "this suggests that circularity is simply an approximation , even if perhaps a good one , to the real polar cap condition .",
    "if the existence of a carousel can be accepted , then as an alternative to a circular form we have sought a geometry which to first order has all the basic features of a circle : a closed convex shape centred on the magnetic pole .",
    "an ellipse was chosen , not only because it has these features , but also from a practical point of view it can be dealt with more easily mathematically and approximates naturally to a circle when its eccentricity @xmath2 is close to zero .",
    "as will be seen , in most pulsars the difference may be barely detectable observationally and the ellipse , like the circle , remains an approximation reflecting some little understood underlying physics .",
    "when an elliptical carousel is so aligned that either its major or minor axis lies in the fiducial plane , then it is immediately obvious , as with the circular case , that bi - drifting can not be observed .",
    "however , an elliptical carousel may be _ tilted _ with respect to the fiducial plane . as is formally shown in the next section ,",
    "this allows bi - drifting to be observed at least for a limited range of sightlines .",
    "there is no _ a priori _ physical reason why a pulsar s carousel has any particular orientation with respect to our line of sight or be centred on the magnetic pole , and indeed , as we estimate below , carousels with extreme eccentricity and tilt are unlikely to be common  otherwise bi - drifitng would be more frequently observed .    to model the emission of the two known bi - drifting pulsars , both of which have four outer components",
    ", we need to consider two nested beams / carousels , the presence of which has been plausibly argued for many pulsars with m and d classification by rankin ( 1993 ) . for convenience , we assume here for each pulsar that the inner and outer carousels have identical geometry ( they are ellipses with the same eccentricity and common major axis , differing only in their radii ) .",
    "however , we would stress that in reality the divergencies from circular carousels ( and emission beams ) need not follow our precise mathematics , and , further , the inner carousel may have a different form to the outer .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that by permitting near - circular , somewhat egg - shaped , carousels to exist , bi - drifting and a range of other apparently puzzling observational features may be explained without necessarily requiring any additional physics .    in the next section we present the formal calculation based on a tilted elliptical beam , which we show to be capable of displaying bi - drifting . in section 3",
    "we discuss how a tilted beam might explain the two known bi - drifters and in section 4 a wider range of pulsar phenomena . in section 5",
    "we consider the observational effects , including mode - changing , of allowing the carousel alignment to vary in time , and in section 6 briefly discuss possible physical scenarios which might give rise to asymmetric carousels . in section 7",
    "we summarise our conclusions .",
    "the first purpose of this paper is to formally demonstrate how bi - drifting can arise when an appropriate asymmetric beam is observed .",
    "the beam is assumed to be generated by a carousel of similar topography on the pulsar s polar cap . for mathematical convenience",
    "we consider the beam to have the form of an ellipse with the magnetic axis at its centre .",
    "the ellipse s minor axis is tilted by an angle @xmath3 from the fiducial plane to the fiducial plane , it would be equivalent to transforming @xmath4 in the formulae given here . ]",
    "[ fig1 ] ) . before tilting , the equation of the ellipse expressed in terms of ( @xmath5 ) , the beam s azimuthal and co -",
    "latitudinal coordinates respectively , is + = 1 . here",
    "@xmath6 and @xmath7 are the dimensions of the major and minor axes respectively , so that the eccentricity @xmath2 is given by @xmath8 .",
    "following the tilt , the point at which the tangent to the ellipse is vertical ( i.e. parallel to the @xmath9-axis ) swings by an angle @xmath10 to the @xmath11-axis to a point where @xmath12 such that d=_a ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] , left and appendix ) .",
    "let us assume a carousel of beam elements circulates anti - clockwise around the centre of the ellipse , which is consistent ( ruderman 1976 ) with a line of sight traversing from left to right ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) at an impact angle @xmath13",
    ". then any horizontal line of sight ( a valid approximation for pulsars well away from alignment ) moving across the lower plane below the line @xmath12 will record subpulse drift from earlier to later pulse phase in both the leading and trailing components throughout the plane ( positive drift `` + '' ) .",
    "however between @xmath12 and @xmath14 the drift will be earlier to later in the leading component and later to earlier in the trailing component ( negative drift ``  '' ) .",
    "thus `` bi - drifting '' may be observed .",
    "clearly , the reverse phenomenon can occur in the upper half - plane ( @xmath15 ) if @xmath16 .",
    "thus four different patterns may be observed :   ,  + , +  , + + .",
    "the tilt means that the maximum possible impact parameter which can still observe the beam is greater than @xmath17 ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , right ) and is given by _",
    "0=_a(1-e^2 ^ 2)^ ( see appendix ) .",
    "so , for given @xmath3 and @xmath2 , the chance of observing bi - drifting is = . for fairly extreme values of asymmetry in the beam ,",
    "say @xmath18 and @xmath19 , this ratio is about 0.5 .",
    "thus the observed rarity of bi - drifting indicates that these values are uncommon in practice . for @xmath20 and @xmath21 , for example , the chance of detecting bi - drifting drops dramatically to 1.3% .",
    "thus it is quite possible for tilted beams to be widespread without bi - drifting being observed .",
    "expanding this idea to account for the bi - drifting in psr j0815 + 09 , which has four profile components , we now consider a double - cone structure .",
    "for simplicity we assume the beam to consist of two nested ellipses of the same eccentricity , tilted by the same angle .",
    "equation [ eq2 ] now gives two different azimuthal bands of widths @xmath22 and @xmath23 corresponding to the major axes of the inner and outer ellipses , both of which are likely to be very small relative to the beam width @xmath6 unless the tilt angle is large and the ellipse far from circular .",
    "then theoretically we may observe any of five different drift - patterns , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , of which three exhibit bi - drifting . a further three possible bi - drift sequences within @xmath23 , reversed in drift direction to those given in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , would also be possible if the tilt angle of the ellipse were reversed ( if the major axis ran from bottom left to upper right in the figure ) .",
    "an interesting consequence of the asymmetric carousel model is that bi - drifting observed at low frequencies may disappear , or at least diminish , at higher frequencies . if a radius - to - frequency mapping is present ( cordes 1978 ) , then for a given @xmath13 the beam is smaller as frequency increases , hence the observer s line of sight samples emission at larger @xmath24 .",
    "single - pulse observations of both known bi - drifting pulsars at l - band and above would be of value in testing and resolving this .",
    "as argued above , in most pulsars it is more likely that @xmath25 will be small , so that the observed sense of drift will be the same across the profile  although the rate of drift ( and hence @xmath26 , the drift band separation in pulse longitude ) will vary from component to component and the width of the integrated components will reflect this .",
    "for example , a line of sight which intersects the carousel of fig",
    ".  [ fig1 ] in the upper sector where the drift is in the same sense in both components , will show the subpulses drifting across a narrower window in the leading component .",
    "the observed drift band repetition time ( @xmath27 ) will be identical in both components , and as a consequence the drift band will be steeper in the leading component . in double - cone carousels such as fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] both the leading components will be narrow and the trailing components broad and possibly merged ( or the reverse if the tilt is in the opposite sense ) .",
    "the profiles and subpulse behaviour of psr j1819 + 1305 ( rankin & wright 2008 ) , and arguably psr b1918 + 19 ( rankin 2013 ) , may result from this geometry .",
    "in figs .  [ fig1 ] and  [ fig2 ] we have assumed that the line of sight is a straight line .",
    "this is valid for angles of inclination ( @xmath28 ) considerably larger than @xmath29 . for polar caps closer to the pulsar s rotation axis",
    "the line of sight s curvature must be taken into account ( dyks & pierbattista 2015 ) . the bi - drifting pulsar j0815 + 09 has four distinct components which occupy approximately one third of the pulsar s duty cycle .",
    "this is a strong indication that @xmath28 is relatively small .",
    "the other known bi - drifter also has a wide profile ( about 25% of its duty cycle ) and is shown in paper i on polarisation grounds to be most probably of relatively low @xmath28 with a line of sight passing between the rotation and magnetic axes .    to reflect this more complex geometry we created a numerical simulation and experimented with the parameters of the elliptical beam , its inclination with respect to the fiducial plane , and the sightline parameters ( @xmath30 ) . in each pulsar",
    "we attempted to mimic the observed driftband separation ( @xmath26 ) , their repetition rates ( @xmath27 ) and the phase differences between the four components .",
    "the simulation adopted a range of self - imposed constraints .",
    "it was assumed that the inner and outer beams took the form of mathematical ellipses with identical eccentricity @xmath2 and tilt @xmath3 .",
    "each beam consisted of the same number ( @xmath31 ) of emission regions which moved around the ellipse in the same circulation time of @xmath32 and with unvarying size and intensity , represented as a 2-dimensional gaussian distribution .",
    "an arbitrary but fixed phase difference could be applied between the inner and outer beams .",
    "these constraints were driven by the need to maintain clarity in presentation and not intended to reflect any particular polar cap or emission physics .",
    "our purpose is to show schematically that the model can work in principle .",
    "the production of a realistic fit would require more degrees of freedom , by including , for example , randomly fluctuating ( non - drifting ) background emission and a specific intensity distribution for the beam .    in respect of the circulation ,",
    "two options were allowed : either the subbeams circulated the magnetic axis at a fixed angular rotation rate , which led to bunching when they were close to the magnetic pole , or they had to maintain a fixed spatial distance from one another throughout the circulation , which led to varying angular rotation rates at different points of their circulation .",
    "@l@l +    [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]",
    "the example of flare pulsars in the previous section suggests exploring the possibility that emission beams may sometimes change their alignments on an observable timescale . a number of pulsars have gradually shifting profiles which may be interpreted in this way .",
    "these shifts usually occur after or before a null or mode - change and are often accompanied by a change in the profile width .",
    "again , it is sometimes possible to interpret this as a change in altitude in the emission region , but we point out here that a small rotation in the orientation of a non - circular beams would have the same effect .",
    "examples are the extreme nulling ( 93% of the time ) pulsar j15025653 ( li 2012 , see their figs . 5 & 7 , which show a post - null adjustment and a widening profile ) , and a similar but rare effect in the weakly nulling ( 1.4% ) pulsar b0809 + 74 in which nulls are occasionally accompanied by subpulse mode - changing ( van leeuwen 2003 ) .",
    "the case of psr b081841 is particularly interesting ( bhattacharyya 2010 ) because the pulses following a null not only shift to later longitudes , they are also _ wider _ , which  as those authors point out  is counter to expectation if an emission altitude change alone were responsible .",
    "a further feature of this pulsar is that its drift patterns alter before and after nulls , something which might be expected if the carousel is changing orientation on a timescale comparable to that of the subpulse drift , so that with each pulse our line of sight would sample a different section of the carousel .",
    "a similar case is psr b003107 .",
    "this pulsar is known to possess three modes , each with a distinctive repetition rate @xmath27 ( huguenin 1970 ) .",
    "the profile widens as the drift rate increases ( wright & fowler 1981a ) , but each mode profile is centred at slightly later longitude ( vivekanand & joshi 1997 ) .",
    "again , this is not easily explained by changing emission altitude , so a slight but rapid change in orientation of the carousel is a possible explanation .",
    "furthermore , within each mode the separation ( @xmath26 ) of the drift bands can be seen to gradually widen ( see fig . 2 of vivekanand & joshi 1997 ) , which might be explained by a further slow adjustment of the orientation .",
    "a further example is psr b2319 + 60 , which has two clear drift modes both producing a profile of which the trailing component ( at 1415 mhz ) is far stronger than the leading component .",
    "these modes are frequently interrupted by an `` abnormal '' mode with irregular subpulse modulation , where now the leading half of the profile dominates .",
    "this profile behaviour is very similar to flare pulsar b1859 + 07 modelled in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ( fig . 2 of wright & fowler 1981b ) , suggesting a common explanation .    when a radius - to - frequency mapping ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2a ] ) is combined with a changing carousel orientation the resulting mode switch will change the spectral evolution of the profile components .",
    "the recently - investigated emission of the interesting single - peaked pulsar b0611 + 22 ( seymour 2014 , rajwade 2016 ) shows that the sudden mode changes are both frequency and pulse phase dependent .",
    "the pulsar has an asymmetric pa swing which apparently steepens on its trailing edge ( lyne & manchester 1988 , johnston 2008 ) . it may be possible to devise a model which sees the switch as resulting from a flip in an elliptical carousel whose fiducial plane is located on the trailing side of the profile .",
    "a general observational test of all these interpretations would be to see if the profile shift is accompanied by a shift in the longitude of the maximum gradient of the pa swing .",
    "if the profile shift is due to changing altitude , the pa swing will also shift due to the a / r effect . if the profile shift is due to a reorientation of the carousel at the same altitude , then the pa swing will not shift .      the emission of the complex pulsar b082634 ( biggs 1985 , gupta 2004 , esamdin 2005 , bhattacharrya 2008 , van leeuwen & timokhin 2012 ) extends throughout most of its pulse .",
    "it is possible to discern up to 13 distinct driftbands across the profile and the behaviour of this pulsar is undoubtedly strong evidence for the existence of polar cap carousels .",
    "its magnetic axis is almost certainly close to alignment with the rotation axis , so our line of sight gives us a head - on view of the polar cap .",
    "the widely - accepted view is that the pulsar possesses two nested circular carousels grazed by our circular line of sight traverse , and this gives rise to separate pulse regions .",
    "however , there is an underlying problem with this model .",
    "esamdin calculate the dimensions of the carousels based on the varying @xmath26 separations of the subpulses .",
    "this suggests an @xmath28 of just @xmath33 and @xmath13 of @xmath34 , giving @xmath35 .",
    "gupta ( 2004 ) base their model on the much larger ratio @xmath36 , which they derive from the pa swing maximum gradient observed by a number of authors ( biggs 1985 , lyne & manchester 1988 , rankin 1993 ) .",
    "this leads them to conclude that the model can only be made compatible with the nested carousel picture if the common centre of the carousels is located some degrees away from the magnetic pole , a feature not found in other double - cone examples ( psrs b1237 + 25 and b081841 ) .",
    "furthermore , the pulsar s polarisation pa swing is strongly displaced from from the centroid of the main pulse profile and this is not easy to account for .",
    "we suggest that these modelling difficulties stem from the assumption that the carousels are circular .",
    "while fitting the complex data of this pulsar is undoubtedly a difficult task , it may be worth looking at an alternative picture of an elliptical carousel ( possibly just one , rather than two ) , and perhaps not precisely aligned with the fiducial plane ( to explain the shift in pa swing ) . in the pulsar s weak mode ( esamdin 2012 ) the carousel s orientation may change . dropping the requirement for circularity would give greater freedom to the modelling effort and",
    "potentially make the pulsar s behaviour compatible with many of those described elsewhere in this paper .",
    "psr b0943 + 10 has been the subject of intense study over the last 20 years ( deshpande & rankin 2001 , suleymanova & rankin 2009 , backus 2011 , bilous 2014 ) . like psr b183904",
    ", it has a mode exhibiting highly regular drift which switches rapidly to and from a chaotic mode , and both pulsars are thought to have low inclinations between their magnetic and spin axes .",
    "the proportion of time spent in their chaotic modes is roughly comparable in the two pulsars ( @xmath37 of the time in the b - mode of psr b0943 + 10 and @xmath38 in the q - mode of psr b183904 ) and their spin periods @xmath39 are not dissimilar ( 1.1 s versus 1.9 s ) .",
    "however , their subpulse modulation timescales are very different : their @xmath27 values are respectively @xmath40 and @xmath41 , and while in psr b0943 + 10 the modes typically last several hours , in psr b183904 the mode durations are of the order of a few minutes .",
    "in psr b0943 + 10 it is known that the b to q change is accompanied by the appearance of a precursor component , a dramatic increase in thermal x - ray emission ( hermsen 2013 , mereghetti 2016 ) and chaotic subpulse behaviour .",
    "it has recently been found ( bilous 2014 ) that as the b - mode progresses the centroid of that mode s double - peak profile shifts markedly to later longitudes and the strength of the trailing peak diminishes . immediately following the change to the q - mode",
    "the subpulse behaviour becomes chaotic and the profile reverts to a single - peak profile whose centroid is at the original longitude of the b - mode centroid .    interpreting this result in geometric terms , it is possible that the b - mode beam of psr b0943 + 10 is elliptical in shape and initially symmetric about its fiducial plane . in the course of the b - mode , the elliptical beam with",
    "its highly ordered sub - beams gradually tilts until it reaches a limiting inclination .",
    "this triggers a rapid transformation to a beam which is chaotic but again symmetric about the fiducial plane . in support of this tilted model ( fig .  [ fig2a ] ) is the observed gradual change in the ratio of the intensities of the two components , and the fact that this ratio is different at different frequencies ( backus 2011 , bilous 2014 ) .",
    "note , however , that this picture is the reverse of what we suppose is happening in psr b183904 , where the chaotic mode would appear to tilt the ellipse even further , so without carefully identifying the fiducial plane we should not prescribe the tilt direction of psr b0943 + 10 .    during the b - mode sequences of psr b0943",
    "+ 10 the profile shift is accompanied by a gradual decrease in @xmath26 ( backus 2011 ) , which is plausibly argued to result from an equivalent exponential increase in the circulation time of the carousel s sub - beams from @xmath42 to @xmath43 and an increase in their average number from 18 to 20 . however , behind this argument is the assumption that the carousel is circular .",
    "it is possible that the observed reduction in @xmath26 may be the consequence of the gradual change in our sightline s intersection of the beam as the carousel tilts , so that no change in the number of sub - beams would be necessary  although the tilting in itself would not necessarily generate change in the circulation time .",
    "clearly , this line of argument remains vague until a detailed model is attempted , but could have interesting implications for interpreting the apparent evolution of pulsed x - ray emission during the b - mode ( mereghetti 2016 ) .",
    "explaining drifting subpulses by @xmath44 drift on the pulsar s polar cap was the groundbreaking idea of ruderman and sutherland in 1975 .",
    "in the the original model the polar cap and the drift were assumed perfectly circular as a reasonable first approximation .",
    "difficulties arose when the observed drift rates did not match predictions and the model was modified with plausible additional polar cap physics ( gil & sendyk 2000 , gil 2003 ) so that the surface potential differences were partly screened .",
    "the complex profiles of many pulsars were evidence that the emission beams took the form of single or double cones ( sometimes plus core emission ) , and these were assumed to be circular ( rankin 1990 , 1993 ) . to explain their presence ( and the separation of drifting subpulses ) it",
    "was argued , again reasonably , that the polar cap potential distribution caused sparks to develop at discrete distances from one another .",
    "however , none of this requires that the spark trajectories across the polar cap should be precisely circular .",
    "an important physical feature of the polar cap model is that multipoles should exist close to the surface in order to facilitate primary pair production , so surely these must cause irregularities in the spark trajectories .",
    "furthermore , it is not clear why the trajectories of the sparks should repeatedly execute the same closed paths .",
    "indeed , some have felt that the emission must be more `` patchy '' ( lyne & manchester 1988 ) .",
    "arbitrarily non - circular trajectories of sparks were already discussed by jones 2013 and paper i in the context of bi - drifting . in this paper",
    "we explore the concept of non - circular closed carousels further to explain a range of observed phenomena .",
    "this is a small step away from the rigidity of circular paths , but raises many questions . among these",
    "are the interpretation of the polarisation pa swing in an asymmetric beam and the identification of the fiducial plane .",
    "we have also suggested that changes in a pulsar s profile may indicate that the underlying trajectory on the polar cap has changed ( rather than emission becoming `` absorbed '' or shifted by a change in emission height ) .",
    "some authors have attempted to explain mode changing through physical changes on the polar cap ( zhang 1997 , jones 2013 , szary 2015 ) .",
    "however , it is still necessary to explain how carousels can have distinct repeating closed configurations , whether circular or not , defined solely by conditions on the polar cap .",
    "alternatively , we may abandon the idea that the observed single pulse sequences and profiles are exclusively driven by events on the polar cap , and investigate feedback from the magnetosphere ( possibly in the form of the return current ) .",
    "there is powerful evidence for magnetospheric connection from the observations of interpulses in psrs b182209 , b170219 and b105552 ( fowler & wright 1982 , gil 1994 , weltevrede 2007b , 2012 ) , where the opposing polar caps are clearly interacting with each other .",
    "wright ( 2003 ) has argued that the inner and outer cones may be formed by interactions between the polar cap and the extremes of the magnetosphere s outer gap .",
    "a number of authors have discussed mode - changing as a sudden switch in the magnetospheric state ( goodwin 2004 , timokhin 2010 , van leeuwen & timokhin 2012 , kalapotharakos 2012 , jones 2012 ) . in these calculations",
    "the separate states are broadly connected to polar cap conditions , but still lack predictive power for specific pulsars .",
    "recently , however , the mode change in the radio emission of psr b0943 + 10 has been found to coincide with a change in x - ray emission from that pulsar , and this suggests that mode - changing is indeed a pan - magnetospheric event ( hermsen 2013 , mereghetti 2016 ) .",
    "a more speculative approach might be to consider the presence of planetary / asteroidal bodies in orbits about the pulsar ( cordes & shannon 2008 , wahl 2016 ) .",
    "these might be expected to generate precise periodic changes in the pulsar emission , but so far most mode - changing and nulling seems at best `` quasi - periodic '' .",
    "interestingly , it can be shown that the polar cap footprints of circular orbits would take the form of ellipses with eccentricity @xmath45",
    ". however , the creation of a tilted ellipse would require the orbit not to lie in the neutron star s equatorial plane .",
    "bi - drifting is a rare phenomenon , only two clear examples being identified among the @xmath46 known pulsars with regular subpulse drift ( weltevrede et al 2006 , 2007 , basu 2016 ) .",
    "nevertheless , it has always been felt that the lack of explanation for this phenomenon has placed a significant question mark over the classical model for drifting subpulses presented by ruderman & sutherland ( 1975 ) and later developed by others ( gil 2003 ) .",
    "here we propose a simple geometric solution by relaxing the condition that the observed subpulses are following a circular path as they drift across the pulse window . by considering an elliptical beam with a degree of tilt with respect to the fiducial plane it is shown that bi - drifting can be accounted for , both in single and double emission cones .",
    "a necessary ( but not sufficient ) condition for bi - drifting is that the line of sight passes close to the magnetic pole ( low @xmath47 ) .",
    "assuming radio - to - frequency mapping , it may be found at low frequencies , but not at higher , in the same pulsar .",
    "we demonstrate on geometrical grounds that bi - drifting is statistically unlikely to be observed unless the tilt and eccentricity are extreme .    despite imposing the artificial constraint of requiring both inner and outer cones to be ellipses with common eccentricity and orientation of their major axes , it was possible to obtain plausible simulations for the bi - drifting pulsars b183904 and j0815 + 09 .",
    "both are relatively close to alignment and therefore the line of sight samples a curved path on the polar cap .",
    "these simulations schematically reproduce the observed drift rates and the phase differences from component to component . in reality , the carousel / beams need not be a formal mathematically - defined ellipse , but of more general convex oval form and perhaps not even centred on the magnetic pole .",
    "bi - drifting will only be observed when our line of sight by chance follows a very exceptional path .",
    "however , other lines of sight across tilted asymmetric beams , while producing the same drift direction in all components of the pulsar s profile , will result in observing different drift rates from component to component ( the same @xmath27 but different @xmath26 ) .",
    "we note that this effect is seen in many pulsars and usually manifests itself in differing component widths .",
    "an important expectation of the tilted model is that the fiducial plane will be shifted relative to the profile mid - point ( and this could be in either direction ) .",
    "any pulsar with a tilted carousel will exhibit this property whether or not it also shows bi - drifting , and the effect will be greater for pulsars whose beams are observed with large @xmath47 .",
    "in fact , the degree of shift with respect to the polarisation pa curve can be used to constrain the angle of tilt and eccentricity .",
    "if radius - to - frequency mapping is present , then in a tilted geometry the pulsar s separate components can be expected to have differing spectra and their respective separations from the fixed fiducial plane will also be frequency - dependent and asymmetric .",
    "many pulsars which appear to have `` missing '' components may be explained by some combination of these geometric effects .",
    "we take the model further by suggesting that a range of observed phenomena can be understood if we allow the carousel to vary its orientation on the polar cap .",
    "this re - orientation may take different manifestations : ( a ) the switch to a new mode , which is then sustained for many pulses ( psrs b183904 , b0943 + 10 and b0611 + 22 ) , ( b ) the `` flares '' of certain pulsars , where the switch is less rapid but the new state is only briefly maintained ( psrs b1859 + 07 and b0919 + 06 ) , ( c ) the gradual drift of a profile centroid ( the q - mode of psr b0943 + 10 ) and ( d ) apparent variations in @xmath27 close to a null ( psr b081841 ) .",
    "our model of an asymmetric carousel / beam , which began as a device for explaining bi - drifting , has been found to have wider applications and significance .",
    "it gives support to the original idea that polar cap carousels generated by @xmath0 drift can explain the common pulsar phenomenon of drifting subpulses .",
    "on the other hand it has raised questions as to the identity of the carousel : why does it have a closed convex form ?",
    "if this form can change ( in a mode - change , for example ) , why does it apparently flip between the same two forms ?",
    "is the carousel defined exclusively by conditions on the polar cap or is it at least partly imposed by feedback from the magnetosphere ?",
    "no easy answer to these questions here , but we hope to have suggested a novel way of looking at the problem which will stimulate further tests of the carousel model .",
