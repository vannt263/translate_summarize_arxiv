    "active galactic nuclei ( agns ) are thought to play an important role in the processes of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "the most important evidence is perhaps the remarkable correlations between host galaxy properties and the mass of the supermassive black holes ( e.g. , magorrian et al .",
    "1998 ; ferrarese & merritt 2000 ; gebhardt et al .",
    "2000 ; graham et al . 2001 ; kormendy et al .",
    "2009 ) observed in the past decade .",
    "many theoretical studies have also confirmed that agn feedback can affect the ambient environment effectively ( e.g. , silk & rees 1998 ; ciotti & ostriker 1997 , 2001 , 2007 ; ciotti , ostriker & proga 2009 ; king 2003 ; merloni et al .",
    "2004 ; springel , di matteo & hernquist 2005a ; sazonov et al . 2005 ; di matteo , springel , & hernquist 2005 ; hopkins et al . 2005 ; murray , quataert & tompson 2005 ; somerville et al . 2008 ; ostriker et al .",
    ".    the agn feedback can be in the forms of radiative ( e.g. , ciotti & ostriker 1997 , 2001 , 2007 , ciotti et al . 2009 ) or mechanical energy input ( e.g. , springel , di matteo & hernquist 2005b ; ostriker et al .",
    "2010 ) . in terms of the radiative feedback , both momentum feedback and energy feedback work , i.e.",
    ", the ambient gas could be accelerated by radiation pressure and heated by radiative heating .",
    "mechanical feedback is via wind / outflow .",
    "for example , in the context of hot accretion flow ( e.g. , advection - dominated accretion flow ) , yuan , xie & ostriker ( 2009 ; see also references therein ) studied the effect of global compton scattering , namely the scattering between the photons produced at the innermost region of the adaf and the gas at large radius .",
    "they found that when the luminosity is higher than @xmath3 , the heating is so strong that the flow will be heated to be above the virial temperature thus the accretion will be stopped .",
    "it is shown that this physical mechanism is able to explain the intermittent activity of some compact young radio sources ( yuan & li 2011 ) .",
    "provided the gas is moderately ionized and can interact with the uv continuum through many uv line transitions , radiation pressure force due to spectral lines ( i.e. , line force ) has been shown to be very efficient at producing winds from accretion disks .",
    "this can occur in the small scale of the innermost accretion flow ( e.g. , murray et al .",
    "1995 ; proga , stone & kallman 2000 , hereafter psk00 ) and much larger scale from @xmath4 pc to 10 pc ( proga 2007a ; proga , ostriker & kurosawa 2008 ; kurosawa & proga 2009 , hereafter kp09 ) .",
    "some highly blueshifted broad absorption line features seen in the uv and optical spectra of agn can be explained by this mechanism ( e.g. chartas , brandt & gallagher 2003 ; crenshaw , kraemer & george 2003 ; proga & kallman 2004 ; hamann et al .",
    ". however , not all agn outflows can be explained by line - driven mechanism because of , e.g. , the too - low luminosity , too - high ionization state , or both ( e.g. , chelouche & netzer 2005 ; kraemer et al .",
    "2006 ; see proga 2007b for a review ) .",
    "this has also been shown to be the case of black hole x - ray binaries which are believed to be the scaled - down version of agns ( e.g. , miller et al .",
    "2006 , 2008 ; luketic et al . 2010 ) .",
    "therefore , other mechanisms are required , such as thermal ( e.g. , begelman , de kool & sikora 1991 ) and , especially , magnetic driving ( e.g. , blandford & payne 1982 ; emmering , blandford & shlosman 1992 ) .",
    "most recently , based on global hd and mhd numerical simulations , yuan , bu & wu ( 2012 ; see also li , ostriker & sunyaev 2013 ) show that outflow must exist in hot accretion flows .",
    "moreover , yuan , bu & wu ( 2012 ) proposed a blandford & payne - like mechanism of producing winds .",
    "this mechanism should be quite universal since it is a result of magneto - rotational instability ( mri ) , which is widely believed to exist in accretion flows and is the mechanism of transporting the angular momentum .",
    "previous works on studying the production of mhd winds usually require the pre - existence of large scale poloidal field and treat the disk as the boundary condition .",
    "different from these works , yuan , bu & wu ( 2012 ) simulate the disk and outflow self - consistently and simultaneously , and the pre - existence of the large - scale poloidal magnetic field is not required .",
    "however , the simulation was done for hot accretion flows .",
    "thus the next step it remains to be probed explicitly whether it can be equally effective for thin disks ,",
    "although in principle it is expected to work .    among the above - mentioned line - driven works , kp09 studied the momentum and energy interaction between the radiation coming from the central agn and the accretion flow in the region between @xmath5 pc and @xmath6 pc .",
    "they focus on the line - driven outflow . compared with previous works ,",
    "the luminosity of the central agn is not fixed , but self - consistently determined by evaluating the mass accretion rate at the inner boundary .",
    "they found that outflow can be driven efficiently from the inflow .",
    "when the temperature of the gas at the outer boundary is high , @xmath7 , a strong correlation between the mass outflow rate ( @xmath8 ) at the outer boundary and the luminosity ( @xmath9 ) exists , @xmath10 with @xmath11 .",
    "when @xmath12 _ and _ when @xmath13 , the correlation becomes flatter , @xmath14 .",
    "another interesting result is , they found that when the density at the outer boundary is high , the accretion luminosity of the central agn can well exceed the eddington value .",
    "the super - eddington accretion mainly proceeds in the equatorial plane and is possible because the radiation flux from the disc is significantly reduced in the equatorial direction due to the geometrical foreshortening effect ( fukue 2000 ; watarai et al .",
    "2005 ) .    in almost all previous works on",
    "radiatively driven outflow including kp09 , they properly consider the forces due to electron scattering and uv line processes due to the `` first - order '' radiation coming from the central agns .",
    "however , the effect of the locally produced photons via scattering , the bremsstrahlung , and line radiation , are all neglected .",
    "thus when radiation is absorbed and then re - emitted the dynamical effects of the latter are ignored , essentially violating energy conservation . in principle",
    "these photons could play an important role .",
    "for example , they can produce an additional force in the vertical direction and thus puff the disk up .",
    "this may make the interaction between the radiation and the gas significantly stronger . in the present paper",
    "we want to investigate this `` re - radiation '' effect .",
    "another motivation to consider this effect in the present work is that we hope to address the so - called following `` sub - eddington '' problem .",
    "observations to a large sample of agns with 407 sources show that the distribution of their eddington ratio ( @xmath15 ) is well described by lognormal , with a peak at @xmath16 and a small dispersion of 0.3 dex ( kollmeier et al .",
    "in other words , almost all agns are radiating below @xmath17 .",
    "later steinhardt & elvis ( 2010 ) extended this study to a much larger sample consisting of 62185 quasars from the sloan digital sky survey and they reached the similar conclusion ( but see kelly & shen 2013 for a different opinion ) . on the other hand ,",
    "it has long been known from the black hole accretion theory that the rotating accretion flow can well radiate above @xmath17 .",
    "such an accretion flow is called slim disk or optically thick advection - dominated accretion flow ( abramowicz et al .",
    "this analytical result has later been confirmed by radiative hydrodynamical numerical simulations",
    "( ohsuga et al . 2005 ) .",
    "it has been argued that the galactic - scale fueling events are likely to have a broad mass distribution so this should not be the reason for the sub - eddington luminosity of agns .",
    "one possible way to solve this puzzle is that , the accretion rates are determined by the self - regulation of the radiative feedback . in other words ,",
    "the strong radiation from the inner accretion flow may drive a strong outflow thus reducing the accretion rate to below the eddington rate ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "this should not be effective in the innermost region close to the black hole , since the interaction between radiation and accretion flow has been properly considered in ohsuga et al .",
    "at larger scale , however , the simulations by kp09 still find super - eddington accretion even though the radiative feedback is included in their simulations . in this paper",
    ", we include the re - radiation effect to do the calculation again , to see whether the `` sub - eddington '' puzzle can be solved .",
    "it is vitally important that the effects of radiation feedback at the bondi radius be correctly included , since it is in this region that the rate of inflow is determined .    in this paper , following the approach of kp09 , we perform two - dimensional hydrodynamical ( hd ) time - dependent simulations of accretion flow irradiated by the angle dependent uv flux from an accretion disk and isotropic x - ray flux from a corona .",
    "the models include radiation forces due to electron scattering and line processes from both the first - order radiation and the re - radiation , and radiative cooling / heating .",
    "special attention is paid to the re - radiation effect . in  2 , we describe some basic aspects of our model , especially the radiative force due to re - radiation .",
    "the numerical simulation method and the initial and boundary conditions are also described in this section .",
    "the results of the simulations are given in  3 , and  4 provides some discussion . finally , ",
    "5 is devoted to a summary .",
    "the basic scenario of the model , together with most of the formula for calculating the radiative cooling and heating , are the same with those presented in kp09 ( see also psk00 ) .",
    "the readers are referred to that paper for details .",
    "however , we do make some changes compared to kp09 .",
    "in addition to the inclusion of reradiation force mentioned in  1 , we also improve , we believe , the calculation of the radiation force due to x - ray .",
    "our aim is to study the dynamics of the accretion flow between an inner radius @xmath19 and outer radius @xmath20 .",
    "in addition to the gravitational force , this gas will inevitably be irradiated by the radiation emitted from the central agn .",
    "the radiation will heat and push the gas by compton scattering and line absorption , if the gas is not fully ionized .",
    "the dynamics of the accretion flow is described by the following set of equations .",
    "@xmath21 @xmath22 @xmath23 where @xmath24 , and @xmath25 are the mass density , internal energy density , gas pressure , and velocity , respectively ; @xmath26 describes the radiative cooling and heating , simply as the net heating rate ( see psk00 ) ; @xmath27 is the gravitational acceleration of the central object ; @xmath28 ( see equation [ eq : frad ] ) is the total radiation force per unit mass .",
    "we adopt an adiabatic equation of state @xmath29 , and consider models with the adiabatic index @xmath30 , with , of course , allowance for heating and cooling via the @xmath31 term in equation ( 3 ) .",
    "the implementations of @xmath28 and @xmath26 are described as follows .",
    "the central agn is described by a super - massive black hole with mass @xmath32 surrounded by an accretion flow .",
    "the nature of the accretion flow in a luminous agn is still an unsolved problem .",
    "usually authors assume that it is described by a standard thin disk .",
    "however , a thin disk alone ca nt explain the origin of hard x - ray emission widely detected in agns . for simplicity , we assume that the accretion flow is a combination of a standard thin disk ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) plus a spherical corona .",
    "they are responsible for the optical / uv and x - ray emissions respectively .",
    "the radiation from the corona is assumed to be isotropic .    in the point - source approximation limit",
    ", the radiation flux from the central x - ray corona can be written as @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the fraction of the total luminosity ( @xmath35 ) in x - ray .",
    "we adopt @xmath36 throughout the paper .",
    "@xmath37 is the x - ray optical depth in the radial direction , @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the x - ray opacity .",
    "we assume that the attenuation is dominated by thomson scattering , i.e. , @xmath40",
    ". however , the scattering opacity must be over - estimated .",
    "this is because unlike true absorption , scattering merely re - directs the photons .",
    "the scattered x - ray photons must be replenished by photons scattered from other propagation lines .",
    "so another extreme is to take @xmath41 . in the present paper",
    ", we also test this case for comparison ( see  4.2 ) .",
    "the real opacity should be a certain value between these limits .",
    "the radiation from the standard thin disk @xmath42 .",
    "consequently , the disc radiation flux at a distance @xmath43 from the center can be written as @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the fraction of the total luminosity in the disc emission , @xmath46 is the uv optical depth and we assume @xmath47   term does not appear in equation ( [ eq : radiativeforce ] ) .",
    "we did some test calculations by including @xmath46 and found that the results change only slightly .",
    "but note that the gas can still get momentum and energy from the uv radiation although the radiation does not loss its momentum and energy . in this sense ,",
    "the conservation of momentum and energy is not guaranteed . ] .",
    "note that the `` @xmath48 '' assumption is potentially a strong assumption , since it suppresses the radiation force close the equatorial plane if we include re - radiation .",
    "we therefore have done several test simulations by replacing `` @xmath48 '' with `` @xmath49 '' . here",
    "@xmath50 is the scattering optical depth above the disk plane .",
    "we find that this effect does not influence our results significantly .    in our simulation , at each time step , the accretion luminosity will be calculated self - consistently based on the mass inflow rate at the inner boundary @xmath19 .",
    "it is given by @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the mass inflow rate at @xmath19 and at a given time @xmath53 , @xmath54 is the radiative efficiency .",
    "we adopt @xmath55 in this paper .",
    "following kp09 , the mass accretion rate at a given time @xmath53 is actually time - averaged over some time interval to reduce the fluctuation level .",
    "obviously , a time lag @xmath56 is expected between the change of this accretion rate to the disk and the change of the luminosity from the central agn @xmath35 . since in the present paper",
    "the accretion flow we consider has small angular momentum , a small disk with a radius of @xmath57 will be formed within the inner boundary of our simulation . in this case ,",
    "the time lag is roughly equal to the accretion timescale at the outer boundary of this small disk .",
    "if the small disk can be described by a standard thin disk , the lag time @xmath56 can be approximated as @xmath58 ; if it is a slim disk , the time lag should be @xmath59 . here",
    "@xmath60 is the viscosity parameter , and we set @xmath61 in this paper . the black hole mass is assumed to be constant .",
    "the value of @xmath56 is not important for our aim .",
    "one caveat here is that we assume the accretion rate onto the black hole is equal to the inflow rate at @xmath19 .",
    "this may not be true , however .",
    "almost all global numerical simulations to hot accretion flows show that the accretion rate should decrease with decreasing radius ( see yuan , wu & bu 2012 for a review ) . the reason is identified to be because of continuous mass loss in outflow produced by an mhd process similar to the blandford - payne mechanism ( yuan , bu & wu 2012 ) .",
    "this mechanism in principle also works in the case of a cold thin disk . actually , the initial global radiation mhd numerical simulations to thin disk by ohsuga et al .",
    "( 2009 ; see also ohsuga & mineshige 2011 ) do show significant outflow , although the exact mechanism remains to be probed . since the outflow in the context of a thin disk is still an open question , in the present paper",
    "we simply assume that the accretion rate is constant within @xmath19 and thus our computed luminosity is an upper bound on the true luminosity for given outer boundary conditions .",
    "the interaction between the radiation and the gas and the radiative processes we consider includes compton heating / cooling , x - ray photoionization and recombination , bremsstrahlung , and line cooling ( cf .",
    "psk00 ; see also blondin 1994 ) .",
    "the net cooling rate depends on the photoionization parameter @xmath62 and the characteristic temperature ( or radiation temperature ) of the radiation from the central agn ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "the gas photoionization state is determined by the photoionization parameter @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the number density of the local gas located at distance @xmath43 from the central agn , @xmath66 is the mean molecular weight and is fixed to be 1 .",
    "only x - ray radiation ionizes the gas .",
    "the sum of photoionization heating - recombination cooling rate ( @xmath67 ) and compton heating / cooling rate ( @xmath68 ) is @xmath69 with @xmath70 @xmath71 here @xmath72 ( sazonov et al . 2004 ) is the `` characteristic temperature '' of the x - ray radiation and it is @xmath73 times larger than the compton temperature ( refer to psk00 and proga 2007a ) . for a low - luminosity agn",
    ", @xmath63 will be much higher , @xmath74k ( yuan , xie & ostriker 2009 ) .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      +      we can see from table [ tab : model - summary ] that the significance of re - radiative effects depends on the outer boundary density @xmath75 . for example , when @xmath76 , the time - averaged luminosity decreases by a factor of 2 from model k7a to model r7a . the outflow rate at the outer boundary increases by a factor of about 7 from model k7a to model r7a .",
    "but when @xmath77 , the luminosity decreases by only @xmath78 , and the outflow rate increases by a factor of about 2.5 from model k5a to r5a .",
    "usually we find that the smaller the gas density at the outer boundary is , the weaker the re - radiation effect will be .",
    "this result is easy to understand .",
    "the thickness of the accretion disk is determined by the vertical component of the gravitational force , gradient of gas pressure , and the re - radiation force .",
    "the former two forces are proportional to density while the re - radiation force is proportional to the square of density ( refer to equation [ eq : reradiation ] ) .",
    "therefore , the disk will become thicker and more exposed to the irradiation from the central agn .",
    "in this section , taking models r5c , r6c , k6c , r7c and r8c as examples , we study the properties of the outflows .",
    "this is a sequence of increasing outer density and larger and lager rates of nominal inflow .",
    "these properties could be used to compare with observations .",
    "some main properties are listed in table [ tab : outflow ] . from the left",
    "to right columns , they are the mass flux , radial velocity , momentum flux , kinetic energy flux , and thermal energy flux of outflow at the outer boundary , respectively .    fig .",
    "[ fig : outflow ] shows some additional properties of outflow for models r7c ( the solid lines ) , r6c ( the dashed lines ) and k6c ( the dot - dashed lines ) . panels ( a ) and ( b ) show the angular distribution of mass fluxes and densities at @xmath20 , respectively . for model r7c , we can see that most of the outflow occurs close to the disk surface , in the range of @xmath79 . in the range of @xmath80",
    "it is the inflowing region and there is almost no outflow .",
    "panel ( c ) shows the radial profiles of the mass flux weighted radial velocities of outflows .",
    "the typical value of @xmath81 is @xmath82 .",
    "we can see that in most of the radial range , the radial velocity does not keep increasing as we naively expect because of the acceleration by the radiation force .",

    "the dot - dashed line ( model k6c ) sharply decreases at high - latitude ( small @xmath86 ) region .",
    "this is because some inflowing clumps often appear in that region which block the outflow ( cf .",

    "[ fig : contour7 ] , model k6c has similar structure ) . due to the same reason",
    ", @xmath87 of model k6c is very weak at high - latitude region ( see the dot - dashed lines in panel ( a ) ) . the black and blue lines in panel ( e ) show the radial profiles of the momentum fluxes of outflow ( @xmath88 ) and radiation from the central agn , respectively . in panel ( f ) , the solid and dotted lines respectively represent the radial profiles of the kinetic ( @xmath89 ) and thermal energy fluxes ( @xmath90 ) of outflows .",
    "their definitions are : @xmath91 @xmath92 @xmath93 we see that the momentum flux @xmath88 keeps increasing outwards , because more and more momentum of the radiation is transferred into the outflow gas .",
    "but we note that even at @xmath20 , the momentum flux of outflow is still several times smaller than that of radiation",
    ". it will be interesting to adopt a larger @xmath20 to see how the momentum flux of outflow can finally become closer to that of the radiation . from panel ( f )",
    "we see that most of the power of outflow is in the form of kinetic energy rather than thermal energy .",

    "the luminosity from the central agn is @xmath95 .",
    "this is about three orders of magnitude higher than the kinetic power of outflow .",
    "compared to the model of kp09 , the efficiency of transferring the radiation into kinetic power of outflow is one order of magnitude higher .",
    "but it is still much lower than @xmath1 , which is often assumed in cosmological simulations ( see discussions in kurosawa , proga & nagamine 2009 ) .",

    "the outflow velocity is also slightly higher .",
    "compared with model r6c , mass outflow rate of model r7c is higher most obviously at the moderate - latitude region at @xmath20 as mentioned earlier .",
    "this is due to the increase of density at that region ( see panel ( b ) ) .",
    "compared to model r6c , the luminosity of model r7c is higher hence the radiative force larger , so outflow stronger at small radii .    to better understand the overall energetics of the flow",
    ", we calculate the thermal energy of the input gas , the released gravitational energy , the energy absorbed from the center engine , the energy advected inside @xmath19 , the energy advected outside @xmath20 and the energy re - emitted out per unit time for model r7c .",

    "we can see that it becomes significantly larger when the re - radiation effect is included , @xmath101 .",
    "this implies that outflow rate is larger than the accretion rate .",
    "it is interesting to note that this is also the case for hot accretion flow ( yuan , wu & bu 2012 ) and found by li et al .",
    "( 2013 ) . of course , in that case",
    ", the mechanism of producing outflow is completely different .",

    "k , the bondi radius is @xmath103 .",
    "if we adopt higher @xmath2 but maintain the outer boundary unchanged , the bondi radius will be within our computational domain .",
    "this is an advantage since bondi radius is the place where the inflow rate is determined ( li , ostriker & sunyaev 2013 ) .",
    "we choose three @xmath2 values : @xmath104 k , @xmath105 k and @xmath106 k. the corresponding @xmath107 of the two latter cases is smaller than @xmath20 now .",
    "these models with new @xmath2 are listed in the end of table [ tab : model - summary ] ( models 26 - 31 ) .    the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig6 ] gives the _ emitted _ luminosity @xmath35 as a function of time for models r7c ( red line ; @xmath108 k ) , r7c - lt ( blue line ; @xmath109 k ) ; r7c - ht ( green line ; @xmath110 k ) , and r7c - ht2 ( black line ; @xmath111 k ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that for model r7c - ht2 which has the highest @xmath2 and smallest @xmath107 ( @xmath112 ) , the light curve oscillates regularly .",
    "similar behavior has been found before such as the feedback study in elliptical galaxies by novak , ostriker & ciotti ( 2011 ) .",
    "such an oscillation is caused by radiative feedback . for model r7c - ht2 , at some time the strong radiative heating heats the gas at a certain radius ( @xmath113 ) above the local virial temperature .",
    "then the accretion is partly suppressed since the gas becomes unbound .",
    "the accretion rate will thus begin to decrease , and subsequently the radiation from the central agn will decrease .",
    "this makes the radiative heating weaker and the temperature of the gas will decrease until below the virial value .",
    "so the gas supply then recovers and the accretion becomes active again .",
    "the timescale of such a cycle should be determined by the accretion timescale at @xmath113 . from the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig6 ] , we see that the timescale is @xmath114 .",
    "this is roughly the free - fall timescale at the outer boundary @xmath20 , which is also the accretion timescale for our low angular momentum accretion .",
    "we would like to emphasize that for such an oscillation behavior to occur , it is not necessary to have @xmath115 .",
    "in fact , yuan , xie & ostriker ( 2009 ) find the same oscillation result even when @xmath116 when they consider the global compton heating effect in hot accretion flows .",
    "the reason why the other three models do not have such oscillation is perhaps as follows .",
    "one is that the luminosity of the active phase from the other three models is smaller ( refer to fig .",
    "6 ) , thus the radiative heating is weaker .",
    "another reason is that the specific thermal energy of the gas in model r7c - ht2 is the highest among the four models at the same radius , therefore it is the easiest to be heated to be above the virial temperature .    in this context",
    "we would like to mention that the peak luminosity found in yuan , xie & ostriker ( 2009 ) is only @xmath117 , much smaller than that in model r7c - ht2 , which is super - eddington .",
    "one of the main reasons for the discrepancy is that the emitted spectrum from the innermost accretion flow is different . in the current work",
    "we assume a typical quasar spectrum , i.e. , @xmath118 and @xmath36 .",
    "such a spectrum is likely produced by a standard thin disk plus a corona .",
    "however , in yuan , xie & ostriker ( 2009 ) , the accretion flow is hot ( such as advection - dominated accretion flow ) thus the emitted spectrum is quite different .",
    "the radiation temperature of the spectrum in that case is @xmath119 and @xmath120 . in this case",
    "the compton heating will become much stronger ( e.g. , proga 2007a ) .",
    "in addition , the angular distribution of radiation is also different . in the case of hot accretion flow ,",
    "the radiation is nearly spherically symmetric .",
    "this again increases the heating close to the equatorial plane .",
    "we have run some test simulations and confirmed the above effects . and lastly , the effectiveness of compton heating is proportional to density of the flow .",
    "the specific angular momentum of the accretion flow in yuan et al .",
    "( 2009 ) is much larger than that in the current work .",
    "therefore , for the same density , the corresponding accretion rate and therefore the luminosity of yuan et al .",
    "( 2009 ) will be significantly smaller than in the current work .",
    "so far we have treated the thompson scattering opacity for the calculation of x - ray optical depth as if it were absorption .",
    "however , as we have mentioned above , this is likely an over - estimation ( we neglect x - ray absorption ) . in this section",
    ", we want to check the optical depth effect of the outward propagation of x - ray from the central source by assuming @xmath41 .",
    "but in the calculation of the force we still keep the first term in equation ( [ eq : scv ] ) for comparison purpose . the last few models labeled with ` x0 ' in table [ tab : model - summary ] are such models .",
    "[ fig : fig7 ] compares the logarithmic density and temperature contours with ( model r7c , top panels ) and without ( model r7c - x0 , bottom panels ) x - ray opacity .",
    "when @xmath41 , there will be no x - ray attenuation . in this case , the ionization parameter @xmath62 increases and x - ray heating is enhanced especially at large radii ( cf .",
    "equations [ eq : gx]-[eq : gcomp ] ) .",
    "we can see from the bottom - right panel of the figure that the gas temperature at low latitudes increases significantly .",
    "the gas density near the pole decreases greatly as the x - ray pushes the gas away .",
    "once the gas density becomes lower , the x - ray heating becomes less effective , hence the temperature decreases .",
    "note in table [ tab : model - summary ] the high values of @xmath100 ( cf . equation [ eq : eta_w ] ) in the models having @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "the outflow rates exceed the net accretion rates .",
    "the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig6 ] shows the light curves of various models which have been shown in the top panel of the same figure , except here @xmath41 . in the top panel , only the model with the highest @xmath2 ( model r7c - ht2 ) oscillates . but here with the exception of model r7c - ltx0 which has the lowest @xmath2 , the light curves of all other three models oscillate .",
    "the discrepancy is because of the enhanced x - ray heating . comparing model r7c - ht2 in the top panel and model r7c - ht2x0 in the bottom panel",
    ", we can see that the timescale of the variability becomes smaller .",
    "this indicates that the virial radius @xmath113 becomes smaller .",
    "another effect is that the amplitude of oscillation of model r7c - ht2x0 becomes smaller now .",
    "this is perhaps because a smaller fraction of the gas located at @xmath113 is heated to be unbound now .",
    "we now briefly discuss the observational implications of our results .",
    "the first issue is the origin of outflow observed in agns .",
    "they have been widely observed in the form of absorption lines in a variety of agns , including radio - quiet and radio loud , seyfert and quasars , low - luminosity or high - luminosity ones ( see crenshaw , kraemer & george 2003 for a review ) . especially , recently tombesi et al .",
    "( 2010 , 2011 , 2012 ) detected ultrafast outflows with velocities up to @xmath123 via fe k - shell absorption lines .",
    "they found that the ultrafast outflows are located in the interval @xmath124 from the black hole on average .",
    "the mass outflow rates are constrained between @xmath125 and the average lower and upper limits on the mechanical power are @xmath126 and @xmath127 , respectively .",
    "these features are difficulty to explain with our simulations . in our models ,",
    "the highest outflow velocity is about @xmath128 ( see panel ( d ) of fig . [",
    "fig : outflow ] ) , and the outflows starts from @xmath129 ( see fig . [",
    "fig : mfluxall7 ] ) , the mass outflow rates and outflow kinetic power at the outer boundary are @xmath130 and @xmath131 ( see table [ tab : outflow ] ) .",
    "however , based on these results we can not rule out the `` line - driven '' models as the origin of ultrafast outflow .",
    "this is because our simulations concentrate only on the large scale of the accretion flow , @xmath132 pc , the innermost accretion flow is not included and substantial radiative acceleration may occur within @xmath19 ( e.g. , psk00 ) .",
    "we did adopt different inner boundary @xmath19 and found that the properties of outflow , including the location of origin , remain largely unchanged .",
    "this is likely because the angular momentum of the accretion flow we consider is rather small so there is no real disk formed in our simulation domain . on the other hand ,",
    "the discrepancies between our simulation results and observations indicate that at least the ultrafast outflow must come from the innermost region of the accretion disk .",
    "in this paper we study the dynamics of accretion flow within @xmath133 pc from the central super - massive black hole irradiated by the central agn .",
    "we focus on the outflow driven by the radiation via the compton scattering and the line force .",
    "compared to the previous works , the main improvement is that we include the re - radiation force , which is the additional force produced by the scattered photons and the reprocessed photons .",
    "we find that the results change significantly .",
    "the accretion flow now becomes thicker and is thus more exposed to the radiation from the central source .",
    "consequently , the outflow rate measured at the outer boundary increases by about one order of magnitude .",
    "we find that the correlation between the eddington ratio @xmath134 and the outflow rate @xmath135 originally found in previous works still exists .",
    "the properties of the outflows are calculated and compared to observations , such as the ratio of the outflow rate and the accretion rate .",
    "we find that some observed outflows can not be explained by this model , but note that the inferred high ratios of @xmath136 occur naturally in our high eddington ratio models .",
    "when the density of the gas at the outer boundary is sufficiently high , we still find super - eddington accretion , even though we include the re - radiation effect and the outflow becomes stronger .",
    "we also investigate the effect of different temperatures at the outer boundary ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "we find that when @xmath2 is large ( @xmath137 k ) , the emitted luminosity from the accretion flow oscillates significantly because of the radiative heating feedback .",
    "one of the main aims of the present research is the sub - eddington puzzle .",
    "observations show that most agns are sub - eddington , while on the other hand both analytical theory and numerical simulations of accretion flows have clearly shown that super - eddington accretion can exist . in this paper",
    ", we hope to investigate whether the feedback at larger scale can solve the puzzle , especially after the re - radiation effect is taken into account .",
    "unfortunately , we find that the super - eddington accretion still exists ( refer to fig . [",
    "fig : fig6 ] ) but at a reduced rate .",
    "there are some caveats in our study .",
    "these issues can be improved in the future , which may be helpful to solve the sub - eddington puzzle .",
    "the first one is that we need to consider the probable large angular momentum of the accretion flow .",
    "when the angular momentum is large , we must include viscosity and a disk will be formed . in this case , such a disk itself will emit strong radiation , which may help to drive an outflow .",
    "moreover , when the angular momentum is large , a strong outflow will be produced intrinsically by other mechanisms ( yuan , bu & wu 2012 ; bu et al .",
    "for example , outflow can be produced by buoyancy or magnetocentrifugal force in a hydrodynamical or magnetodynamical accretion flow , respectively ( yuan , bu & wu 2012 ; see also bai & stone 2013 ) .",
    "the second caveat is that in the current simulations , we only consider the radiation from within @xmath19 and we do not investigate the dynamics within @xmath19 .",
    "however , strong outflows have been shown to exist from the innermost accretion flow and they will interchange their momentum and energy with the gas .",
    "so the feedback of the outflow should also be included ( e.g. , ostriker et al .",
    "2010 ; novak et al . 2011",
    "; choi et al . 2012 ) .",
    "all the above - mentioned factors are expected to be able to make the outflow stronger and thus the inflow rate at @xmath19 and luminosity smaller .",
    "in addition , a simplified approach is adopted when we deal with the interaction between the radiation , from both the central force and re - radiation , and the gas . obviously a proper radiation transfer calculation is desired . and",
    "lastly , the opacity due to dust can also potentially greatly enhance the outflow ( e.g. , novak et al . 2012 ; roth et al .",
    "2012 ; faucher - gigure , quataert & hopkins 2013 ) .",
    "the values of @xmath138 found in our high inflow models are consistent with recent assessments of moe et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , dunn et al .",
    "( 2010 ) and the references therein that winds carry out more mass in bright quasars than is being accreted on the central black holes .",
