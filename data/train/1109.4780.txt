    "in the standard model ( sm ) , @xmath0 violation in @xmath11 meson decays originates from an irreducible complex phase in the @xmath12 cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) mixing matrix  @xcite .",
    "the unitarity condition of the ckm matrix gives rise to a relation @xmath13 , which can be represented by a triangle in the complex plane , known as the unitarity triangle ( ut ) .",
    "the main objective of the @xmath1-factories is to test the sm picture of the origin of @xmath0 violation by measuring the angles ( denoted by @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 ) , @xmath17 and @xmath18 corresponding to @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 . ] and sides of the ut using different @xmath1 decays . in this proceeding , we report the recent measurements of time - dependent @xmath0 asymmetries in @xmath19 charmonium @xmath20 decays .",
    "these proceed via @xmath21 tree diagram and provide a precise measurement of the angle @xmath14 ( @xmath22 ) . for such decays the interference between the tree amplitude and the amplitude from @xmath23 mixing is dominated by the single phase @xmath14 .",
    "the other modes which allows measurements of @xmath14 are @xmath24 transitions like @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "these modes are dominated by tree diagrams , but loops may contribute .",
    "so , sensitivity to new physics ( np ) increases in these decays .",
    "on the other hand , rare radiative @xmath1 meson decays are flavor changing neutral currents , forbidden at tree level in the sm but allowed through electroweak loop processes .",
    "the loop can be mediated by non - sm particles ( for example , charged higgs or susy particles ) and therefore is sensitive to np .",
    "the emitted photons in @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) decays are predominantly left - handed ( right - handed ) in the sm , and hence the time - dependent @xmath0 asymmetry is suppressed by the quark mass ratio ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "the expected mixing - induced @xmath0 asymmetry parameter ( @xmath30 ) is @xmath31 and the direct @xmath0 asymmetry parameter ( @xmath32 ) is @xmath33  @xcite . in several extensions of the sm , both photon helicities can contribute to the decay .",
    "therefore , any significantly larger @xmath0 asymmetry would be clear evidence for np .",
    "the belle detector is a large - solid - angle magnetic spectrometer that consists of a silicon vertex detector ( svd ) , a 50-layer central drift chamber ( cdc ) , an array of aerogel threshold cherenkov counters ( acc ) , a barrel - like arrangement of time - of - flight scintillation counters ( tof ) , and an electromagnetic calorimeter ( ecl ) comprised of csi(tl ) crystals located inside a superconducting solenoid coil that provides a 1.5  t magnetic field .",
    "an iron flux - return located outside the coil is instrumented to detect @xmath34 mesons and to identify muons ( klm ) . the detector is described in detail elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "two different inner detector configurations were used . for the first sample of @xmath35 @xmath3 pairs ,",
    "a 2.0 cm radius beampipe and a 3-layer silicon vertex detector ( svd1 ) were used ; for the latter samples , a 1.5 cm radius beampipe , a 4-layer silicon detector ( svd2 ) , and a small - cell inner drift chamber were used .",
    "belle stopped operation in june 2010 and collected more than 710 @xmath36 of data .",
    "this corresponds to a total of @xmath37 @xmath38 pairs at @xmath4 resonance . out of these nearly @xmath39 of the data sample",
    "is reprocessed with a new tracking algorithm .",
    "in the @xmath1 meson system , the @xmath0 violating asymmetry lies in the time - dependent decay rates of the @xmath11 and @xmath40 decays to a common @xmath0-eigenstate ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "the asymmetry can be written as : @xmath42 -   \\gamma[b^0(t)\\to f_{cp } ] }                                  { \\gamma[\\overline{b}{}^0(t)\\to f_{cp } ] +   \\gamma[b^0(t)\\to f_{cp}]}\\\\                         & = & { \\cal s } \\sin ( \\delta m_d t ) + { \\cal a } \\cos(\\delta m_d t)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath43    here @xmath44 is the decay rate of a @xmath45 meson decays to @xmath41 at a proper time @xmath46 after the production , @xmath47 is the mass difference between the two neutral @xmath1 mass eigenstates , @xmath48 is a complex parameter depending on the @xmath23 mixing as well as the decay amplitudes of the @xmath1 meson decays to the @xmath0 eigenstate .",

    "the vertex position of the @xmath41 decay is reconstructed using charged tracks ( for example , lepton tracks from @xmath65 in @xmath66 decays ) and that of the @xmath53 decay from well - reconstructed tracks that are not assigned to @xmath41  @xcite the @xmath67 is approximately 200 @xmath68 m in belle and 250 @xmath68 m in babar .",

    "the data are divided into seven @xmath72 intervals .",

    "the @xmath19 charmonium @xmath20 decays that are mediated by @xmath74 decays are known as the golden modes for @xmath0 violation measurements .",
    "they have clean experimental signatures : many accessible modes with relatively large branching fractions @xmath75 , low experimental background levels and high reconstruction efficiencies .",
    "these modes are dominated by a color - suppressed @xmath76 tree diagram and the dominant penguin diagram has the same weak phase .",
