    "<S> the magnetic susceptibility of the optimally doped pr@xmath0lace@xmath1cuo@xmath2 in the superconducting state is calculated using the @xmath3-@xmath4 model of cu - o planes , mori s projection operator technique and the dispersion of electron bands derived from photoemission experiments . </S>",
    "<S> the electron band folding across the antiferromagnetic brillouin zone border , which is inherent in the crystal , leads to a commensurate low - frequency response . </S>",
    "<S> the same band folding causes the appearance of a supplementary spin - excitation branch . </S>",
    "<S> the coexistence of the two spin - excitation branches explains two maxima observed in the frequency dependence of the susceptibility . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated momentum and frequency dependencies are close to experimental observations . </S>",
    "<S> similarities and differences in the magnetic responses of electron- and hole - doped cuprates are discussed . </S>"
