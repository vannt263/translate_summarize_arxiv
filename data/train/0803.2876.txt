    "until recently , no satisfactory mechanism was known for generating either majorana neutrino masses ( for a see - saw mechanism ) or small dirac masses within the type iia string theory context .",
    "recent work @xcite has shown that majorana masses can be generated non - perturbatively by d - brane instantons . in this letter",
    "we show that , as an equally plausible alternative , d - brane instantons may instead generate small dirac neutrino masses at the observed scale without fine - tuning .    in the past year",
    "there have been intriguing insights into d - brane instantons @xcite which can generate pertubatively absent couplings of genuinely string theoretic origin with apparently no field theory analogs .",
    "( for reviews on the subject , see @xcite,@xcite . ) in type ii string compactifications with d - branes the specific superpotential couplings are typically forbidden due to perturbatively conserved `` anomalous '' @xmath2 factors .",
    "however , under specific conditions , that ensure the correct number of d - instanton fermionic zero modes , these couplings can be generated with a strength that is exponentially suppressed by the d - instanton action .",
    "the mechanism was originally proposed for generating majorana neutrino masses , the @xmath3-parameter and @xmath4 violating terms @xcite , as well as the study of supersymmetry breaking effects @xcite .",
    "further efforts in these directions focused on rational conformal field theory searches for global models with non - perturbatively realised majorana masses @xcite , an explicit calculation of non - perturbative majorana neutrino couplings within local orbifold constructions @xcite and further studies of phenomenological implications for neutrino physics @xcite , as well as spelling out conditions for non - perturbatively induced yukawa couplings @xmath5 within su(5 ) grand unified models ( gut s ) @xcite .",
    "there have also been further analyses of non - perturbative supersymmetry breaking effects @xcite .",
    "while local realisations of models where this d - instanton mechanism were found @xcite , an important challenge was in the construction of globally consistent semi - realistic string vacua which realize such non - perturbative effects ( for efforts within semi - realistic gepner models , see @xcite ) .",
    "the main difficulty seems to have been due to the specific type iia frameworks , where conformal field theory techniques are applicable .",
    "on the other hand , the t - dual type i framework with magnetized d - branes , described by stable holomorphic bundles on compact calabi yau spaces , is amenable to algebraic geometry techniques .",
    "there , the first classes of semi - realistic globally consistent string vacua , where hierarchical couplings are realised by d1-brane instantons , were constructed @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to present a new mechanism for small neutrino masses .",
    "specifically , we present d - brane vacua with a standard model sector where perturbatively absent dirac neutrino masses are generated non - perturbatively by d - instantons at a desired mass scale without fine - tuning , while at the same time ensuring the absence of non - perturbatively generated majorana neutrino masses .",
    "this string mechanism should be contrasted with that for majorana masses @xcite . both types of masses can be generated by d - instantons that satisfy specific conditions and are thus restricted to specific string vacuum solutions . however , unlike d - instanton generated dirac neutrino masses , the desired mass scale for majorana neutrino masses can be achieved only after some fine - tuning of the volumes of the cycles wrapped by d - instantons .    for the sake of concreteness we focus on the type iia framework with intersecting d6-branes , though the t - dual formulation of conditions in the type i framework with magnetized d9-branes on calabi - yau spaces",
    "can also be described employing techniques developed in @xcite . in these cases the d - instantons can generate exponentially suppressed dirac neutrino masses at experimentally relevant mass scales , while the majorana masses are not generated .",
    "thus the proposal provides a non - perturbative string realisation of the origin of small dirac neutrino masses in the absence of a see - saw mechanism  .    as a concrete application",
    "we construct a class of local models , based on the @xmath1 toroidal orientifold , which explicitly realise this scenario . within this local construction",
    "we do not address the moduli stabilization issue , a difficult problem in string theory .",
    "the back - reaction of supergravity fluxes and/or strong gauge dynamics , responsible to for moduli stabilization , can also affect quantitative results for the proposed non - perturbative couplings ( as well as global consistency constraints ) ; however , this is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "the proposal is attractive since the classical instanton action enters the coupling at the exponentially suppressed level , proportional to the inverse string coupling and the volume of the cycles wrapped by the d - brane instanton .",
    "these couplings are thus generically extremely small , and thus generate tiny dirac neutrino masses without any additional tuning of the volume of the cycles .",
    "this mechanism should be contrasted with the case of d - instanton generated majorana neutrino masses @xcite and some other non - perturbatively generated couplings , such as the @xmath6 yukawa coupling of the su(5 ) gut @xcite , where some fine - tuning of the volumes of the cycles wrapped by d - instantons is needed in order to obtain the couplings in the desired regime , e.g. for majorana masses in @xmath7 gev range .",
    "the specific focus are `` semi - realistic '' constructions within the type iia string theory framework with intersecting d6-branes wrapping three - cycles in the internal space ( for reviews , see @xcite . ) .",
    "concrete realizations will be based on grand unified su(5 ) models @xcite , with chiral families of quarks and leptons .",
    "however , again , we do not address the moduli stabilization .",
    "specifically , the string vacuum constructions should have the property that the yukawa couplings responsible for dirac neutrino masses are absent perturbatively due to global @xmath2 selection rules . focusing on type iia theory , under suitable circumstances euclidean d2-branes ( e2-instantons ) wrapping three cycles in the internal space",
    "can break these global @xmath2 symmetries to certain discrete subgroups and generate @xmath2 violating interactions , as spelled out in @xcite .",
    "the type iia framework allows for a geometric formulation of the zero mode conditions in the presence of e2-instantons wrapping rigid three - cycles , and thus an explicit geometric interpretation of these non - perturbative string effects .",
    "namely , the intersection numbers of the of instanton and d - brane cycles , which specify the number of charged fermionic zero modes , are topological numbers . however , in order to illustrate the effects explicitly , we write expressions for these intersection numbers for a concrete local construction , based the @xmath1 toroidal orientifold , with hodge numbers @xmath8 .",
    "we employ the notation of @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , to which we refer for details of the geometry and the construction of rigid cycles .",
    "the orbifold group is generated by @xmath9 and @xmath10 acting as reflections in the first and last two tori , respectively .",
    "the @xmath11-plane parallel to the instanton is an @xmath12 plane , whereas the three others are @xmath13 planes .",
    "the proposed framework requires three stacks @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 of d6-branes giving rise to a @xmath17 gauge symmetry .",
    "the @xmath18 splits into @xmath19 , where the anomalous @xmath20 gauge boson gets massive via the generalized green - schwarz mechanism and @xmath20 appears as a global symmetry in the effective action .",
    "the matter transforming as @xmath21 under @xmath22 arises at intersections of stack @xmath14 with its image @xmath23 ; the matter fields transforming as @xmath24 as well as higgs fields @xmath25 and @xmath26 are located at intersections of stack @xmath14 with @xmath15 and @xmath27 or @xmath16 and @xmath28 . the abelian gauge group factors @xmath29 and @xmath30 also acquires massive gauge bosons due to the generalized green - schwarz mechanism .",
    "the key input in the construction of the local model is summarized in tables [ wn ] and [ sp ] .",
    "table [ wn ] lists the wrapping numbers of the d6-branes wrapping bulk three - cycles @xmath31 , the building blocks of the local gut models , and the wrapping numbers of the rigid three - cycle @xmath32 of the e2-instanton with the required zero mode structure .",
    ".wrapping numbers of d6-branes wrapping bulk three - cycles and the wrapping numbers of the e2-instanton wrapping a rigid , orientifold action invariant , three - cycle on the @xmath1 toroidal orientifold .",
    "the wrapping numbers @xmath33 and @xmath34 are positive integers , co - prime with 2 and @xmath35 integer , respectively .",
    "the simplest choice is @xmath36",
    ". another interesting ( non - abelian anomaly free ) case is @xmath37 .",
    "the model is supersymmetric for the choice @xmath38 , @xmath39 of the complex structure toroidal moduli @xmath40 of the @xmath41 two - torus . [ wn ]",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      the intersection numbers in the respective @xmath44 and @xmath45 sectors are : @xmath46 where we choose a convention that the chiral superfields in the @xmath47 representation correspond to @xmath48 .",
    "the symmetric and anti - symmetric representations arise from the @xmath49 sector : @xmath50 where @xmath51 as shown in @xcite , the background of this model exhibits one class of so - called rigid @xmath52 instantons . for completeness , in the conventions of @xcite ,",
    "we give the full expression for the rigid three - cycle wrapped by the e2-instanton _ & = & ^b_-_i , j(13)(12 ) ^_ij , m + & & + _ j , k(12)(12 ) ^_jk , n+ _",

    "( for further details see @xcite . )",
    "the intersection number in the @xmath62 specifies the number of chiral fermionic modes and is of the form : @xmath63 again the convention @xmath64 corresponds to chiral fermionic zero modes in the @xmath65 representation .",
    "note that since d6-branes wrap ( non - rigid ) bulk three - cycles , the intersection number in the @xmath62 sector does not depend on fractional twisted three - cycles of the instanton .",
    "the supersymmetry conditions are ensured by requiring that the three - cycles are special lagrangians with respect to the same holomorphic three - form . in the case of toroidal compactification",
    "these take the form : @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the complex structure modulus for the @xmath41 two - torus .    at the intersection of the @xmath29 and @xmath30 d6-branes",
    "the chiral matter corresponds to the right handed neutrinos @xmath68 .",
    "we insist that there only exist chiral states with such @xmath29 and @xmath30 charges that they can not couple perturbatively in yukawa couplings @xmath69 , i.e. , @xmath2 charges are perturbatively violated for such couplings , and thus dirac masses corresponding to them are not present at this stage .",
    "in addition we want to ensure that the d - instanton zero modes induce the dirac neutrino masses , while the majorana neutrino masses are absent .",
    "these constraints can be ensured by the following specific signs for the intersection numbers : @xmath70 resulting in the following left - handed chiral superfield representations : @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 .",
    "therefore , @xmath74 ( or any singlets in @xmath75 and @xmath76 sectors with respective charges @xmath77 and @xmath78 ) can not couple perturbatively via yukawa couplings to @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "we also assume that the states in the n=2 sector of @xmath44 , and @xmath81 system are massive by wrapping the respective d - branes on parallel one - cycles that do not coincide .",
    "the wrapping numbers presented in the table i comply with the above intersection number conditions and have the following specific values : @xmath82 as are also listed in terms of the multiplicity of the states in the spectrum in table [ sp ] .    to generate the desired yukawa couplings at the non - perturbative level the instanton has to have a spectrum of zero modes ensured by the intersection numbers : @xmath83 note that for the non - chiral intersection with @xmath84 , however , the n=2 @xmath85 sector has one vector pair of massless modes . to ensure that the n=2 @xmath62 sector does not have massless modes , the parallel one - cycles on the third two - torus for the @xmath86-brane and the e2-instanton do not coincide .",
    "we therefore ensure the correct structure of the zero modes , i.e. , two zero modes @xmath87 in the representation @xmath88 and one vector pair @xmath89 , @xmath90 .",
    "importantly , d - instanton zero modes ( [ ei ] ) _ can not generate majorana masses _ for @xmath74 .",
    "we have also checked that in the concrete set - up there is no other @xmath91-instanton that could induce majorana masses .",
    "such an instanton would have to wrap a rigid three - cycle with the intersection numbers : @xmath92 the first three constraints require @xmath93 , however the last two constraints can not be satisfied for any wrapping numbers @xmath94 , corresponding to a rigid , supersymmetric three - cycle .    note that specific conditions on the intersection numbers between d - branes ( [ di ] ) and the intersection numbers of the d - instanton with d - branes ( [ ei ] ) apply to a general type iia set - up and ensure a mechanism that generates perturbatively absent dirac neutrino masses due to e2-instantons , which can not generate majorana masses for @xmath68 s .",
    "the contribution to the superpotential arises from the string amplitudes as shown in figure [ disk ] .",
    "these four fermionic zero modes @xmath95 can be saturated via the two disk diagrams , thereby generating superpotential contributions to the yukawa couplings @xmath96 of the type : @xmath97      where @xmath99 for the specific local construction .",
    "the numerical factor , @xmath100 , is expected to be of order 1 .",
    "a more detailed conformal field theory calculation of the three - point and four - point disc amplitudes @xcite emerging from the geometric local set up in figure [ disk ] could in principle generate additional world - sheet instanton supression terms , as were explicitly calculated for the d - instanton induced majorana masses in @xcite . in addition , further summation over @xmath1 images of the e - instanton can quantitatively affect @xmath100 , as again was addressed in @xcite .    taking @xmath101 , @xmath102 and a vev of the higgs doublet @xmath103 gev yields neutrino dirac masses in the range @xmath104 which is a reasonable regime for the allowed range for the neutrino masses .",
    "note , however , that the case @xmath105 would require too small a value @xmath106 to bring @xmath107 to the @xmath108 ev regime .    in conclusion , we have presented specific conditions for a concrete proposal , explicitly implemented within a local supersymmetric @xmath0 construction with intersecting d6-branes , where string d - instantons ( e2-instantons ) can generate perturbatively absent dirac neutrino masses while majorana masses remain absent .",
    "the exponentially suppressed coupling can be engineered ( without fine - tuning ) to yield dirac neutrino masses in the observed regime @xmath109 ev .",
    "while the concrete set - up was in the context of type iia string theory , realizations in the t - dual picture , namely the type i framework , may be amenable to constructions of global models on compact calabi - yau spaces where string d - instanton couplings are realized within globally consistent models ,  la @xcite .",
