    "this result has profound applications in time - frequency analysis @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors provide a general procedure for constructing a fundamental domain for any given pair of lattices of the same volume . however , it is often the case that the fundamental domains obtained in @xcite are disconnected , unbounded and difficult to describe .",
    "it is therefore natural to ask if it is possible to characterize pairs of lattices which admit ` simple ' common fundamental domains .",

    "although the investigation of good pairs of lattices is an interesting problem on its own right , it is also worth noting that common fundamental domains for pairs of lattices which are bounded and star - shaped are of central importance in the construction of smooth frames which are compactly supported @xcite .",
