    "spatiotemporal patterns in the transverse direction of an optical field have now been widely studied theoretically and experimentally @xcite .",
    "studies of optical pattern formation share a number of aspects and techniques with general investigations of pattern formation in other physical systems @xcite , but they also have specific features such as the role of light diffraction and the vectorial degree of freedom associated with the polarization of the light electric field amplitude . a prototype simple model which has been very useful for the understanding of pattern formation in nonlinear optical cavities is a mean field model describing a kerr medium in a cavity with flat mirrors and driven by a coherent plane - wave field@xcite .",
    "this model was extended to take into account the polarization degrees of freedom in @xcite .",
    "some of the basic polarization mechanisms of pattern formation in alkali vapors or other non - linear materials can be understood in terms of this simple model despite the fact that the model is too simple to give a complete description of alkali vapors .",
    "furthermore , the relative simplicity of the model in @xcite makes it worthwhile to study it in depth as a general prototype model for the basic understanding of vectorial patterns .",
    "a first study was undertaken in @xcite for the case of linearly polarized driving field and the positive cavity detuning . a more detailed study in which the case of elliptically polarized driving field is also considered has been presented recently in reference @xcite .",
    "cavityless kerr media can be used as an optical phase conjugation mirror .",
    "an ideal phase conjugate mirror should generate an output field such that the amplitude of the field , its propagation vector and its polarization unit vector are the complex conjugates of the corresponding magnitudes in the input field .",
    "the first two properties can be achieved easily using , for example , four - wave mixing processes @xcite .",
    "usually the third property can be obtained only when the pump waves are circularly polarized and counterrotating . in order to find a system that verifies the three properties ( vector phase conjugation ) for an arbitrarily polarized input field it is required to make use of the special tensor properties of two - photon atomic transitions in degenerate four - wave mixing processes @xcite . more precisely , vector phase conjugation can be achieved if the two - levels coupled by the two - photon transition have equal angular momenta @xmath1 with @xmath2 or @xmath3 . in this situation",
    "the @xmath4 component of the susceptibility tensor vanishes . intuitively , as @xmath5 , the atom do not change its angular momentum either by absorbing two pump photons or by emitting a probe and a conjugate photon so that the conjugate photon must be emitted with angular momentum equal and opposite to that of the probe photon .",
    "a detailed calculation @xcite shows that indeed this is true for the cases indicated before .",
    "we should stress that the polarization properties of two - photon - resonant degenerate four - wave mixing processes are different from those of most other degenerate four - wave mixing processes .",
    "in the two - photon case the underlying physical mechanism is scattering of the probe field from a spatially uniform temporally varying coherence induced by the two pump waves whereas in the other cases is scattering from a spatially varying refractive - index distribution induced by the interference between the pump and the prove beams .",
    "experimentally , vector phase conjugation was first observed using the @xmath6 two - photon transition in sodium vapor @xcite .    here we will show that for a ring cavity filled with a nonlinear kerr medium close to a two - photon - resonance ( so that @xmath7 ) and illuminated with linearly polarized input and with negative detuning a new interesting situation appears : a codimension two bifurcation in which two stationary turing - like instabilities occur simultaneously .",
    "the first instability , if the other were not present , would originate a hexagonal pattern which is polarized linearly in the same direction as the input field .",
    "the second instability is of pure vectorial origin and if the first instability were not present it would give rise to an elliptically polarized stripe pattern . here",
    "we study the interplay between the two instabilities .",
    "the codimension two bifurcation appears here in a natural way associated to the two - photon - resonant four - wave mixing nonlinearities rather that as the result of the fine tuning of two system parameters as is usually the case .",
    "the intensity of the pump field is the single control parameter to be tuned to change the distance to the instabilities .",
    "furthermore , the system still have another easily accessible control parameter , the detuning , which allows the system to form different patterns while remaining at the same distance to the codimension two instability threshold .",
    "in particular we show how the detuning can be used as a tuning parameter to select the pattern .",

    "as @xmath197 and @xmath198 , the structure observed in @xmath195 is formed by symmetric modes with wavevectors in the ring @xmath199 whereas the structure in @xmath196 is composed of antisymmetric modes with wavevectors @xmath200 .",
    "the overall structure is built on an arbitrary number of symmetric and antisymmetric modes .",
    "the weakly nonlinear analysis predicted that there were no stationary mixed patterns and , in fact , the pattern shown in fig .",
    "[ t05 ] from numerical integration is not static , it evolves dynamically in a slow time scale .    for @xmath201 , although resonance is possible , no mixed mode pattern is numerically found , as predicted analytically . as in the previous case ,",
    "a disordered structure is obtained and no steady pattern is reached even for long time integrations .",
    "rings of radius @xmath71 and @xmath72 in the far fields of the linearly polarized components @xmath0 and @xmath68 respectively , show that there is not a selection process of critical wave vectors , all directions become unstable . in fig .",

    "a roll pattern is seen in the @xmath0 linearly polarized component with wave number @xmath71 , while a rectangular pattern appears in the @xmath68 component with wave number @xmath72 . as for the range of existence of mixed mode patterns , we have found numerically the existence this patterns also for @xmath205 but not for @xmath206 .    for @xmath207",
    "we find a steady pattern in which the symmetric modes are damped and a stripe pattern with wave number @xmath72 appears in the @xmath208-polarized component , while @xmath209-polarized component is almost homogeneous ( in fact , a small amplitude stripe pattern of wavevector @xmath210 is observed in @xmath195 which comes from the coupling between @xmath195 and @xmath196 ) .",
    "this pattern made out of antisymmetric modes is the same pattern that is formed when only the antisymmetric instability is present .",

    "[ t2 ] we show the case with @xmath211 ; this value was chosen in order to induce the formation of a square pattern , since the angle @xmath129 between symmetric and antisymmetric vectors is @xmath212 in this case , but anyway the antisymmetric stripe pattern is formed as described .",
    "we have studied the spatial polarization structures in a mean field model for a kerr medium close to a two - photon resonance and driven by a linearly @xmath213-polarized field with negative detuning . in the self - focusing case the first pattern that is formed as the pump intensity is increased arises from the competition between two stationary instabilities which occur simultaneously .",
    "this codimension two bifurcation appears naturally in the system and it is a consequence of the form of the nonlinearities associated to the two - photon - resonant four - wave mixing process . as this codimension two",
    "bifurcation is not the result of the fine tuning of two parameters , as it is usually the case , it should be much more simple to be observed .",
    "in fact there is only one parameter , the pump , which has to be tuned .",
    "furthermore , we still have another free parameter , the detuning , which allows the system to form different patters without changing the distance to the codimension two instability threshold .    near the instability threshold",
    ", we have obtained the evolution equation for the patterns arising from the interacting instabilities using a weakly nonlinear analysis . from these analysis and from the numerical integration of the model",
    "we have shown that we can have the following patterns : a ) dynamical structures involving an arbitrary number of symmetric and antisymmetric modes , b ) a steady state pattern formed by the superposition of a symmetric mode and the quadratically resonant antisymmetric ones and c ) an antisymmetric stripe steady pattern in @xmath196 which is the same that would appear if only the antisymmetric instability were present .    as a final remark",
    "we notice that an interesting peculiarity of the situation considered here is that the selection among these patterns can be done in a very natural way , that is , changing the value of the detuning .",
