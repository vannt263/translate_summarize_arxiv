    "the implied 2 to 10 kev ( rest frame ) luminosity for the extended emission is then @xmath69 erg s@xmath2 .",

    "the most interesting aspect of the extended x - ray emission from 1138262 is that it is oriented along the radio axis and has a similar spatial extent .",
    "there are a number of possible mechanisms to explain this emission , and its alignment with the radio axis .",
    "one mechanism for the extended x - ray emission from 1138262 is synchrotron radiation from the relativistic electrons in the radio lobes .",
    "the total extended x - ray emission corresponds to @xmath70 jy at 2 kev .",
    "the radio spectral index for the integrated emission from 1138262 at cm wavelengths is 1.1 , and the integrated flux density from the source at 5 ghz is 160 mjy ( carilli et al .",
    "1997 ) . extrapolating the radio spectrum to 2 kev ( @xmath71 hz )",
    "implies an expected flux density of @xmath72 jy .",
    "hence the x - ray emission can not be a simple extrapolation of the radio synchrotron spectrum .",
    "the spectrum would have to flatten at frequencies above 15 ghz .",
    "such a flattening can be ruled - out by the fact that the predicted i - band ( @xmath73 hz ) emission would be @xmath74 jy , while the upper limit is @xmath75 jy .",
    "a second possibility is thompson scattering of x - ray emission from the nucleus .",
    "this is easily ruled out since the spectrum of the extended x - ray emission is different than that of the nucleus .",
    "a third possible mechanism is inverse compton ( ic ) emission , ie .",
    "up - scattering of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) by the relativistic electrons in the radio source . in this case",
    "comparing the radio synchrotron and x - ray ic emission constrains the magnetic fields within the radio source , since both depend on the relativistic electron population .",
    "using equation 11 in harris and grindlay ( 1979 ) , and using the integrated flux densities of the extended emission from 1138262 in the radio and x - ray , the resulting magnetic field is 7@xmath18 g assuming @xmath76 . for comparison ,",
    "the minimum energy magnetic field is about 200 @xmath18 g in the radio source ( carilli et al .",
    "whether the fields and particles conspire to reach a minimum configuration remains unknown , however , a field value a factor 30 lower than the minimum energy value raises the internal pressure by a factor 150",
    ". if the fields are at the minimum energy level , then ic emission constitutes 0.1@xmath3 of the total extended x - ray emission .",
    "brunetti et al .",
    "( 2001 ) have shown that in some sources the energy density in the photon field in the radio lobes due to optical / ir photons from the agn is larger than that in the cmb . in principle , this would allow for larger magnetic fields in the radio lobes . however , assuming a luminous ( obscured ) agn of optical through ir luminosity @xmath77 erg s@xmath2 in 1138262 ( as adopted by brunetti et al . for 3c 295 ) , and correcting the energy density in the cmb for redshift , it is clear from their figure 2 that the energy density in the photon field will be dominated by the cmb beyond about 10 kpc from the nucleus .",
    "the x - ray emission in 1138262 extends well beyond this radius .",
    "perhaps the most telling argument against ic being the dominant emission mechanism for the x - rays seen from 1138262 is that there are off - sets between the positions of high surface brightness radio and x - ray emitting features ( see figures 1 and 2 ) . in all radio galaxies",
    "for which ic x - ray emission has been seen , it is coincident with high surface brightness radio features ( harris et al .",
    "2000 , harris , carilli , & perley 1994 ) .",
    "if the dominant photon field is the microwave background , the observed x - rays are predominantly from electrons with lorentz factors @xmath78 , corresponding to radio emission at 270 mhz for @xmath79 .",
    "these data imply that if the x - ray emission is ic , then the radio morphology of the source would have to change significantly from low to high frequencies .",
    "high resolution images at frequencies @xmath80 mhz are required to test this hypothesis , although 1.4 ghz images show no dramatic change in the source morphology relative to that seen at 5 ghz .      a final mechanism we consider is thermal emission from hot gas .",
    "the extended emission from 1138262 has a 2 to 10 kev luminosity of @xmath81 erg s@xmath2 . for comparison , the cluster atmosphere enveloping the powerful radio galaxy cygnus a has a 2 to 10 kev luminosity of @xmath82 erg s@xmath2 ( arnuad et al .",
    "the cygnus a cluster atmosphere is roughly azimuthally symmetric , with a fwhm @xmath83 kpc ( reynolds and fabian 1996 ) .",
    "the spatial extent of the x - ray emission from 1138262 is confined to a region of @xmath84 kpc , and is aligned along the radio axis .",
    "so while the extended x - ray luminosities are within a factor two for cygnus a and 1138262 , the relative volumes differ by a factor of about 30 .",
    "the implication is that the density of hot gas in 1138262 must be a factor of five or so larger than that seen in cygnus a , implying gas densities @xmath85 @xmath5 .",
    "the mass in hot gas is @xmath6 m@xmath7 .",
    "the pressure in the hot gas is @xmath86 dynes @xmath54 , assuming @xmath87 k. the minimum pressure in the radio source is @xmath88 dynes @xmath54 , while the pressure in the ly@xmath9 emitting gas is about @xmath89 dynes @xmath54 ( pentericci et al .",
    "the pressure in the hot gas appears to be roughly adequate to confine both the radio source and the low filling factor , line emitting clouds .",
    "note that this confinement mechanism applies only to the ly@xmath9 emitting regions within the maximum radius of the x - ray source .",
    "the cooling time for such gas is @xmath90 years , which is more than an order of magnitude larger than the dynamical timescale for the system , but a factor three shorter than the age of the universe at that redshift .",
    "a possible heating mechanism of this gas is the expanding radio source , ie .",
    "the x - ray emission is from the ` cocoon ' of shocked material enveloping the radio source , as predicted by dynamical models of supersonically expanding jets ( begelman , blandford , & rees 1986 ) . assuming that the radio luminosity is @xmath91 of the jet kinetic luminosity implies a lower limit to the jet kinetic luminosity of @xmath92 ergs s@xmath2 .",
    "the total energy stored in the x - ray gas is about @xmath93 ergs .",
    "so it appears that the radio jet could have heated the medium over a timescale of @xmath94 years , which is reasonable for a radio galaxy of the size of 1138262 ( blundell & rawlings 1999 ) .",
    "our search for x - ray emission from 1138262 was originally motivated by the extreme values of faraday rotation , with the idea that the source is embedded in a dense , magnetized cluster atmosphere .",
    "while we have detected extended x - ray emission , the morphology of the emitting regions is distinctly different than that expected for a normal cluster atmosphere .",
    "so whence the large rotation measures ? if the x - ray emission is from the coccoon of shocked gas around the radio lobe , then large rotation measures will occur if the shocked material contains magnetic fields of order 20 @xmath18 g , ordered on scales of a few kpc ( bicknell , cameron , & gingold 1990 ) .",
    "the lack of extended emission perpendicular to the radio source axis allows us to set an upper limit to the 2 to 10 kev luminosity of an extended ( relaxed ) cluster atmosphere around 1138262 of @xmath95 erg s@xmath2 , or @xmath96 of the x - ray luminosity of the cygnus a cluster .",
    "so while the overdensity of galaxies in the region suggests that the system will evolve into a massive cluster , the lack of an extended x - ray atmosphere is consistent with the idea that it is not yet a dynamically relaxed system .",
    "this is also suggested by the irregular velocity distribution of the ly@xmath9 emitting galaxies ( pentericci et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "the lack of a hot cluster atmosphere also implies that the ambient medium into which the radio source is expanding in 1138262 is very different than the diffuse cluster atmospheres at @xmath97 k seen in similar luminosity radio galaxies at lower redshift , such as cygnus a and 3c 295 .",
    "this difference is consistent with the suggestion by rees ( 1989 ) that the environments of @xmath16 radio galaxies consist of a multiphase medium of cool ( @xmath98 k ) clouds or filaments , embedded in a virialized medium at 10@xmath99 to 10@xmath100 k. the passage of the bow shock driven by the expanding radio source would have a number of effects in such a multiphase medium ( kaiser & alexander 1999 ) .",
    "rees ( 1989 ) points out that the densest clouds are relatively unaffected by the passage of the shock , and may be induced to collapse and form stars by the high pressure medium in which they suddenly find themselves ( _ cf . _",
    "icke 1999 ) .",
    "the intermediate density clouds are shocked , but the cooling time is shorter than the jet lifetime , perhaps giving rise to some of the ly@xmath9 emission directly associated with bright radio features . the lower density , higher filling factor gas is shock heated to @xmath101 , giving rise to the extended x - ray emission .",
    "barthel and arnaud ( 1996 ) have proposed a selection effect in radio galaxies in which jets propagating through regions of higher gas density have a higher conversion efficiency of jet kinetic energy into radio luminosity ( see also eales 1992 ) .",
    "if the ambient medium is anisotropically distributed , then radio jets of a given kinetic luminosity propagating along the direction of highest ambient density will be brighter than ones propagating through low density regions . in this case ,",
    "preferential alignment between the jet axis and the axis of highest density of the ambient material will occur naturally in radio flux limited samples ( west 1999 ) .",
    "a final comparison we make is with the recent observations of the extended x - ray emission around the @xmath102 radio galaxy 3c 294 by fabian et al .",
    "the observations of 3c 294 show a similar alignment between the x - ray and radio axes as that seen in 1138262 , and a similar lack of one - to - one correspondence between high surface brightness radio and x - ray features . in particular",
    ", for 3c 294 the x - ray emission extends significantly beyond the radio source maximum radius .",
    "fabian et al . ( 2001 ) interpret the extended x - ray emission as being thermal emission from a cooling flow cluster atmosphere .",
    "using the temperature - luminosity relation for x - ray emitting cluster atmospheres , they show that the existence of such a system at this high redshift argues for a low @xmath103 universe .",
    "inherent in this argument is that the gas temperature is a gross measure of the gravitational mass of system . for 1138262",
    "we have argued that the gas heating is due to the expanding radio source , and hence unrelated to the gravitational potential of the system .",
    "the existence of a hot , high filling factor , thermal gas in high @xmath14 radio galaxies has long been hypothesized in order to confine both the radio source and the optical line emitting clouds ( chambers et al .",
