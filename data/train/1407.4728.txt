    "investigations of unusual nuclear properties , such as nontrivial values of flavor quantum numbers ( strangeness , charm or beauty ) , or large isospin ( so called neutron rich isotopes ) are of continuous interest . a particularly interesting phenomenon in nuclear physics",
    "is the existence of nuclei containing strange baryons .",
    "the lightest hyperons are stable against strong and electromagnetic decays , and as they do not suffer from pauli blocking by other nucleons they can live long enough in the nuclear environment to become bound .",
    "when a hyperon , specifically a @xmath3-hyperon with strangeness @xmath4 , replaces one of the nucleons in the nucleus , the composed system acquires different properties from that of the original one , and is referred as hypernucleus .",
    "one such very important new property is the additional binding .",
    "for instance , while the one - neutron separation energy in @xmath5c is @xmath6 mev , it is @xmath7 mev in @xmath8c , and @xmath9he is bound while @xmath10he is unbound . as a consequence",
    "the neutron drip line is modified , and the extended three - dimensional @xmath11 domain of radioactivity becomes even richer in elements than the ordinary neutron - proton domain @xmath12 . because of this glue attribute of hypernuclei the @xmath13 interaction is closely related to the inquiry on the existence of strange quark matter and its fragments , and strange stars ( analogues of neutron stars ) , which makes the hypernuclear physics also relevant for astrophysics and cosmology .",
    "another remarkable property of @xmath3-hypernuclei is the occurrence of the nonmesonic weak decay ( nmwd ) : @xmath14 with @xmath15 , which is the main decay channel for medium and heavy hypernuclei .",
    "this decay takes place only within nuclear environment , and is the unique opportunity that nature offers us to inquire about strangeness - flipping interaction between baryons .",
    "the knowledge of strange hadrons carrying an additional flavour degree - of - freedom is essential for understanding the low - energy regime of the quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , which is the field theory of strong interactions among quarks and gluons , and is widely used at very high energies . yet , at energy scale of the nucleon mass the hadrons represent complex many body systems , making difficult the qcd description due to the non - perturbative nature of the theory .    ergo the nmwd dynamics is frequently handled by the one - meson - exchange ( ome ) models  @xcite , among which the exchange of full pseudoscalar ( @xmath16 ) and vector ( @xmath17 ) meson octets ( psve ) is the most used one .",
    "this model is based on the original idea of yukawa that the @xmath18 interaction at long distance is due to the one - pion - exchange ( ope ) , while the weak coupling constants are obtained from soft meson theorems and @xmath19  @xcite .",
    "the dominant role is being played by the exchange of pion and kaon mesons ( pke ) .",
    "we have recently shown that the @xmath2 meson exchange potential with soft dipole form factors ( spke ) reproduces fairly well both @xmath20-shell",
    "@xcite , and @xmath21-shell  @xcite nmwd .",
    "a hybrid mechanism has been also meticulously used by the tokyo group  @xcite to describe the nmwd in @xmath22 , and @xmath23 hypernuclei .",
    "this group represented the short range part of the @xmath13 weak interaction by the direct quark ( dq ) weak transition potential , while the longer range interactions are assumed to come from the exchange of @xmath2 mesons with soft pion form factor .",
    "of @xmath24 gev  @xcite . ]    the @xmath3-hypernuclei are mainly produced by the @xmath25 and the @xmath26 strong reactions , and disintegrate by the weak decay with the rate @xmath27 where @xmath28 is decay rate for the mesonic ( m ) decay @xmath29 , and @xmath30 is the rate for the nonmesonic ( nm ) decay , which can be induced either by one bound nucleon ( @xmath31 ) , @xmath32 , or by two bound nucleons ( @xmath33 ) , @xmath34 , @xmath35 with @xmath36 in the evaluation of @xmath30 , and the corresponding spectra , are used the shell model ( sm ) and the fermi gas model ( fgm ) for @xmath37 ( within the two - particle phase space )  @xcite , while for @xmath38 ( within the three - particle phase space ) only the later model has been employed so far @xcite .    in our previous work",
    "@xcite we have analyzed the brookhaven national laboratory ( bnl ) experiment e788 on @xmath0he  @xcite , involving : 1 ) the single - proton spectra @xmath39 , and total neutron spectra @xmath40 , as a function of corresponding one - nucleon kinetic energies @xmath41 , and 2 ) two - particle - coincidence spectra , as a function of : i ) the sum of kinetic energies @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and ii ) the opening angle @xmath44 , @xmath45 .",
    "this has been done within a simple theoretical framework , based on the independent - particle sm ( ipsm ) for the @xmath31-induced nm weak decay spectra .",
    "that is , we have disregarded both the @xmath33-nm decay , and the final state interactions ( fsis ) , which is consistent with the upper limits @xmath46 , and @xmath47 established in  @xcite with a @xmath48 cl .. ] moreover , the calculated spectra were normalized to the experimental ones .",
    "for instance , in the case of single proton spectrum @xmath39 , the number of protons @xmath49 measured at energy @xmath50 within a fixed proton energy bin @xmath51 , is confronted with the calculated number",
    "_ p(e)= n_p^expe,_p^exp=_i=1^m _ p^exp(e_i ) , [ 1]where @xmath52 is the total number of measured protons , while @xmath53 and @xmath54 are evaluated theoretically . note that : a ) while the @xmath49 are defined only at @xmath55 experimental energies @xmath56 , the quantity @xmath57 is a continuous function of @xmath58 , and b ) the condition @xmath59 is automatically fulfilled when @xmath60 .    to describe the nmwd dynamics three different ome potentials have been tested in ref .",
    "@xcite , namely :    p1 ) the full psve potential that includes the exchanges of nonstrange - mesons @xmath61 , and @xmath62 , and strange - mesons @xmath63 , and @xmath64 with the weak coupling constants from the refs .",
    "@xcite ,    p2 ) the pke model , with usual cutoffs @xmath65 gev , and @xmath66 gev , and    p3 ) the spke potential , which corresponds to the cutoffs @xmath67 gev and @xmath68 gev .",
    "the calculated spectra shown in figs . 2 , 3 , and 4 in ref .",
    "@xcite correspond to the parametrization p3 , but almost identical spectra are obtained with the remaining two parametrizations , which is due to the fact that the shapes of all spectra are basically tailored by the kinematics , depending very weakly on the dynamics , which cancels out almost wholly in when @xmath53 is divided by @xmath69 . moreover",
    ", the fairly good agreement between the data and calculations indicates that the framework employed ( ipsm plus the two - particle phase space and the recoil effect ) could be appropriate for describing the kinematics in the nmwd of @xmath0he .",
    "it indicates as well that , neither the fsi , nor the two - nucleon induced decay processes play a very significant role .",
    "needless to stress that we study the nmwd in order to understand its mechanism , and to disentangle in this way the strangeness - flipping interaction among baryons , while the fsis , together the @xmath33-nm decay , are to some extent just undesirable and inevitable complications .    to test not only the kinematics but also the dynamics the comparison between the experimental and calculated spectra has to be done differently , as already pointed out in refs .",
    "this is done by confronting straightforwardly the corresponding spectra .",
    "for instance , for the case considered above one compares the calculated spectrum @xmath53 with the experimental one defined as : s_p^exp(e_i)&=&. |_bnl , finuda = .",
    "[ 2 ]    the difference between the first and second terms in the right side is due to different normalizations of @xmath70 .",
    "the bnl and finuda groups do it in relation with the total number of weak decays @xmath71 , while the kek data are normalized to the number of nm decays @xmath72 . in both cases the experimental proton transition rate , derived from the proton kinetic energy spectrum @xmath53 ,",
    "is defined as _ p^exp = e_is_p^exp(e_i ) , [ 3]and similarly those obtained from @xmath73 , @xmath45 , @xmath43 , and @xmath74 .",
    "the neutron decay rate derived from the total neutron kinetic energy spectrum is defined as : @xmath75 .",
    "for @xmath76 we use the relationship @xmath77 which was determined in ref .",
    "@xcite for all measured hypernuclei in the mass range @xmath78",
    ". we will analyze here as well the spectra @xmath74 as a function of the center of mass ( c.m . ) momentum @xmath79 .",
    "more , we will seize the opportunity to discuss the spectra of other two light hypernuclei , namely of @xmath0h , and @xmath1he , taking care of measurements done on the latter at kek  @xcite , and finuda  @xcite .",
    "theoretical expressions for different nm weak decay spectra within the ipsm that are used here have been presented previously  @xcite and will not be repeated here .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     the identity and similar relationships for protons allow us to relate the experimental transition probabilities derived from different spectra through the eq . and those corresponding to other observables .",
    "they are compared in table [ t1 ] , and although labelled as @xmath80 , and @xmath81 they include not only contributions arising from @xmath37 but also from @xmath38 , as well as the effects of the fsis . as can be see the results coming from different spectra differ considerably , and the answer to these discrepancies must come from the experimental side . for the sake of completeness in the same table",
    "we also show the values of the `` bared transitions rates '' , which were extracted from the experimental data  @xcite excluding the effects of both the @xmath33-nm decay , and the fsis .",
    "single and coincidence spectra of the nm weak decay of light hypernuclei have been evaluated in a systematic way for the first time .",
    "we have considered the 1n induced processes only , omitting entirely the 2n induced events , as well as the effects of the fsis .",
    "however , we have discussed in detail the recoil effect , showing that it is very important in the description of the spectra of light hypernuclei . for the theoretical framework we have used the ipsm with three different parametrizations for the transition potential .",
    "the comparison with data suggests that the soft @xmath2 exchange model , introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , could be a good starting point to describe the dynamics of the nmwd in @xmath0he , and @xmath1he  hypernuclei .",
    "such a statement is supported by the results shown in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] for the kinetic energy spectra , and in figs .",
    "[ f2 ] , and [ f3 ] for @xmath82 coincidence spectra . in spite of this agreement",
    "we feel that a more realistic description of the src , such as done in refs .",
    "@xcite by means of the dq weak transition potential , may help us to better understand the baryon - baryon strangeness - flipping interaction .",
    "definitively , the coincidence @xmath83 data can not be explained theoretically neihter in @xmath0he   nor in @xmath1he . on the other hand , due to the lack of data",
    "nothing can be said regarding @xmath0h .",
    "we note , however , that both the single and coincidence neutron spectra in this case are of the same order of magnitude as in the other two hypernuclei , and that therefore it would be extremely useful to measure them experimentally .    despite having achieved a relatively fair agreement with the data for several exclusive observable , such as proton and neutron kinetic energy spectra and the @xmath82 coincidence spectra",
    ", the question arises whether it is legitimate to use the sm , and in particular the harmonic oscillator wave functions for systems as small as are @xmath0h , @xmath0he , and @xmath1he .",
    "moreover , as pointed out by j - h .",
    "jun  @xcite , the residual nucleons are in a unbound state for some channels , and therefore they are very different from the initial nucleons which do not take part in the decay process .",
    "then , it could be appropriate to treat the four- and five - body nature of these nmwd explicitly , as was done for instance in the evaluation of separation energies in single and double strange hypernuclei  @xcite , and in _ ab initio _ calculations of four - nucleon scattering  @xcite .",
    "( the shell model yields quite nice results for light @xmath84 hypernuclei  @xcite . )",
    "it would be very interesting to analyze whether it is possible to account for the experimental nn coincidence spectra through such microscopic calculations .",
    "an undertaking of this nature is , however , beyond our present means .",
    "this work was partly supported by argentinean agencies conicet ( pip 0377 ) and foncyt ( pict-2010 - 2680 ) , as well as by the brazilian agency fapesp ( contract 2013/01790 - 5 ) .",
