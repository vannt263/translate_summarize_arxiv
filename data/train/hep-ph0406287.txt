    "the lightcone hamiltonian approach to quantum field theories @xcite is an intuitively appealing and powerful tool in the study of gauge theories .",
    "there has been steady progress in recent years to formulate and solve such theories at the non - perturbative level . in pursuit of this goal , however , one runs up against an apparent paradox .",
    "one of the appealing features of lightcone quantization is the simplified vacuum structure  often it is chosen to be the trivial bare vacuum .",
    "but in many cases of physical interest , there is supposed to be a complicated vacuum structure .",
    "the success of the qcd sum rules  @xcite , for example , suggests that chiral and other condensates play an important role in extracting hadronic physics from qcd . in this paper , we investigate how chiral condensates could enter in the lightcone formulation of qcd and , assuming that they are there , show how this leads to the breaking of quark helicity symmetry with massless quarks .",
    "we derive the explicit form of the quark helicity violating interactions , induced into a lightcone qcd hamiltonian acting effectively in a trivial vacuum .",
    "it is shown to be necessary for splitting of pseudoscalar from vector meson masses and illustrative non - perturbative calculations are performed in dimensionally reduced models .",
    "the general mechanism by which a trivial light - cone vacuum can become dressed with fermions is now well understood @xcite , although detailed representations have been given only in a few simple models . in the cases that are completely understood ,",
    "all of the physics of the full theory , including the dressed vacuum , can be represented by induced interactions that act in the usual light - cone representation space based on a trivial vacuum . in that sense ,",
    "the problem is very similar to the standard renormalization problem : degrees of freedom ( those that dress the vacuum ) are removed from the theory ; when those degrees of freedom are properly `` integrated out '' rather than just ignored , new effects appear that provide the same physics using only the remaining degrees of freedom .",
    "of course , the usual high energy divergences of qcd also appear in the light - cone representation and must be controlled by some sort of regulators .",
    "counterterms associated with those regulation procedures may also add new interactions to the theory .",
    "given the interactions , a number of approaches to renormalization of their couplings have been investigated , such as perturbative similarity renormalization group @xcite and non - perturbative symmetry optimization @xcite .",
    "the fundamental requirement of lorentz invariance implies that , _ in the continuum _ , the vacuum state should be the same in any quantization scheme .",
    "therefore , the vacuum in the light - cone representation is the same vector as in the ` equal - time ' representation , but the different quantization procedures give that vector in different representations .",
    "likewise , condensates and any other quantity that is representation independent , must be the same whichever quantization scheme is used .",
    "when the theory is quantized directly on null - planes , the retention of lightcone zero modes can dress the trivial vacuum and will do so if the theory incorporates a structured vacuum that supports condensates .",
    "this is the approach we follow here .",
    "let us note , however , that there exist some other approaches to the lightcone vacuum problem which we do not pursue here , such as the use of near lightcone quantization @xcite or point - splitting in lightcone time @xcite .",
    "the spontaneous violation of helicity has also been investigated in trivial bare lightcone vacua perturbed by mass breaking terms @xcite . for any method , computing the details of the representation of the vacuum in light - cone quantization of qcd would be quite involved . in this paper",
    "we have a more modest goal . imposing the required symmetries on the form of a general chiral - symmetry - breaking vacuum ,",
    "we derive new effective interactions , operating in a trivial vacuum , that violate quark helicity .",
    "the conservation of quark helicity differs from that of chiral charge only by the neglect of zero mode vacuum structure and hence is sensitive to the spontaneous ( and anomalous ) breaking of chiral symmetry .",
    "the violation of quark helicity is crucial for obtaining the correct hadron spectrum , previous literature behind this idea having been reviewed by mustaki @xcite .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows : in the next section we introduce the tools we will need , emphasizing the role of helicity symmetry and rewriting the theory in a way which exposes the zero mode operators that can dress the vacuum . in section [ sec : qcd ]",
    "we derive the form of induced interactions that violate quark helicity in massless @xmath0 gauge theory , assuming the existence of a chiral symmetry - breaking fermion condensate . to illustrate the effect on spectrum calculations , in particular pseudoscalar ",
    "vector splitting , we then perform some computations on 1 + 1-dimensionally reduced models .",
    "we obtain exact solutions to a model containing only the new induced interactions in section  [ sec : exact ] . adding gauge interactions",
    ", we then perform numerical dlcq calculations of the meson spectrum .",
    "conclusions are discussed in section [ sec : last ] . in appendix",
    "a we briefly review the schwinger model , which is an example where the fermionic vacuum structure is exactly known @xcite .",
    "unless otherwise stated , our metric is such that lightcone coordinates are @xmath1 , @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the light - front time variable .",
    "we decompose fermion spinors @xmath4 into the left and right moving projections @xmath5 .",
    "each of these projections can be further decomposed into different helicities @xmath6 , @xmath7 .",
    "similarly , we define the helicity eigenstates of the transversely polarized gauge fields via @xmath8 , @xmath9 .    in qcd with massless quarks ,",
    "the action is @xmath10 \\ , \\label{full}\\ ] ] @xmath11 , @xmath12 this action is invariant under the chiral transformation @xmath13 we work in light - cone gauge @xmath14 throughout , in which case @xmath15 satisfies a constraint equation @xmath16 integrating , we obtain @xmath17 here , @xmath18 is the antiderivative which just replaces @xmath19 with @xmath20 in the fourier expansion of the field .",
    "we see that @xmath15 is not quite a dependent field of @xmath21 .",
    "the constant of integration is the @xmath22-zero mode @xmath23 , which is a field that remains independent of @xmath21 .",
    "this zero mode can dress the lightcone vacuum state , breaking chiral symmetry , as we shall see .    in order to cope with fields that may not diminish sufficiently at large distances to discard , when necessary one can place the system in a box of length @xmath24 in both @xmath22 and @xmath3 @xcite . if a charge is defined as the integral over @xmath25 of the zero component of a conserved current , one can calculate the same quantity by integrating over the surface illustrated in figure  1 .",
    "this includes not only the portion , labelled @xmath26 in figure  1 , on which the fields are initialized in the light - cone representation , but also the legs @xmath27 and @xmath28 . in general",
    "the integrals over @xmath27 and @xmath28 do not go to zero as @xmath29 goes to infinity .",
    "integration constants such as @xmath30 can not be initialized on surface @xmath26 .",
    "thus , for example , on the @xmath31 initialization surface @xmath26 we have @xmath32 here @xmath33 is the color index , @xmath34 the helicity index ( such that if @xmath35 , @xmath36 ) , and @xmath37 a normalization factor chosen so that the anti - commutation relations are @xmath38 with similar relations for anti - fermions @xmath39 .",
    "the independent fermion @xmath40 is a function only of @xmath3 and may be expanded as @xmath41 for gluons on @xmath26 we write @xmath42 @xmath43 =    \\delta(k^+ -p^+)\\delta(x_{\\perp } - y_{\\perp } ) \\delta_{s_1 s_2 } \\delta_{ab}\\ , \\label{commg}\\ ] ] of course , for finite @xmath29 the above integrals over @xmath44 become discrete sums for integers @xmath45 of @xmath46 ( bosons ) or @xmath47 ( fermions ) .    of particular interest in the present case",
    "is the chiral charge generator , defined by integrating the zero component of the chiral current @xmath48 over @xmath25 .",
    "if the underlying chiral current is conserved , @xmath49 , then it is also equal to the integral of the normal component of the chiral current over @xmath27 , @xmath26 and @xmath28 .",
    "if we neglect the contribution from surfaces at @xmath50 , one finds @xmath51   \\label{lchelicity}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which measures the total quark and anti - quark helicity .",
    "note that this is sometimes also called the light - front chiral charge @xcite .",
    "this light - front chiral charge differs from the chiral charge by the integral of the chiral density over @xmath27 and @xmath28 ; @xmath30 will contribute to these last integrals .",
    "if the underlying chiral current is conserved , and there are no non - trivial ( vacuum ) effects from zero modes on the neglected surfaces , one expects quark helicity to be conserved .",
    "however , the non - conservation of quark helicity is crucial to producing the experimentally observed splitting in the meson spectrum between pseudoscalar and vector mesons @xcite . to see this in more detail ,",
    "one notes that the valence quark content of the pseudoscalar and helicity zero component of the vector is @xmath52 respectively .",
    "they differ only by being symmetric and anti - symmetric under quark helicity flip .",
    "interactions that conserve quark helicity can not split them in energy . if the zero mode @xmath30 is neglected , the qcd action ( [ full ] ) contains only quark helicity preserving interactions and can not produce the required splitting .",
    "therefore , we deduce that , in qcd , one can not neglect the flow of chiral charge across the surfaces at @xmath50 and one must retain the zero modes that live there .",
    "the violation of quark helicity is a direct consequence of conserved chiral current and non - trivial structure of the vacuum which violates spontaneously the chiral symmetry ( [ xtran ] ) .      in order to investigate in more detail the considerations of the previous subsection",
    ", we now rewrite the fields in such a way as to expose the operators that can dress the vacuum . in intermediate steps in our analysis",
    "we will work with discretized @xmath53 .",
    "the fermion at given @xmath54 , and @xmath34 is then just a one dimensional fermi field which can be bosonized in the form @xcite @xmath55 where @xmath56 is a wavefunction renormalization constant , @xmath57 @xmath58 @xmath59 and @xmath60 is a klaiber regulator @xcite .",
    "since the ` fusion ' fields @xmath61 are bosons , @xmath62 is an @xmath63-independent ` spurion ' inserted to carry the fermionic quantum numbers of @xmath21 .",
    "it is important to appreciate that , in re - writing the fermi field in this way , we have made no assumptions or approximations ; the field written in terms of the @xmath64 s and @xmath65 s is identical to ( [ fld1 ] ) .",
    "while we will not need most of the details of the fusion fields , the spurions will play a key role .",
    "we define a similar bosonization for the @xmath30 field in terms of @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "since the fusion operator @xmath68 in this case is independent of @xmath22 ( @xmath69 ) , it will create free bosons of mass squared @xmath70 .",
    "these are tachyonic and therefore can not appear in the physical states of the theory , although they may in general be needed to recover the full canonical structure .",
    "the operators we will retain from the @xmath30 fields are their ` spurions ' @xmath71 . for convenience , we note here the commutation relations of the spurions that follow from those of the fermi field @xcite , @xmath72 where @xmath73 and @xmath74 are differing labels indicating a lorentz , colour , or transverse structure . spurions commute with the fusion operators .    at this point",
    "we can see that the presence of @xmath40 , in particular the spurion @xmath71 , allows for dressing of a trivial lightcone bare vacuum @xmath75 .",
    "since the fusion operators @xmath76 carry positive definite lightcone momentum @xmath77 , they can not appear in the vacuum which should have momentum zero ( this is just the usual argument that leads to the trivial light - cone vacuum ) .",
    "the spurions are kinematically allowed to dress the vacuum but considerations of symmetry restrict the possible ways that can occur .",
    "the fact that the vacuum must be a chargeless lorentz scalar implies that , in the sector where there are no gauge - field zero modes , only bilinear combinations of the form @xmath78 , or its conjugate , can occur . note that these combinations , which are the spurion part of @xmath79 , are not chirally invariant .",
    "other chargeless lorentz invariant combinations of spurions can always be reduced to combinations of the previous bilinear forms using the rules ( [ spur ] ) .",
    "the pure fermion content of a general vacuum state must therefore be of the form @xmath80",
    "\\label{hoover}\\ ] ] if the theory is to be charge conjugation invariant , the functional @xmath81 must be symmetric in its arguments .",
    "the spurion components of the bilinears must also occur with the same colour and at the same transverse position if the vacuum is to be invariant under @xmath53-dependent gauge transformations ( we show later that @xmath82 transforms in the fundamental representation when it acts on @xmath75 ) .",
    "lastly , the functional @xmath81 should be invariant under shifts of @xmath53 for translation invariance .",
    "if @xmath83 is not equal to @xmath75 , which we assume in this paper , then it follows that there is a @xmath79 condensate from this sector of the theory @xmath84 translation invariance of the condensate implies that the combination @xmath85 is independent of @xmath53 in the vacuum .",
    "the contribution from @xmath83 may not be the total condensate , for sectors of the vacuum containing gluon zero modes could also contribute , i.e. the total vacuum is @xmath86 , where every vector in @xmath87 contains gluon fields .",
    "in fact , for the aim of this paper in demonstrating quark helicity violation , we will not need to consider the sector of the vacuum that includes gluon zero modes or the induced interactions that might result from that structure .",
    "that is not to say these sectors are physically unimportant , but gluon condensates and the effective interactions they generate is a separate question to the one we address here . not only",
    "do we not need the sector of the vacuum containing gluon zero modes , but to find the form of the induced interaction that violates quark helicity we shall not need to specify the exact form of @xmath81 .",
    "there are examples of much simpler field theories where this vacuum functional can be obtained exactly .",
    "the most completely solved example is the schwinger model , for which we include a brief review in appendix a. for the case of the massive schwinger model , there is an induced interaction whose form is exactly known @xcite .",
    "that example serves to demonstrate that the form ( [ hoover ] ) can lead to induced interactions and , moreover , is sufficiently general to include the case of anomalous chiral symmetry breaking and @xmath88-vacua .",
    "the lightcone qcd hamiltonian @xmath89 derived from the action ( [ full ] ) satisfies an eigenvalue equation which is the relativistic schrodinger equation for this problem : @xmath90 @xmath91 is the invariant mass eigenvalue .",
    "the eigenstates , @xmath92 , can represent the vacuum , boundstates of quarks and gluons ( hadrons ) , or scattering states of hadrons .",
    "since we focus on the new effects introduced by fermion lightcone zero modes , we do not need all the details of @xmath89 .",
    "the interested reader is referred to a review such as ref.@xcite for a fuller description of the lightcone qcd hamiltonian .",
    "any interaction in @xmath89 that depends on @xmath15 can potentially give rise to an induced interaction through the existence of @xmath40 .",
    "for the massless qcd case we consider in this paper , in lightcone gauge the only one is @xmath93 .",
    "the part of this interaction that depends on @xmath40 induces extra , quark - helicity - violating , operators in the qcd action ( [ full ] ) and hence the lightcone hamiltonian .",

    "the particular choice of the parameters @xmath246 is not very important , since we did not try to tune them to obtain the best phenomenology .",
    "however , they were zoned to ensure absence of tachyons , that the @xmath175 states were light in the spectrum , and a reasonably large splitting of the @xmath175 states compared to their masses . a typical result for the spectrum in this case",
    "is shown in figure  4 , where @xmath199 eigenvalues have been fit to the form @xmath247 the graph shows that the splitting of the @xmath169 survives the dlcq continuum limit @xmath195 , as advertised .",
    "we have shown that operator - valued integration constants , which arise in the solutions of the constraint equations encountered in quantizing qcd in the light - cone representation , can dress the bare light - cone vacuum and induce new interactions . without specifying the vacuum explicitly , except for the general form following from poincare and gauge symmetry and the assumption that the bare vacuum _ is _ dressed by a pure fermion component , we have derived the form of new operators induced into the lightcone qcd hamiltonian .",
    "those operators violate quark helicity for zero quark bare mass .",
    "we have demonstrated qualitatively , and quantitatively in the case of dimensionally reduced models , how that operator leads to a splitting of the masses of the pseudoscalar and vector mesons , the helicity zero components of which would be degenerate otherwise .",
    "the induced operators we have derived in this paper are almost certainly not the only ones in qcd .",
