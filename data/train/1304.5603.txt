    "starting from november 2002 till the end of may 2003 , the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sars ) had spread widely over the world . up to the end of may 2003 probable cases",
    "have been reported in 35 countries or regions , and the cumulative number of cases has reached 8202 by may 26 , 2003 according to the report by the world health organization ( who ) .",
    "sars in the year 2003 and avian influenza like h7n9 this year received or receive intensive attentions from all over the world due to its high case - fatality rate .",
    "people were particularly interested in finding the period of the time between infection and the onset of infectiousness , length of period that patients remain infectious , further infections that each patient produce , total number of infections during the epidemic , etc .",
    "a large number of publications have been reported for sars , many of which have been included in reference books @xcite and reviews @xcite .",
    "important achievements have been made for the transmission dynamics using various mathematical models @xcite-@xcite and reported data from hong kong or canada .",
    "donnelly et al@xcite , riley et al @xcite and lipsitch et al @xcite make use of the available data for sars on latent , incubation and infectious periods and have successfully fitted their models to data describing the number of cases observed over time .",
    "the important conclusion is that if the sars is uncontrolled , then a majority of people would be infected .",
    "the potential effectiveness of different control measures has been studied in these references .",
    "though sars did not appear again since 2003 , there may be other epidemic , such as h7n9 avian influenza occurring actually in china possibly , spreading in a similar way .",
    "hence the study of various models for the prediction of sars and other epidemic once it occurs is always important .    as assessed by dye and gay @xcite , the current mathematical models are complex , the data are poor , and some big questions such as accuracy of case reports and heterogeneity in transmission remain .",
    "dye and gay anticipated that the next generation of sars models would have to become more complex .",
    "it is now evident that sars and maybe avian influenza in a city can be controlled through multiscale measures such as medical interventions , public - service announcements , isolation of people having contact with infected ,  restriction of individual and social activities , etc .",
    "when the interventions to control a communicable epidemic are intensive and of multiple scales , it would be very diff@xmath0icult to find all those details of the epidemic needed by a more complex model .",
    "it is thus desired that , under intensive and multiscale interventions , the global behavior of sars or avian influenza spread , governed by a complex and multiscale system , could be roughly predicted without knowing the epidemic details .",
    "the dynamics of an epidemics is an important topic in biology , medicine , mathematics and physics and is usually modelled through differential equations @xcite-@xcite , among which is the famous sir ( susceptible - infected - removed ) model .",
    "the study on this topic is still very active ( @xcite-@xcite,@xcite-@xcite , ) .",
    "most of the models for epidemics spread rely on differential equations for the susceptible , infected and removed numbers .",
    "different spread mechanisms are embedded into the various terms in the differential equations .    in this paper",
    "we are interested in the number of hospitalized cases ( cumulative number of cases minus the number of deaths and the number recovered ) and attempt to consider a new approach to predict this number . in our approach",
    "all the mechanisms controlling the spread are factored into a single parameter .",
    "assuming the system controlling the spread of sars or similar epidemic is a thermodynamic one , we define an entropy and determine the only parameter by using the principle of extreme rate of entropy production .",
    "this allows us to relate the dynamics of the spread to the information at the inflexion point of the curve describing the time variation of the number of hospitalized cases .",
    "the inflexion point is the date at which the multiple controlling measures take effect .",
    "the model presented in this paper is based on a simple differential equation with the spread rate forced to satisfy four constraints ( section 2.1 ) .",
    "the model is closed by the use of maximum or minimal rate of entropy production as the system for spread is assumed to be a thermodynamical one ( section 2.2 ) .",
    "there is a critical point ( date ) at which the spread rate turns to decrease due to the overall role of interventions .",
    "the maximum number of infected individuals and the time at which this maximum occurs can be related to the number and time corresponding to the critical date ( section 2.3 ) .",
    "this model is validated against the sars data of the year 2003 ( section 3 ) for which we are able to follow the history of the spread .",
    "let @xmath1 be the number of hospitalized cases , defined as the cumulative number subtracted from the cumulative number of deaths and recovery ones since death and recovery are also parts of actions in the thermodynamical system .",
    "then the rate of increase ( decrease ) is proportional to the number at the previous day ,    @xmath2    with the roles of all the controlling mechanisms factored into the parameter @xmath3 . knowing the exact expression of @xmath3 requires the knowledge of all the details of the epidemic and the coupling with other differential equations .",
    "the essential idea in our method to find @xmath3  is to ignore any details but to use a thermodynamic approach .",
    "it is to be remarked that this parameter must be subjected to the following four constraints :    \\1 ) the parameter @xmath3 must have the dimension of @xmath4 , i.e. @xmath5    \\2 ) at the initial stage there is an exponential increase for regular spread to start ( since at the initial stage the number is near zero ) , i.e. , @xmath6 .",
    "\\3 ) with the strong and active interventions the rate must decrease at a given day @xmath7 which will be called the _ inflexion point _ ( date ) .",
    "mathematically this amounts to say that @xmath8 vanishes at @xmath7 , i.e. ,    @xmath9    \\4 ) there must be a maximum for @xmath1 , say at @xmath10 , for which we have @xmath11 .",
    "we assume that the virus causing an epidemic is constantly active ( high temperature or intrinsic lifetime constraint would make the epidemic disappear suddenly , but this is not considered here ) so that @xmath3 is assumed to be an analytical function .",
    "also nature would select laws as simple as possible .",
    "the only analytical function that meets the four constraints and that is simple enough is found to be given by    @xmath12    where @xmath13 is a parameter . inserting ( [ 002 ] ) into ( [ 001 ] ) leads to the following solution which is just the log - normal function ,    @xmath14    here @xmath15 is a proportion constant , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 is to be determined in the following through the use of the principle of extreme rate of entropy production .",
    "the principle of extreme rate of entropy production can be found in ref8 .",
    "this has been successfully  used to obtain the distribution of droplet production during its impingement on solid walls @xcite .",
    "certainly , the width of the curve @xmath18 can be characterized by @xmath19 .",
    "the wider the curve is , the larger is the ( shannon ) entropy .",
    "the intrinsic spread mechanism of virus and the large mixing activity of the population tend to make the curve wider ( so @xmath20 larger ) .",
    "however , the medical and social interventions to control the epidemic constitute a dissipation mechanism which would prohibit the curve to become infinitely wide ( @xmath17 infinitely large )",
    ". the width would cease to increase when the maximum dissipation rate is reached .",
    "maximum dissipation rate corresponds to extreme rate of entropy production , which again corresponds to @xmath21here @xmath22 is the shannon entropy def@xmath0ined as @xmath23where @xmath24 with @xmath25 in the usual entropy def@xmath26inition .",
    "integration leads to @xmath27so that ( [ eq23 ] ) holds if and only if    @xmath28      inserting ( [ eq1 ] ) into @xmath29 yields the following relationship between @xmath30 and @xmath31    @xmath32using ( [ eq1 ] ) , @xmath33 is related to @xmath34 by @xmath35with @xmath36 given by ( [ eq3 ] ) , we have    @xmath37      once we know the inflexion date , it is crucial to determine when is the initial date for regular spreading of the epidemic . in other words , we must know the number @xmath31 ( cumulated days to reach the inflexion point counting from the initial date ) .",
    "this can be done by using the rate of increase @xmath38 at @xmath7 . a simple calculation using ( [ eq1 ] ) yields    @xmath39which yields @xmath40",
    "the model is used as follows .",
    "step 1 ( data recording ) . using the reported data we determine the number @xmath41 at the inflexion date ( the date that @xmath38 tends to decrease ) . also determine @xmath42 by using the reported date .",
    "determine the proportion constant @xmath15 in ( [ eq1 ] ) by setting @xmath43 . then use ( [ eqll ] ) to determine @xmath44 .",
    "step 2 ( prediction ) . once @xmath31 and @xmath34 are known , use ( [ eq6 ] ) to predict @xmath30 and @xmath33 and plot the curve @xmath45 using eq ( [ eq1 ] ) to predict the number @xmath1 for @xmath46 .",
    "hence it is essential to determine the inflexion point .",
    "specifically , this is done as follows .",
    "we record the reported number @xmath1 for each day and draw the curve @xmath47 .",
    "once we observe that @xmath48 reaches a peak ( denoted as @xmath49 ) at @xmath7 , then @xmath44 is considered as the inflexion point .",
    "however , special cautions must be made .",
    "\\(a ) in the early period of the epidemic , it is possible to have report delay of cases so that a false peak would occur .",
    "\\(b ) for a city or region where the cumulative number of cases remains always small , it is diff@xmath50icult to observe a clear peak .",
    "in this case this approach does not apply .",
    "\\(c ) there is also a possibility to have multiple inflexion points due to new outbreaks , as is in the case of hong kong , singapore and canada .",
    "numerically , @xmath31 is calculated as @xmath51where @xmath52 is the number of @xmath53 averaged over two consecutive dates ( at and before the inflexion date ) . still using the log - normal function",
    ", we can relate the maximum @xmath54 and the date @xmath30 to @xmath41 and @xmath49 by  @xmath55 and @xmath56 where none of the constants depends on the details of the epidemic .",
    "first consider beijing .",
    "using the reported date as shown in fig [ fg1 ] , we identify april 27 to be the critical date since @xmath57 experiences an evident decrease after that date ( we also observe a decrease before april 25 , but that decrease is due to the report delay ) . using the reported date",
    "we have @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "hence  @xmath60 according to ( [ eqlll ] ) .",
    "this means that the initial date for irregular spread is april 3 . using  ( eq6 ) we predict @xmath30 and @xmath33 to be @xmath61 ( may 13 ) and @xmath62 , while according to the report , @xmath63 ( may 15 ) and @xmath64 .",
    "the predicted curve @xmath65 follows well the curve , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fg2 ] .            for hong kong",
    ", we observe three distinct inflexion points as can be seen in fig [ fg3 ] .",
    "the prediction using the information at the three inflexion points ( ip1 , ip2 , ip3 ) show that the predicted curve using the first inflexion point is the closest to the reported data ( fig .",
    "[ fg4 ] ) .",
    "more details can be seen in table 1 . in table 1 ,",
    "when there are multiple inflexion points , as is in the case for hong kong , singapore and canada , we use the information at the first inflexion point . in the case of singapore and canada , there are two maximums but we give information only for the first one .",
