    "the understanding of the physical processes which drive the galaxy mass built up and size accretion are among the most timely topics in galaxy evolution studies .",
    "massive early - type galaxies ( etgs ) are found to be much more compact in the past than in the present universe ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . at redshifts",
    "@xmath5 , while the massive star - forming disks have effective radii of several kpc ( @xcite ) , the quenched spheroids ( `` red nuggets '' ) have small effective radii of about 1 kpc .",
    "such red nuggets are thought to form through a chain of different processes : a ) accretion - driven violent disc instability , b ) dissipative contraction resulting in the formation of compact , star - forming `` blue nuggets '' , c ) quenching of star formation ( @xcite ) .",
    "after these processes occur , a gradual expansion in size of the red nuggets may take place , leading to the formation of the massive etgs we observe in the nearby universe .",
    "theoretical studies point to dry - mergers as the dominant mechanism for the size and stellar mass growth of very dense massive galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , minor mergers would provide a modest stellar mass accretion , but a strong evolution in galaxy size ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "mergers are believed to be common for very massive systems at high redshifts , with major merger rates ( mergers per galaxy per gyr ) in the range @xmath6 at @xmath7 and smaller than @xmath8 at @xmath9 ( @xcite ) .",
    "an alternative scenario explains the size evolution as the result of ( e.g. ) quasar feedback , rather than merging , making galaxies to puff up after a lost of large amounts of ( cold ) gas ( @xcite ) .    over cosmic time",
    ", one may expect that high - z compact galaxies evolve into present - day , massive , big galaxies .",
    "however , a fraction of these objects might survive intact till the present epoch , resulting in compact , relic systems in the nearby universe characterized by old stellar populations .",
    "recently there have been some efforts to search for massive compact galaxies at low redshifts ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and investigate further their dynamical and stellar population properties , as well as the role of environment on their properties ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .    in some theoretical models , that include the effect of galaxy mergers , the fraction of massive objects that would survive without undergoing any significant transformation since @xmath7 to the present could reach a fraction of about @xmath10 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . at `` low '' redshifts ( @xmath11 ) ,",
    "theoretical models predict a density of relic remnants in the range @xmath12 , which means that , in large surveys like the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , we might expect to find a few candidates in this redshift range .",
    "however , recent observational works have shown the paucity of old , super - compact ( @xmath13 kpc ) , massive ( @xmath14 ) galaxies in the local universe ( @xmath15 ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . indeed , ngc1277 , a nearby lenticular galaxy in the perseus cluster , is actually the only well - characterized , old system at @xmath16 , that might be a true relic galaxy ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "other candidates have been recently detected by @xcite , although only a few of them fulfill the above ( restrictive ) size and mass criteria ( @xmath13 kpc and @xmath17 ) , none of them being at @xmath18 .",
    "larger numbers of old compact systems have been found at lower masses ( @xmath19 ) , when relaxing the compactness selection criteria ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the ( almost ) lack of nearby super - compact , relic systems may represent a challenge for the current paradigm of galaxy formation ; in particular , we have to understand whether this lack is due to some observational bias , e.g. the limited spatial resolution of photometric data at @xmath16 ; a failure of theoretical predictions ; and/or an environmental effect , for which , as suggested by ngc1277 , relic galaxies might be more frequent in high - density cluster regions .",
    "in the intermediate redshift range ( @xmath20 ) , compacts have been recently investigated in detail by @xcite , who selected @xmath21 massive compacts from a sample of stellar - like objects within the 6373.2  sq .",
    "deg . of the boss survey",
    "; @xmath22 of these galaxies are dominated by old stellar populations , which make them reliable candidates to be the product of the unperturbed evolution of compact high  z systems .",
    "however , @xmath23 of these galaxies do not have measured which hampers the selection of such systems as truly compact objects .",
    "more recently , @xcite , have analyzed f814w hst images for the cosmos field , providing robust size measurements for a sample of 1599 compact systems in the range @xmath24 .",
    "other studies have performed detailed analysis of stellar populations and morphology of small samples of compact galaxies at these redshifts ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the population of dense passively evolving galaxies in this intermediate redshift range possibly represents a link between compact systems , dominating the massive quiescent galaxy population at high z , and their descendants in the nearby universe .",
    "indeed , large samples of compacts , with high - quality photometry ( to derive reliable structural parameters ) , and spectroscopic data , are actually necessary to better understand the formation and evolution of these systems .",
    "the kilo degree survey ( kids ; @xcite ) is one of the eso public surveys carried out with the vlt survey telescope ( vst ; @xcite ) equipped with the one square degree field of view and high angular resolution ( @xmath25 ) omegacam camera ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "kids is mainly designed for weak lensing studies , providing deep imaging in four optical bands ( @xmath26 ) , over a 1500 square degree of the sky with excellent seeing ( e.g. @xmath27 median fwhm in -band ) .",
    "the high image quality and deep photometry are ideal to investigate massive compact systems .    according to predictions from simulations ( @xcite )",
    ", we can expect to find @xmath28 relic per square degree , at redshift @xmath29 .",
    "this prediction does critically depend on the physical processes shaping size and mass evolution of galaxies , such as the relative importance of major and minor galaxy merging .",
    "several compact galaxy definitions have been adopted in the literature ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . in the present work",
    ", we present the properties of a sample of dense massive galaxy candidates in kids , defining as massive super - compact galaxies ( ) those early - type systems with @xmath30 and @xmath31 ( @xcite ) .",
    "these selection criteria are rather conservative , providing the ideal benchmark for galaxy evolution theories . the paper is organized as follows . in [ sec : sample ] we present the kids data sample and the selection of our photometrically selected compact galaxies . the main results , and in particular the evolution of number density as a function of redshift , are presented in [ sec : results ] .",
    "a discussion of the results and future prospects are outlined in [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "we adopt a cosmological model with @xmath32 , where @xmath33 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the galaxy sample presented in this work is based on the data included in the first and second data releases of kids presented in @xcite , which we address the interested reader for details .",
    "the total dataset includes 156 kids pointings ( 133 from the kids data release 2 ) , in which we have identified about 22 million sources including @xmath347 millions which have been classified as high quality extended sources ( mostly galaxy - like , see below ) .",
    "a full description of the galaxy sample is given in napolitano et al .",
    "( 2016 , in prep . ) . in the following section , we summarise the main steps for the galaxy selection procedure and the determination of galaxy physical quantities as structural parameters , photometric redshifts and stellar masses .",
    "we start from the kids multi - band source catalogs , where the photometry has been obtained with s - extractor ( @xcite ) in dual image mode , using as reference the positions of the sources detected in the -band images .",
    "while magnitudes are measured for all of the filters , the star / galaxy separation , positional and shape parameters are based on the -band data .",
    "the choice of -band is motivated by the fact that it typically has the best image quality and thus provides the most reliable source positions and shapes .",
    "critical areas as saturated pixels , star spikes , reflection halos , satellite tracks , etc . have been masked using both a dedicated automatic procedure and visual inspection .",
    "the total area after removing the borders of the individual kids pointings is 163.9 square degrees , while the unmasked effective area adopted is of 105.4 square degrees .",
    "star / galaxy separation is based on the distribution of the s - extractor parameters class_star and  ( signal - to- noise ratio ) of a number of sure stars ( see @xcite and @xcite for further details ) .",
    "we have further retained those sources which were marked as being out of critical area from our masking procedure . from the original catalog , the star / galaxy separation leaves @xmath35 million galaxies ,",
    "of which @xmath36 millions have high quality photometry being non - deblended sources located out of the masked area .    to perform accurate surface photometry and determine reliable structural parameters ,",
    "the highest - quality sources have been further selected ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus , we have finally gathered those systems with the highest  in the -band images , @xmath37 1/@xmath38 ( @xcite ; roy et al .",

    "* _ structural parameters . _",
    "surface photometry is performed using the 2dphot environment .",
    "2dphot is an automatic software designed to obtain both integrated and surface photometry of galaxies in wide - field images .",
    "the software first produces a local psf model from a series of identified _ sure stars_. this is done , for each galaxy , by fitting the four closest stars to that galaxy with a sum of three two - dimensional moffat functions .",
    "then galaxy snapshots are fitted with psf - convolved srsic models having elliptical isophotes plus a local background value ( see @xcite for further details ) .",
    "the fit provides the following parameters for the four wavebands : surface brightness @xmath43 , circularized effective radius , , srsic index , @xmath44 , total magnitude , @xmath45 , axis ratio , @xmath46 , and position angle . as it is common use in the literature , in the paper we use the circularized effective radius , , defined as @xmath47 , where  is the major - axis effective radius . * _ photometric redshifts .",

    "supervised methods , a knowledge sample is needed to train the neural network performing the mapping between magnitudes and redshift .",
    "the knowledge base consisted on spectroscopic redshift from the sloan digital sky survey data release 9 ( sdss - dr9 ; @xcite ) and galaxy and mass assembly data release 2 ( gama - dr2 ; @xcite ) which together provide redshifts up to @xmath48 .",
    "this knowledge base includes @xmath49 objects , 60% of which are used as training sample , and the remaining ones are used for the blind test set .",

    "we get galaxies with median circularized radius , @xmath68 , among the - , - and i - bands , less than @xmath69 .",
    "about 1300 compact candidates remain after this selection .",
    "best - fitted effective radii_. the best fitted structural parameters are considered , taking those systems with a reduced @xmath70 from 2dphot smaller than @xmath71 in ,  and i  filters ( @xcite ) . to avoid any accidental wrong fits we have also removed galaxies with unreasonable best - fitted parameters , applying a minimum value for the size ( @xmath72 arcsec ) , the srsic index ( @xmath73 ) and the axial ratio ( @xmath74 ) in all the bands .",
    "the minimum value in the srsic index has also allowed us to possibly remove misclassified stars , which are expected to be fitted by a box - like profile ( mimicked by a srsic profile with @xmath75 ) .",
    "these last criteria on the quality of the structural parameters reduce further the sample to the 106 highly reliable candidates .",
    "_ eye - ball check_. we have made an eyeball inspection of the images and residuals from srsic fitting of the candidates , with the aim of removing problematic objects or possible misclassified stars . to reduce subjectivity ,",
    "three of the authors have independently checked the images and graded them according to the following scheme :  are sure galaxies ,  are uncertain galaxies lacking a well - defined elliptical shape , and  are misclassified objects ( either stars or corrupted fits ) .",
    "the mean of the three classifications has been adopted as the final grade . in this way",
    ", we have retained those galaxies with a grade larger than @xmath76 , to include only systems graded by at least one of the observers as a sure galaxy .",

    "in particular , ,  and  magnitudes within @xmath40 of diameter are adopted for this purpose on those fields with coverage by the two surveys .",

    "the results are shown in [ fig : colour - colour ] .",
    "stars have blue @xmath80 colours ( i.e. , @xmath81 , see light blue shaded region in [ fig : colour - colour ] ) .",
    "we have also found four objects with @xmath81 and , indeed , are erroneously classified as galaxies .",
    "we take as compact candidates those systems with @xmath82 and @xmath83 ( see light - yellow shaded region in [ fig : colour - colour ] ) . for those galaxies with available viking photometry",

    ". however , the analysis of this class of objects is beyond the scope of the paper .    to perform an homogeneous comparison of the sample of our compact candidates with a sample of `` normal '' galaxies , using the same original catalog described in [ sec : sample ] , we have created two control samples ( ) of galaxies with similar stellar masses ( @xmath87 ) , the same lower limits on srsic index ( @xmath88 ) , axis ratio ( @xmath89 ) and   ( @xmath90 arcsec ) as those for the compact systems , but without applying any compactness criterion .",
    "the first   consists of all galaxies , with no restriction on the galaxy type , while the    consists of etgs , classified as described in [ sec : sample ] .",
    "we start by summarizing the sample we are left with for our analysis : after the first three criteria we have selected 106 candidates , which are reduced to 96 after the eye - ball check in ( iv ) .",
    "the matching with viking included 46 candidates and , after applying the criterion ( v ) , we are left with a sample of 42 out 46 galaxy candidates ( i.e. 4/46 objects are likely stars according to their optical - nir colours , corresponding to a @xmath91 contamination ) . updating the total number , we are left with 92 candidates , of which @xmath92 further sources from the region that does not overlap with viking might be stars .",
    "this corresponds to a density of @xmath93 compact galaxies per square degree , cumulatively for @xmath94 , while we do not find objects at @xmath95 .",
    "in contrast , @xcite find 29 secure  at @xmath4 within the sdss area , using our same criteria .",
    "however , only one of these is at very low redshift ( @xmath96 ) , and none of them features old stellar populations ( @xcite ) , and thus they can not actually be classified as relics .",
    "the absence of compact systems at @xmath97 in our datasample might be related to environmental issues , since in the current kids area we are missing nearby clusters of galaxies , where a larger fraction of compact galaxies is predicted ( @xcite ) , and seems to be observed indeed ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "a similar environment effect would be present in the @xcite sample .",
    "examples of the 2d fitting results for four candidates are presented in [ fig:2d ] , where postage stamps of the galaxy images and the residuals are shown .",
    "[ fig : hist ] shows the distributions of redshift , axis ratio , srsic index , effective radius , stellar mass and surface mass density for our sample of compact candidates .",
    "the median redshift of the sample is @xmath98 , with an rms of @xmath99 , larger than the median redshifts of the  and  ( @xmath100 and @xmath101 , respectively ) .",
    "compact candidates have a median r - band effective radius of @xmath102 kpc ( rms=0.31 kpc ) , a srsic index of @xmath103 ( rms=2.3 ) , an axis ratio of 0.40 ( rms=0.14 ) and median stellar mass of @xmath104 dex ( rms=0.09 ) . on the contrary , for the   the median size , srsic index , axis ratio and  are @xmath105 kpc , 4.7 , 0.73 and @xmath106 dex , respectively",
    ". finally , if the  is considered , the median size , srsic index , axis ratio and are @xmath107 kpc , 5.5 , 0.75 and @xmath108 dex , respectively .",
    "thus , smaller sizes translate into shallower light profiles ( smaller @xmath44 ) when compacts are compared with normal galaxies ( consistently with the galaxy merging framework in @xcite ) .",
    "compact candidates also present lower axis ratios than normal galaxies .",
    "these elongated shapes are common in massive compact galaxies , both at high - z ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , and at lower redshifts ( @xcite ) .    in our compact sample ,",
    "the average surface mass density within 1  is @xmath109 ( rms of @xmath110 ) , about 2 orders of magnitude larger than the average surface mass density of the .",
    "this median density is a bit larger than the range of values of @xmath111 found in 4 compact galaxies at @xmath97 by @xcite , but the values are consistent within the scatter . taking the only 3 galaxies from @xcite , which satisfy the same criteria we are adopting in this paper , we find a median density of @xmath112 , which is fully consistent with our result .",

    "the compact candidates are plotted with a random subset of @xmath113 galaxies from the  . as the compact candidates are selected to have small sizes , they lie in a region of the size - mass diagram where very few objects are detected , which provides a further evidence in favor of the rarity of these compact objects at @xmath114 ( [ fig : size_mass ] ; @xcite ) . in [ fig : size_mass ] we also overplot the @xmath97 galaxies in @xcite and the three @xmath7 galaxies in @xcite which fullfil our selection criteria .",
    "the evolution with redshift of the sizes , magnitudes and colours are shown in [ fig : vari_vs_z ] .",
    "the s look quite constant as a function of redshift for the compact systems . at all the redshifts , almost all the compacts have faint  when compared with the control sample population ( middle panel in [ fig : vari_vs_z ] ) .",
    "we find that 75 candidates ( @xmath115 of the whole sample ) lie below the r - band magnitude completeness limit of @xmath116 , implying that our sample is complete up to redshift @xmath117 .",
    "finally , most of the galaxies populate the red - sequence , and are the best candidates to be remnants of high - z red nuggets ( right panel in [ fig : vari_vs_z ] ) .",
    "58 out of 92 galaxies have old ages consistent with a formation redshift @xmath118 , and so could be the remnants of the compact galaxies observed at @xmath119 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "82 out of 92 galaxies ( i.e. @xmath120 of the whole sample ) are best fitted by an elliptical template , and are classified as etgs ( see [ sec : sample ] ) .",
    "the rest of the galaxies have redshifts @xmath121 and have colours which are best - fitted by sbc models .",
    "however , particularly at these redshifts , one should take this colour - based classification with caution , as a spectroscopic follow - up is actually needed to perform an accurate stellar population analysis .",
    "we have finally cross - matched our sample of candidates with sdss and gama spectroscopy catalogs , finding spectra for 9 of the selected candidates .",
    "one of the main systematics in our selection of compact galaxies is induced by wrong redshift determinations , which can affect both the ( linear ) effective radii and stellar masses , moving the compact out of our selection criteria ( e.g. , see [ fig : size_mass ] and [ fig : vari_vs_z ] ) . 7 out 9 of these systems",
    "are included in the sdss+gama datasample used for photometric redshift determinations ( see [ sec : sample ] ) : 5 in the training sample and 2 in the test sample .",
    "although the photometric redshifts are shown to approximate quite well the spectroscopic ones ( see [ sec : sample ] and @xcite ) , we note that almost all of the photometric redshifts are underestimated with respect to the spectroscopic value .",
    "the median difference @xmath122 is @xmath123 , which increases to @xmath124 if the galaxies not in the training sample are considered .",
    "this systematics can be probably related to the under - sampling of this galaxy population , just 5 galaxies in the training sample , which can fail the optimum training of the network , and the quality of photometric redshift outcomes is degraded .",
    "as first test , we have re - computed the sizes and stellar masses of these 9 objects using the .",
    "only 4 galaxies survive to the size and mass selection criteria , i.e. @xmath125 ( 1 not in the training sample ) .    despite the small sample available for this test",
    ", we can not exclude the presence of a systematics of the photometric redshift determination for compact sources which we might quantify of the order of @xmath126 .",
    "qualitatively , if the spectroscopic redshift is larger than photometric one , then  in physical scale gets larger .",
    "the effect on  is not as simple as the one on . as an exercise",
    ", we have investigated the impact of a redshift error of @xmath127 on the 83 galaxies in the sample without spectroscopic redshift . using re - calculated values for  and stellar mass",
    ", we find that 26 of the sources ( 31% ) survive the cuts .",
    "therefore , a spectroscopic follow - up will be needed to finally confirm the nature of these galaxies , allowing us to classify these candidates as compact or very - compact galaxies .",
    "increasing the knowledge base and the population of compact systems with measured spectroscopic redshifts will improve the quality of the photometric redshift estimates .",
    "a big improvement of our analysis with respect to previous works on compact galaxies at similar redshift ranges ( e.g. @xcite ) is the high-  photometry which allows us to derive robust structural parameters and obtain the first determination of colour profiles for these systems .",
    "therefore , following @xcite , we define the colour gradient as the angular coefficient of the relation @xmath128 vs. @xmath129 , @xmath130 , measured in @xmath131 ( omitted in the following unless needed for clarity ) .",
    "the fit of each color profile is performed in the range @xmath132 , where the effective radius is measured in the -band . by definition , a positive cg , @xmath133 ,",
    "means that a galaxy is redder as @xmath134 increases , while it is bluer outward for a negative gradient .",
    "psf - convolved srsic profiles in - , - and i - band are used and , in particular , @xmath135 , @xmath136 and @xmath137 colours are discussed .",
    "we omit detailed analysis in terms of redshift and stellar mass , but we pinpoint what is the range of colour gradients in our galaxy sample , comparing these results with the  and some previous literature .    on average , compact population has @xmath138 ( rms 0.52 ) , @xmath139 ( rms 0.59 ) and @xmath140 ( rms 0.73 ) which are substantially consistent with the gradients for the control population of etgs which are @xmath141 ( rms 0.33 ) , @xmath142 ( rms 0.23 ) and @xmath143 ( rms 0.40 ) .",
    "hence , compact candidates look quite similar to normal etgs , except for the scatter , which is partially or totally related to the larger uncertainties on the structural parameters in our small objects .",
    "these results agree with previously reported ranges of color gradients of passively evolving massive galaxies at low- or intermediate - z ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) or at high - z ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and with simulations ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "finally , we find that 30 compact candidates have all negative colour gradients , 9 have positive gradients , while the rest of the sample have at least one of the three gradients with a different sign with respect to the others .",
    "this wide range of behaviours demonstrate that these objects can be formed in quite different initial conditions ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .      the number density of compact massive galaxies as a function of redshift is an important constraint on models of galaxy assembly . in recent years",
    "there have been different efforts to produce a census of such systems in different redshift bins ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "sample size is a crucial aspect to increase the constraining power .",
    "if the compact galaxies found in the present work are a representative subsample of the whole population of compacts over the whole area of 1500  sq .",
    "deg . that will be mapped by the kids survey",
    ", we expect to increase the present sample by a factor of ten in the next few years .",
    "for what concerns our current sample , we have binned galaxies with respect to redshift and normalized to the comoving volume corresponding to the observed kids sky area , where @xmath144 ( @xmath145  sq .",
    "deg . ) is the full sky area and @xmath146 is the effective kids - dr2 area .",
    "then , the density is derived by dividing for the comoving volume corresponding to each redshift bin . ] .",
    "the errors on number counts take into account fluctuations due to poisson noise , as well as those due to large - scale structure ( i.e. the cosmic variance ) : they are calculated with the online cosmicvariancecalculatortrenti / cosmicvariance.html ] tool ( @xcite ) .",
    "the cosmic variance increases the poissonian error budget by @xmath147 .",
    "the total relative error on abundances ( i.e. number densities ) amounts to @xmath148 .    in [ fig : density_vs_z ] we plot the redshift evolution of the abundance of compact galaxies ( left panel ) and that for the subsample of systems with old photometric ages ( i.e. formation redshift @xmath149 ; right panel ) .",
    "we consider these potentially old , as candidate remnants of the compact etgs found at high redshift by several studies ( see [ sec : intro ] ) .",
    "we also re - determine the abundances by accounting for possible systematics in the photometric redshifts ( see [ subsec : wrong_z ] ; see grey symbols in [ fig : density_vs_z ] ) .",
    "we remind the reader that our sample starts to be incomplete at @xmath150 ( see vertical dashed lines ) .    in the left panel of [ fig : density_vs_z ] , we plot number densities for the whole sample of kids compacts , independent of the galaxy formation redshift .",
    "our number densities are compared with estimates from @xcite , for the number density of stellar - like objects having spectroscopic redshifts from boss - dr10 ( @xcite ) and with three different cuts in total dynamical mass ,  ( @xmath151 , @xmath152 , and @xmath153 , respectively ; see [ fig : density_vs_z ] ) .",
    "notice that objects in the @xcite sample are not classified according to either morphology or galaxy age , nor do they have an accurate estimate of the intrinsic . hence , their selection may be missing compact systems that are actually spatially resolved in boss - dr10 . on the other hand ,",
    "since @xcite also include compacts with @xmath154 and are selected with respect to , rather than , it is not surprising , perhaps , that those abundance estimates are larger than ours .",
    "in fact , if we consider the abundance estimate of massive boss targets with @xmath155 kpc and @xmath156 from @xcite ( see purple triangle in the left panel of [ fig : density_vs_z ] ) , the number density of compacts in the lowest redshift bin ( @xmath157 ) is @xmath158 , in much better agreement with our density estimate of @xmath159 for the same redshift bin .",
    "on the other hand , selecting galaxies with @xmath160 kpc in kids , would lead to abundances @xmath161 dex larger than for @xmath162 kpc , still in good agreement with estimates for stellar - like objects from @xcite .",
    "the yellow region in the left panel of [ fig : density_vs_z ] plots number densities for galaxies in the cosmos survey @xcite . remarkably , no evolution with redshift is found , for both kids and cosmos samples , although , surprisingly , abundances for cosmos ( on average @xmath163 ) are about one order of magnitude larger than our kids estimates . since @xcite claim to find consistent density estimates between cosmos and boss ( the latter having an area 4000 times larger than cosmos )",
    ", cosmic variance seems not to be responsible for the above discrepancy .",
    "however , we can not exclude that galaxy environment , which might be the actual driver of the number density of compact relics at @xmath16 ( see , e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , may be different for galaxies in the kids - dr2 and cosmos areas  an issue that will be addressed in forthcoming extensions of the present work .",
    "the results for photometrically old  ( right panel of [ fig : density_vs_z ] ) are first compared with estimates for @xmath164 compact galaxies from @xcite , who selected samples with two cuts in  ( @xmath165 and @xmath152 , respectively ; see [ fig : density_vs_z ] ) . as for the left panel , there are differences in the selection criteria that make a direct comparison not trivial . however , the trends for both boss and kids samples look qualitatively similar , with a very mild evolution with redshift in the range where our kids sample is complete .",
    "moreover , as noticed above , for boss compacts with @xmath166 , the @xcite abundance estimates are fairly consistent with ours , within the uncertainties .",
    "finally , we compare  number densities with predictions from semi - analytical models   ( sams ) . @xcite have determined the evolution of the abundance of compact galaxies from sams based on millennium n - body simulations ( @xcite ) , where relic compacts are defined as galaxies which have barely increased their stellar mass between @xmath167 and @xmath168 .",
    "operatively , they selected from the merger tree those objects that have increased their mass since @xmath169 by less than 10% and 30% , respectively , i.e. galaxies whose mass at @xmath170 is larger than 90% and 70% of the mass limit applied to select compacts .",
    "our results are consistent in the lowest redshift bin with @xcite for simulated galaxies which have increased their mass at most by @xmath171 , while we estimate lower densities than in simulations at higher redshift .",
    "however , similarly to what discussed for the comparison to boss estimates , theoretical predictions should be actually considered as upper limits , as @xcite did not apply any precise selection in size , since the resolution in the simulations does not allow reliable estimates of galaxy effective radii to be obtained .",
    "we also compare our findings to results from the hydrodynamical illustris simulation of @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite select 35 massive and compact galaxies at @xmath169 and follow their evolution to @xmath172 .",
    "only 1 out of these 35 systems evolves into a galaxy that satisfies our mass and size criteria at @xmath173 .",
    "this corresponds to a number density of @xmath174 , which is consistent with the abundances of compact galaxies that have accreted less than 10% of their final mass from the millenium simulations . as a further caveat here ,",
    "we point out that in our selection we adopt the same mass cutoff value at all redshifts , while simulations perform the mass selection at @xmath172 , implying that at high redshifts , simulated galaxies with masses smaller than the @xmath172 cutoff value are actually included in the analysis .",
    "this is another reason why one may expect that predicted number densities for compacts at high redshift are actually higher than the observed ones .    at redshifts @xmath11 , in the left panel of [ fig : density_vs_z ] , we see a lack of candidates .",
    "this seems to contrast the results of @xcite who found 29 secure  at @xmath97 fulfilling our same criteria , all of them having young ages @xmath175 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "however , one should notice that out of the 29  of @xcite , only one is at redshift @xmath176 , still pointing to the extreme paucity of such systems in the nearby universe , consistent with our result .",
    "similarly , @xcite found one possible old  at low redshift , using a more relaxed criterion for the size , than the one we adopt here .",
    "@xcite have found a sample of 76 compact galaxies from sdss at @xmath177 , which resemble quiescent galaxies at high - z , i.e. systems with small effective radii and large velocity dispersions .",
    "if we consider their compacts with @xmath155 kpc and @xmath178 , 1 galaxy at @xmath96 and 6 galaxies at @xmath179 are left when the effective radius from a de vaucouleurs profile is used .",
    "instead , these numbers change to 1 galaxy at @xmath96 and only 1 at @xmath179 if a srsic profile is fitted .",
    "these numbers correspond to abundances of @xmath180 in the redshift range @xmath181 , and @xmath182 and @xmath183 at @xmath184 , if de vaucouleurs or srsic profile are fitted , respectively . as mentioned in [ sec : intro ] , these findings seem to trouble the current hierarchical paradigm of galaxy formation , where some relic systems at @xmath16 are actually expected to be found . in contrast ,",
    "@xcite have found 4 galaxies fulfilling our same criteria ( corresponding to @xmath185 of their sample galaxies with masses larger than @xmath186 ) , and all of these galaxies are old , with mass - weighted ages older than @xmath187 .",
    "these numbers translate into a very large abundance of @xmath188 .",
    "recently , @xcite added a new brick to the story , finding one relic compact in the perseus cluster , i.e. ngc 1277 , reconciling the observations at @xmath11 with predictions from simulations .",
    "all these results point to an overabundance of  in dense cluster regions , that are actually under - represented over the area currently mapped by kids .    as discussed in [ subsec : wrong_z ] , the sample of would be reduced significantly in size by systematics in the redshift determination .",
    "[ fig : density_vs_z ] `` corrects '' the abundance estimates for the possible systematics in redshift .",
    "the corrected abundances ( see gray boxes and lines in [ fig : density_vs_z ] ) should be seen as our current lower limit on number densities of smcgs in kids .",
    "this issue will be addressed by on - going spectroscopic follow - up of , and discussed in details in a future paper .",
    "thanks to the large area covered , high image quality , excellent spatial resolution and seeing , the kilo degree survey ( kids ) provides a unique dataset to study the properties of super - compact massive galaxies ( )  a family of systems which plays a key role into our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution .    in this paper",
    ", we present a sample of candidate  , based on 156  sq .  deg . of kids , in four optical bands ( , ,  and i ) .",
    "we start from a sample of @xmath189 million galaxies with high- , measured photometry and structural parameters in all the four bands . for a subsample of these galaxies",
    ", we have used the kids photometry to estimate : 1 ) photometric redshifts based on machine learning techniques ( @xcite ; @xcite ) ; 2 ) structural parameters using the software 2dphot ( @xcite ) ; 3 ) stellar masses , fitting colours with sps model predictions .",
    "the resulting sample is @xmath190 complete down to an -band magnitude @xmath191 , and down to a stellar mass of @xmath192 , up to a redshift @xmath193 .",
    "we select the most massive ( @xmath194 ) and most compact ( @xmath195 ) galaxies with ( photometric ) redshift @xmath114 .",
    "we remove star contaminants by performing a visual inspection of the final sample of candidates and then , for galaxies with available near - ir photometry from viking - dr1 , we combine optical+nir photometry to reduce the fraction of contaminants .",
    "the final sample consists of 92 compact candidates , with a number density of @xmath93 compact galaxies per square degree , at @xmath196 .",
    "nine candidates have spectroscopic information from sdss and gama surveys , that is used to assess the systematics in the redshift determination of our sample . on average ,",
    "compact galaxies have negative colour gradients which are similar to the ones for normal passively evolving galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , the variety of gradients , to be confirmed with a spectroscopic follow - up of the present sample , seems to suggest that compact galaxies formed under a wide range of initial conditions ( @xcite ) .",
    "we also discuss the evolution with redshift of the number density of compact systems , and in particular that for the oldest galaxies , which are possibly remnants of the high - redshift ( @xmath197 ) compact population detected by many studies .",
    "remarkably , we do not find any  candidate at @xmath11 .",
    "this finding , which is consistent with the recent studies , might be related to the effect of galaxy environment on the abundance of compact systems ( see sec .  1 ) .",
    "although observational studies at intermediate- and high - z do not point to a clear picture of how environment affects galaxy sizes ( see @xcite and references therein ) , recent cosmological simulations predict a larger fraction of massive compact systems in high- than in low - density regions ( @xcite ) .",
    "this prediction is supported by the fact that ngc1277  the only well - characterized compact , massive , etg at @xmath16  resides in the core region of a nearby rich cluster of galaxies ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the absence of compact galaxies at @xmath4 could be related to the smaller fraction of dense structures in the area currently mapped by kids .",
    "we plan to have 10 times more compact candidates at the end of the kids survey , when all the 1500  sq .",
    "deg . will have been observed .",
    "only nine of our candidates have a spectroscopic coverage at the moment .",
    "thus , a spectroscopic follow - up is actually necessary , to fully validate and characterize our sample , and determine accurate number densities to be compared with theoretical expectations .",
