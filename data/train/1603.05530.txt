    "we consider 1-dimensional quantum barriers of compact support , often referred to as cut - off potentials , and the solutions to the corresponding time - independent @xmath0 equation . besides the real - energy solutions , namely the bound states ( negative discrete spectrum ) and the scattering states ( positive continuum spectrum ) or `` dirac kets '' , of well - known physical meaning , there exists a much larger set of complex - energy solutions .",
    "these solutions may be obtained by analytic continuation of the dirac kets to the whole complex plane . when so doing , a discrete set of resonant solutions ( gamow states ) arises embedded in the sea of the general `` background solutions '' @xcite .",
    "asymptotically the gamow states feature only either outgoing or incoming plane waves with ( complex ) momenta corresponding to poles of the s - matrix .",
    "we notice that in the complex - momentum plane ( which is isomorphic to a two - riemann - sheet complex - energy plane ) , the bound states correspond to momenta in the positive imaginary axis , their mirror momenta in the negative imaginary axis corresponding to the anti - bound states . both bound and anti - bound momenta are also poles of the s - matrix .",
    "one should also notice that the resonances , the background and the anti - bound solutions exhibit an exponential spatial growth that places them far outside the hilbert space @xmath1 .    in the calculation of inner products between states of the continuum spectrum with real momentum , integrals of the type    @xmath2    arise @xcite@xcite .",
    "these integrals can be regularized by adding to @xmath3 a small imaginary part @xmath4 , which ensures the convergence of ( 1 ) , and then letting @xmath5 .",
    "the result is meaningful as a distribution @xcite given by the well - known sokhotski - plemelj formula    @xmath6    for freely propagating plane waves with momenta @xmath7 and @xmath8 , the simpler integral    @xmath9    arises and yields the usual result @xmath10 .",
    "continuing @xmath11 in ( 1 ) to the complex plane , namely defining @xmath12 , requires further regularization of the integral as long as it generally diverges for @xmath13 .",
    "we adopt the widely used gaussian regularization @xcite@xcite    @xmath14    which is directly related to ( 7.1.2 ) in @xcite , where @xmath15 .",
    "the limit @xmath16 is taken afterwards .",
    "notice that , when completing a square in the exponent of the integrand in ( 4 ) and changing the integration variable to @xmath17 , one obtains the intermediate expression @xmath18 the integral representation ( 7.1.2 ) is convergent when the path of the complex integration variable @xmath19 approaches @xmath20 along a direction @xmath21 .",
    "this condition is fulfilled by ( 5 ) for any finite @xmath22 . however , in ( 4 ) the limit @xmath16 ( and hence @xmath23 ) not always can be taken before the integration is carried out , because the function @xmath24 does not converge uniformly to the function @xmath25 when @xmath16 .",
    "for i m @xmath26 the limit can be taken in the integrand in ( 4 ) because the finiteness of the integral is always assured by the convergence factor @xmath27 , trivially yielding @xmath28 . in this case",
    "@xmath29 converges to @xmath30 when @xmath16 .    for real @xmath31 the result ( 2 )",
    "is obtained .    for i",
    "m @xmath32 the integration and the limit @xmath16 do not commute , in which case we adopt the limit of the integral as a prescription . in the right - hand side of ( 4 ) , the limit @xmath16 can be directly inferred from ( 7.1.23 ) in @xcite , namely @xmath33 therefore ( 4 ) yields an extension of @xmath34 to a new region of the lower half complex plane , namely @xmath35 the domain @xmath36 where @xmath34 is finite is thus the complex plane @xmath37 minus a wedge in the lower half plane that includes the point @xmath38 .",
    "we call @xmath39 for short .",
    "interpreting @xmath11 in ( 2 ) as a distribution means that    @xmath40    on a set of test functions @xmath41 . notice that the integration on the real axis @xmath42 is involved in this definition .    likewise , interpreting ( 7 ) as a distribution requires prescribing a set of test functions and an integration path in the complex plane .",
    "consider a ( finite or infinite ) path @xmath43 and the set of analytic functions @xmath44 which are integrable along @xmath45 . then    @xmath46    and ( 9 ) defines a functional trivially involving @xmath47 in a strict function sense .    we now show that , for paths @xmath48 albeit for crossing the singular point @xmath38 , @xmath49 still has a meaning as a distribution in the enlarged sense above .",
    "in fact , we can divert @xmath45 , so as to fully keep it within @xmath36 , by deforming it to a new path @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the path @xmath45 stripped of a segment of length @xmath52 centered in @xmath38 , @xmath53 is a half - circle of radius @xmath54 connecting the two parts of @xmath51 and circling @xmath38 from above , and then letting @xmath5 ( fig.1 ) .",
    "this is equivalent to shifting the path @xmath45 upwards by the amount @xmath55 .",
    "where the set of test functions is defined.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    the result @xmath56 lets us interpreting @xmath57 as a distribution for integration paths @xmath43 and crossing @xmath38 .",
    "notice also that , according to ( 7 ) , for @xmath58 the apex of the divergence wedge of @xmath49 is at the point @xmath59 .",
    "similarly , for paths @xmath45 in the domain @xmath60 ( @xmath61 minus a wedge in the upper half plane containing @xmath38 ) and crossing also @xmath38 we have @xmath62    the complex generalization of ( 3 ) is equally clear - cut .",
    "for @xmath58 the apex of the divergent wedge of @xmath63 is at the point @xmath55 , so that the regular domain of @xmath64 contains the point @xmath38 , although in the limit @xmath65 the wedges pinch this point and the domain @xmath66 again excludes @xmath38 ( fig.2 ) .     and",
    "avoiding the divergence wedges.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    we then have @xmath67 for paths @xmath68 and crossing @xmath38 when going from the left half to the right half of the complex plane ( which are a reminder of the real @xmath69 to @xmath70 integration ) .",
    "the results in the previous sections can be attained along the more traditional lines of derivation of the sokhotski - plemelj formula involving real integrations @xcite .",
    "this provides a complementary insight that may be useful in some applications .",
    "we re - derive the formula , as displayed in ( 2 ) , albeit for the real line @xmath71 tilted by a fixed angle @xmath72 in the complex plane , namely by writing @xmath73 , where @xmath74 and @xmath75 initially ( fig.3 ) .",
    "we again add an imaginary part @xmath76 to @xmath3 , so that @xmath77 and interpret it as a distribution when letting @xmath5 .",
    "again we write the denominator of ( 13 ) in polar form @xmath78 where , for the complex @xmath3 defined above , @xmath79 the first term in the right - hand side of ( 15 ) has a discontinuity at @xmath80 that just compensates for the one of the step function @xmath81 , so that ( 15 ) is a continuous function of @xmath82 , ranging from @xmath83 to @xmath72 for @xmath82 going from @xmath69 to @xmath70 , and becoming discontinuous for @xmath65 , namely @xmath84 taking the logarithm of ( 14 ) we have @xmath85 and differentiating it with respect to @xmath3 we obtain @xmath86 the derivatives in ( 18 ) can be worked out by taking into account that @xmath87 , but they are cumbersome and of little interest . taking the limit @xmath65 and recalling ( 16 ) we obtain the simple expression @xmath88 albeit for the constant factor @xmath89 , ( 19 ) is the sokhotski - plemelj formula for the real variable @xmath82 , being therefore meaningful as a distribution on test functions @xmath90 .",
    "the derivation of ( 19 ) above is actually valid for @xmath91 , namely for straight integration paths crossing the origin and sweeping almost the whole complex plane .",
    "however ( 13 ) holds only for @xmath92 , that is , for @xmath75 .",
    "extending the usual dirac delta orthogonality between eigenstates of the continuum real energy and momentum to the so called `` background solutions '' , which are the continuation of the former to the complex momentum plane , entails a corresponding complex generalization of the dirac delta ( dd ) distribution .",
    "this can be done by adopting a gaussian regularization of the integral representation , arising when computing inner products generally involving background and resonant solutions .",
    "in fact , the gaussian convergence factor is able to cope with the space exponential growth of these solutions .",
    "we have seen that the distributions cauchy principal value ( cpv ) of @xmath93 and the dd , originally defined for real variables , admit an extension to the complex plane , namely @xmath94 and @xmath95 , on the space of test functions @xmath44 which are analytic and integrable on paths @xmath45 crossing the point @xmath38 . under these definitions , the sokhotski - plemelj ( sp ) formula has a natural extension to the whole complex plane",
    ". however , the gaussian regularization of the usual integral representations yields the sp formula only for integration paths @xmath96 , where the domains @xmath36 and @xmath97 are the complex plane @xmath98 minus wedge - shaped regions where the integrals diverge upon removing the regularization .",
    "this is the main result of this paper .",
    "regularizations more powerful than the gaussian one might exist that yield a regular domain even larger than @xmath99 , perhaps almost the whole @xmath98 .    the above definition of the extension of generalized functions to the complex plane , referred to line integrals of test functions , is alternative to the traditional one by gelfand et al .",
    "( see the vol.i , app .",
    "b of @xcite ) , in which the generalized functions act on the test functions through surface ( or @xmath100-volume , for @xmath101 variables ) complex integrals with the differential form @xmath102 .",
    "in that case the sp formula might not have any immediate and useful meaning .",
    "thinking the complex extension of distributions in terms of line integrals rather than of surface integrals was already implicit in @xcite , and is more suited for some problems of scattering theory .",
    "in fact , an application of the above result is the following : the scattering solutions ( continuum spectrum of real positive energy @xmath103 ) for a potential barrier are mutually dd - orthogonal and , if no bound states occur , also yield a complete basis of the hilbert space . in any case , the operator @xmath104 is idempotent ( i.e. it is a projector ) accordingly .",
    "consider now paths @xmath105 with maximum slope within the interval @xmath106 , and the set of background solutions with momenta @xmath107 , so that @xmath108 for any @xmath109 else",
    ". then our result leads to an analogous dd - orthogonality @xmath110 between these background states , and hence @xmath111 is a projector as well .",
    "this turns useful in the search for expansions of wave functions and operators in terms of resonances and background states @xcite @xcite ."
