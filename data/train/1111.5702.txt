    "since its recent discovery @xcite , graphene ( a single layer of carbon atoms ) has been attracting a lot of interest , due to its unique band structure , which is gapless and exhibits an approximately linear dispersion relation at two inequivalent points of the reciprocal space ( labeled as @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) in the vicinity of the fermi energy .",
    "the linearity of the band structure allows one to describe the carriers close to the @xmath0 and @xmath1 points in a continuum model , using the dirac equation with massless particles@xcite . because of the well known klein tunneling effect in graphene , which prevents electrical confinement of electrons , the lateral confinement of dirac carriers is a big challenge in manufacturing graphene - based electronic devices@xcite .",

    "for smaller dots , the agreement between these two models becomes clearly worse .",
    "for instance , an energy gap @xmath75 is found for very small hexagons ( i.e. @xmath101 ) within tbm , whereas in the case of the continuum model such a gap is extremely small . as a consequence ,",
    "the continuum model overestimates the dos at @xmath95 as the dot size decreases , since it exhibits a plateau in the energy as a function of the eigenstate index in the vicinity of @xmath95 even for smaller @xmath96 , where tbm results show a gap in the energy spectrum .",

    "therefore , in the continuum model for @xmath102 , the finite elements problem is ill - defined , where the constructed matrix of the finite mesh elements in this case is singular ( zero inverse ) , leading to spurious solutions around @xmath95 . as the size of the dot increases , the gap in the tbm results quickly reduces to zero and a zero energy level for the hexagonal flakes with",
