    "cavity quantum electro dynamics ( qed )  @xcite has experienced a tremendous progress during the last decades . in experiments where atoms interact with a cavity field",
    ", the lifetimes of both the cavity and atomic states can be made rather long , up to tens of milliseconds .",
    "this makes it possible to carry out several operations on the combined system before decoherence plays an influential role .",
    "it is also possible to single out a unique atomic transition to interact with only one cavity mode , implying that only two atomic states @xmath0 and @xmath1 together with one electro - magnetic mode @xmath2 need to be taken into account , while other atomic states and modes are neglected . in such situations , the jaynes - cummings ( jc ) model  @xcite has proven to be remarkably well suited for describing the coherent interaction .",
    "cavity qed has thus become one of the candidates for implementing quantum information processing , see for example @xcite and it has also turned out to be a very useful tool for studying purely quantum mechanical phenomena , such as sub - poissonian fock states  @xcite and schrdinger cat states  @xcite .",
    "the simple jc model is not , however , always valid .",
    "for example , if the atom s kinetic energy is of the same order of magnitude as the atom - cavity interaction energy , the dynamics is significantly changed  @xcite .",
    "thus , for very cold atoms , the kinetic energy term for the atomic center - of - mass motion must be treated quantum mechanically . in the standard jc model ,",
    "the atom is either assumed to stay still relative to the cavity mode , or to have a large kinetic energy ; in both cases the atomic motion is described classically and the kinetic - energy term may be excluded from the hamiltonian .",
    "another simplification of the jc model is that the spatial shape of the cavity mode is not taken into account and it is assumed constant .",
    "this is , of course , not always valid , since an atom traversing a cavity will see a mode that varies with respect to the atomic position .",
    "the mode variation is given by the particular shape of the electric field and is , therefore , space dependent .",
    "the proper approach in such a case is to introduce an atom - field coupling that is position - dependent @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the dipole moment of the atomic transition and @xmath5 is the electric field of the cavity mode involved . for a smooth coupling and small velocities ,",
    "the atoms see the cavity mode as an effective potential which is , in the adiabatic limit , given by @xmath6 , here @xmath7 is the atom - cavity detuning .",
    "consequently , the atom experiences an effective force from the potential and it may , for instance , be reflected or transmitted by the cavity  @xcite or even trapped inside it  @xcite .",
    "the situation in which the atom experiences both an effective cavity potential and an external potential has also been discussed @xcite .",
    "today it is possible to trap ions inside cavities even using external traps  @xcite , which open up new possibilities for realizing certain desirable systems .",
    "the shape of the cavity mode depends on the boundaries of the cavity , the most commonly considered being gaussian , standing wave , travelling waves in ring cavities , and whispering - gallery modes .",
    "we consider here a standing wave mode with a wave number @xmath8 , @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the scaled strength of the coupling .",
    "for such a system , an extended jc model including atomic centre of mass motion and a standing wave coupling has been studied in a large number of papers , here we just mention a few .",
    "the dynamics has been analysed in , for example , @xcite , while in  @xcite , approximation methods are used , such as raman - nath , bragg , tight - binding or large detuning . in the raman - nath approximation , the kinetic energy term is neglected , and this has been assumed in refs .",
    "@xcite , where effects from various measurements on the field or the atom have been studied .    clearly , with a standing wave coupling , the hamiltonian is periodic with period @xmath11 .",
    "the spectra of periodic hamiltonians are known to consist of allowed energies in forms of bands , separated by forbidden gaps .",
    "they are most commonly treated using the floquet theory , which has been done , for example , in refs .",
    "an interesting observation is that the brilluin zone is now twice as wide as in the usual case for one dimensional periodic hamiltonians .",
    "this derives from the fact that the two atomic levels are coupled to the motion , in contrast to electrons in solid crystals where electronic spin flips are not coupled to the lattice potential . in an atom - cavity system , every time the atom absorbs or emits a photon and gets a momentum kick , its internal state @xmath12 is also changed .",
    "hence , in the rotating wave approximation , an emission ( absorption ) must take place between two absorptions ( emissions ) .",
    "the symmetry of the system is , therefore , generated by displacement of half the spatial period accompanied by an atomic inversion ( performing this twice yields the spatial periodicity of the hamiltonian ) , which renders the brillouin zone ( in momentum space ) twice as wide .    in solid state physics , it has proved useful to describe an electron propagating within a periodic structure in terms of a dispersion relation @xmath13 where @xmath14 is called the quasi - momentum of the state and @xmath15 is an index for the electronic band ; in this picture the electron is considered to move freely , with its propagation characteristics defined by the dispersion relations . here , as below , we set planck s constant @xmath16 . if the electronic wave function is represented by a ( gaussian ) wave packet centred around ( quasi- ) momentum @xmath17 , its propagation velocity , i.e. , group velocity , is given by @xmath18 .",
    "thus , the velocity of the electron is no longer determined by its original mass , such that @xmath19 , but by a renormalized mass defined as @xmath20 , which depends on the dominant quasi - momentum of the state . as the tangent of the dispersion curve gives the group velocity , which is related to the free space velocity through the ration @xmath21 ,",
    "the curvature determines the amount of spreading of the gaussian wave packet and likewise it defines another mass parameter @xmath22 . in this paper",
    "we study the dynamics of a two - level atom interacting with a standing wave cavity mode and discuss the effect of masses @xmath23 and @xmath24 , replacing the original free mass of the atom .    in ordinary qed , the assignment of mass to electrons is an essential part of the renormalization program , where the mass may be considered shifted by the presence of the zero - point energy of the vacuum ; the fact that formally infinite entities are manipulated does not invalidate the general picture .",
    "likewise , one may expect that the presence of a finite energy in the field may give its own contribution to the renormalized quantities , in particular the mass .",
    "this quantity is usually considered to be too small to have any observable consequences . in a cavity ,",
    "on the other hand , the coupling of an atom to the cavity modes is enhanced , and it may be possible to interrogate the effect of the field on the mass .    in most setups for atom - cavity qed experiments ,",
    "the atom is prepared in some initial state outside the cavity and is then allowed to propagate through the cavity field .",
    "provided that the photonic wavelength @xmath25 is small compared with the cavity length , the system can be treated approximately as periodic , and the results of the floquet theory are applicable . if , for instance , the atom is prepared with a kinetic energy that lies in a forbidden energy gap , it can not enter the cavity but must be reflected from it , possibly with a flipped internal atom - field state @xmath12 , as will be shown below .",
    "when the kinetic energy falls within the allowed energy bands , the atom will traverse the cavity with a ( group ) velocity @xmath26 .",
    "we also simulate wave packet propagation in these situations using the split operator method .",
    "the results obtained from the floquet theory and the wave packet propagations are compared .",
    "since the mass parameters @xmath23 and @xmath24 depend on the effective coupling @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the photon number , a measurement of @xmath23 or @xmath24 also yields indirectly the photon number inside the cavity . the reflection and transmission of atoms against the cavity",
    "may also be used for state preparation or stern - gerlach type of measurements between different internal orthogonal states .",
    "the paper is outlined as follows : first , in section  [ s2 ] , the hamiltonian describing the dynamics is introduced and solved numerically for the eigenenergies and eigenstates in accordance with the floquet theory .",
    "the bare and dressed states of the system are presented and analytic approximations for the lowest band is obtained .",
    "the more illustrative approach of wave packet simulations is considered in [ s3 ] and the effective masses @xmath23 and @xmath24 are defined .",
    "both the propagation of gaussian bare and gaussian dressed states are discussed and , in order to get a deeper understanding of these two cases , we analyze the comparison between bare and dressed states .",
    "the masses @xmath23 and @xmath24 are extracted numerically and compared between bare and dressed states wave packet propagation and also with the masses obtained from the floquet theory .",
    "further it is shown with simulations how atoms may be reflected or transmitted by the cavity mode and we discuss possible applications for state preparation and state measurements .",
    "finally , in [ s4 ] we conclude with a discussion of the results and possibilities to observe the mass in realistic experiments .",
    "we describe the atom - cavity system with a jaynes - cummings model  @xcite that takes into account two atomic levels , coupled to a single field mode in the rotating wave and dipole approximations ; two essential parameters are the atom - field coupling @xmath10 and the detuning @xmath7 between the atomic transition frequency @xmath29 and mode frequency @xmath30 .",
    "moreover , the field mode is assumed to be a standing wave along the cavity axis @xmath31 , and the parallel atomic motion is quantized .",
    "the spectrum of the hamiltonian is obtained using the floquet theory , and it has a band structure with brillouin zones twice as wide as for one - level particals  @xcite .",
    "the effects of the band and band - gaps will be discussed in section  [ s3 ] , where we consider physically realistic situations .",
    "the jaynes - cummings model  @xcite describes the interaction between a two - level atom and a single field mode .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction above , the atomic center - of - mass motion has been ignored and the parameters are assumed to be independent of the atomic position in the original jaynes - cummings model ; these conditions are not , however , always satisfied in realistic atom - cavity experiment .",
    "as the atom traverses the cavity , the shape of the coupling will be governed by the cavity mode structure . for a standing wave mode , with wave number @xmath32 ,",
    "the mode is a given by @xmath9 .",
    "in most studies and experiments , the atomic velocity is large enough that it can be described classically ; thus its energy merely adds a @xmath33-number to the hamiltonian . in such situations , assuming the atom to be point - like",
    ", the position operator @xmath31 can be replaced by the classical center - of - mass position moving with the velocity @xmath34 , i.e. , @xmath35 , see  @xcite . for cold atoms , however , the center of mass motion must be considered quantum mechanically @xcite and the kinetic energy operator term must be included in the original hamiltonian .",
    "in many of the studies where the kinetic energy term is included , however , the system is simplified by adiabatic elimination of the excited state in the limit of large detuning  @xcite .",
    "the extended jaynes - cummings hamiltonian , with standing wave mode structure and quantized atomic motion , becomes @xmath36 here the tilde notation ( @xmath37 ) indicates the original dimensional variables .",
    "also @xmath38 is the atomic free mass , capital @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the momentum and position operators , @xmath41 and @xmath42 boson annihilation and creation operators for the cavity mode , and the @xmath43-operators are the pauli matrices acting on the internal two states of the atom .",
    "note that we only consider quantized motion in one dimension along the cavity axis .",
    "the coupling will be taken as @xmath44 .",
    "the evolution hamiltonian is written in the interaction picture with respect to the free hamiltonian @xmath45 and @xmath46 is the atom - cavity detuning .",
    "since the hamiltonian has been given in the rotating - wave approximation , the total number of excitations in the system @xmath47 is a conserved quantity and the dynamics therefore splits up into separated decoupled subsystems for each number of excitations . in the joint hilbert space of the internal atomic state and the cavity mode",
    ", we define the basis states as @xmath48 where the atomic states @xmath0 and @xmath1 are the atomic upper state and lower states of the transition , and @xmath2 are the cavity mode fock states . using this basis and scaled parameters , the hamiltonian assumes the form @xmath49,\\ ] ] where , after introducing a characteristic time and length scale @xmath50 and @xmath51 , the scaled parameters are expressed in terms of the old ones according to @xmath52 and @xmath28 is the photon number .",
    "we will take the photon momentum @xmath53 to define the characteristic length scale as @xmath54 .",
    "we shall consistently indicate @xmath8 in all equations below , but use the numerical value @xmath55 in all the figures in accordance with the chosen length scale . in this way",
    ", momenta @xmath14 will be given in units of q and the relevant parameters of the model are @xmath56 and @xmath57 . in most of the following analysis , we will assume the atom to be initially in its ground state @xmath1 and the mode to contain one single photon .",
    "we should emphasize that the hamiltonian ( [ ham1 ] ) then becomes identical to the on describing a two - level atom interacting with a classical standing wave field .",
    "therefor , our model may not only be used for describing atom - cavity qed dynamics , but also the interaction between two - level atoms and classical fields , for example , if the cavity is driven by a classical source or the field is given by a laser beam .",
    "more general situations of the quantized field could be considered in a straightforward generalization , but in this paper we only discuss the basic features and keep the model as simple as possible .",
    "an interesting observation is that for zero detuning @xmath58 , the unitary operator @xmath59\\ ] ] decouples the system into two ordinary one - dimensional schrdinger equations with potentials @xmath60 ; these equations are known as mathieu equations  @xcite .    due to the spatial periodicity @xmath25 of the cavity mode , the operator @xmath61 with @xmath62 , commutes with the hamiltonian ( [ ham1 ] ) ; this symmetry property is the background for the floquet theory .",
    "another , slightly less obvious symmetry is associated with the operator @xmath63 that also commutes with the hamiltonian  @xcite .",
    "this is a half - period displacement combined with an atomic inversion and it includes the first symmetry operation since @xmath64 .",
    "consequently , the first brillouin zone is within @xmath65 , and not within @xmath66 , as implied by @xmath67 alone .",
    "physically this derives from the fact that every absorption or emission of a photon flips the internal state @xmath68 , while after absorption + emission ( or vice versa ) the internal atomic state remains unchanged .",
    "the center - of - mass momentum in the two step process will either be the same or shifted by @xmath69 , depending on the direction of the emitted / absorbed photons.note that the first brillouin zone has occasionally been defined to extend within @xmath70 , which produces two sets of dispersion curves , one for each internal state @xmath12 , see refs .",
    "@xcite .      due to the conservation of the total excitation number @xmath71 , the system hilbert space @xmath72 may be represented as a direct sum of @xmath73 and @xmath74 that are not coupled by the hamiltonia .",
    "we limit the discussion to @xmath73 that is spanned by the _ bare states _ @xmath75 .",
    "the quasimomentum @xmath14 is here limited into the first brillouin zone @xmath76 and the integer index @xmath77 denotes the brillouin zone or , equivalently , the energy band .",
    "thus the physical momenta of the bare states have well - defined values @xmath78 and , in particular , the internal @xmath79 state with zero - momentum is given by @xmath80 while the @xmath81 state , by @xmath82 .",

    "other interesting situations may be realized as well with the same idea .",
    "assuming the cavity to be empty from the beginning and the atom in some linear combination of upper and lower state and with a momentum corresponding to the first gap , the state evolves as @xmath281 since a lower state atom will traverse unaffected through the cavity , while the upper state atom is reflected , this is realizing an atomic stern - gerlach type of measurement .",
    "if instead , the field is initially in some linear combination of vacuum and the one photon state and the atom in the lower state it follows that @xmath282 thus a photon stern - gerlach type of measurement is realized , assuming that the field is restricted to the states @xmath283 and @xmath284 . obviously , the scheme may not be used only for separating atomic or field stats , but it works also as a model for creating entanglement between the involved degrees of freedom , momentum , atomic and field states .",
    "we have analyzed theoretically the problem of a two - level atom propagating within a quantized standing wave electromagnetic field , with an emphasis on the mass parameters in atomic cavity qed systems .",
    "we have approached the problem with two different strategies : the floquet theory for the periodic hamilton operator , and the wave packet simulations .",
    "the first is a purely mathematical procedure , which offers numerical and approximate analytic expressions for the mass parameters , while the second is a more physical attack .",
    "the analytic results offer a hint of the dependence of the masses on the physical parameters . roughly speaking , a small detuning @xmath7 , small photon momentum @xmath8 , and a large atom - field coupling @xmath10 yield large mass shifts .",
    "the dynamics of an atomic wave packet inside ( or entering ) the cavity can be understood in terms of the dispersion curve @xmath123 , where @xmath14 is the quasi - momentum of a generalized plane wave and @xmath15 is the band index . in the taylor expansion around some quasi - momentum @xmath17",
    "each term defines a mass paramter ; in this paper we have considered the mass @xmath285 related to the group velocity @xmath170 of gaussian wave packets and the mass @xmath24 associated with the spreading of the wave packet : @xmath286 note that @xmath24 is the same as the customary effective mass @xmath141 introduced to describe , for example , acceleration of electrons within a crystal under an external force .",
    "these parameters vary essentially over different scales of the coupling , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] . even an arbitrary small coupling @xmath287 results in strong effects in the atomic dynamics . for @xmath288 , both the group velocity and @xmath289 approaches zero and finally saturates towards this value , which in unscaled quantities can be written as @xmath290 hence , whenever the characteristic interaction energy exceeds the characteristic kinetic energy of the lowest band , the band is essentially flat and",
    "the energy becomes nearly independent of the quasi - momentum .",
    "using typical values @xmath291 nm . and",
    "@xmath292 a.m.u .",
    "we get a characteristic time scale @xmath293 @xmath294 giving us the unscaled coupling @xmath295 khz for saturation .",
    "note that dividing our dimensionless detuning @xmath7 and the coupling @xmath287 by @xmath50 gives real physical quantities .",
    "the effective masses are only defined for dressed states with well defined momenta , and in many situations , the system starts out in a bare state .",
    "it is , however , possible that the bare states have a large overlap with some dressed state and may be assigned an effective mass .",
    "this has been investigated in great detail in the present paper and numerical simulation of propagation for both gaussian dressed and gaussian bare states has been analyzed and compared with both each other and with results given by the floquet theory . both the group velocity and the effective mass @xmath24 have been extracted numerically in the various cases with a good agreement as compared with the values obtained from the floquet theory .    in most experiments today , the atom and field are prepared separately and the atom is shot through the cavity with a preselected velocity .",
    "the state of the complete system is then , most likely , not in a dressed state , but rather a bare state .",
    "we have not , in the text , discussed in detail how one may prepare initial dressed states .",
    "a standard method is to use a slow adiabatic change of some external controllable parameter . for the jc model , bare and dressed states",
    "becomes identical in the two limits @xmath296 or @xmath297 . by letting the atom",
    "traverse a fabry - perot cavity almost perpendicular to the standing wave mode it is possible to have very small initial atomic velocities @xmath298 along the standing wave mode even for not so cold atoms by varying the angle of injection ; the atoms will have a high transverse velocity and a slow velocity in the @xmath31-direction along the standing wave mode .",
    "thus , it is enough to quantize the atomic motion in just the @xmath31-direction , while the @xmath89 and @xmath299-directions are treated classically . in the case of a fabry - perot cavity",
    ", the transverse gaussian mode shapes can then be described by the time envelope @xmath300 .",
    "if the turn - on of the transverse gaussian mode is slow enough , the atom will traverse the cavity in a dressed state .",
    "another feasible way to prepare the dressed states is to use an external ion trap to confine the ion inside an off - resonance cavity , and then slowly tune the cavity into resonance and shut off the external trap .",
    "in addition to investigating the dynamics of the atom in the presence of the standing wave mode , we have suggested various applications for state preparations and measurements .",
    "it has been explained and shown numerically how an incident atom may be reflected by the cavity while simultaneously leaving one photon into it , which might be used for creation of fock states .",
    "the model can also be used for stern - gerlach type of measurements , separating the upper and lower atomic states spatially .",
    "likewise , it could also be used for separating the vacuum @xmath283 from the one photon state @xmath284 and to create various entangled states , like epr - states .",
    "the paper is purely theoretical , and we understand that experimental measurement of the effective masses will pose several challenges , depending on the approach chosen .",
    "first of all , the nodes of a free - space standing wave have a tendency to drift , which is avoided in a natural way by using an optical or a microwave cavity .",
    "both regimes , however , bring new difficulties : a periodic field mode is needed in order to observe changes predicted in the propagation characteristics ; present high - q microwave cavities have , unfortunately , dimensions of the order of wavelength .",
    "hence the optical wave number is not well defined and the floquet approach adapted in this paper is no longer applicable  @xcite . in the optical regime ,",
    "time scales of both the atomic spontaneous emission and the cavity decay are usually shorter than the interaction time , and both processes will strongly affect the atom - cavity system in a way that is not included in the present consideration .",
    "one way to go around these difficulties is to use extremely long lived transitions and configurations in which upper atomic levels are only slightly populated , cf .",
    "[ fig6 ] and  [ fig7 ] ; the cavity decay may be circumvented by using a driven cavity , hence rendering the light field effectively classical .",
    "similar experiments are performed using classical laser fields made stable by a set of mirrors , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the same kind of setup could in principle be used for determination of the effective mass and one may then neglect decay of the field .",
    "the dynamics of the atom will then be the same when it interacts with a classical field as with a fock state .",
    "the floquet approach presented for the description of atomic motion in terms of an effective mass parameters is , in principle , independent of weather the two - level atom interacts with a classical light field or with a photonic fock state of a quantised field .",
    "the present results may , however , not be realistically achievable in today s cavity qed systems .",
    "our treatment does set the stage for the concept of an electromagnetic effective mass and we may only hope that novel experimental conditions will , one day , make possible the observation of cavity - induced mass modification .",
