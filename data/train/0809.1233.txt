    "let @xmath13 be an even integer , let @xmath14 be the git quotient of @xmath13 ordered points on the projective line , and let @xmath15 be the projective coordinate ring of @xmath16 .",
    "the first general results on the ring @xmath15 were found by kempe @xcite in 1894 .",
    "he showed that elements of @xmath15 can naturally be interpreted as ( formal linear combinations of ) regular graphs on @xmath13 vertices .",
    "we review this theory in  [ s - review ] .",
    "kempe used this insight to prove that @xmath15 is generated in degree one .",
    "thus @xmath15 has a natural set of generators : the _ matchings _ ( regular degree one graphs ) on @xmath13 vertices .",
    "let @xmath17 be the _ ideal of relations _ , the kernel of @xmath18 .",
    "the problem of giving a presentation for @xmath15 is thus reduced to determining generators for the ideal @xmath17 . for @xmath19 , @xmath20 . for @xmath21 ,",
    "the ideal is generated by a single , beautiful cubic equation : the segre cubic relation ( see for example @xcite ) . in @xcite , we will show that for @xmath22 , away from small characteristic , @xmath17 is generated by an explicit simple class of quadrics .",
    "the argument will rely on the base case @xmath23 , the subject of this paper .",
    "it turns out that this case ( like the cases @xmath19 and @xmath21 ) has some special extrinsic geometry .",
    "our main theorems are the following .",
    "note that @xmath24 is 14 dimensional .",
    "[ mainthm ] over @xmath10 , there is a unique ( up to scaling ) non - zero skew - invariant cubic polynomial @xmath7 in @xmath25 .",
    "it vanishes on @xmath26 , and @xmath26 is the singular locus of @xmath27 .",
    "better : the 14 partial derivatives of @xmath7 generate @xmath2  the singular scheme of the affine cone of @xmath27 is precisely the affine cone over @xmath26 .",
    "these 14 partial derivatives have no syzygies of degree zero or one . in terms of graphs , @xmath7 may be taken to be the skew - average of the cube of any matching .",
    "this result was predicted to us by igor dolgachev .",
    "it will be proved by pure thought , that is , without the use of a computer or long , explicit formulas .",
    "one consequence is a natural duality between the degree  1 piece of the ring ( with representation corresponding to the partition @xmath28 ) and the degree  2 piece of the ideal ( with sign - dual representation @xmath29 ) into the sign representation given by the cubic .    with the aid of a computer",
    ", we have a stronger integrality result :    [ mainthm2 ] over @xmath11 , there is a non - zero cubic polynomial @xmath30 in @xmath31 ( a rational multiple of the @xmath7 of theorem  [ mainthm ] ) such that @xmath26 is the singular locus of @xmath32 .",
    "better : the ideal @xmath2 is generated over @xmath11 by @xmath30 and its 14 partial derivatives .",
    "in particular , @xmath2 is generated over @xmath8 $ ] by the 14 partial derivatives of @xmath30 . over @xmath11 , the cubic @xmath30",
    "is not generated by its partial derivatives .",
    "this result is proved and discussed further in ",
    "[ s - integrality ] .",
    "it would be ideal , of course , to have a pure thought proof of theorem  [ mainthm2 ] .",
    "here is where we stand with respect to this .",
    "theorem  [ mainthm ] automatically holds over @xmath33 $ ] for some integer @xmath34 .",
    "this integer can not be determined from our proofs .",
    "however , using analogues of our proofs in positive characteristic , one can obtain a precise value of @xmath34 so that the theorem remains true over @xmath33 $ ] .",
    "unfortunately , we can not get down to @xmath35 by these methods . since the positive characteristic arguments are more complicated , use less well - known facts and do not yield an optimal result , we decided not to include them .      the extrinsic and intrinsic geometry of @xmath16 for small @xmath13 has special meaning often related to the representation theory of @xmath36 .",
    "for example , @xmath37 relates to the cross ratio , @xmath38 is the quintic del pezzo surface , and the geometry of the segre cubic @xmath39 is well known ( see for example @xcite for the representation theory ) .",
    "the space @xmath26 might be the last of the @xmath16 with such individual personality .",
    "for example , over @xmath40 , the space may be interpreted as a ball quotient in two ways :    1 .",
    "deligne and mostow @xcite showed that @xmath26 is isomorphic to the satake - baily - borel compactification of an arithmetic quotient of the @xmath41-dimensional complex ball , using the theory of periods of a family of curves that are fourfold cyclic covers of @xmath12 branched at the @xmath42 points .",
    "kondo @xcite showed that @xmath26 may also be interpreted in terms of moduli of certain k3 surfaces , and thus @xmath26 is isomorphic to the satake - baily - borel compactification of a quotient of the complex @xmath41-ball by @xmath43 , an arithmetic subgroup of a unitary group of a hermitian form of signature @xmath44 defined over the gaussian integers .",
    "see also @xcite for further clarification and discussion .",
    "both interpretations are @xmath1-equivariant ( see @xcite for the second ) .",
    "similarly , the graded ring @xmath45 we study has a number of manifestations :    1 .",
    "it is the ring of genus @xmath46 hyperelliptic modular forms of level 2 . 2 .",
    "freitag and salvati manni showed that @xmath45 is isomorphic to the full ring of modular forms of @xmath43 @xcite , via the borcherds additive lifting .",
    "the space of sections of multiples of a certain line bundle on @xmath47 ( as there is a morphism @xmath48 , @xcite , see also @xcite ) .",
    "igusa @xcite showed that there is a natural map @xmath49)/ \\mc{i}_3[2]^0 \\to r_8 $ ] , where @xmath49)$ ] is the ring of siegel modular forms of weight 2 and genus 3 .",
    "( see @xcite for more discussion . )",
    "it is a quotient of the third in a sequence of algebras related to the orthogonal group @xmath50 defined by freitag and salvati manni ( see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "( the cases @xmath51 and @xmath52 are related to enriques surfaces . )",
    "the hilbert function @xmath53 was found by howe ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ,  5.4.2.3 ) : @xmath54 the hilbert series @xmath55 is @xmath56 both of these formulas are given in @xcite .",
    "one reason for @xmath26 to be special is the coincidence @xmath57 .",
    "a geometric description of this isomorphism in this context is given in @xcite .",
    "another reason is deligne and mostow s table @xcite .",
    "let @xmath13 be an even integer .",
    "there are natural generators of @xmath58 , one for each directed matching on @xmath13 labeled vertices ( see  [ s - graph ] ) .",
    "the group @xmath36 acts on these coordinates in the obvious way .",
    "the signed sum of the cubes of these matchings @xmath59 , regarded as an element of @xmath60 , is skew - invariant . by skew - invariance",
    ", it must vanish on those points of @xmath16 where two of the @xmath13 points come together .",
    "hence @xmath59 must be divisible by the discriminant , which has degree @xmath61 .",
    "thus for @xmath62 , @xmath59 vanishes on @xmath16 .",
    "( this cubic appeared in the e - print @xcite , but was removed in the published version because its centrality was not yet understood . ) for @xmath19 , @xmath63 vanishes precisely on the boundary of @xmath37 . for @xmath21 , @xmath64 is the segre cubic . for @xmath23 , @xmath65 is the @xmath7 of theorem  [ mainthm ] ( although it must be scaled to give the @xmath30 of theorem  [ mainthm2 ] ) . and for @xmath66 , it may be shown that @xmath67 , so @xmath23 is indeed the last interesting case .",
    "[ other ]      we now describe the main steps in the proof of theorem  [ mainthm ] :    1 .",
    "we first prove the existence and uniqueness of the cubic @xmath7 , using just linear algebra .",
    "next we prove that the partial derivatives of @xmath7 generate @xmath68 , using the structure of the relevant spaces as @xmath1-modules .",
    "we then prove that the partial derivates of @xmath7 have no linear syzygies .",
    "this is where most of the work occurs .",
    "finally we use the fact that @xmath45 is gorenstein and step ( 3 ) to fill in the betti diagram of @xmath45 . from this",
    "we see that @xmath2 is generated by quadrics .",
    "steps ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) can of course be replaced by koike s computer calculation @xcite , at the expense of the conceptual argument . as a simple corollary of the step ( 3 ) we find that @xmath68 generates @xmath69 .",
    "we could then replace step ( 4 ) by an appeal to a result in @xcite which states that @xmath17 is generated by @xmath70 and @xmath71 for any @xmath13 .",
    "however , we prefer to avoid referring to a later paper .",
    "step ( 3 ) may be further broken down as follows :    1 .",
    "let @xmath72 be the map given by @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is defined via the natural action of the lie algebra @xmath75 on @xmath76 .",
    "we first observe that the space of linear syzygies between the partial derivaties of @xmath7 is exactly @xmath77 .",
    "we note that @xmath78 is a lie subalgebra of @xmath79 and is stable under the action of @xmath1 .",
    "2 .   next , using general theory developed in  [ s - liesub ] concerning @xmath80-stable lie subalgebras of @xmath81 , where @xmath0 is a representation of @xmath80 , and the classification of simple lie algebras , we show that the only @xmath1-stable lie subalgebras of @xmath79 are 0 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 ( ignoring the center ) . thus @xmath78 must be one of these three lie algebras .",
    "3 .   finally",
    ", we show that @xmath82 does not annihilate any non - zero cubic . as @xmath78 is the annihilator of @xmath7 we conclude @xmath84 .",
    "we now discuss the relationship between this paper and @xcite .",
    "the two papers prove similar results but are logically and methodologically independent .",
    "( except for a few peripheral remarks in this paper that rely on @xcite . )",
    "in @xcite we prove that @xmath17 is generated by quadrics for @xmath85 .",
    "the argument is inductive and uses the @xmath23 case for its base .",
    "this base case is already known by the work of koike and so , strictly speaking , @xcite does not logically rely on the present paper . however , koike s proof of the @xmath23 case was by a computer calculation .",
    "thus the present paper can be viewed as filling this conceptual gap .",
    "together , this paper and @xcite give a complete conceptual proof that @xmath17 is generated by quadrics for @xmath85 .",
    "as the main results of this paper and @xcite are both concerned with quadric generation of @xmath17 one might think that it would make more sense to combine the two papers .",
    "we feel that this is not the case for two reasons .",
    "first , as we have highlighted above , the @xmath23 case has a number of special properties not shared by the general case .",
    "had we combined the two papers , we feel that these beautiful features would have been obscured in the resulting , much larger paper . and",
    "second , although the results of the two papers are similar , the methods of proof are completely different .",
    "this paper uses lie theory and commutative algebra while the main tools of @xcite are toric degenerations and combinatorics .",
    "in the course of our study we have found some miscellaneous results which do not fit into the rest of the paper .",
    "first , miles reid pointed out that the secant variety of @xmath26 necessarily lies in the cubic @xmath27 , by bezout s theorem .",
    "the secant variety is @xmath86-dimensional , as expected ( this is a computer calculation ) , and is thus a hypersurface in the cubic .    the second result concerns the ring @xmath45 .",
    "as stated above , elements of @xmath15 may be represented as formal sums of regular graphs on @xmath13 vertices .",
    "in particular , the matchings on @xmath13 points span @xmath87 . by embedding the @xmath13 vertices into the unit circle",
    "we obtain a notion of planarity .",
    "a theorem of kempe states that the planar graphs give a basis for @xmath15 .",
    "we observed ( using a computer ) the following result , which is particular to the case of 8 points :    the squares of the non - planar matchings form a basis for @xmath88 .",
    "this holds over @xmath89 $ ] .",
    "foremost we thank igor dolgachev , who predicted to us that theorem  [ mainthm ] is true . without him",
    "this paper would not have been written .",
    "we also thank shrawan kumar and riccardo salvati manni for helpful comments .",
    "in this section we give a precise definition of the ring @xmath15 and recall some facts about how @xmath36 acts on @xmath15 . a more thorough treatment of these topics is given in @xcite .",
    "before we begin , we remark that we prefer to work as functorially as possible .",
    "this results in greater clarity and does not cost much .",
    "thus , rather than working with an integer @xmath13 we work with a set @xmath91 of cardinality @xmath13 .",
    "we will therefore have a ring @xmath90 in place of @xmath15 .",
    "also , rather than working with @xmath12 we work with @xmath92 where @xmath93 is a two - dimensional vector space . for this section",
    "we work over an arbitrary commutative base ring @xmath94 . in most of the remainder of the paper we will take @xmath94 to be a field of characteristic @xmath95 .",
    "let @xmath94 be a commutative ring , let @xmath91 be a finite set of even cardinality @xmath13 , let @xmath93 be a free rank two @xmath94-module and let @xmath96 be a non - degenerate symplectic form on @xmath93 .",
    "we are interested in the git quotient @xmath97 . by definition , @xmath98 is @xmath99 where @xmath100 here the action of @xmath101 on the @xmath102th - graded piece is the usual action twisted by the @xmath103th power of the determinant . thus taking @xmath101-invariants",
    "is the same as taking @xmath104-invariants .",
    "we can therefore rewrite the above formula as @xmath105^{\\sl(u)}.\\ ] ] here @xmath106 .",
    "we take as the _ definition _ of @xmath90 for the purposes of this paper .",
    "note that @xmath90 and @xmath98 depend upon @xmath94 but this is absent from the notation .",
    "we will write @xmath107 when we want to emphasize the dependence on @xmath94 .",
    "of course , @xmath108 . we note that the symmetric group @xmath109 acts on @xmath90 by permuting the tensor factors .",
    "we now take a moment to comment about tensor powers , such as the one appearing in . for a @xmath94-module @xmath0 and a finite set @xmath91",
    "we define @xmath110 in the obvious manner : it is the universal @xmath94-module with a multilinear map from @xmath111 .",
    "we think of pure tensors in @xmath110 as _ functions _ from @xmath91 to @xmath0 . for an integer @xmath13 ,",
    "we write @xmath112 for @xmath113 .",
    "the construction @xmath110 is functorial in both @xmath0 and @xmath91 .",
    "let @xmath114 be an element of @xmath115 .",
    "since @xmath116 is ordered , we have a natural isomorphism @xmath117 .",
    "we can thus transfer the symplectic form @xmath96 on @xmath93 , thought of as an element of @xmath118 , to an element @xmath119 of @xmath120 .",
    "explicitly , if we pick a symplectic basis @xmath121 of @xmath122 then @xmath123 , where @xmath124 is just shorthand for the function @xmath125 which takes @xmath126 to @xmath127 and @xmath128 to @xmath129 . note that @xmath119 is invariant under @xmath130 .",
    "we now give a description of @xmath90 in terms of graphs .",
    "we say that a directed graph with vertex set @xmath91 is _ regular _ if each vertex has the same valence .",
    "this common valence is then called the _ degree _ of the graph .",
    "let @xmath131 be a regular directed graph of degree @xmath102 .",
    "we define an element @xmath132 of @xmath133 by @xmath134 , the product taken over the edges @xmath116 of @xmath131 .",
    "( these may be interpreted as specht polynomials . ) as each @xmath119 is invariant under @xmath104 , so is @xmath132 .",
    "the fact that @xmath131 is regular of degree @xmath102 ensures that @xmath132 belongs to @xmath135 .",
    "it is a fact from classical invariant theory that the @xmath132 span @xmath90 as a @xmath94-module .",
    "the next matter , of course , is to determine the relations between the various @xmath132 . to begin with",
    ", we clearly have @xmath136 , where @xmath137 denotes the graph on @xmath91 whose edge set is the union of those of @xmath131 and @xmath138 .",
    "we then have the following easily verified relations :    * ( sign relation . )",
    "@xmath139 if @xmath138 is obtained from @xmath131 by reversing the direction of a single edge . *",
    "( loop relation . )",
    "@xmath140 if @xmath131 contains a loop . *",
    "( plcker relation , see fig .",
    "[ fig : pluck ] . )",
    "let @xmath131 be a regular directed graph and let @xmath141 and @xmath142 be two edges of @xmath131 .",
    "let @xmath138 ( resp .",
    "@xmath143 ) be the graph obtained by replacing these two edges with the edges @xmath144 and @xmath145 ( resp .",
    "@xmath146 and @xmath147 ) .",
    "then @xmath148    it is now a second fact from classical invariant theory that these three types of relations generate all the relations amongst the @xmath132 .",
    "( the loop relation is implied by the sign relation if 2 is invertible in @xmath94 . )",
    "@xmath149    to be a bit more precise , let @xmath150 be the free graded @xmath94-module with basis @xmath151 as @xmath131 varies over directed regular graphs on @xmath91 .",
    "the grade of @xmath152 is the degree of @xmath131 .",
    "we turn @xmath150 into a ring by defining @xmath153 .",
    "we then have a map @xmath154 given by @xmath155 .",
    "the two theorems of classical invariant theory referred to above about amount to the assertion that this map is surjective and the kernel is generated by the sign , loop and plcker relations .",
    "we now recall some of its properties of @xmath90 that will be relevant to us .",
    "the first and perhaps most important is the following ( for a proof , see @xcite or @xcite ) :    the ring @xmath90 is generated as a @xmath94-algebra by its degree one piece .",
    "we emphasize that this holds for all @xmath94 , or equivalently , for @xmath156 .",
    "we remark that kempe proved another theorem : if one fixes an embedding of @xmath91 into the unit circle , so that one can make sense of what it means for a graph to be planar , then the @xmath132 with @xmath131 planar form an basis of @xmath90 as a @xmath94-module .",
    "thus , for instance , one can count planar graphs to determine the hilbert function of @xmath90 .",
    "we write @xmath157 for the first graded piece of @xmath90 .",
    "it is spanned by regular graphs of degree one .",
    "we call such graphs _",
    "matchings_. kempe s theorem says that the map @xmath158 is surjective .",
    "we let @xmath159 be the kernel of this map .",
    "we call @xmath159 the _ ideal of relations_. the present paper is concerned with finding generators for @xmath159 when @xmath91 has cardinality eight .",
    "we need to recall some facts about how @xmath157 and some related spaces decompose under the symmetric group @xmath160 .",
    "for simplicity , we now take @xmath94 to be a field of characteristic zero , although analogues of the statements remain true so long as @xmath161 is invertible in @xmath94 .",
    "recall that the irreducible representations of @xmath162 over @xmath94 correspond to young diagrams , or partitions .",
    "the representation @xmath157 of @xmath162 is irreducible and corresponds to the young diagram with two rows and @xmath163 columns .",
    "the result we need is the following :    [ prop : decomp ] assume @xmath94 is a field of characteristic zero . in the following table , each @xmath162-module is multiplicity free .",
    "the set of irreducibles it contains corresponds to the given set of partitions .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     2ex the @xmath126-axis is horizontal and the @xmath128-axis vertical .",
    "all @xmath164 outside of the above range are zero .",
    "we first note that ( b6 ) gives @xmath165 as @xmath166 , @xmath167 and @xmath168 in our situation .",
    "we thus have the symmetry of the table .",
    "now , by ( b2 ) and ( b4 ) we have @xmath169 if either @xmath126 or @xmath128 is negative .",
    "we thus see that @xmath169 if @xmath170 or @xmath171 by symmetry .",
    "next , observe that @xmath172 is the free envelope of @xmath173 , where @xmath174 .",
    "this gives the @xmath175 column of the table .",
    "we now look at the @xmath176 column . we know that the 14 generators have no linear relations and so @xmath177 . by ( b3 )",
    "we have @xmath178 for @xmath179 .",
    "we also know that there are 14 quadric relations and so @xmath180 .",
    "we now look at the @xmath181 column of the table . we have proved ( proposition  [ prop : nosyz ] ) that the 14 quadric relations have no linear syzygies ; this gives @xmath182 . using ( b3 ) again",
    ", we conclude @xmath183 for @xmath184 .",
    "we have thus completed the first two rows of the table .",
    "the last two rows can then be completed by symmetry .",
    "the middle row can now be determined from ( b5 ) by evaluating both sides at @xmath185 and solving the resulting upper triangular system of equations for @xmath186 .",
    "( in fact , the computation is simpler than that since @xmath187 and we know @xmath188 , the latter vanishing coming from proposition  [ prop : i2-i3 ] . )",
    "proposition  [ prop : betti ]  in particular , the @xmath176 column of the table  shows that @xmath2 is generated by its degree two piece .",
    "thus we have proved theorem  [ mainthm ] .",
    "the resolution of @xmath173 as a @xmath189-module , without any consideration of grading , is given by freitag and salvati manni ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma  1.3 , theorem   1.5 ) .",
    "it was obtained by computer .",
    "_ in this section we take the base ring @xmath94 to be @xmath11 . _      we begin with a short discussion of linear algebra over @xmath11 .",
    "let @xmath190 be a finite free @xmath11-module and let @xmath34 be a submodule .",
    "we say that @xmath34 is _ saturated _ ( in @xmath190 ) if whenever @xmath191 belongs to @xmath34 , with @xmath192 and @xmath193 , we have that @xmath127 belongs to @xmath34 .",
    "of course , @xmath34 is saturated if and only if it is a summand of @xmath190 .",
    "note that if @xmath34 and @xmath194 are saturated submodules such that @xmath195 then @xmath196 . finally , we remark that @xmath197 , the @xmath13th graded piece of the ideal , is a saturated submodule of @xmath198 .",
    "this is easily seen as @xmath197 is the kernel of @xmath199 , and @xmath200 is torsion free .",
    "we begin our discussion proper by giving an explicit formula for @xmath30 in terms of the basis of non - crossing matchings ( see figure  [ fig : noncross ] for a listing of these 14 generators ) : @xmath201 ( note that for the formula to be unambiguous we need to specify how the edges of the matchings are directed .",
    "label the vertices from 1 to 8 going clockwise , starting at any vertex .",
    "then the edges are directed to point from smaller to larger numbers .",
    "the choice of starting vertex does not affect the above expression for @xmath30 . )",
    "this formula was found with the aid of a computer by taking the skew - average of a particular element of @xmath202 .",
    "this element is related to the generalized segre cubics of @xcite and was chosen because it has a large isotropy subgroup .",
    "the right side of the expression for @xmath30 is visibly non - zero as we are in the polynomial ring on the @xmath127 , @xmath129 and @xmath203 variables .",
    "the reader may check that each of the 14 partial derivatives of @xmath30 contains a monomial with unit coefficient which does not appear in the other 13 partial derivatives .",
    "for example @xmath205 contains the monomial term @xmath206 with coefficient @xmath207 , and this monomial does not appear in any of the other 13 partial derivatives .",
    "it follows that the @xmath11-module spanned by these 14 quadrics inside of @xmath208 is saturated .",
    "as these 14 quadrics give a basis for @xmath209 and @xmath204 is saturated in @xmath208 we see that they must in fact give a basis for @xmath204 as a @xmath11-module .",
    "thus the partial derivatives of @xmath30 give a basis for @xmath204 as a @xmath11-module .",
    "let @xmath210 be the ideal of @xmath211 generated by @xmath30 and its 14 partial derivatives .",
    "we must show @xmath212 . by the main theorem of @xcite it suffices to show @xmath213 , @xmath214 , and @xmath215 .",
    "the previous proposition established the first of these equalities .",
    "we must establish the second .",
    "now , as in the previous proof , we know that @xmath216 and that @xmath217 is saturated in @xmath202 . thus to prove @xmath214 it suffices to show that @xmath218 is saturated .",
    "unfortunately we do not how to do this by hand without an exorbitant amount of work .",
    "however , we can use the computer algebra system magma @xcite to check this ; see the websitehowardbj/8points.html ] of the first author for the code .",
    "we perform this check as follows .",
    "create a @xmath219 matrix @xmath190 , with the columns indexed by the cubic monomials in the 14 non - crossing variables and with the rows corresponding to the 196 possible products @xmath220 , for @xmath221 as well as @xmath30 .",
    "we verify that the elementary divisors of @xmath190 are all equal to @xmath222 by computing the smith normal form of @xmath190 in magma .",
    "similarly we check by computer that in degree 4 that the @xmath223 quartics generated by the cubics span a saturated sub - lattice of @xmath224 of rank @xmath225 .",
    "( we compute the rank of @xmath226 by expressing it as @xmath227 . )",
    "now suppose that @xmath228 is the ideal generated by the 14 partial derivatives alone .",
    "similar to the above , we define a @xmath229 matrix @xmath230 , with rows indexed by the @xmath220 , and we find using magma that it has an elementary divisor equal to @xmath46 .",
    "this shows that @xmath231 and so the cubic @xmath30 is necessary when 3 is not invertible .",
    "we now explain how the results and proofs in  [ s : betti ] can be adapted to work over a field @xmath94 of positive characteristic .",
    "first , in @xcite we will show that @xmath173 is cohen - macaulay .",
    "in fact , we will show that @xmath15 , over any field , is cohen - macaulay .",
    "( one can not use the hochster - roberts theorem to prove this as the group @xmath233 does not have a semi - simple representation category in positive characteristic . )",
    "the proof of proposition  [ prop : goren ] then carries over to show that @xmath173 is gorenstein with @xmath168 .",
    "note that stanley s theorem is true over any field and that the hilbert series of @xmath234 is independent of the field @xmath94 as @xmath235 is flat over @xmath11 .",
    "we thus see that proposition  [ prop : goren ] holds true over any field .",
    "we now turn to proposition  [ prop : betti ] .",
    "we first note that the same reasoning used in the proof of proposition  [ prop : i2-i3 ] shows that @xmath236 over any field .",
    "when @xmath237 theorem  [ mainthm2 ] gives @xmath238 .",
    "the proof of proposition  [ prop : betti ] then carries over exactly the same to this situation .",
    "thus the betti diagram is the same as in characteristic zero . now consider the case where @xmath239 .",
    "theorem  [ mainthm2 ] then gives @xmath240 and so @xmath241 as well .",
    "> from this , one may conclude @xmath242 ( as there must be at least two relations to produce a syzygy ) and thus that @xmath183 for @xmath243 .",
    "we thus have the first two rows of the table and by symmetry get the last two rows .",
    "one can again compute the middle row using ( b5 ) .",
    "however , all that goes into this computation is the alternating sum of the @xmath164 along diagonals @xmath244 .",
    "since @xmath245 still equals @xmath246 , the alternating sum along the @xmath247 diagonal is still the same . from this",
    "we see that the middle row is the same as in characteristic zero .",
    "let @xmath94 be a field . if @xmath237 then the betti diagram of @xmath234 is the same as that given in proposition  [ prop : betti ] .",
