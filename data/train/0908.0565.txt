    "the heavy - fermion superconductor cecoin@xmath0  has attracted considerable attention since its discovery in 2001.@xcite not only does this unconventional d - wave superconductor exhibit non - fermi liquid behavior associated with proximity to a proposed quantum critical point , but it is unique among the heavy - fermion superconductors in that it also exhibits a new thermodynamic phase ( b phase ) that exists only within the superconducting phase near @xmath7.@xcite initially this b phase was identified as the elusive fulde - ferrell - larkin - ovchinnikov ( fflo ) superconducting phase first predicted to exist in pauli - limited superconductors over 40 years ago.@xcite in fact , recent nmr work by young and coworkers@xcite identified the presence of incommensurate antiferromagnetic order in the b phase in contrast to the standard predictions for the fflo phase.@xcite signatures of magnetism were also seen in other nmr experiments.@xcite the nmr spectra of the in sites in the b phase do not reveal additional paramagnetic resonances that might be associated with macroscopic phase separation , but rather are consistent with superconducting order coexisting with a homogeneous modulation of antiferromagnetic order.@xcite despite initial arguments to the contrary,@xcite recent neutron scattering results by kenzelmann and coworkers now provide conclusive proof for long - range static incommensurate antiferromagnetic order.@xcite            the antiferromagnetism in cecoin@xmath0  was first identified by young et al.due to the presence of a broad spectrum observed at the in(2 ) sites in this material ( see figs . [",
    "fig : unitcell ] and [ fig : spectra ] ) .",
    "the in(1 ) and co sites , in contrast , showed no splitting .",
    "young et al .   pointed out that these observations place constraints on the possible magnetic structure , but do not uniquely identify the structure .",
    "they proposed a minimal model where the magnetic structure consists of ordered local ce spins with moments @xmath8 along the applied magnetic field direction ( along [ 100 ] ) , with an ordering wavevector of the form @xmath2 .",
    "the structure of the nmr spectra revealed the incommensurate nature , but the value of the modulation @xmath9 remained undetermined since the hyperfine field at the in(2 ) site depends on the product of the size of the ordered moment and the incommensuration . in the neutron diffraction experiment , kenzelmann et al .  oriented the field along the [ 1@xmath100 ] direction , and observed @xmath11 with @xmath12 and moments along [ 001 ] .",
    "a crucial observation was that @xmath9 is _ independent of the applied field _ in the b phase , in contrast to the predictions for the fflo phase . by proposing a ginzburg - landau model for the coupling of antiferromagnetism and superconductivity",
    ", they showed that the superconducting order parameter in the b phase acquires a component with finite momentum because of the strong coupling between the incommensurate magnetism and superconductivity .",
    "the neutron data confirm the nmr observation that this exotic state disappears immediately above @xmath7 , where the system returns to a fully homogeneous normal phase , yet with strong deviations from conventional fermi liquid theory.@xcite    a priori , the nmr and neutron scattering results suggest different magnetic structures . in order to address this discrepancy , we investigate several possible magnetic structures allowed by the nmr results .",
    "the neutron diffraction results suggest that the applied field , @xmath13 , the moments , @xmath8 , and the incommensuration wavevector @xmath14 are all mutually orthogonal . in contrast , the proposed nmr scenario suggested @xmath15 . as we show below , this scenario is the most likely for _ isotropic _ transferred hyperfine couplings between the ce spins and the in(2 ) nuclei . on the other hand ,",
    "if the coupling tensors are _ anisotropic _ , then other magnetic structures are possible as argued by koutroulakis et al.@xcite if the hyperfine tensor has purely dipolar symmetry , then we find that for @xmath1 $ ] the most likely magnetic structures satisfy @xmath16 $ ] and @xmath17 .",
    "the spectra of the in(1 ) and in(2 ) differ slightly depending on the orientation of @xmath18 in the plane , but the data are most consistent with @xmath19 $ ] or @xmath20 $ ] .",
    "the anisotropic coupling scenario offers a picture that is both physically more reasonable and consistent with neutron diffraction observations of @xmath17 and @xmath21 , though for fields @xmath22 $ ] .",
    "in order to explain the broad double - peak structure of the in(2 ) spectrum in fig . [",
    "fig : spectra ] , there must be a distribution of local fields both parallel and antiparallel to the applied field @xmath23 $ ] with values ranging up to 1.3 koe.@xcite the resonance frequency is given by @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the gyromagnetic ratio and @xmath26 is the contribution from the quadrupolar interaction at the nucleus . since the electric field gradient ( efg ) at all three nuclear sites is unaffected by the onset of superconductivity or magnetism , the dramatic line broadening effects observed in the b phase can be attributed entirely to the onset of the static hyperfine field , @xmath27 .",
    "@xmath26 is a temperature independent constant that depends on the particular site and we will not address it further . experimentally , we find no significant broadening in the b phase for the in(1 ) or the co , but a broad , double - peak spectrum for the in(2a ) site ( previously referred to as in(2)@xmath28 , the in(2 ) site on the unit cell face that lies parallel to the field ) .",
    "independent measurements show no significant broadening at the in(2b ) ( previously referred to as in(2)@xmath29 ) .",
    "these results put stringent constraints on any candidate magnetic structure .",
    "the double - peak structure observed for the in(2a ) arises because there is a distribution of local hyperfine fields that lie either parallel or antiparallel to the applied field .",
    "if @xmath27 is parallel to @xmath30 and is modulated along a direction @xmath31 , then @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the magnitude of the modulation , @xmath34 is the distance along the modulation , and @xmath35 is the wavevector . in this case , the spectrum will then be given by @xmath36 on the other hand , if @xmath37 then @xmath38 and the spectrum is given by @xmath39 these spectra are shown in fig .",
    "[ spectrumcalc ] , and clearly show that for the parallel case , there are two double peaks at frequencies both below and above @xmath40 , whereas for the perpendicular case , there is only a single peak at higher frequency .",
    "a key result of the re - analysis of the nmr spectra is , in agreement with our earlier analysis , that the in(2a ) sites require a hyperfine field parallel to the applied magnetic field , @xmath41 , to account for the broadening and double - peak spectrum . on the other side , the in(2b )",
    "sites show little or no broadening , consistent with a vanishing or perpendicular hyperfine field , i.e. , at the in(2b ) sites either @xmath42 or @xmath43 .",
    "the hyperfine interaction is given by the hamiltonian @xmath44 where the hyperfine coupling tensor @xmath45 represents the on - site coupling to an electron spin , @xmath46 , at the nuclear site @xmath47 , @xmath48 represents a transferred hyperfine coupling to an electron spin on a distant ( ligand ) site at @xmath49.@xcite in cecoin@xmath0 , these sites are the nearest neighbor ce 4@xmath50 electrons , and the sum is over the nearest neighbors . for static ordering of the ce spins , eq .",
    "( [ eq : hyptransferred ] ) can be re - written as : @xmath51 , where the magnitude and direction of the hyperfine field @xmath27 depend critically on the hyperfine tensors for the particular site and the magnetic structure .",
    "the tensorial @xmath45 term represents hyperfine coupling to the itinerant conduction electrons , which we will ignore , since we are only concerned with static contributions to @xmath27 from the static local ce ordering .",
    "the transferred hyperfine tensor @xmath48 is generally not diagonal in the crystal axis basis,@xcite and may be written as the sum of isotropic and dipolar contributions.@xcite to lowest order , the tensor can be approximated by a scalar ( isotropic ) interaction , since the transferred hyperfine interaction is typically at least one order of magnitude greater than the direct dipolar interaction .",
    "however , in the cecoin@xmath0  compound , there is evidence that the hyperfine interaction is not purely isotropic , and therefore we must consider dipolar symmetries as well . indeed , the magnitude of the dipolar portion is found to be enhanced by the delocalized nature of the electrons in the solid.@xcite therefore , we write the hyperfine fields at the ligand sites as : @xmath52 where @xmath53 for the in(1 ) nearest neighbor ce sites , @xmath54 for the co nearest neighbor ce sites , and @xmath55 for the in(2a ) nearest neighbor ce sites , and @xmath56 for the in(2b ) nearest neighbor ce sites .",

    "in cecoin@xmath0  measurements of the knight shift in the normal state show that the hyperfine couplings for the in(2a ) site ( @xmath92 ) for the applied field along ( 100 ) , ( 010 ) and ( 001 ) are 10.3 koe/@xmath3 , 0.0 koe/@xmath3 , and 32.4 koe/@xmath3 , respectively.@xcite for this site , equations ( [ eqn : isotropic ] ) and ( [ eqn : dipolar ] ) yield : @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the susceptibility in the @xmath95 direction . using the experimental numbers,@xcite we find @xmath96 koe/@xmath3 and @xmath97 . the difference between this angle and that of the crystal structure ( @xmath98 ) probably is related to details of the bonding of the in @xmath99 orbitals , and will need further investigations .              for cases ( 1.4 ) , ( 2.4 ) , ( 3.4 ) and ( 4.4 ) the hyperfine field at the in(2a ) and in(2b ) sites varies spatially @xmath100 $ ] with modulus : @xmath101\\\\ \\mathbf{h}_{hf}(2b ) & = & s_0b_{dip}[3\\sin(2\\theta_z)\\cos(\\frac{\\pi\\delta_y}{2})\\hat{\\mathbf{b } } + ( 1-\\cos(2\\theta_z)\\sin(\\frac{\\pi\\delta_y}{2})\\hat{\\mathbf{c}}]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in each case , the hyperfine field at the in(2a ) site oscillates along the modulation direction with a component along [ 100 ] and the resulting spectrum is described by figs .",

    "the hyperfine field at the in(2a ) and in(2b ) have components perpendicular to @xmath30 , but these components only give rise to small shifts of the resonant frequency that are difficult to distinguish from the knight shift .",
    "the crucial element is that the hyperfine field at the in(2a ) is along @xmath30 .",
    "the fact that the antiferromagnetism exists only in field and only within the superconducting phase indicates a strong coupling between these order parameters .",
    "kenzelmann and coauthors@xcite analyzed the symmetry of the superconducting state for such a coupling and concluded that the superconducting order parameter , @xmath108 acquires the finite momentum @xmath109 of the antiferromagnetic order parameter , @xmath110 .",
    "this corresponds to a modulation of the order parameter in real space that presumably is out - of - phase with the antiferromagnetism . in other words ,",
    "the antiferromagnetic order is maximum at the nodes of @xmath108 . since then various microscopic models have been proposed to explain the field induced antiferromagnetic order.@xcite curiously , this scenario is similar to that observed in the ferropnictide srfe@xmath111as@xmath111 under pressure.@xcite in this compound , a novel hybrid state of coexisting superconductivity and antiferromagnetism emerges above 5 gpa .",

    "high t@xmath112 , heavy fermion , and ferropnictide systems , the highly clean undoped cecoin@xmath0 and srfe@xmath111as@xmath111 materials support the emergence of this fragile but _ intrinsic _ thermodynamic phase of modulated antiferromagnetism and superconductivity . in cecoin@xmath0 , this phase is quickly destroyed by doping and is replaced by a commensurate order at zero field for sufficiently high cd doping.@xcite clearly many questions about this new state of matter remain unexplained , such as the driving mechanism(s ) , the origin of the incommensurate wavevector , and the nature of the excitations .",
    "in summary , we have shown that both nmr and neutron diffraction measurements in the field - induced b phase of cecoin@xmath0  are consistent with magnetic structures where @xmath17 and @xmath21 .",
    "the incommensurate modulation @xmath113 lies possibly along either [ 010 ] or [ 110 ] direction for magnetic field pointing along [ 100 ] in real space .",
    "tetragonal equivalent directions for @xmath113 , [ 100 ] and [ 1@xmath100 ] , are also possible . based on our analysis of the nmr spectra , we speculate that the b phase of cecoin@xmath0  represents an intrinsic phase of modulated superconductivity and antiferromagnetism that can only emerge in a highly clean system",
    ". further nmr and neutron diffraction measurements are necessary for the same field orientations to unravel the origin of the field - induced antiferromagnetic structure .",
