    "transversely holomorphic flows on @xmath0-manifolds have been classified by brunella  @xcite and ghys  @xcite . the taut contact circles ( definition  [ defn : tcc ] ) studied by us in a series of papers beginning with @xcite are special instances of such transversely holomorphic flows .",
    "indeed , the classification in @xcite of @xmath0-manifolds that admit a transversely holomorphic flow follows a route via the enriques  kodaira classification of complex surfaces similar to the one taken in  @xcite .",
    "in @xcite we indicated that the moduli theory of taut contact circles on spherical @xmath0-manifolds admits a nice reformulation in terms of an invariant for transversely holomorphic flows , which , it turns out , is the basic incarnation of a secondary characteristic class first constructed by bott  @xcite .    in order to develop this moduli theory in a way accessible to contact geometers , we present in this paper a detailed survey of transversely holomorphic flows ( or oriented @xmath1-dimensional foliations ) on @xmath0-manifolds , notably on the @xmath0-sphere @xmath2 .",
    "for it is only on manifolds covered by @xmath2 that this moduli problem is linked in an intriguing fashion with the common kernel foliation of the taut contact circle .",
    "we describe the construction of the bott class ( definition  [ defn : gv ] ) , a global invariant for transversely holomorphic flows , as a direct complex analogue of the godbillon ",
    "vey invariant  @xcite .",
    "we also introduce a logarithmic monodromy for closed leaves in such foliations ( definition  [ defn : log - m ] ) , which can be interpreted as a simple instance of the residue theory for transversely holomorphic foliations developed by heitsch  @xcite .",
    "we use the bott invariant to formulate a generalised gau  bonnet theorem ( theorem  [ thm : gv - real ] ) , from which we deduce the classical gau  bonnet theorem in corollary  [ cor : gb ] .    motivated by the moduli problem for taut contact circles  @xcite",
    ", we then turn our attention to transversely holomorphic foliations on the @xmath0-sphere @xmath2 ; these are the so - called poincar foliations of  @xcite .",
    "the bott invariant turns out to be the moduli parameter in each of two families of taut contact circles .",
    "we give explicit models for the transversely holomorphic foliations on @xmath2 and show this list to be exhaustive ( theorem  [ thm : all - p ] ) by appealing to the poincar  dulac normalisation theorem for poincar singularities .",
    "we compute the bott invariant of these foliations , and the logarithmic monodromy of their closed leaves .",
    "section  [ section : topology ] is devoted to a detailed study of the topology of transversely holomorphic foliations on  @xmath2 . with the aid of associated @xmath3-dimensional foliations",
    "we provide means to visualise these foliations .",
    "this includes an analysis of the asymptotic behaviour of the non - compact leaves , and the poincar return map of compact ones .",
    "the figures in section  [ section : topology ] give an inkling of the rich geometry and dynamics displayed by transversely holomorphic foliations .",
    "the calculations of the invariants from sections [ section : s3 ] and  [ section : log ] , together with some information gained from the explicit descriptions of the poincar foliations in section  [ section : topology ] , are then used to prove a number of rigidity results , for instance about the uniqueness of the transverse holomorphic structure ( theorem  [ thm : unique - hol ] ) . within the realm of taut contact circles ,",
    "we show that the classification can be given in terms of the common kernel foliation ( theorem  [ thm : common - kernel ] ) .",
    "an application of these rigidity results is a uniformisation theorem for orbifolds ( theorem  [ thm : orbi ] ) , which has been proved previously using the ricci flow .    in the case where the transversely holomorphic foliation defines a seifert fibration ,",
    "we determine the seifert invariants explicitly ( proposition  [ prop : seifert ] ) . in the context of the rigidity results",
    ", we make an observation about seifert fibrations of @xmath2 and lens spaces ( proposition  [ prop : seifert - s - l ] ) that may be of independent interest .",
    "much of what we say about transversely holomorphic flows on @xmath0-manifolds , except probably for the generalised gau ",
    "bonnet theorem and the explicit analysis of the poincar foliations , can be found in some form in the specialist literature .",
    "we hope that our survey of the relevant material will not only make this paper self - contained from a contact geometric perspective , but also serve as an introduction to the beautiful theory of transversely holomorphic flows for a wider audience .",
    "let @xmath4 be a nowhere zero vector field on a closed , oriented @xmath0-manifold  @xmath5 .",
    "the flow ( or the foliation ) generated by @xmath4 is said to be _ transversely holomorphic _ if there is a complex structure @xmath6 on the @xmath3-plane bundle @xmath7 invariant under the flow of  @xmath4 .",
    "this is equivalent to having a transverse conformal structure and a transverse orientation .",
    "we shall restrict attention to the case where the bundle @xmath7 is trivial .",
    "for the study of transversely holomorphic flows on the @xmath0-sphere this is no restriction . given any nowhere zero vector field @xmath4 with this triviality condition , one can find a pair of pointwise linearly independent @xmath1-forms @xmath8 on @xmath5",

    ".    conditions ( c1 ) and ( c2 ) do not depend on the specific choice of  @xmath4 .",
    "this means that ` transversely conformal resp.holomorphic ' is really a property of the line field @xmath20 or the foliation it defines .",
    "an alternative interpretation of this property , more common in foliation theory , is that the holonomy pseudogroup of the foliation consists of biholomorphisms between open subsets of  @xmath21 .",
    "the terminology ` flow ' emphasises the fact that these foliations come with a natural orientation induced from the transverse and the ambient orientation .",
    "conditions ( c1 ) to ( c3 ) are equivalent .",
    "a further equivalent condition is :    * the pair @xmath13 satisfies the identities @xmath22    the cartan formula for the lie derivative gives @xmath23 , hence @xmath24 annihilates  @xmath4 .",
    "this implies the existence of smooth functions @xmath25 such that @xmath26 we compute @xmath27 hence , condition ( c1 ) is equivalent to @xmath28 the manifold @xmath5 being @xmath0-dimensional , two @xmath0-forms on @xmath5 are equal if and only if they yield the same @xmath3-form under the inner product with  @xmath4 .",
    "this inner product transforms the first equality in ( c4 ) into the second equality in  ( [ eqn : c ] ) , and the second into the first .",
    "thus , ( c1 ) and ( c4 ) are equivalent .",
    "the system ( [ eqn : c ] ) translates into @xmath29 this gives the equivalence between ( c1 ) and ( c2 ) .",

    "this is equivalent to condition ( c4 ) , with the additional contact requirement @xmath32 .    in @xcite",
    "it was shown that a taut contact circle on a @xmath0-manifold @xmath5 gives rise to a complex structure on @xmath33 . via the classification of complex surfaces we arrived at a complete list of closed @xmath0-manifolds admitting taut contact circles :    [ thm : taut - manifolds ] a closed",
