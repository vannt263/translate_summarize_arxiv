    "we are not aware of startup data on the corresponding experimental system as studied by @xcite .",
    "nonetheless these curves qualitatively resemble literature data on startup in polymer glasses ( see , e.g. , fig . 1 of @xcite ) .",

    "( this ratio may depend on model details . )",
    "the overshoot is controlled mainly by the underlying fluidity model rather than polymeric effects .",
    "as mentioned in the main text we set @xmath107 , which is effectively zero , and set the dimensionless aging parameter @xmath125 ( in a system at rest ) to be unity for simplicity . we have already chosen our length unit as the initial sample length .",
    "the parameters remaining in the model are the material parameters @xmath126 ; the tensile force @xmath31 ; the waiting time @xmath32 ; the unloading factor @xmath70 ; the perturbation threshold @xmath124 introduced above ; the initial cross sectional area of the sample @xmath98 ; and the additional viscosity @xmath29 .    as stated previously , the viscosity @xmath29 is a numerical device that allows force balance to be maintained from one time step to the next by slight adjustments of the strain rate .",
    "( an alternative would be to include fluid inertia ; another would be to have an extra iteration loop to maintain precise force balance at every timestep . )",
    "any small value for @xmath29 will achieve this without corrupting the physics of the model ; we choose @xmath127 . since @xmath128 and @xmath129 , this always remains negligible compared to the solvent viscosity .",
    "the initial cross section @xmath98 can in principle be matched to the samples reported by lee et al @xcite , but in a homogeneous deformation none of the quantities we report depend on sample shape . hence @xmath98 is relevant only when necking is accounted for ; when a definite value is needed ( as in eq.[neckpert ] above ) we choose @xmath130 .",
    "( recall that the unit of length is the sample length ) .",
    "similar remarks apply to @xmath124 ; for definiteness we choose @xmath131 .",
    "the applied tensile force @xmath132 can be estimated by hypothesizing that , in the plateau that is reached after strain hardening , this force is carried predominantly by the polymers .",
    "thus @xmath133 ; it follows that @xmath134 .",
    "lee et al @xcite report deformations in terms of a local strain variable @xmath135 which equates to @xmath136 - 1 $ ] in our notation . mildly extrapolating the data of their fig.1 to estimate the plateau height ,",
    "we conclude that @xmath136\\simeq 2.7 $ ] ; it follows that @xmath137 .",
    "note that @xmath138 is in fact the ` engineering stress ' of @xcite , which is 16 mpa in the loading experiment reported in their fig.1 .",
    "the resulting @xmath36 of @xmath139 mpa is about ten times larger than the rubbery modulus of the same material @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with the view of @xcite that the modulus responsible for strain hardening , though attributable to polymers , is not simply entropic in origin as in rubbers ( see main text ) .",
    "we turn next to the parameter @xmath140 which controls the strain - induced relaxation of @xmath1 . within our model ,",
    "this is fixed by observing that in steady state at low elongation rates ( @xmath141 ) the solution to eq.[suptau ] approaches @xmath142 figure 3 of lee et al @xcite plots @xmath143 against @xmath144 ( with @xmath145 the pre - deformation value of the relaxation time ) ; the slope on this log - log plot is close to unity . estimating the near - constant ratio @xmath146 from the left edge of the experimental plot gives @xmath147 from which we deduce that @xmath148 .",
    "armed with this value , the solvent modulus @xmath38 is now estimated from the virtually instantaneous drop from the undeformed value of @xmath149 to a smaller value @xmath150 , reported immediately after imposition of the load .",
    "the resulting strain @xmath151 is not directly reported in @xcite but by integrating our equations of motion is found to obey @xmath152 = ( g^p+g^s ) ( \\exp[2\\varepsilon^+]-\\exp[-\\varepsilon^+])\\ ] ] so that for small strain and large @xmath72 we have @xmath153 . integrating the @xmath1 equation through the same step strain , we find the post - load value @xmath154 = \\tau(0 ) \\exp[-f\\mu/\\sqrt{3}g^s]$ ] .",
    "figure 1 in @xcite shows @xmath155 from which it follows that @xmath156 ( using the previous result that @xmath157 ) .",
    "the resulting @xmath158 mpa is @xmath159 times smaller than the young s modulus of fully vitrified pmma @xcite , which suggests that in the temperature range of interest ( near but below the glass transition ) only a small proportion of the monomeric degrees of freedom are directly involved in the process of solvent arrest .",
    "the next parameters to be estimated are @xmath32 , the effective age of the sample on first loading , and @xmath20 which is the relaxation time of a fully devitrified sample . within our model ,",
    "the initial relaxation time @xmath160 is simply equal to @xmath32 .",
    "the remaining parameter @xmath20 is then needed to connect the time axis in our numerical calculations to that in the experiments of @xcite .",
    "in essence , we use this as an implicit fit parameter to get the best agreement between our @xmath2 curves and those reported experimentally .",
    "( in numerical practice , we use @xmath20 as the unknown but fixed unit of time in which case @xmath161 , the numerical sample age , is the explicit fit parameter . ) to extract a value of @xmath20 from our fits we observe that , when the loaded sample in figure 1 of @xcite achieves its minimum relaxation time ( point ( e ) on panel c of that figure ) , the decay curve from which this time is measured ( panel b ) is close to mono - exponential with a relaxation time of 28s .",
    "the relaxation time @xmath160 for the undeformed material ( for which the decay is far from exponential but fitted carefully by the authors of @xcite ) is ( from their figure 1 a ) @xmath162 times larger , i.e. , @xmath163 s. our best fit waiting time obeys @xmath116 ; since @xmath164 , we then have @xmath45 s.    as noted in the main text , the elongational dynamic yield stress of the solvent fluid can be found by calculating the steady state stresses at fixed @xmath25 and studying the limiting tensile stress @xmath165 as @xmath166 .",
    "the result is @xmath167 mpa .",
    "this is somewhat at odds with figure 2 of @xcite , which suggests an elastic response up to stresses of about twice this value .",
    "however , the true yield stress could lie below the value extracted from the experimental measurements if the latter do not detect extremely slow creeping motion that may arise for stresses close to but above @xmath57 ."

    "<S> the egp s precepts may thus be unsuited to the regime of strong fluidization , as addressed experimentally in @xcite and in recent glass rheology theories @xcite .    despite several recent efforts @xcite , creating a comprehensive theory of rheological aging in polymer glasses </S>",
    "<S> remains a formidable task . </S>",
    "<S> here we show that a minimal model , combining just two key elements of any such theory ( nonfactorable aging / rejuvenation , and the strain dependence of polymer - borne stresses ) , semiquantitatively explains many of the results reported in @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> our model describes polymeric dumb - bells @xcite suspended in a glassy ` solvent ' , whose microscopic relaxation time obeys a fluidity - type equation showing simple aging and flow - rejuvenation . despite our nomenclature , we do not require any actual solvent to be present : the separation between polymer and ` solvent ' instead divides the slow degrees of freedom of large sections of chain from the shorter - scale and faster relaxing modes that control local segmental dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> our model thus follows lines developed in @xcite but crucially differs in its treatment of aging and rejuvenation . for simplicity </S>",
    "<S> we treat the dumb - bells initially as purely elastic elements  as is valid in the molten state , where the elasticity is of entropic origin @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , we later return to discuss the true nature of the polymer stress in polymeric glasses which is not solely entropic in character @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> our model first defines a deviatoric stress tensor @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are dimensionless conformation tensors for polymer and ` solvent ' , @xmath8 associated elastic moduli ( see below ) , and @xmath9 the unit tensor . </S>",
    "<S> we then adopt the following equations for the conformation tensors and solvent relaxation time @xmath1 : @xmath10 here @xmath11 is the fluid velocity and @xmath12 .    </S>",

    "<S> consistent with its glassy nature , the solvent itself is viewed as a viscoelastic fluid . </S>",
    "<S> bearing in mind that it represents shorter - scale polymeric degrees of freedom , we model this fluid using another upper - convected maxwell model ( [ two ] ) . because there are more local than chain - scale degrees of freedom , we expect @xmath18 .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , the solvent s structural relaxation time @xmath1 obeys a fluidity - type equation ( [ three ] ) , with the following two features . </S>",
    "<S> first , without flow , @xmath1 increases linearly in time at a ( dimensionless ) solidification rate @xmath19 which for simplicity we set to unity . </S>",
    "<S> this embodies the simple aging scenario that emerges from mesoscopic models @xcite , whereby local configurations evolve into ever deeper traps . </S>",
    "<S> second , with flow present , @xmath1 would , in the absence of such aging , itself undergo deformation - induced relaxation towards @xmath20 which is a ` fully rejuvenated ' value . this relaxation occurs at a rate @xmath21 , proportional to a scalar measure of flow rate ( with @xmath22 another dimensionless coefficient @xcite ) . in steady shear ( @xmath23 ) </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath1 then varies inversely with strain rate @xmath24 in accord with microscopic theory @xcite . for uniaxial </S>",
    "<S> elongation at strain rate @xmath25 , ( [ four ] ) reduces to @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> note that in this simple fluidity model , the rejuvenation of @xmath1 is essentially strain - induced @xcite but , in contrast to the factorable model of @xcite , can be rapidly reversed by subsequent aging .    </S>",
    "<S> our model is completed by the standard equations of mass and force balance for an incompressible fluid of negligible inertia : @xmath27 , and @xmath28 = 0 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> ( here @xmath29 is a small additional newtonian viscosity , included solely for numerical reasons @xcite . ) </S>",
    "<S> we have solved our model numerically for uniaxial extension flows within a lubrication approximation appropriate to long cylindrical samples . </S>",
    "<S> our numerical solutions address two cases @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one is an effectively infinite cylinder that remains of spatially uniform , but time dependent , cross section . </S>",
    "<S> the second addresses a finite cylinder perturbed to trigger an inherent ` necking ' instability . </S>",
    "<S> the latter is commonplace in elongation of polymer glasses ( and reported in @xcite , in relatively mild form ) . </S>",
    "<S> we show next however that a semiquantitative account of the @xmath2 response under elongational load is already predicted by applying our simple model to the infinite uniform cylinder .    in confronting the experimental data for @xmath2 we first set @xmath30 negligibly small , appropriate for a crosslinked material @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> more details , and an additional figure , are provided in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although our model is not predictive of sample shapes ( which depend on the details of the perturbation used to initiate the neck ) , plots of @xmath2 , and sample radius @xmath65 , at three different initial positions along the sample are in qualitative accord with the experiments of @xcite . the explanation given above for the temporal behavior of @xmath2 during elongation of an infinite uniform cylinder remains equally valid for a finite , necked one .    in order to confirm that our model also behaves reasonably in strain - controlled flows , we have calculated stress responses for startup of steady elongation and compression . </S>",
    "<S> these show an overshoot ( see additional figure in @xcite ) whose height varies as @xmath66 , similar to the behaviour found in simple aging fluids @xcite , and in broad accord with the polymer glass literature .    </S>",
    "<S> these successes are very encouraging . </S>",
    "<S> however , the model as formulated so far breaks down badly when the sample is unloaded . here </S>",
    "<S> the experiments show a modest drop in @xmath1 immediately on removing the load , followed by a gradual recovery towards the pre - deformation value . </S>",
    "<S> the dotted line in fig .  [ fig : one ] shows the prediction based on eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ one][four ] ) ; @xmath1 drops , but then falls much further before recovering . </S>",
    "<S> the reason for this behavior within our model is clear . in the strain - hardened regime , </S>",
    "<S> the polymers carry a large elastic tensile stress , which exceeds @xmath57 . upon unloading , </S>",
    "<S> this acts backwards on the vitrified solvent , causing it to yield . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting @xmath2 resembles a re - run of the initial loading experiment . </S>",
    "<S> another discrepancy is that the value of @xmath67 mpa needed to fit the loading data is approximately ten times larger than the rubbery modulus of the same material above its glass transition ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> this confirms that the strain - hardened modulus of polymer glasses does not primarily stem from single - chain entropic elasticity @xcite .    , during loading phase only , log - log plot of reduced strain rate against reduced relaxation rate . </S>",
    "<S> inset : experimental data collapse with this plot , slope 0.92 . </S>",
    "<S> ( from  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . reprinted by permission of aaas . ) </S>",
    "<S> partial collapse occurs here ( dashed line is slope 1 ) : while re - entrant regions do not fully superpose , the slopes of the rising and decreasing curves remain comparable.,width=321 ]    we now identify a physical mechanism that could account for both discrepancies . </S>",
    "<S> we invoke the well established phenomenon of large but viscous stresses that arise when chains are strained rapidly relative to their own relaxation time ( @xmath68 ) . under such conditions , relatively small sections of the polymer quickly stretch close to full extension locally , forming a nearly one - dimensional multiply folded ( ` kinked ' ) filament @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> further stretching occurs by migration and annihilation of neighboring kinks of opposite sign . during this process , </S>",
    "<S> a large fraction of the stress carried by the polymers is not entropic - elastic , but instead caused by viscous drag against extended subsections of chain . upon unloading , a large fraction of this inelastic polymer stress disappears on a very rapid timescale @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this mechanism is closely related to the phenomenon of ` chain conformation hysteresis ' which arises for fully stretched chains , causing a sudden loss of polymer stress on unloading with only modest relaxation of polymer conformations @xcite .    rather than attempt a full treatment of this rather complex effect ( which would certainly require a multimode polymer description @xcite ) , </S>",
    "<S> we retain our equations but suppose phenomenologically that the effective polymer modulus drops by a certain factor , @xmath69 , during unloading of the sample . the solid line in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : one ] shows the result for @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> this choice of @xmath70 is consistent with the fitted @xmath36 being ten times larger than the value expected from entropic elasticity alone . </S>",
    "<S> the polymer stress acting backwards on the solvent is now safely below the solvent yield stress ; the result is a modest drop and then slow increase in @xmath2 , as seen experimentally .    </S>",
    "<S> overall , the success of our simplified model suggests that the striking time dependence of the segmental mobility under elongation , reported in @xcite , should be a robustly universal feature of near-@xmath0 polymer glasses . </S>",
    "<S> however the quantitative details strongly depend on dimensionless parameters such as @xmath71 and @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> we can not link these directly to microscopic physics , but such parameters can influenced by increasing polymer stiffness , adding small molecules , or introducing short side chains . </S>",
    "<S> ( all of these should increase @xmath72 , by raising the ratio of solvent - like to polymeric degrees of freedom . ) </S>",
    "<S> our model may thus suggest design strategies for manipulating the evolution of @xmath2 , tailoring the mechanical responses of polymer glasses to suit particular design needs .    in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> we have presented a simple approach to the modeling of polymer glasses that builds on recent models of rheological aging and rejuvenation in simple glassy fluids . without attempting to capture every feature of the experiments of @xcite ( for instance </S>",
    "<S> , we do not address the non - exponential form of local relaxations ) , the minimal combination of a simple - aging fluid with a strain - dependent polymer stress can explain much of what happens when a polymer glass is subjected to elongational load </S>",
    "<S> . the unloading behavior is less easily explained , but consistent with a plausible modification of the same model , which crudely allows for the presence of non - elastic polymer stresses when @xmath73 is large @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> our work suggests that an accurate representation of aging and rejuvenation physics will form a key part of any more comprehensive theory of polymer glass rheology . </S>",
    "<S> it encourages the view that a more comprehensive account of polymer glasses might be achieved by judiciously combining existing types of nonlinear rheological theory ( describing non - glassy polymers and simple glasses respectively ) . </S>",
    "<S> quantitative progress along these lines might enable rapid advances towards the design of superior polymer glass materials .    </S>",
