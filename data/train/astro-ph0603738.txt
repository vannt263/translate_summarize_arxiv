    "the swift gamma - ray burst explorer @xcite , successfully launched on 2004 november 20 , is dedicated to the discovery and study of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) and their x - ray and optical afterglows .",
    "its fast - pointing capability , compared with previous satellites , allows us to repoint towards grb sources approximately 100 s after the burst detection by the burst alert telescope ( bat ; @xcite ) and to study , for the first time , the early phases of the afterglow evolution . moreover",
    ", the very broad energy coverage allows a simultaneous study of the phenomenon in the optical , soft and hard x - ray bands .",
    "one of the main swift results has been the direct observation of the transition between the prompt and the afterglow emission .",
    "a growing number of early rapidly - fading x - ray afterglows have been observed by swift , that have been successfully interpreted as the tail of the prompt grb emission ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the emergence of the true x - ray afterglow component has been identified with a break in the x - ray light curve to a less steep ( often flat ) decay rate , sometimes accompanied by spectral variation across the break .",
    "further breaks in the x - ray light curve have been related to standard afterglow evolution .",
    "the light curve of the x - ray counterpart of xrf  050416a show all these characteristic features .",
    "bat detected and located xrf  050416a on 2005 april 16 , 11:04:44.5 ut , at the coordinates ra@xmath9 , dec@xmath10 , with an uncertainty of 3@xmath11 @xcite .",
    "the light curve showed a single peak followed by a small bump with duration @xmath12=2.4@xmath13  s , with most of the energy emitted in the @xmath14  kev band .",
    "the time - averaged energy distribution was well described by a power law ( @xmath15 ) with photon index @xmath16 ( 90% confidence level ) @xcite . the soft spectrum and the fact that the fluence in the @xmath17  kev energy band is @xmath18 erg @xmath8 , larger than the fluence in the @xmath19  kev band ( @xmath20 erg @xmath8 ) classify this event as an x - ray flash ( xrf ; @xcite ) .",
    "a complete ground analysis of the bat data is presented in @xcite .",
    "these authors found that the best fit for the average energy distribution of the burst over the @xmath12 interval is given by a band model @xcite , with peak energy @xmath21  kev , low - energy spectral slope @xmath22 ( fixed ) and high - energy slope @xmath23 ( 68% confidence level ) .",
    "this represents a 3.1  @xmath24 improvement with respect to a simple power law fit ( @xmath25 over the 14@xmath26150 kev energy band ) .",
    "@xcite also showed that spectral hard - to - soft evolution was present during the bat observation , with the spectrum becoming considerably softer at the end of each peak , and estimated an isotropic energy @xmath27  erg .    following the burst detection ,",
    "the satellite executed an immediate slew and promptly began collecting data at 11:05:49 ut ( 64.5  s after the trigger ) with the ultraviolet / optical telescope ( uvot ; @xcite ) and at 11:06:00.6 ut ( i.e. 76.1  s after the trigger ) with the x - ray telescope ( xrt ; @xcite ) .",

    "there was no further detection in the @xmath28 band down to the 5  @xmath24 limiting magnitude of 19.57  mag @xcite , 173  s after the first @xmath28-band image .",
    "a fading source was also detected at 193  nm ( uvw2 filter ) , placing an upper limit of 1 to the grb redshift @xcite .",
    "the results and implications of the uvot observations are discussed in @xcite .",
    "ground - based optical , nir , and radio follow - up observations were performed with several instruments .",
    "a fading source was detected with the anu 2.3  m telescope in the @xmath37 band @xcite , with the palomar 200-inch hale telescope in the @xmath38 band @xmath39  min after the bat trigger @xcite , with the mao telescope in the @xmath37 band ( @xmath40 , with a 900  s exposure , 11  hr after the trigger ; @xcite ) , and , marginally , with the kait in a 60  s @xmath41-band image , 7.4  min after the trigger @xcite . a late observation performed with the magnum telescope equipped with",
    "the mip dual - beam optical - nir imager detected the afterglow with @xmath42  mag , 12.2  hr after the trigger .",
    "spectra of the host galaxy of xrf  050416a were taken with the low resolution imaging spectrometer mounted on the 10-m keck i telescope @xcite .",
    "the spectrum indicates that the host galaxy is faint and blue with a large amount of ongoing star formation .",
    "spectral analysis revealed several emission lines including [ oii ] , h@xmath43 , h@xmath44 , and h@xmath45 , at a redshift @xmath46 .",
    "this is consistent with the prediction of @xcite based on the afterglow detection in the swift uvot uvw2 filter .",
    "xrf  050416a is thus one of the closest long grbs discovered by swift .    at radio frequencies ,",
    "no source was detected with the vla down to a limiting flux of 260  @xmath47jy at 8.46  ghz 37  min after the burst @xcite or with the giant meter - wave radio telescope at 1280  mhz @xmath48  d after the burst ( placing an upper limit of 94  @xmath47jy ; @xcite ) , while a source with flux density @xmath49jy was detected with the vla at 4.86  ghz , 5.6  d after the burst @xcite .    in the following ,",
    "we report on the analysis of the prompt emission and of the x - ray afterglow observed by swift .",
    "details on the follow - up xrt observations and the xrt data reduction are described in   [ xrtdata ] ; the temporal and spectral analysis results are reported in   [ xrtanalysis ] . in   [ discussion ]",

    "conclusions are drawn in   [ section::conclusions ] .",

    "the background level was extracted from a rectangular region of the same extension , far from the source and affected by minimal contamination from other sources in the field .",

    "the intensity of the source during the first orbit of the first observation ( table  [ log ] ) was high enough to cause pile - up in the pc frames . in order to correct for this effect , we extracted counts from an annular region with an outer radius of 30 pixels ( 70@xmath618 ) and an inner radius of 3 pixels ( 7@xmath611 ) .",

    "the optimal inner radius was evaluated by comparing the analytical psf with the profile extracted in the first 2000  s of observation .",
    "the excluded region corresponds to pixels deviating more than one sigma from the best fit of the differential psf wings ( i.e. the fit performed on data from 7 pixels outwards ) .",
    "the light curve was corrected for the psf fraction loss .",
    "+ in the following 28 orbits of the first observation and throughout the second observation the intensity of the afterglow was lower than 0.1  count  s@xmath63 and the pile - up was negligible .",
    "the data were extracted from the entire circular region of 30 pixels radius in order to have the maximum available statistics , particularly important in the last part of the afterglow decay .",
    "this circle encloses 93% of the psf .",
    "both here and in the previous case , the contribution of the second , fainter source detected within the bat error box is negligible with respect to the afterglow intensity .",
    "+ the afterglow had faded to a count rate comparable to that of the serendipitous source . in order to avoid significant ( i.e. greater than 10% ) contamination , we reduced the extraction radius to 6.5 pixels ( 15@xmath69 ) .",
    "such a region includes about 71% of the source psf and the possible contamination from the nearby source within this region amounts to about 12% of its psf .",
    "given the faintness of the afterglow in this final part of the light - curve , this choice also improves the s / n ratio .",
    "the background level for the pc data was extracted in an annular region with an inner radius of 40 pixels and an outer radius of 150 pixels centered at the source position . to eliminate contributions from faint sources in the background region",
    ", we produced a 380  ks image by summing all of the observations , and searched this image for faint sources within the background annulus .",
    "in addition to the serendipitous source shown in fig . [ fov ] , 20 other sources were found with s / n ratio higher than 3 , all of which were located more than 50 pixels from the afterglow .",

    "the event belongs to the short tail of the long grb population @xcite .",
    "it could also be consistent with the third class of bursts identified by @xcite through multivariate analysis on the batse catalog .",
    "this class consists of bursts of intermediate duration and fluence as compared to the standard classes of short / faint / hard and long / bright / soft grbs .",
    "the average energy distribution of the prompt emission is soft ( well fitted by a power law with @xmath116 at the 90% confidence level or by a band model with @xmath117 , @xmath118  kev , and @xmath119 at the 68% confidence level ) with significant evidence of hard to soft evolution within each peak @xcite .",
    "the gamma - ray spectral distribution of this burst , with fluence in the x - ray energy band @xmath120  kev larger than the fluence in @xmath19  kev band , classifies it as an x - ray flash @xcite .",
    "xrt monitored the xrf  050416a x - ray emission from @xmath121  s up to 74  d after the bat trigger .",
    "xrf afterglows have been rarely detected in the past ( xrf  011030 , xrf  020427 : @xcite ; xrf  030723 : @xcite ; xrf  040701 : @xcite ; xrf  050215b : @xcite ; xrf  050315 : @xcite ; xrf  050406 : @xcite ; xrf  050824 : @xcite ) . the exceptionally long observational campaign of xrf  050416a has provided us with a unique data set and allowed one of the most accurate spectral and timing analyses ever performed for an xrf afterglow .",
    "the xrf  050416a light curve of the first @xmath122  s after the trigger ( fig .",
    "[ lc ] ) is fairly smooth and similar in shape to other swift - detected xrf and grb afterglows like xrf  050315 @xcite or grb  050319 ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "it shows evidence of three different phases ( a , b , and c according to   [ timing ] ) , each of them characterized by a distinct decay slope ( see fig .",
    "[ lc ] and table [ lcfit ] ) . at the beginning of the xrt observation",
    "the light curve shows a steep decay ( @xmath123 ) , followed by a short flat phase ( @xmath124 ) and then by a third long - lasting phase with a more rapid intensity decline ( @xmath125 ) .",
    "we also found that the late extrapolation of the phase c decay is consistent with the flux upper limit measured @xmath126  d after the prompt emission ( observations # @xmath127 ) .",
    "there is no evidence of x - ray flares as seen in xrf  050406 @xcite , grb  050502b @xcite , grb  050607 @xcite , and many other events .",
    "the xrt spectra show significant excess absorption in the rest frame of xrf  050416a ( @xmath128  @xmath8 ) and an energy distribution significantly softer in phase a ( @xmath129 ) than in phases b and c , which have consistent spectral slope with a weighted average energy index @xmath130 .",
    "this may indicate a different emission process acting during the initial phase of the xrf  050416a light curve .      in the internal / external shock scenario @xcite ,",
    "the tails of grb peaks are expected to be caused by the `` high latitude effect '' @xcite .",
    "if a relativistic shell of matter suddenly stops shining , a distant observer receives photons emitted from increasing off - axis angles at later times due to the longer travel path . when the observed frequency is above the synchrotron cooling frequency ( which is usually the case in the x - ray band ) , then the decay index expected for the observed light curve is @xmath131 , where @xmath43 is the spectral index measured during the decay .",
    "the decay slope of phase a ( @xmath132 ) is definitely lower than the value expected for high - latitude emission ( @xmath133 ) .",
    "however , the high - latitude effect only provides an upper limit to the decay slope , since it assumes that the shell emission stops abruptly after the initial pulse .",
    "residual emission may still be present from the shocked shells , so that slower decline rates are possible .",
    "the high - latitude emission would in this case contribute only a small fraction of the overall radiation .",
    "another possibility is that the x - ray band was below the cooling frequency : in this case the expected decay slope of high latitude radiation would naturally be shallower than 2+@xmath43 . in this scenario",
    "the first break in the x - ray light curve would be due to the emergence of the afterglow light after fading of the prompt emission ( see sect .",
    "[ discussion : phasesbc ] ) .",
    "the forward shock may therefore contaminate the tail emission .",
    "this component would however make the spectrum harder .",
    "since most of the phase a counts come from the lr data , that correspond to the very first point in the x - ray light curve , we expect the afterglow to provide little contribution ( @xmath134% ) at this time .      according to @xcite ,",
    "the standard interpretation of the flat decay slope during phase b and of the second temporal break in the afterglow involves refreshed shocks @xcite . in the initial stages of the fireball evolution the forward shock",
    ", which emission produces the x - ray afterglow , may be continuously refreshed with the injection of additional energy .",
    "this could happen either because the central engine still emits continuously @xcite , or because slower shells emitted at the burst time catch up the fireball which has already decelerated @xcite . within this scenario , a flat decay of the afterglow",
    "is expected as the refreshed forward shock decelerates less rapidly than in the standard case .",
    "a transition to the standard afterglow evolution ( i.e. a break ) with no remarkable spectral changes is also expected when the additional energy supply ends .",
    "according to the @xcite analysis , the various refreshing mechanisms can be characterized by an effective index @xmath135 such that a decay slope @xmath136 is expected for the afterglow light curve until injection stops . for xrf  050416a , with @xmath137 and @xmath138 , we can derive @xmath139 .",
    "note that the phase c decay slope and spectral index are marginally consistent with @xmath140 and @xmath141 for @xmath142 .",
    "this is expected for a fireball propagating in a uniform interstellar medium or in a stellar wind environment when the synchrotron cooling frequency is below the x - ray region , and before the jet break @xcite . since phase c remarkably continues uninterrupted until the last xrt detection 42 days after the burst",
    ", this interpretation implies the absence of both a cooling break ( expected in case of wind environment ) or a jet break in the x - ray afterglow . wind and magnetic field parameters can be easily adjusted to delay the cooling break after the end of the observational campaign of xrf  050416a , thus the circumburst environment can not be distinguished based on x - ray data alone .",
    "the long and well sampled x - ray light curve of xrf  050416a is one of the best suited for testing more realistic jet models .",
    "the leading jet models for xrfs include an on - beam uniform jet with a very wide opening angle @xcite , an off - beam uniform jet with the line of sight outside the jet edge @xcite , a structured gaussian - like jet with the viewing angle outside the bright gaussian core @xcite , and a two - component jet with the line of sight on the less energetic wider beam such as the cocoon surrounding a collapsar jet @xcite .",
    "the segment c displays a `` normal '' afterglow decay without significant features .",
    "this rules out the off - beam uniform jet which predicts an initial fast rise and a rapid decay ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the lack of a rebrightening feature also greatly constrains the two - component jet .",
    "we therefore only focus on two possibilities , i.e. an on - beam uniform jet and an off - beam structured jet .    in this section",
    "we describe preliminary results of our efforts to model the light curve in the phase c through numerical simulations .",
    "we model the synchrotron radiation powered by the external shock propagating in a uniform medium with proton number density @xmath143 .",
    "our three dimensional code , which was developed by j. dyks , can calculate afterglow emission of an arbitrary axially symmetric jet observed at any viewing angle .",
    "the code has been used to model the curvature effect in structured jets @xcite and more generally the grb afterglow light curves ( described in zhang et al . 2005 ) .",
    "the code takes into account all kinematic effects that affect the observed flux ( e.g.  doppler boost , propagation time delays ) in the way described by @xcite .",
    "the radial dynamics of the outflow is followed well into the non - relativistic regime using the equations of @xcite .",
    "sideways expansion is neglected .",
    "the evolution of the electron energy spectrum is followed with the simplified analytical method @xcite , except for the top - hat ( i.e. uniform jet ) case when the low run time has allowed exact integration of the continuity equation @xcite . in the calculations discussed below ,",
    "we have used the exact spectrally derived value of @xmath144 , which assumes the cooling frequency was below the x - ray band .",
    "light curves calculated for a uniform jet viewed on - beam are notably steeper than the data ( the predicted slope is @xmath145 , to be compared with the observed value @xmath146 ) . the one shown in fig .",
    "[ theory ] ( solid line ) has been calculated for the half opening angle of the uniform jet @xmath147 , the viewing angle @xmath148 , the total explosion energy of the two - sided outflow @xmath149 erg , the bulk lorentz factor @xmath150 , the proton number density of the external medium @xmath151  @xmath152 , and the electron and magnetic field energy equipartition parameters , @xmath153 and @xmath154 , equal to 0.1 and 0.01 , respectively .",
    "a  contrived \" version of structured jets , with uniform distribution of @xmath155 as a function of @xmath156 , but with the explosion energy @xmath157 increasing towards the jet axis can produce light curves that are less inconsistent with the data ( dashed line in fig .",
    "[ theory ] ) .",
    "this is thanks to the well known flattening that appears near the jet break time for large viewing angles @xmath158 , where @xmath159 is the half opening angle of the most energetic central part of the outflow .",
    "however , the light curves typically have a slightly concave shape that is not observed in phase c. the dashed line in fig .  [ theory ]",
    "is for a structured jet with the uniform @xmath155 , and a gaussian profile of @xmath157 with standard deviation @xmath160 and @xmath161 .",
    "the other parameters are the same as in the top - hat case .",
    "standard theoretical parameter values of @xmath162100 , @xmath163  @xmath152 and an assumption of @xmath164  erg result in models in which the cooling frequency is below the x - ray band throughout phase b , with the result that the model slope is steeper than the observed slope in that phase .",
    "the flatter slope of phase b could be interpreted as a `` cooling break '' if the cooling frequency begins above the xrt energy band and crosses it at the phase b / phase c transition .",
    "this would require lower @xmath165 , lower @xmath166  @xmath152 , or larger explosion energies @xmath167 erg .",
    "the low value of @xmath143 and large @xmath168 could also help explain the late jet break time without requiring a large solid angle for the uniform outflow .",
    "however , the presence of a cooling break at the phase b / phase c transition should be associated with a strong spectral change , which is not observed .",
    "in fact , the modeled energy spectral index in this case changes by 0.5 at this transition ( see fig .  [ beta_evolv ] ) , in contrast to the observations .",
    "the hard model spectrum in phase b could in principle be compensated for a contribution from the softer , prompt emission , but this seems contrived , as it would have to balance perfectly to produce no change in the observed spectral index .",
    "the interpretation given above for phase b in terms of refreshed shocks seems more plausible .",
    "the steep initial phase of the x - ray light curve of xrf  050416a can be interpreted as the tail of the prompt emission .",
    "the rest of the light curve shows evidence of forward shock refreshing mechanisms acting up to about 1450  s since the trigger and then an uninterrupted decay with no signature of jet breaks up to at least 42 days .",
    "the overall phenomenology of xrf  050416a and other swift detected xrfs provides evidence that both grbs and xrfs arise from the same phenomenon @xcite , but the characteristics of xrf  050416a deviate somewhat from model expectations .",
    "our preliminary numerical simulations confirm that the late - time decay of xrt  050416a is slightly flatter than expected for on - axis viewing of a uniform jet .",
    "modeling of off - axis viewing of a structured jet with a uniform bulk lorentz factor and a gaussian internal energy distribution also could not reproduce the x - ray light curve satisfactorily for reasonable values of the model parameters .",
    "more realistic afterglow models should be investigated in detail to understand these effects and to fully explain the broad range of peak energies observed from xrfs through x - ray rich bursts to classical grbs .",
    "swift xrt results are showing that jet breaks are rare for both xrfs and grbs ( xrf  050315 , @xcite ; grb  050318 , @xcite ; grb  050505 , @xcite ; grb  050525a , @xcite ) . because of its relative slow decay rate and its exceptionally long x - ray light curve , xrf  050416a provides a particularly stringent case for understanding jet collimation and structure in grbs .",
    "a jet opening angle @xmath169 can be estimated through eq .  1 in @xcite assuming @xmath170  d ( i.e. the time of the last detection in the xrt light curve ) , an isotropic energy @xmath171  erg ( obtained from the bat power law fit ) and standard values of the proton number density of the external medium @xmath172 and the radiative conversion efficiency of the burst @xmath173 .",
    "this opening angle far exceeds the jet angle of @xmath174 generally considered to be typical for grbs . whether this is related to the soft nature of this event requires a larger sample of jet breaks for both grbs and xrfs",
    "this work is supported at inaf by funding from asi on grant number i / r/039/04 , at penn state by nasa contract nass5 - 00136 and at the university of leicester by the particle physics and astronomy research council .",
    "we gratefully acknowledge the contribution of dozens of members of the xrt team at oab , psu , ul , gsfc , asdc and our sub - contractors , who helped make this instrument possible .",
    "obrien et al . ( 2005 ) have shown that for most grbs the x - ray afterglow light curves smoothly connect with the end of the prompt emission . to show this",
    ", it is necessary to compute the expected flux in the xrt energy range due to the prompt emission . in fig .",
    "[ lc ] we show that the the backward extrapolation of the x - ray light curve of xrf  050416a to the time of the trigger smoothly joins with the extrapolation of the bat light curve in the xrt energy band obtained extending the bat best fit power law with @xmath175 down to soft x - ray energies .",
    "however , the xrf nature of the source implies that the bat light curve in fig .",
    "[ lc ] represents only an upper limit to x - ray emission during the prompt phase .",
    "a bat light curve extrapolation computed by adopting the band best fit model presented by @xcite , or any band model with @xmath176 and @xmath177  kev , predicts a flux significantly below the backwards extrapolation of the phase a xrt light curve ( more than one order of magnitude ) .",
    "this would suggest that the steep decline phase is not tied to the prompt emission , but is , perhaps , due to a further burst peak or a flare ( too faint to be detected by bat ) which occurred during the data gap not covered by xrt .",
    "it is however interesting to note that the spectral index of the phase a xrt light curve is very soft , and is consistent , within the errors , with that of the _ high - energy _ slope of the main burst spectrum .",
    "the phase a light curve could therefore be indeed the prompt emission tail ( as with most swift grbs ) , provided that the peak energy had shifted red - ward of the xrt range by the beginning of the xrt observation .",
    "indeed , softening of grb spectra is a common property of their prompt emission @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that in some cases this behavior is due to the lowering of @xmath178 .",
    "thanks to swift , this phenomenon might have now been observed over a much wider temporal and spectral span .",
    "the xrf050416a bat spectra showed spectral evolution @xcite , with the hardness ratio decreasing during each burst peak .",
    "[ simul ] shows the expected values of the @xmath179  kev)/@xmath180  kev ) hardness ratio in simulated bat observations of a source with a band spectral energy distribution located at the same detector position as xrf  050416a .",
    "the hardness ratio is plotted as a function of @xmath178 for different choices of the indices @xmath181 and @xmath182 , covering their typical ranges of variation @xcite .",
    "simulations of bat spectra with a band shape with @xmath22 , @xmath183 , and @xmath178 varying from 0.1 to 50  kev show that the observed hardness ratio of the xrf050416a bat peaks ( which decreased from @xmath184 to @xmath185 ) can be reproduced by @xmath178 evolving from @xmath186 to @xmath134  kev , consistent with the average value @xmath187  kev @xcite .",
    "a similar behavior could be obtained also allowing an evolution of @xmath188 ( from @xmath189 to @xmath190 ) , while pure @xmath182 evolution ( keeping fixed @xmath191  kev and @xmath22 ) can not easily account for the observed hardness ratio range .",
    "to summarize , the bat and xrt data are consistent with the peak energy evolving from @xmath186  kev ( during the second grb peak ) down to @xmath192  kev ( at the beginning of the xrt observation ) .",
    "this would roughly correspond to @xmath193 .",
    "indeed , fixing the intrinsic absorption to the value obtained by the fit of the phase b and phase c spectra , the phase a xrt spectrum may be fit by a band model with @xmath194  kev ( although the data do not require this ) .",
    "otherwise , @xmath178 could be even lower , close to or below the xrt range ( so that the @xmath178 evolution would be faster ) .",

    "<S> swift discovered xrf  050416a with the burst alert telescope and began observing it with its narrow field instruments only 64.5  s after the burst onset . </S>",
    "<S> its very soft spectrum classifies this event as an x - ray flash . </S>",
    "<S> the afterglow x - ray emission was monitored up to 74 days after the burst . </S>",
    "<S> the x - ray light curve initially decays very fast ( decay slope @xmath0 ) , subsequently flattens ( @xmath1 ) and eventually steepens again ( @xmath2 ) , similar to many x - ray afterglows . </S>",
    "<S> the first and second phases end @xmath3 and @xmath4  s after the burst onset , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we find evidence of spectral evolution from a softer emission with photon index @xmath5 during the initial steep decay , to a harder emission with @xmath6 during the following evolutionary phases . </S>",
    "<S> the spectra show intrinsic absorption in the host galaxy with column density of @xmath7  @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> the consistency of the initial photon index with the high energy bat photon index suggests that the initial fast decaying phase of the x - ray light curve may be the low - energy tail of the prompt emission . </S>",
    "<S> the lack of jet break signatures in the x - ray afterglow light curve is not consistent with empirical relations between the source rest - frame peak energy and the collimation - corrected energy of the burst . </S>",
    "<S> the standard uniform jet model can give a possible description of the xrf050416a x - ray afterglow for an opening angle larger than a few tens of degrees , although numerical simulations show that the late time decay is slightly flatter than expected from on - axis viewing of a uniform jet . a structured gaussian - type jet model with uniform lorentz factor distribution and viewing angle outside the gaussian core </S>",
    "<S> is another possibility , although a full agreement with data is not achieved with the numerical models explored . </S>"
