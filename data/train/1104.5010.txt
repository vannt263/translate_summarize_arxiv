    "et al_. @xcite , many researchers have found the existence of the snas , and have even classified the mechanisms for their occurrence in quasiperiodically forced continuous dynamical systems and maps . in particular the snas have been reported to arise in many physically relevant situations such as the quasiperiodically forced pendulum @xcite , the quantum particles in quasiperiodic potentials @xcite , biological oscillators @xcite , the quasiperiodically driven duffing - type oscillators @xcite , velocity dependent oscillators @xcite , electronic circuits @xcite , and in certain maps @xcite .",
    "also , these exotic attractors were confirmed by an experiment consisting of a quasiperiodically forced , buckled , magnetoelastic ribbon @xcite , in analog simulations of a multistable potential @xcite , and in a neon glow discharge experiment @xcite .",
    "the snas are also related to the anderson localization in the schrdinger equation with a quasiperiodic potential @xcite and they may have a practical application in secure communication @xcite .    broadly the mechanisms for the birth of snas differ with the routes to sna followed by the dynamical systems .",
    "a list of the various mechanisms pertaining to different routes to chaos are listed in table - i @xcite .",

    "these bubbles then grow in size as the control parameter is increased .",
    "subsequently the strands of the bubbles start to wrinkle , giving birth to snas .",
    "the reason for this is that the quasiperiodic orbits become increasingly unstable in the transverse direction with the increase of the control parameter .",
    "this instability is induced by the square wave type quasiperiodic force resulting in an increase in the size of the doubled strands ( bubbles ) , followed by an enhanced wrinkling of these .",

    "after many successive doubling of the bubbles , snas are born .",

    "hence the former case clearly supports the loss of sensitive dependence on initial condition , which corresponds to the strange nonchaotic attractor , while the later one corresponds to a chaotic attractor .",
    "we have discussed about the bubble doubling dynamics qualitatively in section iii , by using poincar surface of section plots in the @xmath105 plane , also quantitatively by using maximal lyapunov exponent and sigular continuous spectrum analysis in section iv .",
    "in addition to the above it is also possible to distinguish torus and sna using distribution of finite time lyapunov exponent @xcite .",
    "distribution of finite time lyapunov exponent is taken for @xmath106 for the value of @xmath44 @xmath28 @xmath73 ]    it has been shown @xcite that a trajectory on a sna actually possesses positive lyapunov exponent in finite time intervals , although the asymptotic exponent is negative . as a consequence ,",
    "it is possible to observe different characteristic of the sna created through different mechanisms @xcite by studying the differences in the probability ( @xmath108 ) of distribution of finite time lyapunov exponent @xmath109 for positive and negative values .",
    "we have calculated the distribution of finite time lyapunov exponent @xmath110 for the attractor shown in fig .",
    "3b(i ) and have plotted the same in fig .",
    "( 7 ) . here",
    "we find that the distribution exhibits an elongated tail for the negative values , thereby confirming the existence of bubble doubling transition to sna .",
    "this may be explained as due to the fact that in the bubble doubling transition , the unaffected regions of the strands of the period@xmath652 torus remain so even after the birth of sna .",
    "in this paper , we have reported a novel machanism for the birth of strange nonchaotic attractor in quasiperiodically forced chua s circuit .",
    "we term this route as _ bubble doubling route _ to sna . at first",
    ", we have presented the appearence of bubble through poincar surface of cross section and the bifurcation of the bubble by varing the control parameter @xmath76 in the suitable range .",
    "further , we used power spectrum to qualitatively distinguish quasiperiodicity , sna and choatic attractor . followed by this , we have computed lyapunov exponent and its variance as a function of control parameter @xmath76 and these clearly distinguish the dynamical region of quasiperiodicity , sna and chaos . to confirm the presence of sna we have computed singular continuous spectrum , which clearly shows the fractal dimension of the sna and its fractal path in the complex plane .",
    "the separation of near by point test and distribution of the finite time lyapunov exponent also explains the presence of snas .",
    "it is to be noted that the formation of sna through this bubble doubling mechanism is significantly different from the well known mechanisms in the literature ( table - i ) .",
