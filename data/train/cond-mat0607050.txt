    "the existence of short - ranged resonating valence bond ( rvb ) liquids has been proposed in several two - dimensional quantum spin models @xcite .",
    "these liquids exhibit no kind of simple order but the ground states ( gs ) are degenerate if the lattice is put on a surface with a non - trivial topology ( cylinder , torus , etc . ) .",
    "it is ( widely ) believed that such degeneracy has a purely topological origin and is not ascribed to spontaneous symmetry breaking in terms of any local order parameter .",
    "this topological nature has been rigorously confirmed in a few exactly solvable models @xcite , but proving this property in more general cases is a challenging issue .    in this paper , we address this issue by formulating the problem in terms of reduced density matrices ( rdm ) as we proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this formulation",
    ", we examine the rdms of the degenerate gss for various subareas of the system and search for an operator distinguishing the degenerate gss , which means that it can be used as an order parameter .",
    "we define a convenient measure for this purpose , which is non - zero for an area where an order parameter can be defined . in conventional orders ,",
    "the measure is non - zero on some finite local area , which indicates the existence of an order parameter on that area . in rvb liquids , in contrast , it is expected that the measure is zero ( in the thermodynamic limit ) on any local area , thereby verifying topological order .    with this formulation ,",
    "we analyze the quantum dimer model ( qdm ) on the triangular lattice , which is one of the simplest microscopic models realizing rvb liquids @xcite .",
    "we numerically show that the dimer liquid in this model can not be characterized by any local order parameter .",
    "we formulate a method to detect an order parameter starting from a general setting .",
    "let @xmath0 be the degeneracy of the gss and @xmath1 be the orthonormal gss .",
    "for a state @xmath2 in the ground - state subspace , we define its rdm on an area @xmath3 by tracing out the degrees of freedom outside @xmath3 : @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the complement of @xmath3 .",
    "we also introduce as a reference the rdm averaged over the ground - state subspace : @xmath6 .",
    "note that @xmath7 is independent of the choice of the basis @xmath8 of the ground - state subspace .",
    "an order parameter can be defined on @xmath3 if and only if there exists @xmath2 such that @xmath9 .    to quantify to what extent rdms",
    "are distinguishable , we introduce a measure @xmath10 as follows .",
    "we first define a measure of difference between two rdms as @xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a ( variational ) hermitian operator on @xmath3 whose norm is less than unity , i.e. , @xmath13 for any normalized vector @xmath14 . using the eigenvalues @xmath15 of @xmath16 , this can be simplified as : @xmath17 .",
    "we define @xmath10 by maximizing @xmath18 over the choice of a gs @xmath2 : @xmath19 the value of @xmath10 in the thermodynamic limit tells us whether an order parameter can be defined on @xmath3 .",
    "the measure @xmath10 has the following useful properties : ( a ) normalization to a definite range @xmath20 .",
    "( b ) monotonicity : if an area @xmath21 completely contains an area @xmath3 , we have @xmath22 .    how to calculate @xmath10 is not clear from the definition . in the case of qdms ,",
    "a simple formula is available , which we derive in the next subsection .",
    "however , for the completeness of the method , here we briefly describe a general algorithm called _ iterative maximization_. the difficulty in calculating @xmath10 resides in the double maximizations in eqs .",
    "[ eq : diff ] and [ eq : domega ] , but we notice that each maximization is possible if either @xmath12 or @xmath2 is fixed .",
    "the idea is to alternately perform these two kinds of maximizations starting from a random vector @xmath2 .",
    "this would lead at least to a local maximum in the space of @xmath12 and @xmath2 . starting from various random vectors ,",
    "we would obtain the global maximum @xmath10 .",
    "this method has a potential to handle a wide range of problems .",
    "we limit the setting to the case of gapped dimer liquids in qdms on two - dimensional lattices , where further argument is possible .",
    "the gapped dimer liquids have been found in several qdms @xcite and related models @xcite .",
    "however , except for the special cases @xcite where the correlation length is strictly zero , it is difficult to prove the absence of all the local order parameter .",
    "this motivates us to study more general cases .",
    "let @xmath23 be the set of all the dimer coverings of the lattice .",
    "if the lattice has a non - trivial topology , @xmath23 can be grouped into topological sectors which are not mixed by any local operation .",
    "we concentrate on the case of the torus in the following .",
    "we draw two incontractible loops @xmath24 and @xmath25 which pass through the bonds and wind the torus in @xmath26 and @xmath27 directions respectively .",
    "we classify @xmath23 into four topological sectors @xmath28 with @xmath29 , depending on the parity of the number of dimers crossing @xmath24 and @xmath25 . in a gapped dimer liquid , the lowest - energy states @xmath30 in different topological sectors @xmath28 become degenerate in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "we employ @xmath30 s as the basis of the ground - state subspace .    to define rdms for qdms",
    ", we must specify the local degrees of freedom of the models . to this end , we assign an ising variable @xmath31 to each bond @xmath32 of the lattice as in ref .",
    "@xcite and identify the presence / absence of a dimer on the bond as @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively .",
    "any physical configuration @xmath35 must satisfy the hard - core constraints : for each site of the lattice , there must be exactly one bond with @xmath36 emanating from it .",
    "an area @xmath3 is defined as a set of bonds .",
    "we define the matrix element of the rdm of a gs @xmath2 as @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are dimer configurations on @xmath3 and the sum is over all the dimer configurations @xmath40 on @xmath5 .",
    "note that we set @xmath41 if @xmath42 is an unphysical configuration ( violating the hard - core constraint ) .",
    "we proceed to the evaluation of @xmath10 .",
    "we first assume that the area @xmath3 is topologically non - trivial , i.e. , @xmath3 encircles the torus . without loss of generality , we assume that @xmath3 contains @xmath24 .",
    "let us consider the following trial gs and trial operator : @xmath43 where in the second equation @xmath44 runs over all the dimer configurations on @xmath3 and @xmath45 is its parity along @xmath24 .",
    "these gives a lower bound of @xmath10 : @xmath46 thus the value of @xmath10 is consistent with the existence of a non - local order parameter .",
    "we next assume that @xmath3 is a ( finite ) local area . in this case",
    ", we can prove the following relation : @xmath47 to prove this relation , we explicitly express the matrix element of the lhs : @xmath48 since @xmath3 is local , we can choose @xmath24 and @xmath25 so as not to touch @xmath3 .",
    "then the dimer coverings @xmath49 and @xmath50 always belong to a common topological sector and therefore @xmath51 and @xmath52 can not become non - zero at the same time . hence we obtain eq .",
    "[ eq : qdmlocal ] .",
    "[ eq : qdmlocal ] , we can derive a simpler expression for @xmath10 : @xmath53 this is computable numerically and is employed in the calculation shown below .",
    "we consider the qdm on the triangular lattice .",
    "the hamiltonian reads @xcite : @xmath54.\\ ] ] at the rokhsar - kivelson ( rk ) point ( @xmath55 ) , the gs in each sector is exactly the equal - amplitude superposition of all the dimer coverings belonging to that sector @xcite : @xmath56 it has been numerically shown that the degeneracy of the gss and the exponential decay of the dimer - dimer correlation at the rk point persist up to some range in the parameter space , forming a dimer liquid phase in @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "we first numerically calculated @xmath10 for the rk wave function , eq .",
    "[ eq : rk - fn ] , through the direct enumeration of dimer coverings ( up to @xmath58 ) or the evaluation of pfaffians of kasteleyn matrices @xcite ( up to @xmath59 ) . the former method is suited for large areas while the latter can handle large systems .",
    "the lattice is put on the torus and is defined by two vectors @xmath60 and @xmath61 specifying the periodicity .",
    "we require that the lattice be symmetric under the @xmath62 rotation , choosing @xmath63 , where @xmath64 and @xmath65 are integers and @xmath66 and @xmath67 are unit vectors as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : circular - areas ] .",
    "the total number of sites is given by @xmath68 .",
    "as the choice of @xmath3 , we define circular areas in the following way : we draw a circle centered around a site or an interior of a triangle and regard every bond whose midpoint is in the circle as an element of the area ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : circular - areas ] ) .",
    "the values of @xmath10 for circular areas are plotted versus the radius @xmath69 in fig .",
    "[ fig : diff - rk ] ( a ) .",
    "though @xmath10 tends to increase as a function of @xmath69 , it remains small if @xmath69 is sufficiently smaller than the linear system size @xmath70 .",
    "it appears that an exponential dependence @xmath71 fits the data relatively well , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : diff - rk ] ( b ) .",
    "we also performed calculation for @xmath72 by obtaining gss by exact diagonalization .",
    "we fit the data in the same way and the resultant parameters @xmath73 are shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : diff - non - rk ] ( a ) .",
    "we observe that the relation @xmath74 holds approximately in the dimer liquid phase .",
    "this indicates that the finite size effect in @xmath10 enters through @xmath75 . to interpret this ,",
    "let us consider a loop encircling the torus and passing through @xmath3 ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : diff - non - rk ] ( b ) .",
    "some part of a loop is not covered by @xmath3 and the minimal length of the part is @xmath75 .",
    "the lack of this part makes the distinction of sectors obscure , hence the exponential reduction in @xmath10 .",
    "our result explicitly shows the topological nature of the liquid since @xmath10 goes to zero exponentially with @xmath76 _ for any fixed @xmath69_. this does not only exclude local order parameters which are diagonal in the dimer basis ( and amenable to exact calculations in the @xmath76 limit @xcite ) , but any , possibly non - diagonal , operator .",
    "the parameter @xmath77 is naturally interpreted as the inverse of a correlation length , and the value we obtained at the rk point is close to @xmath78 and @xmath79 obtained by ref .",
