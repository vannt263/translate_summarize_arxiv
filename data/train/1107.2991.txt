    "the classic kuramoto model @xcite , consisting of a ring of phase coupled oscillators , has for long served as a very useful and convenient paradigm for investigating collective phenomena in a variety of physical , chemical and biological systems @xcite . the original model employing a simple global ( all - to - all ) and constant uniform coupling between the oscillators , has subsequently been extended and generalized in various ways to improve its applicability as well as to explore a wider range of dynamics @xcite .",
    "one such generalized version that provides a closer representation of many real life situations , employs non - local coupling to account for diminution in the coupling strength as a function of distance and distance dependent time - delayed coupling to account for finite propagation velocities of information signals exchanged between oscillators @xcite .",
    "such a model displays a much richer variety of collective excitations including synchronous states @xcite and exotic _ chimera _ states @xcite",
    ". both non - locality and time delay play important roles in influencing the equilibrium and stability properties of these collective states and their combined presence often introduces novel effects . to the best of our knowledge , an analysis of the equilibria and stability of traveling wave states for the generalized model has not been done so far , excepting a few past studies that have employed simplified models or looked at special limits .",

    "@xcite considered a continuum system of coupled identical oscillators with a spatially decaying interaction kernel and modeled the space dependent time delay contribution through an effective phase shift term in the interaction .",
    "they also took the size of the system to be infinite for mathematical convenience but thereby effectively reduced the nature of the mutual coupling to a `` local '' one ( since the interaction length is always much smaller than the system length ) .",
    "zanette @xcite studied another simplified version of the generalized system where he adopted a distance independent ( global ) coupling between the oscillators positioned along a ring but introduced a distance dependent time delay in the interaction .",
    "he obtained numerical results on the stability of synchronous and propagating traveling waves and also some analytic results in the limit of small delay .",
    "ko & ermentrout @xcite recently investigated the effects of distance dependent delays in sparsely connected oscillator systems and found that a small fraction of connections with time delay can destabilize the synchronous states . since traveling wave states are basic ingredients for pattern formation in many real life systems such as arrays of josephson junctions @xcite , chemical oscillators @xcite , neural networks producing snail shell patterns and ocular dominance stripes @xcite etc .",
    "a determination of their stability properties within the framework of the generalized model is of fundamental importance . in this paper",
    "we present a systematic and comprehensive stability diagram of traveling wave states adopting a suite of numerical approaches that has proved successful in the past in delineating the stability of synchronous states of this fully generalized model @xcite .",
    "the stability diagram shows a rich structure of multi - stable regions in the parametric space of time delay and non - locality of the coupling with the traveling waves losing their stability across the marginal curves through a hopf bifurcation .",
    "interspersed among the stable regions there exist _ forbidden _ regions ( whose size and shape show a strong dependence on the intrinsic frequency of the oscillator ) in the phase diagram where no stable phase - locked solutions are possible .",
    "our numerical investigations also reveal the existence of a new class of non - stationary states for this system that are characterized by periodic oscillations of the complex order parameter and for which the phase and its temporal derivative have a non - linear dependence on space .",
