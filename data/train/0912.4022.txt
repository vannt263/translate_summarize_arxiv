    "a great hope for the future in radioactive beam experiments is to be able to map out the changing shell structure for very exotic nuclei , away from stability , where this arises from effects such as the monopole migration of orbital energies and the changes brought about by alterations in the surface environment and spin - orbit splitting@xcite .",
    "nucleon transfer reactions such as ( d , p ) , ( p , d ) etc .   are an established means of populating and studying nuclear levels that have a substantial single - particle structure",
    ". the development of techniques to use such reactions with radioactive beams , across a wide range of beam energies and masses and with high energy resolution , will open the way to exploit transfer across new regions of the nuclear chart and hence to study the new nuclear structure effects that evolve .",
    "the technique that is described here , and implemented via the new tiara array used in association with the vamos spectrometer and the exogam gamma - ray array , is designed to achieve excitation energy resolution of better than 20 - 40 kev in the final nucleus .",
    "this is an order of magnitude better than can be achieved in a reasonable experimental setup that uses charged - particle observations only@xcite .",
    "the complete kinematical detection of the binary transfer reaction products specifies the reaction channel cleanly , where the identification of the heavy ( beam - like ) particle at least in z is required , and the light ( target - like)-particle detection allows angular distributions to be measured for any mass of projectile .    the present paper updates and extends results of the analysis in progress , reported elsewhere@xcite .",
    "the requirement to use inverse kinematics in order to study nucleon transfer reactions , induced on radioactive species by protons and deuterons , imposes certain rather general requirements on the detection system to be used .",
    "the kinematics turns out to lead to particular reactions always appearing in the same characteristic range of laboratory angles and with similar energies , regardless of the mass or velocity of the incident beam@xcite .",
    "this allows a general purpose transfer apparatus to be designed .",
    "the design philosophy and detailed description of tiara has been discussed elsewhere@xcite but briefly the aim was to surround the target with a charged particle array that approached @xmath3 coverage , with reasonable energy measurment and an angular resolution of 1 or 2 degrees .",
    "this array needed to be very compact so that a high gamma - ray efficiency of @xmath415% ( at 1.3 mev ) could be achieved , whilst avoiding the exposure of gamma - ray detectors to decay radiation from beam particles scattered in the forward 40@xmath5 . in the present setup , the tiara array covers 82% of @xmath3 with active silicon and the gamma - ray detectors are in a close cube geometry and thus subtend 67% of @xmath3 .",
    "the setup is mounted in front of a magnetic spectrometer which is used to separate physically the direct beam and the transfer reaction products , after the target .",
    "the region around the target is shown in fig .",
    "[ tiara - pic ] .",
    "the tiara system was set up in front of the vamos spectrometer at ganil@xcite , which was operated in dispersive mode at zero degrees .",
    "direct beam was intercepted just in front of the focal plane detectors .",
    "the support frame and four detectors of exogam@xcite surrounded the tiara chamber .",
    "all events in which a particle was detected in tiara were recorded .",
    "the gamma ray parameters were recorded via the vamos acquisition system and events were correlated with tiara in real time via an event stamping method developed at ganil .",
    "an isotopically pure beam of @xmath0ne was supplied at 10 mev / nucleon after reacceleration in the cime cyclotron connected to the spiral facility at ganil .",
    "the beam intensity of @xmath2 pps was a factor of two lower than the maximum due to a limitation placed on the emittance , which limited the beam spot on target to a diameter of approximately 2 mm base width .",
    "the target was 1 mg/@xmath6 of cd@xmath7 self supporting on a thin 25 mm diameter frame .",
    "a test experiment was performed with a stable beam of @xmath8n at similar intensity and beam quality , in order to verify that normal kinematics ( d , p ) results from the literature could be reproduced with the tiara setup .",
    "good agreement was found@xcite .",
    "the isotopic identification for beam - like particles recorded at the focal plane of vamos is shown in fig.[pid ] .",
    "this is derived from measured @xmath9 , @xmath10 and time - of - flight parameters plus a ray tracing calculation that used the horizontal and vertical angles and positions measured at the focal plane .",
    "the ray tracing algorithm employed a neural network that was trained using a set of theoretically calculated rays obtained by numerical integration of their trajectories through vamos@xcite and this gives results identical to an algebraic algorithm developed at ganil .",
    "= 4.0 in    by selecting the @xmath0ne ions in fig .",
    "[ pid ] , the scattered deuterons recorded in tiara could be analysed .",
    "the @xmath0ne momentum changes sufficiently quickly with scattering angle that very forward scattered elastics can still avoid the beam stop .",
    "the energy of the deuterons changes rapidly with their angle@xcite and , by using energy cuts , the elastic angular distribution could be extracted ( see fig .",
    "[ elastics ] ) .",
    "a good fit was obtained using the optical potential measured for d+@xmath11 mg at a similar energy@xcite .",
    "the normalisation obtained using these elastic data allowed absolute transfer cross sections to be extracted with confidence .",
    "= 4.1 in    from the measured energy and angle recorded for protons from the ( d , p ) reaction to make @xmath1ne ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) the excitation energy spectrum for states in @xmath1ne could be deduced .",
    "different peaks in this spectrum could be used to gate the spectrum of associated gamma rays .",
    "example data are included in fig , [ gammas ] .",
    "an important result of this analysis was that the excitation energies of the populated states could be fixed with an accuracy of order 30 kev .",
    "the limiting factor in this accuracy was the poor statistics of the gamma ray spectrum .",
    "this was in fact severely compromised in the present experiment by an intermittent fault in an electronic discriminator unit , and the eventual aim in this type of experiment will be to use individual gamma ray peaks to apply gates in the analysis . in the present case , however , it was still of vital importance that the gamma ray data could fix the energies and the number of peaks to be fitted to the ( poorer resolution ) excitation energy spectra derived from the particle energies .",
    "these fits are shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ gammas ] .",
    "the data are just sufficient to allow limited gamma - gamma coincidence analysis . in the case of the state near 4 mev it can be seen that the 1.7 mev and 2.4 mev gamma rays seen in its decay ( fig .",
    "[ gammas](b ) ) appear to be in coincidence ( fig .",
    "[ gammas ] ( c ) and ( d ) ) .",
    "= 4.1 in    the excitation energy spectrum ( derived from the proton energy and angle ) was fitted with 5 peaks .",
    "the widths of these peaks depended on the experimental resolution of the system , and this was in turn dependent on the detection angle of the proton .",
    "thus , the data were binned for angular regions chosen to be 8@xmath5 wide in order to give sufficient statistics for fitting . in order to fit the angular distributions ,",
    "different optical model potentials were investigated , taken from ( d , p ) reactions on neighbouring nuclei @xmath11mg@xcite and @xmath12ne@xcite .",
    "a systematic comparison with adiabatic calculations according to the prescription of johnson and soper@xcite was also performed .",
    "the adiabatic analysis was adopted for the extraction of spectroscopic factors , which were determined by normalising the theoretical curve to the data for each state , with particular emphasis placed on the data for the smallest center of mass angles ( closest to 180@xmath5 in the laboratory)@xcite .",
    "the results of the analysis are included in table [ specfacs ] .",
    "the identifications of the spins are discussed below . in general ,",
    "spectroscopic factors extracted in this fashion have an uncertainty of order 20% arising from the assumptions in the reaction theory , and this is the dominant source of uncertainty in the quoted results .",
    ".results for states in @xmath1ne identified as being populated in neutron transfer on @xmath0ne .",
    "previous e@xmath13 is from reed _",
    "et al . _ and usd refers to a @xmath14 shell model calculation . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ specfacs ] +",
    "the key feature emerging from table [ specfacs ] is that the state identified as the first 3/2@xmath15 state in @xmath1ne , which reflects most directly the single particle energy of the @xmath16 shell model orbital , is substantially higher than predicted .",
    "the identification rests on both the relative strength of this `` particle '' state compared to the @xmath17 `` hole '' state and the observed gamma decay pathways .",
    "the shift of order 350 kev is presumably due to matrix elements in the usd effective interaction that are not well determined from data on less neutron rich nuclei .",
    "the shift can be understood very naturally in the monopole shift picture@xcite , in which the emptying of the @xmath18 proton orbital in the more neutron rich n=15 isotones removes an attractive interaction that lowers the neutron @xmath16 energy for nuclei closer to stability .",
    "this tends to make n=16 a magic number for neutron rich nuclei .",
    "simultaneously , the gap to the negative parity orbitals @xmath19 and @xmath20 is reduced and n=20 loses its magicity@xcite .",
    "the state identified as the 5/2@xmath15 is almost certainly the state seen in beta decay@xcite at 1.703 mev and has also been seen recently in neutron knockout from @xmath11ne@xcite .",
    "this latter observation also supports the identification of the 1.703 mev level as the hole state and the newly observed level at 2.03 mev as the 3/2@xmath15 state .",
    "the further implications of these results are still under investigation .",
    "we acknowledge with thanks the support of the ganil and lpc caen technicians , during the installation and commissioning of the tiara array . mr geoffrey moores ( university of paisley ) and the daresbury design staff are thanked for their vital contributions .",
    "this work was supported in the uk by epsrc grants held at surrey , paisley , daresbury and birmingham ."
