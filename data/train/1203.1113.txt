    "a somewhat more detailed discussion can be found in the following section .",
    "a common model for random regular graphs is the _ configuration model _ or _ pairing model _",
    "( see @xcite for more information ) .",
    "the model is defined as follows : start with @xmath1 buckets , each containing @xmath0 prevertices .",
    "then , separate these @xmath131 prevertices into pairs , choosing uniformly from every possible pairing .",
    "finally , collapse each bucket into a single vertex , making an edge between one vertex and another if a prevertex in one bucket is paired with a prevertex in the other bucket .",
    "this model has the advantage that choosing a graph from it conditional on it containing no loops or parallel edges is the same as choosing a graph uniformly from the set of graphs without loops and parallel edges .",
    "the model also allows for graphs of odd degrees , unlike the permutation model .",
    "it is possible to construct a process of growing random regular graphs similar to the one in this paper using a dynamic version of this model .",
    "given some initial pairing of prevertices labeled @xmath132 , extend it to a random pairing of @xmath133 by the following procedure : choose @xmath134 uniformly from @xmath135 .",
    "pair @xmath136 with @xmath134 . if @xmath137 , leave the other pairs unchanged ; if not , pair the previous partner of @xmath134 with @xmath138 .",
    "this is an analogue of the crp in the setting of random pairings , in that if the initial pairing is uniformly chosen , then so is the extended one .",
    "if @xmath0 is odd , we repeat this procedure a total of @xmath0 times to extend a random @xmath0-regular graph on @xmath1 vertices to have @xmath139 vertices ( when @xmath0 is odd , the number of vertices in the graph must be even ) . when @xmath0 is even , repeat @xmath140 times to add one new vertex to a random graph .",
    "in this way , we can construct a sequence of growing random regular graphs .",
    "we believe that all the results of this paper hold in this model with minor changes , with similar proofs .",
    "the study of the spectral properties of sparse regular random graphs is motivated by several different problems .",
    "these matrices do not fall within the purview of the standard techniques of random matrix theory ( rmt ) due to their sparsity and lack of independence between entries .",
    "however , extensive simulations @xcite point to conjectures that these matrices still belong to the universality class of random matrices . for example , it is conjectured via simulations @xcite that the distribution of the second largest eigenvalue ( in absolute value ) is given by the tracy ",
    "widom distribution . in the physics literature ,",
    "eigenvalues of random regular graphs have been considered as a toy model of quantum chaos @xcite .",
    "simulations suggest that the eigenvalue spacing distribution has the same limit as that of the wigner matrices . a limiting _",
    "gaussian wave _",
    "character of eigenvectors have also been conjectured @xcite . some fine properties of eigenvalues and eigenvectors can indeed be proved for a single permutation matrix ; see @xcite and @xcite .    somewhat complicating the matter is the fact that when the degree @xmath0 is kept fixed and we let @xmath1 go to infinity , several classical results about random matrix ensembles fail .",
    "a bit more elaboration on this point is needed .",
    "the two parameters in the ensemble of random graphs are the degree @xmath0 and the order @xmath1 . in the permutation model",
    "it is possible to construct random regular graphs for every possible value of @xmath141 where @xmath0 is an even positive integer and @xmath1 is any positive integer .",
    "hence , one can consider various kinds of limits of these parameters .",
    "we will refer as the _ diagonal _ limit the procedure of having a sequence of @xmath141 where both these parameters simultaneously go to infinity . to maintain sparsity , it is usually assumed that @xmath0 is at most poly - logarithmic in @xmath1 .",
    "no lower bound on the growth rate of @xmath0 is assumed .",
    "however , results are often easier to prove when @xmath0 is kept fixed and we let @xmath1 go to infinity .",
    "suppose for each @xmath0 one gets a limiting object ( say a probability distribution ) ; one can now take @xmath0 to infinity and explore limits of the sequence of these objects",
    ". we will refer to this procedure ( @xmath142 ) as the triangular limit .",
    "the triangular limit is often identical to the diagonal limit irrespective of the sequence through which the diagonal limit is taken , while maintaining sparsity .",
    "moreover , these limiting statistics frequently match with those of the goe ensemble and the real symmetric wigner matrices .",
    "this is true , for example , for the empirical spectral distribution @xcite and fluctuations of smooth linear eigenvalue statistics @xcite .",
    "our present result is a triangular limit result .",
    "let us first explain the connection with the massless gff .",
    "we follow definition 2.12 and the first example in section  2.5 of @xcite . consider the space of smooth real functions compactly supported on @xmath13 with the dirichlet inner product @xmath143 .",
    "let @xmath144 be the completion of this pre - hilbert space .",
    "the gff can be thought of as a random distribution @xmath145 which associates with every @xmath146 a mean zero gaussian random variable @xmath147 that is an @xmath148 isometry in the sense that @xmath149 .",
    "now , one can perform the integration of a function @xmath108 with @xmath145 by first integrating their traces over semicircular arcs of a fixed radius , and then a further integral over the radius . over the semicircular arcs fourier transforms ( or chebyshev polynomials , for real functions )",
    "provide an orthogonal basis for this gaussian field .",
    "as one parametrizes the radius properly , one obtains independent ornstein ",
    "uhlenbeck processes for each chebyshev polynomial .",
    "hence , these ou processes completely determine the gff covariance structure .",
    "this explains the word `` equivalent '' on page 2 , paragraph 4 , and is the essence of the calculations done in @xcite .",
    "see also  @xcite for a similar formalism for dyson s brownian motion on the circle .",
    "one of the reasons why we can not prove a full gff convergence is that the parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 behave independently of one another .",
    "the degree @xmath0 determines the support of the spectral distribution @xmath150 $ ] , asymptotically independent of @xmath1 . for wigner matrices ,",
    "the dimension itself determines the length of the spectral support .",
    "this results in the parametrization of ( [ eq : heightfn ] )",
    ". it should be possible to extend our results to a gff convergence by either letting @xmath0 grow with @xmath1 in the graph , or , even by letting @xmath0 grow with time for the limiting poisson structure in theorem [ mainthm : cycles ] . though we have not attempted this in the present article , we prove a result along these lines in  @xcite .",
