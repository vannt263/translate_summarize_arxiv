    "many phenomena in nature can be described by networks .",
    "neuroscientists have used tools for the analysis of complex networks that help realize the functionality and structure of the brain .",
    "it was found that many aspects of brain network structures can be found in a wide range of non - neural complex networks @xcite as well .",
    "one of the main findings in neuroscience is the modular organization of the brain , which in turn implies an inherent parallel nature of brain computations @xcite .",
    "modular processors have to be sufficiently isolated and dynamically differentiated to achieve independent computations , but also globally connected to be integrated in coherent functions @xcite .",
    "moreover , it has been found that the cortical network is hierarchical and clustered with a complex connectivity @xcite pattern .",
    "a possible network description for this modular organization is that brain networks may be small - world structured @xcite with properties similar to other complex non - neural networks @xcite .",
    "this idea is further supported by the systematic finding of small - world topology in a wide range of human brain networks derived from structural @xcite , functional @xcite , and diffusion tensor mri @xcite studies .",
    "the small - world topology has also been identified at the cellular - network scale in functional cortical neural circuits in mammals @xcite and also in the nervous system of the nematode _ caenorhabditis elegans _ ( _ c.elegans _ ) @xcite .",
    "one of the oldest problems in psychophysics is the relation between external stimulus and neural response @xcite .",
    "it is expected to be nonlinear as a linear one would lead to an unbounded neural response , not observed in real sensorial organs .",
    "in contrast , neurons actually exhibit a limited ability to respond to external stimulations .",
    "it is thus reasonable to consider a kind of saturation during which the response remains practically the same as the stimulus continues to increase .",
    "stevens @xcite proposed that this relation is given by the power - law @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the magnitude of the response , @xmath2 the magnitude of the applied stimulus and @xmath3 a positive response exponent that is usually smaller than 2 .",
    "@xmath3 depends on the type of stimulus and attains different values .",
    "for example , it was found that the response to a vibrating plate captured by the sensorial organs in the finger leads to @xmath4 and @xmath5 for 60 hz and 250 hz vibrations , respectively .",
    "this power - law dependence is valid within some bounds for @xmath2 due to anatomical and physiological limitations . to quantify the response intensity within these bounds",
    ", one can employ the dynamic range which is the difference between the smallest and largest response intensity , expressed in decibels ( db ) . according to @xcite ,",
    "the human senses of sight and hearing have a large dynamic range of 90 db and 100 db , respectively . the variability of the values of @xmath3 and the big differences in the dynamic range for different sensory organs are currently interesting subjects in computational neuroscience . in this context , it is interesting to investigate macroscopically observed features such as the dynamic range and exponent @xmath3 driven by the application of external , locally applied , electrical perturbations affecting the underlying complex neuronal dynamics . by locally , we mean the application of external stimulations to particular ensembles or groups of neurons of the brain network . in such cases ,",
    "the firing rate of a neuron @xmath6 , i.e. the number of spikes per time unit , can be used to study its response to external stimuli .",
    "initially , the external stimulus is injected to a group of neurons as an input current .",
    "usually , this has the form of a sequence of random stereotypical electrical impulses driven by a constant average input rate @xmath7 .",
    "one then studies macroscopically the stimulus - response curve for single neurons or ensembles of neurons that perform similar tasks .",
    "this curve provides the input rate @xmath7 - firing rate @xmath6 relation in the form of a power - law dependence within some bounds for @xmath7 , for which the curve does not saturate but increases ( see for example fig .",
    "[ fig : average_firing_rate_p ] ) .",
    "consequently , one then estimates the exponent @xmath3 of the power - law dependence by a linear fitting , and the dynamic range @xmath8 can be estimated by the bounds of the input rate @xmath7 for which @xmath3 is estimated .",
    "there is experimental evidence suggesting that the dynamic range of a single neuron is smaller than the dynamic range macroscopically observed for ensembles of neurons .",
    "for example , the dynamic range of neurons of the olfactory system is about 10 db whereas the corresponding dendro - dendritic neural network in the glomeruli has three times larger dynamic range @xcite .",
    "the reason is that @xmath8 can be thought of as a collective effect attributed to the topology of the network .",
    "there are two mechanisms that contribute to the dynamic range and makes it larger for ensembles of neurons .",
    "the first one is the intrinsic threshold variations in networks of sensory neurons @xcite and the second the adaptation of single neurons to the statistics of the ambient stimuli @xcite .",
    "it has been recently found in @xcite that the elimination of gap junctions attributed to electrical synapses causes a decrease of the dynamic range and an increase of the exponent @xmath3 .",
    "thus , the enhancement of the dynamic range is possible by considering simultaneously electrical and chemical connections between different neurons .",
    "the authors in @xcite studied the dynamic range in small - world networks of hodgkin - huxley neurons with chemical synapses and found that the dynamic range of sensory organs is larger than that of single neurons and that it increases with the network size .",
    "they suggested that the enhancement of the dynamic range observed in sensory organs , with respect to single neurons , is an emergent property of complex networks dynamics .",
    "however , their study does not take into consideration electrical synapses for local neural connectivity , as the authors in ref .",
    "@xcite do . even though most of the neural synapses involved in sensory organs",
    "are electrical ( i.e. gap junctions ) , chemical synapses are also important to take into consideration in more realistic models .    in this work ,",
    "we go one step further and study , by means of the dynamic range theory , the effect of the application of external electrical stimuli , modelled by poisson processes of fixed average input rate @xmath7 , to specific neural ensembles ( i.e. communities ) of the brain dynamical network ( bdn ) of the _ c.elegans _ soil worm ( see subsec .",
    "[ subsubsection_c.elegans_data ] of the methodology for the details ) , considering at the same time electrical and chemical connections .",
    "we aim to study external perturbations spreading to other communities of the bdn . by bdn we mean a brain network , given here by the connectome of the _ c.elegans _ brain , in which each node is equipped with neural dynamics ( see subsec .",
    "[ subsection_hindmarsh - rose_model_for_brain_dynamics ] ) .",
    "the novelty of this work is two - folded : first , we use the _",
    "c.elegans _ bdn as it is a realistic small - world network @xcite , almost completely mapped @xcite .",
    "we implement the external perturbations as poisson processes because they are characterized by the property that the probability of firing a spike is independent of the firing activity at previous times .",
    "this implies that the interspike intervals @xmath9 are independent of the past spiking activity .",
    "the second novelty is that we excite single communities of the _ c.elegans _ bdn independently by supplying external electrical stimuli to all neurons of the perturbed community , following a poisson process , while keeping the rest in an unperturbed state .",
    "we use the same communities identified in ref .",
    "@xcite in the _ c.elegans _ bdn ( see subsec . [ subsection_analysis_of_communities ] of methodology ) .",
    "we endow each neuron of the bdn with hindmarsh - rose dynamics , represented by eq . , and couple them locally , within each community , with electrical connections of strength @xmath10 and nonlocally ( i.e. intercommunity communication ) with chemical connections of strength @xmath11 ( for the details see subsec .",
    "[ subsection_hindmarsh - rose_model_for_brain_dynamics ] ) .",
    "this setup , although artificial , is reminiscent of the modular organization of the brain and allows us to model the neural activity of the bdn and extract useful conclusions for the response of neural ensembles to external stimuli applied in different parts . in our study",
    ", we prepare parameter spaces for different coupling strengths @xmath11 and @xmath10 for the chemical and electrical connections , respectively , and , compute the dynamic range @xmath8 and steven law exponent @xmath3 for the different communities and the full network .",
    "this approach allows us to understand for which coupling regions , the external electrical perturbations @xmath2 applied to particular communities of the _ c.elegans _ spread to others and to the full bdn .",
    "we do that by testing the power - law dependence of the stimulus - response relation within some bounds of the average input rate of the poisson process and the ranges of chemical and electrical coupling strengths for which an enhancement of the dynamic range can be observed .",

    "we base our analysis for the bdn of the _ c.elegans _ soil worm on ref .",
    "particularly , we use the connectome of the large somatic nervous system found in ref .",
    "@xcite that consists of 277 neurons .",
    "we use the undirected version of the adjacency matrix provided there because we are not concerned here with the direction of the information flow , and simulate the dynamics of the single neurons by hr neural dynamics given in eq . .",
    "we couple them by the corresponding adjacency matrix obtained from the connectome of the _ c.elegans _ using eqs . .",
    "the complexity of the circuitry of the nervous system of the _ c.elegans _ is rather big , let alone the complexity of the human brain which contains about 86 billion neurons and thousands times more synapses @xcite !",
    "we study the _",
    "c.elegans _ nervous system in order to develop understanding about the human nervous system and its response to external stimulations .",
    "this is because both humans and _ c.elegans_ nervous systems consist of neurons and the communication or flow of information is passing through synapses that use neurotransmitters to perform brain activity . many of these neurotransmitters are common in humans and in the _",
    "c.elegans_ , such as glutamate , gaba , acetylcholine and dopamine .",
    "a synapse is a junction between pairs of neurons and is a mean through which neurons communicate with each other .",
    "there are electrical and chemical synapses : an electrical synapse ( gap junction ) is a physical connection between two neurons which allows electrons to pass through neurons by a very small gap between nerve cells .",
    "electrical synapses are bidirectional and of a local character , existing between neurons whose cells are close .",
    "they are believed to contribute to the regulation of synchronization in brain networks .",
    "in contrast , chemical synapses are special junctions through which the axon of the pre - synaptic neuron comes close to the post - synaptic cell membrane of another neuron or non - neural cell and chemical neurotransmitters are released .",

    "[ fig : commm4_dr ] , [ fig : commm6_dr ] and , s7 , s9 of the supplemental material @xcite for external perturbations initially applied to the fourth and sixth communities , with possibly slight variations with respect to the amount of the collective neural activation , such as in the first community in fig . [ fig : commm6_dr ] .    our results for the large dynamic ranges ( i.e. the red and orange regions in the parameter spaces of figs .",
    "[ fig : commm2_dr ] , [ fig : commm4_dr ] and [ fig : commm6_dr ] ) complement those reported in ref .",

    "particularly , the authors found that the coupling strength regions for which the information flow capacity @xmath98 is maximal in the _ c.elegans _ bdn ( red region in fig .",
    "2b in ref .",
    "@xcite ) are similar to those for high dynamic ranges identified in this work . since",
    ", maximal @xmath98 is attributed to low neural synchronization and self - criticality @xcite in this region , we associate the large dynamic ranges obtained here to these two important properties exhibited by the bdn . in other words , self - criticality ,",
    "low level neural synchronization and maximal information flow capacity seem to be prominent conditions for the _ c.elegans _ bdn to respond to external electrical perturbations .",
    "what is even more fascinating and reminiscent of realistic neurophysiological experiments is that these responses are triggered when stimulating specific communities of the bdn and that it does not happen for all of them .",
    "a possible interpretation of these findings is that when the bdn is responding to external perturbations , the communities are able to exchange the largest possible amounts of information between them , i.e. maximize their information flow capacity .",
    "in this paper we studied the effect of the application of external electrical stimuli to specific communities of the brain dynamical network of the _ c.elegans _ soil worm , given by the connectome of its large somatic nervous system .",
    "we systematically studied external , electric perturbations and their responses in its brain dynamic network , and modelled the external stimulations by poisson processes of fixed average input rate .",
    "we aimed to study how these perturbations spread to other communities and for which coupling strengths the spreading occurs .    the partition of the _ c.elegans _ brain network into communities is reminiscent of the modular organization of the brain .",
    "our study was inspired by an experiment in which external electrical stimuli are applied to a specific part of the brain to see how and if persistent neural activity is triggered in other cortical regions .",
    "we showed that when one perturbs specific communities such as the second , fourth and sixth , keeping the rest unperturbed , the external stimulations are able to propagate to other communities of the brain network .",
    "that depends on the initially perturbed one .",
    "our approach allowed us to understand for which coupling regions and communities , the external perturbations spread to others by computing the power - law dependence of the stimulus - response relation and by estimating the dynamic range and steven law exponent .",
    "our results complement those reported recently in ref .",
    "@xcite , as the coupling strength regions for which the information flow capacity was found to be maximal in the _ c.elegans _ brain dynamical network@xcite are similar to those found here for high dynamic ranges . in ref .",
    "@xcite , information flow capacity was found to become maximal when neural synchronization is low , for coupling strengths for which the system works at self - criticality with only one positive lyapunov exponent .",
    "the latter behaviors are associated with the large dynamic ranges found here as they occur for the same coupling strength regions , and imply that self - criticality , low level neural synchronization and maximal information flow capacity seem to be prominent conditions for the _",
    "c.elegans _ brain dynamical network to respond to external electrical perturbations . in this case , the responses are triggered when stimulating specific communities of the brain dynamical network and not just any .",
    "we interpreted this behavior as the ability of the brain network to respond to external perturbations when it works at self - criticality and its information flow capacity becomes maximal .",
    "finally , we believe it would be interesting to extend this study in brain networks coming for example from human subjects to check if self - criticality , maximal information flow and large dynamic ranges are also related to the ability of these brain networks to respond to external perturbations , similarly to what was found here for the _ c.elegans _ brain network .",
