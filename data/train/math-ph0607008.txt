    "the quantum ergodicity theorem is one of the central results in quantum chaos .",
    "essentially , it asserts that in systems in which the classical dynamics is ergodic the probability measures associated with the squares of the moduli of the quantum eigenfunctions converge to the classical invariant measure as one approaches the semiclassical limit through almost all sequences of eigenstates ( any exceptional subsequences have density zero ) .",
    "this was originally proved for flows @xcite , but it has since been extended to discrete dynamical systems ( chaotic maps ) ; see , for example @xcite ( for a very readable introduction to the subject , the reader should consult @xcite ) .",
    "the methods of proof typically involve applying egorov - type theorems , which relate the time evolution of quantum and classical observables in the semiclassical limit .",
    "quantum graphs correspond to associating an operator with a graph .",
    "for example , this might be the discrete laplacian acting at the vertices , or the one - dimensional laplacian acting on functions defined on the edges of a ( metric ) graph , with matching conditions applied at the vertices .",
    "such systems have recently been the subject of considerable interest @xcite . in particular ,",
    "quantum graphs have emerged as important toy models of quantum chaotic behaviour @xcite : if one considers sequences of graphs with increasing numbers of edges then , under certain conditions , the quantum eigenvalue statistics converge to those of random matrix theory @xcite .",
    "however , relatively little attention has been paid to their eigenfunction statistics .",
    "for example , quantum ergodicity has not been proved in this context .",
    "even though the classical ( markovian ) dynamics on a fixed graph is mixing , the difficulty lies in dealing with sequences of graphs with increasing numbers of bonds . to date , the only examples that have been studied in this limit are the star graphs ( in which the bonds are connected at a single central vertex ) .",
    "however , even though any given star graph is classically ergodic , the limit as the number of bonds tends to infinity is not quantum ergodic @xcite .",
    "this is not altogether surprising because the star graphs do not satisfy the condition under which one expects the spectral statistics to coincide with those of random matrix theory ( instead , their spectral statistics coincide with those of integrable systems perturbed by a singular scatterer @xcite ) .",
    "it turns out that the star graph eigenfunctions are strongly scarred by short periodic orbits ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the problem of finding examples of sequences of quantum graphs that are quantum ergodic thus remains open .",
    "it is this problem that we address here .",
    "we start by discussing how the question of quantum ergodicity on general graphs can be related to the ergodic properties of the eigenvectors of an _ ensemble _ of unitary matrices .",
    "each ensemble consists of matrices @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is a fixed unitary matrix , determined by the corresponding graph , and @xmath3 is a random diagonal unitary matrix .    we then identify a particular sequence of graphs ( or matrices @xmath2 ) for which quantum ergodicity can be established .",
    "these are graphs obtained from a construction proposed by paknski _ et al _ @xcite involving ergodic one - dimensional maps on an interval .",
    "we also prove the analogue of egorov s theorem for these graphs .",
    "to be explicit , given a one - dimensional , lebesgue - measure - preserving map @xmath4\\to[0,1]$ ] , we consider an increasingly refined sequence of partitions @xmath5 of the interval @xmath6 $ ] . to this sequence",
    "we associate a sequence of graphs @xmath7 whose directed edges ( bonds ) correspond to elements of the partitions .",
    "the quantum evolution on @xmath7 is described by a unitary matrix @xmath8 such that the corresponding classical ( markov ) dynamics of @xmath7 approximates the perron - frobenius operator associated with @xmath9 .    to a classical observable @xmath10",
    "$ ] we associate a sequence of quantum observables @xmath11 which are defined as operators corresponding to multiplication by the average value of @xmath12 on an element of the partition .",
    "we prove that there is a sequence of sets @xmath13 such that @xmath14 and for all sequences @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the @xmath19-th eigenvector of the graph @xmath7 ( compare to the corresponding statement for cat maps , @xcite ) .",
    "this is the analogue of `` quantum ergodicity '' for the graphs in question .",
    "it is equivalent to the decay of the quantum variance , @xmath20 in the limit @xmath21 .",
    "this equivalence follows from a chebyshev - type inequality and parallels the textbook proof of the statement `` for uniformly bounded random variables , convergence in mean square is equivalent to convergence in probability '' .",
    "if @xmath12 is lipschitz continuous , we also prove the egorov property , @xmath22 where @xmath8 is the quantum transfer operator corresponding to the graph @xmath7 .",
    "the existence of the egorov property provides further justification for the use of the term `` quantization '' when referring to the sequence @xmath8 obtained from a map @xmath9 .",
    "it should be noted that we do not explicitly use the egorov property ( ep ) in the proof of quantum ergodicity ( qe ) .",
    "even though the more traditional route of deriving qe from ep is available to us , we feel that the proof in the present form is likely to be more adaptable to other families of quantum graphs .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we review some of the main issues relating to the construction of quantum graphs . in section 3",
    "we introduce the construction of paknski _ et al _ @xcite and proceed to discuss some of its properties . in particular , we prove a sufficient condition for a map to be quantizable in the fashion described by @xcite .",
    "this sufficient condition , although rather restrictive , demonstrates that the class of quantizable maps is sufficiently rich to be interesting .    in section 4",
    "we introduce the observables on the quantum graphs obtained from maps .",
    "their quantum variance is analyzed in section 5 . in sections 6 and 7",
    "we prove quantum ergodicity for these observables by estimating two different contributions to the variance , and in section 8 we prove the egorov property in this context .",
    "finally , in section 9 we discuss some of the issues arising in the proof of these theorems and the possibility of extending the proofs to larger classes of graphs .",
    "a _ quantum graph _ can be defined in two different , but related , ways . in both constructions",
    "we start with a graph @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a finite set of vertices ( or nodes ) , and @xmath25 is the set of bonds ( or edges ) .",
    "each bond @xmath26 has a non - zero length , denoted @xmath27 .",
    "the lengths @xmath27 are assumed to be rationally independent .",
    "the first way to define a quantum graph @xcite is to identify each bond @xmath26 with the interval @xmath28 $ ] of the real line and thus define the @xmath0-space of functions on the graph",
    ". then one can consider the eigenproblem @xmath29 this setup has been studied by mathematicians since the 1980s @xcite and was used in physical models prior to that @xcite .    to make the operator in ( [ eq : shrod_eq ] ) self - adjoint we need to impose matching conditions on the behavior of @xmath30 at the vertices of the graph .",
    "one possibility is to impose kirchhoff conditions : we require that @xmath30 is continuous on the vertices , and that the probability current is conserved , i.e. @xmath31 where the sum is over all bonds that originate from the vertex @xmath32 ( the bonds are now taken to be undirected ) and the derivatives are taken at the vertex @xmath32 in the outer direction .",
    "the admissible boundary conditions were classified in , among other sources , @xcite .",
    "the second construction considers wave propagation on the graph where each vertex is treated as a scatterer and the propagation along the bonds is free .",
    "this construction was first considered in @xcite and generalized in @xcite to directed graphs .    in both constructions",
    "one ends up with a unitary matrix @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the diagonal matrix of the bond lengths .",
    "this matrix gives the eigenvalues @xmath35 of ( [ eq : shrod_eq ] ) via the equation @xmath36 the dimension of the above matrices is equal to the number @xmath37 of _ directed _ bonds of the graph @xmath38 . if the bonds were initially undirected , each bond is split into two directed bonds of the same length .",
    "in various sources the notion of the `` spectrum @xmath39 of the graph @xmath38 '' can refer either to the eigenproblem ( [ eq : shrod_eq ] ) ( and thus solutions of ( [ eq : sec_eq ] ) ) or to the eigenphases of the matrix @xmath40 for an arbitrary @xmath41 .",
    "this is not as confusing as it might seem , since the statistical properties of both versions of the spectrum are conjectured to coincide when averaged over a large interval of @xmath41 .",
    "similarly , the `` eigenvector '' of @xmath38 can refer to one of three objects :    1 .",
    "the function @xmath42 that solves ( [ eq : shrod_eq ] ) , subject to boundary conditions , for some @xmath43 , 2 .",
    "the eigenvector of @xmath44 corresponding to the eigenvalue 1 , denoted by @xmath45 , 3 .",
    "any eigenvector of @xmath40 for arbitrary @xmath41 , denoted by @xmath46 .",
    "there is a simple correspondence between the first two notions of the eigenvector : the solution @xmath42 is a superposition of plane waves with coefficients given by the elements of @xmath45 .",
    "below we discuss a heuristic formula which connects the ergodic properties of the second and the third types of eigenvectors .",
    "this formula provides an additional motivation for the results in the main body of our paper , where we study the eigenvectors @xmath46 .",
    "it should be mentioned that these results are fully rigorous and do not rely on the heuristic connection .    to proceed , we need to introduce more notation .",
    "by @xmath47 we will denote the @xmath48-th eigenvector of @xmath40 .",
    "our observables are diagonal matrices @xmath49 acting in the space of directed bonds .",
    "the matrix @xmath34 , as before , is the diagonal matrix of the bond lengths . the average bond length , @xmath50 , is denoted by @xmath51 .",
    "quantum ergodicity is the property of almost all eigenvectors to equidistribute .",
    "this is equivalent to the vanishing of the variance in some limit .",
    "for example , we would like to prove that the variance of @xmath52 ( and , correspondingly , @xmath53 ) vanishes . at this point",
    "two obvious questions arise : ( a ) with respect to which ensemble is the variance taken , and ( b ) in which limit is it expected to vanish ?",
    "taking , without loss of generality , @xmath54 to be zero , we define two variances @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the mean number of the eigenvalues in the interval @xmath57 $ ] .    a heuristic calculation presented in appendix  [ sec : var_rel ]",
    "suggests that , if the bond lengths are rationally independent , @xmath58 thus , if the lengths of the bonds are taken from a narrow distribution , the two variances are intimately connected .",
    "moreover , following @xcite one can show that the limit on the right - hand side coincides with the average of @xmath59 , where @xmath3 are uniformly distributed random unitary diagonal matrices .",
    "thus equation  ( [ eq : var_rel ] ) relates the quantum ergodic properties of a graph to the like properties of an _ ensemble _ of random matrices .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : var_rel ] ) suggests that one can not in general expect the variance to vanish in the limit @xmath60 .",
    "it is natural , however , to expect ergodicity in the limit @xmath61 ( cf .",
    "a serious associated problem here is the choice of an appropriate sequence of graphs and observables .",
    "one sequence of graphs , the quantum star graphs , has been investigated in @xcite , and it was found , in particular , that the variance @xmath62 does not vanish even when @xmath61 .",
    "this is not altogether surprising because the star graphs are known to exhibit non - standard spectral statistics @xcite , corresponding to integrable systems perturbed by a point - scatterer , rather than to chaotic systems @xcite ( for a review of the quantum fluctuation statistics of star graphs see @xcite ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that the spectral gap in their markov transition matrix closes more quickly as @xmath61 ( like @xmath63 ) than is the case for graphs exhibiting truly quantum chaotic behaviour .",
    "the lack of quantum ergodicity for the star graphs is related to the existence of strong scarring of the eigenfunctions by short periodic orbits . in the present article",
    "we study sequences of graphs generated from 1-dimensional maps of an interval in a fashion suggested in @xcite .",
    "we prove that for a suitable choice of observables , the variance @xmath64 converges to 0 for any @xmath41 , given that the original 1-dimensional map was ergodic .",
    "this is a stronger statement than the convergence when averaged with respect to @xmath41 , as suggested by relation  ( [ eq : var_rel ] ) .",
    "paknski _ et al _ @xcite proposed a procedure to associate a sequence of quantum graphs to a one - dimensional map of an interval . in this section",
    "we review their construction and proceed to investigate some of its properties .",
    "we consider maps of an interval , which we take to be @xmath6 $ ] .",
    "a _ partition _",
    "@xmath65 of the interval @xmath6 $ ] will be taken to mean a finite collection of open disjoint intervals @xmath66 ( henceforth called _ atoms _ ) such that @xmath67 = \\overline{\\bigcup_{j=1}^m e_j},\\ ] ] where @xmath68 denotes the number of intervals in the partition .",
    "we will denote by @xmath69 the set of endpoints of the partition @xmath65 . in a slight abuse of the notation we will also denote by @xmath65 the @xmath70-algebra generated by the atoms of the partition @xmath65 . when considering sequences @xmath71 of partitions , each partition will be a refinement of the previous one , @xmath72 .",
    "we will write @xmath73 to describe this statement .",
