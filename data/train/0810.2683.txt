    "in the framework of the eu marie curie network `` constellation : the origin of stellar masses '' , we conducted a deep imaging survey of the star forming region ic  348 @xcite with the aim to find isolated planetary mass objects , with a mass of a few m@xmath2 , and constrain the low mass end of the initial mass function .",
    "deep , wide - field broad - band zjhk and narrow - band ch4 on / off images were obtained at cfht . image analysis focused on faint source detection , and a number of photometric tests were conducted to ensure good photometric reliability and completeness down to k@xmath019.5  mag .",

    "we report the detection of 4 methane dwarf candidates in the young star forming region ic  348 .",
    "we tentatively estimate a spectral type in the range t3-t5 or even later , which would make these candidates amongst the least massive isolated objects ever detected in a star forming region .",
    "although follow up observations are clearly needed , spectroscopic confirmation will be difficult owing to the faintness of the candidates .",
    "this research is supported by the marie curie research training network `` constellation '' under grant no .",
