    "the classification of the galaxies in a 3-d galaxy map provides invaluable information for studying the formation and evolution of galaxies in relation to the large - scale structure . with these goals in mind ,",
    "we have performed a spectral classification for the eso - sculptor faint galaxy redshift survey ( ess , hereafter ; @xcite ) .",
    "the photometric catalogue of the ess is based on ccd imaging and provides the b , v and r(johnson - cousins ) photometry of @xmath5 galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "the spectroscopic catalogue provides the flux - calibrated spectra of a complete sub - sample of @xmath6700 galaxies with @xmath7 obtained by multi - slit spectroscopy ( @xcite ) .",
    "the ess allows for the first time to map in detail the large - scale clustering at @xmath8 ( @xcite ) .",
    "morphological classification ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , is based on the recognition of image patterns and it naturally started with the investigation of the nearest galaxies . for non - local galaxies , producing an _ objective _ morphological classification in the same classification system as for local galaxies is extremely difficult and would require a very complex taxonomy ( @xcite ) .",
    "the major limitation is the angular resolution given by ground - based telescopes .",
    "only a rough classification can be made , for example by fitting de vaucouleurs or exponential profiles or using the relationship between the central concentration index and the mean surface brightness ( @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , this method can only be applied up to modest redshifts ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "recently , with the refurbished hubble space telescope ( hst ) , can one see the detailed morphology of galaxies up to @xmath10 ( or i @xmath11 ) ( @xcite ) and derive an acceptable morphological description up to @xmath12 ( @xcite ) .",
    "galaxies at these very high redshifts present a wide variety of morphologies , when compared to the nearby galaxies .",
    "however , when high redshift galaxies ( @xmath13 ) are observed through visual photometric filters ( _ e.g. , _ the hst filters ) , the morphology is delineated by the redshifted blue or the uv emission due to young stars or by star - forming regions , making the objects appear of later morphological types than they really are .",
    "this effect could partially explain the high rate of distorted galaxies in the hubble deep field ( hdf ) ( @xcite ) . in summary ,",
    "the existing morphological classifications are severely dependent on the image spatial resolution , on the photometric filter , and as a result , on the redshift of the objects .",
    "in contrast to the qualitative approach of the morphological classification , the principal physical characteristics of galaxies can be efficiently quantified by their spectral energy distributions ( sed ) . for a given galaxy , the sed measures the relative contribution of the most representative stellar populations and constrains the gas content and average metallicity .",
    "it is therefore sensible to classify galaxies along a spectral sequence rather than a morphological sequence .",
    "morgan & mayall ( 1957 ) have shown that indeed there is a fundamental relationship between spectra of galaxies and their morphologies : three different populations which in general constitute every galaxy @xmath14the gas and the young and old stars ( @xcite , @xcite)@xmath14 contribute both to delineate the main morphological features ( bulge , spirals arms , etc ... ) , and the spectral features ( the continuum shape , the emission lines and absorption bands ) .",
    "the spectral classification has several advantages over the morphological classification .",
    "the spectral range covered by low resolution spectroscopy ( r @xmath6 500 ) is wider than the standard filters , and thus allows to define a common interval for objects describing a wide range of redshifts .",
    "furthermore , spectra are easier to handle than 2-d images when a large amount of data is processed .    in this paper",
    "we perform the spectral classification of the galaxies in the ess , using the principal component analysis ( pca ) .",
    "the pca technique has been applied to many problems of variate nature , from social to biological sciences . in astronomy , it is frequently used for compressing data to extract the variables which are truly correlated ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the pca has already been used to study inherent relationships between some selected features or quantities calculated from the spectra of seyfert galaxies ( equivalent widths and line ratios ) and their photometric magnitudes ( @xcite ) , and on qso spectra ( @xcite ) . in a recent study , connolly ( 1995 )",
    "have tested the pca using the spectral and morphological templates of kinney ( 1996 ) , to show how the spectral properties and the hubble sequence are related .",
    "using kennicutt spectra ( kennicutt 1992a ) , folkes , lahav & maddox ( 1996 ) and sodre & cuevas ( 1997 ) , show the correlation between spectral properties and morphological type for normal galaxies .    here",
    "we further test the pca technique as a tool to achieve a reliable spectral classification for a new sample of distant galaxies .",
    "the pca method is shown to be a powerful tool for measuring both , the systematic _ and _ non - systematic spectral properties of a galaxy sample .",
    "we also study the behavior of the pca with respect to the data noise level .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "2 we describe the eso - sculptor ( ess ) spectroscopic data . in ",
    "3 a brief overview of the pca technique and its application to the spectral classification are given , as well as the classification procedure using the @xmath2 test . in ",
    "4 we apply the pca to a sample of normal kennicutt galaxies , and illustrate some specific features of the method . in ",
    "5 the pca is applied to the ess .",
    "the analysis and the spectral classification are described in  6 , along with the visual classification for the brightest galaxies . in ",
    "7 we compare our main results with those of other studies .",
    "the conclusions and prospects are summarized in  8 .",
    "table [ info_survey ] below lists the main parameters and characteristics of the spectroscopic sample of the ess .",
    "the redshifts are measured by cross - correlation with galaxy templates which have been tested for the reliability of the redshift scale which they provide ( @xcite ) . for the @xmath15 of galaxies with emission lines ,",
    "an `` emission redshift '' is also measured by fitting the detected lines ( mostly [ oii ] , h@xmath16 , and [ oiii ] at 4958 @xmath17 and 5007  ) . when the absorption and emission redshift agree , a weighted average is derived .",
    "the mean errors in the redshifts are given in table [ info_survey ] .",
    "detailed information on the acquisition and redshift measurements are described in bellanger ( 1995 ) .",
    "the present spectral analysis is based on the subsample of 347 spectra having r(cousins ) @xmath18 20.5 , s / n @xmath19 5 , a reliable redshift measurement , and a spectro - photometric quality ( see below ) . the remaining data to bring the redshift survey to completion are in the course of reduction .",
    "the only bias affecting the sub - sample used here is the tendency to observe the brightest galaxies in the r filter ( see figure [ compl ] ) .",
    "there is no intended bias related to morphological type in the observing procedure .",
    "the full ess spectroscopic sample is defined by only one criterion : r@xmath20 ( r@xmath21 is an estimate of aperture magnitudes in the r cousins filter , using the kron estimator [ arnouts 1996 ] ) .",

    "in this paper we show that we can classify the galaxies of the eso - sculptor survey ( ess ) from their flux calibrated spectra using the principal component analysis ( pca ) technique .",
    "the pca allows to define a _ continuous _",
    "spectral sequence highly correlated with the hubble morphological type .",
    "this sequence can be written as a linear combination of a reduced set of parameters and vectors ( 3 ) which account for @xmath6 98% of the total flux of each spectrum .",
    "the parameters are also sensitive to the strength of emission lines .",
    "our main results can be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "using kennicutt spectra for galaxies of known hubble types , we establish the strong correlation between the spectral galaxy type and the underlying old ( red ) and young ( blue ) stellar population within the galaxy .",
    "these populations can be quantitatively separated in the pca approach using a sequence which arises mainly from the changes in the shape of the continuum and the relative strength of the absorption features .",
    "2 .   by application to the ess data ,",
    "we show that the pca is a flexible and powerful tool to classify galaxies using the spectral information .",
    "galaxies can be classified using one continuous parameter ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "we also find that the presence and strength of the emission lines are correlated with the spectral type ( late galaxies tend to have strong emission lines ) , and can be quantified by a second continuous parameter ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "the continuous nature of the classifying parameters @xmath33 and @xmath34 provides a powerful tool for an objective study of the systematic and non - systematic properties ( _ i.e. , _ peculiar objects ) of spectral data .",
    "moreover , it allows us to use one ( or two ) fundamental parameter(s ) to construct an analytical relation between the classification parameter(s ) and other quantitative properties of the galaxies ( for example k - corrections , local galaxy density , etc ... ) .",
    "we illustrate using the ess data how the pca acts as a powerful filter of noisy spectra , inherent to deep redshift surveys .",
    "reconstruction of the ess spectra with 3 principal components increases the s / n from the range 8 - 20 to the range 35 - 80 .",
    "the spectral sequence given by the pca is not uniformly populated : the early types are more concentrated in the classification plane than the late types .",
    "this non - uniform distribution of the different _ spectral _ types is closely related to the fact that systematic differences between two consecutive _ morphological _ types are larger among spiral galaxies than among elliptical or lenticular galaxies .",
    "this leads to construct a variable binning when comparing the observed spectral sequence with morphological classifications from other surveys .",
    "5 .   when making the analogy between spectral type and morphology via the kennicutt spectra , we find that the ess sample contains 26@xmath357% of e / s0 , 71@xmath359% of sa / sb / sc and 3@xmath357% of extreme late spirals ( sm / im ) .",
    "the type fractions for the ess show no significant changes in the redshift interval @xmath1 , and are comparable to those found in other galaxy surveys at intermediate redshift . for the @xmath36 galaxies in the ess analyzed here , the dominant type is sb , followed by sc , sa , and early types .",
    "we do not detect any strong evolution in the ess data as a function of redshift , up to the depth of the ess spectroscopic catalogue ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "other surveys have detected only a marginal evolution at @xmath38 , like the cfrs ( @xcite ) and the autofib survey ( @xcite ) , and significant evolution appears to occur at @xmath39 . in the ess sample ,",
    "we note a significant excess of early types at @xmath40 .",
    "the nature of this excess will be further investigated in a future paper using the complete redshift sample .",
    "application of the pca method to the ess shows that it may be applied to any set of flux - calibrated spectra , and that it is a promising technique for on - going and future massive galaxy surveys .",
    "the major interest of the pca technique is that the spectral trends followed by the sample used are independent from any set of templates ( the classification space is continuously populated ) .",
    "the pca technique therefore offers clear advantages over other discrete methods like the @xmath2 ( see @xcite ) or the cross - correlation method ( see @xcite ) , which are fully dependent on the set of templates used : in these approaches , it is difficult to discriminate differences in the results from differences in the input templates . also , such classification procedures are sensitive to fluctuations due to the noise of each target spectrum , an undesirable phenomenon .",
    "in contrast , the pca offers an unsupervised classification system ( @xcite ) , in which one does not make any assumption on the general trends followed by the sample .",
    "moreover , the pca classification shows that the spectral sequence is essentially determined by the variations in the shape of the continuum . any spectral classification method dependent only on the strength of the absorption lines",
    "( @xcite , @xcite ) is therefore very sensitive to instrumental effects and/or physical phenomena not necessarily correlated with spectral type , and must be interpreted with caution .",
    "the spectral classification for the ess sample will be used to derive precise k - corrections , which are fundamental for deriving absolute magnitudes .",
    "those in turn will allow to calculate the luminosity functions as a function of spectral type ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . with the specific galaxy luminosity function",
    ", we can investigate in detail the morphology - density relation in the field ( see @xcite ) and more generally the variations in galaxy properties with local environment and location within the large - scale structure .",
    "these various analyses will be reported in subsequent papers .",
