    "non - minimal coupling ( nmc ) of scalar field with gravity is necessary in many situations of physical and cosmological interest .",
    "there are several compelling reasons to include an explicit non - minimal coupling in the action ( see for example [ 1,2,3,4 ] and references therein ) .",
    "nmc arises at the quantum level when quantum corrections to the scalar field theory are considered .",
    "it is necessary also for the renormalizability of the scalar field theory in curved space . in most theories used to describe inflationary scenarios ,",
    "it turns out that a non - vanishing value of the coupling constant is unavoidable [ 2 ] . in general relativity , and in all other metric theories of gravity ( in which the scalar field is not part of the gravitational sector ) , the coupling constant necessarily assumes a non - vanishing value[5 ] .",
    "the study of the asymptotically free theories in an external gravitational field with a gauss - bonnet term shows a scale dependent coupling parameter .",
    "for instance , asymptotically free grand unified theories have a non - minimal coupling depending on a renormalization group parameter that converges to the value of @xmath0 or to any other initial conditions depending on the gauge group and on the matter content of the theory[6 ] . in view of the above results and several other motivations",
    "( see for example [ 7,8 ] and references therein ) , it is then natural to incorporate an explicit nmc between scalar field and ricci scalar in the inflationary paradigm .",
    "generally , with non - minimally coupled scalar field it is harder to achieve accelerated expansion of the universe[2,7 ] .",
    "part of this difficulty is related to the more sophisticated machinery of fine tuning . nevertheless , over the last decade several non - minimal inflation scenario",
    "have been proposed to find reliable framework for issues such as graceful exit of inflationary phase and the observational constraints on the values that non - minimal coupling can attain in order to have successful inflationary scenario are discussed [ 8 - 16 ] .",
    "the recent astronomical observations , specially high precision data of wmap3 [ 17 ] have opened new doors in the field of observational cosmology . as a result , these data have significant impact on the inflation paradigm . in this regard",
    ", these high precision data will give more accurate bounds on the values of non - minimal coupling in a typical non - minimal inflation model .",
    "the purpose of this letter is to study impact of wmap3 and non - minimal inflation .",
    "considering some well - known inflationary potentials , we explore new observational constraints on the values of non - minimal coupling to have successful non - minimal inflation . by definition of an effective scalar field potential ,",
    "we show that there is a region in parameter space that inflation is driven by the non - minimal coupling term .",
    "a detailed study of spectral index and its running shows the spontaneous exit of inflationary phase ( without any mechanism ) in a suitable region of the parameter space .",
    "we also compare our results with the results of previous studies .",
    "this comparison reveals the present status of non - minimal inflation paradigm after wmap3 .",
    "to construct a specific non - minimal inflation scenario , we start with the following action in jordan frame @xmath1 \\label{1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is newton s gravitational constant , and @xmath3 is a coupling constant .",
    "the metric signature convention is chosen to be @xmath4 with spatially flat robertson - walker metric as follows @xmath5 to obtain the fundamental background equations in einstein frame , we perform the following conformal transformation to the einstein frame @xmath6 here we use a hat on a variable defined in the einstein frame .",
    "the conformal transformation gives @xmath7 , \\label{4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where by definition @xmath8 and @xmath9 therefore , one may redefine the scalar field as follows @xmath10 when we investigate the dynamics of universe in the einstein frame , we should transform our coordinates system to make the metric in the robertson - walker form @xmath11 and we obtain @xmath12 note that the physical quantities in einstein frame should be defined in this coordinate system . now",
    "the einstein equations can be written as follows @xmath13 \\label{10},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath14 using the slow - roll approximations @xmath15 and @xmath16 , we obtain from @xmath17 and @xmath18 the following dynamical equations @xmath19 @xmath20    in which follows we will concentrate on two well - known inflationary potentials : models with inflation potential of the form @xmath21 and models with an exponential potential @xmath22 . with these potentials ,",
    "we obtain @xmath23 @xmath24 respectively .",
    "figure 1 shows the behavior of effective potentials as defined by relation ( 6 ) .",
    "for @xmath21 it is possible to achieve inflationary phase with appropriate @xmath3 . for @xmath22",
    "however , when @xmath3 is negative , since the effective potential is flat in region of @xmath25 compared with the @xmath26 case , we can expect assisted inflation to occur in this region .",
    "when @xmath3 is positive , inflation can be realized in the region of @xmath27 . for a detailed study of these issues for power - law inflation see",
    "+ note that we have used a well - know conformal transformation to express the action in the einstein frame . in this frame ,",
    "the gravitational sector is expressed in terms of a re - scaled scalar field which is minimally coupled and evolves in a re - scaled potential , thereby simplifying the formalism .",
    "however , one has to keep in mind that the matter sector is strongly affected by such a conformal transformation since all of the matter fields are now non - minimally coupled to the re - scaled metric : in particular , stress tensor conservation in the matter sector is no longer ensured [ 19,20 ] . on the other hand , as makino and sasaki [ 21 ] and fakir , habib and unruh [ 22 ] have proved , the amplitude of scalar perturbation in the jordan frame exactly coincides with that in the einstein frame .",
    "this proof ( with a complete details in [ 23 ] ) allows us to calculate the scalar power spectrum in the jordan and einstein frame . as a result ,",
    "the scalar power spectrum has not dependence on the choice of frames , that is , it is conformally invariant .",
    "so , our results can be compared to observations directly without any ambiguities[23 ] .",
    "this is an important point since one has to check validity of non - gravity experiments in einstein frame .",
    "for instance , validity of electro - magnetic related experiments such as cmb experiment should be checked in einstein frame . as komatsu and futamase have shown , the scalar power spectrum is independent on the choice of frames .",
    "now we study the effect of non - minimal coupling of scalar field and curvature on the spectral index of density perturbations .      in this section",
    "we calculate the spectral index of density perturbations in our non - minimal framework . as komatsu and futamase",
    "have shown , in the first order approximation in slow - roll parameters , @xmath28 is invariant under the conformal transformation [ 23 ] .",
    "we use the following definitions of slow - roll parameters versus @xmath29 as defined by liddle @xmath30[24 ] ( see also [ 25 - 27 ] ) : @xmath31 and @xmath32 where a prime denotes @xmath33 .",
    "these parameters can be related directly to observable @xmath34[24 - 27 ] . of course",
    ", to the second order of slow - roll parameters , the spectral index will attain different form[25 ] .",
    "now we use equation @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 to determine @xmath38 . since , @xmath39 , we find    @xmath40 ^ 2 } { [ 1+\\kappa^2\\xi\\phi^2(1 + 6\\xi ) ] } , \\label{18}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath41 @xmath42\\ ] ] @xmath43 @xmath44 for@xmath45 . for potential @xmath46",
    "we derive @xmath47 @xmath48 @xmath49 @xmath50\\bigg ) .",
    "\\label{21}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the inflationary phase terminates if the condition @xmath51 be satisfied[24 ] . for exponential inflationary potential as described above , slow - roll equations can not be solved in algebraic way , so we try to solve them numerically . in the case of the large field models",
    "@xmath52 , these equations can be solved analytically , however the result of numerical calculation can be interpreted more easily . figures 2",
    "shows the results of these calculations for potential @xmath21 for both positive and negative scalar field @xmath53 .",
    "we see that with positive @xmath3 , both positive and negative @xmath53 can lead to spontaneous exit of inflationary phase without any additional mechanism . for negative @xmath3 however , as figure 3 shows ,",
    "the situation is very different . with @xmath54 and negative @xmath53",
    "as figure 3 ( left ) shows , inflationary phase can exit only for @xmath55 . for",
    "@xmath55 inflationary phase can exit spontaneously without any mechanism .",
    "for all @xmath56 we find a negative @xmath57 which is evidently impossible since @xmath57 is a positive definite quantity .",
    "on the other hand , with positive @xmath53 and negative @xmath3 as figure 3 ( right ) shows , inflationary phase can exit spontaneously only for @xmath58 . for @xmath22 , figures 4 and 5 show that inflationary phase can exit spontaneously with all possible values of @xmath3 regardless of @xmath53 sign .",
    "so , non - minimal coupling provides a successful machinery for spontaneous exit of inflationary phase .",
    "the number of e - folds , @xmath59 can be written as @xmath60 where @xmath61 denotes the value of scalar field @xmath62 when universe scale observed today crosses the hubble horizon during inflation , while @xmath63 is the value of scalar field when the universe exits the inflationary phase . the number of e - folds can be obtained using equations @xmath36 and @xmath17 .",
    "now we set @xmath64 and for simplicity we choose @xmath65 in @xmath21 .",
    "writing @xmath66 in relation ( 18 ) , we can solve equation @xmath51 for @xmath67 to find @xmath68 if we similarly write @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the value of @xmath53 when the scales of interest crossed outside of horizon during inflation , then we can rewrite relations @xmath71 and @xmath72 using the fact that scales of interest to us crossed outside of horizon is approximately @xmath73 e - folds before the end of inflation , that is , @xmath74 . the first - order result , @xmath75 ,",
    "can be written approximately , in the limit of @xmath76 , as follows @xmath77 the running of the spectral index is therefore @xmath78 where @xmath79 .",
    "this quantity could be larger and match observation if we adopt a larger value of the coupling constant @xmath80 ( for example @xmath81 if @xmath82 .",
    "figure 6 shows the result of this calculation .",
    "as we see , both of these figures show that @xmath83 and therefore our model favors a red and nearly scale invariant spectrum .",
    "we can similarly calculate @xmath28 and the running of the spectral index for exponential potential .",
    "the results are as follows @xmath84 where @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "the running of the spectral index is @xmath87 for example @xmath88 if @xmath89 . in this case",
    "we can not consider @xmath90 , since with @xmath90 relation @xmath91 for spectral index becomes a complex quantity .",
    "figure ( 7 ) shows the variation of spectral index for exponential potential .",
    "we see that in this case we have always @xmath83 .",
    "therefore , our model for exponential potential gives also a nearly scale invariant spectrum .",
    "to study cosmological implications of this non - minimal inflation model , we perform some numerical analysis of parameter space .",
    "the result of wmap3 for @xmath92cdm gives @xmath93 for index of the power spectrum[17 ] .",
    "combining wmap3 with sdss ( sloan digital sky survey ) , gives @xmath94 at the level of one standard deviation[12 ] .",
    "these results show that a red power spectrum is favored at least at the level of two standard deviations .",
    "if there is running of the spectral index , the constraints on the spectral index and its running are given by [ 12 ] @xmath95 and @xmath96 table 1 summarizes the results of our calculations for spectral index for two different kind of scalar field potential .",
    "this table contains also the constraints imposed on the non - minimal coupling in comparison with wmap3 data . choosing some limiting values of @xmath97",
    ", we obtain a suitable range of non - minimal coupling . in this table , @xmath86 is the value of the scalar field when the inflationary phase terminates .",
    "therefore , to have assisted inflation with non - minimal coupling , we should restrict ourselves to the conditions @xmath55 and @xmath98 for @xmath99 and @xmath100 for exponential potential .",
    "since the values that @xmath101 can attains in our non - minimal framework are less than unity , our model shows a red power spectrum in accordance with wmap3 . on the other hand ,",
    "our model shows a nearly scale invariant spectrum .",
