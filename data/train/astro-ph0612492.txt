    "the question we want to address in this paper is the following _ inverse problem _ :",
    "having a complete set of data describing a compact body immersed in a spherically symmetric accreting fluid , find the mass of the central body .",
    "we assume that we know the total mass , luminosity , asymptotic temperature , the equation of state of the accreting gas and the gravitational potential at the surface of the core .",
    "the fundamental question is whether observers can distinguish between gravastars  @xcite versus black holes as engines of luminous accreting systems ( see a controversy in  @xcite ) .",
    "while we do not address this problem here , we show a related ambiguity in a simple newtonian model .",
    "the first investigation of stationary accretion of spherically symmetric fluids , including luminosity close to the eddington limit , was provided by shakura  @xcite .",
    "it was later extended to models including the gas pressure , its selfgravity and relativistic effects  @xcite .    in the following",
    "we will denote the areal velocity by  @xmath0 ( where  @xmath1 is comoving time and @xmath2 the areal radius ) , the local , eddington and total luminosities by  @xmath3 , @xmath4 and  @xmath5 , quasilocal mass by  @xmath6 and total by  @xmath7 , pressure by  @xmath8 , the baryonic mass density by  @xmath9 ( the polytropic equation of state will be @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) and the gravitational potential by  @xmath12 . the radius of the central body is  @xmath13 while its `` modified radius '' is defined by @xmath14 . under the assumption that at the outer boundary of the fluid the following holds true : @xmath15 we have the following set of equations : @xmath16 @xmath17 @xmath18 @xmath19 @xmath20 is a dimensional constant @xmath21 .",
    "the details of solving the system are provided elsewhere  @xcite and we will present only the main results here .",
    "we assume that the accretion is critical , _",
    "i.e. _ , there exists a sonic point , where the speed of accreting gas  @xmath22 is equal to the speed of sound  @xmath23 .",
    "all values measured at that point will be denoted with an asterisk .",
    "we define : @xmath24 and obtain the total luminosity : @xmath25 ^ 2}{\\left ( \\frac{2}{5 - 3\\gamma}\\right )     ^{(5 - 3\\gamma)/2(\\gamma-1)}}. \\label{roszkowski : luminosity}\\ ] ] @xmath26 is approximately the inverse of the volume of the gas located outside the sonic point . in sake of brevity",
    "we will use @xmath27 to obtain in a form using the relative luminosity : @xmath28 ^ 2}. \\label{roszkowski : relative}\\ ] ]",
    "for the relative luminosity , fulfilling   we proved the following theorem :    for the functional @xmath29 ^ 2}$ ] there exists a critical point @xmath30 , @xmath31 such that @xmath32 and @xmath33 with @xmath34 and @xmath35 , @xmath36/3 $ ] .    for any @xmath37 there",
    "exist two solutions @xmath38 bifurcating from @xmath39 .",
    "they are locally approximated by : @xmath40}{\\beta[b - a\\exp(-a\\gamma)][1-a\\exp(-a\\gamma ) ] } \\right)^{1/2 } .\\ ] ]    the relative luminosity  @xmath41 is extremized at the critical point  @xmath39 .",
    "in the paper we have assumed the existence of an accreting system which satisfies certain conditions . under those assumptions",
    "the complicated set of integro - differential nonlinear equations  ( [ roszkowski : eq1][roszkowski : eq4 ] ) can be simplified to an algebraic one  ( [ roszkowski : relative ] ) .",
    "we checked numerically that the performed simplification causes errors of the order of @xmath42 ( see  @xcite for details ) .",
    "the analysis of shows that there exist two different solutions , having the same total luminosity and total mass , but different masses of the core objects .",
    "one can also conclude that for sufficiently large  @xmath43 the maximal relative luminosity  @xmath23 can get close to  @xmath44 , _ i.e. _ , the total luminosity approaches the eddington limit .",
    "as the two solution branches bifurcate from the point @xmath45 , there is no much difference between the central masses of bright objects ( see  @xcite for plots ) .",
    "however , when luminosity is small ( @xmath46 ) , this difference can become arbitrarily large .",
    "this can be understood intuitively , because the radiation is small for test fluids ( since the layer of gas is thin ) , or when the central object is light ( therefore weakly attracting surrounding gas ) .",
    "the results obtained here are consistent with relativistic analysis neglecting interaction between the gas and the radiation  @xcite .",
