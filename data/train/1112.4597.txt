    "recent years have witnessed a fast development of complex networks @xcite .",
    "a network is a set of items that are called vertices with connections between them , which are named as edges .",
    "many natural and man - made systems can be described as networks .",
    "such paragons can not be numbered that biological networks including protein - protein interaction networks @xcite and metabolic network @xcite ; social networks such as movie actor collaboration @xcite and scientific collaboration networks @xcite ; technological networks like power grids @xcite , www @xcite and the internet at the autonomous system ( as ) level @xcite .",
    "a major endeavor in academics is to discover the common properties shared by many real networks and the specific features owned by a certain type of networks .",
    "a great number of measurements to reveal the structural features of networks are applied @xcite .",
    "the degree distribution @xcite , as one of the most important global measurements , has attracted increasing attention since the awareness of the scale - freeness @xcite .",
    "clustering coefficient is a local measurement that characterizes the loop structure of order three .",
    "another significant measurement is the average distance .",
    "a network is considered to be small - world if it has large clustering coefficient but short average distance @xcite . except for the properties mentioned above ,",
    "there are many other measurements such as degree - degree correlation @xcite , betweenness centrality @xcite and so forth .",
    "moreover , some statistical measurements borrowed from physics such as entropy @xcite , and novel metrics such as modularity @xcite also play important roles in characterizing networks .    not only the statistical features but also the dynamical evolution of networks the current research interest has focused on . a mess of models have been proposed to reveal the origins of the impressive statistical features of complex networks .",
    "there are also many evolving models developed for some certain type of networks such as the internet at the as level @xcite , the social networks @xcite and so forth .",
    "however the prosperous development of measurements sets a barrier for evaluating different evolving models .",
    "the traditional idea is that : if the network generated by a model resembles the target network in terms of some statistical features usually selected by the authors themselves , the model is claimed as a proper description of the real evolution . but",
    "this methodology seems to be puzzling .",
    "first , unselected statistical properties are entirely ignored so no one knows whether the model is sufficient to describe them as well .",
    "secondly , the authors tend to select the metrics that support their models .",
    "therefore , it is impossible to give a fair remark that which model is better .",
    "thirdly , it is difficult to quantify the extent to which the models resemble the real evolving mechanisms .    inspired by the link prediction approaches and likelihood analysis ,",
    "we propose a method that tries to fairly and objectively evaluate different models .",
    "link prediction aims at estimating the likelihood of non - existing edges in a network and try to dig out the missing edges @xcite .",
    "the evolution of networks involves two processes - one is the addition or deletion of nodes and another one is the changing of edges between nodes @xcite . in principle the rules of the additions of edges of a model can be considered as a kind of link prediction algorithm and here lies the bridge between link prediction and the mechanism of evolving models .    the present paper is organized as follows",
    ". we will give a general description of our method in section ii .",
    "section iii introduces the data and explains how to use our method to evaluate evolving models in details with the as - level internet being an example network .",
    "the results obtained by our method are shown in section iv .",
    "we draw the conclusion and give some discussion in the last section .",
    "in this section , we will give a general description about our method to evaluate evolving models .",
    "it is believed that an evolving model is a description of the evolving process of a network in reality .",
    "an evolving model describes the evolving mechanism of a real network or a class of networks . given two snaps of one network at time @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) , as well as an evolving model , we can in principle calculate the likelihood that the network starting from the configuration at time @xmath0 will evolves to the configuration at @xmath1 under the rules of the given model .",
    "we say a model is _",
    "better _ than another one if the likelihood of the former model is greater than that of the latter one",
    ". however , how to calculate such likelihood is still a big challenge .",
    "inspired by the like prediction algorithms , we can calculate the likelihood of the addition of an edge according to a given evolving model @xcite . in a short duration of time",
    ", each edge s generation can be thought as independent to others and the sequence of generations can be ignored .",
    "thus the likelihood mentioned above is the product of the newly generated edges likelihoods .",
    "denote by @xmath3 the network and @xmath4 the set of edges at time step @xmath5 .",
    "the new edges generated at the current time step is @xmath6 .",
    "the probability that node @xmath7 is selected as one end of the newly generated edge is @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the set of parameters applied by the model .",
    "then the likelihood of a new monitored edge @xmath10 is @xmath11 eq .",
    "( [ eq : b ] ) is applicable only when @xmath7 and @xmath12 are both old nodes .",
    "if @xmath7 or @xmath12 is newly generated , we set @xmath13 or @xmath14 . in order to make comparison between different models",
    ", @xmath15 is normalized by @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the set of nonexisting edges(@xmath18 ) . given different parameters @xmath19 , the values of @xmath15 may be different , resulting in different likelihoods of the target network .",
    "the parameters corresponding to the maximum likelihood are intuitively considered to be the optimal set of parameters for the evaluated model . in a word ,",
    "a network s likelihood can be calculated if the evolution data and the corresponding model are given . and",
    "if there are several candidate models , our method could judge them by comparing the corresponding likelihoods : the model giving higher likelihood according to the target network is more favored .",

    "[ fig : figure1 ]",
    "captypefigure    in this paper we focus on the models of the as - level internet . two popular models - generalized linear preferential model ( glp ) @xcite and tel",
    "aviv network generator ( tang ) @xcite - will be evaluated by our method .",
    "the well - known barabsi - albert ( ba ) @xcite and erds - rnyi ( er ) @xcite models are also analyzed as two benchmarks .",
    "the data sets we utilize here are collected by the _ routeviews project _",
    "we use the data of jun .",
    "2006 and dec . 2006 . some nodes and edges in jun .",
    "2006 disappear in the record of dec .",
    "2006 . although an autonomous system might be canceled , rarely does it happen during a short time span .",
    "therefore we assume that the nodes and edges in jun .",
    "2006 will not disappear in dec .",
    "2006 . that is to say that the network configuration in jun .",
    "2006 is a subgraph of that in dec . 2006 .",
    "we merge the network of jun .",
    "2006 into that of dec .",
    "2006 to make a set substraction between the two sets to obtain the newly generated edges and nodes . the basic information of the processed data set of dec .",
    "2006 and two original data sets is shown in table [ tab : table1 ] .",
    "captypetable    c | c | c time & # nodes & # edges + 2006.06 & 22960 & 49545 + 2006.12 & 24403 & 52826 + 2006.12 ( processed ) & 25103 & 59268 +    [ tab : table1 ]    now we will describe how to calculate the likelihood of each newly - generated edge in terms of the four models .",
    "( i ) * glp model * - this model starts from a few nodes . at each time step , with the probability @xmath20 , one new node is added and @xmath21 edges are generated between the new node and @xmath21 old ones and with the probability @xmath22 , @xmath21 edges are generated among the existing nodes .",
    "the ends of new edges are selected following the rule of generalized linear preferential attachment as @xmath23 in which @xmath24 . in our method",
    "if the end @xmath7 of a new edge is selected among the existing nodes , then @xmath25 is calculated by the eq .",
    "( [ eq : c ] ) .",
    "otherwise , if the end @xmath7 itself is a new node , @xmath25 is @xmath26 .",
    "so the likelihood of a new edge connecting two existing nodes @xmath27 and @xmath28 is @xmath29 the likelihood of an edge generated between a new node @xmath28 and an existing node @xmath27 is @xmath30 when a new edge connects two new nodes @xmath27 and @xmath28 , its likelihood is @xmath31 ( ii ) * tang model * - this model applies a super linear preferential mechanism , say @xmath32 this model also starts with a few nodes and at each time step a new node is generated with one edge connecting to one of the existing nodes that is selected with the probability described in eq .",
    "( [ eq : g ] ) .",
    "the remaining @xmath33 edges are added between the existing nodes . for these @xmath33 nodes ,",
    "one end is selected according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : g ] ) , while the other one is selected randomly .",
    "hence the likelihood of a new edge between existing nodes is @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the current size of the monitored network .",
    "( [ eq : h ] ) takes a geometric mean due to the fact that either @xmath27 or @xmath28 could be the one selected randomly .",
    "the cases involving new nodes are managed in the same way as that for the glp model .",
    "( iii ) * ba model * - the ba model also starts from a small graph and at each time step a new node associated with @xmath21 edges is added .",
    "the probability that the existing node @xmath7 is selected is @xmath36 note that the original ba model can not deal with the situation where edges are generated between two existing nodes .",
    "we thus generalize the ba model as if one edge is generated between two existing nodes , one node is selected preferentially following the eq .",
    "( [ eq : i ] ) and another one is selected randomly .",
    "therefore the likelihood of an edge between two existing nodes @xmath27 and @xmath28 is calculated as @xmath37 the likelihood of an edge connecting a new node @xmath28 and an old one @xmath27 is @xmath38 the likelihood of a new edge generated between two new nodes is @xmath26 as discussed above .",
    "( iv ) * er model * - the mechanism of this model is that when one edge is generated , both its ends are selected in a random fashion .",
    "the likelihood of one edge @xmath39 between two old nodes is @xmath40 the calculation of other two types of edges is similar to that of glp .",
    "note that ba is a special case equivalent to the glp model when @xmath41 .",
    "it is also obvious that the er model is a special case of the tang model when @xmath42 .",
    "captypetable    c|c|c model & maximum likelihood & optimum parameters + glp & @xmath43 & @xmath44 + tang & @xmath45 & @xmath46 + er & @xmath47 & n / a + ba & @xmath48 & n / a +    [ tab : table2 ]    the likelihoods of the four evolving models with different parameters are shown in figure [ fig : figure1 ] .",
    "the maximum likelihoods as well as the corresponding parameters are listed in table [ tab : table2 ] .",
    "the maximum likelihoods of both specific internet models ( glp and tang ) are greater than those of the ba model and the er model .",
    "notice that the ba and er model are parameter - free and thus represented by two straight lines in figure [ fig : figure1 ] .",
    "our results suggest that subject to the mimicking of the as - level internet evolution , the glp model is better than the tang model , and the tang model is better than the ba model , of course , the er model performs the worst .",
    "a puzzling point is that the optimal parameters corresponding to the maximum likelihoods are far from the ones suggested in the original literature @xcite .",
    "we next devise an experiment to demonstrate that the parameters obtained by our method are more advantageous than the original ones .",
    "traditionally , an evolving model starts from a small network with a few nodes . in this experiment ,",
    "we respectively use the glp and tang models to drive the network evolution starting from the configuration of jun .",
    "2006 , ending with the same size of the configuration of dec . 2006 .",
    "according to the refs . @xcite and the data , @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "then we analyze some statistical features of the newly generated part including the average degree , the density of interaction and the fraction of leaves .",
    "we find that the performance of the glp model is better than the tang model with the same kind of parameters in the three cases , demonstrating that our evaluating method is reasonable .",
    "for both the two models , the statistical features obtained by the optimum parameters suggested by us resemble the real data better than those obtained by using the original parameters .",
    "the comparisons are shown in figure [ fig : figure2 ] .",
    "thousands of network models are put forward in recent ten years . some of them aim at uncovering mechanisms that underlie general topological properties like scale - free nature and small - world phenomenon , others are proposed to reproduce structural features of specific networks , such as the internet , the world wide web , co - authorship networks , food webs , protein - protein interacting networks , metabolic networks , and so on . besides the prosperity , we are worrying that there is no unified method to evaluate the performance of different models , even if the target network is given beforehand .",
    "instead of considering many structural metrics , this paper reports an evaluating method based on likelihood analysis , with an assumption that a better model will assign a higher likelihood to the observed structure .",
    "we have tested our method on the real internet at the as level , and the results suggest that the glp model outperforms the tang model , and both models are better than the ba and er models .",
    "this method can be further applied in determining the optimal parameters of network models , and the experiment indicates that the parameters obtained by our method can better capture the structural characters of newly - added nodes and links .",
    "the main contributions of this work are twofold . in the methodology aspect",
    ", we provide a starting point towards a unified way to evaluate network models . in the perspective aspect , we believe for majority of real evolutionary networks , the driven factors and the parameters will vary in time . for example , recent empirical analysis suggests that before and after the year 2004 , the internet at the as level grows with different mechanisms @xcite . to find out a single mechanisms that drives a network from a little baby to a giant may be an infeasible task .",
    "in fact , in different stages , a network could grow in different ways , or in a hybrid matter with changing weight distribution on several mechanisms .",
    "once , the research focus has shifted from analyzing static models to evolutionary models . in the near future , it may shift from the evolutionary models to the evolving of the evolutionary models themselves . in principle , the current method could capture the tracks of not only the network evolution , but also the mechanism evolution . hopefully this work could provide some insights into the studies on network modeling .",
    "we acknowledge a. wool for the codes of the tang model .",
