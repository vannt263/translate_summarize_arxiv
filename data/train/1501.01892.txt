    "since orders of the large trader have an adverse impact on the prices at which they are executed , she needs to balance the incurred liquidity costs against her preference to complete a trade early .",
    "optimal trade execution problems have been studied by many authors .",
    "we mention @xcite and refer to @xcite for application background and further references . posing",
    "the problem in continuous time leads to a singular stochastic control problem of finite fuel type .",
    "we note that our control objective , see  , involves control cost terms like in @xcite , depending explicitly on the state process @xmath0 with a summation of integrals for each jump in the control strategy @xmath1 .",
    "we refer to these articles for more background on singular stochastic control . the articles @xcite show equivalence of general singular control problems to infinite dimensional ( dual ) linear programs , equivalence to problems with optimal stopping and general results on existence for optimal singular controls .",
    "explicit descriptions of optimal singular stochastic controls can be obtained only for special problems , see e.g.  @xcite , but these examples differ from the one considered here in several aspects .    in this paper",
    "we investigate a multiplicative limit order book model , which is closely related to the additive limit order book models of @xcite , a key difference being that the price impact of orders is multiplicative instead of additive . in absence of large trader activity",
    ", the risky asset price follows some unaffected non - negative price evolution @xmath2 , for instance geometric brownian motion .",
    "the trading strategy @xmath3 of the large trader has a multiplicative impact on the actual asset price which is evolving as @xmath4 , @xmath5 , for a process @xmath6 that describes the level of market impact .",
    "this process is defined by a mean - reverting differential equation @xmath7 , which is driven by the amount @xmath8 of risky assets held , and can be interpreted as a volume effect process like in @xcite , see [ sect : lob ] .",
    "subject to suitable properties for the functions @xmath9 ( see assumption  [ cond : model parameters ] ) , asset sales ( buys ) are depressing ( increasing ) the level of market impact @xmath10 and thereby the actual price @xmath11 in a transient way , with some finite rate of resilience . for @xmath12 being positive , multiplicative price impact ensures that risky asset prices @xmath11 are positive , like in the continuous - time variant ( * ? ? ?",
    "3.2 ) of the model in @xcite , whereas negative prices can occur in additive impact models .",
    "we admit for general non - linear impact functions @xmath12 , corresponding to general density shapes of a multiplicative limit order book whose shapes are specified with respect to relative price perturbations @xmath13 , and depth of the order book could be infinite or finite , cf .",
    "[ sect : lob ] .",
    "the rate of resilience @xmath14 may be non - constant and ( unaffected ) transient recovery of @xmath10 could be non - exponential , while the problem still remains markovian in @xmath0 through @xmath6 , like in @xcite but differently to @xcite .",
    "following @xcite , we admit for general ( monotone ) bounded variation strategies in continuous time , while @xcite consider trading at discrete times .",
    "most of the related literature @xcite on transient additive price impact assumes that the unaffected ( discounted ) price dynamics exhibit no drift , and such a martingale property allows for different arguments in the analysis . without drift , a convexity argument as in @xcite can be applied readily also for multiplicative impact to identify the optimal control in the finite horizon problem with a free boundary that is constant in one coordinate , see [ rmk : finite time horizon ; no drift ; convexity ] .",

    "the interesting articles @xcite also solve optimal trade execution problems in a model with multiplicative instead of additive price impact , but models and results differ in key aspects .",
    "the article @xcite considers permanent price impact , non - zero bid - ask spread ( proportional transaction costs ) and a particular exponential parametrization for price impact from block trades , whereas we study transient price impact , general impact functions @xmath12 , and zero spread ( in section  [ sect : intermediate buy orders ] ) .",
    "numerical solutions of the hamilton - jacobi - bellman equation derived by heuristic arguments are investigated in @xcite for a different optimal execution problem on finite horizon in a black - scholes model with permanent multiplicative impact .",
    "the authors of @xcite obtain viscosity solutions and their nonlinear transient price impact is a functional of the present order size and the time lag from ( only ) the last trade , whereas we consider impact which depends via @xmath6 on the times and sizes of all past orders , as in @xcite .",
    "we construct explicit solutions for the optimal control which maximizes the expected discounted liquidation proceeds over an infinite time horizon , in a model with multiplicative price impact and drift that is introduced in [ sect : model ] .",
    "we use dynamical programming and apply smooth pasting and calculus of variations methods to construct in [ sec : free boundary problem ] a candidate solution for the variational inequalities arising from the control problem . after having the candidate value function and free boundary curve that determines the optimal control ,",
    "we prove optimality by verifying the variational inequalities ( in [ appendix : proofs about value functions ] ) such that an optimality principle ( see [ prop : supermatringale suffices ] ) can be applied .",
    "we obtain explicit solutions for two variants of the optimal liquidation problem . in the first variant ( i ) ,",
    "whose solution is presented in [ sec : problem ] , the large trader is only admitted to sell but not to buy , whereas for the second variant ( ii ) in [ sect : intermediate buy orders ] intermediate buying is admitted , even though the trader ultimately wants to liquidate her position .",
    "variant i may be of interest , if a bank selling a large position on behalf of a client is required by regulation to execute only sell orders .",
    "the second variant might fit for an investor trading for herself and is mathematically needed to explore , whether a multiplicative limit order book model admits profitable round trips or transaction triggered price manipulations , as studied by @xcite for additive impact , see [ rem : round - trips - in - depressed - market , ex : lorenz - schied ] .",
    "notably , the free boundaries coincide for both variants , and the time to complete liquidation is finite , varies continuously with the discounting parameter ( i.e.  the investor s impatience ) and tends to zero for increasing impatience in suitable parametrizations , see  [ ex : simple - lob , fig : ttl - over - y0-different - delta ] . in [ ex : lorenz - schied ] we compare how additive and multiplicative limit order books give rise to rather different qualitative properties of optimal controls under standard black - scholes dynamics for unaffected risky asset prices , indicating that multiplicative impact fits better to models with multiplicative evolution of asset prices .",

    "we do also assume @xmath1 to be increasing ; but this will be generalized later in [ sect : intermediate buy orders ] to non - monotone strategies of bounded variation .",

    "that means , if the large trader is selling risky assets according to a continuous strategy @xmath69 , then respective ( self - financing ) variations of her numeraire ( cash ) account are given by the proceeds ( negative costs ) @xmath70 over any period @xmath71 $ ] . to permit also for non - continuous trading involving block trades , the proceeds from a market sell order of size @xmath72 at time @xmath51 ,",
