    "low - energy supersymmetry ( mssm )  @xcite is a key ingredient in the best - qualified candidate models to supersede the standard model ( sm ) at energies beyond the tev range .",
    "the mssm is supported both by theoretical arguments and experimental indirect hints . from the theoretical point of view supersymmetry",
    "achieves cancellation of ultraviolet quadratic divergences which is welcome to alleviate the hierarchy problem . from the experimental side , using lep electroweak precision data , the mssm achieves gauge coupling unification at a value and scale given by @xmath3 on the other hand , the extensive experimental search of the ( super)-partners of sm elementary particles predicted by supersymmetry ( susy ) has been unsuccessful so far , challenging  @xcite , with the rise of experimental mass limits , the naturalness and relevance of susy for electroweak - scale physics .    in this context",
    ", the sector of the theory responsible for electroweak symmetry breaking has a special status .",
    "while all superpartners of the known standard model particles can be made heavy by simply rising soft supersymmetry - breaking mass parameters in the model , the higgs sector necessarily contains a physical higgs scalar whose mass does not depend sensitively on the details of soft masses but is fixed by the scale of the electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "more in detail , in the mssm , unlike in the sm , the quartic coupling is not an independent parameter but @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the @xmath8 gauge couplings .    equation ( [ lambdamssm ] ) has the important consequence that the value , and renormalization , of the quartic coupling in the mssm is related to that of @xmath9 .",
    "this means in turn that the mass of one ( usually the lightest one ) of the cp - even scalar mass eigenvalues is not controlled by the susy breaking parameters , but by the electroweak breaking ( @xmath10 gev ) .",
    "the existence of the sm - like higgs is a generic feature of all supersymmetric standard models ( ssm ) . in the mssm",
    "the bound m_h^2m_z^2 ^ 22m_z^2 , [ cota ] follows directly from ( [ lambdamssm ] ) .",
    "( [ cota ] ) seems an indication that non - discovery of the higgs boson at lep could rule out the mssm independently of any direct susy searches .",
    "in fact , since present experimental bounds at lep already set fairly stringent bounds on the higgs mass m_h90  gev , does it mean that the mssm is already ruled out ?",
    "were it not for radiative corrections  @xcite the mssm would have already been excluded !",
    "the leading effects are included in radiative corrections from the top - stop sector , with @xmath11 mixing parameterized by _",
    "[ mixing ]    in the absence of mixing , leading higher - order corrections  @xcite are resummed by shifting the energy scale ( @xmath12 ) in the one - loop result is related to the running @xmath13 top - quark mass @xmath14 by the relation @xmath15 $ ] , where @xmath16 is the @xmath17 coupling constant . ] , m^2_h , rad = m_t^4 ( ) .",
    "[ radcorr ] in the presence of mixing there is an important ( threshold ) contribution as m^2_h , th= _",
    "t^2(2-_t^2 ) . [ threshold ]",
    "these corrections push the upper mass limit for the lightest higgs boson of the mssm up to @xmath18 gev ( for a top - quark mass @xmath2 gev and @xmath19 tev ) , as can be seen from the lowest curve in the right panel of fig .  1 .",
    "so there appears an immediate question : what would happen if ( when ) experimental bounds on the higgs mass reach ( and overcome ) @xmath20 125 gev ? should we give up ssms ?",
    "a singlet field @xmath21 added to the mssm does not spoil unification and from this point of view it is as legitimate as the mssm itself .",
    "but the @xmath21 field can couple in the superpotential @xmath22 to the higgs sector as w=_1 s h_1h_2 , leading to a contribution to the higgs quartic coupling as = _ 1 ^ 2 ^2 2 .",
    "[ deltas ] the contribution ( [ deltas ] ) can be sizable for small values of @xmath23 .",
    "an upper triviality limit on @xmath24 ( and thus on @xmath25 ) exists if one requires perturbativity of all parameters of the theory in the energy range [ @xmath26 .",
    "in fact the absolute limit is reached when @xmath27 goes non - perturbative , i.e. when ) does not matter for the precise value of the bound since the transition to the non - perturbative regime is very abrupt . ]",
    "[ nopert ] this constraint is very strong , since @xmath24 increases rapidly with the scale , and the gain in @xmath0 with respect to the mssm value is modest  @xcite .    inspection of the renormalization group equations  @xcite @xmath28\\lambda_1 \\nonumber\\\\ 8\\pi^2\\frac{dh_{t}}{dt } & = & \\left[-\\frac{8}{3}g_3 ^ 2 -\\frac{3}{2}g_2 ^ 2-\\frac{13}{30}g_1 ^ 2 + 3h_t^2+\\frac{1}{2}h_b^2 + \\frac{3}{4 } \\lambda_1 ^ 2\\right ] h_t \\nonumber\\\\ 8\\pi^2\\frac{dh_{b}}{dt } & = & \\left[-\\frac{8}{3}g_3 ^ 2 -\\frac{3}{2}g_2 ^",

    "therefore , the stronger the gauge couplings , the slower the evolution of @xmath24 , the larger values of @xmath30 are consistent with perturbativity , and finally the higher values of @xmath0 can be reached .",
    "gauge couplings can be strengthened , without spoiling gauge unification , by adding complete ( anomaly free ) @xmath31 representations  @xcite .",
    "the simplest possibility is adding a number @xmath32 of pairs @xmath33 .",
    "in fact for @xmath34 perturbativity is almost saturated ( @xmath35 ) if @xmath36 .",
    "the unification of the gauge couplings and the upper bounds on @xmath0 for the mssm plus a singlet and @xmath34 are shown in the left and right panels , respectively , of fig .  1 .",
    "we observe from fig .  1 that the maximum value of @xmath0 is at @xmath37 and corresponds to @xmath38 gev , which is a more sizable increase with respect to the mssm .",
    "suppose again that our experimental colleagues exclude , in a few years from now ( lhc ) a higgs as light as @xmath20 155 gev ! should we ( once for all ) exclude the ssm ?",
    "we will next describe what we consider to be the absolute upper bound on the lightest higgs mass in ssm consistent with gauge unification , or even with perturbativity for scales below the planck mass .",
    "to maximize the upper bound on @xmath0 we next assume that the model also contains extra chiral multiplets with the appropriate quantum numbers to give couplings of the form @xmath39 .",
    "thus , @xmath40 can only be a singlet ( @xmath21 ) or a @xmath41 triplet ( @xmath42 )  @xcite .",
    "such terms modify the quartic higgs coupling via @xmath43-terms . from the gauge - invariant trilinear superpotential [ superp ]",

    "different terms have different @xmath23 dependence and are important in different regimes .",
    "for example , the @xmath44 contribution will be crucial for the upper limit in the large-@xmath23 region .",
    "@xmath21 and @xmath45 induce the same @xmath23 dependence but the @xmath24 correction can be more important than that of @xmath46 . for this reason we do not take into account the possible effect of @xmath45 representations .    to achieve unification with only one scale @xmath47 (",
    "@xmath48 1 tev ) is not completely trivial . when the mssm is enlarged by one singlet @xmath21 and a pair @xmath49 ( to cancel anomalies ) the running @xmath50 and @xmath51 meet at @xmath52 gev .",
    "interestingly enough , this is closer to the heterotic string scale than the mssm unification scale .",
    "of course , @xmath53 fails to unify unless extra matter is added .",
    "this can be achieved , for example , by adding 4 ( @xmath54 ) [ @xmath8 ` singlet quark ' chiral multiplets ] or ( @xmath54 ) plus one @xmath55 octet .",
    "in addition to this , we can still have a ( @xmath56 ) @xmath31 pair , which will not change the unification scale .",
    "the unification of the couplings is shown in fig .  2 ( left panel , solid lines ) .    for comparison ,",
    "dashed lines show the running couplings when their rg beta functions are fixed in such a way that all couplings reach a landau pole at the unification scale . in this case",
    "the low - energy couplings are fully determined by the ` light ' matter content of the model ( which fixes the rg beta functions ) .",
    "the dashed lines can be considered as the perturbative upper limit on the gauge couplings , and comparison with the solid lines shows that our model is close to saturation and represents a concrete realization of the most extreme scenario to maximize the @xmath0 bound .",
    "the emphasis here should lie in this fact rather than in the plausibility or physics motivation of the model _ per se_.    having optimized in this way the most appropriate running gauge couplings , we turn to the running of @xmath24 and @xmath57 .",

    "@xcite , which include two - loop rg improvement and stop - mixing effects .",
    "we fix @xmath2 gev .    before presenting our results",
    ", it is worth discussing in more detail the bound presented in eq .",
    "( [ bound ] ) .",
    "if the extra fields responsible for the enhancement of @xmath0 sit at 1  tev , should their effect not decouple from the low - energy effective theory ?",
    "indeed , in a simple toy model with w = ms^2+_1 h_1h_2 s , the limit @xmath60 leads to an effective superpotential in which no renormalizable coupling of @xmath21 to @xmath61 exists [ technically , the @xmath43-term contribution ( @xmath62 ) to the higgs doublet self - interactions is cancelled by a tree diagram that interchanges the heavy singlet , thus realizing decoupling ] .",
    "if , to avoid this , we take @xmath63 , more than one light higgs will appear in the spectrum .",
    "a complicated mixed squared - mass matrix results whose lightest eigenvalue does not saturate the bound ( [ bound ] ) . is then this mass limit simply too conservative an overestimate of the real upper limit ?",
    "it is easy to convince oneself that , in the presence of soft breaking masses , the perfect decoupling cancellation obtained in the large susy mass limit does not take place ( we assume @xmath64 ) and the final lightest higgs mass depends in a complicated way on these soft mass parameters .",
    "the interesting outcome is that soft masses can be adjusted in order to saturate the bound ( [ bound ] ) ; the numbers we will present can thus be reached in particular models and no limits lower than these can be given without additional assumptions ( which we will not make here , in the interest of generality ) .",
    "the final bound , with radiative corrections included , is presented in fig .  2 ( right panel ) .",
    "for @xmath65 the main contribution to the @xmath0 value comes from the @xmath24 coupling .",
    "in particular for @xmath66 the effect of @xmath24 is maximized and yields a bound on @xmath67 155 gev , as in the model presented in the previous section  @xcite . for larger values of @xmath23",
    "the effect of @xmath24 drops off and @xmath44 dominates .",
    "we also see that the bound can reach values as large as 205 - 210 gev , that we should consider as the absolute bound in supersymmetric models , which are perturbative up to the high scale and without intermediate scales .",
    "finally we can notice that the @xmath68 coupling does play a role only for @xmath69  @xcite where the bound is @xmath20 140 gev .",
    "in conclusion , we calculate a numerical absolute upper limit on the mass of the lightest supersymmetric higgs boson for any model with arbitrary matter content compatible with gauge coupling unification around ( and perturbativity up to ) the string scale . with this assumption ,",
    "we show that this light higgs mass can be as high as @xmath20 205 gev .",
    "the model saturating this bound has asymptotically divergent gauge couplings and points toward non - perturbative unification . besides being of obvious interest to the experimentalists , this result has interest for theorists too .",
    "if higgs searches reach the mssm bounds without finding a signal for a higgs boson , this could be taken , if one is willing to stick to ( perturbative ) low - energy supersymmetry , as evidence for additional matter beyond the minimal model .",
