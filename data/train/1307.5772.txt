    "it has been argued that the description of spacetime as a smooth manifold is not adequate at the very small distances such as those of the order of the planck length . instead , in this region , the spacetime structure might require a description in terms of noncommutative geometry .",
    "this may result in numerous consequences , some already seen at the theoretical level , affecting much of the high energy physics , including implications for astrophysics .",
    "the change in the nature of the spacetime structure requires the modification of a mathematical setup and eventually leads to a need of rewriting the quantum field theory in the presence of quantum group symmetries .    since the poincar group describes the symmetry inherent to the quantum field theory , it is plausible to assume that the symmetry adequate to such a theory on a noncommutative space might be described by a quantum deformation of the original poincar group .",
    "one way to accommodate this idea is within the framework of hopf algebras .",
    "one of the most extensively studied hopf algebras in the role of such a deformation is the @xmath0-poincar algebra @xcite , with @xmath1 denoting a masslike deformation parameter , usually associated with the planck mass .",
    "it is known for some time that the coproduct of the quantum group codifies the curvature in the momentum space and that a noncommutative spacetime algebra multiplication appears as dual to the coproduct on the momentum algebra ; moreover the two dual hopf algebras together form a noncommutative phase space algebra built through a cross ( smash ) product algebra construction , more specifically the heisenberg double @xcite . curiously",
    ", the idea that the curvature of momentum space could imply the noncommutativity of spacetime does not appear to be a recent one , since it can be traced back to the first half of the past century  @xcite .",
    "later on , this led to a quantum geometric picture in which curved momentum space is dual to noncommutative spacetime and where the relation to quantum groups is made explicit  @xcite .",
    "the authors of the present paper find @xmath1-poincar algebra and the emergent @xmath1-minkowski spacetime interesting from many reasons .",
    "however , the following two may be particularly highlighted .",
    "already in the early study of certain limits of quantum gravity coupled to matter in  @xcite , possible effective quantum field theories on noncommutative @xmath0-minkowski space were found by integrating out the gravitational degrees of freedom from the generating functional .",
    "the @xmath0-minkowski spacetime and @xmath0-poincar group may also provide a setting appropriate for trapping the signals of quantum gravity effects , what might be an explanation for the observations of ultrahigh energy cosmic rays , contradicting the usual understanding of electron - positron pair production in collisions of high energy photons and other high energy astrophysical processes alike .",
    "one possible explanation of the deviations of this kind may rely on the modified dispersion relations @xcite , whose distortion can eventually be traced back to noncommutative structure of the spacetime , particularly in the case of @xmath0 type .",
    "all these may be the relics of the quantum gravity effects and in turn might allow a description in terms of the effective noncommutative quantum field theories ( ncqft ) .",
    "the latter is particularly interesting in light of the arguments supporting the assertion of ncqft on a @xmath1-minkowski space emerging from the quantum gravity in a certain low energy limit @xcite .    in @xcite",
    "the properties of the star product in the _ natural _ realization of the @xmath1-minkowski algebra are investigated , together with the properties of the resulting free scalar field theory constructed from this particular star product .",
    "the above mentioned realization is the type of a differential representation of the @xmath1-minkowski algebra that is intimately related to the so called classical basis of @xmath1-poincar @xcite .",
    "these properties have been further studied in @xcite and the analysis has been extended to include the implications of the hermitization process on the star product and the resulting scalar field theory . in this paper , we extend this analysis to include an arbitrary realization of @xmath1-minkowski algebra , investigate the corresponding star products and the effects of hermitization on their properties .",
    "these issues are particularly important when one seeks to find out how the physical results depend on the choice of a realization of the spacetime algebra . in this direction ,",
    "the dependence on the realization has been studied for the electrodynamics @xcite and the geodesics @xcite in @xmath1-minkowski spacetime .",
    "furthermore , the time delay phenomenon for photons having different energies has been investigated in the context of relative locality @xcite to see how it varies with realizations @xcite .",
    "the properties of the scalar field propagation in the noncommutative @xmath2 model are investigated in @xcite in the case of the _ natural _ realization .",
    "it would be interesting to compare these results with the calculations for other realizations .",
    "while it is desirable to identify the properties universal to all realizations of @xmath1-minkowski spacetime , those properties which are not invariant , may , after comparison with the experimental data , serve to narrow down the set of allowed realizations .",
    "we hope that the experiments may reach the necessary level of sensitivity for this in near future ( see astrophysical review  @xcite ) . to address these issues , it is necessary to set up the adequate framework and investigate the mathematical properties of the star products related to each of the realizations of @xmath1-minkowski .",
    "the present paper serves this purpose .    after reviewing in section 2 the general notions used in the analysis , in sections 3 and 4 we introduce the star products corresponding to various realizations and",
    "present their properties . then , in section 5 , we describe the process of hermitization and its accompanying impact on the properties of the star product . up to the section 6",
    "the analysis is general , while in section 7 we review the most common concrete examples .",
    "new results are presented in sections 3 , 4 and 5 and the most important technical tools for understanding these sections are developed in appendices .",

    "this relationship between the two operations is a natural consequence of the fact that the algebras @xmath42  and @xmath74  are isomorphic as the vector spaces .",
    "moreover , they are also isomorphic at the algebra level if the pointwise multiplication on @xmath74  is replaced by the star product .",
    "let us denote by @xmath81  the algebra @xmath74  in which the star product is used instead of pointwise multiplication .",
    "then there is a linear map @xmath82 given by @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the result .",
    "it can be shown that this map is an isomorphism .",
    "the essential observation is that the difference @xmath85 is linear or higher order in @xmath86 and we see by induction on the order of monomial that @xmath87 equals @xmath88 up to the lower order terms .",
    "thus the bijectivity of @xmath89 easily follows from pbw theorem . for a detailed discussion of the properties of the operator @xmath89 ( in the case @xmath90 ) we refer the reader to ref .",

    "then , we look for a similarity transformation @xmath96 that maps one set to another in the form : @xmath97 note that @xmath98 is taken to depend on @xmath99 only because we want to keep linearity of @xmath22 in @xmath100 . for simplicity",

    "it is clear that the differential realization ( [ c1 ] ) need not be hermitian in general , in the sense that the condition @xmath112 may fail . however , for a given @xmath34 , it may be made hermitian by cleverly choosing the function @xmath113 .",
    "since for each realization of the form  ( [ c1 ] ) there is a corresponding star product , this is the case for the hermitian realizations as well .",
    "the star products corresponding to hermitian realizations are called here the hermitian star products .",
    "note that we do not use this term in a different sense that the property @xmath114 holds .",
    "indeed , the hermitian star products in our sense do not need to satisfy this property in general .",
    "however , for some very common orderings ( realizations ) including the weyl symmetric and left - right symmetric ordering , this property is satisfied .",
    "it is also noteworthy that for each @xmath34 there exists a whole family of hermitian realizations ( infinitely many ) and consequently there exists a whole family of star products corresponding to these hermitian realizations .",
    "each star product is thus characterized by specifying two functions , @xmath115 and @xmath113 . in what follows",
    "we therefore use the symbol @xmath116 to denote the star product and also add the subscripts @xmath117 and @xmath67 to various quantities that are to be introduced in the following , to reflect their dependence on the particular realization in the class ( [ c1 ] ) . the analysis is first carried out for the most general situation of an arbitrary @xmath115 and @xmath113 , not necessarily corresponding to a hermitian realization , and then only after making this case clear , we specialize it to the hermitian realization and the hermitian star product .",

    "in this section we apply the general results developed so far by working them out on the four characteristic and important examples that realize the @xmath0-minkowski spacetime .",

    "we particularly consider the hermitian realizations corresponding to @xmath243 ( that is , hermitian realizations obtained through the standard symmetrization , @xmath244 ( see section 4 ) ) .    before going to special cases , we restate the general results for the star product and a scalar product corresponding to the realization @xmath245 @xmath246 this can also be expressed as    @xmath247    the scalar product between two plane waves , with momenta @xmath248 and @xmath249 respectively , is thus proportional to @xmath250      for the left covariant realization , @xmath251 , which means that @xmath252 and in this case one gets @xmath253 consequently , @xmath254 and @xmath255 where @xmath256 .",

    "@xmath67 being constant , the integration in ( [ codkaku ] ) becomes trivial , giving @xmath268 and consequently @xmath269 with these results we have for the hermitized ( @xmath265 ) left covariant realization @xmath270 and the scalar product between two plane waves , with momenta @xmath248 and @xmath249 , respectively is thus proportional to @xmath271      for the right covariant realization , @xmath272 , which means that @xmath273 a similar analysis as before , when applied to this particular situation , gives @xmath274 with @xmath275 ( @xmath276 ) .",

    "one can easily check that @xmath279 similarly as before the determinant for the case of right covariant realization can be calculated as @xmath280 hermitization procedure for @xmath281 identifies the @xmath282 to be @xmath283 .",
    "this leads to @xmath284 and consequently the orthonormality property of the plane waves in the right covariant realization can be expressed as @xmath285      for the weyl symmetric realization @xmath286 , that is @xmath287 where @xmath288 by repeating the same steps as before , we get @xmath289 where @xmath290 , @xmath291 . again , the antipode can be deduced by setting @xmath292 and @xmath293 , @xmath294 this implies that the antipode @xmath295 has to satisfy the relation @xmath296 the solution is @xmath297 , in consistency with the results in appendix b. the calculation of the determinant in ( [ example ] ) gives @xmath298 where @xmath299 again , the hermitization procedure for @xmath265 gives rise to @xmath282 , which is this time nontrivial : @xmath300 this leads to @xmath301 and consequently the orthonormality property for the plane waves in the weyl symmetric realization can be expressed as @xmath302 however , it is interesting to note that the ordinary plane waves are orthonormalized for the scalar product @xmath303 , in the case of weyl symmetric ordering , @xmath304 it is seen from ( [ starproductonastar ] ) and ( [ enaikaiksdager ] ) that , in the case of the weyl symmetric star product , the additional factor @xmath305 in  ( [ enaikaiksdager ] ) cancels out the corresponding factor in ( [ weylsymmetricscalarproduct ] ) , giving rise to the orthonormalization property  ( [ orthonorm ] ) . in the next subsection , we shall see that the same property holds when the scalar product is introduced in terms of the _ natural _ realization .",
    "therefore , as it was the case with the weyl symmetric realization , the plane waves are also orthonormal in the _ natural _ realization .",
    "this feature was noticed for the first time in  @xcite . in contrast , for the left and right covariant realizations our analysis shows that this property does not hold .",

    "+ it has to be emphasized that in all four cases presented in the tables , the function @xmath322 is chosen so that it corresponds to the hermitization procedure determined by the parameter @xmath323 ( see section 4 ) . on the other side , the scalar product ( the last line in the tables )",
    "is calculated by using eqs.([starproductonastar ] ) and ( [ enaikaiksdager ] ) as @xmath324 from the table it is readily seen that the plane waves with different momenta constitute an orthonormal set of vectors in weyl symmetric and _ natural _ basis , while in left covariant and right covariant do not . this property is rather appealing because it implies that upon integration the star product of two functions can be replaced by an ordinary multiplication .",
    "it is still an open question whether this property can be related in some way to the trace property of the action integral or at least shed some light on this otherwise a notoriously difficult problem .",
    "the same constatation applies to the problem of finding the appropriate integration measure in the action integral valid for @xmath0-type of deformation , which is a crucial ingredient in discussing the noncommutative action integral defined on the @xmath0-deformed space . in turn both of these issues are intimately related to the proper introduction of a gauge theory in the above setting .",
    "namely , when introducing a gauge field into the theory , then one might have the trace property satisfied by the gauge field integral because it ensures a gauge invariance of the action and a theory .",
    "we point out that in general different realizations of @xmath0-minkowski spacetime might have different physical consequences ( see also  @xcite ) .",
