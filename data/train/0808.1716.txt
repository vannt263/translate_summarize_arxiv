    "our sun is a magnetic star whose cycles of magnetic activity must arise from organized dynamo action in its interior .",
    "this dynamo action is achieved by turbulent plasma motions in the solar convection zone , which spans the outer 29% of the sun in radius . here vigorous convective motions and rotation couple to drive the differential rotation and meridional circulation .",
    "these global - scale flows are important ingredients in stellar dynamo theory , providing shear which may build and organize fields on global scales . when our sun was younger , it must have rotated much more rapidly , as is suggested both by the solar wind which continually removes angular momentum from the sun and by many observations of rapidly rotating solar - like stars . in more rapidly rotating suns",
    "the coupling between rotation and convection is strong and must continue to drive global scales of flow .",
    "understanding the nature of convection , differential rotation and meridional circulation in more rapidly rotating stars is a crucial step towards understanding stellar dynamos .",
    "the manner in which the sun achieves global - scale dynamo action is gradually being sorted out .",
    "helioseismology , which uses acoustic oscillations to probe the radial structure of the star as well as the convective flows beneath the surface , has revealed that the solar differential rotation profile observed at the surface prints throughout the convection zone with two prominent regions of radial shear .",
    "the near - surface shear layer occupies the outer 5% of the sun , whereas a tachocline of shear at the base of the convection zone separates the strong differential rotation of that zone from the uniform rotation of the deeper radiative interior ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the solar global magnetic dynamo , responsible for the 22-year cycles of activity ,",
    "is now believed to be seated in that tachocline . in such interface dynamo models , magnetic fields generated in the bulk of the convection zone",
    "are pumped into the tachocline where the radial shear builds strong toroidal magnetic fields , with magnetic buoyancy leading to loops that rise upward and erupt through the solar surface .",
    "the differential rotation plays an important role in building and organizing the global - scale fields while the meridional circulations may be important for returning flux to the base of the convection zone and advecting it equatorward , enabling cycles of magnetic activity . by studying the coupling of rotation and convection over a range of conditions ,",
    "we are likely to learn about the operation of the current solar dynamo and about the nature of dynamos operating in our sun s past and in other solar - like stars .    observations of young solar - like stars indicate that they rotate as much as 50 times faster than the current solar rate .",
    "many of these more rapidly rotating suns possess strong magnetic fields . a correlation between rotation and magnetic activity",
    "is observed over a range of stellar types and populations , indicating that more rapidly rotating stars may have stronger stellar dynamos .",
    "probing the nature of these dynamos and the impact of faster rotation on the internal stellar dynamics requires both accurate observations and detailed dynamical models of the stellar interiors .",
    "the faster flows of differential rotation are much easier to detect than the relatively slow motions associated with meridional circulations ; observations across the hr diagram indicate that differential rotation is a common feature in many stars .",
    "asteroseismic observations with the kepler and corot missions may soon begin to constrain the internal rotation structure . at present only measurements of surface differential rotation are available , as assessed with a variety of techniques including photometric variability @xcite , doppler imaging @xcite and fourier transform methods .",

    "such global - scale simulations of solar convection conducted in full spherical shells sought to capture the largest scales of convective flows and began to study how they can establish differential rotation and meridional circulations .",

    ", solar convection simulations are now beginning to make detailed contact with the observational constraints provided by helioseismology .",
    "other efforts have focused on the vigorous turbulence and the dynamo action achieved in the bulk of the solar convection zone @xcite , with recent studies beginning to include the tachocline as a region of penetrative overshoot , shear , and magnetic field amplification @xcite .",
    "facilitated by these computational advances , models of convection and dynamo action within the cores of a - type stars have also begun to be investigated @xcite .    to date ,",
    "most models of stellar differential rotation in stars like our sun that rotate more rapidly have been carried out in 2-d under the simplifying assumptions of mean field theory .",
    "the time is ripe to pursue the question with fully 3-d simulations of global - scale stellar convection .    in order to study solar - like stars that rotate faster , our previous work focused on a series of 3-d compressible simulations within a spherical shell using the anelastic spherical harmonic ( ash ) code for stars rotating from one to five times the current solar rate @xcite .",
    "these preliminary hydrodynamic simulations explored how stellar convection changes with more rapid rotation , including the differential rotation and meridional circulation that is achieved .",
    "comparable studies have been carried out by @xcite studying younger stars with deeper convection zones . in our simulations we found that remarkable nests of vigorous convection emerge in the equatorial regions .",
    "namely , convective structures at low latitudes about the equator can exhibit strong spatial modulation with longitude , and at high rotation rates the convection is confined to narrow intervals ( or nests ) in longitude . in the more turbulent simulations presented in this paper , which span a larger range of rotation rates from one to ten times the current solar rate ,",
    "the phenomena of modulated convection has persisted and the active nests of convection are prominent features at the higher rotation rates .",
    "these nests of localized convection persist for long intervals of time and despite their small filling factor maintain a strong differential rotation .",
    "the emergence of spatially localized convective states has been observed in other systems , particularly in theoretical studies of doubly - diffusive systems such as thermosolutal convection ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in laboratory studies of convection in binary fluids ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "in many of these systems , spatial modulation occurs in the weakly nonlinear regime close to the onset of convection .",
    "in contrast , our simulations of solar convection are in a regime of fully developed turbulent convection .",
    "we describe briefly in  [ sec : ash ] the 3-d anelastic spherical shell model and the parameter space explored by our simulations . in  [ sec : convection ] we discuss the nature of convection realized in more rapidly rotating stars and the emergence of spatially - localized patterns of convection . in   [ sec : global scale flows]-[sec : energies ] we examine the global - scale flows realized in our simulations , including differential rotation and meridional circulation , and their scaling with more rapid rotation .",
    "a detailed exploration of the active nests of convection is presented in  [ sec : patches ] .",
    "we reflect in  [ sec : conclusion ] on the significance of our findings .",
    "to study through simulations the global scales of motion likely achieved in stellar convection zones , we must employ a global model which simultaneously captures the spherical shell geometry and admits the possibility of zonal jets and large eddy vortices , and of convective plumes that may span the depth of the convection zone .",
    "the solar convection zone is intensely turbulent and molecular values of viscosity and thermal diffusivity in the sun are estimated to be very small . as a consequence , numerical simulations can not hope to resolve all scales of motion present in real solar convection and a compromise must be struck between resolving the important dynamics within small regions and capturing the connectivity and geometry of the global scales .",
    "we opt here for the latter by studying a full shell of convection .",
    "our tool for exploring stellar convection is the anelastic spherical harmonic ( ash ) code , which is described in detail in @xcite and in @xcite .",
    "ash is designed to run efficiently on massively parallel architectures .",
    "ash solves the three - dimensional ( 3-d ) anelastic equations of motion in a rotating spherical shell using the pseudo - spectral method .",
    "the thermodynamic variations and the three components of mass flux are expanded in spherical harmonics to resolve their horizontal structure and in chebyshev polynomials to resolve their radial structure .",
    "the anelastic approximation is used to capture the effects of density stratification without having to resolve sound waves which have short periods ( about 5 minutes ) relative to the dynamical time scales of most interest ( months to years ) .",
    "the mass flux remains divergence - free by using a poloidal - toroidal representation .",
    "temporal discretization is accomplished using a semi - implicit crank - nicholson time - stepping scheme for linear terms and an explicit adams - bashforth scheme for nonlinear terms . under the anelastic approximation",

    ", all cases appear to be statistically stationary in terms of the angular momentum fluxes and the kinetic energies .",
    "we believe that the differential rotation profiles presented are effectively stationary , though there are small fluctuations as determined from short averages over a few rotation periods . certain cases ( including  g5 )",
    "were evolved for much longer intervals ( over 10000 days and more than 2000 rotation periods ) to explore the long - term behavior of convective patterns in these rapidly rotating systems . to test that our results are not unduly subject to hysteresis in the system",

    "with more rapid rotation , a prominent longitudinal modulation appears in the patterns of equatorial convection . at the higher rotation rates the equatorial convection",
    "is confined to one or two nests , with streaming zonal flow filling the regions outside these nests of convection .",
    "these nests can persist for intervals spanning many hundreds of rotation periods , often with little change .",
    "two nest states sometimes evolve into single nest states as one nest overtakes another .",

    "this parametrized flux acts as volume cooling term that removes flux from the regions where it is dominant ; the dynamics were influenced by the presence of this cooling layer .",
    "the cases presented in this paper have a narrower unresolved flux layer , confined now to the upper 10% of the convection zone , and consequently much more vigorous convection is realized throughout the domain . in these more turbulent cases , the phenomena of localized nests of convection",
    "is realized at somewhat higher rotation rates .",

    "snapshots of the radial velocity near the top of the domain ( @xmath132 ) are shown in mollweide projection for four cases : g1 , g3 , g5 and g10 .",
    "the convection patterns are complex and time dependent , with asymmetries between the upflows and downflows owing to the density stratification : narrow , fast downflow lanes are surrounded by broad , relatively weak upflows .",
    "there is a clear difference in both the scale and structure of convection at high and low latitudes . in the equatorial regions ( roughly @xmath133 in latitude ) ,",
    "the downflows organize into large structures ( loosely called banana cells ) aligned with the rotation axis , thus extending in the north - south direction . at high rotation rates",
    "this tendency for alignment becomes pronounced , largely in the spirit of the taylor - proudman theorem , and the downflow network exhibits little of the east - west branching visible in case  g1 .",
    "these downflow lanes propagate in a prograde sense relative to the bulk rotation rate and do so more rapidly than the differential rotation which they themselves establish .",
    "the nests of convection , when they appear at the higher rotation rates , propagate at an intermediate rate as denoted by the heavy dashed contours in figure  [ fig : ab2_turf]_f - h_. we defer discussion of the nature of these nests of convection until later .",
    "individual convective cells persist for about 10 to 30 days . in the higher latitude regions ,",
    "the convection cells are more isotropic and the downflow network organizes on smaller scales .",
    "convection in these regions is vigorous and complex , with upflows and their downflow networks in a constant dance .",
    "the convective cells have a cusped appearance , with downflows leading upflows as both propagate in a retrograde fashion ( most apparent in figs  [ fig : ab2_turf]@xmath134 ) .",
    "strong vortical plumes form in the interstices of the downflow network at both high and low latitudes . in the polar regions above the middle of the convection zone ,",
    "the sense of vorticity in these downflow plumes is generally cyclonic : counterclockwise in the northern hemisphere and clockwise in the southern .",
    "as they descend through the mid - layer their vorticity changes and they become largely anti - cyclonic . in contrast , the polar upflows are anti - cyclonic at all depths .",
    "the latitudinal variation of convection patterns can be in part understood by considering a cylinder tangent to the base of the convection zone and aligned with the rotation axis . within our geometry",
    ", this tangent cylinder intersects the outer boundary at about @xmath135 of latitude .",
    "it is well known that in a rotating convective shell the flow dynamics are different inside and outside of the tangent cylinder , owing to differences in the connectivity of the flows , the influence of the coriolis forces and distance from the rotation axis ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "these differences become more evident as the rotation rate , and hence the rotational constraints on the convection , increases . with more rapid rotation the longitudinal extent of the convective cells becomes progressively smaller .",
    "linear theory , in the boussinesq approximation , predicts that the wavenumber of the most unstable mode scales with rotation as @xmath136 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for polar and equatorial convection .",
    "this effect is found in anelastic systems as well and in our simulations is evident at both high and low latitudes",
    ".    shown at right in figures  [ fig : ab2_turf]_e - h _ are the profiles of differential rotation ( as angular velocity @xmath137 ) realized in these simulations .",
    "these @xmath138 profiles are azimuthally and temporally averaged over a period of roughly 200  days .",
    "all of our more rapidly rotating solar - like stars exhibit solar - like differential rotation profiles , with prograde ( fast ) equators and retrograde ( slow ) poles .",
    "contours of constant angular velocity are aligned nearly on cylinders , influenced by the taylor - proudman theorem , though recent simulations of solar convection suggest that this is sensitive to the treatment of the bottom thermal boundary condition @xcite . as first shown in mean - field models by @xcite and",
    "then in models of global - scale convection by @xcite , introducing a weak latitudinal gradient of entropy at the base of the convection zone , consistent with a thermal wind balance in a tachocline of shear , can serve to rotate the @xmath137 contours toward the more radial alignment deduced from helioseismology without significantly changing either the overall @xmath137 contrast with latitude or the convective patterns .",
    "we expect similar behavior here , as briefly explored by @xcite , but have not explored this issue in detail at the higher rotation rates .",
    "more rapidly rotating suns may very well also possess tachoclines , but at this stage there is no observational evidence of this .",
    "thus we have simplified these simulations by imposing a constant entropy at the bottom boundary .",
    "our contours of @xmath137 in figure  [ fig : ab2_turf ] show some differences between the northern and southern hemispheres , particularly at higher latitudes , and these differences decrease with more rapid rotation .",
    "the patterns of convection are not simply symmetric about the equator , and thus the accompanying mean zonal flows can be expected to show some variations between the two hemispheres . also shown are radial cuts of @xmath137 at six fixed latitudes that make evident the angular velocity contrasts with radius and latitude achieved in these simulations .",
    "the absolute contrast in latitude and radius clearly grows with rotation rate , and will be discussed in ",
    "[ sec : global scale flows ]",
    ".    a most striking result of our simulations is the emergence of persistent , spatially modulated convection in the equatorial regions at high rotation rates . at these low latitudes , convection becomes modulated in longitude and forms distinct active nests where the convective vigor is enhanced compared to the regions outside .",
    "the amplitude of the convective motions and enthalpy transport is larger within these nests , and indeed at the highest rotation rates , convection in the equatorial band is confined entirely to the nests .",
    "these nests of convection propagate at a velocity distinct from either the zonal flow of differential rotation or that of the individual cells of convection and persist for very long periods of time ( more than 5000  days in case  g5 ) .",
    "the nature of these active nests of spatially localized convection will be explored in detail in  [ sec : patches ] .    weak modulation in longitude",
    "is already evident at low rotation rates .",
    "when long time series are considered we have positively identified nests of convection in all simulations rotating at @xmath139 .",
    "as the rotation rate increases , the modulation level gradually increases ; at the highest rotation rates ( @xmath140 ) the equatorial convection is almost solely confined to the nests .",
    "the convection realized in case  g10 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ab2_turf]@xmath141 ) is marked by this extreme modulation , with strong upflows and downflows inside the nest and very little convection in the surrounding regions .",
    "these most rapidly rotating cases maintain a strong differential rotation profile , even though the equatorial convection occupies only a narrow interval in longitude .",
    "the regions outside the nest are filled with fast streaming zonal flows consistent with the differential rotation .      the nests of enhanced convection span the convection zone and propagate everywhere at a constant prograde angular velocity relative to the bulk rotation rate of the star .",
    "a contour corresponding to this characteristic propagation rate is overplotted on the differential rotation profiles in figures  [ fig : ab2_turf]_f - h _ for cases  g3 , g5 and  g10 .",
    "as is evident from these profiles , the angular velocity associated with the differential rotation exceeds that of the propagation rate of the nests near the surface and is slower than that near the base of the convection zone .",
    "the nests of convection therefore live within an environment of substantial zonal shear with radius , as is quantified for case  g5 in figure  [ fig : g5_patch_shear ] . here",
    "the shearing zonal velocity of differential rotation is plotted in latitude at six radial depths . at all depths",
    "there is substantial zonal flow through the nests of convection .    in other studies of solar convection",
    ", we have found that strong downflow lanes extend throughout the entire depth of the domain . in our more rapidly rotating stars , this connectivity with depth changes markedly , as is illustrated for case  g5 in figure  [ fig : g5_connectivity ] showing radial velocities throughout the convection zone . in these rapidly rotating suns ,",
    "the strong variation of mean zonal flow with radius in the equatorial regions prevents all but the strongest downflows from spanning the convection zone . within the nest of enhanced convection the plumes are able to traverse the convection zone . yet in the quieter regions outside , the weaker downflow plumes are truncated by shear before reaching the middle of the convection zone .",
    "it is evident ( fig  [ fig : g5_connectivity]@xmath142 ) that the amplitude of convective motions is pronounced at all depths within the nest of active convection .",
    "the downflowing plumes are influenced by the strong radial shear and some break into multiple cells with radius even before the full blown nests of localized convection emerge , as is evident already in our simulation rotating at twice the solar rate ( case  g2 ) .",
    "when the downflow networks only span a portion of the convection zone and experience a limited range of the full density stratification , the importance of compressible effects decreases .",
    "this has important consequences for the energetics of the simulations , particularly the radial kinetic energy flux , as will be addressed in ",
    "[ sec : energies ] .",
    "in contrast , the downflowing plumes in the polar regions experience much less shear from either the differential rotation or the relatively weak meridional circulations and continue to span the entire convection zone depth .      in these rapidly rotating suns , the turbulent alignment of convection with the rotation axis leads to a net latitudinal transport of enthalpy , yielding a prominent latitudinal gradient of temperature .",
    "the resulting thermal structuring in case  g5 is shown in figure  [ fig : g5_thermal_structure ] , presenting both the mean temperature profile and representative temperature fluctuations in a snapshot near the surface . in the latter ,",

    "spatially modulated states in this parameter regime have also been observed in geophysically motivated 3-d boussinesq simulations of convection within a thick , rotating spherical shell . in these studies , spatially localized states emerged at moderate rayleigh numbers , involving an equilibrium between the shearing flow of differential rotation destroying convective eddies and the reynolds stresses in the convection driving the differential rotation .",
    "these effects led to localized states where convection occupied a limited portion of the domain and the region outside the convective patch was filled with quiescent streaming flow and almost no radial motions . in the quiescent regions the thermal gradients become increasingly unstable until they are advected back into the patch where they help sustain the convective eddies .",

    "convective cells collide and interact , and the strongest survive to emerge from the front of the nest , where they speed up as they then propagate through the more quiescent region .",
    "when this occurs , typically a small wave train comprised of 2 to 3 upflow / downflow pairs escapes , and as they enter the quiescent regions these convective cells speed up to once again outpace the zonal flow . in the lower convection zone ( @xmath239 ) , the nests propagate more rapidly than the convective cells , and the individual upflows and downflows appear as strong retrograde - directed streaks . also visible in the lower convection zone are low - amplitude velocity structures of rapid retrograde propagation .",
    "they appear to be the weak equatorward extension of the large - scale ( retrograde rotating ) polar patterns evident in figure  [ fig : g5_thermal_structure ] . at mid - convection zone ( @xmath240 ) , nearly all vertical flow is occurring within the nests of active convection , though the strongest cells outside the nest in the upper convection zone manage to weakly print down to this intermediate depth .",
    "the typical angular velocities of the differential rotation , the individual convective cells and the active nests of convection are shown in figure  [ fig : patch_velocity_cartoon ] for case  g5 and detailed for several cases in table  [ table : angular velocities ] .",
    "the nests of convection propagate at a constant angular velocity at all depths in the convection zone and over the entire range of latitudes ( @xmath241 ) where they are present .",
    "in contrast , the angular velocity @xmath137 of the differential rotation varies substantially with radius and latitude . at all depths",
    ", the individual convective cells propagate more rapidly than the zonal flow of differential rotation which they drive . because the nests of convection propagate at an intermediate prograde rate , they experience a head - wind from the differential rotation in the deep convection zone and a tail - wind near the surface . despite this",
    "strong radial shear , the nests remain coherent across the entire convection zone for long periods compared with either the lifetime of individual convective cells ( 10 - 30 days ) , the rotation period of the star ( 5 days ) or typical thermal and viscous diffusion times ( @xmath242 , @xmath243 , both at mid - depth ) .",
    "the time for the differential rotation to lap the nests at the equator is about 112 days near the surface and 143 days at the bottom of the shell .",

    "shown the nest completes almost 3 circuits of the equator relative to the @xmath28 reference frame .",
    "individual convective cells continue to swim through the nest , moving more rapidly near the surface and more slowly in the deep convection zone .",
    "the very strong radial shear prevents all but the strongest of downflows from spanning the full convection zone . in the region outside the nest , convection",
    "is strongly suppressed and the main features are the weak flows associated with the retrograde propagating polar pattern . in the upper convection zone , occasional weak convective disturbances appear upstream of the nest . as these fluctuations enter the nest they grow in amplitude .",
    "our nests of active convection may owe their existence to a competition between the shearing action of differential rotation acting on the individual convective eddies and reynolds stresses within the convection helping to maintain the strong zonal flows . unlike the systems studied by and @xcite , our patchy convection is not accompanied by relaxation oscillation behavior or large exchanges between the kinetic energy in convection and in the differential rotation .",
    "rather , our nests are not bursty in time and instead persist for long periods in quasi - steady states .",
    "this is true even for our most rapidly rotating case considered here ( g10 ) and at much higher turbulent driving ( g5b ) , though these simulations exist at taylor numbers below the threshold suggested by @xcite ( @xmath232 ) .",
    "coupling between equatorially trapped waves and convection may also have a role , but the contribution of this coupling to spatial localization has been difficult to elucidate .",
    "we focus here on the structure of the nests so evident in figures  [ fig : time_longitude_map_turf5_all_3_depths ] and [ fig : time_longitude_map_turf10_2_depths ] for cases  g5 and  g10 , but devote particular attention to the single nest realized in the latter as a representative case .",
    "the active nests extend throughout the depth of the convection zone .",
    "this is illustrated most clearly in figure  [ fig : g10_patch]@xmath194 , showing the vertical profile of radial velocities with longitude in a cut at the equator .",
    "convection is broken into multiple cells , one set above @xmath246 and another below @xmath247 . only within the nest",
    "do strong downflows span the convection zone .",
    "the nest is embedded in a region of strong latitudinal and radial zonal shear ( as shown by the tilted nature of its structure ) , yet the pattern propagates at a constant angular velocity at all depths and latitudes . at the surface and near the equator",
    "the nest propagates more slowly than the zonal wind , whereas at the base of the convection zone it propagates more rapidly .",
    "individual convective structures swim still more rapidly and both enter and exit the region of enhanced convection . as such",
    ", the nest experiences a strong retrograde flow at the base and a strong prograde flow near the surface .",
    "the thermal structure of the nests is revealed by their entropy fluctuations , as shown in figure  [ fig : g10_patch]@xmath248 . in the upper convection zone , the mean zonal flow advects low entropy fluid into the nests from the left side .",
    "this fluid is then swept away by intermittent downflows and replaced by higher entropy fluid from below . in the lower convection zone ,",
    "higher entropy fluid is swept into the nest from the right and lower entropy exits to the left . at mid convection zone",
    ", regions outside the nest remain convectively unstable , but only weak radial motions are driven here .    the mean longitudinal structure of the nests can be assessed by forming temporal averages of various properties in a frame co - rotating with the nests of convection ( these averages denoted by a tilde ) .",
    "this is done at the equator for entropy @xmath249 and convective kinetic energy density @xmath250 ( with same form as cke ) for case  g5 in figure  [ fig : time_longitude_map_turf5_all_3_depths]@xmath251 and for case  g10 in figure  [ fig : time_longitude_map_turf10_2_depths]@xmath159 .",
    "there are distinctive differences between the leading ( to the right ) and trailing ( to the left ) portions of the profiles , with @xmath249 showing a gradual rise and steeper drop in going to decreasing longitudes ( from right to left ) .",
    "the envelope of @xmath249 is largely similar in form at the top and bottom of the convection zone .",
    "in contrast @xmath250 , which traces the fluctuating velocities of convection , changes form with depth , being skewed in the direction of the mean zonal flow . at the top of the convection zone",
    "this sense of skew is toward the right , and at the bottom it is toward the left .",
    "these nests must have gradual circulations associated with them , though these are a challenge to discern as they are much weaker than the strong mean zonal flows .",
    "we can get some sense of them by averaging the vertical and horizontal flows in the surroundings of a nest while tracking it over long time intervals . shown in figure  [ fig : g10_tracked_nest ] are the slow circulations associated with the nest in case  g10 near the top and bottom of the convection zone .",
    "these flows have been averaged over a period of 615  days starting at the beginning of the interval shown in figure  [ fig : time_longitude_map_turf10_2_depths ] .",
    "the flows suggest a systematic zonal circulation from fore to aft in the upper convection zone and toward higher latitudes and diverging from the nest at depth , though to achieve this we have subtracted the fast mean zonal flow which varies with latitude as shown .",
    "the mean upflows and downflows in the nest are quite weak , with amplitudes of a few @xmath180 , as compared with the convection which can have peak velocities of a few hundred @xmath180 .",
    "test particles released in the flow would not simply circulate according to these mean circulations and would be instead swept along by the strong mean zonal flow and of course by the vigorous convection cells that propagate through the nest .",
    "some test particles would encounter strong downflows and would be swept down through the nest to the bottom of the convection zone while others would likely be carried horizontally out the nest and remain at a similar depth . yet",
    "figure  [ fig : g10_tracked_nest ] indicates that a weak large - scale circulation is realized , and this may serve to slowly pump fluid through the system .",
    "these mean circulatory flows may also serve to inform analytic models of such nests of convection .",
    "when stars like our sun are young they rotate much more rapidly than the present sun . in these stars rotation must strongly influence the convective motions and may lead to stronger global - scale dynamo action .",
    "we have explored here the effects of more rapid rotation on global - scale convection in simulations of stars like our sun .",
    "the mean zonal flows of differential rotation become much stronger with more rapid rotation , scaling as @xmath252 or as @xmath253 . in striking contrast",
    ", the meridional circulations become much weaker with more rapid rotation , and the energy contained in them drops approximately as @xmath254 . accompanying the growing differential rotation is a significant latitudinal temperature contrast , with amplitudes of @xmath144 or higher in the most rapidly rotating cases .",
    "the maximum temperature contrast near the surface occurs between the hot poles and the cool mid latitudes at about @xmath255 . if this latitudinal temperature contrast prints through the vigorous convection at the stellar surface , it may appear as an observable latitudinal variation in intensity . the thermal contrast would presumably persist for long periods compared to stellar activity , offering a way to disentangle this intensity signature from that caused by spots of magnetism at the stellar poles",
    ".    these simulations are entirely hydrodynamic and this provides a major caveat to our findings on the scaling of differential rotation and latitudinal temperature contrast with rotation rate @xmath28 .",
    "prior mhd simulations of stellar convection have demonstrated that in some parameter regimes strong dynamo - generated magnetic fields can react back strongly on the differential rotation , acting to lessen angular velocity contrasts or largely eliminate them ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is unclear whether the scaling trends identified here for differential rotation as a function of @xmath28 will survive in the presence of dynamo action and magnetic fields .",
    "likewise , magnetic fields may lessen the strong temperature contrasts realized here , doing so through their feedback on the convective flows and energy transport .",
    "we expect that the weaker meridional circulations may be less affected by magnetic feedbacks , and thus the prediction that meridional circulations lessen in energy and amplitude with more rapid rotation may be of greater significance though harder to confirm observationally .",
    "weaker meridional circulations in more rapidly rotating stars will have a strong impact on many theories of stellar dynamo action , including the babcock - leighton flux - transport model favored for solar - type stars .",
    "we have begun simulations to explore the dynamo action realized at various rotation rates , and its impact upon the flows described here .",
    "preliminary results appear in @xcite and more detailed results will be forthcoming shortly .",
    "a striking feature of these simulations is the emergence of a pattern of strongly modulated convection in the equatorial regions .",
    "these nests of active convection are regions of enhanced convective vigor and transport which propagate at rates distinct from either the mean zonal flows of differential rotation or the individual convective cells . in the most rapidly rotating systems , such as case  g10 , convection at the equator is entirely dominated by motions inside the nest with only very weak radial motions present in the regions outside the nest . though their impact on the convection is most obvious in the rapidly rotating limit , we find some evidence for weak modulation even in our more slowly rotating cases .",
    "all of our simulations stop short of the turbulent stellar surface , and it is thus difficult to estimate how these nests of active convection may affect stellar observations in detail .",
    "the convective velocities associated with the nests are small compared to the nearly supersonic flows in stellar granulation , and in the sun such global - scale convective structures have evaded direct detection despite intensive searches throughout the near - surface layers by helioseismology .",
    "the extremely localized nests found in our most rapidly rotating cases may however influence the thermal stratification and thus convective vigor in the near surface regions , as most of the flux at the equator is transported through a narrow range of longitudes .",
    "these nests may act as traveling hot spots with enhanced convection even in the surface layers where the higher emerging flux escapes the system .",
    "these spatially localized states of convection may also have some bearing on the active longitudes of magnetic activity observed in the sun , if the enhanced pummeling of the tachocline by the convection within the nest preferentially destabilizes magnetic structures within the tachocline that then rise to the surface .",
    "initial dynamo simulations indicate that nests of convection can coexist with magnetism in portions of parameter space .",
    "thus their strongest signature is likely to emerge in magnetic stars , where magnetic fields threading the bulk of the convection zone may be concentrated in the nests and mimic giant , propagating starspots which survive for very long epochs in time .",
    "if the nests lead to active longitudes of enhanced magnetic activity in rapidly rotating stars , we might expect these long - lived magnetic structures to propagate at a rate different from the stellar rotation rate as measured at the surface or from the stellar differential rotation .",
    "we recognize that our simulations remain separated by many orders of magnitude from the parameter space of real stellar convection . as such",
    ", we must be cautious with our interpretations of the overall dynamics .",
    "however , we have found that these nests of convection are a robust feature over a range of parameters and that they are able to persist as entities for as long as we could pursue their modelling . thus one should be prepared to consider the possibility of their presence also in real stellar convection zones , where they may appear as long - lived propagating features .",
