    ", the above identities reduce to rogers ",
    "type identities for the @xmath0 virasoro characters , conjectured by the stony brook group in @xcite . for an introduction to these identities , and further references ,",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite .    in @xcite proofs of the above identities obtained . in this letter",
    ", we present a bijective proof based on the following observation : the lhs of ( [ polyid ] ) is the generating function of certain _ restricted lattice paths _ of finite lengths @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the rhs is the generating function of partitions with prescribed hook differences @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we establish a bijection between these lattice paths and partitions .    the bijection that we obtain is _ so _ simple",
    ", it almost trivializes the identities ( given that we know how to evaluate the generating functions of the combinatoric objects that appear on each side : the lattice paths , and the ferrers graphs , and this is _ not _ a trivial task ) .",
    "we hope that this work will stimulate the search for further bijections that equally simply imply the rest of melzer s and other polynomial identities .",
    "since bijections contain _ detailed _ information about the objects involved , we hope that this and similar proofs help gain better understanding of the full meaning of character identities .    in  2 , we define the lattice paths generated by the rhs of ( [ polyid ] ) , and the partitions generated by the lhs . in  3 , we establish a bijection between these lattice paths and partitions , using certain matrices as interpolating structures . ",
    "4 contains a short discussion .",
    "we define an _ admissible sequence of integers @xmath15 _ as an ordered sequence @xmath16 , with @xmath17 , for all @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and each @xmath20 .    given @xmath15",
    ", we obtain _ an admissible lattice path _ @xmath21 as follows : plot @xmath22 , @xmath23 in @xmath24 , and connect each pair of adjacent vertices @xmath22 and @xmath25 by a straight line - segment .",
    "an example of @xmath26 with @xmath27 is shown in fig .  1 .",
    "for the rest of this work , the term _ path _ will always be used to imply an admissible lattice path in the above sense .      on a path",
    ", we distinguish four different types of vertices :    v1 : :    if @xmath28 , then    @xmath22 is an up - vertex , v2 : :    if @xmath29 , then    @xmath22 is a down - vertex , v3 : :    if @xmath30 , then    @xmath22 is a maximum , v4 : :    if @xmath31 , then    @xmath22 is a minimum .    by definition ,",
    "the end - points @xmath32 and @xmath33 are both minima .",
    "notice that a path consists of a number of sections , each connecting a maximum and an adjacent minimum .",
    "since each path begins and ends on the @xmath34-axis , there is always an even number of such sections , with an equal number of _ ascending _ and _ descending _ sections , as one scans the paths from one end to the other .",
    "the total number of these sections is twice the number of maxima .",
    "furthermore , there is always an equal number of up- and down - vertices , and one more minimum than maximum .",
    "example : in fig .  1 , we find 14 sections , 6 up- and down - vertices , 7 maxima and 8 minima adding up to @xmath35 .      to a path @xmath26",
    "we assign the _ weight _ @xmath36 as half the sum of the @xmath34-coordinates of its up- and down - vertices . for the example of fig .  1",
    ", we obtain the weight @xmath37 . the generating function @xmath38 of our paths",
    "is defined as @xmath39    * theorem @xcite : * for all @xmath40 and @xmath41 we have @xmath42    for proof , we refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "note that the case @xmath43 is trivial , as we have only a single path without any up- or down - vertices , and @xmath44 .      for completeness",
    ", we list a number of standard definitions from the theory of partitions @xcite .    a _ partition _ of @xmath45 is a sequence of integers @xmath46 , with @xmath47 and @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "@xmath49 and @xmath50 are the largest part and the number of parts of the partition , respectively .",
    "example : a partition of @xmath51 is @xmath52 . here , the largest part is 11 , and the number of parts is 8 .",
    "the _ ferrers graph _ corresponding to a partition is obtained by drawing @xmath50 rows of nodes , with the @xmath18-th row containing @xmath53 nodes , counting rows from top to bottom .",
    "the ferrers graph of the above partition of 58 is shown in fig .",
    "the largest square of nodes one can draw in a ferrers graph is called the _ durfee",
    "square_. the dimension @xmath54 of the side of a durfee square is the number of @xmath55 .",
    "the _ length _ of the @xmath18-th row / column of a ferrers graph is the number of nodes of the @xmath18-th column / row , counting columns from left to right .",
    "the length of the @xmath18-th row being @xmath53 , the length of the @xmath18-th column will be denoted @xmath56 .",
    "the @xmath57-th node of a ferrers graph is the node in the @xmath18-th row and @xmath58-th column . the nodes with coordinates @xmath59 form the _",
    "@xmath18-th diagonal_. a quantity that will play an important role is this work is the _ hook difference at node _",
    "@xmath57 , defined as @xmath60    the ferrers graph of the above partition of 58 is shown in fig .",
    "in this same figure , we also show the durfee square and indicate some of the diagonals .",
    "the partitions relevant to ( [ polyid ] ) satisfy two conditions . in the language of ferrers graphs , these are :    f1 : :    the boundary conditions : the number of columns @xmath61 ,    and the number of rows is @xmath62 .",
    "f2 : :    the hook differences : on the zeroth diagonal they satisfy    @xmath63 , on the @xmath64-th diagonal they    satisfy @xmath65 .    for the rest of this work , we use _ partition _ to mean an admissible partition that satisfies the above conditions . for the partition of fig .",
    "2a we have computed the hook differences on the @xmath66 and @xmath67-th diagonal in fig .  2b .",
    "we hence find admissibility for @xmath68 .",
    "the generating function @xmath69 of our partitions is defined as @xmath70 with @xmath71 the number of partitions of @xmath72 .",
    "* theorem @xcite : * for all @xmath40 and @xmath41 we have    b(q ) = _ j=-^ \\ { q^p(p+1)j^2+j -q^p(p+1)j^2+(2p+1)j+1 } , [ b ]    for proof , we refer the reader to @xcite .    as for the generating function @xmath38 of the lattice paths",
    ", we note that for @xmath43 things trivialize .",
    "clearly , from our definition of admissible partitions , for @xmath43 we obtain @xmath73 , as the restrictions on the @xmath74-th diagonal are exclusive .",
    "( the generating function of the partition of @xmath74 is 1 , by definition . ) to observe that expression ( [ b ] ) indeed yields unity one has to invoke the finite analogue of euler s identity @xcite .",
    "since a path is uniquely defined in terms of the ordered sequence of up- and down - vertices that it contains , we can encode it in terms of a matrix whose elements are precisely such a sequence . such a matrix will interpolate between a path and the corresponding partition .",
    "a path @xmath26 can be encoded into a 2by@xmath75 matrix @xmath76 , with @xmath75 the number of maxima of @xmath26 , as follows : @xmath77 is the number of up - vertices between the @xmath18-th minimum and the @xmath18-th maximum , and @xmath78 is the number of down - vertices between the @xmath18-th maximum and the @xmath79-th minimum . here",
    "we count minima and maxima from left to right , @xmath32 being the first minimum .",
    "example : for the path of fig .  1 , we obtain @xmath80 .",
    "the restrictions on the paths translate into restrictions on the interpolating matrices as follows :    1 .   since a path begins and ends on the real axis , the elements of the corresponding matrix satisfy + @xmath81 2 .",
    "since the paths have length @xmath82 , the total number of _ bonds _ on a path is @xmath82 . in any section between a maximum and a minimum , the number of bonds exceeds the number of vertices by one . since the elements of the interpolating matrices are precisely the number of vertices on such sections , they satisfy + @xmath83 3 .   the condition that paths are confined to the strip @xmath84 gives @xmath85    we refer to any 2by@xmath86 matrix of non - negative integer elements which satisfy conditions r1r3 above , as _",
    "admissible_. the point is that one can always use the elements of such a matrix to uniquely construct _ a _ path .",
    "however , the restrictions on the elements of an admissible matrix translate to the restrictions satisfied by a path . for the rest of this work",
    ", the term _ matrix _ will be used to imply an admissible interpolating matrix .      since , as explained above , an admissible interpolating matrix simply encodes the ordered sequences of up- and down - vertices , it can be used to uniquely construct an admissible path , and the map from paths to matrices , as above , is a bijection .      given the matrix @xmath87 corresponding to path @xmath26 , the weight , @xmath36 , of the latter  which was introduced in  2.1can be computed as @xmath88 using restriction r1 on the elements of @xmath87 , and defining the number @xmath54 by @xmath89 we can rewrite ( [ wp ] ) as @xmath90 . \\label{wp2}\\ ] ] this form of the weight function will be useful later . basically , we will translate it directly into a ferrers graph of a partition of @xmath36 .",
    "given an admissible matrix @xmath87 , with a weight @xmath36 given by equation ( [ wp2 ] ) , we construct a ferrers graph of the number @xmath36 as follows :      p1 : :    we translate the term @xmath91 to a rectangle of nodes ,    which has @xmath54 rows and @xmath92 columns .",
    "this    is basically a durfee square , plus an extra column of length    @xmath54 , of some ferrers graph .",
    "let us refer to this as a    _ durfee rectangle_. in the following , we generate the rest of the    graph from the other two terms in ( [ wp ] ) .",
    "p2 : :    the lengths of the @xmath93-th row ( below the durfee    rectangle constructed above ) and the @xmath94-th column    ( to the right of the durfee rectangle ) are given by    @xmath95    we note that p1 and p2 only make sense provided @xmath54 is defined as in ( [ defd ] ) . hence in our construction of partitions we have implicitly used condition r1 on admissible matrices .",
    "this also implies the extra equation @xmath96 needed to invert the transformation from @xmath87 to @xmath36 .",
    "we also note that , from ( 10 ) , @xmath97 in the first equation in ( [ rc ] ) gives the dimension of the side of the durfee square : @xmath54 , which is already constructed in step p1 above .",
    "similarly , @xmath97 in the second equation in ( [ rc ] ) gives the right - most column of the durfee rectangle , which is also already constructed .",
    "the above construction uniquely generates a ferrers graph , which has a durfee rectangle of dimensions @xmath54by@xmath92 .",
    "since the total number of nodes of a ferrers graph is @xmath98 it follows from ( [ wp2 ] ) that ( [ rc ] ) indeed defines a partition of the number @xmath36 .",
    "next , we have to show that the ferrers graph generated , as explained above , are indeed what we are looking for . in other words",
    ", it has to satisfy the conditions f1 and f2 of  2.2 .",
    "first , we consider the conditions r1 and r2 .",
    "setting @xmath99 in ( [ rc ] ) we obtain @xmath100 .",
    "however , from r1 and r2 we get @xmath101 , yielding @xmath102 .",
    "thus , via ( [ rc ] ) , each admissible matrix defines a ferrers graph which has maximally @xmath103 rows and @xmath104 columns .",
    "concluding , restrictions r1 and r2 on the admissible matrices imply the restriction f1 on admissible partitions .",
    "next , restriction r3 , as formulated in equation ( [ iii ] ) , can be translated into conditions on the rows and columns of the ferrers graph as follows : @xmath105 for all @xmath106 .",
    "the length of the @xmath18-th row ( column ) @xmath107 is @xmath108 ( @xmath109 ) with @xmath110 ( @xmath111 ) the smallest integer such that @xmath112 ( @xmath113 ) , which implies @xmath114 ( @xmath115 ) .",
    "we thus find that the hook differences on the @xmath74-th diagonal are @xmath63 , and on the @xmath64-th diagonal are @xmath65 .",
    "we have therefore mapped admissible matrices on ferrers graphs of admissible partitions .",
    "the above map is invertible since the dimensions of the building blocks of an admissible ferrers graphs , namely the durfee square , and the rows and columns adjacent to it , can be translated to elements of an admissible matrix using the same equations as above .",
    "finally , we need to show that the restrictions on the admissible ferrers graphs translate correctly to the restrictions on admissible matrices .",
    "m1 : :    restriction r1 is trivially satisfied m2 : :    restriction r2 can always be satisfied , since it basically amounts to    adding extra columns with zero entries to the matrix until    @xmath116 is satisfied m3 : :    restriction r3 is satisfied given that we start from an admissible    partition .",
    "this completes our bijection between paths and partitions . as a consequence of that , the corresponding generating functions  as obtained in @xcite  are equal , which implies ( [ polyid ] ) .    before concluding we note the following simple graphical way to construct the ferrers graph of an admissible partition from an admissible matrix .    *",
    "draw a partition of @xmath117 rows , @xmath118 , @xmath119 , @xmath120 . *",
    "multiply the @xmath18-th row @xmath121 times and the @xmath18-th column @xmath122 times , @xmath123 .    carrying out both steps result in the admissible partition .",
    "for the partition of fig .  2 this",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "we thus find that the path of fig .",
    "1 corresponds to the partition of fig .  2 .",
    "the reverse of this statement is true provided @xmath124 .",
    "in this letter , we established a bijection between a class of restricted lattice paths and a class of partitions with prescribed hook differences . as a result of this , we obtain a bijective proof a melzer s polynomial identities related to the virasoro characters @xmath0 .",
    "we restricted ourselves to lattice paths confined to @xmath84 , starting in @xmath32 and ending in @xmath33 .",
    "we expect that a generalization of the above bijection exists , such that one can map lattice paths starting confined to this same strip , but starting in @xmath125 and ending in @xmath126 , to partitions with hook differences on the @xmath127-th diagonal @xmath128 and on the @xmath129-th diagonal @xmath130 .",
    "if so , this would amount to a bijective method of proof for all polynomial @xmath131 character identities @xcite ."
