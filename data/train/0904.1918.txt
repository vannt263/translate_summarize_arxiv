    "[ fig : cc - pi0p ] comes from @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",

    "this explains the smaller coupled - channels effect compared with the photoproduction reactions  @xcite .",
    "the decreasing non - resonant interaction at higher @xmath81 is due to its long range nature , thus indicating that higher @xmath81 reactions provide a clearer probe of @xmath104 .",
    "we obtain similar results also for @xmath69 .",
    "it is noted , however , that the above argument does not mean coupled - channels effect is negligible in the full @xmath88 reaction process . in the above analysis we kept the coupled - channels effect on the hadronic non - resonant amplitudes , the strong @xmath104 vertices , and the @xmath104 self - energy , which are @xmath81-independent and remain important irrespective of @xmath81 .",
