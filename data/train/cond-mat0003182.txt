    "for many materials , the density functional theory ( dft)@xcite in the local - spin - density approximation ( lsda)@xcite provides a good description of their ground - state properties .",
    "however , problems arise when the dft - lsda approach is applied to materials with ions that contain incomplete @xmath4- or @xmath5-shells , such as transition - metal oxides or heavy fermion systems . for example , most transition - metal oxides are wide - gap antiferromagnetic insulators,@xcite and the dft - lsda predicts them to be either metals ( feo and coo ) or small - gap semiconductors ( mno and nio).@xcite the failure of the dft - lsda can be traced to the mean - field character of the kohn - sham equations as well as to the poor description of strong correlation effects within the homogeneous electron gas .",
    "the strong correlation effects are responsible for the breakdown of the dft - lsda description of the electronic structure of these compounds . in order to provide a better description of these effects ,",
    "the mott - hubbard picture has been introduced.@xcite    in the mott - hubbard picture of nio , the @xmath4-@xmath4 coulomb interaction splits the ni @xmath4 sub - bands into the so - called lower and upper hubbard bands .",
    "the upper hubbard band has mostly ni @xmath6 character , while the top of the valence band is of @xmath7 character , leading to a mott - hubbard gap of @xmath4-@xmath4 type .",
    "however , o @xmath8 x - ray absorption@xcite as well as x - ray photoemission and bremsstrahlung isochromat spectroscopies@xcite on li@xmath9ni@xmath10o have shown that the additional hole has mainly oxygen character .",
    "in contrast to the mott - hubbard model , the energy band gap caused by the ni @xmath11 correlations is therefore of the charge - transfer type between the occupied oxygen @xmath3 and the ni @xmath11 empty states .    on the other hand , localized approaches , @xcite such as the local cluster scheme based on the configuration interaction method or the anderson impurity model , in which transition - metal ions are treated like an impurity in an oxygen @xmath3 host ,",
    "predict a well - defined band gap of 5.0 ev .",
    "however , the oxygen @xmath3 band dispersion observed in angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy@xcite can not be described by these methods because the lattice effects are neglected .",
    "several attempts have been made to include the missing correlation effects in dft - lsda .",
    "the generalized gradient approximation ( gga),@xcite which takes into account the radial and angular gradient corrections , can only open a small band gap.@xcite the self - interaction correction ( sic)@xcite eliminates the spurious interaction of an electron with itself from the conventional dft - lsda method . compared to lsda , the band gap and the magnetic moments are significantly increased . however , the band gap still is too small , and the sic - lsda method predicts a larger energy band gap for nio than for feo and coo , in contradiction to experiment.@xcite the crystal - field orbital polarization introduced by norman @xcite to determine the magnetism and insulating band gap of transition - metal oxides is promising but underestimates both the spin magnetic moment and the band gap",
    ".    another promising approach for correlated materials is the so - called local density approximation ( lda ) plus the multi - orbital mean - field hubbard model ( lda+u)@xcite which includes the on - site coulomb interaction in the lsda hamiltonian . after adding the on - site coulomb interaction to the lsda hamiltonian , the potential becomes spin- _ and _ orbital - dependent .",
    "because a larger energy cost is associated with fluctuations of the @xmath4-occupancy , the orbital - dependent potential reduces the fluctuations of the @xmath4-occupancy , resulting in a better justification of a mean - field approach .",
    "lda+u , although it is a mean - field approach , has the advantage of describing both the chemical bonding and the electron - electron interaction .",
    "the question regarding the best value for the coulomb repulsion parameter @xmath0 is , however , still under debate .",
    "the @xmath0 parameter for nio obtained from a constrained lda calculation is about 7 to 8 ev , and this is the value generally used in lda+u calculations .",
    "a similar value of @xmath0 has been obtained from a constrained lda calculation for bulk fe,@xcite even though a much smaller value had been expected because of the metallic screening in fe .",
    "the authors argued@xcite that the higher value could be an artifact due to the poor screening within the atomic sphere approximation ( asa ) , and that within a full - potential calculation a much smaller value of less than 4 ev would be expected .",
    "in contrast , an unpublished full - potential linear muffin - tin orbital method calculation by alouani and wills@xcite clearly shows that the value of @xmath0 for bulk fe is even slightly larger than the asa value .",
    "furthermore , bulut , scalapino , and white@xcite showed that the renormalization of the coulomb interaction depends on the type of model used .",
    "as lda is not a diagrammatic method , it is not known which type of renormalization is the most appropriate for the lda+u model .    in this work we shed light on this problem by treating the coulomb repulsion parameter @xmath0 as adjustable parameter , and by investigating how the electronic and optical properties depend on its value .",
    "we show that for an intermediate value of @xmath12 ev , good agreement with the measured ground - state antiferromagnetic magnetic moment and optical properties is obtained .",
    "we also show that the o @xmath3 character near the top of the valence states is enhanced for a larger value of @xmath0 .",
    "our calculation seems to indicate that the nature of the band gap at intermediate @xmath0 is a mixture of charge transfer and mott - hubbard type , and that it becomes almost purely of the charge - transfer type for higher values of @xmath0 .",
    "our calculations are based on the projector augmented wave ( paw ) method,@xcite an efficient all - electron method without shape approximations on the potential or electron density to avoid uncertainties due to the asa approach .",
    "based on a car - parrinello - like formalism,@xcite the paw method allows complex relaxations and dynamical properties in strongly correlated systems to be studied .",
    "our implementation of lda+u within the paw method is described in detail .",
    "furthermore we discuss possible extensions of the existing method that will enhance its applicability .",
    "the paper is organized as follows :  in section [ sec : two ] we present those aspects of the paw formalism that are needed for the implementation of the lda+u method . in section [ sec : three ] we present and discuss the lsda and lda+u ground - state properties of nio , and in section [ sec : four ] we study the optical properties of nio , namely the imaginary part of the dielectric function , and compare the results to experiment .",
    "the paw method developed by one of us @xcite combines ideas of the pseudo - potential ( pp ) and the linear augmented plane wave ( lapw ) methods .",
    "it is applicable to all elements of the periodic table .",
    "the nodal behavior of the wave function is correctly described and , as in the pp method , the forces on the ions are easily expressed .    in the paw method ,",
    "the all - electron ( ae ) crystal wave function is constructed from a pseudo ( ps ) wave function and atom - like functions localized near the nuclei .",
    "the ps wave function @xmath13 coincides with the crystal ae wave function @xmath14 in the interstitial region , i.e.  outside the atomic regions . inside the atomic regions",
    "@xmath15 , called augmentation regions , the wave function is almost atom - like because the effect of the surrounding crystal is small .",
    "therefore , a natural choice is to use solutions @xmath16 of schrdinger s equation for the isolated atom , the so - called ae partial waves , as a basis set for the augmentation region . here",
    "@xmath17 is a global index for the atom @xmath18 , the angular momentum @xmath19 , the magnetic quantum number @xmath20 , and the index @xmath21 , the energy for which schrdinger s equation is solved .    to link the expansion in atom - like functions near the nuclei to the ps wave function",
    ", we introduce a set of auxiliary functions @xmath22 , so - called ps partial waves , which are centered on the atom and coincide per construction with the corresponding ae partial waves @xmath16 outside their augmentation regions : @xmath23    the coefficients @xmath24 of the expansions in ae and ps partial waves are chosen such that the ps partial wave expansion latexmath:[$\\sum_\\lambda    @xmath13 inside the augmentation region . for this purpose",
    "we introduce so - called projector functions @xmath26 such that @xmath27 and therefore @xmath28 for the hilbert space spanned by the ps partial waves @xmath22 .",
    "thus we identify the expansion coefficients with @xmath29 . equation ( [ eq : pawident ] ) results in the biorthogonality condition @xmath30 for the projector functions , which moreover are chosen to be localized within the corresponding augmentation region .    with these conditions",

    "( @xmath35 ) .",
    "the third term eliminates the spurious contribution of the ps wave function in the augmentation region .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ eq : psexpand ] ) holds only approximately if the set of ps partial waves is not entirely within the augmentation regions .",
    "however , this has the advantage that only those contributions of the ps wave function will be removed that are also replaced by ae partial waves . as a result",
    ", the ae wave function converges rapidly with the number of partial waves used and , moreover , it is continuous and differentiable for every truncation of the partial - wave expansion .",
    "expectation values of any sufficiently local operator @xmath36 are obtained as @xmath37 note that the double sum is diagonal in the site indices @xmath38 .",
    "this equation is exact for a complete set of ps partial waves and rapidly attains the converged result if incomplete .",
    "the paw method provides the freedom to represent a zero operator in the form @xmath39 by any operator @xmath40 entirely localized within the augmentation region .",
    "equation ( [ eq : pawzero ] ) has the same range of validity as eq.([eq : pawoperator ] ) does and allows a further acceleration of the convergence by using a well - chosen operator @xmath40 and adding the corresponding zero operator to the expression for the expectation value .      for transition - metal oxides ,",
    "the @xmath4-orbitals are well localized and keep a strong atom - like character .",
    "even though lda provides a good approximation for the average coulomb energy of the @xmath4-@xmath4 interactions , it fails to describe correctly the strong coulomb and exchange interaction between electrons in the same @xmath4-shell .",
    "the main intention of lda+u is to identify these atomic orbitals and to describe their electronic interactions as strongly correlated states .",
    "the other orbitals are delocalized and considered to be properly described by the lda .",
    "the procedure is to eliminate the averaged lda energy contribution of these atom - like orbitals from the lda total energy functional @xmath41 , and to add an orbital- and spin - dependent correction .",
    "the total energy within the lda+u method then has the form @xmath42 \\ , , \\label{eq : etot}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 is the average occupation of the @xmath4-shell for each spin direction as obtained from the @xmath4-orbital occupancies @xmath44 .",

    "the expressions @xmath46 are the four - center matrix elements of the screened coulomb interaction @xmath47 .",
    "an additional requirement of the lda+u approach is that the additional energy is applied only to the valence electrons , which are re - optimized while constrained to remain orthogonal to the core states .",
    "the rationale behind the definition of the orbital occupations is to project the density matrix onto one consisting of a restricted set of localized orbitals @xmath48 , where each orbital index @xmath49 stands for an angular momentum and @xmath18 for an atomic site .",

    "here we choose the projection operators acting on the ni @xmath4-orbitals in analogy to previous implementations@xcite as @xmath54 where the site index @xmath18 refers to a particular ni site , and @xmath55 is the spherical harmonic centered at site @xmath18 .",

    "the localized orbitals @xmath64 have been chosen to be identical to those of the spheridized , non - spin - polarized atoms .",
    "we used an atom in the @xmath65 configuration of ni .",
    "for such a localized ni @xmath4-orbital @xmath64 with magnetic quantum number @xmath20 , we obtain @xmath66 independent of @xmath20 and @xmath18 .",
    "thus we obtain the orbital occupations @xmath67 from the minimal condition for @xmath68 , which in this case are independent of the weights @xmath69 .    in the paw method",
    "we obtain the orbital occupations directly from the ps wave functions @xmath70 as @xmath71 using the pseudo - version @xmath72 of the projection operator @xmath73 .",
    "consistent with the paw formalism , the small correction @xmath74 .",
    "the construction is analogous that of the projector functions in the paw method , but the purpose is different : namely , the goal is to decompose a wave function into local orbitals such that @xmath75 holds for any wave function @xmath14 that can be represented exactly as a superposition of the local orbitals @xmath76 .",
    "this requirement is fulfilled whenever @xmath77 .",
    "the projector functions can be obtained from a set of functions @xmath78 , which are linearly independent and localized within an augmentation region as @xmath79 after multiplication with the inverse of @xmath80 .",
    "if we now use @xmath81 we obtain the matrix elements in the representation of localized orbitals directly as @xmath82 it is now a simple matter to obtain the corresponding pseudo - projection operator @xmath83    this expression has a number of advantages :  ( i ) it is the most general expression because any operator can be expressed in a fully separable expression,@xcite and , unlike eq .",
    "( [ eq : projector ] ) , it is not limited to a semi - local form .",
    "( ii ) the step function in eq.([eq : projector ] ) introduces a potential that is discontinuous , whereas the operator suggested here can be constructed such that the resulting potential is continuous and differentiable , while still being fully localized in a well - defined region .",
    "( iii ) the separable form of the operator renders the evaluation numerically convenient .",
    "in particular , it is conceivable to evaluate @xmath84 explicitly if necessary , whereas the corresponding operation using the semi - local projection operator would be computationally prohibitive .",
    "( iv ) we can systematically construct projection operators that specifically act on a well - defined portion of the hilbert space : by enlarging the set of functions @xmath85 to include also orbitals that should _ not _ be represented in the restricted set , they are excluded by simply setting the corresponding matrix elements of the density matrix @xmath86 to zero .",

    "usually , they are obtained from a constrained dft calculation.@xcite here , we are interested in how sensitively the results depend on the choice of coulomb parameters , and which coulomb parameters will provide the best agreement with reality as probed by optical absorption . therefore , we adopt the general form for the four - center integrals as function of the @xmath0 and @xmath45 suggested by the arguments provided above , and perform calculations for different @xmath0 values , namely @xmath107 ev@xmath108 and @xmath109 ev@xmath108 . in the following we suppose that @xmath110 . because the results are fairly insensitive to the exchange parameter @xmath45 , we have adopted @xmath111 ev@xmath108 from previous constrained lda calculations.@xcite the third mandatory relation is obtained from the work of degroot et al.,@xcite who determined the ratio @xmath112 for transition - metal oxides to be between 0.62 and 0.63 .",

    "next , the hubbard correction is added to the lsda hamiltonian as given by eq.([eq_h_ldapu ] ) , and the new hamiltonian iterated until the occupation numbers @xmath122 have converged .",
    "we did not use the so - called second - variation procedure for self - consistent lda+u,@xcite in which the lsda potential is updated , because it failed to yield any improvement on calculations similar to ours.@xcite",
    "the ground state of nio has been calculated using the paw method , and the density of states ( dos ) is calculated from the self - consistent paw potential using the tetrahedron method for the brillouin - zone integration.@xcite figure [ lsda_dos ] presents the atom - resolved dos in the augmentation region .",
    "as can be seen , lsda produced an antiferromagnetic insulating ground state with a small band gap .",
    "the lsda magnetic moment is 0.95 @xmath123 , and mainly due to the ni@xmath124 band splitting .",
    "this value is much smaller than the experimental value ( 1.641.90 @xmath123 , refs .  ) .",
    "the calculated band gap of about 0.1 ev is also much smaller than the experimental one ( 3.04.0 ev ) .",
    "the most interesting feature of our lsda dos is that the @xmath4-states of ni dominate the region in the vicinity of the band gap , and that the top of the valence state is of ni@xmath124 type for the first and ni@xmath125 for the second spin .",
    "this electronic structure suggests that the band gap is of mott - hubbard type .",
    "hence , this lsda picture of nio disagrees completely with experiment .",
    "it is surprising that the quasi - particle calculation within the so - called gw approximation , performed by aryasetiawan and gunnarsson,@xcite produced results qualitatively similar to lsda except for an increased band gap of 6 ev and an increased magnetic moment of 1.6 @xmath123 .",
    "the quantitative change is the reduction of the o @xmath3 bandwidth by almost 1 ev .",
    "however , a recent self - consistent model gw calculation by massida _ et al._,@xcite in which the dynamic effects were neglected , produced other results than those of aryasetiawan and gunnarsson.@xcite it was argued by massida _",
    "_ that the results of the former gw calculation are not quite self - consistent , presumably because of the additional non - local ad - hoc potential that is adjusted to the gw calculation in each self - consistent step .",
    "the main difference between the two reported gw model calculations is that the latter calculation@xcite produced ( i ) a spreading of the ni @xmath4-states over the entire valence bandwidth , ( ii ) a vanishing gap between the o @xmath3 and ni @xmath11 and , most importantly , ( iii ) an enhancement of o @xmath3 states at the valence band maximum .",
    "the latter effect attributes the origin of the band gap mainly to a charge transfer gap because this gap is now between the o @xmath3 and ni 3@xmath4 conduction states .",
    "next , we will show that this latter finding is in agreement with the results of the lda+u model .",
    "we have used our implementation of the lda+u model to determine the ground - state electronic structure of nio .",
    "although it is common practice to use the @xmath0 extracted from a constrained lda calculation , we adopt a different point of view here .",
    "as stated in the introduction and in agreement with recent results reported in the literature,@xcite we believe that the value of @xmath0 extracted from constrained lda is not the best possible choice .",
    "therefore we have determined the electronic structure of nio for an intermediate @xmath0 of 5 ev as well as for a larger value of 8 ev .",
