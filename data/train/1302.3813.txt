    "the automorphism group of an algebraic curve defined of a field @xmath4 is always an algebraic group , of dimension at most @xmath5 , the biggest possible group being @xmath6 .",
    "the situation is very different starting from dimension @xmath7 even for complete or projective surfaces @xmath0 : of course some groups such as @xmath8 are still algebraic groups but in general @xmath2 only exists as a group scheme locally of finite type over @xmath4 @xcite and it may fail for instance to be algebraic group in the usual sense because it has ( countably ) infinitely many connected components .",
    "this happens for example for the automorphism group of the blow - up @xmath9 of the base - points of a general pencil of two cubics , which contains a finite index group isomorphic to @xmath10 , acting on the pencil by translations .",
    "note however that the existence of @xmath2 as a group scheme implies at least that @xmath0 has a largest connected algebraic group of automorphisms : the identity component of @xmath2 equipped with its reduced structure .",
    "the picture tends to be much more complicated for non complete surfaces , in particular affine ones .",
    "for instance the group @xmath11 of the affine plane @xmath12)$ ] contains algebraic groups of any dimension hence is very far from being algebraic .",
    "in fact , the subgroups @xmath13,\\,\\deg p\\leq n\\right\\ } \\simeq\\mathbb{g}_{a , k}^{n+1}\\ ] ] of unipotent triangular automorphisms of degree at most @xmath14 form an increasing family of connected subgroups of automorphism of @xmath15 in the sense of @xcite so that @xmath11 does not admit any largest connected algebraic group of automorphisms . it is interesting to observe however that , as a consequence of jung s theorem @xcite , @xmath11 is generated by a countable family of connected algebraic subgroups , namely @xmath16 and the above triangular subgroups @xmath17 , @xmath18 .",
    "a similar phenomenon turns out to hold for other classical families of rational affine surfaces with large groups of automorphisms : for instance for the smooth affine quadric in @xmath19 with equation @xmath20 and more generally for all normal affine surfaces defined by an equation of the from @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a non constant polynomial , whose automorphism groups have been described explicitly first by makar - limanov @xcite by purely algebraic methods and more recently by the authors @xcite in terms of the birational geometry of suitable projective models .",
    "all examples above share the common property that the normal subgroup @xmath23 generated by all algebraic subgroups of @xmath2 is in fact generated by a countable family of such subgroups and that the quotient @xmath24 is countable .",
    "so one may wonder if such a property holds in general for quasi - projective surfaces .",
    "it turns out that there exists normal affine surfaces which have a much bigger group of automorphisms and the purpose of this article is to describe explicitly one family of such surfaces .",
    "our main result can be summarized as follows :    [ mainthm ] let @xmath4 be an uncountable field and let @xmath25 $ ] be polynomials having at least @xmath7 distinct roots in an algebraic closure @xmath26 ok @xmath4 and such that @xmath27 .",
    "then for the affine surface @xmath0 in @xmath28)$ ] defined by the system of equations @xmath29 the following holds :    \\1 ) the normal subgroup @xmath23 is not generated by a countable union of algebraic groups ,    \\2 ) the quotient @xmath24 contains a free group over an uncountable set of generators .",
    "note that that the surfaces described in theorem  [ mainthm ] can be chosen to be either singular or smooth , depending on the multiplicity of the roots of @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "the result is obtained from a systematic use of the methods developed in @xcite for the study of affine surfaces admitting many @xmath32-fibrations . by virtue of pioneering work of gizatullin @xcite ,",
    "the latter essentially coincide with surfaces admitting normal projective completions @xmath33 for which the boundary divisor is a so - called zigzag , that is , a chain @xmath34 of smooth proper rational curves supported in the smooth locus of @xmath33 .",
    "these have been extensively studied by gizatullin and danilov @xcite during the seventies and more recently by the authors in @xcite .",
    "an important invariant of a zigzag is the sequence of self - intersections of its components , called its type , which in our context can be chosen to be of the form @xmath35 , where the @xmath36 are a possibly empty sequence of integers . in this setting , the simplest possible",
    "zigzag has type @xmath37 and the corresponding affine surface is the affine plane @xmath38 viewed as the complement in the hirzebruch surface @xmath39 of the union of a fiber of @xmath40 , with self - intersection @xmath41 , and the exceptional section of @xmath40 with self - intersection @xmath42 .",
    "the next family in terms of the number of irreducible components in the boundary zigzag @xmath34 consists of types @xmath43 , @xmath44 .",
    "these correspond to the normal hypersurfaces of @xmath45 defined by equations of the form @xmath21 with @xmath46 which were studied in detail in @xcite .",
    "the present article is in fact devoted to the study of the next family , that is , affine surfaces corresponding to zigzags of types @xmath47 , where @xmath48 .",
    "the surfaces displayed in theorem  [ mainthm ] provide explicit realisations of general members of this family as subvarieties of @xmath49 , but we describe more generally isomorphism classes and automorphism groups of all surfaces in the family .    from this point view , theorem  [ mainthm ] above says that a relatively minor increasing of the complexity of the boundary zigzag has very important consequences on the geometry and the automorphism group of the inner affine surface .",
    "the next cases , that is zigzags of type @xmath35 with @xmath50 , could be studied in exactly the same way as we do here ; the amount of work needed would just be bigger and more technical .",
    "+ the article is organized as follows : in the first section we review the main techniques introduced in @xcite to study normal affine surfaces completable by a zigzag in terms of the birational geometry of suitable projective models of them , called standard pairs .",
    "we also characterize the nature of algebraic subgroups of their automorphism groups in this framework ( proposition [ prop : alggroups ] ) .",

    ", we apply these intermediate results to obtain a the structure of their automorphism groups and of their @xmath52-fibrations .",
