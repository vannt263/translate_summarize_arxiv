    "physics of nuclei located far from the @xmath4 stability line has been one of the main current subjects of nuclear physics .",
    "one of the unique properties of drip - line nuclei is that the fermi level lies close to zero .",
    "understanding of single - particle levels in the continuum is essential in describing the nuclear structure close to , and beyond , the drip line , since the shell structure of both bound and continuum levels plays an important role in many - body correlations such as deformation and pairing .",
    "it has been argued recently that , as the binding energy approaches zero , the @xmath5-wave component of a bound single - particle wave function behaves uniquely in a deformed potential , and plays a dominant role in nilsson levels with @xmath6@xcite .",
    "naively , resonant levels can be considered as an extension of bound states into the positive energy regime .",
    "therefore , if the @xmath5-wave component keeps dominant in the continuum , the level with @xmath6 might not exist as a physical state .",
    "notice that , for a nilsson hamiltonian@xcite , single - particle levels with @xmath7 belonging to high-@xmath8 orbit comes down in energy in a prolately deformed potential .",
    "these states play an important role in generating the deformed shell structure .",
    "it is therefore crucially important to investigate the role of low-@xmath9 component in a deformed wave function for @xmath7 states and its transition from bound to resonant levels .",
    "the structure of deformed single - particle levels in the continuum has been investigated in a few publications . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "the resonance energy of negative parity states was studied by employing the gamow wave function .",
    "the analytic continuation in the coupling constant ( accc ) method was applied to study single - particle resonance states in spherical and deformed nuclei  @xcite . using the multi - channel scattering approach , ref .",
    "@xcite has studied how the single - particle energies change from bound to resonant levels when the depth of the potential is varied . in order to fully understand the structure of deformed single - particle levels in the continuum ,",
    "however , a detailed study of the wave function components is still necessary , in addition to the resonance energy itself .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the structure of deformed wave functions around zero energy using the gamow state representation for a resonant state . to this end",
    ", we use a schematic model : a @xmath10 deformed finite square - well potential without spin - orbit force .",
    "this enables us to determine the single - particle wave function analytically . to use the gamow state for resonance",
    "has a certain advantage in analyzing the deformed wave function .",
    "that is , we are able to treat the bound and the resonant levels on the same footing , because the gamow states are normalizable just like the bound states @xcite .",
    "it is then straightforward to see how the fraction of each component in the deformed wave functions changes when the single - particle level changes its character from bound to resonant .",
    "a slight disadvantage of this approach is that the expectation value with the gamow states , including the probability of wave function components , becomes complex numbers . however ,",
    "this is not a big defect for our purpose , since the physical quantity of the expectation values can be obtained by taking their real part@xcite .",

    "\\label{eq : sch2}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ]    for the positive energy solution , @xmath18 , we impose the boundary condition corresponding to the gamow state for resonance .",
    "that is , the wave function is regular at the origin and satisfies the out - going boundary condition @xmath19 asymptotically .",
    "this boundary condition is satisfied only if the energy is complex , @xmath20 , where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the resonance energy and the width , respectively . in the case for @xmath23 and @xmath24 ,",
    "the gamow state wave function is equivalent to the bound state wave function , which satisfies the decaying asymptotics @xmath25 , where @xmath26 .",
    "the solutions of the coupled - channels equations ( [ eq : sch2 ] ) therefore read ( we omit the subscript @xmath1 for simplicity of notation ) , @xmath27 where @xmath28 , and @xmath29 are the spherical bessel and hankel functions , respectively .",

    "the bound state wave function is normalized as @xmath36 where @xmath37 the gamow state wave function can be also normalized by introducing the regularization factor as zeldovich proposed@xcite @xmath38 using a property of the spherical bessel function@xcite , one can evaluate the first term as @xmath39 the second term can be also evaluated using the contour integral method or equivalently the complex scaling method ( csm ) .",

    "the correspondence between the potential depth and the real part of the energy is shown in fig.[energy2 ] .",
    "we observe that the width is quite large even for a small values of positive energy .",
    "this large width is caused by the admixture of the @xmath3 component in the wave function .",
    "indeed , as shown in fig.[energy_fit ] , in the small positive energy region ( 0.1 mev @xmath44 1.0 mev ) , the behavior of the width is consistent with the relation expected for the @xmath5-wave resonance state @xcite , @xmath45 where @xmath46 denotes the real part of @xmath47 .",
    "below @xmath480.1 mev , the width is larger than the solid line , which predicts @xmath49 at @xmath50 .",
    "also , we did not find a physical solution between @xmath43= 41.62 and 41.68 mev , as is shown in the inset of fig.[energy2 ] .",

    "@xcite for a spherical square - well potential ( see fig.1 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) . above 1.0 mev also ,",
    "the width is larger than that expected by eq.([mcvoy ] ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that the relation eq.([mcvoy ] ) is valid only for small values of @xmath51  @xcite .    in fig.[energy2 ]",
    ", we see that the slope of the single - particle energy as a function of the potential depth , @xmath52 , or equivalently @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the mass number , becomes smaller in approaching the zero binding energy . for a spherical square - well potential",
    ", it has been shown that @xmath55 for @xmath3 in the limit of zero binding  @xcite .",
    "this is due to the fact that the @xmath5-wave function can be easily extended outside the nuclear potential and also the kinetic energy is reduced due to the absence of the centrifugal barrier  @xcite .",
    "this property implies that the @xmath3 component becomes dominant in a deformed wave function around the zero - binding region . on the other hand",
    ", the slope has a finite value in the positive energy region even in the limit of zero energy , thus the slope has a discontinuity around zero energy .",
    "therefore , a care must be taken , as discussed in ref .",

    "we now discuss the energy dependence of the fraction of the multipole components in the deformed wave function .",
    "figure [ real_component ] shows the real part of the fraction for each multipole component in the gamow state wave function with @xmath0 . when the binding energy approaches zero , the @xmath5-wave component in the deformed wave function becomes dominant .",
    "in contrast , in the positive energy region , all the multipole components have a finite value even in the zero energy limit and show similarity with the well bound cases . as we will discuss in the next section ( see fig.[nilsson ] below ) , the state shown in fig.[real_component ] originates from the @xmath64 orbit in the spherical limit .",
    "this states couples with the lower - lying @xmath65 , @xmath66 and the higher - lying @xmath67 states .",
    "the dominant component is @xmath62 both in well bound and in resonant levels , as one sees in fig.[real_component ] .",
    "this suggests that both the well bound and the resonant levels have a similar property to each other and the intuitive picture that the resonant level is an extension of a bound level into the continuum is valid .    only at the limit of zero binding",
    ", the singular behavior of the @xmath3 component appears .",
    "this is entirely due to the property of the normalization integral , eq.([normalization ] ) . since the gamow state wave function is equivalent to the bound state wave function for @xmath68 , eq.([normalization ] )",
    "holds both for the resonance and the bound states . for small values of @xmath51 , eq.([normalization ] ) is proportional to @xmath69 as discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , that diverges only for @xmath3 as @xmath70 0 .",
    "when the total wave function @xmath71 is normalized according to eq.([normtot ] ) , then only the @xmath5-wave component is allowed in the wave function @xcite .",
    "this condition is always met for the bound state when the binding energy approaches the threshold . in principle",
    ", the same consideration can apply also to the resonance state when the resonance energy approaches zero from the positive energy side .",
    "however , as we show in fig.[energy ] , the resonance state acquires a relatively large width even when the real part of the energy is infinitesimally small .",
    "since @xmath51 is defined as @xmath72 , it remains a constant even if @xmath73 itself approaches zero .",

    "single - particle energies are connected smoothly when changing the potential depth , and the width increases gradually in the small positive energy region .",
    "figure [ real_component_0- ] shows the fraction of each multipole component in the gamow state wave function .",

    "especially , the levels of @xmath7 ( @xmath79 ) with ( without ) spin - orbit force belonging to high-@xmath8 ( high-@xmath9 ) orbit in the spherical limit play an important role in nuclear deformation .",
