    "they found that the itinerant ferromagnetism is strongly suppressed by the local distortions of the oxygen around the cobalt . with optimized geometries , they identified a phase transition from wide - band ferromagnetic to narrow band paramagnetic metals with @xmath7 increasing .",
    "by carefully examining the doped electron density , marianetti _ _ et al.__@xcite found that the rigid band model is not suitable for this na doped system . a rehybridization driven by a competition between the on - site coulomb interaction and the @xmath14-oxygen hybridization",

    "they found that the parameter @xmath3 is critical to charge and spin orderings ( for small supercell , the so called charge disproportionation always leads to charge ordering ) .",
    "they suggested that the phase diagram of na@xmath6coo@xmath1 is characterized by a crossover from effective single - band character with @xmath20 for @xmath21 into a three - band regime for @xmath22 , where @xmath23 and correlation effects are substantially reduced .",

    "a novel sodium ion ordered insulating state at @xmath24 was found@xcite , with the most strongly developed superstructure@xcite .",
    "this insulating state separates two kinds of metallic phase , _",
    "i.e. _ curie - weiss metal for @xmath21 and paramagnetic metal for @xmath22 .",
    "it is suggested that the occurence of the insulating state indicates a strong interaction between the ions and holes even though they occupy separate layers , and a charge ordering is thought to accompany the sodium ion ordering@xcite .",
    "therefore it is interesting to compare the electronic structure based on this experimental sodium ion ordered structure with previous theoretical results to identify the effect of na ordering .",
    "for example , it will be interesting to see if the na ordering will produce a co charge ordering at dft level . on the other hand , the correlation effects of na@xmath0coo@xmath1",
    "is considered to be a betweenness comparing to small values for @xmath21 and relatively large values for @xmath22@xcite , which demands a study at the dft+u level to identify the effect of correlation .",
    "unfortunately , there is no theoretical work in the literature for this important @xmath24 case with both na ordering and correlation effects being properly considered . in this paper , we report the electronic structure of na@xmath0coo@xmath1 focusing on the possibility of charge ordering and based on the experimental superstructure at both dft and dft+u level .",
    "the calculations in this work were performed with the vienna _ ab initio _ simulation package ( vasp)@xcite , which is a first - principles plane - wave code , treating the exchange and correlation in the dft scheme . in this study ,",
    "the perdew - wang functional form@xcite of generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) was used . for spin - polarized calculations , the spin interpolation of vosko _ _ et al.__@xcite was also adopted .",

    "the plane wave kinetic energy cutoff was fixed to 500 ev .",

    "functional depends only on the difference of hubbard parameter @xmath3 and screened exchange parameter @xmath27 , @xmath27 was fixed to 1 ev during all dft+u calculations .",

    "a @xmath25 superstructure of na@xmath0coo@xmath1 has been found by powder neutron diffraction experiment@xcite .",
    "this superstructure has the @xmath28 space group symmetry , with a cell formula : na@xmath29co@xmath30o@xmath31 . in this experimental structure model ,",
    "the na1 and na2 sites ( @xmath32 and @xmath33 wyckoff sites for original @xmath34 space group , and @xmath32 and @xmath35 sites for this @xmath28 space group respectively ) are equally occupied , and the ordered na ions form one - dimensional zigzag chains .",
    "two types of co ions ( @xmath36 and @xmath37 ) , which differ subtly in their coordination by oxygen , are also in chains .",
    "the existence of two kinds of co sites allows the emergence of two inequivalent co ions , namely co@xmath10 and co@xmath4 , in the process of self - consistency .",
    "therefore this structure model can be used to study the possibility of charge ordering .",
    "the geometry optimization , starting from the experimental structure , reaches its convergence until all forces vanished within 0.01 ev /  . the optimized geometry is shown in fig .",
    "[ geometry ] . during the optimization ,",
    "the cell parameters are fixed to the experimental values ( @xmath38 , b=5.630 , and @xmath39 ) , which results in only a neglectable stress less than 20 kb .",
    "as listed in table [ tbl : geo ] , relaxations of atomic positions from the experimental ones are also found to be very small .",
    "the largest relaxation comes from the first two na atoms along @xmath7 direction ( 0.06  ) , typical relaxations are about 0.01@xmath400.02 .",
    "the calculated two kinds of co - o distances ( 1.91  and 1.88  ) are very similar to experimental values ( 1.90  and 1.86  ) . in an ideal structure model of na@xmath6coo@xmath1 , co and o may form layers of edge - shared coo@xmath41 octahedra in a triangular lattice , but distortion of the octahedra with the variation of the o hight @xmath42 from its ideal value is always exists in real system .",
    "our optimized @xmath42 varies from 0.0845 @xmath43 to 0.0892 @xmath43 for different o sites , resulting in the co - o - co angles varying from 96.2@xmath44 to 97.0@xmath44 . comparing to the 90@xmath44 angle in the undistorted octahedra",
    ", the optimized structure shows a considerable distortion of the oxygen octahedra . for @xmath45 supercell , we get a slightly smaller distortion , but ni _ _ et al.__@xcite get a significantly larger one .",
    "we notice that they have used a relatively small kinetic energy cutoff in their study .",
    "we can clearly identify three well separated manifolds in the paramagnetic gga band structure and dos of na@xmath0coo@xmath1 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ ggaband ] .",
    "the lowest in energy is the o @xmath46 bands , with a bandwidth about 5.5 ev ( only part of them are shown in the figure ) .",
    "the other two manifolds come from the co @xmath2 orbitals , which are splitted into a lower lying @xmath47 manifold and an upper lying @xmath14 manifold , separated by approximately 2.5 ev according to the oxygen octahedral crystal field .",
    "although these three manifolds are well separated in energy , the hybridizations of o @xmath46 states with both the @xmath47 and @xmath14 states are notable .",
    "the fermi energy locates at the upper edge of the @xmath47 manifold , indicating a metallic gga ground state .",
    "the low energy properties of na@xmath0coo@xmath1 will be determined by the @xmath47 manifold , which has a bandwidth of 1.6 ev .",
    "the trigonal symmetry of the co sites further splits the @xmath47 states into one with @xmath48 symmetry and a doubly degenerate @xmath49 pair . in fig .",
    "[ ggaband ] , we also plot the @xmath50 ( co @xmath51 ) partial dos . as found by lee _ _",
    "et al.__@xcite , the @xmath50 states have a bandwidth almost identical to that of the whole @xmath47 manifold , which indicates that the widely used single - band model may not be sufficient enough to describe the gga electronic structure of this material .",
    "fermi surface often plays an important role in the electronic structure of materials .",
    "our gga fermi surfaces for the five bands across fermi level are shown in fig .",
    "[ fs ] , which are obtained by a @xmath52 bz sampling and viewed by xcrysden package@xcite .",
    "lda / gga band structure is expected to give valuable and accurate information about the fermi surface even in system with strong correlations@xcite . in our supercell structure , there will be band folding from the first bz of the original hexagonal lattice ( black hexagon in the fig .",
    "[ fs]a ) , and the fermi surface thus becomes very complex .",
    "we notice that , on the other hand , the band structure of the superstructure geometry is far from simply band folding , for example , the fermi surface of the fourth band ( band 99 ) shows a prominent 3d character , which has not been reported in previous virtual crystal study@xcite . according to the complexity of the present fermi surfaces , nesting effect for na@xmath0coo@xmath1 may not be very strong , and we thus do nt expect to find corresponding spin density wave ( sdw ) state .",
    "spin - polarized calculations are carried out in order to address the possibility of magnetic ordering . when the ordering is constrained to be ferromagnetic ( fm ) ,",
    "a stable low spin solution is obtained , with magnetic moments of 0.4 and 0.45 @xmath5 for co1 and co2 respectively .",
    "but the corresponding energy gain from ferromagnetic instability is only 26 mev / co .",
    "the moment values are somewhat smaller than that ( 0.5 @xmath5 ) reported by singh@xcite under virtual crystal approximation , which may due to the difference between their structural model and ours . in our structure , the triangular symmetry is slightly broken .",
    "antiferromagnetic ( afm ) ordering is frustrated on the 2d triangular lattice .",
    "but if the magnetic moments on a sublattice vanish , the left other sublattice may geometrically permit the presence of afm ordering .",
    "here we get an afm model ( afm1 ) by fixing the magnetic moments at co1 sites to be zero . as shown in fig .",
    "[ geometry ] , the co2 sites form a 1d chain in the @xmath7-@xmath53 plane , and it is easy to establish afm ordering within this chain . in a unit cell , the two afm chains are set to be out of phase .",
    "the afm1 model results in a magnetic moments of co2 ions about 0.39 @xmath5 , which is much larger the result ( 0.21 @xmath5 ) for the singh s afm model@xcite .",
    "we notice that in that model each co ion has also two nearest neighbors of like spin in addition to four of opposite spin .",
    "another afm model ( afm2 ) is constructed by alter the direction of magnetic moments of neighboring fm co layers .",
    "although the interlayer exchange interaction is expected to be small , we get lower energy for afm2 state than that of fm state .    until now",
    ", we get a metallic ground state with intra - layer fm ordering and inter - layer afm ordering . comparing with the results of singh@xcite",
    ", we may conclude that na ordering alone will not qualitatively affect the gga electronic structure to generate the band gap and charge ordering observed in experiments .",
    "for the afm1 state , where charge ordering is enforced , the magnetic energy ( 7 mev / co ) is much smaller than those of afm2 and fm states , which indicates the enforced charge ordering under gga level is unfavorable in energy .",
    "this result is consistent with the calculations for na@xmath54coo@xmath1 , where attempts using lda to obtain self - consistent afm spin ordering always converge to the fm or nonmagnetic solution@xcite .",
    "this discrepancy between theory and experimental observation naturally leads to a further consideration of correlation effect .",
    "dft+u@xcite is a kind of method aiming to deal with the on - site coulomb interaction within the framework of dft .",
    "it treats the local electrons in a hartree - fock manner , which drives local orbital occupations to integral occupancy as @xmath3 increases . for transition metal oxide",
    ", one may find a larger split of @xmath55 orbitals for larger @xmath3 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ dosfm]-[dosafm2 ] , where partial dos of cobalt @xmath2 orbitals and oxygen @xmath46 orbitals are plotted for fm , afm1 and afm2 states respectively . the cobalt @xmath2 partial dos for co1 and co2 sites are separated .",
    "we do not present the results for spin restricted paramagnetic states in this section , because the energy differences between these states and corresponding magnetic states increase rapidly with @xmath3 ( 0.4 ev / co for @xmath56 ev ) .",
    "the paramagnetic states are still metallic even with @xmath3 as large as 7.0 ev .    in fig .",
    "[ dosfm ] , the top panel is the gga result , and the three below panels represent three typical electronic structure behaviors for different @xmath3 values . for small @xmath3 ( see panel b ) , the electronic structure is similar to the above gga one , except for a strong trend towards gap opening and charge ordering . as shown in fig .",
    "[ moment ] , the moments on the two inequivalent co sites are nearly equal and also similar to the gga values ( which is the @xmath57 limit ) until @xmath583 ev . above @xmath59 , the unoccupied part of the @xmath48 states weight more and more for co2 states with the increase of @xmath3 .",
    "disproportionation from co@xmath60 into @xmath61 co@xmath4 and @xmath62 co@xmath10 ions is nearly complete at @xmath63 ev and is accompanied by a metal insulator ( mott - like ) transition from conducting to insulating .",
    "this insulating phase results from the splitting of the @xmath48 states , which lead to an unoccupied narrow band containing one hole for each co2 ions and an occupied band on the co1 ion , as shown in fig .",
    "[ dosfm]c .",
    "we judge the formation of charge ordering from local magnetic moments instead of from charge population directly , because the charge difference between co1 and co2 are relatively small ( only 0.1@xmath400.2 electron ) .",
    "this is a result of the hybridization of the o @xmath46 and co @xmath2 orbitals .",
    "in fact , oxygen may directly contribute to the charge ordering in some oxides , as suggested by coey@xcite .",
    "we also notice that the charge ordering and gap opening with a moderate @xmath3 is far from obvious , since zou _ _ et al.__@xcite have gotten a metallic ground state with a relatively large coulomb @xmath3 ( 5 ev ) but without adopting any supercell structure .",
    "therefore the sodium ion ordering is critical to the insulating ground state .",
    "there is no clear boundary for moderate and large values of @xmath3 , but a relatively large @xmath3 value will feature several characters as shown in fig .",
    "[ dosfm]d .",
    "first , the empty @xmath48 band are pushed further higher , which make it strongly mix with the upper @xmath14 bands . secondly , the large splitting of the co @xmath2 orbitals even squeeze some co2 @xmath2 states to the bottom of the o @xmath46 manifold , and consequently the o @xmath46 character at the edge of valence band near fermi energy has exceeded the co @xmath2 characters .",
    "thirdly , the magnetic moments of cobalt are exceed 1 @xmath5 in this region ( up to 1.42 @xmath5 per co for @xmath56 ev ) , which seems curious at first sight .",
    "we now give two possible rationalizations for this observation .",
    "one interpretation comes from the population analysis process .",
    "we notice that oxygen is also spin polarized in our calculations for large @xmath3 , which makes the net magnetic moment of the whole supercell is still about 1.0 @xmath5 per co. therefore the nominal magnetic moment being larger than 1 @xmath5 per co may be just an artifact of paw population analysis as a result of the strong hybridization between co and o. another possibility is that the large on - site coulomb interaction may really promote a transition from low spin state to a intermediate spin state as demonstrated by korotin _",
    "et al._@xcite for co ions in vertex sharing coo@xmath41 octahedra .",
    "this type of transition is consistent with the strong mixing of empty @xmath48 and @xmath14 bands .",
    "the evolution of electronic structures with @xmath3 for afm states is generally similar to that for fm state .",
    "the most significant difference is that the charge ordering occurs well before gap opening for afm1 state . as shown in fig .",
    "[ moment ] , the co@xmath4 moment grows immediately for afm1 state as @xmath3 increases from 1 ev , but the gap opens until @xmath64 ev , which is different from the results of lee _ _ et al.__@xcite for na@xmath6coo@xmath1 with @xmath18 and @xmath19 .    the energy difference between the fm and afm phases as a function of @xmath3 is plotted in fig .",
    "[ moment]c .",
    "the general trend gives lower energy afm state for small @xmath3 and lower energy fm state for large @xmath3 , except the relatively higher afm1 energy for small @xmath3 , which is caused by the artificial charge ordering as previously discussed .",
    "for large @xmath3 , the lower energy of fm state is a natural result of the weakening of superexchange effect , and it is also consistent with the prominent dos of the majority spin component at deep energy as shown in fig .",
    "[ dosfm]d .",
    "the energy difference between fm and afm2 is generally small according to the relatively small exchange interaction between different layers . according to our result",
    ", the magnitude of on - site coulomb interaction @xmath3 in this material can be probed by experimental magnetic measurement .    from fig .",
    "[ dosfm]-[dosafm2 ] , we can find an interesting splitting and ordering of the @xmath14 orbitals . with the increase of @xmath3 ,",
    "the lower part of the @xmath14 orbitals becomes mainly from co1 sites and the upper part from co2 sites .",
    "we notice that this kind of orbital ordering of unoccupied @xmath14 orbitals will not affect the low energy properties of na@xmath0coo@xmath1 . although it has been found in lacoo@xmath65@xcite , orbital ordering of valence band orbitals is not very possible in this structure , since they are not doubly degenerated .",
    "a rehybridization process is proposed to describe the competition between the on - site coulomb interaction and the @xmath14-oxygen hybridization in doped coo layers@xcite .",
    "this process can be seen clearly from the partial dos of o @xmath46 orbitals as shown in fig .",
    "[ dosfm]-[dosafm2 ] . at gga level ,",
    "hybridization of oxygen @xmath46 states and @xmath14 states are more significant than the @xmath47-oxygen hybridization . with the increase of @xmath3 ,",
    "the on - site coulomb interaction becomes stronger , which can be minimized by unmixing the oxygen and @xmath14 orbitals in order to decrease the occupation of the @xmath14 orbitals . in fig .",
    "[ dosfm]-[dosafm2 ] , we can clearly see this kind of unmixing by the decrease of oxygen @xmath46 partial dos in the @xmath14 manifold . for large value of @xmath3 ,",
    "the hybridization of oxygen @xmath46 states and @xmath47 states is somewhat enhanced , which is not included in the modified hubbard model study by marianetti _ _",
    "et al.__@xcite .",
    "we have studied the effect of hubbard @xmath3 on the electronic structures of na@xmath0coo@xmath1 in the previous part of this section , but the actual value of @xmath3 in this material is not determined yet , of which very different values are proposed in the literature@xcite .",
    "based on the folowing two experimental observes , we estimate that the vaule of @xmath3 should be moderate , as also suggested by lee _ _ et al.__@xcite .",
    "first , the insulating ground state suggests that the value of @xmath3 should not be too small .",
    "secondly , na@xmath6coo@xmath1 with @xmath7 away from 0.5 is always metallic indicates a narrow energy gap for na@xmath0coo@xmath1 , which prefer a not too large value of @xmath3 .",
    "since there was experimental report@xcite on electron mass enhancement for small @xmath7 of na@xmath6coo@xmath1 , people have compared the experimental electronic specific heat coefficient @xmath66 with the band value to estimate the strength of correlation@xcite .",
    "but in the na@xmath0coo@xmath1 case , where hubbard type correlation drives system to a mott insulator , @xmath66 will reduced by the correlation effects .",
    "in fact , the experimental @xmath66 is only 3 mj / mol - k@xmath67,@xcite which is much smaller than our gga band value ( 10.5 mj / mol - k@xmath67 ) , but very near to the dft+u value ( zero ) .    at a plausible value of @xmath3 , 4",
    "ev for example , intralayer afm coupling is favored over fm and interlayer afm coupling ( ref fig .",
    "[ moment]c ) .",
    "we notice that the magnetic state in na@xmath6coo@xmath1 is far from being clearly determined in experiments .",
    "there are some experiments supporting afm coupling@xcite , while there are also some recent experiments supporting fm coupling@xcite . with this intermediate value of @xmath3 ,",
    "the ground state ( afm1 ) magnetic moment for co2 is 1.0 @xmath5 , and the magnetic energy is 0.123 ev / co .",
    "based on dft+u method , we have studied the effects of na ordering and on - site coulomb correlation on the geometrical , electronic and magnetic properties of na@xmath0coo@xmath1 . without including on - site coulomb interaction @xmath3 ,",
    "the experimental insulating phase can not be produced by dft . for small value of @xmath3 ,",
    "ground state is still metallic . at this time , no charge ordering occur for fm coupling , and symmetry enforced charge ordering for intralayer afm coupling is unfavorable in energy . increasing parameter @xmath3 to a moderate value can open an energy gap and form charge ordering for both fm and afm states .",
    "large @xmath3 value will largely split the co @xmath2 orbitals , which leads to squeezing co @xmath2 states to the bottom of o @xmath46 manifold , mixing of empty @xmath48 and @xmath14 states , and large co magnetic moments .",
    "accompanying with the early work on na@xmath6coo@xmath1 ( @xmath18 and @xmath19)@xcite , our study will shed some insights into understanding of the complex interplay of na content , superstructure , correlation effects and tendency of various type of ordering in na@xmath6coo@xmath1 .",
    "however , a complete understanding on this issue , for example , why the @xmath19 case with stronger commensurability effect and maybe also stronger correlation is not a charge ordered insulator in experiment , will need much further work .",

    "<S> we report a first - principles projector augmented wave ( paw ) study on na@xmath0coo@xmath1 . with the sodium ion ordered insulating phase being identified in experiments , </S>",
    "<S> pure density functional calculations fail to predict an insulating ground state , which indicates that na ordering alone can not produce accompanying co charge ordering , if additional correlation is not properly considered . at this level of theory , </S>",
    "<S> the most stable phase presents ferromagnetic ordering within the coo@xmath1 layer and antiferromagnetic coupling between these layers . </S>",
    "<S> when the on - site coulomb interaction for co @xmath2 orbitals is included by an additional hubbard parameter @xmath3 , charge ordered insulating ground state can be obtained . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of on - site interaction magnitude on electronic structure is studied . at a moderate value of @xmath3 ( 4.0 ev for example ) , </S>",
    "<S> the ground state is antiferromagnetic , with a co@xmath4 magnetic moment about 1.0 @xmath5 and a magnetic energy of 0.12 ev / co . </S>",
    "<S> the rehybridization process is also studied in the dft+u point of view . </S>"
