    "this aspect was the center of several experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite studies .",
    "these investigations , so far , were mostly confined to the simplest case of spin - one condensates . on the other hand ,",
    "the wealth and intricacy of spinor condensates increases dramatically with increasing spins .",
    "for instance , the phase diagram of spin - two and spin - three condensates consists of four , and ten possible mean - field phases , respectively @xcite .",
    "a feature which makes these systems even more interesting , is that the ground states exhibit a high degree of symmetry in its spin state , which is isomorphic to lattice point groups @xcite . in this paper",

    "[ ] , we expressed hydrodynamic equations of motion using the density , superfluid velocity , and the spin - nodes as our basic degrees of freedom .",
    "in addition to the euler equations , which describe mass , momentum , and energy conservation , we obtained @xmath0 landau - lifshitz equations for the dynamics of the spin - nodes .",
    "furthermore , our derivation gave a natural generalization of the mermin - ho relation which connects the vorticity in a ferromagnetic spinor condensate with the pontryagin index of the order parameter .",
    "we were able to give explicit expressions for all dynamical quantities for spin - half and spin - one condensates .",
    "however , we found that the full expressions become progressively more complicated with increasing spin , and become impractical for large @xmath1 .    in this paper , we study the dynamics of spinor condensates for general values of @xmath1 , by looking at the low energy properties of the equations of motion obtained in ref . .",

    ", we derive the linearized equations of motion for the spin - node locations , which allows us to extract the small oscillation spectrum from symmetry alone , in a fashion resembling the vibrational - mode calculation for polyatomic molecules @xcite . using this method we are able to give simple expressions for the vibration eigenmodes and energy spectrum .",
    "in addition , we derive a correspondence between the low lying excitations of the spinor - condensates , and atomic orbitals subject to rotational symmetry due to crystal - fields , which reflect the symmetry of the spinor - condensate ground state .    the paper is organized as follows .",

    "there is an ambiguity in the definition of @xmath9 and @xmath10 corresponding to the gauge choice in the definition of @xmath4 .",
    "gauge invariant quantities can be expressed in terms of @xmath8 only , without reference to @xmath9 and @xmath10 .    in ref .",

    "( [ eq : llgen ] ) provides a natural starting point in the analysis of the linearized equations of motion which will be developed in the following section .",
    "as suggested from the equations of motion of the spin - one and higher condensates in ref .  , the geometric representation of the equations of motion yield rather complicated results .",
    "nevertheless , this formalism regains its appeal when linearized about particular mean - field ground states",
    ". then the hidden point symmetries of the ground state become apparent , and can be used to describe the linearized dynamics of a condensate . below we derive the small oscillation description of general spinor condensates .",
    "parting ways from the attempt at a general description of spinor condensate dynamics , we now turn to the vicinity of a uniform mean - field ground state . for the ensuing discussion , we will denote quantities to be evaluated in the mean - field ground state with overhead bars .",
    "for instance , the density can be written by expanding about the mean - field state as @xmath48 we will first concentrate on the equations describing the density excitations . to linearize the equations of motion , derived in sec .",
    "[ sec : genf ] , we can drop terms which involve derivatives acting on two different quantities .",
    "doing so leads to the following two equations describing the density fluctuations : @xmath49 and @xmath50 note that terms describing the spin degrees of freedom ( e.g. , the effective electric and magnetic fields ) have completely dropped out of these equations from linearization .",
    "computing the excitations from these equations is straightforward and gives the familiar bogoliubov mode describing density fluctuations .",
    "let us now focus our attention on linearizing the landau - lifshitz equations for general spin written in eq .",
    "( [ eq : llgen ] ) . since the process of linearization separates the equations for spin and density fluctuations , to simplify the notation in what follows , we will scale the density of the uniform state to one , @xmath51 . when linearized , the landau - lifshitz equations for general spin become @xmath52 in the above , as before , we have used overhead bars to denote quantities evaluated at their mean - field configuration .    to understand the dynamics of eq .",
    "( [ eq : llgen2 ] ) it is useful to introduce variables to describe small deviations of the spin nodes from their mean - field values . to this end , by using the identities established in sec .",
    "[ sec : spinnodes ] , we introduce the set of @xmath0 complex variables @xmath53 @xmath54 where @xmath55 . note that in the mean - field states we have @xmath56 for each spin node since the vectors @xmath57 and @xmath58 are orthogonal .",
    "this set of variables can be seen to be the local stereographic projection of @xmath38 onto the complex plane for small displacements , and will be very useful in the following analysis .",
    "moreover , in our gauge convention , @xmath59 is given in terms of displacements along the zenith and azimuthal directions from the spherical coordinate system : @xmath60 using these variables , the linearized landau - lifshitz equations become @xmath61    the kinetic pieces in the gp equations are most naturally described in terms of the original spinor wave function , @xmath62 , and are not simplified by the symmetry of the mean - field ground states .",
    "nevertheless , eq . ( [ eq : linz ] ) demonstrates that near mean - field ground states the kinetic terms still acquire a simple form .",
    "interestingly , the kinetic parts in the spin equations of motion , ( [ eq : linz ] ) , do not disclose the fact that the variables @xmath63 describe spin - half components of a spin-@xmath1 state .",
    "this fact is reflected only in the spin interaction term . in the following section",
    ", we will see that this spin interaction can be expressed in terms of a derivative with respect to the @xmath64 variables .",
    "in particular , the equations of motion will be shown to be @xmath65 where @xmath66 thus , the spin interaction derives from a sum over `` torques , '' _ j= v_int .",
    "an essential element in the behavior of spinor condensates is the spin interaction term @xmath67 .",
    "it is the minimization of this term that yields the mean - field ground states , and its curvature that determines the normal excitations .",
    "these curvatures can be easily and directly extracted in terms of specific matrix elements , as we show below .    to expand the spin interaction energy about a mean - field ground state ( denoted with an overhead bar ) we first need to understand how to perturb a spinor about a fixed value .",

    "( [ eq : linz2 ] ) . in general , derivatives with respect to @xmath76 will act on bras while derivatives with respect to @xmath59 will act on kets .",
    "we will now establish the equivalence between eqns .",
    "( [ eq : linz ] ) and ( [ eq : linz2 ] ) . one can use eq .",
    "( [ eq : dpro ] ) to evaluate the derivative of the interaction energy @xmath77 which is correct to linear order .",

    "( [ eq : linz2 ] ) @xmath81 which is the last term in eq .",

    "since we are interested in small oscillations about equilibrium , we would like to express the interaction energy expanded about the mean - field state to quadratic order in the @xmath73 variables .",

    "we then readily obtain the following quadratic form for the spin interaction energy ( dropping the @xmath85 term ) : @xmath86 here @xmath87 is the projection operator which only acts on states denoted with subscripts 1 or 2 respectively . while the form above is written symmetrically , following eq .",

    ". furthermore , these matrix elements obey the point symmetry of the ground state at hand , and thus have stringent constraints .",
    "( [ eq : v2 ] ) therefore provides us with direct expressions for the matrix elements appearing in the linear spin - wave expansion of the spinor condensate .",

    "is cumbersome because each involves a wick expansion of @xmath96 terms . on the other hand",
    "the expression for @xmath79 given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ainv ] ) is readily computed since it involves evaluating overlaps between spin - coherent states .",
    "thus , in practice , to construct the matrix @xmath47 it is easiest to first construct @xmath79 and then compute its inverse .",
    "proceeding along very similar lines as above , one can expand @xmath97 to second order in the @xmath73 s .",
    "one finds @xmath98 finally , we note that the term involving the superfluid velocity @xmath99 in the lagrangian will not contribute to the linearized equations of motion .",
    "we are now in a position to vary the lagrangian eq .",
    "( [ eq : lag ] ) as a function of the @xmath73 s to find the linearized equations of motion .",
    "these read @xmath100 ( repeated indices are summed over ) .",
    "it is straightforward to see that this is the same as eq .",
    "( [ eq : linz2 ] ) which was obtained directly from linearizing the gpe contracted with time - reversed coherent states .",
    "since @xmath47 is a hermitian matrix , it is diagonalized by a unitary transformation @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the diagonal matrix consisting of the eigenvalues of @xmath47 .",
    "it is therefore convenient to define a new set of @xmath103-coordinates as @xmath104 note that in terms of these coordinates , the berry s phase assumes a simple diagonal form @xmath105 furthermore , the equations of motion have the simple form in these coordinates : @xmath106 this has the form of a time - dependent schrodinger equation for the @xmath107 parameters .",
    "the most appealing application of the linearized equations of motion developed in the previous section is to obtain the normal excitation modes and energies of spinor condensates having a hidden ground state symmetry . as we show , it is nearly sufficient to diagonalize the matrix @xmath47 [ defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ainv ] ) ] in order to obtain the eigenmodes of the spinor - condensate .",

    "next , in sec .",
    "[ sec : hexagon ] , we demonstrate how from the point group of the hidden symmetry of the mean - field ground states , we can compute the normal modes alone ( but not energies ) , using the example of the spin - three state where the spin - nodes are arranged at the vertices of a hexagon . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : ylm ] , we show how to directly construct the vibrational and rotational eigenmodes from spherical harmonics , by connecting the problem at hand to that of degeneracy lifting of electronic atomic orbitals .",
    "this method circumvents the arduous group - theory foot work , by using the well - known properties of atomic orbitals under crystal fields that break rotational invariance .",
    "the general motivation of the discussion below is that group theory analysis can be applied to obtain the normal modes in spinor condensates much like the analysis of the vibrational frequencies of polyatomic molecules @xcite .",
    "the `` atoms '' ( or spin nodes ) in our case , however , are confined to the surface of the unit sphere , and the displacement of each spin node is a two - dimensional vector ( parameterized by the real and imaginary parts of the @xmath73 variables ) . the first step in a symmetry analysis is to construct the transformation rules of the 2-@xmath108 displacement vectors under point group symmetries .",
    "these transformation rules are a reducible representation of the symmetry group , and can then be broken down into its irreducible representations ( irreps ) .",
    "the modes that transform according to the irreps are the eigenmodes of the system .    before we begin the analysis ,",
    "a note on mode multiplicity is in order .",
    "naively , one might expect that the procedure in the previous paragraph will give @xmath109 normal modes due to the two basis vectors per spin node .",
    "this situation would arise if the transformations we construct transform the @xmath110 _ real _ coordinates , and are therefore 4f large _ real _ reducible representations of the symmetry group , resulting in 4f modes .",
    "while this is the case for real atoms , where the displacement vectors are also associated with conjugate momenta , the spin - nodes displacements do not have independent conjugate momenta . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : lag ] ) and ( [ eq : bpe ] ) we see that the complex displacement @xmath59 is actually canonically conjugate to @xmath111 : the two - dimensional displacements are both the coordinate and conjugate momenta , and hence there are only @xmath0 eigenmodes in a spinor condensate .",
    "qualitatively , this is a situation reminiscent of a massless particle in a magnetic field , where the @xmath112 and @xmath113 coordinates are canonically conjugate coordinate and momentum . indeed , constructing real 4f dimensional representations of the symmetry would result in two duplicates of the spinor - condensate s eigenmodes .",
    "this duplicity will become evident when the eigenmodes are written in terms of the complex @xmath59 s : half the normal modes will differ from the other half through a complex multiplicative coefficient .      as our first example , we consider the cyclic state which is a possible mean - field ground state having the symmetry of a tetrahedron for the spin - two problem .",
