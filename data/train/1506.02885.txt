    "the ly@xmath0  emission line is a key tool in discovering and studying high redshift galaxies , and a good probe for reionization .",
    "high redshift ly@xmath0  emission line galaxies ( lae ) have been found routinely for almost two decades ( e.g. dey et al .",

    "2012 ; matthee et al .",
    "these high redshift laes are generally small , young star forming galaxies .",
    "they have compact size , low stellar mass , low dust extinction , low metallicity , and high specific star formation rate ( ssfr ) ( e.g. malhotra 2012 ; bond et al .",
    "2010 ; gawiser et al . 2007 ;",
    "pirzkal et al .",
    "2007 ; finkelstein et al . 2008 ; pentericci et al . 2009 ) . at @xmath2 ,",
    "these laes are an important population of star - forming galaxies , and they constitute an increasing fraction of lyman break galaxies across that range , reaching @xmath360% of lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) at redshift z@xmath36 ( stark et al .",
    "2011 ) . at @xmath4 , the ly@xmath0  luminosity , ly@xmath0  equivalent width ( ew ) , and spatial clustering of laes and lbgs are used to probe reionization of the intergalactic medium ( e.g. malhotra & rhoads 2004 ; ouchi et al .",

    ", we should ideally understand how ly@xmath0  escapes from galaxies ( e.g. dijkstra et al .",
    "2014 ) . in star - forming galaxies ,",
    "ly@xmath0  photons come from the recombination of gas surrounding hot young o and b stars .",
    "because ly@xmath0  is resonantly scattered , the path length and dust extinction of ly@xmath0  photons is increased in a manner that depends on the kinematics of the gas .",
    "this process also determines the characteristic profile of ly@xmath0  lines .",
    "only a fraction of the intrinsic ly@xmath0  photons can escape the galaxy and be observed . the emergent ly@xmath0  emission depends on the amount of dust , the hi gas column density ( @xmath5 ) , the velocity distribution of hi gas , and the geometric distribution of hi gas and dust ( e.g. neufeld 1990 ; charlot & fall 1993 ; ahn et al .",
    "2001 ; verhamme et al . 2006 ; dijkstra et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "since the scattering of ly@xmath0  photons can significantly modify the ly@xmath0  profile , studying ly@xmath0  profiles is an important way to understand ly@xmath0  escape .",
    "emission line in laes usually shows an asymmetric or a double - peaked profile ( e.g. rhoads et al 2003 ; kashikawa et al . 2011 ; erb et al . 2014 ) .",
    "for laes with detected optical emission lines and systemic redshifts , the peaks of ly@xmath0  profiles are usually redshifted with respect to systemic velocities ( mclinden et al .",
    "2011 , 2014 ; chonis et al . 2013",
    "; hashimoto et al . 2013 ; song et al . 2014 ; shibuya et al . 2014 ; erb et al . 2014 ) .",
    "the velocity offset of ly@xmath0  emission line from systemic velocity is usually smaller in laes than in continuum selected galaxies with weaker ly@xmath0  emission lines or ly@xmath0  absorption ( shapley et al .",
    "2003 ) .    to understand ly@xmath0  profile , the single shell outflow model is popular for its simplicity and ability to capture several essential features of ly@xmath0  lines . in a galaxy with spherical hi gas outflow ,",
    "ly@xmath0  photons backscattered from the far side of the receding shell will acquire a frequency shift that allows them to pass through other gas in the galaxy , including the near side of the shell .",
    "many studies simulate the ly@xmath0  radiative transfer process assuming a single such shell ( e.g. ahn et al .",
    "2001 ; verhamme et al .",
    "2006 ; dijkstra et al .",
    "2006 ; schaerer et al .",
    "2011 ; gronke et al .",
    "the output ly@xmath0",
    "profile depends on the hi column density of the gas shell , the velocity of the shell , the dust optical depth , and the temperature of the hi gas in the shell .",
    "the models can reproduce the observed ly@xmath0  profile and infer properties such as @xmath5 and outflow velocity of the hi shell . in these models ,",
    "the ly@xmath0  velocity offset is formed from scattering of ly@xmath0  photons by gas outflows , and increasing @xmath5 or outflow velocity will usually result in larger ly@xmath0  velocity offset .    to get a better understanding of ly@xmath0  escape , we need to observe high quality ly@xmath0  profiles , and determine systemic redshifts , gas outflows , the hi gas distribution / kinematics , and many other galactic properties of laes . at high",
    "redshift , however , absorption by the intergalactic ly@xmath0  forest prevents reliable measurements of the blue portion of ly@xmath0  emission lines .",
    "other crucial observations are also impractical , both because high-@xmath6 laes are faint , and because some features ( notably rest - optical emission lines ) are redshifted to @xmath7 , where presently available instruments lack sensitivity .",
    "therefore many studies seek to solve the ly@xmath0  escape problem in the nearby universe by observing galaxies with similar properties to high - z laes ( e.g. giavalisco et al .",

    ". however , these samples of nearby ly@xmath0  emission line galaxies have on average much smaller ly@xmath0  equivalent widths and ly@xmath0  escape fractions ( 1%-12% in wofford et al .",

    "2014 ) than do high - z lae samples ( > 17% zheng et al . 2012",

    "the main exception is the present green pea galaxy sample .",
    "green pea galaxies were discovered in the citizen science project galaxy zoo , in which public volunteers morphologically classified millions of galaxies from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) .",
    "these are compact galaxies that are unresolved in sdss images .",
    "the green color is because the [ oiii ] doublet dominates the flux of sdss @xmath8-band which is mapped to the green channel in the sdss s false - color _ gri_-band images .",
    "they have redshifts @xmath9 , small stellar masses @xmath10 , low metallicities , high specific star formation rates ( ssfr ) , and emission line equivalent widths ( ew(h@xmath0 ) and ew([oiii]@xmath15007 ) exceeding hundreds of   ( cardamone et al .",
    "2009 ; izotov et al .",
    "thus green peas are good counterparts to high - redshift laes in size , morphology , stellar mass , metallicities , and optical emission line strengths .",
    "this suggested that green peas might also show strong ly@xmath0  emission lines .    in this paper",
    ", we use archival hst ly@xmath0  spectroscopy of green peas to show that green peas are the best analogs of high - z laes in local universe . with high quality ly@xmath0  spectra and rest - frame optical spectra ,",
    "green peas provide a good opportunity to study ly@xmath0  escape .",
    "we explore relations of ly@xmath0  escape to ly@xmath0  profiles and to galactic properties , compare the ly@xmath0  profiles with radiative transfer models , and discuss constrains on hi gas and ly@xmath0  escape .",
    "while the full sdss data set contains a few tens of thousands of green peas candidates based on photometric selection , they are not in a category systematically targeted for spectroscopic followup . in sdss dr7 , a sample of about 251 green peas were observed as serendipitous spectroscopic targets ( cardamone et al .",
    "which green peas were thus targeted was essentially a random process , depending where the sdss fibers were undersubscribed by other objects of all types .",
    "thus , we do not expect this step of the selection to introduce any important bias in the sample .",
    "a subset of these objects have sufficient signal to noise ratio ( s / n ) in both continuum and emission lines ( h@xmath0 , h@xmath11 , and [ oiii]@xmath15007 ) to study galactic properties such as sfr , stellar mass , and metallicity .",
    "galaxies with an active galaxies nucleus ( agn ) ( diagnosed by their broad balmer emission lines or h@xmath0/[nii ] vs. [ oiii]/h@xmath11  diagram ) are excluded .",
    "these selections result in 66 green peas that have good optical spectra and measured galactic properties ( see cardamone et al . 2009 and izotov et al . 2011 for details about selection of green peas sample ) .",
    "this provides a parent sample of green peas for ly@xmath0  emission studies .",
    "we searched for uv spectra of the parent sample of 66 green peas in the hst archive , and find 12 green peas that have uv and ly@xmath0  spectra taken with the cosmic origins spectrograph ( cos ) ( pis : henry ( go : 12928 ) ; jaskot ( go : 13293 ) ; heckman ( go : 11727 ) ) .",
    "we study this sample of 12 green peas in this paper .",
    "the 9 galaxies in henry s sample were selected from the parent sample of 66 green peas by their fuv brightness , with @xmath12 .",
    "the 2 galaxies in jaskot s sample were selected by their extreme [ oiii]/[oii ] ratios . the one galaxy in heckman s sample was selected by its high fuv luminosity , high uv flux , and compact size . compared to the parent sample , the current sample of 12 green peas covers the full ranges of mass , sfr , and ew([oiii ] ) of the parent sample , and these 12 green peas are only slightly biased to lower metallicity and lower dust extinction ( see figure 1 ) . to address the bias of the current 12 green peas sample and explore the relations between ly@xmath0  and galactic properties , we are taking ly@xmath0  spectra of a larger sample of green peas to cover more completely the distributions of metallicities and dust extinctions ( pi : malhotra ( go : 14201 ) ) .    /h@xmath11  and metallicity .",

    "we run it @xmath25 times , and 1.8% of the resulting correlation coefficients are better than the observed data ( r=0.94 ) .",

    "<S> we compare their high - quality ly@xmath0  profiles with single hi shell radiative transfer models and find that the ly@xmath0  escape fraction anti - correlates with the derived hi column densities . </S>",
    "<S> single shell models fit most ly@xmath0  profiles well , but not the ones with highest escape fractions of ly@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> our results suggest that low hi column density and low metallicity are essential for ly@xmath0  escape , and make a galaxy a ly@xmath0  emitter . </S>"
