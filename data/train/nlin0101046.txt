    "a central question of nonequilibrium physics is pattern formation , why only certain stationary patterns in a nonequilibrium , homogeneous , and continuous medium are observed for fixed parameters and boundaries . in this paper",
    ", we investigate a particular aspect of this question , namely how does pattern formation depend on the shape of the lateral boundaries .",
    "we do so by numerically integrating a two - dimensional model of a three - dimensional convecting fluid ",
    "the swift - hohenberg equation  @xcite  in an annular domain as a function of the inner and outer radii of the annulus and of the reduced rayleigh number  @xmath2 ( which measures how strongly the fluid is driven out of equilibrium ) .",
    "theory predicts that , as parameters are varied , two kinds of patterns may be observed , a defect - free straight roll texture or an array of dislocations  @xcite .",
    "the results we present below confirm some of these predictions and also predict a new state of radially oriented grain boundaries if the radial width becomes sufficiently large .",
    "future rayleigh - bnard experiments with a large prandtl number fluid near onset in an annular domain may be able to confirm these results .",
    "our calculations were motivated by experiments  @xcite and simulations  @xcite which show that a rich variety of stationary patterns are observed just above the onset of rayleigh - bnard convection in the form of stripes ( locally periodic convection rolls ) disordered by topological defects such as dislocations , focus singularities , and grain boundaries .",
    "( section  viii of the review article by cross and hohenberg  @xcite discusses many experimental and theoretical results for rayleigh - bnard convection . )",
    "the occurrence of defects can be qualitatively understood as a consequence of two competing effects .",
    "first , near onset the local wave numbers of the convection rolls are constrained by the busse stability balloon  @xcite to lie in a narrow range about the critical wave number  @xmath4 .",
    "second , in the absence of horizontal thermal gradients , convection rolls are observed to evolve so as to approach the lateral boundaries at an approximately normal angle  @xcite . for the most",
    "commonly used experimental geometries of cylinders or boxes , these two constraints conflict with one another since it is not possible for the rolls to be everywhere normal to the sidewalls and to wiggle sinusoidally on a single length scale .",
    "this conflict can be partially resolved by the formation of topological defects which allow a local change in wave vector .",
    "an insightful analysis of this conflict between lateral boundary conditions and local wave number was given by cross  @xcite , who observed that sufficiently close to the onset of convection , the pattern formation was governed by a lyapunov functional  @xmath5 that decreases monotonically along any given orbit and that was bounded from below .",
    "such a functional  @xmath5 implies that all initial conditions relax asymptotically to some stationary pattern and also provides a way to order different stationary patterns by their relative stability  @xcite . in the double limit @xmath6 where  @xmath2 is proportional to the reduced rayleigh number @xmath7 and where  @xmath8 is the aspect ratio ( ratio of the largest lateral dimension to the fluid depth ) , cross showed that the lyapunov functional  @xmath5 could be decomposed into a sum of three terms , a surface term associated with the lateral boundaries , a bulk term for the fluid far from the boundaries , and a defect term which depends on the particular defects present . by comparing these three terms with one another for various geometries in the limit",
    "( [ eq : double - limit ] ) , cross was able to explain rather subtle phenomena such as why a pattern of straight parallel rolls should be observed sufficiently close to onset in a large cylindrical or annular domain , as opposed to a pattern of concentric rolls with the same axisymmetry as the domain .",
    "however , a careful comparison of cross s calculations with experiment  @xcite or with numerical simulation has not been carried out and it remains unclear to what level of accuracy the limits in eq .",
    "( [ eq : double - limit ] ) need to be satisfied for cross s asymptotic analysis to hold .",
    "experiments and numerical simulations can also help to determine when higher - order terms in the amplitude expansion destroy the property of variational dynamics , leading to a sustained oscillatory or chaotic time dependence .    of particular interest to us",
    "are cross s predictions about possible patterns in an annular domain . for this geometry ,",
    "a fundamental frustration can arise if the rolls are normal to both the inner and outer boundaries since it is then not possible for the local wave number to remain close to the critical value  @xmath4 as a function of radius in the limit of a large radial difference  @xmath9 .",
    "cross predicted two possibilities that are illustrated in fig .",
    "7 of his 1982 paper  @xcite .",
    "one was that sufficiently close to onset , the bulk term in the lyapunov functional would dominate , which would favor straight rolls that extend throughout the annular cell .",
    "wave number frustration and defects are then avoided since the rolls are not normal to the sidewalls .",
    "as a second possibility , cross predicted that the surface term would be more important further above onset in which case the rolls would orient normal to the inner and outer boundaries .",
    "an average wave number close to the critical value  @xmath4 could then be arranged by introducing an array of dislocations ( an example is shown below in fig .",
    "[ fig - r1-eq-60-eps - eq-0.1 ] ) . to our knowledge , these predictions have not been tested experimentally or numerically .    in this paper , we test these predictions by numerical simulations of the two - dimensional time - dependent swift - hohenberg equation  @xcite in an annular geometry as a simple opportunity to explore how lateral boundaries affect pattern formation .",
    "the swift - hohenberg equation is a widely - studied rotationally invariant model that undergoes a supercritical bifurcation from a zero field state to a stripe state , corresponding to the supercritical bifurcation of a conducting motionless fluid to finite - amplitude three - dimensional convection rolls .",
    "sufficiently close to the onset of convection , the long - wavelength slow - timescale dynamics of the swift - hohenberg equation obeys the same amplitude equation as the one obtained from the three - dimensional boussinesq equations that describe a convecting fluid quantitatively  @xcite .",
    "the linear stability boundaries of the swift - hohenberg equation are also similar to that of the boussinesq equations near onset  @xcite .",
    "numerical integrations of the swift - hohenberg equation in periodic , rectangular , and cylindrical geometries  @xcite have shown that its solutions are often in semi - quantitative agreement with experiments sufficiently close to onset .",
    "it is then often useful to explore some questions of pattern formation first with eq .",
    "( [ eq-2d - sh - eq ] ) and later make more careful studies by experiment or by more expensive simulations of the boussinesq equations .    using a new time - integration code that we have developed to integrate the swift - hohenberg equation efficiently and accurately in large annular domains  @xcite ,",
    "we have calculated transient solutions and their asymptotic stationary patterns for different initial states and for different values of the parameters  @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 . as we describe below",
    ", our results confirm parts of cross s predictions but we also find that his analysis was incomplete in that a new state occurs when the radius difference  @xmath3 becomes sufficiently large .",
    "this new state consists of patches of stripes separated by radially - oriented grain boundaries .    using a modified version of the code ,",
    "we have also integrated a generalized swift - hohenberg ( gsh ) model  @xcite to explore whether the wave number frustration caused by the annular geometry may lead to a sustained dynamics . the gsh  model couples a second field , the vertical vorticity potential  @xmath10 , to eq .",
    "( [ eq-2d - sh - eq ] ) in such a way that the overall dynamics is no longer variational and sustained time - dependent solutions are possible  @xcite .",
    "our admittedly brief study suggests that a sustained dynamics exceeding  30 or more horizontal diffusion times ( @xmath11 ) seems to occur for  @xmath12 while for @xmath13 , long - lived transients were observed that decayed toward a time - independent state .",
    "however , further studies will be needed to determine more carefully whether any of the states are truly chaotic ( what might appear to be chaotic states in a spatially extended system might instead be long - lived transients whose average decay time grows rapidly with the system size  @xcite ) and to characterize the dependence of the dynamics on aspect ratio and other parameters .",

    ".    because the approximations relating the gsh model to the boussinesq equations are less well justified than those that relate the swift - hohneberg model near onset , especially concerning sustained chaotic states , it would be interesting to continue these calculations not with further integrations of the gsh model but with integrations of the three - dimensional boussinesq equations in an annular domain , and to test the various calculations with experiments in large - aspect - ratio annular domains .",
    "the previous sections may be summarized as follows .",
    "we have developed and applied a new computer code to study pattern formation formation near onset of the swift - hohenberg model in annular domains of varying aspect ratios . as pointed out by cross  @xcite ,",
    "an annular geometry is interesting because there is an inherent conflict near onset between the tendency of rolls to be normal to the sidewalls and the tendency for the rolls to be straight in the bulk .",
    "we have investigated cross s predictions for annular cells of varying aspect ratio @xmath168 , near onset with @xmath122 , and further from onset with @xmath123 .    for an annular domain of rather small aspect ratio ( @xmath169 ) ,",
    "the predictions of cross hold and stationary states with dislocations are preferred ( have a lower lyapunov functional density ) compared to straight rolls . as the aspect ratio  @xmath8 becomes larger , new patterns are observed that are characterized by radially oriented grain boundaries . in nearly all cases , for a given geometry and reduced rayleigh number  @xmath2 , many different stationary states are possible , usually differing only slightly in the value of the lyapunov density or mean square field ( nusselt number ) .",
    "the pattern that produces the global minimum of  @xmath137 for given parameters values  @xmath2 , @xmath0 , and  @xmath1 is not known but we conjecture to be a highly symmetric arrangement of defects .",
    "straight - roll patterns are observed only when starting from straight - roll initial conditions .",
    "such patterns can have a lower lyapunov density than the patterns with radially oriented rolls but evidently have such a small basin of attraction that they are not observed starting from most initial conditions .",
    "we also explored the possibility of sustained time - dependent states using a generalized swift - hohenberg model , for parameters such that a long - lived spiral defect state is observed in a large aspect ratio periodic square  @xcite .",
    "however our admittedly incomplete study revealed only long - lived complex spatiotemporal transients .",
    "further analysis , preferably by experiment or by integrations of the boussinesq equations , will be needed to determine the effect of an annular domain on time - dependent states .",
    "we hope that the above results will stimulate experiments to test the specific calculations reported here , especially in large prandtl number fluids near onset for which the swift - hohenberg equation should provide a reasonable description .",
    "we would like to thank michael cross for helpful discussions and nsf grant dms-9722814 and doe grant de - ft02 - 98er14892 for supporting this research .",
    "werner pesch and collaborators ( private communication ) have used a spectral code with fine space - time resolution to analyze spiral defect chaos states of the generalized swift - hohenberg model in a large periodic square domain and found an extremely long - lived transient that coarsens to a chaotic state with just a few spirals .",
    "thus there remains some controversy whether a sustained spiral defect state truly exists in the gsh  model as suggested by previous work  @xcite ."
