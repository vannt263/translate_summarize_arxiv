    "outflows are frequently observed in active galactic nuclei ( agns ) and their origin has been discussed .",
    "the blueshifted absorption lines in the spectra suggest the existence of the outflows .",
    "typical absorption lines are broad absorption lines ( bals ) , of which blueshifted velocities are @xmath10 and the line widths exceed @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "bals are observed in optical or ultraviolet ( uv ) spectra and detected in 1020% of quasars .",
    "the blueshifted absorption lines are observed also in x - ray band ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "such absorption features are thought to be made by fexxv and/or fexxvi in the outflow .",
    "the velocity and the column density of the outflow are roughly evaluated as @xmath12@xmath13 and @xmath14@xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the speed of light .",
    "these high - velocity outflows are called ultra fast outflows ( ufos ) . though the number of the samples is still small ,",
    "ufos are detected in about a half of seyfert galaxies . since the kinetic luminosity of the ufos",
    "is evaluated to be comparable to or larger than that of jets @xcite , the ufos may contribute to the agn feedback .",
    "in addition , the mass outflow rate of ufos is at least 510% of the mass accretion rate onto the black holes .",
    "thus , ufos may have an impact on the growth of the super massive black holes .",
    "however , the origin of ufos is still unknown .",
    "the dichotomy between agns with the absorption lines and those without the absorption lines is the problem still in discussion .",
    "@xcite suggested that the difference between them is caused by the viewing angle of the observer , since the properties except for the absorption lines are quite similar between the bal and non - bal quasars .",
    "@xcite proposed the funnel - shaped disk wind model . in this model , if the wind interrupts the observer s line of sight ( the observer s viewing angle coincides with the opening angle of the wind ) , the blueshifted absorption lines appear in the spectra . in contrast , if there is no wind between the nuclei and the observer , the absorption features are not detected .",
    "on the other hand , @xcite have proposed another idea that the outflows intermittently appear . in this case , the presence or absence of the absorption features changes with time independently of the viewing angle .    until now",
    ", many theoretical models have been proposed to explain the origin of the outflow .",
    "one of the most plausible models is the line - driven disk winds , in which radiation force due to spectral lines ( the absorbing uv radiation through the bound - bound transition of metals ) accelerates the matter and launches the outflows from the disk surface .",
    "this mechanism is effective only for the matter in low- or moderate - ionization state , since the bound - bound transition can not occur if the metals are fully ionized .",
    "thus , the line - driven wind model is capable of explaining the acceleration and the ionization state of the wind , which are required to reproduce the blueshifted absorption lines , at the same time .",
    "the discovery of the line locking in some quasars @xcite indicates that the line force can play an important role for acceleration of the matter .",
    "@xcite ( hereafter sk90 ) showed that the line - driven mechanism becomes more effective for the matter in the low - ionization state and the radiation force including the line force can be @xmath17@xmath18 times larger than the radiation force due to the electron scattering .",
    "it implies that the line - driven wind can be launched from the sub - eddington disks .",
    "the magnetically driven winds can also explain the acceleration of the outflows @xcite .",
    "however , the extra mechanism is required to realize the optimum ionization state of the metals .",
    "the radiation hydrodynamic simulations of the line - driven winds launched from the disks around supermassive black holes have been performed by @xcite and @xcite ( hereafter psk00 and pk04 ) .",
    "they improved the numerical method for the line - driven winds around white dwarfs ( , ) , and applied to the outflows in agns .",
    "psk00 and pk04 reproduced the funnel - shaped disk wind .",
    "the wind comes from a distance from the black hole of @xmath19 several @xmath20 and goes away in the direction of @xmath21 for the typical parameters , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the schwarzschild radius , @xmath25 is the polar angle measured from the rotation axis of the disk , @xmath1 is the black hole mass , and @xmath2 is the eddington ratio of the uv radiation . based on the results of pk04 , @xcite and @xcite performed the spectral synthesis and compared them to the x - ray observations .",
    "although psk00 and pk04 mentioned that the winds are produced for the range of @xmath26 and the winds do not appear for @xmath27 , their simulations focus on the case of @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the line - driven disk wind in the wide parameter space of the black hole mass and the eddington ratio was investigated by @xcite .",
    "they used a non - hydrodynamic method , in which the trajectories of the fluid elements are calculated by solving the equation of motion including the line force , and found the steady structure of the line - driven winds . using the similar non - hydrodynamic method",
    ", @xcite also investigated the wind properties , such as the ionization state , the outflow velocity , and the column density and compared them to those inferred from the x - ray observations of bals . as a result , it has been concluded that the bals are detected in 10% of agns in the case of @xmath28@xmath29 and @xmath30@xmath31 .",
    "thus , previous studies focused either on only a typical case using hydrodynamic simulations , or on kinematics of the wind in a wide parameter space without considering hydrodynamic effects .",
    "however , the radiation hydrodynamic simulations in the wide parameter space have not been performed yet . in the previous studies ,",
    "the line - driven wind model has never been applied to ufos , although ufos are detected in a wide variety of the black hole mass and the eddington ratio @xcite . since",
    "the ufos are important with respect to the evolution of super massive black holes and the feedback to the host galaxies , we here try to understand origin of the ufos in a context of the line - driven wind model . in this paper",
    ", we investigate the line - driven winds for various black hole masses and the uv luminosities by performing the two - dimensional radiation hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "we also investigate the cases that the x - ray photoionization is more effective and the density at the disk surface is relatively large or small .",
    "in addition , we calculate the ionization parameter , the outflow velocity , and the column density along the line of sight .",
    "then , by comparing them to the observational features of the ufos , we examine whether or not the line - driven wind may explain the phenomena .",
    "we explain our calculation method in section [ method ] .",
    "we present results of the simulations and comparison with the observational features in section [ results ] .",

    "we also find that the velocity and the column density of the matter with @xmath164 ( @xmath205 and @xmath206 ) are insensitive to the black hole mass , leading to insensitivity of the ufo probability .",

    "the line force works effectively only at the region that the x - ray is heavily obscured . in this region ,",
    "the radial component of the disk flux is also diluted so that a part of the matter is blown away relatively upward ( @xmath219@xmath220 ) via the line force .",
    "our present simulations of the line - driven disk winds are roughly consistent with the observations of the ufos .",
    "our model shows that the ufo probability is 1328% in a wide parameter range of the eddington ratio and the black hole mass ( @xmath222 and @xmath223 ) .",
    "we also found that this probability is insensitive to the ratio of the x - ray luminosity to the disk luminosity and the density of the disk surface ( see appendix [ app2 ] ) .",
    "the resulting probability of 1328% is roughly comparable to the estimation by @xcite .",
    "they reported the ufo probability to be @xmath22440% based on the frequency of detecting ufos in the seyfert galaxies , although the number of ufo samples is still small and the parameter dependence of ufos is still unknown . as shown in section [ xuv ] ,",
    "the wind is successfully launched when the black hole mass is relatively small ( @xmath200 ) and the x - ray luminosity is large ( @xmath215 ) .",
    "this implies that the ufo features could appear in the narrow line seyfert 1 galaxies ( nls1s ) .",

    "if the torus is compton thin or clumpy , ufo features can be observed even if the torus interrupts the line of sight of the observer .",
    "however , if the rotational axis of the accretion disk is aligned with that of the torus , and if the torus is optically thick enough to dilute the ufo features , the range of viewing angles in which the ufos are observed decreases , reducing the ufo probability .",

    "then , the ufo probability that we estimated is an upper limit . on the other hand ,",
    "if the rotational axis of the compton - thick torus is misaligned with that of the accretion disk , some of agns , which do not show the ufo features intrinsically , are not detected via the obscuration .",
    "this leads to increase of the ufo probability .",
    "the mass outflow rate and the kinetic luminosity of the line - driven disk winds in the present simulations are also consistent with the observations of the ufos .",
    "we evaluate the mass outflow rate as @xmath225 at the outer boundary of the calculation box , @xmath226 .",

    "the kinetic luminosity of the outflows is evaluated by @xmath234 at @xmath235 , which is 0.5%1% of the disk luminosity for @xmath222 and @xmath236 .",
    "for the cases of @xmath237 and @xmath238 , the kinetic luminosities are 0.1% and 0.3% of the disk luminosity .",

    "since the bolometric luminosity is almost the same as the disk luminosity , ( @xmath245 ) , our present result agrees with the x - ray observations of ufos .",
    "in addition , in the model presented by @xcite , the energy outflow rate is required to be larger than 0.5% of the bolometric luminosity to have the significant feedback on the surrounding environment .",
    "thus , our present simulations imply that the line - driven disk wind could contribute to the feedback on the host galaxies .",
    "our present study predicts a fraction of quasars show the ufo features , since the disk wind is launched from the disks around supermassive black holes , @xmath246 , as long as the eddington ratio is larger than 0.1 .",

    "however , the typical sed of the agns is the multicolor blackbody superposed with the power - law .    in order to assess the difference between the force multiplier by sk90 and that for the agn sed , we calculate the radiation transfer of the incident agn sed and estimate the effective force multiplier from the attenuation of the radiative flux . in this calculation",

    "the metal abundance is assumed to be the solar abundance .",
    "the incident sed consists of the multicolor disk blackbody and the power - law . here",
    ", the multicolor disk blackbody is the superposition of the blackbody radiation from the standard type disk , of which the effective temperature is described as @xmath253 ( see also the equation [ [ disktemp ] ] ) .",
    "we do not take into account the radiation from the region of @xmath254 ( @xmath255 ) because the effective temperature is too cold to emit the photons largely contributing to the line force .",
    "the sed of the multicolor disk blackbody has a peak at around @xmath256 .",
    "the photon index of the power - law spectrum in the energy range of @xmath12@xmath257 is @xmath258 .",

    "we adjust the intensity of the incident radiation as the ionization parameter becomes nearly equal to that of the hydrodynamic simulations ( @xmath259 ) in order to focus on the difference of the sed shape .",
    "we recognize the ratio of the attenuation via the metal absorption and that due to the electron scattering as the force multiplier for the agn sed .    as a result",
    ", we find that the force multiplier for the agn sed is about 3.6 times lager than that of sk90 .",
    "this is because the radiation in a band between @xmath101 and @xmath260 , which is stronger in the agn sed than in the sed employed in sk90 , largely contributes to the line force .",
    "since the radiation in this band is effectively absorbed , such an enhanced line force would not realized except at the very vicinity of the radiation source .",
    "that is , a factor 3.6 is probably an upper limit .",
    "indeed , the optical thickness from the disk surface to the selected grid cell is larger than 10 .    to research the effects of the enhancement of the force multiplier",
    ", we run a test model , in which the force multiplier is 3.6 times larger than that of sk90 for all the grid cells . as a result",
    ", we find that the maximum outflow velocity is around @xmath13 , which is three times larger than the original result ( @xmath176 ) .",
    "the ufo probability is 41% , which is about twice as large as the original ufo probability ( 20% ) . this is because the enhanced line force accelerates the wind more upward and the solid angle of the wind increases .",
    "the velocity of @xmath261 is not inconsistent with observations and the probability of @xmath8 fits the estimation by @xcite .",
    "hence , our disk wind model is consistent with the observed ufo features even if the force multiplier is revised for the agn sed .    here",
    "we note that , even if the force multiplier for the agn sed can be proposed , the obtained line force is not rigorous .",
    "the spectral shape changes due to the gas - radiation interaction as the radiation passes through the medium .",
    "however , this effect is not taken into account in the force multiplier , which is produced based on the fixed spectral shape .",
    "the spectrum for each place is obtained by solving the three - dimensional , multi - frequency radiation transfer calculations .",
    "@xcite performed the radiation transfer calculations by employing the density structure of the snapshot obtained by pk04 .",
    "although they reported the distribution of the ionization parameter in the case of the agn sed , their post - process calculation could not reveal the wind dynamics .",
    "the hydrodynamic simulations coupled with the three - dimensional , multi - frequency radiation transfer calculations are for further study .",
    "@xcite has reported that the observed absorption lines of fexxv and/or fexxvi are reproduced by the outflowing matter with @xmath158 , by employing the power - law x - ray spectrum with the photon index , @xmath262 , of 2 , and by considering that the photons in a band from @xmath101 to @xmath187 contribute to the ionization of the metals .",
    "since our simulations employ the force multiplier proposed by sk90 , the ionization parameter in the present work is evaluated by assuming the @xmath247 bremsstrahlung by implication .    to investigate the difference of the absorption lines due to the difference in the employed sed",

    "we adjust the intensity of the incident radiation as the ionization parameter is consistent with the result of the hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "thereby , we can focus on the difference of the spectral shape .",
    "resultingly , the absorption lines of fexxv and fexxvi appear for both seds , and the equivalent width is not significantly different .",
    "we find that the equivalent widths of fexxv and fexxvi for the 10kev bremsstrahlung are @xmath270 times and @xmath271 times of those for the power - law .",
    "the ratio of the equivalent widths of fexxv and fexxvi is @xmath272 times of that for the power - law .",
    "these results imply that we should take into account the difference in the seds of the incident radiation when we try to compare absorption features between the models and observations in great detail . however , this is not serious for the present study , which is roughly researching @xmath1-dependence and @xmath2-dependence of the ufo probability .",
    "the theoretical spectral synthesis adopting the realistic sed is necessary to discuss about the absorption features @xcite .",
    "we will report the simulated absorption features and comparison with the observations of ufos in a forthcoming paper .      in our simulations ,",

    "thus , the ufo probability is reduced to @xmath278 , which is about a half of our estimation described in section [ ufo ] . since the low - ionization region ( @xmath173 ) , in which the acceleration due to the line force is effective , becomes small from @xmath279 and @xmath280 ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) to @xmath281 and @xmath282 , the wind power might decrease .",
    "however , this ionization parameter would be overestimated , because the attenuation of the @xmath25-component of the radiation flux is neglected .",
    "the photons of which energy is @xmath283 are largely diluted in the high - density region around the disk surface in reality , so that the high - ionization region does not expand so much .",
    "indeed , the resulting distribution of the ionization parameter is almost the same as figure [ fig1 ] , if we estimate the ionization parameter by excluding the radiation of @xmath101-@xmath277 .",
    "this is the case , both the wind dynamics as well as the ufo probability would not change so much .",
    "we assume axial symmetry in the present simulations , but the three - dimensional simulations would be an important future work .",
    "recently , the time variations of the absorption lines are discovered ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this suggests that the structure of the disk wind changes in time and/or the wind has a non - axial symmetric structure . in the one - dimensional as well as the two - dimensional calculations ,",
    "the density fluctuations are reported ( @xcite , psk00 ) . in order to reveal the cause of the time variability",
    ", we should perform the time dependent three - dimensional simulations .",
    "although our simulations investigate the disk wind without solving the structure of the accretion disk , it is a important work to calculate the wind and the disk self - consistently .",
    "we assume that the geometrically thin and optically thick standard disk lies just below our computational domain .",
    "the @xmath74 plane is supposed to correspond to the disk surface , and the density on the grids of @xmath74 does not change with time .",
    "it implies that the mass and mass accretion rate of the disk does not decrease even if the disk wind is launched .",
    "in addition , we treat the accretion disk as the external radiation source , and the photons are steadily emitted from the equatorial plane of the disk .",

    "the disk and wind should be self - consistently treated by the multi - dimensional simulations .",

    "we performed two - dimensional radiation hydrodynamic simulations of line - driven disk winds in agns and compared our results to the observational features of ufos . as a consequence",
    ", we revealed that the line force successfully launches the disk wind , and the line - driven disk wind explains major properties of the ufos . for fiducial model ( @xmath23 and @xmath22 ) , the funnel - shaped wind , of which the velocity is @xmath176 and the opening angle is @xmath159 ,",

    "the matter of the mainstream is lifted relatively upward around the wind base ( launching region of the wind ) and turns in the radial direction , producing the funnel - shaped wind .",

    "<S> using two - dimensional radiation hydrodynamic simulations , we investigate origin of the ultra fast outflows ( ufos ) that are often observed in luminous active galactic nuclei ( agns ) . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the radiation force due to the spectral lines generates strong winds ( line - driven disk winds ) that are launched from the inner region of accretion disks ( @xmath0 schwarzschild radii ) . </S>",
    "<S> a wide range of black hole masses ( @xmath1 ) and eddington ratios ( @xmath2 ) was investigated to study conditions for causing the line - driven winds . for @xmath3@xmath4 and @xmath5@xmath6 , funnel - shaped disk winds </S>",
    "<S> appear , in which dense matter is accelerated outward with an opening angle of 70@xmath7 and with 10% of the light speed . </S>",
    "<S> if we observe the wind along its direction , the velocity , the column density , and the ionization state are consistent with those of the observed ufos . as long as the obscuration by the torus does not affect the observations of x - ray bands , </S>",
    "<S> the ufos could be statistically observed in about 1328% of the luminous agns , which is not inconsistent with the observed ratio ( @xmath8 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we also found that the results are insensitive to the x - ray luminosity and the density of the disk surface . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we can conclude that the ufos could exist in any luminous agns , such as narrow - line seyfert 1s ( nls1s ) and quasars with @xmath9 , in which fast line - driven winds are associated . </S>"
