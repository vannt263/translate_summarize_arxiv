    "it has long been recognized ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) that high - energy @xmath0-rays from astronomical sources are subject to @xmath1 absorption by low - energy target photons , if the energy threshold for pair production @xmath3 is fulfilled , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the energies of the @xmath0-ray and the soft target photon , respectively , normalized to the electron rest - mass energy , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 is the cosine of the collision angle .",
    "this process is expected to limit the very - high - energy ( vhe ) @xmath0-ray horizon out to which vhe @xmath0-rays may be detectable by ground - based @xmath0-ray observatories due to @xmath1 absorption on the extragalactic background light ( ebl ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , and the apparent absence of @xmath1 absorption signatures also provides evidence for relativistic beaming in @xmath0-ray bursts ( grbs ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and blazars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "when considering the effects of @xmath1 absorption , to the author s knowledge , all previous works have used the polarization - averaged cross section for @xmath1 absorption ( or simplified approximations derived from it ) ,    @xmath8    @xcite , where    @xmath9    is the normalized ( to the speed of light ) velocity of the produced electron and positron in the center - of - momentum frame of the collision . in the case of @xmath1 absorption of cosmological @xmath0-rays by the ebl ,",
    "the use of the polarization - averaged cross section is reasonable as the ebl is expected to be , on average , unpolarized on cosmological scales .",
    "however , this may not be the case when considering source - intrinsic @xmath1 absorption in grbs and blazars . in grbs ,",
    "the x - ray through @xmath0-ray emission is commonly interpreted as synchrotron radiation by shock - accelerated electrons , possibly with an admixture of thermal radiation from a photosphere of the initial fireball . in an ordered magnetic field ,",
    "synchrotron radiation is expected to be polarized , and compton scattering in the photosphere of structured grb outflows may also result in non - zero polarization of a possible photospheric emission component @xcite . in blazars ,",
    "the low - energy emission , potentially acting as targets for intrinsic @xmath1 absorption , is generally agreed to be produced by synchrotron radiation of relativistic electrons ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * for a review of blazar emission models ) . in the case of synchrotron self - compton ( ssc )",
    "radiation or hadronic emission scenarios for the @xmath0-ray emission , also the @xmath0-rays are expected to be polarized @xcite .",
    "therefore , when considering the intrinsic @xmath1 opacity of high - energy @xmath0-ray sources , the effects of polarization may not be negligible .",
    "the study of potential effects of the polarization dependence of the @xmath1 opacity in grbs and blazars is the aim of this paper .",
    "section [ crosssection ] contains a brief discussion of the polarization - dependent cross section for @xmath1 absorption .",
    "section [ model ] presents a simple model scenario to illustrate the potential impact of the polarization dependence of the @xmath1 absorption cross section in the case of intrinsic absorption of polarized @xmath0-rays by a target photon field with the same polarization geometry as the @xmath0-rays , as generally expected when @xmath0-rays and target photons are produced co - spatially .",
    "section [ discussion ] contains a discussion of the results .",
    "the polarization - dependent cross section for @xmath1 absorption has been calculated by @xcite . using the same nomenclature as employed in @xcite ( e.g. , eqs .",
    "[ sigma_average ] and [ betacm ] ) , the cross section @xmath10 for the case of parallel linear - polarization vectors of the @xmath0-ray and target photon , is given by    @xmath11    and @xmath12 for the case of perpendicular polarization vectors :    @xmath13    one verifies easily that @xmath14 according to eq . [ sigma_average ] .",
    "these cross sections as a function of center - of - momentum energy are plotted in figure [ crosssection_plot ] .",
    "it can be seen that the cross section for the case of perpendicular polarization directions ( a ) peaks at lower energies than the average and the parallel case and ( b ) peaks at a value about 1.5 times higher the peak cross section for the parallel case .",
    "this means that the @xmath1 absorption of polarized @xmath0-ray photons by target photons with identical polarization direction is suppressed compared to the unpolarized case ( and compared to the case of absorption on target photons with polarization direction perpendicular to that of the @xmath0-ray photon ) .",
    "this may be important in cases where polarized @xmath0-rays are produced co - spatially with synchrotron target photons , with preferred electric - field vector orientations perpendicular to a globally ordered magnetic field in the emission region .",
    "if the @xmath0-rays are co - spatially produced , e.g. , by ssc scattering , proton synchrotron radiation , or synchrotron emission of secondary particles in photo - pion induced cascade processes , then they are expected to have the same polarization direction as the target electron - synchrotron photons @xcite . in this case",
    ", we expect two consequences of the polarization - dependence of the cross sections ( [ sigma_parallel ] ) and ( [ sigma_perp ] ) : 1 . the overall @xmath1 opacity is reduced compared to @xmath1 absorption by unpolarized photons , and 2 .",
    "the degree of polarization @xmath15 is expected to increase in a partially self - absorbed regime ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * for a discussion of possible signatures of partially self - absorbed ssc emission in grbs ) , because the dominant polarization direction of the @xmath0-ray beam will be less affected by @xmath1 absorption since it is primarily interacting with the sub - dominant polarization direction of the target photon field , and vice versa .",
    "these effects will be illustrated and studied more quantitatively with a simple toy model of a synchrotron - dominated @xmath0-ray source in the next section .",
    "in this section , we investigate the potential effects of polarization - dependent @xmath1 absorption in an idealized case of a synchrotron - dominated @xmath0-ray source , as commonly assumed for the non - thermal emission from grbs .",
    "the model assumes a spherical emission region containing a perfectly ordered magnetic field , and considers a non - thermal electron synchrotron spectrum characterized by an energy index @xmath16 , i.e. , an emission coefficient @xmath17 , extending from @xmath18 without cut - off into the @xmath0-ray regime .",
    "additional , polarized high - energy and very - high - energy @xmath0-ray photons may be produced , e.g. , by proton synchrotron radiation or synchrotron emission of secondary leptons produced in photo - pion produced pair cascades ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the synchrotron emissivity is normalized to a total synchrotron compactness @xmath19 , so that @xmath1 absorption effects are expected to become important at high energies .",
    "based on the spectral index @xmath16 , the synchrotron spectrum is characterized by a degree of polarization    @xmath20    from which we find the emission coefficients with electric - field vector orientations pependucular and parallel to the magnetic field , as @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively .",
    "for the case study in this section , let us consider the @xmath1 opacity of a synchrotron @xmath0-ray beam emitted perpendicular to the b - field . due to the dependence of the synchrotron emissivity on the pitch angle @xmath23 of relativistic particles , @xmath24 ,",
    "the majority of polarized synchrotron photons is expected to be emitted in this direction ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "let us further choose the direction of propagation of the @xmath0-ray as the z - axis , and the b - field along the y - axis .",
    "we define @xmath26 as the angle that a target photon momentum makes with the z - axis ( and , thus , the @xmath0-ray photon momentum ) , and @xmath27 as the azimuthal angle around the z - axis , with @xmath28 in the ( y , z ) plane .",
    "the @xmath0-ray photon then has polarization vectors given by @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "one then finds that the polarization vector @xmath31 parallel to the magnetic field projection onto the plane perpendicular to the direction of propagation of any target photon interacting with the @xmath0-ray from an angle ( @xmath26 , @xmath27 ) forms an angle @xmath32 with @xmath33 given by @xmath34 . using this result",

    "figure [ synchrotron_tau_plot ] shows the resulting @xmath1 opacities for a source with compactness @xmath45 , and a synchrotron spectral index of @xmath46 .",
    "both the polarization - dependent and the polarization - averaged opacities show the well - known energy dependence @xmath47 . as expected , the @xmath1 opacity for photons with parallel polarization direction is larger than that for photons with perpendicular ( the dominant ) polarization direction . however , the effect is smaller than the difference in the peak values of the respective cross sections , since the target photon field is not 100  % polarized , thus mitigating the effect .",
    "still , the difference between the opacities in the two polarization directions is about 10  % in this case .    given an expected optically - thin synchrotron flux @xmath48 emerging from the spherical synchrotron source considered here ,",
    "the emerging spectrum @xmath49 including the effects of @xmath1 absorption is calculated separately for both polarization directions , as    @xmath50    the degree of polarization @xmath15 of the emerging spectrum is then evaluated based on the emerging fluxes with parallel and perpendicular polarization directions , i.e. , @xmath51 .",
    "the result for our baseline example is plotted in figure [ synchrotron_spectrum_plot ] .",
    "one sees the expected spectral break @xmath52 in accordance with equation [ fnu ] .",
    "the top panel illustrates the effect mentioned in the previous section , that the dominant ( perpendicular ) polarization direction is less affected by @xmath1 absorption than the sub - dominant ( parallel ) one , leading to an increase of the degree of polarization @xmath15 towards the optically - thick regime .    while the change of the degree of polarization , @xmath53 expected from polarization - dependent @xmath1 absorption is a rather small effect ( @xmath54  % ) , it can be compared to the change expected if the associated spectral break is due to a break in the underlying electron distribution . in that case",
    ", one expects a change @xmath55/[\\alpha + 5/3])$ ] . for a break from @xmath56 ,",
    "this would yield a change of @xmath57  % .",
    "figure [ tau_alpha_plot ] illustrates how these results depend on the spectral index @xmath16 of the synchrotron spectrum .",
    "the upper panel shows that the use of the average ( unpolarized ) @xmath1 opacity may overestimate the actual opacity for polarized @xmath0-rays by up to @xmath2  % for a relatively steep intrinsic spectrum .",
    "the lower panel compares the change in @xmath0-ray polarization @xmath15 across the spectral break between the two cases of the break being caused by @xmath1 absorption and by a break in the underlying electron distribution .",
    "while the polarization - change due to @xmath1 absorption is always expected to be at the @xmath58  % level , a break in the underlying electron distribution may cause much larger changes .",
    "below we will discuss whether this may be used as a diagnostic of the importance of @xmath1 absorption in the formation of the high - energy spectra of grbs and blazars .",
    "the main results of the study presented in the previous sections can be summarized as follows :    * the use of the unpolarized ( average ) @xmath1 opacity may over - estimate the actual @xmath1 opacity by a small amount , up to @xmath2  % in cases where high - energy @xmath0-rays and target photons have identical preferred polarization directions , and the magnetic field is perfectly ordered .",
    "this effect becomes larger with increasing spectral index of the target photon field .",
    "* polarization - dependent @xmath1 absorption leads to a spectral break in the emerging @xmath0-ray spectrum , which is accompanied by a small increase of the percentage polarization @xmath15 , which is , for spectral indices @xmath59 , smaller than the expected change in polarization resulting from a break in the underlying electron distribution .",
    "both in the case of grbs and blazars , the target photon field for @xmath1 absorption is most likely of synchrotron origin , and therefore expected to be polarized .",
    "the non - thermal @xmath0-ray emission from grbs is also commonly attributed to synchrotron emission ( and possibly ssc radiation ) , while that of blazars may be due to ssc emission or proton - induced processes , such as proton synchrotron or synchrotron radiation from photo - pion - induced secondaries . in those cases , also the @xmath0-ray emission from blazars is expected to be polarized .",
    "the study presented here has shown that the use of the unpolarized @xmath1 opacity may slightly overestimate , e.g. , minimum lorentz factors of blazars and grbs .    in our simple toy model , a perfectly ordered magnetic field has been assumed . from the observed optical polarization ,",
    "e.g. , of blazars , reaching maximum values of @xmath60  % , one can infer that due to partial disorder in the b - field , the degree of polarization of the @xmath0-ray and target photon fields is reduced to at most about 50  % of the level expected for a perfectly ordered b - field .",
    "therefore , realistically , one may expect that @xmath1 opacities may be overestimated by no more than @xmath61  % , which  for most practical purposes  is a sufficiently small error to justify the use of the polarization - averaged @xmath1 crosssection .",
    "an additional , simplifying assumption made in our toy model was the extension of the polarized target photon field into the @xmath0-ray regime without any cut - off .",
    "a high - energy cut - off of the synchrotron target photon spectrum would result in an increased degree of polarization at and beyond the ( normalized ) cut - off energy @xmath62 .",
    "this will result in a larger effect of the polarization dependence of the @xmath63 absorption cross section at @xmath0-ray photon energies @xmath64 , where the over - estimation of the @xmath1 opacity when using the polarization - averaged cross section , would become more severe than discussed above .",
    "the measurement of high - energy polarization is a very challenging task .",
    "however , satellite - borne instruments , such as spi and ibis on board the integral satellite , have already been used successfully to constrain the hard x - ray / soft @xmath0-ray polarization from gamma - ray bursts @xcite , and design studies for the upcoming astro - h mission suggest that it may also be able to detect polarization in the 50 ",
    "200  kev energy band @xcite .",
    "it has also been suggested that the large area telescope ( lat ) on - board the _ fermi _ gamma - ray space telescope may be able to detect @xmath0-ray polarization in the energy range @xmath65  200  mev when considering pair - conversion events occurring in the silicon layers of the detector , by taking advantage of the polarization - dependent direction of motion of the electron - positron pairs produced in the @xmath0-ray  pair conversion process @xcite . for bright @xmath0-ray sources , degrees of polarization down to @xmath2",
    "% may be detectable .",
    "however , the feasibility of such @xmath0-ray polarization measurements with _ fermi_-lat is highly controversial .",
    "the proposed gamma - light mission @xcite may provide substantial progress in the ability to measure @xmath0-ray polarization , due to the absence of any tungsten conversion layers in its design . with such advances",
    ", it may be feasible to detect the @xmath0-ray polarization of grbs and blazars .",
    "this will open up the avenue to ( a ) more precisely determine the expected @xmath1 opacity constraints relevant to these sources and ( b ) identify the nature of spectral breaks in the @xmath0-ray spectra of grbs and blazars , which will afford deeper insight into the nature of the underlying electron distribution and , hence , the mechanisms leading to the acceleration of particles to ultrarelativistic energies in the relativistic jets of grbs and blazars .",
