    "recently , there has been considerable progress in understanding the properties of strongly coupled gauge theories with supersymmetry @xcite . in particular",
    ", there are a number of supersymmetric gauge theories that are believed to be interconnected through a web of strong - weak coupling dualities .",
    "although existing evidence for these dualities is encouraging , there is still an urgent need to address these issues at a more fundamental level .",
    "ideally , we would like to solve for the bound states of these theories directly , and at any coupling .    of course , solving a field theory from first principles is typically an intractable task .",
    "nevertheless , it has been known for some time that @xmath3 dimensional field theories _ can _ be solved from first principles via a straightforward application of dlcq ( see @xcite for a review ) . in more recent times , a large class of supersymmetric gauge theories in two dimensions was studied using a supersymmetric form of dlcq ( or ` sdlcq ' ) , which is known to preserve supersymmetry @xcite .",
    "we have recently been able to extend the sdlcq algorithms to solve higher - dimensional theories @xcite .",
    "one important difference between two - dimensional and higher - dimensional theories is the phase diagram induced by variations in the gauge coupling .",
    "the spectrum of a @xmath3 dimensional gauge theory scales trivially with respect to the gauge coupling , while a theory in higher dimensions has the potential of exhibiting a complex phase structure , which may include a strong - weak coupling duality .",
    "@xcite seemed to provide hints of the latter .",
    "it is therefore interesting to study the phase diagram of gauge theories in @xmath4 dimensions .    towards this end , we consider three dimensional su(@xmath5 ) @xmath1 super - yang - mills compactified on the space - time @xmath6 .",
    "the calculations are all done in the large @xmath5 limit . in particular , we compactify the light - cone coordinate @xmath7 on a light - like circle via dlcq , and wrap the remaining transverse coordinate @xmath8 on a spatial circle .",
    "we are able to solve for bound state wave functions and masses numerically by diagonalizing the discretized light - cone supercharge .",
    "we have shown that the sdlcq procedure extends naturally to @xmath9 dimensions , resulting in an exactly supersymmetric spectrum .",
    "the contents of this paper are organized as follows . in section [ formulation ] , we formulate su(@xmath5 ) @xmath1 super - yang - mills defined on the compactified space - time @xmath0 .",
    "explicit expressions are given for the light - cone supercharges , which are then discretized via the sdlcq procedure .",
    "quantization of the theory is carried out by imposing canonical commutation relations for boson and fermion fields .",
    "we also discuss the two discrete symmetries of the theory in this section .",
    "in section [ numerical ] , we present our numerical results .",
    "we present plots of the spectrum as a function of the longitudinal and transverse resolution and show that it convergences very rapidly in both .",
    "we plot the spectrum also as a function of the coupling and find a very stable strong - coupling spectrum .",
    "we identify several states that appear to be unphysical and disappear at high transverse resolutions .",
    "finally we discuss the infrared spectrum of the theory and present evidence that it is entirely determined by the dimensionally reduced theory .",
    "we conclude our analysis with a discussion of our results and a list of important related future projects in section [ summary ] .",
    "discrete light cone quantization has proven to be a very powerful method of studying the mass spectra of various theories @xcite .",
    "it is well known that in @xmath3 dimension one can define a new version of dlcq which preserves supersymmetry @xcite . in higher dimensions a supersymmetric prescription is also possible @xcite .",
    "we begin by introducing light - cone coordinates @xmath10 , and compactifying the @xmath7 coordinate on a light - like circle . in this way",
    ", the conjugate light - cone momentum @xmath11 is discretized . to discretize the remaining ( transverse ) momentum @xmath12",
    ", we may compactify @xmath13 on a spatial circle .",
    "of course , there is a significant difference between the discretized light - cone momenta @xmath11 and the discretized transverse momenta @xmath14 ; namely , the light - cone momentum @xmath11 is always positive , while @xmath14 may take on positive or negative values .",
    "the positivity of @xmath11 is a key property that is exploited in dlcq calculations ; for any given light - cone compactification , there are only a finite number of choices for @xmath11  the total number depending on how finely we discretize the momenta . the ` resolution ' of the discretization",
    "is usually characterized by a positive integer @xmath15 , which is called the ` harmonic resolution ' @xcite ; for a given choice of @xmath15 , the light - cone momenta @xmath11 are restricted to positive integer multiples of @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the total light - cone momentum of a state . in the context of two - dimensional theories ,",
    "this implies a finite number of fock states @xcite .    in the case of interest here , we include an additional transverse dimension , and the number of fock states is no longer finite , since there is an arbitrarily large number of transverse momentum modes defined on the transverse spatial circle .",
    "thus , an additional truncation of the transverse momentum modes is required to render the total number of fock states finite and the problem numerically tractable",
    ". this truncation procedure , which is characterized by a transverse resolution t , is analogous to the truncation of @xmath11 imposed by the ` harmonic resolution ' @xmath15 .",
    "thus the transverse momentum @xmath18 range from zero to @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the size of the transverse circle .",
    "let us now review these ideas in the context of a specific super - yang - mills theory .",
    "we start with @xmath21-dimensional @xmath1 super - yang - mills theory defined on a space - time with one transverse dimension compactified on a circle : s = d^2 x _ 0^l dx_(-f^f_+ i|^d _ ) . after introducing the light ",
    "cone coordinates @xmath22 , decomposing the spinor @xmath23 in terms of chiral projections = , = , and choosing the light ",

    "in particular , the light - cone energy , @xmath27 , and momentum operators , @xmath17,@xmath28 , corresponding to translation invariance in each of the coordinates @xmath29 and @xmath30 may be calculated explicitly : [ moment ] p^+&=&dx^-_0^l dx _ , + p^-&=&dx^-_0^l dx _ , + p_&=&dx^-_0^l dx_.",
    "the light - cone supercharge in this theory is a two component majorana spinor , and may be conveniently decomposed in terms of its chiral projections : [ sucharge ] q^+&=&2",
    "^ 1/4dx^-_0^l dx _ , + [ sucharge- ] q^-&=&2 ^ 3/4dx^-_0^l dx_. the action ( [ action ] ) gives the following canonical ( anti-)commutation relations for propagating fields for large @xmath5 at equal @xmath31 : @xmath32= \\left\\{\\psi_{ij}(x^-,x_\\perp),\\psi_{kl}(y^-,y_\\perp)\\right\\}= \\frac{1}{2}\\delta(x^- -y^-)\\delta(x_\\perp -y_\\perp)\\delta_{il}\\delta_{jk}. \\label{comm}\\ ] ] using these relations one can check the supersymmetry algebra \\{q^+,q^+}=2p^+,\\{q^-,q^-}=2p^-,\\{q^+,q^-}=-4p_.

    "moreover , in the @xmath37 sector , the mass squared operator @xmath38 is given by @xmath39 .",
    "as we mentioned earlier , in order to render the bound state equations numerically tractable , the transverse momentum of partons must be truncated .",

    "we retain parity symmetry in the transverse direction .",
    "how does such a truncation affect the supersymmetry properties of the theory ?",
    "note first that an operator relation @xmath45=c$ ] in the full theory is not expected to hold in the truncated formulation .",

    "the anticommutator @xmath53 , however , is not equal to @xmath54 .",
    "so the diagonalization of @xmath53 will yield a different bound - state spectrum than the one obtained after diagonalizing @xmath54 .",
    "of course , the two spectra should agree in the limit @xmath55 . at any finite truncation , however , we have the liberty to diagonalize either of these operators .",
    "the choice of @xmath53 specifies our regularization scheme .",
    "choosing to diagonalize the light - cone supercharge @xmath56 has an important advantage : _ the spectrum is exactly supersymmetric for any truncation_. in contrast , the spectrum of the hamiltonian @xmath57 becomes supersymmetric only in the infinite resolution limit .",
    "let us discuss the discrete symmetries of @xmath35 .",
    "there are three commuting @xmath58 symmetries , one of them is the parity in the transverse direction : @xmath59 note that @xmath60 does not commute with @xmath34 or with @xmath61 : @xmath62 the second symmetry is given by a generalization of the t  symmetry defined in @xcite ( we will call it s to avoid the confusion with transverse truncation parameter ) : @xmath63 it commutes with all the noether charges ( [ moment])([sucharge- ] ) . since @xmath60 and @xmath64 commute with each other one needs only one additional symmetry @xmath65 to close the group .",
    "since @xmath35 , @xmath60 and @xmath64 commute with each other we can diagonalize them simultaneously .",
    "this allows us to diagonalization of the supercharge separately in the sectors with fixed @xmath60 and @xmath64 parities and thus will reduce the size of matrices . doing",
    "this one finds that the roles of @xmath60 and @xmath64 are different .",
    "while all the eigenvalues are usually broken into non - overlapping @xmath64odd and @xmath64even sectors @xcite , the @xmath60 symmetry leads to a double degeneracy of massive states ( in addition to usual boson ",
    "fermion degeneracy due to supersymmetry ) . to demonstrate this ,",
    "let us start from the massive bosonic state @xmath66 : @xmath67 if @xmath68 then the bosonic state @xmath69 has nonzero norm and it is also an eigenstate of @xmath70 with eigenvalue @xmath38 .",
    "this state however has a negative parity : @xmath71 thus we found one more nice feature of sdlcq : in addition to preserving supersymmetry in the truncated theory it also preserves the degeneracy of the spectrum related to parity .",
    "we believe that this degeneracy will be lost in the usual dlcq approximation but currently have no proof of that .    to summarize",
    ", we have introduced a truncation procedure that facilitates a numerical study of the bound state problem , and preserves supersymmetry .",
    "the interesting property of the light - cone supercharge @xmath35 ( [ qminus ] ) is the presence of a gauge coupling constant as an independent variable , which does not appear in the study of two - dimensional theories . in the next section",
    ", we will study how variations in this coupling affects the bound states in the theory .",
    "in order to implement the dlcq formulation of the bound - state problem  which is tantamount to imposing periodic boundary conditions @xmath72 @xcite  we simply restrict the light - cone momentum variables @xmath73 appearing in the expressions for @xmath34 and @xmath35 to the following discretized set of momenta : @xmath74 . here",
    ", @xmath17 denotes the total light - cone momentum of a state , and may be thought of as a fixed constant , since it is easy to form a fock basis that is already diagonal with respect to the operator @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "the reciprocal of the harmonic resolution @xmath15 measures the coarseness of our discretization .",
    "the continuum limit is then recovered by taking the limit @xmath75 .",
    "physically , @xmath76 represents the smallest positive unit of longitudinal momentum fraction allowed for each parton in a fock state",
    ".    of course , as soon as we implement the sdlcq procedure , which is specified unambiguously by the harmonic resolution @xmath15 , and cut off transverse momentum modes via the constraint @xmath77 , the integrals appearing in the definitions for @xmath34 and @xmath35 are replaced by finite sums , and so the eigen - equation @xmath78 is reduced to a finite matrix diagonalization problem . in this last step we use the fact that @xmath27 is proportional to the square of the light - cone supercharge is an identity in the continuum theory , and a _ definition _ in the compactified theory , corresponding to the sdlcq prescription @xcite . ]",
    "previously @xcite we studied this theory with @xmath15 up to @xmath79 , but with only one unit of transverse momentum corresponding to @xmath80 .",
    "in figure [ old ] we show the spectrum we obtained in that study as a function of a dimensionless coupling @xmath81 .",
    "this figure shows several striking features that we want to analyze in more detail .",
    "first , we want to know whether the well defined strong - coupling spectrum , observed in figure [ old ] , persists at higher values of transverse resolution @xmath82 and study its convergence in @xmath82 .",
    "the other striking feature of the @xmath83 , @xmath80 spectrum is the state that is falling rapidly at large coupling .",
    "we will analyze the behavior of analogous states at different values of longitudinal and transverse resolutions and in particular we will be interested in the fate of the asymptotic ( as @xmath84 ) massless state in the continuum limit .",
    "in addition to this state there are many states that stay exactly massless at all values of coupling .",
    "as we have shown in @xcite , the number of such states does not depend on the value of the transverse resolution . the new numerical data support this result .",
    "the massive state at @xmath85 are just the discrete approximation the a continuum of free particles and is extactly calculable analytically .",
    "our previous sdlcq calculations were done using a code written in mathematica and performed on a pc .",
    "this code has now been rewritten in c++ and some of the present work was done on supercomputers .",
    "we were able to perform numerical diagonalizations for @xmath86 through 7 and for values of @xmath82 up to @xmath87 at @xmath88 and @xmath80 at @xmath89 .",
    "there are very few theories , other than in @xmath3 dimensions , where we have good information about the strong - coupling spectrum . in @xmath3",
    "dimensions the concept of strong coupling has very little meaning since the coupling only comes in as an overall multiplicative constant in the hamiltonian .",
    "there are a few lattice results but most of what we know comes from theories that have dualities with weakly coupled theories . for the @xmath21-dimensional @xmath1 sym theory we are considering ,",
    "there is no known duality between strong and weak coupling . using sdlcq , however",
    ", we can directly uncover the behavior of the theory at strong coupling .    in figure [ perpmom ]",
    ", we plot the bound state mass squared @xmath38 , in units of @xmath90 , as a function of the transverse resolution @xmath82  for @xmath88 and @xmath83 in the strong - coupling regime .",
    "we see that these curves are amazingly flat , showing that this theory converges very rapidly with the transverse cutoff .",
    "we saw previously in @xmath91-dimensional models @xcite that sdlcq converges much faster than dlcq , and this appears to persist for the transverse momentum in @xmath9 dimensions . from these figures",
    "it appears that we get sensible results by @xmath92 and good results already for @xmath93 .",
    "given this rapid convergence , a sensible procedure is to remove the transverse cutoff by extrapolating the masses of the low lying bounds states to large transverse resolution at each value of the longitudinal resolution ( thus constructing the sdlcq spectrum of the complete three dimensional theory ) and then extrapolating to large longitudinal resolution k for each of the states to find the spectrum as a function of the coupling . for @xmath94 and @xmath95",
    "we simply take the masses at the largest transverse momentum since there are not enough transverse moment points to make a meaningful extrapolation .",
    "let us look at the bound state mass as a function of the coupling .",
    "[ coupling](a ) shows an example of states completely settled down in transverse resolution , namely @xmath96 .",
    "in contrast , fig .  [",
    "coupling](b ) has only @xmath80 at @xmath94 .",
    "notice that nevertheless both plots show extremely stable states as a function of the coupling @xmath97 , irrespective of their status of convergence in @xmath82 . as we found in our preliminary study @xcite of this theory ,",
    "all the masses in the strong - coupling region are independent of the coupling .",
    "we see that by a coupling of @xmath98 a stable strong - coupling spectrum has appeared .",
    "we have looked as high as couplings of 1000 and we see this same behavior for all longitudinal and transverse resolutions .    in figure [ long ] we plot the bound state mass as a function of @xmath76 .",
    "these results are the first calculation of the strong - coupling bound states of @xmath1 sym in @xmath9 dimensions . as we increase the resolution we are able to see states that have , as their primary component , more and more partons , and , as we have seen in other supersymmetric theories , many of these states appear at low energies .",
    "this accumulation of high - multiplicity low - mass states appears to be a unique property of susy theories . in non - susy theories the new states appear at increasing energies",
    ". in the dimensionally",
    "reduced version of this theory we saw that the accumulation point of these low - mass states appeared to be at zero mass @xcite . here",
    "again we see clear evidence of an accumulation of low mass states , however we do nt have sufficient information to say whether an accumulation point exists .    at this point",
    "we have not attempted to follow a specific bound state as a function of @xmath15 .",
    "the appearance of new low mass as we increase @xmath15 makes this difficult , however a careful study of the wavefunction should make it possible .",
    "also the accuracy of the extrapolation to infinite @xmath15 would be greatly impoved by addition of one or two additional transverse resolution at the largest values of @xmath15 .      in our preliminary study of this model",
    "we found one state that was particularly striking .",
    "it was very heavy at small coupling and approached zero mass at strong coupling , _ cf .",
    "_  figure [ old ] .",
    "we have now been able to look at this state at higher values of both transverse and longitudinal resolutions .",
    "we now believe that this state is most likely not a physical one .",
    "we are now able to identify two states with irregular coupling dependence which are shown in figure [ falling ] at various transverse resolution for @xmath83 .",
    "we see that as we increase the transverse cutoff these states move up rapidly in mass , leading us to conclude that as @xmath99 , they decouple .",
    "one of these irregular states falls down to @xmath100 and then moves up , while another one has the same type of behavior , but with finite minimal mass .",
    "the fact that the first state touches zero is of some interest : a similar behavior was noted in a supersymmetric scalar matrix model in @xcite and in that model the authors conjecture that this behavior might signal the existence of a critical coupling . here",
    "the point where the mass goes to zero would appear to move to infinity as we remove the transverse cutoff , and it is not at all clear that those ideas carry over here .    at @xmath94 and @xmath88",
    "we do not see these states , at least not at the same masses but at @xmath89 we again see such states .",
    "we believe that this is strong evidence that these are unphysical states .",
    "clearly a real normalizable bound state must be visible at both even and odd resolutions , which is not the case here .",
    "recently we have seen unphysical massless states of this type in a two dimensional theory with @xmath101 supersymmetry @xcite . in that theory",
    "we had an independent theoretical evidence for them to be unphysical .      in figure",
    "[ old ] we see a number of states that become massless as @xmath102 .",
    "we already explained this property in @xcite .",
    "namely at zero coupling only the first term survives in the supercharge ( [ qminus ] ) and then all the partons with @xmath103 ( anti-)commute with @xmath35 .",
    "thus any state constructed from such partons only becomes massless .",
    "the inverse statement is also true : at @xmath104 a massless state can not contain any parton with @xmath105 .",
    "thus the set of massless states at @xmath104 coincides with a hilbert space of the theory dimensionally reduced to @xmath3 .",
    "moreover , the whole infrared spectrum of sym@xmath2 at small coupling is governed by the dimensionally reduced theory ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "previously @xcite we commented on the existence of exactly massless states and in @xcite on the one - to - one correspondence between them and massless states of the @xmath91-dimensional model . actually this fact provides an easy way to construct massless states for three - dimensional theories ; the matrices to be diagonalized have a size much smaller than the ones used in the straightforward approach .",
    "the counting of massless states in three dimensions is also reduced to the analogous problem in @xmath3 dimensions . for finite @xmath5 ,",
    "even the @xmath91-dimensional case is not easily handled @xcite ; however , for large @xmath5 the multi - trace states decouple , and one needs to count only single - trace massless states . at resolution @xmath15 there are @xmath106 of them . as a numerical check of the correspondence between massless sectors of @xmath21 and @xmath91-dimensional theories , we can count the massless states at different values of transverse resolution and as anticipated we found this number to be independent of @xmath82 .",
    "these massless states are bps states in the sense that they are destroyed by one super - charge , @xmath35 , and not the other , @xmath34 , and the bps bound , which is zero here , is saturated .",
    "in @xcite it appeared that there were additional states that became massless as @xmath107 but now we believe that these states are unphysical .",
    "therefore the only massless states at nonzero coupling are the same @xmath106 bps states we saw in the dimensionally reduced model .",
    "in this work , we considered the bound states of three dimensional su(@xmath108 ) @xmath1 super - yang - mills defined on the compactified space - time @xmath109 . in particular , we compactified the light - cone coordinate @xmath7 on a light - like circle via dlcq , and wrapped the remaining transverse coordinate @xmath8 on a spatial circle .",
    "we showed explicitly that sdlcq , employed in recent studies of @xmath91-dimensional supersymmetric gauge theories , extends naturally to @xmath9 dimensions .",
    "the supersymmetry becomes @xmath36 because we can always chose @xmath61 to be zero in a light - cone quantized field theory , and sdlcq provides a regularization scheme that preserves this supersymmetry .",
    "the supersymmetric theory considered here is finite and requires no renormalization .    by retaining a finite number of transverse and longitudinal modes",
    ", we were able to solve for bound - state wave functions and masses numerically by diagonalizing the discretized light - cone supercharge .",
    "the theory clearly has a stable spectrum at both small and large couplings . in figure [ perpmom ]",
    "we see that the theory converges very rapidly in the transverse resolution .",
    "we have seen in reference @xcite that sdlcq gives very smooth behavior in the longitudinal resolution . in figure [ falling ] we see that the states with irregular coupling dependence move off rapidly to high mass with increasing transverse resolution",
    ". they also do not seem to appear at resolutions 4 and 6 .",
    "we therefore conclude that they are not physical states .",
    "we see that there are no new massless states at strong coupling , and the complete massless sector of sym@xmath2 is determined by the two - dimensional model .",
    "the number of exactly massless states at any coupling is @xmath106 , with no dependence on the transverse resolution .",
    "in addition , some states become massless as @xmath97 goes to zero , but their behavior is also described by the theory in @xmath3 dimensions .",
    "consequently , we conclude that the entire massless spectrum of the @xmath21-dimensional model is determined by the dimensionally reduced model .",
    "in previous work @xcite we saw that the average number of particles in the massless states increases with @xmath97 and quickly becomes equal to the maximum number allowed by the resolution .",
    "we also see here that the number of low - mass states increases with resolution .",
    "together this implies that at strong coupling the light states of this theory , and other susy theories , have a huge number of degrees of freedom .",
    "no doubt , it is this fact that allows for the possibility that these susy theories can contain all of the physics of dual theories in a different number of space - time dimensions",
    ". it would be interesting to relate this observation with the recent claim that strongly coupled super - yang - mills theory corresponds to string theory in an anti - de sitter background @xcite .",
    "of course , the techniques we have employed here may be applied to any supersymmetric gauge theory defined on a suitably compactified space - time .",
    "this should facilitate a more general study of the strongly coupled dynamics of super - yang - mills theories , and in particular , allow us to scrutinize the string - like properties of yang - mills theories .",
    "we have neglected the zero modes totally in this calculation .",
    "it remains an important problem to include these modes .",
    "we already know a great deal about zero modes @xcite which are , after all , really only a few extra quantum mechanical degrees of freedom .",
    "it has recently been conjectured by witten @xcite that including these zero modes leads to spontaneous supersymmetry breaking in this theory .",
    "let us briefly comment on the @xmath20 dependence of the spectrum .",
    "for large @xmath20 the appropriate dimensionless @xmath20 independent mass scale is ; @xmath110 at large @xmath111 the spectrum is constant in terms of @xmath112 , therefore in terms of this dimensionless mass scale the entire spectrum would go to zero as @xmath113 .",
    "a possible interpretation of this result is that in the continuum limit this theory approaches a conformal field theory .",
    "there are however very massive states in our spectrum , that we did not study , that could remain massive in the contimuum limit .",
