    "classical novae occur in accreting binaries with a white dwarf ( wd ) as the primary .",

    "a wind driven by radiation pressure leads to ejection of accreted and partially nuclear - processed material , forming an optically thick shell around the binary system .",
    "the nova terminates once the remaining hydrogen is consumed on the wd surface .",
    "reviews of classical novae can be found in e.g. , @xcite .",
    "classical novae are copious x - ray emitters ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "several processes are involved in producing the x - rays .",
    "one is photospheric emission from a hot layer of the wd surface fueled by residual nuclear burning after the explosion .",
    "the layer is rendered visible after the ejecta shell expands and becomes less opaque to soft x - rays .",
    "its x - ray spectrum is characterized by a very soft blackbody - like emission with a temperature of @xmath850  ev and is easily identified in medium - resolution ccd spectra .",
    "higher - resolution grating spectroscopy can further identify absorption features by the wd atmosphere over the blackbody continuum @xcite .",
    "these types of x - ray emitters are known as super - soft sources ( sss ) .",
    "another type of x - ray emission originates from circumstellar material that is photoionized by the sss emission .",
    "this reprocessed emission is usually dwarfed by the ionizing source . however , when the surface nuclear fuel is consumed and the sss emission fades out , residual emission from the heated surrounding medium can emerge .",
    "this was found in the nova v382 vel , in which the residual emission was interpreted as the radiatively cooling ejecta that are optically thin and have reached a collisional equilibrium @xcite .",
    "similar line - dominated emission was found in v4743 sgr , when the sss emission turned off for a brief period for unknown reasons @xcite .",
    "yet another type is weak and hard x - rays , which a substantial fraction of x - ray - emitting novae exhibit within a year of the outburst before the sss emission becomes visible . in systematic studies by rosat @xcite and swift @xcite ,",
    "more than half and six out of eight are among such novae , respectively .",
    "while their spectra are similar to that found in v382 vel @xcite , their origin is probably different ; the ejected material has not expanded enough to be optically thin , and no ionizing source is present to heat up the surrounding material .",
    "several possible origins have been proposed for the hard x - rays including shock heating of expanding ejecta @xcite and reestablished accretion .",
    "the latter explains the x - rays seen in a nova by a magnetic wd ( v2487 oph ; @xcite ) .",
    "detailed and timely spectroscopy is requisite to understanding the origin of the early hard x - ray emission , but it is complicated by the faint and more transient nature of this phenomenon . while grating spectroscopy yields a wealth of information , it is limited to extremely bright sources .",
    "only two novae have been studied with grating spectroscopy for their hard emission , but they are atypical samples ; rs oph @xcite is a symbiotic nova , where shocks are expected between the expanding ejecta and the stellar wind of the giant companion .",
    "hard emission from v382 vel @xcite was also observed with grating , but the emission has a different origin as described earlier .",
    "hard emission in most classical novae with a main sequence companion has generally been studied based on scant low - resolution spectra and data of poor statistical quality .",

    "both models can explain the data .",
    "we observed v458 vul with the medium - resolution spectrometer aboard suzaku .",
    "a high signal - to - noise ratio spectrum allows us to constrain the abundance of metals individually for seven elements ( table  [ t2 ] ) .",
    "the abundance values are subject to change due to the unconstrained he abundance .",
    "he , along with h , contributes to the continuum emission in the observed band .",
    "we fixed the he abundance to the solar value in our fitting procedures , but an increased abundance of he leads to an increased estimate of metal abundances .",

    "we note here that systematic uncertainties can arise from possible inaccurate modeling .",
    "first , the uncertainty in the @xmath27 estimate amplifies the uncertainty of the n and o abundances , although we consider it unlikely that the both elements have the solar abundance from the result of the `` model 4 '' .",
    "second , a single temperature model may be an oversimplification .",
    "this leads to particularly high uncertainties in elements formed far away from the isothermal temperature .",
    "for example , in a 0.65  kev plasma , the lines of s and si ( the peak formation temperature @xmath01.4  kev ) have to be formed in the wings of their line emissivity functions .",
    "small changes in temperature require large changes in abundance , because the slope of the line emissivity functions is steeper in their wings than near the peak .",
    "this explains the increasing uncertainties of mg , si , to s in the `` model 1 '' .",
    "the same arguments apply for the low - temperature lines of n and o ( the peak formation temperature @xmath57  kev ) .",
    "if the plasma is not isothermal and additional components with temperatures of 0.3 and 1.4 kev are present , significantly lower abundances for n , o , si , and s will be obtained . without a knowledge of the true emission measure distribution such as that determined by @xcite , it is impossible to determine the accurate abundances .",
    "we speculate , however , that contributions from plasma with temperatures below 0.3  kev and above 1.4  kev are minor , judging from a high ratio of n to n and a low ratio of si and si ( figure  [ f3 ] ) .    with these uncertainties in mind ,",
    "it is interesting to note that an n enhancement and a fe deficiency in hard x - ray emission are seen in all novae with a @xmath29 and a @xmath35 measurement , respectively , including the present work @xcite .",
    "we speculate that this typical pattern in the x - ray spectra is a consequence of these novae belonging to the one - type .",
    "the deficiency of the fe abundance with respect to the intermediate - mass elements is consistent with the theoretical understanding that one - type novae produce elements up to si and s. the n enhancement can be interpreted as an outcome of the h fusion on the wd surface , where the cno cycle produces abundant n by the n to o conversion as the rate - determining process the abundance of n with respect to o increases for more massive one - type novae .",
    "a quantitative comparison with theoretical work @xcite is hampered by a relatively large uncertainty in our fitting results , but the overall abundance pattern in v458 vul indicates that this is an one - type nova .",
    "we first argue that the x - ray emission observed from v458 vul is most likely to be the internal shock of the nova ejecta , and not due to other processes .",
    "the hard spectrum exceeding 1  kev shows that it is neither the sss emission nor the reprocessed emission of it .",
    "the possible n enhancement is consistent with the plasma mostly composed of the ejecta .",
    "shocks might occur externally between the ejecta and swept - up interstellar matter , but the total mass of the swept - up matter by the time of the suzaku observation is too small compared to the ejected mass .",
    "the ejecta mass is estimated to be in the range of @xmath010@xmath2310@xmath58 @xmath52 @xcite , whereas the swept - up mass is @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the proton mass , @xmath61  cm@xmath23 is the ism density , @xmath62  km  s@xmath5 is the initial speed of expanding shell @xcite , and @xmath63 is the time of the suzaku observation elapsed from the explosion . if we adopt @xmath64  cm@xmath23 , the densest value in the surrounding planetary nebula @xcite , the swept - up mass is far smaller than the typical ejecta mass .    in the case of symbiotic novae like",
    "rs oph , early hard emission can be produced by external shocks between the expanding ejecta and the stellar wind of the giant companion @xcite .",
    "this does not work for classical novae , in which the secondary is a main sequence star and the stellar wind is not dense enough @xcite .",
    "while no observational evidence exists that v458 vul is not a symbiotic nova , shock emission by collisions between the expanding ejecta and the stellar wind of the companion is not likely . in rs oph , the shock itself occurred over a relatively short time scales , and the hard x - ray emission quickly faded afterwards @xcite , while the x - ray count rate in v458 vul rises with no indication of a decline .",
    "it is most likely that the x - rays from v458 vul originate in shocks internal to the expanding system , presumably between slower and earlier pre - maximum ejecta and faster and later nova winds @xcite .",
    "however , in the later swift observations one year after the nova , this hard x - ray emission still remains and exhibits highly variable flux in anti - correlation with the uv flux @xcite .",
    "elaborated theoretical work is necessary to explain all these properties to see if the internal shock interpretation is valid .    from the spectral fits ,",
    "the absorption - corrected x - ray luminosity at the suzaku observation is @xmath65  erg  s@xmath5 in the 0.33.0  kev band at an assumed distance of 13  kpc .",
    "the luminosity is in a typical range for classical novae @xcite .",
    "the x - ray volume emission measure at the same time is @xmath66  cm@xmath23 , where @xmath67 and @xmath42 represent the x - ray - emitting volume and the plasma density as a function of time @xmath43 .    with these measurements and several simplifying assumptions ,",
    "a crude estimate can be obtained for the lower and upper bounds of the plasma density at @xmath63 .",
    "assuming that the plasma density is uniform and that the expansion velocity @xmath68 has not changed since the outburst , the x - ray emitting volume can not exceed the volume of the expanding shell ; i.e. , @xmath69 .",
    "the observed @xmath70 thus implies that the density must be @xmath71  cm@xmath23 .",
    "if we further assume that the plasma was created at one epoch and not heated repeatedly , the plasma density can not be too high to cool radiatively too soon .",
    "the cooling time @xmath72 at @xmath63 is approximated as @xmath73 . with @xmath74 100  day , which is an approximate duration of the detected x - ray coverage by swift , the upper bound is estimated as @xmath75  cm@xmath23 . the lower and upper bounds put @xmath76 within a range of two orders around @xmath7710@xmath78  cm@xmath23 .",
    "@xcite derived a similar density of @xmath79  cm@xmath23 assuming @xmath80 for v351 pup observed 16 month after its explosion .",
    "the classical nova v458 vul was discovered on 2007 august 8 . in response to the swift detection of x - ray emission on day 70",
    ", we conducted a target of opportunity observation on day 88 with suzaku .    the x - ray spectrum obtained by the xis is attributable to a single - temperature ( @xmath00.64  kev ) optically - thin thermal plasma emission at a collisional equilibrium with an interstellar extinction of @xmath03@xmath610@xmath18  @xmath3 .",
    "in addition to the plasma temperature and the amount of extinction , the chemical abundances of conspicuous elements were derived .",
    "the abundance pattern is characterized by a possible enhancement of n and deficiencies of o and fe abundances with respect to other metals . from the x - ray luminosity of @xmath81  erg  s@xmath5 ,",
    "the plasma temperature of 0.64  kev , and the volume emission measure of @xmath82  cm@xmath23 at the time of the suzaku observation , we constrained the average plasma density to be @xmath83@xmath84  cm@xmath23 assuming a constant expansion velocity of @xmath85  km  s@xmath5 .",
    "all the observed x - ray properties obtained by suzaku can be interpreted as the emission arising from shocks of ejecta in a nova at a @xmath013  kpc distance .",
    "we demonstrated the capability of the xis to yield a high signal - to - noise ratio spectrum for a moderately bright x - ray nova in a reasonable telescope time .",
    "this put constraints on physical values and chemical compositions of the x - ray emission . in conjunction with monitoring observations routinely done by swift",
    ", we anticipate that similar suzaku observations can be executed for several novae every year .",
    "the authors appreciate an excellent review by gloria sala .",
    "we also thank kazuhiro nakajima and hitoshi yamaoka in the variable star observers league in japan for providing optical data of v458 vul , and the suzaku telescope managers for allocating a part of the director s discretionary time for this observation .",
