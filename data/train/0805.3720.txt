    "events with three or more isolated leptons in the final state have attracted significant attention as possible signatures of new physics phenomena produced at high energy collider physics facilities such as the fermilab tevatron @xcite and the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) @xcite . to the extent that new physics at the scale of @xmath7  gev or more is related to electroweak symmetry breaking",
    ", new states predicted in beyond the standard model ( bsm ) schemes typically couple to the @xmath8 or @xmath9 gauge bosons which , in turn , decay to leptons .",
    "supersymmetry ( susy ) is a well studied potential realization of physics beyond the standard model  @xcite .",
    "trilepton events have long been mentioned as potential golden discovery modes for susy processes in which a chargino @xmath10 and a neutralino @xmath11 are jointly produced .",
    "isolated three lepton signatures arise from the decay modes @xmath12 , along with @xmath13 . in this example",
    ", the @xmath14 is the lowest mass susy particle assumed to be effectively stable and therefore a source of missing energy ; @xmath15 and @xmath16 stand for on - shell or virtual gauge bosons .",
    "this susy example provides a relatively clean source of isolated trilepton events  @xcite . within susy ,",
    "one can also pair - produce heavy sparticles that carry the color quantum number , such as gluinos and squarks .",
    "the cascade decays of these states , while parameter dependent , will generally result in trilepton final states along with hadronic jets  @xcite .",
    "other bsm constructs , such as higgsless models , extra - dimensional models , and models with extended gauge groups , predict states at high mass , such as kaluza - klein towers and extra gauge bosons , that decay to the more familiar @xmath17 and @xmath18 electroweak gauge bosons . in one example of a higgsless model , a massive @xmath19 is predicted with dominant decays into pairs of gauge bosons , such as @xmath20 , which is a source of isolated three lepton final states  @xcite .",
    "our intent here is not to present a survey of bsm sources of multilepton events .",
    "we cite the cases mentioned as indicative of a range of possibilities .    in this paper",
    "we are concerned with obtaining as good an estimate as possible of the production of isolated three lepton final states that arise entirely from sources within the standard model ( sm ) itself .",
    "an obvious and important example is the associated production of a pair of gauge bosons , such as @xmath0 , along with its generalizations @xmath1 , where @xmath21 is a virtual photon that decays as @xmath22 .",
    "while the importance of the @xmath1 process has been emphasized as an important background before @xcite , we demonstrate that its contribution significantly changes the expectations of the particular cms and atlas studies we examine . unlike @xmath0",
    ", the @xmath1 contribution can not be reduced by an antiselection of events in which the invariant mass of the @xmath23 system is in the vicinity of the @xmath9 peak .    in this work ,",
    "we use madevent  @xcite to compute the full matrix elements for partonic subprocesses that result in a @xmath24 final state . for the @xmath25 process",
    ", this method allows us to retain important angular correlations among the final leptons .",
    "here @xmath26 stands for the full range of @xmath23 pairs resulting from a @xmath18 , a drell - yan virtual photon , and photon-@xmath18 interference .",
    "our estimates are larger for this process than those one would obtain from a modeling of @xmath0 alone from within pythia  @xcite , and we describe these differences .",
    "inclusion of the @xmath21 contribution accounts for part of these differences .",
    "since @xmath25 is an important standard model background in many searches for new physics , we suggest that events be generated by a matrix element program and be fed into the pythia showering routines , rather than use of the @xmath0 routine built into pythia .",
    "a major new contribution in this paper is the demonstration that isolated leptons from bottom and charm decays are a potent source of standard model backgrounds to new physics signatures in the three lepton final state .",
    "this study is an extension of our prior investigation  @xcite of sm heavy flavor backgrounds to the isolated two - lepton final state that is important in searches for the higgs boson . in this new paper",
    "we compute contributions from a wide range of sm heavy flavor processes including @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 .",
    "we also include contributions from @xmath31 production , and from processes in which a @xmath17 is produced in association with one or more heavy flavors such as @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 .",
    "in all these cases , one or more of the final observed isolated leptons comes from a heavy flavor decay .",
    "the @xmath33 and @xmath34 contributions have not been examined previously .    to examine signal discrimination ( and to compute signal to background ratios ) , we choose the specific case of chargino and neutralino pair production as the signal process .",
    "we focus on the susy parameter space points lm1 , lm7 , and lm9 considered by the cms collaboration  @xcite and on the su2 point studied by the atlas collaboration  @xcite .",
    "these points are expected to have favorable susy cross sections at the lhc .",
    "the dominant nature of some of the sm backgrounds motivates the investigation of new selections ( cuts ) on the final state kinematic distributions that would be effective in reducing the backgrounds .",

    "[ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "we show that it should be possible to find at least a @xmath5 excess in 30 fb@xmath6  for susy point lm9 .",
    "the use of leptons inside jets to tag bottom and charm jets has led to the recognition that strong isolation criteria are required to distinguish leptons from primary interactions from those caused by secondary decays . in ref.@xcite",
    "we demonstrate that the rate for secondary leptons to pass isolation cuts is surprisingly large  about 1 part in 200 . in this section",
    "we explain the reasons these leptons pass the isolation cuts at such a large rate .",
    "the simplest case to understand is the production of muons from @xmath35 quark decay .",
    "the branching fraction of various @xmath36 hadrons ( @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , etc . ) to muons is roughly 914% .",
    "observation of these leptons requires , however , that their charged tracks generally be above some transverse momentum threshold ( see the appendix [ app : isolep ] for details of isolated lepton reconstruction ) . in the dotted line of fig.[fig : pmuptb ] we show the shape of the probability to produce a muon with @xmath40 gev versus the transverse momentum of an initial @xmath35 quark .",
    "this curve is determined predominantly from the @xmath41 matrix element decay of the @xmath36 hadron into @xmath42  @xcite and kinematics imposed by the muon momentum threshold .. a slightly harder @xmath36 spectrum is predicted by a nonperturbative fragmentation function @xcite , which in turn predicts that the leading edge of the dotted line in fig .",
    "[ fig : pmuptb ] would shift 12 gev lower .",
    "this implies softer @xmath35 quarks can produce 10 gev muons , and hence would slightly _ increase _ the backgrounds compared to those calculated here . ]",
    "the probability of producing a 10 gev muon is small at low @xmath35 transverse momentum , and it grows toward the branching fraction limit as the transverse energy of the @xmath35 moves farther above threshold .",
    "this curve leads to the false impression that low-@xmath43 @xmath35 quarks are unimportant .",
    "quark to produce an isolated muon with @xmath40 gev ( solid ) vs.  the @xmath35 transverse momentum .",
    "this curve is a multiplicative combination of the probability of producing a muon with @xmath40 gev ( dotted ) and the probability the muon will be isolated ( dashed ) . the @xmath35 production spectrum is not included .",
    "muon isolation criteria are described in the appendix .",
    "[ fig : pmuptb],width=312 ]    there are two ways in which a muon can pass isolation cuts applied to detector data .",
    "the first is if the other decay products of the @xmath36 hadron are physically separated in pseudorapidity @xmath44 and/or radial angle @xmath45 .",
    "this separation accounts for no more than 1/2 of the isolated rate .",
    "one could imagine rejecting secondary muons by increasing the area examined for accompanying radiation , but this technique reduces acceptance of primary muons and is of limited utility .",
    "of more importance is the isolation energy cut .",
    "when muons come from low-@xmath43 @xmath35 quarks , they must have taken most of the transverse momentum of the @xmath36 hadron .",
    "this means there is not enough energy left in the other @xmath36 decay products to fail the energy cuts for isolation .",
    "the net isolated muon probability is the multiplication of the probability for production and for passing isolation cuts .",
    "this probability is shown as the solid line of fig .",
    "[ fig : pmuptb ] , and it peaks fairly close to threshold .",
    "there is little freedom to change the picture in fig .",
    "[ fig : pmuptb ] .",
    "an attempt could be made to lower the energy threshold beyond which events are rejected , but this cut is already nearly optimized for the acceptance of real muons .",
    "hence , one might expect to reduce the rate of muons from higher-@xmath43 @xmath35 decays , but there will not be much gain .",
    "one other handle might be to look for secondary vertices , but our tests indicate that virtually all muons that pass isolation point back at the primary vertex . a preliminary examination of cdf data @xcite appears to confirm this finding .",
    "the physics behind finding an isolated electron from @xmath35 quark decay is similar to that for finding a muon .",
    "figure [ fig : peptb ] demonstrates the same probability for production of an electron .",
    "the probability of satisfying the isolation cuts is flatter with respect to @xmath46 than for the muon , because noise in the electromagnetic calorimeter requires less stringent cuts to maintain electron acceptance .",
    "it is possible to achieve some purity with a loss of acceptance , but we find little difference in the net rate of leptons from heavy flavors between the atlas reconstruction algorithm that we use  @xcite and less sophisticated algorithms .",
    "quark to produce an isolated electron with @xmath47 gev ( solid ) vs.  the @xmath35 transverse momentum .",
    "this curve is a multiplicative combination of the probability of producing an electron with @xmath47 gev ( dotted ) and the probability the electron will be isolated ( dashed ) . the @xmath35 production spectrum is not included .",
    "electron isolation criteria are described in the appendix .",
    "[ fig : peptb],width=312 ]    while physical limitations of the experimental apparatus control the acceptance of a lepton produced from a @xmath35 decay , the overall rate of reconstructed leptons includes the effect of the @xmath46 production spectrum . with the exception of top - quark decay",
    ", the @xmath46 spectrum tends to fall steeply . in fig .",
    "[ fig : lsigptb ] we display the net isolated lepton cross section as a function of @xmath46 for @xmath48 production . despite the larger acceptance for isolated muons around @xmath49 gev and isolated electrons with @xmath5050 gev , the peak production comes from @xmath35 quarks around 20 gev .",
    "the position of this peak has a profound effect on the simulation of isolated leptons , because fully 1/2 of the reconstructed muon rate comes from @xmath35 quarks with @xmath51 gev .",
    "a natural tendency is to ignore these lower energy @xmath35 quarks based on the low probability of lepton production shown in the dotted lines of figs .",
    "[ fig : pmuptb ] and [ fig : peptb ] . the complete picture ,",
    "however , demonstrates that these events are important and most difficult to reject .",
    "the net effect is that about 1% of @xmath35 quarks produce a lepton ( @xmath52 or @xmath53 ) that passes isolation cuts .",
    "this agrees with a d@xmath54  study using their full detector simulation that found @xmath55 of @xmath35 hadrons produced isolated muons @xcite .     production and decay ( solid ) , an isolated muon ( dashed ) , or an isolated electron ( dotted ) .",
    "[ fig : lsigptb],width=312 ]    an examination of charm decay into isolated muons and electrons leads to essentially identical conclusions as bottom decay with one minor addition . in fig .",
    "[ fig : lsigptc ] we show the cross section for production of a muon or electron vs.  @xmath56 , and their isolated rates . in practice , because of `` fakes '' ( charged hadrons mistaken for electrons ) , the reconstructed rate for electrons is larger than expected from the decay of @xmath57 to @xmath53 times an isolation acceptance . a large number of charged pions can be produced in decays of @xmath58 mesons",
    ". a reasonable fraction of these pions are reconstructed as electrons , and so the net rate for `` isolated electrons '' shown as the dot - dashed line is about 50% larger than expected .",
    "electron reconstruction algorithms are constructed in order to balance this contamination of charged pions versus acceptance .",
    "the goal across detectors is typically a fake rate for pions from jets of @xmath59 ( compared to the rate of leptons we find of a few times @xmath60 from @xmath35 and @xmath57 decays ) @xcite .",
    "depending of the physics study , it may be worth including the decays from heavy quarks as a part of the design of electron isolation algorithms .",
    "for the case of trileptons we examine here , the leptons from heavy quarks dominate the backgrounds .     production and decay ( solid ) , an isolated muon ( dashed ) , an electron which is then isolated ( dotted ) , or `` isolated electron '' including fakes ( dash - dot ) .",
    "[ fig : lsigptc],width=312 ]    we conclude this section by noting that figs .",
    "[ fig : lsigptb ] and [ fig : lsigptc ] indicate the expected rate of isolated electrons from processes containing @xmath35 and @xmath57 quarks can be significantly larger than the rate for isolated muons .",
    "consequently , new physics processes with muons should have a higher purity than those with electrons .",
    "one general strategy would be to look for signals with an excess that is more apparent in muon channels than electron channels .",
    "a second observation is that looser cuts cause the typical transverse momentum of surviving isolated electrons to be slightly higher than that for muons .",
    "this recognition suggests that electron events will be more suppressed than muon events by cuts on maximum lepton energy , e.g. , the @xmath18-peak cut used below .",
    "this lepton flavor dependence may allow an additional handle on _ in situ _ calibration of background sources .",
    "the backgrounds we discuss tend to arise from the tails or end points of physical processes and challenge detector capabilities . to achieve a believable and detailed simulation of reconstructed events , we follow the methods developed and validated in ref .",
    "@xcite , with some modifications for efficient production and analysis of the results .",
    "we generate events with a customized version of madevent 3.0 @xcite and run them through the pythia 6.327 @xcite showering monte carlo .",
    "both programs use the cteq6l1 parton distribution functions @xcite evaluated via an efficient evolution code @xcite .",
    "the showered events are fed through a version of the pgs 3.2 @xcite fast detector simulation , modified to match atlas geometries , efficiencies , and detailed reconstruction procedures @xcite .",
    "we confirm that our results agree with full atlas detector simulations at both the reconstructed object ( leptons , jets , @xmath61 ) and analysis levels to better than 10% ( and in some cases better than 1% ) .",
    "for this paper we use the atlas muon and electron reconstruction procedure ( described in the appendix ) and detector efficiencies to produce initial candidate leptons for both cms and atlas studies .",
    "we then apply the cms or atlas geometric acceptance , transverse momentum threshold , and analysis cuts in order to compare to their to their respective studies .",
    "we reproduce the results of the published cms analysis to better than 1% in most cases . as we expect from sec .",
    "[ sec : physbd ] , and as observed in ref.@xcite , we find that since the detectors have been optimized for the same lepton acceptance and lepton fake rate from jets , the lepton rate from heavy - flavor decays is insensitive to details of the detector reconstruction .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : physbd ] we explain the physics reasons for simulating low-@xmath62 @xmath35 and @xmath57 quarks . in ref .",
    "@xcite we determined that at least 1000 samples of phase space are required to reproduce the interesting angular correlations in phase space for these types of events .",
    "as missing energy plays an important role in these signals , we can not just multiply the spectrum of produced quarks by an average lepton isolation acceptance . instead , we iterate over each point in phase space between @xmath63 and @xmath64 times , ensuring we produce at least 10 events that pass a minimal set of cuts .",
    "this number is sufficient if there are two @xmath35 or @xmath57 quarks that are needed to produce leptons .    simulating any cross section that requires 3 or more heavy quarks to produce leptons ( @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 ) would require at least 1000 times the number of events we simulate .",
    "hence , we can provide only an order - of - magnitude estimate of the effect of these four heavy - flavor processes in sec.[sec : cms ] .",
    "several technical hurdles have to be overcome to achieve the statistically significant and systematically controlled results shown in secs.[sec : cms ] and [ sec : atlas ] .",
    "we have already described our method of iterating multiple times over the same phase space points to give showering an opportunity to generate isolated leptons . even though the detector simulation is technically a `` fast '' detector simulation , over 10 billion events",
    "were required to produce sufficient statistics to describe the heavy flavor decays to isolated leptons throughout their available phase space .",
    "this computation was carried out with 2 cpu years of time on the argonne laboratory computing resource center jazz cluster , a pentium xeon linux cluster with 350 compute nodes .",
    "the large number of events raises a practical issue regarding the total amount of data generated . because of the time involved in generation , and our desire to analyze both angular correlations and different cuts for cms and atlas , we must store event information .",
    "standard pythia , stdhep , or compressed data structures for this analysis would require more than 100 terabytes of storage , a simply impractical requirement . therefore , we write only events that produce at least 3 isolated leptons ( see the appendix for the definition of isolation ) , and store the four - vectors of the leptons , leading jet ( for vetoes ) , and missing transverse energy .",
    "this is the minimal necessary information to analyze the data presented below .",
    "in their technical design report ( tdr ) @xcite , the cms collaboration defines several several sets of minimal supergravity ( msugra ) parameters that have sensitivity to different aspects of susy .",
    "the points lm1 , lm7 , and lm9 are the only subset of the 9 points examined that exhibit a large trilepton signature from @xmath68 decay .",
    "these points assume @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and ( @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 ) are ( 60 , 250 , 10 ) , ( 3000 , 230 , 10 ) , and ( 1450 , 175 , 50 ) for lm1 , lm7 , and lm9 , respectively . the reach for discovery of @xmath68 decays to trileptons is summarized in the tdr , but we follow the more detailed account from ref.@xcite below .",
    "the basic cms analysis looks for 3 isolated leptons , with @xmath40 gev , @xmath74 gev , and @xmath75 ( see the appendix for the method of isolation ) .",
    "events that contain jets with @xmath76 gev are vetoed in order to reduce the contribution from processes such as @xmath31 production and more complex susy processes involving cascade decays of massive susy states .",
    "since real @xmath18 decays dominate the usual standard model backgrounds , events are removed in which the invariant mass of the opposite - sign same - flavor ( ossf ) leptons is more than 75 gev .",
    "cms then performs a neural net analysis with 7 variables to suppress the backgrounds from sm production of @xmath77jets and virtual photon@xmath78jets ( called drell yan in their terminology ) to achieve a signal to background ratio @xmath79 of @xmath80 .",
    "there are not enough details or referenced notes regarding the neural net for us to reproduce the results , but we can confirm agreement for the backgrounds considered .",
    "however , the new backgrounds calculated here far outweigh the ones studied by cms .",
    "as all of our estimated backgrounds are larger than those determined by cms , we explain in detail where our simulations agree and where and why they differ .",
    "there are three overriding observations to keep in mind .",
    "first , each significant background involving leptons from heavy flavor decays , not estimated by cms , is more than 10 times larger than the largest background considered by cms .",
    "second , as explained below , our first benchmark process , @xmath0 includes additional physics that enhances this background .",
    "third , the isasugra 7.69 evolution code used by cms for the supersymmetric spectrum gives mass differences and branching fractions incompatible with the more recent version employed in our work .",
    "nevertheless , we find good agreement with the cms results when we consider only their backgrounds and use their assumptions .",
    "therefore , we are confident that the simulation improvements discussed below are valid and will be useful for future studies .      in order to maintain consistency across processes considered ,",
    "we elect to present results using leading - order cross sections rather than introducing next - to - leading order ( nlo ) @xmath82 factors . while nlo calculations exist for most of these processes  @xcite ,",
    "there is considerable overlap at nlo between final states , e.g. , @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "furthermore , the jet veto will reject some of the higher order radiation that enhances the cross sections .",
    "proper matching between orders is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "since our goal is to establish a direct connection with the cms analysis , we first confirm that our detector simulation reproduces the cms detector simulation for reconstructed leptons . performing a pythia - based calculation of @xmath0",
    ", minus decays to taus , and using the cms @xmath82-factor of 2 , we predict 171 events after cuts in 30 fb@xmath6  vs.  173 events in table  6 of the cms analysis  @xcite . any differences in lepton reconstruction enter 3 times ; hence , this comparison shows that our detector simulation agrees exceedingly well with the cms detector simulation .",
    "the pythia code used by cms for @xmath0 production omits virtual photon @xmath21 production and interference with the @xmath18 .",
    "given that the @xmath18 peak will be removed by cuts , we find that the additional contribution from @xmath17 plus a virtual photon is at least as important .",
    "this result agrees with other work  @xcite in which the importance of the virtual photons is emphasized . in all of our simulations",
    "we include the virtual photon continuum and photon-@xmath18 interference along with the @xmath18 . in the case of the sm @xmath0 contribution",

    "the differences are attributable to the use of isasugra 7.75 in our study vs.  isasugra 7.69 by cms .",

    "however , we acknowledge that there are limitations inherent in modeling of events and simulations of detector response .",
    "these uncertainties are difficult to evaluate quantitatively .",
    "in particular , we note that our sm model cross sections are computed at leading order and then passed through the pythia showering code . accompanying hadronic radiation is generated by pythia , and jet vetoes ( no jets with @xmath166 gev ) are then applied in the analysis , removing some fraction of the cross section .",
    "pythia currently treats events generated internally and events fed into it differently when producing initial state radiation .",
    "the jet veto is very sensitive to the details of this radiation spectrum , and hence there is uncertainty in the overall normalization of the events we simulate . a dedicated study of these differences in pythia should be performed before atlas and cms attempt to fit their measurements of initial state radiation and of underlying events .",
    "regardless of the normalization , this showering issue has little effect on the ratio of leptonic events coming from heavy flavor decays to those from @xmath167 or @xmath2 .    an alternative approach would begin with next - to - leading order matrix elements and a showering code that deals properly with matching and double counting aspects of the radiation .",
    "not having this tool available , and recognizing that it also will have its limitations , we provide an alternative ( and more optimistic ) assessment of the signal significance based on a partially _ ad hoc _ approach .",
    "the cms study finds that , as a result of the jet veto applied in the analysis , the trilepton background obtained from a next - to - leading order computation of the @xmath31 final state is about a factor of 3.6 smaller than one would obtain from a leading - order computation . applying this factor of 3.6 universally to all the sm backgrounds we compute ,",
    "we can obtain an approximately @xmath129 excess in 30 fb@xmath6  for susy point lm9 .",
