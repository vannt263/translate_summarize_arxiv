    "despite numerous observations of giant planets in our solar system @xcite and the extrasolar campaigns @xcite , our understanding of the structure , evolution , and formation of jovian planets remains uncertain @xcite .",
    "largely , the uncertainty is due to the fact that the observations of jovian planets only provide data on global properties , which limits the constraints that can be placed on interior properties .",
    "while future observations , such as the juno mission , will provide more detailed data , additional constraints on jovian interiors can also be gleaned from advances in numerical simulations @xcite and experiments @xcite on high density matter and the subsequent improvements in planetary models @xcite .    even in the solar system ,",
    "the exact composition of the gaseous giant planets is still not very well constrained because the composition of the observable atmosphere is not necessarily representative of the entire planet . following the core - accretion hypothesis @xcite , jupiter and saturn were formed by a rapid accretion of solid material until a critical mass of approximately 10  @xmath2 had been reached , which triggers a substantial gas accretion .",
    "once the envelope is as massive as the core , it even becomes a run - away accretion that stops when all the gas in the nebula has disappeared , after about 10 myr .",
    "this minimum mass of 10  @xmath2 provides also a lower bound for the average metallicity of jupiter and saturn . as the total mass of jupiter ( resp .",
    "saturn ) is 317.8  @xmath2 ( resp .",
    "95.1  @xmath2 ) @xcite , the minimal metallicity is @xmath3 ( resp .",
    "@xmath4 ) which is higher than the solar value of @xmath5 @xcite . but",
    "this is only a minimum value , and for jupiter , the galileo entry probe measured an atmospheric metallicity of 3 times the solar value @xcite for instance .",
    "the dichotomy between a dense core and a h - he envelope is however , at best , only an approximated view of the giant planets as there are at least five different reasons why the heavy element distribution in giant planets is uncertain .",
    "the first one comes from the formation of the planet . during the gas accretion ,",
    "the planet kept accreting additional planetesimals and it is unclear whether they dissolved in the envelope or reached the core @xcite .",
    "the second reason is the possible erosion of the core as proposed by @xcite , which could trigger a redistribution of the heavy elements of the core throughout the envelope .",
    "this possibility has been recently investigated with _ ab initio _",
    "simulations , which predicted that all the dominant species in the core are miscible in metallic hydrogen @xcite .    however , and this is the third reason , the kinetics of the erosion process is very poorly constrained and could be very slow . once dissolved in hydrogen , the heavy elements may not be efficiently redistributed throughout the envelope because the density contrast may be too high for the convection to advect these elements against the gravitational forces . thus , a semi - convective pattern is likely to set in , inducing a gradient of composition in the layers close to the core @xcite .",
    "an other origin of heterogeneity in giant planet envelopes could come from the phase separation of h - he which has been proposed as an explanation of the excess of luminosity of saturn @xcite .",
    "the exact phase diagram is still controversial despite recent work using _ ab initio _",
    "simulations @xcite and even thermodynamic integrations to properly account for the non - ideal entropy @xcite",
    ". however , some experimental constraints should be available shortly using reflectivity measurements in laser - driven shock experiments @xcite .",
    "but if the phase separation occurs in a giant planet , it could also inhibit the advection of heavy elements from the deep interior to the external layers as the convection would most likely be rendered less efficient by the phase separation .",
    "the last reason of uncertainty comes from the possible partitioning of the heavy elements due to the miscibility difference with helium and with hydrogen .",
    "it has been suggested , for instance , as an explanation for the strong depletion in neon in the atmosphere of jupiter @xcite .",
    "we therefore need to have better constraints on the distribution of the heavy elements .",
    "they may come from both observations and more detailed models .",
    "measurements of the gravitational field of jupiter and saturn via the study of the trajectory of their satellites but also via direct measurements from spacecrafts such as cassini and juno can give strong constraints on the gravitational moments of the planet and thus on the mass distribution .",
    "a new field is also emerging : seismology of giant planets .",
    "recent results using planetary oscillations @xcite and more importantly through ring seismology @xcite have started to demonstrate its potential and will most likely lead to additional constraints .     snapshot of a simulation box containing 220 h ( white ) , 18 he ( green ) and 4 fe ( yellow ) atoms at 2000  k and 60  gpa . we used a distance analysis to identify the chemical bonds .",
    "the isosurfaces represent the electronic density . ]",
    "theorists can also help to constrain the possible structures by building detailed models including accurate physical properties of matter at high density .",
    "improvements in _ ab initio _",
    "simulations over the past two decades offered the possibility to compute precise equations of state ( eos ) . recently an updated eos of h - he has been developed by @xcite .",
    "concerning the heavy elements , different eoss have been used in giant planet models ( see @xcite for a review of the common eoss ) .",
    "recent models showed that the heavy elements altered the density profile and therefore the structure of the planet @xcite , as well as its evolution @xcite .",
    "however , these models rely on the assumption that the multi - component mixtures of interest are ideal mixtures with an isothermal - isobaric additive mixing rule . under this assumption ,",
    "one derives all extensive thermodynamic properties of a mixture  volume , internal energy , ...  by adding up the contributions from the individual pure species at a given temperature and pressure .",
    "such a mixing rule neglects all the inter - species interactions , although they may be much more important than the intra - species ones .",
    "for instance , in the diluted limit , a heavy atom only interacts with the h - he  solvent  atoms while , in the ideal mixing approximation , the properties of the heavy species are taken from a system of heavy atoms only .",
    "once the juno mission will have measured the gravitational moments of jupiter with high precision , interior models with various amounts of heavy elements in the envelope and different core sizes will be constructed to match these measurements .",
    "this will improve our understanding of the interior structure and the evolution of jupiter .",
    "one goal of this paper is to make this analysis more accurate by going beyond the standard ideal mixing rule and by properly characterizing the influence of heavy elements on a h - he envelope .    in this article",
    ", we investigate the thermodynamic properties of ternary mixtures of hydrogen , helium and heavy elements  namely carbon , nitrogen , oxygen , silicon , iron as well as magnesium oxide and silicon dioxide  under conditions relevant for the giant planet interiors .",

    "both properties may differ from the properties from those of the pure species at the same temperature and conditions .",
    "they may furthermore be affected by the dissociation of hydrogen .",

    "_ ab initio _ simulations showed that , in the diluted limit , ternary mixtures made of hydrogen and helium in roughly solar abundance with heavy elements can be very well approximated by an isothermal - isobaric additive mixing rule on the volume and the energy under thermodynamic conditions relevant in the interior of giant planets .",
    "it is however necessary to use effective volume and energy for the heavy elements because the dominant contributions come from the cross - interactions with hydrogen and helium .",
    "although these effective properties tend towards the pure species volume and energy at high pressure and temperature , there are significant discrepancies at lower pressure and temperature .",
    "the study of the entropy of oxygen showed that in the diluted limit , the effective entropy is mostly influenced by the dissociation of hydrogen but stays rather constant along the h - he isentrope in the dissociated regime .",
    "if we consider a h - he giant planet with a 2% oxygen mass fraction , the net increase in density is of about 1.5% compared to a pure h - he envelope , for given pressure and temperature .",
    "including the entropy correction , the addition of 2% oxygen increases the pressure by roughly 3% at a given temperature or , equivalently , decreases the temperature by less than 2% at a given pressure .",
    "the effect of the entropy is thus very small and the net over - density is only of the order of 0.1% .    in the case of a two - layer model with an upper layer made of h - he and an oxygen enriched inner layer entirely in the metallic regime , the predicted pressure - temperature profile do not deviate from the pure h - he predictions .",
    "overall , in the diluted limit , the entropy appears to have very little effect on the density - pressure relationship .",
    "we argue that the use of the isentrope properties of the h - he mixture with the effective volume and energy of the heavy elements as described in this article should give a very good approximation of the actual profile of giant planets .",
