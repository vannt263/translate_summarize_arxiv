    "the discovery of fermi bubbles ( fbs ) @xcite has given a boost for studying the interaction of galactic wind and the circum - galactic medium ( cgm ) of the milky way ( mw ) .",
    "they are also excellent laboratories to study high energy physics phenomena in such systems as they produce radiation ranging from radio to gamma - rays .",
    "however , the dynamical and spectral origin of these bubbles still remain debatable even after @xmath8 years of their discovery .",
    "the dynamical models of the fbs can be divided mainly into two categories .",
    "first , agn driven models in which the bubbles originate from a past accretion activity of the mw central black hole over a time scale of @xmath9 myr , with a luminosity of @xmath10 , either via an accretion wind ( agnw ) @xcite or via a jet @xcite from the galactic centre black hole .",
    "second , a star formation ( sf ) driven wind model ( sfw ) in which the bubbles originate from supernovae activity due to star formation at the centre of our galaxy @xcite . based on the star formation rate ( sfr ) at the centre , the age of the bubbles has been estimated to range from @xmath11 myr ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter , s15 ) to @xmath12 myr @xcite .",
    "although the observations suggest that the current accretion rate of the galactic centre black hole ( gcbh ) is @xmath13 @xcite corresponding to a mechanical luminosity of @xmath14 , it has been suggested that it could have been a few orders of magnitude higher in the past @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", infra - red observations suggest that the current sfr is @xmath15 @xcite , compared to the rate of @xmath16 required to produce the bubbles @xcite .",
    "interestingly , a recent observation by @xcite has revealed a molecular ring of size @xmath17 pc at the galactic centre which can potentially harbour a higher rate of star formation .",
    "the spectral models of the fbs can also be divided into mainly two types .",
    "first , the hadronic models , in which the gamma - rays are emitted via interactions between cosmic ray ( cr ) protons and gas phase protons @xcite .",
    "second , the leptonic models , in which the low energy photons ( either cosmic microwave background or interstellar radiation field ) are energised _ in situ _ by high energy cosmic ray electrons to produce gamma rays @xcite .",
    "while modelling the gamma rays requires knowledge of the local cr energy density , magnetic field and gas density , and involves some assumptions about the acceleration processes and diffusion of the crs , the modelling of the bubbles is much simpler in x - rays as it involves only the local gas density and its temperature . from the lack of x - ray emission inside the bubbles it has been suggested that these bubbles are under - dense compared to the surroundings . however , measuring the density inside and outside the bubbles requires a careful fitting of the emission or absorption spectra .",
    "an ideal place to measure the spectra would be the northern polar spur ( nps ) where the shell is x - ray bright .",
    "however , there have been debates over the actual distance of the nps .",
    "early observations suggested that the nps can be a nearby low density bubble created by the stellar wind from the scorpio - centaurus ob association or could be a supernova remnant situated at a distance of few hundred pc @xcite . using x - ray observations , however , @xcite found that the nps feature is heavily absorbed towards the galactic plane requiring a hydrogen column density of @xmath18 few @xmath19 @xmath20 which makes it unlikely to be a nearby feature .",
    "recent observations using _ suzaku _ and _ xmm - newton _ also found that the spectra can be better explained if the nps feature is of the ` galactic centre origin ' ( see section 4.3 of @xcite for a detailed discussion ) . another recent observation by @xcite of the oviii ly-@xmath21 to ly-@xmath22 ratio also supported the ` galactic centre origin ' of the nps @xcite .",
    "also it would be a _",
    "dramatic coincidence _ that the inner edge of the nps traces the outer edge of the fbs even at high latitudes if the nps is not related to the fbs .",
    "individual pointings towards nps , therefore , have been used several times to estimate the post shock temperature of the fbs .",
    "observations by @xcite suggested that the temperature of the nps is @xmath23 kev corresponding to a mach number ( @xmath24 ) of @xmath25 , considering the halo temperature @xmath26k ( estimated from the oviii to ovii line ratio @xcite ) .",
    "this suggests a star formation driven origin for the fbs ( since the stronger agnw would produce a stronger shock with @xmath27 ) .",
    "however , in a recent observation of the oviii to ovii line intensity ratio ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( hereafter , mb16 ) ) found that the sight - lines passing through fbs and the surroundings ( except the nps ) have a temperature @xmath28 k. this let them to conclude that the shock is because of an agn activity at the galactic centre and the age of the fbs is @xmath29 myr .",
    "this differs from other estimates of a lower temperature and a weaker shock , and therefore a longer age of the fbs .    in this paper",
    ", we perform 2d hydrodynamical simulations of both star formation driven and accretion wind driven bubbles in a realistic mw gravity and a self consistent halo gas which is also close to the observed density distribution .",
    "we generate projected oviii to ovii line intensity maps and ratio towards the fbs for a range of injected luminosities and compare them with the observations of mb16 .",
    "based on our simulated intensity maps , we constrain the age of the fbs and the strength of the star formation or the accretion wind/ jet activity at the galactic centre",
    ". we also discuss the effects of conduction and the electron - proton equilibration time - scale on our results .",
    "the paper is organised as follows .",
    "section [ sec : halo ] discusses the choice of dark matter and the disc potential and the hydrostatic hot halo gas .",
    "the simulation details and other code parameters are explained in section [ sec : sim_details ] . in section [ sec : tool ] we discuss the tool for projecting our 2d simulation results into a surface brightness map of oviii to ovii line ratio at the solar location .",
    "we present our results in section [ sec : results ] and finally discuss the implications of the results in section [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "one issue while modelling the fbs is the density and temperature distribution of the galactic halo gas which carries crucial information about the soft x - ray background and also determines the shape and speed of any shock travelling through it . because of our off - centred location , which is @xmath30 kpc away from the galactic centre , it is in principle possible to determine the density distribution of the halo .",
    "however , there is a split in the opinion as to the correct density distribution .",
    "based on ram pressure stripping of the dwarf satellites , the density has been estimated to be @xmath31 within @xmath32 kpc @xcite , whereas , based on the distribution of the ovii and oviii lines , @xcite find @xmath33 with @xmath34 , @xmath35 @xmath36 kpc@xmath37 and @xmath38 kpc , which predicts a higher density at the same distance range .",
    "a probable solution is that the metallicity of the halo is gradually decreasing with radius .",
    "therefore , a higher density is not apparent in ovii or oviii line emission @xcite .",
    "however , there is much to be worked out before making any firm conclusion .    in this paper",
    "we assume that the hot halo gas ( isothermal at temperature , @xmath39 k ) is in hydrostatic equilibrium with the gravity of the dark matter , the disc stars and the bulge .",
    "for the dark matter , we use nfw gravity @xcite , with an added core to ensure finite dark matter density at @xmath40 , @xmath41 here , @xmath42 is the dark matter mass , @xmath43 with @xmath44 as the concentration parameter of the dark matter distribution , @xmath45 is the scale radius , @xmath46 is the core radius . for the disc gravity",
    ", we use the miyamoto & nagai potential @xcite @xmath47 where , @xmath48 is the disc mass , @xmath49 and @xmath50 are , respectively , the cylindrical radius and height , @xmath51 and @xmath52 represent the scale radius and scale height for the disc gravity . to make the gravity realistic near the galactic centre",
    ", we also add a bulge potential of the form @xmath53 where , @xmath54 is the scale radius for the bulge .    the hydrostatic density distribution for the combined gravity , @xmath55 can , therefore , be written as @xmath56 where , @xmath57 is the density at @xmath40 and @xmath58 is the isothermal sound speed at temperature @xmath59 ( for a detailed discussion , see @xcite ) .",
    "however , note that unlike s15 , we do not use a rotating cold disc component as our focus is to study the interaction of the wind and the halo gas , in particular the outer shock properties . the interaction of the wind with the disc gas effects the formation of cold clumps .",
    "these cold clumps , however , will not effect the observed ovii and oviii properties .",
    ".parameters used for the mass model of our galaxy .",
    "the assumed mass for different components are roughly consistent with the measurements by @xcite .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^ , < \" , ]     [ table : run - param ]",
    "since we are at the solar position , @xmath60 kpc away from the galactic centre , which is roughly comparable to the height ( @xmath61 kpc ) and width ( @xmath29 kpc ) of fbs , the projection effects are important .",
    "a special purpose code , called projection analysis software for simulations ( pass ) ] , has been written to project the 2d simulation data to a viewer from the solar location ( assuming axisymmetry ) .",
    "it can also project an 1d profile into a 2d sky map , assuming spherical symmetry of the profile .",
    "the surface brightness along any line of sight ( @xmath62 ) is calculated as @xmath63 where , @xmath64 is the particle density and @xmath65 is the emissivity ( @xmath66 ) at any local point along the line of sight ( los ) .",
    "it can also produce mock x - ray spectra along different loss assuming plasma emission code mekal ( mewe - kaastra - liedahl ) . since our simulation box only extends till @xmath67 kpc , to produce realistic emission maps",
    ", we consider the density distribution extending till @xmath68 kpc , and include a local bubble centred at sun with a radius of @xmath69 pc , density of @xmath70 and a temperature of @xmath71 k following mb16 .",
    "the line emissivities for ovii and oviii , assumed to be in collisional ionisation equilibrium , have been obtained from cloudy - c13.04 @xcite and are described in figure [ fig : oxy - lines ] .",
    "it is clear from the figure that the oviii to ovii line ratio is sensitive to the temperature , making it a very useful for temperature diagnostic in the range of @xmath72k .",
    "figure [ fig : rhot ] shows the evolution of density and temperature for the agnw and sfw models . within the opening angle , they show a typical structure of the wind blown bubble containing free wind , shocked wind and shocked halo gas @xcite . note that , the free wind region in case of agnw is very small and not visible in the density plot because of the colour bar . in a typical wind scenario ,",
    "the reverse shock appears when the wind ram pressure balances the shocked halo pressure .",
    "the reverse shock position can be written as ( see equation 12 of @xcite ) @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the mechanical luminosity and @xmath75 is the free wind velocity , @xmath76 is the background density and @xmath77 is the time . here",
    ", we have assumed the mass injection rate , @xmath78 .",
    "it is , therefore , clear that the reverse shock in agnw will be much closer to the centre compared to the sfw for the same luminosity .",
    "one important difference between the agnw and sfw scenarios is the temperature of the shocked wind . for agnw",
    ", it is much higher ( @xmath79k ) compared to the sfw ( @xmath80k ) , and the density in agnw case is much lower ( @xmath81 ) compared to the sfw case ( @xmath82 ) .",
    "this is because of the following reasons . assuming that the total energy is released in the form of kinetic energy , the density of the free wind at any radius , @xmath83 , can be given as @xmath84 where , @xmath85 is the wind opening solid angle .",
    "the pressure and temperature of the reverse shocked gas are , therefore , given as @xmath86 and @xmath87 , respectively .",
    "this means that a high velocity wind will always create a higher temperature and low density shocked wind .",
    "it is clear from the above arguments that knowledge of the density structure inside the fbs will help to distinguish between the agnw and sfw cases .",
    "in fact , the best fit model of mb16 ( their figure 10a ) prefers a high density ( @xmath88 ) interior of the fbs , which is possible if either sf luminosity is @xmath89 ( sfr @xmath90 ) or agnw luminosity is @xmath91 ( @xmath92 , for a black hole mass of @xmath93 m@xmath7 ) , assuming @xmath94 kpc and @xmath95 in equation [ eq : wind - density ] .",
    "_ this is a consequence of the fact that the agnws are much less mass loaded compared to the sfws . _    in agnw case , it is hard to produce the fitted oviii volume emissivity ( shown in figure 10d of mb16 ) inside the bubble since the emissivity of oviii lines at @xmath96 k is @xmath97 photons s@xmath1 @xmath36 , assuming @xmath98 @xmath36 and @xmath99 photons s@xmath1 @xmath66 ( see figure [ fig : oxy - lines ] ) .",
    "this value is clearly @xmath100 orders of magnitude lower than the fitted one .",
    "conduction can , in principle , increase the density inside the bubble and reduce the temperature .",
    "tests with 1d simulations including conduction ( see section [ subsec : conduction ] ) show that the temperature of the bubble ( i.e. inside the contact discontinuity , which in this case is at @xmath101 kpc ) is @xmath102 k and the density is @xmath103 .",
    "therefore , the volume emissivity can increase to @xmath104 photons s@xmath1 @xmath36 , which is still @xmath105 orders of magnitude lower than the fitted value @xmath106 photons s@xmath1 @xmath36 .",
    "however , we should keep in mind that estimating the emissivity inside the low density bubble is a complex process as it may be contaminated by the shell emission and may not be distinguishable by a simple fitting of a bubble and a shell .    on the other hand , for sfw , the bubbles density @xmath107 @xmath36 and the bubble temperature is @xmath108 k , for which the oviii volume emissivity is @xmath109 photons s@xmath1 @xmath36 ( assuming @xmath110 photons s@xmath1 @xmath66 ) which is much closer to the fitted value .    in case of the intensity ratio between oviii and ovii lines ,",
    "the comparison becomes non - trivial as the los may consist of gas at different temperatures and therefore can have different line ratios compared to a single temperature medium . for direct comparison with the observations ,",
    "it is necessary to consider the effects of any intervening or background medium .",
    "we , therefore , use our projection software pass to produce the line intensity maps including the effects of the local bubble and the halo medium extending till @xmath111 kpc as explained in section [ subsec : pass ] .    while producing line emission maps , it is necessary to know the age of the fbs because the forward shock velocity and hence the shocked halo temperature depends on time as @xmath112 where , the symbols have same meanings as in equation [ eq : r_rs ] .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to know the region where the gamma - rays are produced",
    ". it could either be the forward shock or the reverse shock @xcite or the contact discontinuity @xcite or the region within the contact discontinuity @xcite .",
    "here , we follow @xcite and assume that the gamma - rays originate from the region within the contact discontinuity . therefore , we , set the age of fbs when the contact discontinuity reaches latitude @xmath113 ( height of the fbs ) .",
    "since the forward shock radius @xmath114 , this age of the fbs is different for different luminosities and is shown in the corresponding panels in figure [ fig : oxy - ratio ] .    figure [ fig : oxy - ratio ] shows the oviii to ovii line ratio maps for agnw ( top panel ) and sfw ( bottom panel ) models obtained at the age of the fbs ( as explained above ) for different luminosities .",
    "it shows that the line ratio is highest on the top of the bubble where the shock is the strongest and becomes lower on the either sides where the shock is weaker , a typical behaviour for a bow shock .",
    "notice that in some cases the emission forms a shell - like feature , this is because the low density interior does not contribute much to the line ratio and most of the emission comes from the shell - like shocked halo gas .    for a better comparison with the observed data , in figure [ fig : hist ] , we also plot histograms of the oviii to ovii line ratios for different mechanical luminosities and injection scenarios . in this figure",
    "we intentionally excluded all the loss that have line ratio less than 0.3 to avoid contamination from the halo gas .",
    "it is clear from the above figures that only @xmath115 in case of sfw and @xmath116 in case of agnw match the observed line ratio .",
    "a higher ( lower ) luminosity in either case produces a line ratio that is more ( less ) than the observed ones .",
    "we , therefore , can constrain the mechanical luminosity of the source of the fbs to be @xmath115 for the star formation scenario and @xmath116 for the accretion wind scenario . however , for such low luminosity agn , the wind is not properly thermalised and the morphology of the contact discontinuity differs from the observed shape of fbs .",
    "the post shock temperature for the sf case corresponds to @xmath117 k , whereas , for the agnw case , the temperature is @xmath118k at @xmath119 axis and falling rapidly to @xmath120 k at an angle of @xmath121 from the rotation axis .",
    "this estimate of temperature is consistent with the measurements by @xcite at the nps .",
    "the similarity of the nps temperature to the other parts of the fbs is another",
    "_ dramatic coincidence _ that has to be explained if the nps is not related to the fbs .",
    "so far in our simulations we have not considered cosmic ray or magnetic pressure on the dynamics of the gas .",
    "however , it has been shown that the cosmic ray pressure and the magnetic pressure can contribute approximately half of the thermal energy of the galactic wind @xcite .",
    "therefore , the required energy solely from star formation process to drive the fbs is @xmath122 , which corresponds to @xmath6 consistent with the estimates by @xcite .",
    "the estimated mechanical luminosity required only from a sfw wind is , however , dependent on the fraction of the thermal energy in crs and in the magnetic field .",
    "one point to notice in figure [ fig : oxy - ratio ] is that the line ratio is enhanced beyond the edge of the fbs ( extended till @xmath123 in latitude and @xmath124 in longitude ) .",
    "interestingly , such an extended emission ( till @xmath125 in both longitude and latitude ) in oviii intensity and the oviii to ovii line ratio is also noticed in the observations ( see figure 4 and 6 of mb16 ) .",
    "we speculate that this extended emission can be an indication of the forward shock travelling through the circumgalacitc medium .",
    "conduction also can effect the dynamics and the density and temperature profiles of the bubble .",
    "we , therefore , use isotropic conduction module given in pluto .",
    "the heat flux is calculated as @xmath126 where , @xmath127 is the classical thermal conduction flux . in cases where the temperature gradient is very large , the above equation also takes care of the saturation effects by including @xmath128 , where , @xmath129 and @xmath130 is the isothermal sound speed .",
    "the effects of conduction are , therefore , more in the case of agnw because of the high temperature compared to the sfw case .",
    "however , incorporation of the thermal conduction in agnw runs makes the structure of the outer shock highly elongated along the @xmath131 axis and forms a very thin jet like feature . in reality",
    ", conduction can get suppressed due to the presence of magnetic field .",
    "a proper treatment will require incorporation of anisotropic conduction which is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "instead , we present one - dimensional test runs with / without conduction to understand the effects of conduction . however , we alert the reader that these runs should be taken only as indicative of the actual situation .",
    "moreover , electrons and protons may not have the same temperature behind the shock , as the coulomb interaction time - scale between the two can be long , as discussed in section [ subsec : e - i ] .    figure [ fig :",
    "conduction ] shows the 1d runs with / without conduction .",
    "the upper panel shows the runs for agnw and the lower panel shows the runs for sfw for a mechanical luminosity @xmath132 at 20 myr .",
    "the density and temperature profiles for the sfw case show little variation if conduction is present .",
    "the effects are large in case of agnw because of the large temperature inside the bubble .",
    "although the outer shock structure remains almost same , the structure of the density and temperature inside the contact discontinuity ( @xmath101 kpc ) changes by almost two orders of magnitude . to compare the integrated line intensity ratio , we put these 1d bubbles at the galactic centre and produce the line intensity maps as shown by the colour contours in middle ( without conduction ) and right panel ( with conduction ) of figure [ fig : conduction ] .",
    "the contours show little variation in the line intensity ratio even if conduction is included .",
    "this is because the contribution to the line intensity mainly comes from the outer shock which remains almost unaffected by the conduction .",
    "therefore , the line intensity maps presented in figure [ fig : oxy - ratio ] are likely to be unaffected by conduction .",
    "one aspect , however , immediately improves in case of agnw is the oviii emissivity inside the contact discontinuity . as mentioned earlier , conduction can increase the oviii emissivity in this case to @xmath133 photons s@xmath1 @xmath36 .",
    "the exact value however depends on the definition of the bubble i.e. the region where the gamma - ray emission is generated .",
    "this will involve careful modelling of the diffusion of cr particles in this scenario .",
    "also , notice that the effects of conduction have been overestimated in these simulations .",
    "presence of the magnetic field will decrease the effects of conduction .",
    "however , a simple estimate of the average oviii emissivity in the region within the outer shock shows that the average emissivity is @xmath134 photons s@xmath1 @xmath36 in all the cases i.e with / without conduction in agnw / sfw cases .",
    "since we are looking at projected emission , even the bubble region emits significantly in oviii because of the outer shock along the sightline .",
    "therefore , it is difficult to distinguish between agnw and sfw using the oviii emissivity fitted by mb16 .",
    "[ eq : conduction ] assumes that electrons and protons have the same temperature .",
    "this assumption is valid only when the electron - proton energy exchange time due to coulomb collisions is short enough .",
    "this time - scale is ( using eq . 5 - 31 in @xcite ) , @xmath135 where , @xmath136 is the electron temperature in the units of @xmath137 k and @xmath64 is the proton / electron number density .",
    "the corresponding length scale required to attain equilibrium is @xmath138 pc for @xmath139 km s@xmath1 ( @xmath140 is the flow velocity ) .",
    "thus , for the outer shock density and temperature ( for both sfw and agnw scenarios ) @xmath141 is shorter than the age of fbs , and therefore the electron and proton temperature behind the outer shock can be treated as equal .    for the much stronger reverse shock in the agnw scenario ( top - left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : conduction ] ) , the post - shock temperature is @xmath142 k and density is @xmath143 @xmath36 . the electron - proton energy exchange time for these parameters is @xmath144 myr ! for the sfw scenario ( top - left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : conduction ] ) @xmath141 is @xmath145 myr , and even here the assumption of equal electron and proton temperature is only marginally valid .",
    "thus the strong reverse shock is in the collisionless regime , and the electron temperature is expected to be much smaller than the proton temperature ( e.g. , see fig . 2 in @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the effects of thermal conduction are exaggerated in the top panels of figure [ fig : conduction ] , and in reality the density in the bubble ( particularly for the agnw scenario ) may be closer to the case without conduction .    for a strong outer shock ( @xmath146 , representative of a high luminosity wind ) the forward shock temperature can become @xmath147 k for which @xmath148 myr ( eq . [ eq : t_eq ] ) . in such a case",
    ", the electrons are expected to be much cooler than the protons and , therefore , the outer shock strength may be underestimated .",
    "we can estimate the maximum luminosity for which our analysis , which hinges on equal electron and proton temperature , of the outer shock strength is valid .",
    "the outer shock temperature for a mechanical luminosity @xmath74 can be written as @xmath149 where , @xmath150 and @xmath151 is the time in units of myr which is given by @xmath152 here , @xmath153 kpc is the outer shock radius .",
    "therefore , we can write eq . [ eq : t_eq ] as @xmath154 now , for the electron and proton temperature to be equal , @xmath155 , which means @xmath156 therefore , our analysis of the outer shock strength is valid for @xmath157 . a higher mechanical luminosity ( @xmath158 ) winds can , in principle , have a lower electron temperature at the outer shock and produce oviii / ovii line intensity similar to the low luminosity winds .",
    "however , it is well known for accretion power that the black holes do not produce mechanical energy @xmath159 of @xmath160 @xcite . for the gcbh , this limits the maximum available mechanical energy to be @xmath161 .",
    "therefore , our estimate of a weak outer shock strength is the only possible solution for explaining the oviii to ovii line ratio .      in case of a sfw",
    ", the obtained mechanical luminosity ( @xmath162 ) corresponds to a sfr@xmath6 ( see equation [ eq : mech - l ] ) . notice that this value is slightly larger compared to the observations by @xcite , who found sfr @xmath163",
    "however , recent discovery of a @xmath17 pc molecular ring can , in principle , host a higher sfr . also , note that the required rate of sfr depends on the exact amount of cr and magnetic energy density inside the bubbles .    on the other hand ,",
    "linear polarisation of @xmath164 ghz emission , and ir and x - ray variability of the sgr a@xmath165 suggests that the current accretion rate of the gcbh is @xmath166 @xcite , which corresponds to a mechanical luminosity of @xmath167 , assuming an efficiency factor of @xmath168 ( see section [ sec : intro ] ) .",
    "however , in order to explain the x - ray luminosity around the sgr a@xmath165 , it has been suggested that the past accretion rate of the gcbh could have been @xmath169 higher than the present day accretion rate @xcite .",
    "this means that the gcbh mechanical luminosity was @xmath170 .",
    "although there is a large uncertainty in the past mechanical luminosity , it is surprisingly close the required rate of @xmath171 .",
    "also , we must note that the black hole activity is highly variable in time and it is the average mechanical luminosity that should be considered .",
    "one issue with such a low luminosity agnw , however , remains .",
    "it is not able to produce the observed bubble morphology and creates a much elongated bubble structure than observed .    in this paper , though we constrain the mechanical luminosity for the source driving the fbs , the degeneracy between the sfw and the agnw models still remains .",
    "one way to distinguish between these two models is probably the kinematics of the hot gas inside the bubbles . as noted by @xcite , the velocity range of the hot wind for sfw",
    "can be @xmath172 .",
    "however , in case of agnw , this velocity range will be much higher .",
    "another way is to measure the temperature along the outer edge of the fbs . in agnw case ,",
    "the outer shock is relatively more anisotropic than the sfw case .",
    "this is because the agnw is completely kinetic energy driven and has a large velocity anisotropy perpendicular to the disc thus producing a strong bow shock and , therefore , producing a somewhat anisotropic shock temperature .",
    "the sfw , on the other hand , has a large fraction of energy in the form of internal energy and hence the outer shock structure is more isotropic ( see figure [ fig : rhot ] ) .",
    "however , one must note that measuring the temperature along the edge of the fbs using the oviii to ovii line ratio is likely to be contaminated by the detailed structure of the mw halo gas as the contribution from the background halo gas is non - negligible .",
    "we have explored different driving mechanisms to inflate the fbs : one , a central black hole driven wind ( agnw ) , and second , a star formation driven wind ( sfw ) .",
    "the winds have been launched at the galactic centre and have been allowed to propagate through a realistic distribution of the mw halo gas .",
    "we compare our numerical simulations of sne and agn wind models with the best fit model of @xcite .",
    "we find that irrespective of the driving mechanism - agnw or sfw , the total luminosity required to produce the observed oviii to ovii line ratio is @xmath173 .",
    "the given luminosity also constrains the age of the fbs to be @xmath174 myr .",
    "the shocked halo temperature is estimated to be @xmath2 k in most of the forward shock . for a weak shock travelling through a @xmath3 k halo gas",
    ", this temperature would correspond to a shock velocity of @xmath4 .",
    "this value is slightly lower compared to the estimates by @xcite who found the temperature to be @xmath28k based on the same data .",
    "our temperature estimate is , however , consistent with the temperature measurements by @xcite and @xcite at the nps , which indicates that the nps has likely originated from the same activity that gave rise to the fbs .",

    "<S> our results suggest that independent of the driving mechanisms , a low luminosity ( @xmath0 erg s@xmath1 ) energy injection best reproduces the observed line ratio for which the shock temperature is @xmath2 k. assuming the galactic halo temperature to be @xmath3k , we estimate the shock velocity to be @xmath4 km s@xmath1 . </S>",
