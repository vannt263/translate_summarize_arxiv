    "why are new calculations of standard solar models of interest ? after all , solar models have been used to calculate neutrino fluxes since 1962 ( bahcall , fowler , iben , & sears 1963 ) and solar atmospheres have been used to calculate p - mode oscillation frequencies since 1970 ( ulrich 1970 ; leibacher & stein 1971 ) . over the past four decades , the accuracy with which solar models are calculated has been steadily refined as the result of increased observational and experimental information about the input parameters ( such as nuclear reaction rates and the surface of abundances of different elements ) , more accurate calculations of constituent quantities ( such as radiative opacity and equation of state ) , the inclusion of new physical effects ( such as element diffusion ) , and the development of faster computers and more precise stellar evolution codes .",
    "solar models nevertheless remain at the frontiers of two different scientific disciplines , solar neutrino studies and helioseismology . in an era in which many major laboratory studies are underway to study neutrino oscillations with the aid of very long baselines , @xmath1 km , between accelerator and detector ,",
    "solar neutrinos have a natural advantage , with a baseline of @xmath2 km ( pontecorvo 1968 ) .",
    "in addition , solar neutrinos provide unique opportunities for studying the effects of matter upon neutrino propagation , the so - called msw effect ( wolfenstein 1978 ; mikheyev & smirnov 1985 ) , since on their way to terrestrial detectors they pass through large amounts of matter in the sun and , at night , also in the earth .",
    "the connection with ongoing solar neutrino research imposes special requirements on authors carrying out the most detailed solar modeling .",
    "precision comparisons between neutrino measurements and solar predictions are used by many physicists to refine the determination of neutrino parameters and to test different models of neutrino propagation .",
    "since the neutrino experiments and the associated analysis of solar neutrino data are refined at frequent intervals , it is appropriate to reevaluate and refine the solar model predictions as improvements are made in the model input parameters , calculational techniques , and descriptions of the microscopic and macroscopic physics .    in this paper",
    ", we provide new information about the total solar neutrino fluxes and the predicted neutrino event rates for a set of standard and non - standard solar models . using the best - available standard solar model , we also present the calculated radial dependence of the production rate for each of the important solar neutrino fluxes .",
    "we publish for the first time the results of a precision calculation with the standard solar model of the electron density throughout the sun , from the innermost regions of the solar core to the solar atmosphere .",
    "we also present for the first time a detailed calculation of the radial profile of the number density of scatterers of sterile neutrinos .",
    "these quantities are important for precision studies of neutrino oscillations using solar neutrinos .",
    "we also provide detailed predictions for the time evolution of some of the important solar characteristics such as the depth and mass of the solar convective zone , the radius and the luminosity of the sun , the central temperature , density , pressure , and hydrogen mass fraction , as well as the temperature , density , pressure , and radiative opacity at the base of the convective zone .",
    "as far as we know , these are the first detailed results submitted for publication on the time evolution of many of these quantities",
    ". some of the calculated time dependences may be subject to observational tests .    at the present writing ,",
    "the sun remains the only main - sequence star for which p - mode oscillations have been robustly detected .",
    "thus only for the sun can one measure precisely tens of thousands of the eigenfrequencies for stellar pressure oscillations .",
    "the comparison between the sound speeds and pressures derived from the observed p - mode frequencies and those calculated with standard solar models has provided a host of accurate measurements of the interior of the nearest star .",
    "the solar quantities determined by helioseismology include the sound velocity and density as a function of solar radius , the depth of the convective zone , the interior rotation rate , and the surface helium abundance .",
    "the excellent agreement between the helioseismological observations and the solar model calculations has shown that the large discrepancies between solar neutrino measurements and solar model calculations can not be due to errors in the solar models ( cf .",
    "figure  [ fig : diffbp00best ] ) .    in this paper , we present a refined comparison between our best standard solar model and measurements of the solar sound speeds obtained using oscillation data from a number of different sources .",
    "we use a combination of data from the lowl instrument and the bison network , two sets of data from the golf instrument , as well as data from the gong network and the mdi instrument .",
    "we describe in the following paragraph the organization of this paper .",
    "but , since this paper contains a lot of information on disparate topics , we recommend that the reader first turn to the final section ,   [ sec : discussion ] , and peruse our summary and discussion of the main new results .",
    "section  [ sec : discussion ] may help the reader decide which sections of the paper the reader wants to read ( or to skip ) .",
    "the different sections are written so that they can be read more or less independently .",
    "section  [ sec : standard ] defines the slightly - improved standard solar model and describes the numerical tables that present details of the contemporary characteristics of the standard model .",
    "section  [ sec : timedependences ] describes the main sequence time dependences of some of the most important characteristics of the standard model .",
    "we present in this section the time evolution of the solar radius and luminosity , the properties of the convective zone , and the physical characteristics of the center of the sun .",
    "we discuss solar properties from the initial age main sequence to an age of 8 billion years .",
    "section  [ sec : variantdeviant ] defines and compares the physical characteristics of seven variant standard models and four deviant ( deficient ) solar models , which together with the standard model make up a set of twelve models whose neutrino fluxes we evaluate in this paper .",
    "we previously used a subset of nine of these models to test the robustness of helioseismological inversions ( basu , pinsonneault , & bahcall 2000 , hereafter bpb2000 ) .",
    "we discuss in this same section two new standard - like solar models with heavy element to hydrogen ratios that differ slightly from our previously adopted value of @xmath3 .",
    "section  [ sec : neutrinos ] discusses solar neutrino physics .",
    "we present the predicted present - day neutrino fluxes for the standard model and for all of the variant and deviant solar models , as well as the electron number density versus solar radius .",
    "we contrast the predicted neutrino event rates with the results of the chlorine , kamiokande , gallex , sage , super - kamiokande , and gno solar neutrino experiments .",
    "we also give in this section the calculated time evolution of the most important solar neutrino fluxes .",
    "section  [ sec : soundspeeds ] compares calculated and observed sound speeds .",
    "we present the results both on a panoramic scale suitable for discussing the implications for solar neutrino physics and on a zoomed - in scale appropriate for detailed investigations of solar physics . in   [ sec : hepluscz ] , we compare , for all 12 of the solar models discussed in this paper , the calculated values of the surface helium abundance and the depth of the convective zone with the measured values for these quantities .",
    "we summarize and discuss our main results in   [ sec : discussion ] .    the interested reader may wish to consult the following works that summarize the solar neutrino aspects of solar models ( bahcall 1989 ; bahcall & pinsonneault 1992 , 1995 ; berezinsky , fiorentini , & lissia 1996 ; castellani et al .",

    "we mean the solar model which is constructed with the best - available physics and input data .",
    "all of the solar models we consider , standard or ` deviant ' models , ( see below ) are required to fit the observed luminosity and radius of the sun at the present epoch , as well as the observed heavy element to hydrogen ratio at the surface of the sun .",
    "no helioseismological constraints are used in defining the standard solar model .",
    "naturally , standard models improve with time , as the input data are made more accurate , the calculational techniques become faster and more precise , and the physical description is more detailed .",
    "thus it is necessary at each presentation of a new standard model to describe what has changed from the previous best model and to provide references to the earlier work .",
    "the reader can see bahcall ( 1989 ) for a general reference to the early work on precise solar models that were motivated by the need to predict accurate solar neutrino fluxes and to make comparisons with helioseismological data .",
    "our standard solar model is constructed with the opal equation of state ( rogers , swenson , & iglesias 1996 ) and opal opacities ( iglesias & rogers 1996 ) , which are supplemented by the low temperature opacities of alexander & ferguson ( 1994 ) .",
    "the model was calculated using the usual mixing length formalism to determine the convective flux .",
    "the principal change in the input data is the use of the grevesse & sauval ( 1998 ) improved standard solar composition in the opal opacities ( see http://www-phys.llnl.gov/research/opal/index.htm ) and in the calculation of the nuclear reaction rates .",
    "the refinements in this composition redetermination come from many different sources , including the use of more accurate atomic transition probabilities in interpreting solar spectra .",
    "the opal equation of state and the alexander and ferguson opacities are not yet available with the composition recommended by grevesse and sauval 1998 .",
    "we have used a present - epoch solar luminosity of @xmath4 $ ] for all the models described in detail in this paper . only for the neutrino fluxes presented in   [ subsubsec : standardneutrino ] and",
    "  [ subsubsec : nacre ] have we used the more recent best - estimate value of solar luminosity , @xmath5 ~=~ 3.842 \\times 10^{33 } { \\rm ~erg s^{-1}}$ ] ( see frhlich & lean 1998 ; crommelynck , fichot , domingo , & lee 1996 ) . the difference between these two values for the luminosity is @xmath6% . for the calculations of uncertainties in neutrino flux predictions , we assume a @xmath7 uncertainty of @xmath8% .",
    "the uncertainty in the predicted solar neutrino fluxes due to the luminosity is an order of magnitude smaller than the total uncertainty in predicting the neutrino fluxes .",
    "for all the other quantities we calculate , the uncertainty in the solar luminosity has an even smaller effect .",
    "the nuclear reaction rates were evaluated with the subroutine exportenergy.f ( cf .",
    "bahcall & pinsonneault 1992 ) , using the reaction data in adelberger et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and with electron and ion weak screening as indicated by recent calculations of gruzinov & bahcall ( 1998 ) ; see also salpeter ( 1954 ) .",
    "this assumption seriously underestimates the charge density near heavy ions .",
    "for example , it is known that a screened beryllium nucleus under solar interior conditions has charge density near the nucleus @xmath9 ( gruzinov & bahcall 1997 ; brown & sawyer 1997 ; all quantum mechanical calculations give similar results , see bahcall 1962 , and iben , kalata , & schwartz 1967 ) . ] .",
    "the model incorporates helium and heavy element diffusion using the exportable diffusion subroutine of thoul ( cf .",

    ". an independent and detailed treatment of diffusion by turcotte et al .",
    "( 1998b ) yields results for the impact of diffusion on the computed solar quantities that are very similar to those obtained here .",
    "we have used the most recent and detailed calculation ( marcucci et al .",
    "2000a ) for the @xmath10-factor for the @xmath11he(p,@xmath12  +  @xmath13)@xmath14he reaction : @xmath15 kev b , which is a factor of @xmath16 times larger than the previous best - estimate [ see   [ subsubsec : uncertainties ] , bahcall & krastev ( 1998 ) , and marcucci et al .",
    "( 2000b ) for a discussion of the large uncertainties in calculating @xmath17 . for values of @xmath18 in the range of current estimates ,",
    "the assumed rate of the @xmath19 reaction only affects in a noticeable way the calculated flux of @xmath19 neutrinos and does not affect the calculated fluxes of other neutrinos , the helioseismological characteristics , or other physical properties of the sun .    for the standard model ,",
    "the evolutionary calculations were started at the main - sequence stage .",
    "the model has a radius of 695.98 mm .",
    "we do not study the pre - main sequence evolution in our standard model .",
    "this epoch has been discussed in the classical work of iben ( 1965 ) and the effects of pre - main sequence have been shown by bahcall & glasner ( 1994 ) to be unimportant for solar neutrino calculations ( see also the thorough discussion by morel , provost , & berthomieu 2000 ) .",
    "we do consider one pre - main sequence model , which differs very little from the corresponding model started at the zero - age main sequence .",
    "the ratio of heavy elements to hydrogen ( @xmath3 ) at the surface of the model is 0.0230 , which was chosen to be consistent with the value obtained by grevesse & sauval ( 1998 ) .",
    "a krishna - swamy @xmath20-@xmath21 relationship for the atmosphere was used .",
    "we adopt a solar luminosity @xmath22 and a solar age of @xmath23  yr ( see bahcall & pinsonneault 1995 ) .",
    "in the course of our recent analysis of systematic uncertainties in helioseismological inversions ( basu , pinsonneault , & bahcall 2000 ) , we uncovered an error in the code we wrote for the interpolation of the opal 95 opacities .",
    "the edges of opacity tables were flagged by zero opacity values ; unfortunately , there were some interpolation problems associated with the occurrence of zero values inside the table .",
    "this problem occurred because the logarithm of the opacity , which is what we were tabulating , can actually be zero .",
    "the interpolation error caused small changes in the opacity which produced errors in the sound speed of order @xmath24% for solar radii in the range of @xmath25 to @xmath26 and errors of order @xmath27% in the @xmath28b neutrino flux ( with smaller errors for other neutrino fluxes ) .",
    "in the following sections , we will point out more specifically the changes in the neutrino predictions and in the sound velocities that are produced by correcting this interpolation error .",
    "these changes are particularly apparent in the comparison of figure  [ fig : differences6 ] and figure  [ fig : differences5 ] , which are discussed in the helioseismology section , ",
    "[ sec : soundspeeds ] .",
    "the details of the structure of a standard solar model are of importance for both helioseismology and solar neutrino calculations . in the first paper in this series in which we published the details of a model of the solar interior structure ( bahcall et al .",
    "1982 ) , we presented a table with only @xmath29 radial shells ( rows of numbers ) and @xmath30 variables for each shell ( mass , radius , temperature , density , hydrogen fraction , helium fraction , luminosity generated , and the source density of the @xmath31 , @xmath32be , and @xmath28b neutrinos ) . over the years , much greater precision was required by the increasing sophistication of the helioseismological measurements and the solar neutrino calculations .",
    "fortunately , the computing capacity more than made up for the necessary increase in model details .    we have created from the output of the present calculations two exportable computer files that contain in easily readable form the details of our best standard solar model ( bp2000 ) .",
    "physical variables are given at @xmath33 separate radial shells , which is the same number of shells used to calculate the solar interior model .",
    "in addition to the variables cited above , this file contains the pressure , electron number density , the mass fractions of @xmath11he , @xmath32be , @xmath34c , @xmath35n , and @xmath36o , as well as the source densities of all eight of the most important solar neutrino fluxes .",

    "previous standard solar models in this series ( published in 1982 , 1988 , 1992 , 1995 , as well as 1998 ) are available at the same url and can be used to test the robustness of conclusions that depend upon models of the solar interior .",
    "in this section , we present and discuss the time dependences of some of the principal characteristics of the standard solar model .",
    "we begin in   [ subsec : radiusetal ] by describing the separate temporal evolution of the solar radius and the solar luminosity and then discuss the simple relation we have found between the values of these two quantities as a function of time .",

    "we concentrate in   [ subsec : convective ] on the convective zone , presenting the calculated time dependences of the depth and the mass of the convective zone .",
    "we also report the time dependence of the temperature , density , pressure , and opacity at the base of the convective zone . in   [ subsec : centralvalues ] , we discuss the time dependence of quantities at the center of the sun , the central temperature , density , pressure , and hydrogen mass fraction . in ",
    "[ subsec : separations ] , we calculate and discuss the large and small separations of the @xmath0-mode frequencies as a function of solar age . since we do not discuss pre - main sequence evolution , our calculations are not precise for times less than @xmath38  yr ( see morel , provost , & berthomieu 2000 ; weiss & schlattl 1998 ) .",
    "iben ( 1967,1974 ) and demarque & guenther ( 1991 ) summarize in comprehensive presentations the evolution of solar parameters in models that were calculated prior to the inclusion of element diffusion in solar evolutionary codes .",
    "these discussions did not encounter the problem of semi - convection discussed here in ",

    "the occurrence of semi - convection in evolved solar models is discussed here for the first time , to the best of our knowledge .",
    "the onset of semi - convection is triggered by the effects of element diffusion , which was first included in detailed solar models in the early 1990 s ( see , e.g. , bahcall & loeb 1990 ; proffitt & michaud 1991 ; bahcall & pinsonneault 1992 ) .",
    "the process works essentially as follows .",
    "the time scale for diffusion decreases as the surface convective zone becomes shallower ; the metal abundance increases steadily below the surface convective zone . at some point in the evolutionary history , near an age of @xmath104",
    "billion years , the opacity from the enhanced metal abundance below the surface convective zone becomes large enough to make the metal - rich radiative layers below the surface convective zone convectively unstable .",

    "this result in turn causes the convective zone to recede until the metal abundance builds up again .",
    "richer , michaud , & turcotte ( 2000 ) discuss a related phenomenon in a and f stars .",
    "we noticed the existence of semi - convection in our standard solar model only because we made precise plots of the depth and mass of the convective zone as a function of time ( see figure  [ fig : czvsageplus ] and figure  [ fig : czmass ] ) .",
    "the effects of semi - convection were not noticeable in plots of external quantities such as the solar luminosity or effective temperature ( see   [ subsec : radiusetal ] ) . in our current code",
    ", if a region is convectively unstable according to the schwarzschild criterion , then we instantly mix this material with the other material in the convective zone . a more accurate treatment , which allows for the possibility of a composition gradient being established at the base of the convective zone , is required to calculate reliably the influence of semi - convection once it begins to be perceptible in the numerical solutions [ see , for example , merryfield ( 1995 ) , canuto ( 2000 ) and references quoted therein ] .",
    "this is why we have terminated the plots of@xmath101 and @xmath102 at a solar age of @xmath108 yr .",
    "from the zero age main sequence to the present solar age , the depth of the convective zone is approximately proportional to the contemporary solar radius , @xmath109 , i.e. ,    @xmath110    the zero - age main sequence value is @xmath111 and the present - day value is @xmath112 , which corresponds to an approximately @xmath113% decrease in the depth of the convective zone over the age of the sun .",

    "[ fig : cznormalizeprop ] , we see that both the opacity and the temperature decrease slowly at the base of the convective zone .",

    "table  [ tab : fluxesnine ] compares the neutrino fluxes and the experimental event rates for all nine of the solar models whose helioseismological properties were investigated in bpb2000 , plus two additional standard - like models considered here which have somewhat different heavy - element to hydrogen ratios .",
    "the seven standard - like models ( the first seven models in table  [ tab : fluxesnine ] ) all produce essentially the same neutrino predictions ; the spreads in the predicted @xmath222 , @xmath32be , and @xmath28b fluxes are @xmath79% .",
    "@xmath387% . and",
    "@xmath388% , respectively .",
    "the calculated rates for the seven standard - like solar models have a range of @xmath280 snu for the chlorine experiment and @xmath281 snu for the gallium experiments .",
    "the estimated total errors from external sources ( see table  [ tab : bestestimate ] ) , such as nuclear cross section measurements and heavy element abundances , are about a factor of three larger than the uncertainties resulting from the solar model calculations .",
    "we have investigated one possible source of systematic errors , the relative weights assigned to different determinations of nuclear fusion cross sections .",
    "we calculated the neutrino fluxes and predicted event rates using the nacre ( angulo et al .",
    "1999 ) fusion cross sections rather than the adelberger et al .",
    "( 1998 ) cross sections .",
    "the nacre parameters lead to slightly higher predicted event rates in solar neutrino experiments .",
    "however , all changes in the neutrino fluxes and event rates between the nacre - based predictions and the standard predictions ( based upon adelberger et al . nuclear parameters ) are much less than the @xmath7 uncertainties quoted for the standard model ( cf . table  [ tab : bestestimate ] and table  [ tab : nacre ] ) .",
    "the neutrino event rates predicted by all seven of the standard - like solar models considered here are inconsistent at the @xmath389 level ( combined theoretical and experimental errors ) with the results of the two gallium experiments , gallex and sage , assuming no new physics is occurring .",
    "the inconsistency with the chlorine experiment is similar but more complex to specify , since the largest part of the theoretical uncertainty in the calculated standard capture rate is due to the electron - type neutrinos from @xmath28b beta - decay .",
    "the fractional uncertainty in the @xmath28b flux depends upon the magnitude of the flux created in the solar interior . moreover , the amount by which this @xmath28b flux is reduced depends upon the adopted particle physics scenario .",
    "a similar level of inconsistency persists even for the ad hoc deficient models , such as the @xmath56 and mixed models , that were specially concocted to minimize the discrepancy with the neutrino measurements .",
    "for example , the calculated rates for the mixed model are @xmath390 snu for the chlorine experiment and @xmath391 snu for gallium experiments .",
    "the mixed model is @xmath392 below the measured chlorine rate and @xmath393 below the measured gallium rate .",
    "in addition , the deficient models are strongly disfavored by the helioseismology measurements .",
    "figure  [ fig : fluxesvsage ] shows the calculated time dependence of the @xmath222 , @xmath32be , @xmath28b , and @xmath223n solar neutrino fluxes . at the current epoch , the @xmath222 flux is increasing at a rate of @xmath81% per billion years , and the @xmath32be , @xmath28b , and @xmath223n fluxes at the rates of @xmath394% , @xmath318% , and @xmath395% per billion years , respectively .",
    "since the age of the sun is estimated to be uncertain by only @xmath396 billion years ( see the appendix by wasserburg in bahcall & pinsonneault 1995 ) , the age of the sun does not represent a significant uncertainty for solar neutrino predictions .",
    "figure  [ fig : diffbp00best ] shows the excellent agreement between the helioseismologically determined sound speeds and the speeds that are calculated for the standard solar model .",
    "the scale on this figure was chosen so as to highlight the contrast between the excellent agreement found with the standard model and the two orders of magnitude larger rms difference for a solar model that could reduce significantly the solar neutrino problems .",
    "one would expect characteristically a @xmath316% rms difference between the observations and the predictions of solar models that significantly reduce the conflicts between solar model measurements and solar model predictions .",
    "averaged over the entire sun , the rms fractional difference is only @xmath397% between the standard solar model sound speeds and the helioseismologically - determined sound speeds .",
    "the agreement is even better , @xmath398 , in the interior region in which the luminosity and the neutrinos are produced .",
    "table  [ tab : soundspeeds ] presents numerical values for the sound speeds predicted by the standard solar model at representative radial positions in the sun .",
    "all eight of the standard - like solar models considered in this paper give acceptable agreement with the measured depth of the convective zone and the surface helium abundance ( see table  [ tab : yandcz ] ) .",
    "of the twelve standard , standard - like , variant , and deviant solar models considered here , only the no diffusion and mixed models disagree strongly with the measured convective zone depth .",
    "there are small but robust discrepancies between the measured and the calculated solar sound speeds .",
    "figure  [ fig : differences6 ] shows the fractional differences between the standard model sound speeds and the speeds measured in each of six different determinations ( using @xmath0-mode data from lowl1 , bison , gong , mdi , golf , and golf2 ) .",
    "the vertical scale for figure  [ fig : differences6 ] is expanded @xmath342 times compared to the vertical scale of figure  [ fig : diffbp00best ] . as can be seen from figure  [ fig : differences6 ] ,",
    "the differences between observed and measured sound speeds are comparable over much of the sun to the differences between different measurements of the sound speed , but there is a clear discrepancy near the base of the convective zone that is independent of which observational data set is used .",
    "there may also be a less prominent discrepancy near @xmath399 .",
    "the agreement between the bp2000 sound speeds and the measured values is improved over what was found earlier with the bp98 model .",
    "this improvement may be seen by comparing figure  [ fig : differences6 ] and figure  [ fig : differences5 ] .",
    "the improvement is striking in the region between @xmath400 and @xmath401 and is due to the correction of an error in the interpolation algorithm for the radiative opacity ( cf .",
    "discussion in ",
    "[ subsec : definitionstandard ] ) .",
    "the rotation model includes a prescription for element mixing that was designed to explain the depletion of lithium .",
    "the calculated differences between the rotation and the standard models represent a reasonable upper limit to the effects that rotation , sufficient to explain lithium depletion , might produce .",
    "the overall agreement between the sound speeds of the rotation model and the helioseismologically determined sound speeds is slightly worse , @xmath402% rather than @xmath397% , than the agreement obtained with the standard solar model .",
    "the differences between the solar neutrino fluxes predicted between the rotation model and the standard model is typically about @xmath403 , where @xmath404 represents the uncertainties given in table  [ tab : bestestimate ] for the standard model neutrino fluxes .",
    "we conclude that further improvements of the theoretical calculations motivated by refinements of @xmath344 mode oscillation measurements are unlikely to significantly affect the calculated solar neutrino fluxes .            @xmath405 the simple relations as a function of time between the solar radius , the solar luminosity , the depth of the convective core , and the mass of the convective core ( see eq .",
