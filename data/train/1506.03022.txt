    "an individual s behavior often depends on the actions of others  @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon is manifested daily in the decisions people make to adopt a new technology  @xcite or idea  @xcite , listen to music  @xcite , engage in risky behavior  @xcite , or join a social movement  @xcite . as a result",
    ", a variety of behaviors are said to be ` contagious ' , because they spread through the population as people observe others adopting the behavior and then adopt it themselves . in some cases , behaviors will spread from a small number of initial adopters to a large portion of the population , resulting in fads , hit songs , successful political campaigns , epidemics , and social norms .",
    "researchers have examined the conditions under which such global outbreaks occur , especially in a networked setting , where individuals interact with a subset of the population , i.e. , their network neighbors or friends .",
    "studies have linked the onset of global outbreaks to the topology of underlying network  @xcite , including the presence of highly connected individuals  @xcite and small clusters of connected people  @xcite . however , network structure can affect the emergence of global outbreaks in a subtler way . as we show in this paper , the configuration of initial adopters on a network can systematically skew the observations people make of their friends behavior .",
    "this can make some behavior appear much more popular than it is , thus creating conditions for its spread .",
    "networks often have counter - intuitive properties .",
    "one of the better known of these is the friendship paradox , which states that , on average , most people have fewer friends than their friends have  @xcite . despite its almost nonsensical nature",
    ", the friendship paradox has been used to design efficient strategies for vaccination  @xcite , social intervention  @xcite , and early detection of contagious outbreaks  @xcite . in a nutshell , rather than monitoring random people to catch a contagious outbreak in its early stages , the friendship paradox suggests monitoring their random friends , because they are more likely to be better connected and not only to get sick earlier , but also to infect more people once sick .",
    "recently , friendship paradox was generalized for attributes other than degree , i.e. , number of network neighbors .",
    "for example , your co - authors are cited more often than you  @xcite , and the people you follow on twitter post more frequently than you do  @xcite .",
    "in fact , any attribute that is correlated with degree will produce a paradox  @xcite .",
    "thus , if heavy drinkers also happen to be more popular , then people examining their friends drinking behavior will conclude that , on average , their friends drink more than they do .",
    "this may help explain why adolescents systematically overestimate their friends alcohol consumption and drug use  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we describe a novel variation of the friendship paradox that is essential for understanding contagious behaviors .",
    "the paradox applies to networks in which nodes have attributes , in the simplest case a binary attribute , such as `` has red hair '' vs `` does not have red hair '' or `` purchased an iphone '' vs `` did not purchase an iphone '' .",
    "we refer to nodes that have this attribute as `` active '' , and the rest are `` inactive . ''",
    "we show that under some conditions , a large fraction of nodes will observe most of their neighbors in the active state , even when it is globally rare . for this reason",
    ", we call the paradox the `` majority illusion . ''    as a simple illustration of the `` majority illusion '' paradox , consider the two networks in figure  [ fig : net14 ] . the networks are identical , except for which of the few nodes are colored .",
    "imagine that colored nodes are active and the rest of the nodes are inactive . despite this apparently small difference",
    ", the two networks are profoundly different : in the first network , every inactive node will examine its neighbors to observe that `` at least half of my neighbors are active , '' while in the second network no node will make this observation .",
    "thus , even though only three of the 14 nodes are active , it appears to all inactive nodes in the first network that most of their neighbors are active .",
    "the `` majority illusion '' can dramatically impact social contagions .",
    "researchers use the threshold model to describe the spread of social contagions in networks  @xcite . at each time step in this model",
    ", an inactive individual observes the current states of its @xmath0 neighbors , and becomes active if more than @xmath1 of the neighbors are active ; otherwise , it remains inactive .",
    "the fraction @xmath2 is the activation _ threshold_. it represents the amount of social proof an individual requires before switching to the active state  @xcite .",
    "threshold of @xmath3 means that to become active , an individual has to have a majority neighbors in the active state . though the two networks in figure  [ fig : net14 ] have the same topology , when the threshold is @xmath4 , all nodes will eventually become active in the network on the left , but not in the network on the right .",
    "this is because the `` majority illusion '' alters local neighborhoods of the nodes , distorting their perceptions of the prevalence of the active state .",
    "this paper describes and analyzes the `` majority illusion '' paradox .",
    "we measure the strength of the paradox as the fraction of network nodes with a majority active neighbors .",
    "using synthetic and real - world networks , we study how network structure and configuration of active nodes contributes to the paradox .",
    "we demonstrate empirically , as well as through theoretical analysis , that the paradox is stronger in networks in which the better - connected nodes are active , and also in networks with a heterogeneous degree distribution .",
    "network structure also amplifies the paradox via degree correlations .",
    "the paradox is strongest in networks where low degree nodes have the tendency to connect to high degree nodes . activating the high degree nodes in such networks biases the local observations of many nodes , which in turn impacts collective phenomena emerging in networks , including social contagions .",
    "our statistical model quantifies the strength of this effect .",
    "a network s structure is partly specified by its degree distribution @xmath5 , which gives the probability that a randomly chosen node in an undirected network has @xmath0 neighbors ( i.e. , degree @xmath0 ) .",
    "this quantity also affects the probability that a randomly chosen edge is connected to a node of degree @xmath0 , otherwise known as neighbor degree distribution @xmath6 .",
    "since high degree nodes have more edges , they will be over - represented in the neighbor degree distribution by a factor proportional to their degree ; hence , @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the average node degree",
    ".    networks often have structure beyond that specified by their degree distribution : for example , nodes may preferentially link to others with a similar ( or very different ) degree .",
    "such degree correlation is captured by the joint degree distribution @xmath9 , the probability to find nodes of degrees @xmath0 and @xmath10 at either end of a randomly chosen edge in an undirected network  @xcite .",
    "this quantity obeys normalization conditions @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "globally , degree correlation in an undirected network is quantified by the assortativity coefficient , which is simply the pearson correlation between degrees of connected nodes : @xmath13 \\\\ & = & \\frac{1}{\\sigma_{q}^2}\\left[\\left(\\sum_{k,{k^{\\prime } } } k{k^{\\prime}}e(k,{k^{\\prime}})\\right ) - { \\left\\langle k \\right\\rangle}_q^2 \\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath14 ^ 2 $ ] . in assortative networks ( @xmath15 ) , nodes have a tendency link to similar nodes , e.g. , high - degree nodes to other high - degree nodes . in disassortative networks ( @xmath16 ) , on the other hand , they prefer to link to dissimilar nodes .",
    "a star composed of a central hub and nodes linked only to the hub is an example of a disassortative network .",
    "we can use newman s edge rewiring procedure  @xcite to change a network s assortativity without changing its degree distribution @xmath5 .",
    "the rewiring procedure randomly chooses two pairs of connected nodes and swaps their edges if doing so changes their degree correlation .",
    "this can be repeated until desired assortativity is achieved .",
    "the configuration of attributes in a network is specified by the joint probability distribution @xmath17 , the probability that node of degree @xmath0 has an attribute @xmath18 . in this work ,",
    "we consider binary attributes only , and refer to nodes with @xmath19 as active and those with @xmath20 as inactive .",
    "the joint distribution can be used to compute @xmath21 , the correlation between node degrees and attributes : @xmath22 \\\\ \\nonumber & = & \\frac{1}{\\sigma_x\\sigma_k}\\sum_{k}k\\left[p(x=1,k)-p(x=1)p(k)\\right ] \\\\",
    "\\nonumber & = &   \\frac{p(x=1)}{\\sigma_x\\sigma_k}\\left[{\\left\\langle k \\right\\rangle}_{x=1}-{\\left\\langle k \\right\\rangle}\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the equations above , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the standard deviations of the degree and attribute distributions respectively , and @xmath25 is the average degree of active nodes .    randomly activating nodes creates a configuration with @xmath21 close to zero .",
    "we can change it by swapping attribute values among the nodes .",
    "for example , to increase @xmath21 , we randomly choose nodes @xmath26 with @xmath19 and @xmath27 with @xmath20 and swap their attributes if the degree of @xmath27 is greater than the degree of @xmath26 .",
    "we can continue swapping attributes until desired @xmath21 is achieved ( or it no longer changes ) .",
    "a network is not fully specified by its degree sequence and degree assortativity @xmath28 .",
    "in fact , many different structures are possible with an identical degree sequence and @xmath28 .",
    "these structural difference may affect the `` majority illusion . '' here , we report some comparison of selected degree sequences in scale - free synthetic networks .    we generated scale - free networks with some degree sequence and assortativity .",
    "we then used edge rewiring to change network s structure while keeping the assortativity @xmath28 ( and degree sequence ) the same .",
    "existing structural constraints restrict the range of assortativity values that a given degree sequence may attain .",
    "thus there are fewer choices for extreme values of assortativity . figure  [ fig : idseq ] reports the fraction of nodes in the paradox regime in these networks .",
    "identical symbols are for the same value of assortativity .",
    "results do nt change much in cases where structural constraints prevent varying the structure while keeping assortativity fixed . on the other hand ,",
    "the fraction of nodes in the paradox regime can vary somewhat in the mid - assortativity range ."
