    "in the three flavor neutrino oscillation scenario , the oscillations are driven by the two mass - squared differences @xmath1 and @xmath2 and the oscillation amplitudes are measured by the three mixing angles @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 . the leptonic cp phase @xmath6 is still the least known parameter in this scheme .",
    "the cp violation in the leptonic sector may lead to leptogenesis @xcite and can explain the observed matter - antimatter asymmetry in the universe .",
    "further , it is not yet confirmed whether the atmospheric mixing angle @xmath5 lies in the higher octant ( ho ) i.e. @xmath5 @xmath7 45@xmath8 or in the lower octant ( lo ) i.e. @xmath5 @xmath9 45@xmath8 .",
    "although there is a significant theoretical prediction for maximal @xmath5 , recent results from the no@xmath0a collaboration exclude the maximal mixing scenario at 2.5@xmath10 cl @xcite .",

    "has opposite signs for the two hierarchies in the probability expression .",
    "so experiments like dune @xcite , lbno @xcite , hk @xcite , no@xmath0a@xcite , t2k @xcite etc have the potential of distinguishing between the normal ( nh , @xmath11 ) and inverted ( ih , @xmath12 ) mass hierarchies . since the neutrino mass models developed for the two hierarchies are significantly different , a prior knowledge of the mass hierarchy may help in discriminating between classes of models and hence can assist in formulating a more definitive picture of neutrino masses . the neutrino mass hierarchy has been studied in different context in @xcite .",
    "there is an additional complication which may hamper the determination of the neutrino mass ordering - the possible presence of new physics which can give rise to additional cp phases .",
    "the new phases may mimic the leptonic cp phase and lead to further degeneracies .",
    "non - unitarity ( nu ) in the neutrino mixing matrix is one of the possible departures from the standard three - neutrino mixing framework , and can occur due to the induction of neutrino mass through the type - i seesaw mechanism . if the messenger fermions involved are within the reach of the large hadron collider , a rectangular leptonic mixing matrix would be obtained , giving an effectively non - unitary neutrino mixing matrix @xcite .",
    "this framework has a new non - unitary phase which is degenerate with the standard cp phase and affects the sensitivity to cp violation @xcite . in @xcite , this degeneracy",
    "is discussed at the level of oscillation probabilities , and in @xcite a solution is suggested through the upgrade of t2hk to tnt2k .",

    "the true values of the nu parameters ( except @xmath43 ) are fixed at their upper and lower bounds . for each @xmath48 ,",
    "due to the variation of @xmath43 in [ @xmath49 , @xmath50 ] , we get a continuous band of ellipses . from fig .",
    "[ prob ] , we draw the following conclusions :    * in presence of nu , there is a strong degeneracy between the standard 3@xmath0 case and the nu induced case in the estimation of the neutrino mass hierarchy for all the three superbeam experiments .",

    ", there is some overlapping between the blue ellipses corresponding to nh and ih and the overlapping is more prominent in the presence of nu . in t2k , there is more overlap even for the 3@xmath0 case and with nu , the scenario worsens drastically . from this observation",
    ", we can conclude that only dune can discriminate between the two hierarchies at its peak energy even in the presence of nu .",
    "* in the bi - probability plot for dune , we mark a black dot ( magenta star ) corresponding to @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) in the nh ( ih ) ellipse .",
    "this is the point of intersection of the red ( green ) ellipse within the nh ( ih ) nu band which corresponds to @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) and @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "so at the black dot ( magenta star ) , it is not exactly possible to specify whether the value of @xmath48 is coming from the standard case or the nu induced case .",
    "similar effects can be seen in case of t2k and no@xmath0a also .            the effect seen in fig .",
    "[ prob ] can also be verified from fig .",
    "[ event1 ] .",
    "these bi - event plots are generated assuming the peak energy of the three experiments i.e. for dune , e = 2.5 gev , for no@xmath0a , e = 1.6 gev and for t2k , e = 0.6 gev .",
    "but to draw some realistic conclusions , we consider the bi - event plots between the energy integrated total number of neutrino and anti - neutrino events ( fig [ event2 ] ) for the three experiments . here",
    "also , we fix the nu parameters to the boundary values and vary @xmath59 and @xmath43 from @xmath49 to @xmath50 .            * in dune , as in the bi - probability plots ,",
    "the standard ellipses are well separated for nh and ih , indicating the ability of dune to resolve hierarchy degeneracy in the 3@xmath0 framework .",
    "but non unitarity induces a small degeneracy between the two hierarchies as there is a small overlapping between the gray and the cyan bands .",
    "if we consider the co - ordinate @xmath60 in the total events plot for dune , it lies in the overlapping region between the gray ( ih ) and the cyan ( nh ) band , and hence it is not possible to pinpoint the hierarchy near this co - ordinate . on the other hand , a co - ordinate say ( 2000 , 300 ) in the cyan band",
    "is far removed from the standard blue ellipse as well as the overlapping region , and hence any event corresponding to this point can be a hint of nu with nh .",
    "the situation gets worse in the case of no@xmath0a and t2k .",
    "the standard 3@xmath0 ellipses that correspond to nh and ih show a similar behavior as the corresponding bi - probability plots .",
    "the overlapping is more prominent in the presence of nu .",
    "if the leptonic mixing matrix is non unitary , then these experiments are unable to discriminate between the two hierarchies . from this point of view",
    ", non unitarity of the leptonic mixing matrix has to be taken seriously .",
    "* in the case of no@xmath0a and t2k , the scenario is more complicated .",
    "the measurement of neutrino mass hierarchy with ( 3 + 3 ) years of neutrino - anti neutrino data is not free of degeneracy in the standard 3@xmath0 framework . in the presence of nu , the overlapping between the gray and cyan band ( i.e. between the two hierarchies ) increases .",
    "the shorter is the baseline , less is the matter effect and hence the ability to discriminate between the two hierarchies . *",
    "no@xmath0a and t2k show another interesting feature . in no@xmath0a ,",
    "almost 50@xmath61 of the standard ellipse in a particular hierarchy is a part of the nu induced band of ellipses in the opposite hierarchy .",
    "so in that region , any co - ordinate in the standard blue ellipse is not only a part of the standard nh ellipse , but also a part of both the gray and cyan bands .",
    "hence in the presence of nu , a ) there is a degeneracy ( in the same hierarchies ) between the standard and the nu induced hierarchy measurements , and b ) there is a degeneracy between nh ( ih ) in the 3@xmath0 scenario and ih ( nh ) in the nu induced scenario . in t2k ,",
    "similar degeneracies can be seen for a larger region of the parameter space .",
    "both the blue ellipses corresponding to nh and ih lie in the overlapping region between the gray and the cyan band .",
    "so the ellipse corresponding to nh ( ih ) is completely degenerate with the nu induced ih ( nh ) .",
    "all these degeneracies make it difficult to distinguish between the two hierarchies . * in all the three experiments , we observe that the blue standard ellipse always lies within the nu band .",
    "so any point in the standard ellipse , corresponding to a particular @xmath59 , can also be represented by some combination of @xmath59 and @xmath43 in presence of nu .",
    "so in the presence of nu , it is not possible to ascertain whether each co - ordinate in the standard blue ellipse is because of the standard @xmath59 or a combination of @xmath59 and @xmath43 . due to this degeneracy , even in the presence of nu these experiments",
    "may misinterpret a non unitary event as a standard 3@xmath0 event .    from the above analysis ,",
    "it is clear that in presence of nu , all the three experiments are incapable of discriminating between the two mass hierarchies .",
    "dune can tell us about the mass hierarchy when operating at its peak energy as seen from fig .",
    "[ prob ] and [ event1 ] .",

    "* from the bi - event plots for the 3 experiments , we observe that if analyzed at the peak energies of the respective experiments , dune can distinguish between the hierarchies even in the presence of nu , while no@xmath0a and t2k are unable to do so because of their shorter baselines and less matter effects .",
    "if an integration over the energy ranges of the experiments is taken into account , then dune also suffers from a small overlap between the hierarchies with nu .",
    "further , for no@xmath0a and t2k in the presence of nu , there is a degeneracy in the same hierarchies between the standard and the nu induced hierarchy measurements , as well as a degeneracy between nh ( ih ) in the 3@xmath0 scenario and ih ( nh ) in the nu induced scenario .",

    "we conclude that the presence of non - unitarity in the neutrino mass matrix can significantly affect the potential of the experiments no@xmath0a and t2k to resolve the neutrino mass hierarchy .",
