    "<S> we develop a theoretical study of non - terminating hypergeometric summations with one free parameter . composing various methods in complex and asymptotic analysis , geometry and arithmetic of certain transcendental curves and rational approximations of irrational numbers </S>",

    "<S> this kind of research seems to be new even in the most classical case of the gauss hypergeometric series . </S>"
