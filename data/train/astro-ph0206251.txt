    "the enormous progress seen in the evolution of fast computing machines and numerical methods stands as one of the great achievements of the twentieth century .",
    "numerical modeling is now an accepted and widely applied method of research , and in many cases simulations have matured to the extent that they now provide direction to theoretical research . in astrophysics , where the complexity of many of the problems requires large - scale computing for any hope of progress , much of research involves the development and application of reliable and trustworthy simulation codes .",
    "before the scientific community can have confidence in results from such a code , it must be subjected to a wide variety of verification and validation tests .",
    "this paper discusses progress in verification and validation of flash , a parallel , adaptive - mesh simulation code for the compressible , reactive flows found in many astrophysical environments .    the goal motivating the development of flash is to advance the solution of several astrophysical problems related to thermonuclear flashes on the surfaces and in the interiors of compact objects .",
    "in particular , the problems of interest are type i x - ray bursts , classical novae , and type ia supernovae .",
    "these events all involve the accretion of material from a companion star onto the surface of the compact star , followed by the ignition of either the core of the compact star or the material accreted onto the surface .",
    "the global physical phenomena common to all three of these events include an accretion flow onto the surfaces of compact stars , shear flow and rayleigh - taylor instabilities  @xcite on the stellar surfaces and in the core , ignition of thermonuclear burning in degenerate matter , development of convection , propagation of nuclear burning fronts , and expansion of the stellar envelope .",
    "an understanding of these global phenomena requires knowledge of the fundamental physical processes involved in each . accordingly ,",
    "much of our scientific effort focuses on research into the basic  microphysics .",
    "\" these fundamental processes include turbulence at large reynolds and rayleigh numbers , fluid instabilities and mixing , convection and the convective penetration of stable matter at very high densities , thermodynamics in relativistic and degenerate regimes , the propagation of both subsonic and supersonic burning fronts , and radiation hydrodynamics .",
    "verification and validation are fundamental steps in developing any new technology , whether it be a simulation code like flash or an instrument for observation . for simulation technology ,",
    "the goal of these testing steps is assessing the credibility of modeling and simulation",
    ". considerable work on verification and validation of simulations has been done in the field of computational fluid dynamics ( cfd ) , and in the cfd literature the terms verification and validation have precise , technical meanings  @xcite .",
    "verification is taken to mean demonstrating that a code or simulation accurately represents the conceptual model .",
    "validation of a simulation means demonstrating that the simulation appropriately describes nature .",
    "the scope of validation is therefore much larger than that of verification and includes comparison of numerical results with experimental or observational data . in astrophysics , where it is difficult to obtain observations suitable for comparison to numerical simulations , this process can present unique challenges .    in this paper , we describe our efforts at verifying and validating the hydrodynamics module in flash .",
    "we begin by describing the astrophysical problems of interest and the importance of fluid instabilities in the problems .",
    "a discussion of the terminology and methodology for verification and validation ( v&v ) follows this description .",
    "we follow that with a discussion of the challenges found in verifying and validating astrophysical simulations , and in particular , the aspects of astrophysical modeling for which it is difficult to apply recommended cfd v&v techniques . in the next section , we present verification tests and include an outline of a procedure for testing an arbitrary equation of state in the context of numerical hydrodynamics schemes .",
    "the following section contains a comparison of the results from two laboratory experiments with those obtained from simulations , and the final section contains discussion and conclusions .      thermonuclear flashes , events of rapid or explosive thermonuclear burning , occur in a variety of stellar settings .",
    "these events include type i x - ray bursts , classical novae , and type ia supernovae , all of which involve a close binary system in which matter from a companion star accretes onto the surface of a compact star ( neutron star or white dwarf ) .",
    "either the core of the compact object or the accreted layer on the surface of the compact object ignites under electron - degenerate conditions , and a thermonuclear burning front is born and begins to propagate .",
    "these events provide not only fantastic observational displays , but also tools with which potentially to answer several fundamental questions . the light curves and spectra of x - ray bursts can provide information about the masses and radii of neutron stars  @xcite and thus also provide information about the nuclear equation of state .",
    "classical novae can provide information about the abundances of intermediate - mass elements in the universe and the dynamics of white dwarfs in close binary systems  @xcite .",
    "type ia supernovae provide additional information about the abundances of intermediate - mass and heavy elements and play a crucial role as  standard candles \" in determining cosmological parameters such as the hubble constant , @xmath0 , the mass density , @xmath1 , and the cosmological constant or vacuum energy density , @xmath2  ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "x - ray bursts are flashes that start at the bottom of a very thin layer ( @xmath3 m ) of hydrogen - rich or helium - rich fuel that has accreted onto the surface of a neutron star @xcite .",
    "the total energy released by burning the fuel into ash is a factor of @xmath4 less than the gravitational binding energy .",
    "consequently , the accreted material is gravitationally bound to the neutron star and the flash is not quenched by expansion of the envelope  @xcite . instead , fuel in the accreted envelope is incinerated to iron - peak or heavier nuclei  @xcite .",
    "novae result from the ignition of a layer ( @xmath5 m ) of hydrogen - rich material that has accreted onto the surface of a white dwarf @xcite . in this case ,",
    "the total energy released by thermonuclear burning is a factor of @xmath6 100 more than the gravitational binding energy . as a result",
    ", the excess energy leads to an enormous expansion of the white dwarf s envelope , which engulfs the companion star and forms a common envelope binary . the work done against gravity in the expansion of the envelope cools the hydrogen burning layer and quenches the runaway , leading to the establishment of a phase of stable hydrogen burning that continues through envelope exhaustion .",
    "type ia supernovae are thought to be due to carbon flashes that ignite in the cores of accreting white dwarfs @xcite .",
    "models involving either a pure deflagration or a pure detonation have been unable to provide a consistent explanation for the observed expansion velocities and the spectrum of intermediate - mass and iron - peak ejecta .",
    "some type ia supernova models that involve a transition from a deflagration to a detonation have been constructed .",
    "one possibility is a more - or - less spontaneous transformation of the initial deflagration into a detonation as the burning front propagates outward through the white dwarf @xcite .",
    "another possibility is that the initial deflagration dies out as a result of the expansion of the outer layers of the white dwarf . when these gravitationally bound layers collapse back onto the white dwarf , a detonation is ignited @xcite . in either case , these models are capable of accounting for the observed expansion velocities of the silicon - group and iron - group nuclei .    in all three of these thermonuclear flash events ,",
    "the nuclear burning time scale is much shorter than the time scale over which the nuclear fuel accretes onto the surface .",
    "these short burning time scales make it likely that ignition of the fuel occurs at either a single point or , at most , at a few discrete points .",
    "the situation may be complicated by the presence of magnetic fields .",
    "the strong magnetic fields ( b @xmath7 - @xmath8 g ) of white dwarfs and the super - strong magnetic fields ( b @xmath9 - @xmath10 g ) of neutron stars may be capable of funneling the flow of accreting matter onto the magnetic polar caps of the compact object @xcite .",
    "the accreted matter , which constitutes the nuclear fuel , may or may not be able to spread over the surface of the star before ignition occurs .",
    "the three - dimensional nature of this fuel geometry is compounded by the effects of a magnetic field on the thermal and mass transport coefficients @xcite .    even in the absence of a magnetic field , thermonuclear flashes are inherently multi - dimensional because of the complexity of the underlying fluid instabilities .",
    "most efforts at modeling the multi - dimensional nature of thermonuclear flashes have been two - dimensional @xcite , but there have been a few three - dimensional studies @xcite .",
    "recent progress includes a detailed two - dimensional study of helium detonations on the surface of a neutron star that confirmed that a detonation can spread burning over the entire surface on a time scale consistent with burst rise times  @xcite , three - dimensional simulations of thermonuclear explosions of chandrasekhar - mass carbon - oxygen white dwarfs  @xcite , and studies of the cellular structure of detonation fronts in both two and three dimensions  @xcite .",
    "fluid instabilities and subsequent mixing are expected to play a fundamental role in the events involving thermonuclear flashes .",
    "for example , determining whether or not there is substantial mixing between the accreted hydrogen - helium envelope and the carbon - oxygen surface layer of the white dwarf is crucial to understanding the nova mechanism .",
    "mixing of intermediate - mass elements into the accreted layer is critical because otherwise hydrogen burning would be too slow to produce a nova .",
    "furthermore , without this mixing it is difficult to produce the observed abundances of intermediate - mass nuclei in the ejecta  ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "such mixing may occur during the first phases of the accretion cycle or when convection in the accreted layer works its way down to the interface with the white dwarf . in the latter case , convective undershoot may dredge up material from the white dwarf and mix it into the accreted layer @xcite . although some progress has been made on modeling this nova mixing mechanism @xcite , a consensus has not been reached .",
    "another proposed mixing mechanism , which is the subject of ongoing research , is breaking of nonlinear resonant gravity waves at the carbon - oxygen surface @xcite .    in the case of a neutron star ,",
    "penetration into the crust by convection in the accreted layer is strongly inhibited by the large jump in atomic weight between the heavy element crust and the hydrogen - helium composition of the accreted layer .",
    "thus , no significant mixing by this sort of convective dredge - up is expected to occur in thermonuclear flashes involving the surface layers of a neutron star .",
    "some mixing may occur via other mechanisms such as shear instabilities , but , unlike the nova case , the mixing of the inert heavy elements from the underlying neutron star into the accreted layer is not likely to have a significant effect on the evolution .",
    "fluid instabilities and mixing are also expected to play a key role in the explosion mechanism of a type ia supernova . a subsonic burning front that begins near",
    "the center of a massive white dwarf is subject to kelvin - helmholtz , landau - darrieus , and rayleigh - taylor instabilities @xcite .",
    "growth of these instabilities dramatically increases the surface area of the burning front .",
    "this increase in surface area increases both the burning rate and the speed of the front .",
    "the dependence of the speed of the burning front on fluid instabilities is one of the reasons a study of rayleigh - taylor instabilities is a key component in our efforts at v&v .",
    "because fluid instabilities play a fundamental role in thermonuclear flash events and may be probed in reasonably good terrestrial experiments , experiments involving fluid instabilities have been the focus of our validation efforts thus far . in",
    "what follows , after describing the methodology of v&v and briefly describing our numerical methods , we present verification tests and the results of two validation problems a laser - driven shock propagating through a multi - layer target and the classic rayleigh - taylor problem .",
    "the testing step of code development , which involves verification and validation of the numerical methods and resulting simulations , is one of the most important procedures required for successful numerical modeling .",
    "this fact has been frequently overlooked in astrophysics . in our description of v&v",
    ", we take the point of view that the code to be tested is either one under development or an existing code that is being applied to a new problem .",
    "the details of testing the code will apply in either case .",
    "the results of testing will feed back to the choices of numerical methods for addressing the physics .",
    "if a particular method or model fails a test , then another must be chosen .",
    "we note that verification and validation are necessary but not sufficient tests for determining whether a code is working properly or a modeling effort is successful .",
    "these tests can only determine for certain that a code is not working properly .",
    "v&v is a maturing area of study in the field of cfd , and there is a wealth of information available in the literature  ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the fundamental strategy of v&v is the assessment of error and uncertainty in a computational simulation .",
    "the requisite methodology is complex because it must address sources of error in theory , experiment , and computation . because these areas of study present diverse perspectives ( and because v&v is still a developing field ) , it is common to find disagreement in the terminology of v&v  @xcite .",

    "he also makes the distinction between verifying a code and verifying a calculation , noting that  use of a verified code is not enough . \" in our discussion , we will adhere to these definitions as closely as possible .",
    "another term requiring discussion is  convergence . \" in cfd , the term is used in two different ways . ",
    "grid convergence \" refers to the convergence of the discretization error of the numerical solution as the grid size and time step approach zero .",
    " iterative convergence \" refers to the convergence of the results of successive steps of an iterative procedure within a numerical method .",
    "@xcite notes that  inadequate iterative convergence will pollute grid convergence results \" and that the issue of iterative convergence can blur the distinction between verifying a code and verifying a calculation because iterative tuning parameters can be problem dependent .",
    "figure  [ fig : valscheme ] , a venn diagram  @xcite illustrating the parts of numerical modeling , provides a schematic for considering the role of verification and validation in numerical modeling . on the left",
    ", the largest circle represents nature , or at least the part of nature in which the problem of interest resides . the smaller circles inside of nature represent , from largest to smallest , the range of desired validity of the code , the range of actual validity , and the range of the design goals of the code . the circle in the center of the diagram ( to the right of the nature circle )",
    "represents the theory describing nature ( which may be thought of as the model ) , and the circle to the right represents numerical scheme(s ) implementing the theory ( modeling and simulation ) .",
    "verification begins by identifying the purported design goal of the code or code modules , which is represented by the smallest circle in the center of the nature circle on the schematic .",
    "this is the step roache refers to as defining ",
    "precisely what partial differential equations are being solved , \" though the process may require a larger scope . in the language of the aiaa ,",
    "this may be thought of as identifying and understanding the implementation of the model .",
    "verification , confirming that simulations produced by the code accurately implement the design goal of the code ( i.e. the implementation accurately represents the model and the solution to the model ) , may be thought of as confirming the  mapping \" between the theory and numerical method circles on the schematic .",
    "the process requires identification and a quantitative description of the error , and the strategy is typically a systematic study of mesh and time step refinement as is appropriate for finite difference , finite volume , and finite element methods .",
    "other numerical methods such as vortex , lattice gas , and monte carlo methods require different procedures  @xcite .",
    "verification tests are typically simple problems , often with known analytic solutions , that can be used to study the accuracy and convergence rates of a code . despite the relative simplicity of the tests ,",
    "verification is a difficult process .",
    "analytic solutions , which are easiest to compare against , are few and usually are limited tests of the physics . even in these simple cases , singularities and discontinuities complicate the process of verification .",
    "singularities arising from the geometry or the coordinate system should be removed where possible .",
    "singularities inherent in the conceptual model ( e.g. shocks and discontinuities in the flow ) require special attention .",
    "these structures will typically exhibit a lower order of convergence from the rest of the flow , if indeed they lead to a converged solution at all .",
    "an added level of complexity arises in the case of discontinuous flows because not all numerical methods for solving a given set of pdes are equivalent .",
    "different methods handle flow discontinuities differently and/or rely on different ( intrinsic numerical or physically - motivated ) subgrid models . therefore , confirming that a numerical method is correctly solving a set of pdes can also be a validation problem .",
    "test problems , even without analytic solutions , may be devised to monitor conservation , symmetry properties , and effects of boundary conditions  @xcite .",
    "additional progress may be made by testing self - convergence .",
    "self - convergence can be difficult to test , however , and changing the resolution by a only factor of two does not demonstrate a converged answer  @xcite .",
    "further , resolving the length and time scales relevant to the physical problem well enough for convergence may be prohibitively expensive .",
    "also , simulations with complex physics , particularly three - dimensional simulations , may not have resolved solutions  @xcite .",
    "we further note that convergence tests say nothing about the correctness of the answer in that it is possible for solutions to converge to the wrong answer .",
    "verification testing also may include code - to - code comparisons , that is , the comparison of the results of simulations performed with different codes . for these types of comparisons , care should be taken to find accurate , benchmarked solutions calculated very carefully by independent investigators , preferably using different numerical approaches  @xcite .",
    "examples in astrophysics and cosmology of code - to - code comparisons include the geospace environmental modeling ( gem ) magnetic reconnection challenge  @xcite and the santa barbara cluster comparison project  @xcite .",
    "the gem reconnection challenge is a collaborative study of phenomenon of magnetic reconnection , which plays an important role in magnetosphere dynamics .",
    "the santa barbara cluster comparison project compared the results of twelve codes simulating the formation of a galaxy cluster in a flat cold dark matter universe .",
    "both studies performed simulations starting from a uniform set of initial conditions , with the goal of studying how different numerical methods capture the behavior of the system under study .",
    "diagnostics were constructed that were sensitive to the physical processes essential to these systems and robust enough to compare across codes .",
    "the utility of code - to - code comparisons both for finding bugs and for increasing the understanding of the behavior of different numerical methods in complex situations is clear .",
    "this procedure can only be meaningful , however , if the codes involved have undergone other rigorous v&v tests .",
    "as with code - to - analytic or code - to - experimental comparisons , these tests can only indicate possible problems .",
    "code - to - code comparisons can also include consistency tests such as the nightly comparison tests that flash undergoes , which will be discussed below .",
    "validating a simulation requires identifying the key elements involved in the simulations and for each element ( as well as the integrated code ) constructing test problems that have the results of laboratory experiments as the accepted results .",
    "key elements include parts of the code that describe the fundamental physical processes and include items such as transitions to low and high mach numbers , transport of energy by conduction or radiation , transport of energy by advection ( convection ) , source terms ( e.g. nuclear burning ) , equations of state , opacities , and microscopic transport such as molecular diffusion and viscosity .",
    "validation problems tend to be much more complex than verification problems and typically have no analytic solutions .",
    "these problems nevertheless involve phenomena that are sufficiently simple to be studied both by experiment and simulation , and these problems are used to determine whether a particular calculation reproduces the outcome of the phenomenon or experiment .",
    "we note that validation goes beyond purely numerical testing ; it includes testing the fundamental assumptions and concepts that go into a model and probing the range of validity of a model . in the schematic , validation",
    "may be thought of as probing the area of the actual validity circle .",
    "an example that has implications for the problems here is that of compressibility . as @xcite mentions , a thoroughly verified incompressible fluid dynamics code will produce invalid results when applied to a problem in which compressibility of the fluid affects the dynamics .",
    "the situation is more complicated , however , if one considers the validity of applying a compressible code to an incompressible problem ( or a very low mach number flow ) . in this case",
    ", the compressible code may correctly address the problem , but the cfl limit will require a huge number of very small time steps , making the problem intractable and the solution less accurate due to the accumulation of numerical errors . thus incompressible ( or very low mach number ) flow may be within the formal range of validity of a compressible code ( i.e. , the range that is mathematically well - posed ) , but not within the actual or practical range of validity .",
    "the challenges associated with validating an astrophysical simulation code exceed those of validating a standard fluid dynamics code .",
    "astrophysical events are often complex and involve many interacting physical processes , each of which must be tested .",
    "validating any simulation code with laboratory experiments can be a difficult process , particularly if the diagnostic resolution of the experiment is poor , if there are significant uncertainties in the material properties , or if the initial / boundary conditions are not well - defined .",
    "the situation is especially acute in astrophysics , where we are limited to observations of distant objects .",
    "the interiors of stars , for instance , do not lend themselves to direct observation , and , even if this were not a problem , the vast majority of astrophysical objects are too far away to resolve .",
    "observations of thermonuclear flashes can only show the results of the events ( light curves and spectra ) and not the details of initiation of the outburst .",
    "also , the length scales of the astrophysical objects present challenges . flows within stars , for example , are expected to occur at reynolds numbers greater than 10@xmath12 , and terrestrial experiments can not approach such a regime .",
    "in addition , validation testing includes systematic grid sensitivity studies to asses grid convergence error and assess the level of refinement necessary to capture the key physical effects  @xcite .",
    "accordingly , many of the difficulties in astrophysical verification also appear in validation . as noted",
    ", the flows of interest in astrophysics , particularly flows in thermonuclear flash events , involve unsteady flows , and convergence testing is more difficult for these flows .",
    "the required accuracy of validation activities , however , is not generally as stringent as that of verification activities  @xcite .",
    "another issue making astrophysical validation more complicated than cfd validation is the choice of equation of state .",
    "the cfd literature we studied mentions equations of state as possible sources of error , but does not emphasize the importance of choice of equation of state on the validity of the model .",
    "phenomena such as degeneracy and other interactions play a critical role in astrophysics , and the influence of these enter the simulation through the equation of state",
    ". the properties of an equation of state ( e.g. convexity ) are particularly important when using hydrodynamics methods that solve the riemann problem as does the principal hydrodynamics module in flash  @xcite .",
    "considerable effort can go into validating a hydrodynamics code with a known , accurate equation of state , but coupling it to an inappropriate or inaccurate equation of state will invalidate any simulations . also , effort expended in testing equations of state relevant for laboratory experiments will not necessarily improve confidence in predictions made by astrophysical simulations that require another equation of state .",
    "because of these complexities , it seems unlikely that one could ever satisfactorily validate an astrophysical simulation . instead , validation efforts focus on laboratory experiments that capture the relevant physics , with the expectation that the experience gained from these closely related cases builds confidence in the predictions of the astrophysical simulations .",
    "accordingly , a significant part of the challenge of validating astrophysical simulation codes is to find acceptable laboratory experiments .",
    "a good experiment for validation should be a good experiment itself ( that is , it should provide accepted , repeatable results ) , it should adequately capture a significant portion of the physical processes of interest , and it should be diagnosed well enough for a meaningful comparison to simulation .    a final subject to describe in the methodology of v&v is calibration .",
    "calibration is not validation . instead",
    ", calibration is a process performed in order to improve the agreement of computational results with experiments , and calibration does not generate the same level of predictive confidence as validation .",
    "calibration is performed when there is uncertainty in the modeling of complex processes and also when there are incomplete or imprecise measurements in the experiments .",
    "calibration involves adjustments to parameters in subgrid models , reaction rates , and boundary conditions , and it includes assumptions about minimal or optimal levels of mesh refinement that are made in cases where there are not completely resolved solutions  @xcite .",
    "we complete our introduction with the observation that much of what we have said about simulation validation is true of validating any theoretical model of a system , including more traditional analytic models .",
    "the flash code is a parallel , adaptive - mesh simulation code for studying multi - dimensional compressible reactive flows in astrophysical environments .",
    "it uses a customized version of the paramesh library @xcite to manage a block - structured adaptive grid , adding resolution elements in areas of complex flow .",
    "the current models used for simulations assume that the flow is described by the euler equations for compressible , inviscid flow .",
    "flash regularizes and solves these equations by an explicit , directionally split method ( described below ) , carrying a separate advection equation for the partial density of each chemical or nuclear species as required for reactive flows",
    ". the code does not explicitly track interfaces between fluids so some numerical mixing can be expected during the course of a calculation .",
    "flash is implemented mostly in fortran 90 and uses the message - passing interface library @xcite to achieve portability .",
    "flash makes use of modern object - oriented software technology that allows for minimal effort to swap or add physics modules . accordingly",
    ", the development of flash requires development and testing of each module as well as development and testing of the framework integrating the modules . in the subsections below , we provide details of some of the modules in flash .",
    "complete details concerning the algorithms used in the code , the structure of the code , selected verification tests , and performance may be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the primary hydrodynamic module in flash is based on the prometheus code @xcite and evolves systems described by the euler equations for compressible gas dynamics in one , two , or three dimensions .",
    "the evolution equations are solved using a modified version of the piecewise - parabolic method ( ppm ) , which is described in detail in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "ppm is a shock capturing scheme in which dissipation is used to regularize the euler equations .",
    "( see @xcite for a discussion of the importance of dissipative mechanisms . )",
    "modifications to the method include the capability to use general equations of state @xcite .",
    "ppm is a higher - order version of the method developed by  @xcite .",
    "godunov methods are finite - volume conservation schemes that solve the riemann problem at the interfaces of the control volumes to compute fluxes into each volume .",
    "the conserved fluid quantities are treated as cell averages that are updated by the fluxes at the interfaces .",
    "this treatment has the effect of introducing explicit non - linearity into the difference equations and permits the calculation of sharp shock fronts and contact discontinuities without introducing significant non - physical oscillations into the flow .",
    "the original godunov method is limited to first - order accuracy in both space and time because the distribution of each variable in each control volume is assumed to be constant .",
    "ppm extends this method by representing the flow variables as piecewise - parabolic functions and also by incorporating monotonicity constraints to limit unphysical oscillations in the flow .",
    "ppm is formally accurate to only second order in both space and time , but performs the most critical steps to third- or fourth - order accuracy .",
    "this results in a method which is considerably more accurate and efficient than most second - order codes using typical grid sizes .",
    "a fully third - order ( in space ) method provides only a slight additional improvement in accuracy but results in a significant increase in the computational cost of the method .",
    "ppm is particularly well - suited to flows involving discontinuities such as shocks and contact discontinuities .",
    "the method also performs well for smooth flows , although other schemes that do not perform the additional steps for the treatment of discontinuities are more efficient in these cases . the high resolution and accuracy of ppm",
    "are obtained by the explicit non - linearity of the scheme and through the use of smart dissipation algorithms , which are considerably more effective at stabilizing shock waves than the more traditional explicit artificial viscosity approach .",
    "typically , shocks are spread over only one to two grid points , and post - shock oscillations are virtually nonexistent in most cases .",
    "contact discontinuities and interfaces between different fluids create special problems for eulerian hydrodynamics codes . unlike shocks , which contain a self - steepening mechanism , contact discontinuities spread diffusively during a calculation ; they continue to broaden as the calculation progresses .",
    "ppm contains an algorithm that prevents contact discontinuities from spreading more than one to two grid points , no matter how far they propagate .",
    "the ppm implementation in flash is a directionally split , direct eulerian formulation .",
    "the hydrodynamics module applies the ppm method in one - dimensional sweeps across a block of data , advancing the time two steps . reversing the order of the sweep for the second time step preserves second - order accuracy in time  @xcite . in three dimensions ,",
    "the sweeps are performed in the order @xmath13 ( for cartesian geometry ) .",
    "the algorithm uses a nine - point stencil in each direction , requiring that each block have four ghost zones on each side .",
    "in addition , a small multi - dimensional artificial viscosity is added to provide a weak coupling between adjacent rows and columns in the directionally split scheme .",
    "flash incorporates source terms that are operator split with the hydrodynamics evolution .",
    "two of these are modules for self - gravity and thermonuclear burning .",
    "the gravitational module computes the source term ( acceleration and/or potential ) for the effects of the force of gravity , which in the case of an astrophysical object such as a star can not be treated as an applied external field .",
    "the main role of the thermonuclear burning module in flash is to provide the magnitude and sign of the energy generation rate .",
    "a secondary role is to evolve the abundances of the nuclear species .",
    "the gravitational module solves the poisson equation for the gravitational potential .",
    "we have implemented both multigrid @xcite and multipole methods for the solution on our adaptive mesh .",
    "we have incorporated methods for periodic and isolated boundary conditions .",
    "thermonuclear energy generation is typically the largest source or sink of energy in regions conducive to nuclear reactions ; so accurate determination of the energy generation rate is essential to obtaining accurate simulations . calculating an accurate energy generation rate , however , is very expensive in terms of computer memory and cpu time .",
    "decreasing the expense to compute a model requires making a choice between having fewer isotopes in the reaction network or having less spatial resolution .",
    "the general response to this tradeoff has been to evolve a limited number of isotopes and thus calculate an approximate thermonuclear energy generation rate . for example , when studying explosive burning in pure helium environments , a network composed of @xmath14he , @xmath15c , @xmath16o , @xmath17ne , @xmath18 mg , @xmath19si , @xmath20s , @xmath21ar , @xmath22ca , @xmath23ti , @xmath24cr , @xmath25fe , and @xmath26ni is usually sufficient .",
    "this minimal set of nuclei , usually called an @xmath27-chain network , can return an energy generation rate that is generally within @xmath6 30% of the energy generation rate given by much larger nuclear reaction networks @xcite .",
    "even with a reduced set of nuclei in the reaction network , it is desirable to solve the reaction network equations as efficiently as possible because there can be over 10@xmath1210@xmath15 calls to the thermonuclear burning modules in typical two- and there - dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of astrophysical flashes .",
    "@xcite compared a variety of methods for solving the stiff system of ordinary differential equations that constitute a nuclear reaction network .",
    "the results of this study led to the choice of methods included with the standard flash distribution @xcite .",
    "flash includes two equations of state in its standard distribution , a gamma - law equation of state and a tabular helmholtz free energy equation of state for stellar interiors .",
    "the gamma - law equation of state models a simple ideal gas with a constant adiabatic index .",
    "simulations are not restricted to a single ideal gas , however , because the code allows for simulations with several species of ideal gases with different gammas . while this equation of state executes very efficiently because of its simplicity , it is limited in its range of applicability for astrophysical flash problems .",
    "the stellar equation of state includes contributions from blackbody photons , completely ionized nuclei , and degenerate / relativistic electrons and positrons .",
    "a thermodynamically consistent interpolation of the helmholtz free energy ( which satisfies the maxwell relations exactly ) is used for the electron - positron contribution .",
    "this stellar equation of state has been subjected to considerable analysis and testing @xcite , and particular care was taken to reduce the numerical error introduced by the thermodynamical models below the formal accuracy of the hydrodynamics algorithm @xcite .",
    "in addition to these , we are testing additional equations of state and describe below the process of verifying these in the context of the hydrodynamics algorithm .",
    "we have an entire suite of test problems that are regularly applied to the code for software verification . these are standard test problems in the field of fluid dynamics , and many of these problems have analytic solutions .",
    "the remaining problems produce well - defined flow features that make for stringent tests of the code .",
    "these test problems are run on a wide variety of platforms and compilers at weekly or more frequent intervals , and the results are compared to accepted earlier results . for a code with many developers , such stringent testing is crucial for having faith in the results obtained by the code .",
    "the results of the tests are posted , and any deviation of the results from the  good \" previously computed results is noted so that cause of the deviation may be investigated . these code - to - code comparisons ( here the two codes are different versions of the same code ) allow any errors introduced to be spotted immediately and have been invaluable for the development of flash .    as of this writing ,",
    "the test suite includes    * the strong shock tube problem of @xcite .",
    "this test is more stringent than the usual sod test ( described below ) because of the stronger discontinuities across the shock interface and the narrow density peak that forms behind the shock . *",
    "the sedov explosion problem @xcite , a purely hydrodynamical test involving strong shocks and non - planar symmetry .",
    "the problem consists of the self - similar evolution of a cylindrical or spherical blast wave from a delta - function initial pressure perturbation in an otherwise homogeneous medium . in practice",
    ", the explosion is initiated by depositing a quantity of energy into a small region at the center of the computational grid .",
    "the profile and speed of the resulting expanding blast wave are verified by comparison to the analytic solution . * the interacting blast wave problem .",
    "originally used by @xcite , this problem tests the ability of a hydrodynamics method to handle strong shocks .",
    "it has no analytic solution , but since it is one - dimensional it is easy to produce a numerically converged solution by running the code with a very large number of zones , permitting an estimate of the self - convergence rate when discontinuities are present . for flash it also provides a good test of the adaptive mesh refinement scheme . * a wind tunnel with a step @xcite .",
    "although it also has no analytic solution , this problem exercises the ability of a code to handle unsteady shock interactions in multiple dimensions .",
    "it also serves as a test problem with irregular boundaries . *",
    "a shock forced through a jump in mesh refinement . the mesh refinement algorithm in flash",
    "is designed to avoid this situation , but there may be cases when it is desirable to force a jump in the mesh refinement .",
    "such cases may arise from limited computational resources , or from carrying regions where a fully refined solution is not necessary .",
    "the test monitors the ability of the code to handle such a situation .",
    "additional tests , some specific to certain problems , are also regularly administered to the code .",
    "details and results of some of these tests may be found in @xcite .",
    "a gallery of results of verification tests may be found at http://flash.uchicago.edu/ , as well as updates to the current suite of test problems .",
    "as flash develops and new physics modules are added , we expand the test suite to include tests of the new modules that typically involve source terms .",
    "verification testing of the nuclear burning module in flash has consisted of testing the network in use against larger networks and testing flame speeds against speeds obtained from other methods .",
    "results of flash simulations indicate that we match the flame speeds found by @xcite .",
    "complete details of the flame speed verification tests will be reported with the results of a study of flames and flame - vortex interactions @xcite .",
    "verification tests of the gravitational modules in flash include a homologous dust collapse @xcite , a collapsing isothermal gas sphere ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , a two - dimensional problem consisting of gaussian density peaks at different locations and with different widths @xcite , and the jeans instability @xcite . details and results of these gravitational tests will appear in a forthcoming report @xcite .",
    "in this section we present more extensive verification testing of the hydrodynamics algorithm .",
    "the selected problems include tests of pure advection , sound wave propagation , and shocks .",
    "advection problems in one dimension test the ability of the code to maintain the shape of a density pulse propagating at a constant velocity across the mesh , thereby testing the treatment of flow features that move at characteristic speeds of the hydrodynamics equations .",
    "noise generated by a feature will move with the feature , accumulating as the calculation advances , making these sensitive tests .",
    "advection problems similar to these were first proposed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we also consider the advection of an isentropic vortex @xcite .",
    "this two - dimensional problem exposes the directional splitting of the hydrodynamics algorithm to scrutiny .",
    "the sound wave test consists of testing the ability of the code to maintain the shape of a simple sinusoidal sound wave propagating across the mesh .",
    "the problem is similar to the dispersive sound wave problem of @xcite .",
    "we test the handling of shocks with the shock tube problem of @xcite , a simple test of the ability of a compressible code to capture shocks and contact discontinuities and to produce the correct profile in a rarefaction .",
    "this problem also tests the ability of the code to satisfy correctly the rankine - hugoniot shock jump conditions .",
    "we also test the ability of the code to maintain a stationary shock , which further tests the riemann solver .",
    "the principal improvement in these tests over the previously published results is in the application of the initial conditions .",
    "the previous work constructed initial conditions at the cell centers , i.e. point values . for the new tests",
    ", thermodynamic quantities were interpolated via a higher order method to provide the cell averaged quantities  ( see * ? ? ?",
    "this interpolation step provides initial conditions more consistent with the assumptions of the solution technique and produces better results .",
    "most of the tests presented here were performed on a uniform mesh .",
    "verification of applications using adaptive mesh refinement , as implemented in flash , is the subject of ongoing research and the literature of this problem is sparse .",
    "the tests had constant time steps at each resolution such that ( i ) each simulation ended at exactly the same evolution time , and ( ii ) the ratio of @xmath28 was constant across different resolutions , corresponding to a fixed courant number .",
    "the first test consists of a gaussian pulse propagating across the simulation mesh with a constant velocity .",
    "this problem tests the treatment of narrow flow features , which may be clipped by the introduction of artificial dissipation @xcite .",
    "the initial conditions are a planar density pulse in a region of uniform , dimensionless pressure @xmath29 and dimensionless velocity @xmath30 .",
    "the density pulse is defined via @xmath31\\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath32 is the distance of a point from the pulse mid - plane , and @xmath33 is the characteristic width of the pulse .",
    "the pulse shape function @xmath34 for a gaussian pulse is @xmath35 two sets of simulations were performed from these initial conditions , one set with contact steepening and one set without .",
    "the simulations ran for 0.2 time units with a fixed courant number of 0.1 .",
    "figure  [ fig : gaus_cs ] shows density error in the l2 norm for nine simulations of increasing resolution with contact steepening , and figure  [ fig : gaus_ncs ] shows density error in the l2 norm for the equivalent simulations without contact steepening .",
    "the use of cell - averaged initial conditions led to better results than those of the previous gaussian advection test @xcite .",
    "the second test is the one - dimensional propagation of a sinusoidal sound wave consisting of a density and pressure perturbation propagating at the sound speed , @xmath36  @xcite .",
    "the background pressure @xmath37 and density @xmath38 in arbitrary units are 3.0 and 50.0 , and the perturbed density , pressure , and corresponding velocity are given by @xmath39 @xmath40 and @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the amplitude ( @xmath43 ) and @xmath44 is the wave number .",
    "the formulation corresponds to a rightward propagating sound wave .",
    "the sound wave test problem is similar to the gaussian propagation problem except that it tests the entire hydro module instead of just the advection terms .",
    "it has a smooth solution , until the wave steepens into a shock wave , so it should show the correct order of convergence for the entire hydro module .",
    "figure  [ fig : swave ] shows the l2 norm of the density error after the sound wave propagated one wavelength .",
    "the third test is a stationary shock .",
    "this test demonstrates that the implementation of the riemann solver is correct , that is , the rankine - hugoniot equations are being correctly solved and there is no intrinsic numerical viscosity in the riemann solver .",
    "the initial conditions consisted of a configuration similar to the sod problem ( described below ) , but in a moving fluid such that the shock should remain stationary relative to the mesh .",
    "the initial pressure discontinuity is larger than that of the sod problem , with a @xmath45 pressure jump across the discontinuity .",
    "the result after 4 cfl times agrees exactly with the initial conditions .",
    "the presence of intermediate values of the thermodynamic quantities between the two sides of the initial conditions after a few time steps would indicate a failure .    the fourth test is the sod shock tube  @xcite , consisting of a planar interface between two fluid states initially at rest .",
    "the density and pressure discontinuities across the interface produce a flow that develops a shock , a contact discontinuity , and a rarefaction wave .",
    "the initial conditions were @xmath46 and the ratio of specific heats , @xmath47 .",

    "figure  [ fig : sod ] shows the l2 norm of the density error for five simulations of increasing resolution at @xmath49 .",
    "the curve demonstrates the expected first - order convergence .    because the validation tests presented below involve shocks and material interfaces and were performed on an adaptive mesh , it is appropriate to provide a minimal , related verification test for an adaptive mesh . to our knowledge ,",
    "the literature on verifying a block - structured adaptive mesh application is largely non - existent , and even such terms as mesh convergence are poorly defined .",
    "we will address this issue in future work .",
    "for this work , we performed a study analogous to the previous sod test on an adaptive mesh .",
    "the sod problem , with its shock and contact discontinuity , is an appropriate test of our adaptive scheme , which refines or de - refines the mesh in regions in which the second derivatives of hydrodynamic variables ( by default , density and pressure ) is larger or smaller than some threshold  @xcite .",
    "the effect is to add or remove resolution in the simulation .",
    "these criteria are the same as those used in the validation tests .",

    "the final test simulates the advection of an isentropic vortex in two dimensions  @xcite . in our test , the vortex propagates diagonally with respect to the grid .",
    "this problem is chosen because its solution is smooth and an exact solution is available .",
    "the simulation domain is a square , @xmath50 .",
    "the ambient conditions are , in non - dimensional units , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 .",

    "the density is then computed by @xmath61 .",
    "the conserved variables ( density , @xmath48- and @xmath62-momentum , and total energy ) can be computed from the above quantities .",
    "the flow field is initialized by computing cell averages of the conserved variables : each average is approximated by averaging over @xmath63 subintervals in the cell .",
    "for all isentropic vortex simulations , periodic boundary conditions were applied , the time step was fixed and the courant number was approximately  0.94 , and the error was calculated at time @xmath64 .",

    "figure  [ fig : isenvor ] shows the @xmath73 error in density is plotted vs.  the mesh spacing for two cases of the isentropic vortex problem .",
    "the `` default '' case was computed using the code as it is most often used for production simulations : no tuning of ppm parameters or adjustments to the algorithm were made . in the `` discontinuity - free '' case ,",
    "several non - linear components of the ppm algorithm that improve behavior at shocks and contacts were disabled .",
    "contact steepening , shock flattening , monotonization , and artificial viscosity are designed to improve or stabilize computations that contain discontinuous flow features , at the possible expense of increasing local truncation errors and reducing the convergence rate . since the solution of the isentropic vortex problem is smooth these components are not required , and by comparing the discontinuity - free case to the default case , their influence can be examined .",
    "figure  [ fig : isenvor ] shows that the error decreases as expected as the mesh is refined ; power law fits give convergence rates of 2.13 for the default simulation and 2.03 for the discontinuity - free simulation .",
    "the error is slightly higher for the default case on coarser grids , but on the finer grids the default and discontinuity - free versions of the code produce essentially identical results .",
    "we have varied many aspects of these simulation to see their effects on the error and the convergence rate .",
    "we found that while the measured errors varied , the convergence rates were not sensitive to the details of the initialization process ( point - values , interpolation , number of subintervals for estimating cell - averages ) , to smaller time steps ( and courant numbers ) , or to whether or not the vortex was advecting . in all cases the code demonstrated second - order convergence .",
    "the verification tests presented here address only the hydrodynamics module .",
    "great care must be taken in the operator splitting when coupling the hydrodynamics module to other modules such as gravity so as to not degrade the time accuracy .",
    "coupling the hydrodynamics module to non - time - centered body forces , for example , will produce first - order convergence in time despite the expected second - order convergence of ppm .",

    ", we developed a three - part test suite that each equation of state must pass before we consider using it in a simulation . in each part of the suite , multiple calls to the equation of state using forward ( internal energy as a function of density and temperature ) and backward ( temperature as a function of density and internal energy ) relations for a given chemical composition are used to assess the consistency of the equation of state in a pre - defined region of thermodynamic variables ( density , temperature , and chemical composition ) .",

    "the equation of state is the most accurate in the low density , low temperature regime ( lower left corners of the panels ) , and its accuracy decreases gradually as the density and temperature increases .",
    "we note that even for 9 riemann solver iterations , the largest relative error on the domain is never less than @xmath43 .",

    "in general , though , we perform simulations with a test of convergence to a relative error rather than a fixed number of iterations .    in modeling the three - layer target experiments ( see section below ) , we began with a modified version of sesame equation of state tables @xcite . in the original form ,",
    "the sesame table is not suitable for use in conservative hydrodynamic simulations because it only provides pressure and energy as a function of density and temperature ( forward relation ) , while a conservative simulation requires pressure and temperature as a function of density and energy ( backward relation ) .",
    "the latter relation in principle can be obtained by a numerical inversion of the table , but the relation must satisfy thermodynamic consistency and accuracy desired by the hydrodynamic module .",

    "the length of the cu spikes in the experiment was determined by three methods .",
    "the first method was a straightforward visual inspection of the images using as a spatial reference a gold grid of @xmath98 period , located just below the images of figure [ fig:3lay_exp ] .",
    "the second method used a contour routine to try to better quantify the uncertainty in the location of the edges of the spikes .",
    "the third method was done in a manner consistent with the analysis of the numerical simulations .",
    "a @xmath99 section in the center of the images was vertically averaged to produce a single spatial lineout of optical depth through the region occupied by the cu and ch .",
    "the same 5% and 90% threshold values were used to quantitatively determine the extent of the cu spikes . taking the average of all three methods , values of 330 @xmath100 @xmath101 and 554 @xmath100",
    "@xmath101 are obtained at 39.9 and 66.0 ns , respectively .",
    "there are several sources contributing to error in these experimental measurements : the spatial resolution of the diagnostic , the photon statistics of the image , target alignment and parallax , and the specific contrast level chosen as the definition of the length of the cu spikes .",
    "the intrinsic diagnostic resolution is set by the imaging pinhole , which is @xmath102 in diameter .",
    "the photon noise statistics of the image can further degrade the spatial resolution when the number of photons per detector resolution element is small ( see recent reference : * ? ? ?",
    "for the present number of backlighter beams , diagnostic magnification , and pinhole size , the photon statistics produce a signal - to - noise ratio @xmath103 20 , and therefore do not contribute to a further decrease in spatial resolution . the target alignment with respect to the diagnostic line - of - sight is generally within 1% .",
    "since most of the contrast comes from the @xmath86 wide radiographic ch(br ) tracer layer , this contributes an additional 3.5% to the spatial uncertainty .",
    "finally , the specific contrast level chosen to represent the spatial extent of the spikes as discussed above contributes to the uncertainty .",
    "this uncertainty was estimated from the variation resulting from the three methods used to determine the spike lengths .",
    "in addition to the spatial error , there are also several sources of uncertainty in the temporal accuracy of the measurements .",
    "these arise from target - to - target dimensional variations , shot - to - shot drive intensity variations , and the intrinsic timing accuracy of the diagnostics .",
    "the nominal target dimensions used in the simulations were @xmath88 of ch ( ablator layer ) , @xmath104 cu , @xmath105 of polyimide",
    "ch(4.3% br ) , and @xmath106 of crf . in the actual targets",
    ", however , there is some variation from these nominal values , and this variation enters into the quantification of temporal error between experiment and simulations . for the target that produced the image at 39.9 ns ,",
    "the dimensions of the 4 layers are 10 , 105 , 145 , and @xmath107 . for the target that produced the image at 66.0",
    "ns , the dimensions of the 4 layers are 10 , 98 , 150 , and @xmath108 .",
    "the biggest difference between the experimental target dimensions and those used in the simulations is in the dense cu layer , where the experimental targets are @xmath109% thicker .",
    "shock propagation through these slightly different thicknesses will cause a small discrepancy in the timing .",
    "the variation in the drive intensity from shot - to - shot is another possible source of temporal uncertainty . for the image obtained at 39.9 ns ,",
    "the average laser drive energy was 416 j(uv)/beam .",
    "for the shot at 66.0 ns , the drive energy was 421.5 j(uv)/beam .",
    "therefore , there is a 1.3% intensity variation .",
    "the drive pressure scales as the intensity to the 2/3 power , and material velocities scale as the square root of the pressure @xcite , so the velocity variations from shot - to - shot will be less than 0.5% .",
    "shot - to - shot timing variations resulting from this mechanism will be of the same order , i.e. less than one percent .",
    "the intrinsic temporal accuracy of the diagnostics is even better than this , with a typical uncertainty of @xmath100 200 ps . the experimental uncertainty in the timing is therefore relatively small , and is approximately indicated by the width of the symbols used in the figure ( described below ) that compares the experimental results to the simulation results .",
    "the simulation models the experiment with a similar three - layer arrangement .",
    "the three materials were cu , polyimide ch , and c with the same densities as the three layers of the actual target .",
    "the simulation began 2.1 ns into the experiment , at which point the shock is approaching the cu - ch interface .",
    "the initial thermodynamic profiles were obtained from simulations of the laser - material interaction performed with a one - dimensional radiation hydrodynamics code  @xcite .",
    "the results were mapped onto the two - dimensional grid with a perturbed cu - ch interface at a simulation time of 2.1 ns and were then evolved out to approximately 66 ns .",
    "the materials were modeled as gamma - law gases , with @xmath110 2.0 , 2.0 , and 1.3 for the cu , ch , c , respectively .",
    "these values for gamma were chosen to give similar shock speeds to those observed in the experiments .",
    "figure [ fig:3lay_scheme ] illustrates the initial configuration .",
    "the simulation used periodic boundary conditions on the transverse boundaries and zero - gradient outflow boundary conditions on the boundaries in the direction of the shock propagation . note that use of periodic boundary conditions in the transverse directions is not in keeping with the boundary conditions of the experiment .",
    "the experiment was performed with the three materials of the target inside a cylindrical be shock tube .",
    "accordingly , the experiment results show the influence of the shock tube walls as a curving or pinching of the outer cu spikes .",
    "our simplified model did not consider these boundary effects .",
    "we first present the results of a resolution study of the simulation .",
    "we performed six simulations from equivalent initial conditions , changing only the maximum mesh resolution .",
    "the results of the six simulations are illustrated in figure [ fig:6ch ] .",
    "as described above , flash solves an advection equation for each abundance , allowing us to track the flow of each material with time . shown",
    "are fluid abundances for the ch , the intermediate material , at approximately 66 ns .",
    "the abundance is represented by a gray scale , so that the white regions ( for which the abundance is zero ) to the left and right of the central gray region are cu and c , respectively .",
    "thus , the ch abundance shows features of both material interfaces , and its evolution shows the behavior of both the spikes of cu and bubbles of c. the effective simulation resolutions were , top to bottom on left then top to bottom on right , 128 @xmath111 64 , 256 @xmath111 512 , 512 @xmath111 1024 , 1024 @xmath111 2048 , 2048 @xmath111 4096 , corresponding to 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , and 9 levels of adaptive mesh refinement .",
    "we found that all of the simulations capture the expected bulk properties of the flow ; that is , all showed similar spikes of cu and bubbles of c. the principal differences in the results were in the amount of small scale structure in the flow , with the amount of small - scale structure increasing with resolution .",
    "the increasing amount of small scale structure in the simulations should be readily apparent in the panels of the figure .",
    "this behavior is expected because the dissipation mechanism in ppm operates on smaller and smaller scales as the resolution is increased .",
    "we note that the increasing amount of small - scale structure seen with increasing resolution indicates that these simulations will not demonstrate a converged flow with higher resolution until the turbulent scales are fully resolved ; only at this point will we be resolving all the relevant length scales in the problem .",
    "because , as noted above , we observe increasing amounts of small - scale structure in the simulations with higher resolutions , convergence studies should focus on integrated quantities such instability growth , which may converge . in order to quantify the results , we examined the lengths of the cu spikes , an integral quantity of the flow that we were best able to accurately measure both in the simulation results and in the experimental results .",
    "the spike lengths were measured by averaging the ch abundance in the @xmath62-direction across the simulation domain then smoothing the resulting one - dimensional array slightly to minimize differences that would occur owing to very small scale structure .",
    "the length of the cu spikes was then determined by the average distance spanned by minimum locations of average abundances 0.05 and 0.9 .",
    "the results were reasonably robust to the amount of smoothing and threshold values .",
    "the results of testing the convergence of the cu spike length measurements are shown in figures [ fig : percentd ] and [ fig : spikes_2times ] .",
    "figure [ fig : percentd ] shows percent differences from the highest resolution simulation as functions of time .",
    "the trend is that the difference decreases with increasing mesh resolution , with the seven and eight level of adaptive mesh refinement simulations always demonstrating agreement to within five percent .",
    "the trend of decreasing difference with increasing mesh resolution demonstrates a convergence of the flow , but it is subject to caveats .",
    "we note that the trend does not describe the behavior at all points in time ( that is , the percent difference curves sometimes cross each other ) , and this average measurement is an integral property of the flow and in no way quantifies the differences in small scale structure observed in the abundances . in particular , we note that the difference curve for the simulation with eight adaptive mesh refinement levels crosses the curves of both the seven and six level simulations , suggesting that higher resolution simulations may deviate further from these results and produce degraded agreement with the experiment .",
    "figure  [ fig : spikes_2times ] shows the cu spike lengths at approximately the two times of the experimental results , 39.9 and 66.0 ns , vs.  number of refinement levels , quantifying the changes of the cu spike lengths at the times of the experimental results with resolution .",

    "the simulation in figure [ fig : simrad6 ] had six levels of adaptive mesh refinement ( an effective resolution of @xmath112 ) , while the simulation in figure [ fig : simrad7 ] had seven levels of refinement ( @xmath113 ) .",
    "the radiographs were created from the abundances of the three materials .",
    "an artificial opacity was assigned to each abundance , cu having the highest , ch the intermediate , and c the lowest .",
    "then the opacity was applied to intensity from an artificial  beam \" that consisted of a circular region that linearly decayed above a certain radius from a point near the center of the simulation domain .",
    "in addition , the abundances were de - resolved to match the resolution of the pixels in the images from the experiment and random poisson ` noise ' was added to the intensity .",
    "comparison of the simulated radiographs to the radiographs from the experiment show that the simulations captured the bulk behavior of the materials , particularly the growth of cu spikes and the development of c bubbles .",
    "it is worth noting that the increased amount of small scale structure in the higher resolution simulation is visible in comparing the radiographs even though the images have been de - resolved . from inspection",
    ", the amount of small scale structure in the six level simulation appears to agree with that observed in the experiment better than the seven level simulation .",
    "this agreement indicates that the amount of viscosity in the experiment is higher than the numerical viscosity of the higher resolution runs .",
    "caution concerning this interpretation is warranted , however , because the experimental radiograph , which is essentially the shadow of the material , will almost certainly fail to capture the true amount of small scale structure .",
    "conclusions regarding the correct amount of small scale structure ( and the correct reynolds number of the flow ) must await better diagnostic resolution of the experiments followed by a careful , quantitative comparison with simulation results .",

    "as illustrated in these figures , the higher resolution multi - mode simulation shows a very similar structure to the experiments .",
    "our results indicate @xmath134 , however , which is not in good agreement with the experiments and indicates the presence of some systematic error .",
    "other research groups in the consortium using eulerian hydrodynamics methods report similar results , although groups using other methods report different results .",
    "results of consortium studies will appear in publications of the alpha group @xcite .",
    "because our multi - mode simulations did not agree well with the experimental results , we initiated a study of single - mode instabilities to further investigate mesh resolution effects .",
    "the single - mode simulations all began from initial conditions consisting of @xmath135 ( @xmath125 and @xmath136 ) with @xmath137 . the initial perturbation consisted of a sinusoidal vertical velocity perturbation of 2.5% of the local sound speed , with the horizontal components chosen to make the initial velocity field divergence - free , corresponding to the near - incompressible nature of the experiments .",
    "the simulation domains were 0.25 cm @xmath111 1.5 cm for the two - dimensional simulations and 0.25 cm @xmath111 1.5 cm @xmath111 0.25 cm for the three - dimensional simulations .",
    "as with the multi - mode simulations , the grid was forced to be fully resolved in the region of the initial perturbation .",
    "results from these simulations are shown in figures [ fig : single01 ] - [ fig : spikes ] .",
    "figure [ fig : single01 ] shows plots of bubble height and spike depth for two simulations , one two - dimensional ( dashed lines ) and one three - dimensional ( solid lines ) , from equivalent initial conditions .",
    "the top two curves are bubble heights , and the lower two curves are spike depths .",
    "the effective simulation resolutions are 128 @xmath111 768 ( 2-d ) and 128 @xmath111 768 @xmath111 128 ( 3-d ) . in these calculations , the bubble heights and spike depths",
    "were measured by tracking the advection of each fluid and recording the positions of 99% and 1% abundances .",
    "the distances shown were measured from the initial fluid interface .",
    "the distance between the two curves from each simulation represents the width of the mixing zone .",
    "the results indicate that instability growth rates in three - dimensional simulations are larger than those found in the equivalent two - dimensional simulations as was observed by  @xcite  ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* for an incompressible comparison ) .",
    "in addition , we find that obtaining a reasonably converged estimate of the growth rate requires at least 25 grid points per wavelength of the perturbation , that grid noise seeds small - scale structure , and that the amount of small - scale structure increases with resolution . as noted with the results of the laser - driven shock experiments , this behavior is expected because the dissipation mechanism in ppm operates on smaller and smaller scales as the resolution is increased .",
    "another result is that poorly - resolved simulations exhibit a significant amount of mixing due to numerical diffusion .",
    "figure [ fig : single02 ] illustrates these results .",
    "the panels are images of density after 3.1 s of evolution for six three - dimensional simulations of increasing resolution from the same initial conditions . shown in each panel",
    "is a cross - section of the simulation volume in the @xmath62-@xmath132 plane . in the simulations , the acceleration due to gravity acts in the @xmath62-direction .",
    "the effective resolutions are , from left to right , @xmath138 = 4 , 8 , 16 , 32 , 64 , and 128 grid points .",
    "the mixing due to numerical diffusion is readily visible in the lower resolution results , as is the trend toward increasing amounts of small - scale structure with resolution .",
    "we note that our  metric \" for measuring resolution in terms of grid point per wavelength assumes square or cubic mesh cells . adding resolution along the direction of gravity without adding resolution in directions perpendicular to gravity would decrease the amount of mixing due to numerical diffusion without changing the number of grid points per wavelength .",
    "it is worth noting that the instability growth rate , an integral property of the flow , does not converge with increasing mesh resolution in the case of the single - mode rayleigh - taylor instability .",
    "figure [ fig : spikes ] plots the spike length vs.   wavelength of the perturbation ( @xmath138 ) measured in number of grid points .",
    "the greatest spike length is not found at the highest resolution .",
    "we attribute the decrease in instability growth rate found in the highest resolution to the increased amount of small - scale structure .",
    "further studies of the single - mode rayleigh - taylor and the role of small scale structure are underway , and complete results will appear in @xcite .      as described above , our hydrodynamics model is inviscid .",
    "making this model solvable requires a dissipative mechanism , but such a mechanism does not guarantee convergence . in our case , because the ppm dissipation mechanism does not include a fixed damping length scale , there can always be fluid motion on the smallest scale we resolve .",
    "if those motions affect the bulk properties , then even a measure of these bulk properties will not converge with increasing mesh resolution .",
    "there exist differing opinions in the literature regarding the effects of the ppm dissipation mechanism on simulation results .",
    "@xcite(see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) investigated numerical diffusion of ppm in two dimensions .",
    "they found that the numerical viscosity in ppm depends on velocity of the flow and the mesh resolution .",
    "recent numerical work by  @xcite performed convergence tests for ppm and navier - stokes simulations of homogeneous compressible turbulence in three dimensions . by studying kinetic energy , enstrophy , and energy power spectra",
    ", they found convergence of the ppm and navier - stokes solutions to the same limit .",
    "caution is warranted , however , about the future use of ppm for simulating subsonic turbulent flows .",
    "@xcite , in a study of decaying isotropic turbulence , found that the flow suffered from excessive numerical damping on small length scales and that not all of the properties of the turbulent flow were correctly reproduced .",
    "this dissipation makes shock - capturing schemes poor choices for use with explicit subgrid - scale models .",
    "also , @xcite found that the dissipation in godunov methods depends on the character of the flow and the mesh configuration , and is not always consistent with the navier - stokes viscous terms .",
    "transonic turbulent flows , however , where viscosity is not the primary dissipative mechanism , remains an open research question .",
    "clearly , the limitations of present computing resources prevent us from adequately resolving both the laser experiments and fully - developed turbulent flows .",
    "the simulations we are capable of performing , however , are approaching the resolution required to resolve these flows .",
    "moore s law  @xcite would indicate that computing resources for these types of flow may be available fairly soon . at that point , experiments such as the laser - driven fluid dynamics experiments ( particularly with another generation of growth and improvements in diagnostics ) , could serve as validation test beds for simulations of turbulent flows .",
    "those astrophysical flows with dramatically larger reynolds numbers are not likely to be resolved in the foreseeable future .",
    "the lessons learned in modeling turbulent flows , though , should allow for the improvement of hydrodynamic methods and the development of appropriate subgrid models , making astrophysical simulations more realistic and accurate .",
    "further , if as we increase the resolution of our simulations we eventually will converge with navier - stokes flows as indicated by  @xcite , we may be able to determine the correct amount of small scale structure for these flows and thereby answer some of the unanswered questions in this study .",
    "in this paper , we presented the results of our efforts at verification and validation of flash , our astrophysical simulation code .",
    "we presented the results of new verification tests and the results of two validation tests in which we were able to carefully compare our simulation results to experimental results .",
    "these tests served to increase our understanding of the physics relevant to the problems of interest , to improve our simulation techniques , and to build confidence in our results .",
    "the verification tests we performed for this study indicate that the ppm hydrodynamics module is performing as expected .",
    "advection tests on a uniform mesh showed slightly better than second order convergence of the error with mesh resolution .",
    "the ppm module , on a uniform mesh , propagated a sound wave for one period with approximately second order accuracy , and a shock wave , as expected , to first order .",
    "in the case of a shock wave on an adaptive mesh , the code showed the expected first - order convergence as well .",
    "the code was able to hold a standing shock steady for several times steps , also , indicating the riemann solver is working correctly .",
    "the material equation of state , as well as the hydrodynamic solver , must be well known and well behaved in order to obtain a meaningful comparison with experiments .",
    "verification testing of a test equation of state resulted in establishing a procedure for testing consistency and quantifying the results .",
    "this procedure will allow us to quickly test new equations of state as we develop additional physics modules and address new astrophysical problems .",
    "the results of simulating laser - driven shock experiments show that we can capture the bulk properties of the flow , including the morphological properties of the resolvable structures .",
    "we observed the expected instabilities at the two material interfaces that grew with time during the course of the simulations .",
    "we performed a mesh resolution study that in general showed convergence of instability growth at the material interfaces .",
    "the resolution study did not completely demonstrate convergence , though , because the amount of small scale structure present in the simulations increased with resolution as may be seen by a visual inspection of the results ( figure  [ fig:6ch ] ) .",
    "we attribute this increasing amount of small scale structure to the fact that the amount of numerical dissipation in our hydrodynamics method decreases with increasing resolution .",
    "visual inspection of the experimental results and our simulated radiographs suggested that a simulation with six levels of adaptive mesh refinement better matched the observed small scale structure .",
    "we note , though , that the correct amount of small scale structure in the experiments is not likely captured in the experimental diagnostics because of resolution limits and because the radiograph produces a two - dimensional shadowgraph of a three - dimensional experiment , possibly averaging out small structures .",
    "measurement of the lengths of the spikes allowed us to quantify the results of the simulations , and we found that simulations with seven and eight levels of adaptive mesh refinement agreed to within 5% of the highest resolution ( nine levels ) simulation at all times during the evolution ( figure  [ fig:7andexp4 ] ) .",
    "complete convergence is prohibited by the growth in small - scale structure with increasing resolution .",
    "the spike lengths at intermediate resolutions match the experimental results very well , falling within the experimental errors .",
    "we interpret these as an important calibration result that indicates that six and seven levels of adaptive mesh refinement are appropriate for two - dimensional simulations of these particular experiments .",
    "in addition , the simulations showed that the shock propagating through the corrugated material interface develops a perturbation that oscillates and becomes planar at the second interface , as expected from theory .",
    "we also observed the expected imprinting of the perturbation on this second interface .",
    "for this validation problem , comparison between simulation and experiment is limited by the diagnostic resolution of the experiments and the amount of physics included in the simulations .",
    "improvements to experimental diagnostics will be made in the next generation of laser experiments , and improvements to the simulations could be made by inclusion of a more realistic material equation of state , adding the walls of the shock tube , and modeling the laser - driven energy deposition process . absent these improvements , we can not conclude that the good agreement of our results with the experiment completely validates the simulations .",
    "the results of simulations of a single - mode rayleigh - taylor instability demonstrated the effect of resolution and dimensionality on growth rates .",
    "the single - mode simulations established that @xmath6 25 grid points per mode are required for a reasonable estimate for the growth rate .",
    "this calibration result suggests a minimum resolution for simulations involving the rayleigh - taylor instability with our code .",
    "this required resolution may make complete simulations of many problems prohibitively expensive at the present time .",
    "we confirm previous findings @xcite that instability growth rates in three - dimensional simulations are larger than those found in the equivalent two - dimensional simulations , which indicates limits on results from two - dimensional models of astrophysical phenomena .",
    "the single - mode simulations also showed that , as with the laser - driven shock simulations , one sees structure formation at smaller and smaller scales as resolution is increased .",
    "the result is that increasing resolution will not necessarily produce a converged flow .",
    "further , the single - mode simulations also showed that small scale structure in highly resolved simulations can have an effect on integral properties of the flow , in this case instability growth rates .",
    "our multi - mode rayleigh - taylor instability simulations , like the simulations of the laser experiment , show that the code results agree with the observed bulk properties of the flow : we observe a mixing zone that is very similar in structure to that of the experiment .",
    "our simulations do not , however , agree well with the experimental rate coefficient , @xmath27 ; our results are systematically lower",
    ". this difference could be due to limitations of either the simulations or the experiments .",
    "the experimental initial conditions , which strongly effect the growth rate , are poorly characterized .",
    "further , limitations on experimental diagnostics may distort measured growth rates and mixing .",
    "the simulations , on the other hand , may have been under - resolved . in our low - resolution simulation ,",
    "most of the power in the initial conditions was in modes which were resolved with only @xmath139@xmath140 grid points ; in light of our single - mode results , this is far too low .",
    "increasing the resolution to resolve these modes with @xmath140@xmath141 points increases the observed growth rate , in ( somewhat ) closer agreement with experimental results .",
    "the principal conclusions we draw from our efforts are that validation of an astrophysical simulation code is a difficult process and that the process led us to unanticipated questions .",
    "the verification tests we performed allowed for a careful quantitative study of the accuracy and convergence rates of flash .",
    "the exercise proved useful in a variety of ways , not the least of which was developing techniques for accurately comparing the results of our simulations to accepted answers .",
    "the validation tests we performed , while they did not conclusively validate the simulations , provided insight into the many issues involved in numerical modeling , and served to calibrate the code and build confidence in our results .",
    "v&v testing allows for an assessment of error in the code and progress in building confidence in the results .",
    "the process is limited , though .",
    "analytic solutions are typically available only for simple problems , which may not serve as a strenuous tests of a particular code .",
    "convergence studies , though essential , do not imply that the converged answer is correct .",
    "code - to - code comparisons are another useful tool ; they can be more probing than analytic solutions , and can shed insight into the behavior of different methods . but",
    "again , similar answers do not imply correctness .",
    "comparing numerical and experimental results is also difficult .",
    "nonlinear systems typically have exponential sensitivity to initial conditions , so that any unmodeled initial perturbation in the system can greatly affect the results .",
    "experimental results may be limited , noisy measurements of a poorly - characterized but real physical situations , while the numerical results may be complete diagnostics of the situation derived by a model of dubious applicability .",
    "comparisons must , therefore , rely on choosing features which are obtainable from both results , yet sensitive enough to the physics of interest that comparing the features is a strong probe of the model and numerics .",
    "the complexity of this procedure means that doing it well requires feedback between the computational and experimental researchers , with all parties improving techniques and performing multiple runs .",
    "the computational simulations may be very expensive , however , and performing relevant experiments is a costly and difficult process .",
    "this makes it hard to improve results and demonstrate reproducibility .    as our stated goal in this work was validating an astrophysical simulation code , the assumptions in the models and their applicability to both terrestrial and astrophysical flows warrants discussion .",
    "our numerical models did not have an explicit viscosity .",
    "we saw , however , that the effects of numerical dissipation can not be avoided in simulations .",
    "other physical processes that may play a role but are not included in the models include surface tension , species diffusion , and thermal diffusion . with only euler s equations ,",
    "it is impossible to adjust the relevant dimensionless numbers ( schmidt , reynolds , rayleigh , and prandtl numbers , for example ) to match the correct properties of the fluid .",
    "our use of models without an explicit viscosity resulted in an increasing amount of small scale structure observed with increasing resolution in simulations of both validation problems .",
    "as mentioned above , limits on diagnostic resolution prevent us from determining the correct amount of small scale structure in both validation experiments .",
    "were the experimental diagnostics better , we could incorporate physically - motivated terms for viscosity , surface tension , or diffusion into the equations we evolve and calibrate their magnitudes until we obtain a converged flow with the correct amount of small scale structure . proceeding in this manner ( as well as including a physically - motivated equation of state ) would help us validate our simulations of these and similar terrestrial experiments , but would be of little use in the astrophysical case , where viscosity and surface tension play no dynamic role .    even with better diagnostics these types of experiments",
    "can only further validate the code if we model additional physics that are not relevant to the astrophysical problems of interest . as we mentioned above ,",
    "flows within stars are expected to have a reynolds number greater than 10@xmath12 , for which the viscosity - free euler equations are a better approximation , but such flows are impossible to achieve either in the laboratory or in current simulations .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the terrestrial experiments we have simulated have served to build confidence in the hydrodynamics module in flash , but that there are certainly still limits on the strength of statements we can make about the validity of flash simulations of laboratory experiments .",
    "we end by repeating a point from our introduction , namely that verification and validation can determine only if a code returns an incorrect answer .",
    "verification and validation can not prove that a theoretical result , either numeric or analytic , is correct . by doing a sufficient number of tests , however , one can significantly increase one s confidence in the results .",
    "our efforts at validation , although they have presented many challenges and led to new questions such as the effect of small scale structure on bulk properties of flows , have increased our confidence in the simulations produced by flash .    this work is supported in part by the u.s .",
