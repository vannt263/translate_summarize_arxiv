    "in the past few years , gamma - ray observations revealed the possibility of dark matter annihilation in our galaxy .",
    "several groups claim that the excess gev gamma rays emitted from our galactic center can be best explained by dark matter annihilation through @xmath0 channel @xcite .",
    "the rest mass of dark matter and the required annihilation cross section are @xmath3 gev and @xmath4 @xmath5 s@xmath6 respectively @xcite .",
    "however , recent studies of the milky way dwarf spheroidal satellite galaxies ( mw dsphs ) challenge the above claim .",
    "the constrained annihilation cross sections lie below the canonical thermal relic cross section ( @xmath7 @xmath5 s@xmath6 ) for dark matter of mass @xmath8 gev annihilating via quark and @xmath9-lepton channels @xcite . as a result ,",
    "only a very small parameter space remains possible for the dark matter interpretation of the gev gamma - ray excess .",
    "therefore , it is very important for us to search another independent observation to verify the claim .",
    "besides gamma - ray observations , radio observation is another way to test the dark matter annihilation model .",
    "it is commonly believed that many high - energy electron - positron pairs are produced from dark matter annihilation .",
    "these high - energy electrons and positrons would emit strong synchrotron radiation when there is a strong magnetic field .",
    "in fact , radio observations can give a stringent constraint on annihilating dark matter .",
    "for example , using the radio observational data obtained in @xcite ( at 408 mhz from the inner 4 arcsecond cone around sgr a * ) can give a very strong constraint on the dark matter annihilation cross section @xcite .",
    "for @xmath10 gev , the annihilation cross section of the @xmath0 channel is @xmath11 @xmath5 s@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "however , the analyses of the data from this very small region have large uncertainties , including the uncertainties of the magnetic field strength and the complicated process of the electron and positron diffusion near the milky way center . moreover , as pointed out in @xcite , the effect of inverse compton scattering might significantly affect the constraints obtained .",
    "some other radio observations also provide good constraints on annihilating dark matter @xcite . however , due to the observational limitations and uncertainties , these constraints are generally less stringent .",
    "besides our galaxy , m31 is also a good candidate because it is a nearby and well - studied galaxy .",
    "recent radio observations of m31 constrain the dark matter mass @xmath12 gev and @xmath13 gev annihilating via @xmath0 and @xmath2 channels respectively for @xmath14 @xmath5 s@xmath6 @xcite . however , since the central magnetic field and the dark matter density are poorly constrained for that small observed region ( @xmath15 kpc ) , the results have large uncertainties . in this article",
    ", we revisit the constraints on annihilating dark matter by using the radio data from @xcite , which originate from a larger region ( @xmath16 kpc ) of m31 . also , we model the dark matter density profile of m31 by using the latest data from m31 rotation curve .",
    "we mainly focus on six different standard model annihilation channels ( @xmath17 and @xmath18 ) .",
    "the group in @xcite uses the westerbork synthesis radio telescope ( wsrt ) to observe m31 in the frequency range @xmath19 mhz . after analyzing the radio data , a uniformly weighted average of the final total power image",
    "is obtained for a region of 17.4 kpc .",
    "the total flux density @xmath20 integrated over the radius interval @xmath21 kpc is @xmath22 jy , where @xmath23 is the distance of m31 .",
    "it is equivalent to the total energy flux @xmath24 erg @xmath25 s@xmath6 ( 2@xmath26 upper limit ) .",
    "if we assume that all the radio radiation originates from the synchrotron radiation of the electron and positron pairs produced by dark matter annihilation , the above upper limit of the total energy flux can be used to constrain the cross section of dark matter annihilation ( no spectral index has to be assumed ) . from the analyses in @xcite , synchrotron radiation dominates the cooling rate of the electron and positron pairs .",
    "therefore , we neglect the effect of the inverse compton scattering . also , the cooling processes by other mechanisms such as bremsstrahlung , ionization , scattering , advection loss and re - acceleration are negligible .",
    "these processes just contribute 1% of the total cooling rate .",
    "furthermore , the diffusion time scale of the electron and positron pairs is much longer than the cooling time scale . for a 1 gev electron ,",
    "the diffusion and cooling time scales are @xmath27 s and @xmath28 s respectively @xcite , where @xmath29 @xmath30 s@xmath6 is the diffusion coefficient of m31 @xcite and @xmath31 s@xmath6 is the cooling rate .",
    "therefore , the diffusion term can be neglected and the injected spectrum of the electron and positron pairs is proportional to the source spectrum @xcite .",
    "since the diffusion process is not important and the radio emissivity is mainly determined by the peak radio frequency ( monochromatic approximation ) , the total synchrotron radiation energy flux of the electron and positron pairs produced by dark matter annihilation is given by @xcite : @xmath32,\\ ] ] where @xmath33 kpc @xcite , @xmath34 is the dark matter density profile of m31 , @xmath35 gev , and @xmath36 . here",
    ", @xmath37 is the magnetic field strength in m31 and @xmath38 is the electron or positron spectrum of dark matter annihilation .",
    "the electron or positron spectrum for each annihilation channel can be obtained in @xcite .",
    "the magnetic field strength in m31 is quite uniform for @xmath39 kpc , which is about @xmath40 @xmath41 g @xcite . for the outer region ,",
    "the magnetic field is about 4 @xmath41 g with a weak radial dependence @xcite . in the following analysis , we follow @xcite to use @xmath42 @xmath41 g for m31 . therefore , the peak energy used in eq .",
    "( 1 ) is @xmath43 gev .",
    "since the magnetic field is much stronger near the center of m31 , the larger value of @xmath37 would give a smaller value of @xmath44 and a larger value of @xmath45 .",
    "however , it is not easy to determine the magnetic field strength profile precisely near the m31 center .",
    "studies in @xcite point out that the magnetic field structure of the central region in m31 is very complicated .",
    "the magnetic field strength can vary from 10 @xmath41 g to 50 @xmath41 g in different regions @xcite .",
    "in fact , the dependence of the magnetic strength in eq .",
    "( 1 ) is quite weak .",
    "a factor of 10 larger in @xmath37 would just give less than a few percent larger in @xmath46 .",
    "therefore , we use a constant profile of @xmath42 @xmath41b to model the magnetic field strength of m31 .",
    "this would underestimate the total radio flux @xmath46 calculated by eq .",
    "nevertheless , the underestimated value of @xmath37 can give a conservative lower limit of @xmath46 for dark matter annihilation .",
    "for the dark matter density profile , recent analysis of the m31 rotation curve gives a robust set of parameters with small errors .",
    "sofue ( 2015 ) @xcite shows that the nfw profile @xcite is likely to be a realistic approximation to model the dark matter density profile of m31 : @xmath47 where @xmath48 pc@xmath49 and @xmath50 kpc @xcite .",
    "besides the nfw profile , we also examine two other popular profiles , the burkert profile @xmath51^{-1}$ ] and the einasto profile @xmath52 \\}$ ] @xcite .",
    "the corresponding parameters for the burkert profile and the einasto profile are @xmath53 and @xmath54 respectively @xcite .    by putting the above different density profiles into eq .",
    "( 1 ) and using the lower limits of @xmath55 and @xmath56 and the upper limit of @xmath23 , we can get an analytic expression for the lower limit of @xmath46 : @xmath57 where @xmath58 erg @xmath25 s@xmath6 for the nfw profile , @xmath59 erg @xmath25 s@xmath6 for the burkert profile and @xmath60 erg @xmath25 s@xmath6 for the einasto profile . by using the @xmath45 values shown in fig .  1 and assuming the canonical thermal relic annihilation cross section",
    ", we can get the lower limit of @xmath46 for different annihilation channels and different density profiles ( see figs .  2 - 4 ) .",
    "for the most popular @xmath0 annihilation channel , the lower bound of @xmath61 is 120 gev for the nfw profile .",
    "this is a bit tighter than the constraint obtained in the gamma - ray observations of the mw dsphs ( @xmath12 gev ) @xcite and the previous radio observation of m31 ( @xmath62 gev for the @xmath0 channel with @xmath63 @xmath5 s@xmath6 ) @xcite .",
    "if we use the burkert profile , the lower limits would be smaller by about 10 - 20% .",
    "although the burkert profile is not a robust profile for large galaxy such as m31 , we still consider these lower limits the most conservative limits of our analyses . in table 1 , we summarize the conservative lower limits of the dark matter mass for @xmath63 @xmath5 s@xmath6 .    .lower limits of the dark matter mass for different dark matter density profiles . here , we assume @xmath63 @xmath5 s@xmath6 . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     if we assume that the annihilation cross section is a free parameter , we can compare our results with the constraints obtained in the recent gamma - ray observations of the mw dsphs @xcite and the milky way center @xcite . in fig .  5 , our upper limits are 1 - 2 orders of magnitude tighter than the 95% c.l",
    "upper limits obtained in the mw dsphs for the @xmath64 and @xmath1 channels for @xmath65 gev .",
    "it is because a large amount of high - energy electron - positron pairs is produced in these two channels .",
    "the predicted synchrotron radiation signals are very large and hence the constraints are more stringent . for the other channels , our results are generally tighter when @xmath61 is smaller than @xmath66 gev ( except the @xmath67 channel ) . in fig .  6 , we compare our results with the recent empirical fits of the galactic gev excess obtained in @xcite .",
    "we can see that our constraints rule out the best models of dark matter interpretation of the gev excess for the @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 channels ( by at least 2@xmath26 ) .",
    "nevertheless , the parameters of the @xmath67 channel can still satisfy our constraints marginally .",
    "since the studies in @xcite assume the nfw profile to calculate the limits , we also use the nfw dark matter profile to do the analysis .    if we allow mixed annihilations , calore et al .",
    "( 2015 ) @xcite predict that the ratio @xmath68 ( @xmath69 model ) would be the best to account for the milky way gev gamma - ray excess .",
    "a good fit can also be obtained if the annihilation products are @xmath1 and @xmath2 ( @xmath70 model ) for @xmath71 gev with the branching ratio of @xmath1 @xmath72 @xcite .",
    "if we assume @xmath73 gev , our results rule out the @xmath69 model and @xmath70 model by the 1@xmath26 and 2@xmath26 radio upper limit respectively .",
    "therefore , based on our analyses , our new constraints do not favor the dark matter interpretation of the milky way gev gamma - ray excess .",
    "our results support the conclusion drawn from the fermi - lat gamma - ray observations of the mw dsphs @xcite .     versus @xmath61 for the six annihilation channels . here , we use @xmath74 gev.,width=309 ]     for @xmath63 @xmath5 s@xmath6 with the nfw density profile .",

    "the dotted line is the canonical thermal relic cross section.,width=309 ]",
    "in this article , we revisit the radio constraints of annihilating dark matter by using the m31 radio data in @xcite . our results generally give more stringent constraints on annihilation cross sections for the six standard model annihilation channels . here , the uncertainties of the parameters involved in the analyses , such as the scale density @xmath55 , the scale radius @xmath56 , magnetic field strength @xmath37 and the observed radio flux @xmath46 , are relatively small compared with previous studies . since the magnetic field strength is greater in the center of m31 , the radio flux emitted by the electron - positron pairs produced from dark matter annihilation should be larger .",
    "therefore , our assumption of the constant magnetic field strength gives a conservative lower limits of the radio emission .",
    "we find that all of the conservative lower limits are larger than the 2@xmath26 upper limits of the observed flux for @xmath75 gev if we assume a canonical thermal relic cross section .",
    "it is consistent with the results obtained by gamma - ray observations of the mw dsphs @xcite .",
    "therefore , our result provides an independent support of the recent analysis that most of the standard @xmath76 gev dark matter annihilation models should be ruled out .",
    "if we release the annihilation cross section to be a free parameter , we also obtain constraints of the annihilation cross sections for the six channels . generally speaking ,",
    "our constraints are more stringent than that obtained in @xcite , especially for the @xmath64 channel , @xmath1 channel , @xmath2 channel for @xmath77 gev , @xmath0 channel for @xmath78 gev and @xmath18 for @xmath79 gev .",
    "these constraints are useful to examine the most popular dark matter interpretation of the gev excess @xcite , such as the @xmath0 and @xmath2 channels . based on our analyses ,",
    "most of the models are ruled out except the @xmath67 model .",
    "our analyses also show that the @xmath69 mixed annihilation model and the @xmath70 mixed annihilation model exceed the 1@xmath26 and 2@xmath26 upper limit of the radio flux respectively .",
    "if we can get some better radio data of m31 or precisely determine the magnetic field profile in the future , more stringent constraints can be obtained .",
