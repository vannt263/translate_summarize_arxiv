    "the @xmath0-decay of the naturally occurring isotopes of tungsten ( w ) has been the subject of experimental search for many decades .",
    "tungsten is an interesting element because @xmath0-decay is energetically allowed for all five naturally occurring isotopes .",
    "mass excess measurements @xcite show that the available decay energy q for all these isotopes is low ( @xmath5 mev ) and that the q values lie in the same energy range as @xmath6 and @xmath7 decay due to natural chains ( see table [ qvalues ] )",
    ". therefore background suppression and possibly event - by - event discrimination against @xmath7 s and @xmath6 s , which may obscure the @xmath0 signal , are crucial issues for the detection of such rare events .",

    "we have observed the natural @xmath0-decay of @xmath1w with a half - life of t@xmath3y and a q - value of ( 2516.4 @xmath4 1.1 ( stat . )",
    "@xmath4 1.2 ( sys . ) ) kev .",
    "in addition , the lack of any signal from the other tungsten isotopes sets new limits on their half - lives .",
    "these results offer an improvement of roughly a factor of 50 over the best previously published limits .",
    "finally we would like to note the power and potential of this cryogenic technique , which here enabled us to achieve a very high sensitivity in an application to nuclear physics .",
    "we would like to thank s. nisi and m. balata for the icpms measurements and m. laubenstein for the @xmath7 spectroscopy analysis at the gran sasso laboratories .",
