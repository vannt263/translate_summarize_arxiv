    "see  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we show that a simple real - space renormalization group ( rsrg ) scheme  @xcite yields the dynamical properties of facilitated spin models in one dimension , or kinetically constrained ising chains ( kcics ) , near their zero temperature critical point  @xcite . this behaviour is known from previous work  @xcite .",
    "the rsrg scheme provides a unified framework for treating these systems , allowing one to obtain critical dynamic exponents , and to visualise the rg flows of scaling variables related to temperature and spatial asymmetry .",
    "we proceed as follows . in section  [ pseudo - spin ]",
    "we define kcics , and show , following siggia  @xcite , that they can be written in terms of `` interacting quantum spins '' .",
    "we discuss in section  [ sec : rd ] how this formalism admits a simple physical interpretation in terms of reaction - diffusion processes . in sections  [ sec :",
    "rg][sec : bcic ] we use a rsrg scheme to extract the zero - temperature critical behaviour of kcics , in the fa model ( sec .",
    "[ sec : fa ] ) and east model ( sec .  [ sec : east ] ) limits , and for the case of finite asymmetry  @xcite ( sec .",
    "[ sec : bcic ] ) .",
    "we find that the dynamical exponents for the fa and east models are respectively @xmath0 and @xmath1 , in agreement with existing results  @xcite .",
    "we show that length scales in the fa model grow as @xmath2 near the critical point @xmath3 , while for the east model there is no characteristic length scale .",
    "we also quantify the crossover of the kcic with large but finite asymmetry from east - like to fa - like behaviour . in section  [ sec : conclu ] we state our conclusions .",
    "the kcic is defined as follows  @xcite .",
    "consider a chain of @xmath4 ising spins @xmath5 , in one space dimension , with hamiltonian @xmath6 .",
    "we will take @xmath4 even , assume periodic boundary conditions , and restrict the dynamics to flips of single spins that have at least one nearest neighbour in the up state .",

    "the bias @xmath12 determines the symmetry properties of the kinetic constraint : the fa and east models correspond to the limiting cases of symmetry ( @xmath13 ) and maximal asymmetry ( @xmath14 ) , respectively .",
    "the east model is so - called because information propagates to the east .",
    "we will also consider the case of general @xmath12 , which we will call the biased constrained ising chain ( bcic ) . for @xmath12 small but finite",
    "the bcic exhibits a crossover at large length and time scales from east - like to fa - like behaviour  @xcite . in section  [ sec : rg ] we use an rsrg to quantify this crossover .",
    "the dynamics of the kcic is governed by the master equation @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the probability that the system has configuration @xmath17 at time @xmath18 ( @xmath19 is the configuration @xmath20 with spin @xmath21 flipped ) , and @xmath22 is the probability per unit time that @xmath21 will flip .",
    "the @xmath23 are the nearest neighbours of @xmath24 .",

    "@xmath28 is the equilibrium distribution .",
    "however , this obscures the fact that the evolution operator is a normalized stochastic process which obeys detailed balance , and so we will use the non - hermitian representation where this is explicit .",
    "one passes to a quantum formalism  @xcite by introducing the state vector @xmath29 the ket @xmath30 is the state vector for the spin at site @xmath24 .",
    "the spins are for convenience taken to lie along the @xmath31-axis , and thus the operator @xmath32 flips the @xmath33component of spin @xmath24 : @xmath34 . by differentiating ( [ ket ] ) with respect to time , and using ( [ one ] ) to eliminate @xmath35",
    ", we get the master equation in the guise of a euclidean schrdinger equation , @xmath36 here @xmath37 , which we will also call a `` hamiltonian '' , is not in general hermitian .",
    "we define the kcic by the constrained glauber rates @xmath38 where the factor of @xmath39 is a convenient normalization .",
    "the constraint is @xmath40 , where @xmath41 .",
    "the sigma matrices at a given site @xmath24 obey @xmath42 .",
    "sigma matrices at different sites commute . the matrix @xmath43 in equation ( [ schrod ] ) then reads @xmath44 where @xmath45 .",
    "the appearance of the @xmath32 term shows that in order to represent these simple kcms in terms of `` interacting '' systems with no dynamical constraints , one must introduce extra degrees of freedom , or , equivalently , nonlocal interactions . using the pauli representation @xmath46 and @xmath47",
    ", we have @xmath48 and @xmath49 the hamiltonian @xmath37 can then be written as the matrix direct product @xmath50 where the liouvillian @xmath51 is @xmath52 the matrix ( [ interp ] ) describes a probability - conserving stochastic process ; thus the sum of each column is zero .",
    "when we construct the rg scheme we must preserve this condition .",
    "the east and fa models correspond to the cases @xmath14 and @xmath13 , respectively : @xmath53 and @xmath54    in the next section we show briefly that the evolution operators obtained above have a simple physical interpretation as reaction - diffusion processes .",
    "the interpretation of the kcic as a reaction - diffusion process follows by noting that the liouville operators in the previous section act on two - site basis states @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the probability that a spin is up .",
    "we have again suppressed time labels .",
    "the single - site basis states are normalized probabilities of the form @xmath57 , where @xmath58 .",
    "the vectors @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the eigenvectors of @xmath61 with eigenvalue @xmath62 and @xmath63 , respectively .",
    "we represent reaction - diffusion processes as follows .",
    "let the eigenvalue @xmath64 represent a lattice site @xmath24 occupied by a particle @xmath65 , and @xmath66 represent the same lattice site with no particle present .",
    "we denote this state by @xmath67",
    ". then the east model liouvillian ( [ liouv - east ] ) has a clear physical interpretation : it describes the ( right ) branching process @xmath68 occurring with rate @xmath69 , and the ( right ) coagulation process @xmath70 occurring with rate @xmath71 .",
    "the fa model involves in addition the ( left ) branching and coagulation processes @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "consider the following general set of reaction - diffusion processes :    [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     by inspection , using ( [ basis ] ) , the equation of motion for this system reads @xmath74 where @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "as an aside , we argued in ref .",
    "@xcite that a @xmath79 generalization of the fa model behaves like a system in the directed percolation ( dp )  @xcite universality class , albeit with vanishing self - destruction rate .",
    "the latter process may be defined as a reaction - diffusion system comprising diffusion , branching and annihilation .",
    "the similarity between the fa model and dp is due to the fact that nearest neighbour - facilitated branching can mimic the effect of diffusion in higher dimensions , and thus the @xmath79 fa model can be represented as ( pseudo)-diffusion , branching and annihilation . in one dimension",
    "this correspondence no longer holds : one can see from equation ( [ reac - diff ] ) that left and right branching , @xmath80 and @xmath81 , and left and right diffusion , @xmath82 and @xmath83 , sit in different slots of the evolution matrix .",
    "we will now apply a simple real - space rg scheme to the kcic .",
    "this scheme was developed in the 1980s and used on quantum spin models  @xcite .",
    "recently , it was applied to the contact process  @xcite , a reaction - diffusion system .",
    "other rg approaches that have been used on reaction - diffusion systems include density matrix rg ( dmrg )  @xcite and field - theoretic rg techniques .",
    "dmrg is a numerical scheme which tends to produce more precise estimates for critical exponents than does the rsrg , but is less intuitive , in the sense that it does not lend itself so readily to the visualisation of flows in rg space .",
    "field theoretic rg techniques have been successfully applied to many reaction - diffusion systems in low dimensions  @xcite .",
    "however , we argued in ref .",
    "@xcite that the fa model has an upper critical dimension of 4 , and , crucially , its coarse - grained action becomes difficult to analyse below @xmath85 .",
    "hence we shall employ a real - space rg scheme in @xmath86 , which provides both an intuitive and a tractable means of studying the critical behaviour of the kcic .",
    "the idea is as follows .",
    "one divides the lattice into blocks of @xmath87 spins , and denotes the configuration of spins inside each block @xmath88 as @xmath89 .",
    "we will focus on the case @xmath90 , and discuss larger blockings where appropriate . the evolution operator @xmath91 then splits into an intra - block part @xmath92 and an inter - block ` interaction ' @xmath93 : @xmath94 in the case of the east model we can write @xmath95 and @xmath96 where the brackets indicate the grouping of spins into blocks .",
    "all terms in the liouvillian ( [ direct - product ] ) are of the form ( [ intra ] ) or ( [ inter ] ) , with the necessary number of identity matrices affixed at each end of the chain .",
    "we will denote the eigenstates of @xmath97 as @xmath98 and @xmath99 , noting that the left and right eigenstates of a non - hermitian matrix are in general different .",
    "the east and fa models have respectively triply- and doubly - degenerate ground states , i.e. respectively three and two eigenvectors with eigenvalue zero .",
    "one identifies these ground states as effective cell states , and projects the basis of two - site spins @xmath100 into renormalized block spins @xmath101 .",
    "this is done by defining a projection operator @xmath102 where @xmath103 is a linear combination of the the renormalized basis vectors @xmath104 , and the @xmath105 are real numbers .",
    "if the original hamiltonian @xmath43 is @xmath25 dimensional , then @xmath106 is a @xmath107 matrix whose rows contain linear combinations of the left ground states of @xmath92 .",
    "one can therefore write the matrix representation of @xmath108 as @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the projection of the two - spin state @xmath111 onto the renormalized cell state @xmath112 , etc .",
    "the projection operation is a mapping from an hilbert space of @xmath4 spins , with dimension @xmath25 , to an hilbert space of @xmath113 block spins , with dimension @xmath114 .",
    "thus @xmath115 .",
    "we also define the embedding operator @xmath116 which may be cast as a @xmath117 matrix whose columns are linear combinations of the right ground states of @xmath92 .",
    "we have @xmath118 where now @xmath119 is the component of the renormalized cell state @xmath112 that is embedded in the two - spin state @xmath111 .",
    "thus @xmath120 .",
    "we demand that if we apply the embedding operator followed by the projection operator we recover the identity on the @xmath113-dimensional block - spin space : @xmath121 .",
    "but since the projection operation does not retain all the degrees of freedom of the system , projection followed by embedding does not yield the identity on real - spin space .",
    "thus @xmath122 .",
    "the renormalization prescription is then @xmath123 where @xmath124 is a renormalized evolution operator .",
    "this prescription projects the original @xmath125 hamiltonian onto a @xmath126 subspace .",
    "if this subspace is suitably chosen , the renormalized hamiltonian @xmath124 will have the same form as @xmath43 , but with renormalized couplings @xmath127 and rates @xmath128 . from these relations",
    "one can determine fixed points and critical exponents .",
    "we will now apply this scheme to the kcics .",
    "the fa model is defined by equation ( [ liouv - fa ] ) . when the blocking parameter @xmath90 , we need only consider the @xmath129 matrix @xmath130 the brackets indicate the groupings of cells into blocks .",
    "the first and third terms in ( [ fa - toy ] ) comprise the intra - cell hamiltonian @xmath92 ; the second and fourth terms are the inter - cell interaction @xmath131 .",
    "we must calculate the left and right ground states of the matrix @xmath92 ( [ liouv - fa ] ) .",
    "there are two left ground - state eigenvectors , @xmath132 and @xmath133 , and two right ground - state eigenvectors , @xmath134 and @xmath135 .",
    "we will use these to build @xmath106 and @xmath136 , subject to the following constraints :    1 .",
    "the rg transformation must preserve probability conservation .",
    "thus each column of @xmath137 must add up to zero .",
    "we require that @xmath138 has the same form as @xmath92 , so that we can identify unambiguously the renormalized parameters .",
    "note that by building @xmath136 from the ground states of @xmath92 we ensure that the renormalized intra - cell hamiltonian vanishes , i.e. @xmath139 .",
    "3 .   we must respect the fact that the fa model is _ trivially irreducible _ for all @xmath140  @xcite .",
    "this means that any configuration ( bar that with all spins down ) can be reached from an initial high - temperature configuration .",
    "this suggests that any two - spin state with at least one up - spin , namely @xmath141 and @xmath142 , should be projected onto @xmath112 .",
    "4 .   normalization .",
    "we require that @xmath143 .",
    "one choice satisfying these criteria is @xmath144 the matrix @xmath106 projects @xmath141 and @xmath142 onto @xmath112 , and @xmath145 onto @xmath146 .",
    "@xmath136 embeds the state @xmath112 as @xmath147 , and @xmath146 as @xmath145 .",
    "the form of the ground state vectors for the fa model stipulates that the states @xmath148 and @xmath142 are treated on equal footing during the projection and embedding operations , as befits a model whose dynamical rules are isotropic .",
    "we will see in the next section that this is not so for the east model .    using ( [ proj - fa ] ) and ( [ liouv - fa ] ) we find @xmath149 we can deduce the flow of the temparature parameter as follows .",
    "let the ratio of the sum of the rates of the processes @xmath150 and @xmath151 to the sum of the rates of @xmath152 and @xmath153 be @xmath154 .",
    "thus its unrenormalized or ` bare ' value is @xmath155 where @xmath156 is element @xmath156 of matrix ( [ liouv - fa ] ) .",
    "hence @xmath157 as @xmath158 .",
    "we can work out how @xmath154 renormalizes by calculating a similar ratio using the matrix ( [ fa - r ] ) .",
    "the resulting rg recursion relation is @xmath159 where @xmath160 is the renormalized counterpart of @xmath154 .",
    "equation ( [ recursion - fa ] ) describes the flow of @xmath154 away from an unstable zero - temperature critical point @xmath161 , towards a stable high - temperature fixed point @xmath162 .",
    "the unphysical fixed point @xmath163 is inaccessible .",
    "figure  [ fig : fa - flow ] shows this flow .",
    "the rg procedure for the fa model using larger block sizes is unambiguous , because one obtains at each stage only two right- and two left ground state eigenvectors of the intra - block hamiltonian .",
    "thus for @xmath164 we construct the following projection and embedding operators : @xmath165 and @xmath166 where @xmath167 . in @xmath168 ,",
    "one inserts in the relevant slot one power of @xmath154 for every up - spin in excess of one , in order to reflect the thermal suppression of these states .",
    "thus the state @xmath169 ( corresponding to element @xmath170 of ( [ embed - fa-3 ] ) ) is penalized by a factor @xmath171 , wheras the state @xmath172 ( corresponding to element @xmath173 of ( [ embed - fa-3 ] ) ) receives a penalty of one power of @xmath154 .",
    "the generalization to larger block sizes is straightforward .",
    "we find that for general block size @xmath87 the rg recursion relation is @xmath174 where @xmath175 is the value of @xmath154 following the @xmath176-th iteration of the rg . as expected ( and required by the semi - group property of the renormalization group ) we see from equations  ( [ recursion - fa ] ) and  ( [ fa - rec - gen ] ) that two successive coarse - grainings using a block size of @xmath90 is equivalent to one coarse - graining using a block size of @xmath177 .",
    "thus @xmath178 near the critical point @xmath161 .",
    "the divergence of the dynamical correlation length follows from standard rg arguments  @xcite . because the dimensionful correlation length must remain invariant under the rg transformation , the dimensionless correlation length @xmath179 , measured in terms of the lattice spacing , must decrease by a factor of the blocking parameter , @xmath87 : @xmath180 ( see figure  [ fig : block ] ) .",
    "we can write this relation as @xmath181 in equation  ( [ rg - corr ] ) @xmath160 is the renormalized version of @xmath154 .",
    "if we can write the rg equation for @xmath154 near criticality in the form @xmath182 , then the correlation length is a function satisfying @xmath183 .",
    "hence @xmath184 , where @xmath185 . from equation  ( [ fa - rec - gen ] ) we see that @xmath186 , and hence near the critical point @xmath187    this correlation length corresponds to the characteristic spatial extent of structures ( ` bubbles ' ) in space - time trajectories of the fa model at low temperature .",
    "we show one such trajectory in figure  [ fig : traj ] .",
    "we can obtain the dynamical exponent @xmath31 by noting that in the limit of zero temperature the nonvanishing elements of ( [ fa - r ] ) are one - quarter those of ( [ liouv - fa ] ) .",
    "we find that for general @xmath87 the corresponding rescaling factor is @xmath188 .",
    "we interpret this factor as a rescaling of time under renormalization , defining the dynamical exponent @xmath31 via @xmath189 .",
    "thus for the fa model @xmath0 , signifying diffusive behaviour .",
    "this is as expected : the low - temperature dynamics of the fa model is known to proceed by diffusion of isolated defects  @xcite .",
    "we can infer the consequent relaxation time of the fa model by using the relationship between time and length scales , @xmath190 , where @xmath191 is the length scale being probed .",
    "since the equilibrium length in the fa model scales as @xmath192see below , and refs .",
    "@xcite  and since the microscopic timescale goes as @xmath69 , we expect the equilibration time to have the leading order temperature dependence @xmath193 .",
    "this scaling is known from previous work on the fa model  @xcite .",
    "one may also calculate  @xcite the density of excitated sites , @xmath194 , both in the steady state and near the critical fixed point .",
    "the former is trivial for the fa model , since it obeys detailed balance , and one may therefore consider the calculation of the steady - state density a test of the rg scheme .",
    "first note that the renormalization of the number operator does not depend on whether @xmath195 sits in the left or right slot of the block : @xmath196 , for a block size @xmath90 .",
    "the rg recursion relation for the density then reads @xmath197 where the subscript @xmath176 denotes the parameter obtained following @xmath176 iterations of the rg .    to extract the steady - state density",
    "we follow  @xcite and write @xmath198 , where @xmath199 . by iterating this equation along the rg flow",
    "we get @xmath200 n(\\lambda^{\\star}_a),\\ ] ] where @xmath201 is the steady - state density , and @xmath202 is the density at the attractive fixed point @xmath203 . again following  @xcite , we define @xmath204 . from equations  ( [ recursion - fa ] ) , ( [ fa - density ] ) and the definition of @xmath205 we can write @xmath206 we can therefore write @xmath207 as @xmath208 from ( [ recursion - fa ] ) we have that @xmath209 . using this result with equations ( [ ss - density ] ) and ( [ gee ] )",
    ", we get @xmath210 as @xmath211 , @xmath212 , and so , noting that @xmath213 , we obtain the steady - state density @xmath214 this is as expected : detailed balance with respect to the hamiltonian @xmath215 implies @xmath216 e^{- \\beta h(\\sigma)}/ \\sum_{\\{\\sigma\\ } } e^{-\\beta h(\\sigma ) } = c$ ] .    near criticality",
    "we can write @xmath217 , and so @xmath218 .",
    "thus the density vanishes close to criticality as @xmath219 with @xmath220 .",
    "the east model is defined by equation  ( [ liouv - east ] ) . to renormalize it using a blocking parameter @xmath90 , for example",
    ", we need only consider the @xmath221 matrix @xmath222 the brackets indicate the groupings of cells into blocks .",
    "the first term in ( [ east - toy ] ) is the intra - cell component @xmath92 ; the second is the inter - cell interaction @xmath131 .",
    "we must calculate the left and right ground states of the matrix @xmath92 ( [ liouv - east ] ) .",
    "the left ground states are represented by the row vectors @xmath223 and @xmath224 .",
    "the right ground states correspond to the column vectors @xmath225 and @xmath226^t$ ] .",
    "next , we choose the projection and embedding matrices , which we call @xmath227 and @xmath228 so as not to confuse them with their fa model counterparts .",
    "one choice satisfying criteria 14 ( see above ) is @xmath229 where @xmath230 parameterizes a degree of freedom .",
    "this arises because the east model admits one more ground state vector than the fa model .",
    "@xmath227 projects @xmath141 and @xmath142 onto @xmath112 , and @xmath145 onto @xmath146 .",
    "@xmath228 embeds the state @xmath112 as @xmath231 , and @xmath146 as @xmath145 . with this choice",
    "we get @xmath232 we deduce the flow of the temperature parameter in a similar way to before : let the ratio of the rates of the processes @xmath150 and @xmath233 be @xmath154 .",
    "then @xmath234 where @xmath156 is element @xmath156 of matrix ( [ liouv - east ] ) .",
    "hence the bare temperature parameter has the same interpretation as in the fa model .",
    "we can work out how @xmath154 renormalizes by calculating the ratio of elements @xmath235 and @xmath170 of matrix ( [ east - r ] ) .",
    "the resulting rg recursion relation is @xmath236 implying an unstable zero - temperature critical point , @xmath161 , as expected .",
    "the dynamical exponent @xmath31 follows immediately . in the critical limit @xmath157 ,",
    "element @xmath170 of matrix ( [ liouv - east ] ) becomes unity .",
    "hence we may interpret the renormalized value of this element as the time rescaling factor @xmath237 . from ( [ east - r ] )",
    "we get @xmath238 and so @xmath31 depends on the value we choose for @xmath239 .",
    "let us choose @xmath239 .",
    "this parameter measures the extent to which we treat the states @xmath142 and @xmath148 on equal footing . in a model with symmetric dynamical rules , such as the fa model",
    ", we must treat these states identically .",
    "but the east model has asymmetric dynamical rules , suggesting that at some point in our calculation we must suppress @xmath142 relative to @xmath148 , or vice - versa . at which point",
    "should we do this ?",
    "we note that the _ projection _ matrix @xmath227 treats @xmath148 and @xmath142 identically . if this were not the case , and we instead ( for example ) used @xmath240 we would violate criteria 2 and 3 above .",
    "( @xmath241 imposes a symmetry between flipping spins @xmath242 in a two - spin block and flipping the resulting renormalized spin @xmath243 . )",
    "therefore , we conclude that the _ embedding _ matrix @xmath136 must treat @xmath148 and @xmath142 asymmetrically . the simplest way of doing this is to set @xmath244 , thus suppressing completely the state @xmath142 .",
    "this corresponds to the assertion that a spin configuration @xmath142 ( which is unable to change state unless connected to neighbouring spins ) is much less important to the dynamics than a configuration @xmath148 , which is mobile .",
    "thus when one renormalizes the lattice using @xmath227 and @xmath228 with @xmath244 , one effectively discards dynamical pathways mediated by blocks of ` jammed ' spins @xmath142 .",
    "the rg process discards inaccessible pathways in trajectory space @xmath245 , according to rules imposed by the liouvillian of the dynamical process .",
    "loosely , the projection matrix @xmath227 identifies those single - spin states which are facilitat_ing _ , whereas @xmath228 picks out those two - spin states which are ( internally ) mobile .    setting @xmath244",
    "immediately yields a temperature dependent dynamic exponent : from equation  ( [ zed ] ) we obtain @xmath246 , or @xmath247 .",
    "were @xmath248 , @xmath31 would be independent of temperature to leading order .",
    "we thus conclude that maximal spatial anisotropy in the embedding process is a necessary condition for a temperature - dependent dynamic exponent .",
    "the rg scheme for the east model can be generalized to larger block sizes .",
    "however , this procedure is less straightforward than for the fa model , because of the freedom one is afforded by the east model s many ground state eigenvectors .",
    "furthermore , the results one obtains depends on whether one coarse - grains using a blocking parameter @xmath87 equal to a power of @xmath249 , or not .",
    "let us first illustrate the generalization of the procedure for the case @xmath250 .",
    "we show that the results are consistent with the @xmath90 scheme .",
    "we then argue that one should obtain a different dynamical exponent if one coarse - grains the system using a block size not equal to a power of @xmath249 , and then show explicitly for @xmath164 that this is indeed the case .",
    "consider @xmath251 , where @xmath195 is an integer .",
    "building @xmath252 is straightforward : it is identical to @xmath253 , its fa model counterpart .",
    "thus @xmath254 is a @xmath255 matrix whose top row is composed of @xmath256s apart from the rightmost element which is zero .",
    "vice versa for the bottom row .",
    "the form of the embedding matrix is less obvious , because the number of ground states increases as one increases the block size .",
    "however , we are guided by the form of the liouvillian , which for block size @xmath177 may be written schematically as @xmath257 brackets again denote the grouping of cells into blocks .",
    "we take the first line of equation  ( [ east - l-4 ] ) as the intra - cell hamiltonian @xmath92 .",
    "the second line vanishes under renormalization as a consequence of @xmath106 acting on it from the left , and so we ignore it ; the third line comprises the inter - cell interaction whose renormalization properties we wish to study .    guided by the form of @xmath258",
    ", we find that one choice of @xmath259 satisfying criteria 14 above is @xmath260 where @xmath261 .",
    "we see that equation  ( [ embed - east-4 ] ) can be obtained from its fa model counterpart by using a simple rule - of - thumb : suppress all states of the form @xmath262 [ corresponding to elements @xmath263@xmath264 of ( [ embed - east-4 ] ) ] , as well as states possessing a ` frozen ' up - spin at the right - hand boundary of the block .",
    "thus states @xmath265 [ corresponding to element @xmath266 of  ( [ embed - east-4 ] ) ] and @xmath267 [ element @xmath268 have been removed .",
    "we see again that the embedding operator plays the role of a dynamical ` filter ' , eliminating those states which play a sub - dominant role in the dynamics of the east model .    with these choices of embedding and projection operators",
    "we obtain the rg recursion relation for the temperature , @xmath269 and a relation for the dynamical exponent : @xmath270 equation ( [ east - rec-4 ] ) is identical to the result one would obtain via two coarse - grainings using a block size @xmath90 [ equation ( [ recursion - east-0 ] ) ] , as required . equation ( [ zed - east-4 ] ) yields the dynamical exponent @xmath271 , as before .",
    "we shall demonstrate how one can generalize this approach to arbitrarily large @xmath195 .",
    "let us use reaction - diffusion notation @xmath272 ) , and write the projection and embedding operators in the form @xmath273 and @xmath274 the symbol @xmath275 denotes any state @xmath276 _ starting _ with a @xmath256 , and the @xmath277 are a set of coefficients [ see e.g. the first column of ( [ embed - east-4 ] ) ] ; the projection operator @xmath278 allows one to compare this notation to the matrix representations employed previously .",
    "the normalization requirement @xmath279 implies @xmath280 .",
    "thus at least one of the coefficients @xmath239 must be of @xmath281 .",
    "the values of these coefficients are fixed by the eigenvectors of the intra - block evolution operator , as we have discussed .",
    "we can see how these coefficients determine the properties of the model under renormalization , as follows .",
    "we find that ` bulk ' states of the form @xmath282 vanish under renormalization as a consequence of the projection operator acting from the left .",
    "we are therefore left with the ` surface ' terms @xmath283 and @xmath284 , in which the operators @xmath285 and @xmath286 sit at the edge of the block .",
    "we find that , under renormalization , @xmath287 and @xmath288.\\ ] ] in equations  ( [ haile ] ) and  ( [ gebrselassie ] ) primes denote renormalized operators .",
    "the symbol @xmath289 denotes states @xmath290 starting _ and ending _ with a @xmath256 . in ( [ gebrselassie ] ) the temperature parameter @xmath154 has been rescaled by the coefficient @xmath291 which weights thermally the state @xmath292 with a single @xmath256 at the leftmost edge , followed by a string of @xmath293s . from the previous discussion we know that this coefficient is of order unity , and hence the recursion relation for @xmath154 will be marginal , as we have found .",
    "the dynamical exponent follows by noting that the product of equations  ( [ haile ] ) and  ( [ gebrselassie ] ) constitutes the renormalized evolution operator , and so the prefactor describes the rescaling of time as a consequence of rescaling space .",
    "thus @xmath294 the constant of proportionality in ( [ komen ] ) is @xmath295 , i.e. the reciprocal of element @xmath170 in the unrenormalized east model hamiltonian  ( [ liouv - east ] ) .",
    "the first factor on the right hand side of ( [ komen ] ) is of order unity .",
    "the second factor is fixed by the embedding operator , which is in turn determined by the relevant east model eigenvectors .",
    "the rule - of - thumb we obtained above tells us that we remove from this factor any state with a frozen rightmost up - spin .",
    "this may be regarded as an entropic suppression of states playing only a sub - dominant role in the dynamics .",
    "those states starting and ending with a 1 which _ are _ important for the dynamics of the east model are for block sizes @xmath296 and @xmath297 , @xmath298 all have a ` mobile ' rightmost up - spin .",
    "the thermal weighting of each state is given in brackets .",
    "these states are important because of the hierarchical dynamics of the east model  @xcite , which dictates that two defects separated by a distance @xmath299 are relaxed by establishing a set of isolated defects between them , at distances @xmath300 , @xmath301 etc .",
    "thus for block size @xmath177 the dominant dynamical pathway proceeds via the state @xmath302 , with a thermal weighting of @xmath171 ( and not , for example , @xmath303 , which has a weighting of @xmath154 ) .",
    "hence @xmath304 , @xmath305 , and so @xmath306 .",
    "consequently , the rescaling factor is @xmath307 , and the dynamical exponent @xmath308 , as required .",
    "( in the fa model , states such as @xmath309 are permitted , leading to temperature - independent @xmath239 coefficients and hence to a temperature - independent @xmath31 . )",
    "thus @xmath228 , which attempts to reconstitute an unrenormalized state from a coarse - grained state , captures both energetic effects ( the powers of @xmath154 weighting thermally the various states ) and entropic effects ( the ` zero ' entries corresponding to those suppressed entropically ) .",
    "we conclude that the rg scheme for the east model generalizes readily to larger block sizes .",
    "it is interesting to note that if one uses blocks of size not equal to a power of @xmath249 , one obtains a slightly different result for the dynamical exponent .",
    "we argue that this is a consequence of the hierarchical dynamics of the east model taking place naturally in blocks of lengths equal to a power of @xmath249  @xcite .",
    "we can derive the approximate value of @xmath31 that one should obtain from a coarse - graining over block sizes @xmath310 .",
    "let us take @xmath164 as an illustration .",
    "consider the coarse - grained relaxation process @xmath311 .",
    "we wish to determine the leading order temperature dependence of @xmath312 , noting that the rate for the equivalent unrenormalized process , @xmath313 , is @xmath314 . from our previous discussion of the form of the embedding matrices",
    ", we can infer that the dominant dynamical pathway ( involving ` unrenormalized ' spins ) contributing to this renormalized process is @xmath315 . to relax the second up - spin",
    ", one must create two extra up - spins to the right of the first up - spin .",
    "hence this pathway has a rate @xmath316 , and the renormalized rate @xmath317 .",
    "other pathways also contribute to the renormalized process @xmath311 , but do so either with rates @xmath318 ( e.g. @xmath319)in which case @xmath312 is changed only by a temperature - independent numerical factor  or with rates higher order in @xmath69 ( e.g. the pathway @xmath320 ) .",
    "these we may ignore .",
    "since we interpret the overall rescaling of the fundamental relaxation rate deriving from a coarse - graining of space as the numerical factor @xmath321 , we would therefore expect for @xmath164 that @xmath322 , or @xmath323 .",
    "loosely , then , we expect that by coarse - graining space in blocks of size @xmath324 one should obtain @xmath325 [ which tends to @xmath326 when @xmath327 .",
    "coarse - graining using block sizes @xmath251 yields @xmath328 .",
    "this is as we expect : the energetic barriers for relaxing chains of lengths @xmath329 and @xmath330 are identical , but the _ entropic _ barriers are larger for the latter case .",
    "thus one would expect the dynamical exponents to differ .",
    "more sophisticated arguments  @xcite reveal that @xmath31 is bounded by @xmath331 and @xmath332 .",
    "we can show that our guess for the dynamical exponent is borne out in the case @xmath164 by the rg scheme .",
    "we construct the embedding operator according to the @xmath333 where @xmath334 .",
    "together with the obvious choice for the projection operator we find @xmath335 yielding @xmath336 , as advertised .",
    "we conclude that the rg scheme for the east model can be generalized to larger block sizes , but more naturally so for the case of a blocking parameter @xmath87 equal to a power of @xmath249 . for simplicity we shall focus on the case @xmath90 .    with @xmath244 the rg recursion relation  ( [ recursion - east-0 ] )",
    "may be iterated to give @xmath337 where @xmath338 is the value of the temperature parameter following a coarse - graining of the system by a factor @xmath251 .",
    "since the bare value of @xmath339 , we see that ( [ recursion - east ] ) describes a system with an unstable zero - temperature critical point @xmath161 , and a stable high - temperature fixed point @xmath162 .",
    "now , however , the temperature parameter @xmath154 is marginally relevant near the fixed point @xmath161 .",
    "the rg flow diagram is shown in figure  [ fig : east - flow ] .    to determine the correlation length in the east model we proceed as follows . from the recursion relation ( [ recursion - east ] ) we see that the correlation length satisfies @xmath340 for small values of @xmath341 , corresponding to low temperatures , we have no solution @xmath342 of ( [ corr - east ] ) to first order in @xmath154 .",
    "thus near criticality the east model possesses no characteristic length scale .",
    "this is consistent with the nature of the space - time trajectories seen in numerical simulations , such as that shown in the right panel of figure  [ fig : traj ] .",
    "these display a fractal structure  @xcite , and hence possess no characteristic length .",
    "on sufficiently large length and time scales the system will reach equilibrium , at which point the heights of bubbles will be determined by the equilibrium spin distribution .",
    "this _ does _ have a characteristic length .",
    "one therefore expects to see , sufficiently far from criticality , the emergence of a length scale .",
    "below , we show that equation  ( [ corr - east ] ) indeed admits a growing length in such a regime .",
    "this corresponds to the eventual ` blurring out ' of the fractal boundaries of clusters as one observes the system on progressively larger scales .",
    "the emerging length scale corresponds to the spatial extent of bubble regions .",
    "we can quantify the emergence of this length by considering an infinitesimal rg transformation .",
    "the blocking parameter @xmath87 is necessarily an integer , because our model is defined on a lattice .",
    "but we can generalize @xmath87 by considering an infinitesimal change of scale according to @xmath343 , where @xmath344 . by writing @xmath345 and @xmath346",
    "we obtain the flow equations for the temperature and correlation length : @xmath347 and @xmath348 the intial data for equations  ( [ temp ] ) and  ( [ corr ] ) are @xmath349 and @xmath350 , respectively , where the subscript zero denotes an unrenormalized ( physically meaningful ) quantity .",
    "the parameter @xmath351 acts as a short distance regulator ( or ultraviolet cutoff ) , and should be taken to zero at the end of the calculation .",
    "one now iterates the rg by integrating ( [ temp ] ) until @xmath352 , yielding @xmath353 . from ( [ corr ] ) we obtain @xmath354 , and so the correlation length varies with temperature according to @xmath355 away from the critical point @xmath161 we therefore see an extremely rapid growth of the dynamical length scale with temperature .",
    "this length scale corresponds to the emergence of a characteristic length @xmath356 away from criticality , and not to an equilibrium length scale @xmath357 .",
    "the latter may be defined as the reciprocal of the particle density in the steady state ( see below ) , and scales as @xmath358 .",
    "the dynamical length is a nonequilibrium critical quantity , and will be cut off rapidly as one probes larger length and time scales .",
    "thus , in terms of the rg flow diagram , figure  [ fig : east - flow ] , the steady - state behaviour is obtained near the attractive fixed point @xmath162 , where one probes length and time scales much larger than those on which critical fluctuations are manifest .",
    "the critical behaviour will be observed on short length and time scales , near the critical fixed point @xmath161 .",
    "the characteristic equilibration time follows from the relation @xmath359 , where @xmath191 is a typical length scale .",
    "we have @xmath328 . taking the equilibrium domain length @xmath360",
    ", we find the equilibration time scale @xmath361 .",
    "this agrees with results obtained by other means  @xcite .",
    "we assume that the dynamical exponent @xmath31 obtained near criticality holds in the region of the attractive fixed point .",
    "one may also calculate  @xcite the density of particles , @xmath194 .",
    "first note that the number operator renormalizes differently depending on whether @xmath195 sits in the left or right slot of the block : @xmath362 , versus @xmath363 .",
    "hence we will define our density operator as @xmath364 .",
    "the rg recursion relation for the density then reads @xmath365    to extract the steady - state density we write ( [ east - density ] ) as @xmath198 , where @xmath366 $ ] . by iterating this equation along the rg flow",
    "we get @xmath367 n(\\lambda^{\\star}_a),\\ ] ] where @xmath201 is the steady - state density , and @xmath202 is the density at the attractive fixed point @xmath368 .",
    "next , define @xmath204 . from equations  ( [ recursion - east ] ) and ( [ east - density ] )",
    "we can write @xmath369 as in the fa model .",
    "hence @xmath370 taking @xmath371 gives @xmath212 , and by noting that @xmath213 we obtain the steady - state density @xmath372 as expected .",
    "the behaviour of the density near criticality ( @xmath161 ) follows from the relation @xmath373 , where @xmath374 .",
    "if we iterate the rg until the renormalized coupling @xmath375 , i.e. @xmath376 , we find @xmath377 .",
    "thus the density vanishes close to the critical point faster than any power of @xmath378 .",
    "in this section we will apply the rg scheme to the bcic , a model whose kinetic constraint interpolates between that of the east and fa models .",
    "we find that on suitably large length and time scales ( or for suitably low temperatures ) the bcic behaves like the fa model .",
    "this agrees with existing numerical and analytical results  @xcite .",
    "the ground state eigenvectors of the bcic ( [ interp ] ) are the same as those of the fa model . if we use ( [ proj - fa ] ) and ( [ interp ] ) we find @xmath379 equations  ( [ interp ] ) and  ( [ interp - r ] ) yield the same recursion relation for the temperature parameter @xmath154 as in the fa model , @xmath380 .",
    "they also yield a recursion relation for the asymmetery parameter @xmath12 : @xmath381 .",
    "thus the asymmetry @xmath12 is a marginal operator , and does not flow under renormalization . from the rg relation for @xmath154 , we see that for any @xmath382 the interpolation model falls in the universality class of the fa model , rather than the east model .",
    "however , we expect the interpolation model for small values of @xmath12 to display a crossover from east - like to fa - like behaviour  @xcite .",
    "this suggests that by projecting @xmath383 onto a subspace spanned by only the ground states of ( [ interp ] ) we have omitted this crossover behaviour",
    ". we can recover it in the following way .",
    "first , we note that the difference between the east and fa models manifests itself in the treatment of the states @xmath148 and @xmath142 during embedding . in the east model",
    "the latter is completely suppressed ( see equation ( [ proj ] ) ) ; in the fa model , both are treated on equal footing [ eq .  ( [ proj - fa ] ) ] . by restricting our rg scheme to a subspace of the ground states of equation ( [ interp ] ) , we are unable to construct an embedding operator that treats @xmath142 and @xmath148 asymmetrically [ cf .",
    "@xmath228 , equation ( [ proj ] ) ] .    to remedy this",
    ", we now include the first excited right eigenvector of ( [ interp ] ) in our embedding operator",
    ". we will call this eigenvector @xmath384 .",
    "this is akin to calculating higher - order `` loop '' diagrams to check if @xmath12 , ostensibly a marginal operator , is relevant at second order .",
    "@xmath384 has eigenvalue @xmath385 , and is therefore a `` gapless excitation '' in the east model limit , @xmath386 .",
    "note that @xmath387 , where the @xmath388 are functions of @xmath69 and @xmath12 . for small @xmath69 we have @xmath389 $ ] .",
    "let us now construct a new embedding operator , @xmath390 and demand that in the limits @xmath391 and @xmath392 we recover the respective embedding operators for the east and fa models , namely @xmath228 and @xmath136 .",
    "this is achieved by setting @xmath393 .",
    "we note that @xmath394 .",
    "our renormalization prescription is now @xmath395 .",
    "we derive recursion relations for the parameters @xmath69 and @xmath12 in a similar way to before : we define the unrenormalized temperature parameter @xmath154 as the ratio @xmath396 where @xmath156 is element @xmath156 of the matrix @xmath397 , equation ( [ interp ] ) .",
    "we define the renormalized parameter @xmath160 by the ratio of the corresponding elements of the renormalized matrix @xmath398 .",
    "this gives us the recursion relation @xmath399 .",
    "the parameter @xmath400 is the scaled asymmetry parameter , whose unrenormalized value we define as @xmath401 the elements @xmath156 again refer to equation ( [ interp ] ) .",
    "we write the recursion relation for @xmath400 , obtained from the elements of @xmath398 , as @xmath402 .",
    "the behaviour of the functions @xmath403 and @xmath404 thus determine the crossover properties of our model .",
    "we find that @xmath154 has an unstable zero - temperature fixed point @xmath161 , and an attractive high - temperature fixed point @xmath405 .",
    "the asymmetry @xmath400 has an unstable maximal - aysymmetry fixed point @xmath406 , corresponding to the east model , and an attractive symmetric fixed point @xmath407 , corresponding to the fa model .",
    "thus any bcic with less than maximal asymmetry will behave at long length and time scales like the fa model .",
    "figure  [ fig : bcic - flow ] shows the qualitative rg flow of the bcic .    for the case of @xmath90",
    "we find that @xmath408 where @xmath409 , @xmath410 $ ] , and @xmath411 . equations ( [ recursion - temp ] ) thus reproduce the recursion relations for @xmath154 in the east model and fa model limits , respectively equations ( [ recursion - east-0 ] ) and ( [ recursion - fa ] ) .",
    "the asymmetry parameter @xmath400 is a relevant perturbation , whose flow is governed by @xmath412 where @xmath413 $ ]",
    ".    we can deduce the flow of the bcic away from maximal asymmetry , @xmath414 , by studying equations ( [ recursion - temp ] ) and ( [ assym ] ) in the regime @xmath415 .",
    "writing @xmath416 , and a similar relation for @xmath400 , we obtain @xmath417 equations  ( [ first ] ) and  ( [ second ] ) may be solved in terms of the exponential integral function @xmath418 , although the physical interpretation of this solution is not obvious .",
    "we can more clearly determine the essence of the crossover as follows .",
    "the temperature parameter @xmath154 has rg eigenvalue 0 ( east model ) or 1 ( fa model ) .",
    "it therefore grows much less rapidly than the asymmetry parameter @xmath400 , which has ( initial ) eigenvalue @xmath419 .",
    "hence from ( [ assym ] ) we have @xmath420 , giving the rg eigenvalue for the asymmetry parameter as @xmath421 .",
    "let us now write a standard rg scaling form for the particle density , @xmath422 to derive a crossover temperature , we iterate the rg until @xmath423 . the @xmath424dependent scaling combination is then @xmath425 .",
    "when this becomes large , i.e. @xmath281 , one would expect the bcic to behave like the fa model .",
    "taking for simplicity @xmath426 , we find a crossover temperature @xmath427 .",
    "this scaling agrees with that obtained by equating the relaxation timescale for the @xmath400-suppressed symmetric process , @xmath428 with that for the asymmetric process , @xmath429  @xcite .",
    "we can extract crossover time- and length - scales from equation  ( [ rg - eqn - density ] ) by iterating the rg until , respectively , @xmath430 and @xmath431 .",
