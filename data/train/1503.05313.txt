    "phenomena of synchronization of oscillators are wide spread in nature and technology .",
    "a variety of examples can be found in electronics , laser physics , biophysics , chemistry , neuroscience , etc . @xcite .",
    "synchronization in modern experiments for optomechanical , micromechanical , electronic oscillators is investigated , e.g. see @xcite .",
    "the general picture of oscillatory modes in arrays of elementary oscillators substantially depends on a number of the elements and of the coupling type . in the simplest case of two oscillators with _ dissipative coupling _",
    "one can observe mutual mode locking of the oscillators with different natural frequencies , two - frequency quasi - periodic oscillations , the effect of `` the oscillation death '' , and the regime called the `` broadband synchronization '' specific for the oscillatory elements with non - identical control parameters @xcite .",
    "with increase of a number of the oscillatory elements the picture becomes more complicated ; many features of it have been established and understood recently @xcite .",
    "more complex is a case of _ reactive coupling _ ( termed sometimes as the conservative coupling ) @xcite . in radio - engineering and electronics , the coupling of such kind",
    "occurs in the case of presence of a reactive element ( inductance ) in the coupling circuit instead of a resistor giving rise to the dissipative coupling @xcite .",
    "a topical example of a system with the reactive coupling corresponds to ionic traps @xcite . in such traps ions",
    "are confined using variable microwave fields , which restrict a magnitude of radial oscillations of the ions , and a constant electric field , limiting the axial motions . in a trap with many electrodes ,",
    "the ions form a chain being located in the potential wells , and the nonlinearity provides the anharmonic nature of oscillations of the ions in the wells .",
    "additionally , the ions are irradiated by laser beams .",
    "the blue laser light of frequency larger than the natural frequency of the ion oscillations provides instability in the system .",
    "the red laser light of frequency less than the oscillation frequency gives rise to dissipation .",
    "the ions in the chain are coupled due to the coulomb repulsion .",
    "the simplest model of such a system is a chain of reactively coupled van der pol oscillators @xcite . in other concern",
    "the models of coupled van der pol oscillators are studied in application to biological circadian rhythms @xcite and for arrays of nanoscale mechanical resonators @xcite .",
    "the reactive coupling is a phenomenon essentially more subtle than the dissipative coupling .",
    "the reason is that when constructing a reduced phase model one must take into account the second order effects in the coupling magnitude . in the case of two oscillators in the first order approximation the coupling effects are generally not manifested . for three or more oscillators",
    "the linear terms are present , but the resulting abridged system is conservative @xcite .",
    "the case of two oscillators was discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite . there",
    "the appropriate model for dynamics of the phase variable was derived and it was shown that the synchronization effect appears only with taking into account the terms of the second order in the coupling parameter .",
    "one more feature of the dynamics with the reactive coupling is the phase bistability ; it means that depending on initial conditions the oscillators may synchronize either in phase , or in counter - phase . in the present letter",
    "we consider dynamics and synchronization in a chain of three reactively coupled van der pol oscillators .",
    "in contrast to @xcite , we will assume non - identical oscillators for frequency and focus on the discussion of structure of parameter plane of frequency detuning .",
    "the first task is derivation of correct phase equations accounting all relevant effects .",
    "then , they are studied using approaches developed in refs .",
    "we reveal possible modes of complete and partial synchronization of the oscillators , the bifurcation mechanisms of destruction of the synchronization , and describe arrangement of the parameter domains of quasi - periodic modes with different number of incommensurable frequencies .",
    "one of the main questions we discuss concerns features and distinctions of the reactive coupling in comparison with the earlier known results for the dissipative coupling .",
    "consider a set of equations @xmath1    where @xmath2 is a parameter controlling intensity of the self - oscillations , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the detuning parameters for the second and the third oscillators , and @xmath5 is the coupling constant .",
    "if the excitation parameter @xmath2 is small enough , as well as the detuning parameters , one can apply the slow - amplitude method for the analysis of the equations ( [ eq1 ] ) . using the standard approach @xcite",
    ", one can derive the following equations for the real amplitudes @xmath6 and phases of the oscillators @xmath7 ( landau - stuart equations ) : @xmath8 here @xmath9 are relative phases of the oscillators , and the parameters are normalized in respect to the small parameter @xmath2 @xcite : @xmath10 subtracting pairwise the phase equations ( 2 ) , we obtain the following equations for the relative phases : @xmath11    let us set @xmath12 , where the tilde designates perturbations of the stationary orbits @xmath13 .",
    "the amplitude equations are strongly damped @xcite , so the orbits in a short time reach roughly the stationary amplitudes with some perturbations easily estimated from ( [ eq2 ] ) as @xmath14 in turn , from the phase equations ( [ eq4 ] ) we obtain @xmath15 substituting the expressions for the perturbations from ( [ eq5 ] ) we get @xmath16 these are the correct phase equations for three reactively coupled oscillators derived up to the terms of order @xmath17 .",
    "their structure is notably more complex than that for the dissipative coupling @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the case of two oscillators @xcite , the phase equations ( [ eq7 ] ) do contain terms of the first order in the coupling strength @xmath18 , however , for proper description of the synchronization effects these terms are not sufficient . indeed ,",
    "if one neglect the quadratic terms , the matrix for perturbations of the stationary state of ( [ eq7 ] ) is @xmath19 the trace of this matrix is zero , @xmath20 .",
    "it means that a kind of `` neutral '' state occurs on the border between the stable and unstable solutions ( conservative dynamics ) .",
    "hence , in the system there is no main resonance at all in this approximation . as follows , for description of synchronization phenomena one has necessarily take into account the effects of the second order in the coupling parameter .",
    "figure 1a illustrates bifurcations of equilibrium points of the system ( [ eq7 ] ) . in the case of dissipative coupling",
    "the border of the domain of complete synchronization corresponds to a curve of degenerate saddle - node bifurcations , where simultaneous merging occurs for a pair of the saddles with the stable and the unstable nodes @xcite .",
    "for the reactive coupling the curves of the saddle - node bifurcations sn for merging of a stable node and a saddle and for an unstable node and a saddle do not coincide .",
    "moreover , here a bifurcation of andronov - hopf is possible ( designated by h ) , where the equilibrium point becomes unstable with appearance of the stable limit cycle departing from it .",
    "therefore , the region of complete synchronization in the case of reactive coupling of phase oscillators appears to be bounded both by the curves of the saddle - node bifurcations and of the line of the andronov - hopf bifurcations .",
    "also we indicate in figure 1a the points of codimension two : the cusp point cp and the bogdanov  takens point bt . in figure 1b , the domains inside of which system has one or two stable equilibria are shown using different colors .",

    "this is _ a partial mode - locking of the first and the second oscillators_. in the diagram 3(f ) one observes bounded oscillations of the relative phase of the second and thirds oscillators @xmath50 , so this is _ a partial mode - locking of the second and the third oscillators_.    we can classify regions of two - frequency modes with help of the rotation number @xmath51 . here",

    "@xmath58 of the system ( [ eq6 ] ) .",
    "if we `` switch off '' in each equation all other oscillators , in the linear approximation we obtain from ( [ eq6 ] ) @xmath59 a feature of the reactive coupling is that it shifts the partial frequencies by a value of order @xmath18 ( the shift for the central oscillator is twice as large as for the other ones because it interacts with two rather than one neighbors ) .",
    "now , let us write out the main resonances for the partial frequencies . in round brackets",
    "the respective conditions are indicated in terms of the frequency detuning parameters : @xmath60    the resonance conditions ( [ eq10 ] ) determine the centers for the wide bands of two - frequency modes in fig .  2 .",

    "they correspond to more narrow bands in fig",
    "the resonances of higher order give rise to invariant curves with larger number of intersections with the sides of the phase square .",
    "note that the resonances @xmath62 and @xmath63 determine lines of symmetry on the parameter plane , see figs . 1 and 2 .",

    "@xcite ( for the dissipative coupling the second case is typical @xcite ) . in the first case",
    "we have a limit cycle going around the unstable equilibrium point .",
    "then , both the relative phases fluctuate about some mean value .",
    "this mode may be characterized as _ a partial mode - locking of all three oscillators_. the frequency spectrum produced by the system ( [ eq1 ] ) will contain not only the basic frequency , but also a set of components associated with an additional new time scale , the period of travel of the representative point around the limit cycle of the phase model .",
    "contractible limit cycles can occur , as we have already noted , as a result of andronov - hopf bifurcation .",
    "in addition , the system can demonstrate nonlocal bifurcations when the resulting limit cycle arises from the separatrix loop of the saddle .",
    "note that several types of multistability are possible in the system with reactive coupling as seen from fig .",
    "3 . diagrams ( @xmath72-(@xmath74 correspond to situation when an equilibrium state in the phase space corresponding to the complete synchronization coexists with an invariant curve corresponding to a two - frequency quasi - periodic regime . in diagram",

    "in diagram ( @xmath76 there coexist two regimes of partial synchronization of all three oscillators .",
    "multistability affects the appearance of the lyapunov chart .",
    "namely , when choosing different initial conditions one can observe either periodic or quasi - periodic regimes , as can be seen from a comparison of figures 1 and 2 .",
    "let us illustrate the effectiveness of the phase model . for this purpose",
    "we represent the results of the bifurcation analysis of the original system ( [ eq1 ] ) at @xmath77 , figure 5 . in accordance with the renormalization rules ( 3 ) the coupling parameter @xmath78 is selected , which allows to compare figure 5 for the original system and figure 1 for the phase model .",
    "now instead of a saddle - node bifurcation of equilibria there is a corresponding bifurcation of limit cycles snc , instead of the andronov - hopf bifurcation - neimark - sacker bifurcation ns , and instead of bogdanov - takens points - points of 1:1 resonance r1 . from figure 1 and figure 5",
    "we can see that the figures are similar to each other , which indicates the effectiveness of the phase model for these values of coupling parameter .",
