    "it is now well established that all globular clusters ( or at least all those surveyed in depth ) harbour multiple populations of stars .",
    "evidence for this has been found in their spectra , which reveal different abundances of elements , and in their color - magnitude diagrams ( hereafter cmd ) , where distinct main sequences or subgiant branches are visible . while the exact mechanism is still debated , the generally accepted explanation is that these distinct populations are successive generations of stars , the later ones having formed from the ejecta of the earlier generations .",
    "other explanations for these multiple populations , such as mergers of globular clusters , original chemical inhomogeneities or pollution by interacting massive binaries @xcite , are however not excluded ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * for a recent review ) .",
    "@xmath0 centauri , the most massive globular cluster of our galaxy , stands out in this respect . while a modest spread in [ fe / h ]  ( 0.2 dex or less ) has been found in some of the most massive galactic globular clusters , the spread in @xmath0 centauri  is more than 1.5 dex ( see * ? ? ? * for a recent update ) , leading to speculations that it might be the remains of a tidally stripped dwarf galaxy .",
    "being only 5.2 kpc from the sun , @xmath0 centauri  has been extensively investigated and the properties of its stellar populations well documented .",
    "most studies use the cmd to distinguish the different stellar populations of globular clusters , and generally identify stellar sequences with slightly different ages , metallicities and more rarely different helium abundances . @xcite",
    "identify at least two main sequences in the cmd of @xmath0 centauri  and offer several possible explanations in terms of chemical abundances or pollution by background stars .",
    "@xcite identify five different populations of increasing metallicity and helium abundance in the cmd of @xmath0 centauri : a metal - poor one ( 13.1 gyr ) , three of intermediate metallicity ( 13.0 , 12.0 and 11.4 gyr ) and a metal - rich one ( 11.4 gyr ) . focusing on the subgiant branch of @xmath0 centauri , @xcite",
    "find 6 populations with internal age spreads of over 2 gyr , and some stars that are merely 4 or 5 gyr old .",
    "another way of separating different stellar populations is by their chemical abundances , using spectroscopy .",
    "since this is expensive in terms of telescope time , few studies are based on large samples of stars .",
    "@xcite , whose results are used in the present paper , determined abundances of various elements of 855 stars on the red - giant branch of @xmath0 centauri  from high - resolution ( r=20000 ) spectroscopy .",
    "they fit gaussians to the metallicity distribution of these stars , and distinguished four populations in this way : rgb - mp , rgb - int1 , rgb - int2 + 3 , rgb - a ( metal - rich ) .    in standard mono - metallic clusters ,",
    "different generations of stars can also be segregated via their location in the na - o plane . using chemical abundances in 19 globular clusters @xcite derived an empirical criterion for separating the first ( or primordial ) and second generation of stars .",
    "the former , which contains about one third of the stellar populations , is limited to [ na / fe]@xmath2 na@xmath3 + 0.3 . in the latter they distinguished an intermediate component , which contains about 60 to 70% of the stellar populations and an infrequent extreme one , which is mainly present in more massive clusters . as will be discussed below",
    ", the mixture of stellar populations in @xmath0 centauri  is too complex for their criterion to be applicable .",
    "there is thus ample evidence for multiple populations in @xmath0 centauri , as well as in other globular clusters , but the methods for distinguishing them are rather empirical , using generally one parameter ( the metallicity ) or two ( those of the cmd ) .",
    "@xcite were the first to apply a method of multivariate analysis to separate the stellar populations of globular clusters .",
    "they used the data of @xcite , and applied a k - means algorithm to four parameters of 797 stars : [ fe / h ] , [ na / o ] , the average of the abundances of si , ca , and ti , and the abundance of la .",
    "they opted for 6 groups ( in k - means the number of groups is an input parameter ) , which they further rearranged into three main groups according to metallicity .",
    "they did not consider these three main groups as successive generations , because the na - o anticorrelation is present in the first two , suggesting the presence of first- and second - generation stars in both .",
    "na and o are correlated in the third main group , unlike in any other globular cluster , but the authors found no evidence for an external origin of these stars .",
    "@xcite used low - resolution ( r=1600 ) spectroscopic data of 221 red giants in @xmath0 centauri  to derive their effective temperature , gravity and four abundances , to which they added two abundances from @xcite .",
    "they performed a k - means analysis on six parameters ( [ fe / h ]  and the abundances of c , n , o , na and ba ) under the assumption of four groups .",
    "the analysis revealed a low - metallicity group ( which they identify as the primordial population ) , two intermediate - metallicity ones differing in their o and na abundances ( one of them presumably helium - enriched ) and a high - metallicity group ( in which na and o are correlated ) .",
    "the two intermediate - metallicity groups are blended in the cmd ; when combined , they show the well - known na - o anticorrelation .",
    "the authors identified their low- and high metallicity groups with the corresponding ones of @xcite . in one of their proposed scenarios",
    "the intermediate - metallicity group of high o abundance would be the last one to form , from the gas of the primordial generation , after a gas - sweeping passage through the galactic plane .",
    "in a subsequent study @xcite they classified 848 stars , 557 of which are new ones , into these four groups through a kind of decision tree .",
    "they concluded that formation models of globular clusters and their stellar populations do not provide a consistent picture for the four groups .    in the present paper",
    "we repeat the analyses of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite using a different method of multivariate analysis , that of maximum parsimony ( cladistics , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which requires no a priori assumption about the number of groups , and which does precisely what the other statistical methods are unable to do : order the groups chronologically .",
    "in all this paper , the cladistic analyses were performed with paup*4.0b10 @xcite with the parameters discretized into 30 equal - width bins , which play the role of discrete evolutionary states .",
    "more details are given in appendix  [ app : details ] .",
    "we also apply the k - means algorithm to the data , in order to test the reproducibility of statistical analyses with k - means , and compare the results given by the two methods ( see more details on the methods in * ? ? ?",

    "we now attempt to relate our groups to populations and/or successive generations of stars . and , to this end , look for evidence of external pollution in the chemical properties of the groups .",
    "the oc1 group is obviously a primordial population .",
    "it has the lowest mean value of most chemical elements , such as [ na / fe ] , [ al / fe ] , [ ni / fe ] , [ laii / fe ] , la / eu , [ @xmath4/fe ] , and a high [ o / fe ] . at variance with the other groups",
    ", there is no marked evolution of the abundances with rank within the group , except perhaps ni and eu .",
    "the main evolution with rank is a decrease in the v and k magnitudes and in t@xmath5 and log(g ) , which were not used in the statistical analysis .",
    "the group has a spatial distribution that is close to the mean one in the cluster , and rotates as expected from the mass distribution of the cluster @xcite , suggesting that it is dynamically relaxed .",
    "finally , this group has 31% of the stars , which is about the expected percentage for the primordial population ( see sect .  [ introduction ] ) .",
    "we find three hints of external pollution in the chemical properties of the oc2 group : the presence of the na - o anticorrelation and a large spread in [ laii / euii ] in the oc2a group , and a significantly larger [ ni / fe ]   in the oc2b group .",
    "the na - o anticorrelation is generally attributed to pollution from h - burning at high temperature , in either fast rotating massive stars @xcite or intermediate - mass asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars @xcite .",
    "ni is a heavier element than fe , thus produced in supernova nucleosynthesis .",
    "@xcite attribute the increasing la / eu in @xmath0 centauri  to pollution by agb stars after gas removal by supernovae of type ii ( hereafter sn ii ) at the end of a first episode of star formation .",
    "we note however that these two groups have the same o abundance as oc1 , and that they are not markedly he - enriched , indicating that they formed from gas that was not much polluted .",
    "the oc2c group belongs to the oc2 group , but , like the oc3c group , differs markedly from the other groups of its main group , and these two outstanding groups should be discussed together .",
    "both are significantly he - enriched ( see table  [ table : isochrones ] ) and have high [ @xmath4/fe ] ; this makes them likely to belong to a secondary population .",
    "the difference is in [ al / fe ] , low in oc2c and high in oc3c .",
    "both groups are also spatially extended , while oc2a and oc3a are centrally concentrated .",
    "the group oc3 is significantly al - richer than the other groups .",
    "al - rich stars must be second - generation stars because of the high temperatures necessary for the mgal reaction @xcite , which can not be reached in low - mass stars . furthermore , since he is the main outcome of hot h burning , these polluted stars must also be he - enriched .",
    "however , only oc3c and oc3b are significantly he - enriched ( see table  [ table : isochrones ] ) .",
    "the group oc3a , is very similar to oc2a and oc2b , except for [ al / fe ] , which is the highest of all groups , and [ o / fe ] , which is low enough to make it part of an extreme secondary population .",
    "an na - o correlation , rather than anticorrelation , is present in oc3c .",
    "it can be explained by advocating super - agb stars of masses between 6.5 and 8 m@xmath6 , whose ejecta contribute to the formation of new stars about 120 to 200 myr after the first generation @xcite .    in summary , there is evidence for increasing external pollution in the stars of oc2a and oc3a , but the outstanding properties of oc2c and oc3c , as well as the properties of oc3a , intermediate between those of oc2a and oc3a , do not call for a simple division of the sample into three populations , let alone successive generations , of stars , as done by @xcite for monometallic globular clusters .",
    "the next step is to use the spatial and kinematical properties of the groups , as well as their chemical ones , to identify possible origins for the enriched gas that produced the secondary populations .",
    "this gas was either expelled by winds from earlier stars or by supernovae .",
    "gas ejected from stars with strong winds will disperse in interstellar space .",
    "such stars can be either fast rotating massive stars or massive agbs ; the gas will thus be produced a few tens or hundreds of myr after the onset of the star formation event .",
    "some of this gas may form stars when it is shocked during a passage of the cluster through the galactic plane @xcite , before the gas density in the disc is high enough for ram pressure stripping to occur @xcite .",
    "since the period of rotation of @xmath0 centauri  is 120 myr @xcite , this plane crossing is likely to happen every 60 myr . @xcite",
    "have found evidence for disc shocking in @xmath0 centauri , in the form of a tidal tail aligned with the tidal field gradient .",
    "the stars formed in this way will show little mean rotation , if any .",
    "the remainder of the ejected gas will likely fall radially into the strong potential well of the cluster , generating stars that will move in very elongated orbits .",
    "the gas that originates in stars with slower winds will presumably follow the stars in their orbits until close to the pericenter , where it collides with other gas clouds and settles into circular orbits , along which stars will form .",
    "this scenario , which is inspired from the one proposed by @xcite to interpret the properties of first- and second - generation dwarf stars in the galaxy , can explain oc3 .",
    "the group oc3c ( chemically evolved and spatially extended ) shows little or no mean rotation , while oc3a and oc3b ( chemically evolved and centrally concentrated ) have the fastest mean rotation .",
    "this faster rotation has also been predicted by @xcite ; his hydrodynamical simulations show that the gaseous ejecta from agb stars produce stars with different kinematics from the ones of the primordial population , namely a higher mean rotation and a lower mean velocity dispersion . in any case ,",
    "oc3a and oc3b have to be fairly young , because this kinematical difference with the other groups can not survive many gigayears of dynamical friction .",
    "the core relaxation time ( at a radius of 2.5 arcmin ) of @xmath0 centauri  is 4 gyr ( * ? ? ?",
    "* edition ) , suggesting ages of that order .",
    "there are alternative explanations for faster rotation , either the gravo - gyro instability , which affects massive stars more than others @xcite , or a central binary black - hole , which produces `` suprathermal '' stars at a few core radii @xcite , but such mechanisms do not favor metal - rich stars over metal - poor ones .",
    "supernova explosions are the most common source of enriched gas in the galaxy .",
    "the progenitors of sn ii are massive stars , whose lifetime is shorter than 100 myr , and can be as short as a few myr for the most massive ones .",
    "the progenitors of sn 1a are binary stars ; their peak of occurrence is 40 - 50 myr @xcite or 100 myr @xcite .",
    "however their frequency in globular clusters is probably much lower than that of sn ii @xcite .",
    "both types are more likely to occur in the central region of the cluster , where massive and binary stars are preferentially found .",
    "sn ii produce o and @xmath4-elements , but little fe , while sn 1a produce mainly @xmath7ni ( which decays to form @xmath7fe ) , and other isotopes of ni in lower proportions , but not @xmath4-elements , so that [ @xmath4/fe ]   actually decreases ( * ? ? ?",
    "* , their table 3 ) .",
    "sn 1a enrichment has been found in a few stars of the metal - rich `` rgb - a '' branch of @xmath0 centauri  @xcite . according to @xcite ,",
    "sn 1a occur in small pockets of gas before being mixed with the interstellar medium , at variance with sn ii , which pollute the interstellar medium uniformly .",
    "stars formed in these pockets are thus likely to retain the angular momentum of the progenitor gas clouds .",
    "this mechanism could explain the formation of oc2b , although its [ @xmath4/fe ]  is not lower than average .",
    "the problem with enrichment by sn ii is that these might be too energetic events for the gas to be retained by the cluster ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although radiative losses may prevent this from happening in a very massive cluster @xcite .",
    "sn events might not be an important source of enriched gas , thus perhaps not at the origin of the groups beyond oc1 , but they can very well have triggered star formation by compressing and heating the gas enriched by other means .",
    "the formation scenario for the different groups of stars in @xmath0 centauri  must call on discrete events .",
    "this is required by the distinct isochrones found in the cmd of the cluster ( see sect .  [ introduction ] ) , which lend credibility to our clustering of the stars into groups with distinct properties .",
    "another requirement of the scenario is to take into account the large metallicity spread in the primordial and secondary populations , which is unique among galactic globular clusters .",
    "the current favored explanation is that the cluster is the remnant of a captured dwarf galaxy ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "our analysis has not enabled us to provide an explanation for the large metallicity spread in the primordial group .    in the primordial population ( oc1 )",
    ", the red - giant branch is the narrowest and the abundances are the least dispersed and the most constant with rank , compared to the other groups .",
    "these are properties of a population formed over a short period of time in a single event of star formation ( a single generation , making a true isochrone ) in a homogeneous environment ( very little spread in the evolutionary track ) .    judging from the chemical properties of the different groups and from their tracks on the cmd , oc2 and oc3",
    "must have formed successively from progressively enriched gas .",
    "we propose that oc2 formed from early sn explosions , before agb pollution had time to enrich the gas , except perhaps for oc2a , in which there is some evidence for the na - o anticorrelation .",
    "the group oc2b is enriched in o and ni , which indicates pollution from sn 1a ejecta .",
    "this group is also more concentrated than oc2a and oc2c . in order to explain the high rotational velocity of this group",
    ", we have to assume that the sn 1a pockets formed near the center in or after the re - collapse phase at the end of the sn ii events , thus acquiring kinetic energy .",
    "the group oc2c formed over the full extent of the cluster during early galactic plane crossings .",
    "the group oc3 , which has the highest [ al / fe ]   and [ na / fe ]  and the lowest [ o / fe ] , formed last , in an interstellar medium o - depleted and na - enriched , and also possibly he - enriched , by relatively massive agb stars .",
    "the groups oc3a and oc3b formed by the mechanism proposed by @xcite in the central regions , with higher rotation velocities , while oc3c formed like oc2c .",
    "we realise that many questions are left unanswered by this scenario but it outlines possible reasons for the existence of seven distinct groups of stars .",
    "we have performed a multivariate statistical analysis of the chemical properties of star samples in @xmath0 centauri . at variance with previous studies of the stellar populations of this cluster , we made no a priori assumptions about the number of groups .",
    "in addition , our technique for obtaining the grouping is based on the relationships between the stars and not on their similarities , an approach that is suited to find populations and generations .",
    "using the full range of known chemical properties , rather than just metal abundances , allows one to perform a clustering into groups that is much more efficient at revealing the distinctive properties of the stellar populations in a sample that at first sight shows a bewildering array of chemical , spatial and kinematical properties .",
    "we found seven groups , which can be gathered into three main groups , and identified oc1 as the primordial population .",
    "the other groups show progressive chemical enrichment , while retaining distinct properties , for which we provide a tentative interpretation in terms of locus and mechanism of formation .",
    "group oc2b formed near the center from snia ejecta and oc2a formed after agb stars had chemically enriched the interstellar medium . oc3a and",
    "oc3b formed later , from the ejecta of stars with slow winds , oc3a being still dynamically unrelaxed .",
    "oc3c formed like oc2c , during galactic plane crossings , but at a later stage of formation of the galaxy .",
    "our proposed clustering into groups lifts the contradictions between the results of earlier studies relative to the spatial distribution and kinematics of the different stellar populations , which can not be distinguished by metallicity alone .",
    "it also proposes directions in which future investigations could proceed to explain the uncovered properties . in particular , it remains to be shown whether the na - o correlation found in oc3c can be produced by star formation during galactic plane crossings , and whether the he - rich stars presently observed in globular clusters should on average be more massive than if they had formed with a normal he abundance .",
    "we thank aaron dotter for comments on the dartmouth models , and andr maeder for his comments on a preliminary version of this paper .",
    "we warmly thank the referee , grabriele gratton , for his very construitive comments that helped us improve the paper .",

    "the cladistic analysis in astrophysics ( astrocladistic ) has been presented in detail in several papers @xcite .",
    "we refer the reader to these references for a complete description of the method used here .",
    "phylogenetic systematics relies on synapomorphies , which are derived character states , to infer common ancestry relationships .",
    "such characters may be viewed as evolutionary novelties appearing in a particular lineage .",
    "it is assumed that two closely relative objects share derived characters , which presumably originate in their common ancestor .    an important advantage of phylogenetic systematics is to avoid the grouping of objects based on similarities due to evolutionary convergences or reversals .",
    "the success of a cladistic analysis depends on the behaviour of the parameters .",
    "in particular , it is sensitive to redundancies , incompatibilities , and especially to homoplasies ( reversals , parallel and convergent evolutions ) .",
    "the use of the parsimony principle minimises the number of homoplasies ( see below ) .",
    "we have discarded vmag and teff since they are certainly homoplasies ( see sect .",
    "[ stat735 ] ) .",
    "the seven chemical parameters used for the analysis can reasonably be considered as synapomorphies since these abundances are generated within stars before being ejected to form new stars .",
    "hence they are specific to the ancestors that gave birth to a given population .",
    "nevertheless , we can not not guarantee them to be perfect synapomorphies because of measurement uncertainties and of our lack of a complete and thorough understanding of the chemical evolution of the gas within stars and during ejection .",
    "the values for each parameter were discretized into 30 equal - width bins representing supposedly evolutionary states .",
    "this choice of 30 bins is justified by a fair representation of the diversity and of the continuous nature of the data , as well as a good stability of the analysis in the sense that the result does not depend on the number of bins .",
    "we imposed all the parameters to be ordered , i.e. changes between two adjacent states are more probable than between distant ones , independently from the sense of the change .",
    "we believe that this is a fair measure of the cost of evolution for continuous parameters .",
    "we adopted the popular parsimony criterion , which selects the most parsimonious tree among all possible arrangements because it represents the simplest evolutionary scenario compatible with the input data .",
    "this optimal tree corresponds to the minimum number of changes of states for all parameters that occur along the paths between all objects .",
    "this number is unique to each tree .",
    "the maximum parsimony searches were performed using the heuristic algorithm implemented in the paup*4.0b10 @xcite package .",
    "heuristic methods do not explore the parameter space of all possible tree arrangements , which would take a prohibitive computer time for hundreds of objects , but try to find the minima .",
    "they can not guarantee finding the absolute most parsimonious trees but generally require far less computer time while being quite effective .",
    "fig  [ fig_treeunrooted ] is a majority - rule consensus tree reflecting the most common features in all equally most parsimonious trees .",
    "the careful examination of the resulting tree must be performed to check a posteriori the behaviour of the parameters .",
    "firstly , the robustness of the tree is a good indicator of the quality of the characters ( see below ) .",
    "secondly , the evolution of the parameters along the tree can use for instance fig .",
    "[ fig_evoltree ] or fig .",
    "[ fig_boxplots ] .",
    "note that this should ideally be done with the binned parameters .",
    "other analyses can then be repeated after removal of suspicious parameters .",
    "for instance , [ sc / fe ]  and [ ni / fe ]  seem to be too much variable on fig .",
    "[ fig_evoltree ] .",
    "an analysis without these two parameters still produce the three main groups .",
    "the robustness of the tree was assessed in the following way :    1 .",
    "using several analyses modifying sligthly the set of parameters .",
    "this is the philosophy of the bootstrap technique , which would be too much time consuming due to the large number of objects . in all cases ,",
    "the result did not change much in the sense that the three main groups can be identified quite easily .",
    "2 .   considering the quality of the consensus tree .",
    "a consensus is a summary of all the equally parsimonious trees found by the software .",
    "we found each node to be present at least in 89% of the 9517 equally parsimonious trees , most being in 99 or 100% cases .",
