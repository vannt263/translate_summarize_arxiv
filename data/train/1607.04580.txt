    "<S> we use experimental limits on lorentz violation to obtain new constraints on kaluza - klein - type theories in which the extra dimensions may be large but do not necessarily have units of length . the associated variation in fundamental quantities such as rest mass must occur slowly , on cosmological scales .    current approaches to unification of fundamental interactions based on extra dimensions generally assume that those dimensions are compact ( as in string theories ) or mere mathematical contrivances ( as in projective theories ) , or that they are large but `` off limits '' to standard - model fields ( as in brane theories ) . here </S>",
    "<S> we explore the alternative idea that extra dimensions may be large but may not share the lengthlike character of the three macroscopic spatial dimensions ( as in space - time - matter theory).@xcite    any fifth coordinate @xmath0 will introduce an additional term in the lorentz factor of special relativity , as follows : @xmath1 where @xmath2 and we maintain an open mind with regard to signature . </S>",

    "<S> constraints on the rms parameters @xmath14 come from tests of the relativistic doppler effect , known as the ives - stilwell ( is ) experiment ; and from the kennedy - thorndike ( kt ) experiment , a modified form of the original michelson - morley experiment with arms of different length . </S>",

    "<S> the weakness of this constraint follows from the tiny value of the dimension - transposing constant @xmath21 in everyday units .    </S>",
    "<S> a possible interpretation of the constraint  ( [ betaconstraint ] ) is that there is a slow variation in the masses of elementary particles on cosmological timescales . indeed , dividing by the mass of the observable universe , @xmath22 ( where @xmath23 , @xmath24 is the hubble expansion rate , @xmath25 the age of the universe , and @xmath26 from observation ) , we find that @xmath27 . on this interpretation </S>",

    "<S> this could perhaps be regarded as a geometrical counterpart to the higgs mechanism , with the degree of freedom inherent in a scalar field being associated instead with a new coordinate . </S>",
    "<S> related ideas have been explored by others.@xcite    there is a satisfying symmetry in placing mass on the same footing as space and time , since these are the three base dimensions of fundamental physics . </S>",
    "<S> other possibilities exist as well . </S>",
    "<S> the fundamental constants give us three possible dimension - transposing factors @xmath28 , which we might guess involve gravity , relativity and particle physics respectively . </S>",
