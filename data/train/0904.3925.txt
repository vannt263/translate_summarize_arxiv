    "previous papers from this project include paper i reporting our first results ( harris et al .",
    "2003 ) , paper ii which focused on the  data ( perlman et al .",
    "2003 ) , paper iii which was mainly on the x - ray lightcurve of hst-1 which delineated the massive flare in 2005 ( harris et al . 2006 ) and paper iv , the  results showing superluminal proper motions in hst-1 ( cheung , harris & stawarz 2007 ) .    in this paper ( v of the series )",
    ", we present an analysis of the lightcurves for the nucleus , the jet knot hst-1 which is 0.86from the core and which is the site of the massive x - ray , uv , and radio flare described in paper iii , knot d , and knot a. knot a was mainly used as a control source since we do not expect short timescale variability because it is well resolved in all bands .",
    "the lightcurve of knot d illuminates the effects of hst-1 on adjacent regions since it appears to have very little if any intrinsic variability on the timescales of interest here . in ",
    "[ sec : xray ] , [ sec : uv ] , and [ sec : radio ] we describe the data and the analyses methods . in ",
    "[ sec : rise ] we use the rising segments of the lightcurves to derive upper limits on the size of the emitting regions , and in   [ sec : decay ] we examine the decay timescales of hst-1 in x - rays , uv , and radio bands in order to isolate signatures of @xmath0 losses .",
    "we describe newly discovered oscillations in the brightening and fading of hst-1 in   [ sec : impulse ] .",
    "finally , in   [ sec : compare ] , we discuss the evidence for short timescales in the x - ray variability of the nucleus and hst-1 which is relevant to the question of the location of the variable tev emission reported by the hess collaboration @xcite , magic @xcite , and veritas ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "some preliminary results from this work were reported in @xcite .",
    "we take the distance to m87 to be 16 mpc @xcite so that 1@xmath5 corresponds to 77 pc . throughout this paper",
    "we assume that the radio to x - ray emission from all parts of the m87 jet comes from synchrotron emission , as argued in our previous papers ( i & iii ) .",
    "in particular , we assume the x - ray nuclear emission is dominated by synchrotron emission from components of the inner ( unresolved ) jet rather than by thermal processes associated with the accretion disk around the central black hole .",
    "since 2002 , we have observed m87 with  67 times each observing season with 5 ks exposures typically separated by six weeks . additionally in 2005 , near the maximum of the x - ray lightcurve of hst-1 , we scheduled weekly observations to constrain shorter timescale variability ( epochs ya to yg ; see table  [ tab : obs ] ) .",
    "after the report of variable tev emission in the 2005 hess observations of m87 by @xcite , we obtained director s discretionary time ( ddt ) observations to sample the x - ray lightcurves on @xmath623 day timescales during two dark time fortnights in feb . and mar . of 2007 when tev observations were scheduled ( epochs ys to zb ) .",
    "a total of 61 observations have been obtained from these programs thus far .    for details of our reduction procedures ,",
    "see papers  i & iii .",
    "briefly , we use a 1/8th segment of the back illuminated s3 chip of the acis detector aboard .",
    "this permits us to have a frame time of 0.4s with 90% efficiency .",
    "although this setup was essentially free of pileup when @xcite tested various options during 2000 july , with the advent of the ever increasing brightness of hst-1 , pileup @xcite became a major problem so we switched to a detector based measure of intensity : kev / s .",
    "this approach uses the event 1 file with no grade filtering ( so as to recover all events affected by grade migration ) and we integrated the energy from 0.2 to 17 kev so as to recover all the energy of the piled events .",
    "other uncertainties for piled events comes from the on - board filtering , the eat - thy - neighbor effect , and second order effects such as release of trapped charge ( see   [ sec : pileupprob ] ) .",
    "although we used small circular apertures for fluxmap photometry in paper i , the basic analysis for this paper adopts the rectangular regions used in paper iii so as to encompass more of the point spread function ( psf ) .",
    "the 4 regions of interest ( the core , hst-1 , knots d and a ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : regions ] ; we did not use background subtraction because the photometric apertures were small .    all events within each rectangle",
    "are weighted by their energy and the sum of these energies , when divided by the exposure times , gives the final kev / s value used in the lightcurve .",
    "uncertainties are strictly statistical , based on the number of counts measured : @xmath7 and typically range from 1% to 5% .",
    "to analyze and compare timescales , we measure the slope between adjacent measurements ( and also between every other observation ) by calculating the ratio , @xmath8 , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the intensities at the times @xmath11 and @xmath12 and @xmath13 } = t_{\\rm 2}-t_{\\rm 1}$ ] . to convert this to a fractional change we divide by @xmath14 ,",

    "( hereafter , the superscripts are suppressed where the signs are implicit ) . according to this definition ,",
    "the doubling time for a given value of @xmath19 is simply @xmath20 } = 1 / fpy$ ] , thus when @xmath211 , there was a rate of change which would produce a factor of two increase or decrease in @xmath22 in one year .",
    "the uncertainties in each value of @xmath22 are propagated to the first derivative by calculating the square root of the sum of the squares of the errors on intensity . denoting @xmath23 as the uncertainty of @xmath24",
    ", we express the error of  as :    @xmath25    here i=1 , j=2 for the error on , and i=2 , j=1 for .",
    "the @xmath19 values are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig:4fpy ] for the nucleus , hst-1 , knots d and a. the latter two features serve as controls , and display the expected behavior for a steady source : at long time intervals , @xmath19 values are consistent with zero and have small uncertainties .",
    "the errors increase as @xmath26 decreases . since all errors are 1@xmath27 ( @xmath7 ) , some values for knots d and a appear to be different from zero , as expected .",
    "in the next section we discuss using the readout streak for estimating source intensity and in the appendix (   [ sec : pileupprob ] ) we describe some of the other problems engendered by pileup .",
    "the only check we have been able to devise is read - out streak photometry ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for this procedure",
    ", we isolate the segments of the readout streak which are not close to the jet . with long thin rectangles ( n@xmath282 pixels ; fig .",
    "[ fig : regions ] ) , and adjacent rectangles to measure the background , we estimate the effective exposure time for the net counts as ( # frames ) @xmath29s , where @xmath30=length of rectangles in pixels . in a typical 5 ks observation ,",
    "we are thus able to get the equivalent of 30 to 40 seconds worth of continuous clocking mode data which are free of pileup effects but suffer from poor s / n because of the necessarily large background area . while the general behavior of the streak photometry is consistent with the expectation that it would become increasingly larger than the standard photometry as the intensity of hst-1 increased ( more pileup and more on - board rejection ) , there are a few unexpected departures from this behavior .",
    "in particular , there are some high values where both methods give the same intensity , and there is one segment of low intensity where the streak photometry is significantly less than the standard photometry . for these reasons we rely on our standard photometry and relegate the results of the readout streak photometry to the status of caveats and alternate possibilities.",
    "the uv data used in this paper were obtained from a series of proposals ( biretta , pi ) which were synchronized with the observations although for various reasons not every observations has a corresponding  observation .",
    "the data were reduced with the usual procedures and will be described in a separate paper ( biretta , in preparation ) .",
    "the 15 ghz observations were obtained as part of our multi - frequency program coordinated with the  and monitoring and began mid-2003 . in each  cycle , we observed m87 in three 8 hr runs ( program codes ah822 , ah862 , ah885 , ac843 ) : two in a array followed by one in b array .",
    "the beam sizes were typically around 0.15@xmath31 and 0.4@xmath31 , respectively .",
    "the longer gaps occur during c and d array configurations when the angular resolution is not sufficient to separate the nucleus and hst-1 .    the observations utilized two adjacent 50 mhz wide intermediate frequencies centered at 14.94 ghz .",
    "a total of 11.5 hrs of on - source time was split between 9 - 10 scans over each 8 hr run to obtain good @xmath32 coverage .",
    "the data were calibrated in aips @xcite with the flux density scale set using scans of 3c286 and the initial phase corrections determined with a nearby calibrator .",
    "subsequent phase and amplitude self - calibration was performed using the caltech difmap package @xcite .",
    "an additional archival b - array dataset ( bk073 ) was analyzed to give us the data point in january 2000 , before our monitoring began .",
    "the observation used an identical setup to ours but with only four 3.5 min scans obtained .",
    "this was sufficient to detect a faint ( 2.8 mjy ) feature at the position of hst-1 , thus providing a baseline measurement to our subsequent ones .",
    "as described in earlier papers of this series , the rise of the light curve can give estimates of the source size so long as the beaming parameters  the bulk lorentz factor of the jet ( @xmath33 ) , the angle between the jet and our line of sight ( @xmath34 ) , and the doppler beaming factor ( @xmath35 )  are not changing .    for the standard analysis of the x - ray light curve of hst-1 , the largest observed slope occurred early in 2004 and had a value of @xmath36 ( fig .",
    "[ fig:4fpy ] ) ; the intensity doubled during our 6-week sampling interval .",
    "thus we are able to set an upper limit to the characteristic size of the emitting region in the jet frame of diameter @xmath37 light years ( 45 light days ) .",
    "significantly larger values of @xmath19 occur for the hst-1 light curve generated from the readout streak photometry (   [ sec : readout ] ) , but these have large uncertainties so do not yield useful limits on the source size .",
    "the smallest directly measured value for the size of hst-1 comes from the  beamsize of 3 mas which corresponds to 0.7 light years ( paper iv ) . if the x - ray and radio emitting volumes were to be one and the same ( i.e. , the upstream end of hst-1 ) , and",
    "if the radio size is actually similar to our  resolution , then @xmath35 would be of order 5 , a value similar to that estimated in our previous papers .",
    "because of the second order effects which were prevalent when hst-1 was strong , we have restricted our analyses of the nuclear @xmath19 data to ( a ) 2000 - 2003 plus 2008 when hst-1 was at a low intensity ( less than 2 kev / s ) , and ( b ) 2006 - 2007 when the hst-1 intensity was at an intermediate value ( 2 to 4 kev / s ) .",
    "the data between 2 and 4 kev / s are used because this time interval includes the closely spaced observations of 2007 .",
    "we believe the second order effects for this intensity regime are minimal because although the light curve of the nucleus shows a very obvious featue corresponding to the peak of hst-1 in 2005 , there is no apparent correlation between the intensity of the nucleus and that of hst-1 for the 2006 - 2007 data .",
    "these data are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cchlowmed ] .    during low intensity intervals ,",
    "the maximum value of  was about 12 ( a light travel time of @xmath38 light days ) , although there were no closely spaced observations during these periods so that larger  values may have been missed because of inadequate sampling . when hst-1 was at intermediate levels ( @xmath624 kev / s ) , we had the closely spaced observations during 2007 feb and mar from the ddt project and the maximum  for the core was 28.5@xmath395.6 , but we take a value of 19 ( light travel time : @xmath40 light days ) as a characteristic value since the second largest value was 18.8@xmath391.1 .    2",

    "in this section , we analyze the decay of the light curves of hst-1 at x - ray , uv , and radio wavelengths ( fig .  [ fig : roxlc ] ) .",
    "we will not attempt to make a parallel investigation of the nuclear emission because we have no information as to the size of the emitting volume or its geometry , the interpretation of the uv data would be problematic , and although likely , it remains to be demonstrated that the nuclear x - ray emission is actually non - thermal emission from the inner jet rather than from some thermal process associated with the accretion disk or its environs .",
    "the decay of the light curve may be caused by several effects but has the potential to reveal which processes are dominant .",
    "if all bands have similar rates of decreasing intensity , the most likely cause is either a change in the beaming factor ( as might arise from a change in @xmath34 ) or a general expansion which reduces the energy of all electrons according to their energy ( the so called `` @xmath41 losses '' ) as well as reducing the magnetic field strength .",
    "note however that if the emitted spectrum is not a simple power law , but for example steepens at high frequencies , then a simple expansion may produce a much stronger decay at high frequencies both because the previously viewed electrons for a fixed observing band are now replaced by the fewer ( previously higher energy ) electrons and also because of the weaker b field , the fixed observing band now comes from an even higher energy segment of the electron distribution .",
    "our preliminary analysis of paper iii indicated that the initial decrease of the major flare had a similar timescale as the preceding rise , and that this might be indicative of either a changing @xmath35 , or a compression and subsequent expansion .",
    "however , it has become clear that although the uv and x - ray light curves appeared to have a similar behavior initially , there are instrumental effects present which were not recognized , there are significant differences in the uv and x - ray decays and the radio intensity did not conform to the rapid decay seen at higher frequencies ( fig .",
    "[ fig : roxlc ] ) .",
    "we investigate two aspects of this problem .",
    "first , we examine the behavior of the uv and radio lightcurves at times when large rates of decay are observed at x - rays , and second we compare the @xmath19 values between bands without regard to when they occurred .",
    "both of these approaches suffer from the sparser sampling in the radio .",
    "although most of the uv data were obtained within a week of the observations , not every  observation has a corresponding observation .",
    "this approach is based on the assumption that all 3 wavelength bands come from the same emitting volume .",
    "if however , the emitting volume is layered ( e.g. , concentric spheres with longer wavelengths coming from larger volumes ) , then it would be possible to have different characteristic decay times for each layer ( assuming different values of the magnetic field strength ) , and the decays in the light curves would not have to happen at the same time since the cessation of injection of particles and fields would not necessarily be simultaneous in all emitting volumes .    the most significant ( i.e. , without excessively large uncertainties ) decays in the x - ray lightcurve occurred in ( a ) 2002.0 ( @xmath42 ) , ( b ) 2005.5 ( @xmath43 ) , and ( c ) 2007.7 ( @xmath44 ) .    for event ( a )",
    ", we have no relevant radio values of @xmath19 and the uv sampling was not sufficient : the uv intensity rose from 28 to 52 @xmath45jy between 2001.58 and 2002.16 .",
    "the decay in the x - rays occurred between 2002.044 and 2002.119 .",
    "event ( b ) occurred after the peak of the giant flare .",
    "this is perhaps the best example of what might be expected from @xmath0 losses affecting the electron energy distribution ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : roxlc ] ) .",
    "however , as mentioned above , we ca nt rule out the possibility of an expansion of the source if the x - rays are coming from a segment of the electron distribution that is falling more rapidly than the power law connecting the uv to the x - ray .",
    "the @xmath19 value for the uv is 0.85@xmath390.86 .",
    "the third notable decline in the x - ray light curve came during the 3 months in 2007 whilst m87 was behind the sun ( aug . - nov . ) .",

    "values , the first derivative of the light curves .",
    "coding is the same as the upper panel except no line is added to the 2 radio data , both of which are consistent with zero .",
    "note the shoulder in the uv lightcurve following the peak .",
    "this can also be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : roxlc ] , and leads to the much smaller values of di / dt for the uv than for the x - ray .",
    "the radio lightcurve is essentially flat topped and shows no change during the year . ]",
    "if the x - ray  value of 3.5 during the main decay phase ( event b , fig .",
    "[ fig : rox2005 ] ) was dominated by @xmath0 losses , we can make an order of magnitude estimate for the magnetic field strength .",
    "note that we do not consider here a detailed evolution of the synchrotron flux produced by the radiatively cooling electron energy distribution as considered in , e.g. , @xcite , but we can approximate the cooling time required to drop the intensity by a factor of two by assuming that this decay is caused by a factor of two fewer electrons with energies providing the bulk of the observed x - rays between 0.2 and 6 kev .",
    "further , we assume the exponent of the electron distribution , p=2@xmath46 + 1=3.4 , which is our best estimate for the spectrum of hst-1 in the x - ray band @xcite .",
    "since de / dt to first approximation shifts the power law distribution , n(e ) to lower energies , we require an energy shift of 2@xmath47 or 0.8 . we then ask what magnetic field strength , b is required to produce a 20% energy loss in the time , @xmath48 , it takes for the intensity to fall by a factor of two . the observed time",
    ", @xmath49 is 1/3.5=0.28yr ; in the jet frame @xmath50=@xmath51 where @xmath35 is the beaming factor .    with the standard equations ( 3.28 and 3.32 ) from @xcite , setting @xmath50de / dt=0.2e ( where e is the energy of the electron ) , and changing jet frame parameters to the observer frame , we find    @xmath52    here @xmath53 is the observed time for the intensity to drop by a factor of two and @xmath54 is the characteristic energy of the x - ray band . for our parameters , this reduces to b@xmath55=1.1 mg , and for @xmath35=5 , 0.6 mg , a value reasonably consistent with the 1 mg derived on the basis of equipartition conditions for hst-1 before the major flare ( paper i ) .",
    "if @xmath0 losses were the controlling factor in the light curve decay , we would expect @xmath48(uv ) to be longer by the square root of the ratio of the frequencies , @xmath5614 .",
    "the actual observed @xmath48(uv ) is @xmath57 yr although the uncertainties include much longer times ( @xmath19=0 is within the 1@xmath27 error ) .",
    "of course the fact that both the uv and the radio intensities decline significantly at later times indicates that expansion of the source is probably a major contributor to the light curves behavior during some intervals .      in fig .",
    "[ fig : roxfpy ] we plot the @xmath19 values for hst-1 in different bands .",
    "although many of the uncertainties are large , and the sampling in the radio is clearly insufficient , we find that the largest ( absolute value ) believable negative @xmath19 s are 5 , 2 , and 1 for the x - ray , uv , and radio , respectively . we take this as evidence that energy loss by expansion alone , is not indicated .",
    "the obvious caveat to this conclusion is that there is a spectral break in the optical / uv in the sense that @xmath59 .",
    "if there is additionally a curving downwards of the spectrum in the @xmath60 to 10@xmath61 hz band , we could explain the @xmath19 data with just expansion .",

    "the smaller square points are for every other observation and are thus not independent of the data for adjacent observations ( larger circles ) .",
    "top to bottom : x - ray , uv , and 15 ghz .",
    "the absence of large values at large times in the top panel arises from the smaller intervals between observations : if we had calculated @xmath19 for every possible pair of observations , we would have recovered the data describing the giant flare . ]",
    "close examination of figs .  [ fig:4fpy ] and [ fig : rox2001fpy ] ( upper panel ) shows that the x - ray light curve has a series of small peaks superposed on a gradually rising intensity between 2002 and 2004 .",
    "their reality is demonstrated by the plot of the first derivative ( figs .",
    "[ fig:4fpy ] & [ fig : rox2001fpy ] ) .",
    "characteristic times of this oscillation ( peak - to - peak or trough - to - trough ) range from 0.50 years ( most common ) to a maximum value of 0.84 year . although there are some slightly discernible features on the @xmath19(uv ) plots , the data are not sufficiently numerous or robust enough to search for lags between bands .",
    "the impulses are not evident at radio frequencies and their existence is debatable for the uv although if they were as large in the uv as in the x - ray , they should have been detected .",
    "although the causes of these oscillations are not known , we speculate that a quasi periodic variation in the conversion of bulk kinetic jet power to the internal energy of the radiating plasma is more likely than a modulation of power flowing down the jet .",
    "we also disfavor a changing beaming factor caused by a changing angle to the line of sight ( e.g. a `` thrashing jet '' ) . for jet modulation , a thrashing jet , and periodic compression and expansion",
    ", we would expect any oscillation to be evident at all frequencies equally .",
    "the absence of oscillations in the uv encourages us to look for an oscillating injection of particles which , for the highest energy electrons is made manifest by the short lifetimes , but for the electrons radiating at lower frequencies , gets smoothed out by the continuously accumulating total number of radiating particles .     values for hst-1 prior to the giant flare .",

    "to date , there have been two reports of tev short - timescale flaring from m87 : 2005 apr ( hess , * ? ? ? * ) and 2008 feb ( magic , * ? ? ?",
    "while the angular resolution of the tev systems does not permit a location to be determined , the expected relation between x - ray intensity and tev intensity via an inverse compton model holds the potential of localizing the site of the tev emission if an unambiguous feature in the tev light curve can be associated with one in the x - rays .",
    "moreover , since both instances of tev flaring appeared to be characterized by timescales of only a few days , it is also possible to evaluate statistical differences in x - ray timescales , particularly for the two leading contenders , the nucleus and hst-1 .",
    "there are a few striking differences in fig .",
    "[ fig:4fpy ] between the nucleus and hst-1 . for the nucleus , there are quite large values of @xmath19 at short time scales , whereas hst-1 has an order of magnitude smaller amplitudes and these occur at somewhat longer timescales .",
    "we interpret the presence of large amplitudes at short sampling times together with smaller amplitudes at longer times to mean that we can characterize the nuclear variability as a sort of flickering. hst-1 of course provided us with a major flare with a timescale of a year or more ( figs .",
    "[ fig : roxlc],[fig:4lc ] ) .",
    "the energy emitted by the nuclear flickering is a small fraction of the energy emitted by the flaring of hst-1 , but the timescales are quite different .    4 kev / s .",
    "the top panel is a segment of the light curve of hst-1 and the middle panel shows the light curve for the nucleus with 5% of hst-1 subtracted .",
    "there are no egregious signatures of contamination .",
    "the bottom panel shows the first derivative of the nuclear lightcurve with smaller squares for intensity pairs with an intervening observation . ]    in paper  iv , we argued that the site of the tev flaring observed by hess could be hst-1 , whereas others [ e.g. @xcite , @xcite , and see also @xcite ] have suggested a location closer to the super massive black hole ( smbh ) .",
    "we pointed out that besides the coincidence of the peak of the hst-1 ( x - ray , uv , radio ) light curve occurring at the same time as the hess event in 2005 , we knew that hst-1 was physically small ( from the  observations and from the x - ray variability ) , that the emitted power at tev energies was comparable to the x - ray power ( linked , for example , by an ssc model ) , and that there were difficulties of getting tev photons out from the immediate vicinity of the smbh .",
    "while none of these considerations have changed , our current analyses on timescales could be thought of as circumstantial evidence that the nuclear x - ray emission comes from a smaller emitting volume than that of hst-1 and that this smaller emission region could be the same as that producing the tev flares , even though our upper limits on the size of the x - ray emitting region are still much larger than the light day timescales inferred for the tev region .",
    "early in 2008 feb we detected an increase in the nuclear x - ray emission to a level a bit higher than it has ever been ( figs .",
    "[ fig : cchmed3pan],[fig:4lc ] ) .",
    "this single observation was made during the tev flaring observed by magic and veritas and the corresponding values of @xmath19 were = + 11.8@xmath390.6 and = -8.0@xmath390.5 .",
    "so far in 2008 , hst-1 has been at a low level with only small changes in amplitude .",
    "unfortunately we do not have a good estimate of x - ray timescales for the 2005 hess event .",
    "although we had a series of weekly observations , the large fyp(nuclear ) values could have been contaminated by rapid changes in hst-1 , as indicated by ( hst-1 ) measurements derived from the readout streak photometry .",
    "if there is substantial tev flaring in 2009 , we may be able to settle this question via an approved target of opportunity chandra proposal which aims to find correlated x - ray / tev behavior in the respective light curves .    ]",
    "we have found a quasi - periodic impulsive signature in the brightening and dimming of hst-1 in the x - rays .",
    "while this could be interpreted as a manifestation of past modulation of jet power , we suspect that it is rather a local oscillation of the process that converts bulk kinetic jet power to the internal energy of the emitting plasma .",
    "the fact that hst-1 lies on the northern edge of the cone defined by the  jet ( paper iv ) and that the cross section of hst-1 is less than 0.1% of the jet area ( the cone of the vlba jet has a diameter of @xmath56 90 mas at the distance of hst-1 whereas the effective diameter of the unresolved upstream end of hst-1 is @xmath56 2.5 mas ) , leads us to speculate that the time varying acceleration of electrons is related to a local instability .",
    "the ratio of @xmath620.1% in areas is consistent with the ratio of power emitted by hst-1 to that believed to be the kinetic power of the jet @xcite .",
    "the finding that the decay times of the lightcurves of hst-1 progressively lengthen moving from high to low frequencies suggests that simple expansion is not the primary energy loss mechanism for the relativistic electrons .",
    "if the x - ray decay time actually reflects the synchrotron halflife of the highest energy electrons , we are not only able to estimate a value of the magnetic field which is independent of the usual equipartition assumptions , but also to provide an explanation of why the impulsive brightening is seen only at x - rays .",
    "that is because the period of the oscillations is very similar to the x - ray decay time .",
    "the uv decay time is of order 10 times longer , so that an oscillating brightening would be smoothed out by the failure of the uv radiating electrons to lose their energy before the next brightening .",
    "the similarity of the decay time to the oscillatory brightening ( both at x - ray frequencies ) may be a coincidence ( which makes the effect manifest ) , or it could be a causal component of the ( as yet to be determined ) instability mechanism .",
    "the x - ray variability timescale evidence suggests that the nucleus displays faster variability than does hst-1 .",
    "this is circumstantial evidence for the hypothesis that the site of the flaring tev emissions is the unresolved nucleus rather than hst-1 .",
    "however , the shortest nuclear variability timescale we can measure from the _ chandra _ data ( @xmath2days ) is still significantly longer than the shortest tev variability of m  87 reported by the hess and magic telescopes ( @xmath3days ) .",
    "the analogy we find useful in thinking about hst-1 is that of a river representing the underlying power flow of the jet . when something occurs to transfer some fraction of this power flow into a radiating plasma , we think of this as white water. while knot a might be compared to a waterfall , hst-1 is more like a rock in the river .",
    "thus the giant flare could have been caused by a change in local conditions ( e.g. something moving into the river ) , with the resulting bits of white water carried downstream as the observed radio blobs .",
    "we acknowledge the  director s office for approving our request to obtain a series of observations with short intervals in 2007 feb and mar .",
    "those data were of critical importance in distinguishing timescale differences between the nucleus and hst-1 .",

    "although the methods of   [ sec : xray ] recover most of the intensity of piled sources , there are on - board filters that keep events with energies @xmath63 17 kev or with certain bad grades from being telemetered to the ground .",
    "we suspect that these filters produced a significant decrease in our measurements when hst-1 was near its peak intensity , but we have not been able to verify this directly since the housekeeping files that provide the number of events dropped because of amplitude and grade appear to be dominated by cosmic ray events .",
    "when dealing with emission regions closer than an arcsec to each other , another pernicious effect of pileup comes from the detection algorithm .",
    "whenever a candidate event is found , any other event within its 3x3 pixel grid ( for faint mode ) is considered to be a part of that event .",
    "of the 2 ( or more ) , the event with the most energy wins and its position determines the reported location , and its energy is found from the sum of the charges within the 3x3 grid . hst-1 and the nucleus",
    "are separated by 0.86@xmath5 or 1.75 pixels .",
    "thus in the normal course of events , there will be occasional conflicts of this sort involving a nuclear count arriving within the same frame time as one from hst-1 .",
    "as the intensity of hst-1 rises , this will happen more often , and many times the nucleus will win because it has a harder spectrum than does hst-1 .",
    "however , when pileup gets stronger , hst-1 will win most of the time since almost all events in a frame time will consist of at least two photons , boosting the recorded charge so as to exceed the single photon from the nucleus .",
    "we are unaware of any quantitative estimates of this effect , but suspect it is not causing any serious problems for our analyses when hst-1 is @xmath62 4 kev / s .      when there is negligible pileup , the mutual overlap of the core and hst-1 psfs is @xmath56  5@xmath392% for the rectangular regions used for photometry ( fig .",
    "[ fig : regions ] ) .",
    "however , when pileup is significant , there are second order effects which seriously distort the psf .",
    "although we avoid some of these by summing energy instead of just counts , there are others which can not be accommodated : e.g. , the release of trapped charge during readout . since the most obvious of these produces a secondary response displaced a few pixels from the psf in the direction away from the readout buffer , the primary effect on adjacent jet features changes with the roll angle . given the celestial position of m87 , the roll angle is such that there are long periods of relatively constant roll angles at the beginning and end of the m87 viewing season ( nov . to aug . ) and a rather rapid change by close to 180@xmath64 centered around a date late in march .",
    "since the pa of the readout streak is similar to that of the jet at the beginning and end of the season , the primary second order effect produces contamination of jet features adjacent to hst-1 in the sense that prior to march the nucleus is badly affected whereas after the end of march it is knot d which suffers .",
    "this effect is evident in fig .",
    "[ fig:4lc ] .",
    "the fact that this sort of second order effect of pileup has not been calibrated ( nor may be susceptible to calibration ) means that changes in the measured intensity of the nucleus ( and knot d ) may not be intrinsic during the time that hst-1 was bright .",
    "for that reason , we have restricted usage of the core data to times when hst-1 was not too intense .",
    "in paper iii , we gave our measured intensities for hst-1 through 2005 .",
    "here we repeat these and also provide uncertainties and the values for the nucleus ( already with 5% of hst-1 subtracted ) , both through the current season which ended in 2008 aug . as described in paper iii",
    ", we can estimate the fudge factor , @xmath65 , in the effective area by measuring the flux from fluxmaps when pileup is not serious .",
    "however , we plan to deal with spectral properties of the various features in a future paper so prefer to publish here only our directly determined intensities .",
