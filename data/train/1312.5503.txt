    "ultra - relativistic heavy ion collisions offer the opportunity to study strongly interacting matter under extreme conditions . in nuclear collisions at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) with incident energies up to 200 gev per nucleon pair and at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at even higher energies of @xmath0 gev ,",

    "the most important observables supporting the discovery of the qgp are the high values of elliptic flow and the suppression of high @xmath2 hadrons that can be explained within theoretical approaches assuming a strongly coupled quark - gluon liquid to be formed , which exhibits strong partonic collectivity and parton energy loss @xcite .",
    "relativistic viscous hydrodynamics has proven to be a very successful tool to capture the bulk dynamics of heavy ion collisions @xcite .",
    "one of the major goals of the field is to determine precise quantitative properties of the qgp , such as transport coefficients and their temperature dependence .    for many years",
    ", most of the dynamical descriptions based on hydrodynamics used smooth and symmetric initial density profiles to simulate an `` average '' collision . in reality , there are quantum fluctuations in the earliest stages of the collision , that can come from sources as mundane as the nucleonic structure of the nucleus .",
    "this causes the energy density at early times to be lumpy and asymmetric , and to fluctuate from one collision event to the next , even for nuclei colliding at a fixed impact parameter .",
    "the importance of these fluctuations was realized at least as early as 2005 @xcite , but the full implications were not realized until later @xcite . since then , the importance of event - by - event fluctuations for understanding bulk phenomena has been extensively investigated , both experimentally and theoretically ( see ref .",

    "first , a historical introduction is given from an experimental ( section [ sec_histex ] ) and a theoretical point of view ( section [ sec_histtheo ] ) .",

    "anisotropic flow is one of the most prominent bulk observables in heavy ion collisions since the early days of the first heavy ion experiments @xcite . in peripheral collisions the overlap region in the plane transverse to the beam direction",
    "has an ellipsoidal shape .",
    "this geometric anisotropy between the `` reaction plane '' spanned by the beam direction ( @xmath3 ) and the impact parameter ( @xmath4 ) , with respect to the perpendicular ( @xmath5 ) direction can be quantified by the standard eccentricity @xcite .",
    "@xmath6    where here and in the following , curly brackets indicate an average over the energy density @xmath7 of the system at an early stage of the collision @xmath8    this initial coordinate space anisotropy is converted to a final state momentum space anisotropy , if large enough collective pressure gradients drive the evolution of the system .",
    "the anisotropy in momentum space is defined as the second fourier coefficient of the azimuthal distribution of the produced particles @xcite , @xmath9 here the average is performed over the final distribution of particles @xmath10 the original claim that the quark gluon plasma behaves like a perfect liquid is based on the agreement of the measurements of elliptic flow at rhic with the predictions of ideal hydrodynamic calculations @xcite . the elliptic flow measured for different centrality classes in au+au collisions and at different beam energies , scaled by",
    "the corresponding eccentricity exhibits a scaling as a function of the charged particle density per unit area .",
    "even though this analysis is highly model dependent since the overlap area and the eccentricity can not be observed experimentally , this scaling provided substantial evidence for the hydrodynamic picture .    in 2005 collisions of smaller nuclei cu+cu were carried out at rhic . using the standard definitions given above for the elliptic flow and the eccentricity , the ratio of @xmath11 was surprisingly much higher than previously observed in au+au collisions , and the elliptic flow did not appear to vanish as the collisions become more central .",
    "the resolution of this puzzle was that fluctuations in the initial state geometry are important , and are naturally more pronounced in smaller systems such as the cu+cu collision system and for central collisions , where the average standard eccentricity is small .",
    "further , the relevant spatial eccentricity that drives elliptic flow is not the standard eccentricity above , which is defined with respect to the impact parameter of the incoming nuclei , but an eccentricity with respect to a plane defined by the participating nucleons ( the `` participant plane '' ) , which can be rotated in a different direction .    by using a new generalized definition of the `` participant eccentricity '' given by the expression @xmath12 defined with respect to a coordinate system where @xmath13 , it became clear that the elliptic flow results in cu+cu collisions were completely consistent with the previous larger systems in a hydrodynamic picture @xcite .",
    "this was the first piece of direct evidence of initial state fluctuations , and for several years , the study of the effects of these fluctuations was confined to existing elliptic flow analyses .    the second piece of evidence is related to other details of two - particle correlation measurements",
    "actually represent the second fourier harmonic of a two - particle correlation , though this fact was not obvious when `` event plane '' analyses were first performed , and it was only understood more recently @xcite .",

    "originally , these correlations were supposed to give insights about the interactions of a high energetic parton with the surrounding medium . by losing energy a shock wave in the hydrodynamic medium",
    "is formed and the mach cone may be observable as a double - hump structure opposite in @xmath16 to the high transverse momentum particle @xcite .",
    "these measurements are affected by the soft background containing flow correlations like elliptic flow .",
    "the other striking phenomenon was the discovery of long - range correlations over many units in pseudorapity on the near - side , the ridge @xcite .",
    "two - particle cumulant ( 2pc ) and event - plane ( ep ) measurements of @xmath17@xmath18 as a function of centrality for particles in different ranges of transverse momentum at the lhc ( taken from @xcite).,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    to understand the medium background , untriggered two - particle correlations were measured . excluding the midrapidity region that is highly affected by back - to - back jet correlations and removing the first and second azimuthal fourier coefficients @xmath19 and @xmath20 revealed a striking @xmath21 structure .",
    "a further analysis by alver and roland using the ampt model demonstrates that this can be understood by introducing the so called triangular flow @xcite . in analogy to the participant eccentricity a triangularity that reflects the geometric initial state fluctuations",
    "can be defined .",
    "since 2010 , the whole series of higher fourier coefficients has been explored ( see , e.g. , fig .",
    "[ fig_vn_centrality_atlas ] ) and a similar hydrodynamic response for odd moments as for the even ones has been established that we will describe in the later sections of this review .",
    "the main feature of the odd components is that at mid - rapidity , they are only existent because of event - by - event fluctuations and have little or no geometry component , in contrast to the even moments . based on the discovery of long - range correlations in pseudorapidity in the untriggered two - particle correlations , the dynamical fluctuations of elliptic flow have been quantified as well @xcite .      in the beginning of heavy ion research the quark gluon plasma was expected to form at energy densities higher than some critical value of 110 gev/@xmath22 . since lattice qcd calculations showed only small deviations from the stefan - boltzmann limit , it was suggested to behave like an ideal gas of quarks and gluons .",
    "in contrast to this expectation , the first experimental data for elliptic flow in gold - gold collisions at rhic were in good agreement with ideal hydrodynamic calculations .",
    "since then the quark gluon plasma at temperatures up to 23 @xmath23 seems to be a rather strongly coupled liquid instead of the anticipated dilute gas of partons .",
    "the realization of the nearly perfect fluid dynamic behaviour of the qgp has triggered connections to other systems with similar properties in condensed matter physics @xcite and was the basis for exploiting the ads / cft correspondance @xcite .",
    "most of the hydrodynamic calculations have been carried out using smooth initial state distributions and making use of the symmetries of the heavy ion collision .",
    "still the idea of lumpy initial conditions or ` hot spots ' is not new and has been mentioned from early on @xcite . especially the brasilian group has been investigating the effect of initial state fluctuations on observables within the nexspherio approach since the early 2000s @xcite .",
    "bulk observables in heavy ion collisions like , e.g. , particle yields , spectra and collective flow are well described by hybrid approaches based on hydrodynamics for the hot and dense stage and hadron transport theory for the late stages where the matter is diluted and runs out of equilibrium @xcite ( and references therein ) .",
    "the initial conditions are the major unknown for the hydrodynamic evolution .",
    "a first principle treatment of non - equilibrium qcd to calculate the initial stage of the collision of two nuclei is the ultimate goal which is not yet achieved .",
    "the pragmatic approach is therefore to employ the well - constrained dynamical evolution in a hybrid approach and constrain the needed structures in the initial state profile from experimental data .",
    "apart from complex numerical modeling to achieve a realistic description of the dynamics of heavy ion collisions , the motivation to study initial state fluctuations is based on an intriguing analogy to the cosmic microwave background measurements . in cosmology",
    ", there is only one event , the evolution of the universe , but from the detailed measurement of thousands of multipole components of the temperature fluctuations present today , one is able to deduct detailed knowledge about the matter content in the universe . in heavy ion collisions the time and length scales of the system impose a restriction on the number of measurable multipole components , but in principle there is an almost unlimited number of events to be analyzed @xcite . to be able to extract transport properties of the quark",
    "gluon plasma like the shear viscosity over entropy ratio on a quantitative level a better understanding of the initial conditions and the importance of fluctuations is needed .",
    "the above described experimental development triggered very high interest of the whole heavy ion community in initial state fluctuations and resulting final state correlations and the most recent developments are the content of this review article .",
    "in each collision event , experiments detect a large number of particles ( up to several thousand ) of various types exiting the collision region . the task is to analyze their properties and devise observables that can give insight into the dynamics of the collision , and properties of the medium that is created .",
    "we begin by defining these observables , and how they relate to underlying theoretical concepts .",
    "see @xcite for an earlier review .    in theory , one can describe the particles finally emitted from a collision with an underlying probability distribution .",
    "the particles that are detected represent a finite sample of this distribution .",
    "the azimuthal dependence is of great interest , and can be written as a fourier series in azimuthal angle @xmath16 : @xmath24,\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is the transverse momentum of an emitted particle .",
    "the pseudorapidity @xmath25/2 $ ] is a convenient variable to use for the remaining momentum degree of freedom .",
    "the coefficients @xmath26 represent azimuthal anisotropy in the distribution , and the orientation angles @xmath27 are defined such that all sine terms vanish .",
    "explicitly , the entire flow vector can be written as a number in the complex plane , @xmath28 for a general distribution , therefore , both @xmath29 and @xmath30 can depend on transverse and longitudinal momentum .",
    "one can also define an average flow vector with magnitude @xmath31 and direction @xmath32 by generalizing the integrals to include an integral over a range of transverse momentum and ( pseudo-)rapidity @xmath33    if the collision is symmetric in the transverse plane , all angles @xmath30 are equal to the direction of the impact parameter and all odd harmonics vanish . in the past",
    "this was often assumed to be a good approximation for the distribution at mid - rapidity in a collision between identical ions .",
    "however , event - by - event fluctuations in the early stages of the collision will break this symmetry in the final particle distribution , and are now known to be important .",
    "further , these fluctuations ensure that there is a different underlying distribution for every collision event ( even for events at the same centrality ) and every particle species .",
    "a reconstruction of an anisotropy coefficient @xmath29 from @xmath34 samples of the distribution has a statistical uncertainty @xmath35 .",
    "typically these anisotropies have a value of a few percent , while the number of particles detected in a single event is at most a few thousand , resulting in a typical relative uncertainty of 50% or more in any single - event measurement ( even with the large multiplicities and detector coverage at the lhc ) .",
    "therefore , one must look at correlations that can be averaged over an ensemble of events , usually selected according to a centrality criterion  @xcite , to determine moments of the event - by - event distribution of @xmath29 and @xmath30 .    in general , particles are not emitted independently , and can be correlated with other particles .",
    "for example , the underlying distribution of pairs can be written as @xmath36 there is a contribution from a product of one - particle distributions , and in addition there can be an intrinsic correlation between a pair of particles @xmath37 , defined as the remainder .",
    "the first term only depends on the single - particle probability and represents a correlation of each particle with the global event .",
    "such contributions represent collective behavior of the system and can be labelled `` flow '' , while the second term represents contributions from intrinsic correlations between particles",
    ". these can be termed `` non - flow '' correlations , since they are absent in purely hydrodynamic calculations ( i.e. , when particles are emitted independently from a thermal fluid , neglecting resonance decays , bose - einstein correlations , jet correlations , etc ) .",
    "many experimental analyses are designed in the hopes of removing or minimizing non - flow correlations , in order to directly measure properties of the underlying one - particle distribution , but in principle they can be present in any measurement .    the orientation of each collision is random , so only rotationally invariant quantities can be measured .",
    "the simplest example is the average yield of a particular particle .",
    "however , to get any information about azimuthal dependence , one must look at correlations between more than one particle . the simplest of these is the pair distribution , whose azimuthal dependence can only be measured as a function of the relative angle between the pair @xmath38 .",
    "the dependence on @xmath38 can be captured by the set of fourier coefficients , with each coefficient depending on the transverse and longitudinal momentum ( or equivalently pseudorapidity @xmath39 ) of each of the particles @xmath40 where the inner brackets represent an average over pairs of particles detected in a collision event and ( @xmath41 ) represent a particular bin in transverse momentum and pseudorapidity to which each particle is restricted , respectively , and over which the underlying probability distribution is integrated to define , e.g. , @xmath42 and @xmath43 .    in this manuscript",
    ", unadorned angular brackets always indicate an average over events @xmath44 .",
    "the notation @xmath45 refers to the appropriate angular projection of the non - flow correlation @xmath37 , @xmath46 where the integrals go over the appropriate phase space of the chosen bins ( @xmath47,@xmath48 ) .",
    "the second line shows how the measured observable is related to the underlying probability distribution   and non - flow correlations , using eq .   and assuming each term in eq .",
    "is small . by calculating eq .   in a given theoretical model",
    ", one can directly compare to the measurement , eq .  .",
    "i.e. , as long as one can calculate the underlying single - particle and pair distributions , eqs .",
    "( [ vn ] , [ pair ] ) , there is no need to simulate details of a detector response and an experimental analysis , or even generate discrete particles .",
    "the remaining 4 dimensions of the 5-dimensional phase space of pair correlations ( @xmath38 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 ) , plus correlations between different particle species , can be investigated in various ways .",
    "one of the most common is the two - particle cumulant flow measurement @xmath53 , which restricts only one particle of the pair to a narrow region in transverse momentum and/or pseudorapidity ( and often a particular identified particle species ) , while the second particle in each pair is an unidentified hadron that is allowed to be taken from a wide range in phase space .",
    "this correlation is then divided by the square root of a fully integrated correlation to obtain  @xcite @xmath54 equation   shows the general sensitivity to the underlying probability distribution , with the integrated flow @xmath55 and @xmath56 defined as in eq .  , but integrated over @xmath2 and @xmath39 .",
    "the fully momentum - integrated measurement reduces to @xmath57 .",
    "this is the correct quantity to calculate in a theoretical model , while eq .",
    "is the result if one makes the following approximations : non - flow correlations are negligible ( @xmath58 ) , the event plane depends little on transverse momentum and pseudorapidity ( @xmath59 ) , and event - by - event fluctuations are such that @xmath60 is approximately constant ( e.g. , if @xmath29 at all momenta scale only with an eccentricity @xmath61 ) .",
    "none of these assumptions are expected to be exactly true , but can be reasonable approximations depending on the situation and desired accuracy .",
    "lastly , one can assume no event - by - event fluctuations are present , in which case @xmath62 , but this typically introduces at least a @xmath63% error in any model with realistic fluctuations .",
    "measured as a function of centrality percentile , from  @xcite .",
    "each measurement has a different sensitivity to event - by - event flow fluctuations and to non - flow correlations [ see , e.g. , eqs .",
    "( [ vn2theory ] ,  [ 4ptheory ] ) ] .",
    "typically , the difference between @xmath64 measurements with and without an enforced gap in pseudorapidity is interpreted as a contribution from short - range non - flow correlations , while the difference between @xmath64 and higher particle cumulants , and the equality of higher particle cumulants , can be explained by flow fluctuations.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    often the unidentified particles in the second set are given non - equal weights in the average  one can , e.g. , give each particle a weight proportional to its transverse momentum . in this case , eq .",
    "is the same , except with @xmath31 and @xmath65 now derived from a weighted average distribution .",
    "another common case is when one correlates with the energy deposited in a calorimeter instead of individual particles .",
    "this is the same as giving particles a weight proportional to their energy .",
    "note that occasionally , this same notation for a two - particle cumulant is used when both particles in the pair are chosen from a particular momentum bin ( see , e.g. , fig .",
    "[ fig_vn_centrality_atlas ] ) , in which case eq .",
    "is an exact result .",
    "in addition , while in this manuscript we denote all momentum - integrated quantities with a bar ( e.g. , @xmath66 ) , a distinction in notation is not always made ( see , e.g. , fig .  [ fig_cumulants ] , which represents an integrated measurement ) .",
    "finally , depending on the details of how the analysis is done , it is also often referred to as a scalar product , and the observable labelled @xmath67  @xcite , but it is equivalent to a two - particle correlation .",
    "many known sources of non - flow correlations are suppressed when the relative longitudinal momentum of the pair is large , and so one of the most common methods to isolate the effect of the underlying anisotropies @xmath29 is to only consider pairs with a large relative pseudorapidity  @xcite , in the hopes that any non - flow correlation @xmath37 is then negligible . in fig .",
    "[ fig_cumulants ] , one can see the effect of enforcing a gap in pseudorapidity between particle pairs on a measurement of @xmath68 .",
    "the difference between measurements with and without a rapidity gap is believed to be mostly due to non - flow correlations , which become increasingly important as one moves to the right in the plot toward more peripheral collisions .",
    "a larger space of information opens up with correlations between more than two particles .",
    "in general , one can measure any @xmath69particle correlation of the form  @xcite @xmath70 with @xmath71 ( the angular structure is again restricted because one can only measure rotationally - invariant quantities ) .",
    "the labels @xmath72 again represent bins in phase space and/or particle species .    in the absence of non - flow correlations",
    ", the observable relates to the underlying single - particle distributions by eq .  .",
    "however , in general the underlying @xmath73-particle distribution can again depend on both flow and non - flow contributions .",
    "e.g. , @xmath74 etc .",
    "so the correlations   depend on potentially complicated combinations of flow and non - flow . on",
    "can again suppress the non - flow correlations with strategically - placed gaps in pseudorapidity between two or more of the particles in the muliplet  @xcite .",
    "however , one can also suppress non - flow correlations by considering particular combinations of correlations .",
    "most common are @xmath73-particle cumulants , which are designed to suppress non - flow correlations of order less than @xmath73  @xcite .",
    "for example , a momentum - integrated four - particle cumulant is : @xmath75 where eq .",
    "is obtained from eqs .   and and represents the general dependence on the underlying probability distribution .",
    "equation is the result when there are only flow correlations .",
    "when event - by - event fluctuations of the flow vector are small or are distributed as a 2d gaussian  @xcite , this is the average flow vector projected onto the direction of the impact parameter ( the `` reaction plane '' ) , @xmath76 . for non - central collisions , therefore , it can be large ( though in principle eq",
    ".   can be negative , even in the absence of non - flow ) .",
    "equation is the result when there are only non - flow correlations .",
    "this quantity is typically expected to be small , and so cumulants can be a powerful test of the nature of azimuthal correlations .",
    "when non - flow and flow are both present , there can be a contribution from three - particle non - flow correlations and an additional angular component of a two - particle correlation , coupled to flow , @xmath77 in addition to the term ( @xmath78 ) .    it should be noted , therefore , that in most cases , non - flow correlations are not completely removed by constructing cumulants , even though they are typically suppressed .",
    "similarly , higher - order cumulants @xmath79 have been measured , in addition to @xmath2-differential measurements @xcite .",
    "e.g. , for reference , a differential fourth cumulant is @xmath80 where only one of the particles in each quadruplet of the second term of eq .",
    "is restricted to be an identified or unidentified particle in the desired phase space bin . in the absence of non - flow , this measures eq .  , where @xmath26 and @xmath81 are the underlying differential flow coefficient and event plane of the particle of interest , while @xmath31 and @xmath32 are again the momentum - integrated flow and event plane of unidentified charged hadrons .",
    "note that , although different cumulants have different sensitivity to non - flow , when there are event - by - event fluctuations in @xmath29 , they also measure different moments of the event - by - event distribution , and so one can not isolate non - flow correlations by simply comparing , e.g. , @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "in fact , when there are fluctuations , there is no rigorous way to separate flow and non - flow ( as was hoped to be the case for cumulants when fluctuations were thought to be negligible ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if non - flow is negligible or can be controlled in other ways , these cumulants each give an independent handle on the nature of flow and event - by - event flow fluctuations .",
    "for example , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig_cumulants ] , measured cumulants @xmath84 of order @xmath85 are all equal to each other within the reported error bars  @xcite .",
    "this is exactly what is expected if non - flow is negligible and if flow fluctuations are gaussian  @xcite  i.e. , if the vector defined by @xmath29 and @xmath30 fluctuates event - by - event according to a two - dimensional gaussian within a given centrality class .",
    "the relationship between @xmath64 and @xmath86 then indicates the magnitude of the fluctuations , which are directly related to properties of the initial stage of the collision  @xcite .",
    "a number of other @xmath69particle correlations have now been measured , with many more to come @xcite , giving a large number of independent constraints on theory . especially notable",
    "are various mixed harmonic correlations , which contain information about flow angles @xmath30  @xcite .",
    "the finite multiplicity in each event limits the number of particles @xmath73 in eq .  , as well as the harmonics @xmath87 , leaving a finite ( though large ) number of possible observables . in principle",
    ", all information about correlations between particles is contained in the complete set of measurements of this form ( suitably generalized to include momentum - dependent particle weights and multiplicity - dependent event weights ) .",
    "however , it is often useful to cast this information in different forms .    as an example",
    ", if one considers momentum - integrated correlations of the form and assumes non - flow correlations are negligible , one can directly measure all even moments of the event - by - event distribution of a flow coefficient , @xmath88 . a quantity such as @xmath89 or a plot of the entire flow - angle - averaged distribution , however , can only be obtained indirectly .    in principle , it can be reconstructed from this full set of ( even ) moments . alternatively , it can be obtained by an unfolding analysis , as follows .",
    "first one defines an observed single - event anisotropy @xmath90 , and plots its event - by - event distribution . in the absence of non - flow correlations",
    ", this distribution represents the true distribution of @xmath31 folded with a statistical smearing due to the finite number of detected particles .",
    "if the form of the statistical fluctuations is known , the true distribution can be obtained by an unfolding procedure .",
    "this can be done by assuming a particular form for the response function ( from , e.g. , a monte carlo calculation )  @xcite or by extracting it from other data , such as the correlation between the observed anisotropy at forward and backward rapidities  @xcite , since the difference is expected to be mostly due to statistical fluctuations rather than the ( weak ) rapidity dependence of the underlying distribution @xmath91 .",
    "after the unfolding , one has an entire event - by - event distribution of @xmath31 @xcite , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_unfolded ] .",
    "interestingly , although the directly - measured cumulants of the distribution appear to be consistent with gaussian fluctuations as mentioned above , the unfolded distribution of @xmath17 shows a deviation at peripheral centralities  @xcite .",
    "it is not yet known whether this information was actually contained in the previously - measured cumulants ( errors are correlated , so higher cumulants may not actually be consistent with each other despite overlapping error bars ) , or if there is a systematic difference in the two analyses",

    "particles of interest are then correlated with this azimuthal angle . in the simplest case of two subevents ,",
    "the final observable is :    @xmath100 { } v_n\\{2\\},\\\\ \\label{highres } & \\xrightarrow[\\text{high res . } ] { } \\langle v_n \\rangle,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where the average in the numerator is over all particles of interest in a class of events , and the average in the denominator is the usual average over events . unlike the above observables , there is no general formula for what this observable measures in terms of the underlying flow distribution and non - flow correlations .",
    "it depends on what is called the event - plane resolution .",
    "in the low resolution limit , as the number of particles @xmath34 used to estimate the event plane goes to one , it coincides exactly with a two - particle correlation ( including the same non - flow contribution ) , as indicated in eq .  .",
    "as the resolution increases , the measurement begins to have a contribution from correlations between more than two particles , and in the high resolution limit , when the square root of the number of particles is much larger than the inverse of the anisotropy , @xmath101 , one measures the mean anisotropy ,  @xcite .",
    "this limit typically differs from the low - resolution limit by @xmath110% or more .    in most cases",
    ", the resolution is low enough that the result is essentially a two - particle cumulant .",
    "however , in some cases the resolution is high enough to impart a non - negligible deviation from the low - resolution result ( roughly when the reported resolution parameter  the square of the denominator in eq .",
    " @xmath102 0.80.9 ) .",
    "see , e.g. , fig .",
    "[ fig_vn_centrality_atlas ] .",
    "the high multiplicity of high - energy collisions at the lhc combined with the large acceptance of the atlas detector allows the resolution for @xmath17 to exceed 0.9 in mid - peripheral collisions , resulting in a small difference between the event - plane result and the two - particle cumulant ( note the log scale ) .",

    "fluid dynamics is closely connected to the idea of local thermal equilibrium .",
    "if a system is in thermal equilibrium , its macroscopically - averaged energy and momentum are distributed isotropically it its rest frame . in this frame , there is no net momentum , and so its energy - momentum tensor has the form @xmath110 the only two remaining degrees of freedom can be identified as the energy density @xmath7 and pressure @xmath111 .",
    "_ local _ thermal equilibrium is a generalization of thermal equilibrium , when the rest frame and thermodynamic properties of a system are allowed to vary in space and time , though slowly enough that every local region of the system can be said to be arbitrarily close to thermal equilibrium . in a general lab frame related to the local rest frame by a four - velocity @xmath112 , eq .   becomes @xmath113 where @xmath112 , @xmath7 , and @xmath111 are now functions of spacetime , and we have chosen a mostly negative minkowski metric @xmath114 .",
    "the equations of ideal relativistic hydrodynamics are obtained by demanding local conservation of energy and momentum @xmath115 any other conserved quantity is governed by its own conservation equation @xmath116 which also has a simple form when a system is in local thermal equilibrium @xmath117 where @xmath118 , is the conserved charge density in the local rest frame .",
    "these equations describe universal behavior of any system with sufficient separation of scales between macroscopic scales and the microscopic dynamics that bring the system toward equilibrium .",
    "the only connection to the particular physical system is the relationship between @xmath7 , @xmath111 , and @xmath118 , which for a system in local thermal equilibrium is the equation of state @xmath119 .",
    "this relation closes the above set of equations , and the evolution of the system is completely determined .",
    "this framework can be generalized to systems with a small departure from local equilibrium , which exhibit dissipative effects . in this case , the ideal stress - energy tensor and conserved current include a small additive correction @xmath120 in general the independent terms in these corrections each contain an associated transport coefficient , such as shear viscosity @xmath39 , bulk viscosity @xmath121 , or charge diffusion coefficients @xmath122 : @xmath123 here we use convenient notation for a projector orthogonal to the four velocity @xmath124 , which can be used to define a spatial gradient in the local rest frame @xmath125 , and the brackets indicate a symmetrized , traceless tensor @xmath126 .",
    "so eq .   contains the two possible independent terms containing a single derivative of the ideal hydrodynamic quantities in eq .  , which is usually separated as the traceless ( shear ) and scalar ( bulk ) part .",
    "each conserved current has an associated thermodynamic chemical potential @xmath127 , related to the charged density @xmath118 and temperature @xmath128 by a thermodynamic relation , and all of these coefficients can depend on , e.g. , the local energy and charge densities .",
    "it turns out that these first - order equations are unstable , so to perform numerical calculations one typically uses a second order formulation , represented by ellipses in eqs .   and , of which slightly different variants exist  @xcite .",
    "the extra terms typically involve time derivatives that transform the equations into relaxation equations that are then stable and solvable with numerical algorithms",
    ". these equations also contain additional second - order transport coefficients .",
    "typically their effect is not large  @xcite ( but also not negligible  @xcite ) .",
    "more recently , there has been a development of `` anisotropic hydrodynamics '' , formulated around an anisotropic momentum distribution , which may be a better description of a collision system , in particular at its earliest stages when the system may be far from an isotropic energy - momentum distribution @xcite .",
    "in addition , a thermal system contains intrinsic fluctuations , which can contribute to the event - by - event fluctuations generated from the initial conditions  @xcite .",
    "like the equation of state , the transport coefficients are determined by the underlying dynamics of the medium in question ( e.g. , a high - temperature quark - gluon plasma ) .",
    "the rule of thumb is that stronger interactions result in smaller transport coefficients ( e.g. , viscosity ) .",
    "the formalism is then valid if the length or time scale set by these transport coefficients is much smaller than the macroscopic length or time scale set by the associated gradients .",
    "hence , these transport coefficients are of significant interest in a heavy - ion collision , to learn about the dynamics of qcd matter near the deconfinement phase transition , and the success of hydrodynamic descriptions has lead to the standard picture of a strongly - coupled , low - viscosity quark - gluon plasma having been created .",
    "the equation of state at zero net baryochemical potential and finite temperature can be reliably calculated using lattice qcd methods  @xcite .",
    "however , transport coefficients are much more difficult to calculate .",
    "typically , they are treated as free parameters in calculations , and experimental data can then provide constraints .",
    "so a system in a hydrodynamic regime has universal behavior , with only a few parameters that represent the physics of the particular system [ @xmath119 , @xmath129 , @xmath130 , @xmath131 .",
    "however , these equations require an initial condition  the values of the hydrodynamic variables ( @xmath7 , @xmath112 , @xmath132 , @xmath118 , @xmath133 ) after the system has sufficiently thermalized at the beginning of the collision .",
    "the hydrodynamic equations then describe how the system evolves forward in time . likewise , the end result of a collision is a set of particles that hit the detectors , whose distribution , eq .",
    ", we would like to calculate . at some point ,",
    "then , one must switch from a fluid description to a description of the system in terms of particles .",
    "we discuss these stages of the collision in the following sections .",
    "at later stages in the heavy ion reaction , a fluid description will eventually break down .",
    "however , if there is some region where a fluid and a kinetic description are both valid , we can calculate the local distribution of particles @xmath134 in the kinetic theory that corresponds to the values of the hydrodynamic variables in the fluid description .",
    "this distribution can then be modified by further collisions and decays , with the evolution described using the same transport theory , to obtain the final momentum space distribution  . the basic idea to match fluid dynamical calculations to hadron transport models",
    "has been developed around the year 2000 @xcite .    since then ,",
    "so called hybrid approaches that combine the advantages of hydrodynamics and kinetic transport have become the primary choice for developing dynamical models that are able to capture the whole evolution from initial to the final stages of the heavy ion collisions @xcite .",
    "a recent review article about hybrid approaches can be found here @xcite .",
    "the typical effects of the final state hadronic rescatterings are :    * an increase of the mean transverse momentum / radial flow by up to 30% ( for protons ) , * the mass splitting effect for anisotropic flow is more pronounced , * the separation of chemical and kinetic freeze - out is dynamically taken into account .    in general , the switching procedure between hydrodynamics and hadron transport should happen in a regime where both descriptions are equally applicable and yield similar results for the bulk evolution . in practice , it is important to ensure that the degrees of freedom do not change during the change of theoretical description .",
    "hadronization is taken care of by a change of the equation of state during the hydrodynamic evolution .",
    "then , some switching criterion has to be defined : in most cases , a constant temperature on the order of 150 - 170 mev is chosen , but an energy density criterion or an isochronous transition might also be good approximations .    in practice ,",
    "the hydrodynamic evolution is performed completely , and afterward a hypersurface finder is employed to extract a smooth transition surface from hydrodynamics to the transport description .",
    "the finding of the hypersurface is rather straight forward in lower dimensions and for smooth initial conditions , but becomes more complex for 3 + 1 dynamical calculations including event - by - event fluctuations .",
    "it is important to employ an algorithm that avoids double - counting and does not leave holes in the surface .",
    "one example for a sophisticated implementation is cornelius , that is publicly available on the oscar code archive ( _ https://karman.physics.purdue.edu/oscar _ ) as a fortran90 and c++ routine @xcite .    on this hypersurface",
    ", the distribution of particles is given by the cooper - frye formula that describes the flux of particles through the surface @xcite @xmath135 where @xmath134 is the grand - canonical boosted particle distribution function in each hypersurface element , with normal @xmath136 , and the total momentum distribution is an integral over the entire surface @xmath137 .",
    "here , @xmath138 is the degeneracy of the particle in question .    in any equilibrium system with a kinetic theory description ,",
    "the distribution function is a fermi - dirac or bose - einstein distribution for a particular species of fermion or boson , respectively , corresponding to the temperature @xmath128 and chemical potential @xmath139 , @xmath140 where @xmath112 is the fluid four - velocity .    in the limit of ideal hydrodynamics , then , this process of switching from a fluid to a particle description is well understood .",
    "however , a system with a small departure from equilibrium  i.e. , a system described by viscous hydrodynamics  differs from the equilibrium distribution : @xmath141 .",
    "the viscous correction @xmath142 is not universal , and depends on the particle interactions in a particular system . in principle",
    "it could even depend on the history of the evolution , rather than only the value of local hydrodynamic variables .",
    "what is used most often in practice for the case of shear viscosity is the `` quadratic '' and `` democratic '' ansatz , referring to the assumption for the momentum dependence and that the form is the same for every particle species : @xmath143 however , there is no reason to believe it is correct for a hadronic system at the later stages of a heavy - ion collision , and it is a current topic of research what is the correct form of @xmath142 .",
    "typically , altering the form of the viscous correction gives a small change to momentum - integrated quantities , but can have a significant effect on differential measurements .",
    "the cooper - frye formula can in principle have both positive and negative contributions , representing particles being emitted from the fluid , and flowing into the fluid , respectively .",
    "however , in a typical simulation of a heavy - ion collision , the expansion is so fast , that the negative contributions are on the order of 5% or even smaller and can be neglected .    the resulting distribution function",
    "can then be evolved with the boltzmann equation , which is valid in principle for the remainder of the system lifetime . the most common way to do",
    "this is to sample a finite number of particles from the local distribution function on the cooper - frye surface , and evolve them forward in time with a cascade algorithm .",
    "this method has the advantage of allowing for the addition of ( non - flow ) correlations , which are not present in a purely fluid description , in a straightforward way .    for the sampling procedure itself ,",
    "there are many different algorithms developed by different groups @xcite ( and references therein )",
    ". it would be desirable to standardize the procedure , clarify the crucial steps and create an efficient routine that is available as open source code .",

    ", this implies a correlation between the particles .",
    "one of the open questions is what effect various conservation laws have on correlation observables , and what is the most realistic way of implementing them in the sampling process . in @xcite the effect of global conservation of quantum numbers in each event has been demonstrated .",
    "the fluctuations of the energy , net baryon number , electric charge and net strangeness can be very large , if their conservation is not enforced in the sampling procedure",
    ". those fluctuations will have a non - negligible effect on correlation observables even though it is important to emphasize that ensuring global conservation laws of quantum numbers does not include any local conservation laws for the same quantum numbers or for momentum .",
    "these local conservation laws are even more crucial for the detailed investigation of correlation observables as shown in the next example .    the krakow group @xcite has investigated the effect of local charge conservation on correlation observables .",
    "this implementation reproduces the measured charge balance functions and results in a significant dependence of pair correlations on relative pseudorapidity , as well as explaining the difference in correlations for same charge versus opposite charge pairs .",

    ", it makes only sense to apply such conservation laws in the sampling procedure if the associated currents are also locally conserved in the hydrodynamic evolution .",
    "if net baryon number current conservation is implemented in the hydrodynamic algorithm , this requires only the addition of one more additional differential equation for each conserved current like isospin or net strangeness in the framework .",
    "the physics of the initial stages of a heavy - ion collision is currently one of the biggest open questions , and is one of the largest contributions of uncertainty for many observables .",

    "much progress has been made in identifying the physical processes that contribute to the shape of the initial state profile and the amount of fluctuations . for heavy - ions ,",
    "the most important source of azimuthal fluctuations is the nucleonic structure of the incoming nuclei  at the moment of impact , each nucleon acquires a definite transverse position in the nucleus  followed by local fluctuations in energy deposition / entropy production .",
    "however , many other aspects can have a non - negligible effect , such as local sub - nucleonic structure and correlations between nucleons in the nucleus , especially in smaller systems .    to specify initial conditions for a hydrodynamic evolution",
    "the energy momentum tensor is needed as a function of coordinate space at a certain time @xmath144 or @xmath145 . in terms of hydrodynamic variables",
    ", this translates to an energy density , flow velocity , and values for the viscous tensor .",
    "some of the more commonly used assumptions for these initial conditions include :    * longitudinal profile : boost - invariance or gaussian parametrization as a function of spatial rapidity * transverse profile : glauber model or color glass inspired approaches * total energy / entropy : chosen to reproduce final particle multiplicity at one centrality * initial velocity distributions : bjorken scaling in longitudinal direction and zero initial flow in the transverse direction * fluctuations : monte carlo versions of above mentioned models , flux tube / hot spot toy models    it is common to characterize initial transverse density profiles with generalizations of the participant eccentricity , with strength @xmath61 and orientation @xmath146 that can be compactly written as the magnitude and phase of a complex number : @xmath147 where @xmath148 and @xmath16 are the polar coordinates in the transverse plane and the curly brackets are again an average over the initial transverse density , eq .  . for @xmath149=2",

    "we will see in section  [ sec_results ] that this choice has a natural interpretation as the lowest momentum mode of a fourier transform of the initial transverse density ; although this set of eccentricity parameters lacks information about small - scale structures , they contain most of the information relevant to the hydrodynamic response .",
    "systematic studies of using either the energy density or the entropy density for the weighted average have demonstrated that this distinction does not make a difference to the results @xcite .",
    "still , it is important to verify that the same definition for initial state eccentricity is used when comparing results from different theoretical calculations . it would be very helpful to define a standard for the characterization of initial state profiles and their features that allows for an apples - to - apples comparison . in @xcite new methods based on a two dimensional fourier expansion in polar coordinate space",

    "once the number of particles has been determined , momenta are sampled according to a power law distribution .",
    "this approach can then be used to include initial non - equilibrium evolution at least on a qualitative level , since the whole phase - space distribution of the initially produced particles is known from the extended glauber monte carlo .",
    "it is shown that the change in the eccentricities resulting from initial free - streaming is similar in magnitude to the decrease attributed to larger smearing factors in the conversion from particles to initial energy density distributions .",
    "overall , the monte carlo glauber approach is suitable to generate initial conditions for a hydrodynamic expansion .",
    "it delivers a realistic overlap profile as a function of impact parameter and in its monte carlo version , the observed fluctuations are matched rather well .",
    "still , it is important to specify which incarnation of glauber model implementation has been used in the calculation , when such an approach is used to describe the initial state of a heavy ion collision .      the other common class of initial conditions is based on the gluon saturation picture .",
    "examples are models based on kt factorization such as the monte carlo kln model @xcite and mcrcbk model incorporating unintegrated gluon densities from the running - coupling bk equation and negative binomial fluctuations , or the ip - glasma model including dynamical evolution of su(3 ) classical yang - mills equations for the gluon fields @xcite . in the high energy limit , the parton distribution function of the nucleons are dominated by gluons .",
    "the gluon contribution raises rapidly towards smaller x values and exceeds the one of valence and sea quarks by more than an order of magnitude .",
    "therefore , the intuitive picture is that the gluons within the nuclei start to overlap and build a coherent condensate state . for high occupation numbers the bose distribution coincides with the boltzmann distribution and a description of the gluon dynamics in terms of classical fields can be applied .",
    "the initial state dynamics based on saturation ideas are summarized in a recent review article @xcite .    on the level of smooth initial conditions",
    ", the kln model leads to sharper edges and therefore higher eccentricities which require a higher shear viscosity during the hydrodynamic evolution to reproduce the same elliptic flow values as glauber initial conditions @xcite . an obvious difference between glauber monte carlo and cgc based monte carlo approaches are the degrees of freedom . concerning fluctuations that implies that there are structures on much smaller scales in gluon based approaches compared to hadron based approaches .",
    "the hope is that by incorporating fluctuations and looking at higher harmonics in the flow anisotropies , there are more constraints to understand the initial state .    in the standard mc - kln @xcite",

    "the motivation to collide uranium nuclei is based on the fact , that it is known from nuclear structure calculations that uranium has a prolate shape like a cigar . therefore , there are a lot of interesting possibilities : if the two nuclei collide head - on with their round sides , there is going to be high multiplicity and very small elliptic flow , but if they collide with their elongated edges , a highly anisotropic initial state is generated and large elliptic flow and a very high multiplicity is expected .",
    "in addition , there is no magnetic field present , since there is only a small number of spectators .",
    "therefore , these special events provide the opportunity to cross - check the predictions for the chiral magnetic effect that are ambiguous in au+au calculations where alternative explanations based on elliptic flow and balance functions are also able to explain the charge correlation measurements .    collisions of asymmetric systems are also of interest , since one would expect finite odd flow components due to the initial geometry of e.g. an cu+au collision .",
    "again data has been recently taken at rhic and it will be exciting to see the results for triangular flow measurements that are not solely generated by fluctuations .",
    "last but not least , it is of high interest to look at bulk observables in elementary collisions .",
    "if the assumption is that anisotropic flow is a clear signal for hydrodynamic behaviour and the formation of a quark gluon plasma , one would expect these collective effects to be reduced as the system becomes smaller .",
    "measurements have now been performed for p - p , p - pb and d - au collisions . at the lhc ,",
    "the collision energies are so high that in some elementary collisions , the multiplicity can be as high as in peripheral pb+pb collisions . within the last year",
    ", the lhc experiments have performed correlation measurements and as in the example shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_cmscorrelation ] by the cms collaboration correlations the two - particle correlations show surprisingly similar correlation structures in peripheral heavy ion and elementary p - pb collisions . at the moment , there are two main explanations , either the correlations are generated directly in the initial state , e.g. , by early gluon dynamics in a saturation picture @xcite , or the correlations are generated by collective expansion , e.g. , hydrodynamics @xcite . since p - pb and p - p collisions are used as a reference for many hard observables it is important to understand them in more detail .",
    "to summarize there is a lot of experimental and theoretical effort ongoing in the heavy ion community to understand and determine initial state features by looking at final state correlations .",
    "we introduced the flow correlation observables that are investigated , and described the state of the art for dynamical modeling of heavy ion reactions in terms of viscous hydrodynamics coupled to hadron transport .",
    "the current plethora of initial state models has been presented in detail . since there is no full first principle qcd calculation for the early time dynamics yet , the way to progress is to apply a well - constrained bulk evolution model to constrain features of the initial state profiles .",
    "these features are connected to properties of the hot and dense state of strongly interacting matter that is initially formed in heavy ion reactions .",
    "the generic hydrodynamic response to initial state structures can be summarized as follows : for @xmath181 the assumption of a linear response between @xmath61 and @xmath29 is justified , while for higher moments non - linear contributions are important .",
    "overall , the full set of experimental multi - particle observables needs to be exploited to derive quantitative values for transport coefficients of the quark gluon plasma and to constrain the initial dynamics .",
    "there are many open issues that are important to consider on the road towards precision studies of the properties of hot and dense strongly interacting matter .",
    "the longitudinal fluctuations , initial velocity profiles , initial shear tensor components and the effect of hadronic rescattering on higher flow coefficients are beyond the ones that will be studied in the near future",
    ". here , also the study of different system sizes and beam energies will provide important input .",
    "open issues that require more fundamental development are the combination of hard processes and jet - medium interactions with the bulk medium in a fully consistent way including the backreactions and to disentangle initial state fluctuations from the fluctuation probes that signal a first order phase transition of a critical endpoint . for both of these a whole new generation of dynamical transport approaches needs to be developed , before",
    "quantitative conclusions can be drawn .",
