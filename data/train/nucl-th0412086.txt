    "@xmath1be is known to be a strongly clustered nucleus that appears through relatively short - lived resonances just above the @xmath0 scattering threshold .",
    "a low - lying rotational band is experimentally apparent and suggests a strong deformation of the 8-particle resonance system .",
    "a systematic survey of the full spectrum of @xmath1be , including a review of available theoretical and experimental results , has been made in the work of ajzenberg - selove @xcite and is now available  in a revised version @xcite .",
    "bacher et al .",
    "@xcite have reported partial phase shifts in the @xmath0 collisions for even states up to @xmath2 in the range up to 35 mev excitation energy .",
    "together with @xcite , these experiments reveal no resonance states with measurable widths above 25 up to 50 mev in the elastic @xmath0 channel .",
    "arena et al .",
    "@xcite point out the need of including inelastic channels such as @xmath3he(@xmath3he , d)@xmath4li , @xmath5he(@xmath3he , n)@xmath6be , and @xmath7he(@xmath3he , p)@xmath6li if one wants to find states of high excitation energy .",
    "these authors report the possible existence of highly excited  @xmath1be levels for @xmath2  and @xmath8 at about 41 mev and @xmath9 , and around 50 mev for @xmath10 up to @xmath11 .    because of the strong experimental evidence for predominance of cluster structure in @xmath1be , many theoretical approaches based on cluster structures have been considered .",
    "microscopic cluster models are known to provide valuable information about the structure of light nuclei @xcite , @xcite and in particular of @xmath1be .",
    "the resonating group method ( rgm ) has often been used @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the low - lying rotational structure of @xmath1be , both in position and width , is reproduced by elastic @xmath0 scattering calculations with effective interactions .",
    "the coulomb interaction plays an important role in the correct position and width of these states , in particular for @xmath12 groundstate of @xmath1be @xcite , @xcite .",
    "collective @xmath13-particle deformation models for light nuclei have been under discussion for several decades .",
    "a meaningful classification scheme has been derived for such models through the irreducible representations of the non - compact sp(2 , r ) group . a good description of the low - energy spectra of light nuclei @xcite , and more specifically of the rotational structure of @xmath1be @xcite has been obtained within these models .",
    "it has also been demonstrated that the quadrupole sp(2,r ) model of @xmath1be and the @xmath14-particle description have an important overlap , and thus are complementary in the description of this nucleus @xcite , a conclusion confirmed in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it seems therefore appropriate to study the coexistence and competition between collectivity and clustering in light nuclei through a combined approach .",
    "filippov et al .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite have already investigated cluster - monopole and cluster - quadrupole descriptions of @xmath1be .",
    "the deformation aspect in @xmath1be has been studied within a cluster approach by introducing a quadrupolar polarization of the @xmath14-particles @xcite , or a monopolar distortion of the @xmath14-particles @xcite .    in this work",
    "we propose a model in which the @xmath14-particle description and the collective ( 8-particle ) quadrupole and monopole modes are coupled .",
    "we consider a scattering approach within an energy range in which the @xmath14 cluster channel is open , and both collective channels are closed , thus limiting ourselves to the elastic @xmath0 cluster decay .",
    "the effects of the collective channels will then only be apparent in the compound system during resonance lifetimes .",
    "we implement our coupled channels approach within the modified j - matrix method ( mjm ) @xcite , @xcite also known as the algebraic model @xcite,@xcite .",
    "it determines an approximate solution of the schrdinger equation in terms of square - integrable bases , and maps both scattering or bound - state boundary conditions from configuration to the space of basis expansion coefficients . as such it allows for a simultaneous treatment of open and closed channels .",
    "the mjm is an extension of the j - matrix method ( jm ) @xcite using an oscillator basis .",
    "the mjm allows one to treat long - range interactions , including the coulomb potential , in that basis .",
    "it provides convergence in terms of number of basis functions with reasonable basis sizes , which is important because calculation of hamiltonian matrix elements is the bulk of the computational load of the method .",
    "the multi - channel approach of this work allows for a clear - cut analysis of the elastic @xmath0 phase shifts and corresponding wave functions in terms of the contribution from the individual channels , leading to a physical interpretation of the resonances .",
    "it indicates the importance of collective degrees of freedom in the compound system .",
    "our approach is most suited to handle two - body gaussian interactions , mainly because of the oscillator expansion in the mjm .",
    "we consider two - body potentials such as the one proposed in @xcite and determined within a hartree - fock approximation , and the ones from @xcite , @xcite determined within an rgm approach , to calculate the @xmath1be spectrum , and check the validity of our conclusions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we elaborate on the combined cluster - collective model description for @xmath1be and formulate the multi - channel mjm scattering approach . in section iii",
    "we discuss the numerical application of the mjm and present the results of the three - channel calculation .",
    "section iv is devoted to the analysis of the results of the previous section in terms of contributions from the individual channels .",
    "concluding remarks are presented in section v.",
    "the modified j - matrix method @xcite , @xcite also referred to as the algebraic version of the rgm @xcite , has become a well - tested approach for nuclear structure calculations involving multi - channel cluster and/or collective descriptions for light nuclei .",
    "the application of the mjm is based on an expansion in terms of oscillator basis states in the respective collective coordinates ( intercluster distance , monopole radius , quadrupole deformation , ... ) .",
    "we refer to the papers of vasilevsky et al .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite for detailed properties of the individual channel wave functions , and the multi - channel formulation of the mjm @xcite with non - orthogonal bases .    the model considered here for @xmath1be consists of a wave function containing three structure components distinguished by a specific collective coordinate .",
    "these three components represent the @xmath0 cluster , the sp(2,r ) quadrupole and the sp(2,r ) monopole modes@xmath15    the structure of a single cluster is described by a wave function @xmath16@xmath17 centered around its centre of mass @xmath18 .    a two - cluster wave function",

    "the cluster wave functions are frozen , and constructed as slater determinants of harmonic oscillator ( @xmath24)-states , corresponding to the groundstate shell - model configuration of the cluster . the @xmath22 wave function for the relative motion",
    "will be represented by an expansion in terms of an oscillator basis in @xmath23 .",
    "as the cluster states are frozen and built of ( @xmath24)-orbitals , the quantum numbers reduce to those of the inter - cluster wave function only .",
    "the set of quantum numbers is unambiguously defined and is obtained from the reduction of the symmetry group @xmath25 of the one - dimensional oscillator .",
    "this reduction provides the quantum numbers @xmath26 for the radial excitation , and @xmath27 for the angular momentum of the two - cluster system .",
    "the two - cluster wave function can be decomposed as@xmath28 \\label{eq : clexpansion}\\\\ &   = \\sum_{n}c_{nl}^{c}\\mathcal{a}\\left [   \\psi_{1}\\left (   \\alpha_{1}\\right ) \\",
    "\\psi_{2}\\left (   \\alpha_{2}\\right )   \\ \\phi_{nlm}\\left (   \\mathbf{r}\\right ) \\right ]   = \\sum_{n}c_{nl}^{c}\\psi_{nlm}^{c},\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the @xmath29 are the three - dimensional harmonic oscillator states .",
    "the oscillator parameter @xmath30 is the same for both the individual particle ( @xmath24 ) states , and the expansion for the relative motion .",

    "for @xmath1be this is a slater determinant with a @xmath34 configuration ( in cartesian @xmath35 oscillator notation ) and it has su(3 ) @xmath36 classification .",
    "the @xmath37 stands for the traditional angular momentum projection operator and @xmath38 , @xmath39 are norm factors .",
    "the ( translationally invariant ) step operators @xmath40 in a cartesian notation @xmath41 are written , in terms of the standard harmonic oscillator creation operators @xmath42 for particle @xmath43:@xmath44",
    "so that@xmath45    the projection after excitation for the quadrupole mode in ( [ eq : qexpansion ] ) is necessary because the step operator @xmath46 contains both @xmath12 and @xmath10 components . in the monopole case ,",
    "the projection operator commutes with the step operators . a single projection of the @xmath33 state , which contains @xmath47 and @xmath48 components suffices .",
    "thus the monopole mode contributes only to those @xmath49-subspaces .",
    "contrary to the cluster and quadrupole modes , this limits the monopole hilbert space to the latter angular momenta",
    ". we will therefore limit ourselves to @xmath47 and @xmath48 for all modes throughout this work .",
    "we use the same oscillator parameter @xmath30 for @xmath50 and @xmath51 functions as we do for the cluster wave function @xmath52 .",
    "this makes the calculation of overlap and  hamiltonian matrix elements significantly easier .",
    "one has of course orthogonality with respect to the quantum numbers @xmath53 , but not with respect to the channel label:@xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 stand for the cluster ( @xmath57 ) , monopole ( @xmath58 ) and quadrupole ( @xmath59)channels . in particular it is well known @xcite that with a common choice of overall @xmath30 the @xmath60 basis states of all modes are identical : @xmath61    this means that care should be taken in the interpretation of the results when attributing an effect to some channel or other .",
    "the calculation of overlap and hamiltonian matrix elements is most easily performed by considering gaussian - type generating functions for the three oscillator expansions , which are ( up to @xmath49-projection)@xmath62 \\nonumber\\\\ &   = \\mathcal{a}\\left [   \\psi_{1}\\left (   a_{1}\\right )   \\ \\psi_{2}\\left ( a_{2}\\right )   \\ \\exp\\left\\ {   -\\frac{1}{2b^{2}}\\mathbf{r}^{2}+\\frac{\\sqrt{2}% } { b^{2}}\\left (   \\mathbf{rr}\\right )   -\\frac{1}{2b^{2}}\\mathbf{r}^{2}\\right\\ } \\right ] \\nonumber\\\\ &   = \\mathcal{a}\\left [   \\psi_{1}\\left (   a_{1}\\right )   \\ \\psi_{2}\\left ( a_{2}\\right )   \\ \\exp\\left\\ {   \\left (   \\mathbf{r\\bullet a}_{c}^{+}\\right ) \\right\\ }   \\exp\\left\\ {   -\\frac{1}{2b^{2}}\\mathbf{r}^{2}\\right\\ }   \\right ] ; \\nonumber\\\\ \\psi^{q}(\\epsilon )   &   = \\exp\\{\\epsilon a_{q}^{+}\\}\\phi_{0};\\nonumber\\\\ \\psi^{m}(\\nu )   &   = \\exp\\{\\nu a_{m}^{+}\\}\\phi_{0},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we introduced the step operator @xmath63 for the oscillator decomposition of the cluster wave function .",
    "because of the gaussian nature of the generating functions , matrix elements for the overlaps and gaussian two - body operators can be calculated in a straightforward way . from these the matrix elements in the discrete @xmath53 basis",
    "can then be obtained by e.g. recurrence techniques @xcite , @xcite .    by substituting the expansions ( [ eq : clexpansion ] , [ eq : qexpansion ] , [ eq : mexpansion ] ) as an ansatz for the solution ( [ eq : wf ] ) in the schrdinger equation ,",
    "the latter reduces to an infinite matrix equation to be solved for the coefficients @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66:@xmath67    we solve this equation by considering the modified j - matrix approach , which was formulated in terms of an oscillator decomposition of the trial solution , and provides fast convergence in a finite subset of the model subspace . in the j - matrix approach",
    "the boundary conditions ( for scattering as well as bound - state solutions ) are translated from coordinate into the space of basis expansion coefficients , and asymptotic solutions can be obtained from a three - term recurrence relation for the expansion coefficients for high @xmath26 .",
    "considering the coefficients to equal the asymptotic values from a given @xmath68 on , and imposing a matching condition between the interaction region and asymptotic regions , only a reasonably sized matrix equation remains to be solved . in the modified j - matrix approach asymptotic contributions for the potential behavior , in particular for the coulomb term ,",
    "are taken into account in a semi - classical way through a modified recurrence equation .",
    "this was shown to reduce the size @xmath69 of the  remaining matrix equation drastically .",
    "for the scattering boundary condition the asymptotic regular @xmath70 and irregular @xmath71 solutions are obtained so that the asymptotic expansion coefficients of the solution can be written as@xmath72 where @xmath73 stands for the @xmath73-matrix and reflects the matching condition .",
    "it is to be determined by solving the remaining matrix equation .",

    "is a scalar quantity related to the phase - shift only .    for the bound - state boundary condition only the exponentially decaying solution can be retained , and its expansion coefficients are@xmath77 with @xmath78 . in the equations ( [ eq : openasymp ] ) and ( [ eq : boundasymp ] ) the energy @xmath75 is determined with respect to threshold of the corresponding channels .    in our approach",
    "we have three different channels , so a multi - channel mjm formulation is necessary .",
    "we take the same form as in @xcite and write @xmath79 with @xmath56 the entrance channel , and @xmath55 any other coupled channel .",
    "substitution of ( [ eq : channelcoeffs ] ) in the matrix form of the schrdinger equation leads to @xmath80 \\nonumber\\\\ &   = -\\beta_{0}^{(-)\\tau}\\ \\delta_{n,0}\\ \\delta_{\\upsilon\\tau}-v_{n}^{\\left ( -\\right )   \\tau\\upsilon } \\label{eq : finalmjmeqs}%\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath81 where @xmath82  stands for the two - body interaction and @xmath83 accounts for the traditional regularization of the irregular asymptotic solution ( see for instance @xcite or @xcite ) .",
    "this system of equations should then be solved for the residual coefficients @xmath84 and the @xmath73-matrix elements @xmath85 .",
    "we consider in equations ( [ eq : finalmjmeqs]-[eq : dynamiccoeff ] ) a near - interaction region with @xmath86 and a far - interaction region with @xmath87 .",
    "the choice of @xmath69 is such that one can expect the residual expansion coefficients @xmath88 to be negligibly small in the far - interaction region .",
    "the total number of equations for a given entrance channel @xmath56 then equals to @xmath89 , and solving the set of equations by traditional numerical linear algebra leads to the @xmath90 residual coefficients @xmath91 and @xmath92 @xmath73-matrix elements @xmath93 .",
    "the set of equations has to be solved for all @xmath92 entrance channels .",
    "a final parameter of the calculation concerns the summation in ( [ eq : dynamiccoeff ] ) .",
    "because the potential matrix elements decrease rapidly when @xmath94 gets large , we can truncate this sum at some @xmath95 .    in this paper",
    "we limit ourselves to the situation in which only the cluster channel is open , so that @xmath96 , because this is the dominant channel for @xmath1be in our model description .",
    "the boundary conditions ( [ eq : openasymp ] ) are appropriate for an open channel , and are therefore used for the cluster channel ; conditions ( [ eq : boundasymp ] ) are appropriate for a closed channel and are thus applied to the monopole and quadrupole channels .",
    "this choice limits the energy range between the monopole threshold at 0 mev ( all 8 particles infinitely apart ) and the cluster threshold .",
    "the quadrupole threshold is even higher , because of the forced polarization condition .",
    "in a microscopic calculation the choice of the effective nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) interaction remains a crucial point .",
    "we limit ourselves to effective nn interactions of gaussian form , which lead to a straightforward evaluation of matrix elements in the cluster - collective model space .",
    "one well - known example is volkov @xcite force , which was essentially determined and used within a hartree - fock context .",
    "this force binds both the deuteron triplet as well as the dinucleon singlet .",
    "gaussian forces that discriminate between the deuteron triplet and dinucleon triplet are the minnesota @xcite and the hasegawa - nagata @xcite , @xcite potentials .",
    "a modified version of the latter was proposed in @xcite .",
    "these interactions were considered and tested in @xmath97 and @xmath0 rgm scattering calculations .    in the current calculations we consider the volkov ( v1 ) , modified hasegawa - nagata ( mhn ) and minnesota ( mi ) forces .",
    "we include the coulomb interaction which is necessary to produce the @xmath12 ground - state as a narrow resonance just above the @xmath0 threshold .",
    "the parameters are chosen to reproduce both the ground state energy and size of @xmath3he .",
    "the majorana exchange part accounts for nuclear matter properties .",
    "it does not influence the ground state energy and size of @xmath3he , but affects the deformation in @xmath98-shell nuclei significantly @xcite .    to obtain the phase - shifts for elastic @xmath0 scattering we solve ( [ eq : finalmjmeqs ] ) , and determine resonance positions and widths in the usual numerical way through @xmath99    we fix the common oscillator parameter @xmath30 for the c , q and m expansion bases for each of the potentials so as to optimize an acceptable @xmath0 threshold .",
    "these values can be found in table [ tab : forces ] .",

    "also shown in the table are the respective threshold energies for the three channels , which amounts to twice the binding energy of the @xmath14-particle for the cluster channel , zero energy ( all 8 particles apart ) for the monopole channel , and a positive value for the quadrupole channel ( all 8 particles apart under the quadrupole deformation restriction ) .",
