    "the calculation of binding energies , masses of heavy quarkonia @xmath7 and another physical parameter using renormalon method has attracted the attention recently .",
    "the calculations , based on perturbative expansions , are primarily due to the knowledge of up to @xmath8 term ( @xmath9 ) of the static quark - antiquark potential @xmath10 @xcite and partial knowledge of the @xmath11 term there , and the ultrasoft gluon contributions to a corresponding effective theory @xmath11 hamiltonian @xcite ; and the knowledge of the pole mass @xmath2 up to order @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "another impetus in these calculations was given by the observation of the fact that the contributions of the leading infrared ( ir ) renormalon singularities ( at @xmath13 ) of the pole mass @xmath2 and of the static potential @xmath10 cancel in the sum @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "consequently , this cancellation effect must be present also in the total quarkonium mass @xmath15 @xcite , or more precisely , in @xmath3 where @xmath1 is the hard@xmath16soft part of the binding energy , i.e. , the part which includes the contributions of relative quark - antiquark momenta @xmath17 , @xmath18 , i.e. , soft / potential scales ( predominant ) and higher hard scales ( smaller contributions ) .",
    "in addition , the binding energy has contribution @xmath19 from the ultrasoft momenta regime @xmath17 , @xmath20 .",
    "the ultrasoft contribution is not related to the @xmath13 renormalon singularity , since this singularity has to do with the behavior of theory in the region which includes the hard ( @xmath21 ) and soft / potential ( @xmath22 ) scales .",
    "this contribution is based on ref .",
    "@xcite and we present numerical calculation of the binding ground energies @xmath23 ( separately the @xmath24 and the @xmath25 parts ) and the mass @xmath26 of the heavy @xmath0 system , by taking into account the leading ir renormalon structure of @xmath27 and @xmath28 , and combining some features as : ( a ) the mass that we use in the perturbation expansions is a renormalon - free mass @xcite which we choose to be the @xmath4 mass @xmath29 ; ( b ) borel integrations @xcite are used to perform resummations . before resummations",
    "we perform separation of the soft / potential ( @xmath24 ) and ultrasoft ( @xmath25 ) part of the binding energies , and apply the renormalon - based borel resummation only to the @xmath24 part .",
    "the renormalization scales used in the borel resummations are @xmath30 ( hard scale ) for @xmath31 , and @xmath32 for @xmath33 .",
    "the term corresponding to @xmath19 is evaluated at @xmath34 whenever perturbatively possible .",
    "further , the borel resummations are performed in three different ways : ( a ) using a slightly extended version of the full bilocal expansion refs .",
    "@xcite ; ( b ) using a new `` @xmath35-regularized '' full bilocal expansion introduced in the ref .",
    "@xcite ; ( c ) using the form of the borel transform where the leading ir renormalon structure is a common factor of the transform @xcite ( we call it @xmath36-method ) .",
    "the borel integrations for both @xmath2 and @xmath33 are performed by the same prescription ( generalized principal value pv @xcite ) so as to ensure the numerical cancellation of the renormalon contributions in the sum @xmath37 .",
    "furthermore , we demonstrate numerically that in the latter sum the residues at the renormalons are really consistent with the renormalon cancellation when a reasonable factorization scale parameter for the @xmath24-@xmath25 separation is used , while they become incosistent with the aforementioned cancellation when no such separation is used .",
    "the numerical results allow us to extract the mass @xmath38 from the known @xmath39 mass of the @xmath0 system .",
