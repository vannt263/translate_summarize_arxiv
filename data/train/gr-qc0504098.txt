    "in recent years a number of authors have studied solutions to the einstein field equations corresponding to anisotropic matter where the radial component of the pressure differs from the angular component .",
    "the gravitational field is taken to be spherically symmetric and static since these solutions may be applied to relativistic stars . a number of researchers have examined how anisotropic matter affects the critical mass , critical surface redshift and stability of highly compact bodies .",
    "these investigations are contained in the papers @xcite , among others .",
    "some researchers have suggested that anisotropy may be important in understanding the gravitational behaviour of boson stars and the role of strange matter with densities higher than neutron stars .",
    "mak and harko @xcite and sharma and mukherjee @xcite suggest that anisotropy is a crucial ingredient in the description of dense stars with strange matter .    in this paper",
    "our objective is to generate a new class of exact solutions to the einstein field equations corresponding to a physically reasonable form for the energy density .",
    "a particular motive is to find simple analytic forms for the gravitational and matter variables so that the physical interpretation of the model is simplified .",
    "often the solutions are presented in terms of special functions or a numerical approach is required @xcite .",
    "we hope that our results in terms of elementary functions will assist in the analysis of gravitational behaviour of compact objects , and the study of anisotropy under strong gravitational fields . in section [ sec : ii ]",
    "we develop the anisotropic stellar model and present the relevant field equations .",
    "a particular form for the energy density is chosen in section [ sec : iii ] , and the einstein field equations are integrated .",
    "special cases of physical interest are isolated from the general solution in section [ sec : iv ] .",
    "some physical features of the anisotropic star are briefly considered in section [ sec : v ] . in section [ sec : vi ] we demonstrate that our model yields surface redshifts and masses that correspond to real sources , and make a few concluding remarks and suggestions for future research .",
    "the line element for static spherically symmetric spacetimes is given by @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are arbitrary functions .",
    "we study non - radiating relativistic spheres with anisotropic stress , and the energy - momentum tensor is of the form @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the energy density , @xmath5 the isotropic pressure , and the projection tensor @xmath6 is measured relative to the four - velocity @xmath7 .",
    "it is convenient to express the anisotropic stress in the form @xmath8 where the unit spacelike vector @xmath9 is orthogonal to the fluid four - velocity @xmath10 and @xmath11 is the magnitude of the stress tensor .",
    "this representation for @xmath12 is a consequence of the symmetries of the static spherically symmetric spacetimes @xcite .",
    "the quantity @xmath13 is a useful device to introduce @xmath14 which are the radial and tangential pressures respectively .",
    "note that for isotropic matter @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the magnitude @xmath13 provides a measure of anisotropy .",
    "we assume that the fluid four - velocity is comoving .",
    "this assumption implies that @xmath17 .    using and ,",
    "the einstein field equations become    @xmath18    [ efes ]    for static spherically symmetric anisotropic matter . we are using units where the speed of light and the coupling constant are unity .",
    "the momentum conservation equation leads to @xmath19 for the spacetime ( [ metric2 ] ) .",
    "this conservation equation is not independent and can be generated directly from the field equations .",
    "we define the mass function as @xmath20 following the treatment of stephani @xcite . with the help of ( [ masstdiveqn ] ) and ( [ massfun ] ) we can integrate , and then get the equivalent system    @xmath21    [ efes2 ]    the system ( [ efes2 ] ) has the advantage of being a first order system of differential equations , and is linear in the gravitational potential @xmath22 which simplifies the integration process . for certain applications",
    "it is easier to use ( [ efes2 ] ) rather than the original second order system ( [ efes ] ) , which is the approach that we follow in this paper .",
    "we seek explicit solutions to the einstein field equations that describe realistic anisotropic relativistic stars by utilising an algorithm that was initially proposed by maharaj and maartens @xcite . in their approach",
    "they expressed the field equations as the first order system of differential equations .",
    "the energy density @xmath4 ( or equivalently @xmath23 ) and the radial pressure @xmath24 are chosen on physical grounds .",
    "the remaining relevant quantities @xmath25 then follow from the field equations .",
    "note that @xmath26 are not independent ; there are five unknown functions and three field equations so that we have the freedom to choose any two of the quantities . in this paper",
    "we make explicit choices for @xmath4 and @xmath24 .",
    "it is convenient to make the following choice for the energy density @xmath27 where @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are constants .",
    "the roles of @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 in the physics of the model are highlighted in examples considered later .",
    "an advantage of this form for @xmath4 is that it contains particular cases studied previously .",
    "then ( [ massfun ] ) yields the following expression for the mass function @xmath31 with the particular energy density ( [ muiii ] ) .",
    "equation gives @xmath32 and the gravitational potential @xmath33 has been determined .    with the help of ( [ miii ] )",
    ", we can write ( [ efes2:2 ] ) as @xmath34 where we have used partial fractions . on integration",
    ", can be expressed as @xmath35 where @xmath36 is a constant of integration and we have set @xmath37 at this point we could choose a barotropic equation of state @xmath38 .",
    "however this is an approach that we intend to follow in future work . in this treatment",
    "we make a choice for the radial pressure @xmath24 which is physically reasonable and is a generalisation of earlier studies .",
    "we make the choice @xmath39 when @xmath40 , we obtain the radial pressure postulated by maharaj and maartens @xcite . for @xmath41 ,",
    "we regain the radial pressure of gokhroo and mehra @xcite .",
    "the form for @xmath24 is physically reasonable because @xmath42 in the interval @xmath43 for relevant choices of the constants , @xmath44 at the centre @xmath45 , @xmath46 at the boundary @xmath47 , and @xmath24 is continuous and well behaved in the interval @xmath48 $ ] .",

    "case i _ and _ case ii _ that @xmath57 the integrals @xmath49 and @xmath51 are given in terms of elementary functions which helps in the physical analysis of the model .",
    "on substituting @xmath49 in ( [ nuiii ] ) we obtain @xmath58 for the gravitational potential @xmath59 where @xmath60 has the functional representation given above in ( [ i2_lcases ] ) for @xmath52 and @xmath61 . to match the interior solution to the schwarzschild interior",
    "we require that @xmath62 which implies that @xmath63 .",
    "finally the last field equation ( [ efes2:3 ] ) gives the tangential pressure @xmath64 : @xmath65 where we have used ( [ muiii ] ) , ( [ pr_choice ] ) and ( [ e_nuiii ] ) .",
    "the anisotropic factor @xmath66 is given by @xmath67 which follows from ( [ pr_choice ] ) and ( [ p_perp ] ) .",

    "collecting the various results given above we can express the exact solution as    @xmath68    [ xsols ]    where @xmath51 ( given in ( [ i2_lcases ] ) ) contains the two cases , @xmath52 and @xmath61 .",
    "the exact solution ( [ xsols ] ) represents the interior of an anisotropic star corresponding to the energy density @xmath69 .",
    "clearly other choices for @xmath4 and @xmath24 will yield new solutions to the field equations ; however these choices may not correspond to realistic matter or the integrals @xmath49 and @xmath51 may not be expressible in closed form .",
    "this solution does not have a barotropic equation of state @xmath38 . to obtain a model with an equation of state",
    "we need to specify this explicitly when evaluating the integral @xmath49 .",
    "an equation of state is a desirable physical feature which we hope to incorporate in future models .",
    "note that the cosmological constant is absent from our model .",
    "this quantity can be easily included by adding a constant to the energy density and the pressure function .",

    "dev and gleiser @xcite , herrera and santos @xcite and petri @xcite found solutions to the anisotropic einstein field equations involving @xmath82 . in each of these papers a different set of assumptions to that utilised in this paper was used ; in our treatment we have chosen a form for the radial pressure @xmath24 . therefore their solutions are necessarily different from for the corresponding energy density choice @xmath83 .",
    "one of the original reasons for studying anisotropic matter was to generate models that permit redshifts higher than the critical redshift @xmath84 of isotropic matter @xcite .",
    "observational results indicate that certain isolated objects have redshifts higher than @xmath84 .",
    "the surface redshift is given by @xmath85 the critical redshift @xmath86 is the limiting value for the perfect fluid spheres , and is attained when @xmath87 @xcite . for the range of values falling in the interval @xmath88 the redshift is greater than @xmath84 ; this phenomenon may be explained by allowing for anisotropy . for values of @xmath89 close to unity",
    ", the surface redshift becomes infinitely large .",
    "the feasibility of higher redshifts for anisotropic matter , in both newtonian and relativistic models , was firmly established by bondi @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that bondi , binney and tremaine @xcite , cuddeford @xcite and michie @xcite emphasise the significance of anisotropies in stellar clusters and galaxies , in addition to individual stars .",
    "the gravitational potential @xmath90 is finite at the centre @xmath45 and at the boundary @xmath47 .",
    "the function @xmath91 is well behaved in the interior of the relativistic star .",
    "the gravitational potential @xmath59 is continuous and well behaved in the interior and finite at the boundary of the star @xmath47 .",
    "there is a singularity at the centre @xmath45 in the potential @xmath59 .",
    "the singularity in @xmath59 is removable for a specific choice of parameter values .",
    "this singularity is eliminated by setting @xmath41 which corresponds to the solution of gokhroo and mehra @xcite .",
    "the energy density chosen describes relativistic stars as we demonstrate later .",
    "the form of @xmath92 is usually used in domains where it is not possible to use a single equation of state ; particularly where the origin is excluded , like a body with a constant density core and matter density distribution around the core going like @xmath93 @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to observe that the @xmath93 profile in the energy density also arises in isothermal spheres in newtonian configurations that correspond to a maxwell - boltzmann gas in galactic systems @xcite .",
    "densities with @xmath94 and @xmath95 are also physically reasonable .",
    "for example , misner and zapolsky @xcite propose that the term @xmath96 models the physical configuration of a relativistic fermi gas for some particular value of the parameter @xmath28 .",
    "another example is due to dev and gleiser @xcite who suggest that for some particular value of @xmath28 and @xmath97 the energy density function @xmath98 describes a relativistic fermi gas core immersed in a constant density background .",
    "the radial pressure @xmath24 is continuous and well behaved in the interior of the star .",
    "also @xmath42 in the interval @xmath99 , regular at the centre @xmath100 , and vanishes at the boundary @xmath101 .",
    "the tangential pressure @xmath64 has a singularity at the centre , but is otherwise well behaved throughout the interior of the star and finite at the boundary .",
    "the singularity in @xmath64 may be eliminated by suitable particular choice of parameter values . in general",
    "the tangential pressure is not zero at the boundary of the star @xmath102 which is different from the radial pressure @xmath103 .",
    "it is also important to observe that the magnitude of the stress tensor @xmath104 is a nonzero function in general .",
    "hence this class of solutions is generally anisotropic and does not have an isotropic limit ( the isotropic limit results when we set particular values for the constants in our ansatz ) .",
    "it is not possible to eliminate @xmath13 and obtain an isotropic counterpart .",
    "this means that the model remains anisotropic .",
    "an analogous situation rises in einstein - maxwell solutions modelling charged relativistic stars in which the electric field is always present .",
    "an example of such a charged star is given by hansraj @xcite .    figures [ muplots ] , [ prplots ] , and [ splots ] are illustrations of the behaviour of the energy density @xmath4 , the radial pressure @xmath24 , and the anisotropy factor @xmath13 respectively , for particular chosen values of the constants in the exact solution .",
    "the radial distance is over the interval @xmath105 and the boundary of the star has been normalised to be @xmath106 .",
    "note that plot a corresponds to @xmath41 case ( _ solution i _ ) , plot b corresponds to @xmath40 ( _ solution ii _ ) and plot c corresponds to the general solution where @xmath107 , @xmath97 , and @xmath61 . in figure [ muplots ] for @xmath4 , plots a and b are continuous throughout the interval @xmath105",
    "; however plot c indicates unphysical behaviour as we approach the centre .",
    "this undesirable feature in plot c arises because @xmath107 and indicates that another solution has to be utilised around the centre in a core - envelope model @xcite . in figure [ prplots ] for @xmath24 ,",
    "the radial pressure is monotonically decreasing from the centre to the boundary for all plots a , b , and c. in figure [ splots ] for @xmath13 , plots a and b are continuous throughout the interval @xmath105 ; however plot c indicates a singularity as we approach @xmath45 .",
    "we suspect that this singularity in plot c is related to the fact that @xmath108 .",
    "we observe that the gradient of @xmath13 is greatest for plot c , corresponding the case for @xmath107 , @xmath97 , and @xmath61 , as the boundary is approached .",
    "hence @xmath109 has the largest value at the boundary for the general solution in this case .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath13 outside the centre is likely to correspond to physically reasonable anisotropic matter : plot b has a profile similar to the behaviour of the anisotropic boson stars studied by dev and gleiser @xcite .",
    "however the general solution obtained by dev and gleiser @xcite for the choice is given in terms of hypergeometric functions .",
    "our corresponding solution has the advantage of being expressed in terms of elementary functions .",
    "it is possible to demonstrate that the solutions found can be utilised to discuss the structure of neutron stars and quasi - stellar objects .",
    "we write the surface density in the particular form @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the central density and the constants @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 have been chosen so that the energy density can be easily expressed in c.g.s .",
    "now consider a neutron star of radius 10 km and surface density of @xmath112 .",
    "then the parameters @xmath111 , @xmath113 , @xmath89 , surface redshift @xmath114 , and mass @xmath115 in terms of the solar masses @xmath116 can be calculated .",
    "we choose values of @xmath117 and @xmath118 so that comparison with gokhroo and mehra @xcite is facilitated .",
    "the results are given in table [ table ] .",
    "in this category of results the surface redshifts range up to @xmath119 , and masses extend to @xmath120 .",
    "this range of values is consistent with the results of gokhroo and mehra @xcite .",
    "hence our solutions yield values for surface redshifts and masses that correspond to realistic stellar sources such as her x-1 and vela x-1",
    ". clearly higher values for @xmath121 and @xmath115 can be generated by adjusting @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    ".[table ] densities and redshifts for neutron stars [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in this paper we have found a new class of solutions to the einstein field equations for an anisotropic matter distribution utilising the algorithm of maharaj and maartens @xcite .",
    "these solutions correspond to the energy density @xmath122 and contain particular solutions found previously .",
    "we note that the term containing @xmath96 is physically important and arises in a number of applications @xcite .",
    "our results indicate that anisotropic solutions for the physically reasonable energy density @xmath83 can be generated with the simple solution generating mechanism of maharaj and maartens @xcite .",
    "our ongoing investigations indicate that a general class of anisotropic models are possible , for different choices of @xmath4 , such that the desired limit @xmath83 is regained as we approach the boundary .",
    "this work is in preparation .",
    "observe from that the anisotropy factor @xmath13 is nonzero in general in the interior of the star .",
    "this means that the exact solution remains anisotropic and does not have an isotropic limit .",
    "we would need to use another approach of integrating the anisotropic einstein field equations than the algorithm used in this paper , if an isotropic limit is to be contained in the stellar model .",
