    "the most common phases found for bent - core liquid crystals are smectics @xcite .",
    "it has therefore been quite surprising to discover that these systems can also stabilize the thermotropic uniaxial ( @xmath9)- and biaxial nematic ( @xmath10 ) phases @xcite , with quest for @xmath10 occupying soft matter research for more than 30 years now ( _ see e.g._@xcite ) . to date the factors crucial for absolute stability of the @xmath10 phase in bent - core systems",
    "are not fully understood . in this work",
    "we carry out mc npt simulations for model bent - core ( v - shaped ) molecules to seek for the _ minimal molecular features _ necessary to stabilize @xmath10 .",
    "an excellent recent review on theoretical- and computer simulation attempts to find the @xmath10 phase in model systems is found in @xcite .",
    "a brief summary of the results relevant for what follows is given below .",
    "the lattice simulations with _ bent - core _ dispersion centers occupying lattice sites of a cubic lattice show that the @xmath10 phase can be stabilized about the landau point at , or close to , the tetrahedral opening angle of @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "additional inclusion of the dipole - dipole interactions with dipole moments along the @xmath12 molecular axis can transform the landau point into a landau line @xcite .",
    "the presently existing simulations for model bent - core mesogens with centers of mass free to move ( off - lattice ) are less optimistic .",
    "the excluded volume effects ( packing entropy ) make the stable nematic phases , especially the biaxial one , rare to appear in these systems .",
    "for example , an ensemble of bend - core molecules formed by two rigid spherocylinders joined at one end stabilize only @xmath9 and isotropic fluid @xcite . replacing spherocylinders with gay - berne ( gb ) centers of @xmath5 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 ,",
    "also does not bring a stable biaxial nematic , as shown by memmer @xcite and johnston _ et al _ @xcite .",
    "even the @xmath9 phase disappears for an intermediate opening angle of @xmath13 .",
    "similar conclusions as concerning stability of @xmath9 can be drawn from npt mc simulations of dewar and camp @xcite for the multi - site bent - core model of rigidly connected lj spherical sites . before proceeding further",
    "we would like to mention about an interesting observation in aforementioned simulations of memmer @xcite and johnston _ et al _ @xcite .",
    "it concerns the appearance of a spontaneously chiral , helical state close to the uniaxial nematic - smectic phase transition .",
    "memmer , however , has made it clear that the existence of the helical structure might be an artefact of the method he used for this structure was not reproduced in every run .",
    "the metropolis mc simulations for model bent - core molecules with dipole moments have also been carried out with an attempt to bringing the molecular modeling close to the experimental situation .",
    "unfortunately , the presence of a single dipole located on the @xmath12 molecular axis has led so far to neither @xmath10 nor @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "but two point dipoles placed at the centers of the lateral sites of a three gb bent - core molecule were shown to stabilize the @xmath9 phase in npt mc simulations @xcite . moving the dipoles towards the terminal positions of the molecular arms broadened the uniaxial nematic range .",
    "finally , the molecules with terminal flexible chains also do not help to stabilize @xmath9 or @xmath10 @xcite , but the simultaneous presence of flexible tails and molecular dipoles along the @xmath12 axis can lead to the @xmath9 phase @xcite .",
    "however , in none of the off - lattice simulations mentioned so far the biaxial nematic phase was detected .    to date",
    ", the only off - lattice simulation for bent - core systems that reveals the biaxial nematic phase has been that of pelez and wilson @xcite .",
    "they performed the molecular dynamics simulation for real molecules with experimentally detected @xmath10 phase @xcite using a full - atomistic potential .",
    "the biaxial nematic phase with local ferroelectric domains was observed on cooling down an isotropic phase .",
    "however , the same atomistic model with electrostatic charges switched off gave a stable smectic phase instead of @xmath10 .",
    "this seems to indicate that a subtle balance between an average bent molecular shape , molecular flexibility and transverse dipoles is essential for bent - core mesogenic molecules to stabilize the @xmath10 phase , and that the question of the minimal molecular features necessary to obtain @xmath10 is still open .    in this work we present results of metropolis mc npt simulations aimed at seeking for such minimal molecular features necessary to stabilize @xmath10 for v - shaped molecules .",
    "we check as whether the elongation of the molecular arms can play any role .",
    "we also study some consequences of fluctuations in opening angle .",
    "we choose the model similar to that of memmer @xcite , where bent - core molecules were built out of two gay - berne ( gb ) centers representing molecule s arms .",
    "an attractive feature of the model @xcite is that it shows the stable @xmath9 phase in a relatively wide temperature range .",
    "our model differs from the original one by longer molecular arms .",
    "in addition we allow for harmonic fluctuations in the opening angle .",
    "both changes are shown to have a significant effect on the nematic polymorphism , indicating that the lengthening of the molecular arms can help stabilizing the @xmath10 phase .",

    "the case of @xmath57 corresponds to a rigid molecule .    in our simulations we study the model with the following gb parameters : @xmath0 , @xmath58 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",

    "the parameters different from ours were @xmath5 and @xmath64 .",
    "only the case with rigid molecules ( @xmath57 ) was considered .",

    "the square root part gives a constant factor and , hence , cancels out with similar terms in @xmath70 .",
    "the mc cycle consisted of probing a new configuration for each molecule followed by volume rescaling along a randomly chosen edge of the simulation box .",

    "the pressure was taken the same as in @xcite .",

    "in addition , the crystalline phase found on cooling was heated up all the way back to estimate the stability range of the phases found .",
    "the equilibration appeared slow and took between @xmath76 and @xmath77 cycles after which the data were collected for structure analysis once per 10 cycles over a production run of @xmath78 cycles .",
    "interestingly , the biaxial nematic phase was found on cooling down . to check its stability",
    "we also melted ground state crystalline structures under higher pressures , from @xmath79 to @xmath80 in step of 1 .",

    "more specifically , let the director @xmath87 , corresponding to the largest eigenvalue of @xmath88 , be parallel to @xmath89 .",
    "then the smectic ordering along @xmath87 can be examined with the distribution function @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the average length of the simulation box along @xmath89 , @xmath92 represents coordinate of the @xmath34-th molecule along @xmath89 , and @xmath93 is the dirac delta .",
