    "this paper describes new mathematical expressions for pad approximants , and some of their variants . a pad approximant is a rational function whose power series expansion in ascending powers of the variable matches a given formal power series as far as possible @xcite .",
    "thus , it can be understood as a rational hermite interpolant at zero , and it is usually written under the form of a rational fraction or as the convergent of a certain continued fraction . on the other hand , a rational interpolant can be given under the form of a rational fraction , or as the convergent of a continued fraction , or under a barycentric form .",
    "in this paper , we will show that a pad approximant can also be written under ( at least ) two different barycentric rational forms which depend on arbitrary parameters .",
    "such an approximant will be called a _ barycentric pad approximant _ ( in short bpa ) . according to the choice of these free parameters , pad ",
    "type approximants are also obtained under this form and we call them _ barycentric pad  type approximant _ ( in short bpta ) . then , we will show how to write a pad approximant under a partial fraction form , called a _ partial fraction pad approximant _ ( in short pfpa ) . the case of partial pad approximants @xcite , where some poles and/or zeros are imposed , could be treated similarly .",
    "let @xmath0 be a formal power series @xmath1 we consider the rational function @xmath2 if the @xmath3 s are arbitrarily chosen ( with @xmath4 ) , and if the @xmath5 s are computed by @xmath6 with the convention that @xmath7 for @xmath8 , then @xmath9 is the _ pad  type approximant _ of @xmath0 @xcite , it is denoted by @xmath10 , and it holds @xmath11 this _ accuracy  through  order condition _ means that the first @xmath12 coefficients of the power series expansion of @xmath10 in ascending powers of the variable @xmath13 match those of the series @xmath0 .    moreover , if the @xmath3 s are taken as the solution of the system @xmath14 with @xmath15 ( a rational function is defined up to a multiplying factor ) , then @xmath9 is the _ pad approximant _ of @xmath0 @xcite , it is denoted by @xmath16_f$ ] , and it holds @xmath17_f(t)-f(t)={\\cal o}(t^{p+q+1}).\\ ] ] thus , the first @xmath18 coefficients of the series expansion of @xmath16_f$ ] are identical to those of @xmath0",

    "in this section , we consider rational functions written under two different barycentric forms    @xmath23    or @xmath24 where the @xmath25 s , the @xmath26 s , the @xmath27 s , and the @xmath28 s are given points in the complex plane .",
    "we assume that all the @xmath25 s are distinct , and also all the @xmath26 s , all the @xmath27 s , and all the @xmath28 s .",
    "obviously , the forms and can be deduced one from each other by setting @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 , for all points different from zero . in the sequel , when it is not necessary to distinguish between the two forms and when it is possible to treat them simultaneously , any of them will be simply denoted by @xmath9 , and the parameters by @xmath5 , @xmath3 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 respectively .    in both cases ,",
    "we want to determine the coefficients @xmath5 and @xmath3 such that @xmath35 due to this property , and although @xmath9 is not always identical to the pad approximant @xmath16_f$ ] of the series @xmath0 as we will see below , such a rational function will be called a _ barycentric pad approximant _ and denoted bpa .    before explaining how to compute the coefficients of such an approximant , let us begin by some important remarks :    1 .",
    "it is easy to see that , for , the @xmath25 s are poles of @xmath36 and the @xmath26 s are zeros of it while , for , it is the @xmath37 s and the @xmath38 s which play these roles .",
    "therefore , if some poles and zeros of @xmath0 are known , they can be introduced into the construction of the approximant as in the case of partial pad approximants @xcite . for the form",
    ", we will assume that @xmath39 .",
    "the reason for this condition will be clearly seen in section [ s311 ] . if , in , some @xmath27 s and/or some @xmath28 s are zero the degree of the numerator and/or the degree of the denominator reduces accordingly .",
    "2 .   after reducing the sum in the numerator of to its common denominator and also the sum in the denominator ,",
    "@xmath36 becomes @xmath40 where @xmath41 is a polynomial of degree @xmath42 and @xmath43 a polynomial of degree @xmath44 .",
    "+ if @xmath45 , then @xmath36 has a numerator and a denominator both of degree @xmath18 at most .",
    "thus , the order of approximation of @xmath36 is one less than the order of approximation of the pad  type approximant with the same degrees @xcite .",
    "we will discuss below how to improve this order .",
    "the @xmath25 s and the @xmath26 s can be selected so that @xmath36 possesses other interesting properties such as , for example , the preservation of as many moments of @xmath0 as possible .",
    "however , they can not be chosen after the @xmath46 s and the @xmath47 s have been computed since , as we will see below , these coefficients depend on them .",
    "+ if some of the @xmath25 s coincide with some of the @xmath26 s , then a cancelation occurs and it lowers the degrees accordingly . if , when @xmath48 , @xmath49 for @xmath50 , the product in the denominator disappears and the product in the numerator reduces to @xmath51 .",
    "thus @xmath52 are zeros of @xmath36 . when @xmath53 and @xmath49 for @xmath54 , it is the product in the numerator which disappears and the product in the denominator reduces to @xmath55 .",
    "thus @xmath56 are poles of @xmath36 . +",
    "similar remarks hold for .",
    "3 .   in both cases , if @xmath57 and @xmath58 , then @xmath59 has a numerator and a denominator both of degree @xmath42 at most .",
    "thus , thanks to the condition , @xmath59 is the usual pad approximant @xmath60_f$ ] of @xmath0 , and it is such that @xmath61 . due to its uniqueness ,",
    "this approximant is , in theory , independent of the choice of the @xmath33 s .",
    "however , in practice , the choice of the @xmath33 s can influence the stability of the approximant , an important issue yet to be studied .",
    "+ barycentric pad approximants ( which , in this case , are true pad approximants ) with arbitrary degrees in the numerator and in the denominator can be constructed as follows .",
    "let us write @xmath0 as @xmath62 the approximant @xmath63 where @xmath64 is now the barycentric pad approximant of the series @xmath65 , satisfies @xmath66 thus it is identical to the pad approximant @xmath67_f$ ] independently of the choice of the @xmath33 s .",
    "similarly , write @xmath0 as @xmath68 the approximant @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the barycentric pad approximant of the series @xmath71 satisfies @xmath72 thus it is identical to the pad approximant @xmath73_f$ ] independently of the choice of the @xmath33 s .",
    "4 .   let us remind that if , in , @xmath58 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 , then @xmath76 independently of the choice of the @xmath77 @xcite .",
    "thus , the @xmath77 s can be chosen so that , in addition , @xmath78 matches the series @xmath0 as far as possible as proposed in @xcite .",
    "since the accuracy  through  order condition contains @xmath18 relations while @xmath9 has @xmath79 coefficients to be determined , an additional condition needs to be imposed .",
    "it is the so  called _ normalization condition_. because @xmath9 approximates @xmath0 around zero , its denominator should not vanish at this point .",
    "thus , since a rational function is determined apart a common multiplying factor in its numerator and its denominator , it is convenient to choose the normalization condition for and as @xmath80      for the form , having chosen the @xmath25 s and the @xmath26 s , the accuracy  through  order condition can be written @xmath81 but , we have @xmath82 , and a similar expansion for @xmath83 . thus , after replacement",
    ", the preceding relation becomes @xmath84    identifying the coefficients of the identical powers of @xmath13 in both sides , and taking into account the normalization condition leads to the system of equations for computing the coefficients @xmath85 and @xmath86 @xmath87    obviously , the sum on @xmath88 is empty for @xmath89 .",
    "thus , the coefficients of the series expansion of @xmath90 are given by @xmath91    in order to improve the order of approximation , it is possible , in theory , to choose the @xmath46 s , @xmath47 s , @xmath25 s and @xmath26 s such that they satisfy the system of nonlinear equations @xmath92 in which case we have @xmath93 since @xmath36 has a numerator and a denominator both of degree @xmath18 , it will be identical to the pad approximant @xmath94_f$ ] . obviously , in practice , the solution of this system is not an easy task .      for the form ,",
    "the condition is @xmath95 but , @xmath96 , and a similar expansion for @xmath97 .",
    "thus , after replacement , the preceding relation becomes @xmath98    identifying the coefficients of the identical powers of @xmath13 in both sides , and taking into account the normalization condition leads to the system of equations for determining the coefficients @xmath99 and @xmath100 @xmath101    again , the sum on @xmath88 is empty for @xmath89 .",
    "the coefficients of the series expansion of @xmath102 are given by @xmath103    the order of approximation of @xmath104 can be improved as explained for @xmath36 .",
    "consider again the rational functions and and assume now that the coefficients @xmath3 in their respective denominators are arbitrarily chosen .",
    "then , the coefficients of their numerators can be computed by solving the system    @xmath105    for , or the system for    @xmath106    in both cases , the rational function @xmath9 which is obtained satisfies @xmath107 and , thanks to this property , it is called a _ barycentric pad  type approximant _ ( see @xcite ) and denoted bpta .    similarly , a part of the numerator and/or a part of the denominator can be fixed thus leading to a _ barycentric partial pad ",
    "type approximant _ in the style of @xcite .",
    "the @xmath3 s could be chosen so that @xmath9 satisfies some additional properties as explained above .",
    "let us consider now the rational function @xmath108 it has a denominator of degree @xmath109 and a numerator of degree @xmath110 .",
    "we want to compute the @xmath5 s and the @xmath33 s such that this rational function be identical to the pad approximant @xmath111_f$ ] of the series @xmath0 .",
    "such an approximant will be called a _ partial fraction pad approximant _ and denoted pfpa .",
    "it can be obtained by a slight variation of a method due to the french mathematician and hydraulics engineer gaspard clair franois marie riche , baron de prony ( chamelet , 22 july 1755 - asnires  sur ",
    "seine , 29 july 1839 ) for interpolation by a sum of exponential functions @xcite .",
    "this method is used in signal analysis and recovery ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "applied to our case , this variant is as follows ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "we want to have @xmath112 which leads , by identification of the powers of @xmath13 on both sides , to @xmath113 the denominator of the rational function is @xmath114 where @xmath15 . let us first compute its coefficients . multiply the first equation in ( that is the equation for @xmath115 ) by @xmath116 , the second one ( that is corresponding to @xmath117 ) by @xmath118 , and so on up to the @xmath119th equation ( that is the equation for @xmath120 ) by @xmath121 , and sum them up .",
    "begin again the same process starting from the second equation in ( that is for @xmath117 ) which is multiplied by @xmath116 , multiply the third equation by @xmath118 , and so on up to the @xmath122th equation ( that is the equation for @xmath123 ) by @xmath121 , and sum them up .",
    "continue the process until all equations in have been used .",
    "we finally obtain @xmath124 which can be written as @xmath125 since @xmath15 , the other coefficients @xmath126 of the polynomial @xmath127 are solution of the linear system @xmath128 after solving this system , the zeros @xmath129 of @xmath127 can be computed ( for example , by the @xmath130 algorithm as the eigenvalues of the companion matrix of the coefficients of the polynomial @xmath127 ) and , finally , @xmath131 are obtained by solving the linear system consisting in the first @xmath109 equations in .",
    "notice that this system is singular if the @xmath33 s are not distinct and , in this case , @xmath111_f$ ] can not be written under the form but , possibly , under a partial fraction form involving powers in its denominator .",
    "this case arises if the denominator of @xmath111_f$ ] has multiple zeros .",
    "it is easy to see that the system is identical to the system when @xmath132 and @xmath133 , and after reversing the numbering of its coefficients .",
    "there exist several procedures for improving the numerical stability of prony s method @xcite , and it is even possible to avoid the computation of the coefficients of @xmath127 @xcite .",
    "let @xmath134 be the linear functional on the vector space of polynomials defined by @xmath135 then , the system can be written @xmath136 thus , @xmath127 is the polynomial of degree @xmath109 belonging to the family of _ formal orthogonal polynomials _ with respect to @xmath134 .",
    "such polynomials , introduced by wynn @xcite , play an important role in the algebraic and in the analytic theory of pad approximation @xcite . via formal orthogonal polynomials , pad approximants",
    "are also related to formal gaussian quadrature procedures @xcite .",
    "an interesting reference on the connection between these topics is @xcite .    obviously , if the @xmath33 s all distincts , then @xmath137 where @xmath138 is the numerator of @xmath111_f$ ] .    if the @xmath33 s are arbitrary distinct points and if the @xmath5 s are solution of the first @xmath109 equations in , then @xmath139 is only a pad  type approximant of @xmath0 .",
    "in this case , the @xmath33 s could be chosen so that @xmath139 satisfies some additional properties .",
    "partial fraction pad approximants can also be written as @xmath140 , and treated similarly .",
    "analogous forms can be derived for partial pad approximants @xcite .     with perturbed coefficients.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]     with perturbed coefficients.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]      let us now give some numerical examples showing the interest of the barycentric forms .",
    "both forms give similar results as expected .",
    "we consider the following function , and its series expansion @xmath141 this function has poles at odd multiples of @xmath142 , and zeros at odd multiples of @xmath143 , except at 0 .    with @xmath144 , @xmath145 and",
    "taking for the @xmath25 s @xmath146 and the for @xmath26 s @xmath147 , which are the five first poles and zeros of @xmath0 respectively , we obtain the results of figure [ ftan1 ] .    0.2 cm adding a uniformly distributed random perturbation between @xmath148 $ ] to the @xmath149 s leads to the results of figure [ ftan2 ] .",
    "for @xmath150 $ ] , the error of the true pad approximant is in the interval @xmath151 $ ] , and for the barycentric pad approximant computed either by the system ( form 1 ) of by the system ( form 2 ) it belongs to @xmath152 $ ] .",
    ".,scaledwidth=50.0% ]      we consider the series @xmath153 which converges in the unit disk and on the unit circle except at the point @xmath154 since there is a cut from @xmath154 to @xmath155 . for @xmath145 , the @xmath33 s equidistant in @xmath156 $ ] and the @xmath34 s equidistant in @xmath157 $ ] , we obtain the results of figure [ flog1 ] .",
    "the numerical results highly depend on these choices .",
    "this paper is an addition to the vast literature on pad approximation , and is only an introduction to these barycentric and partial fraction forms in order to show how to compute their coefficients .",
    "their main features are discussed and some numerical experiments show the interest of these new representations . however , the main problem which remains to be studied is the influence of the choice of the free parameters involved in their construction , a choice related to the important issues of their robustness @xcite and their stability @xcite .",
