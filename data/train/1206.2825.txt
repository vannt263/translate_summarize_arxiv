    "absorbing state phase transitions ( apt ) @xcite refer to a special class of non - equilibrium phase transitions which can occur in systems having absorbing configurations @xmath4 configurations from which the system can not escape dynamically .",
    "the most generic universality class of apt is the directed percolation ( dp ) @xcite class .",
    "several model systems , like reaction diffusion processes @xcite , depinning transitions @xcite , damage spreading @xcite , synchronization transition @xcite and certain probabilistic cellular automata @xcite are known to undergo apt belonging to this universality class .",
    "in fact the famous ` dp conjecture ' @xcite claims that any apt with a fluctuating scalar order parameter should generically belong to dp class .",
    "recently the dp critical behaviour has been verified experimentally in context of liquid crystals @xcite .",
    "apt in presence of a conserved field @xcite has drawn a lot of attention in the past decade .",
    "archetypical model of an apt with a conserved density field is the conserved lattice gas @xcite which shows a non - dp behaviour in 1-d @xcite . in general ,",
    "phase transitions in systems where activity is coupled to an additional conserved field are usually believed to belong to a universality class @xcite different from dp .",
    "however , there are several examples of systems belonging to dp irrespective of presence of a conserved field . of them , probably the most important is the conserved manna model @xcite .",
    "this model , though believed to show non - dp critical behaviour for a long time , has recently been claimed @xcite to belong to the dp class .",
    "sticky sand - piles @xcite are notable instances of dp behaviour in presence of conserved fields . in this context",
    "it is worth mentioning a different class of models , the so called threshold driven energy exchange models which also show @xcite apts different from dp where activity is coupled to a conserved energy field .    in this article",
    "we introduce a generalised energy exchange model where the energy does not respect local conservation ; dissipation @xmath0 and noise amplitude @xmath1 control the average energy of the system .",
    "the system shows an apt across a line of critical points @xmath5 which separates the active phase from the absorbing one in the @xmath0-@xmath1 plane .",
    "we show that the critical behaviour all along this critical line , including the special point @xmath6 where the dynamics is energy conserving , belongs to the directed percolation class .",
    "this claim that the conserved eem belongs to dp , contradicts some recent studies of related models @xcite .",
    "we argue that the apparent non - dp behaviour observed earlier is a consequence of unusually long transient effects arising due to the slow relaxation of the conserved background energy profile from random initial conditions ( ric ) .",
    "these ill effects are avoided here with the help of natural initial conditions @xcite .",
    "the natural initial condition is also advantageous in the non - conserved region @xmath7 where the long transients associated with ric still persist .",
    "however , as expected , these transient baheviour gradually disappears when dissipation is increased .",
    "the article is organised as follows . in the next section",
    "we define the model and study the critical point @xmath8 and critical exponents at a specific noise amplitude @xmath9 in the section [ sec : sigma1 ] . in section [ sec : phdiag ] we explore the entire phase diagram in the @xmath0-@xmath1 plane .",
    "section [ sec : cclf ] is devoted to the special case of conserved eem , where energy density plays the role of the control parameter .",
    "the model is defined on a periodic one dimensional lattice with @xmath10 sites labelled by @xmath11 ; each site @xmath12 containing a positive real variable @xmath13 called energy",
    ". a _ pair _ of neighbouring sites is called active when at least one of the sites have energy larger than or equal to a predefined threshold @xmath14 .",
    "otherwise , @xmath4 when both these sites have energy less than @xmath14 , the _ pair _ is called _",
    "inactive_. the energies of an active pair ( @xmath15 ) evolve following a random sequential update rule , e_pair e_pair&= & e_pair +  ; e_i r e_pair &  ,  & e_i+1 ( 1- r)e_pair , [ eq : noncon_dynamics ] where the sum of the energies @xmath16 is subjected to dissipation and noise , and @xmath17 is a uniform random number .",
    "the parameter @xmath18 causes dissipation of the total energy . with an added random noise @xmath19 chosen here from a uniform distribution in the range @xmath20",
    "the system mimics a dissipative particle system under the stochastic force @xcite or the kinetic wealth exchange models of fluctuating markets @xcite .",
    "thus , like a canonical system in the influence of a langevin bath , the average energy density is expected to be controlled by the parameters @xmath0 and @xmath21    the interesting feature of this dynamics is that it allows the possibility of an absorbing state phase transition .",
    "a configuration where all the sites have @xmath22 @xmath4 none of the pairs are active , is an absorbing configuration of this system .",
    "clearly , this system has infinitely many possible absorbing configurations .",
    "if the average energy density @xmath23 is much less than the threshold @xmath24 the system is likely to fall in such a configuration . on the other hand for very large @xmath25",
    "the system remains active .",
    "the energy density @xmath25 is a non - decreasing function of both the dissipation @xmath0 and the noise amplitude @xmath21 thus , for any given @xmath26 the average energy @xmath25 decreases as the amplitude @xmath1 is decreased and one can expect an absorbing state phase transition at some critical value @xmath27 for @xmath28 a thermodynamically large system reaches a steady state where number of active pairs in the system remains finite and for @xmath29 activity certainly dies out .",
    "alternatively , one can study this transition by keeping @xmath1 fixed and varying the dissipation factor @xmath0 - in that case the transition occurs at a critical value @xmath30    the critical curve @xmath31 separates the active phase from the absorbing one in the @xmath0-@xmath1 plane . in a later section",
    "we will study this phase diagram . in the following",
    "we first study the critical behaviour of this system for a fixed noise amplitude , @xmath32 in some details .",
    "we shall find the critical point @xmath8 and a set of the critical exponents using monte carlo simulations .",
    "since the dynamics is invariant under the transformation @xmath33 we will work with @xmath34 without any loss of generality .",
    "the phase transition in this energy exchange model is characterized by the average density of active pairs @xmath35 where @xmath36 or @xmath37 depending on whether the _ pair _ @xmath38 is active or inactive . in the long time limit @xmath39 saturates to a steady value , which is non zero only in the active phase ; @xmath40 serves as the order parameter of this transition .    in this section",
    "we use monte carlo simulations to study the absorbing transition of the eem .",
    "first let us expolore the critical point @xmath8 and exponents for a fixed value of noise amplitude @xmath41    _ critical point and @xmath42 : _ at the critical point @xmath43 starting from a random initial condition , the activity density decays as a power law _",

    "@xmath40 , the average density of `` sites having @xmath181 '' was used as order parameter .",
    "this order parameter @xmath182 , where @xmath183 when @xmath184 or otherwise @xmath185 is related to @xmath40 as _ a= + s_i ( 1-s_i+1 ) . since @xmath40 is non - zero only when @xmath186 and they are dimensionally identical , the critical point and corresponding exponents would be same in both cases .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied absorbing phase transition in the energy exchange models in one spatial dimension . the dynamics of this model",
    "is controlled by two parameters - a noise of amplitude @xmath1 and a dissipation factor @xmath187 the absorbing and active phases are separated by a critical line in the @xmath0-@xmath1 plane . with extensive monte carlo simulations",
    "we show that the critical behaviour of the energy exchange model belongs to directed percolation along the entire critical line .",
    "the critical line ends at the point @xmath133 , where the dynamics is energy conserving .",
    "the numerical study of the critical behaviour suffers from long transients and unusual decay profiles when this conserved limit is approached .",
    "we show that this effect can be removed if one uses suitably prepared natural initial conditions .",
    "the conserved eem @xmath133 is special in a way that the conserved energy itself serves as the tuning parameter .",
    "this conserved version also suffers from the presence of long transients making it numerically hard to study the system using random initial conditions . here again one can take advantage of the natural initial conditions which reaches the stationary state within a reasonably shorter time .",
    "we find that the critical behaviour of the conserved eem also belongs to dp .",
    "we also revisit the minimal energy exchange model ( a variant of conserved eem ) , and find that this model too shows dp critical behaviour .",
    "the apparent non - dp exponents found earlier @xcite are possibly due to the undershooting present in the decay of activity from the random initial conditions .    with this study",
    "we want to emphasize the fact that one has to be very careful in exploring absorbing phase transition in presence of a conserved field .",
    "the conserved field imposes additional constraints on the evolution of the system and introduces a long time scale .",
    "random initial conditions may need very long time to saturate , producing unwanted transient effects like undershooting .",
    "these undesirable features may lead to erroneous estimation of critical point and hence inaccurate critical exponents .",
    "one must take care of these ill effects while studying apt in a system with a conserved field .",
