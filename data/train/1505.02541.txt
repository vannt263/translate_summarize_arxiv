    "a general hamiltonian system may have two different kinds of constants of motion ( first integrals ) ; usual ones are caused by symmetries of the hamiltonian , while the others , so - called _ casimir invariants _ , are independent of a specific choice of hamiltonian , but are pertinent to the underlying poisson algebra@xcite .",
    "a casimir invariant @xmath0 is a function ( observable ) such that @xmath1 for every @xmath2 ( here @xmath3 denotes the poisson bracket of a hamiltonian system ) , i.e. , @xmath0 belongs to the center of the poisson algebra .",
    "the existence of a nontrivial casimir invariant ( @xmath4 constant ) is the determining characteristics of a _ noncanonical _ hamiltonian system ( or , a degenerate poisson algebra ) .",
    "conversely , a canonical hamiltonian system does not have a casimir invariant ; all constants of motion are of the first kind .",
    "interestingly , we may often convert a noncanonical system into a canonical system .",
    "then , what will become of casimir invariants ? here",
    "we put the method of _ clebsch parameterization _ into the perspective .",
    "the noncanonical hamiltonian system to be examined is that of the ideal magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd)@xcite . a hamiltonian formulation of fluid / plasma mechanics is generally noncanonical when it is described by eulerian variables , and has two kinds of casimir invariants@xcite ; one is the total mass , and the others are helicities . by representing the the vector fields ( fluid velocity and magnetic field ) in terms of clebsch parameters , we can rewrite the evolution equation as a canonical hamiltonian system , and provide it with an action principle @xcite .",
    "the aim of this work is to elucidate how the original casimir invariants translate in the canonized system",
    ". we will show that they become the first - kind constants of motion corresponding to the gauge symmetries of the clebsch parameterization@xcite .",
    "the gauge transformation also conserves the action integral ; hence the constants of motion are _ noether charges _ ,",
    "i.e. , the casimir invariants translate as the noether charges corresponding to the gauge symmetry of clebsch parameterization .",
    "we organize this paper as follows : in section[sec : formulation ] , we start by reviewing the standard noncanonical hamiltonian formulation of mhd ( subsection[subsec : noncanonical ] ) and its canonization by clebsch parameterization ( subsection[subsec : canonical ] ) . in section[sec : symmetry ] , we elucidate the symmetry of the canonized system . the hamiltonian flow generated by",
    "the original casimir invariant defines a symmetry group ( subsection[subsec : symmtry_group ] ) ; the symmetry turns out to be the gauge symmetry ( redundancy ) of the clebsch parameterization ( subsection[sebsec : gauge_group ] ) , which yields a noether charge that reproduces the original casimir invariant ( subsection[subsec : noether ] ) . in subsection[subsec : generalization ] , we derive an extended set of constants of motion by studying a generalized class of symmetries .",
    "section [ sec : conclusion ] concludes this work with a remark on the lagrangian formalism and the relabeling symmetry .",
    "the mhd system is described by @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the density , @xmath7 is the velocity , @xmath8 is the magnetic field , and @xmath9 is the specific enthalpy .",
    "all variables are normalized by the alfvn unit , i.e. , the energy densities ( thermal @xmath9 , kinetic @xmath10 and magnetic @xmath11 ) are normalized by the representative magnetic energy density @xmath12 ( @xmath13 is the vacuum permeability ) . here",
    "assume a barotropic relation @xmath14 .",
    "we consider a smoothly bounded , simply connected domain @xmath15 .",
    "we assume @xmath16 on the boundary @xmath17 ( @xmath18 is the normal unit vector onto @xmath17 ) .",

    "there are three casimir invariants ( hence , the mhd system is noncanonical ) : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the vector potential ( @xmath34 is the inverse operator of @xmath35 , which is a self - adjoint operator ; see@xcite ) ; @xmath36 is the total mass , @xmath37 is the magnetic helicity , and @xmath38 is the cross helicity .",
    "we can canonize the mhd system by parameterizing the vector fields @xmath7 and @xmath8 in terms of clebsch parameters . here",
    "we invoke a generalized form of clebsch parameterization such that @xmath39 when @xmath40 is chosen to be the dimension of base space ( here , @xmath41 ) , ( [ clebsch ] ) gives a complete representation of general @xmath42 by @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 that satisfy appropriate boundary condition independently@xcite . from now on , the contraction rule on the indexes will be used to abbreviate notation .",
    "the formulation of clebsch - parameterized mhd will be introduced @xcite . here",
    "we put @xmath46 the index @xmath47 runs over @xmath48 .    at @xmath17 , we assume the following boundary conditions for the clebsch parameters : @xmath49 where @xmath50s are constant numbers , which are consistent to the boundary conditions ( [ bc - v ] ) and ( [ bc - b ] ) on the physical variables . denoting @xmath51 we define @xmath52 hamilton s equation reads as a canonical system @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "we have a lagrangian ( represented by the clebsch fields ) @xmath56 by which the action is written as ( denoting @xmath57 ) @xmath58 where @xmath59 is a space - time domain @xmath60 .",
    "the invariants , @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are no longer `` casimir invariants '' in the canonized system , while they must be still constants of motion .",
    "delineation of how they are conserved in the canonized formalism is the aim of the next section .",
    "let @xmath61 denotes the canonical bracket . given a hamiltonian @xmath2 ,",
    "a constant of motion is a functional @xmath0 such that @xmath62 an infinitesimal transformation ( flow ) generated by a virtual hamiltonian @xmath63 is given by ( with small @xmath64 ) @xmath65 if @xmath63 and the actual hamiltonian @xmath2 commute , i.e. , if @xmath63 is a constant of motion , @xmath66 defines a _ symmetry group _ : ( [ conservation law ] ) implies @xmath67 to simplify the notation , we will omit @xmath64 in writing perturbations @xmath68 .",
    "the symmetry groups generated by the `` original casimir invariants '' are @xmath69 where @xmath70 .      here",
    "we show that the symmetry groups ( [ total_mass_to_symmetry])-([cross_helicity_to_symmetry ] ) , generated by the original casimir invariants , are gauge transformations of the clebsch parameterization , i.e. , the physical variables @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are unchanged by the action of the group .    under the transformation ( [ total_mass_to_symmetry ] )",
    ", it is evident that @xmath71 and @xmath72 , because @xmath6 and @xmath8 are independent of @xmath73 .",

    "@xmath71 and @xmath72 are obvious , because @xmath6 and @xmath8 do not depend on @xmath73 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "we also find that @xmath77 vanishes : @xmath78    under ( [ cross_helicity_to_symmetry ] ) , @xmath71 is evident . @xmath77 and",
    "@xmath79 are calculated as follows : @xmath80      to show that @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are noether charges of the canonized system , we have yet to prove that the gauge transformations ( the symmetry groups ) conserve the action .",
    "the lagrangian density @xmath81 consists of two parts ; the canonical 1-form and @xmath82 . because the transformations ( [ total_mass_to_symmetry])-([cross_helicity_to_symmetry ] ) are the gauge transformations , it is obvious that @xmath82 is unchanged . on the other hand ,",
    "the canonical 1-form may be changed by a gauge transformation .",
    "however , the change is an exact differential , thus the action integral is changed only by a constant .",
    "in fact , an arbitrary hamiltonian flow @xmath83 ( generated by a virtual hamiltonian @xmath63 ) conserves the canonical 1-form .",
    "let us denote @xmath84 .",
    "for @xmath85 and @xmath86 , we observe @xmath87 and @xmath88 which implies that @xmath89 is the exact differential .",
    "explicitly , the action of ( [ magnetic_helicity_to_symmetry ] ) yields @xmath90 thus @xmath91 is an exact differential .",
    "similarly , by the action of ( [ cross_helicity_to_symmetry ] ) , we obtain @xmath92 where @xmath93 .",
    "let us briefly review how a noether charge is derived by an action - invariant transformation .",
    "we consider a first - order lagrangian such that @xmath94 , which yields the euler - lagrange equation @xmath95 .",
    "suppose that @xmath96 has a symmetry : @xmath97 ( with some vector @xmath98 ) under a transformation @xmath99 .",
    "for a solution @xmath100 of the euler - lagrange equation , we obtain @xmath101 for a perturbation @xmath102 of a symmetry group , we may write @xmath103 where @xmath104 is a noether current , and @xmath105 is the corresponding noether charge .",
    "applying this procedure to the canonized mhd lagrangian and the gauge symmetries , we obtain @xmath106 the third noether charge ( [ symmetry_to_cross_helicity ] ) is equal to the cross helicity @xmath38 ; using the boundary condition of @xmath8 , @xmath107    a transformation conserving a lagrangian maps a solution of the equation of motion to another solution .",
    "however , the converse is not necessarily true in fact , there is a gauge transformation of the clebsch parameterization which does not conserve the action .",
    "let @xmath108 , @xmath109 , and @xmath110 .",
    "these perturbations yield a gauge transformation : @xmath111 it is also obvious that @xmath8 and @xmath6 are unchanged",
    ". however , we obtain @xmath112 which is not an exact differential .    we have elucidated a beautiful relation , mediated by the constants @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 , between the eulerian noncanonical formalism and the clebsch - parameterized canonical formalism ; in the former , the constants are the casimir invariants that foliate the phase space , and in the latter , they are the noether charges that identify symmetry groups reflecting the redundancy of the clebsch parameterization ( see fig.[fig1 ] ) .    ) and the casimir leaves ( level - sets of @xmath0 ) .",
    "right : by the clebsch parameterization , the system is embedded in a larger phase space with redundant degree of freedom ; the hamiltonian group action generated by the noether charges delineates the symmetry built in the clebsch parameterization.,height=283 ]      the clebsch parameterization enables us to discribe local conservation of mass and helicity .",
    "we define two sets of functions @xmath113 and @xmath114 such that @xmath115 from ( [ equation_of_motion ] ) , @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "we easily verify @xmath118 when @xmath119 , @xmath120 is a constant of motion . from ( [ rule3 ] ) , @xmath121 and using ( [ rule2 ] ) and ( [ rule4 ] ) , @xmath122 ; hence we find a new constant of motion @xmath123 ( @xmath124 is an arbitrary smooth function ) . from ( [ rule4 ] ) and ( [ rule5]),@xmath125 . using ( [ rule1 ] ) , and summing up the terms such that @xmath126 and @xmath127",
    ", we obtain @xmath128 . from ( [ rule4 ] ) , @xmath129 ,",
    "thus @xmath130 is a constant of motion .",
    "since @xmath131 is a scalar function that is constant along the streamlines of the flow @xmath7 , we may regard it as a weighting function co - moving with the plasma .",
    "choosing @xmath132 to be a support function on a co - moving volume element , @xmath123 and @xmath130 measure local mass and helicity contained in the volume element .",
    "these generalized constants of motion are related to the following gauge symmetries : @xmath133 where @xmath134 denotes the derivative of @xmath124 with respect to @xmath135 , and @xmath136 the one with respect to @xmath137 .",
    "for example , @xmath77 under the transformation ( [ generalized_mass_and_symmetry_mhd ] ) is @xmath138 and @xmath71 and @xmath72 are obvious , thus ( [ generalized_mass_and_symmetry_mhd ] ) is a gauge transformation .",
    "we have shown , in the context of mhd , that casimir invariants of a noncanonical hamiltonian system are converted , upon canonization by an alternative parameterization ( here , clebsch parameterization ) of the state vector , into noether charges pertinent to the gauge freedom ( redundancy ) of the new parameterization . while the conclusion delineates a simple relation between different formalisms of dynamical systems , the specific forms of the symmetries , embodying the concrete relation , are rather complicated .",
    "since the clebsch parameterization implies a nonlinear variable transformation , the symmetries are not apparent ( excepting some simple ones ; cf .",
    "@xcite ) . emphasizing another aspect of the problem , we may say that we could unearth , guided by the known casimir invariants , the general gauge symmetries of the clebsch parameterization .",
    "there are some different methods of canonization .",
    "a well - known method that applies for various fluid - mechanical systems is the usage of lagrangian variables to represent the dynamics of fluid elements ; the lagrangian variables label the initial position of each fluid element . formulating an action by a lagrangian of newtonian - mechanical continuum",
    ", we obtain a canonical systems of hamilton s equation of motion@xcite ; see @xcite for the original formulation of the lagrangian action principle of mhd . in the canonized system of lagrangian variables , the casimir invariants are translated differently .",
    "the total mass @xmath139 and the magnetic helicity @xmath140 are now trivially conserved , because they are the integrals of the _ attributes _ of fluid elements ; the local density and magnetic helicity are not dynamical variables , but are _ constants _ bound to each fluid element ( like charges of particles in particle systems ) . only the cross helicity @xmath141 is a nontrivial first integral ; it is now the noether charge pertaining to the _ relabeling symmetry _ that represents the arbitrariness of providing fluid elements with lagrangian labels@xcite .",
    "since clebsch parameters may be viewed as the eulerian counterparts of lagrangian labels ( or , the pull - back along the cauchy characteristics of the fluid velocity @xmath7 ; see @xcite ) , it is natural that the gauge symmetry of the clebsch parameters ( present canonization ) and the relabeling symmetry of the lagrangian labels ( lagrangian canonization ) yield the same constant of motion .",
