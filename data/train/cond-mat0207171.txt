    "we find that @xmath144 leads to a large exchange of particles .",
    "for this purpose we consider the situation depicted in figure 3 ( b ) corresponding to two @xmath65 vortex solitons of @xmath80 each which are set at @xmath156 at time @xmath137 with a phase difference of @xmath144 according to ( [ xxx ] ) .",
    "the profiles of the system at times @xmath157 300 and 400 are shown in figures 5 ( a ) , ( b ) , ( c ) , ( d ) and ( e ) , respectively . due to exchange of particles",
    "the left soliton gradually becomes larger and larger consistent with figure 4 . at @xmath150",
    "the solitons come closer , interact strongly by exchanging atoms and become wider and deformed . then they gradually move apart and become narrower .",
    "finally , at @xmath153 they re - acquire gaussian shapes .",
    "however , at @xmath153 the right soliton is wider and shorter and accommodates a smaller number of atoms consistent with figures 3 ( b ) and 4 . at that stage",
    "the left soliton is narrower and taller and contains a larger fraction of the atoms .",
    "the interaction between more than two solitons with a general phase @xmath2 among different pairs is much too complicated to be studied exhaustively here .",
    "if the phase difference @xmath83 between two neighboring solitons is not close to zero , they experience overall repulsion and stay apart .",
    "however , for @xmath83 close to zero they interact attractively and often a soliton could be lost as observed in the experiment of strecker _ et al .",
    "this is illustrated in figure 6 where we consider three solitons all with same phase ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "due to attraction the three solitons come closer , interact and form two solitons which after some time form a single soliton .",
    "this single soliton next decays to two , recombines to one , and decays to two again and never three original solitons are recovered .",
    "it is also possible that for some values of nonlinearity @xmath36 and initial separation @xmath158 two solitons with relative phase @xmath132 may coalesce to form a single soliton without ever decaying to two solitons again .",
    "these could explain a missing soliton observed in the experiment by strecker _",
    "_ @xcite .    throughout this investigation in the interaction of two equal solitons we assumed that the nonlinearity @xmath159 for each is less than @xmath160 , so that a stable solitonic condensate with total @xmath161 exists when the two coalesce . however , if two solitons each with @xmath162 encounter for @xmath91 , the system is expected to coalesce , collapse and emit atoms via three - body recombination @xcite .",
    "it is possible that in this case only a smaller single soliton survives .",
    "this might also explain some missing soliton(s ) in experiment .    in the investigation by al khawaja _",
    "@xcite , to justify the repulsion between solitons in a train @xcite a phase difference of @xmath92 was suggested between neighbors .",
    "they made a model for the evolution of @xmath2 along the axial direction which they used for explaining the formation of a soliton train , with neighboring solitons of phase difference @xmath114 , after changing the scattering length from repulsive to attractive in a bec as in the experiment @xcite .",
    "such an order in phase seems to be not necessary for an overall repulsion between solitons .",
    "almost any @xmath83 , except @xmath83 near 0 , is found to lead to overall repulsion . in reference",
    "@xcite , using an approximate analysis , it has been found that repulsive interactions require @xmath163 . in the present three - dimensional analysis",
    ", we find that attraction starts at @xmath122 and increases as @xmath2 is reduced .",
    "however , the overall interaction remains repulsive until a small value of @xmath83 close to zero is attained , when the solitons attract , lose their separate identity and coalesce .",
    "to conclude , employing numerical solution of the gp equation with axial symmetry , we have performed a realistic mean - field study of interaction among two vortex solitons in a train and find the overall interaction to be repulsive except for phase @xmath2 between neighbors close to 0 . for phase @xmath79 between neighboring solitons in a train , they are found to repel and move away without exchanging atoms for both normal ( @xmath63 ) and vortex ( @xmath65 ) solitons . for phase @xmath91 in a two - soliton train ,",
    "the solitons attract , collide , coalesce , and eventually come out . for other @xmath83",
    ", overall repulsion prevails .",
    "however , there is an inelastic exchange of atoms between two solitons resulting in a change of size and shape .",
    "these unequal solitons travel in general with different speeds : the smaller soliton travels faster and the larger soliton travels slower .",
    "the unequal speed leads to an asymmetry in final positions of the solitons . by changing the sign of the phase between the two solitons",
    "the asymmetry in the final size and shape of the two solitons can be reversed . except in the @xmath139 case ,",
    "the solitons in a train stay apart and never cross each other as observed in the experiment by strecker _",
    "_ @xcite . for",
    "@xmath139 a single soliton can often disappear as a result of the attractive interaction among solitons , as observed experimentally by strecker _",
    "these features of soliton interaction are present for both normal ( @xmath63 ) @xcite vortex ( @xmath65 ) solitons .",
    "although the present study is performed in the absence of an axial trap as in one dimension @xcite , these general conclusions should remain valid for a weak axial trap as in the experiments @xcite .",
    "the @xmath65 vortex solitons can accommodate larger number of atoms and the present study may motivate future experiments with them .",
