    "biological membranes are made of lipid bilayers with incorporated proteins .",
    "these barriers define the inside and the outside of a cell , separate the functional compartments in cells , and are indispensable for life @xcite .",
    "the microscopic surface tension of membranes is usually small or vanishes altogether @xcite , but there may also be situations , where membranes are under considerable stress due to osmotic pressure differences .",
    "for example , epithelial cells exposed to transmembrane osmotic gradients can be expected to develop a state of tension under physiological conditions @xcite .",
    "similarly , osmotically induced tension may play a decisive role during conformational changes , fission or fusion of cells @xcite .",
    "another situation where membranes experience stress is under the influence of ultrasonic pulses @xcite . applied perpendicular to a lipid membrane , shock pulses can promote significant structural changes similar to those induced by lateral tension .",
    "the effect of such pulses on membranes is of considerable medical interest . in this context koshiyama _",
    "et al . _ have studied phospholipid bilayers under the action of a shock wave in atomistic molecular dynamics simulations @xcite .    despite the advances in computer technology throughout the past decades , atomistic modeling of lipid bilayers on length scales of a few",
    "nanometer still requires huge computing resources or even goes beyond the current capabilities of high performance architectures .",
    "this motivates the use of coarse - grained models",
    ". they can give fundamental insights into the physics of a certain system , and , moreover , they provide powerful tools for the interpretation of the behavior of complex systems , like lipid membranes @xcite .",
    "the aim of the work presented here is to study the effect of an externally applied tension on the physical properties of a model bilayer , and on the behavior of incorporated model proteins .",
    "we employ a generic coarse - grained model of amphiphiles developed in a top - down approach@xcite . for tensionless systems",
    "this model has already been used very successfully to reproduce various bilayer phases including the symmetric and asymmetric `` rippled '' @xmath2 states @xcite and to study membrane - protein interactions @xcite .",
    "recent simulations on membranes under mechanical stress have often dealt with the formation , structure and stability of hydrophilic pores @xcite or with the influence of surface tension on transmembrane channel stability and function @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we will primarily be concerned with the structural changes of pure membranes in response to lateral stresses , focussing on unporated systems .",
    "since our model exhibits a rather realistic phase behavior of the model membrane at different temperatures , we can study different membrane states , _",
    "i.e. _ , the liquid , the ripple , and the gel state    our paper is organized as follows : first we describe the underlying lipid model and outline the simulation methods .",
    "then the simulation results are presented starting with a phenomenological introduction , where the effects of an external tension on the model bilayer in different phases are described .",
    "thereafter a quantitative analysis of these bilayers is performed and the characteristics of the bilayers are examined with respect to their behavior under external tension . in the last part",
    "we show the influence of tension on the effective interaction potential of two simple model proteins .",
    "a brief summary concludes our paper .",
    "in our model @xcite the lipid molecules are represented by chains made of one head bead and six tail beads , and we have additional solvent beads .",
    "hence we have three types of beads , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 for head , tail , and solvent beads . within the lipid chains , neighbor beads at a distance",
    "@xmath5 interact _ via _ a finite extensible non - linear elastic ( fene ) potential @xmath6 with the spring constant @xmath7 , the equilibrium bond length @xmath8 , and the cutoff @xmath9 .",
    "the angles @xmath10 between subsequent bonds in the lipid are subject to a stiffness potential @xmath11 with the stiffness parameter @xmath12",
    ". beads of type @xmath13 and @xmath14 which are not direct next neighbors in a chain interact _ via _ a truncated and shifted lennard - jones potential , @xmath15 the offset @xmath16 is chosen such that @xmath17 is continuous at the cutoff @xmath18 .",
    "the parameter @xmath19 is the arithmetic mean of the diameters @xmath20 of the interaction partners , and @xmath21 for all partners @xmath22 except @xmath23 and @xmath24 : @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "hence tail beads attract one another , all other interactions are repulsive , and solvent beads do not interact at all with each other . this way of modeling the solvent environment ( the so - called phantom solvent ) @xcite combines the advantages of explicit and implicit solvent models : like implicit solvent models , the solvent environment does not develop any artificial internal structure , and it is very cheap ( in monte - carlo or brownian dynamics simulations , less than 10 % of the total computing time is spent on the solvent beads ) .",
    "like explicit solvent models , the model can be used to study solvent - mediated phenomena such as the effect of hydrodynamic interactions on membrane dynamics .",
    "this is much more difficult with solvent - free models .",
    "we should note , however , that we mainly consider static membrane properties in the present work , using monte - carlo simulations .",
    "we use the model parameters @xcite @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 . at the pressure @xmath32 , the model reproduces the main phases of phospholipids , _",
    "i.e. _ , a high - temperature fluid @xmath33 phase at temperature @xmath34 and a low - temperature tilted gel ( @xmath0 ) with an intermediate modulated ripple ( @xmath2 ) phase @xcite .",
    "the energy and length scales can be mapped to si - units @xcite by matching the bilayer thickness or , alternatively , the area per lipid and the temperature of the main transition to those of dppc , giving @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "the elastic properties of the membranes in the fluid state were then also found to be comparable to those of dppc membranes @xcite .    unless stated otherwise , the systems were studied by monte - carlo simulations at constant normal pressure @xmath37 and constant temperature @xmath38 with periodic boundary conditions in a simulation box of variable shape and size .",
    "we put the tension into effect by an additional energy term @xmath39 to the hamiltonian of the system , where @xmath40 is the projected area of the bilayer onto the @xmath41 plane .",
    "this alters the lateral components of the pressure tensor within the membrane .",
    "the non - interacting solvent particles , which probe the free volume and force the lipids to self - assemble , are not affected by this additional energy contribution .",
    "they ensure that the normal pressure @xmath42 is kept fixed at the required value .",
    "thus , we are performing monte - carlo simulations in an @xmath43 ensemble with effective hamiltonian @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the interaction energy , @xmath46 the volume of the simulation box , @xmath47 an arbitrary reference volume and @xmath48 the total number of beads .",
    "in contrast to the experimental situation , where the lateral pressure of a lipid bilayer can not be controlled very easily @xcite , our implementation of the tension is straightforward . since we are in full control of the lateral pressure , we can gain insight into states and structures of lipid bilayers by means of computer simulations , which are difficult to investigate in experimental setups .    in practice ,",
    "two main types of monte - carlo moves were proposed and then accepted or rejected according to a metropolis criterion , namely 1 ) translational local moves of the beads , and 2 ) global moves which change the volume of the simulation box or its shape @xcite . during one monte - carlo step ( @xmath49 )",
    "there is on average one attempt to move each bead .",
    "since the global moves require rescaling of all particle coordinates , which is rather expensive from a computational point of view , they are performed only every 50th @xmath49 on average .",
    "the volume and shear moves are necessary to maintain the desired surface tension .",
    "an advantage of our scheme is that the correct area per lipid required by the external tension is adopted by construction .",
    "there is no need for searching the required state by testing various values of fixed area per lipid .",
    "we also implemented flip - flop moves with an inversion of the end - to - end vector of a complete lipid chain in its last tail bead , but found the acceptance rate of this molecular move due to the density of the bilayer far too small .    in some cases it turned out to be more convenient to keep the box height @xmath50 fixed and vary only the planar extension given by @xmath51 and @xmath52 . in this case , the number of phantom solvent particles was allowed to fluctuate , _",
    "i.e. _ , additional monte - carlo moves were attempted where solvent particles were removed from the system or randomly inserted ( semi - grand canonical simulations ) .",
    "the solvent chemical potential was set to @xmath53 now , the semi - grand canonical hamiltonian reads @xmath54\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath55 is the momentary number of solvent particles in the system .    when the system sizes were very large ( sec .",
    "[ sec : fluctuations ] ) , the simulations were carried out on parallel processors using a domain decomposition scheme described in ref .  , which ensures that every monte - carlo move fulfills detailed balance exactly ( in most other decomposition schemes proposed in the literature , detailed balance is violated at the boundaries between the domains ) .",
    "we have checked by comparison with single - processor simulations that the results were not affected by the parallelization .    in this paper",
    "the results presented in section  [ sec : pmf ] were obtained using the semi - grand canonical solvent model , and the diffusivity measurements ( sec .",
    "[ sec : diffusivity ] ) in the @xmath56-ensemble ( in the latter case , only local bead translations were attempted and all simulations were run on a single processor ) .",
    "the other simulations used the @xmath57-ensemble or .",
    "the simulations of stressed membranes were carried out for a duration of at least @xmath58 , and we checked that the observed quantities did not show any tendency for drift .",
    "in particular , we have examined in detail the long - wavelength undulations of the membranes , which are presumably the slowest relaxation modes in the system .",
    "after an equilibration time of @xmath59 the results from two successive runs of length @xmath60 were identical within the error .",
    "hence the analyzed systems can be assumed to be in a stable state .",
    "we have applied tensions of up to @xmath61 , corresponding to @xmath62 , which is close to the threshold for rupture in the fluid phase in our model : the membranes remained stable up to temperatures @xmath63 , but ruptured at @xmath64 ( see fig .",

    "after this qualitative overview , we turn to a more quantitative analysis of the behavior of bilayers under tension .",
    "we first consider the area per lipid , which is obtained by dividing the projected area of the bilayer in the @xmath41 plane by half the number of lipids in the system .",
    "we note that the difference between the number of lipids in the upper and the lower monolayer was always very small .",

    "we do not observe any dependence of the area per lipid on the system size .",
    "for the temperature @xmath79 , we have compared data from four different system sizes , ranging from @xmath80 lipids to @xmath81 lipids ; the results were identical within the statistical error ( ) .",

    "the extensibility of the bilayer in the gel phase is significantly smaller than in the fluid phase , and constant over the whole range of tensions under investigation .",

    "the local distribution of the pressure along the bilayer normal was obtained by dividing the system into 50 vertical slabs and distributing the pressure contributions onto these slabs according to the convention of irving and kirkwood @xcite .",

    "pressure or stress profiles have been reported in various other studies @xcite for both mesoscopic and atomistic simulations .",
    "we will briefly summarize the characteristic features of the total stress profiles and analyze their change under tension in our model .",
    "the behavior of the pressure profiles can be attributed to different interactions :    the first positive peak ( insets in figures  [ fig : t1p1_10x10_g0 - 2-contr ] and [ fig : t1p3_10x10_g0 - 2-contr ] ) arises due to the purely repulsive interactions of the head and the solvent beads . here a zone depleted from ( solvent ) beads is formed and the head beads are effectively squeezed together in the lateral direction .",
    "the first negative peak in the head region indicates that the head - head interactions are purely repulsive , pushing the system laterally apart in this section of the bilayer .",
    "the second positive peak , located in the tail region , results from the interplay of the attractive lennard - jones interaction between the tail beads and the contribution of bond - angle and bond - length potentials .",
    "interestingly , the contribution of the ( attractive ) lennard - jones ( lj ) interactions between tail beads is negative : the net attraction between tail beads is stronger in the normal direction than in the lateral direction .",
    "this is compensated and outbalanced by the contributions of the bending of the lipid segments and the stretching of bonds , which lead to positive tension in total .",
    "thus the stress in the hydrophobic portion of the membrane is mostly sustained by intrachain interactions and not , as one might expect , by the attractive lennard - jones interactions .",
    "the negative peak in the midplane of the bilayer originates from the absence of intrachain interactions in this region , thus the effect of the lennard - jones interactions takes over and the monolayers are effectively glued to each other .    under the influence of an external tension",
    ", we observe a narrowing and shift of the whole profiles , in qualitative agreement with previous atomistic simulations by gullingsrud and schulten @xcite . in the gel phase , which is already exposed to very high internal stress ,",
    "the relative effect of the external tension is small .",
    "the inspection of the different contributions to the local pressure shows that the external tension leads to a decrease both of the lennard - jones ( lj ) contribution and the bond length ( bl ) contribution .",
    "the reduction of the lj - contribution is higher , leading to the observed shift .",
    "due to the stiffness of the lipids in the gel phase , the bond - angle contribution to the pressure profiles remains practically unaltered .",
    "the change in the overall structure of the pressure profiles is also only small .",
    "the slight change in membrane thickness results in a shift of the outer peaks of the profiles towards the midplane ( @xmath116 ) .",
    "the effect of external tension is considerably more dramatic in the fluid phase at @xmath63 .",
    "although the absolute peak values of the pressure profiles are reduced by a factor of about 8 to 10 , the relative shifts are much more pronounced .",
    "first , the shift of the outermost peaks towards the midplane is much higher , due to the fact that the membrane thickness decreases more strongly under tension in this phase .",

    "the same type of argument can be applied to the model of brannigan and brown , where the membrane has finite thickness and the lipid volume , rather than the lipid area , is conserved : let @xmath143 and @xmath144 denote the local membrane height and thickness as before , with @xmath145 .",

    "[ fig : t1p3_pl2 - 4_umbrella ] , top ) . in the second case ( fig .",
    "[ fig : t1p3_pl2 - 4_umbrella ] , bottom ) , the hydrophobic part of the inclusion roughly matches the thickness in the tensionless case . under tension , the membrane thins and a positive hydrophobic mismatch develops ( see inset fig .",

    "the curves show an oscillatory shape with a wavelength of approximately @xmath256 .",
    "since at small inclusion - inclusion distances direct interactions of the proteins and depletion induced attraction due to the solvent particles come into play , these parts of the curves have been cut off .",
    "thus , we can focus on the lipid - mediated medium and long ranged interactions .",
    "the main effect of tension on the lipid mediated interactions between the two model proteins can be summarized as follows : in the absence of tension , the interactions between hydrophobically mismatched inclusions have an additional attractive contribution , compared to hydrophobically matched inclusions . in the case where the tension reduces the hydrophobic mismatch due to membrane thinning",
    ", this attraction diminishes .",
    "if , on the other hand , the tension leads to a stronger hydrophobic mismatch , the attractivity of the interaction potential also increases .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the dominant effect of an external tension on the lipid - mediated interactions is indirect and related to the change of the hydrophobic mismatch due to the membrane thinning . for decreasing ( negative ) mismatch , the average attraction decreases , and for increasing ( positive ) mismatch , it increases .",
    "this is consistent with the behavior observed in tensionless membranes , where also both positive and negative hydrophobic mismatch resulted in an attractive contribution to the pmf @xcite .",
    "other recent studies @xcite have also highlighted the importance of hydrophobic mismatch as a driving factor for protein agglomeration . from our simulations , an additional effect of tension is not evident .",
    "in this paper we have studied the influence of an external tension on the properties of bilayers using a generic coarse - grained model . to put these results into perspective",
    ", we will now briefly discuss the experimental situation .",
    "experimentally , one of the most widely used techniques to determine mechanical stretch properties of bilayers is the micropipette approach , where giant bilayer vesicles are pressurized by micropipette suction @xcite .",
    "this method produces a uniform membrane tension , is very accurate , and can be used to verify elastic reversibility @xcite .",
    "micropipette aspiration experiments , _",
    "e.g. _ , carried out by needham and nun @xcite , found for different lipids and lipid / cholesterol mixtures that membrane lysis is usually reached at an relative areal expansion of less than @xmath257 , and the rupture strength at low cholesterol concentration was typically around @xmath258 .",
    "this does not compare well with our findings and those of other atomistic or mesoscopic simulations ( see the introduction to sec .  [",
    "sec : results ] ) , where fluid membranes could sustain tensions of @xmath259 or more and remained stable up to relative extensions of 40 % or more .",
    "it should however be noted that tension - induced lysis is a stochastic process , and the duration of the exposure to the stress plays a decisive role for the stability .",
    "experimentally , abrupt failure of the bilayer is observed , when the tension reaches a critical value , whereas below this tension long - term persistence of the stressed membrane can be presumed @xcite .",

    ", they varied the loading rate from @xmath260 . at high loading rates",
    "the systems were found to be stable up to values of @xmath261 .    to get a rough estimate of the meaning of the timescales in our simulations , compared to experimental systems",
