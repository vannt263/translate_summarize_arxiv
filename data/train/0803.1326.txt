    "in recent proposals to reformulate classical maxwell - lorentz electrodynamics , electric and magnetic interactions propagate instantaneously @xcite and the free electromagnetic field is an approximation for a large ensemble of discrete quantum particles - photons @xcite .",
    "these ideas of `` field - less '' electrodynamics are attractive for several reasons . first , the traditional continuous field description of radiation is in conflict with corpuscular properties of light that are evident in all kinds of single - photon experiments , in the photo - electric effect , etc .",
    "second , the traditional notions of the momentum and energy contained in electromagnetic fields lead to divergences , `` 4/3 problem '' and other paradoxes @xcite , which can be avoided in the field - less description .",
    "third , the usual assumption of the retarded character of the coulomb and magnetic interactions has not been confirmed by experiment , , and they are responsible for radar , radio , tv , etc . signals .",
    "we will not discuss the electromagnetic radiation effects in this paper . ] and this assumption results in the paradox of energy non - conservation @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the indirect support for field - less electrodynamics is provided by numerous experiments @xcite , which can be interpreted as an evidence of instantaneous action - at - a - distance .",
    "it was also demonstrated that such a superluminality does not violate the principle of causality @xcite , and that action - at - a - distance potentials can be a reasonable alternative to the general relativistic description of gravity @xcite .",
    "first attempts at hamiltonian formulations of electrodynamics without fields were undertaken by darwin @xcite and breit @xcite .",
    "they found that electromagnetic effects in the @xmath0 approximation can be represented by instantaneous interparticle forces .",
    "the relativistic invariance of this approach was established in @xcite .",
    "the darwin - breit hamiltonian was successfully applied to various electromagnetic problems , such as the fine structure in atomic spectra @xcite , superconductivity and properties of plasma @xcite .",
    "the aharonov - bohm effect @xcite is usually believed to be an indication of the fundamental importance of electromagnetic potentials and fields in nature . although , several non - conventional explanations of this effect were suggested in the literature @xcite , as far as i know , there were no attempts to interpret this effect in terms of direct interactions between particles . in this paper",
    "we would like to fill this gap and to suggest a simple description of the aharonov - bohm effect within the darwin - breit action - at - a - distance theory .",
    "this explanation does not involve the notions of electromagnetic potentials , fields , and non - trivial space topologies .    in section [ sc : hamiltonian ]",
    "we briefly discuss the relativistic hamiltonian quantum mechanics and formulation of the darwin - breit theory as a classical limit of the dressed particle version of quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) @xcite . in section [ sc : two - particle ] we apply the darwin - breit hamiltonian to interactions of a moving point charge with solenoids and ferromagnets .",
    "the new approach to the aharonov - bohm effect is discussed in section [ sc : ahar ] .",
    "one class of problems characteristic to maxwell - lorentz electrodynamics is related to the apparent non - conservation of total observables ( energy , momentum , angular momentum , etc . ) in systems of interacting charges .",
    "indeed , in the theory based on maxwell s equations there is no guarantee that total observables are conserved , that newton s third law of action and reaction is valid , and that total energy and momentum form a 4-vector quantity .",
    "suggested solutions of these paradoxes @xcite involved such _",
    "ad hoc _ constructions as `` hidden momentum '' , the energy and momentum of electromagnetic fields , `` poincar stresses '' , etc .    in theoretical physics it is well established that conservation laws are consequences of the invariance of observations with respect to inertial transformations of reference frames .",
    "these transformations are elements of the poincar group .",
    "so , the conservation of total observables and their correct transformation properties can be guaranteed in an approach based on a ( hamiltonian ) theory of representations of the poincar group . in quantum mechanics ,",
    "such an approach is realized within wigner - dirac theory @xcite in which dynamics of any isolated physical system is described as a representation of the poincar lie algebra by hermitian operators in the hilbert space of states .",
    "representatives of ten basis elements ( generators ) of the poincar lie algebra are identified with observables of the total linear momentum @xmath1 , total angular momentum @xmath2 , total energy ( the hamiltonian ) @xmath3 , and `` boost '' operator @xmath4 . in the instant form of dirac s dynamics @xcite , these generators have the form    @xmath5    where the non - interacting parts @xmath6 are simply sums of one - particle generators , and interactions are contained in the _ potential energy _ @xmath7 and _ potential boost _ @xmath8 operators .",
    "the commutator of any observable @xmath9 with the hamiltonian @xmath3 determines the time evolution of this observable in the heisenberg picture of quantum mechanics    @xmath10\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    then the conservation of observables @xmath11 and @xmath2 follows automatically from their vanishing commutators with @xmath3 .",
    "these conservation laws hold true independent on interactions that may be present in the multiparticle system .",
    "this simple fact is not at all obvious in the maxwell - lorentz theory , which , for example , has serious difficulties in explaining the conservation of the total angular momentum of a moving capacitor in the trouton - noble experiment @xcite .",
    "there are three essential steps @xcite that need to be made in order to arrive at the darwin - breit hamiltonian from qed , which is rightly considered the most accurate physical theory in existence .",
    "first , the `` dressed particle '' approach @xcite should be applied , which allows one to formulate the quantum field theory in terms of physical ( rather than `` bare '' ) particles and avoid ultraviolet divergences .",
    "this leads to the perturbation expansion of the potential energy operator @xmath7 whose terms are direct particle interactions . in the second perturbation order",
    "the interaction is a sum of two - particle terms , so it is possible to consider only the two - particle sector of the fock space and express the interaction energy as a function of particle charges @xmath12 , positions @xmath13 , momenta @xmath14 , spins @xmath15 , and energies @xmath16 .",
    "second , in the classical limit ( @xmath17 ) commutators of operators are replaced by _ poisson brackets _",
    "finally , for low - velocity processes of classical electrodynamics one can represent all quantities as series in powers of @xmath19 and leave only terms of order not higher than @xmath20 . in these approximations the set of generators ( [ eq : p ] ) - ( [ eq : h ] ) takes the form    @xmath21 + \\mathbf{s}_1 + [ \\mathbf{r}_2 \\times \\mathbf{p}_2 ] + \\mathbf{s}_2 \\nonumber \\\\ h_0 & = & h_1 + h_2 \\nonumber \\\\ & \\approx & m_1c^2 + m_2c^2 + \\frac{p_1 ^ 2}{2m_1 } + \\frac{p_2 ^ 2}{2m_2}- \\frac{p_1 ^ 4}{8m_1 ^ 3c^2 }    - \\frac{p_2 ^ 4}{8m_2 ^ 3c^2}\\label{eq : mc2 } \\\\",

    "it contains the familiar coulomb energy ( [ eq : coulomb ] ) and the _ darwin potential _ energy ( [ eq : darwin ] ) @xcite , which is responsible for magnetic interactions between charged particles .",
    "further relativistic corrections are given by the spin - orbit ( [ eq : h - spin - orb ] ) and spin - spin ( [ eq : h - spin - spin ] ) interactions .",

    "it is easy to show that this integral vanishes .",
    "this agrees with the prediction of maxwell s theory that a charge is moving without acceleration in the vicinity of an infinite magnetized solenoid / rod .",
    "in particular , this result is consistent with the lack of `` time lag '' in experiments @xcite .",
    "let us consider the following idealized version of the aharonov - bohm experiment ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] ) : an infinite solenoid or ferromagnetic rod with negligible cross - section and linear magnetization @xmath39 is erected vertically in the origin ( grey arrows ) .",
    "the electron wave packet is split into two parts ( e.g. , by using a double - slit ) at point @xmath40 .",
    "these subpackets travel on both sides of the solenoid / rod with constant velocity @xmath41 , and the distance of the closest approach is @xmath42 .",

    "therefore the aharonov - bohm effect can not be explained as a result of classical forces @xcite . to resolve this paradox",
    "it is sufficient to mention that the representation of the wave packet as a point moving through space along the trajectory ( [ eq : rt ] ) is an oversimplification .",
    "a more complete description of the electron s wave function should also include the overall phase factor    @xmath49    the _ action _ integral @xmath50 for the one - particle wave packet that traveled between time points @xmath51 and @xmath52 is    @xmath53    where @xmath54 is the contribution to the particle s energy due to the external potential .",

    "there are three types of charges in this problem : first , there is the charge @xmath63 located at a general point in space @xmath64 and having arbitrary momentum @xmath65 .",

    "[ fig:1 ] . finally , the spins of ions and electrons in the wire are oriented randomly , therefore hamiltonian terms ( [ eq : h - spin - orb ] ) - ( [ eq : h - spin - spin ] ) , being linear with respect to particle spins , vanish after averaging",
    ". then the potential energy of interaction between the charge 1 and the loop element @xmath74 is given by the darwin s formula              taking into account the usual definition of the loop s magnetic moment @xmath85 ( see eq .",
