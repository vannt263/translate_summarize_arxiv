    "systems of low dimensions have provided special opportunities , challenges , and fascination for condensed matter physicists @xcite .",
    "issues of long - range order , dimensional crossover , and instabilities are all significant in such systems",
    ". many aspects of the physics have been studied , and many are now understood .",
    "the electronic properties of low - dimensional systems such as quantum wires or carbon nanotubes are in many cases well described by the tomonaga - luttinger theory @xcite which predicts spectacular effects of electron - electron interactions such as _ electron fractionalization _ : an injected electron will necessarily break up into separate charge and spin excitations , which will travel at different velocities .",
    "the evidence of spin - charge separation in luttinger systems has been obtained via the non - linear tunneling conductance between parallel wires in a transverse magnetic field @xcite .",
    "this provides a direct spectroscopic probe of spin - charge separation which gives a similar information to an ideal photoemission experiment .",
    "luttinger liquid behavior has also been observed through energy dependent local tunneling @xcite and power - law tunneling lineshapes @xcite .    another remarkable effect predicted by luttinger liquid theory",
    "is _ charge fractionalization _ : the extra charge produced by an electron tunneling into the middle of a uniform luttinger liquid will break up into pieces , moving in opposite directions , which will carry definite fractions @xmath0 and @xmath1 of the electron charge , determined by a parameter @xmath2 ( the luttinger parameter ) that measures the strength of charge interactions in the wire .",
    "this fractional charge is not just a statistical average , but is predicted to be a definite property of the quantum mechanical state , subject in principle to verification by repeated measurements after a single tunneling event @xcite .",
    "it should be emphasized that charge fractionalization in a ( gapless ) luttinger liquid is very different from the charge fractionalization in a two - dimensional fractional quantized hall system .",
    "for example , if the quantized hall system is in a laughlin state @xcite at landau - level filling fraction @xmath3 , a quasiparticle with minimal fractional charge @xmath4 is an absolutely stable excitation .",
    "if it is far from a boundary and far from other excitations , the charge can not further subdivide , and it will be separated by an energy gap from other states with multiple quasiparticles and quasiholes , which could carry the same total charge . in",
    "a nonchiral luttinger liquid , it is possible to create left and right moving charge excitations with arbitrary charge , at arbitrarily small energy . the definite charges @xmath5 and @xmath6 are most properly understood as a property of the electron injection process , rather than as properties of elementary excitations in the liquid itself .",
    "the edge of a quantized hall system is a peculiar , one - dimensional metal , with gapless charged excitations , which has many properties in common with the ordinary nonchiral luttinger liquid @xcite .",
    "the edges of a quantized hall state are chiral , however , so that , in most cases , charge can flow in only one direction a long any given edge . by charge conservation , an electron injected from the outside into one edge of a macroscopic quantized hall system must propagate along that edge , with charge @xmath7 .",
    "however , if there is a narrow constriction in a strip containing electrons in a fractional quantized hall state , there can be tunneling of charge from one edge to the other , and this charge need not be quantized in units of @xmath7 .",
    "if the quantized hall system is in a laughlin state at @xmath3 , and if the matrix elements for tunneling across the constriction are sufficiently weak , then charge will typically be transferred from one edge to the other in unit of @xmath4 @xcite . however , in the more general case , where tunneling between the edges is not weak , it is not clear that charge is necessarily transferred in multiples of @xmath4 .",
    "thus for the chiral luttinger liquid , just as for the ordinary luttinger liquid , it may be most precise to regard charge fractionalization in a chiral luttinger liquid as a consequence of the charge injection process , rather than as a fundamental property of the ( chiral ) luttinger liquid itself .",
    "however , this issue requires further investigation .",
    "observing charge fractionalization physics in an experiment has generally been a considerable challenge , even for fractional quantized hall systems .",
    "however , the existence of isolated charge of magnitude @xmath4 in the bulk of a fractional quantized hall state at @xmath3 has recently been confirmed by direct charge sensing with a single electron transistor @xcite .",
    "the predicted fractional charge for tunneling across a constriction in the weak backscattering regime has been confirmed by low - frequency shot - noise measurements @xcite in selected quantized hall systems .",
    "a number of other experiments have also given evidence for fractional charge @xcite .",
    "in particular , an @xmath4-quasiparticle interferometer has been envisioned theoretically @xcite and realized experimentally recently @xcite .",
    "while for fractional quantum hall edge states , the counterpropagating modes are spatially separated , in quantum wires or carbon nanotubes , the nonchiral modes are confined to the same spatial channel , and can not be contacted individually .",
    "their chemical potentials renormalize in a non - trivial manner when adiabatically coupled to metallic leads , making charge fractionalization phenomenoa difficult to observe .",
    "the dc two - terminal conductance with ideal contacts is universal and independent of interactions @xcite .",
    "furthermore , low - frequency shot - noise measurements in an ideal wire would only reveal the physics of the fermi - liquid contacts @xcite .",
    "a straightforward transposition of the results obtained for the chiral edge system therefore proves difficult .",
    "very recently , we have envisioned a three - terminal geometry where unidirectional electrons are injected from the bulk of a wire and the resulting current at drains located on both sides is measured , to detect charge fractionalization @xcite . more precisely , using momentum conservation in the tunneling process between two wires one injects unidirectional electrons to the bulk of a wire , with charge fractionalization resulting in currents detected on both sides of the injection region .",
    "we have suggested that the ratio of these currents together with a two - terminal reference measurement then allows to extract the extent of charge fractionalization . in this paper , we flesh out the theoretical concepts and demonstrate that such a three - terminal geometry reveals charge fractionalization in accordance with the recent experimental results @xcite .",
    "in particular , we introduce a novel universal ratio which allows to reveal the charge fractionalization mechanism in nonchiral luttinger liquids .",
    "firstly , we introduce the chiral fields of nonchiral luttinger liquids @xcite .",
    "it is indeed convenient to distinguish the charge excitations propagating to the left @xmath8 from the charge excitations propagating to the right @xmath9 .",
    "the charge sector of a ( single - mode ) quantum wire is described by the luttinger hamiltonian ( the electron spectrum is assumed to be perfectly linear ) , @xmath10,\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is the charge mode and @xmath12 the superfluid phase satisfying : @xmath13 = i\\delta(x - y).\\ ] ] moreover , we identify @xmath14 , and similarly for @xmath12 ; this represents ( plasmon ) waves moving at the velocity @xmath15 .",
    "it should be noted that the chiral densities must satisfy @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is arbitrary , since the charge sector of the luttinger liquid is ( only ) controlled by the plasmon velocity @xmath15 .",
    "in fact , one can find @xmath18 by writing the `` conservation '' laws @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "we have used the definitions of the fluctuations in the charge ( electron ) density @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the mean electron density , and of the current density in a luttinger liquid for a spinful luttinger liquid .",

    "it is also convenient to introduce the chiral chemical potentials associated to the chiral modes , @xmath28 .",
    "we deduce , @xmath29 hence , the chiral currents in a quantum wire are defined as , @xmath30      now , to elucidate the concept of charge fractionalization in a quantum wire embodied by a luttinger theory , let us inject an extra electron with a well - defined momentum at one fermi point .    in a geometry comprising parallel wires ,",
    "this can be performed through the application of a transverse magnetic field @xmath31 producing a large momentum boost @xmath32  @xmath33 denotes the distance between the two wires and @xmath34 is the flux quantum  parallel to the wire when an electron tunnels from the upper probe ( wire ) to the quantum wire .",
    "the momentum boost is independent of energy .",
    "an ideal situation to probe charged excitations in a luttinger liquid is when the magnetic field obeys @xmath35 @xcite , where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the fermi wavectors of the upper one - dimensional probe and of the wire , respectively ; see fig .",
    "this is necessary to ensure that electrons are injected in the lower wire at one fermi point only , say @xmath38 .    the first manner to admit charge fractionalization is to write down a tunneling hamiltonian between the quantum wire and a one - dimensional ( 1d ) upper probe which is long ( compared to @xmath39 ) to conserve momentum during the tunneling process . in the case of fig .",

    "can also broaden the electron spectral function @xcite .",
    "for example , in ref .",
    "@xcite , electrons in the wires also interact with those in the bulk two - dimensional electron gas ( electrical contact is made to the upper wires via a two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron gas ) which results in a finite 1d-2d scattering length @xmath53 such that @xmath54 at low temperatures @xcite .",

    "this proves that the extra charge produced by an electron tunneling into the middle of a uniform wire ( described by a luttinger liquid ) will break up into two pieces .",
    "in addition , one can compute the averaged current at a point @xmath47 and time @xmath48 in the lower wire for a finite bias voltage @xmath64 applied between the upper and lower wires .",

    "more precisely , let us inject @xmath83 electrons in the lower wire such that @xmath84 describes the difference between the number of right - moving electrons and the number of left - moving electrons . in general , this will produce two counterpropagating states with charge @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
