    "in the field of mesoscopic physics louisell was the first who quantized a mesoscopic l - c ( inductance @xmath1 and capacitance @xmath2 ) circuit as a quantum harmonic oscillator @xcite .",
    "he made it by quantizing electric charge as the coordinate operator @xmath3 while quantizing electric current @xmath4 multiplied by @xmath1 as the momentum operator @xmath5 .",
    "louisell s work has become more and more popular because mesoscopic l - c circuits may have wide applications in quantum computer . however , louisell only calculated quantum fluctuation of l - c circuit at zero - temperature . in ref.@xcite fan and",
    "liang pointed out that since electric current generates joule thermal effect , one should take thermo effect into account , thus every physical observable should be evaluated in the context of ensemble average .",
    "besides , since entropy increases with the generation of joule heat , one should consider how the resistance @xmath0 in rlc electric circuit affects the variation of entropy .",
    "we shall use the generalized hellmann - feynmam theorem ( ghft ) for ensemble average to discuss this topic .",
    "the usual hellmann - feynman ( h - f ) theorem states @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 ( a hamiltonian which involves parameter @xmath8 ) possesses the eigenvector @xmath9 @xmath10 for many troublesome problems in searching for energy level in quantum mechanics , people can resort to the h - f theorem to make the analytical calculation .",
    "however , this formula is only available for the pure state , quantum statistical mechanics is the study of statistical ensembles of quantum mechanics .",
    "a statistical ensemble is described by a density matrix @xmath11 , which is a non - negative , self - adjoint , trace - class operator of trace 1 on the hilbert space describing the quantum system .",

    "( [ 1 ] ) to the ensemble average case is necessary and has been done in refs @xcite .",
    "our paper is arranged as follows : in sec .",
    "2 we briefly introduce the ghft for ensemble average @xmath12 where the subscript @xmath13denotes ensemble average . in sec . 3 based on von neuman s quantum entropy definition @xmath14 and using the ghft we derive the entropy - variation formula for @xmath15 and its relation to @xmath16 in sec .",
    "4 we use the ghft to calculate internal energy of the quantized rlc circuit and its fluctuation , as well as the average energy consumed by resistance @xmath0 . in sec .",
    "5 we employ the ghft to find the relation between entropy and @xmath0 . by depicting figures",
    "we indeed see that the entropy increases with the increment of resistance @xmath17",
    "for the mixed states in thermal equilibrium described by density operators @xmath18where @xmath19tr@xmath20 is the partition function ( @xmath21 is boltzmann constant and @xmath22  is temperature ) , we have proposed the ghft 5 .",

    "entropy @xmath43 in classical statistical mechanics is defined as @xmath44where @xmath45 is system s internal energy or the ensemble average of hamiltonian @xmath46 , and @xmath47 is helmholtz free energy,@xmath48according to eq.([12 ] ) the entropy can not be calculated until systems energy level @xmath49 is known . in this work",
    "we consider how to derive entropy without knowning @xmath49 in advance , i.e. , we will not diagonalize the hamiltonian before calculating the entropy , instead , our starting point is using entropy s quantum - mechanical definition , @xmath50it is von neuman who extended the classical concept of entropy ( put forth by gibbs ) into the quantum domain . note that , because the trace is actually representation independent , eq .",
    "( [ 13 ] ) assigns zero entropy to any pure state .",
