    "powerful radio sources , such as radio galaxies and quasars , trace the most massive galaxies ( jarvis et al . 2001a ; de breuck et al . 2002 ; willott et al . 2003 ; zirm , dickinson & dey 2003 ) and are associated with the most massive black holes ( dunlop et al .",
    "2003 ; mclure et al . 2004 ; mclure & jarvis 2004 ) in the universe , at all cosmic epochs .",
    "radio galaxies have been detected up to redshifts of just above five ( van breugel et al .",
    "1999 ) , and quasars up to and beyond redshifts of six ( fan et al .",
    "2003 ) , leaving little time during which quasars and their host galaxies could form .",
    "this provides a challenge for hierarchical galaxy formation models , though some recent semi - analytic models are able to produce significant numbers of massive galaxies at high redshifts ( e.g. bower et al .",

    "2006 ) . constraining",
    "the space - density of high - redshift radio sources is therefore important , as it has implications on the theories of galaxy and structure formation .",
    "using radio sources is also advantageous in this respect because they are selected on the basis of their radio emission and are thus free of the problems associated with optical selection methods , such as dust obscuration ( cf .",
    "optically selected quasars ) .",
    "it is clear that the co - moving space densities of the rarest , most powerful radio sources were much higher around @xmath2 than they are at present ( longair 1966 ) , but the form of the evolution beyond that redshift is still a matter of debate .",
    "the question of a ` redshift cut - off ' ( dunlop & peacock 1990 ) in the radio source population has come under careful scrutiny in recent years ( jarvis & rawlings 2000 ; jarvis et al .",
    "the current situation is one in which there is no compelling evidence of a high - redshift decline in low - frequency selected ( i.e. predominantly steep - spectrum ) radio sources , whereas there is evidence for a slight decline in radio - loud quasars from high - frequency selected ( i.e. predominantly flat - spectrum ) samples ( dunlop & peacock 1990 , shaver et al .",
    "1996 ; jarvis & rawlings 2000 ; wall et al . 2005 ) .",
    "in this study we focus on the low - frequency selected population ( predominantly radio galaxies ) . to this effect , we use a new sample of radio sources drawn from the 151  mhz 6c survey , which has been filtered with radio criteria designed to optimize the chances of finding radio galaxies at @xmath3 .",
    "this sample , namely 6c * * , has been selected to be brighter than 0.5  jy at 151  mhz .",
    "additional selection criteria have excluded all sources with radio spectral index between 151  mhz and 1.4  ghz flatter than 1 , or with radio angular size larger than 13  arcsec .",
    "the final sample consists of 68 objects over an area of sky of 0.421  sr , and is statistically complete at an angular size limit of @xmath4  arcsec .",
    "full details of how the 6c * * sample was selected can be found in cruz et al .",
    "( 2006 , hereafter paper i ) .",
    "the selection criteria just described are similar to those of the 6c * sample ( blundell et al .",
    "1998 ; jarvis et al .",
    "2001a , b ) , which was one of the samples used by jarvis et al . ( 2001c ) to constrain the co - moving space density of low - frequency selected radio sources .",
    "the 6c * sample was crucial in that study in sampling to high redshift ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "the 6c * * sample , being larger ( cf .",
    "0.13  sr ) and deeper ( cf .",
    "@xmath6  jy ) than 6c * , aims to improve on the small - number statistics limitation of this previous work , and ultimately to extend it to higher redshifts ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "deep imaging follow - up with ufti / uist on ukirt , niri on gemini and nirc on keck provided photometry for all members of the 6c * * sample ( paper i ) .",

    "the distribution derived from the data appears to be in very good agreement with the model distribution .",
    "this is confirmed by the application of the chi - squared goodness - of - fit test , which gives , with a probability @xmath16 of obtaining this , or greater than this value of @xmath17 .",
    "we perform also the same analysis by omitting 6c**0737 + 5618 in the @xmath18 bin .",
    "this source is unidentified and it is debatable that its magnitude limit ( @xmath19  mag in a 8-arcsec aperture at the 3@xmath20 level ) implies , by extrapolation of the @xmath0 diagram , a very high redshift ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "it is also possible that this source , like 6c**0935 + 4348 , is at a lower redshift ( @xmath21 ) but is perhaps at a very early stage of its formation and/or highly obscured , or is simply underluminous ( see discussion in section  [ sec : comparison ] ) .",
    "however , a very high - redshift can not be ruled out .    omitting 6c**0737 + 5618 from our analysis does not change the results significantly .",
    "we find @xmath22 , with @xmath23 .",
    "again , we conclude that the data are consistent with the constant co - moving space density model of jarvis et al .",
    "( 2001c ) .    finally , we compare the data with the predictions from five declining co - moving space density models , using jarvis et al .",

    "[ fig : redshift.pdf ] ) , @xmath27 and @xmath28 ( dot - dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : redshift.pdf ] ) .",
    "the results of the chi - squared goodness - of - fit test are listed in table  [ tab : chi - square ] .",
    "it can be seen that , although the data are also consistent with moderate declines by factors of 2 to 3 , declines by a factor of 3.5 and 4.0 can be excluded at the @xmath29 level .      as discussed by jarvis ( 2000 ) , filtered samples such as 6c * * have limitations when it comes to confirming a decline in co - moving space density .",
    "the major problem is that the lack of sources at a given redshift may not be due to a decline in their space density but to imperfections in the filtering technique .",
    "for example , with respect to the 6c * sample , jarvis ( 2000 ) estimated that the angular size selection is filtering out an increasingly large fraction of the sources with redshift : from @xmath30% to @xmath31% between @xmath32 and @xmath33 ; and @xmath34% beyond @xmath35 .",
    "jarvis ( 2000 ) concluded that samples with similar filtering criteria to that of 6c * , and in particular with flux - density limits similar to that of 6c * * , are only able to confirm roughly constant or increasing co - moving space density at high redshifts .",
    "the presence of a decline would be difficult to interpret due to the uncertainties introduced by the filtering criteria .",
    "however , the filtering is helpful in placing strong lower limits on any decline .",
    "a method of redshift estimation , based on the @xmath0 diagram of the 3crr , 6ce , 6c * and 7crs radio galaxies has been developed .",
    "redshift probability density functions are derived for all of the 6c * * sources which are identified with a near - infrared counterpart , i.e. for 66 of the 68 members of the sample .",
    "comparison of the resulting redshift estimates with the subset of spectroscopic redshifts shows that our method is fairly robust whenever emission - line and/or non - stellar contributions to the @xmath10-magnitudes can be neglected .",
    "the estimated redshift distribution has a median redshift of @xmath36 .",
    "however , we find that the quasars have their redshifts significantly under - estimated by our method .",
    "this is explained by the fact that the method is based on the @xmath0 relation , which is only valid for radio galaxies . removing the quasars from the distribution results in a median",
    "estimated redshift of @xmath37 .",
    "this is similar to that of the 6c * sample ( @xmath38 ) and is significantly higher than that of unfiltered , complete surveys at the same flux density limit .",
    "we conclude that the filtering criteria were effective in biasing the 6c * * sample to objects at high - redshift .",
    "the redshift distribution of the most luminous sources in the 6c * * sample is compared with the predictions of the steep - spectrum rlf model of jarvis et al .",
    "( 2001c ) .",
    "we find that the 6c * * data is consistent with a constant co - moving space density at @xmath39 , and moderate declines by factors of @xmath40 4 can be excluded at the @xmath29 level .",
    "although jarvis et al . ( 2001c ) excluded these declines at the @xmath41 level , the additional data from 6c * * provide an independent measure .",
    "thus , the two independent studies are in quantitative agreement with the result that any decline at high redshift is shallow .",
    "we note that our result is based on a redshift distribution which is uncertain for the following reasons : ( i ) a significant fraction of the sample is not identified spectroscopically ; ( ii ) the method of redshift estimation relies on the limited statistics of the 3crr , 6ce , 7crs and 6c * radio galaxies at @xmath42 ( the scatter in the @xmath0 diagram at these high redshifts is still poorly defined ) ; and ( iii ) the redshift estimates of quasars are systematically under - estimated by our method .",
    "most of these are likely to lead to an under - estimate of the true median redshift of the complete sample .",
    "thus , although spectroscopically incomplete , with the 6c * * sample we have additional strong constraints on the high - redshift space density , with a sample that increases the number of powerful steep - spectrum sources , from complete samples at @xmath43 , by a factor of @xmath40 2 .    the work presented here could be significantly improved by obtaining spectroscopic redshifts for a larger fraction of sources in the 6c * * sample",
    ". this would be particularly important for the faintest sources ( @xmath44mag ) , since these are the most probable @xmath43 candidates .",
    "with spectra of these sources we should be able to obtain a tighter constrain on the co - moving space density at @xmath43 .",
