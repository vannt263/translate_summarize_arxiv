    "a variety of observational evidences indicate the existence of non - baryonic dark matter ( dm ) . the latest cosmological observations including the wmap reveal that dark matter accounts for about 83% of the energy density of matter in the universe  @xcite .",
    "the standard model ( sm ) in particle physics , however , does not explain its existence , and its identification has been a challenge in both particle physics and cosmology .",
    "there are several candidates proposed for the dark matter in physics beyond the sm .",
    "one of the most attractive candidates is so - called weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) , which interact with ordinary matter only through weak and gravitational interactions . in the wimp dm scenario , wimps are supposed to be stable and produced in the thermal history of the universe . then naturally their relic explains the present abundance of dark matter with the mass around tev scale .",
    "nowadays we are reaching to the energy frontier of the tev scale at the collider experiments . at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , where protons are colliding at the center of mass energy of 7 tev",
    ", the wimp dark matter is expected to be produced and observed as large missing energy .",
    "in addition , several extensions of the sm also include heavy colored particles which interact with wimps directly or via gauge bosons .",
    "once they are produced at the collider , they subsequently decay into wimps accompanied by high energy qcd jets .",
    "that is why the main strategy for probing such new models is based on events with hard jets and large missing transverse energy .",
    "the lhc experiments have already presented results for several models , and put severe constraints on them as no excess above the sm background has been observed .",
    "for example , the exclusion limits for the constrained minimal supersymmetric standard model ( cmssm ) are presented in refs .",
    "however , the constraints are not directly applied if the colored particles are nearly degenerate with the wimps in mass  @xcite . in this case , the leading jets in most events are too soft to pass the signal selection , and thus it is difficult to confirm or exclude such scenario at the lhc .    in this letter , we study possibilities for probing this scenario in terms of the direct detection experiments of the dark matter in the universe .",
    "we found that both of the spin - independent ( si ) and spin - dependent ( sd ) couplings of the wimps with a nucleon are enhanced when the masses of colored particles which mediate the scattering are degenerate with that of wimps .",
    "this implies that dm direct detection experiments offer a promising way to investigate the degenerate scenario .",
    "the ongoing direct detection experiments have extremely high sensitivities .",
    "for example , xenon100 currently gives the most stringent constraint on the si wimp dm - nucleon elastic scattering cross sections , @xmath6 for a wimp mass of 50 gev @xcite .",
    "moreover , there are several proposals to use ton - scale detectors in the future , which are designed to detect wimps with sensitivities much below the current limit .",
    "recently a proposal for a future wimp search experiment , which is planning to achieve a sensitivity of the si cross section , @xmath7 , is announced  @xcite . with regard to the sd cross section",
    ", the icecube detector would offer excellent sensitivities to it  @xcite .",
    "it has provided upper limits on the sd cross section of wimps with a nucleon , @xmath8  @xmath9 with wimp mass in the range of @xmath10@xmath11 , and further improvement of the sensitivities by a factor of 210 is expected in the same mass range  @xcite .",
    "the scattering cross section of wimps with a nucleon is evaluated by using the several effective couplings of wimps with quarks and gluon .",
    "the precise computation of them is important for the evaluation of the cross section because they may be either destructive @xcite or constructive @xcite , depending on wimp models .",
    "recently an approach to study nature of the dark matter based on both collider and direct detection experiments in terms of the effective theory is proposed @xcite .",
    "the authors , however , take just one of the effective couplings into account for the evaluation of the cross sections . in this letter",
    ", we include all of the relevant effective operators into the calculation , and find that the scattering amplitude is enhanced when the masses of colored particles which mediate the scattering are degenerate with that of wimps .",
    "in our letter we study two representative models ; the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) and the minimal universal extra dimension model ( mued ) . in the mssm ,",
    "the lightest superparticle ( lsp ) , which is stabilized by the @xmath12 parity , is a good candidate for the dm . in this framework",
    ", we consider the lightest neutralino , especially wino - like , dm . among the components of neutralino",
    ", wino has relatively large coupling to colored particles ( _ i.e. _ squarks ) and has a big impact on the cross section . in the mued model ,",
    "the kaluza - klein ( kk ) parity protects the lightest kk particle ( lkp ) from decay , and the lkp is a good candidate for the dm .",
    "we consider the scenario where the first excited kk gauge boson is the lkp  @xcite .",
    "there is an earlier literature which studies the complementarity of direct detection and collider searches in the mued  @xcite . in their work , however , several effective operators are not considered ; thus , the resultant cross sections are smaller than those obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , where all of the relevant effective operators are taken into account .",
    "we find that the scattering cross sections may reach even the current bound of the direct detection experiments .",
    "although the scattering cross section depends on the details of dm scenarios , our results obtained for the two scenarios describe general aspects of enhancement of cross section in the degenerate scenario .",
    "let us study the wino - like neutralino dm case for a starter . to make discussion simple , we assume the lightest neutralino is close to a pure wino state . generalization to other composition of the lightest neutralino",

    "<S> the scenario with such a mass spectrum is difficult to be confirmed or excluded by the present analysis at the lhc experiments because the qcd jets in the cascade decay of the new particles produced in the proton - proton collision are too soft to be triggered in the event selection . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that both of the spin - independent and spin - dependent couplings of the dark matter with a nucleon are enhanced and the scattering cross section may reach even the current bound of the direct detection experiments . then such a degenerate scenario may be tested in the direct detection experiments .    </S>",
