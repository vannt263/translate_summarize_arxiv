    "categorification of quantum group invariants has been a very active area of research in the past several years . by now , a number of methods have been developed that allow one to `` promote '' a polynomial invariant @xmath0 of a knot @xmath1 colored by a representation @xmath2 of @xmath3 to a bi - graded homology theory @xmath4 , whose euler characteristic is @xmath0 : @xmath5 in practice , it is often convenient to work with poincar polynomials of @xmath4 : @xmath6 or , better yet , with the so - called superpolynomials @xmath7 that depend on three variables and package homological invariants of arbitrary rank and fixed cartan type .",
    "while formal definitions of these homological knot invariants are available for many groups and representations @xcite , their calculation has been a daunting task . besides the khovanov - rozansky homology @xcite , which corresponds to the fundamental representation of @xmath8 and is reasonably computable , at present there",
    "exist only two approaches amenable to calculations for arbitrary groups and representations .",
    "one approach @xcite is based on the formal structure of knot homologies ( and superpolynomials ) that follows from the physical interpretation @xcite of knot homologies .",
    "another approach @xcite proposed recently is based on daha ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "both of these approaches have advantages and disadvantages .",
    "the first approach allows one to compute homological invariants / superpolynomials of arbitrary knots , while the second approach is limited to torus knots . on the other hand , the second approach",
    "can easily be implemented on a computer , whereas the first approach can only be done `` by hand '' for simple knots with up to 10 crossings or so .",
    "more importantly for the present paper , neither approach is limited to classical groups or particular representations .",
    "we use this feature to tackle one of the most difficult problems in this subject : the study of homological invariants ( and superpolynomials ) associated with exceptional groups .",
    "in fact , for a problem like this we will need to combine the power of both methods , because each one individually is not sufficient for producing a polynomial with positive coefficients .",
    "the simplest `` exceptional knot homology '' corresponds to the minuscule 27-dimensional representation of the simply - laced lie algebra @xmath9 .",
    "the representation of the principal @xmath10 on @xmath11 is isomorphic to the representation of the lefschetz @xmath10 on the cohomology of the 16-dimensional flag variety @xmath12 , with the poincar polynomial ,    @xmath13    the strategy of our approach will be the following .",
    "first , we compute the daha - jones polynomials of simple torus knots colored by the 27-dimensional representation of @xmath9 using the approach of @xcite .",
    "these will turn out to have both positive and negative coefficients . to fix this problem and to construct analogues of superpolynomials with positive coefficients",
    ", we will resort to the other method @xcite based on a rich structure of the differentials .",
    "which differentials to expect and how they should act is controlled by deformations of a certain singularity @xcite , which will be yet another new result of this paper .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in section [ hkbps ]",
    ", we will review the physical realization of knot homologies as spaces of bps states in topological string theory . in section [ dahaj ]",
    ", we define the daha - jones polynomials and explain their relationship to torus knot polynomials and homologies .",
    "section [ sec : hyper ] contains our main proposal for @xmath14-hyperpolynomials , as well as three convincing examples . at various intermediate stages in our calculations",
    "we shall need superpolynomials for root systems of cartan types @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the corresponding results are summarized in appendix [ sec : aandd ] and can be found in @xcite .",
    "appendix [ fig ] contains diagrams that depict our examples .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : adj ] we classify the adjacencies ( infinitesimal deformations ) of the singularity @xmath17 and compute the corresponding spectra . as explained there and",
    "in @xcite , deformations of this singularity control which differentials we are to expect from @xmath18 knot homologies .",
    "the results of this analysis are contained in appendix [ app : adj ] .",

    "following @xcite , recall that the chern - simons tqft on a 3-manifold @xmath20 with gauge group @xmath21 at _ level _ @xmath22 is described by the action functional : @xmath23 where @xmath15 is the ( @xmath24-valued ) connection one - form of a principal @xmath21-bundle on @xmath20 .",

    "a state is a d2-brane wrapping @xmath40 , and the bps condition means that it is supported on a a calibrated 2-submanifold of the calabi - yau @xmath38 ( i.e. on a holomorphic curve in @xmath38 ) .",
    "thus , a minimally embedded surface representing @xmath51 gives rise to a component of the hilbert space @xmath52 , i.e. a projective unitary representation of the spatial rotation group , @xmath53 of @xmath54 obtained upon compactification from m - theory .",
    "this representation can be specified by two half - integer charges @xmath55 , which are the weights of the respective @xmath56 representations .",
    "one might be tempted to introduce integers @xmath57 counting these states .",
    "however as one deforms the theory , bps states can combine into non - bps states , so these numbers are not invariant . on the other hand , the index , @xmath58 is well - defined on the moduli of @xmath38 .",
    "the integers @xmath59 are then related by a change of basis for the representation ring of @xmath56 .      for a knot @xmath60 and a representation @xmath2 of @xmath24",

    "see @xcite for details . ]",
    "this led to a conjecture relating the knot homology which categorifies @xmath98 to refined bps degeneracies : @xmath99 for sufficiently large @xmath19 , where @xmath100 is the poincar polynomial for the khovanov - rozansky homology .",
    "more generally , one might view the charges @xmath101 as gradings on the hilbert space @xmath102 and conjecture an isomorphism of graded vector spaces : @xmath103 with @xmath104 .",
    "this new perspective has revealed hidden structures of knot homologies that are manifest in the context of bps states .",
    "in particular , @xmath105 should :    * stabilize in dimension for sufficiently large @xmath19 * be triply - graded , with the additional grading ( corresponding to @xmath48 ) encoding @xmath19-dependence of the homology theory * include the structure of differentials ( c.f . section [ approach ] ) corresponding to wall - crossing behavior of @xmath102    and , in fact , all of these structures were realized in @xcite , where the authors proposed a triply - graded homology theory categorifying the homfly polynomial .",

    "m - theory on an eleven - dimensional space - time incorporates the various ( equivalent ) versions of string / gauge theory and the dualities between them .",
    "the individual theories can then be recovered by integrating out the dependence of m - theory on some portion of the background geometry .",
    "naturally , this framework can offer several equivalent but nontrivially different points of view on the same object . in the case of knot homologies",

    "the reason for this limitation is algebraic from the daha point of view . here",
    "we will shed some light on it geometrically and physically .    in the bps framework",
    ", something special happens when @xmath357 is a torus knot .",

    "_ : @xmath360 that `` counts '' refined bps states in the setup .",
    "from the perspective of @xcite , which is related to the daha approach , this extra variable / grading comes from the symmetry of the algebraic curve , @xmath361 whose intersection with a unit sphere in @xmath362 defines a @xmath124 torus knot @xmath305 .    in either case , the origin of the extra grading ( resp .",
    "variable @xmath363 ) has nothing to do with the choice of homology ( khovanov , colored homfly , or other ) ; it simply comes from a very special choice of the knot ( link ) and exists only for torus knots and links .",

    "we wish to elevate the two - variable daha - jones polynomial @xmath366 , which in general has both positive and negative coefficients , to a three - variable hyperpolynomial @xmath367 with only positive coefficients .",

    "now we consider each of our three examples individually .",

    "fortunately , this case is resolved rather easily by considering the @xmath439 daha - jones polynomial : @xmath440 which has the same dimension as @xmath441 , so we can completely restore the @xmath329-grading by understanding just a single differential to some @xmath442 , if one exists .",
    "indeed , such a differential to @xmath443 is indicated by the expression : @xmath444    @xmath445    observe that the @xmath329-grading of this differential must be @xmath446 if the corresponding specialization is to contain only integer powers of @xmath44 .",

    "in the previous section , we encountered several `` exceptional '' differentials that relate homological invariants of knots colored by representations of exceptional groups to knot homologies associated with classical groups . in this section",
