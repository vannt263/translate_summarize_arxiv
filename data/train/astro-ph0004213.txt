    "observations of galaxies , now extending up to a redshift @xmath7 ( @xcite ) , are starting to provide quantitative information on basic properties - number densities , luminosities , colors , sizes , morphologies , star formation rates ( sfr ) , chemical abundances , dynamics and clustering - over a large span of cosmic time .",
    "these data are beginning to sketch out a direct picture not only of the physical processes taking place in the assembly of the first galaxies , but also of the formation and evolution of large scale structure ( lss ) from the primordial density fluctuations .",
    "quantitative information is now available about the evolution of the neutral hydrogen and metal content of the universe since @xmath8 , the galaxy luminosity function since @xmath9 , the morphology of field and cluster galaxies since @xmath10 . a recent dramatic addition to the general picture",
    "has been the discovery of a large population of actively star - forming galaxies at @xmath11 ( @xcite , hereafter sgda96 ) .",
    "the `` lyman break '' color - selection technique ( @xcite ) has proved a reliable and highly efficient method to select galaxies in large numbers at @xmath12 , providing the first opportunity for statistical studies of evolutionary processes in galaxies beyond @xmath13 .",
    "follow - up spectroscopy of the uv drop - out candidates on the keck telescopes shows most to lie in the expected redshift range , @xmath14 , with successful redshift measurement for more than @xmath15 .",
    "the lyman - break galaxies have spectra resembling those of nearby starburst galaxies , are strongly clustered , with a co - moving correlation length similar to present - day galaxies .",
    "sgda96 inferred typical sfrs of @xmath16 for their galaxies , assuming a critical density universe .",
    "dust corrections based on the uv continuum slope and on near - ir spectroscopy of a few objects suggest values larger by a mean factor of about 7 ( @xcite ) . from the width of saturated interstellar absorption lines ,",
    "sgda96 inferred tentative 1d velocity dispersions in the range @xmath17 , but pettini et al .",
    "( 1998 ) measure in the ir significantly narrower line - widths @xmath18 for the balmer and [ oiii ] emission lines , albeit in a sample of only five objects .",
    "a programme has been started with the eso vlt to study systematically galaxies at @xmath19 with the aim to clarify the earliest phases of the processes leading to the formation of galaxies and lss , reaching a redshift domain where observations are more cosmologically discriminant ( @xcite ) and taking advantage of a wide photometric coverage ( in particular in the ir ) to obtain mass estimates of the detected objects .",
    "we report here the results of pilot observations carried out during the commissioning and the science verification of the fors1 instrument at the vlt - ut1 .",
    "deep multicolor imaging of the hdf - s and axaf deep field has been obtained from hst and from the ground . in particular wfpc2 data , consisting of deep images in the f300w , f450w , f606w and f814w filters ,",
    "cover an area of 4.7 sq.arcmin reaching @xmath20 magnitude limits of 26.8 , 27.7 , 28.2 and 27.7 ( in a 0.2 sq.arcsec area , @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath21 data over an area of 25 sq.arcmin , including the wfpc2 field , have been obtained at the eso 3.5 m new technology telescope ( ntt ) as a part of the eso imaging survey ( eis ) program ( @xcite ) .",
    "they reach @xmath22 limiting magnitudes of @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the eis survey observed also the axaf1 field ( @xcite ) .",
    "25 sq.arcmin were covered in @xmath31 down to @xmath32 27.0 , @xmath33 27 , @xmath34 26.5 , @xmath35 26.5 and @xmath36 26 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 23.5 .",
    "photometric catalogs were derived from lanzetta et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , da costa et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and benoist et al .",
    "lyman - break galaxy candidates were selected by the eis team on the basis of two - color diagrams shortly after the eis observations in order to provide targets for the fors1 commissioning and science verification .",
    "a more refined selection has been carried out after the observations reported here on the basis of the photometric redshift technique described by arnouts et al .",
    "the present data have been retrieved from the eso public archive .",
    "spectroscopic observations were carried out with the fors1 instrument ( @xcite ) in multiple object spectroscopy ( mos ) mode on december 1998 by the fors1 commissioning team and on january 1999 for the fors1 science verification ( see http://www.eso.org/science/ut1sv/ and @xcite ) . in the fors1 mos mode 19 movable slit blade pairs can be placed in a fov of @xmath39 sq.arcmin .",
    "the actual useful field in the direction of the dispersion is somewhat less and depends on the length of the spectra / dispersion . in the present case",
    "the grism i150 was used , providing a useful field of @xmath40 sq.arcmin .",
    "one configuration of slits was observed in the hdf - s and two in the axaf1 .",
    "the journal of the observations is given in table  [ tab : obs ] .",
    "it is interesting to note that two relatively close pairs of galaxies are observed in the axaf field . eisu28/eisu12 and eisb07/eisb02 are separated of only 8.7 and 3.1 proper mpc , respectively . given the small number of objects in the present sample any statistical conclusion is obviously impossible , but it appears natural to link the occurrence of the two pairs to the redshift `` spikes '' observed by steidel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) at @xmath41",
    ". future observations of the remaining high - z galaxy candidates and the extension of the surveyed area ( see http://www.eso.org/science/eis/ ) will make it possible to address also this issue on a more quantitative basis .",
