    "the wavefunction approach has been very successfully applied to study single layer quantum hall ( slqh ) systems at laughlin series @xmath2 @xcite and jain s series at @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "one of main reasons for the success of the wavefunction approach in slqh is that there is a gap in the bulk , suitable wavefunctions @xcite can describe both the groundstate and low energy excitations quite accurately .",
    "its accuracy can be checked easily by exact diagonalization in a finite size system whose size need only go beyond a few magnetic length .",
    "spherical geometry can be used to get rid of edge state effects quite efficiently . in general ,",
    "trial wave function approach is a very robust approach to study slqh and multi - components systems as long as there is a gap in the bulk .",
    "the gap protects the many properties of the system such as charge density distributions and energies from being sensitive to some subtle details of wavefunctions .    however , the situation could be completely different in spin - polarized bilayer quantum hall system ( blqh ) at total filling factor @xmath4 .",
    "this system has been under enormous experimental and theoretical investigations over the last decade @xcite . when the interlayer separation @xmath1 is sufficiently large , the bilayer system decouples into two separate compressible @xmath5 layers @xcite .",
    "however , when @xmath1 is smaller than a critical distance @xmath6 , even in the absence of interlayer tunneling , the system undergoes a quantum phase transition into a novel spontaneous interlayer coherent incompressible phase which is an excitonic superfluid state ( esf ) in the pseudospin channel @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "halperin proposed the @xmath0 wavefunction to describe the groundstate of the esf state .",
    "starting from the @xmath0 wavefunction , using various methods , several authors @xcite discovered a neutral gapless mode ( ngm ) with linear dispersion relation @xmath7 and that there is a finite temperature kosterlitz - thouless ( kt ) phase transition associated with this ngm . by treating the two layer indices as two pseudo - spin indices , girvin , macdonald and collaborators mapped the bilayer system into a easy plane quantum ferromagnet ( epqfm ) @xcite ( which is equivalent to the esf ) and explored many rich and interesting physical phenomena in this system .    as first pointed out in @xcite",
    ", the @xmath0 wavefunction may not be qualitatively good at finite @xmath1 , because @xmath0 is a broken symmetry state in a direction in @xmath8 plane of isotropic ferromagnet at @xmath9 instead of a easy - plane ferromagnet at finite @xmath1 .",
    "the ngm is a hallmark of the interlayer coherent quantum hall state .",
    "its existence is expected to dramatically alter the properties of the wavefunctions of the ground state , quasi - hole and quasi - particle . in @xcite ,",
    "g. s. jeon and one of the authors studied properties of essentially all the known trial wavefunctions of ground state and excitations in bilayer quantum hall systems at the total filling factor @xmath10 . the results indicated that qualitatively good trial wave functions for the ground state and the excitations of the interlayer coherent bilayer quantum hall system at finite @xmath1 are still not available and searching for them remains an important open problem . specifically , they investigated the properties of the quasi - hole wave function , meron wavefunction and a pair of meron wavefunction built on @xmath0 state which have superscripts `` prime '' in this paper : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the halperin s @xmath0 wavefunction : @xmath13 where @xmath14 in the balanced case and @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the coordinates in layer 1 and layer 2 respectively . in the following ,",
    "we suppress the exponential factor .",
    "these quasi - hole and meron wavefunctions differ only by `` normalization factors '' .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the normalization factor @xmath17 is accurate only at long distance limit @xmath18 limit . near the origin , the `` meron '' and the \" quasi - hole  have similar behaviors .",
    "normalization factors have been shown not to be important in single layer quantum hall ( slqh ) systems . however , as shown in @xcite , they make a dramatic difference in blqh .",
    "although the smallest meron has a localized charge @xmath19 and logarithmically divergent energy , the charge of the quasi - hole excitation extends over the whole system and its energy also diverges linearly as the area of the system size .",
    "this indicates that the quasi - hole wavefunction is not a good trial wavefunction for any low energy excitations .",
    "the meron wavefunction is not a good trial wavefunction either , because it ignores the strong interlayer correlations @xcite .",
    "it was found the energy of the possible wavefunction of a pair of merons in eqn.[prime ] increases quadratically @xmath20 instead of logarithmically as the separation of the pair increases .",
    "all the results achieved in @xcite indicate that qualitatively good trial wave functions in the interlayer coherent bilayer quantum hall system at finite @xmath1 , both for ground state and excitations , are still unknown and searching for them remains an important open problem .",
    "so the wavefunction approach to blqh is much more difficult and far less powerful in blqh than in slqh .",
    "fortunately , effective theory approaches such as epqfm approach @xcite and composite boson theory approach @xcite circumvent this difficulty associated with the unknown wavefunction at any finite @xmath1 and are very effective to bring out most of the interesting phenomena in the pseudo - spin sector in this system .",
    "in fact , all these effective theories start from the insights gained from halperin s @xmath0 wavefunction which is exact at @xmath9 .    in a series of papers @xcite ,",
    "one of the authors developed a systematic composite boson approach to study balanced and im - balanced bi - layer quantum hall systems in rather details .",
    "the theory puts spin and charge degree freedoms in the same footing , explicitly bring out the spin - charge connection and classify all the possible excitations in a systematic way .",
    "then he pushed the theory further to understand novel phases and quantum phase transitions as the distance between the two layers is changed .",
    "he found that starting from the well studied excitonic superfluid ( esf ) state , as distance increases , the instability driven by magneto - roton minimum collapsing at a finite wavevector in the pseudo - spin channel leads to the formation of a pseudo - spin density wave ( psdw ) at some intermediate distances .",
    "he constructed a quantum ginsburg - landau theory to study the transition from the excitonic superfluid ( esf ) to the psdw and analyze in detail the properties of the psdw .",
    "he showed that a square lattice is the favorite lattice and the correlated hopping of vacancies in the active and passive layers in the psdw state leads to very large and temperature dependent drag observed in the experimental . in the presence of disorders ,",
    "the properties of the psdw are consistent with all the experimental observations @xcite in the intermediate distances .",
    "further experimental implications of the psdw are given .",
    "then he extended the composite boson theory to study slightly im - balanced blqh . in the global @xmath21 symmetry breaking excitonic superfluid side , as the imbalance increases , the system supports continuously changing fractional charges . in the translational symmetry",
    "breaking psdw side , there are two quantum phase transitions from the commensurate psdw to an in - commensurate psdw and then to the excitonic superfluid state .",
    "these results explained the experimental observations in @xcite very nicely .",
    "the author found that the theory can be easily extended to study some additional interesting phenomena in trilayer quantum hall systems @xcite .",
    "it was concluded in @xcite that field theory approaches are much more powerful in blqh than in slqh .",
    "obviously , the cb theory circumvent this difficulty associated with the unknown wavefunction at any finite @xmath1 and is used to achieve all these interesting and important results at two different distance regimes without knowing the precise wavefunctions for the ground state and excitations .",
    "it would be interesting to use the cb theory to address the important and outstanding problem avoided in @xcite and in all the other pervious work that finding the good ground state and low energy excited wavefunction for blqh at any finite @xmath1 . in slqh , the cb theory developed in @xcite was used to re - derive the already well known laughlin s wavefunctions for ground state and quasihole at @xmath2 . as said previously",
    ", the gap in the bulk protects the properties of the system such as charge density distributions and energies from being sensitive to some subtle details of wavefunctions .",
    "here we are facing a more difficult and interesting task : to derive these unknown wavefunctions at finite @xmath1 .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as the following . in sec .",
    "ii , in order to be self - contained , we review briefly the cb approach and its dual action developed in @xcite which are needed to derive the wavefunctions in the following sections . in sec .",

    "ii , we derive the ground state wavefunction which is different from the @xmath0 wavefunction at any finite @xmath22 . in sec.iv , using the dual action presented in sec .",
    "ii , we derive the quasi - hole wavefunction and compare it with the `` quasi - hole '' and `` meron '' wavefunction built on @xmath0 wavefunction listed in eqn.[prime ] . in sec.v , we derive a pair of meron wavefunction with charge @xmath23 and compare it with the `` pair meron '' wavefunction built on @xmath0 listed in eqn .",
    "[ prime ] . in sec.vi , we look at the instability in the ground state wavefunction as distance approaches @xmath6 . finally , we reach conclusions in sec .",
    "some caveats related to the lowest landau level ( lll ) projection of the wavefunctions are also pointed out .",
    "we note that there is also an alternative approach in @xcite .",
    "in this section , we briefly review the formalism developed in @xcite which is needed to derive the wavefunctions in the following sections . consider a bi - layer system with @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) electrons in left ( right ) layer and with interlayer distance @xmath1 in the presence of magnetic field @xmath26 ( fig.1 ) : @xmath27 where electrons have _ bare _ mass @xmath28 and carry charge @xmath29 , @xmath30 are electron operators in top and bottom layers , @xmath31 are normal ordered electron densities on each layer .",

    "@xmath38 is the total density of the bi - layer system .",
    "note that this transformation treats both @xmath39 and @xmath40 on the same footing .",
    "this is reasonable only when the distance between the two layers is sufficiently small .",
    "it can be shown that @xmath41 satisfies all the boson commutation relations .",
    "we can transform the hamiltonian eqn.[first ] into the lagrangian in coulomb gauge : @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",

    "note that if setting @xmath48 , then the above equation is identical to a single layer with spin in the absence of zeeman term , so the lagrangian has a @xmath49 pseudo - spin symmetry .",
    "the @xmath50 term breaks the @xmath49 symmetry into @xmath21 symmetry . in the blqh at finite @xmath1 ,",
    "@xmath51 , so the system is in the easy - plane limit .",

    ", the instability happens at @xmath168 where @xmath50 becomes negative , but the spin stiffness @xmath169 remains _ non - critical _ through the esf to psdw transition . as @xmath170 , the sum over @xmath85 in eqn.[spinw ] becomes dominated by the regime @xmath171 .",
    "when @xmath172 , eqn.[spinw ] breaks down .",
    "a new wavefunction to describe the translational symmetry breaking psdw state is needed .",
    "some trial wavefunctions are proposed in @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to derive the new wavefunction of the psdw state from the cb theory .",
    "blqh differs from the slqh by its symmetry breaking ground state and associated neutral gapless mode in the pseudo - spin sector .",
    "due to the gapless mode in the bulk , the groundstate wavefunctions could be considerably different from the well known @xmath0 wave function @xcite",
    ". the low energy excited states could also be sensitive to details such as normalization factors .",
    "one important problem is to find good trial wavefunctions for the ground state and low energy excited states .",
    "we investigated this important open problem from the cb theory developed previously in @xcite to study blqh systematically .",
    "we derived the ground state , quasi - hole and a pair of quasi - hole wavefunctions from cb theory and its dual action by the following procedures : we first performed the singular gauge transformation eqn.[singb ] to transform a fermionic problem into a bosonic problem , then found that all the wavefunctions in the bosonic picture are always the product of two parts , one part in the charge sector and the other in the spin sector .",
    "all the distance dependence are encoded in the spin part , while all the excitations only happen in the charge sector . after transforming back to the original electron picture by proper inverse sgt s",
    ", we get the final wavefunctions in the electron coordinates .",
    "we found that the inverse sgt s are different in ground state , meron and a pair of merons . by considering the differences carefully , we derived all these wavefunctions in the original electronic picture a systematical way .    at any finite @xmath1 ,",
    "the ground state wavefunction in the charge sector is the same as the @xmath0 wavefunction , while that in the spin sector is highly nontrivial due to the gapless mode .",
    "so the total groundstate wavefunction differs from the well known @xmath0 wavefunction at any finite @xmath1 . in the bosonic picture , when inserting vortices in the ground state , the spin part remains the same due to the lack of cs term in this sector , while the charge part changes accordingly .",
    "however , due to the insertion of vortices , in order to recover the original electronic problem , the inverse sgt differs from that in the ground state . after transforming back to the original electron problem by the inverse sgt s , we showed that the quasi - hole and a pair of quasi - holes wavefunctions contain non - trivial normalization factors as shown in [ qh],[pair ] .",
    "we expect that the quasi - hole and pair wave function not only has logarithmically divergent energy , well localized charge distribution , but also correct interlayer correlations .",
    "it is important to test these trial wavefunctions by qmc simulations performed in @xcite for the states listed in eqn .",
    "[ prime ] .",
    "we also investigated the instability encoded in the spin sector which leads to the psdw solid formation proposed in @xcite . because the cb field theory has been used to describe the tri - layer quantum hall systems very successfully , the analysis in this paper can be easily extended to derive the wavefunctions in the tlqh @xcite .",
    "it is well known that cb approach is not a lowest landau level ( lll ) approach @xcite , it is very difficult to incorporate the lll projection into the cb approach .",
    "this may be partially responsible for the spin part of the ground state wavefunction eqn .",
    "[ spinw1 ] not in the lll level .",
    "but as explained below eqn.[totalg ] , this should not be too worrisome , because eqn.[spinw1 ] works only in long distance anyway .",
    "as shown in @xcite and listed in eqn.[prime ] , in the long wavelength limit , the meron wavefunction s normalization factor contains modulus which is not in the lll either .",
    "how to getting precise short distance behaviors of these wavefunctions from the cb theory remains an open problem .",
