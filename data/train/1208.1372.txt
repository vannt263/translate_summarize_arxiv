    "a _ lroth quartic _ is a plane quartic containing the ten vertices of a complete _ pentalateral _ , like in figure 1 .",
    "the pentalateral is inscribed in the quartic , and ( equivalently ) the quartic circumscribes the pentalateral .",
    "the lroth quartics attracted a lot of attention in the classical literature , because they show a `` poristic '' phenomenon , namely `` the fallacy of constant counting '' , to use the words of white and miller , @xcite .    indeed , lroth was the first to observe , in 1868 , that when a plane quartic circumscribes one pentalateral , it also circumscribes infinitely many other pentalaterals , which is not expected by a naive dimension count ( see @xcite pag .",
    "348 ) . as a consequence of lroth s result ,",
    "lroth quartics are not dense in the space of quartics , but they fill an open subset of a hypersurface of @xmath0 . the equation of this hypersurface is called the _ lroth invariant _ and , to the best of our knowledge , it is still unknown .",
    "this hypersurface consists entirely of quartics , so the limits ( when the pentalateral degenerates ) are also called nowadays lroth quartics .",
    "lroth found a one dimensional family of inscribed pentalaterals , _ all tangent to the same conic_. there are examples with more families of pentalaterals ( see  4 ) , and so more conics .",
    "each family defines a particular even theta characteristic , called _",
    "pentalateral theta_. let @xmath1 be the number of pentalateral theta on a general lroth quartic .",
    "it is a well - established fact , already known to classical geometers , that the lroth invariant has degree @xmath2 ( see the proof of theorem [ morley ] ) .",
    "the classical study on lroth quartics culminated in 1919 in morley s proof@xcite that the lroth invariant has degree @xmath3 .",
    "we reviewed this lovely proof in a joint paper with e. sernesi@xcite , and we refer to @xcite for more information , including the role of lroth quartics in vector bundle theory . in equivalent way , morley proved that @xmath4 , that is that for the general lroth quartic there is a unique family of inscribed pentalaterals , all tangent to the same conic , which is uniquely determined .",
    "we emphasized this point of view , even if it was not focal in @xcite , because it is the starting point of our current paper .",
    "we try to answer to the following    * question : * given an explicit quartic curve given by a homogeneous quartic polynomial in three variables , how can one detect if it is lroth ?",
    "the answer should follow from the explicit expression of the lroth invariant . since",
    "its expression is unclear , we have to look for alternative roads .    for this purpose , we review a construction due to white and miller@xcite .",
    "they construct , for any plane quartic curve @xmath5 , a covariant quartic 4-fold @xmath6 in the space @xmath7 of conics .",
    "they proved that when @xmath5 is lroth with a pentalateral theta corresponding to the conic @xmath8 , the point @xmath9 is a singular point of @xmath6 .",
    "white - miller s aim was to use this property to characterize the lroth property , with the hope that the discriminant of @xmath6 could be a power of the lroth invariant .",
    "unfortunately , this attempt fails , because the discriminant of @xmath6 vanishes identically .",
    "indeed we prove    [ 28bit ] for the general plane quartic @xmath5 , @xmath6 has always @xmath10 singular points corresponding to the @xmath10 bitangents ( odd theta characteristics ) of @xmath5 .",
    "this theorem owes a lot to the computer experiments performed with macaulay2@xcite .",
    "the failure of white - miller s hope is balanced by two remarks , which give , in some sense , a reprise to that hope , and show that the quartic @xmath6 is an interesting object .",
    "the first one is that theorem [ 28bit ] gives a way to compute the ideal of the bitangents , and it gives at once the information about the bitangent lines and the tangency points .",
    "the second remark is that it allows one to partially answer our question of how to detect if a quartic is lroth . indeed , with macaulay2 , it is possible to quickly compute the singular locus of @xmath6 , given any @xmath11 .",
    "the following outcomes are possible    @xmath12(i ) if the singular locus of @xmath6 has dimension zero and degree @xmath10 , then @xmath5 _ is not lroth_. this outcome is the general one .",
    "@xmath12(ii ) if the singular locus of @xmath6 has dimension zero and degree @xmath13 , the `` extra '' point can be found by quotient over the ideal generated by the cubic hypersurface of singular conics .",
    "when it remains a single point , it corresponds to a smooth conic . in this case , after the check of a mild open condition ( see  [ algorithm ] ) , @xmath5 _ is lroth and the conic corresponds to the unique pentalateral theta_. this outcome is found for the general lroth curve @xmath5 . in this case",
    "the explicit equation of all the pentalaterals inscribed can be found .",
    "@xmath12(iii ) if the outcome is different from ( i ) and ( ii ) a further analysis is necessary .",
    "the double irreducible conics , which are not lroth ( see the proof of prop . 4.1 in @xcite ) , lie in this third category .",
    "if @xmath5 is a double irreducible conic , then the singular locus of @xmath6 consists of a surface of degree @xmath14 , whose general point is a singular conic , plus a curve of degree @xmath15 , whose general point corresponds to a smooth conic .",
    "also the desmic quartics , which are lroth and have at least @xmath16 families of inscribed pentalateral ( see @xcite pag .",
    "367 ) , lie in this third category . when @xmath5 is desmic , @xmath6 is non reduced and it is a double hyperquadric in @xmath7 ( see section [ appendix ] ) .    as a consequence",
    "computer - aided proof that the lroth invariant has degree @xmath3_. this proof is conceptually simpler than the two known proofs , respectively by morley@xcite and by lepotier - tikhomirov@xcite , but it can not be concluded without the help of a computer .",
    "the material collected here owes a lot to the many thorough discussions i had on the topic with edoardo sernesi during the preparation of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank edoardo for his insight and method .",
