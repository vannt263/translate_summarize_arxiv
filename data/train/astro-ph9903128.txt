    "solar prominence oscillations have been the subject of both observational and theoretical papers for the past 35 years .",
    "one of the first studies ( ramsey & smith 1966 ) concerned observations of global oscillations of disk filaments with periods of @xmath0 to @xmath1 , that were interpreted by hyder ( 1966 ) as predominantly vertical motions and by kleczek & kuperus ( 1969 ) as predominantly horizontal motions .",
    "tsubaki ( 1988 ) published a review on oscillation studies of limb prominences .",
    "most of these oscillations pertain to doppler shifts in the spectra of part of a prominence .",
    "the associated mass flows are essentially parallel to the photosphere , both longitudinal and transverse to the prominence main axis .",
    "the observed periods range from @xmath2 to @xmath3 , with velocity amplitudes in the range of 0.23 km / s .",
    "zhang et al .   ( 1991 ) , zhang & engvold ( 1991 ) and thompson & schmieder ( 1991 ) studied disk filaments and found locally periods of @xmath4 , with velocity amplitudes of @xmath5 km / s .",
    "as in the observations by ramsey & smith these oscillations may have both horizontal and vertical components .",

    "these observations all confirm and extend previous results .",
    "there is now enough evidence to suggest the following tentative classification for prominence oscillations ( see also bashkirtsev & mashnich 1993 ) .",
    "* very short periods : @xmath6 ( balthasar et al .   1993 ) , perhaps due to fast waves propagating along flux tubes ( roberts et al .   1984 ) .",
    "* short periods : @xmath7 , at least some of which are related to photospheric or chromospheric forcing with periods of @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( balthasar et al .",

    "we point out that the longest data set is about 7 hours long and the best temporary resolution is a couple of seconds .    in particular the observed @xmath12 eigenmodes are interesting as they are damped and thus loose energy , perhaps due to some interaction with the ambient corona ( ramsey & smith 1966 , kleczek & kuperus 1969 )",
    ". typically , the quality factor @xmath13 , with @xmath14 the damping time of the oscillation .",
    "this implies that three to four oscillations can be observed after the impulsive perturbation of the prominence .",
    "understanding the damping mechanisms will give more insight in prominence dynamics and may yield an extra diagnostic tool for prominence and ambient coronal plasma parameters .",
    "prominence oscillations have been theoretically modelled by many authors . some model",
    "the prominence as a harmonic oscillator with an ad - hoc damping term : hyder ( 1966 ) used viscous effects , kleczek & kuperus ( 1969 ) used emission of sound waves , van den oord & kuperus ( 1992 ) , schutgens ( 1997a ) and van den oord et al .",
    "( 1998 ) used emission of alfvn waves .",

    "1992 , 1993 , oliver & ballester 1995 , 1996 , joarder & roberts 1992ab , 1993 , joarder et al .",
    "generally the latter approach yields marginally stable oscillations ( no damping ) , although joarder & roberts ( 1992a ) and joarder et al .   ( 1997 ) claim that leaky waves are possible solutions to their equations .",
    "apparently , little effort has gone into studying the damping mechanisms themselves .",
    "schutgens ( 1997ab ) and van den oord et al .",
    "( 1998 ) recently studied the global equilibrium of prominences treating the evolution of the magnetic field in a self - consistent way .",
    "the equation of motion for the prominence ( approximated as a line current ) was solved simultaneously with the maxwell equations for the electro - magnetic fields .",
    "their results show that the alfvn travel time between prominence and photosphere @xmath15 is an important time scale of the system . in particular ,",
    "van den oord et al .   found that it is only possible to obtain _ stable _ prominence equilibria by taking damping mechanisms into account .",
    "hence , damping is not just necessary to describe prominence oscillations quantitatively correct , but it is an essential ingredient of a prominence equilibrium .    in this paper , we study prominence oscillations , and in particular the effect of the ambient coronal plasma on the prominence motion .",
    "we use the versatile advection code ( vac ) to solve numerically the isothermal mhd equations in two dimensions .",
    "vac has been developed by g. tth ( 1996 , 1997 ) and is capable of solving a variety of hydrodynamical and magneto - hydrodynamical problems in one , two and three dimensions using a host of numerical methods . in sect .",

    "all dimensional variables in this paper are in rational mksa units , unless stated differently .",
    "we briefly recapitulate the line current approximation for prominence equilibrium and dynamics",
    ". this approximation will serve as a guideline for discussing our numerical results .",
    "the prominence is approximated by a straight , infinitely thin and long , line current @xmath16 at a height @xmath17 parallel to the photosphere . along the prominence",
    "we assume invariance .",
    "the effect of the massive photosphere on the prominence magnetic field is modelled through a mirror current @xmath18 at depth @xmath19 below the surface of the sun ( kuperus & raadu 1974 , van tend & kuperus 1978 , kaastra 1985 , schutgens 1997a ) .",
    "the momentum equations governing the global prominence dynamics are ( ignoring gravity ) @xmath20 -\\nu_x   \\dot{x } , \\nonumber \\\\   \\sigma \\ddot{y } & = & i_0 \\left [ b_{\\rm mir}^x(x , y ) + b_{\\rm cor}^x(x , y ) \\right ] -\\nu_y   \\dot{y}. \\label{eq : eqofmot}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is the longitudinal mass density of the oscillating structure , @xmath22 is the coronal arcade field in which the prominence is located and @xmath23 is the field due to the mirror current .",
    "the interaction between the _ moving _ filament and the ambient coronal plasma gives rise to viscous effects ( hyder 1966 ) and emission of magneto - acoustic waves ( kleczek & kuperus 1967 , van den oord & kuperus 1992 ) that act as damping mechanisms .",
    "these are heuristically modelled through @xmath24 and @xmath25 , damping constants that are in reality determined by the flow field around the prominence .",
    "since viscosity of the coronal plasma is negligible , we concentrate on the emission of magneto - acoustic waves .",
    "an approximation for the damping constants can be found by considering linear motion with constant velocity @xmath26 of a solid body through a homogeneous plasma . if the cross section of the body perpendicular to its motion is @xmath27 , the body transfers @xmath28 momentum per unit time onto the plasma ( landau & lifschitz 1989 , p. 256 ) .",
    "here @xmath29 is the characteristic wave speed of the plasma with density @xmath30 .",
    "a factor @xmath31 is added since both the front- and backside of the object transfer momentum . hence , the damping constants have the form @xmath32 the coronal arcade is generated by a magnetic line dipole @xmath33 , a depth @xmath34 below the photosphere @xmath35 the mirror current s field at the location of the filament , in the quasi - stationary approach , is given by @xmath36 the fact that @xmath37 is a direct consequence of the mirror current mirroring the motion of the filament ( to conserve the photospheric flux ) and the quasi - stationary field assumption .",
    "when this assumption is dropped and the magnetic fields evolve dynamically according to maxwell s laws , the expressions for @xmath38 become far more complicated and in particular @xmath39 ( schutgens 1997a , van den oord et al .   1998 ) .",
    "assuming quasi - stationary field evolution ( @xmath40 ) , prominences are in stable equilibrium provided they are on the symmetry axis of the arcade ( @xmath41 ) and at a height @xmath42 .",
    "furthermore , the current should attain the value @xmath43 note that this prominence equilibrium has an inverse polarity topology ( see also fig.[fi : topol ] ) .",
    "in fact , it corresponds to a kuperus - raadu prominence ( see van tend & kuperus 1978 ) .",
    "if one linearizes around this equilibrium , the equations of vertical and horizontal motion decouple ( due to the symmetry of the coronal field ) and both have the form of the familiar damped harmonic oscillator .",
    "the solutions are oscillations , characterized by frequencies @xmath44 and damping rates @xmath45 : @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the quasi - stationary frequencies of the system _ without _ damping .",
    "if one drops the quasi - stationary assumption , the same equilibrium is found , but its stability then also depends on the value of the coronal alfvn speed . in general , the solutions to the equations , which are again decoupled , are damped or growing ( ! ) harmonic oscillations ( schutgens 1997ab , van den oord et al .",
    "we solve the time - dependent ideal isothermal mhd equations in two dimensions using the versatile advection code ( vac ) developed by one of us ( g. tth ) .",
    "descriptions of this numerical code can be found in tth ( 1996 , 1997 ) .",
    "the photosphere coincides with the @xmath41 plane . in conservative form the equations for density @xmath49 , mass flux @xmath50 and magnetic field @xmath51 are ( @xmath52 is the thermal pressure ) @xmath53 note that we ignore gravity ( see sect .",
    "[ se : summary ] for a discussion ) .",
    "these equations must be solved together with an equation of state @xmath54 and the condition that @xmath55 .",
    "here @xmath56 is the sound speed , a free parameter of the system , which is constant throughout the numerical domain .",
    "the magnetic field unit is chosen such that the current density satisfies @xmath57 ( i.e. @xmath58 ) , all other units are rational mksa .",
    "the equations are discretized on the same grid and solved using a fct ( flux corrected transport ) scheme .",
    "since there are no discontinuities in the solution , fct performs well .",
    "similar results can be obtained using a tvd ( total variation diminishing ) lax - friedrichs scheme but , for the problem at hand , fct is more efficient . for a comparison of different methods",
    "see tth & odstril ( 1996 ) .",
    "a projection scheme ( brackbill & barnes 1980 ) is used to keep the magnetic divergence small .",
    "typically @xmath59 , where @xmath60 and @xmath61 are characteristic strength and length scale of the magnetic field .",
    "we use a cartesian grid of @xmath62 cells ( @xmath63 m by @xmath64 m ) that is strongly distorted , with the highest resolution at the location of the prominence and a much smaller resolution near the coronal edges of the computational domain ( see fig .  [",
    "fi : grid ] ) . in a region surrounding the actual prominence",
    "the grid spacing is constant .",
    "typically , the grid spacing increases with 10% from cell to cell outside this region . as a consequence",
    "the difference in resolution at the prominence and at the far coronal edges can amount to a factor 100 ( see fig .",
    "[ fi : gridspacing ] ) . near the boundaries",
    "the grid spacing is again kept constant .",
    "the boundary conditions are implemented using two layers of ghost cells around the physical part of the grid .",
    "the actual boundary is located between the inner ghost cells and the outermost cells of the physical grid .",
    "the solution on the physical part of the grid can be advanced using fluxes calculated from the ghost and physical cells around the boundary .",
    "the prescription for the ghost cells depends on the specific boundary condition and may be constant or depend on the solution in the adjacent physical cells .",
    "the photosphere is much denser than the corona and is therefore strongly reflecting : there should be no mass flux or energy flux across it .",
    "we therefore choose the plasma density symmetric around the photospheric boundary ( @xmath65 ) and vertical momentum anti - symmetric ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "the other momentum component @xmath67 is chosen anti - symmetric as well , since we assume no flows along the photosphere ( ` no slip ' condition ) .",
    "the magnetic field is tied to the dense photosphere and the photospheric flux ( @xmath68 ) is conserved .",
    "magnetic waves should be reflected .",
    "the initial field solution is stored in computer memory and subtracted from the advanced solution .",
    "the ` linearized ' field solution thus obtained is chosen to be symmetric or anti - symmetric in the photospheric boundary : @xmath69 and @xmath70 . in this way",
    ", one obtains a good reflection of waves for small perturbations .",
    "the other ( coronal ) boundaries do not coincide with a physical boundary and should be as open as possible . since any choice of boundary condition will always generate some reflection , which we want to avoid , we decided to place these boundaries at large distances from the prominence so that twice the wave crossing time ( prominence  coronal boundary ) is longer than the simulation time .",
    "also , the coarsening of the grid damps the outward moving waves and the reflection is minimized .",
    "at the location of the coronal boundaries we prescribe fixed @xmath71 , but copy @xmath49 and @xmath50 from the physical part of the grid to the ghost cells .",
    "the initial configuration is a superposition of three different analytical mhd equilibria .",
    "the global coronal structure is a potential arcade , given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : arcadefield ] ) .",
    "since we ignore gravity , the plasma density in this arcade is constant . to this equilibrium",
    "we add the fields and plasma densities of two current carrying flux tubes , one above , the other below the photosphere .",
    "both flux tubes are located on the polarity inversion line of the arcade .",
    "the flux tube at a height @xmath17 _ above _ the photosphere represents the prominence .",
    "its total axial current is @xmath72 .",
    "the flux tube @xmath19 _ below _ the photosphere represents the mirror current and has a total current @xmath18 .",
    "the flux tube equilibrium is derived starting from a current profile ( see also forbes 1990 ) @xmath73    the radius of the tube @xmath74 is larger than @xmath75 , the size of the region in which the current density drops off to zero .",
    "the total axial current in the flux tube is @xmath76 and the azimuthal field component follows from stokes theorem @xmath77    the current is confined to @xmath78 . beyond this range ,",
    "the field is potential .",
    "the pinching field @xmath79 has to be balanced by gas pressure @xmath80 where it is assumed that the flux tube proper carries no mass outside @xmath81 .",
    "the longitudinal mass density of the flux tube equals @xmath82 while the total longitudinal mass density of the prominence is ( due to the superposition of equilibria ) @xmath83    in a global sense , equilibrium is obtained when eq .",
    "( [ eq : equilibrium ] ) is satisfied .",
    "however , especially near the outer edge of the prominence no force balance exists .",
    "it is necessary to let the initial configuration relax to a numerical equilibrium , before studying oscillations .",
    "as it turns out , force imbalance is mostly due to the gradients in density and field _ within _ the flux tube ( i.e. numerical discretization errors ) and a stable equilibrium is readily obtained . to prevent the flows at the outer edge of the prominence from becoming too large during the relaxation phase , and cause an instability , an artificial damping term @xmath84 is used .",
    "this term is switched off during subsequent oscillation studies .",
    "once a numerical equilibrium has been found , we perturb it and study the resulting oscillations . in all cases ,",
    "the perturbation is caused by instantaneously adding momentum to the prominence .",
    "to check the validity of our results , we performed oscillation simulations for the same physical parameters , but different numerical parameters .",
    "in particular we changed the grid resolution ( @xmath85 or @xmath86 m inside the prominence ) , the amount of stretching of the grid ( 0% , 5% and 10% ) , the duration of the relaxation ( @xmath87 or @xmath88 s ) and the constraint on @xmath89 ( @xmath90 ) and found that the results are similar .",
    "using @xmath91 stretching implies that the grid is rather small in its physical size , due to computational limitations .",
    "reflection at the coronal boundaries will then limit the usefulness of the simulations to the first @xmath92 s for @xmath93 kg / m@xmath94 .",
    "in addition , the effect of the photospheric boundary condition was studied .",
    "a perfectly reflecting photosphere does not allow a net momentum or energy flux . also , the magnetic flux distribution is constant .",
    "the implementation of the photospheric boundary conditions automatically ensures zero momentum flux and constant magnetic flux .",
    "however , since the magnetic field is not symmetric in @xmath41 , a small poynting flux is present . consider a box - shaped surface around the prominence",
    "the coronal ` walls ' of this surface each have a shortest distance to the prominence center of @xmath95 m ( see fig .",
    "[ fi : betava ] ) and reach down to the photosphere , along which we close the box . the total time - averaged poynting flux through the photosphere is typically @xmath96 times smaller than the coronal flux , for vertical oscillations .",
    "for horizontal oscillations , the coronal flux is small in essence ( due to the anti - symmetry ) and provides no reasonable yardstick ( of course one could still use the flux through a single ` wall ' , but this is bound to lead to similar results as for vertical oscillations ) .",
    "furthermore , we point out that the equilibrium height of the prominence during oscillation studies does not change by more than 0.06% , and often even less .",
    "we therefore feel that the photospheric boundary is sufficiently well represented in our numerical boundary conditions .",
    "before we study oscillations in prominences , we first have to compute a stable , numerical prominence equilibrium .",

    "we assume that the cross sections for both directions have the same @xmath187 dependence , but given the azimuthal invariance of the prominence flux tube this is probably a fair approximation .",
    "now @xmath185 and @xmath186 are equal to either the slow cusp speed @xmath188 , the alfvn speed @xmath189 or the fast speed @xmath190 . in a low plasma-@xmath166 environment",
    ", the cusp speed equals the sound speed @xmath56 , while the fast speed equals the alfvn speed @xmath189 .",
    "hence @xmath191 or @xmath192 depending on whether slow , alfvn or fast wave emission prevails in a certain direction . from the data , we find @xmath193 which strongly suggests that slow wave emission damps horizontal motions , while alfvn or fast wave emission damps vertical motions . since the prominence moves vertically to the field lines in the latter case , fast waves are more likely .",
    "the conclusions regarding damping mechanisms can be substantiated further by comparing the relevant time scales for horizontal and vertical oscillations independently to the eqs.([eq : hordamp ] ) and  ( [ eq : vertdamp ] ) ( see fig .  [ fi : wave ] ) .    for the mass",
    ", we use the effective longitudinal mass density @xmath194 as obtained previously . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : damping ] ) and either eq .",
    "( [ eq : hordamp ] ) or([eq : vertdamp ] ) we find @xmath195 the left - hand - side of which can be fitted to @xmath196 . here",
    "@xmath27 is the cross - section perpendicular to the direction of motion . for horizontal oscillations we find @xmath197 , and @xmath198 m@xmath154",
    "this suggests excitation of slow waves by horizontal motion of the prominence . for vertical oscillations",
    "@xmath199 which suggests excitation of fast waves by vertical motion of the prominence .",
    "since the alfvn speed varies in space , it is not possible to derive a value of @xmath27 from the product of @xmath200 .",
    "the cross - section @xmath27 for the horizontal damping mechanism yields a dimension for the oscillating body smaller than the extended size @xmath201 as obtained from the horizontal periods .",
    "this may be due to field line curvature . since the size of the oscillating `",
    "solid ' body is determined by the field topology , lorentz forces cause the waves that carry away momentum . however ,",
    "lorentz forces only act perpendicular to , not parallel to the field lines .",
    "thus only perturbations of magnetic field with a strong vertical component can excite horizontally travelling waves .",
    "we have made a numerical investigation of prominence oscillations , by solving the isothermal mhd equations in two dimensions .",
    "first we computed a prominence equilibrium that is very similar to the kuperus - raadu ( inverse polarity ) topology .",
    "however , in our numerical equilibrium the prominence is not infinitely thin , but instead well resolved . from this equilibrium ,",
    "we derived other equilibria with different coronal plasma densities .",
    "we then perturbed the system by instantaneously adding momentum to the prominence mass and followed the ensuing oscillations .",
    "the dependence of the characteristic time scales ( periods and damping times ) on the coronal plasma density was analyzed in terms of a solid body moving through a fluid . to our knowledge",
    "this is the first attempt at numerically simulating prominence oscillations .    in our numerical model",
    ", we ignored the effects of gravity and thermodynamics , for the sake of clarity and practicality .",
    "also , up to now the numerical boundary conditions we are using do not seem to allow a stable gravitationally stratified corona .",
    "we believe , however , that gravity and thermodynamics do not contribute significantly to the physics of the system .",
    "gravity is of small consequence for the equilibrium of a kuperus - raadu prominence as detailed by van tend & kuperus ( 1978 ) .",
    "force balance is due to two lorentz forces : one due to the coronal magnetic arcade , the other due to the photospheric flux conservation .",
    "the gravitational force can be ignored when describing global equilibrium .",
    "furthermore , the scale height of a corona of @xmath159 k is @xmath202 m , which is larger than the typical vertical size of prominences .",
    "the inclusion of gravity would change the appearance of the prominence into a slab , with prominennce matter accumulating in the pre - existing ( ! ) dips in the magnetic field lines . the magnetic field configuration would hardly change .",
    "likewise , the absence of a thermally structured corona and prominence seems of only minor influence .",
    "the most important effect would be that a cool prominence will be heavier than a prominence of coronal temperatures . in our model",
    "this is balanced by the absence of a longitudinal field . as a consequence ,",
    "the pinching effect of the azimuthal prominence field has to be balanced by gas pressure only ( in real prominences the longitudinal field pressure contributes significantly ) . the total longitudinal mass density of our prominence ( @xmath203 kg / m@xmath94 ) agrees well with that of a slab of height @xmath204 m , width @xmath205 m and density @xmath206 kg / m@xmath94 .",
    "oliver & ballester ( 1996 ) studied the influence of the prominence - corona transition region ( characterized by strong temperature gradients ) and found that it mainly influences the prominence internal oscillations , but not the global oscillations .",
    "we point out that the inclusion of both gravity and thermodynamics would give the prominence proper the appearance of a cool slab , suspended in the dips of the field lines belonging to the prominence current .",
    "presumably this will not change the global oscillation discussed in this paper , since that mode is determined by the overall field structure .",
    "the results indicate that , for typical coronal densities ( @xmath207 kg / m@xmath94 ) , the prominence structure can indeed be viewed as a solid body moving through a fluid .",
    "however , the mass of this solid body is determined by the magnetic topology , not the prominence proper .",
    "in particular , the mass of the body seems to be determined by coronal field lines that enclose the prominence proper . in a low plasma-@xmath166 environment",
    "this is to be expected . as a consequence ,",
    "the total mass of the oscillating solid body is larger than the mass of the prominence proper .    due to the symmetry of the system , horizontal and vertical prominence oscillations decouple .",
    "these oscillations can each be interpreted as the motion of a damped harmonic oscillator .",
    "the horizontal periods and the horizontal and vertical damping times can be explained by assuming that the actual oscillating structure is larger than the prominence proper , due to the magnetic field topology .",
    "only the vertical periods do not agree with this model .",
    "they are nearly constant for different values of the coronal density and are best modelled by the oscillation of the prominence proper in a corona with vanishing plasma density ( @xmath208 ) . for realistic coronal densities , the horizontal periods change with @xmath209 at most when taking the actual oscillating structure into account .",
    "however , for lower prominence longitudinal mass densities @xmath21 in a stronger coronal background field ( and hence larger prominence currents @xmath72 ) , the effect will be much more pronounced .",
    "vertical oscillations lead to the emission of fast waves that carry momentum away from the prominence and damp the oscillation .",
    "horizontal oscillations , on the other hand , lead to the emission of slow waves .",
    "these will damp the horizontal oscillation , but less effectively than fast waves ( @xmath210 ) .",
    "the difference in wave emission between horizontal and vertical oscillations can be understood in terms of the coronal arcade in which the prominence is embedded . due to the large scale height",
    ", the arcade field is close to horizontal near the prominence .",
    "waves that travel in the vertical direction ( up or down ) therefor travel more or less perpendicular to the field lines and must be fast waves .",
    "waves that travel in the horizontal direction travel along the field lines .",
    "they could be either alfvn waves or magneto - acoustic waves . as regards excitation of the waves , it is obvious that the vertical motion of a prominence across field lines that are nearly horizontal will compress both gas and magnetic field and thus set off fast waves .",
    "the excitation of the magneto - acoustic slow waves ( for our analysis strongly suggests they are slow waves ) is not as well understood .",
    "but apparently the prominence acts as a piston during horizontal motions along magnetic field lines of the arcade .",
