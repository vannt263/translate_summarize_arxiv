    "the process of dissolution or growth of gas bubbles in an ambient liquid phase is very common in many situations . in everyday life , we often see bubbles in carbonated mineral water , beer , champagne etc .",
    "in particular the dissolution of gases is of huge technological and industrial importance in the context of gas scrubbing .",
    "this is , for instance , relevant for co@xmath0 disposal , where gas from a combustion process is injected into a reactive liquid medium .",
    "such processes are usually run under pressure control instead of volume control .",
    "note that the latter is much more common in the mathematical analysis of such mass transfer problems , since it allows for a fixed domain in which the mathematical model  usually in the form of a system of partial differential equations  holds .",
    "the massive impact of the external pressure is known from the above mentioned everyday life examples , but also can be seen in the medical context .",
    "this is the case with decompression sickness or caisson disease , where severe symptoms can be caused by bubble generation in the blood after a fast change of the ambient pressure .",
    "there is a large literature on experiments and numerical computation of dissolution / growth of bubbles in a liquid , e.g. liger - belair et al .",
    "@xcite , sauzade and cubaud @xcite , takemura and yabe @xcite .",
    "a rigorous mathematical model is necessary for possible theoretical investigations and mathematical analysis on this topic .",
    "based on continuum physics , we derive a mathematical model of a two - phase fluid system of type liquid / gas , where both gas and liquid phases are composed of molecularly miscible constituents and the pressure is controlled via a free ( upper ) surface @xmath1 .",
    "the system consists of chemical components @xmath2 .",
    "the gas phase is denoted by @xmath3 , the liquid phase by @xmath4 and the movable free interface by @xmath5 .",
    "see the figure 1 below .     + figure 1 .",
    "the two phase system under pressure control .    in common mathematical models for mass transfer from or to gas bubbles in a liquid phase ,",
    "the transferred gas is treated as a dilute component in both phases .",
    "this allows to use a two - phase navier - stokes system together with advection - diffusion equations for passive scalars .",
    "if the bubble is composed of a pure gas , this is no longer possible since the dissolution then significantly changes the bubble volume . in this case a much more elaborate modeling is required for both of the bulk phases and the transmission condition at the interface .",
    "in particular , the two one - sided limits of the bulk velocities at the interface and the interface s own velocity need to be distinguished .",
    "since such a more rigorous model accounts for the mass and volume of individual constituents , an incompressible model for the liquid phase will still lead to non - zero divergence of the barycentric velocity field .",
    "moreover , a thermodynamically rigorous model needs to be developed for compressible bulk phases in the first place .",
    "only then , an incompressible version may be derived as a limit , where the latter depends on the notion of incompressibility which is neither a priori clear nor unique in the mixture context .",
    "the novel aspect in the present paper is the idea of an incompressible solvent ( associated to @xmath6 ) carrying dissolved gas components which add their partial pressure to the total one like being ideal gases .",
    "the underlying mixture is supposed to be described by an equation of state according to @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a reference pressure and @xmath9 a reference density for the solvent , while @xmath10 is the solvent bulk modulus .",
    "the incompressible limit will be attained ( formally ) by letting @xmath10 tend to infinity .",
    "this leads to the constraint @xmath11 i.e.  to a constant solvent density .",
    "since the continuity equation for the solvent then reduces to @xmath12 it makes sense to employ the solvent momentum balance instead of the one for the mixture .",
    "this is attractive , because it leads to a standard incompressible navier - stokes equation for the bulk liquid .",
    "only the diffusive fluxes , which rely on the relative velocity to the barycentric one , become slightly more intricate , but only involving a simple linear relation .",
    "the obtained pde systems still comprise of a compressible gas phase model .",
    "low mach number approximation seems possible and will be given in a forthcoming paper .",
    "note that the gas phase density in the incompressible limit will still be a function of time , determined by the dynamical mass transfer process .",
