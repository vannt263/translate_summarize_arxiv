    "we consider encoding logical states @xmath4 and @xmath5 into horizontal ( h ) and vertical ( v ) polarization states of individual photons .",

    "the target , control and program qubit enter the setup at t@xmath11 , c@xmath11 and p@xmath11 respectively while the target and control output are denoted t@xmath12 and c@xmath12 .",
    "the program qubit is detected by polarization sensitive detector d projecting it onto diagonally polarized state .",
    "polarizing beam splitters pbs@xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) transmit horizontally polarized photons while reflecting vertical polarization .",
    "the partially polarizing beam splitter ppbs has unit transmissivity for horizontal polarization and @xmath15 for vertical polarization ( therefore the reflectivity for vertical polarization is @xmath16 ) .",

    "hwp@xmath19 and hwp@xmath22 @ 22.5 deg .",
    "the gate succeeds if one photon leaves by the target output port , one photon by the control output port and one photon is detected by detector d. ]    let us start with the evaluation of the state @xmath23 ( we maintain the order of qubits : target , control and program ) .",
    "the target photon impinges on the polarizing beam splitter pbs@xmath17 that sends it to the upper path .",
    "there the target photon is subjected to a neutral density filter @xmath24 with amplitude transmissivity @xmath25 and subsequently continues to the target output port by passing through the second polarizing beam splitter pbs@xmath19 .",
    "so far , one can write down the transformation of the state as @xmath26 meanwhile the control photon is transmitted by the partially polarizing beam splitter ppbs ( with transmissivity @xmath27 for horizontal polarization and @xmath28 for vertical polarization ) and after being subjected to polarization filtering by the filter f@xmath19 ( filtering horizontal polarization with transmissivity @xmath29 and letting the vertical polarization unfiltered @xmath30 ) it leaves the setup by the control output port . at this point",
    "the transformation by the gate reads @xmath31 finally the program photon impinges on the polarizing beam splitter pbs@xmath22 , where it gets transmitted and reflected with equal amplitude @xmath32 .",
    "since the gate succeeds only if a photon is detected on detector d , only the transmission of the program photon through pbs@xmath22 has to be taken into account .",
    "considering the program photon is in the state ( [ eq : program ] ) , the overall state gets transformed into @xmath33 once the program photon leaves pbs@xmath22 , we project it onto diagonal polarization @xmath34 resulting in the final form of the transformation @xmath35 this projection is needed to erase the which - path information about the photon detected on detector d.    in the same way , we now evaluate the transformation of the second state @xmath36 .",
    "the only difference this time is in the control qubit .",
    "it impinges on the ppbs having vertical polarization and is therefore transmitted with amplitude @xmath37 and reflected with amplitude @xmath38 .",
    "only the transmission of the control photon by the ppbs contributes to the successful operation of the gate .",
    "further to that , no attenuation of the vertically polarized control photon takes place on f@xmath19 . having the same transformation for the target and program qubits as in the previous paragraph",
    ", one can identify the overall action of the gate @xmath39    a different situation happens for the third state @xmath40 .",
    "the target photon is reflected by pbs@xmath17 entering the lower path , where it is subjected to a half - wave plate hwp@xmath17 oriented by @xmath21 deg with respect to horizontal polarization .",
    "this wave plate transform the target photon in the following way @xmath41 at this point the target and control photons interacts on the ppbs .",
    "since the control photon is transmitted through the ppbs ( having horizontal polarization in this case ) , we only take into account the transmission of the target photon to assure successful outcome of the gate @xmath42 where we have already incorporated the action of the polarization sensitive filter f@xmath19 .",
    "now the target state enters a hadamard transform implemented by a half - wave plate hwp@xmath19 rotated by 22.5 degrees with respect to horizontal polarization providing target photon transformation of the form of @xmath43 the target photon passes through pbs@xmath22 having horizontal polarization .",
    "therefore identically to the cases derived above , the gate can only succeed if the program photon passes through the pbs@xmath22 and then gets projected onto diagonal polarization .",
    "thus we obtain the transformation in the form of @xmath44 finally , the target photon is again subjected to a hadamard transform ( hwp@xmath22 ) resulting in @xmath45 only the target photon reflected by the pbs@xmath19 leaves the gate by designated output port and thus we obtain the final form of the transformation @xmath46    to complete our analysis , we now evaluate the transformation of the last basis state @xmath47 . similarly to the previous case , the target photon gets reflected on pbs@xmath17 and transformed by the half - wave plate hwp@xmath17 according to prescription ( [ eq : hwp1 ] ) .",
    "the overall state thus takes the form of @xmath48 at this point two - photon interference on the ppbs takes place resulting in @xmath49 where only the terms contributing to success of the gate are shown .",
    "note that when both the target and control photons enter the ppbs in vertical polarization state , the interference of both the photons being transmitted and both the photons being reflected ( hong - ou - mandel interference ) occurs introducing a phase shift @xmath0 to the term @xmath47 @xcite . by means of the subsequent hadamard transform in the target mode ( hwp@xmath19 )",
    ", the state transforms into @xmath50 on pbs@xmath22 the target photon gets reflected ( being vertically polarized ) and so only the program photon reflection can contribute to the gate s successful operation .",
    "this means that just its vertical polarization term contributes yielding the overall state in the form of @xmath51 which after projecting the photon in program mode onto diagonal polarization gives @xmath52 action of the hadamard gate in the target mode ( hwp@xmath22 ) and reflection of the target photon on pbs@xmath19 to its output port results in the final transformation @xmath53 in contrast to the three previous cases , the state is now phase - shifted by angle @xmath3 exactly as prescribed in ( [ eq : cphase ] ) .",
    "we have shown that the setup depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] implements the tunable c - phase gate with the phase shift programmed by the program qubit .",
    "this has been demonstrated on all four basis states of the control and target qubits together with an arbitrary program state . since all transformations are linear",
    ", the entire operation holds also for any superposition of the above mentioned four basis states .",
    "the success probability of the gate is @xmath54 and is state independent ( in order not to deform superpositions of basis states ) . in the next section",
    ", we will consider potential improvements to the setup in order to increase the success probability .",
    "optimized setup for the programmable c - phase gate .",
    "the components are designated as in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] with the newly added half - wave plates hwp@xmath55 ( rotated by 22.5 deg . ) and hwp@xmath56 ( rotated by 45 deg . ) and a phase modulator plm implementing a feed forward operation . ]",
    "so far we have discussed the basic scheme for the programmable c - phase gate which is experimentally also the most easily implementable .",
    "its success probability is however more then four times lower then the success probability of the optimal non - programmable c - phase gate . in this section",
    "we will discuss two optimization approaches allowing for considerable improvement in success probability ( see optimized scheme in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup_opti ] ) .",
    "firstly , one can increase the success probability of the program photon projection implemented before its detection . as derived in the previous section",
    ", the gate succeeds if the program photon is projected onto diagonal polarization and detected by d. this way , we neglect half of the cases corresponding to the program photon being projected onto anti - diagonal polarization [ @xmath57 . as experimentally demonstrated on a simpler unconditional programmable gate @xcite , one can increase the success probability by a factor of two if the anti - diagonal projections of the program photon are included . in such cases a feed - forward transformation @xmath58 has to by applied to the target photon immediately as it exits pbs@xmath22 @xcite .",
    "such transformation can be achieved using for instance a phase modulator ( plm ) @xcite .",
    "the second possibility to increase the overall success probability again by a factor of two is to use both the output ports of pbs@xmath19 ( designated t@xmath59 and t@xmath60 in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup_opti ] ) . in this case , the amplitude transmissivity of the filter f@xmath17 shall be reduced to @xmath61 and a half - wave plate hwp@xmath55 inserted behind it .",
    "this newly added wave - plate is rotated by 22.5 degrees with respect to horizontal polarization to implement the hadamard transform ( [ eq : hadamard ] ) .",
    "the target state at t@xmath59 is thus kept unchanged , but it allows for the target photon to leave also by the output port t@xmath60 .",
    "the target photon exiting pbs@xmath19 by its second output is however polarization - swapped with respect to the target photon in the first output .",
    "a half - wave plate hwp@xmath56 ( rotated by 45 degrees ) is therefore inserted to the output port t@xmath60 to perform the swap operation ( @xmath62 , @xmath63 ) .",
    "the second output port can be used only if one does not require the target photon to leave by a specified output .",
    "such situation occurs for instance if the target qubit is immediately measured after being processed by the gate ( the gate is the last element in a quantum circuit ) .",
    "the measurement apparatus can then be installed to both output ports .",
    "if only one of the mentioned optimization strategies is used , the success probability of the gate increases to 1/24 and if both of them are used it reaches the value of 1/12 ( for all phases @xmath3 ) . note that optimal non - programmable c - phase gate has the minimum success probability being about 1/11 for @xmath3 close to @xmath64 @xcite .",
    "if completely optimized , the programmable gate thus performs with almost the same probability as the optimal non - programmable gate at its success probability minimum .",
    "in this section , we discuss the feasibility of the proposed scheme based on the current level of technological development in linear - optical quantum information processing with discrete photons .",
    "firstly , in order to achieve any linear - optical quantum gate , one needs to generate adequate input photon state .",
    "our gate requires three photons each bearing one polarization - encoded qubit .",
    "generation of three separate photons has already been achieved in various experiments .",
    "either one photon pair from spontaneous parametric down - conversion ( spdc ) is combined with one additional photon from attenuated fundamental laser beam @xcite or two photon pairs are generated via spdc with one photon serving just as a trigger @xcite . with either of these techniques",
    "one can generate input states with sufficient fidelity , typically more than 95% , with repetition rate at about 1 per 5s @xcite .",
    "in the next step , we asses the feasibility of stabilizing the proposed scheme .",
    "there are two types of stabilizations required : two - photon temporal and spatial overlap stabilization ( hong - ou madel interference @xcite ) and single - photon interference stabilization .",
    "the first mentioned has to be achieved with precision of about 1/50 of the photons wave packet length .",
    "such wave packet is typically long ( fwhm ) in space and therefore stability with precision in units of suffices .",
    "one can use motorized translation to achieve this task . from our experience ,",
    "the two - photon overlap is stable for about one hour @xcite .",
    "after that , one needs to perform two - photon interference measurement and observe the hong - ou - mandel dip to reset the actual position of maximal two - photon overlap . since two - fold coincidences occur much more frequently then three - fold or four - fold ones , this restabilization measurement , when optimized , can take no more that a minute . in our scheme , we require to stabilize the two - photon overlap on the ppbs and on pbs@xmath22 . note that the stabilization procedures can be performed separately and consecutively and hence the need for two of them does not pose significant technological difficulties .",
    "there is also one instance of single - photon interference occurring in the setup between the polarizing beam splitters pbs@xmath17 and pbs@xmath19 .",
    "in contrast to the two - photon overlap , the single - photon interference needs to be stabilized typically to at least @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the photon s wavelength .",
    "such precision requires combining both motorized translation for larger steps with piezo translation for fine adjustments . in a typical bulk interferometer on decimeter scale",
    ", the single - photon stability only lasts for less than a minute @xcite .",
    "one can however significantly increase such time by replacing classical interferometer by a compact design using beam dividers @xcite .",
    "in general , there are two ways of how to perform stabilization of this kind .",
    "one option is to use the individual photons themselves and perform a set of measurements for various settings of the piezo shift .",
    "note that single - photon detections occur even with much higher rate that two - fold coincident detections and therefore there is usually fair amount of signal to work on @xcite .",
    "other experimentalists prefer using a strong laser beam propagating along the weak quantum signal .",
    "this strong signal is at sufficiently distant wavelength to allow mixing and subsequent decoupling from the quantum signal using dichroic filters . in this case",
    "the stabilization can be performed `` on - line '' during the entire experiment @xcite . using either of the above described techniques",
    ", it is quite feasible to stabilize the single - photon interference in the proposed setup .",
    "finally , the feasibility considerations have to be dedicated to the final detection procedure . in order to be experimentally implementable",
    ", the detection has to be robust against non - unit quantum detection efficiency of typical detectors and technological losses ( e.g. back - reflection , coupling efficiency ) .",
    "this requirement rules out vacuum detection - based schemes ( schemes where success is heralded by vacuum detection or no - detection ) @xcite .",
    "similarly , photon - number resolving detection is not completely reliable because of detection ( in)efficiency @xcite and technological losses . in our case however , the scheme only requires post - selection on three - fold coincidence detections and thus the quantum efficiency of the detectors only affects the detection rate and not the detected quantum state .",
    "this is a key feature of the proposed scheme with respect to its feasibility .",
    "in this paper , we have provided a linear - optical scheme for a programmable c - phase gate . the phase shift introduced by this gate",
    "is set by the state of a program qubit which makes the gate more versatile than previously implemented tunable c - phase gates with phase shift hard - coded to the setup setting .",
    "the setup is designed with experimental feasibility in mind .",
    "it does not require photon - number resolving detectors nor post - selection on vacuum detection and is therefore implementable with current level of know - how in experimental linear - optical quantum information processing .",
    "we have also presented two optimization options .",
    "each of them allows doubling the overall success probability of the gate . using both these optimizations",
    ", the gate succeeds with probability of 1/12 which is close to the success probability of a non - programmable tunable c - phase gate @xcite .",
    "further the two optimization steps can be used independently allowing to obtain success probability of 1/24 if only one of them is used .",
    "the first optimization method consists of applying an experimentally feasible feed - forward operation .",
    "the second optimization involves using both output ports of the final polarizing beam splitter in the target mode .",
