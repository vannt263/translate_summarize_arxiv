    "statistics plays a central role in physics , and marks one of the main parting points between the classical and quantum domains . in conventional phenomena , taking place in @xmath0-dimensions , the invariance under the interchange of identical particles forces the wave function to be either symmetric or antisymmetric . the spin - statistics theorem in relativistic quantum field theory",
    "then ties this symmetry to the spin , and all fundamental excitations are classified as either fermions or bosons . through the spin the fermionic or bosonic character can manifest itself even in one- or few - particle systems .",
    "however , it is in the thermodynamics of a system that a symmetric or antisymmetric wave function has a dramatic effect .    in @xmath1-dimensional phenomena new possibilities",
    "open up , and excitations of generalized statistics interpolating between fermions and bosons may occur . the role of these _ anyons _",
    "@xcite in the quantum hall effect is fairly well established  @xcite , and they may be relevant also in the superconductivity of some materials at high temperature  @xcite . of course , in these and other possible phenomenological applications in two - dimensional condensed matter systems , anyons are just low energy descriptions of the effective behaviour of particles and interactions which , although restricted to two - dimensions , exist in three - dimensional space and conform to the conventional boson - fermion classification .",
    "however , the same reasons which make anyons possible at low energies , pose a challenging question .",
    "it is certainly of great theoretical interest to establish the extent to which anyonic excitations can exist as fundamental objects in a truly @xmath1-dimensional world , just as ordinary fermions or bosons , or if on the contrary , they are always a low energy illusion .",
    "mathematically , the possibility of generalized statistics has its origin in the topology of the configuration space of a many particle system in @xmath1-dimensions . under the double interchange of two identical particles , @xmath2",
    ", the observability of the probability density requires that the wave function transforms as @xmath3 . in spacetime dimensions greater than three",
    "this double interchange is just the identity operation , so we are forced to @xmath4 ( bosons ) or @xmath5 ( fermions ) . in @xmath1-dimensions",
    "however , the winding of the trajectories followed by the particles as they are interchanged may be non trivial , in which case the operation is not connected to the identity and @xmath6 remains unrestricted .",
    "this , however , is only a mathematical possibility .",
    "its realization in a quantum theory depends on non trivial issues regarding the short distance behavior of the theory .",
    "indeed , the very notion of the linking of two trajectories assumes some kind of hard core repulsive interaction between the particles ( accounting for some generalized exclusion principle ) , and this may or may not be consistent with a formulation from first principles . in a non relativistic treatment ,",
    "the transformation law of the anyonic wave function under particle interchange provides a well defined meaning for the concept of generalized statistics . in practice",
    "this is implemented by minimally coupling the matter fields to an abelian chern - simons gauge field . however , the non existence of an ideal anyon gas , analogous to the bose and the fermi gases , represents a major obstacle in the understanding of anyonic thermodynamics .",
    "a major tool in this respect has been the perturbative expansion in the statistical angle @xmath6 , which when done at the bosonic end exhibits the singular nature of the statistical interaction at short distances  @xcite .",
    "although at the computational level this can be regularized with a repulsive @xmath7-function contact potential , these short distance difficulties are beyond the scope of the non relativistic theory .",
    "the physics of anyons at short distances must be formulated and discussed in the framework of relativistic quantum field theory .",
    "this has been done mostly in the canonical formalism  @xcite , where the main difficulty is again the non existence of free asymptotic many particle states .",
    "besides posing technical difficulties which are still controversial  @xcite , this obscures somewhat the concept of generalized statistics in this framework . to a large extent",
    ", it has acquired in the literature a rather algebraic meaning , in terms of the phase factor which enters generalized canonical commutation relations , again interpolating between the conventional commutator and the anticommutator for bosons and fermions .",
    "but those algebraic relations are rather formal , so long as there is no direct relation with free asymptotic states , and they do not address the relevant short distant issues , so they may or may not turn out to be consistent with a proper regularization procedure .",
    "since one expects that the statistics obeyed by the fundamental excitations will have direct consequences in the thermodynamic properties , a possible way around these difficulties is to use the functional integral formulation to study the theory at finite temperature , thus avoiding such difficult issues as the lack of free asymptotic states or the exact kinematical meaning of generalized statistics in the relativistic theory .",
    "here we adopt that point of view , and report our first results for some thermodynamic properties of massive fermions in three space - time dimensions coupled to an abelian maxwell - chern - simons field .",
    "in particular , we evaluate the specific heat at finite temperature and density for different values of the statistical angle @xmath6 .",
    "the calculation is done to leading order in the conventional loop expansion , complemented with a low momentum approximation which allows for further simplifications .",
    "we should admit from the start a limitation of our approach . at least within the loop expansion ,",
    "the theory is not properly defined unless the maxwell term is included in the pure gauge action .",
    "( note , however , that a maxwell term is generated anyhow by the quantum fluctuations of the matter fields , even if absent at the classical level ) .",
    "as it happens , that term is also expected to conceal the effect of the generalized statistic induced by the chern - simons term , at least at short distances  @xcite .",
    "thus , we do not expect to see in our results a very notorious shift , say , from fermionic to bosonic properties as we vary the statistical angle @xmath6 . to complicate matters further , in @xmath1-dimensions",
    "there is no bose - einstein condensation , so the specific heat does not exhibit a dramatic difference between fermions and bosons , as we are used to in @xmath0-dimensions . nevertheless , our results do show that the dependence of the specific heat in the statistical angle is consistent with a smooth transit from a fermionic to a bosonic behavior .",
    "we consider massive fermions in three euclidean dimensions coupled to an abelian maxwell - chern - simons gauge field with a lagrangian @xmath8 where @xmath9 has dimensions of mass and the statistical angle @xmath6 is a dimensionless parameter .",
    "our choice of @xmath10-matrices is @xmath11 , with @xmath12 the usual pauli matrices .    in order to establish conventions ,",
    "describe our treatment and review previous results , we shall evaluate first the partition function at finite temperature and zero chemical potential . in the following section we introduce a non - vanishing chemical potential to discuss the thermodynamics of the system at finite fermion density .",
    "we carry out the finite temperature calculations as usual , compactifying the ( euclidean ) time variable into the range @xmath13 ( in our units , @xmath14 ) .",

    "( [ partfunci3 ] ) we have omitted an overall divergent factor which does not contribute to the thermodynamic properties of the system .",
    "it is interesting to note that the partition function ( [ partfunci3 ] ) corresponds to an effective theory with a free massive fermion and a free boson with a mass @xmath38 which is related to the chern - simons topological mass .",

    "similarly , in eq .",
    "( [ cvmu ] ) , the first three terms correspond to the contributions to @xmath47 from free fermions and anti - fermions of mass @xmath59 and chemical potential @xmath60 , and from free bosons of mass @xmath61 without a chemical potential .",

    "although the curves in figs .  [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] seem almost identical , the specific heat in fig .  [ fig1 ] ( @xmath68 ) is slightly larger than that in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "this is a characteristic feature , which we find to hold in the entire parameter range , although the actual difference depends on the values of @xmath74 and @xmath62 .",
    "we think it is a very interesting result , since it is consistent with the ( unimpressive ) difference between the free bosonic and fermionic specific heats in @xmath1-dimensions .",
    "this is illustrated in more detail in figs .",

    "although this is not a proof of a shift from fermionic towards bosonic statistics ( whatever that means in this relativistic system ) , it is certainly consistent with that intuitive picture : since we start from a fermionic system at @xmath4 , one expects a transition towards a bosonic behavior as @xmath6 is increased , provided the nonrelativistic ideas about chern - simons - generalized statistics hold in this case .    in connection with the curves shown in figs .",
    "[ fig1][fig4 ] , it is worthwhile noticing that their apparent violation of the classical dulong - petit law is not so . for a @xmath1-dimensional non - relativistic classical ideal gas one finds @xmath79 . in our case , however , @xmath62 stands for the abelian charge density , and therefore is the density of particles minus the density of anti particles , as shown by the first terms in eq .",
    "( [ rho ] ) in the case of fermions .",
    "hence , one can indeed reach large values of @xmath47 without a corresponding increment of @xmath62 .",
    "we have studied also the fermion density as a function of the chemical potencial .",
    "we obtained a smooth function which does not exhibit the step structure found in  @xcite where it is interpreted as a signal of a critical behavior .",
    "note , however , that that reference considers a high temperature range ( opposite from ours ) and starts from a pure chern - simons system , without a maxwell term .",
    "we have analyzed at finite temperature and density a system of massive fermions in three space - time dimensions coupled to an abelian maxwell - chern - simons field . in particular , we evaluated the specific heat for different values of the statistical angle @xmath6 .",
    "this was done to leading order in the loop expansion and in the low momentum approximation . in doing so",
    ", we have shown that it is possible to obtain physical information of the system without having to give an explicit answer to such difficult issues as the lack of free asymptotic states or the exact kinematical meaning of generalized statistic in relativistic quantum field theory .",
    "our main result , the specific heat as a function of temperature and density ( eqs .",
    "( [ cvmu]-[rho ] ) ) , was analysed in a wide range of parameters within the low - temperature regime .",
    "this limitation to low temperatures arises in part from the low momentum expansion , which we here adopted for simplicity but can be avoided @xcite . however , to move to higher temperatures one will also have to face the contribution of lorentz non - invariant terms which here we have discarded .",
    "we hope to come back to this point in a future work .",
    "as we ourselves had expected , the specific heat has only a mild dependence on the statistical angle @xmath6 .",
    "however , this dependence is consistent with what one expects from the nonrelativistic picture of generalized statistics , thus suggesting that those ideas may still be applicable , to some extent , in the relativistic domain .",
    "as we pointed out earlier , a more marked dependence on the statistical angle @xmath6 may be expected in a pure chern - simons theory without maxwell term . that , however , will possibly require a non - perturbative treatment . in this respect",
    "it may be of interest to consider other thermodynamic functions which may be more sensible to the long - distance properties , and therefore more immune to the presence of the maxwell term .",
