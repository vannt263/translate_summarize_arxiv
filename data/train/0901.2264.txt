    "in the paper @xcite , n.j.hitchin established a kind of twistor correspondence which provides a bijection between 3-dimensional einstein - weyl manifolds and non - singular complex surfaces which have non - singular rational curves with normal bundle @xmath0 .",
    "the latter complex surfaces are called the _ minitwistor spaces _ , and the rational curves in the spaces are called the _ minitwistor lines_. in this hitchin correspondence , einstein - weyl manifolds appear as parameter spaces of the minitwistor lines .",
    "the parameter space has a natural complex conformal structure and holomorphic geodesics , by which the space becomes an einstein - weyl 3-fold .",
    "conversely , when an einstein - weyl 3-fold is given , the minitwistor space is obtained as the leaf space for a certain foliation on a conic bundle naturally constructed over the einstein - weyl 3-fold . here in order to obtain the minitwistor space , we need to assume in general that an einstein - weyl 3-fold is sufficiently small . in this sense , the hitchin correspondence is local in nature .",
    "it is also remarkable that there are essentially only two compact minitwistor spaces , while there are many non - compact minitwistor spaces as constructed by h.pedersen and k.p.tod ( @xcite ) .",
    "the two compact minitwistor spaces correspond to the two standard einstein - weyl 3-folds ( i.e.the euclidean space and the hyperbolic space ) . in this paper",
    ", we show that if we allow the minitwistor lines to be _ nodal _ rational curves , then their parameter space still carries a natural einstein - weyl structure , if the parameter space is 3-dimensional .",
    "when the complex surface is projective algebraic , the parameter space of nodal curves ( of any genus ) in a linear system is called a _ severi variety _ in algebraic geometry , which is known to have a natural structure of a ( non - complete ) algebraic variety .",
    "thus our result can be precisely stated that .",
    "if @xmath1 denotes any of the nodal rational curves , the last condition is equivalent to the condition that the self - intersection number of @xmath1 and the number of the nodes of @xmath1 are @xmath2 and @xmath3 respectively .",
    "so when @xmath4 our result is reduced to the hitchin s original einstein - weyl structure . in section 2.1 we recall the above hitchin correspondence , with some emphasizes on null plane bundles over einstein - weyl 3-folds , a plane distribution on the bundle , and its integrability . in section 2.2",
    "we first recall fundamental results on severi varieties in general ( proposition [ prop - severi ] ) , and show that if the nodal curves ( parametrized by the severi variety ) are rational , then the severi variety is non - singular and its dimension is expressed by the self - intersection number of the rational curves and the number of the nodes ( proposition [ prop - severi2 ] ) . in section 2.3 by using hitchin s result we show that the severi variety of rational curves has a natural einstein - weyl structure , if the variety is 3-dimensional ( theorem [ thm : definingewstr ] ) . in section 2.4 motivated by this result",
    "we define _ minitwistor spaces _ to be a pair of non - singular projective surface and a linear system on it which has a 3-dimensional severi variety of rational curves ( definition [ def : mt ] ) .",
    "our definition involves a positive integer @xmath5 which is one greater than the number of the nodes , and we call this integer the _ index _ of the minitwistor space .",
    "then the original minitwistor spaces by hitchin are exactly the minitwistor spaces of index one . as",
    "any blow - up of the minitwistor spaces ( in the above sense ) becomes again minitwistor space , we also introduce the notion of minimality of the minitwistor spaces ( definition [ def : minimal ] ) .",
    "then any minimal minitwistor spaces of index one are isomorphic to either @xmath6 or the hirzebruch surface @xmath7 ( proposition [ prop : class1 ] ) .    in section 3",
    "we investigate certain subvarieties of the 3-dimensional severi variety ( of rational curves ) naturally arising from the einstein - weyl structure .",
    "namely we investigate null surfaces and ( null and non - null ) geodesics in the einstein - weyl 3-fold . just as in the hitchin s case ,",
    "null surfaces are formed by minitwistor lines going through a point on the minitwistor space , and geodesics are formed by those going through two points on the minitwistor space .",
    "( in particular , they are automatically algebraic subvarieties . ) but significant difference in our case is that both of them are non - normal subvarieties .",
    "the singular locus of these subvarieties are formed by minitwistor lines which have nodes at the prescribed point(s ) .    in section 4",
    "we show that if the minitwistor space ( in our sense ) has a real structure and a real minitwistor line which has the nodes as its all real points , then the real locus of the ( 3-dimensional ) severi variety has a natural structure of a _ real , positive definite _ einstein - weyl 3-manifold ( theorem [ thm : real ] ) .",
    "they are obtained as real slices of the complex einstein - weyl structure obtained in section [ section : hitchin&severi ] .",
    "in section 5 we provide various examples of the minitwistor spaces . in section 5.1 for any @xmath8 we construct minimal minitwistor spaces of index @xmath5 .",
    "they are obtained from the product surface @xmath6 by blowing - up @xmath2 points . in this example",
    ", the configuration of the @xmath2 points can be taken generically , so that they constitute a @xmath9-dimensional family , while the number of effective parameter is @xmath10 .",
    "also we see that if we specialize the configuration of the @xmath2 points in a certain way , then we obtain minitwistor spaces with @xmath11-action , or even _ toric _ minitwistor spaces ( of any index ) . in section 5.2",
    "we provide examples of minimal minitwistor spaces of any index which have a real structure enjoying the conditions in section 4 .",
    "this creates real , positive definite einstein - weyl 3-manifolds .",
    "these minitwistor spaces are obtained as the canonical quotient spaces of the twistor spaces of joyce s self - dual metrics on the connected sum of complex projective planes .",

    "<S> in this paper we show that the space of _ nodal _ rational curves , which is so called a severi variety ( of rational curves ) , on any non - singular projective surface is always equipped with a natural einstein - weyl structure , if the space is 3-dimensional . </S>",
    "<S> this is a generalization of the einstein - weyl structure on the space of _ smooth _ rational curves on a complex surface , given by n.hitchin . as geometric objects naturally associated to einstein - weyl structure </S>",
    "<S> , we investigate null surfaces and geodesics on the severi varieties . </S>",
    "<S> also we see that if the projective surface has an appropriate real structure , then the real locus of the severi variety becomes a positive definite einstein - weyl manifold . </S>",
    "<S> moreover we construct various explicit examples of rational surfaces having 3-dimensional severi varieties of rational curves . </S>"
