    "examples of qc s which have been prepared are rings of 48 fe adatoms  @xcite or stadia  @xcite .",
    "the latter shape is motivated by the search for quantum - chaotic behavior , which so far has not been successful due to strong scattering of the electrons by the corral atoms .",
    "however the magnetic moment and magnetocrystalline anisotropy for these nanoscopic structures have not yet been determined in experiment .",
    "the qc of adsorbate atoms sets the boundary condition for the wave function of the substrate surface state .",
    "the quantum mechanical electron distribution of this state can therefore be measured by stm and is found to be in remarkable agreement with standard predictions of quantum mechanics .    in this paper",
    ", however , we are not interested in the surface state but rather in the magnetic anisotropy properties of the quantum corral itself .",
    "since it is known that the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy @xmath0 is enhanced in thin magnetic films compared to threedimensional bulk media , one might speculate about a further increase of @xmath0 upon reduction of the dimensionality to 1d .",

    "it is shown that for the diatomic pair there are important contributions to the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy as a function of the number @xmath6 of @xmath2-electrons per atom @xmath3 due to the different lifting of band degeneracies for different magnetization directions .",
    "we find that @xmath7 is valid for the diatomic pair .",

    "we follow the ideas of wang _ et al . _ and extend their diatomic pair model to the case of @xmath5 atoms .",
    "we start from the following hamiltonian  @xcite : @xmath9 the summation is taken over @xmath5 sites @xmath10 , while the second sum is over pairs of nearest neighbors . as usual @xmath11(@xmath12 ) creates ( destroys ) an electron with spin @xmath13 at site @xmath10 and orbital @xmath14 .",
    "furthermore @xmath15 is the on - site energy of an electron at site @xmath10 and orbital @xmath14 . for simplicity we set @xmath15=0 , since we consider only orbitals of the 3@xmath2 type .",

    "the tight - binding hamiltonian @xmath35 has the same structure for this model as the matrix in eq.(4 ) .",

    "note that the magnetic - moment direction enters only by soc and can be adjusted for each atomic site individually .    concerning the anticipated magnetic order of the qw and qc in our electronic theory we remark the following : ( i ) the interatomic distance in our model",
    "is chosen in accordance with the lateral lattice constant of a thin bcc - fe film on a w(001 ) substrate , which is magnetically ordered .",
    "however , the stm - experiments produce qc with the interatomic distance of 8 - 10  , which probably would not order , except for possible indirect - exchange effects related to the substrate . our interest , however , is mainly in small qc s , which might be produced in the near future , with closer nearest - neighbor distances and magnetic order .",
    "furthermore it is important to note that the assumption of magnetic long - range order in our electronic theory is not in contrast to the well known general theorems of the ( ii ) ising-  @xcite and ( iii ) heisenberg - models  @xcite .",
    "in fig .  [ dimer ] , the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy @xmath3 per atom is shown as a function of 3@xmath2-bandfilling @xmath107 for the fe diatomic pair ( dashed curve ) .",
    "first we note that , as expected , @xmath0 is enhanced compared to fe monolayers ( @xmath108 mev for the dimer vs. @xmath109 300 @xmath110ev for an fe monolayer ) , because of the symmetry reduction from 2d to 1d .",
    "this is in accordence with recent studies of magnetism in nickel clusters .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite observe enhanced magnetic moments for small nickel clusters and find magnetization minima for clusters with closed geometrical shells and maxima for relatively open clusters .    in fig .",
    "[ dimer ] , also the dependence of @xmath3 on the scaling of all @xmath2-electron hopping parameters with a overall parameter @xmath111 for the diatomic pair is presented ( dotted curve ) .",
    "the absolute value of the magnetic anisotropy energy @xmath112 increases for decreasing @xmath111 ( decreasing bandwidth ) for the easy axis perpendicular to the bond ( @xmath113 ) , and decreases for the easy axis parallel to the bond ( @xmath114 ) .",
    "note that , contrary to the situation in thin films , no convergence problems occur in @xmath0 due to our finite system .",
    "our calculation is performed in real space , and we sum over discrete energy levels .",
    "thus the change of the occupation number is @xmath115 , and we get 20 points for @xmath3 of the diatomic pair . when the band is completely empty or filled , no contribution to @xmath0 results : @xmath116 .",
    "while this is trivially the case for an empty band , this relation holds with 14 significant digits for the completely filled case , which yields an independent check of our numerical accuracy .",
    "we find for fe , with its atomic band filling @xmath6=6 , an in plane easy axis for @xmath0(fe)=6.1 mev .",
    "since the diatomic pair is a small system , it is not necessary to assume implicitly hybridization with @xmath117-electrons .",
    "we find for the diatomic pair a mirror symmetry of @xmath3 with respect to half filling ( @xmath118 ) , where the spin - up subband is completely full .",
    "however , the corresponding points of the curve are not totally symmetric , and a close inspection shows that there are deviations of this mirror symmetry of the order @xmath119 ev .",
    "this small symmetry violation results from the combined action of soc and hopping interaction .",
    "a detailed analysis shows that this asymmetry increases monotonously with increasing soc . especially for @xmath6=2.5 and 7.5",

    "[ dimer ] . to illustrate the origin of this asymmetry we split the spin - orbit coupling matrix @xmath120 into two parts @xmath121 and @xmath122 , for the coupling between parallel and antiparallel spin states , and recalculate @xmath3 with either of the two matrices instead of @xmath120 itself : @xmath123 so we obtain the curve @xmath124 ( solid curve ) of fig .",

    "the @xmath124 contribution prefers an easy magnetic direction perpendicular ( parallel ) to the molecule axis if the spin - down subband is less ( more ) than half - filled , and vice versa for the majority subband in agreement with the result of wang _ et al . _",
    "[ 5 ] . also for larger chains @xmath124 changes it sign at @xmath6=2.5 and 7.5 , which seems to be a general trend also in fe - monolayers  @xcite .",
    "this is a generalization of hund s third rule on soc which applies to itinerant magnetic systems ( see appendix ) .    while for fe parameters the relation @xmath126 holds to a good approximation , small deviations are responsible for the asymmetry mentioned above .",
    "this asymmetry only occurs if we take into account at least the matrix elements of @xmath120 for the @xmath127- and @xmath128-bonds and is absent for all other combinations .",
    "the electronic origin of @xmath3 of the diatomic pair can be explained from its energy level scheme in fig .",
    "[ lev ] , for the two magnetization directions @xmath106(@xmath129=0 ) ( parallel to molecule axis ) and @xmath106(@xmath129=@xmath130/2 ) ( perpendicular to molecule axis ) .",

    "[ lev ] for simplicity ; due to the exchange splitting @xmath61=3.0 ev the spin - down states ( not shown in the figure ) are located symmetrically to these bands with respect to the zero of the energy scale .",
    "the individual levels of the spin - up subband have been labeled by the numbers 1@xmath13110 in the absence of soc . without soc , the lowest bonding ( level 1 ) and the highest antibonding states ( level 10 ) result from the splittings caused by @xmath42 . due to the inequalities @xmath132 ( sec .",
    "ii.b ) the lowest bonding- and antibonding states are split by @xmath133 , while in each case two doubly degenerate @xmath127-(@xmath128-)bonding and antibonding states result from @xmath43 and @xmath44 ( see eq .",
    "thus the levels 2 and 3 ( 4 and 5 ) of fig .",
    "[ lev ] correspond to the @xmath127-(@xmath128-)bonding states , while the levels 8 and 9 ( 6 and 7 ) are equivalent to the corresponding antibonding states .",
    "these remaining degeneracies are lifted very strongly by soc for @xmath106(@xmath129=0 ) and therefore level crossings may occur . for @xmath106(@xmath129=@xmath130/2 )",
    "the degeneracies are only weakly lifted .",
    "the electronic origin of @xmath3 for the diatomic pair results from ( i ) different soc - induced @xmath134 @xmath135 @xmath136 , @xmath137 @xmath138 for the two magnetization directions , and ( ii ) @xmath139 @xmath140 @xmath135 @xmath141 @xmath138 .",
    "note that the lifting of degeneracies can favor a magnetization parallel as well as perpendicular to the bond axis .",
    "next we investigate the dependence of @xmath0 on @xmath8 .",
    "we find @xmath142 for all of the @xmath107 values of the diatomic pair in agreement with wang _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , irrespective of the value of the spin - orbit coupling constant . to demonstrate this , we show in fig .",
    "[ soc ] the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy @xmath143 for the bandfillings @xmath6=1 and @xmath6=2.5 . in fig .",
    "[ soc ] , however , we see a discontinuous change of the slope for @xmath6=2.5 , because a level crossing ( see fig .  [ lev ] ) has occurred between the levels 5 and 6 for @xmath8=0.04 ev . the inversion of these levels is indicated by the labeling in fig .",
    "[ lev ] , for @xmath144=0.05 ev .",
    "thus @xmath3 can change its sign because of the level crossings .",
    "to explain for @xmath6=1 the dependence of @xmath0 on soc , we have to study the contribution of level shifts for different magnetization directions .",
    "we find that the shifting of @xmath137 @xmath145 is for both magnetization directions proportional to @xmath146 .",

    "[ soc ] the dependence of the level shifts on @xmath8 for the nondegenerate level 1 ( this corresponds to @xmath6=0.5 ) and the degenerate level 2 ( @xmath6=1 ) , for both magnetization directions ( @xmath147 ) for the diatomic pair . for @xmath148 and small soc",
    "there is a flat slope of the energy of both levels , while the slope increases with increasing @xmath8 .",
    "otherwise , the slope of the energy of both levels for @xmath149 is increasing less strongly with increasing @xmath8 .",
    "thus in fig .",
    "[ soc ] the magnetic anisotropy energy @xmath150 decreases for larger soc with increasing @xmath8 , as a result of the different position of the energy levels for the two magnetization directions entering the calculation of @xmath3 .",
    "this yields another reason for the sign change of @xmath3 .",
    "an other important consequence of the levelcrossing can be seen in fig .",
    "[ dimer ] .",
    "the magnetic anisotropy energy @xmath3 of the quarter - band filling ( @xmath6=2.5 and 7.5 ) of both subbands depends sensitively on the hopping parameters , because the level crossings then occur for smaller values of @xmath8 ( decreasing @xmath111 ) or , in the other case of increasing @xmath111 for larger values of @xmath8 .    in fig .",

    "this behavior is also valid in the tight - binding model and will be discussed again in sec .",

    "this extension of the theory , however , has not been performed in this work .",

    "there is a general trend that @xmath4 decreases with increasing number @xmath5 of fe atoms in chains ( compare figs . 1 and 8) .",
    "for rings this is not the case which will be discussed later .",
    "the solid curve in fig .  [ fring ] shows @xmath3 for the tight - binding five ring .",
    "although this curve is different from the result in the diatomic pair - model , the translational symmetry survives . a detailed analysis yields that the tight - binding model has the same symmetry behavior for small odd rings as the diatomic - pair model . the translational symmetry can be traced back to the absence of a mirror symmetry between the levels in each of the two spin subbands with respect to @xmath151 : in odd rings and chains both spin - subbands contain an odd number of electron states .",
    "if there the degeneracies of both subbands resulting from the exchange splitting are all lifted due to the hybridization , as is the case for odd rings , it is not possible to find a mirror symmetry in each of the two subbands . since both spin - subbands have a translational symmetry with respect to the zero of the energy scale , @xmath3 has in this case also a translational symmetry with respect to half bandfilling . in all odd chains always five degeneracies ( angular momentum algebra of 3@xmath2-states )",
