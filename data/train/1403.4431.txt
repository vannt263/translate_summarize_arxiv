    "in recent years interrelation between wavefield structure and its semiclassical description has attracted increasing attention in the context of wave chaos  wavefield manifestations of ray chaos .",
    "ray chaos means instability of ray trajectories , conditioned by nonintegrability of the classical hamiltonian equations and is found to be the essential part of wave propagation in various environments , ranging from artificial optical devices @xcite to natural media @xcite . in addition , the problem of wave chaos is closely connected to the problem of quantum chaos , which is understood as quantum dynamics of classically chaotic systems @xcite .",
    "the present paper is devoted to long - range sound propagation in the ocean , which have become of growing interest in recent decades @xcite .",
    "increasing of the sound speed with increasing of depth , combined with the warming of the upper oceanic layer , results in non - monotonic dependence of the sound speed on depth . according to the snell s law , there occurs a waveguide confining acoustic waves within a restricted water volume and preventing from their interaction with the lossy bottom .",
    "when we deal with guided wave propagation , weak inhomogeneities along the axis of propagation may be sufficient for dividing phase space into regular and irregular regions @xcite .",
    "this division , relying on the kam theory , even persists in the case of a stochastically - perturbed waveguide @xcite , giving rise for coherent ray clusters @xcite .",
    "ray chaoticity leads to smearing of a spatial wavefield structure due to irregular mode coupling @xcite , random - like distribution of ray arrival times at the receiver @xcite , or anomalous transmission loss due to the chaos - assisted ray escaping from a waveguide @xcite .    on another front",
    ", it is well established that a wavepacket may demonstrate coherent or incoherent motion depending upon whether the initial position of a wavepacket is in the regular or irregular part of classical phase space @xcite .",
    "the packet initially concentrated inside a region of stability remains localized , while the packet placed within a chaotic region spreads rapidly over all the chaotic layer .",
    "in contrast to the semiclassical limit , boundaries between stable and chaotic regions are penetrable at nonzero wavelength .",
    "this enables extension of a wavepacket , evolving in the chaotic region , into area with regular dynamics ; the effect is amplifying with increasing wavelength @xcite .",
    "thus wave corrections imply suppressing of the phase space separation .",
    "chaos means irregular behavior of rays and can be thought of as purely refractional phenomena .",
    "description of chaos - induced effects in wave motion far from the semiclassical limit requires the understanding of how wave refraction depends on wavelength .",
    "this issue is of great importance in the presence of small - scale features , which seem to be irrelevant for wave refraction at low frequencies @xcite . in underwater acoustics ,",
    "these features are usually associated with internal waves . in the present paper",
    "we follow two aims .",
    "first , we study the effect of small - scale vertical oscillations of a perturbation on ray dynamics .",
    "we shall show that these oscillations account for strong chaos of near - axial rays .",
    "second , we investigate interrelation between strong chaos of near - axial rays and the wavefield structure at low frequencies .    the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we describe briefly the model of a waveguide .",

    "iv we study wavefield properties by means of husimi representation of the floquet modes . in conclusion",

    "we give consideration to the narrow  angle wave propagation , when the original helmholtz equation for a wavefield reduces to the parabolic equation @xmath6 here @xmath7 is the wavenumber in the reference medium with @xmath8 , @xmath9 is signal frequency .",
    "the parabolic equation formally coincides with the non - stationary shrdinger equation . in this analogy one treats range @xmath5 as the time - like variable , @xmath3 as an unperturbed potential , @xmath10 as a time - dependent perturbation , and @xmath11 as the planck constant .    ,",

    "function @xmath3 takes on the smallest value at the depth @xmath26 we shall refer this depth as the channel axis .",
    "the respective unperturbed sound - speed profile is depicted in fig .",
    ". fast oscillations of @xmath4 are included in order to mimic the effect of internal wave fine structure and distort the sound - speed profile , as it is demonstrated in fig .",
    "the classical counterpart of the operator @xmath27 is the hamiltonian @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the analog to mechanical momentum , @xmath30 is a grazing angle of a sound ray .",
    "ray trajectories obey the hamiltonian equations @xmath31 @xmath32 the last term in the right - hand side of ( [ sys2 ] ) can be rewritten in the following form : @xmath33 , \\end{aligned } \\label{sys22}\\ ] ] where we denoted @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 .",
    "the smallness of @xmath37 implies that the range - dependent term oscillates rapidly along a ray path , except for the resonant regions , where either the condition @xmath38 or the condition @xmath39 is fulfilled .",
    "the theory of such resonances was developed in @xcite .",
    "here we only give a brief description of their properties .",
    "let us consider one of the resonant conditions , for instance , the former one .",
    "first we simplify the equation ( [ sys22 ] ) .",
    "since @xmath40 can be thought of as a large parameter , we leave only those terms in the right - hand side , which are proportional to @xmath40 . in addition , we neglect the non - resonant term @xmath41 .",

    "the inequality ( [ ineq ] ) is fulfilled only near the waveguide axis , where @xmath53 .",
    "the ray momentum at the axis is given by the equation @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the depth of the channel axis ( [ za ] ) , and the parameter @xmath56 can be referred to as the `` energy '' of ray oscillations in a waveguide . substituting ( [ p_ax ] ) into ( [ res ] )",
    ", we find the resonant value of @xmath57 @xmath58 note that formula ( [ res - h ] ) relates to the resonance ( [ res - m ] ) as well .",
    "the conditions ( [ res ] ) and ( [ res - m ] ) differ by the sign of resonant momentum , the former arises at @xmath59 , while the latter takes place at @xmath60 .",
    "it means that these resonances affect the same rays , but they act at different phases of a trajectory . with @xmath24  km and @xmath25",
    "km the condition ( [ res - h ] ) holds for near - axial rays . according to fig .",
    "[ poinc ] , resonances ( [ res ] ) and ( [ res - m ] ) cause wide chaotic sea in phase space , without considerable stable islands within .",
    "therefore one can assume that chaotic diffusion of rays inside the sea is close to ergodic mixing .",
    "mixing ray dynamics anticipates fast decoherence and spreading of a wavepacket initially located within the chaotic sea , until all the area of the sea will be covered @xcite .",
    "certainly , it is the case in the short wavelength limit , when ray and wave descriptions are well correlated @xcite .",
    "the question we ask is how the chaotic sea reveals itself at relatively low frequencies , when influence of diffraction and interference is non - negligible , and one to one correspondence between a wave pattern and its semiclassical approximation should nt be expected . to address this issue",

    "in these cases floquet modes do nt possess any hallmarks of chaos .",
    "our explanation of the well - ordered peaks in the husimi plots is the following .",
    "decreasing of the signal frequency makes wave refraction less sensitive to small scale vertical oscillations of the sound - speed perturbation .",
    "as it was shown in the previous section , these oscillations are responsible for strong chaos of near - axial rays .",
    "hence , the main source of chaos is suppressed at low frequencies .",
    "enhancing of ray - wave correspondence requires smoothing of fast vertical oscillations using some averaging technique .",
    "evidently , the averaging of fast oscillations means replacement of the original sound - speed perturbation by the smoothed one with lower amplitude .",
    "this implies that the disordered multiplication of periodic orbits should be removed , and the well - ordered periodic orbits of completely destroyed resonance @xmath98 should be restored .",
    "thus the decreasing of frequency leads to the similar effect as the decreasing of the perturbation s amplitude and is followed by recovery of periodic orbits and occurrence of the peaks observed . in some sense , peaks of the floquet modes may be regarded as some specific kind of scars .",
    "in the present paper we have considered sound wave motion in an acoustic waveguide with the a range - dependent sound - speed perturbation imposed .",
    "it is shown that small - scale vertical oscillations of the perturbation influence near - axial rays in the resonant way .",
    "scattering on resonance makes near - axial rays unstable and leads to the forming of a wide chaotic sea in the underlying phase space , without any considerable islands of stability .",
    "moreover , small - scale vertical oscillations of the perturbation cause proliferation and disordered phase space distribution of periodic orbits . nevertheless , the majority of the floquet modes calculated with frequencies of 50 - 100 hz reveals regular pattern with ordered peaks and husimi zeroes .",
    "the peaks are located near the elliptic or hyperbolic fixed points of the `` classical '' kam resonance @xmath98 , that is confirmed by constructing the poincar map with lower amplitude of the perturbation .",
    "however the peaks observed are not associated with certain periodic orbits in the original case .",
    "that resonance , as well as its periodic orbits , is completely destroyed with non - decreased amplitude of the sound - speed perturbation .",
    "thus we are faced with an eccentric conflict of ray and wave descriptions : the peaks have specific `` classical '' resonant topology but are not supported by classical periodic orbits .    in our opinion ,",
    "the revival of kam resonance @xmath98 on the husimi plots indicates the necessity of frequency - dependent corrections to the standart ray approximation , when ray motion is strongly affected by small - scale features .",
    "a likely way of introducing such corrections is the construction of some effective sound - speed profile , using the homogenization procedures @xcite , or exploiting the quantum action @xcite .",
    "we suppose that ray modeling with the effective sound - speed profile should be better consistent with wave pattern .",
    "in particular , a corrected ray approximation may provide the desirable link between the husimi peaks and the respective periodic orbits .",
    "our expectations are partially supported by the numerical simulation , presented in @xcite , where it was shown that smoothing of fine - scale structures does nt lead to significant changes in a wavefield . as a concluding remark",
    ", it should be mentioned that the stabilizing of wave refraction with decreasing frequency seems to be worth for overcoming limitations on the hydroacoustical tomography , which are posed by ray chaos @xcite .",

    "<S> we consider sound wave propagation in a range - periodic acoustic waveguide in the deep ocean . </S>",
    "<S> it is demonstrated that vertical oscillations of a sound - speed perturbation , induced by ocean internal waves , influence near - axial rays in a resonant way , producing ray chaos and forming a wide chaotic sea in the underlying phase space . </S>",
    "<S> we study interplay between chaotic ray dynamics and wave motion with signal frequencies of 50100 hz . </S>",
    "<S> the floquet modes of the waveguide are calculated and visualized by means of the husimi plots . despite of irregular phase space distribution of periodic orbits , </S>",
    "<S> the husimi plots display the presence of ordered peaks within the chaotic sea . </S>",
    "<S> these peaks , not being supported by certain periodic orbits , draw the specific `` chainlike '' pattern , reminiscent of kam resonance . </S>",
    "<S> the link between the peaks and kam resonance is confirmed by ray calculations with lower amplitude of the sound - speed perturbation , when the periodic orbits are well - ordered . </S>",
    "<S> we associate occurrence of the peaks with the recovery of ordered periodic orbits , corresponding to kam resonance , due to suppressing of wavefield sensitivity to small - scale features of the sound - speed profile . </S>"
