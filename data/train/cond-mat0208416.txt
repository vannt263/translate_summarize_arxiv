    "the effect of demagnetising field becomes less important and is expected to be almost independent of sample shape in this system , as the cluster size is smaller than the percolation limit where large number of spins are infinite long range ferromagnetic ordered @xcite .",

    "no field induced transitions are observed .",
    "similar phase induced transitions have been observed in a variety of disordered magnetic materials where the materials segregates into two distinguishable electronic states that coexist within the same crystallographic phase @xcite .",
    "the most reasonable explanation for such type of field induced transition is that the system undergoes an antiferromagnetic to metastable ferromagnetic state at h @xmath73 .",
    "this is further confirmed that there is no long range ferromagnetic order in the system , rather the antiferromagnetic interactions promotes strong spin canting inside the clusters below 100k and the ferromagnetic state above t@xmath7 ( @xmath24 125k ) is very similar to canted ferromagnets @xcite .",
    "the same features are observed in the m vs h plots where magnetization shows lacks of saturation even upto 8 tesla .",
    "the low value of coercive field above 125k and no magnetic hysteresis above 150k suggest ferromagnetic regime of the sample .",

    "this is due to the spin canting effect at low temperature .",
    "we have investigated the time dependence of field cooled remanent magnetization for better understanding of competition between equilibrium and non - equilibrium dynamics in the system . the experimental data ( point symbol ) in fig.6a show a clear and systematic change of time dependent curvature from concave down ( at t @xmath6 130k ) to concave up as the measurement temperature increases .",
    "we have found that the remanent magnetization decay at low temperature regime ( t @xmath6 130k ) is best fitted by the superposition of a pure stretched exponential and a constant term as @xmath82 where m@xmath58 , m@xmath83 , @xmath84 and n are fitted parameters ( shown in table 1 ) .",

    "the relaxation of the system above the cluster spin freezing temperature t@xmath7 @xmath24 125k suggest that it is not in a true ferromagnetic state .",
    "the disorder and frustration in the ferromagnetic state takes into account the two competitive times scale simultaneously , one is due to intra - cluster dynamics @xcite and second one is due to the cluster growth in presence of the frustration @xcite . according to a model proposed by chamberlin and haines @xcite that relaxation rate ( @xmath87 ) of a cluster with size s is related as @xmath88 where c is a constant .",
    "this equation suggest that as the cluster size decreases , the relaxation rate will be faster .",

    "it has been found that the remanent magnetization at 280k is practically independent of time ( m@xmath90(t ) @xmath24 m@xmath58 ) and the small value of m@xmath58 is due to the short range interacting clusters in the paramagnetic state @xcite .",

    "the ferromagnetic behaviour has been understood by treating these clusters as magnetic domains , inside of which all the spins are not necessarily be infinite long range ordered due to spin canting effects , random distribution of magnetic and non - magnetic ions and different proportion of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions inside the clusters .",
    "the temperature dependence of ac susceptibility data suggest that domain formation occurs above 240k .",
    "as the temperature decreases , canted spin structure is favoured inside the domains due to antiferromagnetic interactions . as a result ,",
    "the random anisotropy field introduced by dzyalosinsky - moriya type interactions @xmath48 @xmath110x@xmath111 will hinder the ( cluster ) domain wall movement and decrease the low field ac susceptibility at low temperature @xcite . the frequency dependence of ac susceptibility ( @xmath50 , @xmath51 ) , the weak irreversibility ( between fc and zfc susceptibility ) below t@xmath5 ( @xmath24 270k ) and strong irreversibility below t@xmath7 ( @xmath24 125k ) give the characteristic feature of typical re - entrant ferromagnet @xcite .",
    "the re - entrant character of the system is further confirmed by the time dependence of the field cooled remanent magnetization experiments .",
    "the slow spin dynamics at t@xmath6 130k suggest the non - equilibrium canted spin glass state , where as an equilibrium spin dynamics is dominating over the non - equilibrium dynamics in the ferromagnetic phase ( weak time dependent ) and the spin dynamics , then , approaches toward a time independent disordered ( paramagnetic ) phase as observed at 280k .",
    "the relaxation data along with field dependence of magnetization data also confirm that there is no long range ferromagnetic order , rather the system is a canted ferromagnet . + the most attractive feature of the present system is that the magnetic ordering and transport properties are highly correlated .",
    "the mssbauer analysis suggests the existence of fe@xmath15 and fe@xmath29 ions and charge compensating defects ( due to valence mismatch between ti@xmath12 and fe@xmath15 ions ) like cation vacancies in b site @xcite .",
    "the charge compensating defects can give rise ferromagnetic interactions by renormalizing the concentration of frustrated bonds @xcite .",
    "simultaneously , the charge fluctuations among the cations ( ti@xmath12/fe@xmath29 to ti@xmath15/fe@xmath15 ) in b site clusters will enhance the electron ( polaron ) hoping mechanism @xcite and consequently the system shows large electrical conductivity . on the otherhand",
    ", tetravalent non - magnetic ti@xmath12 ions substitution in place of magnetic fe@xmath15 ions makes the inter - sublattice interactions fe@xmath112-o@xmath17-fe@xmath113 almost negligible and the magnetic interactions depends on the b site superexchange interactions like fe@xmath112-o@xmath17-fe@xmath114 , fe@xmath112-o@xmath17-ti@xmath112 , fe@xmath114-o@xmath17-ti@xmath115 etc . from the various measurements ,",
    "it is observed that although there exists both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic superexchange interactions , the dominant one is the ferromagnetic interactions which is observed from the intercept of the inverse of susceptibility on positive temperature axis .",
    "the appearance of metallic like resistivity behavour in presence of dc field at 80k to 175k range strongly suggest that magnetic exchange interactions are also affecting the electrical properties of the sample .",
    "in conclusion , the present system co@xmath0zn@xmath1fe@xmath2ti@xmath3o@xmath4 exhibits re - entrant magnetic phase transitions , _",
    "i.e. _ paramagnetic to ferromagnetic state at t@xmath5 @xmath24 270k and ferromagnetic to canted spin glass state at t@xmath7 @xmath24 125k .",
    "the re - entrant behaviour in magnetic and in electrical resistivity data is attributed due to the cation vacancy and charge fluctuation effects inside the ferromagnetic clusters ( magnetic polarons ) .",
    "the ferromagnetic state is not a typical long range ordered type , rather than a canted ferromagnetic one , where longitudinal spin components show ferromagnetic order and transverse spin components show spin glass order at low temperature . without neutron diffraction experiment ,",
    "it is very difficult to say whether the ferromagnetic order of longitudinal spin components is still maintaining in canted spin glass state .",
    "however , the variation of exchange interactions , random distributions of cations from cluster to cluster may give rise inhomogeneity in electronic phase , _",
    "i.e. _ a mixture of metallic ( ferromagnetic ) and semi - conducting ( antiferromagnetic ) components within the same cluster , eventhough , the system is in same crystallographic ( cubic spinel ) phase .",
