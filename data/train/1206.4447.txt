    "studies of pattern formation in reaction - diffusion systems far from equilibrium constitute a firmly established research field . starting from the pioneering work by turing @xcite and prigogine @xcite , self - organized structures in distributed active media with activator - inhibitor dynamics",
    "have been extensively investigated and various non - equilibrium patterns , such as rotating spirals , traveling pulses , propagating fronts or stationary dissipative structures could be observed @xcite .",
    "recently , the attention became turned to network analogs of classical reaction - diffusion systems , where the nodes are occupied by active elements and the links represent diffusive connections between them .",
    "such situations are typical for epidemiology where spreading of diseases over transportation networks takes place @xcite .",
    "the networks can also be formed by diffusively coupled chemical reactors @xcite or biological cells @xcite . in distributed ecological systems",
    ", they consist of individual habitats with dispersal connections between them @xcite .",
    "detailed investigations of synchronization phenomena in oscillatory systems @xcite and of infection spreading over networks @xcite have been performed .",
    "turing patterns in activator - inhibitor network systems have also been considered @xcite .",
    "the analysis of bistable media is of principal importance in the theory of pattern formation in reaction - diffusion systems .",
    "traveling fronts which represent waves of transition from one stable state to another are providing a classical example of self - organized wave patterns ; they are also playing an important role in understanding of more complex self - organization behavior in activator - inhibitor systems and excitable media ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the velocity and the profile of a traveling front are uniquely determined by the properties of the medium and do not depend on initial conditions .",
    "depending on the parameters of a medium , either spreading or retreating fronts can generally be found .",
    "stationary fronts , which separate regions with two different stable states , are not characteristic for continuous media ; they are found only at special parameter values where a transition from spreading to retreating waves takes place .",
    "when discrete systems , formed by chains or fractal structures of diffusively coupled bistable elements , are considered , traveling fronts can however become pinned if diffusion is weak enough , so that stable stationary fronts , which are found within entire parameter regions , may arise @xcite .    in the present study , pattern formation in complex networks formed by diffusively coupled bistable elements",
    "is numerically and analytically investigated .",
    "our numerical simulations , performed for random erds - rnyi ( er ) or scale - free networks and for irregular trees , reveal a rich variety of time - dependent and stationary patterns .",
    "the analogs of spreading and retreating fronts are observed .",
    "furthermore , stationary patterns , localized on subsets of network nodes , are found . to understand such phenomena , an approximate analytical theory for the networks representing regular trees",
    "is developed .",
    "the theory yields the bifurcation diagram which determines pinning conditions for trees with different branching factors and for different diffusion constants .",
    "its results are used to interpret the behavior found in irregular trees and for er networks .",
    "statistical properties of stationary patterns in large random networks are moreover analyzed in the framework of the mean - field approximation , which has been originally proposed for spreading - infection problems @xcite and has also been used in the analysis of turing patterns on the networks @xcite .",
    "classical one - component reaction - diffusion systems in continuous media are described by equations of the form    @xmath0    where @xmath1 is the local activator density , function @xmath2 specifies local bistable dynamics ( see methods ) and @xmath3 is the diffusion coefficient .",
    "depending on the particular context , the activator variable @xmath4 may represent concentration of a chemical or biological species which amplifies ( i.e. auto - catalyzes ) its own production .    in the present study",
    ", we consider analogs of the phenomena described by the model , which are however taking place on networks . in network - organized systems ,",
    "the activator species occupies the nodes of a network and can be transported over network links to other nodes .",
    "the connectivity structure of the network can be described in terms of its adjacency matrix @xmath5 whose elements are @xmath6 , if there is a link connecting the nodes @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) , and @xmath10 otherwise .",
    "we consider processes in undirected networks , where the adjacency matrix t is symmetric ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "generally , the network analog of system is given by    @xmath12    where @xmath13 is the amount of activator in network node @xmath7 and @xmath14 describes the local bistable dynamics of the activator .",
    "the last term in eq .   takes into account diffusive coupling between the nodes .",
    "parameter @xmath3 characterizes the rate of diffusive transport of the activator over the network links .    instead of the adjacency matrix , it is convenient to use the laplacian matrix @xmath15 of the network , whose elements are defined as @xmath16 , where @xmath17 for @xmath18 , and @xmath19 otherwise . in this definition , @xmath20 is the degree , or the number of connections , of node @xmath7 given by @xmath21 . in new notations",
    "eq .   takes the form    @xmath22    when the considered network is a lattice , its laplacian matrix coincides with the finite - difference expression for the laplacian differential operator after discretization on this lattice .",
    "a classical example of a one - component system exhibiting bistable dynamics is the schlgl model @xcite .",
    "this model describes a hypothetical trimolecular chemical reaction which exhibits bistability ( see methods ) . in the schlgl model ,",
    "the nonlinear function @xmath2 is a cubic polynomial    @xmath23    so that @xmath24 has one maximum at @xmath25 and two minima at @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",

    "this configuration was found to generate a wave of transition from the passive to the active states .",

    "if the initial activation was set on the nodes with moderate degrees , the activation could neither spread nor retreat , thus staying as a stationary localized structure . on the other hand , traveling fronts",
    "could also become pinned when some nodes were reached , so that the activation could not spread over the entire network and stationary patterns with coexistence of the two states were established .",
    "degrees of the nodes play an important role in front pinning . in the representation used in fig .",
    "[ fig : erstationaryneato ] , the nodes with higher degrees lie in the center , whereas the nodes with small degrees are located in the periphery of the network . to produce the stationary pattern shown in this figure , some of the central hub nodes were set into the active state @xmath47 , while all other nodes were in the passive state @xmath48 .",
    "the activation front started to propagate towards the periphery , but the front became pinned and a stationary pattern was formed .",
    "figure  [ fig : erstationary ] shows another example of a stationary pattern . here , we have sorted network nodes according to their degrees , so that the degree of a node becomes higher as its index @xmath7 is increased ( the stepwise red curve indicates the degrees of the nodes ) .",

    "the networks shown in fig .  [ fig : specialtree ] consist of the component trees with the branching factors @xmath52 and @xmath53 which are connected at their origins .",
    "if the activation is initially applied to the central node , it spreads for @xmath39 through the trees with branching factors @xmath54 and @xmath55 , but can not propagate through the trees with higher branching factors ( fig .",
    "[ fig : specialtree]a ) . if we choose a larger diffusion constant @xmath56 and apply activation to a subset of nodes inside the tree with the branching factor @xmath53 , the activation retreats and dies out ( fig .",
    "[ fig : specialtree]b ) .",
    "when diffusion is weak ( @xmath57 ) , the application of activation inside the component trees leads to its spreading towards the roots of the trees .",
    "the activation can not however propagate further and pinned stationary structures are formed ( fig .",

    "thus , we see that both traveling fronts and pinned stationary structures can be observed in the networks .",
    "our numerical simulations suggest that degrees of the nodes ( and the related branching factors in the trees ) should play an important role in such phenomena .",

    "let us consider the model for a regular tree with the branching factor @xmath51 .",

    "suppose that we have taken a node which belongs to the shell @xmath60 .",
    "this node should be diffusively coupled to @xmath51 nodes in the next shell @xmath62 and to just one node in the previous shell @xmath63 . introducing the activation level @xmath64 in the shell @xmath60 , the evolution of the activator distribution on the tree",
    "can therefore be described by the equation    @xmath65    note that for @xmath66 , eq .",

    "comparing the situations for the chains of coupled single elements and for coupled shells in a tree ( eq .  ) , an important difference should be stressed . in a chain , both propagation directions ( left or right ) are equivalent , because of the chain symmetry .",
    "in contrast to this , an activation front propagating from the root to the periphery of a tree is physically different from the front propagating in the opposite direction , i.e. towards the tree root .",
    "as we shall soon see , one of such fronts can be spreading while the other can be pinned or retreating for the same set of model parameters .",

    "traveling fronts represent classical examples of non - equilibrium patterns in bistable reaction - diffusion media . as shown in our study , such patterns are also possible in networks of diffusively coupled bistable elements , but their properties are significantly different .",
    "in addition to spreading or retreating activation fronts , stationary fronts are found within large parameter regions .",
    "the behavior of the fronts is highly sensitive to network architecture and degrees of network nodes play an important role here .    in the special case of regular trees , an approximate analytical theory could be constructed .",
    "the theory reveals that branching factors of the trees and , thus , the degrees of their nodes , are essential for front propagation phenomena . by using this approach , front pinning conditions could be derived and parameter boundaries , which separate pinned and traveling fronts , could be determined .",
    "as we have found , propagation conditions are different for the fronts traveling from the tree root to the periphery or in the opposite direction .",
    "generally , all fronts become pinned as the diffusion constant is gradually reduced .",
    "while the theory has been developed for regular trees , where the branching factor is fixed , it is also applicable to irregular trees where node degrees are variable .",
    "indeed , at sufficiently weak diffusion the front pinning occurs locally and its conditions are effectively determined only by the degrees of the nodes at which a front becomes pinned .",
    "the results of such analysis are relevant for understanding the phenomena of activation spreading and pinning in large random networks .",
    "it is well known ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) that , in the large size limit , random networks are locally approximated by the trees . if the number of connections ( the degree ) of a node is much smaller than the total number of nodes in a network , the probability that a neighbor of a given node is also connected to another neighbor of the same node is small , implying that the local pattern of connections in the vicinity of a node has a tree structure",
    "this property holds as long as the number of nodes in the considered neighborhood is still much smaller that the total number of nodes in the network .",
    "previously , the local tree approximation has been successfully used in the analysis of pacemakers in large random oscillatory networks @xcite .    when activation is applied to a node in a large random network , it spreads through a subnetwork of its neighbors and , at sufficiently short distances from the original node",
    ", such subnetwork should be a tree .",
    "hence , our study of front propagation on the trees is also providing a theory for the initial stage of front spreading from a single activated node in large random networks . depending on the diffusion constant and other parameters , the fronts may become pinned while the activation has not yet spread far away from the original node .",
    "whenever this takes place , the approximate pinning theory , constructed for the trees , is applicable .",
    "on the other hand , if the activation spreads far from the origin and a large fraction of network nodes become thus affected , the patterns can be well understood with the mean - field approximation .",
    "this approximation , proposed in the analysis of infection spreading on networks @xcite , has also been applied to analyze turing patterns in network - organized activator - inhibitor systems @xcite and effects of turbulence in oscillator networks @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we have applied this approximation to the analysis of stationary activity distributions in random erds - rnyi and scale - free networks of diffusively coupled bistable elements .",
    "we could observe that , within the mean - field approximation , statistical properties of network activity distributions are well reproduced .",
    "it should be noted that , similar to previous studies @xcite , the mean - field values used in the theory were taken from direct numerical simulations and were not obtained through the solution of a consistency equation .",
    "hence , we could only demonstrate that such an approximation is applicable for the statistical description of the emerging stationary patterns , but did not use it here for the prediction of such patterns .",
    "thus , our investigations have shown that a rich behavior involving traveling and pinned fronts is characteristic for networks of diffusively coupled bistable elements . in the past",
    ", pinned fronts were observed in the experiments using weakly coupled bistable chemical reactors on a ring @xcite .",
    "it will be interesting to perform similar experiments for the networks of coupled chemical reactors .",
    "recent developments in nanotechnology allow to design chemical reactors at the nanoscale and couple them by diffusive connections to build networks @xcite .",
    "it should be also noted that , while the chemical schlgl model has been used in our numerical simulations , the results are general and applicable to any networks formed by diffusively coupled bistable elements .",
    "the phenomena of front spreading and pinning should be possible for diffusively coupled ecological populations and similar effects may be involved when epidemics spreading under bistability conditions is considered .",
