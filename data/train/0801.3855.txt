    "we are interested in studying the region @xmath7 to see how the order develops as the interchain coupling is increased .",
    "[ square ]    one reason for strong interest in these models is that the heisenberg model with @xmath8 provides the dominant terms in the hamiltonian for the material cs@xmath9cucl@xmath10@xcite .",
    "the exchange parameters of this material have been determined from high - field studies@xcite , by measuring the excitation energies around the fully polarized limit . in zero field , these materials are found to have spiral long - range order in the ground state@xcite .",

    "spin - wave theories@xcite can account for the spin - wave dispersion in the materials only after substantially modifying the exchange parameters . on the other hand ,",
    "series expansions around the spiral state give an excellent account of the main peaks observed experimentally in the spectra throughout the brillouin zone , with the observed exchange parameters@xcite . in another approach to the spectra of these materials , kohno et al.@xcite",
    "have shown that many features of the experimental spectra , including the observed continuum can be well explained by considering weakly coupled heisenberg chains , even though the interchain coupling is not too small in the material .    in another recent study , directly relevant to the present work , starykh and balents@xcite",
    "have considered the frustrated weakly coupled chain problem using a renormalization group approach .",
    "their striking prediction is that a colinear - phase is stabilized in place of the classical spiral phase for sufficiently weak coupling between the chains .",
    "the phase corresponds precisely to the four - sublattice phase that is known to occur in the square - lattice @xmath11 model at large @xmath12@xcite .",
    "other analytical , numerical and variational studies have also been used to study this anisotropic triangular - lattice model@xcite .",
    "several of these have found evidence for disordered spin - liquid phases in the model at weak coupling between the chains .",
    "most notably the variational calculations of sorella and coworkers find two distinct spin - liquid phases in the model .",
    "furthermore , the dmrg studies@xcite of weng _ et al .",
    "_ showed a very rapid exponential decrease in correlations perpendicular to the chains even for rather large interchain couplings .",
    "one possible concern with these studies is that periodic boundary conditions were used and that can play a role in destabilizing non - colinear phases if they occur at incommensurate wavevectors .",
    "earlier series expansion studies@xcite also found that the energies from spiral - phase series expansions and dimer expansions were very close . in general ,",
    "numerical studies of weakly coupled chains in frustrated geometries have been a challenging problem@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we revisit this model for the spin - half case and also study the corresponding spin - one model .",
    "to our knowledge , this is the first quantitative numerical study of the spin - one model .",
    "we use an ising - type linked - cluster expansion method@xcite at zero temperature around different phases .",
    "ground state energy and sublattice magnetization have been calculated for each phase .",
    "the knowledge of the exact behavior of the 1-d spin - half model@xcite , with its essential singularity in the energy and magnetization functions@xcite , is used to improve the series extrapolations in the 1-d limit , and they are also used to get more accurate estimates of the ground state energies with inter - chain couplings . while both colinear and non - colinear phases can be stabilized in our studies for the spin - half model , we always find the energy of the non - colinear phase to be lower .",
    "however , the results are quite sensitive to the way the series are analyzed , especially in the limit of weak interachain couplings , and this implies some uncertainties in our results that can not be addressed by series expansions alone . further numerical studies of these models would be useful .",
    "we have also investigated the spin - one model , with unfrustrated ( square - lattice geometry ) and frustrated ( triangular - lattice geometry ) interchain couplings . in this case",
    ", the 1-d limit corresponds to a haldane gap phase .",
    "the ising expansions are known to break down before the heisenberg symmetry is restored , with a critical point which is in the universality class of the 2-d ising model .",
    "we find that when the chains are coupled in an unfrustrated manner a rather small interchain coupling ( @xmath13 ) leads to nel order . on the other hand , in the frustrated geometry a much larger interchain coupling ( @xmath14 )",
    "is needed to obtain long - range order . in the latter case ,",
    "we only find the spiral phase to be stabilized for heisenberg models .",
    "the colinear - phase becomes less and less stable with increased inter - chain coupling .",

    "series coefficients for the sublattice magnetization of this model are generated up to order @xmath40 in @xmath28 .",
    "their anaylsis is carried out in two different ways : ( i ) using integrated differential approximants ( ida ) on the series obtained ; ( ii ) using biassed integrated differential approximants ( bida ) on the natural logarithm of the same series .",
    "the first approach is the most straightforward and simply fits the known coefficients of the series to a homogeneous or inhomogeneous differential equation of the form @xmath41 where @xmath42 are polynomials of degree @xmath43 respectively .",
    "the results reported in this section are obtained by setting the polynomial @xmath44 and @xmath45 to zero , which is equivalent to a dlog pad analysis @xmath46    the second analysis method proceeds by taking the natural logarithm of the calculated series in order to reduce the essential singularity ( [ essential ] ) into an algebraic one @xmath47 with critical exponents @xmath48 .",
    "a sigularity of this form can easily be analyzed by using an ida type of analysis .",
    "moreover , a better convergence can be achieved by biassing the exponent in the analysis .",
    "this simply means that the function @xmath49 in ( [ dlogpade ] ) is forced to have an algebraic singularity of the form ( [ algebraic ] ) with critical exponent @xmath50 , as known from exact result .",
    "[ fig : magnetization ] shows the comparison between the two analysis methods and the exact result .",

    "the approximants obtained by biassed ida on the natural logarithm of the series , reproduces the behavior of the series close to the critical point much better .",
    "this is expected as it is extremely difficult to account for an essential singularity of the form ( [ essential ] ) with a short , finite series without the biassing . on the other hand ,",
    "[ fig : magnetization ] shows that , once the essential singularity has been reduced to an algebraic one , by taking the natural logarithm of the series , even a finite series up to ten terms can reproduce quite well the exact behavior of the system all the way to the critical point .",

    "we consider a range of @xmath22-values and minimize the energy with respect to @xmath22 .",
    "for each value of @xmath12 , we then calculate the ratio series @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the energy series calculated at a specific value of @xmath12 and @xmath55 is the energy series computed for the 1-d model .",
    "the idea behind this is that , if the series for @xmath56 has apparent singularities as a function of @xmath28 , as a consequence of being close to the 1-d limit , we can eliminate its effect by taking the ratio .",
    "this allows us to evaluate the energy with increased accuracy .",
    "moreover , to improve convergence , an additional term is added to the hamiltonian ( 2 ) as in previous studies@xcite .",
    "@xmath57 for @xmath52 , the limit we are interested in , this has no effect on the hamiltonian .",
    "the amplitude of the convergence term @xmath58 is generally taken as 1 . the extrapolated series ratio ( [ ratio ] ) is multiplied by the exact result for the 1-d case , @xmath59 , to obtain the energies at different @xmath12 .",
    "[ fig : energy ] shows the obtained results . in this plot ,",
    "the error bars reflect the spread of well - behaved approximants . at @xmath6",
    "the energy for the ncaf phase is centered around @xmath60 , in good agreement with earlier studies@xcite . for @xmath7 ,",

    "the inset shows that even for @xmath61 , the lowest data point taken in our calculation , the ncaf phase appears to have lower energy than the caf phase .",
    "however , while this result is suggestive that the ncaf phase is the correct phase of the model , we should emphasize that our results are sensitive to how the series are analyzed , especially near the decoupled chain limit .",
    "hence , further numerical studies of this model , looking in an unbiassed way at short distance spin correlations , would be useful .      in this section",
    ", we study the sublattice magnetization for @xmath62 . because the sublattice magnetization vanishes for the 1-d model , it is not useful to consider the ratio of the sublattice magnetization series with that at @xmath19 .",

    "they lead to similar results but with no improved convergence .",
    "the series analysis is even less reliable in the caf phase .",
    "it is possible that the results at small @xmath12 are strongly influenced by the nearby essential singularity at @xmath19 .    motivated by the idea that the nearby singularity at @xmath19 may be influencing the series analysis",
    ", we take the following approach : we subtract off for each value of @xmath62 the series for the 1-d limit ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "this should eliminate the influence of the essential singularities .",
    "we then analyze the series with standard ida .",

    "[ wavevector ]      in the 1-d limit , it is well known that the heisenberg system is in the haldane gap phase@xcite .",

    "once , the couplings @xmath12 are turned on , we would like to follow @xmath72 as a function of @xmath12 to see when it reaches unity .",

    "the caf phase becomes less and less stable with interchain coupling and is never realized for the heisenberg models ( @xmath28 equal to unity ) .",
    "in contrast , the spiral phase become more stable with interchain coupling and for some @xmath12 the critical @xmath28 reaches unity .",
    "it turns out that this way of studying the critical @xmath12 is less accurate than an alternative method discussed below .    a better way to compute critical @xmath12 needed to close",

    "this leads to estimates for @xmath74 of approximately @xmath76 and @xmath77 respectively with exponent values which are around a third , as expected for 3-d models@xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath78 for the former is consistent with chain mean - field theory estimates@xcite . it is clear that this kind of frustration significantly extends the haldane gap phase .",
    "note that this is very different from a material like csnicl@xmath79,@xcite where a given chain has six neighboring chains arranged in a triangular - lattice geometry .",
    "in that case , the chains themselves remain unfrustrated and frustration only affects the relative spin - orientation between the chains@xcite .",
    "the latter is much less effective in preventing long - range order .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the spin - half and spin - one heisenberg models in spin - chains that are coupled in an anisotropic triangular - lattice geometry , where a spin in one chain is coupled to two neighboring spins in another chain .",
    "this geometry is particularly effective in preventing the development of spin correlations between chains , and in altering spin correlations within a chain . for the spin - half case ,",
    "both colinear antiferromagnetic phase and non - colinear antiferromagnetic phase are possible in this geometry .",
    "though , in our calculations , the non - colinear phase appears to have a lower energy .",
    "further unbiassed ways of studying this competition numerically would be useful .",
    "short distance spin correlations can be used to distinguish between the different phases .",
    "though , potential biassing due to boundary conditions should be taken into account .",
    "for the spin - one model also , we find that this geometry significantly enhances the stability of one - dimensional haldane gap phase , and prevents the development of long range magnetic order .",
    "this geometry is quite different from materials like csnicl@xmath79 , where frustration does not lead to competing correlations along any given chain and thus the haldane gap phase is quickly destroyed",
    ". it would be interesting if materials similar to the spin - half materials cs@xmath9cucl@xmath10 and cs@xmath9cubr@xmath10 are found with spin - one .",
    "the study of such materials would shed further light on the role of interchain frustration and the extension of one - dimensional physics to higher dimensional systems ."
