    "nonlinear interference effect ( nie)[1 ] occurs in the presence of strong driving and probing fields with arbitrary amplitude at the adjacent transition .",
    "important feature of this phenomenon is the presence of nonlinear interference term in polarization , responsible for two - photon transition .",
    "electromagnetically induction transparency ( eit ) has been used in optical clock at frequency between @xmath0 and @xmath1 in neutral bosons like strontium @xmath2[2 ] and ytterbium yb[3 ] .",
    "analysis of solutions for the absorption coefficient [ 3 ] showed that value of eit and its width are weakly dependent on width of laser line(frequency fluctuations of driving and probing fields ) in their mutual phasing .",
    "that difference helps to stabilize the frequency of laser .",
    "so by using this frequency difference , laser with narrow radiation line can be stabilized .",
    "this process helps to get optical clock with ultra - high stability at frequency resonance of eit . in [ 4 ] , it has been shown that at far distance of absorption line , near eit frequency resonance , we got two - photon absorption resonance .",
    "this resonance has large amplitude like amplitude of absorption resonance at the center of line .",
    "aim of this work is theoretically analysis of signal and frequency response of three - level system on eit .",
    "we studied these features in monochromatic and noisy fields to implement the optical standards of frequency on forbidden transition in traps of yb .",
    "we showed that two - photon absorption resonance not only has considerable amplitude compared with eit resonance , but also narrow width when there are significantly different probabilities of transitions from the upper common level to the lower long - life levels .",
    "two - photon absorption resonance is much less sensitive to the amplitude and phase noises of driving and probing field compared with eit resonance , using this resonance to implement standards of frequency seems attractive .",
    "what is more two - photon absorption resonance is shifted in frequency from eit resonance by the amount of stark shift .",
    "but stark shift can be offset by changes in amplitude of probing field , also two - photon absorption resonance exactly is at frequency resonance when rabi frequency is equal to frequencies of driving and probing fields .",
    "it means when frequency difference between lasers is equal to frequency of forbidden transition .",
    "we note that in [ 5 ] , this method has been studied based on the solutions of schrdinger equation for wave function in excitation scheme by raman pulses . in general words , narrow width , large amplitude , stability and possibility to offset stark shift augur well for the use of using two - photon absorption resonance in optical clocks .",
    "we studied steady solutions of element of density matrix for monochromatic driving field at 2 - 3 transition and probing field at 1 - 2 transition [ 6 ] .",
    "equations for elements of density matrix in @xmath3-scheme for three - level system with common level 2 and long - life levels 1 and 3 by using rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) are : @xmath4 where @xmath5=difference between frequency of laser and transition frequency @xmath6 .",
    "transition probability , @xmath8-line width , elements with a bar means real part and two bars means imaginary part .",
    "matrix elements of interaction energy which describe interaction of fields with atoms during k@xmath9 i transition are : @xmath10 . where v(t ) = slow term of matrix elements of interaction energy , introduced for monochromatic fields of rabi frequency .",
    "for general situation , with different phases , phase can be engaged in equations : @xmath11 where  @xmath12 amplitude ,  @xmath13-matrix element of dipole transition ,  @xmath14-amplitude electrical field and  @xmath15-phase of laser field . in case of closed atomic structure@xmath16 . for steady state , when the derivatives of the matrix elements of the time - zero , the system of equations becomes algebraic system with constant or slightly varying coefficients of the time .",
    "condition for the steady state has the form [ 6 ] @xmath17 in the case of long - life lower levels with line width  @xmath18 and  @xmath19 , steady solution is acceptable only for monochromatic field not for noises of laser field.it means that every fluctuation in the frequencies of the fields or their difference led to perturbation of steady state .",
    "also in this case amplitude and width of eit resonance depend on width of laser line deeply , which is obvious from the analysis of solutions .",
    "steady solutions for matrix equation(1)are : @xmath20 where  @xmath21 and ; @xmath22 population difference  @xmath23 can be find as : @xmath24 where@xmath25 .",
    "f depends on transition population between levels(d ) and non - coherent pumping : @xmath26 populations of one - photon and two - photon absorptions are : @xmath27 for @xmath3-system , populations  @xmath28 are : @xmath29 we compare the solutions obtained by direct integration of the time , followed by fourier transformation , with analytical solutions for the case of monochromatic fields .",
    "also we investigated the numerical solutions for the time variation of the density matrix elements for both monochromatic and for noisy fields .",
    "polarization spectrum is detected from the time course of the diagonal elements using the fourier transform(cfft ) .",
    "@xmath30 max load capacity spectrum has the form : @xmath31 absorption coefficient for probing field during 1@xmath92 transitions is obtained from relationship of the detuning of the spectral components from frequency of probing field : @xmath32 where@xmath33-concentration of normal atoms and ,  @xmath34-wave length . for the weak probing field @xmath35 , in the absence of incoherent pumping between levels 2 and 3 for absorption is a relatively simple expression , gotten from general answer of system ( 4)[6 ] : @xmath36 typical absorption section around two - photon absorption resonance has been shown in figure.2 for these parameters of fields and atom:@xmath37 . as can be seen , for large  @xmath38 in the far distance of absorption line , is narrow two - photon absorption resonance .",

    "calculations showed that amplitude of two - photon absorption resonance is equal to the amount of absorption coefficient at the center of line for one - photon absorption .",

    "we proved that amplitude of this resonance is large and its width is narrow .",
    "time dependences of density matrix elements give us information about dynamics of processes responsible for two - photon absorption , formation processes of dark eit resonances and coherent trapping ( cpt ) .",
    "in this work , we also studied dynamics of these processes in monochromatic and noisy fields also the effects of non - monochromatic fields on absorption spectrum .",
