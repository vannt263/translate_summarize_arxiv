    "the interfacial behaviour of fluids in contact with structured substrates has received considerable attention in the last years @xcite .",
    "this research is essential for the lab - on - a - chip applications , which aim to miniaturize chemical plants to chip format @xcite .",
    "the advances in lithography techniques allow to sculpt grooves of controlled geometry on solid substrates on the micro- and nano - scales @xcite , which has allowed experimental studies of the influence of the geometry on fluid adsorption @xcite . from a theoretical point of view ,",
    "wetting and related phenomena at planar substrates have been studied in depth for simple fluids @xcite . for rough substrates ,",
    "macroscopic models lead to phenomenological laws for fluid adsorption on rough substrates , such as the wenzel law @xcite and the cassie - baxter law @xcite .",
    "the adsorption of fluids on microstructured substrates shows distinct characteristics compared to planar systems @xcite .",
    "an example of this feature is the filling transition observed in linear - wedge shaped grooves @xcite , in which the wedge is completely filled by liquid when the contact angle @xmath2 associated to the sessile droplet on a flat substrate is equal to the tilt angle @xmath3 of the wedge with respect to the horizontal plane .",
    "however , macroscopic arguments show that it may appear in other microstructured substrates @xcite .",
    "the filling transition in the wedge has been studied extensively in last years @xcite . however , other substrate geometries have been also studied , such as capped capillaries @xcite , crenellated substrates @xcite , parabolic pits @xcite , and sinusoidal substrates @xcite .",
    "earlier studies relied on interfacial hamiltonian theories , but in recent times , density - functional theories have been applied , from simple square - gradient functionals , to more sofisticated functionals such as the fundamental measure theory .    in this paper",
    "we revisit the study of fluid adsorption on sinusoidal substrates , paying special attention to filling and wetting transitions . unlike previous interfacial hamiltonian studies @xcite , which were restricted to shallow substrates , we consider intermediate and large values of the roughness .",
    "we consider a more microscopic model ( the landau - ginzburg model ) , which allows us to extract the order parameter profile ( i.e. density in our case ) by minimizing a square - gradient functional . from these results , we are able to locate the gas - liquid interface ( by imposing a crossing criterion on the order parameter profile ) and the different interfacial transitions are obtained by the crossing or merging of the free - energy branches associated to different interfacial states as the thermodynamic fields are changed .",
    "the adsorption phenomenology will be analyzed and compared with previous approaches , in particular the macroscopic theory and interfacial hamiltonian model studies .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec2 ] is devoted to the description of the macroscopic theory of adsorption and its application to sinusoidal substrates . in section [ sec3 ]",
    "we explain the numerical methodology , while the results are described in section [ sec4 ] .",
    "we present and discuss the main conclusions of our study in section [ sec5 ] .",
    "the paper concludes with an appendix where we revisit the wetting behaviour of the landau - ginzburg model for a flat substrate .",
    ", @xmath4 stands for the liquid and @xmath5 for the vapor . ]    from a macroscopic point of view we can understand much of the phenomenology of fluid adsorption on rough substrates . consider a gas at saturation conditions ( i.e. coexisting with a liquid ) in the presence of a rough substrate , which we will consider translationally invariant along the @xmath6-direction ( with a total length @xmath7 ) and periodic across the @xmath8-direction , with a period @xmath0 much larger than the typical molecular lengthscales .",
    "we assume that the substrate favors nucleation of the liquid phase on its surface .",
    "the height of the substrate is given by a smooth function @xmath9 , which will be assumed to be an even function in its argument .",
    "there are three possible situations which the system may present @xcite : the interfacial dry state ( @xmath10 ) , in which only a thin ( microscopic ) liquid layer is adsorbed on the substrate ; the partially filled state ( @xmath11 ) , in which the substrate grooves are partially filled with liquid up to a height @xmath12 ; and the complete wet state ( @xmath13 ) , in which a thick liquid macroscopic layer between the substrate and the vapor is formed ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) .    to see the relative stability of these phases , we consider the excess surface free energy @xmath14 with respect to the bulk for each state . in the macroscopic approach",
    ", we assume that interactions between the different interfaces is negligible , so the surface free energy can be obtained directly as the sum of the contributions of each surface / interface .",
    "we denote @xmath15 as the total area of the substrate and @xmath16 as its projection on the plane @xmath17 plane .",
    "the surface free energy of the @xmath10 state , @xmath18 , can be obtained from the substrate surface tension between _ flat _ sustrate and a vapour in bulk , @xmath19 , as : @xmath20 on the other hand , the surface free energy of the partially filled state @xmath21 is given by the expression : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the interfacial tension between the liquid and the flat substrate , @xmath24 is the surface tension associated to the liquid - vapor interface , and @xmath25 is the substrate area in contact with the liquid phase , which can be obtained from the value of @xmath26 at which the liquid - vapour interface is in contact with the substrate as @xmath27 where @xmath28 represents the derivative of @xmath29 with respect to @xmath8 . note that the free energy @xmath18 given by ( [ free - energy - dry ] ) corresponds to the limit @xmath30 from ( [ free - energy - filled ] ) .",
    "the value of @xmath31 can be obtained from the minimization of free energy ( [ free - energy - filled ] ) with respect to that parameter . by young s law , which relates the different surface tensions with the surface contact angle @xmath2 : @xmath32 the free energy @xmath33 , ( [ free - energy - filled ] ) can be rewritten as : @xmath34 therefore , as the derivative of this function with respect to @xmath8 must vanish at @xmath26 , the following condition is satisfied @xcite : @xmath35 where @xmath3 is the angle between the liquid - vapor interface and the substrate at the contact @xmath26 .",
    "this result has a clear physical interpretation : the filled region by liquid should make contact with the substrate at the point where @xmath3 is equal to the contact angle @xmath2 .",
    "however , this solution is only a local minimum if @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "finally , the interfacial free energy for the state of complete wet state @xmath37 is given by : @xmath38 notice that macroscopically this expression corresponds to the limit @xmath39 of ( [ free - energy - filled ] ) .",
    "several transitions between the different interfacial states may be observed . at low temperatures",
    "the most stable state is the dry state , whereas at high temperatures ( i.e. above the wetting temperature of the flat substrate ) the preferred state corresponds to complete wetting . therefore , for intermediate temperatures must exist phase transitions between different interfacial states .",
    "for example , a wetting transition between @xmath10 and @xmath13 can occur when both states have the same free energy : @xmath40 using young s law ( [ young ] ) , we obtain the following condition for the wetting transition : @xmath41 where the roughness parameter is defined as @xmath42 .",
    "this is precisely the result obtained by wenzel law @xcite : the contact angle of a liquid drop on a rough substrate , @xmath43 , is related to the contact angle of a flat substrate @xmath2 via the expression @xmath44 .",
    "therefore , as the wetting transition occurs when @xmath45 , we recover the expression ( [ wetting - wenzel ] ) .",
    "it is also possible a transition from a dry state to a filled state .",
    "this transition is called in the literature either _ filling _ @xcite or _ unbending _ @xcite transition .",
    "the filling transition occurs when : @xmath46 which leads to the expression : @xmath47 where @xmath48 .",
    "if this transition occurs at temperatures below the predicted by ( [ wetting - wenzel ] ) , then wenzel law is no longer valid .",
    "in fact , under these conditions the macroscopic theory predicts that the wetting transition will occur between an @xmath11 and @xmath13 state when : @xmath49 now we will restrict ourselves to the sinusoidal substrate , characterized by an amplitude @xmath1 and a wavenumber @xmath50 , with the subtrate height @xmath9 given by : @xmath51 for this substrate , @xmath52 and @xmath15 can be expressed in terms of incomplete elliptic integral of the second kind @xmath53 as : @xmath54 therefore , the roughness parameters @xmath55 and @xmath56 can be expressed as : @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the complete elliptic integral of the second kind , and where @xmath31 can be obtained from ( [ filling - equil - cond ] ) as : @xmath59 this solution only exists if @xmath60 . under these conditions",
    ", it is easy to see that there is another solution to ( [ filling - equil - cond ] ) : @xmath61 which corresponds to a maximum of free energy @xmath33 .",
    "this can be seen from the behavior free energy @xmath18 taking @xmath62 as a free parameter in the range @xmath63 $ ] . for small @xmath8",
    ", we can see from ( [ free - energy - filled-2 ] ) that @xmath64 , and therefore it is an increasing function at @xmath65 . on the other hand , for @xmath66 , @xmath67 , which is also an increasing function at @xmath68 . therefore , since @xmath69 and by continuity of the free energy function @xmath70 , we conclude that @xmath31 given by ( [ xc ] ) must correspond to a minimum of @xmath70 , and @xmath71 given by ( [ xc2 ] ) to a maximum .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows graphically the behavior of @xmath72 for different situations . as mentioned above ,",
    "the @xmath11 state exists only if @xmath73 , which corresponds to the spinodal of this state . by decreasing @xmath2 ( increasing temperature )",
    ", the free energy of the filled state , i.e. @xmath74 , decreases until reaches the value of @xmath18 for @xmath75 at the filling transition . as a consequence ,",
    "the macroscopic theory predicts that the filling transition must be first - order . on the other hand , note that @xmath76 for @xmath77",
    "this observation has two consequences .",
    "first , the filling transition occurs at lower temperatures than the complete wetting temperature predicted by the wenzel law .",
    "as @xmath2 is further decreased , the thermodynamic equilibrium state corresponds to @xmath11 .",
    "so , filling transition preempts wenzel complete wetting transition .",
    "the value of @xmath31 given by ( [ xc ] ) increases as @xmath2 decreases and reaches the value of @xmath78 for @xmath79 .",
    "therefore , the macroscopic theory predicts that the wetting transition on a sinusoidal substrate is _ continuous _ and occurs at the same temperature that for the the flat substrate .",
    "therefore the existence of first - order wetting transitions ( and associated off - coexistence transitions such as prewetting ) can not be predicted by the macroscopic theory .     as a function of @xmath80 for @xmath81 and contact",
    "angles : @xmath82 ( dotted line ) , @xmath83 ( dashed line ) , @xmath75 ( solid line ) , @xmath84 ( dot - dashed line ) , and @xmath79 ( double dot - dashed line ) . ]    figure [ fig3 ] shows the dependence of the contact angle at filling transition , @xmath85 , and the value of @xmath31 at the filling transition , @xmath86 , as a function of @xmath87 .",
    "we see that , for large @xmath87 , @xmath88 scales as @xmath89 , while @xmath90 is quite insensitive to the value of @xmath87 and asymptotically tends to a constant as @xmath91 . to explain this behaviour ,",
    "recall that the values of @xmath85 and @xmath86 solve simultaneously ( [ filling - equil - cond ] ) and ( [ df21 ] ) . for large @xmath92 , we can approximate @xmath93 for @xmath94 .",
    "thus , ( [ filling - equil - cond ] ) leads to the condition : @xmath95 which is compatible with ( [ xc ] ) if @xmath96 . substituting this expression in ( [ df21 ] )",
    ", we reach to the following equation for @xmath86 : @xmath97 with a solution @xmath98 .",
    "consequently , the midpoint interfacial height for rough substrates is almost independent of @xmath0 , and approximately equal to @xmath99 . substituting ( [ xcfrough ] ) into ( [ fecrough ] ) , we have the following asymptotic expression for @xmath85 : @xmath100 we see from figure [ fig3 ] that these asymptotic expressions are extremely accurate for values of @xmath101 .     for @xmath102 as a function of @xmath87 .",
    "the dashed line corresponds to the asymptotic expression ( [ thetafrough ] ) .",

    "bottom panel : plot of @xmath90 as a function of @xmath87 .",
    "the dashed line is the limiting value from the asympotic analysis .",
    "inset : plot of the midpoint interfacial height above the substrate of the @xmath11 state at the filling transition , @xmath104 , in units of the substrate amplitude @xmath1 , as a function of @xmath87 .",
    "the dashed line corresponds to the asymptotic value for @xmath91 . ]    to finish the description of the macroscopic theory , we note that both @xmath10 and @xmath11 states can also be obtained out of the two - phase coexistence . in the case of the @xmath11 states ,",
    "they can observed on a limited range of values of chemical potencial close to coexistence , where the liquid is still a metastable state .",
    "their typical configurations are shown in figure [ fig1](iv ) : the liquid - vapour interface is no longer flat but shows a cylindrical shape , with a radius given by the young - laplace equation : @xmath105 where @xmath106 and @xmath107 are the liquid and vapour densities at coexistence , and @xmath108 is the chemical potential shift with respect to the coexistence value .",
    "the free energy @xmath21 is obtained by making a suitable modification of ( [ free - energy - filled-2 ] ) as : @xmath109 at the equilibrium configuration the liquid - vapour interface makes contact with the substrate at a value @xmath26 where the angle between the liquid - vapour interface and the substrate is equal to the contact angle for the flat substrate @xmath2 , so @xmath31 is the solution of the following implicit equation : @xmath110 for the sinusoidal substrate , this equation reads : @xmath111 which can be solved numerically or graphically , with a solution @xmath112 which is a function of @xmath2 , @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "the off - coexistence filling transition occurs when @xmath115 . by using ( [ free - energy - filled-3 ] ) and ( [ outcoexistence1 ] ) , it is possible to find numerically the characteristics of the @xmath11 state which is at equilibrium with the @xmath10 state . for the sinusoidal substrate",
    ", we find that @xmath112 is a function only of @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "our numerics show that , for fixed @xmath113 , the midpoint interfacial height @xmath4 , defined as : @xmath116 decreases as @xmath114 decreases ( i.e. @xmath117 increases ) , until vanishes for some critical value of @xmath114 .",
    "this state corresponds to the macroscopic theory prediction for the critical point of the filling transition .",
    "our starting point is the landau - ginzburg functional for subcritical temperatures : @xmath118\\nonumber\\\\&+&\\int_{s } d\\mathbf{s } \\frac{c}{2}(m - m_{s})^2 \\label{redfree - energy3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] based on a magnetization order - parameter @xmath119 .",
    "as explained in the appendix , with this choice the bulk magnetization at coexistence takes the value @xmath120 or @xmath121 , and the bulk correlation length @xmath122 , which provides the unit of length for all length scales . taking into account the continuous translational symmetry along the @xmath6-axis , and",
    "the periodicity across the @xmath8-axis , the minimization of the functional ( [ redfree - energy3 ] ) is performed in the geometry depicted in figure [ fig4 ] .",
    "the bottom boundary is one period of the sinusoidal substrate shape ( [ defpsi ] ) .",
    "the values of the magnetization at this boundary are free , except in the case @xmath123 , where the dirichlet boundary condition @xmath124 is imposed . on the top boundary at @xmath125 ,",
    "the magnetization is fixed to the bulk value ( @xmath121 if @xmath102 ) .",
    "the value of @xmath126 must be large enough in order to mimic the effect of an infinite domain .",
    "we take as value of @xmath127 , for which we did not find any size - effect .",
    "finally , periodic boundary conditions are imposed at the vertical boundaries .",
    "we have numerically minimized the free - energy functional ( [ redfree - energy3 ] ) to determine the equilibrium magnetization profiles for different substrate geometries and surface couplings .",
    "the minimization was done with a finite element method , using a conjugate - gradient algorithm to perform the minimization .",
    "the numerical discretization of the continuum problem was performed with adaptive triangulation coupled with the finite - element method in order to resolve different length scales @xcite .",
    "this method was succesfully applied to the minimization of a landau - de gennes functional for the study of interfacial phenomena of nematic liquid crystals in presence of microstructured substrates @xcite . for each substrate geometry and value of surface enhancement @xmath128",
    ", we obtain the different branches of interfacial states @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath13 on a wide range of values of the surface coupling ( either @xmath129 or @xmath130 ) for the bulk ordering field @xmath102 . additionally , in order to locate the off - coexistence filling transition and , when the wetting transition is first - order , the prewetting line , we also explored the different free - energy branches out of coexistence , i. e. @xmath131 . in this case , the values of the surface coupling are restricted to be above the filling and wetting transitions at bulk coexistence , i.e. @xmath102",
    ". the true equilibrium state will be the state that gives the least free energy at the same thermodynamic conditions , and the crossing between the different free - energy branches will correspond to the phase transitions . finally , the interface will be localized by using a crossing criterion , i. e. at the points where the order parameter profile vanishes .",
    "the initial state for each branch is obtained at a suitable value of the surface coupling by using as initial condition for the minimization procedure a state where the magnetization profile takes a constant value @xmath132 for the mesh nodes with @xmath133 ( see figure [ fig4 ] ) , and @xmath121 otherwise .",
    "after minimization , the mesh is adapted and the functional is minimized again .",
    "we iterate this procedure a few times ( typically 2 - 4 times ) .",
    "the value of @xmath134 depends on the branch : @xmath135 for the @xmath10 branch ( i.e. the initial magnetization profile is @xmath121 everywhere ) , @xmath136 for the @xmath13 branch and @xmath137 for the @xmath11 branch .",
    "once the first state is obtained , we may follow the branch slowly modifying the value of the surface coupling , using as initial condition for the next value of the surface coupling the outcome corresponding to the current minimization . alternatively to the procedure outlined above , we may obtain the @xmath13 free - energy branch for @xmath102 by imposing a fixed value of the magnetization @xmath132 on the top boundary , and using as initial magnetization profile @xmath132 everywhere . in order to obtain the free energy of the @xmath13 states , we add to the minimized free energies the contribution due to an interface between the two bulk coexisting phases , which is equal to @xmath138 ( see ( [ sigma+- ] ) ) , where @xmath0 is the period of the sinusoidal substrate in the @xmath8-axis .",
    "following the methodology described in the previous section , we numerically studied the interfacial phenomenology that the system shows in presence of the sinusoidal substrate within the mean - field approximation .",
    "as interfacial hamiltonian theories point out that the phenomenology will depend on the type of wetting transition when the system is in contact with a flat substrate @xcite , we consider two situations : @xmath139 and @xmath140 , that correspond to first - order and critical wetting , respectively ( see appendix ) .",
    "theory predicts the ratio between the amplitude and roughness period @xmath87 is a key parameter , so in general we consider the cases @xmath141 and @xmath142 , although for some systems we have considered other values of @xmath87 . to assess the finite - size effects ,",
    "for each value of @xmath87 we consider different substrate periods in a range @xmath143 .      under this condition ,",
    "the relevant surface coupling parameter is @xmath130 , taken as the limit @xmath144 , @xmath145 and @xmath146 .",
    "furthermore , the surface coupling energy in ( [ redfree - energy3 ] ) , up to an irrelevant constant , has the expression @xmath147 . as shown in the appendix , the reduced surface coupling @xmath130 plays the role of the temperature @xmath148 , as @xmath149 , where @xmath150 is the bulk critical temperature .",
    "the first - order wetting transition for a flat substrate occurs for a surface field @xmath151 . on the other hand ,",
    "the prewetting critical point occurs at @xmath152 .",
    "therefore , we have explored the values of @xmath153 $ ] and @xmath154 $ ] .",
    "we start our study under bulk coexistence conditions , i.e. @xmath102 . in order to compare the minimization results for @xmath102 with the macroscopic theory",
    ", we obtained analytical expressions for the free - energy densities @xmath155 , where @xmath14 is the interfacial free energy and @xmath16 is the projected area of the substrate in the @xmath17 plane .",
    "substitution of the landau - ginzburg surface tensions ( [ sigmaw-3 ] ) , ( [ sigma+- ] ) and ( [ sigmaw+ ] ) into ( [ free - energy - dry ] ) , ( [ free - energy - filled ] ) and ( [ free - energy - wet ] ) leads to the following expressions for the three free - energy branches at @xmath102 : @xmath156 where @xmath157 and @xmath158 are the complete and incomplete elliptic integrals of the second kind , respectively , and @xmath159 .     at @xmath102 , as a function of the surface field @xmath130 , for a sinusoidal substrate with @xmath160 and @xmath142 , and @xmath161 ( crosses ) , @xmath162 ( open squares ) and @xmath163 ( filled circles ) .",

    "the @xmath10 and @xmath13 branches are quite insensitive to the substrate periodicity @xmath0 , and converge quickly to the macroscopic expressions ( [ fi ] ) and ( [ fiii ] ) . on the other hand , the @xmath11 branch is more sensitive to @xmath0 , specially for the largest values of @xmath130 , although also converges to the macroscopic expression ( [ fii ] ) for moderate values of @xmath0 . for small values of @xmath1 the free energy density of the @xmath11 branch",
    "exceeds the limiting value given by ( [ fii ] ) , and if @xmath1 is of order of the correlation length the @xmath11 branch becomes metastable in all the range of values of @xmath130 with respect to @xmath10 or @xmath13 states .",
    "in this situation , there is only a first - order wetting transition between a @xmath10 and a @xmath13 state located at the value of @xmath130 given by the wenzel law .",
    "but in general , filling and the wetting transitions are located as the intersection between the @xmath10 and @xmath11 branches , and the @xmath11 and @xmath13 branches , respectively . thus these transitions are both first - order . however , although the filling transition is clearly first - order in all the cases , the first - order character of the wetting transition weakens as @xmath0 is increased .",
    "figure [ fig6 ] shows the typical magnetization profiles at the filling and wetting transition .",
    "we can see that the coexisting magnetization profiles at the filling transition are in good agreement with the schematic picture shown in figure [ fig1 ] , and the mid - point interfacial height follows accurately the macroscopic prediction .",
    "on the other hand , at the wetting transition ( which for the macroscopic theory is continuous ) , we see that the mid - point interfacial height at the @xmath11 state ( c ) is slightly below the substrate maximum height @xmath166 .",
    "this fact may indicate that the wetting transition of the rough substrate for large @xmath0 is controlled by the wetting properties of the substrate at its top , with corrections associated to the substrate curvature there .",
    "if this hypothesis is correct , then the wetting transition should remain first - order for all @xmath0 and converge asymptotically to the wetting transition of the flat wall as @xmath167 .",
    "we will come back to this issue below .",
    "figure [ fig7 ] represents the adsorption phase diagram at bulk coexistence .",
    "the phase boundaries correspond either to filling transitions between @xmath10 and @xmath11 phases , or wetting transitions between either a @xmath11 or @xmath10 phase and a @xmath13 phase .",
    "we can see that the substrate roughness enhances the wettability of the substrate : as the substrate is rougher the wetting and filling transitions are shifted to lower values of @xmath130 , leading to an increase of the stability region of the @xmath13 phase at the expense of the @xmath11 phase , and a reduction of the stability region of the @xmath10 phase with respect to the @xmath11 phase .    for the shallowest considered substrate",
    "@xmath164 we see that for very small values of @xmath0 there is only a first - order wetting transition between a @xmath10 and a @xmath13 state at a value of @xmath130 almost independent of the value of @xmath0 given by wenzel law prediction .",
    "as @xmath0 increases the @xmath11 phase appears at a triple point for @xmath168 from which the filling and wetting transition ( between @xmath11 and @xmath13 states ) emerge .",
    "we have checked that , as the substrate becomes shallower , this triple point occurs for larger values of @xmath0 : @xmath169 for @xmath170 and @xmath171 for @xmath172 . in all the cases , the value of @xmath173 . on the contrary , for larger values of @xmath87 we do not observe this scenario in the range of values of @xmath0 studied , but we expect to observe it for smaller values of @xmath0 . in any case , for moderate and large values of @xmath1 , we see that the filling transition line is almost independent of the value of @xmath0 and it coincides with the macroscopic theory prediction . in particular , from ( [ thetafrough ] ) and as @xmath174 for small @xmath2 ,",
    "the filling transition value is approximately equal to @xmath175 for @xmath176 . on the other hand ,",
    "the wetting transition has a strong @xmath0-dependence , so the transition value of @xmath130 increases with @xmath0 .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that these wetting transition values are always smaller than the corresponding one to the flat substrate @xmath177 , in agreement with the predictions from interfacial hamiltonian theory @xcite .    in order to check",
    "the hypothesis mentioned above that the wetting transition for large @xmath0 is just a curvature - driven correction to the wetting transition of the flat substrate at the top of the substrate , we plot in figure [ fig8 ] the wetting transition shift with respect to the flat value @xmath178 as a function of @xmath179 , which is the square root of the curvature at the substrate top .",
    "our numerical data show a fairly good collapse in a master curve . for small @xmath180 , this master curve seems to show an asympotically linear dependence with @xmath180 .",
    "a simple argument may rationalize this result . recall that close to the wetting transition the @xmath11 state is characterized by an almost flat gas - liquid interface at a height slightly below the maximum substrate height @xmath166 .",
    "consequently , the free - energy difference between the @xmath11 and @xmath13 states @xmath181 comes from contribution of the region close to the substrate maximum . if @xmath180 is small , we may approximate the shape of the substrate by the parabolic approximation @xmath182 .",
    "we can assume that the interfacial height with respect to the substrate maximum is close to the corresponding for the flat substrate for the partial wetting phase at the wetting transition .",
    "so , there will be a contribution to @xmath183 which is proportional to the free - energy difference between the partial and complete wetting interfacial states at the wetting transition , which is proportional to @xmath184 close to the transition , and to the length of the segment in the @xmath185axis where there is no interface in the @xmath11 state , which is inversely proportional to @xmath180 .",
    "obviously this contribution is always negative if @xmath186 .",
    "thus , there must be another contribution to @xmath183 which takes into account the distorsions in the magnetization profile with respect to the flat situation driven by the substrate curvature .",
    "this contribution should be positive , and we can assume that it is nearly constant for small @xmath180 .",

    "finally , regarding the off - coexistence transitions , the filling transition line agrees with the macroscopic theory predictions if @xmath0 is large enough and very close to bulk coexistence , i.e. @xmath242 . under these conditions ,",
    "the midpoint interfacial height of the @xmath11 state is much larger than the bulk correlation length .",
    "again , the agreement with the macroscopic theory worsens for critical wetting substrates . for first - order wetting substrates",
    ", we observe a crossover to a prewetting - like behaviour for larger values of @xmath236 .",
    "this line is different from the proper prewetting line , which is associated to the wetting properties at the substrate top .",
    "although we have considered only two extreme situations ( @xmath139 for first - order wetting substrates and @xmath123 for critical wetting substrates ) we expect similar scenarios for small or large @xmath128 , respectively .",
    "the borderline between these scenarios is expected to occur around the tricritical wetting conditions for the flat substrate .",
    "this study is beyond the present work .",
    "our model overcomes many of the problems with previous approaches , such as the neglected role of intermolecular forces in the macroscopic theory , or the appropriate form of the binding potential for the effective interfacial models for rough substrates @xcite .",
    "however , the simplicity of our functional have additional disadvantanges . for example , it does not describe properly the packing effects close to the substrates due to the hard - core part of the intermolecular interactions , which is of order of the bulk correlation length away from the bulk critical point . as a consequence",
    ", the phenomenology for small @xmath0 may be affected by these effects , and even for larger values of @xmath0 some of the predicted transitions may be preempted by surface or bulk solidification . on the other hand ,",
    "our functional is appropriate for short - ranged intermolecular forces , although in nature dispersion forces are ubiquous . in order to take into account the packing effects or long - ranged interactions , more",
    "accurate functionals should be used .",
    "finally , in our study interfacial fluctuations are completely neglected due to its mean - field character .",
    "these may have an effect for the continuous transition .",
    "for short - ranged forces , @xmath251 is the upper critical dimension for critical wetting of a flat substrate .",
    "so , we anticipate that capillary wave fluctuations may alter the critical behaviour of the critical wetting on the flat substrate . furthermore , interfacial fluctuations may have more dramatic effects in transitions such as filling .",
    "in fact , although filling is effectively a two - dimensional transition ( as it is prewetting ) , the interfacial fluctuations are highly anisotropic , since the interfacial correlations along the grooves axis are much stronger than across different grooves .",
    "this may lead to a rounding of the filling transition due to its quasi - one dimensional character , as it happens for single grooves .",
    "further work is required to elucidate the effect of the interfacial fluctuations in the adsorption of rough substrates .",

    "in this section we review the landau - ginzburg theory , focusing on its application to interfacial transitions such as wetting transition . because of its simplicity",
    ", this model has been extensively studied in this context in the literature @xcite . for convenience",
    "we use the magnetic language , where the order parameter has the same symmetry as the magnetization per unit volume in the ising model .",
    "however , the results obtained for this system are completely valid for the interfacial phenomenology of simple fluids , identifying the order parameter with the deviation of the density with respect to its critical value . we will also restrict ourselves to the three - dimensional situation , although the formalism can be applied to other dimensionalities .",
    "the free energy functional of the system in contact with a substrate can be expressed in terms of the order parameter field @xmath119 as : @xmath252\\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\int_{\\cal s } d\\mathbf{s } \\frac{c}{2}(m(\\mathbf{s})-m_{s}(\\mathbf{s}))^2 \\label{free - energy}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the first term corresponds to landau - ginzburg functional on total volume @xmath253 while the second term takes into account the interaction with the substrate .",
    "thus , @xmath254 is a reference free energy , @xmath255 , @xmath256 and @xmath257 are positive constants , @xmath225 is the ordering field ( magnetic field magnetic systems , deviation of chemical potential with respect to the value at coexistence in fluid systems ) and @xmath258 characterizes the temperature deviation with respect to the critical value @xmath150 . regarding the interaction with the substrate ,",
    "the integration is restricted to the surface of the substrate @xmath259 .",
    "finally @xmath128 is the _ enhancement _ parameter and @xmath260 is the favoured order parameter value by the substrate , and that will be assumed to be positive , so it favors the phase with volume order parameter @xmath261 when @xmath262 and @xmath102 . for later purposes , it will be useful to define the applied surface field @xmath263 .",
    "for theoretical analysis and its computational implementation it is convenient to use a description in terms of reduced units . to do this",
    ", we must first determine the natural scales of each variables .",
    "the natural scale for the order parameter field is given by the equilibrium value of this magnitude @xmath264 for @xmath102 in the landau theory .",
    "although for @xmath265 @xmath266 , for temperatures below the critical and @xmath102 the states characterized by @xmath267 and @xmath268 are at coexistence .",
    "thus , as we are interested in situations where there is coexistence of phases ( which implies that @xmath262 ) , we define @xmath269 as : @xmath270 on the other hand , the natural length scale is given by the correlation length @xmath271 defined from the ornstein - zernike theory correlation applied to the landau - ginzburg functional : @xmath272 by analogy with the definition of the scale of the order parameter , define the length scale @xmath273 as @xmath274 therefore , if we define @xmath275 and @xmath276 then we can define a reduced free energy as : @xmath277\\nonumber\\\\&+&\\int_{\\tilde { \\cal s } } d\\tilde \\mathbf{s } \\frac{\\tilde c}{2}(\\tilde m-\\tilde m_{s})^2   \\label{redfree - energy}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath278 , @xmath279 , and positive or negative corresponds to @xmath265 or @xmath262 , respectively .",

    "consequently , the reduced surface field @xmath284 .",
    "since there is some freedom to choose the source of energy , choose @xmath285 .",
    "thus , we can rewrite ( [ redfree - energy ] ) as : @xmath286\\nonumber\\\\&+&\\int_{\\tilde { \\cal s } } d\\tilde\\mathbf{s } \\frac{\\tilde c}{2}(\\tilde m-\\tilde m_{s})^2 \\label{redfree - energy2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] hereafter we will only consider reduced units , so we will drop the tildes in the expressions above . in the mean field approximation ,",
    "the equilibrium profile parameter order is obtained by minimization of the functional ( [ redfree - energy2 ] ) @xcite . using the functional derivative of @xmath11 with respect to @xmath287",
    "( assuming @xmath288 is not on the substrate ) and making it equal to zero , we obtain the following euler - lagrange equation : @xmath289 on the other hand , the variation of the order parameter field in a surface point @xmath290 leads to the following boundary condition : @xmath291 where @xmath292 is the inward normal to the substrate in @xmath290 ( i.e. directed towards the system ) . finally , we impose that the order parameter far from the surface takes the equilibrium value given by the landau theory @xmath293 : @xmath294 if we restrict ourselves to the situation of coexistence ( @xmath102 and @xmath262 ) , the order parameter far from the substrate has the boundary condition @xmath295 .    in general , the differential equation ( [ el ] ) with boundary conditions ( [ cc1 ] ) and ( [ cc2 ] ) can not be solved analytically and we must resort to numerical methods .",
    "however , in the case of a flat substrate with @xmath128 and @xmath130 constants the problem can be solved analytically .",
    "consider that the substrate is on the plane @xmath296 .",
    "then , by symmetry , the order parameter field depends only of the coordinate @xmath297 . at bulk coexistence ( @xmath102 and @xmath262 ) , ( [ el ] ) reduces to : @xmath298 multiplying this equation by @xmath299 and integrating in the range @xmath300 $ ] , we obtain the following expression : @xmath301 where we have used the boundary condition ( [ cc2 ] ) ( @xmath302 and that @xmath303 when @xmath304 . the order parameter profile",

    "we can obtain from ( [ 1stintegral ] ) the derivative of order parameter to an arbitrary height @xmath297 as : @xmath306 this condition is valid for all @xmath307 .",

    "this implies that the only allowable value of @xmath321 is infinite . as at @xmath322 , @xmath323",
    ", this condition implies that a layer of infinite thickness of order parameter @xmath132 has nucleated between the substrate and the bulk phase .",
    "therefore , profiles with @xmath324 will correspond to _ partial wetting _ , while if @xmath325 we have _ complete _ wetting .",
    "figure [ fig21 ] shows some typical order parameter profiles .",
    "( dashed curve ) , @xmath326 ( curve of dots and dashes ) and @xmath327 .",
    "the latter case corresponds to complete wetting , so the width of the layer of @xmath132 phase becomes infinite . ]",
    "the equilibrium free energy @xmath328 can be obtained by replacing the order parameter profiles in the functional ( [ redfree - energy2 ] ) . however , their evaluation can be simplified taking into account ( [ 1stintegral ] ) .",
    "if we define the surface tension between the substrate and the bulk phase with order parameter @xmath121 , @xmath329 , as @xmath330 ( note that the bulk contribution is zero in our case ) , then we can evaluate it as : @xmath331 given that the order parameter profiles are monotonous , and using ( [ 1stintegral2 ] ) , we can express the surface tension as : @xmath332 therefore , the surface tension @xmath333 has the expression : @xmath334 where @xmath335 is the surface tension associated to the interface between the two bulk phases at coexistence : @xmath336 and @xmath337 is the surface tension between the substrate and a bulk phase with order parameter @xmath132 . under these conditions , ( [ 1stintegral2 ] ) changes to @xmath338 , and",
    "then @xmath339 note that the expression for @xmath340 and @xmath325 given by ( [ sigmaw-3 ] ) is predicted by young s law under conditions of complete wetting .",
    "the values of @xmath341 can be obtained by using the boundary condition ( [ cc1 ] ) .",
    "therefore , the derivatives of the order parameter profile at must satisfy simultaneously that : @xmath342 therefore , we get @xmath341 by using a graphical construction ( see figure [ fig22 ] ) .",
    "three different situations can be observed depending on the value of @xmath343 :    1 .",
    "* critical wetting transition ( @xmath344)*. under these conditions , there is only one intersection of ( [ graphical - solution ] ) at a value of @xmath341 given by the expression : @xmath345 therefore , the system goes continuously from a partial wetting situation for @xmath346 1 to a situation complete wet for @xmath347 , so the wetting transition is continuous and occurs at @xmath192 .",
    "* tricritical wetting transition ( @xmath348)*. this situation corresponds to the borderline between continuous and first - order wetting transitions .",

    "* first - order wetting transition ( @xmath349)*. under these conditions , there may be up to three intersections of ( [ graphical - solution ] ) , which will be denoted by @xmath350 , @xmath351 and @xmath352 : @xmath353 therefore , there may be up to three possible order parameter profiles . to identify the true equilibrium profile",
    ", we evaluate the surface free energy .",
    "it can be shown that the profile for the solution term @xmath354 always has a free energy higher than other states .",
    "as for @xmath130 small or negative the only possible solution corresponds to that with @xmath355 , and for large @xmath130 the only solution corresponds to the complete wetting profile where @xmath356 , there must be an intermediate value of @xmath130 , where both states coexist .",
    "thus , the wetting transition is given by the value of @xmath130 for which @xmath357 .",
    "this condition has a graphical interpretation : the wetting transition occurs for the value of @xmath130 for which the areas enclosed by curves given by ( [ graphical - solution ] ) between @xmath350 and @xmath354 , on one hand , and @xmath354 and @xmath352 , on the other hand , are equal ( maxwell construction ) .",
    "starting from the wetting transition , and out of coexistence ( i.e. @xmath131 ) , the prewetting transition emerges @xcite , where two distinct interfacial structures characterized by different but finite adsorbed phase film thicknesses ( see figure [ fig23 ] ) .",
    "this transition line starts tangentially to the bulk coexistence curve @xmath102 , as predicted by the clausius - clapeyron relationship @xcite , and finishes at the prewetting critical point .",
    "the location of this transition is obtained by a similar construction to the outlined above for the wetting transition : the two interfacial phases are determined by the surface magnetization , obtained by the intersection of the following curves : @xmath358 up to three solutions may be obtained .",
    "the true equilibrium profile corresponds to the solution with minimum surface free energy .",
    "coexistence is obtained when the areas enclosed by the curves given by ( [ graphical - solution2 ] ) are equal , and the prewetting critical point corresponds to the situation where the three solutions merge into the same value .     for : ( a ) @xmath344 , ( b ) @xmath349 .",
    "the dashed lines correspond to partial wetting situations , the dot - dashed lines to complete wetting situations , and the continuous lines to the wetting transition . ]    finally , we can obtain analytically the contact angle @xmath2 via young s law : @xmath359 where @xmath360 , @xmath337 and @xmath361 are given by the expressions ( [ sigmaw-3 ] ) ( [ sigmaw+ ] ) and ( [ sigma+- ] ) , respectively , @xmath362 is the value of the equilibrium order parameter at @xmath363 ( obtained through the construction explained above ) , and @xmath364 is the value of the equilibrium order parameter at @xmath363 which decays to @xmath365 when @xmath366 .",
    "this value can be obtained via a graphical construction similar to that already explained , where we look for solutions of the equation : @xmath367 for @xmath368 , this solution is given by : @xmath369    in order to finish this introduction to the landau - ginzburg model of wetting of flat substrates , it is common in the literature to study the wetting phenomena by using interfacial hamiltonians , where the surface free energy associated to an interfacial configuration ( i.e. by fixing the surface at which the magnetization is zero , for example ) , is given by : @xmath370 \\label{interfacialhamiltonian}\\ ] ] where @xmath371 is the interfacial height above the position @xmath372 of the substrate and @xmath373 is the interfacial binding potential .",
    "a considerable work has been reported in the literature to justify ( [ interfacialhamiltonian ] ) from first principles @xcite .",
    "more recently , a new derivation of ( [ interfacialhamiltonian ] ) has been proposed , where in general the binding potential is not a local function but a non - local functional of @xmath374 @xcite . for parallel and flat substrate and interface",

    "<S> we study the interfacial phenomenology of a fluid in contact with a microstructured substrate within the mean - field approximation . </S>",
    "<S> the sculpted substrate is a one - dimensional array of infinitely long grooves of sinusoidal section of periodicity length @xmath0 and amplitude @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the system is modelled using the landau - ginzburg functional , with fluid - substrate couplings which correspond to either first - order or critical wetting for a flat substrate . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the effect of the roughness of the substrate in the interfacial phenomenology , paying special attention to filling and wetting phenomena , and compare the results with the predictions of the macroscopic and interfacial hamiltonian theories . at bulk coexistence , for values of @xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> much larger than the bulk correlation , we observe first - order filling transitions between dry and partially filled interfacial states , which extend off - coexistence , ending at a critical point ; and wetting transitions between partially filled and completely wet interfacial states with the same order as for the flat substrate ( if first - order , wetting extends off - coexistence in a prewetting line ) . on the other hand , if the groove height is of order of the correlation length , only wetting transitions between dry and complete wet states are observed . </S>",
    "<S> however , their characteristics depend on the order of the wetting transition for the flat substrate . </S>",
    "<S> so , if it is first - order , the wetting transition temperature for the rough substrate is reduced with respect to the wetting transition temperature for a flat substrate , and coincides with the wenzel law prediction for very shallow substrates . on the contrary , if the flat substrate wetting transition is continuous , the roughness does not change the wetting temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the filling transition for shallow substrates disappears at a triple point for first - order wetting substrates , and at a critical point for critical wetting substrates . </S>",
    "<S> the macroscopic theory only describes accurately the filling transition close to bulk coexistence and large @xmath0 , while microscopic structure of the fluid is essential to understand wetting and filling away from bulk coexistence . </S>"
