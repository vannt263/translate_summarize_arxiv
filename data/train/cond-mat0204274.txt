    "a recent review on ratchet transport by reimann @xcite provides with a lot of theoretical and experimental results , and we refer the interested reader to this work .    for a set of related problems , such as directed particle current @xcite , directed energy current @xcite , average magnetization @xcite , and nonlinear hall effect @xcite , to name a few ,",
    "a recently published symmetry approach was shown to systematically account for all relevant symmetries which have to be broken in order to explain the observed rectification effect .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to generalize this approach , and to apply it to different physically relevant situations like underdamped , overdamped or zero temperature cases .",
    "we also use the nonlinear response arguments to make the results of symmetry considerations very transparent .",
    "we will argue for a rather minor role of additional fluctuations which are mainly responsible for the area of phase space explored .",

    "the addition of a spatial potential allows us to tune the system in such a way that ballistic channels disappear .",

    "conclusions and discussions are given in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "consider a certain system in contact with a heat bath .",
    "the system is characterized by some internal ( nonlinear ) dynamics , and we will discuss concrete models below .",
    "so far we just need to know that its state can be characterized by certain variables which are functions of time . these could be functions of phase space variables of a classical system , or expectation values of operators for a quantum system .",
    "consider one of such variables which we denote as @xmath0 .",
    "the coupling to the heat bath will be characterized by at least two parameters - the temperature of the bath ( we will use the notation of inverse temperature @xmath1 ) and some set of relaxation times , in the simplest case just one relaxation time ( we will use the notation of the inverse relaxation time @xmath2 ) .",
    "we also assume that the chosen variable @xmath0 is zero on average .",
    "let us now apply a static field @xmath3 which couples to @xmath4 such that a nonzero average @xmath5 is generated .",
    "its dependence on @xmath3 is assumed to be given by some single valued response function @xmath6 @xcite ( the physical meaning of the response function can be different , electric polarization or magnetization , for example ) .",
    "the above mentioned symmetries will be connected with corresponding symmetries of the function @xmath7 .",
    "this function will be in general nonlinear , yet in some cases it may be expanded in a taylor series around @xmath8 and start with a linear term ( this term describes then the linear response ) .",
    "there are two possibilities : the function @xmath7 is either antisymmetric @xmath9 or it is asymmetric @xmath10 .    before analyzing the case of adiabatically slow periodic ac fields , we will more rigorously introduce the notion of possible symmetries of an arbitrary periodic function with zero mean .      consider a periodic function @xmath11 having zero mean .",

    "may possess none of the above symemtries , precisely one of them or all three simultaneously .",
    "in particular @xmath14 functions may be expanded in a pure cosine fourier series , @xmath16 functions in a pure sine fourier series , and @xmath18 functions show up with zero even fourier components in their fourier series expansion . as a consequence the simplest function @xmath19 possesses all three symmetries",
    ". the function @xmath20 does not posses any of the listed symmetries except for @xmath21 ( @xmath14 ) and @xmath22 ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "a final example @xmath23 always possesses shift symmetry ( @xmath18 ) and in addition may be symmetric _ and _ antisymmetric for @xmath21 .",
    "let us finally note that most cases under consideration use several harmonics contained in the drive",
    ". however it may be also important to use pulse sequences .",
    "the symmetry considerations can be straightforwardly applied also to such cases .",
    "let us now assume that the field @xmath3 is slowly varying in time",
    ". slowly means that the characteristic time scales of changes of @xmath24 are much larger than all other time scales in the system .",
    "then we are dealing with the adiabatic limit of the response to time - dependent fields .",
    "we may use the response @xmath25 to a static field and simply insert the slow time dependence : @xmath26 $ ] . consider a time - periodic field @xmath27 with zero average @xmath28 .",
    "in general the corresponding value @xmath29 will be nonzero for asymmetric @xmath25 .",
    "however for antisymmetric single - valued @xmath25 the average @xmath30 will be zero provided the function @xmath24 is either antisymmetric @xmath31 or has shift symmetry @xmath32 .",
    "consider as an example @xmath33 for @xmath34 eq .",
    "( [ 1 - 1 ] ) has all three mentioned symmetries of periodic functions . for @xmath35",
    "the function has no symmetries except for @xmath36 ( @xmath37 integer ) where it is symmetric or for @xmath38 where the function is antisymmetric . for @xmath39 eq .",
    "( [ 1 - 1 ] ) has shift symmetry except for @xmath40 when it is in addition symmetric and antisymmetric ( around different time origins , of course ) .",
    "next we assume a case when the adiabatic response function @xmath25 may be expanded in a taylor series : @xmath41 where the skipping of higher order terms is justified by the smallness of @xmath3 . for @xmath42",
    "the response is asymmetric and consequently any field from ( [ 1 - 1 ] ) will in general lead to a nonzero average of @xmath25 . for @xmath43",
    "however all shift symmetric and antisymmetric @xmath24 will yield zero averaged @xmath25 ( because it leads also to a shift symmetry or antisymmetry of @xmath25 in time ) . as an example of mixing of harmonics the leading nonzero contribution for @xmath44",

    "note that the antisymmetry property of @xmath7 is linked to some internal symmetries of the dynamical system under consideration , as will be shown below .",
    "it is important to note that the written above is valid for single - valued response functions .",
    "if the coupling to a heat bath is too weak , response functions may contain hysteretic loops .",
    "such cases need separate discussion @xcite .",
    "we may even consider quasiperiodic driving here .",
    "suppose that we drive the system with a field @xmath47 where both components @xmath48 are time periodic , but with incommensurable periods .",
    "the resulting field @xmath24 would be then quasiperiodic .",
    "if considering low amplitude fields and expanding the response function to second or third order , the full dc average of @xmath0 will be given by a mere sum of the averages obtained in the presence of only one of the two periodic fields .",
    "consider e.g. @xmath49 and an asymmetric response .",
    "in lowest order in the field amplitudes we obtain @xmath50 in higher orders in the response interference effects appear , so that products of the field components enter the result .",
    "yet for the lowest order case ( @xmath51 ) only the sum appears .",
    "so we may assume that further changing the drive by adding more time periodic field components does not change the main result of a possibility of a nonzero average .",
    "if we consider an antisymmetric response function @xmath25 , we need to choose a more sophisticated quasiperiodic drive . take e.g. @xmath47 with @xmath52 . assuming again that the field amplitude is small",
    ", we obtain in lowest order @xmath53 again we find that the periodic components of the quasiperiodic drive contribute additively in lowest order .",
    "note that each contribution can be obtained by considering a reduced drive function consisting only of this part .",
    "the corresponding contribution is clearly related to the symmetry properties of this reduced drive .",
    "once a given problem is considered in the adiabatic limit like discussed above , the appearance of nonzero averages due to ac fields can be obtained , and further changing of parameters away from the adiabatic limit will change numbers , but not the fact of nonzero averages .",
    "ratchet transport in its general form falls into such a class of systems .",
    "indeed a particle moving in a periodic potential @xmath54 under the influence of an external colored noise and dissipation may be taken into the limit of zero temperature ( no noise ) , slow periodic driving and zero mass ( over damped case ) : @xmath55 the response of @xmath56 to a corresponding static field @xmath3 is well known and has been discussed in connection with josephson current - voltage characteristics ( for symmetric potentials ) . the response is clearly nonlinear , and antisymmetric if the potential is symmetric in space . in case of asymmetric ratchet potentials",
    "the response is nonlinear but asymmetric . in the latter case",
    "a simple @xmath57 signal with large enough amplitude will generate a nonzero averaged current . in case of symmetric potentials a drive which is neither antisymmetric nor shift",
    "symmetric is needed .",
    "nonadiabatic corrections are of interest and importance .",
    "e.g. upon constantly increasing the frequency of a drive , currents ( or other averages ) may change sign , or increase or decrease by orders of magnitude @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "especially interesting are cases when certain ( nonadiabatic ) parameter limits give rise to new symmetries .",
    "these symmetries may be traced back away from the corresponding limits and help understand lots of peculiar features which are observed in such driven systems .    if the adiabatic response simply vanishes , nonadiabatic response contributions will be not just mere corrections . in such cases the symmetry considerations of the underlying equations of motion presented below",
    "appear to be the most direct way to predict rectification effects .",
    "one example of such a case is given in @xcite where the problem of driven quantum spins in ac magnetic fields is considered .",
    "while the adiabatic limit provides with zero induced magnetization component in y - direction there , nonadiabatic response terms make this component nonzero , as expected from symmetry considerations .",
    "in order to make further progress in the understanding of rectification it is useful to define a model . here we will consider the case of a particle of the unit mass moving in a space - periodic potential @xmath54 under the influence of friction and external forces : @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 is zero on average .",
    "the mass @xmath61 is assumed to be equal to one if not stated otherwise .",
    "if @xmath60 is a gaussian white noise , the particle undertakes diffusion with zero net current , in accord with the fluctuation - dissipation theorem .",
    "if however @xmath60 contains correlations ( color ) , then it is known that a nonzero net ( dc ) current is possible . in order to understand this result ,",
    "it is appropriate to make the correlations in the noise as transparent as possible .",
    "the easiest way to do so is to choose @xmath62 where @xmath63 is a gaussian white noise and the time - periodic external field @xmath24 has zero mean .",
    "a probabilistic description of the system is then possible using a fokker - planck equation ( see appendix a ) .    in a next radical step",
    "we skip the @xmath63 term .",
    "the reason for that is that we will be left with a deterministic equation , whose symmetries may be studied .",
    "these symmetries involving operations in time @xmath64 are assumed to hold even in the presence of a gaussian white noise , since such a term does not contain temporal correlations .",
    "note that the general nonintegrability of the resulting equations may provide with irregular ( chaotic ) trajectories .",
    "thus we are left with an equation of the form @xmath65      in order to characterize the symmetries of eq .",
    "( [ eqm1 ] ) we remind that the phase space dimension is three .",
    "as we look for nonzero average currents which are characterized by the velocity @xmath66 , we have to check whether there exist symmetries which allow to generate out of a specific trajectory of ( [ eqm1 ] ) another one with reversed velocities .",
    "the transformations of interest have to involve a change of sign of @xmath66 leaving its absolute value unchanged .",
    "thus we look for transformations which leave eq.([eqm1 ] ) invariant and    * either change the sign of @xmath67 and simultaneously shift time @xmath68 * invert time @xmath69 and shift coordinate @xmath70 .",
    "the following symmetries can be identified @xcite : @xmath71 note that @xmath72 and @xmath73 require @xmath74 ( hamiltonian case ) and @xmath75 ( overdamped case ) respectively .",
    "another observation is that all symmetries require certain symmetry properties of the external drive @xmath24 , while the properties of the space - periodic force @xmath25 does not matter for @xmath72 .",
    "a proper choice of the drive may thus break all of the above listed symmetries with any coordinate dependence of the force @xmath76 .",
    "it is useful to provide an interpretation of the action of the above symmetry operations on trajectories of ( [ eqm1 ] ) .",
    "if the equation of motion is invariant under a symmetry , it implies that a given solution or trajectory , when transformed using the symmetry operation , yields again a solution or trajectory of the system . it may be the same trajectory or a different one .",
    "the symmetry @xmath77 for @xmath78 transforms an attractor into an attractor , repellers into repellers and basins of attraction into basins of attraction .",
    "thus if an attractor is mapped onto itself , the average velocity on that attractor is zero .",
    "if an attractor is mapped onto another attractor , we find complete symmetry between the two attractors and their basins of attraction , while the average velocities will be of opposite sign .",
    "the symmetry @xmath72 , which is valid for the hamiltonian case , simply relates two trajectories to each other , both having opposite average velocities .",
    "once we add white noise , we have to consider some way of weighting different trajectories . in that sense , if two different trajectories are related by a symmetry @xmath77 or @xmath72 and have identical statistical weight , their contributions to a total average current will annihilate .",
    "the symmetry @xmath73 is acting in the overdamped limit , yet it is reverting the sign of time .",
    "thus it maps an attractor on a repeller and the basin of attraction of an attractor into the basin of repulsion of a repeller .",
    "it follows that due to the low dimension @xmath79 of the phase space of this problem , the compactness of the phase space and the uniqueness of a trajectory running through a point in it , that all trajectories have zero average velocity when @xmath73 is valid .    in order to correctly incorporate the effects of noise , kinetic equations have to be considered",
    "this is done in appendix a.    if at least one of the symmetries ( [ sym1 ] ) is valid , we conclude that the averaged current is zero if an additional white gaussian noise term is added .",
    "this noise will simply lead to an exploration of the whole phase space and thus realize on finite times different trajectories of the deterministic system .",
    "once all of the above symmetries are broken , we may expect that in general the average current will be nonzero .",
    "the understanding of the mechanisms which will lead to this current can be best obtained in the absence of noise for the deterministic system .      as it was shown in @xcite the value of the average current",
    "is strongly enhanced for the underdamped case , when the dissipation rate tends to zero .",
    "thus we start our study of the mechanisms with the dissipationless case @xmath74 .",
    "this hamiltonian limit of eq .",
    "( [ 7 ] ) is generically characterized by nonintegrable dynamics with a mixed phase space containing both chaotic and regular areas @xcite .",
    "a stochastic layer appears around the separatrix of the integrable nondriven [ @xmath80 eq .",
    "( [ 7 ] ) .",
    "contributions to a nonzero current may come from trajectories inside the stochastic layer as well as from regular unbound motion . because the latter always exist for motion in both directions , strong effective cancellation of currents takes place @xcite , while the strongest remaining contribution again comes from the stochastic layer , which will be considered below .    in the following",
    "we choose the following functions and parameters : @xmath81 this choice ensures that the symmetries @xmath77 and @xmath72 are broken . in fig.[fig1 ] we show the poincare map of the main stochastic layer of our model .",
    "points with coordinates @xmath82 and @xmath83 are drawn after each period of the drive . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] the time dependence of the coordinate @xmath84 is shown .",
    "we observe a drift in accordance with the symmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "the average velocity is approximately @xmath85 .    in order to understand the dynamical mechanisms of a nonzero dc current in the stochastic layer ,",
    "we first note that the stochastic layer is bounded in phase space .",
    "the boundary contains of a fractal set of regular islands embedded in the stochastic layer . a trajectory from the stochastic layer may become trapped for quite long times in these boundaries and perform ballistic - like ( regular - like ) dynamics .",
    "the symmetry breaking of the equations of motion is reflected in a desymmetrization of these fractal boundary structures for the upper and lower boundaries .",
    "this in turn leads to a desymmetrization of distribution functions which characterize the probability to stick and stay in such a boundary region @xcite . in fig.[fig3](b )",
    "the probability distribution functions of the flight durations to the left and the right ( for technical details see @xcite ) are shown .",
    "these functions are characterized by algebaically decaying tails , and we clearly observe the above mentioned desymmetrization .    in the inset of fig.[fig3](b ) each point denotes the distance covered in a given flight during the time of ballistic - like motion .",
    "we observe a fine structure with three branches .",
    "two major ones correspond to the main ballistic channels with opposite velocities while and a minor third one corresponds to a channel with smaller negative velocity .",
    "when dissipation is present in the system ( i.e. @xmath78 ) , the phase space of the system separates into basins of attraction of different low - dimensional attractors .",
    "close to the hamiltonian limit these attractors are limit cycles : @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 .",
    "these limit cycles are locked to the external periodic drive @xmath24 , therefore their period @xmath89 is characterized by @xmath90 , @xmath91 .",
    "the average velocity on the limit is given by @xmath92 when further away from the hamiltonian limit chaotic attractors can appear via period - doubling bifurcations @xcite .",
    "a numerical test reveals that in the case of @xmath93 only two limit cycle attractors appear .",
    "their location in the poincare map is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] by two filled circles .",
    "the dependence of @xmath94 on both attractors is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] .",
    "note that the attractors are located inside regular islands of the corresponding nondissipative system .",
    "these islands are characterized with nonzero winding numbers , and the sticking of the chaotic trajectory of the nondissipative case provides with the above discussed ballistic channels there .",
    "so we observe that the ballistic channels of the hamiltonian system survive by transforming into limit cycle attractors of the weakly dissipative case .",
    "as the attractors are located inside the stochastic layer of the hamiltonian limit , their basins of attraction are expected to show up with a complex folding structure .",
    "this fact is manifested beautifully if we add a noise of weak intensity which corresponds to a small temperature @xmath95 : @xmath96 @xmath97 is small compared to the energy barrier of the periodic potential . as it turns out , in this case of strong external driving",
    "the system is so far from the equilibrium case , that different scales have to be used in order to compare with the noise intensity . in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] we show the corresponding poincare map over a total time of @xmath98 .",
    "we observe that the trajectory is sticking for long times to the two attractors .",
    "but most importantly we observe frequent escapes from the attractors basins .",
    "once the trajectory is kicked out of such a basin , it starts to quickly explore the stochastic layer space , due to the weak damping , weak noise , and the above mentioned complex folding of the basin boundaries .",
    "this results in the fact that the probability distribution of the velocities is far from being maxwellian .    the dependence of @xmath84 for the dissipative case with noise is shown in fig .",
    "although the dc current value has changed compared to the hamiltonian case , again the evolution is characterized by sticking to ballistic channels .",
    "an evaluation of the corresponding ballistic flight time distributions is shown in fig.[fig3](a ) . a remarkable similarity to the case of the distributions for the hamiltonian case is observed .",
    "also we observe that the power law tails of the hamiltonian case are replaced by exponential ones in the dissipative case with noise , due to an expected noise - induced cutoff in the maximum correlation time .",
    "a consequence of the above results is that the loss of ballistic channels due to the variation of some parameter may lead to a crossover - like decrease of the current . in the next section",
    "we will design a model which does possess these properties .",
    "so far we have discussed the case of a classical particle with parabolic dispersion , i.e. a kinetic energy quadratic in the momentum @xmath99 . what happens if we consider nonparabolic dispersion ?",
    "a prominent example would be a periodic dependence on @xmath99 as for @xmath100 , which reminds the consideration of a quantum particle evolution in one band approximations .",
    "let us first consider the case of a particle with a general dispersion relation in the presence of additional ac driving : @xmath101 if the function @xmath102 is chosen to be periodic , its period is defined as @xmath103 .",
    "let us first consider the symmetries of the equations of motion which change the sign of the velocity @xmath66 : @xmath104 the following symmetries can be identified : @xmath105 note that the last two operations ( [ s3],[s4 ] ) may apply only for periodic @xmath106 functions .",
    "furthermore these operations change the energy of the undriven system .",
    "if these operations connect different trajectories , they should not matter at finite temperatures since different energies contribute with different weights .",
    "choosing the free particle case @xmath107 we may arrive at the conclusion that both relevant symmetries ( [ s1],[s2 ] ) can be violated by a proper choice of @xmath24 . yet , as shown in @xcite , the expected dc current should be zero in such a case , in fact independent on the strength of some additionally applied dissipation and noise .",
    "the case of @xmath108 is more involved .",
    "on one side it is well known that the kinetic boltzmann equation solution provides with a nonzero dc current if both symmetries ( [ s1],[s2 ] ) are broken @xcite . on the other side this dc current tends to zero as the dissipationless hamiltonian case is approached .",
    "we will show in the following that the reason for that is an additional symmetry of the _ solutions _ of ( [ eqmcos ] ) due to the integrability of ( [ cosp ] ) .    indeed , integration of ( [ eqmcos ] ) yields @xmath109 where @xmath110 .",
    "the function @xmath111 has the property @xmath112 this symmetry operation relates points on a given trajectory to points on a _ set _ of other trajectories .",
    "such a symmetry can not be derived from the equations of motion .",
    "it rather is a result of the integrability and reflects the symmetry of the _ solutions _ , i.e. of the phase space flow ( in contrast symmetries of equations of motion relate two trajectories to each other ) .",
    "the symmetry ( [ symint ] ) is in place independent of the choice of the functions @xmath102 and @xmath24 and provides with the following consequences .",
    "if we consider a corresponding kinetic equation with finite dissipation , the loss of correlations implies an averaging over the initial phase @xmath113 of the field @xmath24 .",
    "this averaging persists in the dissipationless limit , while on the other side we recover the above considered hamiltonian properties .",
    "the averaging over @xmath113 leads to an enforcement of the symmetry ( [ symint ] ) , which in turn by changing the sign of @xmath99 changes the sign of @xmath66 .",
    "thus a vanishing dc current is expected in that limit , in accordance with numerical and analytical analysis of kinetic equations .",
    "this result can be also obtained from ( [ intp ] ) and ( [ eqmcos ] ) if an averaging with a distribution function , which is symmetric in @xmath114 and independent of @xmath115 and @xmath113 , is performed : @xmath116 to detect a dc current carried by the electrons in a single band one has to break the integrability of the semiclassical equations of motion .",
    "we consider this case in the next section .",
    "an alternative way is a much more careful treatment of the quantum mechanical problem ( see , for example @xcite ) which is however far beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "things change drastically if we add an external space - periodic potential to ( [ cosp ] ) .",
    "such a system is in general nonintegrable , and we may expect the additional symmetry ( [ symint ] ) to not be present . to be precise , we choose the following model here : @xmath117 the corresponding equations of motion read @xmath118 the free parameter @xmath119 can be used to reach the limit of ( [ eqm1 ] ) . indeed for @xmath120 @xmath121 . choosing a small value of @xmath122 will keep the momentum small .",
    "this allows for an expansion of the right hand side of ( [ dotx ] ) to first order .",
    "additional rescaling @xmath123 and @xmath124 transforms the problem exactly to eq .",
    "( [ eqm1 ] ) ( with @xmath74 ) . on the other side ,",
    "a choice of a finite value of @xmath99 may lead to trajectories which are not contained in eq .",
    "( [ eqm1 ] ) .",
    "in addition ( [ scaledh ] ) is periodic in @xmath99 , so the phase space is compact .",
    "let us discuss the relevant symmetries of eqs .",

    "the shift symmetry of the kinetic energy is broken ( in terms of electrons this implies loosing of the particle - hole symmetry ) .",
    "we can identify the following symmetry operations which lead to a change of sign of @xmath66 : @xmath126 in the following we choose @xmath24 from ( [ par1 ] ) which ensures that both symmetries are broken .",
    "for @xmath127 the phase space of ( [ scaledh ] ) is characterized by the presence of two disconnected stochastic layers .",
    "one of them corresponds to the layer in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .    in fig .",

    "[ fig1 ] when @xmath129 .",
    "an increasing of @xmath119 will lead to a merging of the layers , which is followed by losses ( closings ) of ballistic channels , that are located near the boundaries of the central stochastic layer .",
    "the poincare map for @xmath130 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] .",
    "let us discuss a trajectory with initial conditions @xmath131 and @xmath132 , which ensures that we always start in the stochastic layer which corresponds to fig.1 in the limit of small @xmath119 .",

    "specifically its values for the presented poincare maps are @xmath134 for @xmath128 and @xmath135 for @xmath130 .",
    "we observe indeed that the current variations correspond to a closing or opening of ballistic channels .",
    "the above results support the general expectation that in the hamiltonian limit a mixed phase space is needed , so that the current vanishes both in the case of an integrable system as well as in the case of a fully chaotic one .",
    "we presented a symmetry approach to the effect of rectification due to external ac fields applied to a low - dimensional dynamical system with optional contact to a heat bath .",
    "the nonlinear ( nonadiabatic ) response is used to explain the effect .",
    "we explained the mechanisms of such a rectification for different cases . in the case of a particle moving in a space - periodic potential",
    "the explanation is given in terms of desymmetrization of ballistic channels which correspond to motion in different directions .",
    "while this explanation starts from the case of a nondissipative hamiltonian limit , we showed that the ballistic channels are robust with respect to adding dissipation and fluctuations .",
    "the mechanism of the directed current in the presence of dissipation is hidden in the desymmetrization of the basins of attraction of previously symmetry - related limit cycles with oppositely directed velocities .    a recent geometric approach by h. schanz et al in @xcite provides with an elegant way to account for the average drift velocity in the hamiltonian case .",
    "the basic ingredient of this approach is the assumption of an invariant density distribution in a stochastic layer being constant inside the layer .",
    "the resulting sum rule , when evaluated for concrete cases , provides with average velocities which quantitatively agree with our observations .",
    "a consequence of the sum rule is that a nonzero directed current may appear only in systems with a mixed phase space .",
    "this result correlates with our discussion of the mechanisms of directed currents in terms of ballistic channels , which may appear only provided the stochastic layer has some bounds with regular phase space regions , and the ballistic channels occur precisely in the neighborhood of these bounds .",
    "open questions are : i ) is there purely diffusive ( chaotic ) directed motion besides of transport through ballistic channels ?",
    "( ii ) when can one of these two mechanisms prevail ?",
    "it was shown that the symmetry properties of the fokker - planck equation match the symmetries of the corresponding deterministic equations of motion in the absence of noise .",
    "similar results hold for a boltzmann equation @xcite .",
    "our symmetry considerations may be as well used to explain rectifications in such diverse situations as i ) the directed motion of particles in non - newtonian liquids @xcite , ii ) the appearance of ring currents for particles moving in a two - dimensional space - periodic potential @xcite , iii ) the appearance of directed heat flux currents in systems of interacting particles @xcite , iv ) the appearance of a nonzero dc polarization , v ) quantum ratchets @xcite , to name a few .",
    "symmetry analysis is also instructive in the case of less conventional models , like systems with built - in asymmetry @xcite , where the asymmetry is hidden in a many body system s internal interactions .",

    "the average current is given by @xmath143 it follows that ( [ fp ] ) is invariant under the following transformations : @xmath144 at the same time ( [ tok1 ] ) is changing sign . since the solution @xmath141 is unique , the conclusion is that @xmath145 .    the overdamped limit @xmath75 is described by the following fokker - planck equation @xcite @xmath146w + \\frac{1}{\\beta } \\frac{\\partial ^2 w}{\\partial x^2}\\;. \\label{fpod}\\ ] ] the average current is given by @xmath147 the symmetry @xmath77 is again holding",
    ". however the symmetry @xmath148 does not follow from ( [ fpod ] ) in a similar way .",
    "it is interesting to note that reimann @xcite considered the symmetries of the original stochastic differential equation ( [ 7]),([7 - 2 ] ) and argued for a holding of @xmath73 for nonzero noise intensities .",
    "fistul @xcite showed that @xmath73 connects the original fokker - planck equation ( [ fpod ] ) with its conjugated counterpart .    here",
    "we will use a related approach and prove the vanishing of ( [ tok2 ] ) when @xmath73 holds .",
    "first we remind that the distribution @xmath141 is periodic in @xmath115 and @xmath64 .",
    "next we note that the operators @xmath149 and @xmath150 are anti - hermitian on the space of @xmath151-periodic functions .",
    "let us define the operator @xmath89 as @xmath152 then ( [ fpod ] ) can be rewritten as a lippmann - schwinger type integral equation : @xmath153 provided the conditions for @xmath73 hold , i.e. @xmath154 , the operator @xmath89 has the property @xmath155 expanding ( [ ls ] ) in a formal series in @xmath156 we obtain @xmath157 with ( [ tok2 ] ) we obtain for the average current @xmath158 since all terms in ( [ series ] ) are real valued , we conclude that all integrals with even @xmath37 vanish because of @xmath159 and these terms contain odd powers of @xmath25 .",
    "all integrals with odd @xmath37 vanish because of ( [ propertyt ] ) , since they contain odd powers of @xmath89 .",
    "thus we find that indeed the average current exactly vanishes when @xmath73 holds .",
    "we also performed a numerical solution of ( [ fpod ] ) for @xmath160 and @xmath161 , @xmath162 with @xmath163 .",
    "the function @xmath139 was expanded in a fourier series in @xmath115 and twenty fourier harmonics have been taken into account .",
    "the resulting coupled ordinary differential equations were simply integrated until the system reached the final attractor @xmath141 .    for the above choice of functions @xmath156 and @xmath24 the symmetry @xmath77",
    "is violated because @xmath24 is not shift - symmetric . at the same time",
    "the symmetry @xmath73 is violated for all values of @xmath164 except for @xmath165 . in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] the dependence of the average current @xmath166 ( [ tok2 ] ) on @xmath164 is shown .",
    "we observe that for @xmath167 the symmetry @xmath73 is restored and the current is vanishing ( the absolute numerical value is less than @xmath168 ) .",
    "underdamped systems often display hysteretic dependence on external fields , which leads to multi - valued response functions . in that case the overall symmetry of a response function is not sufficient to conclude about the current rectification .",
