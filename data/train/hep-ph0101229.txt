    "it could happen that no new particles will be discovered the the tevatron , the lhc and @xmath0 linear colliders @xcite except the sm - like higgs boson . in this case",
    "the main task for new colliders will be to search for signals of new physics via deviations of observed quantities from standard - model predictions .",
    "the study of higgs boson production at a photon collider @xcite offers excellent opportunities for this @xcite .",
    "indeed , in the sm and in its extensions , all fundamental charged particles contribute to the @xmath4 and @xmath5 effective couplings .",
    "besides , these couplings are absent in the sm at tree level , appearing only at the loop level .",
    "therefore , the background for signals of new physics will be relatively lower here than in processes which are allowed at tree level of the sm .",
    "in this analysis @xcite we assume that an sm - like scenario is realized , i.e. , the higgs particle has been found at the tevatron or the lhc and its partial widths or coupling constants squared are precisely measured ( mainly at the @xmath0 linear collider ) , being close to those of the sm within the anticipated experimental accuracies .",
    "this can happen not only in the sm , but also if nature is described by some other theory , for example , the two higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) or the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) . in the latter cases",
    "the observed higgs boson could be either one of the two neutral scalars .",
    "here we compare the sm and the sm - like scenario in the 2hdm  ( ii ) .",
    "the _ sm - like scenario _ can be defined by the following criteria :    * one higgs boson will be discovered with mass above today s limit for an sm higgs boson @xcite , @xmath6  gev .",
    "this can be either the higgs boson of the sm or one higgs boson from the two neutral cp - even scalars @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) of the 2hdm or the mssm . *",
    "the measured decay widths of this higgs boson ( or coupling constants squared ) to quarks , charged leptons , ew gauge bosons and gluons , @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) , will be in agreement with their sm values @xmath12 within the experimental precision @xmath13 * no other higgs boson will be discovered .",
    "any other higgs boson is weakly coupled with the @xmath14 boson , gluons and quarks , or sufficiently heavy : @xmath15 to escape observation @xcite . * any other new particle that may exist is beyond the discovery limits of lhc and the @xmath0 linear collider .",
    "let @xmath16 be the relative experimental uncertainty in the partial width , @xmath10 ( or coupling constants squared ) @xmath17    at the tesla @xmath0 collider the discussed production cross sections are expected to be measured with a significantly higher precision than at the lhc @xcite . at @xmath18 gev and with integrated luminosity 5001000  fb@xmath19",
    "one can expect @xcite : @xmath20 experiments at photon colliders open new perspectives .",
    "in particular , even with a modest integrated luminosity of a @xmath1 collider in the high energy peak of about @xmath21  fb@xmath19 , a @xmath1 collider makes it possible to improve on the accuracy in measuring the @xmath22 width up to @xcite : @xmath23 the accuracy in the measurement of the effective @xmath5 ( @xmath24 ) coupling in the process @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) is evidently not so high .",
    "we will use the above uncertainties to constrain ratios of actual ( in principle measurable ) coupling constants of each neutral higgs scalar @xmath27 ( @xmath7 or @xmath8 ) for @xmath7 and @xmath8 . ] with particle @xmath28 to the corresponding value for the higgs boson in the sm , @xmath29    in the sm - like scenario , for the observed higgs boson @xmath27 all @xmath30 are close to 1 , @xmath31 the allowed ranges for @xmath32 are constrained by the experimental accuracies @xmath16 , @xmath33 but there are also additional constraints to these @xmath32 which follow from the structure of the considered model .",
    "we here consider the cp - conserving two - higgs - doublet model in its model ii implementation , denoted by 2hdm  ( ii ) @xcite . here , one doublet of fundamental scalar fields couples to @xmath34-type quarks , the other to @xmath35-type quarks and charged leptons .",
    "the higgs sector contains three neutral higgs particles , two cp - even scalars @xmath7 and @xmath8 , and one cp - odd ( pseudoscalar ) @xmath36 , and charged higgs bosons @xmath37 , it coincides in the 2hdm  ( ii ) and in the mssm .    in the sm - like scenario realized in the 2hdm",
    "we need to consider both possibilities : not only the light scalar higgs boson , @xmath7 , but also the heavier one , @xmath8 , could imitate the sm higgs boson if the lighter scalar @xmath7 escapes detection @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "the ratios of the direct coupling constants of the higgs boson @xmath38 to the gauge bosons @xmath39 or @xmath14 bosons , to up and down quarks and to charged leptons , relative to their sm values can be expressed via angles @xmath40 and @xmath41 @xcite : @xmath42 with similar expressions for @xmath43 . here",
    "@xmath41 parameterizes the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two basic higgs doublets and @xmath40 parameterizes mixing among the two neutral cp - even higgs fields .",
    "the angle @xmath41 is chosen in the range @xmath44 and the angle @xmath40 in the range @xmath45 .",
    "the coupling of the charged higgs boson to the neutral scalars @xmath27 depends on the higgs - boson masses and on the additional parameter @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "the quantities @xmath47 for the couplings of each scalar ( [ 2hdmcoup - h ] ) ( referred to below as basic couplings ) are closely related to the observables and in the forthcoming analysis it is more natural to use them , instead of @xmath40 and @xmath41 . since for each",
    "@xmath27 these three @xmath48 can be expressed in terms of _ two _ angles , they fulfill a simple relation _ ( pattern relation ) _ , which plays a basic role in our analysis .",
    "it has the same form for both @xmath7 and @xmath8 , namely @xmath49 , or @xmath50 furthermore , from eq .",
    "( [ 2hdmcoup - h ] ) follows an expression for @xmath51 : @xmath52    in the following discussion we will assume only one value for each up - type quark , down - type quark , charged lepton and gauge boson coupling with the higgs boson , in numerical calculation we will use the best estimate for each category , e.g. @xmath53 for @xmath54 , etc .",
    "the sm - like scenario means , in particular , that @xmath55 ( here , we consider only basic couplings with @xmath56 ; loop couplings are discussed in the next section ) .",
    "we consider solutions of the equations ( [ estacc ] ) constrained by the pattern relation ( [ 2hdmrel ] ) . taking into account the definitions ( [ 2hdmcoup - h ] ) and earlier",
    "noted regions of variation of the mixing angles @xmath40 and @xmath41 , we check if the obtained solution can be classified as sm - like with respect to the first criterion of sec .  2 .",
    "for the observed higgs boson @xmath27 we consider solutions denoted @xmath57 and @xmath58 with approximately identical @xmath59 .",
    "subscript 1 corresponds to solutions with @xmath60 while subscript 2 labels solutions with @xmath61 .",
    "these solutions are really close to the sm for all basic couplings : relative phases coincide , and magnitudes are practically the same .",
    "there are also solutions where some of the @xmath62 but other @xmath63 .",
    "these are denoted @xmath64 and @xmath65 , where the subscripts have the same meaning as above .",
    "these solutions are in fact distinct from the sm case , even though all basic widths @xmath66 are close to the sm values ; we will not discuss them here , for details see @xcite .    for the solutions @xmath67 where the observed sm - like higgs boson is the heavier one , the values for the basic couplings can describe a picture which is different from the sm - like scenario since the lighter higgs boson can in principle be observable .",
    "we discuss these possibilities in each case and exclude some solutions from the subsequent discussion , if they do not fulfill the criteria of sec .  2 ( no other higgs particle should be discovered ) .    for the solutions a near the sm point for all basic coupling constants",
    ": @xmath68 , i.e. , @xmath69 we obtain , using the pattern relation and neglecting terms of higher order in @xmath32 , @xmath70    according to eqs .",
    "( [ estacc ] ) and ( [ 2hdmcoup - h ] ) , @xmath71 , so that in all these solutions the signs of @xmath72 and @xmath73 are opposite . since @xmath74 here is given by the product of two other @xmath75 s , it should be extremely small , ( @xmath76 using @xmath77 and @xmath53 from eq .",
    "( [ couplacc ] ) , while for @xmath78 we expect @xmath79=0.01 ) .",
    "this deviation can therefore be neglected , and in the calculations of loop - induced couplings one can put @xmath80 .",
    "in order to distinguish models in the considered sm - like scenario , we compute loop - induced couplings of the higgs boson with photons or gluons @xcite for solutions @xmath81 and @xmath82 within the ranges of the coupling constants allowed by the anticipated experimental inaccuracies from eq .",
    "( [ couplacc ] ) and within the constraints of the pattern relation , eqs .",
    "( [ ah ] ) and ( [ sol2s ] ) . to estimate the deviation from the sm",
    ", we consider the ratios of widths @xmath83 and @xmath84 obtained in the 2hdm  ( ii ) and in the sm . in the 2hdm",
    "the couplings with photons , @xmath85 and @xmath5 , contain contributions from fermions , and from the charged gauge boson @xmath86 , like in the sm .",
    "in addition , there are contributions from the charged higgs boson , @xmath87 .    for definiteness",
    ", we perform all calculations here for @xmath88  gev . at @xmath89",
    "gev the contribution of the charged higgs boson loop varies by less than 5% when @xmath90 varies from 800  gev to infinity .",
    "the @xmath1 and @xmath91 widths look the most promising ones for distinguishing models .",
    "a new feature of these widths , as compared to the sm case , is the contribution due to the charged higgs boson loops .",
    "it is known that the scalar loop contribution to the photonic widths is less than that of fermion and @xmath92 boson loops ( the last is the largest ) .",
    "the contributions of @xmath92 and @xmath93-quark loops are of opposite sign , i.e. , they partially compensate each other , thus , the effect of scalar loops is enhanced here .",
    "the coupling @xmath94 depends on @xmath46 , which is not fixed by the observable masses .",
    "this dependence is linear in the considered partial widths @xmath95 with @xmath96 proportinal to @xmath46 .",
    "for @xmath97 the ratios of the considered higgs widths to their sm values are shown in fig .  1 . here",
    ", thick curves correspond to strict sm values for the basic couplings with quarks and gauge bosons",
    ". these curves are below unity due to the contribution of the charged higgs boson .",
    "the shaded regions are derived from the anticipated 1  @xmath98 bounds around the sm values of _ two _ measured basic coupling constants , @xmath99 and @xmath100 ( the third basic coupling @xmath101 must be very close to its sm value ) . solutions a cover the shaded area in fig .  1 .",
    "with increasing higgs boson mass , the deviation of the considered loop couplings from their sm values decreases monotonically .",
    "[ fig : sol - a ]    we see that the deviation from unity is large enough to allow a reliable distinction of the 2hdm from the sm in the process @xmath102 .",
    "this conclusion is valid in a wide range of @xmath46 values .",
    "the possible precision in the determination of @xmath46 from the two - photon width depends crucially on the mass of the charged higgs boson .",
    "the two - gluon width is determined by the contributions of @xmath93 and @xmath103 quarks . for not too high values of @xmath104 , the @xmath93-quark contribution dominates .",
    "so , the difference @xmath105 is determined by the difference @xmath106 , and with high accuracy @xmath107 . if @xmath108 then the deviation of the higgs boson coupling with @xmath93-quark from its sm value can be large compared to expected experimental uncertainty ( [ couplacc ] ) . in this case",
    "the two - gluon width can differ from its sm value by more than the experimental uncertainty , and the measurement of the two - gluon width could exclude the sm - like scenario from being realized by the 2hdm .",
    "in such a case the photon collider can be used for a more detailed study of the realized model beyond the sm .",
    "an sm - like scenario observed at the lhc and @xmath0 linear colliders can occur both in the sm and in other models , including the 2hdm  ( ii ) . in order to distinguish these models ,",
    "we implement a pattern relation among basic couplings . taking into account",
    "anticipated uncertainties in future measurements of the basic couplings of the higgs boson , we found that the pattern relation in the considered sm - like scenario , in which partial widths of higgs boson decay are close to their sm values , has two types of solutions . in the solutions",
    "@xmath36 all basic couplings are close to their sm values .",
    "( in the solutions @xmath109 , some of the basic couplings are close to their sm values while others differ in sign from the sm values . )",
    "we studied the @xmath1 and @xmath91 partial widths of the observed higgs boson for all considered solutions .",
    "the obtained predictions are practically identical for the cases when the observed scalar is the lighter higgs boson of 2hdm ( @xmath7 ) or the heavier one ( @xmath8 ) . for solutions",
    "@xmath36 this difference depends on an additional parameter of the theory , @xmath46 .",
    "these solutions can be discriminated in a considerable range of values of this parameter .",
    "the @xmath1 width in the 2hdm  ( ii ) differs significantly from the corresponding sm width in a wide range of parameters .",
    "therefore , with the anticipated high accuracy of measuring this width at a photon collider , such a measurement could in general resolve the 2hdm  ( ii ) and the sm .",
