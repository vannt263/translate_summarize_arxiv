    "the circular shape of a paraxial linearly polarized gaussian beam undergoes , upon high numerical aperture focusing , an elongation of its focal spot along the polarization axis of the input beam @xcite . upon tight focusing radially and azimuthally polarized beams produce not only highly confined but also symmetric electric and magnetic field distributions in the focal plane and a strong longitudinal electric field component on the optical axis for radial polarization @xcite .",
    "a radially polarized mode can be decomposed into two orthogonally polarized hermite - gaussian ( hg ) modes : an @xmath0-polarized hg@xmath1 and a @xmath2-polarized hg@xmath3 mode .",
    "in contrast , an azimuthally polarized mode is a superposition of a @xmath2-polarized hg@xmath1 and an @xmath0-polarized hg@xmath3 mode .",
    "similar to linearly polarized gaussian beams , the tight focusing of these linearly polarized constituents also results in a symmetry break of the focal spot . due to the rich structures of the focal spot achieved by various engineering techniques a precise measurement of such complicated vectorial fields is rather challenging .",
    "nevertheless it is crucial to experimentally analyze and profile tightly focused vectorial beams in a real - world setup before utilizing them for experiments in nano - optics ( see @xcite and others ) .    in literature",
    "many methods for beam characterization are described such as the knife - edge @xcite , point scan method @xcite or slit method @xcite . in the knife - edge method ,",
    "a beam - block realized by a sharp edge made from an opaque material ( such as a knife- or razor - blade ) is line - scanned through the beam perpendicular to its optical axis while the transmitted power is monitored by a detector for several scanning directions . from the resulting photocurrent curves ( power vs. position of the edge relative to the beam ) the so - called beam - projections onto the scanning - line and",
    "finally the beam shape can be tomographically reconstructed @xcite .    in a more recent study , knife - edges made from pure materials ( metals , etc . )",
    "were systematically studied and polarization dependent effects in the knife - edge profiling method were observed .",
    "those effects result in a shift and a deformation of the measured projections and depend on the polarization and wavelength of the input beam and the materials of the knife - edge samples .",
    "caused by the aforementioned distortions introduced by knife - edges made from pure materials , a proper reconstruction of the beam under study seems to be impossible using a standard evaluation method @xcite .",
    "recently , we have demonstrated , that the interaction between the knife - edge and a highly focused linearly polarized beam can be understood in terms of the moments of the beam ( beam profile times a polynomial ) and , therefore , an adapted beam reconstruction and fitting technique can be successfully applied in this case @xcite .",
    "the aim of the study discussed below is to apply the knowledge already obtained for linearly polarized beams @xcite and to develop an adapted knife - edge reconstruction technique for highly focused radially and azimuthally polarized beams and their linearly polarized constituents .",
    "the principle of the knife - edge method is depicted in fig . [",
    "fig : exp_setup ] . for experimental reasons",
    "we consider here beam profiling by two adjacent edges of a single rectangular metal knife - pad .",
    "the photocurrent generated inside the photodiode is proportional to the power @xmath4 detected by the photodiode and is recorded for each beam position @xmath5 with respect to the knife - edge @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a proportionality coefficient and @xmath8 is the electric field intensity . in the conventional knife - edge method the derivative @xmath9 of the photocurrent curve with respect to the beam position @xmath5 reconstructs a projection of the intensity onto the @xmath10-plane at @xmath11 ( projection onto the @xmath0-axis ) @xcite . in a next step ,",
    "the two dimensional electric field intensity distribution can be reconstructed from projections measured along different directions using the radon back - transform , if polarization dependent effects can be neglected @xcite .    in this context",
    "it has to be mentioned that the term intensity usually refers to the total electric energy density and at the same time to the @xmath12-component of the poynting - vector @xmath13 , because they are proportional to each other due to longitudinal electric field components being negligible in the limit of paraxial light beams . in the case of tightly focused light beams ( non - paraxial propagation )",
    ", electric fields can exhibit strong longitudinal electric field components resulting in different distributions of @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "it was shown that the integral equation ( [ eq : knife ] ) adopted from the conventional knife - edge method allows for the reconstruction of the beam profile in terms of its total electric energy density distribution @xmath14 also in case of tightly focused vectorial beams if special edge - materials , thicknesses and certain wavelengths are chosen @xcite . nevertheless",
    ", with pure knife - edge materials of different thicknesses and for different wavelengths of the input beam , the retrieved projections do not correspond to the expected projections of the electric energy density distributions as they appear strongly distorted @xcite .    to better understand those shifts and distortions in the measured projections we exemplarily use a fundamental gaussian beam , which has its electric field oriented at @xmath16 degrees to the knife - edge . with a polarizer in front of the focusing objective oriented either perpendicular or parallel to the knife - edge",

    "a photocurrent curve is recorded for each orientation of the polarizer and the sum of those two photocurrent curves should result in the signal recorded without the polarizer ( total signal ) , see fig .",
    "[ fig : exp_setup](c ) . taking the derivative @xmath9 of the photocurrent curves with respect to the beam position @xmath5 should reconstruct the expected gaussian beam profile , however this is not the case ( see , fig .",

    "the projections of the gaussian beam with its electric field oriented at @xmath16 degrees to the knife - edge is strongly distorted .",
    "they exhibit in a exaggerated picture two lobes with a minima between the lobes . however , when a polarizer is used the situation looks different : each linear constituent preserves in principle its gaussian shape and only smaller distortions can be found .",
    "it becomes evident , that @xmath17- and @xmath18-projections are shifted ( @xmath19 with @xmath20 the width of the metal pad ( see fig . [",
    "fig : exp_setup](a ) ) ) and asymmetrically deformed also causing deviations in the retrieved beam diameters @xmath21 and @xmath22 ( see fig . [ fig : exp_setup](d ) ) .",
    "the above - mentioned effects are caused by the fact that the knife - edge is not only blocking the beam while line - scanning but it is also excited by the beam plasmonically .",
    "furthermore , the power flow through the knife - edge is polarization dependent and proportional to the value of the projection of the electric energy density onto the edge @xcite . obviously , if one does not account for these effects , the standard scheme is not valid without corrections unless the knife - edge parameters are carefully chosen @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting here that during the reconstruction of light beams with diameters larger than several wavelengths such effects are negligible as the distortions are much smaller than the projection of the beam .",
    "we would like to particularly discuss now a similar problem , which is observed while beam - profiling tightly focused azimuthally or radially polarized beams , see fig .",

    "nm we observe negative values of the projected on - axis intensities . the same is observed for all wavelengths for the reconstructed projections of a hg@xmath1 mode in the case of azimuthal polarization . in all cases our experimental observations are inline with our expectations from previous sections .",

    "( [ eq : sumu ] ) for the components of the @xmath17- and @xmath18-polarized beams in the plane of the projection .",
    "in addition the real position of the knife - edge was predetermined before fitting to reduce the number of free parameters in the fitting - routine and to fix the coordinate frame .",
    "for that purpose , we experimentally measure the distances @xmath88 between both edges using a scanning electron microscope ( sem ) , find the center @xmath89 between the peak values of both projections in one scan and finally set the actual positions of both knife - edges to be at @xmath90 .",
    "an example of such a fitting procedure is presented in fig .",

    "it turns out that for all investigated wavelengths between @xmath72 nm and @xmath73 nm by simultaneously ensuring @xmath91 the fitting algorithm has successfully converged towards realistic beam projections , resulting in a good overlap between the theoretical expectations from vectorial diffraction theory and reconstructed beam profiles .",
    "in conclusion , we have analyzed the performance of the knife - edge method for highly focused radially and azimuthally polarized beams and their linearly polarized constituents . for the correction of the observed modifications in these knife - edge measurements we presented a straight - forward and easy to implement method that is based on the adapted knife - edge reconstruction scheme .",
    "this way we are able to retrieve the beam projections of radially and azimuthally polarized laser beams with respect to their linear constituents , for which shifts and deformations of the reconstructed projections as observed in conventional knife - edge measurements can be corrected for .",
    "we thank stefan malzer , isabel gner , olga rusina and irina harder for their valuable support in preparing the samples ."
