    "the joint state of two qubits is describable ( @xmath5 ) by a @xmath0 density matrix @xmath1 , that is a hermitian matrix ( its transpose equalling its complex conjugate ) having its four nonnegative diagonal entries ( probabilities)as well as its four nonnegative eigenvalues  summing to one @xcite .",
    "the entirety of such @xmath0 density matrices with their entries restricted to real values  which will be our principal subject of analysis here  forms a nine - dimensional convex set . we note that @xmath6 density matrices with real entries have been termed `` rebits '' @xcite .    endowing the nine - dimensional set of pairs of rebits with hilbert - schmidt ( hs ) ( euclidean / flat ) measure @xcite @xcite , we arrive at the following trio of computational results @xcite .",
    "the three are : ( 1 ) the average value or mean ( first moment ) of the ( necessarily nonnegative ) determinant of @xmath1 , denoted @xmath2 ( @xmath7 ) , is @xmath8 ; ( 2 ) the mean of the determinant @xmath3 of the partial transpose ( pt ) of @xmath1negative values of which , by the celebrated results of peres @xcite and the horodecki family @xcite , are fully equivalent ( for qubit - qubit systems  as well as qubit-_qutrit _ systems , representable by @xmath9 density matrices ) to the entanglement / nonseparability of @xmath1is @xmath10 ; and ( 3 ) the mean of the product of these two determinants , that is @xmath11 ( @xmath12 by the cauchy - binet [ gram s ] theorem ) , is zero . ( the partial transpose  identifiable with the antiunitary operation of time - reversal @xcite ( cf .",
    "@xcite)of a @xmath0 matrix can be obtained simply by transposing in place its four @xmath6 blocks . )",
    "so , by assigning to each generic real @xmath0 density matrix @xmath1 , a value equal to this product of determinants , we find that the total ( but yet undetermined , necessarily negative ) value allotted to the entangled states exactly cancels the ( necessarily nonnegative ) value allotted to the disentangled / separable states .",
    "this result appears to be special to the hs measure , as the analogous trio of results using the well - known bures ( minimal monotone ) measure @xcite @xcite is @xmath13 and , numerically , -0.0030959720 and @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "it is a natural hypothesis ",
    "but one apparently presenting substantial computational challenges to test  that this zero - mean ( hs ) result extends to the standard 15-dimensional convex set of @xmath0 density matrices with arbitrary _ complex _ off - diagonal entries @xcite .",

    "thirdly , for the eight - dimensional set of @xmath23 density matrices with real entries consisting of those minimally degenerate matrices having one eigenvalue zero  which constitute the boundary of the basic nine - dimensional set @xcite  the mean of the product of the three nonzero eigenvalues is @xmath24 , the mean of @xmath3 is @xmath25 , while the mean of the product of @xmath3 and the three nonzero eigenvalues is also nonzero , that is , @xmath26 .",
    "( of course , in this last minimally degenerate analysis , the determinant @xmath2 , equalling the product of its _ four _ eigenvalues , is zero .",

    "let us also note , in our basic nine - dimensional scenario , that the expected value with respect to the hilbert - schmidt measure of the determinant of the _ commutator _ ( appearing in the von neumann equation for the time evolution of @xmath1 ) , @xmath28 = \\rho \\rho^{pt}- \\rho^{pt } \\rho$ ] , is zero too .",

    "the estimated separability probability now increased to 0.429121 .",
    "to arrive at the probability distribution ( [ libbynovick ] ) , we started with the beta distribution fit ( [ goodbetafit2 ] ) that exactly reproduced the first two moments , now trying to fit the first _ three _ moments .",
    "this involved a very long ( slowly converging ) iterative process , which at each stage , appealingly , seemed to improve the fit to all our computed fifty ( nine exact and forty - one , `` semi - exact '' ) moments .",
