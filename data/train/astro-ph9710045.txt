    "high velocity clouds ( hvcs ) are h i clouds moving at velocities inconsistent with simple models of galactic rotation and are generally defined to have @xmath6 exceeding 90 km s@xmath0 ( e.g. , wakker & van woerden 1997 ) .",
    "hvcs cover a significant fraction of the sky : about 37% at a h i column density limit of @xmath7 @xmath8 ( murphy , lockman , & savage 1995 ) . though hvcs were traditionally found only by their h i emission , there are now several cases of high velocity gas seen in absorption in c iv and si iv ( sembach et al 1995 , 1997 ; savage , sembach , & lu 1995 ) or in ca ii / mg ii ( dodorico , pettini , & ponz 1985 ; meyer & roth 1991 ; bowen et al 1994 ; ho & filippenko 1995 ) without counterparts in h i emission .    hvcs represent an important galactic or local group constituent that is poorly understood .",
    "their origin remains largely unknown even today , decades after their initial discovery .",
    "the only exception is the magellanic stream , which is generally accepted to be gas pulled out of the magellanic clouds either through tidal interactions with the milky way or by drag forces due to an extended tenuous corona in the galactic halo .",
    "many models have been proposed for the origin of hvcs , ranging from disk gas accelerated to high velocities by energetic events to infalling primordial gas from extragalactic space ( see wakker & van woerden 1997 for a review ) .",
    "understanding the hvc phenomenon may provide valuable information about the interactions between the galactic disk and halo and about the evolution of the galaxy .",
    "two of the most important parameters for understanding the origin of hvcs are their distances and chemical composition .",
    "recent efforts using stellar and extragalactic probes to detect the optical and uv absorption lines from hvcs have provided useful constraints on the distances of several hvcs ( see wakker & van woerden 1997 for a summary and for references ) , which indicate that several major hvc complexes are at least 4 kpc distant and at least 2.5 kpc above the galactic plane .",
    "absorption line studies at the ultraviolet ( uv ) and optical wavelengths also indicate that most , and perhaps all , hvcs contain some heavy elements ( cf . wakker & van woerden 1997 ) .",
    "however , deriving accurate elemental abundances for hvcs has proven difficult for several reasons : ( 1 ) one needs relatively high resolution ( fwhm@xmath9 km s@xmath0 ) data in order to separate the hvc absorption from the absorption at lower velocities arising from milky way disk gas , as well as to derive accurate column densities ; such data are difficult to obtain in the uv ; ( 2 ) optical ca ii and na i absorption lines , which are much easier to observe , do not provide accurate abundance estimates since these ions are not the dominant ionization species in h i gas ; ( 3 ) most measurements can be affected by elemental gas - phase depletion due to dust and in principle yield only lower limits to the actual abundance of the elements ; and ( 4 ) the reference h i column densities must be obtained from high resolution radio observations because of the presence of small angular scale structures in hvcs .    in an earlier hubble space telescope ( hst ) program ( lu et al 1994 ) , we obtained a uv spectrum of the bright seyfert galaxy ngc 3783 , which is projected onto a high velocity cloud denoted hvc 287.5 + 22.5 + 240 at galactic longitude @xmath10 and latitude @xmath11 ( mathewson , cleary , & murray 1974 ; hulsbosch 1975 ; morras & bajaja 1983 ) .",
    "we clearly detected the s ii @xmath121250 , 1253 absorption lines from the hvc at @xmath13 km s@xmath0 , which allowed us to derive a sulphur abundance for the hvc .",
    "this was the first hvc abundance measurement free of complications by dust because s is not readily affected by dust in the galactic ism ( jenkins 1987 ) . in this paper , we present hst observations of fe ii absorption from the hvc and use the relative abundances of s and fe to probe the dust content of the hvc .",
    "we also present a more reliable measure of h i column density in the hvc in the direction of ngc 3783 based on new interferometric radio observations , which is crucial for an accurate determination of elemental abundances .",
    "the observations and data handling are presented in section 2 .",
    "the abundance measurements are described in section 3 .",
    "evidence for dust in the hvc and implications of our results for the origin of the hvc are discussed in section 4 .",
    "section 5 briefly summarizes the main conclusions .",
    "we obtained a spectrum of ngc 3783 for hst program go-6500 using the goddard high resolution spectrograph ( ghrs ) on 7 july 1996 .",
    "the g270 m grating and the large science aperture ( 2``x2 '' ) were used .",
    "the spectrum was obtained with step - pattern 4 , which provides two samples per diode .",
    "standard fp - split and comb - addition procedures were used to reduce fixed pattern noise resulting from irregularities in the detector window and in the photocathode response .",
    "the total integration time was 9216 seconds with 11% of the time spent on measuring the background .",
    "the spectrum covers the wavelength region 2334 - 2380  , which contains the fe ii @xmath122344 and 2374 transitions .",
    "the resulting spectrum has a resolution of fwhm=13 km s@xmath0 , which is approximately one diode width .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio in the continuum is @xmath1414 per diode .",
    "the data are preserved in the hst archive under the identification z38p0101 t .",
    "data reductions were carried out using the idl - based ghrs reduction software ( robinson et al 1992 ) current as of july 1996 .",
    "a continuum was established by fitting a cubic spline function to spectral regions free of absorption lines .",
    "figure 1 shows the continuum - normalized profiles of the fe ii @xmath152344 and @xmath152374 lines recorded in the spectrum , as well as that of s ii @xmath151253 obtained by lu et al ( 1994 ) .",
    "the conversion between heliocentric velocity and lsr velocity is @xmath16 km s@xmath0 .",
    "note that the s ii absorption was obtained before the installation of costar , and the line spread function had a narrow core with broad wings ( see lu et al 1994 ) .",
    "we also show in figure 1 the 21-cm emission profile toward ngc 3783 obtained by murphy et al ( 1996 ) with the nrao 140-foot single - dish radio telescope with a beam width of 21 at a velocity resolution of 1 km s@xmath0 .",
    "the nrao data indicate a total h i column density of @xmath17(h i)=@xmath18 @xmath8 for the hvc . however , it is known that hvcs can have complex structures down to 1 scales ( cf . wakker & van woerden 1997 ) .",
    "consequently , this @xmath17(h i ) estimate could differ considerably from the true line - of - sight @xmath17(h i ) toward ngc 3783 .",
    "to determine a more accurate hi column density for the hvc along the sightline toward ngc3783 , we obtained high angular resolution ( 1 ) h i data with the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) interferometer at 1 km s@xmath0 velocity resolution .",
    "the interferometer data will be discussed in detail in a forthcoming paper ( wakker et al 1998 , in preparation ) .",
    "we note that the properties of the fine structure map of hvc287.5 + 22.5 + 240 from the interferometer data are similar to those observed in other hvcs ( cf .",
    "wakker & van woerden 1997 and references therein ) .",
    "variations of a factor @xmath145 in h i column density can occur over a few arc minutes , highlighting the danger of estimating line - of - sight @xmath17(h i ) from large - beam radio observations . about 30% of the flux in the nrao single - disk data is recovered by the interferometer .",
    "the atca data show that the column density directly toward ngc3783 is actually @xmath19 @xmath8 , as we explain next .",
    "first , the interferometer data were calibrated and mapped in the standard fashion .",
    "uniform weighting was used in order to obtain the maximum possible resolution , giving a synthesized beam of 60``x38 '' .",
    "the interferometer is sensitive to structure on scales less than 30. individual velocity channels were 1 km s@xmath0 wide .",
    "since the aperture plane coverage is fairly uniform , the major artifact in the maps is the presence of a `` bowl '' due to the non - observed zero and short spacings . to correct for this ,",
    "each channel map was deconvolved with the synthesized beam using the multi - resolution clean method ( wakker & schwarz 1988 ) .",
    "the channel maps were then corrected for the primary beam of the atca , which has an fwhm of 34. to compare the results with the nrao 140-foot spectrum , a simulated spectrum was generated by `` observing '' the final interferometer map with the nrao single - dish ( assuming a gaussian beam of fwhm=21 ) , and converting the spatially - integrated flux to brightness temperature using a conversion factor of 0.38 k / jy .",
    "the simulated spectrum represents the flux recovered by the interferometer within the 21 beam of the nrao single dish .",
    "figure  2 shows the spectrum of the hvc from the nrao single - dish ( 21 beam ) and the ( simulated ) spectrum recovered by the atca interferometer at 1 resolution .",
    "the difference between the two represents the flux filtered out by the interferometer .",
    "the single - dish spectrum can be adequately modeled as the superposition of two gaussian components with a total @xmath17(h i ) of @xmath18 @xmath8 .",
    "the spectrum recovered by the interferometer shows three components with a total @xmath17(h i ) of @xmath20 @xmath8 .",
    "thus , emission with an average column density of @xmath21 @xmath8 was filtered out by the interferometer . since in the exact direction of ngc 3783",
    "there is essentially no emission in the interferometer map , the above average column density also represents approximately the @xmath17(h i ) toward ngc 3783 .",
    "the exact @xmath17(h i ) toward ngc 3783 may differ from the above average column density owing to variation on scales greater than 30. however , experiments show that such variations should be less than @xmath22 @xmath8 .",
    "we therefore adopt @xmath17(h i)=@xmath23 @xmath8 or log @xmath17(h i)=@xmath24 in the analysis .",
    "to estimate the column density of fe ii in the hvc , we show in figure 3 the apparent column density profiles , @xmath25 , of the fe ii @xmath122344 , 2374 lines from the hst spectrum , which give the column density per unit velocity smeared by the line spread function ( see savage & sembach 1991 for a detailed discussion of @xmath25 ) .",
    "we adopt the fe ii oscillator strengths from morton ( 1991 ) for the @xmath152344 line ( @xmath26 ) and from cardelli & savage ( 1995 ) and bergeson , mullman , & lawler ( 1996 ) for the @xmath152374 line ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "the @xmath25 profiles of the two fe ii lines ( figure 3 ) , which differ in strength ( @xmath28 ) by a factor of 3.3 , agree well to within the measurement uncertainties , which suggests that neither line contains hidden , saturated components that are not resolved .",
    "it is thus straightforward to integrate the @xmath25 profiles to obtain total column densities . over the velocity interval 180 - 300 km s@xmath0",
    ", we find log @xmath17(fe ii)=@xmath29 and @xmath30 from the @xmath152374 and @xmath152344 lines , respectively . using different velocity intervals does not appreciably change the total column densities .",
    "for example , over 200 - 280 km s@xmath0 we find log @xmath17(feii)=@xmath31 and @xmath32 , while over 160 - 320 km s@xmath0 we find log @xmath17(fe ii)=@xmath33 and @xmath34",
    ". we will therefore adopt log @xmath17(fe ii)=@xmath30 or @xmath17(fe ii)=@xmath35 @xmath8 for the hvc .",
    "the @xmath17(h i ) of the hvc implies that the gas is very optically thick at the lyman limit ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "since fe ii is the dominant ionization stage of fe in h i gas , the ratio of @xmath17(fe ii)/@xmath17(h i ) should provide a reasonable estimate of the fe abundance .",
    "we thus find fe / h=@xmath4 solar or [ fe / h]@xmath37 for the hvc , where [ fe / h ] is the logarithmic abundance of fe relative to the solar abundance given by [ fe / h]=log(fe / h)@xmath38log(fe / h)@xmath39 .",
    "the abundance of s in the hvc is estimated to be s / h=@xmath3 solar or [ s / h]=@xmath40 .",
    "the s abundance given here is 1.7 times higher than that of lu et al ( 1994 ) for two reasons .",
    "( 1 ) lu et al estimated @xmath17(s ii)=@xmath41 @xmath8 for the hvc assuming the s ii absorption is on the linear part of curve of growth .",
    "direct integrations of the @xmath25 profiles of the s ii lines from 180 to 300 km s@xmath0 yield log @xmath17(s ii)=@xmath42 and @xmath43 from the @xmath151250 and @xmath151253 absorption lines , respectively .",
    "we have adopted the more accurate value from the @xmath25 integrations in this paper : log @xmath17(s ii)=@xmath44 or @xmath17(s ii)=@xmath45 @xmath8 .",
    "( 2 ) the @xmath17(h i ) of the hvc adopted here is 1.5 times lower than the one used by lu et al ( @xmath46 @xmath8 ) , which was based on lower - resolution 21-cm data . in the above calculations ,",
    "we have adopted the solar abundances of log ( s / h)@xmath47 and log ( fe / h)@xmath48 from anders & grevesse ( 1989 ) .    in the above analyses ,",
    "we have assumed that ionization corrections are sufficiently small that the ratios @xmath17(s ii)/@xmath17(h i ) and @xmath17(fe ii)/@xmath17(h i ) yield reasonable estimates of the s and fe abundances in the hvc . in reality",
    ", the hvc may contain some or even a substantial amount of ionized gas ; failure to account for this gas can result in large errors in the abundance estimates .",
    "savage & sembach ( 1996 ) have discussed various ionization processes that can have significant effects on interstellar abundance determinations . however , because hvc 287.5 + 22.5 + 240 is likely to be at large distances away from the galactic plane and is not known to contain stars , the processes that normally dominate the ionization of the gas in the galactic disk and low halo may be less important in the hvc . rather , the dominant ionization process in the hvc is likely to be photoionization by uv photons from the extragalactic background . for these reasons",
    ", we have run simple photoionization calculations using the code cloudy ( v90.02 ; ferland 1996 ) assuming a uniform gas density and a plane - parallel geometry for the cloud with photons incident from one side .",
    "we assume solar relative abundances ( anders & grevesse 1989 ) for the elements and an absolute metallicity of [ z / h]@xmath49 based on the s abundance . the uv ionizing background is assumed to have a energy distribution similar to the one adopted by madau ( 1992 ) without taking into account absorption by intergalactic clouds .",
    "we adopt a value of @xmath50 ergs s@xmath0 @xmath8 hz@xmath0 sr@xmath0 for the intensity of the uv background at the lyman limit , although the exact value is not critical since it is the ionization parameter , @xmath51 ( = the logarithmic ratio of the ionizing photon density to the gas particle density ) , that determines the ionization structure of the cloud .",
    "limited constraints on the ionization state of the hvc gas are provided by the following column densities : log @xmath17(s ii)@xmath52 , log @xmath17(fe ii)@xmath53 , log @xmath17(c iv)@xmath54 , and log @xmath17(n v)@xmath55 , with the latter two from the 2@xmath56 upper limits obtained by lu et al ( 1994 ) .",
    "the cloudy results indicate that all constraints are met if @xmath57 , at which s / h@xmath58(s ii)/@xmath17(h i ) and fe / h@xmath58(fe ii)/@xmath17(h i ) to within 0.1 dex .",
    "hence , within the context of this simple , naive photoionization calculation , it appears that our s and fe abundances obtained above are not subjected to significant ionization corrections . even assuming s / c@xmath142 - 3 times solar ( as is observed in galactic halo stars ; see wheeler , sneden , & truran 1989 ) in the hvc will not change the above conclusion . however , other ionization processes may also be at work and may even play a dominant role .",
    "for example , the hvc may be photoionized by uv photons leaking out the galactic disk , or the hvc may be collisionally ionized due to interactions with hot diffuse halo gas .",
    "future observations of adjacent ion stages of some elements ( e.g. , c ii - iv , si ii - iv , s ii - iii , etc ) will help to better constrain the ionization properties of the hvc .",
    "the abundance ratio of s and fe in the hvc , [ s / fe]=@xmath59 dex , is a factor of @xmath5 higher than the solar value .",
    "super - solar s / fe ratios are often observed in galactic ism clouds because s is essentially unaffected by dust while fe gets incorporated into dust grains easily ( cf .",
    "jenkins 1987 ) .",
    "for example , in the cool diffuse disk cloud toward @xmath60 ophiuchi , [ s / h]@xmath61 and [ fe / h]@xmath62 with a s / fe ratio 200 times that of the solar value ( see table 5 of savage & sembach 1996 and references therein ) , implying that 99.5% of the fe atoms in the cloud are missing from the gas phase and are ( presumably ) incorporated into dust grains . in the warm diffuse disk clouds which is more common ,",
    "savage & sembach ( 1996 ) report a mean s / fe@xmath1416 . even in diffuse halo clouds ,",
    "a population of interstellar clouds with the lowest known level of depletion , fe is depleted by a factor of 4 ( i.e. , s / fe=4 times the solar value ; sembach & savage 1996 ) .",
    "the high s / fe ratio in hvc 287.5 + 22.5 + 240 is likely caused by the same dust depletion effect .",
    "the inferred depletion level of fe in the hvc will depend on assumptions about the intrinsic s / fe ratio in the hvc .",
    "if the hvc has an intrinsically solar s / fe ratio , then fe is depleted by a factor of @xmath63 ( i.e. , 7 out of every 8 fe atoms are locked up in grains ) . on the other hand , if the hvc has an intrinsic s / fe ratio that is similar to metal - poor galactic halo stars , where s / fe@xmath642.5 solar ( cf .",
    "wheeler , sneden , & truran 1989 ) , then the implied fe depletion is only a factor of @xmath65 . in either case , however , some depletion of fe is required to explain the observed high s / fe ratio .",
    "attempts to search for dust in hvcs through its thermal emission in the infrared have all produced negative results ( see review by wakker & van woerden 1997 ) .",
    "such searches are severely hampered by the strong contamination from dust emission associated with foreground gas in the disk and low halo . probing the dust content of hvcs through the effects of dust on elemental abundances appear to be more fruitful , as evidenced by this study .",
    "however , this type of study is limited to hvcs with suitable background probes and requires assumptions about the reference abundances .",
    "as discussed below , hvc 287.5 + 22.5 + 240 probably has its origin in the magellanic clouds .",
    "the low dust - to - gas ratios in the smc , @xmath66 atoms @xmath8 mag@xmath0 , and in the lmc , @xmath67 atoms @xmath8 mag@xmath0 , ( koornneef 1984 ) , imply a reddening of @xmath680.0008 - 0.004 for hvc 287.5 + 22.5 + 240 .",
    "consequently , it will be extremely difficult to detect the dust in the hvc via its extinction .",
    "information on the abundances and dust content in hvcs can provide valuable clues to their origin .",
    "+ 22.5 + 240 is at the tip of a hvc complex which , projected onto the sky , appears to originate from the magellanic clouds but is on the opposite side of the magellanic stream with respect to the magellanic clouds ( see figures 2 and 3 of mathewson et al 1974 ) . based on this positional coincidence , mathewson et al ( 1974 ) suggested that hvc 287.5 + 22.5 + 240 may be part of the magellanic stream produced by tidal interactions between the magellanic clouds and the milky way .",
    "west et al ( 1985 ) reported a detection of ca ii absorption associated with hvc287.5 + 22.5 + 240 and deduced a low metallicity ( @xmath17(ca ii)/@xmath17(h i)@xmath69 of the solar ca / h value ) for the hvc .",
    "west et al argued that the low metallicity and the high galactocentric velocity of hvc 287.5 + 22.5 + 240 make it unlikely that the gas originated within the galactic plane .",
    "rather , they suggested that the hvc is probably an independent extragalactic object , possibly associated with the magellanic stream .",
    "the low metallicity of the hvc was confirmed by the s abundance determination of lu et al ( 1994 ) .",
    "the s abundance determination is significant because s is not readily affected by dust in the ism ( savage & sembach 1996 and references therein ) , while more than 90% of the ca atoms are generally found in dust grains ( phillips , pettini , & gondhalekar 1984 ) .",
    "the new s and fe abundance measurements obtained here can shed new light on the origin of hvc287.5 + 22.5 + 240 .",
    "the new measurements have the added significance that they are referenced to a more reliable h i column density obtained from the high resolution interferometric data .",
    "the low [ s / h]@xmath49 found for the hvc is broadly consistent with the s abundance found in the magellanic clouds : [ s / h]@xmath70 for the lmc and [ s / h]@xmath71 for the smc ( russell & dopita 1992 ) .",
    "the s / fe ratio in the hvc is also similar to that found in the interstellar gas of the magellanic clouds .",
    "for example , welty et al ( 1997 ; see also roth & blades 1997 ) presented to date the most extensive and accurate observations of _ interstellar _ gas - phase abundances in a h i region in the smc , and found [ zn / h]@xmath72 and [ zn / fe]@xmath73 ( note that zn , like s , suffers little dust depletion in diffuse galactic ism clouds ) . since the intrinsic abundance pattern in the magellanic clouds obtained from stellar abundance studies appears similar to the solar abundance pattern to within 0.2 dex or so ( russell & dopita 1992 ) , one expects [ s / h]@xmath72 and [ s / fe]@xmath73 dex for the interstellar gas in the smc . the similarities in the absolute s abundance and in the s / fe ratio ( i.e. , the level of fe depletion ) between hvc 287.5 + 22.5 + 240 and the magellanic clouds gas provide additional support to the suggestion that the hvc may have been part of the lmc / smc system previously .",
    "one of the main criticisms of the tidal model for the magellanic stream ( summarized by moore & davis 1994 ) has always been that tidal interactions would naturally lead to both a trailing tail and a leading arm .",
    "while the trailing tail was identified with the magellanic stream , no evidence for the leading arm was evident .",
    "however , recent model calculations by gardiner & noguchi ( 1996 ) predict that the leading arm falls in the range @xmath74 to @xmath75 , @xmath76 to @xmath77 , @xmath78 to @xmath79 km s@xmath0 , with most of the arm at @xmath80 to @xmath77",
    ". the observed hvc distribution in this part of the sky does not fit this arm precisely , but there are many hvcs in the region @xmath74 to @xmath75 , @xmath81 to @xmath82 , and @xmath78 to @xmath83 km s@xmath0 , including the clouds defined by wakker & van woerden ( 1991 ) as population ep ( containing hvc287.5 + 22.5 + 240 ) and complex wd .",
    "gardiner & noguchi note that the precise position and velocities of the leading arm depend on the potential of the lmc , which they assumed to be spherical and constant in time . in light of our abundance and depletion information , it may be worthwhile to revisit some of the tidal models to see if detailed agreement can be made between the leading arm and the observed hvc distributions in the general region of of hvc287.5 + 22.5 + 240 .",
    "very recently , blitz et al ( 1996 ) proposed that hvcs are most plausibly explained as members of local group of galaxies , essentially gas left over from the formation of the local group .",
    "evidence cited include : ( 1 ) the velocity centroid of the hvcs ( after excluding the magellanic stream ) is similar to that of the local group ; ( 2 ) if the clouds are stable entities and are gravitationally bound to the local group , theoretical considerations place them at distrances consistent with members of the local group ; ( 3 ) the clouds exhibit a relation betwen their angular sizes and their velocities relative to the local group standard of rest , with clouds inferred to be closer to the milky way having larger angular sizes .",
    "it was concluded that no other models can explain all these observed properties .",
    "however , the s abundance obtained for hvc287.5 + 22.5 + 240 appears too high to be consistent with the ( almost ) primordial material as required in the blitz et al model .",
    "clearly , it will be extremely important to obtain reliable metallicity determinations for a sample of representative hvcs in order to test this model rigorously .",
    "we present a hst ghrs spectrum of the seyfert galaxy ngc 3783 in the spectral region 2334 - 2380   in order to determine the abundance of fe in the high velocity cloud hvc287.5 + 22.5 + 240 , which is projected onto the background seyfert galaxy .",
    "the hvc has a velocity of + 240 km s@xmath0 with respect to the local standard of rest and is in the galactic direction @xmath84 and @xmath85 . to obtain an accurate h i reference for the hvc",
    ", we also obtained a high - resolution ( 1 ) 21-cm map of the hvc using the australia telescope compact array interferometer .",
    "coupling the fe abundance obtained here with our earlier determination of s abundance in the hvc , we discuss evidence for the presence of dust in the hvc and implications for the origin of the hvc .",
    "our main conclusions are as follows :    \\1 .",
    "our high - resolution interferometer data indicate that the actual h i column density in the hvc along the ngc3783 sightline is @xmath86 @xmath8 , which is a factor of 1.5 lower than that obtained previously from lower resolution ( 21 beam ) data .",
    "this result highlights one of the difficulties in abundance studies of hvcs : because hvcs usually contain very complex fine structures down to 1 scales , it is difficult to obtain accurate measures of line - of - sight @xmath17(h i ) toward background probes unless one obtains high angular resolution radio observations .",
    "we find the following metal abundances for the hvc using our more accurate @xmath17(h i ) determination : s / h=@xmath3 and fe / h=@xmath4 solar .",
    "the s / h value provides an accurate measure of the metallicity level in the hvc since s is not readily affected by dust depletion .",
    "the super - solar s / fe ratio , @xmath5 times solar , indicates that fe is depleted by dust in this hvc .",
    "this result provides strong evidence that at least some hvcs contain dust grains .",
    "the results also demonstrate that elemental abundance studies provide an effective way of probing the dust content of hvcs .",
    "\\3 . the metallicity level and",
    "the amount of fe depletion found in the hvc is very similar to those found in the interstellar gas of the magellanic clouds .",
    "these similarities , coupled with the velocity and the position of the hvc in the sky , strongly suggest that the hvc originated from the magellanic clouds .",
    "the same process(es ) that produced the magellanic stream may also be responsible for hvc287.5 + 22.5 + 240 and the hvc complex in that general region of the sky ( i.e. , population ep and complex wd of wakker & van woerden 1991 ) .",
    "in particular , hvc287.5 + 22.5 + 240 may represent gas in the `` leading arm '' that was predicted in tidal models for the magellanic stream ( eg .",

    "<S> the s / h value provides an accurate measure of the chemical enrichment level in the hvc , while the super - solar s / fe ratio clearly indicates the presence of dust , which depletes the gas - phase abundance of fe . the metallicity and depletion information obtained here , coupled with the velocity and the position of the hvc in the sky , strongly suggest that the hvc originated from the magellanic clouds . </S>",
