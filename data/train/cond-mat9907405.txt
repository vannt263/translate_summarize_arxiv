    "nevertheless , our current results suggests that the band gap of ge@xmath0 phase is about 1 ev higher than that of the diamond phase , which is similar to the 0.7 ev increment in band gap found for si@xmath0 and si@xmath23 clathrates @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the electronic band structure of ge@xmath0 clathrate are calculated independently via a simple tight - binding model .",
    "the tight - binding hopping parameters for germanium are taken from ref.[32 ] and the parameters for nearest neighboring atoms in clathrate structure is assumed to be the same as that in diamond . according to tight - binding calculation , the band gap of diamond is 1.13 ev and the gap for relaxed clathrate ge@xmath0 is 2.93 ev .",
    "although the tight - binding method usually overestimate the band gap of a system , the increment of 1.80 ev in the band gap from tight - binding model is in reasonable agreement with _ ab initio _ calculation .",
    "therefore , we expect that the true increase of band gap @xmath24 from diamond to ge@xmath0 clathrate phase might be between the lda and tb prediction , i.e. , 1.06 ev @xmath25 @xmath24 @xmath25 1.80 ev .",
    "this result suggests that the clathrate materials might be useful in the new electronic and optical application in the future .    since the ge@xmath0 clathrate structure is essentially a 3d network composed by ge@xmath26 and ge@xmath2 cages with face sharing , it is interesting to compare the electronic properties of the individual ge@xmath26 and ge@xmath2 cages with that of the clathrate .",
    "scf pseudopotential electronic structure calculations on isolated ge@xmath26 and ge@xmath2 clusters in fullerene cages are performed .",
    "the clusters are placed in a large simple cubic supercell with length of 28 a.u . in fig.4 , we present the calculated electronic density of states ( dos ) for ge@xmath26 and ge@xmath2 cages along with dos for diamond and ge@xmath0 .",
    "the detailed analysis are given in the following .",
    "= 3.0 in    firstly , we find that most of the peaks in the dos of ge@xmath0 can be assigned to ge@xmath2 , while the dos of ge@xmath26 also show some similarity with ge@xmath0 .",
    "the dos of ge@xmath2 is closer to that of clathrate because most atoms in clathrate are associated with ge@xmath2 cage .",
    "the presence of s - p gap in due to the large number of five - member rings in the cage and clathrate structure .",
    "this remarkable similarity implies that the ge@xmath0 clathrate can be taken as the small ge fullerene assembled solid with both geometrical and electronic hierarchy .",
    "however , both the ge@xmath2 and ge@xmath26 cages are not semiconductor systems and do not have open band gaps like ge@xmath0 clathrates .",
    "the band splitting in ge@xmath0 can be attributed to the sharing of face atoms by ge@xmath26 and ge@xmath2 and the interaction between neighboring fullerene cages .",
    "on the other hand , we can compare the dos of clathrate and diamond in fig.4 .",
    "several significant differences can be found . besides the improvement of band gap in clathrate upon diamond phase ,",
    "the total width of valence band of ge@xmath0 ( about 12 ev ) is narrower than that of diamond ( about 13 ev ) .",
    "this phenomenon has been also predicted in si@xmath0 clathrate @xcite and observed experimentally @xcite .",
    "we also found a gap opening between the s - like and p - like states in the case of ge@xmath0 clathrates as well as ge@xmath26 , ge@xmath2 clusters , while @xmath27 and @xmath28 states are overlapped in the dos of diamond .",
    "these remarkable differences in the electronic structure of clathrate and diamond can be understood by the large portion of five - fold ring in clathrate structure . in the diamond lattice consisting of @xmath29 six - fold ring , the @xmath30 orbital can form complete antibonding states , which can distribute to high energy and overlap with the lower @xmath31-like states .",
    "in contrast to diamond , the ge@xmath0 clathrate is composed of @xmath32 five - fold rings and @xmath33 six - fold rings . in the five - fold ring ,",
    "@xmath30 orbital can not form complete antibonding states so that the top of @xmath30-like states is still lower in energy than the bottom of @xmath31-like and a gap between @xmath27 and @xmath28 states inside valence band opens .",
    "the similar effect of five - fold ring on the @xmath31 bonding orbitals will induce the incompleteness of @xmath31-like states . as a consequence ,",
    "the valence band top of ge@xmath0 is lower than that of diamond , which corresponds to the narrowing of valence band width and broadening of fundamental gap between valence and conduction band .",
    "the novel electronic properties caused by five - fold ring and the similarity between clathrate and fullerene cages may be explored for future electronic and optical applications .",
    "although the pure silicon and germanium semiconductor clathrates are predicted to be locally stable , experiments have only synthesized the metal - doped clathrate compounds of si and ge .",
    "the metallic impurity atoms inside the clathrate might influence the electronic properties of clathrate due to the interaction between the metal atoms and semiconductor skeleton .",
    "here we have chosen the k@xmath1ge@xmath0 clathrate as such a model system to study the doping effect on germanium clathrate .",
    "the structural properties of k@xmath1ge@xmath0 are studied with the same procedure we have applied on ge@xmath0 clathrate : a static calculation of equation of states followed by a full relaxation .",
    "the minimized structure of k@xmath1ge@xmath0 clathrate is shown in fig.1 and the structural parameters of this minimum energy configuration is given in table i. it is natural to find that the lattice constant of cubic unit cell for k@xmath1ge@xmath0 clathrate is larger than pure ge@xmath0 clathrate in both ideal and relaxed structure because of the k atoms inside the fullerene cage .",
    "we also find a decrease of lattice constant from 10.79 @xmath18 to 10.45 @xmath18 after structure minimization .",
    "the minimized lattice constant ( 10.45 @xmath18 ) for the k@xmath1ge@xmath0 is in good agreement with experimental value ( 10.66 @xmath18 ) @xcite . during the minimization ,",
    "the geometries of k@xmath1ge@xmath0 relax from the perfect clathrate network a little more than that happened in the ge@xmath0 .",
    "first principles scf pseudopotential electronic structure calculation has been performed on the relaxed k@xmath1ge@xmath0 clathrate . in fig.3(b ) , we presented the electronic band structure of k@xmath1ge@xmath0 near fermi level .",

    "the valence bands of k@xmath1ge@xmath0 are very closed to the original bands in ge@xmath0 , while the conduction band structures have been slightly modified upon the inclusion of k atoms .",
    "= 3.0 in    we also study the difference of the electronic properties between the pure and doped systems by comparing their the electronic density of states ( dos ) .",
    "the density of states for ge@xmath0 and k@xmath1ge@xmath0 clathrate are compared in fig.5 .",
    "the dos of valence electrons in k@xmath1ge@xmath0 is very close to that in ge@xmath0 while the dos for conduction electrons of k@xmath1ge@xmath0 are somewhat different from that in ge@xmath0 . on the other hand , the gap between valence and conduction band is 0.23 ev narrower in the case of k@xmath1ge@xmath0 .",

    "we have also calculated the charge density distribution of ge@xmath0 and find it is very close to that of k@xmath1ge@xmath0 . as shown in fig.6 , there is almost no charge sitting on k sites .",
