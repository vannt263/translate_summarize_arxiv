    "@xmath14 , we discovered in @xcite a bilinear generalization of the well - known sogge estimates @xcite for @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) norms of @xmath17 normalized eigenfunctions of @xmath12 .",
    "these bilinear estimates play a central role in the analysis of @xcite concerning the nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nls ) posed on @xmath0 .",
    "the goal of this paper is to generalize our bilinear estimate of @xcite to all higher dimensions and to deduce new results regarding the global existence of solutions for nls when @xmath18 .",
    "we consider thus the cauchy problem for nls @xmath19 in ( [ intr-1 ] ) , @xmath20 is a complex valued function on @xmath0 .",
    "the nonlinear interaction @xmath21 satisfies @xmath22 and is supposed of the form @xmath23 with @xmath24 satisfying @xmath25 and , for some @xmath26 , @xmath27 the number @xmath28 involved in the second condition on @xmath29 corresponds to the `` degree '' of the nonlinearity @xmath30 in ( [ intr-1 ] ) . under these assumptions on @xmath21 ,",
    "nls can be seen as a hamiltonian equation in an infinite dimensional phase space .",
    "it follows from that hamiltonian structure that smooth solutions of ( [ intr-1 ] ) enjoy the conservation laws @xmath31 where the energy functional @xmath32 reads as follows , @xmath33 in view of ( [ intr-2 ] ) and ( [ intr-3 ] ) , the local well - posedness of ( [ intr-1 ] ) in @xmath34 ( with time existence depending upon the @xmath1 norm ) is of particular importance . if for example @xmath35 and @xmath36 , ( [ intr-2 ] ) provides an @xmath1 a priori bound and thus the local well - posedness of ( [ intr-1 ] ) in @xmath1 implies the global well - posedness in @xmath1 .",
    "let us notice , on the other hand , that the local well - posedness of ( [ intr-1 ] ) in @xmath37 , @xmath38 can be obtained by the classical energy method ( see @xcite ) .",
    "if @xmath0 is two dimensional , the well - posedness of ( [ intr-1 ] ) in @xmath34 is established in @xcite . in this case , the issue is to get an improvement of @xmath39 derivatives with respect to the energy method . in @xcite , this @xmath39 gain",
    "is achieved by a strichartz type inequality ( with derivative loss ) .",
    "therefore , for @xmath14 , the @xmath1 well - posedness theory for ( [ intr-1 ] ) is completed .",
    "moreover , in the recent paper @xcite , we establish a sharp @xmath37 theory in the case @xmath40 , as far as cubic nonlinearities are concerned .    in three dimensions ,",
    "the @xmath1 theory for ( [ intr-1 ] ) becomes much harder . in the case",
    "@xmath18 , the strichartz type inequalities established in @xcite yield the local well - posedness of ( [ intr-1 ] ) in @xmath37 , @xmath41 , as far as @xmath42 .",
    "notice that this is already a significant improvement with respect to the energy approach .",
    "unfortunately , it barely misses the crucial @xmath1 regularity .",

    "@xmath37 , @xmath41 strong solutions . by `` strong @xmath37 solutions '' ,",
    "we mean the existence , the uniqueness , the propagation of regularity and the uniform continuous dependence in bounded subsets of initial data in @xmath37 . moreover , the methods of @xcite also yield uniqueness of @xmath1 weak solutions .    on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath0 is the torus @xmath43 and @xmath44 , the global existence of @xmath1 strong solutions of ( [ intr-1 ] ) was established by bourgain  @xcite .",
    "the approach in @xcite is based on an ingenious use of multiple fourier series and thus relies deeply on the particular structure of the torus . in this paper",

    "it is used to ensure the uniqueness of solutions .",
    "however , observe that if @xmath66 , then the uniqueness holds in the class @xmath67 . in particular , our theorem implies that for any smooth data @xmath68 , there exists a unique global smooth solution .    in the appendix of this paper",
    ", we show that theorem [ thm1 ] can not hold for @xmath69 . the proof is based on an adaptation of an argument of a recent paper of christ - colliander - tao @xcite to the setting of compact riemannian manifolds .",
    "the critical case @xmath70 is still open .",
    "let us recall that the result of theorem [ thm1 ] was known if we replace @xmath0 with the euclidean space @xmath4 ( see ginibre - velo @xcite and kato  @xcite ) . to get the @xmath71 well - posedness of ( [ intr-1 ] ) , for @xmath44",
    ", it is sufficient to apply the picard iteration scheme to the duhamel formulation of f ( [ intr-1 ] ) in the space @xmath72 where @xmath73 depends only on @xmath74 .",
    "the approach on @xmath4 breaks down in the case of a compact manifold since the corresponding strichartz type estimates have to encounter some unavoidable derivative losses ( see @xcite ) . in order to deal with such losses ,",
    "bilinear improvements of the strichartz inequalities are very useful ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this is the approach that we will adopt in the proof of theorem [ thm1 ] when @xmath2 .",
    "the proof in the case @xmath75 is more intricate .",
    "the bilinear strichartz estimates that we are able to prove in the case @xmath75 are considerably weaker compared to the corresponding estimates for @xmath2 .",
    "however , they are sufficient to treat the case @xmath76 .",
    "the crucial new point involved in the analysis on @xmath77 is that we can prove a trilinear improvement of the strichartz estimate which enables one to treat the case @xmath78 for data in @xmath79 , @xmath41 .",
    "a suitable interpolation ( in the framework of a littlewood - paley analysis ) between the bilinear and the trilinear approach finally completes the argument in the case @xmath75 .",
    "the results of ginibre - velo  @xcite on @xmath80 , of bourgain  @xcite on @xmath81 ( and more recently on the irrational three dimensional torus  @xcite ) , and theorem  [ thm1 ] were obtained for seemingly different reasons in each case .",
    "for the torus the eigenfunctions enjoy very good algebraic properties and @xmath15 bounds whereas the spectrum is `` badly '' localized . on the other hand for the sphere @xmath45 , the eigenfunctions present `` bad '' concentration properties but the spectrum is very well localized , and the manifold @xmath82 has an intermediate behavior .",
    "the balance between these properties ( concentration of eigenfunctions and repartition of the spectrum ) leads to the suggestion that a similar result might hold for _ any _ three dimensional manifold",
    ". the proof of this conjecture would necessitate a general analysis of the schrdinger group , unifying these different approaches , which seems to be out of reach at the present moment .",
    "the @xmath1 theory for ( [ intr-1 ] ) in dimensions @xmath83 remains an open problem .",
    "the only known result in this direction is that of bourgain @xcite who gets _ global _",
    "@xmath84 solutions , if @xmath85 , @xmath41 .",
    "it seems that the obstructions to extending our approach to high dimensions are not only of technical nature since in @xcite we have shown that for no @xmath861,2]$ ] ( even very close to @xmath87 ) , the cauchy problem ( [ intr-1 ] ) , posed on @xmath88 can have strong @xmath1 solutions in the sense explained above .",
    "interestingly , the result of @xcite is in strong contrast with the situation on @xmath89 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we now turn to the crucial step in the proof of theorem  [ thm1 ] . to that purpose",

    "in view of further possible developments , we will also prove in section  [ sec.2 ] that for every @xmath1060,1]$ ] there exists @xmath107 such that @xmath108    in fact , we deduce theorem  [ thm2 ] as a consequence of a more general statement concerning the approximated spectral projectors @xmath109 , @xmath110 , @xmath111 , where @xmath12 is the laplace operator on an arbitrary compact riemannian manifold @xmath10 ( see theorem [ thm3 ] below ) .",
    "notice that when @xmath112 , apart from the @xmath113 loss in @xmath114 , we recover some particular case of the @xmath115 _ linear _ estimates of sogge @xcite . in the proof of theorem  [ thm1",
    "] , we typically apply theorem [ thm2 ] for @xmath116 and thus estimates ( [ thm2 - 1 ] ) , ( [ thm2 - 2 ] ) are used in their full strength .    in the case",
    "@xmath14 , estimate ( [ thm2 - 1 ] ) has already appeared in our previous paper @xcite . in @xcite , the proof is inspired by hrmander s work @xcite on carleson - sjlin type operators .",
    "the proof we present here is different even for @xmath14 and relies on a `` bilinearization '' of the arguments in @xcite .",
    "after several preliminaries , we reduce the matters to two micro - local _ linear _ estimates of quite a different nature .",
    "the first one is applied to the higher frequency eigenfunction and is in the spirit of the @xmath17 boundedness of spectral projectors .",
    "the second one is applied to the smaller frequency eigenfunctions and relies on a dispersive ( curvature ) effect .",
    "as far as the optimality of ( [ thm2 - 1 ] ) , ( [ thm2 - 2 ] ) is concerned , we notice that it is achieved either by testing the estimates against eigenfunctions concentrating on an equator or by testing against zonal eigenfunctions concentrating on a point .",
    "let us mention that estimates ( [ thm2 - 1 ] ) , ( [ thm2 - 2 ] ) and a sketch of the proof of ( [ thm2 - 1 ] ) appeared in @xcite .    the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec.2 ]",
