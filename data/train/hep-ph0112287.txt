    "before discussing how neutrino masses and oscillations really come out , we first examine which flavor neutrino mass terms affects the deviation of @xmath53 from unity . the mass matrix given by @xmath55 of the form of @xcite @xmath56",
    "can be diagonalized by @xmath57 defined by @xmath58 where @xmath59 = @xmath60 , which transforms @xmath61 = ( @xmath62)@xmath63 with masses of ( @xmath64 ) into @xmath65 = ( @xmath66)@xmath63 : @xmath67 .",
    "the masses and @xmath49 are calculated to be @xcite : @xmath68 where @xmath69 is always maintained by adjusting the sign of @xmath70 (= @xmath71 ) .",
    "the relation of eq.([eq : angle12 ] ) shows that the significant deviation of @xmath53 from unity is only possible if @xmath72 , namely , @xmath73 . in our subsequent discussions ,",
    "the solution of @xmath74 and @xmath75 is realized .",
    "let us briefly examine eqs.([eq : numasses123 ] ) and ( [ eq : angle12 ] ) in the zee model .",
    "since the zee mass matrix is parameterized by @xmath76 , leading to @xmath35 = 0 , we find that @xmath77\\frac{b^2+c^2}{4 } , \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\delta m^2_\\odot = m^2_2-m^2_1 = \\vert x \\vert \\sqrt{x^2 + 8}\\frac{b^2+c^2}{2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath78 is used for @xmath79 .",
    "it is obvious that the requirement of @xmath80 = @xmath81 for the large solar neutrino mixing gives @xmath82 , which contradicts with the observed result .",
    "more explicitly , the mixing angle @xmath49 is computed to be:@xcite @xmath83 since @xmath84 is derived , @xmath85 is expected because of @xmath86 implying @xmath87 .",
    "in fact , one can readily find that @xmath88 where @xmath89 = @xmath90 reduced to @xmath91 as expected , which can be derived by the use of @xmath92 .",
    "the approximation of @xmath93 , finally , gives @xmath53 expressed as:@xcite @xmath94 this result is entirely based on the constraint of @xmath92 , which enables us to relate @xmath95 to @xmath79 and @xmath96 , this constraint is violated by the inclusion of diagonal masses supplied by @xmath11 .",
    "we start with the  ideal \" solution @xcite with @xmath97 ( @xmath98 ) given by @xmath99 which provides @xmath100 and @xmath101 and the maximal atmospheric mixing .",
    "the deviation from this solution that yields @xmath102 and @xmath103 as @xmath104- and @xmath105-terms is caused by radiative effects , leading to @xmath106 : @xmath107 which provides the bimaximal neutrino mixing for @xmath108 .",
    "the diagonalization of the charged lepton masses generates an extra @xmath109-term ( = @xmath110 ) through the rotation of @xmath111 and @xmath112 , which gives @xmath75 , leading to @xmath113 : @xmath114 which finally provides the large solar neutrino mixing .",
    "to realize interactions that yield the  ideal \" solution of eq.([eq : simplestnumass1 ] ) and radiative neutrino masses in the specific entries of @xmath104 and @xmath105 as in eq.([eq : simplestnumass12 ] ) , we require all interactions to be invariant under the transformations of two symmetries , @xmath115 and @xmath116 associated with @xmath29 and @xmath30 , where ( @xmath29 , @xmath30 ) = ( 1 , 0 ) for @xmath0 ; = ( 0 , 1 ) for @xmath1 ; = ( 0 , @xmath117 ) for @xmath118 ; = ( @xmath117 , 0 ) for @xmath119 ; = ( @xmath120 , 0 ) for @xmath121 ; = ( @xmath117 , @xmath117 ) for @xmath122 ; = ( 1 , 1 ) for @xmath2 ; and = ( 2 , 0 ) for @xmath11 . similarly , the ordinary lepton number , @xmath123 , is given by @xmath123 = 1 for leptons , @xmath123 = @xmath120 for @xmath2 and @xmath11 and @xmath123 = 0 for @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "these quantum numbers are tabulated in table [ tab : quantumnumber1 ] .",
    "one can recognize that @xmath124 is nothing but the hypercharge ( @xmath125 ) and that @xmath5 coincides with @xmath25 for @xmath26 . because @xmath0 has @xmath126 and @xmath127 ,",
    "this charge assignment is readily extended to quarks such that the conservation of @xmath3 is respected by yukawa couplings of quarks to @xmath0 if @xmath126 and @xmath128 are assigned to quarks .",
    "but , @xmath1 is forbidden to couple to quarks . since leptons couple to both @xmath0 and @xmath1 ,",
    "our model yields additional contributions to the well - established low - energy phenomenology of leptons including those from dangerous flavor - changing interactions , which cause rare decays such as @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",
    "it will be shown that these interactions are well suppressed .",
    "the yukawa interactions for leptons are , now , given by @xmath131}{\\overline { \\left ( \\psi_l^e \\right)^c}}\\psi^i_lh^+ \\right ) \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\sum_{i , j=\\mu,\\tau } \\left ( f^{\\phi^\\prime}_{ij } { \\overline { \\psi^i_l}}\\phi^\\prime\\ell^j_r + \\frac{1}{2}f_{\\{ij\\}}{\\overline { \\left ( \\psi_l^i \\right)^c}}s\\psi^j_l \\right ) + { \\rm ( h.c . ) } , \\label{eq : ouryukawa}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath132 s stand for coupling constants and the subscripts of @xmath133 $ ] and @xmath134 , respectively , denote the symmetrization and antisymmetrization with respect to @xmath135 and @xmath136 .",
    "the masses of @xmath9 and @xmath10 are taken to be diagonal for simplicity . to meet the  ideal \" solution of eq.([eq : simplestnumass1 ] ) , we set @xmath137 = @xmath138 = @xmath139 .",
    "although this solution may require other dynamics or a certain symmetry restriction such as the one from a permutation symmetry of @xmath140 for the @xmath9 and @xmath10 @xcite , we do not further pursue such appropriate physical reasons .",
    "instead , we examine how the large solar neutrino mixing is implemented @xcite in our radiative mechanism by adopting this  ideal \" solution .",
    "higgs interactions are described by usual hermitian terms composed of @xmath141 ( @xmath142 = @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath11 ) and by non - hermitian terms in @xmath143 where @xmath144 and @xmath9 represent mass scales and @xmath145 stands for a higgs coupling .",
    "other possible couplings are forbidden by the conservation of @xmath5 .",
    "this situation can be read off from table [ tab : quantumnumber2 ] , where @xmath123 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath5 for possible higgs interactions are listed .",
    "however , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are to be spontaneously broken and a nambu - goldstone boson associated with @xmath4 is absorbed by the gauge bosons of @xmath146 , but the one associated with @xmath5 remains massless . to avoid the appearance of the massless nambu - goldstone boson",
    "is achieved by introducing a soft breaking term found in table [ tab : quantumnumber2 ] .",
    "the use of the conservation of @xmath5 organizes mass terms of neutrinos and charged leptons such that @xmath8-@xmath135 terms and @xmath135-@xmath136 terms ( @xmath147=@xmath148 ) have different origins , which are translated into the appearance of a generalized @xmath25 symmetry , which is identical to @xmath25 for @xmath26 .",
    "it should be noted that another advantage of using @xmath149 lies in the suppression mechanism for a divergent term of @xmath150 at the two loop level , which would require a tree level mass term of @xmath150 as a counter term .",
    "this is caused by the interaction of @xmath151 as depicted in fig.1(a ) .",
    "although this type of the diagram is forbidden by @xmath149 , it is in fact allowed by the formation of @xmath152 and @xmath153 , which yields fig.1(b ) through the interactions of @xmath154 and @xmath155 . however",
    ", this diagram leads to the finite convergent term .",
    "since charged lepton masses include off - diagonal terms , the form of the neutrino mass matrix is affected by the diagonalization process of charged lepton masses so as to maintain diagonal weak currents .",
    "the yukawa couplings of eq.([eq : ouryukawa ] ) provide the charged lepton mass matrix , @xmath156 , parameterized by @xmath157 arising from @xmath158 with @xmath159 defined by @xmath160 where @xmath161 = @xmath162 ( = @xmath163 ) for @xmath135 = @xmath148 have been assumed .",
    "the masses of @xmath164 s and @xmath165 s are given by @xmath166 for @xmath167 ( @xmath168 ) = @xmath169 ( @xmath170 ) and should at least satisfy @xmath171 to meet the hierarchy of @xmath172 . to realize @xmath172 requires new physics beyond the standard physics ; however , we do not intend to discuss how the hierarchy is physically explained but we simply use the parameterization based on the  hierarchical \" one @xcite to examine its influence on neutrino oscillations @xcite .",
    "it is straight forward to reach @xmath173 that transforms @xmath156 into @xmath174 = diag.(@xmath175 , @xmath176 , @xmath177 ) : @xmath178 up to the second order of @xmath179 s contained in @xmath180 : @xmath181 and the diagonal masses are calculated to be @xmath182 which give the upper bounds on @xmath180 : @xmath183 respectively , from @xmath184 and @xmath185 .    even after the rotation of the mass term given by @xmath186 ,",

    "the flavor - changing interactions are roughly controlled by the suppression factor of order @xmath195 ( = @xmath196 ) for @xmath197 , @xmath198 , @xmath199 , @xmath200 ( = @xmath201 ) for @xmath202 , @xmath203 and @xmath204 ( = @xmath205 ) for @xmath206 , @xmath203 , where @xmath164 is a mass of the mediating higgs scalar and @xmath207 = @xmath208=174 gev .",

    "it should be noted that there are no such higgs interactions for quarks that only couple to @xmath0 .",
    "the similar flavor - changing interactions caused by @xmath2 @xcite are sufficiently suppressed because of the smallness of the @xmath2-couplings to leptons to be estimated in eq.([eq : couplingvalues ] ) .      to estimate effects on the neutrino mass matrix through the rotation due to @xmath173 , we shift the original base into the one with the diagonalized charged lepton masses , which forces us to rotate the original neutrinos ( @xmath211 ) into @xmath212 in the weak base by @xmath213 .",

    "<S> therefore , both observed oscillations are characterized by large neutrino mixings with @xmath15 1.0 and @xmath16 ev@xmath17 @xcite for atmospheric neutrinos and with @xmath18 0.8 and @xmath19 ev@xmath17 @xcite for solar neutrinos corresponding to the most favorable large mixing angle ( lma ) msw solution .    </S>",
    "<S> neutrino oscillations occur if neutrinos have masses @xcite . since the oscillation data imply very tiny masses of @xmath20(10@xmath21 ) ev , one has to explain why neutrinos have such tiny masses @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> neutrinos can be massive majorana particles without their right - handed partners , whose masses are radiatively generated by the mechanism as discussed by zee @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this radiative mechanism indeed characterizes an underlying physics generating tiny neutrino masses . to be phenomenologically consistent , </S>",
    "<S> it is suggested @xcite to use the bimaximal mixing scheme @xcite based on a global @xmath7 ( @xmath22 ) symmetry @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> since the zee model only supplies flavor - off - diagonal mass terms , its bimaximal structure is inevitable to accommodate observed neutrino oscillations . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , we end up with the maximal solar neutrino mixings with @xmath23 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recent extensive analyses on solar neutrino data have , however , indicated that such a maximal solar mixing angle is not well compatible with the data , which prefer @xmath24 @xcite .    in this paper , we extend the zee model with the @xmath25 symmetry to accommodate the lma solution without the maximal solar neutrino mixing @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the original zee model consists of leptons ( @xmath26 and @xmath27 ) , two @xmath28-doublet higgs scalars ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 ) and one @xmath28-singlet charged scalar ( @xmath2 ) , where @xmath1 is constrained to couple to no leptons . </S>",
    "<S> however , such a constraint on the interactions of @xmath1 should be determined by a certain underlying symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> we introduce the invariance imposed by two global symmetries associated with the numbers of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 . </S>",

    "<S> the simplest resolution is to include flavor - diagonal mass terms . </S>",
    "<S> it is because the main source of @xmath33 in the zee model comes from the constraint on neutrino masses @xmath34 of @xmath35=0 specific to flavor - off - diagonal mass terms . </S>",

    "<S> the smallness of the neutrino masses is ascribed to that of @xmath37 , which is given by @xmath41 with @xmath42 produced by the combined effects of @xmath43 and @xmath44tr@xmath45 , where @xmath9 and @xmath46 are mass parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the type ii seesaw mechanism @xcite can be used to ensure tiny neutrino masses by the dynamical requirement of @xmath47 with @xmath48 .    in the next section </S>",

    "<S> the diagonalization of the charged lepton masses is performed in sec.iv and also shown is sufficient suppression of possible flavor - changing interactions , which are generated by @xmath0 and @xmath1 since charged leptons simultaneously couple to these higgs scalars . </S>",
    "<S> solar neutrino oscillations are found to exhibit the large mixing of @xmath54 as a result of the rotation . </S>",
