    "similar domain wall structures are used to describe an incommensurate phase of a monolayer of a monoatomic gas adsorbed on a hexagonal substrate  @xcite .",

    "there are six trimer configurations possible on such a patch .",
    "decorate each patch according to this configuration as shown in figure  [ fig : trimers : patches ] .",
    "it is tedious but straightforward to verify that the decorations of the patches making up the lattice fit together , giving a set of solid and dashed lines running from the bottom to the top of the lattice .",
    "it can also be checked that the crossings of these lines with the lattice rows correspond to the locations of the l - particles ( solid lines ) and r - particles ( dashed lines ) .",

    "we now derive the quadratic constraint  ( [ equ : trimers : quadratic ] ) by the same method as that used for rectangle  triangle random tiling models in @xcite and  @xcite . cut the torus open along a horizontal row of sites , so that the model is now on a cylinder . by stacking a number of copies of the configuration on top of each other",
    "we can achieve that each world line winds around the cylinder an integer number of times .",
    "let @xmath16 be the number of rows .",
    "in each row we can count the number of l - particles and r - particles : @xmath49 summing over the entire lattice yields @xmath50 since the world lines of the l - particles do not cross each other , they all have the same winding number  @xmath51 . in order to compute this winding number",
    "consider the total leftward movement of the l - particles .",
    "there are @xmath45 such particles , each of them winds around the cylinder @xmath51 times , and each winding constitutes a movement of @xmath27 blocks to the left , so the total leftward movement amounts @xmath52 blocks .",
    "it can be seen from figure  [ fig : trimers : patches ] that an l - particle moves half a block to the left at a trimer on sub - lattice 2 or  5 , while there is no horizontal movement of l - particles at a trimer on another sub - lattice .",
    "summing over the entire lattice shows the total leftward movement of the l - particles to be @xmath53 blocks .",
    "hence @xmath54 fully analogously one has @xmath55 now consider the number of crossings of l - particle lines and r - particle lines .",
    "there are @xmath45 l - particles each winding leftward around the cylinder @xmath51 times , and @xmath46 r - particles each winding rightward around the cylinder @xmath56 times , so the number of crossings is @xmath57 . from figure  [ fig : trimers : patches ] it is seen that crossings occur precisely at trimers on sub - lattice 2 or  4 , so that the number of crossings is @xmath58 .",
    "equating these two expressions for the number of crossings gives @xmath59 substituting into the above equation first ( [ equ : trimers : windleft ] ) and ( [ equ : trimers : windright ] ) , then ( [ equ : trimers : totalnleft ] ) and ( [ equ : trimers : totalnright ] ) , then multiplying by @xmath60 and finally using @xmath61 yields @xmath62 dividing by @xmath63 gives  ( [ equ : trimers : quadratic ] ) .",
    "for the sake of the argument we have stacked a number of copies of the original configuration on top of each other , but the resulting ( [ equ : trimers : quadratic ] ) is not affected by this .",
    "in this section we describe a bethe ansatz ( ba ) that diagonalises the transfer matrix . since the particle numbers @xmath45 and @xmath46 are conserved quantities the transfer matrix is block diagonal .",
    "we begin by considering the sector with @xmath64 and @xmath65 and then pass to sectors with higher particle numbers .",
    "the only state in the sector @xmath64 , @xmath65 is the reference state which consists entirely of blocks @xmath26 , so this sector is one - dimensional .",
    "therefore the transfer matrix acting on this sector is trivially diagonal .",
    "the layer between two consecutive rows in the reference state consists of @xmath27 trimers on sub - lattice  0 , so its boltzmann weight is @xmath66 .",
    "it is the eigenvalue of the transfer matrix in this sector . for convenience",
    "we define the `` reduced '' transfer matrix @xmath67 to be the transfer matrix @xmath23 divided by  @xmath66 .",
    "consider a row of spins containing a single l - particle ( @xmath42 ) at position  @xmath41 .",
    "the transfer matrix has shifted this particle from position @xmath68 in the row below half a step to the left , see figure  [ fig : trimers : ddutransfer ] .",
    "the layer between the two rows contains @xmath69 trimers on sub - lattice  0 and one trimer on sub - lattice  5 .",
    "hence the action of the ( reduced ) transfer matrix on the `` wave function '' is given by @xmath70 ( we use @xmath71 as notation for the row configuration that has a block @xmath42 at position @xmath41 and blocks @xmath26 at the other positions . ) the solution of the eigenvalue problem @xmath72 is @xmath73 where @xmath74 is some constant , and @xmath75      consider a row of spins containing an l - particle ( @xmath42 ) at position  @xmath41 and an r - particle ( @xmath44 ) at position  @xmath76 , with  @xmath77 . if the particles are apart , this situation was formed by shifting the l - particle to the left and the r - particle to the right : @xmath78 ( we write the arguments of @xmath79 in order of increasing position ; for example , the notation in the lhs of ( [ equ : trimers : oneone1 ] ) implies that  @xmath77 . )",

    "in subsections [ sub : trimers : sublat ] and  [ sub : trimers : constraint ] a linear and a quadratic constraint on the six sub - lattice densities were derived . in this section",
    "we first show that these constraints imply a breaking of the symmetry between certain sub - lattices .",
    "this symmetry breaking suggests that a phase transition takes place when the total density @xmath131 of down trimers is increased from 0 to  1 .",

    "the entropy of the model can be computed to high precision .",
    "such calculations confirm that for @xmath149 the entropy takes its maximum at the symmetric case ( [ equ : trimers : broken ] ) of the sub - lattice densities , hence within the solvable subspace .",
