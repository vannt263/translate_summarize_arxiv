    "engines are machines that convert some form of energy ( e.g. , thermal or electrical energy ) into work .",
    "their efficiency , defined as the ratio of the extracted work to the invested energy , is restricted to @xmath0 at most by the energy - conservation law .",
    "while mechanical engines may reach this bound , carnot showed  @xcite that the efficiency of any heat engine that cyclically operates between two thermal baths is universally limited by the ratio of the bath temperatures , regardless of the concrete design  @xcite .",
    "the universality of this bound led to the formalisation of the second law of thermodynamics and the introduction of the notion of entropy by clausius  @xcite . in terms of entropy",
    ", the carnot bound is attained by ( idealised ) heat engines that operate reversibly , so that the total entropy of the engine and the baths is unaltered over a cycle  @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to the minimum amount of heat being dumped into the cold bath , so as to close the cycle , and hence to the maximum input heat being transformed into work . by contrast , in an irreversible cycle , a larger amount of heat must be dumped into the cold bath , so that less input heat is available for conversion into work , causing the engine efficiency to decrease  @xcite .    as part of the effort to understand the rapport between quantum mechanics and thermodynamics  @xcite",
    "( see  @xcite for recent reviews ) , the carnot bound has been challenged for quantum engines that exploit non - thermal quantum baths  @xcite . in this respect ,",
    "a distinction is to be drawn between two types of non - thermal engines  @xcite , ( i ) engines wherein the working medium equilibrates to a thermal state whose temperature is adjustable ( e.g. , by the phase of the coherence in a `` phaseonium '' bath  @xcite ) , which qualify as genuine heat engines with a controllable carnot bound , and ( ii ) engines wherein the non - thermal ( e.g. , squeezed  @xcite ) bath may render the working - medium state non - thermal , making the carnot bound irrelevant .",
    "the efficiency bound of the latter type of engines has been addressed  @xcite but still needs elucidation : what is particularly puzzling is that , contrary to heat engines , their efficiency bound can not be deduced from the requirement of reversible operation : reversibility may entail an efficiency bound that not only surpasses the carnot bound but also unity  @xcite , making it unachievable .",
    "hence , the question naturally arises whether such engines are limited by constraints other than the second law .",
    "the second law for quantum relaxation processes is widely accepted  @xcite to be faithfully rendered by spohn s inequality  @xcite .",
    "here we show that the inadequacy of assessing the maximum efficiency via this standard reversibility criterion arises whenever the engine s working medium is in a non - passive quantum state  @xcite .",
    "the definition  @xcite of a non - passive state is that its energy can be _ unitarily _ reduced until the state becomes passive , thereby extracting work .",
    "non - passive states may thus be thought of as being `` quantum batteries ''  @xcite or `` quantum flywheels ''  @xcite ( fig .  [ fig_ergotropy ] ) .",
    "the maximum amount of work extractable from such states ( their `` work capacity '' ) has been dubbed `` ergotropy '' in ref .",
    "for example , every population - inverted state is non - passive and so are , e.g. , coherent or squeezed field states , whereas thermal states are passive .",
    "as we show , the standard reversibility criterion provides an inequality for the change in the engine entropy which may be much too loose ( non - tight ) to be useful if non - passive states are involved .",
    "the distinction between non - passive and passive states is at the heart of our analysis and underlies our division of the energy exchanged between a quantum system and a bath into a part that _ necessarily _ causes an entropy change , and ergotropy .",
    "our proposed division is in fact a new unraveling of the first law of thermodynamics for quantum systems .    in scenarios where non - thermal baths may create non - passive states of the working medium ,",
    "we derive a new inequality for the entropy change which yields a physical efficiency limit of the engine that never surpasses unity .",
    "this efficiency limit is universal and in general can not be assessed by the standard reversibility criterion .",
    "concrete examples of such engines are given .",

    "we here consider general scenarios , wherein the bath and/or the system may be in a non - thermal state and strive to better understand the nature of the exchanged energy   and , in particular , its relation to entropy change .",

    "the microscopic decomposition of the exchanged energy   into dissipative change in passive energy   and dissipative ergotropy change   is a new unraveling of the first law of thermodynamics for quantum systems that constitutes one of our main results .",
    "the decomposition   carries with it the following insights : ( a )  although ergotropy may be transferred from a non - thermal bath to the system in a non - unitary fashion , it may afterwards still be extracted from the system in the form of work via a suitable unitary transformation .",
    "( b )  consistently , any _ unitary _ changes ( in either ergotropy or in passive energy due to time - dependent changes of the hamiltonian ) are associated with work  .",
    "if the hamiltonian is constant , then @xmath22 is only the change in passive energy without work , @xmath23-{\\operatorname{tr}}[\\pi_0h]$ ] , where @xmath24 is the passive counterpart of the initial state @xmath1 .",

    "( in the limit @xmath51 ) .    here we contend that although inequality   is a formally correct statement of the second law ( under standard thermodynamic assumptions ) , it may not provide a meaningful estimate of @xmath48 if a system is initialised in a non - passive state and/or interacts with a non - thermal bath .",
    "physically , this is because , as discussed above , the exchanged energy @xmath50 may be non - zero even if the entropy does not change .",
    "consider the decay of an initially non - passive state @xmath1 to a ( passive ) thermal state @xmath52 via contact with a thermal bath at temperature @xmath53 .",

    "what follows we shall revise this inequality , which may greatly overestimate the actual entropy change . as shown below",
    ", a tight inequality for @xmath48 is indispensable for correctly assessing the maximum efficiency of an engine .",
    "as we have seen , dissipative ergotropy change is not necessarily linked to a change in entropy .",
    "therefore , the lower bound on @xmath48 in eq .   may be not tight ( maximal ) .",
    "it is obtained from spohn s inequality   for the relaxation of an initially non - passive state in a thermal bath .",
    "however , one may resort to the fact that the entropy @xmath55 is a state variable , so that @xmath56 is path - independent , i.e. , its value only depends on the initial state @xmath1 and the ( passive ) thermal steady state @xmath52 . hence , spohn s inequality   may well be applied to alternative evolution paths from @xmath1 to @xmath52 , giving rise to different inequalities for the _ same _ @xmath48 .",
    "in particular , we now consider a path that does not involve any dissipation of ergotropy to the bath : namely , one may start the process by performing a unitary transformation to the passive state , @xmath57 .",
    "thereafter , this state is brought in contact with the thermal bath , yielding the steady - state solution @xmath52 .",
    "inequality   applied to this alternative path yields @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the same as in eq .  .",
    "the steady state attained via contact with a thermal bath is passive , hence the system ergotropy must decrease as a result of the relaxation , @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the initial ergotropy stored in the state @xmath1 .",
    "hence , inequality   always entails inequality   and is thus a tighter and more relevant estimate of @xmath48 .",
    "this has a crucial consequence : if the initial state is non - passive , inequality   rules out the equality sign in inequality  , so that the considered decay via contact with a thermal bath can never be reversible according to criterion  .",
    "we now consider the more general situation wherein the system is governed by a constant hamiltonian and interacts with an arbitrary bath ( that may not be parameterised by a temperature ) until it reaches the steady state @xmath47 . in order to obtain an optimal ( the tightest ) inequality for the entropy change @xmath48 ,",
    "we here instead of inequality   ( @xmath62 for such a bath is given in appendix  [ app_sigma_non - thermal ] ) propose to adopt the mathematical relation @xmath63 as shown in appendix  [ app_sigmap_optimal ] , eq .",
    "provides generally a tight inequality for @xmath48 . the motivation for eq .",

    "we now allow the hamiltonian @xmath3 to slowly vary during the evolution  @xcite .",
    "contrary to the case of a constant hamiltonian , the dissipative passive - energy change   and the ergotropy change   in the r.h.s .  of eq .",
    "are now path - dependent .",
    "namely , they are not only determined by the initial state @xmath1 and the steady state @xmath67 , which is a thermal state under the hamiltonian @xmath68 .    since during the evolution the time - dependent hamiltonian may generate a non - passive state (",
    "even if the initial state is passive and the bath is thermal ) we can not , in general , find an alternative path void of dissipated ergotropy for the same @xmath3 .",
    "notwithstanding , we may still consider a path void of _ initial _ ergotropy in the spirit of the previous section by extracting the ergotropy of the initial state in a _",

    "afterwards , this passive state is brought into contact with the thermal bath , yielding the steady state @xmath67 .",

    "a prime example is a harmonic oscillator that interacts with a squeezed thermal bath  @xcite : its steady state is a squeezed thermal state",
    ". then one can show ( appendix  [ app_liouvillian ] ) that this situation can be traced back to the interaction of a unitarily - transformed state @xmath76 with a _",

    "the relaxation of a possibly non - passive state @xmath77 in a thermal bath pertains to the scenario considered above upon replacing @xmath2 by @xmath77 there .",
    "equation   thus also holds for this class of non - thermal baths ( the generalisation to arbitrary non - thermal baths is discussed in appendix  [ app_time - dependent_hamiltonian ] ) .",
    "the new entropic inequality   is the second main result of our work .",
    "for the special case of a constant hamiltonian , it reduces to inequality  .",
    "in view of our new inequality  , does inequality   always provide a true bound on the engine efficiency ?",
    "namely , is reversibility indeed the key to operating a quantum engine at the highest possible efficiency ?",
    "this question arises for cyclic engines fuelled by non - thermal ( e.g. , squeezed ) baths , since such baths may transfer both passive thermal energy and ergotropy to the system while eq .",

    "the engine operates in an arbitrary cycle wherein work is extracted by a piston and an amount of energy @xmath78 is dumped into the cold thermal bath . ]    here we consider a quantum engine ( fig .  [ fig_engine ] ) that operates between a cold thermal bath ( at temperature @xmath79 ) and a hot non - thermal bath ( whose thermal component has the temperature parameter @xmath80 ) subject to a time - dependent drive ( the `` piston ''  @xcite ) .",
    "existing treatments of such engines have taken the interactions with the baths to be isochoric , i.e. , subject to a constant system hamiltonian  @xcite .",
    "we here relax this restriction and allow for stroke cycles wherein the working - medium ( wm ) hamiltonian is allowed to slowly change during the interaction with the baths  @xcite .",
    "more restrictively , during the interaction with the non - thermal bath , the hamiltonian is assumed to commute with itself at all times , as previously mentioned in the discussion on the validity of eq .",
    "for such a bath .",
    "we only impose the condition that the wm attains its steady state at the end of the energising stroke ( wherein it interacts with the hot non - thermal bath ) and the resetting stroke ( wherein it interacts with the cold thermal bath ) .",
    "the energising stroke is described by a master equation  @xcite that evolves the wm state to a unitarily - transformed thermal state @xmath81 , hence eq .",
    "holds . after this stroke ,",
    "the wm is in a non - passive state , whose ergotropy is subsequently extracted by the piston via a suitable unitary transformation . since we seek the efficiency bound , we assume that no ergotropy is dissipated in the cold bath ( and thus lost ) , hence the requirement to extract it from the wm before its interaction with that bath .",
    "we note that in cycles where both baths are simultaneously coupled to the wm ( as in continuous cycles  @xcite ) , part of the ergotropy is inevitably dissipated into the cold bath , so that such cycles are inherently less efficient than stroke cycles adhering to the above requirement .",

    "next , we consider a quantum otto cycle  @xcite that consists of two isentropic strokes ( adiabatic compression and decompression of the wm ) , two isochoric strokes ( interaction with the baths at a fixed hamiltonian ) and an additional ergotropy - extraction stroke .",
    "this cycle amounts to setting @xmath121 and @xmath122 in fig .",
    "[ fig_carnot ] .",
    "since the hamiltonian is now kept constant during the energising stroke , we have @xmath123 , where @xmath124 is the change in passive energy during the hot stroke , and @xmath125 , where @xmath126 is the change in ergotropy during that stroke . the efficiency of this otto - like cycle is bounded by eq .  , @xmath127 but this bound is only attained in the `` mechanical '' limit @xmath128 , where only ergotropy is transferred from the non - thermal bath and no net entropy change occurs during the strokes . by contrast , the carnot - like cycle always operates at maximum efficiency , even when both passive thermal energy and ergotropy are imparted by this bath .    in general , any engine cycle wherein the interaction with the hot bath is isochoric ( has constant hamiltonian ) and sufficiently long ( for the wm to reach steady state ) abides by the bound  , which is lower than the bound @xmath95 imposed by the second law ( fig .",

    "and alternative efficiency bounds ( the explicit expressions are summarised in appendix  [ app_figures ] ) for an otto - like cycle implemented with a harmonic - oscillator working medium and a squeezed thermal bath as a function of ( a ) the frequency ratio and ( b ) the squeezing parameter .",

    "our analysis has been aimed at comparing the efficiency bounds and the conditions for their attainment in quantum engines energised by thermal and non - thermal baths .",
    "these respective bounds turn out to be very different since , unlike thermal baths , non - thermal baths may exchange thermal ( passive ) energy and ergotropy with the working medium ( wm ) . to this end",
    "we have revisited the first law of thermodynamics and identified as passive - energy change the part of the energy exchange with the bath that _ necessarily _ causes a change in the wm entropy [ eq .  ] .",
    "this division of the exchanged energy relies on the distinction between passive and non - passive states of the wm .",
    "only the latter states store ergotropy that may be completely extracted in the form of work .",
    "we note that our approach based on non - passive states conceptually differs from the energetic division involving `` housekeeping heat '' previously provided for classical systems  @xcite .",
    "based on the distinction between passive and non - passive states , we have put forward a new estimate   of the entropy change in quantum relaxation processes , which turns out to be the key for understanding the limitations of quantum engines fuelled by arbitrary baths .",
    "cyclic engines whose passive energy is altered by the baths are restricted in efficiency by limits on their entropy change . yet , for a wide class of practically - relevant engines , including all engines whose energising stroke is either isochoric or carnot - like , the restriction imposed by inequality   on the entropy change is stricter than what the second law   would allow . by contrast , the commonly used reversibility is a global condition on the wm and the baths combined that is imposed by the second law , and hence not necessarily a relevant characterisation of engine efficiency .",
    "an alternative formulation of our main insight is that , for any baths , entropy change limits the engine efficiency in the _ same _ way as in traditional heat engines ",
    "condition   is the same whether the energising bath is thermal or not .",
    "namely , maximal efficiency is reached when ( a )  no ergotropy ( extractable work ) is dumped into the cold bath and ( b )  no entropy is generated within the engine , or , equivalently , minimal energy is dumped into the cold bath  @xcite . for thermal engines ,",
    "this criterion of minimal energy dumping and the reversibility criterion coincide , but the two criteria differ if the energising bath is non - thermal .",
    "another important insight is that the same efficiency bound   ensues whether the wm is energised by a non - thermal bath or by a thermal bath ( that supplies thermal energy ) combined with a battery ( that supplies ergotropy ) provided the total energy imparted by the wm remains the same .",
    "this supports the description of non - thermal engines as hybrids of thermal ( thermal - energy - fuelled ) and `` mechanical '' ( ergotropy - fuelled ) engines  @xcite .",
    "our theory provides better understanding of the operation principles of quantum engines : these are shown not to follow only from the laws of thermodynamics , but require discrimination between different ( passive and non - passive ) quantum states of the system ( wm ) and the baths involved .",
    "the present generalisation of the treatment of standard thermal processes for quantum systems is not only the key to the construction of the most efficient hybrid engines that are unrestricted by the carnot bound .",

    "<S> the efficiency of heat engines is limited by the carnot bound , attained when the engine cycle is reversible . </S>",
    "<S> quantum engines fuelled by non - thermal ( e.g. , squeezed - thermal ) baths have been shown to surpass this bound . yet , their maximum efficiency can not be determined by the reversibility condition , which may yield an unachievable efficiency bound above  @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> this prompts the question : what does really limit the efficiency ? we identify the fraction of the exchanged energy between a quantum system and a bath that necessarily causes an entropy change and derive a new inequality for the latter . </S>",
    "<S> this formulation reveals a universal efficiency bound for quantum engines which is invariably attained for the least dissipation over the engine cycle but does not imply reversibility , unless the baths are thermal . </S>",
    "<S> this bound thus can not be solely deduced from the laws of thermodynamics . </S>",
    "<S> we illustrate these results for the practically - relevant carnot- and otto cycles energised by non - thermal baths , which are both shown to be restricted by our new efficiency bound . </S>"
