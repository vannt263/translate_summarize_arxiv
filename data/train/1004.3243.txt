    "there has been much evidence to suggest that the standard model ( sm ) is not a complete description of particle physics and needs extending .",
    "arguably one of the most important pieces of experimental evidence for physics beyond the sm is the measurement of small but non - zero neutrino mass , leading to theories of neutrino mass and mixing . in the seesaw mechanism , a natural explanation for such tiny neutrino masses",
    "is provided by the exchange of a heavy particle leading to majorana neutrino masses suppressed by the large mass of the exchanged particle .",
    "the heavy particle in the seesaw mechanism must be a colour singlet but can be an electroweak singlet fermion with zero hypercharge , an electroweak triplet higgs scalar with two units of hypercharge , or an electroweak triplet fermion with zero hypercharge , corresponding to the type  i @xcite , type  ii @xcite , or type  iii @xcite seesaw mechanisms , respectively . in this letter",
    "we shall combine the seesaw mechanism of types  i and  iii in a new way to yield a hierarchical spectrum of neutrino masses .",
    "however the seesaw mechanism is not by itself enough to account for the discovery that , in contrast with the smallness of the quark mixing angles , two out of the three leptonic mixing angles are large .",
    "this unexpected observation calls for a deeper theoretical understanding of the physics underlying the structure of fermion masses and mixings .",
    "it is well known that solar and atmospheric data are consistent with a simple form of the leptonic mixing matrix @xmath7 , known as tri - bimaximal ( tb ) mixing @xcite : u_tb=    & & 0 + - & & - + - & &    [ eqn : tbm ] .",
    "the simple form of this matrix can be interpreted as a clue that points towards some underlying family symmetry @xmath8 , related to particular transformations which leave the mass matrix diagonalised by @xmath9 invariant .",
    "there has been much recent work based on this idea that the postulated tb symmetry can arise from a family symmetry @xcite .",
    "the approaches taken in the literature may be separated into two distinct classes , distinguished by the breaking of the family symmetry @xcite : _ direct _ models , based on @xmath1 , @xmath10 , or larger groups containing these as subgroups @xcite , have part of the family symmetry preserved at low energies and this forms some or all of the neutrino flavour symmetry ; _ indirect _ models , usually based on @xmath11 or @xmath12 @xcite , have entirely broken family symmetries ( in the neutrino sector ) , and the neutrino flavour symmetry appears accidentally .",
    "finding an explanation for the distinctly different mixing patterns of leptons as compared to quarks is even more important in the context of grand unified theories ( guts ) @xcite , where the fermionic matter is unified at high energies into either a single representation , as in @xmath13  @xcite or @xmath14  @xcite , or into two representations , as in @xmath0  @xcite or @xmath15  @xcite .",
    "the minimal gut  @xcite is based on the lie group @xmath0 , where one family of right - handed down quarks and left - handed leptons are unified in a @xmath16 and the rest of the family are in a @xmath17 .",
    "three copies of each of these representations then constitutes the full fermionic matter content of minimal @xmath0 .",
    "it is well known that gauge coupling unification fails in this regime , however if promoted to a supersymmetric ( susy ) gut  @xcite with two higgs multiplets , @xmath18 and  @xmath19 , then unification occurs at a scale of roughly @xmath20 gev @xcite .",
    "it is clear that neutrino masses are zero at the renormalisable level in minimal ( susy ) @xmath0 as in the minimal sm .",
    "however , in both the sm and @xmath0 , as pointed out by weinberg @xcite , one may invoke a non - renormalisable dimension-5 operator at or above the gut scale to generate neutrino masses .",
    "such an operator at the gut scale may be sufficient to describe the solar neutrino mass scale , but not the atmospheric neutrino mass scale . in order for neutrinos to obtain mass consistent with atmospheric mixing in a ( susy ) @xmath0 model , the seesaw mechanism is a very attractive possibility , however this requires some extra matter or higgs to be added below the gut scale .",
    "the choice of additional matter or higgs is very _ ad hoc _ since the @xmath0 theory does not specify the nature of this extra matter and only requires that it be anomaly - free .",
    "a popular choice is to add three right - handed neutrinos which arise from singlet @xmath0 representations .",
    "however the number of singlets is not predicted in @xmath0 , and it is possible to add just a single right - handed neutrino to describe the atmospheric mass scale @xcite . in order to describe both atmospheric and solar neutrino masses with two large mixing angles using the type  i seesaw mechanism two right - handed neutrinos are sufficient @xcite .",
    "however , within @xmath0 guts , there are other possibilities .",
    "it has been pointed out that , in ( susy ) @xmath0 guts , non - fundamental matter multiplets have decompositions which include both fermion singlets and fermion triplets suitable for the type  i and iii seesaw mechanism , the smallest such example being the adjoint @xmath21 representation @xcite .",
    "the decomposition of a matter @xmath21 under the sm gauge group @xmath22 involves an @xmath23 singlet @xmath24 as well as a triplet @xmath25 , thus leading to a combination of a type  i seesaw with a type  iii seesaw @xcite .",
    "however , assuming the simplest higgs sector , the @xmath26 and @xmath27 are constrained by @xmath0 to give equal contributions to the neutrino mass matrix , up to an overall constant , resulting in a rank one neutrino mass matrix and only one non - zero neutrino mass .",
    "this problem may be addressed by allowing additional couplings to a higgs @xmath28 @xcite , but here we shall consider a different possibility .    in this letter",
    "we consider a susy @xmath0 gut with one single right - handed neutrino singlet superfield @xmath29 plus one adjoint matter superfield @xmath30 below the gut scale .",
    "the model combines a type  i seesaw mechanism from the single right - handed neutrino @xmath29 below the gut scale @xcite with a type  i plus type  iii seesaw mechanism from the @xmath26 and @xmath27 components contained in a single adjoint matter superfield @xmath30 below the gut scale @xcite .",
    "the seesaw mechanism in our model therefore results from three distinct diagrams as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : seesaw ] . in order to describe tb mixing",
    "we also include an @xmath1 family symmetry , plus an anomaly - free gauged @xmath31 symmetry . instead of using an adjoint higgs representation @xmath32 to spontaneously break @xmath0 to the sm gauge group , we shall assume implicitly that the gut group is broken by geometrical effects in extra dimensions . however the theory here",
    "is formulated in four dimensions and we simply assume that it could subsequently be uplifted to a higher dimensional setting ( as in , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "the absence of @xmath32 is crucial in forbidding the mixing between the right - handed neutrino @xmath29 and @xmath30 , leading to no mass mixing between @xmath29 and @xmath26 and hence a diagonal heavy majorana sector as required by constrained sequential dominance ( csd ) @xcite .",
    "the flavon vacuum alignments arise from the elegant @xmath33-term mechanism @xcite .",
    "the model also reproduces a realistic description of quark and charged lepton masses and quark mixings , including the georgi - jarlskog relations @xcite .",
    "the remainder of this letter is organised as follows . in section  [ sec : model0 ] we introduce the susy @xmath0 model with singlet plus adjoint matter below the gut scale .",
    "section  [ sec : model ] describes the full version of the model , including an @xmath1 family symmetry , a gauged @xmath31 symmetry plus two discrete @xmath34 symmetries , and lists the operators allowed by these symmetries , resulting in the mass matrices for quarks , charged leptons and neutrinos .",
    "we conclude in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "in this section we consider a susy @xmath0 gut with one single right - handed neutrino arising from a singlet representation @xmath29 below the gut scale plus one extra adjoint matter representation @xmath30 with mass also below the gut scale .",
    "the matter contained in the @xmath30 is degenerate thus avoiding problems with gauge coupling unification .",
    "the model represents a new way to achieve a hierarchical neutrino mass spectrum arising from a type  i plus type  iii seesaw mechanism , as we now discuss .",

    "the numerical factors of the two terms in parentheses are obtained by writing @xmath43 , where @xmath44 are the 24 components of the @xmath39 and @xmath45 are the 24 appropriately normalised generators of @xmath0 @xcite . as can be seen from eq .",

    "note also that @xmath49 and @xmath50 are independent dimensionless coefficients ( where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are family indices ) ; this independence is crucial to obtaining a rank two mass matrix and thus two non - zero neutrino masses",

    "( [ eqn : type3matrix ] ) does not in general conform to the tb structure of the neutrino mass matrix .",
    "it is the aim of this letter to obtain tb neutrino mixing as a consequence of a discrete family symmetry in this type of model . to this end , in the next section , we augment the adjoint susy @xmath0 model with the tetrahedral family symmetry @xmath1 .",

    "we work in the basis of @xcite in which two @xmath1 triplets @xmath54 and @xmath55 give a singlet through the combination @xmath56 .",
    "the basic idea is to unify the three families of @xmath57s into an @xmath1 triplet  @xmath58 , and in order for eq .   to remain invariant , to introduce extra @xmath1 triplets called flavons @xmath59 to break the @xmath1 symmetry and generate the yukawa couplings .",

    "as mentioned above , the three @xmath16s of @xmath0 are embedded in a triplet of @xmath1 , while the three @xmath17s are singlets .",

    "we have fundamental higgs fields @xmath18 and @xmath61 ; introducing another higgs in the @xmath62 representation , @xmath63 , enables the implementation of the georgi - jarlskog mechanism @xcite to obtain the well known gut scale mass relations @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",

    "however such terms could jeopardise the @xmath33-term alignment mechanism so here we prefer to gauge the @xmath31 to avoid any potential problems . ] in addition to the particle content specified in table  [ tab : indirect ] we must then introduce extra matter to cancel the respective gauge anomalies .",
    "the cubic @xmath0 anomaly requires the introduction of a higgs field @xmath70 whose @xmath31 charge is determined by the mixed @xmath71 anomaly to be @xmath72 .",
    "finally the cubic @xmath31 anomaly can be removed in many ways ; for example , choosing @xmath69 we can add three extra @xmath73 singlets with @xmath31 charges @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 . assuming that @xmath77 has the same @xmath34 charges as @xmath78 while the three extra @xmath73 singlets are neutral under both @xmath34 symmetries , we have checked that these additional fields lead to only negligible contributions to the fermion mass matrices discussed below , provided they get vevs of order @xmath79 or smaller , see eq .  .",
