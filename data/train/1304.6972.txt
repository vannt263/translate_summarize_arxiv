    "recent detailed analysis of the _",
    "fermi_-lat data has discovered two giant @xmath0-ray emission regions extending up to @xmath1 ( @xmath2 kpc ) in galactic latitude above and below the galactic center ( gc ) with a width of @xmath3 in longitude @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0-ray emission regions , now popularly known as the  fermi bubbles \" ( fbs ) , coincide well with the wmap haze at low latitudes @xcite , and share their edges with the rosat x - ray map @xcite .",
    "more recently , the _ planck _ satellite experiment have shown that the morphology of the fbs is highly consistent with that of the microwave haze @xcite , and also radio measurements have found that the bubbles are coincident with two giant radio lobes that appear to originate from the gc @xcite .",
    "this correlation between the multi - wavelength observations seem to suggest that the fb @xmath0-rays ( measured in the range of @xmath4 gev ) are produced by high - energy electrons via inverse compton scattering process , as the same electrons can also simultaneously produce synchrotron radiations in the presence of magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "moreover , the fact that the fbs are symmetric across the galactic plane and also centered on the gc encourages to assume the bubbles , and the associated @xmath0-ray emissions , to have their origin at the gc .",
    "however , because of severe radiative losses , it would be extremely difficult to transport high - energy electrons from the gc to the far edges of the bubbles . for electrons relevant for producing the fb @xmath0-rays , convection by galactic wind would require a wind speed as high as @xmath5 km s@xmath6 which is more than an order of magnitude larger than the typical galactic wind speed of @xmath7 km s@xmath6 , and diffusive transport would need a diffusion coefficient which is @xmath8 orders of magnitude larger than the standard galactic value .",
    "this problem can be overcome using models based on jet activity of the central active galactic nucleus where jet speeds of over @xmath9 km s@xmath6 is readily achievable @xcite .",
    "an alternative solution is to consider the production of electrons inside the bubbles itself , for instance , by multiple shock waves generated by periodic star capture by the central supermassive black hole @xcite or by second - order fermi acceleration by the plasma wave turbulence present inside the bubbles @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "hadronic models suffer less constraint at least from the particle injection point of view .",
    "@xcite showed that the fb @xmath0-rays can be explained if cosmic - ray ( cr ) nuclei from the gc are injected into the bubbles by fast winds , and if the particles remain trapped inside the bubbles for over @xmath10 yr . in almost all the models",
    "proposed so far ( see @xcite for more scenarios ) , an additional process of high - energy particle production , either inside or outside the bubbles , has been considered . in this letter , we present a simple model which does not invoke any additional sources or particle production processes other than those responsible for the production of bulk of the galactic crs .    in our model",
    ", it is assumed that crs ( mainly protons ) , after leaving their sources , undergo diffusive propagation through the galaxy .",
    "if the fbs are absent of sources , the diffusive streaming of crs in the direction of density gradient can result into a net flux of crs injected into the bubbles .",
    "in addition , if the bubbles are expanding , there can also be an additional cr injection that scales linearly with the expansion velocity of the bubbles .",
    "for uniform injection throughout the bubble surface , the total cr power injected into each bubble ( assuming spherical shape ) is given by @xmath11 , where @xmath12 represents the bubble radius , @xmath13 the streaming or injection velocity of crs , and @xmath14 the cr energy density .",
    "for crs streaming at alfvn speed , typically @xmath15 km s@xmath6 , we obtain @xmath16 ergs s@xmath6 for @xmath17 kpc and @xmath18 ev @xmath19 , the locally measured energy density .",
    "this amount of injected power is @xmath20 orders of magnitude larger than the power required in cr protons to produce the measured @xmath0-ray luminosity of @xmath21 erg s@xmath6 from each bubble .",
    "even if the cr density in the halo is lower by one order of magnitude with respect to the local value , this rough estimate shows that the injection of some fraction of galactic crs can easily account for the measured @xmath0-ray luminosity .    for crs with an equilibrium number density @xmath22 in the galaxy and propagating with diffusion coefficient @xmath23 ,",
    "their diffusive injection flux into the bubbles is given by @xmath24 , calculated at the edges of the bubbles .",
    "since @xmath25 is related to the cr source spectrum @xmath26 as @xmath27 , we get @xmath28 .",
    "thus , crs streaming diffusively into the bubbles will follow the same spectral shape as the source cr spectrum in the galaxy .",
    "once injected , crs undergo diffusive propagation inside the bubbles , while at the same time also convected radially outward by the expanding plasma . if the plasma inside the bubbles is extremely turbulent as suggested by x - ray observations of the galactic bulge @xcite or if the magnetic field lines are highly tangled @xcite , then the diffusion is expected to be much slower , and the cr transport will be dominated by the convection process .",
    "this will result into a cr distribution that peaks towards the bubble edges , in agreement with the observations @xcite .",
    "moreover , for an energy - independent diffusion ( which will be justified later ) , the cr spectrum inside the bubbles will follow the injection spectrum .",
    "this is important because for the hadronic origin , the @xmath0-ray spectrum should mimic that of the parent crs .",
    "the observed @xmath0-ray spectral index of @xmath29 above @xmath30 gev is quite close to the cr source index of @xmath31 required to produce the locally observed cr spectrum .    inside the bubbles , secondary electrons ( and positrons )",
    "can be continuously produced from inelastic collisions of cr protons with the bubble plasma .",
    "these electrons can produce synchrotron radiations , and can account for the observed radio and microwave emissions .",
    "the production spectrum of such electrons follows the proton spectrum , and has the same index as the source cr spectrum in the galaxy .",
    "if the electrons suffer continuous synchrotron losses , their spectrum at age @xmath32 of the bubbles will follow @xmath33 for @xmath34 , and @xmath35 for @xmath36 , where @xmath37 denotes the electron energy , and @xmath38 is the energy at which the energy - loss time equals @xmath32 . detailed analysis of the combined _",
    "planck_-wmap data in the frequency range of @xmath39 ghz have inferred that the electron spectral index in the region is @xmath40 @xcite . in the present model , this hard spectrum can be explained if the electrons responsible for the microwave emissions have energies less than @xmath41 .",
    "considering that the bubbles expand outward with constant velocity , the cr proton distribution inside a bubble can be described by a one - dimensional diffusion - loss equation written in the comoving frame of expansion : @xmath42 where @xmath43 represents the differential number density of particles with kinetic energy @xmath37 at time @xmath44 and position @xmath45 measured from the bubble boundary with @xmath46 @xmath47 representing the region inside ( outside ) the bubble , @xmath48 represents the diffusion coefficient inside the bubbles , and @xmath49 represents the cr inelastic collision time with the bubble plasma of density @xmath50 , @xmath51 the cr velocity , and @xmath52 the collision cross - section .",
    "energetic outflows such as unstable large - scale galactic winds in the inner region of the galaxy ( e.g. , @xcite ) can generate a turbulence wave spectrum inside the bubbles that follows @xmath53 in the short wavelength regime @xmath54 , where @xmath55 denotes the wave number and @xmath56 is the characteristic length of turbulence injection ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "then , for turbulence presumably injected at scales of several parsecs which is much larger than the gyro - radii of crs relevant for the present study , the cr diffusion coefficient is expected to be energy independent .",
    "we take @xmath57 @xmath58 s@xmath6 , where @xmath59 is a constant . moreover , since we are mainly interested on crs with energies above @xmath30 gev , we neglect the very weak energy dependence of @xmath52 @xcite , and take a constant value of @xmath60 mb .    for @xmath61 spectrum of particles injected at @xmath62 at time @xmath63 , the solution of eq .",
    "( 1 ) is obtained as , @xmath64\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the above solution does not include the adiabatic energy loss resulting from the spherical expansion of the bubble .",
    "this is taken into account as follows .",
    "the adiabatic energy loss rate is given by , @xmath65 therefore , particles with energy @xmath37 at the present time @xmath44 had energy @xmath66 at an earlier time @xmath63 , and distributed within an energy interval @xmath67 .",
    "then , the particle distribution in the presence of adiabatic losses can be obtained by replacing @xmath68 in eq .",
    "( 2 ) . and",
    "for continuous injection of particles with flux @xmath69 , the distribution at time @xmath44 is obtained by writing @xmath70 , and integrating eq .",
    "( 2 ) over @xmath63 as , @xmath71\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that in the present model , the injection flux @xmath72_{x=0}\\ ] ] where the first term represents the flux of galactic crs injected due to their diffusive motion in the galaxy @xmath73 , and the second term represents the injection flux due to the expansion of the bubble in the interstellar medium @xmath74 .",
    "finally , the solution in terms of the radial coordinate @xmath75 measured from the bubble center can be found by simply replacing @xmath45 with @xmath76 in eq .",
    "( 4 ) .    to estimate the injection fluxes , we write the galactic cr density in the pure diffusion model as function of perpendicular distance @xmath77 to the galactic plane as @xcite , @xmath78 where @xmath61 represents the source spectrum and @xmath23",
    "is the diffusion coefficient in the galaxy .",
    "the function @xmath79\\times   \\mathrm{j_1}(k\\re)dk}{\\sinh(kh)\\left[k\\coth(kh)+\\eta v\\sigma/(2d_\\mathrm{g})\\right]}\\ ] ] has a very weak energy dependence , where @xmath80 is the bessel function of order 1 , @xmath81 represents the halo boundary taken to be large enough to contain the fbs , @xmath82 kpc the radial size of the source distribution , and @xmath83 the averaged surface density of interstellar gas in the galactic plane . for @xmath84 kpc , we obtain @xmath85 based on the measured boron - to - carbon ratio , where @xmath86 @xmath58 s@xmath6",
    ".    then , the cr density gradient along @xmath77 follows , @xmath87 from eq .",
    "( 8) , it can be noticed that @xmath88 which shows that the diffusive injection flux @xmath73 follows the source cr spectrum as mentioned before . on the other hand , the injection flux due to",
    "the expansion @xmath74 follows the ambient cr spectrum , and hence is steeper than @xmath73 .    to calculated @xmath74",
    ", we estimate the expansion velocity of the bubble based on the combined _ planck_-wmap measurements . assuming that the electrons radiate at critical frequency , the highest measured frequency of @xmath89 ghz corresponds to an electron energy of @xmath90 gev for an estimated magnetic field strength of @xmath91 @xmath92 inside the bubbles .",
    "the latter is calculated at the position of the bubble center ( taken at @xmath93 kpc above the gc ) using the relation @xmath94",
    "@xmath92 used in the cr propagation code @xcite .",
    "the fact that _",
    "planck_-wmap data has not found any break or steepening in the spectrum up to @xmath89 ghz implies that the age of the bubbles must be less than the synchrotron loss time of @xmath90 gev electrons .",
    "this gives an upper limit of the bubble age at @xmath95 yr .",
    "for the present radius of @xmath17 kpc for the bubbles , the corresponding lower limit of the expansion velocity is obtained as @xmath96 km s@xmath6 . choosing a different scale height ,",
    "say @xmath97 kpc , will give a slightly larger magnetic field of @xmath98 @xmath99 inside the bubbles , lowering the upper limit of @xmath32 and increasing the lower limit of @xmath100 by factor of around 2 .",
    "these values of magnetic field are less than the estimated equipartition values of @xmath101 @xmath99 inside the bubbles @xcite , and @xmath102 @xmath99 of the bubble walls @xcite .",
    "the cr injection flux might vary for different positions , and also for different directions in the galaxy , but , for the present study , we neglect such variations and assume uniform injection over the entire bubble surface .",
    "we assume the injection flux to correspond to that at @xmath93 kpc as @xmath103_{z=5\\mathrm{kpc}}$ ] , where we have introduced a constant @xmath104 , hereafter referred to as the injection fraction , in order to take care of the unknown actual fraction of crs injected .",
    "its value will be determined based on the measured @xmath0-ray data . if the diffusion coefficient in the galaxy has a spatial dependence that scales inversely with the magnetic field , we can write @xmath105 @xmath58 s@xmath6 which gives a value of @xmath106 @xmath58 s@xmath6 at @xmath93 kpc .",
    "for this value of @xmath107 and @xmath96 km s@xmath6 obtained above , the injection flux is dominated by @xmath73 for cr energies above @xmath108 gev .",
    "for larger values of @xmath100 , @xmath74 will become significant especially at lower energies .",
    "this effect will be discussed later in section 3 .",
    "the cr source spectrum is chosen to be a broken power - law with @xmath109 and @xmath110 for energies below and above @xmath111 gev .",
    "for the assumed form of @xmath23 , this choice of spectral index reproduces well the proton spectrum recently measured by the atic @xcite , cream @xcite , and pamela @xcite experiments which exhibit a slight hardening above @xmath112 gev .      for the proton distribution @xmath113 , the @xmath0-ray emissivity @xmath114 of energy @xmath115",
    "is calculated using the inelastic interaction cross - section given by @xcite .",
    "then , the @xmath0-ray intensity in a given direction characterized by the galactic longitude @xmath116 and the latitude @xmath117 is calculated as @xmath118 where the integration is performed along the line of sight distance @xmath119 , and the integration limits are determined from the points of intersection of the line of sight with the bubble surface . in eq . ( 10 ) , the emissivity previously written as function of @xmath75 has been carefully expressed in terms of @xmath119 .",
    "at any given time , the cr distribution inside the bubbles is governed mainly by the competition between diffusion and convection .",
    "diffusion tends to uniform the distribution while convection ( and also , the other subdominant effects : inelastic collision and adiabatic losses ) does the opposite .",
    "thus , faster diffusion will produce more uniform distribution due to the increasing cr diffusion distance in the given time .",
    "this is shown in figure 1 where we have plotted the normalized distributions of @xmath120 gev crs inside a bubble for different values of @xmath48 taking @xmath121 .",
    "for the calculation ( and also , in the following ) , we take @xmath122 yr , @xmath96 km s@xmath6 , and @xmath123 @xmath19 .",
    "the latter is the averaged value in the region taken from @xcite that explains the diffuse soft x - ray emission .",
    "it can be seen that the distribution becomes flatter towards the bubble center with increasing @xmath59 .",
    "the distribution is expected to be similar at all energies because of the energy - independent nature of @xmath48 .",
    "once the values of @xmath44 , @xmath100 and @xmath50 are fixed , the cr distribution inside the bubbles is determined by the choice of @xmath48 . here",
    ", its value is chosen such that the resulting projected @xmath0-ray intensity distribution matches the measured profile .",
    "it is found that choosing @xmath124 produces a good fit to the measured data as shown in figure 2 , where the data corresponds to the southern bubble .",
    "the model predictions for both the averaged @xmath125 gev ( solid line ) and @xmath126 gev ( dashed line ) are added with backgrounds obtained by fitting horizontal lines to the respective data between @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "it can be mentioned that neither the hadronic model presented in @xcite nor the leptonic model based on diffusive shock acceleration @xcite can satisfactorily explain the measured sharp edges shown in figure 2 .",
    "both these models predicted a constant volume emissivity throughout the bubbles which will produce softer edges on the projected profile .",
    "also shown in figure 2 are the predictions for @xmath129 gev ( dotted line ) and @xmath130 gev ( dot - dashed line ) @xmath0-rays which can be tested in future .",
    "as expected , their profiles look very similar to those at low energies .",
    "our result at high energies , say at @xmath130 gev , is clearly different from that expected from the leptonic stochastic acceleration model presented in @xcite which predicted a significant edge brightening at high energies .",
    "+    the @xmath0-ray spectrum averaged over a whole bubble is shown in figure 3 ( top ) .",
    "the calculation assumes an injection fraction of @xmath131 which is also the same injection value used in figure 2 .",
    "the model prediction is found to be in good agreement with the data in the energy range of @xmath4 gev where the measurement uncertainties are small .",
    "it is interesting to see that the same source index required to explain the measured cr spectrum in the pure diffusion model also reproduces the fb @xmath0-ray spectrum",
    ". this would be difficult if one uses the re - acceleration model of cr propagation which requires a steeper source index of @xmath132 .",
    "spectra for the inner and outer regions of a bubble separated as in @xcite are shown in figure 3 ( bottom ) .",
    "the outer region is taken as a shell with thickness @xmath108 kpc .",
    "our model predictions are in good agreement with the measured data between @xmath4 gev , and reproduce the measured spectral uniformity in the two regions .",
    "even the slightly higher intensity measured in the outer region seems to be explained .",
    "+    the results presented above consider the lower limit of expansion velocity inferred from the combined _ planck_-wmap data .",
    "choosing higher expansion velocity will increase the contribution of @xmath74 , thereby making the total injection spectrum steeper .",
    "this will result into a steeper @xmath0-ray spectrum .",
    "this is shown in figure 4 ( top ) for different velocities in the range of @xmath133 km s@xmath6 , where the spectra are normalized to that of @xmath96 km s@xmath6 at @xmath120 gev .",
    "it can be noticed that the model spectrum becomes steeper as @xmath100 increases .",
    "this is shown explicitly in figure 4 ( bottom ) , where the spectral indices for the different results are plotted as function of @xmath100 .",
    "the indices ( represented by points ) are obtained by fitting the model spectra between @xmath134 gev .",
    "the solid line together with the shaded region represents the measured index of @xmath135 obtained by fitting the measured spectrum in the same energy range .",
    "it can be noticed that already at @xmath136 km s@xmath6 , the model prediction becomes inconsistent with the measured index .",
    "this sets an upper limit on the expansion velocity at @xmath137 km s@xmath6 , which translates into a lower limit of the bubble age at @xmath138 yr .",
    "consequently , this implies a synchrotron break in the electron spectrum at energy below @xmath139 gev , and also a corresponding break in the synchrotron emission spectrum at frequency below @xmath140 ghz which can be checked by future measurements .    for typical sound speed of @xmath15 km s@xmath6 ( for gas temperature of @xmath141 k ) in the galactic halo ,",
    "the limit of @xmath137 km s@xmath6 implies a mach number @xmath142 , even less at @xmath143 if the cr pressure is also taken into account .",
    "such weak shocks are known to be rather inefficient for particle acceleration , justifying our neglect of cr acceleration by the expanding bubbles .",
    "moreover , for a galactic gravitational acceleration value of @xmath144 cm s@xmath145 in the halo @xcite , this upper limit of @xmath100 gives an extend of the plasma flow to @xmath146 kpc , roughly the size of the fbs .",
    "in addition , the present values of @xmath50 and @xmath147 for the bubbles give an alfvn speed of @xmath148 km s@xmath6 which corresponds to a plasma beta value of @xmath149 , indicating a low magnetic pressure bubbles .",
    "we have shown that the @xmath0-rays from the fermi bubbles can be a result of diffusive injection of galactic cr protons during their propagation through the galaxy .",
    "some important observed properties of the bubbles are explained . unlike other existing models",
    ", our proposed model does not consider any additional particle production processes or sources other than those responsible for the production of galactic crs .",
