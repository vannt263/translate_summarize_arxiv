    "we illustrate our technique by designing multimode waveguide bends @xcite and mode squeezers @xcite , then measuring their performance with finite element method ( fem ) simulations .",
    "most designs in transformation optics use either hand - chosen transformations @xcite ( which often require nearly unattainable anisotropic materials ) , or quasiconformal and conformal maps @xcite which can automatically generate nearly - isotropic transformations ( either by solving partial differential equations or by using grid generation techniques ) but still require _ a priori _ specification of the entire boundary shape of the transformation .",

    "first , the use of optimization allows us to incorporate arbitrary fabrication constraints while at the same time searching the correct space of transformations without unnecessarily underconstraining or overconstraining the problem .",
    "second , instead of solving maxwell s equations , we require only simple derivatives to be computed at each optimization step . this is because transformation optics works by using a coordinate transformation  @xmath1 that warps light in a desired way ( e.g. mapping a straight waveguide to a bend , or mapping an object to a point or the ground for cloaking applications @xcite ) and then employing transformed materials which are given in terms of the jacobian  @xmath2 to mathematically mimic the effect of the coordinate transformation .",
    "this transforms all solutions of maxwell s equations in the same way ( as opposed to non - to multimode devices which often have limited bandwidth and/or do not preserve relative phase between modes @xcite ) , and is therefore particularly attractive for designing multimode optical devices @xcite ( such as mode squeezers , expanders , splitters , couplers , and multimode bends ) with no intermodal scattering .",

    "one major difficulty with transformation optics is that most functions  @xmath1 yield highly anisotropic and magnetic materials . in principle",
    ", these transformed designs can be fabricated with anisotropic microstructures @xcite or naturally birefringent materials @xcite . however , in the infrared regime ( where metals are lossy ) it is far easier to instead fabricate effectively isotropic dielectric materials , provided that the refractive index falls within the given bounds  @xmath3 and @xmath4 of the fabrication process ( for example , subwavelength nanostructures @xcite or waveguides with variable thickness @xcite ) .",
    "this requirement means that we would prefer to consider the subset of transformations that can be mapped to approximately isotropic dielectric materials .",
    "the theory of transformation optics with nearly isotropic materials is intimately connected to the subjects of conformal maps ( which are isotropic by definition @xcite ) and _ quasiconformal maps _ [ which in mathematical analysis are defined as _ any _ orientation - preserving transformation with bounded anisotropy ( as quantified in sec .",

    "[ sub : nearly - isotropic - transformations ] that slipping boundary conditions are not the correct choice if one wishes to ensure a reflectionless interface between transformed and untransformed regions .",

    "li and pendry s method , along with other work on extremal quasiconformal maps in mathematical analysis , assumed that the entire boundary _ shape _ of the transformed domain is specified _ a priori _ ( even if the _ value _ of the transformation at the boundary is not specified ) .",

    "conformal maps are described by analytic functions , which are of the form @xmath40 ( where @xmath41 is the untransformed complex coordinate ) and whose real and imaginary parts satisfy the cauchy  riemann equations of complex analysis @xcite .    however",
    ", true conformal maps can not directly be used for transformation optics in typical applications , because of the impossibility of coupling them to untransformed regions with the boundary conditions discussed in sec .  [",

    "in particular , the uniqueness theorem of analytic functions ( * ? ? ? * thm .  10.39 )",

    "the isotropy of @xmath25 then forces @xmath45 .",
    "therefore , in the sections that follow ( where we search for _ approximately _ isotropic maps ) , we will impose the condition of continuous @xmath6 as a boundary condition on our transformations .",
    "the resulting transformations are nearly isotropic in the interior and exactly isotropic on the interfaces .",
    "this condition , discussed at the end of sec .",
    "[ sub : scalarization - errors - for ] , also has the useful consequence of producing a continuous refractive index  @xmath46 .",
    "because true conformal maps can not be used , one widely used alternative is to search for a nearly _ _ isotropic transformation , which can be _ approximated _ by an isotropic material at the cost of some scattering corrections to the exactly transformed modes of the nearly isotropic material . to do this",

    "a general transformation is an arbitrary function of @xmath50 and @xmath51 or , equivalently , an arbitrary function @xmath52 , of @xmath53 and @xmath54 , which may not be analytic in @xmath53 .",

    "as mentioned in the introduction , an _ extremal _",
    "quasiconformal map is one that minimizes the peak anisotropy , given the shape of the transformed region and the values of the transformation on some or all of the boundary @xcite . because @xmath62 , @xmath65 , @xmath57 , and @xmath66 are all monotonic functions of one another , they are equivalent for the purpose of finding an extremal quasiconformal map . however , @xmath62 is numerically convenient because it is a differentiable function of the entries of @xmath6 .",
    "these quantities are _ not _ generally equivalent for minimizing the _ mean _ anisotropy @xcite , and we argue in sec .",
    "[ sub : minmax ] that the peak anisotropy is a better figure of merit .",
    "however , in the special case where the value of the transformation is only fixed at the _ corners _ of the domain and is allowed to vary freely in between ( a `` slipping'' boundary condition ) , li and pendry showed that it is equivalent to minimize the mean ( either winslow or modified - liao ) or the peak anisotropy , and that these yield a constant - anisotropy map ( a uniform scaling of a conformal map ) @xcite that they and other authors have used for transformation optics @xcite .",
    "however , the slipping boundary will generally lead to reflections at the interface between the transformed and untransformed regions because of the resulting discontinuity in the transformation , which can only be reduced by making the transformation domain very large in cases ( e.g. cloaking ) with localized deformations . in order to design compact transformation - optics devices , especially for applications such as bends where the deformation is nonlocalized",
    ", we will instead impose continuity of the transformation and/or its jacobian on the input / output facets of the domain , while at the same time allowing the shape of some or all of the boundary to vary ( unlike all previous work on quasiconformal maps , to our knowledge ) .",

    "a similar analysis explains why we must explicitly impose continuity of @xmath6 at the input / output facets of the domain . as explained in sec .",
    "[ sub : conformal - maps ] , a purely isotropic transformation in the neighborhood of the interface , along with a continuity of @xmath5 , would automatically yield continuous @xmath6 , so one might hope that minimizing anisotropy would suffice to obtain a nearly continuous @xmath6 .",
    "unfortunately , as we show in the appendix , the resulting discontinuity in @xmath85 ( and hence the discontinuity in the refractive index ) is of order @xmath86 , which would lead to @xmath87 power loss due to reflections , much larger than the @xmath88 $ ] power scattering from anisotropy in the interior .",
    "this would make it pointless to minimize the anisotropy in the interior , since the boundary reflections would dominate .",

    "( another possible heuristic is `` successive refinement '' @xcite , in which optima for smaller @xmath202 are used as starting points for optimizing using larger @xmath202 . )",
    "we also applied transformation inverse design to another interesting geometry : a mode squeezer that concentrates modes and their power in a small region in space , again with minimal intermodal scattering ( quite unlike a conventional lens , which is intrinsically angle / mode - dependent ) , similar to the problem considered in @xcite ( which did not construct isotropic designs ) .",

    ", we could either minimize @xmath62 for a fixed @xmath209 or minimize @xmath209 for a fixed @xmath62 , and we happened to choose the latter .    ]    finite - element maxwell simulations , shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : squeezer ] , demonstrate that the optimized design is greatly superior to a simple gaussian taper transformation designed by hand .",
    "the gaussian transformation was given by @xmath210 $ ] , where @xmath211 and @xmath212 .",
    "superficially , the design seems similar to an `` adiabatic '' taper between a wide low - index waveguide and a narrow high - index waveguide , and it is known that any sufficiently gradual taper of this form would have low scattering due to the adiabatic theorem@xcite .",
    "however , the optimized to design is much too short to be in this adiabatic regime .",
    "if it were in the adiabatic regime , then taking the same design and simply stretching the index profile to be more gradual ( a taper twice as long ) would reduce the scattering , but in fig .",
    "[ fig : squeezer ] we perform precisely this experiment and find that the stretched design _ increases _ the scattering .",
    "the analytical simplicity of to design  no maxwell equations need be solved in order to warp light in a prescribed way  paradoxically makes the application of computational techniques more attractive in order to discover the best transformation by rapidly searching a large space of possibilities .",
    "previous work on to design used optimization to some extent , but overconstrained the transformation by fixing the boundary shape while underconstraining the boundary conditions required for reflectionless interfaces .",
    "in fact , even our present work imposes more constraints than are strictly necessary  as long as we require continuous @xmath6 at the input / output interfaces , there is no conceptual reason why those interfaces need be flat . a better bend , for example , might be designed by constraining the location of only two corners ( to fix the bend radius ) and constraining only @xmath6 on other parts of the endfacets .",
    "however , we already achieve an exponential tradeoff between radius and anisotropy , so we suspect that further relaxing the constraints would only gain a small constant factor rather than yielding an asymptotically faster tradeoff . in the case of the mode squeezer , one could certainly achieve better results by imposing the proper @xmath6 constraints at the endfacets",
    ". it would also be interesting to apply similar techniques to ground - plane cloaking .",
    "all to techniques suffer from some limitations that should be kept in mind .",
    "first , to seems poorly suited for optical devices in which one _ wants _ to discriminate between modes ( e.g. a modal filter ) or to scatter light between modes ( e.g. a mode transformer ) .",
    "to is ideal for devices in which it is desirable that all modes be transported equally , with no scattering .",
    "even for the latter case ( such as our multimode bend ) , however , to designs almost certainly trade off computational convenience for optimality , because they impose a stronger constraint than is strictly required : to is restricted to designs where the solutions at _ all points _ in the design are coordinate transformations of the original system , whereas most devices are only concerned with the solutions at the endfacets . for example , it is conceivable that a more compact multimode bend could be designed by allowing intermodal scattering _ within _ the bend as long as the modes scatter back to their original configurations by the endfacet ; the interior of the bend might not even be a waveguide , and instead might be a resonant cavity of some sort@xcite .",
    "however , optimizing over such structures seems to require solving maxwell s equations in some form at each optimization step , which is far more computationally expensive than the to design and , unlike the to design , must be repeated for different wavelengths and waveguide designs .",
    "in this appendix , we briefly derive the fact , mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sub : scalarization - errors - for ] , that the endfacet discontinuity scales much worse with anisotropy than the scalarization errors in the transformation interior , which leads us to impose an explicit continuity constraint on the jacobian @xmath6 .",
    "in particular , we examine the jacobian @xmath6 for nearly isotropic transformations ( @xmath213 ) that also have @xmath19 explicitly constrained at the interfaces .",
    "( the following analysis can also be straightfowardly extended to situations where @xmath5 is a simple rotation of @xmath147 on the interface , or where the interface has an arbitrary shape . ) in this case , the jacobian is @xmath214 where @xmath215 and @xmath216 are small quantities ( @xmath217 ) if @xmath25 is nearly isotropic . the anisotropy eq .",
    "( [ eq : kminusone ] ) is then : @xmath218 the determinant then satisfies @xmath219 this square - root dependence is also reflected in the refractive index  @xmath46 and leads to @xmath87 power loss due to interface reflections that overwhelm the @xmath88 $ ] corrections to scattered power due to the scalarization of nearly isotropic transformations ( as explained in sec .",
    "[ sub : scalarization - errors - for ] ) .",
    "hence , it becomes necessary to explicitly constrain @xmath45 _ in addition _ to @xmath19 .",
