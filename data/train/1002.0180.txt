    "one of the most serious problems in modern physics is the quantization of strongly interacting quantum fields .",
    "this includes the confinement problem in quantum chromodynamics , quantization of gravitation , and probably also high temperature superconductivity with its strong interaction between cooper electrons .",
    "the problem is that the algebra of quantum operators describing strongly interacting fields is unknown .",
    "known commutation relationships of type @xmath0 = i \\delta(x - y)\\ ] ] describe ( here @xmath1 is the operator of a free field @xmath2 ) .",
    "the need for nonperturbative techniques in strongly interacting , nonlinear quantum field theories is an old problem that has been around since the beginning of the study of quantum fields .",
    "much effort has gone into trying to resolve this puzzle .",
    "the different approaches that have been tried include : ( i ) lattice qcd @xcite , ( ii ) the dual meissner effect in the qcd - vacuum @xcite-@xcite , ( iii ) instantons @xcite @xcite , ( iv ) path integration @xcite , ( v ) analytic calculations @xcite , ( vi ) dyson - schwinger equations @xcite . despite this ,",
    "the problem is not yet fully resolved .",
    "all these approaches are approximations ones .    in the 1950 s ,",
    "heisenberg @xcite @xcite studied a nonlinear spinor field and developed nonperturbative techniques for quantizing the nonlinear spinor field .",
    "his method assumes an infinite system of equations which relate all the n - point green s functions of the theory ( this can be compared to the infinite number of feynman diagrams which must , in principle , be calculated for a given process in pertubative quantum field theory ) . in order to solve this system of equations ,",
    "one must find some physically reasonable cut - off approximations , so that one reduces the infinite system of equations into a finite system .",
    "nevertheless , the algebra of field operators in heisenberg s approach remains unknown .    in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that radiative corrections could introduce a symmetry breaking ( _ i.e. _ negative ) mass term into a scalar lagrangian .",
    "this effect is called dimensional transmutation .",
    "similar reasonings in ref . @xcite",
    "give rise to that the logarithmic nonlinearity in the quantum wave equation can cause the spontaneous symmetry breaking and mass generation phenomena .",
    "one can presuppose that a of any strongly interacting fields would yield similar terms . in ref .",
    "@xcite it is offered to quantize strongly interacting fields using nonassociative ( n / a ) decomposition of the field into products of n / a factors . in such approach the rearrangement of brackets gives rise to additional terms in the same way as the permutation of field operators ( in standard quantum field theory ) gives rise to the planck constant .",
    "in this section we follow to ref .",
    "we assume that operators of strongly interacting fields @xmath3 can be decomposed into n / a constituents @xmath4 and @xmath5 : @xmath6 here @xmath7 is an index where internal and lorentzian indices are collected , @xmath8 is the summation index , and the @xmath9 , @xmath10 are contained in @xmath7 as : @xmath11 .",
    "although the constituent operators @xmath12 are not associative , the basic idea requires their product to model an associative operator . in more mathematical terms , the operators @xmath4 and @xmath13 are elements in a n / a algebra @xmath14 , i.e. , @xmath15 , which contains an associative subalgebra @xmath16 , such that @xmath17 .",
    "it is necessary to note that the operator @xmath18 models observable quantities , whereas the n / a @xmath12 are unobservable .",
    "let us note that the number of n / a constituents does not need to be two , but may be more .",
    "for example eq . can be rewritten in the form @xmath19 here @xmath20 are the summation indices , and the @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath21 are contained in @xmath7 as : @xmath22 .",
    "one can say that the decompositions and somewhat correspond to slave - boson @xcite and spin - charge ( or quark - like ) @xcite decompositions .",
    "in this section we would like to consider a few examples : scalar field theory with polynomial @xmath23 , pure gravity , and gravity interacting with electromagnetic field .",
    "let us consider scalar field theory with lagrangian @xmath24 where the nonlinear potential term is @xmath25 we assume a n / a decomposition @xmath26 . here",
    ", the operator @xmath27 is an observable associative quantity , but @xmath28 are unobservable n / a quantities . using n / a factors one can rewrite the potential term from lagrangian as follows @xmath29 in order to calculate an expectation value we have to define the action of operators on a quantum state .",
    "we will require : @xmath30 this is the same rule as for the associative case .",
    "but when having two or more nonassociative operators , there is : @xmath31 where the associator ass is defined as follows @xmath32 in order to define the associator , @xmath33 , we recall that in the standard commutations relationship on the lhs we have two operators ( observables ) and on the rhs we have @xmath34 operators . in a similar way , we assume that on the rhs of should be @xmath34 operators .",
    "it means that @xmath35 where @xmath7 can be a complex number .",
    "one can say that it is the second planck constant but with different dimension .",
    "the same can be done for @xmath36 @xmath37 and for @xmath38 @xmath39 then the expectation value will be @xmath40 ordinarily , the vacuum expectation value @xmath41 of a field is zero . consequently , in the case where @xmath42 is a vacuum state , there is @xmath43 it means that the n / a terms appear with the potential @xmath44 only .",
    "thus the conclusion for this section is that      general relativity is the most nonlinear theory we know .",
    "consequently nonperturbative effects must be very important in quantum gravity .",
    "in general relativity the first nonlinearity is connected with a connection @xmath45 compatible with a metric @xmath46 which is called as christoffel symbols .",
    "the nonlinearity is created by the quantity @xmath47 which is the matrix reciprocal to the matrix @xmath48 .",
    "such nonlinearity is much stronger than the potential term in usual quantum field theory .",
    "how @xmath49 can be described as an operator in nonperturbative quantization is unclear . in this section",
    "we denote operators as @xmath50 .",
    "nevertheless , we continue to carry out the idea about appearance of additional terms from calculation of an expectational value . for the christoffel symbols in this case",
    "we will have @xmath51 here @xmath52 is quantum averaging ; @xmath53 is the symmetric part of the affine connection @xmath54 ; @xmath55}^{\\phantom{\\beta \\gamma } \\alpha}$ ] is the antisymmetric part of @xmath54 and describes the deviation quantum christoffel symbols @xmath56 from the classical @xmath57 ; @xmath54 is the designation for @xmath56 .",
    "the interesting question here is : why quantum averaging of the symmetric affine connection @xmath57 leads to a non - symmetric affine connection @xmath54 ?",
    "in our opinion it happens because the wave functional @xmath58 is non - symmetric one .",
    "for the first approximation we assume that @xmath59 in this case the quantum averaged ricci tensor is @xmath60 it means that we can think about the quantum averaged ricci tensor @xmath61 as about the ricci tensor @xmath62 with a connection @xmath54 which is not - compatible with the metric @xmath63 .",
    "let us remember some notions from the differential geometry .",
    "in general the affine connection @xmath64 can be written as @xmath65 where @xmath45 are the usual christoffel symbols of the symmetric connection and the contortion tensor @xmath66 is called the contorsion tensor and is given in terms of the torsion tensor by @xmath67}^{\\phantom { [ \\mu \\nu ] } \\rho } & = & - \\frac{1}{2 }       t_{\\mu \\nu}^{\\phantom{\\mu \\nu}\\rho } , \\\\ \\label{4 - 80 }      k_{\\mu \\nu \\rho } & = & - k_{\\mu \\rho \\nu}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here the torsion tensor @xmath68 is the antisymmetric part of the affine connection coefficients @xmath69 .",
    "@xmath70}^{\\phantom { [ \\mu \\nu ] } \\rho}\\ ] ] according to and definitions  we can say that the connection in classical general relativity ( christoffel symbols ) after nonperturbative quantization acquires an additional contribution in the form of torsion .",
    "as well one can say that the torsion appears in quantum gravity as the result of nonperturbative quantization .",
    "above we have shown that by nonperturbative quantization of gravity the torsion appears as a quantum correction to christoffel symbols .",
    "it means that the einstein ",
    "cartan gravity is the first approximation for quantum gravity . in classical and perturbative quantum electrodynamics",
    "there is a big problem with an infinite energy of static electric field created by a point charge .",
    "one hope is that quantum gravity resolves this problem .      in this subsection",
    "we would like to show that above mentioned quantum corrections smooth this problem .",
    "these corrections should be taking into account on a small distance only .",
    "for simplicity , we consider a metric with torsion only ( but otherwise flat ) .",
    "we can then consider maxwell electrodynamics in minkowski spacetime ( following to ref .",
    "@xcite we use @xmath71 signature here and in the next subsection ) .",
    "the lagrangian in this case is @xmath72 where @xmath73 here @xmath74 is 4-potential of the electromagnetic field and @xmath75 is corresponding tensor of electromagnetic field for the affine connection @xmath76 .",
    "let us note that the electromagnetic tensor is not gauge invariant in the consequence of the torsion term @xmath77 .",
    "maxwell equations can be written in the form @xcite",
    "@xmath78 \\rho } a^\\rho }      { 1 + \\frac{g}{c^4 } a_\\mu a^\\mu } \\\\",
    "\\label{4 - 1 - 40 }      j^\\nu & = & - \\frac{g}{4 \\pi c^3 } f^{\\mu \\nu}\\left ( \\gamma \\right )       f_{\\mu \\rho}\\left ( \\gamma \\right ) a^\\rho \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath79 and @xmath80 is newton constant . allowing quantum corrections from torsion , we now consider an electrostatic spherically symmetric solution with 4-potential @xmath81 then eq . has the form @xmath82 the spherical solution is @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the electric charge .",
    "interestringly , the electric field @xmath85 and charge density @xmath86 are nonsingular at the origin",
    "@xmath87 however , the total energy of the field becomes infinite : @xmath88 while the integral @xmath89 is finite , the total energy becomes infinite due to the self - interaction term @xmath90 .",
    "evidently , the coupling between electrodynamics and gravity is nonlinear .",
    "consequently , one can hope that including nonperturbative corrections for the electromagnetic field connected with gravity will give rise to a finite energy of the electric field of a point charge .",
    "quantum corrections coming from the interaction between electromagnetic and gravitational fields are unknown in the case of very strong nonlinear gravitoelectric coupling .",
    "we assume that the corrections can be written as @xmath91 in following form in maxwell equations @xmath92 where @xmath93 are quantum nonperturbative corrections for the electromagnetic potential in the consequence of nonlinear system : gravity + electromagnetism .",
    "these corrections can not be calculated in general , but for some @xmath93 there exist solutions .",
    "we now assume quantum corrections of the form @xmath94 .",
    "for the spherically symmetric 4-potential maxwell equation is @xmath95\\ ] ] where @xmath96 $ ] ; @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "we are searching for the regular solution at the origin .",
    "consequently the boundary conditions are @xmath99 we doubt that there exists an analytical solution of eq .. therefore we are searching for a numerical solution .",
    "the numerical investigation shows that a special regular solution @xmath100 does exist for some special choice of @xmath101 only .",
    "the results of numerical solution of eq . in fig s [ eta ] - [ rho ] are presented .",
    "since the solution is special , this makes mass , charge , and other physical properties of such an electric charge unique .",
    "the question stated in the title of this section is analogous to standard quantum theory : how can one measure of operators ? for the standard quantum theory , the answer is : the planck constant measures the noncommutativity of conjugated operators .    in this paper",
    ", we proposed an approach to the nonperturbative quantization through nonassociative decomposition of quantum field operators . during a lunch with geoffrey dixon ,",
    "tevian dray , john huerta , jens kplinger and shahn majid ( on 2@xmath102 mile high conference on nonassociative mathematics , denver , colorado , usa ) the question came up , on how one could measure nonassociativity in physics ?",
    "we have considered two examples : ( 1 ) polynomial potential in section [ scalar ] ; ( 2 ) gravity in [ gravity ] .",
    "the calculations presented in [ scalar ] for the scalar fields can be extended to any field theory having a polynomial potential term ( for example , for a gauge theory ) . in gauge theory",
    "the lagrangian is @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the field strength ; @xmath105 is the gauge potential ; @xmath106 are the su(n ) color indices ; @xmath107 is the coupling constant ; @xmath108 are the structure constants for the su(n ) gauge group .",
    "the lagrangian has the term @xmath109 which is similar to the scalar potential @xmath23 .",
    "reasoning similar to section [ scalar ] leads to appearance of an additional mass term @xmath110 .",
    "such mass term controls the radius of the interaction @xmath111 .",
    "it means that the nonassociativity manifests itself as the radius of the interaction @xmath112 .",
    "the appearance of the mass term @xmath110 signifies breaking of gauge invariance .",
    "quantum chromodynamics is a field theory with strong interaction , for which above arguments are applicable .",
    "the radius @xmath112 can be considered as a radius of a flux tube filled with a chromoelectric field and stretched between quark - antiquark .",
    "thus n / a parameter @xmath113 can be measured in principle .    in section [ gravity ]",
    "we have considered quantum corrections for gravity .",
    "exact calculations can not be done in this case because we do not know the exact form of the nonperturbative operators @xmath114 , @xmath115 , and so on .",
    "we have proposed the torsion as a quantum correction from the christoffel symbols . in subsection",
    "[ ed_gravity_1]1 we have shown that such corrections lead to smoothing of singularities , together with infinite total field energy of a point charge . in subsection [ ed_gravity_2 ]",
    "we have considered the nonlinear system of gravity + electrodynamics . in such system",
    "we also can not calculate quantum corrections .",
    "but we have shown that if the quantum correction has some definite form then all infinities in point charge disappear .    in summarizing ,",
    "nonassociative quantum corrections can be measured :    * in nonperturbative quantum field theory , nonperturbative ( nonassociative ) quantum corrections can be measured as a radius of corresponding forces . * in gauge theories with big enough coupling constant , the nonassociativity gives rise to breaking of gauge invariance and formation of nonlocal objects ( flux tubes ) with characteristic length reciprocal to n / a parameter @xmath7 .",
    "* in pure gravity , n / a quantum corrections appear in affine connections as torsion .",
    "it can in principle be measured , but probably only on very small ( planck ) distances . * in gravity + electromagnetism , system n /",
    "a quantum corrections probably gives rise to smoothing of all singularities connected with a point charge .",
    "it leads to the possibility to modeling of a zero - spin charged particles .",
    "here we have considered nonperturbative quantization procedures based on nonassociative decomposition of quantum field operators , into nonassociative constituents .",
    "we have seen that such approach gives rise to quantum corrections , by calculation of expectation values of field operators on nonlinear functions . in a scalar field theory ; @xmath109 in a gauge theory , christoffel symbols in gravity ] we have shown that these corrections can in principle be measured as a radius of a force , characteristic length of nonlocal objects , and the failure of connection compatibility with metric . also in such way one can regularize singularities of a point - like charge .",
    "let us note that in ref .",
    "@xcite similar idea was considered .",
    "it has been shown that in non - linear electrodynamics in the framework of general relativity there exist `` weakly singular '' configurations such that ( i ) the proper mass is finite in spite of divergences of the energy density , ( ii ) all field and energy distributions are concentrated in the core region .    in section [ ed_gravity_2 ]",
    "we have shown that quantum corrections having a false vacuum and two true vacuums gives rise to regular solution describing a regular charge distribution .",
    "the corrections considered allow us to assume that such peculiarity will be retained for nonperturbative quantum corrections similar to a mexican hat potential .    according to the torsion",
    "is controlled by the factor @xmath116 . if @xmath117 then quantum corrections can be neglected .",
    "otherwise , the corrections join the solutions for electric coulomb fields .",
    "such construction may model an isolated electric charge in minkowski spacetime .",
    "quantum mechanics manifests itself through appearance of the planck constant @xmath118 . in this paper",
    ", we showed that nonassociativity may exhibit a constant in quantum field theory , @xmath119 ; or otherwise become evident as a geometric property in quantum gravity , torsion .",
    "further investigation is be needed to clarify these relations .",
