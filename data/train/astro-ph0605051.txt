    "for x - ray binaries ( xrbs ) , the radio band has always been a privileged window for studies of relativistic jets .",
    "this is because , neither the companion star nor the accretion disc emits significant radiation at very long wavelengths and the synchrotron emission from the jet dominates .",
    "the radio power in xrbs is observed to be strictly related to the x - ray emission ( see fender 2006 for a review ) . in black hole",
    "( bh ) xrbs , the hard state is associated with a radio active state ( fender 2001 ) , while in the thermal dominant state the radio emission is quenched ( fender et al .",
    "1999 ; see e.g. mcclintock & remillard 2006 for a definition of the x - ray spectral states ) .",
    "the radio emission in hard state bhs is characterised by an optically thick synchrotron radio spectrum ( i.e. @xmath6 where @xmath2 and @xmath7 is the flux density at a frequency @xmath8 ; e.g. fender 2001 ) .",
    "this optically thick synchrotron emission is interpreted as a spectral signature of conical continuously replenished , self - absorbed compact jets ( blandford & knigl 1979 ; hjellming & johnston 1988 ; kaiser 2006 ) .",
    "this interpretation has been confirmed by radio imaging of the milli - arcsecond scale jets , for two bh xrbs : cyg x-1 ( stirling et al .",
    "2001 ) and grs  1915 + 105 ( although not in a canonical hard state ; e.g. dhawan , mirabel & rodrguez 1999 ) . at shorter wavelengths ,",
    "compact jet models predict a ` break ' from an optically thick to an optically thin ( e.g. @xmath9 ) synchrotron spectrum .",
    "the optically thin spectrum represents the emission from the part of the jet that is closer to the base and not self - absorbed . in only two bh xrbs ,",
    "near - infrared observations have directly shown this part of the spectrum : gx  339 - 4 ( corbel & fender 2002 ; see also nowak et al .",
    "2005 ) and xte j1118 + 480 ( hynes et al .",
    "for other bhs , the optically thick synchrotron spectrum ranges from the radio band to the infrared ( ir ) and possibly even beyond and the emission of the disc and/or the companion star precludes a direct observation of the optically thin part ( e.g. fender 2001 ; hynes et al .",
    "2000 ; corbel et al .",
    "note that the actual frequency at which the break occurs , i.e. the ` knee ' , has not been directly observed yet ( except possibly in gx  339 - 4 ; corbel & fender 2002 ) , but only in some cases inferred by fits with broken power laws ( see nowak et al . 2005 ) .",
    "the detection of the optically thin part of the synchrotron spectrum is fundamental in order to determine the total power carried by the jet .",
    "atoll neutron star ( ns ) xrbs are a class of low - magnetic field ns systems accreting at relatively low rates , which show two distinct x - ray states , ` island ' and ` banana ' states , directly comparable , respectively , to the hard and thermal dominant states of bhs ( see hasinger & van der klis 1989 ; van der klis 2006 for a review ) .",
    "atolls in their hard state show radio emission that is about a factor of 30 lower than that of bh xrbs at the same observed x - ray luminosity ( migliari et al .",
    "2003 ; see fender & hendry 2000 ; migliari & fender 2006 ) . however , although brightness temperature arguments indicate that the radio emission comes from out - flowing matter , given the lower signal - to - noise ratio of the radio detections of atoll sources , we do not have yet unambiguous observational constrains on the spectral index of their radio spectrum ( see e.g. fender 2006 ; migliari & fender 2006 ) .",
    "three low - luminosity nss , the accreting millisecond x - ray pulsars sax  j1808.4 - 3658 , xte  j0929 - 314 and xte  j1814 - 338 , show an optical / near - ir excess that can be explained by a non - thermal contribution from a jet ( wang et al .",
    "2001 ; giles et al . 2005",
    "; krauss et al . 2005 ) .",
    "the source 4u  0614 + 091 is an ultra - compact ns xrb , with a carbon - oxygen white dwarf donor ( juett , psaltis & chakrabarty 2001 ; nelemans et al .",
    "it has been classified as an atoll source and has been observed to be almost persistently in its hard ( island ) state ( e.g. van straaten et al .",
    "this last characteristic plus its relative proximity ( i.e. a distance of @xmath10  kpc ; brandt et al .",
    "1992 ) make 4u  0614 + 091 the best candidate for the possible detection and imaging of its compact jet .",
    "however , to date , only a @xmath11 upper limit of @xmath12  mjy has been obtained with a westerbork synthesis radio telescope ( wsrt ) observation at 5 ghz ( migliari & fender 2006 ) .    in this letter , we present the spectral evidence for a compact jet in 4u 0614 + 091 , the first in a low - luminosity ns system .",
    "we detected the ir counterpart of 4u  0614 + 091 with the infrared array camera ( irac ) on - board the _ spitzer space telescope _ , and found evidence for optically _",
    "synchrotron radiation emitted by the non - self - absorbed part of a compact jet .",
    "these observations are part of a _ spitzer _",
    "survey of ultra - compact x - ray binaries , aiming to detect the ir non - thermal ( jet ) emission from ns binary systems ; the complete results of the survey will be reported in an upcoming paper .",
    "we observed 4u  0614 + 091 with _ spitzer _",
    "irac at 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 and 8  @xmath0 m , on 2005 october 25 ( ut 17:50:06 - 17:56:36 ) .",
    "we have processed the basic calibrated data using the software mopex ( makovoz & marleau 2005 ) .",
    "we created a mosaic from the 10 frames per band obtained in the observations , created a point - response function ( prf ) with prf_estimate and extracted the source flux from the background subtracted image using apex .",
    "we have corrected for interstellar extinction using @xmath13 [ derived from the equivalent hydrogen column density values in juett , psaltis & chakrabarty ( 2001 ) and using @xmath14 in predehl & schmitt ( 1995 ) ] and following the standard optical - to - ir interstellar extinction law ( e.g. rieke & lebofsky 1985 ; cardelli , clayton & mathis 1989 ) .",
    "the corrections for interstellar extinction are small , i.e. @xmath15 for the flux density at @xmath16 m and less than 5% for the flux densities in the other three irac bands .",
    "we added a @xmath17 systematic error on the estimate of the flux densities to take in to account the uncertainties on the photometric calibration ( see also reach et al .",
    "we detected the ir counterpart of 4u  0614 + 091 in all four irac bands . in fig .  1",
    ", we show the 4.5  @xmath0 m image of 4u  0614 + 091 : a fit of the source with the prf gives coordinates r.a.=@xmath18 and dec.= @xmath19 , coincident with the position of the optical counterpart v1055 ori ( _ cross _ ) . in fig .",
    "2 we show the irac spectrum of 4u  0614 + 091 ( _ filled circles _ ) together with the non - simultaneous observed mean flux density of the optical counterpart ( _ star _ ) and near - ir _ j , h , k _ united kingdom infrared telescope ( ukirt ) observations ( _ triangles _ ; d.m .",
    "russell et al . in preparation ) .",
    "the irac observations are well fit by a power law with @xmath1 ( _ solid line _ ) , which is consistent with the optically thin synchrotron emission observed from jets in xrbs .",
    "the optical counterpart has been observed to vary by @xmath20 mag with respect to the mean ( machin et al .",
    "1990 ; the vertical bars reflect this variation ) , and its spectrum is consistent with thermal emission from the accretion disc ( machin et al .",
    "1990 ; see also nelemans et al .",
    "2004 and juett et al .",
    "2001 ) .    in ultra - compact xrbs",
    ", the thermal spectrum of the disc in the optical and ir bands is expected to follow the rayleigh - jeans law @xmath21 . in fig .  2 , the dashed line represents a power law with @xmath22 normalized to the optical data .",
    "note that the ukirt observations ( taken on 2002 february 14 ) are consistent with a thermal emission from the disc .",
    "we clearly observe a deviation of the irac flux density distribution from a thermal rayleigh - jeans spectrum .",
    "based on the approximately @xmath23 sources detected in the irac field of view of our observations with a flux density @xmath240.1 mjy , the chance probability that a mid - ir emitting source is within @xmath25  arcsec@xmath26 of the 4u  0614 + 091 optical position is @xmath27 .",
    "this has to be considered a firm upper limit , given that only a sub - sample of the detected sources are likely to have the observed power - law spectral shape . the negative spectral index @xmath28 of the power - law spectrum in the mid - ir excludes also the possibility of a circumbinary disk ( e.g. dubus , taam & spruit 2002 ) .",
    "therefore , the non thermal mid - ir radiation observed is synchrotron emission from relativistic electrons in a ( jet ) outflow .",
    "we do not directly observe the ` break frequency ' @xmath29 between the optically thick and the optically thin synchrotron spectrum , which must therefore be at frequencies lower than @xmath30  hz .",
    "this break frequency is still possibly consistent with the upper limits obtained for xte j1118 + 480 ( hynes et al .",
    "2003a ) , but definitely lower than that of other bh xrbs ( e.g. v404 cyg , grs  1915 + 105 ) for which the optically thick synchrotron spectrum has been observed up to the near - ir and optical band ( see fender 2001 and references therein ) . in gx  339 - 4 , we observe a possible break frequency at a few times @xmath31  hz for the lower spectrum in the right panel of fig .  3 ( _ open circles _ ) .",
    "this @xmath29 is about a factor of 10 higher than the upper limit we find in 4u  0614 + 091 .",
    "falcke , krding & markoff ( 2004 ) predict for compact jets in bhs that the break frequency scales with the physical size of the jet at the base , @xmath32 , and the mass accretion rate , @xmath33 , as @xmath34 .",
    "if the base of the jet is linked to the accretion disk , in bhs the _ minimum _ @xmath32 would be the innermost stable orbit , i.e. proportional to the mass of the compact object , while in nss the inner disk radius would depend also on the strength of the surface magnetic field . within this framework , the observed difference in @xmath29 between 4u  0614 + 091 and",
    "gx  339 - 4 can be accounted for by a larger @xmath32 and/or lower @xmath33 in the ns .",
    "the 2 - 10  kev luminosity of the source measured from the daily - averaged count rate of the all - sky monitor ( asm ) on - board the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( _ rxte _ ) on the day of the _ spitzer _ observation is @xmath35  erg / s ( at a distance of 3  kpc ) . using the x - ray bolometric correction in migliari & fender ( 2006 ) , i.e. for an atoll ns in hard state @xmath36 , we obtain @xmath37  erg / s .",
    "since we have an upper limit on the break frequency in 4u  0614 + 091 , we can estimate a conservative lower limit on the total power content in the optically thick plus the observed ir part of the jet with respect to the accretion x - ray power .",
    "given the optically thin spectrum with @xmath38 between 3.5 and 8 @xmath0 m , and assuming ( 1 ) a flat spectrum from the radio band up to @xmath39 m , ( 2 ) a radiative efficiency for the jet of 5% ( blandford & knigl 1979 ; see also fender 2001 , 2006 ) , and ( 3 ) no correction for relativistic bulk motion ( fender 2001 ; gallo et al .",
    "2003 ; see also heinz & merloni 2004 ) , we estimate a lower limit on the compact jet total power up to @xmath40 m of @xmath41  erg / s . only the flat part of the spectrum would be @xmath42  erg / s .",
    "therefore , the lower limit of the ` observed ' total jet power ( up to @xmath40 m ) in this ns system is @xmath43 of the x - ray bolometric power . considering only the optically thick part of the spectrum , we find the total jet power lower limit is 0.05% of the x - ray bolometric power , about 2 orders of magnitude less than the lower limits of @xmath15 inferred for the optically thick spectrum of bhs with the same assumptions ( fender et al .",
    "2000 ; fender 2001 ; corbel & fender 2002 ) .",
    "given that the optically thin part of the synchrotron spectrum in 4u  0614 + 091 is likely to extend to higher energies , up to a ` high - energy cutoff ' frequency above which the flux drops due to cooling processes ( e.g. heinz 2004 ; kaiser 2006 ) , the slope of the optically thin emission that we have measured allows an estimate of the total power in the jet . in fig .  3",
    ", we show the broadband spectrum of 4u  0614 + 091 compared to that of the bh gx  339 - 4 . assuming an optically thin spectrum with @xmath38 , we find the total jet power is @xmath44 erg / s ( where @xmath45 is the high energy limit of the integration in units of 1  kev ) .",
    "if we extend ( arbitrarily ) the jet spectrum up to 1  kev , the total jet power would be @xmath5 of the x - ray bolometric luminosity . while the 2 - 10  kev x - ray fluxes in 4u  0614 + 091 and in the bh gx  339 - 4 are comparable , the observed flux of the synchrotron component in the bh is much larger ( of at least two orders of magnitude ) than that in the ns system ( see fig .",
    "this observed difference in @xmath46 can be explained by a difference in the role of the jet as a power output channel of the two systems : in hard - state bhs the jet could carry a dominant fraction of the accreting power ( in the definition by fender , gallo & jonker 2003 , with the hypothesis of no - advection , the system is ` jet - dominated ' when the total jet power dominates over the x - ray bolometric luminosity ) , while nss never enter such a ` jet - dominated ' regime ( migliari & fender 2006 ) .",
    "the fact that the total jet power is a large fraction of ( and possibly exceeds ) the x - ray luminosity in hard state bhs still allows for the possibility of a significant advective accretion flow ( see advection - dominated accretion flow : e.g. narayan & yi 1994 ; adiabatic inflow - outflow solution : blandford & begelman 1999 ) . as discussed by krding , fender & migliari ( 2006 ) ,",
    "if the fraction of accretion power that goes into the jet is roughly the same in bhs and nss ( and the disk winds are similar for the two systems at a given eddington - scaled accretion rate ) , then some of the relative dimness of bhs in the x - rays can be accounted for by significant advection of energy through an event horizon .",
    "we have observed the ns xrb 4u  0614 + 091 with _ spitzer _ irac and obtained the following results :    _ i ) _ we detected the ir counterpart of 4u  0614 + 091 .",
    "the ir spectrum is non - thermal and well fit by a power law with spectral index @xmath1 .",
    "the ir radiation is the optically thin synchrotron emission from relativistic electrons in a ( jet ) outflow : the ` break ' part a compact jet spectrum .      _",
    "iii ) _ for the optically thick jet , we estimate the total jet power to be @xmath47 of the x - ray bolometric luminosity for 4u  0614 + 091 , i.e. 2 orders of magnitude lower than the lower limit of 10% inferred in bhs , using the same assumptions . by extrapolating the optically thin jet of 4u  0614 + 091 up to 1 kev",
    ", we infer a total jet power corresponding to only 5% of the x - ray bolometric luminosity .    _",
    "iv ) _ the difference in the @xmath46 ratio we find between the ns 4u  0614 + 091 and bhs can be explained by a difference in the role of the jet as a power output channel in the two systems : bhs are ` jet - dominated ' , while nss never enter a ` jet - dominated ' regime .",
    "there is still the possibility that in bhs , while the total jet power dominates the x - ray bolometric luminosity , a significant fraction of the total accreting power is advected through the event horizon .",
