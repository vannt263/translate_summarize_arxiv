    "second , chlorine atoms have a higher polarizability than fluorine atoms because their valence electrons are more diffuse than those of the latter atom .",
    "this causes the van der waals interaction to be stronger in  ( hcl)@xmath0 than in  ( hf)@xmath0 ,  @xcite leading to the more distant energy increments being larger in  ( hcl)@xmath0 when compared with  ( hf)@xmath0 ; all this despite the larger intermonomer distances in  ( hcl)@xmath0 than in  ( hf)@xmath0 .",

    "in contrast to three - dimensional crystals , the dominant contribution of electron correlations to the binding energies of the infinite chains is , in the present investigation , already given by pair interactions between the valence electrons of a monomer and its nearest and next - nearest neighbors .",

    "this partitioning affords a methodological advancement ; if the van der waals constants of a crystal are available from other sources , then the number of energy increments in the incremental expansion can be reduced by considering only van der waals - reduced energy increments ; they typically need to comprise only the nearest- and next - nearest - neighbor energy increments .",
    "the small number of van der waals - reduced energy increments permits one to significantly decrease the number of energy increments which have actually to be calculated to reach a certain accuracy of the correlation energy compared with the conventional incremental series .",
