    "after a newborn low - mass star emerges from the dust of its parent molecular cloud , it spends a few million years as a t  tauri star .",
    "this phase is characterized by optical variability and chromospheric emission lines , as the star accretes gas , propels a bipolar outflow , and contracts onto the main sequence ( see , e.g. , the review by bertout 1989 ) . a conventional boundary line is drawn between `` classical '' and `` weak - lined '' t tauri stars , depending on whether the equivalent width of h@xmath0 emission is greater or smaller than some threshold value , typically 510 angstroms .",
    "of course , this boundary line is somewhat arbitrary , and transitional cases are to be expected , but we are aware of only one t  tauri star , kh  15d , that seems to mock this definition by alternating between classical and weak - lined with clocklike regularity ( hamilton et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "this is not the only unusual property of kh  15d .",
    "although it was classified as a variable member of the young cluster ngc  2264 by badalian & erastova ( 1970 ) , the peculiarity of its variations was not appreciated until kearns & herbst ( 1998 ) found that the object fades by 3  magnitudes every 48 days .",
    "hamilton et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and herbst et al .",
    "( 2002 ) proposed that the star was being periodically eclipsed by circumstellar material .",
    "further monitoring revealed qualitative changes in the eclipses , most notably a gradual increase in their depth and duration , as well as the progressive disappearance of a `` re - brightening '' event that once characterized the mid - eclipse phase .",
    "the dramatic growth in the equivalent width of h@xmath0 emission occurs during the transition from the bright state to the faint state .",
    "apparently the occulting material blocks the photosphere of the star and thereby reduces the contrast between the photosphere and the h@xmath0-emitting region : the star has a `` natural coronagraph '' ( hamilton et al .",
    "eclipse - related variations in both optical polarization ( agol et al .",
    "2004 ) and molecular h@xmath1 emission ( deming , charbonneau , & harrington 2004 ) have also been observed .    for several years",
    ", the cause of the eclipses and of their evolution were the subject of much speculation ( grinin & tambovtseva 2002 , herbst et al .",

    "recently it was proposed that kh  15d is an eccentric binary system that is being occulted by the edge of a circumbinary disk ( winn et al .",
    "2004 , chiang & murray - clay 2004 ) .",
    "in this scenario , we are viewing the system nearly edge - on , and the sky projection of the disk acts as a dark screen that gradually covers the binary .",
    "the advance of the screen is a consequence of the nodal precession of the disk , which is inclined relative to the binary plane . at present",
    ", one member of the binary is hidden at all orbital phases , and the other member undergoes an eclipse each time its orbital motion brings it behind the screen .",
    "winn et al .",
    "( 2004 ; hereafter , paper  i ) showed that this model unified the diverse properties of kh  15d and provided a quantitative fit to the available measurements of the eclipses and their evolution .",
    "chiang & murray - clay ( 2004 ) arrived at the same idea and argued that the disk must be warped and radially narrow ( a `` ring '' ) in order to maintain rigid precession .",
    "it has since been confirmed that kh  15d is a spectroscopic binary with an eccentric orbit ( johnson et al .",
    "in addition , a wealth of new photometric data has become available , from analyses of archival photographs ( johnson et al .",
    "2005 , maffei , ciprini , & tosti 2005 ) , and modern ccd observations ( hamilton et al .  2005 ; barsunova , grinin , & sergeev 2005 ; kusakabe et al .",
    "our main motivation for the work described in this paper was to test whether or not the circumbinary - disk model is consistent with these new data . in    2 and 3",
    ", we describe our compilation of the data , and in   4",
    "we specify the model and its parameters .",
    "section 5 is a direct extension of paper  i : we attempt to fit the observed times and durations of the eclipses , and the observed radial - velocity variations .    a second motivation for this work was to understand certain features of the data that had not previously been explained .",
    "what is the origin of the light that is received during eclipses ? why is the depth of the eclipses slowly increasing with time ? what causes the nearly - repeatable flux variations that are seen throughout ingress , mid - eclipse , and egress ?",
    "we found that by making a minor elaboration to the model  surrounding each of the stars with a faint blue halo  all of these observations could be accurately described .",
    "this is shown in ",
    "finally , in   7 we discuss the interpretation of the fitted model parameters , in particular those that describe the halos .",
    "the most likely interpretation is that scattering by the disk creates an apparent halo around each star .",
    "we suggest some future observations and calculations that may clarify the interpretation .",
    "if these are successful , and if the occulting edge is as sharp as we suspect , then it will be possible to use the occulting edge to map out the environment of the visible star with wondrously fine detail .",
    "this would broaden the significance of this system from being a fascinating puzzle to being a crucial fortuitous case that will provide a deeper understanding of all young stars .",
    "two types of photometry are available for this system : photographic photometry , generally from years before 1985 , and ccd photometry , from 1995 to the present . in all cases ,",
    "the measurements refer to the total light from the system , because the system has not been spatially resolved ( with the possible exception of an h@xmath1 filament observed by tokunaga et al .",
    "the data are very heterogeneous , having been gathered with dozens of different telescopes and reduced with different procedures .",
    "this section describes the available data and our efforts to allow them to be modeled within a single framework . in general , our attitude was cautious , in the sense that we wished to maximize the reliability of the data even at the expense of discarding some of the data .      as a fairly unobscured example of a young stellar cluster , rich with variable stars , ngc  2264",
    "has long been a popular target for photometric campaigns .",
    "many photographic plates of ngc  2264 taken over the past century have been preserved in observatory archives .",
    "four analyses of archival observations of kh  15d have been published :    1 .   winn et al .  ( 2003 ) used blue - sensitive exposures from the harvard college observatory to show that in the first half of the 20th century , the system was rarely ( if ever ) fainter than its modern out - of - eclipse level by more than 1  magnitude . given the number of plates analyzed , they concluded that the system spent less than 20% of the time in such a faint state .",
    "more accurate photometry was impossible because of the glare from a nearby star , hd  47887",

    "a second and much more serious problem is that the mass ratio is @xmath154 , which is less than unity , even though it seems certain that @xmath155 .",
    "the latter problem can be traced to the assumption that the occulting screen moves uniformly in a constant direction . under this assumption",
    ", @xmath156 is proportional to the projected size of star a s orbit , which in turn is proportional to @xmath157 .",

    "together , these inequalities give @xmath164 if @xmath165 is held fixed at 1.2 , the value expected from a consideration of the luminosity ratio , then it is impossible to fit the eclipse data .",
    "for example , in the model , star b is covered 6 years too early , or the rise in the eclipse fraction of star a over the last decade is much slower than has been observed .    as explained in   [ subsec : screen ] , one might expect the real projection of a circumbinary disk to exhibit deviations from a constant velocity . once the screen is allowed to rotate or accelerate during its passage in front of the binary orbit , a much wider range of mass ratios",
    "is allowed .",
    "while this saves the model from a seemingly unphysical prediction , it becomes impossible to determine the stellar mass ratio independently .",
    "instead , in what follows , we hold the mass ratio fixed at @xmath166 . because the leading - order correction in the precession angular velocity @xmath167 is a rotation , we concentrate on the case of uniform motion plus a uniform rotation ( with no acceleration ) . after dropping one of the original free parameters affecting the radial velocities ( @xmath68 ) , and adding a new one ( @xmath168 ) affecting only",

    "we conclude that it is possible to fit the data with a physically plausible mass ratio .",
    "all of the parameters agree with the expectations given in ",
    "[ subsec : expectations ] , including the heliocentric radial velocity ( @xmath170  km  s@xmath17 ) .",
    "the best - fitting value for the rotation rate is @xmath171  rad  yr@xmath17 , which is compatible with reasonable guesses for the circumbinary disk properties .",
    "it implies a precession rate of order @xmath172  rad  yr@xmath17 , as would be experienced by a circular ring of radius @xmath1013  au .",
    "however , a perfectly circular ring is not realistic on physical grounds , and is not consistent with the data beyond this order - of - magnitude comparison ; the rotation rate in that case would be exactly zero at @xmath83 , in contradiction to the assumptions of the model .",
    "we also found that a uniform acceleration with no rotation provides a reasonable fit , and obviously a combination of rotation and acceleration is possible .",
    "given the uncertainty in both the stellar mass ratio and the geometry of the disk , we can not use the model alone to decide which of these cases is closer to the truth .",
    "the models described in the previous section ignore some potentially interesting and information - bearing aspects of the photometry , such as the phase of each individual eclipse , the shape of the ingress and egress light curves , and the progressive deepening of the eclipses . in this section ,",
    "we elaborate upon our model in several ways and attempt to fit all of the photometry .    in paper",
    "i , we generated model light curves by treating the occulting feature as a completely opaque and semi - infinite knife - edge , and the stars as limb - darkened photospheres .",
    "although these model light curves successfully reproduce the basic patterns in the photometry , there are at least three ways in which they fail to match the data within the measurement uncertainties :    1",
    ".   the model does not reproduce the observed @xmath1010.1  mag variations outside of eclipses . as noted previously , hamilton et al.(2005 ) provided evidence for quasiperiodic variability outside of eclipses , and interpreted the 9.6  day period as the stellar rotation period of star a. presumably , these episodic variations are caused by cool star spots that last only a few months , as is common for young low - mass stars ( see , e.g. , herbst et al .",
    "the steepest ( central ) phase of each occultation light curve is consistent with a knife - edge crossing a photosphere .",
    "however , during the first and last third of each event , the flux variation is slower than such a model would predict , as noted by agol et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and in paper  i. 3 .",
    "light is observed even during mid - eclipse , when ( according to the model ) the photospheres of both stars are completely hidden .",
    "the mid - eclipse flux has fallen from about 9% to 2% of the uneclipsed flux over the last decade ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : plotall ] ) .",
    "indeed , the mid - eclipse light is not constant even within a single eclipse .",
    "although the re - brightening events have diminished dramatically in intensity since 1998 , there are still faint echoes of this phenomenon in the more recent data .",
    "we deal with the first point by treating the episodic variations of star a as an intrinsic source of noise .",
    "we do not expect the light curve to be predictable with better than 0.1  mag accuracy .",
    "as for the second and third points , we have found that a good fit is achieved with a simple model in which each star is enveloped by a faint halo .",
    "[ fig : kink ] illustrates how this model accounts for the the light observed during eclipses , the intra - eclipse variations , and the shape of the ingress and egress light curves .",
    "the dashed lines mark 6 special photometric phases , labelled @xmath173@xmath20 , for which the configurations of the photospheres , the halos , and the occulting screen are illustrated in the smaller panels beneath the light curve .",
    "these phases are : ( a ) out of eclipse .",

    "( f ) star b reaches its closest approach to the occulting edge , and its halo is maximally exposed .",
    "the total flux reaches a local maximum .",
    "( at this phase , before @xmath84 , the photosphere of star b was exposed and manifested as the re - brightening event . )",
    "although it is not illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : kink ] , the gradual darkening of the mid - eclipse phase can also be accounted for with this model : as the occulting edge advances , the fraction of the halo of star b that is exposed at mid - eclipse [ panel ( f ) ] gradually shrinks .    to develop a quantitative model ,",
    "we first demonstrate that the occultations of star a are _ repeatable _ events : all of the observed ingress and egress events are nearly equivalent , after correcting for the differences in orbital velocity of the star at the contact points with the occulting edge . using our model",
    ", we calculate the position of star a and of the occulting edge as a function of time .",
    "then , instead of plotting the flux _",
    "vs_.  time , we plot the flux _",
    "vs_.  the position of the occulting edge relative to star a. for this purpose it is convenient to use a rotated coordinate system @xmath174 , in which the occulting edge is the line @xmath175 , the perpendicular direction is the @xmath176-axis , and distances are measured in units of @xmath69 .",

    "the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : coronagraph ] shows the result , summarizing 10 years of photometry as star a goes back and forth beneath the occulting edge .",
    "the measured flux is indeed a coherent function of @xmath178 , with a scatter of @xmath10110% .",
    "this allows us to model the occultations as a knife edge scanning over a time - invariant surface brightness distribution associated with the star , @xmath179 .",
    "since the relative velocity of the edge and the star is always closely aligned with the @xmath180-axis , the only relevant quantity is the one - dimensional brightness distribution @xmath181 when the occulting edge is at @xmath182 and star a is at @xmath177 , the measured flux is the cumulative 1-d brightness distribution @xmath183 which is a function of @xmath184 , as observed .",
    "we note that @xmath3 represents all of the flux that moves with star a on the sky .",
    "it includes light from the star , any luminous material that orbits with the star , and also any scattering halo ( which we will later argue does exist ) .",
    "the halo need not be physically associated with the star , just as the lunar halo that is sometimes observed on cold nights is not physically associated with the moon .",

    "the abrupt slope change at @xmath187 is suggestive of the contact between a sharp occulting edge and the rim of the stellar photosphere . for @xmath188 ,",
    "the flux falls off much more gradually , as if the star is trailed by a spatially extended halo comprising a few per cent of the total flux .",
    "interestingly , the light curve is not symmetric about @xmath185 . once the star is more than half exposed ( @xmath189 ) , the flux rises more gradually than one would expect for a symmetric halo .",

    "they were calculated using a monte carlo algorithm , as follows .",
    "we optimized the parameters on each of @xmath292 synthetic data sets ( `` realizations '' ) .",
    "each realization consisted of @xmath293 flux measurements and @xmath294 radial velocity measurements ( the same numbers as the real data set ) .",
    "the flux measurements were randomly selected from the real data set , with repetitions allowed .",
    "the intent is to estimate the probability distribution of the measurements using the measured data values themselves ( see , e.g. , press et al .",
    "1992 , p.  689 ) .",
    "the number of radial velocity measurements is too small for drawing - with - replacement to be effective .",
    "instead , we added gaussian random numbers to the measured radial velocities , with a mean of zero and a standard deviation given by the quoted @xmath295 values . to account for the uncertainty in the stellar masses , we assigned @xmath296 by picking a random number from a gaussian distribution with mean @xmath297 and standard deviation @xmath298 .",
    "likewise , for the mass ratio @xmath165 , we used a gaussian distribution with a mean of @xmath299 and a standard deviation of @xmath298 .",
    "the stellar radii were fixed according to the relation @xmath300 . for each parameter",
    ", we found the median and the approximate 68% confidence limits in the resulting distribution of best - fitting values .",
    "there are many caveats . to begin with",
    ", the model is not in formal statistical agreement with the data ( some discrepancies are highlighted below ) .",
    "the random flux variations of the stars are not independent ; they are correlated on time scales of days .",
    "the _ a priori _ probability distributions for the stellar masses are probably not gaussian .",
    "the systematic error related to our assumption about the trajectory of the occulting edge has not been taken into account .",
    "one can imagine more complex analyses that attempt to overcome these problems , but we do not believe that such methods are justified .",
    "the model shares the successes of the models presented in   [ sec : orbit ] .",
    "it reproduces the transitions from no eclipses to partial eclipses to total eclipses , the existence of the central reversals from at least 1995 until 1999 , and the growing duty cycle of the modern eclipses .",
    "the more detailed photometric model also accounts for the relative phases of the partial and total eclipses , the gradual deepening of the eclipses and the slope discontinuities in the ingress and egress light curves .",
    "in addition to fitting the data reasonably well , the model satisfies all of the criteria that were discussed in   [ subsec : expectations ] .",
    "the stellar masses , radii , and luminosities are reasonable , by fiat .",
    "the orbital eccentricity is smaller than the theoretical upper bound of 0.66 , and the orbital inclination is close to edge - on .",
    "the heliocentric radial velocity of the center of mass is near the median that has been observed among cluster members .",
    "the screen trajectory is consistent with order - of - magnitude estimates for the expected motion of the edge of a precessing circumbinary ring with a radius of @xmath1013  au .    the best - fitting brightness distribution for star a is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : coronagraph ] .",
    "the upper panel shows the model cumulative 1-d brightness distribution overlaid on the data points , while the lower panel shows the model brightness distribution itself .",
    "the asymmetry of the halo is evident .",
    "the exponential scale length on both sides is a few stellar radii , but the fractional flux of the halo is much greater on the side closest to the occulting edge ( @xmath10125% ) than on the other side ( @xmath1015% ) .    as noted before",
    ", the model can not reproduce the apparently random @xmath10110% flux variations of star a that occur on time scales of a few days . nor can it reproduce the seasonal fluctuations of a few per cent in the mean flux of star a. there are some other significant discrepancies between the data and the model . in the 1967 - 1972 time period ,",
    "there is a @xmath1010.1  mag offset between the calculated and observed light curves , and in addition , the calculated eclipse depth is @xmath1010.15  mag too deep .",
    "these problems are at least partly the fault of the uncertainty in the photographic magnitude scale .",
    "the offset is within the 0.14  mag uncertainty in the zero point , and the calculated depth becomes too _ shallow _ if we use the @xmath6 system instead of the @xmath7 system ( see   [ subsec : plates ] ) .",
    "another discrepancy is the phase shift of @xmath1010.02 between some of the calculated and observed central re - brightenings .",
    "this is most easily seen in the 20002001 data .",
    "this offset disappears for an orbital period of 48.36  days , but that value of @xmath71 is disfavored by the radial velocity data and by the relative phases of the pre-1980 eclipses .",
    "finally , there is one data point in 19971998 that is very poorly described : at @xmath301 , it would seem that the photosphere of star b was partly exposed , but in the model , it was behind the screen .",
    "based on the preceding results , we draw two conclusions .",
    "first , the newly - available data corroborates the theory that kh  15d is an eccentric binary system being occulted by the edge of a precessing circumbinary disk . as shown in ",
    "[ sec : orbit ] , the model presented in paper  i succeeds as a quantitative description of kh  15d , even when confronted with far more data than were available when the model was invented .",
    "the best - fitting parameter values are realistic and conform to theoretical expectations .",
    "a problem that was overlooked in paper  i  the seemingly unphysical mass ratio of the stars  is fixed with a minor and physically - motivated elaboration to the model , namely , the allowance for a more realistic trajectory for the occulting edge across the line of sight .",
    "second , the occultation light curves are well - fitted by a model in which each star is surrounded by a more extended halo .",
    "this model succinctly accounts for both the photometric variations observed during individual events , and the gradual deepening of the eclipses .",
    "the halo around each star is not symmetric about the center of the star , but in each direction it has a typical scale length of a few stellar radii , and it is brighter in the direction facing the occulting edge .",
    "only the one - dimensional profile of the halo has been measured .",
    "what are these halos ? the three broad categories of possible physical interpretations of each halo are ( 1 ) _ luminous _ material , such as accretion columns or a hot corona , ( 2 ) partially _ extinguished _ starlight , ( 3 ) _ scattered _ starlight .",
    "the evidence does not permit an unambiguous interpretation , but it does strongly suggest that the halo light has a scattered component .",
    "relative to the uneclipsed light , the mid - eclipse light has a larger fractional polarization ( agol et al .",
    "2004 ) and is slightly bluer in color ( hamilton et al.2001 , 2005 ; herbst et al .  2002 ; knacke , fajarado - acosta & tokunaga 2004 ; kusakabe et al .",
    "enhanced polarization and blueness are hallmarks of scattering by small particles . in contrast , partially extinguished light would be _ redder _ than the light source ( or the same color , if the particles causing the extinction were large enough ) .",
    "likewise , the observation of only a small color change argues against self - luminous material in an accretion flow or a hot corona , which would not be expected to have nearly the same effective temperature as the photosphere .    just as the _ brightness _ distribution of the halo was determined from @xmath2-band photometry in   [ sec : occultations ] , the _ color _ distribution of the halo can be measured via multi - band photometric monitoring . a first attempt at this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : coronagraph_color ] , which is analagous to fig .  [ fig : coronagraph ] but uses the multi - band photometry of hamilton et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and kusakabe et al .",
    "( 2005 ) rather than monochromatic photometry .",
    "higher - precision monitoring in multiple bands throughout an ingress or egress will help to resolve the color structure of the halo .",
    "as for the location of the scattering material , the two basic possibilities are the immediate vicinity of each star , and the circumbinary disk .",
    "examples of the first scenario are scattering from a corona of hot electrons , or from infalling material .",
    "a difficulty with this scenario is the near - repeatability of the occultation light curve .",
    "a circumstellar halo would need to maintain a fixed orientation in space with respect to the occulting feature , despite the rotation of the star and its tidal interaction with its binary companion .",
    "disk scattering , on the other hand , would need to be dominated by forward - scattering or back - scattering ( or some combination of the two ) , in order to give the appearance of a localized halo around the star . the more general illumination of the disk would not depend strongly on the positions of the stars , because the disk radius of @xmath1013  au is much larger than the binary semimajor axis of @xmath1010.25  au .",
    "it is possible , however , that this is a false dichotomy .",
    "the disk may extend inward continuously to much smaller distances , and indeed the strong h@xmath0 emission , indicative of ongoing accretion , can be taken as evidence for this .",
    "one way in which these possibilities might be distinguished is through the difference in the typical scattering angle . in the case of circumstellar scattering",
    ", the received light is scattered over a wide range of angles , as opposed to the forward- or back - scattering from the disk .",
    "the chromatic and polarization signals associated with scattering depend on the typical scattering angle , as well as the size and composition of the particles .",
    "hence , measurements of the polarized light curve , combined with models of the expected polarization signal under various circumstances , may help to determine the size , composition and spatial distribution of the scattering particles .",
    "it would also be possible to determine the velocity of the scattering material relative to the stars , through observations of doppler shifts in the stellar absorption features of the scattered light .",
    "another interesting feature of the model is the extreme sharpness of the occulting edge .",
    "the best evidence for a sharp edge is the slope discontinuity in the light curve that was pointed out in ",
    "[ sec : occultations ] .",
    "this `` kink '' is most easily understood as the point where the sharp occulting edge contacts the rim of the photosphere of the star .",
    "if the edge were not sharp , then the time of photospheric contact would be smeared out .",
    "the presence of the kink requires that the optical depth of the edge increases from nearly zero to @xmath3023.5 over a distance that is smaller than a stellar radius .",
    "it can also be argued that the edge is sharp on the scale of a stellar radius based on the dramatic changes in the h@xmath0 emission and absorption profile that hamilton et al .",
    "( 2003 ) observed during an occultation .",
    "the implication is that the occulting edge spatially resolves the h@xmath0-emitting region , which is thought to arise within a few stellar radii ( i.e.  within the magnetosphere ) .",
    "an independent way to assess the sharpness of the edge would be to measure the rossiter - mclaughlin effect . in ",
    "[ sec : rv ] , we predicted the amplitude of this effect for a perfectly sharp and straight edge . in the other extreme ,",
    "in which the scale length of the edge is much larger than the stellar radius , there is no rossiter effect .",
    "thus , a sequence of optical spectra with a high signal - to - noise ratio throughout an occultation could be used to determine whether or not the occulting edge resolves the stellar photosphere .",
    "if the occulting edge is truly sharp on the scale of the stellar radius , then it can be used to map out the environment of star a on scales unobservable by any other means , just as lunar occultations were used to identify radio and x - ray sources before the necessary angular resolution was available .",
    "spectroscopic monitoring would resolve the velocity structure of the surrounding material .",
    "the projected orbital velocity of star a relative to the edge is approximately one stellar radius per day .",
    "thus , a time sampling of 1 hour corresponds to a spatial resolution of @xmath1010.05 stellar radii , or an angular resolution of @xmath1010.5  @xmath303as at a distance of 760  pc .",
    "however , the scattering geometry will need to be understood first , to allow the information in the halos to be decoded .",
    "an interesting theoretical question is _ why _ the edge is sharp . with a radius of @xmath304  au and a vertical scale height @xmath305 , the circumbinary disk would have @xmath306 . as pointed out by chiang & murray - clay ( 2004 ) ,",
    "this is at least an order of magnitude smaller than the values generally assumed for t  tauri stars , which are based on the consideration of hydrostatic equilibrium between gas pressure in the disk and the vertical gravitational field provided by the star .",
    "one possible resolution is that there is little or no gas over the range of orbital distances that form the occulting feature .",
    "another possibility is that @xmath86 is smaller than the dynamical arguments suggest .",
    "a third and most intriguing possibility is that the obscuring particles in the disk have settled to the midplane and formed a much sharper layer than the distribution of gas .",
    "the dust - settling process has long been investigated as a possible mechanism for generating planetesimals , by enhancing the surface density of solid particles until a gravitational instability ensues ( safronov 1969 , goldreich & ward 1973 , weidenschilling 1977 ) .",
    "finally , we end this discussion on a note of urgency .",
    "a problem with all of the observations proposed above is that the edge is continuing to advance and will eventually cover star a at all orbital phases .",
    "according to the model of   [ sec : occultations ] , the photosphere of star a will set for the last time near the beginning of 2008 , although that prediction hinges on our extrapolation of the trajectory of the occulting screen .",
    "the halo of star a will be visible for several years after the photosphere is hidden .",
    "we encourage continued monitoring and will gladly provide predictions of future occultations to interested parties .",
    "we are grateful to v.  grinin and o.  yu .  barsunova for providing their optical data , and to m.  tamura for providing his group s near - infrared data .",
