    "the remaining torus links @xmath15 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 happen to be exactly those torus links that can also be obtained as plumbings of positive hopf bands according to a finite tree , where vertices correspond to positive hopf bands and edges indicate plumbing .",

    "the basic idea is that such an orbit is infinite if the monodromy has infinite order .",
    "for example , we show that in fact every ( prime ) positive braid link with pseudo - anosov monodromy admits infinitely many non - isotopic arcs preserving fibredness .",
    "this suggests the following question : is it true that among all ( non - split prime ) positive braid links , the ade plane curve singularities are exactly those that admit just a finite number of fibredness preserving arcs up to isotopy ?",

    "the subsequent section combines a criterion on arcs to preserve fibredness from  @xcite with the property of monodromies of positive hopf plumbed surfaces to be right - veering .",
    "this allows for the following simple test for an arc to preserve fibredness , in our situation : an arc preserves fibredness if and only if it does not intersect its image under the monodromy ( up to free isotopy ) .",
    "section  [ sec : monodromies ] contains descriptions of the fibre surfaces and the monodromies of the links we consider ( torus links and the @xmath23 links ) . alongside ,",
    "we give a constructive proof of theorem  [ thm:1 ] .    in section  [ sec : exceptional ] , we explain the idea of proof for the finiteness result that provides the `` if '' part of theorem  [ thm:2 ] , and list the fibred links obtained by cutting the fibre surfaces of the @xmath23 links along an arc in table  [ table ] .    section  [ sec : infinite ] accounts for the cases where the monodromy has infinite order .",
    "this concerns in particular the positive tree - like hopf plumbings that correspond to trees different from the @xmath23 trees and settles the `` only if '' part of theorem  [ thm:2 ] .    at the beginning of section  [ sec : propproofs ] , we set up the notation and methods needed for the proof of the finiteness part of theorem  [ thm:2 ] , which we split into proposition  [ prop:3345 ] ( concerning torus links ) and proposition  [ prop : dne7 ] ( concerning tree - like hopf plumbings ) .",
    "the rest of that section is devoted to the proofs of these propositions .",
    "in the sequel we would like to make statements on the relative position of two arcs @xmath24 in a surface @xmath7 with boundary ( that is , @xmath24 are embedded intervals with endpoints on the boundary of @xmath7 that are nowhere tangent to @xmath25 ) .",
    "the following definition will simplify matters .",
    "let @xmath7 be an oriented surface with boundary and let @xmath26 be two arcs .",
    "a property @xmath27 is said to hold _",

    "the remainder of this section will recall the fact that every positive braid link ( that is , the closure of a braid word consisting only of the positive generators of the braid group , without their inverses ) is fibred and has so - called _ right - veering _ monodromy ( see below for a definition ) .",
    "the torus links @xmath18 provide examples , since they can be viewed as the closures of the positive braids @xmath32 , where the @xmath33 denote the ( positive ) standard generators of the braid group .",
    "let @xmath7 be an oriented surface with boundary and @xmath34 a diffeomorphism that restricts to the identity on @xmath25 .",
    "then , @xmath35 is called _ right - veering _ if for every arc @xmath36\\to s$ ] , the vectors @xmath37 form an oriented basis after minimising isotopies on @xmath10 and @xmath38 .",
    "this means basically that arcs starting at a boundary point of @xmath7 get mapped `` to the right '' by @xmath35 .",
    "it is known that every positive braid can be obtained as an iterated plumbing of positive hopf bands ( see @xcite ) . since",
    "a hopf band is a fibre and plumbing preserves fibredness , every positive braid link is fibred .",
    "moreover the monodromy is a product of positive dehn twists , since the monodromy of a ( positive ) hopf band is a ( positive ) dehn twist and the monodromy of a plumbing is the composition of the monodromies of the plumbed surfaces ( see @xcite ) .",

    "it therefore suffices to study torus links , @xmath3 and the @xmath1 family .",

    "the number @xmath56 is called the _ twist length _ of the corresponding boundary annulus . after an isotopy ( fixing the boundary of @xmath7 ) , we may therefore assume that @xmath35 is periodic except on some annular neighbourhoods of @xmath25 .",
