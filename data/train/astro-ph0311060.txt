    "one of the most active areas of research during the last decade has been the study of the present and past star formation histories of galaxies .",
    "this includes detailed studies of the stellar population of our own galaxy and of local group dwarfs , both individually and as relic evidence of the global star formation history of the universe @xcite . while potentially very powerful , the techniques used in these studies are difficult to extend much beyond the local group .    at somewhat larger distances ,",
    "efforts have gone towards understanding the global properties of more massive galaxies and the dependence of star formation on mass and/or morphological classification .",
    "this has been accompanied by careful mapping of both the star formation and the gas distribution in galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "based on these studies , a picture has emerged in which more massive galaxies undergo a larger fraction of their star formation at early times than less massive ones .",
    "this has often been said to present a challenge for existing models of galaxy formation .",
    "these studies have traditionally been carried out with relatively small samples of local galaxies .",
    "for example , the comparatively large sample of contains 369 spiral galaxies . with the advent of large fiber - fed surveys such as the 2df @xcite and the sdss @xcite",
    ", it is now possible to extend such studies dramatically in size .",
    "large galaxy surveys have most recently been exploited by @xcite , who carried out a comprehensive study of different sfr indicators , and by @xcite who studied the local h@xmath13luminosity density .    alongside these careful studies of individual local galaxies , a global picture of the star formation history of the universe has been assembled through careful studies of star forming galaxies as a function of look - back time @xcite .",
    "the main emphasis of this work has been the star formation history of the universe as a whole .",
    "some workers have also tried to study the evolution of different morphological types @xcite .",
    "these studies have adopted a wide variety of star formation indicators @xcite . despite differences between different indicators",
    "it is clear that there has been a decline in the rate of star formation since @xmath14 , although there is still no consensus on how rapid this decline was .",
    "there is also no clear consensus on the star formation history before @xmath15 .",
    "studies in the literature give answers ranging from a clear increase back to @xmath16 @xcite , through a constant rate of star formation back to @xmath17 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , to a decline at high @xmath18 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "one of the key unanswered questions is what physical parameter(s ) drive changes in the star formation rate in individual galaxies .",
    "although an increasing body of evidence points to turbulence being a key influence on star formation on small scales ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , the origin of this turbulence and its relevance for star formation on galaxy - sized scales is unclear .",
    "it is therefore of major interest to investigate empirically what global quantities correlate strongly with star formation activity .",
    "it is logical , however , to expect that the star formation rate is a function of many variables . to investigate this dependence it is necessary to study the star formation rate density function in various projections ( see also the approach by * ? ? ?",
    "this is also becoming a favoured approach to analyse theoretical models ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we will pursue this goal here by trying to tie together detailed information on individual galaxies with their contribution to the overall cosmic star formation activity .",
    "this is possible both through studying a snapshot in time and by comparing current and past average star formation distributions . on a global scale , this provides a nearly model - independent complement to the studies of the cosmic spectrum by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this kind of study requires a survey that spans a large range in galaxy properties and with accurate photometric and spectroscopic information . the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss",
    "* ) is an ideal candidate for this kind of work .",
    "its accurate photometry allows good characterisation of the selection function and the structural parameters of galaxies .",
    "the large database of accurately calibrated spectra allows a much more careful study of the spectral properties of galaxies than has hitherto been possible .    with such unprecedented quality of data",
    "it is pertinent to improve modelling over what has generally been done before .",
    "one aspect in particular that is generally missing in earlier work is a rigorous treatment of line formation and dust .",
    "this is especially important for the sdss as it spans a large range in luminosity so the physical parameters of the galaxy can be reasonably expected to vary . in this paper",
    "we have therefore built on the work of @xcite and fit all strong emission lines simultaneously to simultaneously constrain these physical properties .",
    "our paper is structured as follows : we start in section  [ sec : data ] by briefly describing the data used .",
    "section  [ sec : models ] gives an overview of the models and the modelling needed for our analysis .",
    "this includes a discussion of the relationship between h@xmath13-luminosity and sfr .",
    "section  [ sec : agn_contrib ] discusses in some detail the influence of agn activity on our estimates of star formation rates ( sfrs ) .",
    "section  [ sec : aperture_effects ] discusses the very important question of aperture effects in a fibre survey such as the sdss and sets out our method for removing these . with these preliminaries out of the way",
    ", we discuss the local sfr density in section  [ sec : sfr_density ] and give an inventory of star formation in section  [ sec : overall_prop ] .",
    "the specific star formation rate and its variation with mass is discussed in section  [ sec : spec_sfr ] and the variation with other physical parameters is covered in section  [ sec : b_vs_phys_param ] .",
    "the paper is concluded in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "we use a cosmology with @xmath19km / s / mpc , @xmath20 , @xmath21 . where appropriate we define @xmath22km / s / mpc .",
    "we use the @xcite universal imf . to convert to the popular choice of a @xcite imf between 0.1 and 100@xmath4",
    ", one should multiply our sfr estimates by 1.5 , the ratio of mass in the two imfs for the same amount of ionising radiation .",
    "we will also make use of stellar mass estimates below and to convert these to a salpeter imf it is again necessary to multiply the masses by 1.5 .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) ( @xcite ; @xcite ) is an ambitious survey to obtain spectroscopic and photometric data across @xmath23 steradians .",
    "the survey is conducted using a dedicated 2.5 m telescope at apache point observatory .",
    "the photometry is obtained using drift - scanning with a unique ccd camera @xcite , allowing near - simultaneous photometry in five bands ( @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath18 , @xcite ) .",
    "the resulting data are reduced in a dedicated photometric pipeline , ` photo ` @xcite and astrometrically calibrated @xcite .",
    "we use the results of ` photo v5.4 ` . to estimate total magnitudes we use the ` cmodel ` magnitudes recommended for use by the dr2 paper @xcite .",
    "this is a weighted combination of the exponential and de vaucouleurs fits to the light profile provided by ` photo ` and has the advantage over petrosian magnitudes that they are higher s / n ( cf . the discussion in",
    "we have also performed all calculations with the petrosian total magnitudes and found that the results in the paper change if these are used although we get a few more outliers .",
    "fiber magnitudes in @xmath28 are measured directly from the observed spectrum and the @xmath29-band magnitude is normalised to the fiber magnitude of ` photo ` . when estimating fixed - frame magnitudes we follow @xcite and k - correct our magnitudes to @xmath6 to minimise the errors on the k - correction .",
    "we will also adopt their notation and refer to these redshifted magnitudes as @xmath30 , @xmath31and @xmath32 .",
    "the spectroscopic observations are obtained using two fiber - fed spectrographs on the same telescope with the fiber placement done using an efficient tiling algorithm @xcite .",
    "the spectroscopic data are reduced in two independent pipelines ` spectro1d ` ( subbarao et al , in preparation ) and ` specbs ` ( schlegel et al , in preparation )  we use the ` specbs ` redshifts , but the differences between the two pipelines are entirely negligible .    the dataset used in the present study is based on the main sdss galaxy sample , described by @xcite .",
    "we use a subset of @xcite s _ sample 10 _ consisting of 149660 galaxies with spectroscopic observations , @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "this encompasses slightly more galaxies than the sdss data release 1 @xcite .",
    "the overall continuum properties of this sample are discussed in some detail by @xcite and the sample selection and spectrum pipeline analysis are discussed by @xcite .",
    "the spectrophotometric calibration we use will also be used in data release 2 @xcite .",
    "we make extensive use of stellar masses for the galaxies taken from @xcite . to be consistent with the latter we will throughout use the narrow definition of the 4000 - break from @xcite and denote this as d4000 .",
    "as detailed in @xcite we have chosen to re - analyse the 1d spectra using our own optimised pipeline .",
    "this allows us to take more care in the extraction of emission line fluxes than is done in the general purpose sdss pipeline .",
    "the key differences for the work presented here are as follows : we remove the smear exposures so that the spectra are uniformly exposed within a 3  fibre and we use the latest high - resolution population synthesis models by @xcite to fit the continuum using a non - negative linear - least- squares routine @xcite .",
    "this provides an excellent fit to the continuum and lets us perform continuum subtraction with unprecedented accuracy .",
    "the fitting procedure automatically accounts for weak metal absorption under the forbidden lines and for balmer absorption ( see e.g.  @xcite for examples of the quality of fit ) .",
    "the ability to extract very weak line emission turns out to be very important when studying trends with mass ( and hence increasing continuum contribution ) and when estimating dust attenuation .",
    "we will see below that it is also important to identify possible agn contamination of the emission lines .",
    "a crucial aspect of the sdss for studies of the nearby galaxy population is that it has a well - defined and well - studied selection function @xcite and covers a large range in absolute magnitude .",
    "this means that we can use the galaxy sample not only to study individual galaxies , but to construct distribution functions for volume - limited samples with high accuracy .",
    "note that one can usually extract _ trends _ from a judiciously chosen , but statistically poorly characterised sample , but the _ distribution _ of a parameter requires a statistically well - defined sample .",
    "we will therefore focus our attention on distribution functions throughout our analysis .",
    "we will limit our study to galaxies with @xmath34 .",
    "the lower limit reflects our wish to include galaxies of the lowest possible luminosity . at the same time",
    ", we wish to avoid redshifts where deviations from hubble flow are substantial and the accessible volume is very small . at the low redshift limit ,",
    "a galaxy with the mass - to - light ratio appropriate for a 13.6 gyr old stellar population and @xmath35 would have a stellar mass just below @xmath36 solar masses .",
    "we should therefore be complete to this mass limit .",
    "our sample can thus be used to reconstruct the properties of a volume limited sample of galaxies with @xmath37 . as we will see below",
    ", we also include the vast majority of all star formation in the nearby universe .      .",
    "the galaxies plotted here have s / n@xmath38 in all four lines.,width=317 ]    .basic data about the subsamples discussed in the text . [ cols= \"",
    "< , > , > , > \" , ]     [ tab : b_values ]    the star formation per unit mass has either explicitly or implicitly been used in numerous studies of field galaxies at @xmath39 by using equivalent widths of h@xmath13  or [ o ii]3727 . in the local universe , it has however often been rephrased in terms of the present to past - average star formation rate .",
    "this is a suggestive quantity , which immediately gives an indication of the past star formation history of the galaxy and its relation to present - day activity .",
    "the main disadvantage of the present - to - past average sfr is that it involves more assumptions than the specific star formation rate as we will see below .",
    "the conversion between the two can be succinctly summarised as @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the fraction of the total stellar mass initially formed that is return to the ism over the lifetime of the galaxy , and @xmath42 is the time over which the galaxy has formed stars ( @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the hubble time at redshift @xmath18 and @xmath45 is the time of formation ) .    given a choice of imf , it is possible to reliably estimate @xmath41 using stellar evolution theory .",
    "we use the median @xmath41 estimated for our galaxies which is @xmath46 . for @xmath42 it is customary to take @xmath47 , ie .",
    "assume that all galaxies started to form stars at @xmath48 .",
    "we will adopt this convention below ( with @xmath49 ) .",
    "this assumption is sensible when comparing average @xmath9 values for large samples , but might be more questionable for individual galaxies .",
    "in general , this means that the @xmath9 values we calculate will be upper limits .    throughout this discussion",
    ", we will use @xmath9 and @xmath50 interchangeably , depending on which is more appropriate .",
    "as highlighted by , the @xmath9 value is a convenient parameterisation of `` burstiness '' and @xmath51 provides a convenient divide between galaxies consistent with a constant or declining sfr over the age of the universe and those that have a higher sfr at present than they have typically had in the past .        before turning to the results for our sample",
    ", we note that there are at least two reasonable definitions for the _ average _ @xmath50 and one must take care to specify which one is discussing .",
    "the average @xmath50 value of a sample of @xmath52 galaxies is simply @xmath53 where the weights @xmath54 can be unity or e.g.  @xmath55 depending on the question asked .",
    "this is the appropriate quantity to quote when talking about the typical galaxy . in practice",
    "we calculate this using the full likelihood distributions of @xmath50 for each galaxy .",
    "we also usually choose to quote the median rather than the average as this is binning insenstive ( cf .",
    "discussion in appendix  [ sec : manipulate_likelihoods ] ) .",
    "@xmath56 can be very different from the @xmath50 value for a volume limited sample : @xmath57 which is the appropriate quantity to quote for the the star formation history of the universe as a whole . to calculate @xmath58 using our likelihood distributions",
    ", we employ the same monte carlo summation technique used in the calculation of @xmath59 in section  [ sec : sfr_density ] .",
    "it is important to include the stellar mass in this monte carlo code , because , as mentioned in appendix  [ sec : manipulate_likelihoods ] , neglecting to do so will bias our results .",
    "( to investigate the size of this bias we carried out the calculation of @xmath58 with and without the full likelihood distribution of @xmath60 and found that ignoring the uncertainty in @xmath60 resulted in an overestimate of @xmath50 of about 15% . )",
    "we begin by calculating @xmath61 for the sample as a whole .",
    "this is a straightforward application of the results in the previous section and we show this quantity in table  [ tab : b_values ] .",
    "we see that for @xmath62 , the present day universe is forming stars at slightly higher than 1/3 of its past average rate , depending on the time - span one averages over in equation  ( [ eq : b_vs_tau_sfr ] ) .",
    "once again we have calculated the likelihood distribution using the monte carlo method discussed in appendix  [ sec : manipulate_likelihoods ] with 100 bootstrap repetitions and 30 monte carlo sums for each repetition .",
    "the resulting errors are also indicated in table  [ tab : b_values ] , but as with the total sfr density in section  [ sec : sfr_density ] the random errors are substantially smaller than the systematic ones . following the discussion in section  [ sec : sfr_density ] , we adopt the same estimates of systematic errors on the total sfrs and find a present - to - past average sfr for the local universe of @xmath63 with random errors corresponding to the 68% confidence interval .",
    "it is interesting to compare @xmath61 for the different classes we have defined .",
    "if we look at quantities determined inside the fibre , it follows almost by definition that the sf class has the highest @xmath61 value and the unclassifiable category the lowest . if we look at the values derived from the total sfr , the sf class still dominates , but it is interesting to note that the global @xmath9 value for this class is the same as the central one .",
    "for the other classes one typically finds that the global @xmath9 is higher than that inside the fibre .",
    "this is , of course , partly a sample selection issue : galaxies classed as sf are those that have relatively more star formation inside the fibre .",
    "it is also interesting to note that galaxies showing indications of agn activity form an intermediate category between the composites and the unclassifiable .",
    "this is again logical because agn would have been classified as composites if they had substantially higher sfr .",
    "we now study how the specific star formation rate varies between galaxies of different stellar mass .",
    "we split the galaxy sample into nine bins in _ total _ stellar mass .",
    "we sum up the likelihood distributions of @xmath50 , ie .",
    "we calculate @xmath56 without the normalisation in equation  ( [ eq : average_b_galaxy ] ) .",
    "we show the resulting distributions of @xmath56 in figure  [ fig : spec_sfr_vs_mass ] .",
    "the histograms are normalised to the total number of galaxies within that bin .",
    "no volume correction has been applied , but the difference to that shown is very small except in the lowest mass bins .",
    "( note that we might not be complete in mass in the lowest bin . )",
    "the contribution to the distributions that is located outside the plotted range has been distributed on the two lowest and two highest bins respectively .",
    "the histogram for galaxies with @xmath64 is repeated in each panel for reference .",
    "the shaded histograms show the distributions of those galaxies classified as recent starbursts based on their d4000 and h@xmath65 values by  @xcite .",
    "the thick black line shows the median volume weighted @xmath50 value ( @xmath56 ) , and the red line shows @xmath58 .",
    "the latter is higher as the total sfr is dominated by galaxies with extreme values of @xmath50 .",
    "figure  [ fig : spec_sfr_vs_mass ] shows that there is a reasonably good agreement between the recent burst estimates of @xcite , which are sensitive to activity in the last gyr , and the activity indicated by emission lines .",
    "thus galaxies that are currently undergoing elevated star formation activity ( relative to the hubble time ) have typically done so for at least a gyr .",
    "it is also clear that the _ fraction _ of galaxies that show clear signatures of recent starbursts declines rapidly with mass .",
    "this can either be due to a lower gas fraction in more massive galaxies and/or the fact that periods of elevated star formation may be shorter in duration in more massive galaxies .",
    "figure  [ fig : spec_sfr_vs_mass ] also shows that the peak of the distribution shifts rather little over a large range in mass ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "the peak value is very close to @xmath51 . in other words ,",
    "most galaxies with @xmath67 are forming stars at a rate that is consistent with their past average ( ie .",
    "at a constant rate ) .",
    "above @xmath68 , we see a clear change in the shape of the distribution of @xmath69 with a transition towards a low specific sfrs .",
    "this coincides well with the transition mass defined by  @xcite .",
    "also note that the second peak showing up at @xmath70 at high mass is broader than the one at high @xmath50 because the sfrs are less well constrained there .",
    "despite this near - constancy of the peak , there is a marked change in the shape of the tails . at low masses",
    "there is a substantial tail towards higher @xmath9-values , ie .  a trend towards more bursty star formation activity .",
    "this changes to a substantial tail towards low @xmath9-values at high masses .",
    "many massive galaxies are now forming stars at a depressed rate compared to their past average .",
    "section  [ sec : overall_prop ] focused on the distribution of the sfr density as a function of different physical parameters",
    ". we will now study the relation between the specific sfr and these same quantities .",
    "this will help us understand which factors control / are controlled by the star formation activity in individual galaxies .",
    "most previous studies have focused on the trend with mass and hubble type .",
    "a key question has been which of these parameters correlate better with @xmath9 .",
    "the studies of local spirals by and @xcite indicated that the driving variable was the stellar mass content .",
    "other studies have made more of the correlation with hubble type ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we will improve on these studies with a sample that is several orders of magnitude larger than the previous studies and with more careful and internally consistent modelling .",
    "we will not discuss the dependence on local density here .",
    "recent studies of the correlation between star formation and density can be found in @xcite and @xcite .                            throughout this analysis",
    ", we will show results using @xmath69 and @xmath61 derived from our _ total _ sfr estimates . in figure",
    "[ fig : conc_vs_b ] , we show the trend of @xmath9 with central concentration / hubble type .",
    "the left hand panel in figure  [ fig : conc_vs_b ] contrasts @xmath69 ( solid line ) with @xmath61 ( crosses ) .",
    "the solid line shows the median of the unweighted @xmath69 calculated from the right panel using the formalism discussed in appendix  [ sec : manipulate_likelihoods ] .",
    "we do not show the confidence intervals , but as is evident from the full likelihood distributions , they are wide .",
    "the crosses show @xmath61 in each bin in @xmath71 .",
    "this is calculated using monte carlo summation and is basically the ratio of the black and red curves in figure  [ fig : sfr_dens_fig3 ] . in general @xmath61 is larger than @xmath69 because @xmath50 has substantial tails towards large values .",
    "@xmath61 is therefore dominated by galaxies away from the median .",
    "the right panel of figure 21 shows the conditional likelihood distribution of @xmath50 given the concentration parameter , @xmath72 , for the local universe .",
    "this has been constructed by assuming that @xmath73 is independent of @xmath74 and assuming a 5% error on @xmath75 ( this latter assumption is not important for the results ) .",
    "each distribution has been weighted by 1/v@xmath76 .",
    "the distribution in the right panel then follows from a straight addition of all the individual @xmath77 and normalisation of the distribution in each bin of @xmath75 to produce the conditional likelihood distribution . as in figure",
    "[ fig : spec_sfr_vs_mass ] contributions to the likelihood distributions outside the plotted range in @xmath78  has been placed in the two lowest bins in @xmath78 .",
    "these two panels illustrate the bimodal nature of the distribution of galaxies .",
    "this has recently been described and quantified in a number of papers ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as can be seen , galaxies split into two basic populations : concentrated galaxies with low specific star formation rates , and low mass , less concentrated galaxies with high specific star formation rates .",
    "the distribution at high concentration is broad however because there is also a fairly important contribution from concentrated , actively star forming galaxies at very low redshift .",
    "when the figure is plotted for the sample directly , ie .  without volume weighting ,",
    "the two regimes are much more clearly separated .",
    "figure  [ fig : mstar_vs_b ] shows , with the same layout , the distribution of @xmath9 as a function of stellar mass .",
    "we see that although there is a clear decline in @xmath9 with increasing stellar mass , the trend in @xmath69 is weak over a large range in stellar mass until it suddenly drops at around @xmath79 .",
    "the @xmath61 value shows a much smoother trend .",
    "this is caused by the large spread in @xmath50 at given mass .",
    "if we compare figures  [ fig : mstar_vs_b ] and [ fig : conc_vs_b ] , we see that the hubble type correlates somewhat less well with the @xmath9 parameter than the stellar mass does .",
    "figure  [ fig : logmu_vs_b ] shows @xmath9 as a function of stellar mass surface density , @xmath80 .",
    "the connection between this and @xmath81  has been discussed in detail by @xcite .",
    "those authors show that @xmath80 correlates well with @xmath82 , except at the very highest masses where @xmath80 reaches a saturation value .",
    "it is therefore not surprising that we see a very similar trend with @xmath80 as we saw with @xmath82 in figure  [ fig : mstar_vs_b ] .",
    "when we plot the figure without volume weighting it is very similar but the low sfr peak becomes more prominent at high @xmath80 than at high @xmath82 , suggesting that the surface density of stars is more important than the stellar mass in determining when star formation is turned off .",
    "figure  [ fig : mr_vs_b ] again presents a similar view .",
    "this time the @xmath9 parameter is plotted as a function of absolute @xmath26-band magnitude at @xmath6 .",
    "the correlation here is fairly good . for galaxies fainter than about @xmath83",
    ", the @xmath84 parameter increases by about 40% per magnitude .",
    "figure  [ fig : d4000_vs_b ] shows the relationship between @xmath9 and the 4000 - break .",
    "the left panel shows this to be a fairly tight relation  one reason why @xcite were so successful in constraining the @xmath85 ratio for galaxies using the 4000 - break and the @xmath86 index .",
    "we note that this relation does have the potential to constrain star formation in high redshift galaxies , as the balmer break can be measured out to considerably higher redshift than h@xmath13 . from figure",
    "[ fig : d4000_vs_b ] we see that a measurement of d4000 allows one to constrain @xmath84 to within a factor of three ( 1@xmath87 ) for d4000@xmath88 .",
    "although this is not very precise , it should be weighed against the fact that it is very difficult to estimate star formation rates to better than within a factor of two with any technique .",
    "it is however important to caution that the d4000 index intrinsically depend on the sfr in the last giga - year rather than the current sfr , as well as the metallicity .",
    "it is therefore necessary to assume that the present sfr is similar to the average activity in the last gyr to make recourse to the relation in figure  [ fig : d4000_vs_b ] .",
    "we caution that d4000 is measured within the fibre , whereas our sfr estimates are for the entire galaxy .",
    "if we make the same plot using sfr estimated within the fibre , we still recover a tight correlation between @xmath69 and d4000 .",
    "moreover , we find that @xmath69 and @xmath61 now coincide .",
    "it is galaxies that have high d4000 within the fibre but significant star formation outside which make @xmath61 considerably higher than @xmath69 at high d4000 in figure  [ fig : d4000_vs_b ] .",
    "we finish by showing @xmath9 versus @xmath89 in figure  [ fig : r50_vs_b ] .",
    "it is clear that the low and high @xmath9 galaxies co - exist over the entire range in @xmath89 .",
    "but there is a general trend for higher @xmath61 at the smallest sizes and for large galaxies to have typically lower values of @xmath61 .",
    "the top @xmath90-axis shows the mean @xmath42-type implied by the concentration according to the recipe described in the text .",
    "the crosses show the sample of  @xcite and the boxes that of .,width=317 ]    before we turn to a discussion of these results , it is enlightening to compare our results with previous work in more detail .",
    "the main comparison samples are those presented by @xcite and in their studies of star formation histories in spiral galaxies .",
    "they calculate @xmath9-parameters for a range in morphological types and in figure  [ fig : conc_vs_b_against_others ] we plot this distribution of b versus approximate morphological type for our sample .",
    "we have taken the relation between rc3 t - type and concentration from @xcite to convert concentration measures into approximate t - types .",
    "we fitted a linear relation between @xmath42 and @xmath75 from their table 3 which is indicated on the upper axis . in the same plot",
    "we show the results of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* their table 4 ) as crosses and those of as squares , with big squares corresponding to the median value ( bcgs are not shown ) . the data we show for our study are the unweighted @xmath69 values which should be appropriate for comparison to local studies .",
    "there is clearly a considerable uncertainty in the @xmath90-axis , but the general agreement in trends and turn - over between the different samples indicates that the conversion between @xmath75 and @xmath42-type derived by @xcite seems to be fairly reliable .",
    "it is also clear that the values from are considerably lower than ours .",
    "this may be due in part to differences in galaxy density in the two samples , but is more likely due to differences in the method used to determine the stellar mass .",
    "gavazzi et al use an average dark matter mass to stellar mass ratio to derive stellar masses .",
    "we have chosen not to attempt to adjust for differences in methodology , as our main interest is in comparing the overall trend .",
    "the preceding sections have provided a detailed inventory of the star formation activity in the local universe .",
    "one possibly surprising result is that the dominant contribution to the sfr density comes from galaxies with on - going star formation in their inner few kiloparsecs ( the sf and low s / n sf classes ) .",
    "these galaxies contribute @xmath91% of the total sfr density , whereas galaxies with signs of agn ( composites and agn ) contribute about 15% of the total .",
    "the remaining 12% of @xmath92 is located in galaxies we are unable to classify based on their fibre spectra .",
    "these are almost certainly galaxies with substantial bulges , in which stars are forming in the outer disk .",
    "a thorough examination of this question has to be postponed to a different article , but it is clear that the relative importance of star formation in the outer disk is a function of the mass or luminosity of the galaxy .",
    "when we look at narrow redshift ranges we find that the median aperture corrections increase by a factor of 2 from stellar masses around @xmath93 to @xmath94 .",
    "the natural question is how this relates to star formation in bulges as compared to disks , but this will have to await a study of the resolved properties of our galaxies .",
    "we found that galaxies in the sf class have sfr profiles that follow the @xmath26-band light .",
    "for these galaxies , it is possible , and accurate , to remove aperture bias by simple scaling with the @xmath26-band flux ( cf . * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we have , for the first time , been able to calibrate the conversion factor from h@xmath13  to sfr as a function of mass and we show that the standard conversion factor is a very good average correction for most galaxies in the local universe . by lucky coincidence , trends in the conversion factor and in the intrinsic case b ratio of h@xmath13  to h@xmath95",
    "tend to cancel each other out . as a result",
    ", it will be sufficient to take a fixed case b ratio and a fixed @xmath96 for most studies , even though neither of the two assumptions is correct .",
    "one of the main questions we want to address is what excites large - scale star formation in galaxies .",
    "seen from this angle the different parameters we have studied fall into two categories .",
    "first there is the incidental set  those parameters which are controlled by star formation activity rather than the other way around .",
    "among these are d4000 and colour .",
    "of more interest are those parameters that may have some direct effect on star formation such as @xmath81 , @xmath80 , hubble type and size .",
    "we have found that the stellar mass correlates well with the sfr , a result found previously for a much smaller sample by .",
    "this is quite likely because even though the gas _ fractions _ of galaxies decline with increasing mass , the total gas masses still increase as a function of mass @xcite .",
    "because of this overall correlation , the sfr density distribution functions are rather similar to the mass density distribution functions discussed by @xcite .",
    "we find that the majority of star formation takes place in high surface brightness disk - dominated galaxies spanning a range of concentrations .",
    "these span a broad range of masses , peaking for galaxies slightly less massive than @xmath8 and with half - light radii around 3 kpc .",
    "the star forming gas has typically solar or slightly super - solar metallicity .",
    "our most striking result is contained in figure  [ fig : sfr_dens_fig1 ] , which shows that the majority of star formation in the local universe takes place in massive galaxies .",
    "this is a robust prediction of hierarchical models and the shape of our distribution matches that of @xcite ( although these authors show @xmath92 versus the halo mass ) .",
    "this clearly warrants a more in - depth comparison and we will follow this up in a forthcoming paper .",
    "another interesting question is whether star formation in the local universe is predominantly bursty or relatively quiescent . as we saw in figure",
    "[ fig : mstar_vs_b ] , the answer depends strongly on the mass of the galaxy .",
    "it is safe to say , however , that the vast majority of star formation in the local universe takes place in galaxies that are not undergoing extreme starbursts .",
    "quantitatively we find that 28% of @xmath92 comes from galaxies with sfr@xmath97 and 50% at sfr@xmath98 , but only 3% of @xmath92 comes from galaxies with sfr@xmath99 .",
    "the traditional definition of star bursts is however @xmath100@xmath101 and with that definition around 20% of the local sfr density takes place in star bursts .",
    "we should caution that our method of inferring the sfr from optical emission lines is likely to miss part of the sfr occurring in extremely dusty fir - dominated galaxies .",
    "given that such systems are very rare at low redshifts , this does not significantly affect our results .",
    "although ir - luminous galaxies are rare in the local universe , most local star formation occurs in galaxies with substantial optical attenuation in their central parts .",
    "it is important to realise that this quantity might suffer from aperture biases so the galaxy averaged attenuation could be lower .",
    "the relationship between dust attenuation and sfr activity has been discussed by many authors .",
    "the most recent discussion is given by @xcite for a subsample of our sdss data .",
    "our results are in good agreement with theirs .",
    "our main result is that the sfr - weighted dust attenuation at h@xmath13  is @xmath102 magnitudes , with a good correlation between dust attenuation and sfr .",
    "the exact relationship between dust and star formation remains unclear .",
    "we see evidence for a strong correlation between stellar mass and dust attenuation , presumably reflecting a correlation between metallicity and dust content .",
    "the correlation between sfr and dust may simply reflect a more fundamental correlation between dust and metallicity .",
    "this question clearly merits further investigation .",
    "another consequence of the moderately strong dust attenuation present in most galaxies is that the colours of the galaxies that dominate the sfr density have intermediate values  this is why we needed a second colour to get a good constraint on star formation activity in section  [ sec : aperture_effects ] .    to isolate the influence of other factors that may regulate the star formation",
    ", it is clearly necessary to take out the dominant trend with mass .",
    "one should probably normalise by the mass of the gas reservoir , but as this information is not available we have normalised by stellar mass .",
    "previous studies by and @xcite have shown that sfr@xmath103 correlates with mass .",
    "we confirm this trend .",
    "the median value of @xmath50 is fairly constant over a wide range at low masses and then decreases smoothly at masses greater than @xmath104 .",
    "the simplest interpretation is that low mass galaxies form stars at an approximately constant rate , whereas the star formation history is increasingly peaked towards earlier times for more massive galaxies .",
    "these trends have arguably been seen before .",
    "they agree with the `` downsizing '' scenario of @xcite .",
    "what has not been apparent up to now is the fact that the extremes of the distribution change noticeably .",
    "as we go up in mass , there are fewer and fewer galaxies with very high @xmath50 and a corresponding tail towards low @xmath50 starts to appear .    it is clear from the previous section that no single factor stands out as controlling @xmath50 .",
    "this is not entirely surprising since the properties we have used are simple and somewhat limited .",
    "it might turn out that more detailed properties correlate better with @xmath9 , for example lopsidedness @xcite , local density @xcite or merging state ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we will study these relations further in future work .",
    "we mentioned previously that the @xmath58 value for the sample as a whole provides a strong constraint on the star formation history of the universe .",
    "this has been discussed in some detail by @xcite , but that study did not use a sfh that is compatible with look - back studies ",
    "it assumed an exponential star formation history for all galaxies .",
    "our @xmath61 value with our cosmology corresponds to an effective @xmath105gyr ( including systematic errors ) if one considers the whole universe to have an exponential sfh .",
    "we will however adopt the parameterisation of the sfh of the universe used by @xcite .",
    "in general form this reads @xmath106 $ } \\\\        ( 1+z)^\\beta & \\mbox{for $ z < z_d$ } \\\\        0 & \\mbox{for $ z > z_c$}\\\\      \\end{array }    \\right.,\\ ] ] where we will adopt @xmath107 , @xmath108 to be consistent with @xcite and @xcite .",
    "those authors showed that the local `` cosmic spectrum '' is well fit by a model with @xmath109 and @xmath110 .    to calculate @xmath61 for the sfh defined by equation  ( [ eq : sfh_formula ] ) we simply integrate over time and define @xmath111 with @xmath112 being the age of the universe at @xmath6 .",
    "this , together with equation  ( [ eq : sfh_formula ] ) , then gives the present to past - average sfr for the model @xmath113    it is interesting to note that because of the way we measure @xmath82 and the sfr , there is a dependence on the hubble parameter in our @xmath9 value calculations .",
    "that dependence cancels out in equation  ( [ eq : sfh_formula ] ) . to constrain @xmath13 and @xmath95",
    "we thus need a prior on @xmath114 .",
    "we will take the simple approach and choose @xmath62 .",
    "we use the constraint on @xmath61 given in equation  ( [ eq : present_to_past_total ] ) .     and",
    "@xmath95 ( see equation  [ eq : sfh_formula ] ) from the @xmath61 value calculated for our sample . the solid line shows the locus of @xmath115 whereas the dashed line shows the 68% confidence limits from the likelihood distributions and the dotted the locus of our conservative systematic error estimates.,width=317 ]    figure  [ fig : alpha_beta_constrains ] shows the resulting constraints on @xmath13 and @xmath95 .",
    "since the @xmath61 value only constrains the @xmath6 value of the sfr and the integral under the curve , there is a strong degeneracy even with a fixed functional form .",
    "this degeneracy can not be lifted without independent constraints , but it is still of considerable interest . most noticeably it is clear that any really strong evolution , @xmath116 , at @xmath39 is excluded by the current data .    the dotted lines in figures  [ fig : alpha_beta_constrains ] show the effect of systematic uncertainties on these constraints ( for simplicity we have symmetrised these ) .",
    "the dashed lines show the purely statistical errors ( 1@xmath87 ) .",
    "it is clear that if we could remove all systematic uncertainties , the method would give a very powerful constraint on the star formation history of the universe .",
    "it is therefore worth asking what is required to further reduce the systematic uncertainties .",
    "a thorough test of our aperture corrections using resolved spectroscopy would substantially reduce the systematic uncertainty in our sfr estimates . to reduce uncertainties due to evolution , one could limit oneself to a narrow range in redshift , but that would mean a corresponding increase in the uncertainty in extrapolating to faint galaxies . alternatively , it might be possible to directly constrain the evolution inside the sample , but that is a rather delicate operation due to the complex aperture effects .",
    "we have postponed this to a later paper .",
    "systematic uncertainties notwithstanding , the results presented here provide remarkably good constraints on the cosmic star formation history using only data at @xmath117 .",
    "it is clear that a similar study carried out at higher redshift will be of great interest and provide a very interesting complement to recent studies of the mass - assembly of the universe @xcite .    in general it",
    "is our firm belief that future studies of high redshift data should try as far as possible to study the evolution of the full distribution functions in question rather than summarising the distributions to a single value .",
    "as we have seen , important changes might occur in the tails of the distributions with little influence on the median value .",
    "these physically interesting details can only be extracted through the use of distribution functions .",
    "it has been standard to study luminosity functions . with the techniques introduced in the present paper",
    "it is now possible to extend the analysis to a wide variety of distribution functions .",
    "this has been possible due to the unprecedented dataset provided by the sdss survey .",

    "throughout this paper we use the full likelihoods of all parameters .",
    "this means that in many situations it is necessary to combine likelihood distributions . for the benefit of the reader we summarise some of the most important results here .",
    "we will use standard notation and write e.g. @xmath118 for the likelihood of a value @xmath18 in the likelihood distribution @xmath119 .",
    "thus we represent the addition of two likelihood distributions as @xmath120 .",
    "this sum is discussed in most introductory statistics textbooks and the well know result is that @xmath121 where the latter equality is valid in the case of independent variables .    in the present work",
    "we do not often use the straight addition of distributions .",
    "the general case is not normally given in statistics textbooks .",
    "it is however easy to derive .",
    "we will focus our attention on the cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) @xmath122 . in the continuous case",
    "this is given as @xmath123 where @xmath124 is the region where the constraint @xmath125 is fulfilled .",
    "if we write the general composition of two likelihood distributions as @xmath126 then the constraint @xmath127 translates into @xmath128 . for well - behaved distributions we can invert this to write @xmath129 . in general we can then write @xmath130    a simple change of variable presents itself and by setting @xmath131",
    "we get @xmath132 with @xmath133 being the jacobian of the variable transformation . by taking the derivative of this we can get the likelihood distribution @xmath118 : @xmath134 which can be evaluated for",
    "any given @xmath135 .",
    "the extension to discrete distribution functions is straightforward ( see below ) .    as an example we can take the addition of two likelihood distributions for the sfr which we need for the aperture corrections .",
    "here we have @xmath136 since the likelihood distributions are in log space . thus calculating the jacobian and writing it as a discrete distribution @xmath137    this formalism extends fairly straightforwardly to the iterated composition of many ( independent ) likelihood distributions @xmath138",
    "\\ldots \\nonumber \\\\    & & f_{x_n}\\left[h_n(x_{n-1 } , x_n)\\right ] \\left[\\prod_{i=2}^{n }    \\left|\\frac{\\partial h_i}{\\partial x_i}\\right|\\right ] d^n x_i,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] but this is not a practical approach for arbitrary likelihood distributions due to combinatorial explosion ( the sum / integral has to be done over all combinations of variables that combine to a particular value of @xmath18 ) .",
    "instead it is easier in this situation to calculate the combined likelihood distribution in an approximate manner by carrying out a monte carlo sampling of the distributions . in this case",
    "we first form the cdf , @xmath139 , for each galaxy .",
    "we then draw , for each galaxy , a random number , @xmath140 , between 0 and 1 and solve @xmath141 numerically using linear interpolation .",
    "we use the latter approach for instance when evaluating the star formation density of the local universe .",
    "the main disadvantage of a monte carlo approach is that one needs to carry out a large number of repetitions to ensure a sufficient sampling of the final likelihood distribution and to estimate the confidence intervals with good accuracy .    before continuing we would like to emphasise a technical issue which is of considerable importance for some combinations of likelihood distributions : ignoring the likelihood distribution of a particular variable ( in effect setting its error to zero ) will in general _ bias _ the estimate of any combination of this variable with any other unless they are both gaussians .",
    "a specific example relevant for our work is the ratio of two variables whose likelihood distributions are kept in log space .",
    "in particular the calculation of @xmath50 in section  [ sec : spec_sfr ] falls into this category .",
    "here we have @xmath142 where @xmath143 is the likelihood distribution of the stellar mass and @xmath144 that of the sfr . if we now for illustrative purposes assume that these are gaussian in _ log _ space : @xmath145 and likewise for @xmath146 then a straightforward calculation gives us that the mean of @xmath119 @xmath147 can be written @xmath148    clearly setting @xmath149 would bias the average value for the specific sfr in this situation .",
    "the exact amount depends on the details of the likelihood distribution and the bias could vanish entirely . in practice ( as mentioned in section  [ sec : spec_sfr ] ) we find that for the calculation of the specific sfr , ignoring the uncertainty in @xmath82 would bias our results about 15% high .",
    "finally we would like to mention the various ways one can summarise a distribution and what we typically use ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the * average * is the simplest as it is calculated as @xmath150 since @xmath151 is normalised to a total of one .",
    "the mode is equally simple @xmath152 in the event of a tie we use the smallest value satisfying the criterion .",
    "these two , but in particular the mode are affected by the binning chosen for the likelihood distributions .",
    "more commonly used in the present paper are the percentiles of the distributions , defined in the standard way as @xmath153 where @xmath154 is the cdf , @xmath140 is the percentile  @xmath155 gives the median , @xmath156 and @xmath157 give the upper and lower `` @xmath158 '' limits chosen and @xmath159 is the value to solve for .    to avoid severe binning effects ( in particular for the extremes of the distributions ) we calculate these percentiles by solving equation  ( [ eq : def_percentiles ] ) using linear interpolation between grid points .",
    "in this situation we interpolate the cdf and this is a robust procedure . for the average",
    "a straight application of equation  ( [ eq : average_likelihoods ] ) would require interpolation of the probability density function ( pdf ) which might depend sensitively on the interpolation scheme .",
    "instead we calculate the average by interpolating the cdf and drawing @xmath160 realisations of this for each galaxy and calculating the average from this .",
    "we have experimented with different numbers of realisations and interpolation schemes and found that the estimate of the average so calculated is robust to these changes within the accuracy needed for our project .",
    "we will here discuss , briefly , the contribution of supernova remnants ( snrs ) and planetary nebulae ( pne ) to the overall emission line flux of galaxies .",
    "the snrs are interesting in their own right , but due to their short lifetime and the fact that they co - exist with star forming regions they are unlikely to affect the line - radiation significantly .",
    "this is borne out in studies of resolved hii - regions in the lmc @xcite which show that snrs only affect the emission line spectra at a fairly low level .",
    "as discussed by cl01 , the contribution of pne to the line radiation can be ignored in galaxies with active star formation , however in the current work we have galaxies with very low h@xmath13-luminosities and it is therefore necessary to ask if these fluxes can come from pne .",
    "it is straightforward to assess this as the pne [ o iii]5007  luminosity function seems to be universal ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "we can therefore use this to determine the [ o iii]5007-flux from the pne population in a given galaxy . using the pne lf in @xcite",
    "we find that the maximum contribution to the total [ o iii]5007-flux of the sample by pne is of the order of 1.5% .",
    "this is in general totally negligible in comparison with other sources of uncertainty , but it is worth noting that we do predict that among galaxies with very weak emission lines , @xmath161 in [ o iii]5007 , around 20% of the galaxies could have pne contributing more than 20% of the [ o iii]5007-flux thereby complicating studies of galaxies with very weak emission lines . since the [ o iii]5007/h@xmath13  ratio in pne is in general considerably larger than for star forming galaxies , the effect on h@xmath13  and hence the star formation estimates , is therefore entirely negligible except at @xmath162 in h@xmath13",
    "so has no effect whatsoever for our results here .    a significant amount , typically 3050% , of the emission line flux in galaxies comes from the diffuse ionized gas ( dig * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this is implicitly taken into account by the cl01 models because as cl01 show the combination of the ( low - ionization ) dig and the ( higher ionization ) hii - regions is typically represented by a lower effective ionization parameter ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "although we do not explicitly incorporate leaky hii - regions as done by e.g.   @xcite , we can produce similar line - ratios by changing @xmath163 .",
    "thus the models do not need any extra component to take into account dig and as long as the dig is heated by ob stars as seems necessary , its presence should not bias our sfr estimates .",
    "the interpretation of the fitted ionization parameter and dust - to - metal ratio is more complex and we will discuss this issue in more detail in an upcoming paper ."
