    "that is , even in the normal state , strong pairing fluctuations in the bcs - bec crossover region that are enhanced by the two dimensionality of the system also lead to the enhancement of @xmath3 around the temperature which was experimentally identified as the bkt phase transition temperature @xmath5 .",
    "this indicates that further experimental studies are needed to confirm that the system is really in the bkt phase below @xmath5 .",
