    "gravitational waves ( gw ) , as a prediction of general relativity , have not been detected directly .",
    "it is very interesting and important to search the gw both on experiments and theories .",
    "gw carry away energy .",
    "thus , one of most important theoretical predictions of gw is that it causes the orbital decay of binary system .",
    "this is first observed in psr 1913 + 16 @xcite .",
    "gw could cause fluctuations of space .",
    "various detectors that based on this property of gw are constructed or proposed to search the gw in different frequency bands .",
    "it includes pulsar timing arrays ( @xmath14hz)@xcite , space - based interferometers such as elisa ( @xmath15hz ) @xcite , ground - based interferometers such as ligo ( @xmath16hz)@xcite .    the standard cosmological model , i.e. the @xmath17cdm model @xcite is consistent with several precise astronomical observations that involve wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) @xcite , planck satellite @xcite , supernovae cosmology project @xcite and etc .",
    "however , the relic gravitational waves ( rgw ) that were produced in the inflationary stage @xcite of the universe have not been detected .",
    "the rgw that could generate b - mode polarizations of cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb ) have very low frequency ( @xmath18hz ) .",
    "the recent joint analysis of bicep2/keck array and planck data ( bkp ) @xcite gives severe constraints on b - mode polarizations of cmb .",
    "it gives an upper limit for tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath19 , i.e. @xmath20 at 95% confidence level at the pivot scale @xmath21 .",
    "the inflation model tells us that the rgw have a broad range spreading spectrum , from @xmath22hz to @xmath23hz , where the lower and upper bounds of frequency correspond to the current hubble radius ( @xmath24 ) and the vacuum energy scale during inflation ( @xmath25gev ) , respectively @xcite .",
    "thus , it is expected that gw detectors  ligo and elisa could catch some information of rgw . at present ,",
    "ligo s5 @xcite give the most severe constraint on energy density of rgw , i.e. , @xmath26 around @xmath27hz .",
    "the power spectrum of primordial tensor perturbations that is associated with rgw can be parameterized as @xcite @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the amplitude of power spectrum of primordial scalar perturbations , @xmath6 is the tensor spectral index and @xmath30 is the pivot scale . in the canonical single - field slow - roll inflation models , @xmath6 satisfies the consistency relation , i.e. , @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "it means @xmath32 .",
    "however , certain inflation models or its alternative models , such as inflation with axion potential @xcite and the ekpyrotic model @xcite , predict a blue tensor spectra , namely , @xmath1 .",
    "thus , the tensor spectral index @xmath6 can be used to distinguish different inflation models and alternatives . in ref .",
    "@xcite , by combining the data of bkp and ligo , it yields a constraint on @xmath6 , namely , @xmath33 at the 68% confidence level .",
    "one can find from the formula ( [ tensor spectrum ] ) that the power spectrum of primordial tensor perturbations @xmath0 varies rapidly in high frequency region .",
    "thus , high frequency gw detector could give more severe constraint on tensor spectral index @xmath6 if @xmath1 .",
    "li @xcite has designed a gw detector that is focused on detection of gw at high frequency gw spectra ( @xmath34hz ) .",

    "li s high frequency gw detector can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this letter",
    ", we will use the data of planck satellite @xcite to show the amplitude of rgw in high frequency region ( @xmath35hz ) .",
    "then , we will use the amplitude of rgw to obtain the experimental signals in f .- y .",
    "li s gw detector .",
    "the energy density of rgw is given as @xcite @xmath36 where @xmath37mpc is the conformal time at present epoch , @xmath38 is the hubble constant and the dot denotes the derivative with respect to cosmic time @xmath39 . here , the @xmath40 in formula ( [ density rgw ] ) that represents tensor transfer function can be approximately described as @xcite @xmath41 where @xmath42 denotes the matter density parameter at present epoch , @xmath43 corresponds to the hubble radius at matter - radiation equality and @xmath44 denotes the reduced hubble constant .",
    "we can obtain the time derivative of tensor transfer function from equation ( [ transfer f ] ) .",
    "it is given as @xmath45 by making use of the tensor transfer function ( [ transfer f ] ) , we obtain the amplitude of rgw at present @xmath46    in this letter , to focus on the effect of tensor spectral index @xmath6 , we fix the value of tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath47 to investigate high frequency rgw .",
    "only the frequency band of rgw that range from @xmath48hz to @xmath23hz belongs to the detective region of high frequency detector @xcite .",
    "thus , we investigate the rgw in this frequency band . in fig.[fig :",

    "s high frequency gw detector @xcite applies the electromagnetic perturbation effects that produced by high frequency gw to detect gw .",
    "the designed experimental device is embedded in a cavity .",
    "it is constituted by a gaussian beam ( gb ) that passing through a static magnetic field .",
    "the power of gb is @xmath59w , and its frequency mode is given as @xmath60 where @xmath61 denotes the amplitude of gb , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 denotes the minimum spot radius and @xmath66 denotes the curvature radius of the wave fronts of the gb at @xmath67 .",
    "the static magnetic field @xmath68 is designed to be @xmath59 t and pointing along the @xmath69-axis .",
    "it is localized in the region @xmath70 , where @xmath71 . the gb ( [ gb ] ) does not have electric field that points @xmath67-axis . for simplicity , we set background electric field @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "thus , from the maxwell s equation , one can obtain @xmath74 while the high frequency gw that propagate along @xmath67-axis pass through the cavity , they will produce perturbed electromagnetic field .",
    "if the frequency of gw @xmath51 equals to the frequency of gb @xmath75 , the coherent effect magnifies the effect of gb and produces the transverse perturbative photon flux .",
    "it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the transverse perturbative photon flux that propagates along @xmath76-axis is larger than the one that propagates along other directions . in this letter",
    ", we only focus on investigating the transverse perturbative photon flux that propagates along @xmath76-axis .    the dynamics of the electromagnetic system in cavity should satisfy the electromagnetic equations in curved spacetime @xcite , since the spacetime is fluctuated by gw .",
    "these electromagnetic equations can be solved by perturbed approach for the amplitude of gw is very small . by making use of the solutions of these electromagnetic equations , one can obtain the background photon irradiance and the transverse perturbative photon irradiance .",
    "the background photon irradiance along @xmath76-axis is given as @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the vacuum permeability .",
    "the transverse perturbative photon irradiance along @xmath76-axis is given as @xmath79 where the perturbed electric field @xmath80 that is generated from the gw is given as @xmath81+\\frac{i}{4}\\exp[i(k_ez+\\omega_et)]\\right),\\ ] ] and @xmath82 denotes the speed of light .",
    "the background photon flux along @xmath76-axis and the transverse perturbative photon flux along @xmath76-axis can be derived from the equations ( [ nx0],[nx1 ] ) .",
    "they are given as @xmath83 where thetypical receiving surface \" @xmath84 of the high frequency gw detector equals @xmath85 , i.e. , @xmath86 , @xmath87 .    the transverse perturbative photon flux @xmath88 is shown in fig.[fig : nx1 ] .",
    "the ratio of the transverse perturbative photon flux @xmath9 to the background photon flux @xmath57 , i.e. @xmath58 , describes the basic feature of high frequency gw detector .",

    "the signal and background photon fluxes also have other different physical behaviors in specific local regions , such as different flux distribution , propagating direction , phase , wave impedance , decay rate , etc .",
    "these distinctive behaviors would provide a potential way to remove the background photon flux away from the observed photon flux .",
    "the noise in high frequency gw detector plays an important role in detecting gw . in order to detect gw ,",
    "the ratio of signal to noise should be large enough .",
    "for example , thermal noise can be roughly estimated by @xmath91 ( @xmath92 is boltzmann constant and @xmath93 is the temperature of thermal noise ) .",
