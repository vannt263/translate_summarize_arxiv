    "thanks to the @xmath0 factories , remarkable progress in the testing of the kobayashi  maskawa @xcite mechanism of cp violation could be made over the recent years .",

    " maskawa ( ckm ) matrix by the ckmfitter @xcite and utfit @xcite collaborations show impressive global agreement with the picture of the standard model ( sm ) , although it is no longer perfect , with some tension in the corresponding plots and correlations .    the theoretical tool for the description of weak decays and particle  antiparticle mixing is given by low - energy effective hamiltonians . in this framework ,",

    "the long - distance physics resides in the hadronic matrix elements of local operators .    in this formalism",
    ", there are two possibilities for new physics ( np ) to enter : ( i ) modification of @xmath8 , where the np pieces @xmath9 may involve new cp - violating phases ; ( ii ) new operators may enter the stage : @xmath10 , involving , in general , new sources of flavour and cp violation .",
    "many specific np analyses can be found in the literature . in general",
    ", they suffer from the problem that the choice of the np model is governed by personal  biases \" , and that the predictivity is inversely proportional to the number of np parameters .",
    "however , the central problem for the resolution of np effects in weak processes is related to hadronic uncertainties .",
    "concerning non - leptonic @xmath0 decays , interesting progress could recently be made , as discussed in the talks by a. khodjamirian and z. ligeti , although the data show that the theoretical challenge remains .",
    "fortunately , the @xmath0-meson system offers various powerful strategies to circumvent the calculation of the hadronic matrix elements that can be implemented at the @xmath0 factories and later on at the lhc . in these methods , amplitude relations ( exact or derived from qcd flavour symmetries ) or interference effects in decays of neutral @xmath11 mesons ( @xmath5 ) , which may lead to mixing - induced cp violation , are used @xcite .",
    "following these lines , a rich roadmap for the exploration of quark - flavour physics emerges , where popular avenues for np to enter are given by effects at the decay amplitude level or in @xmath3@xmath4 mixing .",
    "at the decay - amplitude level , np effects are small if tree processes of the sm play the dominant role . on the other hand , there are potentially large effects in flavour - changing neutral - current processes through new particles in loop diagrams or new contributions at the tree level . in the following discussion , we address two possible signals for this kind of np contributions : the @xmath1 and @xmath2 systems .      the @xmath12 mode is a @xmath13 penguin process , which is dominated by qcd penguins , but receives also significant electroweak ( ew ) penguin contributions . if we neglect corrections of @xmath14 in the wolfenstein parameter @xmath15 , the ckm structure of the @xmath12 channel implies the following relations for the direct and mixing - induced cp asymmetries : @xmath16 the penguin decay @xmath12 is a sensitive probe for np , so that these relations may well be violated through its impact . during the last years , the babar and belle data have converged , yielding now the following averages @xcite : @xmath17 so that @xmath18 .",
    "the central value of this result could generically be accommodated in extensions of the sm , although the current experimental errors are too large to draw definite conclusions . in order to get the whole picture ,",
    "also @xmath19 observables are required .",
    "such an analysis shows that the @xmath1 data may indicate a modified ew penguin sector with a large cp - violating phase @xcite , complementing the",
    " @xmath2 puzzle \" .",
    "there is a long history of studies of the these decays , and since the year 2000 , the @xmath0-factory data raise the question of a discrepancy with the sm",
    ". this  @xmath2 puzzle \" is reflected by the observables of those decays that are significantly affected by ew penguins , and the following ratios are of central interest : @xmath20\\\\ r_{\\rm n}&\\equiv&\\frac{1}{2}\\left[\\frac{\\mbox{br}(b_d\\to\\pi^\\mp k^\\pm)}{\\mbox{br } ( b_d\\to\\pi^0k)}\\right].\\ ] ] here the ew penguin effects enter through the decays with neutral pions , and are described both by a parameter @xmath21 , which measures the strength of the ew penguins with respect to the tree topologies , and by a cp - violating phase @xmath22 . in the sm , this phase vanishes , and @xmath21 can be calculated with the help of the @xmath23 flavour symmetry . in ref .",
    "@xcite , where also a comprehensive guide to the @xmath2 literature can be found , a systematic strategy for the exploration of the @xmath2 system was developed .",
    "it uses the @xmath0-factory data for @xmath24 decays as the starting point , and determines then the hadronic @xmath2 parameters with the help of the @xmath23 flavour symmetry .",
    "the resulting situation can transparently be discussed in the @xmath25@xmath26 plane , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rnrc ] for the current data @xcite : the shaded areas indicate the sm prediction and the experimental range , the lines show the theory predictions for the central values of the hadronic parameters and various values of @xmath21 with @xmath27 $ ] ; the dashed rectangles represent the sm predictions and experimental ranges at the time of the original analysis of ref .  @xcite . although the central values of @xmath25 and @xmath26 have slightly moved towards each other , the puzzle is as prominent as ever .",
    "the experimental region can now be reached without an enhancement of @xmath21 , but a large cp - violating phase @xmath22 of the order of @xmath28 is still required , although @xmath29 can also bring us rather close to the experimental range of @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",

    "@xcite , also the cp asymmetries of the @xmath30 and @xmath31 modes can be predicted both in the sm and in the scenario of np effects in the ew penguin sector .",
    "the mixing - induced cp asymmetry of the latter decay has recently received a lot of attention , as the current @xmath0-factory data give an experimental value of @xmath32 for the quantity @xmath33 in the strategy described above , this difference is predicted to be _ positive _ in the sm , and in the ballpark of @xmath34@xmath35 .",
    "interestingly , the best values for @xmath36 that are implied by the measurements of @xmath37 make the disagreement of @xmath38 with the data even larger than in the sm .",
    "however , also values of @xmath36 can be found for which @xmath38 could be smaller than in the sm or even reverse the sign .",
    "this happens in particular for @xmath29 , i.e.  if the cp - violating np phase flips its sign . in this case , also the central value of @xmath39 in ( [ s2b - phik ] ) could be straightforwardly accommodated in this scenario of np @xcite , and could in fact be another manifestation of a modified ew penguin sector with new sources for cp violation .",
    "@xmath40 plane . ]",
    "another fruitful testing ground for this scenario is given by the interplay with rare decays such as @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 , which are sensitive probes of @xmath44 penguins .",
    "as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the corresponding observables show specific patterns for np scenarios satisfying the @xmath0-factory constraints from @xmath45 decays , thereby allowing us to pin down a modified ew penguin sector . in these explorations",

    "this spring , @xmath49 could eventually be pinned down at the tevatron : d0 reported a two - sided bound @xmath50 ( 90% c.l . ) , corresponding to a 2.5@xmath51 signal at @xmath52 @xcite , and cdf announced the following result @xcite : @xmath53{\\rm ps}^{-1}.\\ ] ] these new measurements have already triggered considerable theoretical activity ; in the following discussion , we shall focus on the analysis of ref .",

    "if we use an effective hamiltonian to write @xmath54 the mass difference @xmath55 and the cp - violating mixing phase @xmath56 take the forms @xmath57 in the sm , @xmath3@xmath4 mixing arises from box diagrams with top - quark exchanges , yielding @xmath58 the phases of the ckm factors imply @xmath59 in order to determine @xmath60 , which are required for the sm predictions of @xmath55 , we use the unitarity of the ckm matrix to express them in terms of @xmath61 , the side @xmath62 of the unitarity triangle , and its angle @xmath63 .",
    "these quantities can be determined from tree - level processes , which are very robust with respect to np effects . while @xmath64 , the situation of @xmath65 has to be clarified since inclusive and exclusive @xmath66 processes show a discrepancy at the @xmath67 level . for a benchmark scenario of the year 2010 ,",
    "we assume that the inclusive value will be confirmed , with an error of @xmath68 .",

    "the front runners are unquenched calculations with 2 or 3 dynamical quarks and wilson or staggered light quarks , respectively . despite tremendous progress",
    ", the results still suffer from several uncertainties . for the following analysis ,",

    "as specified above with @xmath48 , we obtain @xmath88 where the first and second errors are due to @xmath63 ( and a small extent to @xmath89 ) and @xmath90 , respectively .",
    "further constraints are implied by the experimental value of the mixing phase @xmath91 , which allows us also to determine contours in the @xmath87@xmath86 plane , as shown in ref .",
    "interestingly , it turns out that @xmath86 is bounded from below for any value of @xmath92 .",
    "for example , even a small phase @xmath93 implies a clean lower bound of @xmath94 , i.e.  np contributions of at most 17% .",
    "for the implementation of these constraints , the np phase @xmath95 has to be determined . to this end",
    ", we use the data for the mixing - induced cp violation in @xmath96 and similar modes , which imply @xmath97 . comparing , on the other hand , with the  true \" value of @xmath98 following from @xmath63 and @xmath89",
