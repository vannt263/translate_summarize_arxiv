    "in recent years there is a growing interest to study the evolution of complex networks and to develop models that reflect certain properties of the real networks using some statistical mechanics techniques , graph theory and computer simulations @xcite .",
    "one of the most important properties studied in networks is the degree distribution of nodes which is the probability @xmath2 of a node to have degree @xmath3 .",
    "we can distinguish three main laws of degree distribution : poisson law where @xmath4 , power law with @xmath5 and @xmath6 represents the degree exponent , and exponential law with @xmath7 where @xmath8 is constant .",
    "+ it appears that in nature most networks follow the last two distribution laws referred to above .",
    "barabsi - albert reinvented price s power law degree distribution network by introducing a simplified model based on both growth and preferential attachment .",
    "the resulting scale - free network is widely observed in variety of systems such as publication citation networks , many social networks , protein and gene networks . however , there are other real networks that follow an exponential law , for example , worldwide marine transportation network @xcite , the north american power grid network @xcite , neural network of the c.elegans @xcite , and the email network at the university of rovira i virgili ( enurv ) in spain @xcite .",
    "+ the exponential law seems to be the result of growing network by randomly adding new nodes and links . on the other hand the power law seems to appear when nodes are added to the network one at time and are linked with nodes already well connected .",
    "+ many ideas on the formation of networks have been reviewed in the recent years .",
    "for example , barabsi , in his earlier work , asserted that the preferential attachment and growth are both required to generate a scale - free network @xcite .",
    "actually , it seems that growth is not necessary for such a purpose @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it is intuitive that preferential attachment without rich get richer effect does not generate a scale - free network @xcite .",
    "krapivsky et al .",
    "@xcite have studied non linear preferential attachement with @xmath9 , and they shown that for @xmath10 the mechanism produces a stretched exponential degree distribution .",
    "+ despite many efforts , consistent theory of networks in evolution is still lacking and there is not yet a general principle predicting the topology of a formed network . + aiming to understand the formation and the evolution of complex networks , many models were introduced to investigate the microscopic processes implicated in the resulting network structure .",
    "+ in this context we introduce a simple complex network model growing with linear preferential attachment mechanism and without rich get richer effect.the objective is twofold : first to check if the power law degree distribution remain in the absence of the rich get richer scenario and , second , to see for eventual microscopic differences between scale - free and homogeneous networks .",
    "similarly to the original ba model , our network evolves according to two mechanisms : the growth and the preferential attachment .",
    "nodes entering the network prefer to attach to nodes with low degree , then the probability @xmath11 that one of the links of a new node connects to node i depends on its degree @xmath12 such that @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is a normalization constant . + in connection with social networks ,",
    "if we consider the degree of nodes as describing the wealth of people in a capitalist society , it is known @xcite that we live in a world where rich get richer , but what kind of society we will have if there is no favors to rich people , and there is instead a continuous subvention to poor people ? .",
    "+ to implement our idea , we start with @xmath15 nodes , each one with @xmath16 links . at every time step",
    "we add a new node with @xmath16 edges that link the new node to m different nodes already present in the network .",
    "the probability that the new node is connected to a node @xmath17 of degree @xmath12 is @xmath13 .",
    "the normalization constant @xmath14 is deduced from the condition @xmath18 , which gives @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath20 is the time when the last node was created and represents also the number of nodes added to the network .",
    "+ for this model , the master equation can be written as : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the kronecker symbol .",
    "+ the corresponding stationary equation takes the form : @xmath23 where we used @xmath24 . for large time",
    "we get @xmath25 the above recurrence relation yields the following solution :    @xmath26    although this equation is not in a closed form , numerical estimation of @xmath2 is straightforward as shown in fig .",
    "+ we also simulate the network with sizes up to @xmath27 , initial number of nodes @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the simulation results strongly support the analytical findings ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .    , @xmath29 , @xmath28 , and numerical solution ( solid line ) of eq .  .",
    "in the inset we plot the same data in the log - linear scale . ]",
    "we observed in simulations that @xmath3 remains less than @xmath30 for @xmath31 , we then take @xmath32 in eq .   and",
    "we obtain @xmath33 after normalization we get the exponential degree distribution @xmath34 , with @xmath35 .",
    "the inset in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows the exponential form of @xmath2 and the excellent agreement between simulations and theoretical results .",
    "this clearly confirms that the preferential attachment alone is not sufficient to produce scale - free networks .",
    "we search for differences between heterogeneous and homogeneous networks by comparing our model with the ba model .",
    "the degree distribution alone is not enough to characterize networks .",
    "computing others microscopic quantities may help to have better insight into their evolution and formation .",
    "it turns out that scale - free network has nodes with important degree ( hubs ) , while random network has no apparent structure . evaluating the instantaneous average degree of target node @xmath36 and its fluctuations ,",
    "can give quantitative information about hubs in the network .",
    "in fact , @xmath36 is somehow related to the instantaneous average degree of hubs , because when choosing randomly nodes , hubs have more chance to be selected .",
    "+ firstly , we analyze @xmath36 and @xmath37 in the ba network @xmath38 where @xmath39 , @xmath40 is the time when the node @xmath17 was created , and @xmath41 is the degree of initial nodes at time @xmath20 .",
    "+ solving the mean field equation @xmath42 , we obtain @xmath43 . + inserting the last expression in eq .",
    ", we get @xmath44 where @xmath6 is the euler constant , and @xmath45 . + good agreement is obtained as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) between eq .   and",
    "simulation results even for the first moments of the evolution .",
    "@xmath36 grows indefinitely with time and diverges for infinite network ( or @xmath46 ) due to the fact that , in heterogeneous networks , hubs are more likely to be selected and linked with new nodes .",
    "+ on the other side , the average degree of the network remains finite @xcite since the majority of nodes have a small degree and the weight of hubs is small .     in the ba model",
    ", the solid line represents eq .  .",
    "( b ) evolution of fluctuations of @xmath36 , the solid line represents eq .  .",
    "circles joined by dashed lines in both cases are simulations data averaged over 20 runs for @xmath29 , @xmath28 . ]",
    "the second moment @xmath37 is written as @xmath47 for large time , @xmath48 , we obtain @xmath49 with @xmath50 .",
    "+ fluctuations of @xmath36 are given by @xmath51 , \\label{eq10}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which become arbitrary large when time increases sufficiently .",
    "+ simulation data , in accordance with eq .",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) ) , shows the increasing tendency of fluctuations in @xmath52 .",
    "this can be explained by the fact that the maximum degree in the network @xmath53 increases @xcite faster than @xmath54 ( eq .  ) and the difference between the two quantities becomes greater with time .",
    "+ we now turn to the same analysis in our model .",
    "the mean field evolution equation for @xmath55 gives @xmath56 the solution has the form @xmath57 , \\label{kit}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath58 .",
    "+ the average value of target node @xmath36 is obtained immediately for any time @xmath20 by substituting eq .   into eq .  .",
    "the resulting equation is solved numerically as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) . + for large time and taking @xmath59 , we find @xmath60 , @xmath61 , then @xmath62 this is the value of the node average connectivity of a network growing with uniform attachment resulting in an exponential distribution of degree @xcite .",
    "+ the second moment is obtained by substituting the corresponding expressions of @xmath11 and @xmath55 in eq .  , we get for large time @xmath63 making the approximations @xmath64 , and @xmath65 , we find @xmath66 + fluctuations are @xmath67 .",
    "this finding , together with @xmath68 , show that almost all nodes have the same degree as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) .",
    "the homogeneity of the network can be explained by the fact that the preferential attachment used here does nt allow the formation of hubs , since it neither allows the rich to get richer , nor it enriches the poor .     in our model",
    ", the solid line represents eq .  .",
    "( b ) evolution of fluctuations of @xmath36 , the solid line represents the numerical solution of eq .",
    "and eq .  .",
    "circles joined by dashed lines in both cases are simulations data averaged over 20 runs for @xmath29 , @xmath28 . ]",
    "in this work , we have introduced a simple model of complex network with a preferential attachment criteria and without `` rich get richer '' effect .",
    "the network obtained is homogeneous , which demonstrates the crucial role of the `` rich get richer '' in the topology of the network . giving preferential treatment to the least connected nodes",
    "is equivalent to use a random attachment probability . in terms of social wealth distribution ,",
    "pareto principle @xcite does nt apply and we have instead an exponential distribution of income .",
    "+ computing the instantaneous average degree of a target node and its fluctuations provide more information than the usual average degree of the network , in particular we show how the average degree of hubs and its fluctuations diverge with time in the ba model , and stay finite in our model .",
