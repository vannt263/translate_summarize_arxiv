    "the presence of symmetry breaking in many areas of physics such as particle , atomic and condensed matter physics is indicative of the importance of the phenomenon @xcite . in general , the breakdown of symmetry is an onset of a phase transition which separates phases with different degrees of symmetry @xcite .",
    "a system is in high degree of symmetry at high temperature because it is able to explore all its configurational spaces .",
    "the decrease in temperature will reduce thermal fluctuation and lead the system to stay in some favorable states .",
    "this type of transition with no co - existence phases , therefore no latent heat , is commonly called a continuous phase transition .",
    "a system with initially large number of symmetry elements is more likely to experience sequential phase transitions .",
    "in fact , various magnetic systems exhibit such behavior . the clock spin model in two dimensions , for example ,",
    "whose group symmetry @xmath10 experiences double kosterlitz - thouless transitions for @xmath11 @xcite . in the presence of frustration which induces chiral symmetry @xmath12 ,",
    "another phase transition occurs @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we study the edge - cubic spin model on two dimensions .",
    "the model is one of the discrete counterparts of the continuous - spin , the heisenberg model , of symmetry group ( @xmath13 ) . in two dimension anisotropy",
    "is important as systems with discrete symmetry can have a true long range order at finite temperature .",
    "the octahedral symmetry group @xmath0 of the model , with 48 symmetry elements , consists of some subgroups associated with familiar discrete models , such as the inversion @xmath12 of ising model and the @xmath1 of the chiral 3-state potts model .",
    "any finite ordered phase of the system is expected to be in one of its subgroup symmetries .",
    "while cubic symmetry in magnetic systems is an old subject and appears whenever systems are on real cubic lattice @xcite , cubic spin models have not been studied as much as other discrete models such as ising , potts and clock models .",
    "previous works on cubic symmetries were mostly carried out in the theoretical field approach through the consideration of the @xmath14 hamiltonian in which @xmath15-component anisotropy fields break the continuous @xmath16 symmetry @xcite .",
    "it is well established that for three - dimensional case , the cubic fixed point is stable if @xmath17 , where @xmath18 according to more recent calculations @xcite .",
    "the situation is different in two - dimensional case because the existence of cubic fixed point is still unclear .",
    "recent study by calabrese _",
    "_ could not unravel the speculation that the ising and the cubic fixed points maybe coincide @xcite .    in trying to resolve the speculation of the existence of cubic fixed point in two dimensions , it is of importance to directly probe the spin models with cubic symmetry .",
    "with simple normalized - vector spin on cube , we can have three models i.e , the face - cubic ( 6 states ) , the corner - cubic ( 8 states ) and the edge - cubic spin ( 12 states ) .",
    "very recently , yasuda _ et al . _",
    "@xcite considered a ferromagnetic face - cubic spin model and then found that the model undergoes a single phase transition ; they discussed the universality class of this model in comparison with 4-state potts model .",
    "the corner - cubic spin model is considered as a trivial model of decoupled three independent ising models .",
    "studying the corner - cubic model can not be expected to address the existence of cubic fixed point . however , by weighting the spin orientation , the corner - cubic spin model can transform into a general ashkin - teller model @xcite ; to this respect the model is no longer trivial .",
    "probing the edge - cubic spin model deserves for its own right .",
    "firstly , it is interesting to know the symmetry breaking of the @xmath0 in that model , and also to address the existence of cubic universality class .",
    "since the degree of @xmath0 is high , the edge - cubic model may experience sequential phase transitions .",
    "the remaining part of the paper is organized as follows : section ii describes the model and the method .",
    "the result is discussed in section iii .",
    "section iv is devoted to the concluding remarks .",
    "the edge - cubic spin model is one of the discrete counterparts of the heisenberg model .",
    "spins can point to any of the 12 middle points of the edges of a cube .",
    "an edge of the cube is 2 unit long , and its center of mass @xmath19 is set as the origin of the normalized - vector spin .",
    "here we study the ferromagnetic case on square lattice with periodic boundary condition .",
    "the hamiltonian of the model is expressed as @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a spin on site @xmath22-th , @xmath23 .",
    "summation is performed over all the nearest - neighbor pairs of spins . in the ground state configuration ,",
    "i.e. , when all spins having a common orientation , the energy will be @xmath24 with @xmath25 is the number of spins .     at @xmath26 , where error is larger than the symbol size . ]",
    "we use the canonical monte carlo ( mc ) method with single cluster spin updates due to wolff @xcite and adopt wolff s idea of embedded scheme in constructing a cluster for the edge - cubic spins .",
    "this is done by projecting the spins into a randomly generated plane so that the spins are divided into two groups ( ising - like spins ) .",
    "the embedded scheme is essential in carrying out cluster algorithm for such spins as cubic and planar spins .",
    "after the projection , the usual steps of the cluster algorithm are performed @xcite , i.e. , by connecting bonds from the randomly chosen spin to its nearest neighbors of similar group , with suitable probability .",
    "this procedure is repeated for neighbors of sites connected to chosen spin until no more spins to include .",
    "one monte carlo step ( mcs ) is defined as visiting once the whole spins randomly and perform cluster spin update in each visit .",
    "note that a spin may be updated many times , in average , during one step , in particular near the critical point .",
    "measurement is performed after enough equilibration mcs s ( @xmath27 mcs s ) .",
    "each data point is obtained from the average over several parallel runs , each run is of @xmath28 mcs s . to evaluate the statistical error each run",
    "is treated as a single measurement . for the accuracy in the estimate of critical exponents and temperatures ,",
    "data are collected upto more than 100 measurements for each system size .",
    "the first step in search for any possible phase transition is to measure the specific heat of the system defined as follows    @xmath29    where @xmath30 is the energy in unit of @xmath31 while @xmath32 represents the ensemble average of the corresponding quantity .",
    "all temperatures are expressed in unit of @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the boltzmann constant .        as shown by the specific heat plot in fig .",
    "[ spht ] , there exist a peak at lower temperature and a hump at higher temperature .",
    "although the peak and the hump are more directly related to energy fluctuation , they may signify the existence of sequential phase transitions . in",
    "what follows , more quantitative analysis is performed through the evaluation of the order parameters .",
    "the critical properties of the system are quantified by the critical temperatures and exponents extracted from the finite size scaling ( fss ) of the order parameters , in particular from their moment and correlation ratios . as the probed system is ferromagnetic we consider magnetization @xmath35 as the order parameter . by defining @xmath36 as the @xmath37-th order moment of magnetization and @xmath38 as correlation function ,",
    "the moment and correlation ratios are respectively written as follows @xmath39 precisely , the distance @xmath40 for the correlation function @xmath41 is a vector quantity , here we take the simple form and choose convenient distances @xmath42 and @xmath43 , both in @xmath44- and @xmath45-directions .",

    "vs @xmath46 for several values of correlation ratio @xmath47 s .",
    "the best estimate of @xmath48 is the slope of the best - fitted line of @xmath49 associated with critical temperature . ]",
    "more accurate estimate of parameters of phase transition is obtained from the temperature dependence of @xmath50 and @xmath47 . at very low temperature where system is approaching the ground state , both moment and correlation ratio",
    "are trivial . due to the absence of fluctuation ,",
    "the distribution of @xmath51 is a delta - like function , giving moment ratio equals to unity .",
    "correlation ratio also goes to unity as correlation function for small and large distance is the same due to highly correlated states . in excited states ,",
    "the moment and the correlation ratios are not trivial , they depend on temperature . the plot of moment ratio for various system sizes , shown in fig .",
    "[ ratio_m](a ) , exhibits a clear crossing point which indicates a phase transition . at low temperature side , there exists a cusp which may corresponds to another phase transition . a possibility that system has additional phase transition at low temperature ,",
    "apart from an obvious one at high temperature , is also signified by the plot of correlation ratio shown in fig .",
    "[ ratio_m](b ) .",
    "we show the fss plot of moment and correlation ratios in fig .",
    "[ binder_m_s ] ; we estimate critical temperature and exponents from both ratios which give consistent results , with only difference smaller than estimated statistical error .",
    "the estimate of @xmath52 obtained from moment ratio is @xmath53 , slightly smaller than @xmath54 from the correlation ratio .",
    "the number in bracket is the uncertainty in the last digit . in general",
    ", moment ratio has larger correction to scaling than the correlation ratio @xcite , which happens to be the case here .",
    "however , if the variables of the two correlation functions are not local quantity , in the sense they depend on another quantity , then the correlation ratio may have larger correction to scaling .",
    "our estimate of @xmath52 is based on result obtained from the correlation ratio .",
    "the estimates of the decay exponent of the correlation length both give the same results , i.e. , @xmath55 .",
    "the subscript is used for the reminder that we are dealing with the high-@xmath2 transition .    in addition to the exponent @xmath56 ,",
    "it is possible to extract the decay exponent @xmath57 of the correlation function from the correlation ratio .",
    "this is done by firstly looking at the constant value of correlation ratio @xmath47 for different sizes and then find the corresponding correlation function @xmath58 .",
    "the correlation function is in power - law dependence on the system size , @xmath59 @xcite .",
    "therefore , if we plot @xmath58 versus @xmath46 for various @xmath47 s in logarithmic scale , as in fig .",
    "[ eta_ord1 ] , the value of @xmath57 will correspond to the gradient of the best - fitted line for each constant of correlation ratio .",
    "there are several lines plotted in fig .",
    "[ eta_ord1 ] . since the critical temperature is associated with the value of @xmath60 ( fig .",
    "[ ratio_m](b ) ) , we assign @xmath48 as the best estimate .",
    "although there is an indication of low temperature transition , at this stage we do not estimate its critical quantities due to the absence of a crossing point .",
    "we need to formulate a more suitable order parameter able to distinguish the intermediate and the low temperature ordered phase . in the next section",
    ", we present the snapshot series of total magnetization and discuss the order parameter of characterizing low temperature transition .",
    "the total vector magnetization is computed for every snapshot spin configuration .",
    "a snapshot magnetization is represented by a dot that is the intersection of the line parallel to the magnetization and the cube surface .",

    "the linear size of the lattice is @xmath63 . ]    for simplicity , we make suitable mirror projection of the total magnetization so that its orientation is in the region of the three outer sides of the 1/8 cube .",
    "we further project the surface of the 1/8 cube on to a triangle as shown in fig .",
    "the inner triangle is associated with the plane made by three edge - points ( ( 101 ) , ( 110 ) and ( 011 ) ) in fig .",
    "each pair of these points together with a middle point of sides viewable from the corner point ( 111 ) construct three other outer triangles .",
    "the phase of the system is related to spin configuration . at high temperatures , due to large thermal fluctuation ,",
    "each spin is relatively free to point to any direction , therefore no common orientation of the total magnetization . as a result",
    ", the snapshot point will occupy the whole area of four triangles .",
    "this is indicated by the fig .",
    "[ snap ] with @xmath64 .",
    "as we reduce the temperature , the thermal fluctuation starts being overcome by the magnetic interaction .",

    "three neighboring orientations around a particular corner of the cube are chosen ; the octahedral symmetry @xmath0 is completely broken .",
    "the symmetry group associated with the intermediate phase is the point group @xmath1 , realized for example by the 3-state potts model .",
    "as the temperature is further reduced , this symmetry breaks down into a ground state with all spins pointing to the same direction , shown by the figure with @xmath67 .",

    "error bar is in the order of symbol size . ]",
    "based on the snapshot of magnetization , we define an order parameter related to population numbers .",
    "it is formulated from the fact that at each microscopic state , spins will be pointing to 12 possible orientations . the difference between maximum population among the 12 orientations and",
    "the second largest is assigned as the order parameter which is written as follows @xmath68 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the largest and the second largest population numbers , respectively .    at ground state",
    "the value of this order parameter will be just @xmath25 because all @xmath25 spins are in a common alignment .",
    "in contrast , at high temperature , the value of the order parameter is very small and vanishing in the thermodynamic limit , as the 12 possible orientations are occupied by approximately equal number of spins .",
    "figure [ ni ] shows the temperature dependence of the 12 population numbers @xmath69 .",
    "one could choose another quantity as an order parameter , but eq . [ ordp2 ] is simple and straightforward .",
