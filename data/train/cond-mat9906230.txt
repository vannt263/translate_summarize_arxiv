    "the local density approximation ( lda ) provides a powerful practical technique to apply the kohn - sham framework@xcite to interacting many body problems .",
    "a problem of this method is unphysical self interaction , _",
    "i.e. _ the interaction of a particle with itself .",
    "perdew and zunger@xcite proposed a prescription to remedy this shortcoming , which has been used for atoms@xcite , molecules@xcite , bulk systems@xcite and also metal clusters@xcite . though there still remain some effects of self interaction , the major part of the problem is removed in this method .",
    "compared with the hartree - fock theory , which is free from the self interaction problem , the local density approximation with the self interaction correction ( sic ) has advantages such as , i ) exchange and correlation energies can be relatively easily handled in the same manner , ii ) the resultant single particle energies well approximate the physical removal energy from each orbit , iii ) the numerical calculation is much lighter , especially for three dimensional calculations .",
    "a characteristic feature of the sic method of perdew and zunger is that the energy functional depends not only on the total density , but explicitly also on the density of each single particle orbital . in almost all calculations for closed shell atoms and metal clusters , the single particle densities in the energy functional",
    "are substituted by the spherically averaged densities .",
    "the central single particle potential is then deduced by taking functional derivative of the resultant energy functional with respect to the spherically averaged single particle density . following more closely the original idea of perdew and zunger , on the other hand , harrison @xcite proposed a method of using the original single particle densities without introducing spherical averaging .",
    "since the energy functional is not invariant under unitary transformation of single particle orbitals , harrison represented the single particle orbitals by either spherical harmonics or cartesian basis as two choices .",
    "though the method by harrison works well for atoms@xcite , it has not been tested for metal clusters .",
    "we address this question in this paper by taking na clusters as an example .",
    "we show that it does not work well , especially for large clusters which have single particle orbitals with large angular momentum .",
    "we confine our study to the exchange energy without referring to the correlation energy in order to make the argument clear and compare the results with those of hartree - fock calculations .",
    "we show that a better agreement with the hartree - fock calculations is obtained if one applies harrison s method only to the hartree term .",
    "in addition to the validity of harrison s method , we discuss in this paper the problem of non - diagonal lagrange multipliers originating from the orthonormality of single particle orbitals in the self interaction correction method of perdew and zunger .",
    "we show that the non - diagonal property of the lagrange multipliers introduces a negligible effect to single particle energies as well as the total energy .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec.[sec : formalism ] the sic method of perdew and zunger and harrison s approach are briefly explained . in sec.[sec : ene ] the exchange energies calculated by several sic methods are compared , and the effect of non - diagonal lagrange multipliers is discussed in sec.[sec : ortho ] .",
    "summary and conclusion are given in sec.[sec : summ ] .",

    "i.e. _ @xmath2 .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the correlation energy has been neglected .",
    "we take the effects of ions into account in the spherical jellium model .",
    "the external potential is then given by @xmath3 where the jellium radius @xmath4 is related to the number of atoms in the cluster @xmath5 by @xmath6 , @xmath7 being the bulk wigner - seitz radius which is 4 a.u .",
    "for na .",
    "the euler equation under the orthonormality condition @xmath8 results in the following coupled equations for the single particle wave functions @xmath9 the lagrange multiplier @xmath10 becomes non - diagonal because of the orbital dependence of the self interaction corrected exchange potential . in the following , we approximate it by the diagonal components and solve the following non - coupled equations@xcite @xmath11 we discuss the validity of this approximation in sec . [ sec : ortho ] for na clusters .    as we see in eq.([eq : sicx ] ) the sic method of perdew and zunger is characteristic in that the total energy functional depends explicitly on the individual orbital density .",
    "a consequence is that it loses invariance under the unitary transformation of single particle orbitals .",
    "another problem is that the numerical load is heavy , because one has to solve three - dimensional equations instead of the one - dimensional equations for the radial motion of electrons even for closed shell atoms and metal clusters . in applying this formalism to those systems ,",
    "one usually replaces @xmath12 in the curly brackets in eqs.([eq : sicx ] ) and ( [ eq : vsicx ] ) by the spherically averaged orbital density given by @xmath13 @xmath14 this prescription certainly reduces the numerical load , because the resultant single particle potentials become central potentials .",
    "however , it does not optimize the sic following the original scheme of perdew and zunger .",
    "harrison proposed an alternative procedure , which avoids replacing the single particle densities in the energy functional by spherically averaged ones .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , he expressed them in the spherical harmonic basis @xmath15 or in cartesian basis @xmath16 he noticed that the resultant energy functional can be expressed in terms of the spherically averaged orbital density after the integration over angle , @xmath17    -\\sum_{n , l}2(2l+1)\\left\\{\\sum_{k=0}^{2 l }      e_{h}^{k , l}[\\tilde{\\rho}_{nl } ]      + c_{x}^{l}e_{x}^{\\mathrm{lda}}[\\tilde{\\rho}_{nl},0]\\right\\ } \\ ,    \\label{eq : mex } \\\\",

    "harrison then calculated the corresponding central potential for each set of quantum nembers @xmath20 by taking the functional derivative with respect to the spherically averaged orbital density @xmath21 @xmath22 }    { \\delta \\tilde{\\rho}_{nl}(r ) } \\ .\\label{eq : mv}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    though this method restricts the variational space smaller than that in the original scheme of perdew and zunger since it presumes a spherically symmetric potential from the beginning , harrison showed that his method still improves both the exchange energy and the total energy for atoms compared with the simple procedure where @xmath12 is replaced by the spherically averaged orbital density .",
    "it is an interesting question to see whether harrison s method can be applied to metal clusters .",
    "a simple minded consideration would suggest that harrison s method becomes more powerful in metal clusters .",
    "this is because harrison s treatment should have a large effect on high angular momentum orbitals which play more important roles in metal clusters than in atoms where the main contribution to the sic originates from the @xmath23 state @xcite . in the next section ,",
    "we apply harrison s method to na clusters , and show that it does not work well contrary to the simple expectation .    .the",

    "< , > , > \" , ]      before we conclude the paper we comment on the effects of off - diagonal lagrange multipliers in eq.([eq:1eq ] ) .",
    "we performed calculations by keeping off - diagonal lagrange multipliers for na@xmath25 and na@xmath26 with sa - sicx , sh - sicx and c - sicx .",
    "we found that the differences of the total energy and single particle energy obtained by self - consistently solving eq.([eq:1eq ] ) and eq.([eq : diag1eq ] ) are less than 10@xmath27 ev and 10@xmath28 ev , respectively .",
    "we therefore conjecture that one can safely ignore the off - diagonal components of the lagrange multipliers for na clusters .",
    "this result is consistent with that in ref .",
    "@xcite for atoms .",
    "we have calculated the self interaction corrected exchange energy for na clusters by using spherically averaged , spherical harmonic and cartesian orbital densities .",
    "we found that both calculations using the spherical harmonic and cartesian orbital densities deviate from the hf results more than the calculations with spherically averaged orbital densities .",
    "the deviation is especially large for systems with large angular momentum orbitals .",
    "we attribute this problem to the lda to evaluate the self exchange term . from this consideration",
    ", we propose to use the spherical harmonic and cartesian orbital deinsities only for the self hartree term and to use spherically averaged orbital densities for the self exchange term .",
    "we have shown that this treatment improves indeed the exchange energy to well reproduce the results of hf calculations .",
    "we expect that the remaining errors can be diminished by the sic using gga(generalized gradient approximation ) @xcite .",
