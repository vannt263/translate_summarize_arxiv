    "current models of cosmic structure formation based on cdm scenarios predict that the first collapsed , luminous ( hereafter pop  iii ) objects should form at redshift @xmath2 and have a total mass @xmath3 or baryonic mass @xmath4 ( couchman & rees 1986 , haiman 1997 [ hrl ] , tegmark 1997 ) .",
    "this conclusion is reached by requiring that the cooling time , @xmath5 , of the gas is shorter than the hubble time , @xmath6 , at the formation epoch . in a plasma of primordial composition the only efficient coolant in the temperature range @xmath7",
    "k , the typical virial temperature of pop  iii dark matter halos , is represented by h@xmath8 molecules whose abundance increases from its initial post - recombination relic value to higher values during the halo collapse phase .",
    "it is therefore crucial to determine the cosmic evolution of such species in the early universe to clarify if small structures can continue to collapse according to the postulated hierarchical structure growth or if , lacking a cooling source , the mass build - up sequence comes to a temporary halt .",
    "the appearance of pop  iii objects is now thought to cause a partial destruction of the available molecular hydrogen either in the intergalactic medium ( igm ) and/or in collapsing structures ; the result is a negative feedback on galaxy formation .",
    "this effect has been pointed out by hrl and it works as follows .",
    "as stars form in the very first generation of objects , the emitted photons in the energy band 11.2 - 13.6 ev are able to penetrate the gas and photodissociate h@xmath8 molecules both in the igm and in the nearest collapsing structures , if they can propagate that far from their source .",
    "this negative feedback and its possible limitations are discussed by ciardi , abel & ferrara ( 1998 , caf ) . here",
    "we propose and investigate instead a possible _ positive _ feedback based on supernova ( sn ) explosions , which , under many aspects , is reminiscent of a scaled version of the explosive galaxy formation scenario introduced by ostriker & cowie ( 1981 ) and put forward by many others .",
    "pop  iiis are very fragile due to their low mass and shallow gravitational potential : only a few sne are sufficient to blow - away ( ferrara 1998 ) their baryonic content and drive an expanding blastwave into the igm , which eventually becomes radiative and allows the swept gas to cool in a dense shell .",
    "the cooling transient , as we will see , is characterized by a strong nonequilibrium condition in which recombination lags behind the temperature decrease . as already pointed out by shapiro & kang ( 1987 ) and kang & shapiro ( 1992 )",
    ", this is a favorable condition for h@xmath8 formation .",
    "our conclusions are that the amount of molecular hydrogen thus formed can exceed the one destroyed via photodissociation , yielding a net increase of the h@xmath8 in the universe . as a consequence , not only the galaxy formation process is not halted , but instead it is favored by the effects of pop  iii formation .",
    "2 describes the main properties of multi - sn explosions in the early universe ; sec .",
    "3 is devoted to the calculation of h@xmath8 formation in their cooling shell . in sec .",
    "4 we compare the magnitude of positive and negative feedbacks ; some discussion of the results is given in sec .",
    "the mechanical luminosity of an ob association in a pop  iii object at redshift @xmath9 can be written as ( ciardi & ferrara 1997 , cf ) @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12  ergs is the energy of a sn explosion ; we assume a salpeter imf , according to which one supernova is produced for each 56  @xmath13 of stars formed .",
    "the baryon density parameter is @xmath14 , of which a fraction @xmath15 ( abel 1997b ) is able to cool and become available to form stars .",
    "the dark matter halo mass and density are @xmath16 and @xmath17 $ ]  g  @xmath18 , respectively ( we assume a flat eds universe @xmath19 and @xmath20   km  s@xmath21  mpc@xmath21 ) ; the corresponding free - fall time is @xmath22 ; @xmath23 is the star formation efficiency , calibrated on the milky way .",
    "the correlated sn explosions drive a blastwave in the surrounding gas , which eventually propagates into the igm ; due to their low mass , the effects of pop  iii ism on the blastwave expansion can be neglected ( maclow & ferrara 1998 ) . the evolution of the shock radius , @xmath24 , can be obtained in the thin shell approximation by solving numerically eqs .",
    "( 5)-(6 ) of cf .",
    "for sake of simplicity we use the following ( sedov ) analytical solution of the same equations which holds for the adiabatic case when the external confining pressure and the gravitational pull of the dm halo are neglected : @xmath25 where @xmath26 , @xmath27  yr is the average lifetime of massive stars , @xmath28 is the total energy of the explosion , @xmath29 the igm density at redshift @xmath9 .",
    "[ rs ] does not take into account the effects of hubble expansion , which are negligible since @xmath30 ( see eq .",
    "[ rsc ] ) .",
    "the corresponding temperature of the postshock gas is @xmath31  k. such hot gas will not be able to cool until its cooling time , @xmath5 , becomes smaller than the hubble time , @xmath6 .",
    "the energy losses , @xmath32 , due to gas - radiative processes in a primordial gas are of order @xmath33  ergs  @xmath34  s@xmath21 in the range @xmath35  k ( schmutzler & tscharnuter 1993 ) ; the other relevant cooling agent is inverse compton cooling off cmb photons ( ikeuchi & ostriker 1986 ) . comparing the two rates , it is easily seen that inverse compton dominates the cooling for @xmath36 , for @xmath37  k. the condition @xmath38 requires that @xmath39 ; shocked gas produced at epochs earlier than this will be able to cool and condense in a dense shell behind the shock front .",
    "note that as the temperature drops to lower values with subsequent gas recombination , cooling via hydrogen ly@xmath40 line excitation will start to become important . at @xmath41  gyr ,",
    "the shock radius and postshock gas temperature are respectively @xmath42 @xmath43 these relations hold if the mach number of the shock with respect to the igm sound speed is @xmath44 , a condition verified if the igm has not yet been reheated .",
    "in the following , we calculate the time - dependent , nonequilibrium ionization and molecule abundance evolution behind the multi - sn shock as a function of the object mass and epoch of the explosion .",
    "the postshock cooling gas is assumed to be initially at temperature @xmath45 and density @xmath46 . in hydrogen of density @xmath47",
    "( we neglect he ) , the evolution of the ionization fraction , @xmath48 , molecular fraction , @xmath49 , and temperature , @xmath50 , is determined by the following rate equations : @xmath51    @xmath52 n f\\ ] ]    @xmath53.\\ ] ]    the various rate coefficients @xmath54 are labelled according to the nomenclature given in abel 1997a ( appendix a ) ; @xmath55 is the @xmath56 species number density ; @xmath57 is the specific heat ratio and @xmath58 is the gas pressure . in addition to the standard atomic cooling processes ,",
    "@xmath32 includes compton and @xmath0 cooling ; the latter has been adopted from martin ( 1996 ) .",
    "we assume that no heating is provided to the gas after it has been heated by the shock to the initial temperature and neglect adiabatic cooling due to hubble expansion for reasons similar to those given in the previous section .",
    "the first equation describes the usual collisional ionization ( rate @xmath59 )  recombination ( @xmath60 ) balance .",
    "the equation for @xmath61 is slightly more complicated and we describe it shortly . at the low densities considered here , in the absence of dust ,",
    "@xmath0 is formed in the gas phase mainly via the channel @xmath62 , at rate @xmath63 ( formation via the @xmath64 channel , when included , is found to be negligible in our case ) ; it is then destroyed by one of the following mechanisms : ( i ) it is collisionally ionized by proton impacts ( @xmath65 ) ; ( ii ) it is dissociated by collisions with electrons ( @xmath66 ) and/or h - atoms ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "abel 1997a have shown that using the equilibrium value for @xmath55 is a very good approximation since the reactions determining the @xmath56 abundance occur on a much shorter timescale than those responsible for the @xmath0 chemistry ; therefore we have calculated @xmath55 from their eq . (",
    "also , we note that in the above form , the rate equations correspond to the so - called minimal model described in that paper .",
    "the energy equation has been solved in the isobaric limit ; this approximation is known to be appropriate for the evolution of galactic supernova remnants ( cioffi 1988 ) , where most of the radiative phase is spent at constant pressure ; the same result was found to hold by shapiro & kang ( 1987 ) and kang & shapiro ( 1992 ) for a wide range of shock velocities in a cosmological context .",
    "the numerical solution of the above rate equations are shown in fig",
    ". 1 for two different object masses ( @xmath68 ) and initial redshift ( @xmath69 ) . almost independently on the specific values of these parameters a high @xmath0 fraction ( @xmath70 ) is produced by redshift ten , with a steep increase occurring when the gas has cooled down at @xmath71  k. @xmath0 production is faster in high-@xmath9 , high @xmath72 shocks , but the peak abundance is practically the same in all cases ; the final gas temperature is in the range @xmath73  k. we have also experimented a different @xmath0 cooling function ( hollenbach & mckee 1979 ) : this produces a cooler final state ( @xmath74  k ) but only a marginally different asymptotic value @xmath75 . for comparison ,",
    "we have also plotted in fig .",
    "1 the tegmark 1997 `` rule of thumb '' value @xmath76 at which @xmath0 cooling becomes important .",
    "the results obtained in sec . 3 show that typically at least a @xmath0 fraction @xmath77 is formed after explosive events leading to the blow - away of pop  iiis . as discussed in the introduction",
    ", hrl have argued that the same objects could suppress the surrounding @xmath0 abundance due to their uv photodissociating radiation . in order to evaluate the impact of pop  iiis on the subsequent galaxy formation , largely regulated by the availability of @xmath0 in this mass ( and redshift ) range",
    ", it is useful to compare the @xmath0 mass production vs. destruction .",
    "a lower limit to the amount of @xmath0 produced in an explosion is readily found to be equal to @xmath78 or @xmath79 as shown by caf , the uv / ionizing radiation from pop  iii s massive stars previous to blow - away will produce both a hii region and a region of photodissociated intergalactic @xmath0 ( radius @xmath80 ) in which the object is embedded .",
    "the radius @xmath80 can be defined by requiring that the photodissociation timescale ( @xmath81 , notation as in eqs .",
    "[ xrate]-[frate ] ) is shorter than @xmath6 .",
    "this condition yields the definition @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is the uv photon flux in the @xmath0 lyman - werner ( lw ) bands ( 11.213.6  ev ) , assumed here to be proportional to the flux of lyc photons , @xmath84 , just before the massive stars explode .",
    "the value of the constant @xmath85 depends somewhat on the imf and on the evolutionary stage of the stellar cluster , but its value should be reasonably close to unity . paralleling eq .",
    "[ l ] , we estimate @xmath84 to be @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the uv photon production per collapsed proton efficiency ( tegmark 1994 ) and @xmath88 is the escape fraction of such photons ( absorption can be caused both by interstellar neutral h and/or dust ) .",
    "we have checked that this simple estimate is within a factor of 2 of the value obtained from the recently revised version of the bruzual & charlot ( 1993 ) spectrophotometric code .",
    "the adopted reference value @xmath89 is an upper limit derived from observational ( leitherer 1995 , hurwitz 1997 ) and theoretical ( dove & shull 1994 ) studies .",
    "it follows that @xmath90 where @xmath91 .",
    "thus , the ratio between the @xmath0 mass produced and destroyed by pop  iiis is @xmath92 ^ 3.\\ ] ] the post - recombination relic fraction of intergalactic @xmath0 is estimated to be @xmath93 ( palla 1995 ; anninos & norman 1996 ; lepp , private communication ) . the previous relation is graphically displayed in fig .",
    "2 , along with the values of @xmath94 and @xmath80 . from that plot",
    "we see that objects of total mass @xmath95 produce more @xmath0 than they destroy for @xmath96 ; larger objects ( @xmath97 ) provide a similar positive feedback only for @xmath98 , since they are characterized by a higher @xmath99 ratio .",
    "however , since in a hierarchical model larger masses form later , even for these objects the overall effect should be a net @xmath0 production .",
    "the results obtained in the previous section could be modified by the fact that so far we have neglected the effects of the pop  iii stellar cluster radiation impinging on the cooled shell .",
    "in fact , even after all the sne have exploded blowing - away the gas , the coeval low mass stars will continue to produce some residual flux in the energy range @xmath100  ev , relevant to the @xmath0 formation network .",
    "two processes might have some effect in this context : ( i ) @xmath56 photoionization , and ( ii ) @xmath0 two - step photodissociation .",
    "the first process occurs at a rate @xmath101  s@xmath21 per @xmath56 atom , or @xmath102  s@xmath21 using eqs .",
    "[ rsc ] , [ s ] and reference values for the remaining parameters .",
    "the most effective @xmath103 destruction process among the ones included is @xmath0 formation , whose rate in the same case is @xmath104  s@xmath21 .",
    "thus , photoionization is negligible , and we have checked this conclusion numerically .",
    "we can calculate the effects of two - step photodissociation on the shell as follows .",
    "the shell @xmath0 column density is @xmath105  @xmath106 ( we have assumed that all the swept igm mass is in the cool shell ) .",
    "since the critical column density for self - shielding is @xmath107  @xmath106 ( draine & bertoldi 1997 ) , the shell is optically thick to dissociating radiation .",
    "nevertheless , the flux in the lw bands , @xmath108 , where @xmath109 is the planck constant , will induce a dissociation front in the shell ; @xmath110 is very likely dominating on a possible background radiation .",
    "the propagation speed will be @xmath111 , where @xmath112 is the lw photon mean free path , and @xmath113 is a constant obtained by comparison with numerical results .",
    "thus , the time required to dissociate the entire shell is @xmath114  yr , where @xmath115 , and @xmath116 . since theoretical work ( bruzual & charlot 1993 ) suggests that @xmath85 drops to @xmath117 after all the massive stars ( the main contributors to the uv flux ) have died , dissociating the entire shell will require a very long time , certainly larger than the hubble time .",
    "finally , kang & shapiro ( 1992 ) pointed out that any external _ ionizing _ radiation field ( which could be provided by the hot postshock gas and/or by the residual intermediate mass stars in the cluster ) tends to increase the final value of @xmath61 , although introducing a time delay due to a temperature plateau in the evolution characteristic of photoionization heating .",
    "thus , our estimate seems to provide a robust lower limit to the molecular hydrogen abundance .    how can this @xmath0 enhanced gas be used for galaxy formation ?",
    "first , regions in which pop  iiis are clustered enough for their shells to interact might become sites of active star / galaxy formation .",
    "shell interactions appear to be necessary to make them gravitational unstable , since the temperature required for isolated fragmentation ( couchman & rees 1986 ) is well below the values ( @xmath118  k ) found here .",
    "next , these intergalactic shells can be accreted by neighbor objects , possibly increasing their @xmath0 abundance above the threshold @xmath119 required for efficient cooling ( tegmark 1997 ) .",
    "we conclude that pop  iii objects can produce regions of considerably high molecular hydrogen abundance due to multi - sn shocks propagating in the igm .",
    "we have also seen that the @xmath0 thus produced can exceed the amount of relic @xmath0 destroyed inside the photodissociation region surrounding a given pop  iii .",
    "this occurrence suggests that these first objects might have a positive feedback on subsequent galactic formation .",
    "such conclusion is certainly valid on a local scale , as defined by the radii of the two influence spheres , @xmath24 and @xmath80 , of a single object .",
    "however , our definition of @xmath80 ( see sec .",
    "4 ) does not exclude that some photodissociating flux is present outside @xmath80 .",
    "if many of these objects are present in the universe at the same epoch , they might contribute to an early soft - uv background which , illuminating an isolated , collapsing cloud , could photodissociate and depress its @xmath0 content ; this possibility has been discussed by hrl . however , caf have demonstrated that , once the _ surviving relic igm fraction between photodissociated spheres _ is taken into account , the universe opacity to lw photons before reionization becomes of order unity on scales larger than @xmath80 , but smaller than the typical interdistance between pop  iiis at @xmath120 .",
    "this implies that the soft - uv background is very weak due to intergalactic absorption , and , as a consequence , the proposed negative feedback considerably inhibited .",
    "furthermore , most of the dissociating flux is absorbed by the thick @xmath0 shells discussed above .",
    "given that in general @xmath121 , where @xmath122 is the hii region radius of a pop  iii ( caf ) , clearing of intergalactic @xmath0 by photodissociated sphere overlapping will occur before complete reionization .",
    "it is not clear at this stage if that event occurs before the typical mass scale of the collapsing objects is such that cooling can proceed via ly@xmath40 only , thus considerably weakening the arguments in favor of a temporary halt of galaxy formation at high redshift .",
