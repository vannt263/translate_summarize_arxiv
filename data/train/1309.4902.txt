    "transmission is no longer a well defined observable in such a geometry , however one can identify the presence of some localization effects by studying the time evolution of the bec center - of - mass @xcite . if the center - of - mass follows the moving random potential , the bec is trapped by the random potential ; it remains difficult to say if this localization is classical or induced by the interference of the scattered fluid .    in this paper",
    "we show that it is possible to enhance the role of interference in the localization process of an inhomogeneous interacting bec by introducing tunable correlations in the disorder potential .",
