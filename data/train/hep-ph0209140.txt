    "after ten years of work at hera , an impressive amount of knowledge about the pomeron has been accumulated , especially about its partonic composition and parton distribution functions .",
    "less known are its interaction properties . whereas the pomeron - nucleon cross section has been often discussed in the literature , the recently published data by the ua8 collaboration @xcite have shed some light on the pomeron - pomeron interaction . in",
    "@xcite the double pomeron exchange ( dpe ) cross section was written as the product of two flux factors with the @xmath3-@xmath3 cross section , @xmath5 , being thus directly proportional to this quantity .",
    "this simple formula relies on the validity of the triple - regge model , on the universality of the pomeron flux factor and on the existence of a factorization formula for dpe processes .",
    "however , for these processes the factorization hypothesis has not been proven and is still matter of debate @xcite .",
    "in @xcite it was shown that factorizing and non - factorizing dpe models may be experimentally distinguished in the case of dijet production .",
    "fitting the measured mass spectra allowed for the determination of @xmath5 and its dependence on @xmath6 , the mass of the diffractive system .",
    "the first observation of the ua8 analysis was that the measured diffractive mass ( @xmath6 ) spectra show an excess at low values that can hardly be explained with a constant ( i.e. , independent of @xmath6 ) @xmath5 . even after introducing some mass dependence in @xmath5",
    "they were not able to fit the spectra in a satisfactory way .",
    "their conclusion was that the low @xmath6 excess may have some physical origin like , for example glueball formation .",
    "although the analysis performed in @xcite is standard , it is nevertheless useful to confront it with other , also successful , descriptions of the diffractive interaction .",
    "one of them is the one provided by the interacting gluon model ( igm)@xcite . this model describes only certain aspects of hadronic collisions , related to energy flow and energy deposition in the central rapidity region .",
    "it should not be regarded as an alternative to a field - theoretical approach to diffractive amplitudes , but rather as an extension of the naive parton model .",
    "the reason for using it here is that it may be good enough to account for energy flow in an economic way .",
    "the deeper or more subtle aspects of the underlying field theory probably ( this is our belief ) do not manifest themselves in energy flow , but rather in other quantities like the total cross section .",
    "inspite of its simplicity , this model can teach us a few things and predict another few .",
    "this is encouraging because in the near future new data about dpe from cdf will be available @xcite . in this work",
    "we would like to address the ua8 data with the igm . as it will be seen , according to our analysis the low mass behavior of the @xmath6 spectra",
    "can be explained with a constant @xmath3-@xmath3 cross section .",
    "the igm has been described at length , especially in @xcite and more recently in @xcite . in the past",
    "we have successfully modified the igm in such way as to include in it hadronic single diffractive dissociation processes @xcite and applied it to hadronic collisions and hera - photoproduction data ( @xmath7 distributions and leading particles spectra of @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) .",
    "the main idea of the model is that nucleon - nucleon collisions at high energies can be treated as an incoherent sum of multiple gluon - gluon collisions , the valence quarks playing a secondary role in particle production .",
    "while this idea is well accepted for large momentum transfer between the colliding partons , being on the basis of some models of minijet and jet production ( for example hijing @xcite ) , in the igm its validity is extended down to low momentum transfers , only slightly larger than @xmath12 . at first sight",
    "this is not justified because at lower scales there are no independent gluons , but rather a highly correlated configuration of color fields .",
    "there are , however , some indications coming from lattice qcd calculations , that these soft gluon modes are not so strongly correlated .",
    "one of them is the result obtained in @xcite , namely that the typical correlation length of the soft gluon fields is close to @xmath13 . since this length is still much smaller than the typical hadron size , the gluon fields can , in a first approximation , be treated as uncorrelated .",
    "another independent result concerns the determination of the typical instanton size in the qcd vaccum , which turns out to be of the order of @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "as it is well known ( and has been recently applied to high energy nucleon - nucleon and nucleus - nucleus collisions ) instantons are very important as mediators of soft gluon interactions @xcite .",
    "the small size of the active instantons lead to short distance interactions between soft gluons , which can be treated as independent .",
    "these two results taken together suggest that a collision between the two gluon clouds ( surrounding the valence quarks ) may be viewed as a sum of independent binary gluon - gluon collisions , which is the basic idea of our model . developing the picture above with standard techniques and enforcing energy - momentum conservation",
    ", the igm becomes the ideal tool to study energy flow in high energy hadronic collisions , in particular leading particle production and energy deposition .",
    "confronting this simple model with several and different data sets we obtained surprisingly good agreement with experiment .",
    "as indicated in the recent literature @xcite , one of the crucial issues in diffractive physics is the possible breakdown of factorization .",
    "as stated in @xcite one may have regge and hard factorization .",
    "our model does not rely on any of them . in the language used in @xcite , we need and use a `` diffractive parton distribution '' and we do not really need to talk about `` flux factor '' or `` distribution of partons in the pomeron '' .",
    "therefore there is no regge factorization implied .",
    "however , we will do this connection in eq .",
    "( [ conv ] ) , in order to make contact with the pomeron pdf s parametrized by the h1 and zeus collaborations . as for hard factorization , it is valid as long as the scale @xmath14 is large . in the igm , as it will be seen ,",
    "the scale is given by @xmath15 , a number which sometimes is larger than @xmath16 but sometimes is smaller , going down to values only slightly above @xmath17 .",
    "when the scale is large ( @xmath18 ) we employ eq .",
    "( [ eq : omegah ] ) and when it is smaller ( @xmath19 ) we use eq .",
    "( [ eq : omegas ] ) .",
    "therefore , in part of the phase space we are inside the validity domain of hard factorization , but very often we are outside this domain . from the practical point of view , eq . ( [ eq : omegah ] ) , being defined at a semihard scale , relies on hard factorization for the elementary @xmath20 interaction , uses parton distribution function extracted from dis and an elementary cross section @xmath21 taken from standard pqcd calculations",
    ". the validity of the factorizing - like formula eq .",
    "( [ eq : omegas ] ) of our paper is _ an assumption of the model_. in fact , the relevant scale there is @xmath22 and , strictly speaking , there are no rigorously defined parton distributions , neither elementary cross sections .",
    "however , using eq .",
    "( [ eq : omegas ] ) has non - trivial consequences which were in the past years supported by an extensive comparison with experimental data .",
    "double pomeron exchange processes , inspite of their small cross sections , appear to be an excellent testing ground for the igm because they are inclusive measurements and do not involve particle identification , dealing only with energy flow . in what follows",
    ", we briefly mention our main formulas . for further discussion",
    "we refer to the works @xcite .      in fig .",
    "1 we show schematically the igm picture of a double pomeron exchange event in a proton - antiproton collision .",
    "the interaction follows then the usual igm @xcite picture , namely : the valence quarks fly through essentially undisturbed whereas the gluonic clouds of both projectiles interact strongly with each other ( by gluonic clouds we understand a sort of  effective gluons \" which include also their fluctuations seen as @xmath23 sea pairs ) .",
    "the proton ( antiproton ) looses fraction @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) of its original momentum and gets excited forming what we call a leading jet carrying @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) fraction of the initial momentum .    according to the igm @xcite , the probability to form a fireball carrying momentum fractions @xmath24 and @xmath25 of two colliding hadrons ( see fig .",
    "1 ) is given by : @xmath28 \\right\\ } , \\label{eq : chi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 with @xmath30 being a normalization factor defined by the condition that @xmath31 with @xmath32 being the minimal inelasticity defined by the mass @xmath33 of the lightest possible central gluonic cluster .    as it can be seen from ( [ eq : chi ] ) , the probability that the incoming hadrons release an energy of @xmath34 is a two - dimensional gaussian function of @xmath24 and @xmath25 with maximum governed by the momenta @xmath35 and @xmath36 ( particular cases of ( [ eq : defmom ] ) ) , which , in turn , depend on the integration limits @xmath37 and @xmath38 . by reducing these maximal value we select events in which the energy released by the proton and by the antiproton is small ( i.e. , @xmath6 is small ) and at the same time two rapidity gaps will be formed .",
    "this is how we define our `` kinematical pomeron '' : a set of gluons belonging to the proton ( or antiproton ) carrying altogether a small fraction of the parent hadron momentum .",
    "the function @xmath39 will be discussed below . in the formulation of the igm @xmath40 if only non - diffractive processes are present . in the model ,",
    "diffraction ( double pomeron exchange ) means reducing @xmath38 ( @xmath37 and @xmath38 ) .",
    "although this procedure is somewhat arbitrary and we could choose any small number for the integration limits , this freedom of choice is dramatically reduced if we use single diffractive events ( spe ) as a guide .",
    "in @xcite we have shown that the choice leading to the best description of diffractive mass spectra is @xmath41 . actually , using this cut in ( [ eq : defmom ] ) and some simple approximations ( described in @xcite and also in the appendix ) we could obtain the analytical formula for the single diffractive mass spectrum : @xmath42^{1/2 } }    \\exp\\left\\ { -\\ , \\frac{\\left[1\\ , -\\ , c\\ln\\left(\\frac{m_x^2}{m_0 ^ 2}\\right)\\right]^2}{c\\ln \\left(\\frac{m_x^2}{m_0 ^ 2}\\right)}\\right\\ }   \\label{analsd}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 is a constant ( discussed below ) .",
    "this spectrum shape is in very good agreement with a wide body of data .",
    "based on our previous success we shall assume here that in double pomeron exchange we have @xmath44 and @xmath41 and consequently @xmath45 .",
    "in @xcite it has been conjectured that the ratio of two - gap to one - gap rates could be used to test qcd aspects of gap formation .",
    "we therefore calculate in the appendix , with the same approximations , the analytical expression for the dpe mass spectrum , which turns out to be : @xmath46 ^ 2}{c'\\ln \\left(\\frac{m_x^2}{m_0 ^ 2}\\right)}\\right\\ }   \\label{analdd}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    both expressions ( [ analsd ] ) and ( [ analdd ] ) are dominated by the @xmath47 factor .",
    "this garantees a pronounced fall with increasing diffractive masses , which is confirmed by the numerical calculations ( which have no approximation ) presented below .",
    "the spectral function , @xmath39 , contains all the dynamical input of the igm .",
    "their soft and semihard components are given by ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) : @xmath48 @xmath49 where @xmath50 s denote the effective number of gluons from the corresponding projectiles ( approximated by the respective gluonic structure functions ) , @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the soft and semihard gluonic cross sections , @xmath53 is the minimum transverse momentum for minijet production and @xmath54 denotes the pomeron - pomeron cross section .    in order to be more precise",
    ", the function @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) represents the momentum distribution of the gluons belonging to the proton ( antiproton ) subset called pomeron and @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) is the momentum fraction _ of the proton _ ( _ antiproton _ ) carried by one of these gluons .",
    "we shall therefore use the notation @xmath59 .",
    "this function should not be confused with the momentum distribution of the gluons inside the pomeron , @xmath60 .",
    "the pomeron for us is just a collection of gluons which belong to the diffracted proton ( antiproton ) . in our previous works",
    "we have assumed that these gluons behave like all other ordinary gluons in the proton and have therefore the same momentum distribution .",
    "the only difference is the momentum sum rule , which for the gluons in @xmath3 is : @xmath61 where @xmath62 ( see @xcite ) instead of @xmath63 , which holds for the entire gluon population in the proton .    in order to make contact with the analysis performed by hera experimental groups we consider two possible momentum distributions for the gluons inside @xmath3 .",
    "a hard one : @xmath64 and a `` super - hard '' ( as it is called in @xcite ) or `` leading gluon '' ( as it is called in @xcite ) one : @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the momentum fraction of the pomeron carried by the gluons and the superscripts @xmath67 and @xmath68 denote hard and superhard respectively .",
    "the constants @xmath69 and @xmath70 will be fixed by the sum rule ( [ sumrule ] ) . in the past @xcite ,",
    "following the same formalism , we have also considered a soft gluon distribution for the pomeron of the type @xmath71 but we found that this `` soft pomeron '' distribution was incompatible with the single diffractive mass spectra measured at hera @xcite . this pomeron profile was also ruled out by other types of observables , as concluded in refs . @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we shall use the donnachie - landshoff pomeron flux factor , which , after the integration in the @xmath72 variable , is approximately given by @xcite : @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the fraction of the proton momentum carried by the pomeron and the normalization constant @xmath75 will be fixed later , also with the help of ( [ sumrule ] ) . noticing that @xmath76 the distribution @xmath77 needed in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : omegas ] ) and ( [ eq : omegah ] ) is then given by the convolution : @xmath78    we shall use also the `` diffractive gluon distribution '' given by : @xmath79 where @xmath80 is fixed by the sum rule . with ( [ gfeynman ] )",
    "we could obtain a very good description of diffractive mass spectra @xcite .",
    "therefore we shall keep using it here .",
    "we are implicitly assuming that all gluons from @xmath8 and @xmath81 participating in the collision ( i.e. , those emitted from the upper and lower vertex in fig .",
    "1 ) have to form a color singlet .",
    "only then two large rapidity gaps will form separating the diffracted proton , the @xmath6 system and the diffracted antiproton , which is the experimental requirement defining a dpe event .",
    "we can now calculate the diffractive mass distribution @xmath6 using the @xmath82 function by simply performing a change of variables : @xmath83 \\,\\theta \\left(xys - m_{0}^2 \\right)\\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\frac { 2\\,m_x}{s}\\,\\int_{\\frac { m_x^2}{s}}^1 \\!dx\\ , \\frac{1}{x}\\ , \\chi \\left [ x , y = \\frac{m_x^2}{xs}\\right ] \\ , \\theta ( m_x^2-m_0 ^ 2 ) \\label{eq : dndmx}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "we start evaluating eq . ( [ eq : dndmx ] ) with the inputs that were already fixed by other applications of the igm @xcite , namely , ( [ gfeynman ] ) with @xmath62 . in fig .",
    "2 we show the numerical results for dpe mass distribution . we have fixed the parameter @xmath84 ( @xmath85 ) appearing in eq .",
    "( [ eq : omegas ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq : omegah ] ) , to @xmath86 ( solid lines ) and @xmath87 ( dashed lines ) . in both cases",
    "our curves were normalized to the  and \" ( fig .",
    "2a ) and  or \" ( fig .",
    "2b ) data samples of @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that , in this approach , since we have fixed all parameters using previous data on leading particle formation and single diffractive mass spectra , there are no free parameters here , except @xmath5 .",
    "as one can see from the figures , in our model we obtain the fast increase of spectra in the low mass region without the use of a @xmath6 dependent @xmath3-@xmath3 cross section and this quantity seems to be approximately @xmath88 .",
    "this is the main message of this note .    in order to investigate the sensitivity of eq .",
    "( [ eq : dndmx ] ) to the value of @xmath89 , we show in fig .",
    "3 with arbitrary units , diffractive mass spectra obtained with @xmath90 ( dash - dotted line ) , @xmath91 ( solid line ) and @xmath92 ( dashed line ) .",
    "the three curves have the same normalization and we observe that , as @xmath89 increases our mass spectrum becomes softer .",
    "it is interesting to remark that , in the actual calculations , the parameter @xmath89 appears always divided by @xmath5 in the computation of the moments ( [ eq : defmom ] ) .",
    "in fact , they form one single parameter . assuming that the pomeron profile is universal",
    ", we could disentangle one from the other , fitting @xmath89 from the analysis of previous data @xcite and now extracting @xmath5 from the the ua8 data .",
    "we next replace ( [ gfeynman ] ) by the convolution ( [ conv ] ) to see which of the previously considered pomeron profiles , hard or superhard , gives the best fit of the ua8 data . in doing so , we shall keep everything else the same , i.e. , @xmath93 and @xmath94 . in fig .",
    "4a we compute ( [ conv ] ) and show @xmath95 for eq .",
    "( [ gfeynman ] ) ( solid line ) , the hard distribution ( [ fhard ] ) ( dashed line ) and the superhard ( [ superhard ] ) ( dash - dotted line ) . for the sake of comparison , fig .",
    "4b shows the corresponding diffractive mass spectra normalized to the unity with same notation .",
    "we see that , for harder pomeron profiles we `` dig a hole '' in the low mass region of the spectrum .    in fig . 5",
    ", we repeat the fitting procedure used in fig . 2 for the pomeron profiles shown in fig .",
    "we fix @xmath62 , @xmath94 .",
    "solid , dashed and dash - dotted lines represent respectively eq .",
    "( [ gfeynman ] ) , hard and superhard pomerons .",
    "note that the solid lines are the same as in fig .",
    "2 . looking at the figure , at first sight ,",
    "we might be tempted to say that eq .",
    "( [ gfeynman ] ) gives the best agreement with data and a somewhat worse description can be obtained with the hard pomeron ( in dashed lines ) , the superhard being discarded .",
    "however , comparing the dashed lines in fig . 2 and fig . 5 and observing that they practically coincide with each other ,",
    "we conclude that the same curve can be obtained either with ( [ gfeynman ] ) and @xmath96 ( dashed line in fig .",
    "2 ) or with ( [ conv ] ) , ( [ fhard ] ) and @xmath94 ( dashed line in fig . 5 ) . _ in other words we can trade the `` hardness '' of the pomeron with its interaction cross section .",
    "the following two objects give an equally good description of data : i ) a pomeron composed by more and softer gluons and with a larger cross section and ii ) a pomeron made by fewer , harder gluons with a smaller interaction cross section .",
    "_ we have checked that this reasoning can be extended to the superhard pomeron .",
    "although , apparently disfavoured by fig . 5 ( dash - dotted lines ) , it might still fit the data provided that @xmath97 . given the uncertainties in the data and the limitations of the model ,",
    "we will not try for the moment to refine this analysis .",
    "it seems possible to describe data in a number of different ways .",
    "we conclude then that nothing exotic has been observed and also that the pomeron - pomeron cross section is bounded to be @xmath98 .    in fig .",
    "6a we compare our predictions for @xmath99 at tevatron ( @xmath100 ) and in fig .",
    "6b for lhc ( @xmath101 ) assuming an @xmath6-independent @xmath102 ( and using ( [ gfeynman ] ) ) with predictions made by brandt _",
    "@xcite for two values of effective pomeron intercepts ( @xmath103 ) , @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "although the normalization of our curves is arbitrary , the comparison of the shapes reveals a striking difference between the two predictions . whereas the points ( from @xcite ) show spectra broadening with the c.m.s .",
    "energy , we predict ( solid lines ) the opposite behavior : as the energy increases we observe a ( modest ) narrowing for @xmath0 .",
    "this small effect means that the diffractive mass becomes a smaller fraction of the available energy @xmath106 . in other words ,",
    "the  diffractive inelasticity \" decreases with energy and consequently the  diffracted leading particles \" follow a harder @xmath107 spectrum . physically , in the context of the igm , this means that the deposited energy is increasing with @xmath106 ( due the minijets ) but it will be mostly released outside the phase space region that we are selecting .",
    "we are not able to make precise statements about the diffractive cross section ( in particular about its normalization ) with our simple model .",
    "nevertheless , the narrowing of @xmath108 suggests a slower increase ( with @xmath106 ) of the integrated distribution @xmath109 .",
    "we found this same effect @xcite also for @xmath110 . this trend is welcome and",
    "is one of the possible mechanisms responsible for the suppression of diffractive cross sections at higher energies relative to regge theory predictions .    in fig .",
    "7 we show the ratio @xmath111 defined by : @xmath112 this quantity involves only distributions previously normalized to unity and does not directly compare the cross sections ( which are numerically very different for dpe and single diffraction ) . in @xmath113",
    "the dominant @xmath47 factors cancel , as suggested by the comparison between ( [ analsd ] ) and ( [ analdd ] ) , and we can better analyse the details of the distributions which may contain interesting dynamical information . the most prominent feature of fig .",
    "7 is the rise of the ratio with @xmath6 , almost by one order of magnitude in the mass range considered .",
    "this can be qualitatively attributed to the fact that , in single diffractive events the object @xmath114 has larger rapidities than the corresponding cluster formed in dpe events . as a consequence ,",
    "when energy is released from the incoming particles in a spe event , it goes more to kinetic energy of the @xmath114 system ( i.e. , larger momentum @xmath115 and rapidity @xmath116 ) and less to its mass . in dpe , although less energy is released , it goes predominantly to the mass @xmath6 of the difractive cluster , which is then at lower values of @xmath116 . in order to illustrate this behavior",
    ", we show in fig .",
    "8 the rapidity distributions of the @xmath114 system ( which has @xmath6 ) .",
    "all curves are normalized to unity and with them we just want to draw attention to the dramatically different positions of the maxima of these distributions .",
    "the solid and dashed lines show @xmath117 for dpe ( curves on the left ) and spe ( curves on the right ) computed at @xmath118 and @xmath119 , respectively .",
    "we can clearly observe that dpe and spe rapidity distributions are separated by three units of rapidity and this difference stays nearly constant as the c.m.s .",
    "energy increases .",
    "the location of maxima in @xmath117 and their energy dependence are predictions of our model .",
    "to summarize : we have further developed our model for hadronic collisions and included double pomeron exchange events . with only one new parameter , @xmath5",
    ", we could fit the data recently published by the ua8 collaboration and make predictions for the dpe mass spectra at tevatron and lhc energies .",
    "our main conclusion is that @xmath88 and constant with @xmath6 is favored by experimental data .",
    "we predict that the ratio between ( normalized ) double @xmath3-@xmath3 exchange and single diffractive mass distributions grows with @xmath6 .",
    "in what follows we shall often make use of our kinematical constraint between @xmath120 and @xmath121 :        in order to obtain analytical expressions we shall , in the following set @xmath127 because at the relevant energies hard processes are not yet dominant .",
    "we shall keep only the low @xmath24 dominating factor of the gluon distribution : @xmath128 we shall neglect the @xmath57 and @xmath58 dependence of the cross sections and assume that : @xmath129 with all these approximations ( [ momegas ] ) can be rewritten as : @xmath130      @xmath131\\nonumber\\\\ & \\simeq&\\ ,   c\\cdot \\left(\\frac{m_x^2}{s}\\right ) \\cdot \\frac{1}{y_m}\\cdot \\ln \\left(\\frac{m_x^2}{m_0 ^ 2}\\right ) \\ , = \\ , c\\cdot x_m\\cdot \\ln \\left(\\frac{m_x^2}{m_0 ^ 2}\\right ) \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]                @xmath135 \\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\ , c\\ , \\left[\\left(x_my_m\\right)\\ , -\\",
