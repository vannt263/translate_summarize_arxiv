    "however , another generalization of superpositions of coherent states is possible by employing the generalized coherent states for general group actions@xcite .",

    "the generalized coherent states for such systems represent the quasi - classical states .",
    "for example the su(2 ) coherent states are also known as atomic coherent states and are analogous to classical electric dipoles@xcite .",
    "superpositions of these generalized coherent states in quantum systems are therefore of interest in studying counter - intuitive manifestations of the superposition principle .    the studies of superpositions of heisenberg  weyl , su(2 ) and su(1,1 ) coherent states are simplified by the fact that these are one  parameter groups , and the corresponding coset space is thus a locally two  dimensional manifold . for the heisenberg  weyl group , the manifold is the plane , for su(2 ) the poincar sphere and for su(1,1 ) the lobachevsky plane .",

    "the terms are left on for a short time to produce the desired su(3 ) coherent state and then shut off .",
    "of course they are not completely eliminated as some overlap is needed for the cross  mode collisions ( with coefficient  @xmath9 ) to take place .",

    "furthermore , by assuming that the initial su(3 ) coherent state has been generated from the evolution  ( [ h : nonlinear ] ) , with large linear quantum tunneling and negligible contributions from nonlinear evolution , the optical potential barrier between trapping potential minima is increased to reduce the linear tunneling . at the same time",
    ", the nonlinear coefficients must be reasonably large compared to the coefficient for linear tunneling , perhaps by employing an external magnetic field to exploit a feshbach resonance , as discussed above . for large nonlinearities and small linear quantum tunneling terms , the hamiltonian  ( [ h : nonlinear ] ) can be approximated by @xmath31 with @xmath32 .",
