    "similar to the black holes the wormholes in @xmath0dimensions @xcite also have certain degree of simplicity compared to their @xmath1dimensional counterparts @xcite .",
    "the absence of gravitational degrees in @xmath0dimensions enforces us to introduce appropriate sources to keep the wormhole alive against collapse . instead of general wormholes",
    "our concern will be confined herein to the subject of thin - shell wormholes ( tsws ) , whose throat is designed to host the entire source @xcite . from the outset",
    "our strategy will be to curve the geometry of the throat and find the corresponding energy - momentum through the einstein s equations on the thin - shell @xcite .",
    "clearly any distortion / warp at the throat gives rise to certain source , but as the subject is tsws the nature of energy - density becomes of utmost important .",
    "wormholes in general violates the null - energy condition ( nec ) @xcite , which implies also the violation of the remaining energy conditions .",
    "the occurrence of negative pressure components in @xmath1dimensions provides alternatives in the sense that violation of nec can be accounted by the pressure , leaving the possibility of an overall positive energy density .    in this paper",
    "we choose our throat geometry in @xmath0dimensional tsw such that the pressure vanishes , the energy density becomes positive and as a result all energy conditions are satisfied @xcite .",
    "this is an advantageous situation in @xmath0dimensions not encountered in @xmath1dimensional tsws .",
    "our method is to consider a hypersurface induced in a @xmath2dimensional flat polar coordinates . upon determining the energy density",
    "it is observed that a natural solution for the underlying geometry of the throat turns out to be a hypocycloid .",
    "standard cycloid is known to be the minimum time curve of a falling particle under uniform gravitational field which is generated by a fixed point on a circle rolling on a straight line .",
    "the hypocycloid on the other hand is generated by a fixed point on a small circle which rolls inside the circumference of a larger circle .",
    "the warped geometry of such a curve surprisingly generates energy density that turns out to be positive .",
    "this summarizes in brief , the main contribution of this paper .    in @xcite",
    "we have constructed a @xmath0dimensional tsw by considering a flat bulk metric of the form @xmath3with a throat located at the hypersurface @xmath4using the standard formalism of cut and paste technique ( see the appendix ) it was shown that the line element of the throat is given by@xmath5with the energy momentum tensor on the shell@xmath6 in which@xmath7we note that a prime stands for the differentiation with respect to @xmath8 it was found that with @xmath9 all energy conditions are satisfied including that the matter which supports the wormhole was physical i.e. not exotic . finally the total matter contained in the throat can be calculated as@xmath10 in the sequel we shall give explicit examples for this integral .",
    "hypocycloid @xcite is the curve generated by a rolling small circle inside a larger circle .",
    "this is a different version of the standard cycloid which is generated by a circle rolling on a straight line .",
    "the parametric equation of a hypocycloid is given by@xmath11 in which @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the cartesian coordinates on the hypocycloid .",

    "here if one considers @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a natural number , then the curve is closed and it possesses @xmath19 singularities / spikes . in fig .",
    "1 we plot ( 7 ) for different values of @xmath19 with @xmath20 let us add that for the particular choice of @xmath21 and @xmath22 the hypocycloid takes a compact form @xmath23 and @xmath24 with @xmath25 in what follows we proceed to determine the form of energy density @xmath26 and the resulting total energy for the individual cases plotted in fig . 1 .    to this end without loss of generality we set @xmath21 and @xmath27 and express @xmath26 as a function of @xmath28 for this we parametrize the equation of the throat as @xmath29using the chain rule one finds@xmath30and @xmath31which implies@xmath32where a dot stands for the derivative with respect to the parameter @xmath28 consequently the total matter is given by@xmath33where @xmath34 is the energy density per unit parameter @xmath35 note that for the sake of simplicity we dropped the sub - index @xmath36 from the quantities calculated at the throat .",
    "particular examples of calculations for the energy @xmath37 are given as follows .       and",
    "@xmath39 in terms of @xmath40 for @xmath41 the singularities / cusps of @xmath42 are not physical .",
    "this can be seen easily when the total energy is finite .",
    "this is in analogy with a conical conductor of total charge finite but the charge density at the vertex diverges .",
    ", width=264 ]    the first case which we would like to study is the minimum index for @xmath19 which is @xmath43 we find that@xmath44which is clearly positive everywhere . knowing that the period of the curve ( 7 ) is @xmath45 we find that @xmath26 is singular at the possible roots of the denominator i.e. , @xmath46 .",
    "we note that although @xmath26 diverges at these points the function that must be finite everywhere is @xmath39 which is given by@xmath47the situation is in analogy with the charge density of a charged conical conductor whose charge density at the vertex of the cone diverges while the total charge remains finite . in fig .",
    "2 we plot @xmath26 and @xmath39 as a function of @xmath48 which clearly implies that @xmath39 is finite everywhere leading to the total finite energy @xmath49    we would like to add that physically nothing extraordinary happens at the cusp points .",
    "these points are the specific points at which the manifold is not differentiable just with respect to @xmath50 but also with respect to the angular variable @xmath51 the original thin - shell wormhole has been constructed based on discontinuity of the manifold with respect to @xmath50 at the location of the throat which implied the presence of the matter source at the throat ( we refer to the fig . 1 of ref .",
    "@xcite where clearly such cuspy point in @xmath50 direction is shown ) .",
    "now , in the case under study we have one additional discontinuity of the riemann tensor in @xmath52 direction which implies a more complicated form of matter distribution at the throat .       and @xmath39 in terms of @xmath40 for @xmath54 similar to @xmath38 the singularities of @xmath42 are not physical . , width=264 ]    next , we set @xmath53 where one finds@xmath55and@xmath56fig .",

    "this is partly due to the fact that the total length of the hypocycloid is increasing as @xmath19 increases such that @xmath60 with @xmath20 this pattern goes on with @xmath19 larger and in general@xmath61where @xmath62    table 1 shows the total energy @xmath63 for various @xmath64 we observe that @xmath65 is not bounded from above ( with respect to @xmath19 ) which means that for large @xmath19 it diverges as @xmath66 . therefore to stay in classically finite energy region one",

    ".total energy @xmath63 in terms of @xmath64 we add that the total energy for large @xmath19 is approximately given by @xmath67 this shows that increasing the number of cusps to infinity requires infinite energy . [",

    "the possibility of total positive energy has been scrutinized and verified with explicit examples in the @xmath0dimensional tsws .",
    "naturally the same subject arises with more stringent conditions in the more realistic dimensions of @xmath68 . by getting advantage of technical simplicity",
    "we have shown that the geometry of the throat can remarkably be that of a hypocycloid .",
    "this is a rare curve compared with the more familiar minimum time cycloid . in effect , a fixed point on the circumference of a smaller circle rolling in a larger one makes the hypocycloid .",
    "the important point is that in the rolling process concavity of the resulting curve makes the extrinsic curvature negative , which in turn yields a positive energy density @xmath69 note that with convex curves this is not possible .",
    "the emerging cusps at the tips of the hypocycloid may yield singular points , however , these can be overcome by integrating around such cusps .",
    "the lightning rod analogy for diverging charge density in electromagnetism constitutes an example to understand the situation . in the present case",
    "our sharp points ( edges ) are reminiscent of cosmic strings and naturally deserves a separate investigation .",
    "the results for the total energy turns out to be perfectly positive , as our analytical calculation and numerical plots reveal . increasing frequency of each roll by using smaller and smaller circles inside the large one is shown to increase the regular energy in finite amounts which is necessary to give life to a tsw .",
