    "the knowledge of the electrostatic force between two charged conductors has a theoretical and practical importance .",
    "its exact calculation is possible through the capacitance coefficients @xcite , whose analytical value is known only for few selected geometries and arrangements of the electrodes .    for large distances between the charged bodies",
    "the problem can be understood in terms of the properties of the isolated conductors @xcite and , in principle , it is solved . for short distances ,",
    "the situation is more complex .",
    "a physical argument rests on the fact that when the two conductors touch , a new system is formed .",
    "some unexpected properties arise in this regime .",
    "for example , two spheres of like charges almost always attract , as shown by j.lekner @xcite .",
    "a particularly intriguing problem is the following : which is the force between two equal conductors at the same potential ?",
    "this problem was solved in a classical work by lord kelvin@xcite for the case of two spheres of equal radius @xmath0 finding a repulsive finite force at short distances : f = [ intro1.3]another classical case studied by kelvin is a couple of spheres when one of the two is earthed .",
    "these problems have been recently revisited and generalized to spheres of different radii by j.lekner@xcite , who give an instructive study of different physical situations .    in this work",
    "we study the same problem for the case of two coaxial disks of radius @xmath0 , when the distance @xmath1 between them goes to zero . for two disks with fixed charges",
    "@xmath2 we find a _ logarithmically divergent _ force at short distances , the only exception being @xmath3 , when the force is attractive and constant . moreover a curious , and potentially interesting ,",
    "behaviour is observed in this near regime when the disks carry charges of different sign and of different absolute value .",
    "we found that the interaction cancels at a given distance and become repulsive for smaller gaps . in a way , the behaviour is the counterpart of that reported for two spheres . owing to the redistribution of charges on the surface of the disks",
    "the interaction pass from attraction to repulsion for total charges of different sign .",
    "surprisingly , this situation appears also for two disks with charges of the same sign if the ratio of the two charge is small , @xmath4 .    with conductors we can consider configurations different from the standard case of two bodies of given charges , i.e. two conductors at fixed potentials and one conductor with charge @xmath5 while the other is held at fixed potential .",
    "these two cases cover the kelvin s configurations",
    ". we will give below the small distance behaviour of the forces in these cases , for two disks .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sezmethod ]",
    "we present the general framework and give a formal expression for the forces . in section",
    "[ sez2 ] , a simple analysis of an integral equation provide us the needed asymptotic terms in the capacitance matrix .",
    "we complete the analysis and give the explicit expression for forces between the disks in different cases .",
    "particularly , we show that disks charged with different charges of opposite sign repel each other for an appropriate reduction of the inter - electrode distance .",
    "the calculated distribution of surface charge in this case gives a physical insight in this curious result . in section  [ sezgen ]",
    "we propose a generalization to the case of arbitrary conductors , based on a particular decomposition of the capacitance matrix . with this method",
    "the role of the dimensionality of the contact zone is emphasized and the corresponding different behaviour of forces is naturally explained .",
    "this approach is checked in the case of two disks with different radii , where a constant force arises at short distances .",
    "charges and potentials for two electrodes are linearly related q_i= _ j",

    "the electrostatic energy of the system is given by the quadratic forms w = 12 _ i , j c_ij v_i v_j = 12 _ ij m_ij q_i q_j.[intro1.1]in the general case , all the quantities in both quadratic forms of depend on the distance @xmath1 between the conductors . on the other hand , the choice of the first or the other form is convenient when conductors at fixed potentials or at fixed charges are studied .",
    "the force between the conductors is found by derivation of energy .",
    "for example , if the two disks have fixed charges , @xmath8 and @xmath9 respectively the force in the axial direction is f = - 12_i , j q_i",
    "q_j m_ij [ intro1.3 ]    all the previous formulas simplify for equal conductors , e.g. equal disks , because @xmath10 and @xmath11 . for equal conductors ,",
    "it is convenient to distinguish in the capacitance matrix the usual relative capacitance , given in this case by @xmath12 and the symmetric combination @xmath13 which enters in the computation of the energy for fixed potentials . in terms of these quantity c_11 = c + 12 c_g;c_12 = - c + 12 c_g [ decompc ]",
    "let us consider the electrodes at fixed charges .",

    "let us note that @xmath18 is the only term which enter in the computation of the force for equal charges .",
    "it is well known that the expression is valid in every circumstance , for equal conductors , depending only on coulomb s law , but the dependence on @xmath1 is hidden also in the charges when the bodies are held at fixed potential . for completeness let us shortly review the case of equal potential @xmath19 .",
