    "according to the inflationary scenario of cosmology , all structure in the universe can be traced back to primordial quantum fluctuations during an accelerated expanding phase of the very early universe .",
    "short wavelength quantum fluctuations generated during inflation are considered to lose quantum nature when their wavelengths exceed the hubble horizon length .",
    "then , the statistical property of generated fluctuations can be represented by classical distribution functions .",
    "this is the assumption of the quantum to classical transition of quantum fluctuations generated by the inflation .",
    "as the structure of the present universe is classical objects , we must explain or understand how this transition occurred and how the quantum fluctuations changed to classical fluctuations .",
    "we have investigated this problem from the viewpoint of entanglement  @xcite . for quantum fluctuations behaving in the classical way , quantum expectation values of any operators must be calculable using appropriate classical distribution functions . restricting to two point correlation functions of quantum operators ,",
    "this condition is equivalent to the separability of a bipartite state . for a separable state ,",
    "the entanglement is zero and there exists a positive normalizable p function  @xcite and this function can play the role of classical distribution function . in our previous study , we defined two spatially separated regions in the inflationary universe and investigated the bipartite entanglement between these regions .",
    "we found that the entanglement between these two regions becomes zero after their physical separation exceeds the hubble horizon .",
    "this behavior of the bipartite entanglement confirms our expectation that the long wavelength quantum fluctuations during inflation behave as classical fluctuations and can become seed fluctuations for the structure formation in the universe .",
    "our previous analysis concerning the entanglement of quantum fluctuations in the inflationary universe relies on the separability criterion for continuous bipartite systems  @xcite of which dynamical variables are continuous .",
    "the applicability of this criterion is limited to systems with gaussian states : the wave function or the density matrix of the system is represented in a form of gaussian function .",
    "thus , we can not say anything about the entanglement for the system with non - gaussian states such as excited states and thermal states .",
    "furthermore , from a viewpoint of observation or measurement , information on quantum fluctuations can be extracted via interaction between quantum fields and measurement devices .",
    "hence , it is more natural to consider a setup in which the entanglement of quantum fields is probed using detectors . following this direction ,",
    "we consider particle detectors  @xcite with two internal energy levels interacting with a scalar field in this paper . by preparing two spatially",
    "separated equivalent detectors interacting with the scalar field , we can extract the information on entanglement of the scalar field by evaluating the entanglement between these two detectors . as",

    "they showed that an initially nonentangled pair of detectors evolved to an entangled state through interaction with the scalar field .",

    "<S> furthermore , the quantum discord , which is defined as the quantum part of total correlation , approaches zero on the super horizon scale . </S>",
    "<S> these behaviors support the appearance of the classical nature of the quantum fluctuation generated during the inflationary era . </S>"
