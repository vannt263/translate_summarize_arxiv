    "the study of elementary processes such as heavy meson production in nn - collisions is very important for building reliable microscopic models and for the understanding of nucleon - nucleus and nucleus - nucleus collisions .",
    "polarization phenomena give the possibility to test symmetry properties and to disentangle the problems related to the hadron structure or to the reaction mechanism .",
    "we mention , as examples , the possibility to determine experimentally the p - parity of the k - meson , and the @xmath2 scattering lengths , through the reaction @xmath3 , at threshold .",
    "the near threshold region , which is characterized by the production of final particles in relative s - state , is particularly interesting , as :    * it is , in general , quite wide for @xmath4-meson production , and can be identified by the behavior of experimental observables such as angular distributions and polarization observables , * polarization phenomena are very peculiar , either they vanish or they are large ( in absolute value ) , reaching their limiting values , especially in @xmath5-collisions * isotopic effects are large : for @xmath6-collisions the cross section is larger than for @xmath5-collisions and polarization phenomena are more rich .    in this contribution we will illustrate very briefly a formalism @xcite , based on fundamental properties of the strong interaction , and give predictions , in model independent way , on reactions and observables which can be accessed at cosy .",
    "the formalism developed here , applies to vector @xcite , scalar , pseudoscalar meson @xcite as well as to strange particle production @xcite .",
    "it is based on the symmetry properties of the strong interaction , such as the pauli principle , the isotopic invariance , the p - invariance , and it is particularly simplified in the threshold region , where all final particles are produced in @xmath7-state .      in the general case the spin structure of the matrix element for the process @xmath8 is described by a set of 48 independent complex amplitudes , which are functions of five kinematical variables . the same reaction , in coplanar kinematics ,",
    "is described by 24 amplitudes , functions of four variables . in collinear kinematics the number of independent amplitudes is reduced to 7 and the description of this reaction is further simplified in case of threshold @xmath9-meson production , where one amplitude describes the @xmath5-reaction and two amplitudes the @xmath6-reaction .",
    "the threshold process @xmath10 is characterized by a single partial transition : @xmath11 , where @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) is the total spin of the two protons in the initial ( final ) states and @xmath14 is the orbital momentum of the colliding protons . in the cms of the considered reaction",
    "the corresponding matrix element can be written as : @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 ( @xmath18 and @xmath19 ) are the two - component spinors of the initial ( final ) protons ; @xmath20 is the three - vector of the @xmath9-meson polarization , @xmath21 is the unit vector along the 3-momentum of the initial proton ; @xmath22 is the s - wave partial amplitude , describing the triplet - singlet transition of the two - proton system in v - meson production .    in case of @xmath6-collisions , applying the conservation of isotopic invariance for the strong interaction , two threshold partial transitions",
    "are allowed : @xmath23 and @xmath24 with the following spin structure of the matrix element : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the s - wave partial amplitude describing the singlet - triplet transition of the two - nucleon system in v - meson production . in the general case",
    "the amplitudes @xmath22 and @xmath26 are complex functions , depending on the energies @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , where @xmath30 and @xmath29 are the energies of the initial ( final ) proton and of the produced @xmath31meson , respectively .",
    "note that @xmath22 is the common amplitude for @xmath5- and @xmath6-collisions , due to the isotopic invariance of the strong interaction .",
    "all dynamical information is contained in the partial amplitudes @xmath26 and @xmath22 , which are different for the different vector particles .",
    "on the other hand , some polarization phenomena have common characteristics , essentially independent from the type of vector meson .",
    "for example , vector mesons produced in @xmath5- and @xmath6-threshold collisions are transversally polarized , and the elements of the density matrix @xmath32 are independent from the relative values of the amplitudes @xmath26 and @xmath22 : @xmath33 , @xmath34 . therefore , the angular distribution has a @xmath35-dependence for the subsequent decay @xmath36 ( where @xmath37 is a pseudoscalar meson ) and a @xmath38-dependence for the decay @xmath39 , where @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) is the angle between @xmath21 and the @xmath42 @xmath43 momentum ( in the rest system of @xmath4 ) .",
    "possible deviations from this behavior have to be considered as an indication of the presence of higher partial waves in the final state .",
    "all other one - spin polarization observables , related to the polarizations of the initial or final nucleons , identically vanish , for any process of @xmath31meson production .    the dependence of the differential cross section for threshold collisions of polarized nucleons ( where the polarization of the final particles is not detected ) can be parametrized as follows :    @xmath44    where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the axial vectors of the beam and target nucleon polarizations , @xmath47 is the element of phase - space for the three - particle final state .",
    "the spin correlation coefficients @xmath48 and @xmath49 are real and they are different for @xmath5- and @xmath6- collisions :    * @xmath50 : @xmath51 , @xmath52 . *",
    "@xmath53 : @xmath54 ,    with the following relations @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "the ratio @xmath57 of the total ( unpolarized ) cross section for @xmath6- and @xmath5- collisions , taking into account the identity of final particles in @xmath58 , can be written in terms of the amplitudes ratio : @xmath59 so a measurement of this ratio ( with unpolarized particles ) can be considered equivalent to a polarization measurement , as the following relation holds : @xmath60    the polarization transfer from the initial neutron to the final proton ( @xmath61 ) , can be parameterized as follows : @xmath62 with @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the relative phase of @xmath26 and @xmath22 , which is non zero , in the general case . for the process",
    "@xmath58 the relation @xmath65 holds , for any vector meson @xmath4 .",
    "* what do we learn from the existing data and what cosy can measure ?",
    "*    disto @xcite measured the differential cross section for the reaction @xmath66 at @xmath67=3.67 gev , at an energy excess @xmath68 mev over threshold .",
    "the @xmath69 distribution is isotropic , showing that the @xmath69 is emitted in an s - wave state relatively to the two protons .",
    "however the @xmath5-system can be excited to higher partial wave , as the @xmath5 interaction is mainly governed by @xmath70-exchange .",
    "the presence of a p - wave in the final @xmath5-system , changes the spin structure of the matrix element and induces two transitions , corresponding to singlet initial @xmath5 state and @xmath71=0 or 2 . in particular , for @xmath71=0 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 is the relative @xmath5-momentum . in this case",
    "the polarization of the @xmath9-meson is not transversal , anymore , as it is normal to the momentum of the scattered proton .",
    "the angular distribution of the @xmath74-meson in the @xmath69-reference frame can be parametrized as @xmath75 and a fit of the data gives : @xmath76 .",
    "this number can be directly related to the ratio between p- and s - wave amplitudes . within this assumption",
    ", one can predict the following values for the spin correlation coefficients : @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 ( the simplest case where @xmath80 would not vanish is that the angular momentum of the @xmath69-meson with respect to the @xmath5-system is equal to 1 .",
    "then @xmath80 would be proportional to the relative phase of these amplitudes ) .",
    "_ at cosy it is possible to determine the energy dependence of the p and s waves ratio , in the threshold region , through the measurement of the polarization coefficients and to determine the analyzing power as a function of @xmath81 and of the proton emission angle @xmath82 . _      the reaction @xmath83 @xmath84 differs from meson production , as the final baryons are not identical .",
    "therefore , even in case of @xmath5-reactions , at threshold , two amplitudes are present : @xmath85 @xmath86 and the unpolarized cross section can be written as : @xmath87 .",
    "the correlation coefficients can be expressed in terms of the two amplitudes and of the unpolarized cross section as : @xmath88 and @xmath89 . due to the symmetry properties of the strong interaction ,",
    "they are related by a model independent relation : @xmath90 .    *",
    "what do we learn from the existing data and what cosy can measure ? *",
    "disto has measured the polarization transfer coefficient @xmath91 at @xmath67=3.67 gev / c and its dependence on the transverse momentum .",
    "the values are negative , starting form @xmath92 -0.6 and tend towards zero as the momentum increases . from these data it is possible to have a hint of the reaction mechanism , and on the strength and the nature of the @xmath2-interaction .",
    "@xmath91 is related to the two possible amplitudes by an interference term : @xmath93 the reaction can proceed through @xmath94 or @xmath95-exchange . in case of one - meson exchange ,",
    "the two amplitudes are proportional , but with opposite sign : @xmath96 @xmath97 @xmath98 for @xmath99-exchange , one can express the observables as a function of one parameter , the ratio of the amplitudes for @xmath94 and @xmath95-exchange @xmath100 . in this case one",
    "finds : @xmath101 and @xmath102 , and these observables become sensitive to the relative role of the two mesons ( fig .",
    "1 ) . the disto data ( @xmath103 suggest two possible values for @xmath104 : @xmath105 and @xmath106 . in this context",
    ", a measurement of @xmath107 will be discriminative between the following values @xmath108 or @xmath109 .    alternatively ,",
    "from these data one can extract interesting information on the @xmath2-interaction . denoting the ratio between singlet @xmath110 and triplet @xmath111 scattering length as @xmath112",
    ", one can show ( for @xmath74-exchange only ) that : @xmath113 disto results suggest that @xmath114 or @xmath115 and the first possibility seems to be in agreement with the last microscopic calculations from jlich @xcite .",
    "_ at cosy it is possible to do the complete experiment at threshold , for @xmath116 , which requires the measurement of the unpolarized cross section , @xmath107 and @xmath91 .",
    "moreover , polarization observables can give an experimental signature of the parity of the the strange particles , through the measurement of the sign of the spin correlation coefficient , @xmath107 or of the polarization transfer coefficient from the initial proton to the produced hyperon @xcite . _",
    "we have illustrated a formalism which allows to get model independent predictions , in the near threshold region , for vector meson and strange particle production . we have shown the importance of polarization observables in further measurement at cosy .",
