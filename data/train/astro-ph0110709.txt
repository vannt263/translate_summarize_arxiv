    "the identification and study of distant galaxy clusters is of great interest in current astronomical research . as the largest gravitationally bound structures in the universe , the properties and histories of galaxy clusters are highly sensitive to the physics of cosmic structure formation and to the values of the fundamental cosmological parameters @xcite .",
    "while clusters in such well - defined samples as the rosat deep cluster survey ( * ? ? ?",
    "* rdcs ) have been used to constrain @xmath15 and @xmath16 @xcite , the uncertainty in the relation between cluster mass and measurables such as @xmath17 or @xmath18 limits the precision obtainable in calculations of cosmological parameters to @xmath1950% . to improve on this ,",
    "a better understanding of the mass@xmath18 relation and its evolution is necessary . to that end",
    ", we need to study in detail a well - defined sample of clusters at high redshift with independent measures of the cluster mass based on @xmath18 @xcite and weak lensing @xcite .",
    "another equally important use of galaxy clusters lies in studying the formation and evolution of galaxy populations .",
    "progress in understanding early - type galaxy evolution in clusters is being driven by the need to reproduce recent observational results indicating both lower number fractions @xcite _ and _ strong homogeneity and slow evolution in the stellar populations of ellipticals and s0s in moderate redshift clusters @xcite",
    ". a self - consistent explanation of these results can be achieved by invoking an observational bias : the progenitors of the youngest , low - redshift early - types drop out of samples constructed in high redshift clusters . @xcite",
    "have suggested how morphological evolution at @xmath20 coupled with star formation at @xmath21 ( @xmath12 , @xmath22 ) can explain the results cited above .",
    "more complex semi - analytic models of galaxy formation and evolution set in a cdm universe naturally predict the morphological evolution that is a central tenet in the currently fashionable paradigm of cluster galaxy evolution : ellipticals are formed by mergers at @xmath23 of sub @xmath24 galaxies formed at @xmath25 @xcite , and the butcher - oemler effect is the result of spirals being converted into s0s at moderate redshifts @xcite .",
    "for example , the models of @xcite are able to match the small scatter in the color - mag relation of the early - types even at @xmath3 , and the @xmath26 evolution found by e.g.  @xcite can be predicted @xcite .",
    "however the accuracy as well as the details of this scenario for galaxy evolution in clusters is yet open to debate . in the case of the early - types ,",
    "the arguments are based heavily on observations of only a few high - z clusters e.g. , ms1054@xmath2703 at @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "finding clusters at moderate redshifts has become almost routine using serendipitous x - ray searches .",
    "the advent of the rosat - pspc , with its unprecedented sensitivity and spatial resolution , enabled archival searches for extended x - ray sources to become a very efficient method to construct large , homogeneous samples of galaxy clusters out to @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "the rdcs has shown no evidence of a decline in the space density of galaxy clusters of x - ray luminosity @xmath30 over a wide redshift range , @xmath31 ( see rosati 2000 for a recent review ) , though the evolution of the bright end remains controversial .",
    "the fact that the bulk of the x - ray cluster population is not evolving significantly out to this large redshift increases the chances of finding clusters at even higher redshifts , since @xmath32 clusters at @xmath33 ( @xmath34 in the [ 0.5 - 2.0 ] kev band , roughly the coma cluster ) can be detected as extended x - ray sources in deep rosat pointed observations , provided that the x - ray surface brightness profile does not evolve significantly .    at fainter fluxes ( @xmath35 in the rdcs ) the identification of real clusters",
    "becomes more difficult due to the increasing confusion and low signal - to - noise ratio of the x - ray sources which makes it more difficult to discriminate between point - like and extended sources .",
    "below @xmath36 the x - ray completeness level can be as low as 50% , and the spurious rate as high as 50% .",
    "but it is at these flux levels that the most distant clusters in the survey are expected . to improve the success rate of identifying very high redshift clusters in the rdcs ,",
    "we have been carrying out a program of near - infrared imaging of faint unidentified x - ray candidates .",
    "relative to the optical , near - ir imaging is advantageous at high redshifts because the expected k - correction significantly dims the dominant population of early - type cluster galaxies in even the observed @xmath37-band for @xmath38 .",
    "@xcite have shown that optical - infrared colors can be used to considerably enhance the contrast of high redshift cluster galaxies against the field galaxy population and , at the same time , to obtain a useful estimate of the cluster redshift . the cluster found by @xcite , rdcs j0848 + 4453 at @xmath39 , and its neighbor , rdcs j0849 + 4452 at @xmath40 @xcite ,",
    "have been used to push the study of evolution in the colors and morphology of early - type galaxies beyond @xmath41 .",
    "but such studies continue to be severely limited by the dearth of such high redshift clusters @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we describe the imaging and spectroscopic follow - up observations of the extended x - ray source rdcs j0910 + 5422 , which has led to the discovery of a galaxy cluster at @xmath42 .",
    "unless otherwise stated , we adopt the parameters @xmath11 km s@xmath7 mpc@xmath7 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 .",
    "the extended x - ray source rdcs j0910 + 5422 was selected from a deep rosat - pspc observation ; details of the selection procedure are given in @xcite .",
    "the candidate field was observed in the optical at the palomar 5  m telescope with cosmic , which contains a tek3 ccd that provides @xmath43 pixels over a 9.5 arcmin field of view .",
    "an exposure of 2820  s was obtained in the gunn @xmath44-band on 18 february 1999 ut in non - photometric conditions with @xmath45 seeing .",
    "the field was observed again with cosmic in the gunn @xmath44-band in photometric conditions for 300  s on 2000 april 30 .",
    "5 standard stars were observed on the latter night and used to calibrate the photometry onto the vega system .",
    "the data were reduced using standard methods .",
    "the second observation was used to calibrate the deeper , nonphotometric image before the two reduced images were summed .",
    "we obtained @xmath46 and @xmath47 imaging at the palomar 5  m telescope with the prime - focus infrared camera @xcite .",
    "this camera provides a @xmath48 field of view with @xmath49 pixels .",
    "rdcs j0910 + 5422 was observed in photometric conditions on 1998 march 24 .",
    "the flux scale was calibrated using observations of three ukirt standard stars obtained on the same night .",
    "the data were taken using a sequence of dither motions with a typical amplitude of 15 and a dwell time between dithers of 30 seconds .",
    "the data were linearized using an empirically measured linearity curve , and reduced using dimsum . the total integration times and resolutions of the resulting images",
    "are 2310  s and @xmath50 at @xmath46 , and 2880  s and @xmath51 at @xmath47 .",
    "a catalog of objects in the @xmath47-band image was obtained using sextractor @xcite after first geometrically transforming the @xmath47 and @xmath46 images to match the @xmath44-band frame .",
    "the resolution of the ir images was also degraded slightly to match that of the @xmath44-band image .",
    "objects were detected on the @xmath52-band image with the requirement that 10 contiguous pixels , covering an area of 0.78 arcsec@xmath53 , must be 1.5 @xmath54 above the background . for reference",
    "the 3  @xmath54 detection limit is @xmath55 in a 2 arcsec aperture .",
    "all detected objects down to this limit were inspected visually to eliminate false detections .",
    "the catalog was then applied to the @xmath46 and @xmath44 band images to obtain matched aperture photometry .",
    "spectroscopic observations of galaxies in a @xmath196  region around rdcs j0910 + 5422 were obtained using the low resolution imaging spectrometer ( * ? ? ? * lris ) on the keck ii telescope .",
    "objects were assigned slits based on their @xmath2 and @xmath1 colors .",
    "spectra were obtained using the 150 l mm@xmath7 grating which is blazed at 7500  , and covers the entire optical region , with a gradual blue cutoff imposed by the lris optics at @xmath195000   .",
    "the dispersion of @xmath194.8   pixel@xmath7 resulted in a spectral resolution of 23   as measured by the fwhm of emission lines in arc lamp spectra .",
    "usually each mask was observed in a series of 1800  s exposures , with small spatial offsets along the long axis of the slitlets .",
    "one slitmask on the field was used to obtain spectra on 1999 march 10 with a total exposure time of 7200  s , and a second slitmask was used on 2000 february 18 for a total of 10800  s.    the slitmask data were separated into individual slitlet spectra and then reduced using standard longslit techniques .",
    "a fringe frame was constructed for each exposure from neighboring frames in the observation sequence and then subtracted from each exposure to greatly reduce fringing in the red .",
    "the exposures for each slitlet were reduced separately and then coadded .",
    "one  dimensional spectra were extracted for each of the targeted objects .",
    "wavelength calibration of the 1-d spectra was obtained from arc lamp exposures taken immediately after the object exposures .",
    "a relative flux calibration was obtained from longslit observations of the standard stars hz 44 and g191b2b @xcite . while these spectra do not straightforwardly yield an absolute flux calibration of the slit mask data ,",
    "the relative calibration of the spectral shapes is accurate .",
    "rdcs j0910 + 5422 was observed for a total of 200 ks in two pointings in observation 800166 with acis - i .",
    "the first pointing , exposure id#2452 , was performed on 2001 april 24 for 76 ks while the second pointing , exposure id#2227 , was conducted on 2001 april 29 for 124 ks . for each pointing , we removed events from the level 2 event list with a status not equal to zero and with grades one , five and seven .",
    "in addition , we used alexei vikhlinin s software for removing background events in data observed with the very faint telemetry mode .",
    "we then cleaned bad offsets and examined the data on a chip by chip basis , removing times when the count rate exceeded three standard devations from the mean count rate per 3.3 second interval . for chip one",
    ", we specifically excluded the three brightest objects .",
    "one of these objects , identified with hd 237786 , a g5v star , underwent a flare in the second pointing . for this problem , we excluded the peak time intervals in the flare by hand .",
    "we then cleaned each chip for flickering pixels , i.e.  times where a pixel had events in two sequential 3.3 second intervals .",
    "we finally merged the event lists from the two pointings using the combine_obsid shell script provided for this purpose .",
    "the resulting effective exposure time for the summed data is 163 ks .",
    "the main reason for the relatively large amount of time lost from the total exposure is flaring from the bright star in the field .",
    "the presence of a group of very red galaxies at the position of rdcs j0910 + 5422 is obvious in figure  [ ijk ] .",
    "the spatial distribution of the very red galaxies in figure  [ ijk ] is somewhat linear from the ne to the sw ; we will return to this point when discussing the chandra imaging .",
    "figure  [ cmd ] shows the @xmath2 and @xmath1 color - magnitude diagrams for all objects in a 200 arcsec area around rdcs j0910 + 5422 .",
    "a red sequence characteristic of a galaxy cluster may be seen at @xmath56 in the lower panel of figure  [ cmd ] .",
    "this sequence lies some 0.5 mag to the blue of the predicted no - evolution location for early - type galaxies at the cluster redshift .",
    "this prediction was made using photometry of coma galaxies as detailed in sed98 .",
    "this amount of bluing in the @xmath2 color is consistent with the color change due to passive evolution of a single age @xmath57 stellar population formed in a 0.1 gyr burst at @xmath58 ( using the gissel models of @xcite ) .",
    "there is an indication that the red sequence in rdcs j0910 + 5422 has a flatter slope relative to the coma sequence , but this result is very uncertain . the slope difference is not likely to be due to differences in the photometry of the galaxies in coma and rdcs j0910 + 5422e.g . , apertures of the same physical size were used on both clusters .",
    "a similarly flatter slope was tentatively found in rdcs j0848 + 4453 at @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "the observed scatter in the @xmath59 colors of the member galaxies is 0.09 mag and the measurement error is 0.08 mag , indicating a very small amount of intrinsic scatter , @xmath190.04 , in the rest frame @xmath60 colors .",
    "the optical spectra for the 9 member galaxies are presented in figure  [ optspec ] .",
    "redshifts were calculated both by visual identification of emission and absorption features and by cross - correlating the spectra with an e template from @xcite using the iraf package rvsao / xcsao @xcite and are listed in table  [ table1 ] .",
    "the redshift measurements primarily are based on major features such as ca ii h+k and oii@xmath61 , and is also sensitive to spectral breaks such as d4000 and b2900 .",
    "spectra were obtained for a total of 15 color - selected targets ; of these redshifts were determined for 13 and 8 are cluster members ( one serendipitous spectrum is a member ) .",
    "the locations of the member galaxies are shown on the color composite image in figure  [ ijk ] .",
    "i d  # 161 , which lies outside our @xmath47 image , was discovered serendipitously in an lris mask to be at the cluster redshift and has relatively strong [ oii ] .",
    "two objects ( i d  # 23 and 57 ) show weak [ oii ] emission , while the remaining member galaxies have spectra typical of early - type galaxies in the present epoch , albeit with smaller d4000 .",
    "to measure the x - ray flux in the acis - i image , we centered a circular aperture with a radius of 100  at 09h10m449 , + 54d22m089 ( j2000 ) .",
    "the position was chosen by the flux weighted centroid of all events at 0.52.0 kev within 20  of the visual center of the cluster . from this circular aperture",
    ", we excluded seven point sources .",
    "each point source was identified from the smoothed contour map overlaid on the composite optical and near infrared image .",
    "we then fit an elliptical @xmath62 model and a constant background to the events within the 0.52.0 kev map .",
    "we used a map binned into 1  pixels and fit the model using the ciao package sherpa @xcite with the cash statistic @xcite .",
    "we first explored the parameter space with 3000 monte carlo samples , and then refined the best fitting monte carlo result .",
    "our best fitting model has a core radius of 194 @xmath63 0.6 and a @xmath64 .",
    "our best - fitting model was mildy elliptical , with an ellipticity of @xmath65 . at the redshift of the cluster ,",
    "the core radius would be 171.1 @xmath63 5.3 kpc .",
    "these values are typical of low redshift clusters .    for an estimate of the background spectrum , we chose three separate regions .",
    "each background region was visually inspected which resulted in the removal of bright point sources .",
    "we fit all three regions jointly , using the program xspec @xcite , with a two component model ( refered to as a background model in the program xspec ) consisting of a powerlaw , not convolved with the telescope effective area , and a gaussian for the 2.1 kev au emission line .",
    "each region had a seperate normalization for the two components .",
    "we used separate response matrices for each region , and we generated these using alexei vikhlinin s calcarf / calcrmf tools .",
    "we extracted a spectrum of the cluster using an elliptical aperture .",
    "the semi - major axis of the ellipse was twice the core - radius of the cluster .",
    "we fixed the background to the values from the best fitting model above , with the normalizations rescaled by the relative area in the aperture .",
    "freezing the background and the absorption by galactic hydrogen at @xmath66 @xmath67 , obtained from the 100  maps of @xcite , we fit a raymond - smith spectrum using the cash statistic to the spectrum shown in figure  [ acis_spec ] in the source aperture .",
    "we found a best fitting temperature of kt@xmath68 kev . the best fitting flux in the rosat band of 0.5 - 2.0 kev was @xmath69 within the 388 aperture .",
    "the flux as measured in the rdcs in the same band from rosat data was @xmath70 .",
    "most of the difference between the rosat and chandra fluxes is due to the exclusion of the point sources detected in the acis image from the latter flux .",
    "the total bolometric luminosity of rdcs j0910 + 5422 is @xmath71 when integrated over the whole of the @xmath62 model . the errors on the temperature , flux , and luminosity were determined using 2000 iterations of the fakeit command in xspec .",
    "unfortunately we are unable to determine the metallicity of the icm to see if the canonical 1/3 @xmath57 seen in clusters up to @xmath72 @xcite continues beyond @xmath73 .",
    "a total mass can be estimated from the @xmath18 , assuming an isothermal sphere and extrapolating the x - ray emission to @xmath9 mpc using the best fit profile @xcite .",
    "the total mass of rx  j0910 + 5422 derived from the new x - ray data is @xmath74 within @xmath9 mpc .",
    "recent results obtained with chandra and xmm on the icm in lower - redshift clusters indicate that , apart from drops in the central regions due to cooling flows , the temperature profiles are fairly constant out to large radii , implying that mass estimates based on the assumption of isothermality are reasonable @xcite .",
    "several point sources were detected in the vicinity of the extended x - ray emission of the cluster , demonstrating the importance of high spatial resolution when attempting to accurately measure the properties of the icm in high-@xmath75 clusters .",
    "one of the fainter point sources is associated with a cluster member , id#23 , which has weak emission lines and a relatively blue continuum .",
    "this object has @xmath76 in the [ 0.510 ] kev band . as seen in figure  [ ijk ]",
    "there is a close neighbor with which id#23 could be interacting ; higher resolution imaging will be useful to answer this question .",
    "id#23 is probably a low luminosity agn , though we did not find evidence of the nev line at @xmath773426 in our lris spectrum which is usually detected in such objects .",
    "a second much brighter x - ray point source ( @xmath78 ) just to the northeast of cluster center is associated with the @xmath52-band object id#21 which has the colors ( @xmath79 and @xmath80 ) of a cluster galaxy but for which we have no spectrum .",
    "a third point source , id#61 , is also of interest because it is a hard x - ray source and a photometric member .",
    "such galaxies are of particular value as they may represent a source of early heating during the formation of the icm .",
    "though the x - ray morphology largely appears to be that of a relaxed system , there are indications that this cluster is still forming .",
    "indeed given its high redshift and the expectations of cluster building which should occur at these redshifts according to @xmath81cdm simulations , evidence of e.g.  mergers are to be expected . as shown in figure  [ shock ] , there is some evidence in the acis data for temperature structure or merging in the icm .",
    "the soft component dominates the central area of the x - ray emission , while to the south there is a harder component .",
    "such a temperature distribution in the icm could be due to an infalling group , or to mass streaming in along a filament .",
    "indeed , the spatial distribution of the galaxies in the cluster gives the impression of filamentary structure , reminiscent of that seen in cdm simulations of cluster formation @xcite .",
    "the spectrophotometric properties of all the known members in rdcs j0910 + 5422 are summarized in table 1 .",
    "two of the member galaxies show signs of current star formation , and one of these may be an agn due to its x - ray emission .",
    "the spectra and colors of 6 of the spectroscopic members are broadly similar to those of a passively evolving elliptical galaxy formed at @xmath82 .",
    "but from these data alone , it is unclear if the luminous galaxies in the red sequence formed via hierarchical merging at @xmath83 or as a single object at @xmath84 .",
    "age dating the spectra could provide additional information on the formation epoch of the galaxies ; but such detailed modelling is burdened with its own uncertainities due to the age ",
    "metallicity degeneracy .",
    "progress on the issue of the assembly of early - type galaxies in clusters is most likely to occur with determining the morphologies of the member galaxies using high resolution hst imaging on a large sample within rdcs j0910 + 5422 , and in other similarly high-@xmath75 clusters .",
    "the chandra data conclusively show the presence of hot gas trapped in the potential well of a massive cluster .",
    "this is the third instance in the rdcs of a cluster at @xmath41 with a well - defined icm .",
    "the acis spectra yield a @xmath8 kev , and a total @xmath85 , both near the values for an @xmath24 cluster in the present epoch .",
    "furthermore , the position of rdcs j0910 + 5422 in a plot of @xmath17 vs @xmath18 , shown in figure  [ lxtx ] , shows little if any evolution in the @xmath86 relation at @xmath41 , in keeping with the results of borgani et al .",
    "along with the well - defined red envelope , these properties indicate that rdcs j0910 + 5422 is another example of a massive cluster with an old galaxy population and a hot icm already in place at @xmath41 .",
    "the authors thank the staffs of keck and palomar observatories , and the builders of the chandra x - ray observatory for providing the means with which we obtained our data .",
    "we also thank paolo tozzi for assistance with the reductions of the chandra data , and tom jarrett for assistance with the use of pfircam at palomar .",
    "support for sas came from nasa / ltsa grant nag5 - 8430 and for bph from chandra grant go1 - 2141a .",
