    "observations of galaxies via 21-cm line , both emission and absorption , have proven to be valuable for our understanding of the abundance and distribution of h  i gas , and processes leading to star formation . in the local universe ,",
    "blind 21-cm emission - line surveys using single - dish telescopes provide reliable measurements of the h  i mass density ( zwaan et al .",
    "these surveys are complemented with the spatially resolved h  i images obtained using interferometers to trace the large scale dynamics of the galaxies ( e.g. bosma 1981 ; fisher & tully 1981 ; meyer et al . 2004 ; oosterloo , fraternali & sancisi 2007 ; de blok et al . 2008 ; walter et al . 2008 ) .",
    "since h  i gas in galaxies extends farther than the stellar disk , it is also the component of the galaxy that is most affected by interactions and is therefore a good tracer of tidal interactions and merger effects ( haynes , giovanelli & robert 1979 ; rosenberg & schneider 2002 ) .",

    "is not limited by distance and depends only on the strength of the background radio sources and 21-cm absorption cross - section of the galaxies . due to",
    "the limitations imposed by the narrow receiver bandwidths and the hostile radio - frequency interference ( rfi ) environment , systematic blind searches of 21-cm absorption have not been possible till now .",

    "the only case ( j124157.54 + 633241.6 ) where we have 21-cm detection is when the radio sight line is passing through the stellar disk ( as we detect emission lines from the galaxy in the qso spectrum ) .    amongst the qgps with 21-cm detections from the literature ( table  [ qgplit ] ) , in the three cases",

    "thus it appears that the lack of 21-cm absorption in 50% of the cases with impact parameter less than 20kpc could be related to the smaller extent of h  i gas in galaxies and probably not related to the filling factor of cold gas in the extended h  i disk / halo . confirming this conclusion with a large number of qgps with low impact parameter is important for our understanding of high-@xmath67 21-cm absorbers .",
    "the presence of ca  ii and/or na  i absorption can also be used as a tracer of neutral gas . detecting significant amounts of these two species",

    "the rest equivalent widths of ca  ii are available for 7 dlas at @xmath88 that are searched for 21-cm absorption ( rao et al .",
    "2003 ; kanekar & chengalur 2003 ; nestor et al .",
    "2008 ; zych et al . 2009 ) .",
    "interestingly only one of them has ca  ii equivalent width greater than 0.3  .",
    "this is very much different from the 21-cm detection in the case of qgps .",
    "there are a few interesting differences to note .",
    "first of all , the typical impact parameters of the dlas used in fig .  [ lowzdla ] are less than 10kpc while for the qgps values are typically between 10kpc to 20kpc .",
    "the 21-cm optical depth , measured in qgps is typically less than what one measures in the case of dlas .",
    "the low ca  ii equivalent width measured in the case of dlas , despite having higher 21-cm optical depth and smaller impact parameters may be related to the low metallicity of the high - z gas .",
    "indeed nestor et al . (",
    "2008 ) find that only 25% of the dlas known at 0.6@xmath89@xmath901.3 have w(ca  ii)@xmath840.35  .",
    "thus dlas may be a biased population that avoids sight lines through dusty star - forming galaxies .",
    "detectability of 21-cm absorption depends on @xmath9(h  i ) , @xmath91 and the fraction of the background source covered by the absorbing gas . as described before ,",
    "most of the 21-cm absorption surveys have been designed to detect 21-cm absorption from gas pre - selected by the presence of a dla or strong mg  ii absorption ( e.g. briggs & wolfe , 1983 ; carilli et al . 1996 ; lane 2000 ; kanekar & chengalur 2003 , 2009a ; curran et al . 2007 ; gupta et al .",
    "2007 , 2009 ; srianand et al . 2010 ) . in the case of dlas",
    ", there is a possible decline in the 21-cm detection rate with increasing redshift ( kanekar & chengalur 2003 ) .",
    "since for the dlas the total @xmath9(h  i ) along the line of sight is known from the damped lyman-@xmath18 line , the decline in 21-cm absorption detection rate could be related either to the redshift evolution of spin temperature of the gas or to the redshift evolution of the covering factor ( kanekar & chengalur 2003 ; curran & webb 2006 ; kanekar et al .",
    "however these results are based on a small number of systems and in addition at @xmath922 the dla samples to search for 21-cm absorption are poorly defined .",
    "most of the successful searches for 21-cm absorption are based on mg  ii pre - selection .",
    "a systematic survey of 21-cm absorption at @xmath93 using @xmath1400  hrs of gmrt time has resulted in the largest number of 21-cm detections till now ( gupta et al .",
    "2007 , 2009 ) .",
    "this , together with a shallower survey at @xmath94 by lane ( 2000 ) , suggests a possible decline in the 21-cm absorber number density ( @xmath95 ) with increasing @xmath67 .",
    "this is in contrast to a strong increase in the mg  ii number density over the same redshift range ( see fig .  11 of gupta et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "results presented here suggest that , while the detection rate of 21-cm absorption from qgps is 50% when the impact parameter is less than @xmath120kpc , nearly in every case of non - detection the quasar sight line does not pass through either the stellar disk or the extended h  i gas .",
    "semi - analytical model of galaxy evolution and direct observations from good and gems fields suggest a decrease in the optical size of the galaxies from @xmath96 to @xmath97 ( mo et al .",
    "1998 , ravindranath et al . 2004 ; trujillo et al .",
    "the observations are consistent with the size of a galaxy at a given stellar mass at @xmath98 to be @xmath99% that of a galaxy at @xmath96 .",
    "semi - analytic models coupled with millennium dark matter simulations suggests that the radius of the h  i gas at @xmath100 is roughly half of that at @xmath96 ( obreschkow & rawlings , 2009 ) .",
    "based on this we expect the impact parameter around a typical galaxy at @xmath101 to be a factor 1.5 to 2 less than the value of @xmath120kpc we find for the qgps and @xmath94 dlas ( rao et al .",
    "therefore , the observed decrease in @xmath95 could be a consequence of the small size of the optical disk and the extent of associated cold h  i disk / halo .",
    "this needs to be understood in the context of the observed increase in the number density of absorption systems with redshift at optical / uv wavelengths .",
    "obviously , this requires identifying both ( 1 ) the physical processes that determine the absorption cross - section and ( 2 ) the underlying population of absorbing galaxies .",
    "the sdss database provides the means to make progress in this direction for 21-cm absorbers by constructing systematic samples of qgps and rgps .",
    "spectral stacking methods have shown that high equivalent width mg  ii systems are possibly associated with star forming regions ( noterdaeme , srianand & mohan , 2010 ; mnard et al .",
    "it is also found that the average emission line flux for a given equivalent width range depends only weakly on the redshift ( mnard et al .",
    "all this suggests that stacked spectra of mg  ii systems with 21-cm absorption should show stronger emission lines than the ones without 21-cm absorption .",
    "it will be interesting to check this once we have a sufficient number of 21-cm absorbers .",
    "we have presented the results of our gmrt _ mini_-survey to search for 21-cm absorption in a sample of 5 qgps ( total 9 sight lines ) at @xmath102@xmath103 .",
    "we report one clear detection of 21-cm absorption in the quasar ( @xmath2=2.626 sdss j124157.54 + 633241.6 ) @xmath3 ( @xmath4=0.1430 sdss j124157.26 + 633237.6 ) . in this case",
    "the quasar sight line pierces through the stellar disk of the galaxy .",
    "we infer metallicity , star - formation rate and reddening for the galaxy from the sdss spectrum . the column density inferred from the reddening estimates are consistent with the 21-cm absorbing gas being cold .    combining our sample with the @xmath13 qgps ( 10 additional sight lines with impact parameter less than 20kpc ) available from the literature",
    ", we show the detectability of 21-cm absorption with integrated optical depth in excess of 0.1 km / s to be @xmath104% when the impact parameter is less than @xmath120kpc . using the surface brightness profiles and",
    "well established relationship between the optical size and extent of the h  i disk ( inferred from 21-cm emission observations ) known for _ nearby _ galaxies , we conclude that in most of the cases of 21-cm absorption non - detection , the sight lines may not be passing through the h  i gas .",
    "we also find that whenever 21-cm absorption is seen ca  ii absorption is detected in the optical spectrum .",
    "however , the reverse is not true .",
    "this means even at low redshifts metal absorption may originate from a larger area where the h  i gas may be warm ( high @xmath91 ) or ionized .",
    "further we notice that @xmath16 dlas with 21-cm absorption detections have lower equivalent widths despite having higher 21-cm optical depths and smaller impact parameters .",
    "this suggests that the current sample of dlas may be a biased population that avoids sight lines through dusty star - forming galaxies .    at present",
    "the sample size is small and h  i 21-cm emission maps are not available for most of the objects in the sample to investigate the dependence of detectability on various quantities like ( i ) extent of the h  i disk , ( ii ) metallicity and star - formation rate , ( iii ) dependence of 21-cm absorption on the type of galaxies , and ( iv ) the role of environmental factors such as tidal interactions and merger effects .",

    "<S> we present the results from our 21-cm absorption survey of a sample of 5 quasar - galaxy pairs ( qgps ) , with the redshift of the galaxies in the range 0.03@xmath0 , selected from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) . </S>",
    "<S> the h  i 21-cm absorption was searched towards the 9 sight lines with impact parameters ranging from @xmath110 to @xmath155kpc using giant metrewave radio telescope ( gmrt ) . </S>",
    "<S> 21-cm absorption was detected only in one case i.e. towards the quasar ( @xmath2 = 2.625 sdssj124157.54 + 633241.6 ) @xmath3 galaxy ( @xmath4 = 0.143 sdssj124157.26 + 633237.6 ) pair with the impact parameter @xmath111kpc . </S>",
    "<S> the quasar sight line in this case pierces through the stellar disk of a galaxy having near solar metallicity ( i.e ( o / h)+12 = 8.7 ) and star formation rate uncorrected for dust attenuation of 0.1m@xmath5 yr@xmath6 . the quasar spectrum reddened by the foreground galaxy is well fitted with the milky way extinction curve ( with an a@xmath7 of 0.44 ) and the estimated h  i column density is similar to the value obtained from 21-cm absorption assuming spin temperature ( t@xmath8 ) of 100k .    in the remaining cases , </S>",
    "<S> our gmrt spectra provide upper limit on @xmath9(h  i ) in the range , ( 10@xmath10)@xmath11t@xmath8@xmath12 . combining our sample with the @xmath13 data available in the literature , we find the detectability of 21-cm absorption with integrated optical depth greater than 0.1kms@xmath6 to be 50% for the impact parameter less than 20kpc . </S>",
    "<S> using the surface brightness profiles and well established relationship between the optical size and extent of the h  i disk known for _ nearby _ galaxies , we conclude that in most of the cases of 21-cm absorption non - detection , the sight lines may not be passing through the h  i gas ( 1@xmath14 column density of few times 10@xmath15@xmath12 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that in comparison to the absorption systems associated with these qgps , @xmath16 dlas with 21-cm absorption detections have lower equivalent widths despite having higher 21-cm optical depths and smaller impact parameters . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that the current sample of dlas may be a biased population that avoids sight lines through dusty star - forming galaxies . a systematic survey of qgps over a wider redshift range using a large sample is needed to confirm these findings and understand the nature of 21-cm absorbers .
