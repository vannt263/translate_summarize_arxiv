    "quasar environments have been studied on different scales , from those of the host galaxy to those of the quasar - cluster cross - correlation function .",
    "yee & green ( 1984 ) found that there is a difference in richness between the environments of radio - quiet and radio - loud quasars ( rqqs and rlqs respectively ) .",
    "this result has been confirmed by ellingson , yee & green ( 1991 ) , showing that rqqs are much less frequently situated in very rich galaxy clusters than rlqs .",
    "confirmation came also from hintzen , romanishin & valdes ( 1991 ) , who found a significant excess of galaxies in the vicinity of rlqs , and from boyle & couch ( 1993 ) , who found no significant excess of faint galaxies in association with rqqs .",
    "hutchings , crampton & johnson ( 1995 ) obtained a different result ; they observed the galaxy environment of rlqs and rqqs and concluded that there is no significant difference in the richness . since the rqqs in that sample were members of a large quasar group ( lqg ) ( crampton , cowley , & hartwick 1989 , 1987 ) , this result raised the question of whether the environments of members of lqgs could be different .",
    "however , some of the more recent results for quasars in general imply that the richness of the environments of radio - loud and radio - quiet quasars could indeed be very similar ( e.g. saxton , hall & turner 1999 , wold et al .",
    "2001 ) , whereas others still support the scenario of rlqs inhabiting more dense groups of galaxies than rqqs ( hutchings et al . 1999 ,",
    "teplitz et al . 1999 ,",
    "snchez & gomzles - serrano 1999 ) .",
    "the above results have been obtained using galaxy counts or the quasar - galaxy cross - correlation function within small radii ( @xmath5 mpc ) around the quasars .",
    "the interpretation of the results is not a straightforward task , because of the erasure of directional information .",
    "for example , quasars residing centrally in poor clusters would produce similar statistics to those on the priepheries of very rich clusters .",
    "originally , the twofold environment of quasars was interpreted as supporting the connection of rlqs with elliptical host galaxies and rqqs with spirals ( e.g. ellingson et al .",
    "however , in the past few years evidence has emerged that rqqs may have diverse host galaxies . in a sample studied by bahcall et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , for example , more rqqs have been found in elliptical hosts than in spirals . the result has been confirmed by boyce et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , and by mclure et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , who found that , just like radio - loud quasars , essentially all rqqs with luminosities greater than @xmath6 reside in massive ellipticals . in many cases",
    "the host galaxies show traces of continuing interactions or past mergers ( e.g. bahcall et al .",
    "1997 , boyce et al .",
    "1998 , hutchings et al . 1999 ) .",
    "even if the host galaxies appear in the optical passbands to be isolated and apparently undisturbed , they are found to exhibit continuing or remnant tidal hi disruptions , indicating galactic encounters or mergers ( lim & ho 1999 ) .",
    "the emerging picture is that rlqs have elliptical host galaxies and prefer a cluster environment whereas the rqqs inhabit various host galaxies in a wide range of environments . at present",
    "we have no information on how the close environment ( @xmath5 mpc ) of quasars is related to the large - scale structure traced by galaxy clusters , and if indeed the local enhancements of the density in the vicinity of quasars can be interpreted as galaxy clusters .",
    "this prompted us to introduce a new approach and look at the environments of quasars in the context of large - scale structure ( lss ) .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,>,>,^,^ , < \" , ]     the application of the above procedure to the @xmath7 36 deg@xmath8 area of investigation produced a sample of 72 galaxy clusters with estimated redshifts in the range @xmath9 .",
    "the resulting density is 2.0 clusters deg@xmath10 with @xmath11 . because of the magnitude limit",
    ", only 13 ( optically brightest ) clusters with @xmath12 have been detected .",
    "figure 2 shows some examples of the detected clusters with different morphologies and redshifts .",
    "the data for all the detected clusters have been compiled in table 2 .",
    "the positions are expressed in ra and dec ( j2000 ) and as @xmath13 and @xmath14 which are the coordinates in arc minutes from the field centre ( used in all figures ) .",
    "the area of a cluster core is here defined as the area of the convex hull enclosing all the voronoi cells of the early - type galaxies found to be members of the cluster .",
    "it gives a good measure of the core of the cluster , preserving its morphology .",
    "the number of galaxies ( @xmath15 ) in a cluster core is here defined as the background corrected number of objects found within the convex hull defining the boundary of the core .",
    "the radius ( @xmath16 ) is the minimum radius necessary to enclose the whole convex hull .",
    "the colours of the red sequences have been established by inspection of the colour - magnitude plots for every cluster .",
    "the redshift @xmath17 has been estimated using the red sequence approach and the colours of elliptical galaxies compiled by fukugita et al .",
    "the uncertainty of the estimate is @xmath18 due to the uncertainties in the photometric calibration .",
    "the abell richness ( @xmath19 ) of the clusters has been computed using the estimated redshifts to calculate the angular extent of the abell radius ( @xmath20 mpc ) .",
    "the background counts , used for background corrections , have been taken as those of a region without any detected clusters .",
    "the identifications of the previously known clusters have been indicated in the final column .",
    "the area of investigation contains 16 published galaxy clusters , 3 of which have known redshifts .",
    "we identified 14 of these clusters including all those with known redshifts .",
    "the 2 clusters we could not identify may be spurious since they were detected only as density peaks in 2d or have few ellipticals and so are below our threshold in the colour slices .",
    "figure 3 gives the comparison of the published centres of the clusters and those determined using colour slices .",
    "the difference is strongest for the lowest redshift cluster ( x=81 , y=22 , @xmath21 ) ; most of the other clusters agree very well .",
    "the three known redshifts ( 0.03 , 0.07 , 0.15 ) allowed an improvement of our redshift estimate at @xmath22 by direct calibration of the colour - redshift sequence .",
    "the purpose of our investigation is to establish whether quasars trace the same structures as the galaxy clusters .",
    "the quasar sample covers the redshift range @xmath23",
    ". however , the cluster sample appears to be very incomplete at @xmath12 forcing us to limit the main investigation to one redshift slice , @xmath3 .",
    "the area of the quasar survey is smaller than that populated by detected clusters .",
    "only objects in the common area ( @xmath24 deg@xmath25 ) of both quasar and cluster samples have been selected for the environmental study .",
    "the final sample comprises 17 galaxy clusters and 7 quasars ( figure 4 ) .",
    "the problem of connecting discrete objects into a continuous structure can be approached using another graph theoretical method , the minimal spanning tree ( mst ) .",
    "this method has been successfully tested for finding lqgs in quasar samples ( graham 1997 ) .",
    "the minimal spanning tree ( mst ) is a geometric construct , originating in graph theory , which was introduced by kruskal ( 1956 ) and prim ( 1957 ) .    in our case",
    "the nodes of the mst are the galaxy clusters . for the purpose of this study we did not attempt to separate the mst to recover the galaxy superclusters , but preserved the continuous lss .",
    "when looking at figure 4 , it can be seen that quasars populate the region delineated by the mst as lss . in order to test the statistical significance of this result we resampled the quasar distribution using a monte carlo method . as a measure of",
    "how close the quasars follow the lss , we have used the sum of the distances between quasars and their closest mst edges @xmath26 .",
    "the result of 100,000 simulations has been plotted as a histogram in figure 5 .",
    "the test rejects the null hypothesis that the quasars are distributed independently of the lss in clusters at a level of significance of 0.009 .",
    "from figure 4 , it can be seen that the quasars appear to avoid the central density peaks of the clusters , and reside instead in two types of environments .",
    "most of them ( 5 out of 7 ) reside on the distant ( 3 - 5@xmath27 mpc ) peripheries of the galaxy clusters tracing the same lss .",
    "this is an important result , suggesting that the topology of the density field in the quasar environments might be a crucial parameter connected with the triggering of quasar formation and the controlling of their evolution .",
    "some of the quasars ( 2 out of 7 ) , however , are found between two very close clusters .",
    "such an arrangement suggests that quasar formation might also be associated with cluster mergers .",
    "figure 6 illustrates the density distribution and the two close clusters around a quasar at @xmath28 .",
    "the estimated redshifts of both galaxy clusters are comparable to that of the quasar , suggesting that all three objects are physically associated .",
    "the second merger candidates are more difficult to verify .",
    "both clusters found in the vicinity of a quasar at @xmath29 ( figure 7 ) are obscured by foreground clusters .",
    "they have clear red sequences in the colour - magnitude diagram but the enclosing polygons and redshift estimates are nevertheless less reliable than in the first case outlined above .",
    "the redshifts of both clusters are estimated to lie in the range @xmath30 which is compatible with the redshift of the quasar .",
    "this result suggests that quasars found in rich environments are actually not in the centres of galaxy clusters but mark the regions of cluster / subcluster mergers by residing between two ( or more ) density peaks . with only two quasars",
    ", however , this needs to be confirmed with a larger sample ( work in progress ) .",
    "the majority of the studies of the richness of the environments of quasars have relied on counting galaxies within a quite small radius @xmath31 mpc without consideration of the morphology of the distribution .",
    "such an approach provides a fast means of tabulating and comparing the richness within large data sets .",
    "however , to ensure a correct interpretation of the results , we must determine what physical structures in the galaxy distribution are associated with quasars .",
    "we have studied the association of quasars with optically detected clusters of galaxies . by reconstructing the lss in a relatively narrow redshift band ( @xmath3 ) ,",
    "we have been able to show that quasars follow the large - scale structure traced by galaxy clusters .",
    "the quasar - cluster lss investigated in this paper is on the scale of superclusters ( @xmath32 mpc ) , which suggests that quasars could be used to trace the distribution of superclusters .",
    "oort , arp & de ruiter ( 1981 ) brought forward for the first time the hypothesis that quasars are located in superclusters using the statistics of close quasar pairs as evidence .",
    "it is normally expected that clusters of galaxies trace mass , and that the lss of galaxies also traces mass .",
    "our results show that quasars trace the mass ( galaxies ) on supercluster scales for low redshifts @xmath33 .",
    "it means that the formation / fuelling process of quasars is coupled , at low redshift , to the large density perturbations , which makes quasars useful indicators of mass at @xmath33 .",
    "we should not , however , simply extend this conclusion to higher redshifts without observational support because the relative importance of different mechanisms for quasar formation will almost certainly vary with redshift .",
    "secondly , none of the quasars in our radio quiet sample is located in the central area of a galaxy cluster .",
    "apart from the two quasars found between merging clusters , all the others reside on the distant ( 3 - 5@xmath27 mpc ) peripheries of galaxy clusters .",
    "the peripheral position of rqqs in relation to galaxy clusters was first noticed by yee & green ( 1984 ) when assessing by eye the distribution of companion galaxies in the vicinity of quasars .",
    "yee ( 1992 ) noticed that @xmath34 quasars do not reside close to the cd galaxies marking the centres of clusters , but these results do not seem to have been pursued further .",
    "hashimoto & oemler ( 2000 ) found that galaxy interactions are more likely in galaxy groups and very poor clusters .",
    "they found also about the same ratio of interactions in rich clusters as in the field , three times less then in groups and poor clusters .",
    "the fact that most quasars in our sample ( 5 out of 7 ) avoid strongly the rich environments of the central regions of galaxy clusters is compatible with models connecting the majority of low @xmath17 quasars with galaxy groups and suggesting that major galaxy - galaxy mergers are the main , but not the only , mechanism of quasar formation at low @xmath17 .",
    "lastly , we find that quasars found in very rich environment ( 2 out of 7 ) may actually be located between two very close galaxy clusters . due to the relatively small number of quasars in our sample",
    "it is not possible to draw conclusions about the percentage of such objects in the overall quasar population .",
    "two clusters separated by a distance @xmath35 mpc are expected to have entered already the pre - merger stage ( schindler 2001 ) in which strong gas compression accompanied by heating occurs .",
    "the high velocities of galaxies found in merging clusters do not favour major galaxy - galaxy mergers as a quasar formation mechanism , but rather point towards galaxy harassment ( lake , katz & moore 1998 ) .",
    "however , cluster / subcluster mergers produce compression of hot gas between two subclusters shortly before they collide and shock waves after the collision ( schindler 1999 ) . considering the complex nature and the high energetics of the gas compressions and displacements already during the pre - merger stage of two galaxy clusters",
    ", we should consider also a model in which a quasar is formed in a galaxy - gas interaction .",
    "it has been argued that strong star formation can be triggered by the influence of dense icm at the confluence of a cluster / subcluster merger ( evrard 1991 ) .",
    "our result for @xmath0 quasars , combined with the fact that haines et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and tanaka et al .",
    "( 2000 ) found quasars on the peripheries of clusters at @xmath36 and 1.1 , with some being accompanied by a band of star - forming galaxies and some evidence again for cluster mergers , suggests that such a process could indeed be one of the quasar formation mechanisms .    to determine the relative contributions of the cluster - merger like and distant periphery like environments to formation of quasars",
    ", we are planning to study a large quasar sample , spanning a wide redshift range .",
    "the inclusion of radio - loud quasars will allow us to quantify the results as functions of redshift and radio - loudness .",
    "multiwavelength observations will be required to establish the role of the icm in triggering the formation of quasars .",
    "the x - ray morphology of the merging clusters will give us information about the distribution of the hot gas .",
    "imaging of the host galaxies and their close companions will be used to find traces of recent mergers or interactions .",
