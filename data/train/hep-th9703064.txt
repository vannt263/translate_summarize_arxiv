    "the result is shown in fig.3 .",

    "if this compactified space is identified with a part of our space , the internal gauge symmetry changes as time goes on . these time - dependent symmetry , however , may not be observed in the asymptotic region . because only the dimensionful scale factor in the model is the slope parameter @xmath20 which is of the order of the planck scale , the time dependence appears only at an early stage @xmath68 and none in the asymptotic region @xmath69 , where we are supposed to live .    here",
    "some important comments are in order .",
    "first , the length of @xmath56-cycle goes to zero at @xmath70 .",
    "but if one looks at the size of @xmath47-dual space , which means the interchanging of @xmath71 and @xmath72 in this case @xmath40 , the spatial components of the metric tensor turns out to be g_d= (    cc 1+t^2 2t^2 & 1-t^2 2t^2 + 1-t^2 2t^2 & 1+t^2 2t^2    ) , with the time - dependent dilaton @xmath73 , and the sizes of those cycles in @xmath3-space at @xmath70 are given by ^2,^28 ^ 2 .",
    "[ eq27 ] these are same as in @xmath14-space structure at @xmath74 .",
    "therefore , it would be convenient for @xmath75 region to use @xmath3-space and for @xmath76 region to use @xmath14-space to describe physical phenomena .",
    "in fig.4 we show how the space of the solution i looks like as @xmath0 goes on .",
    "fig.4     secondly , the difference of the lengths of cycles @xmath56 and @xmath54 in the asymptotic region @xmath74 has occurred even if the local metric is assumed to have common diagonal elements .",
    "this can be understood from fig.1-(a ) , where the parallelogram @xmath77 moves toward @xmath78 and it collapses flat as @xmath0 goes to infinity , i.e. the distance @xmath79 approaches zero .",
    "however the scaling factor blows up as @xmath0 goes on @xmath80 and @xmath56 approaches a finite value @xmath81 as shown in ( [ eq27 ] ) .",
    "thirdly , we have to consider the constraints required from the reparametrization invariance of the action ( [ eq3 ] ) .",
    "the one is the vanishing hamiltonian condition @xmath40 h=-1 2 p_0^  2&+&1 2=0 , [ eq28 ] where only zero oscillation modes are chosen because we are interested in the low energy state modes .",
    "the integers @xmath82 and @xmath27 represent the momentum and the winding numbers , respectively .",
    "the equation ( [ eq28 ] ) determines the low energy spectra as p_0^  2=[n_i(g^-1)^ijn_j + m^i(g - bg^-1b)_ijm^j+2m^ib_ik(g^-1)^kjn_j ] .",
    "another constraint comes from the rescaling invariance @xmath83 , which is equivalent to @xmath40 _",
    "i=1,2n_im^i=  0 .",
    "[ eq30 ]    for the solution i with @xmath48 , for instance , the low energy spectrum is given by p_0^  2&=&1 2t^2  [ ( 1+t^2)n_1 ^ 2 + 2(1-t^2)n_1n_2+(1+t^2)n_2 ^ 2 + & + & t^2\\{(1+t^2)(m^1)^2 - 2(1-t^2)m^1m^2+(1+t^2)(m^2)^2 } ] .",
    "[ eq31 ] in ( [ eq31 ] ) as @xmath18 , the winding mode terms for nonvanishing @xmath27 diverge and so they are not excited to give @xmath84 . the constraint ( [ eq30 ] ) is now automatically satisfied .",
    "the spectra in the asymptotic region is therefore given by p_0^  2~1 2(n_1-n_2)^2 + 1 2t^2(n_1+n_2)^2 , [ eq32 ] where @xmath85 and @xmath86 are the momentum excitation numbers in the asymptotic region , which are respectively associated with the cycles @xmath56 and @xmath54 .",
    "the result , that the second term in ( [ eq32 ] ) provides dense spectra while the first term discrete ones in the asymptotic @xmath0-region , agrees with the results ( [ eq24 ] ) and ( [ eq25 ] ) .",
    "the similar argument works for @xmath87 as well .",
    "corresponding to the two momentum modes the effective dimensions of the asymptotic space is concluded to be @xmath88 both in @xmath87 and @xmath69 .    in finite time regions , around @xmath68 for example , the only constraint we have to consider is ( [ eq30 ] ) and energy spectra are determined by three independent quantum numbers .",
    "the result is natural because on such a small compactified torus both winding modes and center - of - mass momentum modes co - exist without extreme high energy excitations .",
    "this fact has been recently analyzed in connection with the possibility of the information transmission from @xmath89 to @xmath90 region @xmath91 .",
    "fig.5  the motion of @xmath37 for the solution ii .    this is the case for the general solution under the condition of @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "the metric solution we study here is given by ( [ eq15 ] ) with @xmath48 in ( [ eq16 ] ) .",
    "the space structure can be represented with the parallelogram opqr on @xmath37-plane in fig.5 , and as @xmath0 grows the point p moves toward s along a quasi - semicircle , shown with a dotted line in fig.5 .",
    "the path is deformed from a semi circle because of the time dependence of @xmath94 . in this case",
    "the solution i is a special case where @xmath96 .",
    "one of the cycles of the space is chosen along or and the length is given by ( [ eq23 ] ) : s_2^  2= 4 ^ 2e^- .",
    "the other cycle @xmath56 , as in the case of ( [ eq25 ] ) , is chosen among the other topologically independent cycles in such a way that the length is shortest . for small value of @xmath0 , @xmath57 and then @xmath58 are legitimate and the lengths",
    "are respectively given by s_1^  2=\\ {    l ^2=4 ^ 2\\{(e^+e^-)+2c(t^2 2+d ) } + ^2=4 ^ 2e^- +    .    in order to understand the space structure in the asymptotic region where @xmath18",
    ", we first consider the case of @xmath97 being a rational number , namely , = = e^  l k  ( t ) , provided @xmath98 and @xmath99 being positive and mutually prime integers . in this case",
    "one can show that the length of the shortest cycle @xmath56 turns out to be s_1^  2&=&8 ^ 2ke^\\{-c(t^2 2+d ) } + & & 8 ^ 2l c  ( t ) , [ eq36 ] which is finite . to understand this result ,",
    "let us look at the case where @xmath100 and @xmath101 ( fig.6 ) , where the space is represented on a lattice , each block of which represents our space .",
    "as the time @xmath0 grows , the angle @xmath102 collapses to zero and the point @xmath103 approaches to @xmath104 . for large @xmath0 , therefore , the distance @xmath105 is shorter than any other cycles although it crosses @xmath54-cycle three times .",
    "taking account of the scale factor @xmath106 , one can confirm @xmath56 approaching to a finite value ( [ eq36 ] ) with @xmath101 .",
    "for other rational values of @xmath107 , ( [ eq36 ] ) may be easily confirmed .",
    "fig.6  the shortest cycle in the limit of @xmath18 .",
    "on the other hand , another cycle @xmath54 grows in proportion to @xmath0 because the space is again stretched in one direction while the other cycle kept finite .",
    "it may be inferred that , although the cycle @xmath56 crosses the other cycle @xmath54 three times , there may be another choice of @xmath108 such that the cycle @xmath56 crosses the new cycle @xmath108 only once .",
    "the cycle @xmath59 in fig.6 is the one but the length grows to infinity again .    in case of the value @xmath109 being an irrational number , one can choose a series of rational numbers , @xmath110 , which converges to the irrational number @xmath94 as @xmath111 .",
    "the length @xmath56 , as is observed in ( [ eq36 ] ) , grows to infinity as well as @xmath54 .",
    "it should however be , noticed that the path @xmath56 crosses @xmath54 infinite times .",
    "to look at the space around @xmath87 , we again study the @xmath47-transformed solution . the metric is now given by g_d=1 t^2",
    "(    cc e^- & -c(t^2 2+d ) + -c(t^2 2+d ) & e^ +    ) , with the dilaton = _ 0+t^2 , and the cycle sizes are generally given by & ^  2 & :  2 ^ 2c\\{(e^+e^-)-2 } +   + & ^  2 & :   2 ^ 2e^c .",
    "the reason why both of @xmath112 and @xmath113 are finite as @xmath69 comes from the fact that the upper side of the parallelogram is shifted along the cycle @xmath113 so that the closed cycle @xmath112 must also be stretched along the @xmath113 direction .",
    "if one diagonalizes the metric @xmath114 in the limit @xmath69 one of the eigenvalues approaches to zero while the other to a finite value , hence the torus actually collapses to a one - dimensional ring with a finite length in the limit .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the area of torus approaches to zero as the scale factor @xmath115 shows .",
    "finally , let us look at the energy spectra coming from the zero modes .",
    "the energy @xmath116 is given by p_0^  2&=&1 t^2 , which approaches to ( e^2m^1+e^-2m^2)^2t^2+(finite  terms  as  t ) , as @xmath0 goes to infinity .",
    "since infinite excitation energy should be suppressed , one has to again choose @xmath117 for large @xmath0 , which satisfies the constraint ( [ eq30 ] ) as well .",
    "the energy spectra in this asymptotic region are now given by p_0^  2&=&c 2(1 + 2cd t^2)(e^-2n_1-e^2n_2)^2 + &  & + 1 ct^2(e^-n_1^  2+e^n_2^  2 ) .",
    "[ eq42 ]    if @xmath94 is a rational number , the first term in ( [ eq42 ] ) provides a series of discrete spectra , while the second term a series of continuous ones .",
    "the result is consistent with the fact that @xmath56 is finite while @xmath54 grows infinity as @xmath18 .    in the case of @xmath94",
    "being an irrational number , there exists a series of numbers @xmath118 which accumulates to @xmath94 , and even the first term provides a series of continuous spectra .",
    "this is again consistent with the cycle lengths discussed before .",
    "as for the region where @xmath87 , the situation is same as above except that now the winding modes survive instead of the momentum modes .",
    "we have studied the time development of two - dimensional string universe with torus structures . if the ratio of the two parameters @xmath109 approaches to a rational number as @xmath18 , the space has been shown to be asymptotically stretched out along a cycle , while the length of the other cycle is kept finite at around a planck size .",
    "this suggests to us an interesting possibility that even in the critical string theories , some characters of the metric might imply the shrinkage of a certain number of dimensions of the space .",
    "if one traces the expanding universe backward in time to the past , the space shrinks to the space having both dimensions finite , and enters to the universe where @xmath3 space dominates .",
    "the space again grows large as @xmath0 approaches to zero .",
    "no spatial singularity appears around @xmath68 where the space size is minimum . in this model",
    "the large size universe in @xmath3-space comes into the world at @xmath87 and then develops .    in connection with the shrinkage of partial dimensions mueller @xmath119 studied in the case of the space having @xmath120 structure . in his model , if the radius of @xmath64-th circle , @xmath121 , is given by r_i=_i(t - t_0)^p_i  ,  i=1,2,,d-1 .",
    "a condition in the asymptotic region _",
    "i=1^d-1p_i^2=1 , is obtained for real constants @xmath122 .",
    "our result is consistent with his condition because for @xmath123 we can choose @xmath124 and @xmath125 .    in our work",
    "we have disregarded all the oscillation modes , so that the arguments can not be applied to the cosmology where the high temperature effects may play a crucial role around @xmath68 . however , if we regard the two - dimensional space to be part of the critical string theory in the asymptotic time region , the present results are of great interest since the small sized compact space follows as a result of a certain condition over the metric tensor .",
