    "while elemental abundances in the photosphere of a - type stars , which are of particular interest because of the chemical anomalies of various types , have been extensively studied by a number of investigators so far , those of the alkali elements ( li , na , and k ) are barely known even nowadays , despite of their importance in stellar spectroscopy .",
    "this is presumably due to the fact that these elements ( with one valence electron weakly bound ) are characterized by fairly low ionization potential ( @xmath12  45  ev ) and most of them are ionized in the atmospheric condition of early - type stars , leaving only a tiny fraction as neutral .",
    "since detecting spectral lines of the dominant ionized species is almost hopeless ( because of the closed - shell configuration requiring vary large excitation energy ) , one is obliged to measure the very weak lines of neutral species ( li  i , na  i , k  i ) . thus , the necessity of using sufficiently high - s / n spectra must have hampered past researchers from investigating the abundances of these elements .",
    "still , sodium has been comparatively well studied ( e.g. , lane & lester 1987 ; varenne & monier 1999 ; gebran et al . 2008 , 2010 ; gebran & monier 2008 ; fossati et al .",
    "2007 , 2008 ) mainly by using subordinate lines ( na  i 5682/5688 or 6154/6160 ) of moderate strengths ( i.e. , neither too strong nor too weak ) , which are less affected by the non - lte effect . however , na abundance determinations in a - type stars conducted so far are restricted to sharp - lined late - a stars ( @xmath13  k ) as well as f - type stars , and thus na compositions of early - a through late - b stars ( @xmath14  k ) remain essentially unexplored , except for our previous non - lte investigations for the very bright stars of sirius ( takeda & takada - hidai 1994 ) and vega ( takeda 2008 ; hereinafter refereed to as paper i ) , and the recent lte studies of fossati et al . ( 2009 ) for two sharp - lined late - b stars ( 21  peg and @xmath15  cet ) .",
    "recently , takeda et al .",
    "( 2009 ; hereinafter referred to as paper ii ) carried out an extensive non - lte analysis of na  i resonance d lines at 5890/5896  @xmath16 for a large ( 122 ) sample of a - type stars ( 7000  k  @xmath17  k ) including rapid as well as slow rotators , with an aim to establish their na abundance behaviors in general .",
    "unfortunately , however , since the d lines are so strong and the resulting abundances are quite sensitive to the microturbulent velocity @xmath18 , it turned out that ambiguities in the choice of @xmath18 ( which is likely to be depth - dependent and difficult to assign a value relevant for the high - forming strong d lines ) prevented from precise sodium abundance determinations .",
    "almost the same situation holds for lithium : determinations of li abundances in a - type stars have been essentially restricted to late - a stars with @xmath13  k ( e.g. , burkhart & coupry 1991a , 1991b , 1995 , 2000 ; burkhart et al .",
    "2005 ; north et al . 2005 ) , while early - a stars ( @xmath14  k ) remain practically untouched . admittedly , this is a very difficult and challenging task , as the li  i  6708 line considerably weakens as @xmath4 becomes higher .",
    "the work of paper i may be counted as an exceptional case , where the li abundance of vega could somehow be evaluated from the very weak li  i  6708 line ( @xmath19  m@xmath16 ) based on a spectrum of ultra - high s / n ratio .",
    "coupry and burkhart ( 1992 ) reported the @xmath20(li  i  6708 ) of @xmath21  peg ( a well - known very sharp - lined early - a star ) to be 1.3  m@xmath16 , which was used in paper i ( cf . appendix  a therein ) to argue that the li abundance of @xmath21  peg is almost consistent with the solar - system composition .",
    "however , as will be shown in this paper ( cf . subsection 4.2 ) , we consider that their measurement is an erroneous overestimation and li is definitely underabundant in @xmath21  peg .",
    "this example well illustrates the enormous difficulty of li abundance derivation in hot a - type stars .",
    "investigations of potassium abundances are even more lacking . as for late - a stars ( @xmath13  k ) ,",
    "it is ( to our knowledge ) only the study of fossati et al .",
    "( 2007 ) that reported the k abundances of late - a and am stars in the praesepe cluster , though their neglect of the non - lte effect ( which may be significant for such a resonance line as k  i  7699 ) prevented from obtaining reliable results ( cf .",
    "subsection 4.4 therein ) .",
    "meanwhile , almost nothing has been reported so far regarding the potassium abundances in early - a stars , except for paper i where vega s k abundance could be successfully established .",
    "it is thus evident that our current knowledge on the behaviors of alkali - element abundances in a - type stars is considerably insufficient .",
    "given this situation , we decided to carry out a systematic spectroscopic study aiming at establishing the photospheric abundances of na , li , and k for an homogeneous sample of a - dwarfs ( 7000  k  @xmath17  k ) based on the spectral data of high quality . since measurements of very weak lines are concerned in the present case ( especially for early - a stars ) , we had to confine ourselves only to sharp - lined stars ( @xmath0  km  s@xmath1 ) .",
    "this inevitably leads to the inclusion of a number of am stars ( metallic - lined a stars ) , which are characterized by deficiencies in comparatively light elements ( c , n , o , ca , sc ) as well as excesses of heavier elements ( such as fe - group or neutron - capture elements ) , since am peculiarities are preferably observed in slow rotators ( such as frequently seen in binaries ) .",
    "accordingly , the purpose of this paper is to clarify and discuss the behaviors of na , li , and k abundances in slowly - rotating a - type stars based on the results of our analysis , while paying attention to the possible connection ( if any exists ) between these alkali elements and the appearance / degree of am anomalies .",
    "we selected 21 sharp - lined stars  uma ; magnetic ap star ) and hd  40932 ( @xmath22  ori ; double - lined binary ) because of their apparently unusual spectra , despite that these two stars have @xmath23 values less than 50  km  s@xmath1 . ] satisfying @xmath0  km  s@xmath1 from 122 a - type stars , studied in paper ii , where na  i 5890/5896 d lines were analyzed based on the spectra ( @xmath24 and s / n ratios of a few hundreds ) obtained by using boes ( bohyunsan observatory echelle spectrograph ) attached to the 1.8  m reflector at bohyunsan optical astronomy observatory ( boao ) .",

    ", in order to augment the spectral data for early - a stars for which very high - quality is required to measure very weak lines of neutral alkalis , we also used the spectra of 7 bright sharp - lined stars ( @xmath15  dra , @xmath25  lyr , @xmath25  cma , @xmath26  gem , 15  vul , 68  tau , and @xmath21  peg ) , which were observed with the hides spectrograph ( high dispersion echelle spectrograph ; izumiura 1999 ) attached to the 1.88  m reflector at okayama astrophysical observatory ( oao ) .",
    "while the data of @xmath25  lyr were taken from the digital atlas ( based on the observations carried out on 2006 may 14 ) published by takeda , kawanomoto , and ohishi ( 2007 ) as in paper i , those for the remaining 6 stars were secured by the observations on 2008 october 4 ( 15  vul , 68  tau , @xmath21  peg ) , october 7 ( @xmath25  cma , @xmath26  gem ) , and october 8 ( @xmath15  dra ) .",
    "these 2008 oao data , which cover the wavelength range of 41007800  @xmath16 with three mosaicked ccds of 2k@xmath274k pixels , have high spectral resolution ( @xmath28 ) and very high s / n ratio ( typically @xmath29 , or even higher for the very bright @xmath25  cma and @xmath26  gem ) .",
    "we call these 7 stars as `` oao sample . ''",
    "note that the following 4 stars are common to both of the boao and oao samples : hd  172167=@xmath25  lyr , hd  48915=@xmath25  cma , hd  47105=@xmath26  gem , and hd  27962=68  tau .",

    "regarding the effective temperature ( @xmath4 ) and the surface gravity ( @xmath31 ) of each program star , we simply adopted the values used in paper ii for 21 boao sample stars ( including 4 oao samples in common ) .",
    "as for the remaining 3 oao stars , those for 15  vul and @xmath21  peg were determined photometrically from strmgren s @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 colors along with the @xmath35 index by using napiwotzki et al.s ( 1993 ) calibration ( as in paper ii ; cf .",

    "cf . section 5 therein ) , we assumed somewhat larger ambiguities than these in view of the comparison with various published values ( cf . section iv - c in takeda et al .",
    "the uncertainty in @xmath18 was estimated from the dispersion  30% ) is regarded as a typical ambiguity in @xmath18 , which can also be recognized by comparing various @xmath18 values published so far ( see , e.g. , figure 1 in coupry & burkhart 1992 ; figure 2 in gebran & monier 2007 ) . yet , apart from this intrinsic dispersion , our @xmath18 values tend to be somewhat larger than the previously reported results ( usually based on @xmath20 values of fe lines of various strengths ) .",
    "for example , our figure 3f suggests that the maximum @xmath18 attained at mid - a type is @xmath12  45  km  s@xmath1 , while it is @xmath5  km  s@xmath1 in figure 2 of coupry and burkhart ( 1992 ) ; also , our @xmath18 results are systematically higher by @xmath12  1  km  s@xmath1 with those of landstreet et al .

    "we suspect that this may be due to a depth - dependence of @xmath18 decreasing with height ( cf .",
    "section 5 in paper ii ) .",
    "that is , our @xmath18-determination ( based on 61466163  @xmath16 fitting ) tends to reflect the physical condition in deeper layers ( larger @xmath18 ) because of being mainly controled by the deep - forming o  i  61558 triplet lines of high excitation , while the conventional method using @xmath20s of high - forming strong lines may yield comparatively lower @xmath18 . ] in the @xmath18 vs. @xmath4 relation ( figure 3f ) .",
    "since resonance lines of alkali elements with low - ionization potentials are concerned in the present case , it is comparatively easy to understand ( at least qualitatively ) how the abundance is affected by changing each parameter .",
    "that is , since almost all atoms are in the ground state of the first - ionized ( closed - shell ) stage , and only a small fraction of them remain neutral , the number population of the ground level of the neutral atoms ( @xmath51 , which is proportional to the line opacity @xmath52 ) is expressed as @xmath53 according to saha s equation ( @xmath54 is the abundance , @xmath55 , @xmath56 is the ionization potential ( @xmath12  45  ev ) , and @xmath57 is the electron density ) .",
    "then , the dependence of the line - opacity ( @xmath52 ) upon @xmath58 ) and @xmath59 may be written as @xmath60 where we put @xmath61 and used the approximation @xmath62 ( @xmath63  1/32/3 depending on @xmath4 ; see , e.g. , gray 2005 ) .",
    "consequently , the abundance ( @xmath54 ) resulting from a given equivalent width is strongly dependent upon @xmath64 as @xmath65 because of the exponential factor ( i.e. , @xmath54 increases as @xmath4 becomes higher ) .",
    "the @xmath31-dependence is somewhat more complicated because the effect of the continuum opacity ( @xmath66 ) has to be taken into consideration . for late a - type stars of",
    "comparatively lower @xmath4 ( @xmath12  70008000  k ) , h@xmath67 opacity is still important and @xmath66 has almost the same @xmath59-dependence as @xmath52 ; thus the abundances turn out rather independent on @xmath59 because of the cancellation in the @xmath68 ratio determining the line strength ( cf .",
    "takeda et al .",
    "meanwhile , for early a stars of higher @xmath4 where paschen continuum opacity of neutral hydrogen is dominant , @xmath59-dependence in @xmath52 directly reflects the line strength and the abundance scales as @xmath69 ( i.e. , @xmath54 decreases as @xmath31 becomes higher ) .",
    "finally , regarding the effect of @xmath18 ( @xmath54 tends to decrease with an increase in @xmath18 ) , the abundance results are practically inert to any change in @xmath18 , since weak lines in the linear part of the curve of growth are concerned in most of the present cases ( though only the na abundances derived from na  i 5688 line for late a stars with @xmath70  8000  k exceptionally show some appreciable @xmath18-dependence ; cf . figure 5f ) .",
    "we will show in section 3 that these expected trends can be actually confirmed by actual calculations ( cf . figures 5 , 8 , and 10 ) .",
    "the abundances of na ( @xmath43(na ) ) were already obtained from the fitting analysis in the 61466163  @xmath16 region ( including na  i 6154/6160 lines ) as described in subsection 2.3 , which are given in electronic table e. however , while the na  i 6154/6160 lines are quite suitable for na abundance determination for late - a stars , they become considerably weak as @xmath4 becomes higher and the accuracy of @xmath43(na ) may be comparatively low at early - a stars , especially for the non - metal - rich case ( actually , @xmath43(na ) of hd  172167=vega in the boao sample could not be determined ; cf .",

    "we therefore decided to determine the na abundances from the spectra in the 56805690  @xmath16 region including the na  i 5682/5688 lines ( stronger than na  i 6154/6160 while not too strong to be seriously sensitive to @xmath18 ) .",

    "1996 for more details of the non - lte calculations ) , the non - lte k abundance ( @xmath3(k ) ) or its upper limit was determined for each star ( with the atomic parameter of the line in table 2 ) , as given in table 1 .",
    "these results of @xmath20 and @xmath3(k ) , along with the corresponding non - lte corrections ( @xmath72 ) and the abundance variations ( @xmath73 ) in response to perturbations of the atmospheric parameters , are plotted against @xmath4 in figure 10 , and are also presented in electronic table e.    ( 50mm,160mm)figure10.eps",
    "we are now ready to answer the questions which motivated this study ( cf . section 1 ) : `` how do the abundances of na , li , and k behave in sharp - lined a - type stars ? how are they related with the am peculiarities frequently seen in slow rotators of this @xmath4 range ? '' in figure 11 are plotted the resulting [ @xmath3(na ) , @xmath3(li ) , and @xmath3(k ) ] against @xmath3(fe ) and @xmath23 ( determined in subsection 2.3 ) , both of which are the key quantities closely connected with the am phenomenon . based on this figure as well as figures 5c , 8c , and 10c ( showing the @xmath4-dependence ) ,",
    "the abundance characteristics of these elements are discussed in the following subsections , where we also compare the observed trend with the theoretical prediction from the atomic diffusion theory by richer , michaud , and turcotte ( 2000 ) as well as talon , richard , and michaud ( 2006 ) .",
    "( 80mm,200mm)figure11.eps      regarding na , we notice in figure 11a a significant trend of remarkably tight correlation between @xmath3(na ) and @xmath3(fe ) .",
    "actually , a slight @xmath23-dependence in @xmath3(na ) ( similar to that seen for @xmath3(fe ) in figure 3b ) is observed in figure 11a@xmath89 . since @xmath3(fe ) is known to be one of the am indicators in the sense that larger overabundance of fe is accompanied by stronger am stars , this observational fact means that na behaves in accordance with fe ( i.e. , the excess of na is a measure of am anomaly just like that of fe ) .    while na abundances of am(+fm ) and normal a(+f ) stars ( though mostly restricted to those with @xmath13  k ) in the field as well as in open clusters have been reported by several recent studies based on na  i 5683/5688 or 6154/6161 lines being less sensitive to non - lte effects ( e.g. , lane & lester 1987 ; varenne & monier 1999 ; gebran et al .",
    "2008 , 2010 ; gebran & monier 2008 ; fossati et al .",
    "2007 , 2008 ) , nobody seems to have explicitly mentioned this trend .",
    "however , an inspection of the results of these papers suggests tendencies of ( i ) moderately supersolar [ na / h ] and ( ii ) [ na / h](am )  @xmath90  [ na / h](normal a ) .",
    "therefore , the existence of this positive correlation between [ na / h ] and [ fe / h ] appears almost certain .    from a theoretical point of view ,",
    "however , such a conformance behavior between na and fe has never been predicted by any element segregation simulation designed for explaining am peculiarities such as that of richer et al .",
    "( 2000 ) or talon et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , which suggests that [ na / h ] remains almost solar or even slightly subsolar in spite of an appreciable overabundance of [ fe / h ] ( cf . figure 14 of richer et al . or figure 16 of talon et al . ) .",
    "therefore , the current diffusion theory ( considered to be most promising for understanding the am phenomena ) is evidently imperfect at least in terms of na , which remains to be improved . here , the na  fe correlation revealed in this study would serve as an important observational constraint . besides , it is interesting that the apparently metal - deficient stars with @xmath3(fe )  @xmath91  6.97.0 ( @xmath25  lyr and hd  218396=hr  8799 ) almost follow the same @xmath3(na)@xmath3(fe ) relation defined by am and normal stars with @xmath92  [ fe / h ]  @xmath93 . since these two stars are known to be vega - like stars ( which may be related to so - called @xmath45  boo stars ; see , e.g. , kamp & paunzen 2002 , paunzen et al .",
    "2002 ) , there might be some connection between am and @xmath45  boo anomalies .",
    "( see also the last paragraph of subsection 2.3 . )",
    "according to figures 11b and 11b@xmath89 , we do not see any clear @xmath3(fe)- as well as @xmath23-dependence in @xmath3(li ) which has values around or slightly lower than the solar - system abundance of @xmath94 .",
    "this may suggest that am and normal a - type stars do not show any manifest difference in terms of their surface li abundances .",
    "we recognize , however , a tendency of @xmath4-dependence for late a - type stars in the sense that @xmath3(li ) gradually decreases from @xmath94 ( @xmath95  k ) to @xmath96 ( @xmath97  k ) while such a systematic trend is not seen for early a - type stars ( @xmath14  k ) where @xmath3(li ) tends to be around the solar system abundance of @xmath94 ( figure 8c ) .",
    "this @xmath4-dependent tendency of @xmath3(li ) in late - a stars is also observed in figure 2 of north et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , and is more or less consistent with the theoretical prediction by richer et al .",
    "( 2000 ; cf . figure 14 therein ) .    it should be noted , however , that several stars apparently deviate from this general trend and show considerable li - deficiencies ( i.e. , only the upper limit was derived since the li line could not be detected ) . here , especially important",
    "are the following 4 stars : hd  204188 ( 7622  k , @xmath98 ) , hd  141795 ( 8367  k , @xmath99 ) , @xmath21  peg ( 9453  k , @xmath100 ) , and @xmath25  cma ( 9938  k , @xmath101 ) .",
    "what makes such an exceptional depletion of li ?",
    "all these are classified as am stars ( @xmath21  peg is also an am star according to adelman 1988 , though the conventional type of a1  iv is given in table 1 ) , though am alone can not be the condition to trigger such a marked underabundance of li , because there are a number of other am stars that do show normal behavior of li .",
    "actually , most of the present sample of low @xmath23 stars more or less show some degree of chemical peculiarities . in this connection ,",
    "burkhart and coupry ( 1991a ) stated ( based on their study of late a - type stars ) that `` occurrence of li - deficient stars is not exceptional without any clearcut division between normal and am stars . '' yet , as far as early a - type stars are concerned , the fact that li tends to remain almost unaffected in near - normal stars such as @xmath26  gem ( believed to have almost the solar abundances ; e.g. , adelman & philip 1996 , lehmann et al .",
    "2002 ) and @xmath15  dra ( which were previously considered as normal even though later found to have only weak am anomaly ; cf .",
    "sadakane & okyudo 1990 ) might suggest the existence of some connection between the conspicuous li deficit of @xmath25  cma or @xmath21  peg and their am phenomenon .    here",
    ", we have to remark that the conclusion of paper i ( the photospheric li abundance of @xmath21  peg almost coincides with that of the solar - system composition ; cf . appendix a therein ) , which was based on the @xmath20(li  6708 ) value of 1.3  m@xmath16 taken from table 1 of coupry and burkhart ( 1992 ) , was not correct .",
    "as can be seen from figure 7 , the li  i  6708 line is not detectable even on the spectrum of s / n  @xmath29 ; and we derived the upper limit of its equivalent width as @xmath20(6708 )  @xmath102  m@xmath16 ( cf . the electronic table e ) following equation ( 1 ) .",
    "we suspect , therefore , that coupry and burkhart ( 1992 ) misidentified / mismeasured this line , since the quality of their spectrum with typical s / n of @xmath103 ( cf .",
    "section 1 therein ) is evidently insufficient for measuring such an extremely weak line .",
    "our revised conclusion for @xmath21  peg is @xmath3(li )  @xmath104 , which means that its photospheric li abundance is at least by @xmath105  dex deficient compared to the solar - system value .      regarding @xmath3(k )",
    ", we can observe ( from figure 10c ) a trend in terms of @xmath4 just similar to the case of @xmath3(li ) : @xmath3(k ) of late a - type stars appears to systematically decrease from @xmath8 ( @xmath9  k ) to @xmath10 ( @xmath11  k ) , while such a systematic trend is not seen for early a - type stars ( @xmath14  k ) where @xmath3(k ) is almost solar around @xmath8 ( an exception is @xmath21  peg which shows a clearly subsolar abundance of @xmath106 ) .",
    "meanwhile , it also appears that @xmath3(k ) s of late a - type stars are weakly dependent upon @xmath3(fe ) as well as @xmath23 in the sense that k gets more deficient as the am anomaly becomes stronger ( cf .",
    "the red circles in figures 11c and 11c@xmath89 ) .",
    "accordingly , the deficiency of k ( particularly seen in late - a stars of @xmath13  k ) may be controlled by two factors ( @xmath4 and the degree of am peculiarity ) .",
    "richer et al s ( 2000 ) simulation based on the theory of atomic diffusion ( along with radiative acceleration ) predicts a small overabundance of k at higher @xmath4 ( @xmath107  k ) region , whereas a marginal underabundance is expected at the lower @xmath4 side ( @xmath108  k ) ( cf .",
    "figure 14 therein ) .",
    "such a predicted trend of positive @xmath109(k)/@xmath110 gradient is in qualitative agreement with what we found from figure 10c .    as mentioned in section 1 , k - abundance determinations of a - type stars",
    "have so far been tried only by fossati et al .",
    "( 2007 ) in their lte analysis of the k  i 7699 line for late - a stars in the praesepe cluster .",
    "according to their results for 5 stars , we see @xmath111[k / h]@xmath112  @xmath113 ( cf .",
    "figure 10 and table 3 therein ) .",
    "considering that the typical ( negative ) non - lte corrections amount to @xmath12  0.30.4  dex at the relevant @xmath4 range ( cf .",
    "figure 10b ) , we may state that their results would turn out to be mildly subsolar when the non - lte effect is taken into consideration , and become more consistent with our conclusion .",
    "motivated by the fact that our current understanding on the abundances of alkali elements in a - type stars is considerably insufficient , we conducted a comprehensive non - lte analysis to establish the photospheric abundances of na , li , and k for 24 selected sharp - lined a - type stars ( @xmath0  km  s@xmath1 , 7000  k  @xmath2  10000  k ) , many of which are am stars showing different degree of chemical peculiarity .    for this purpose",
    ", we primarily invoked the spectra of moderately high - dispersion ( @xmath24 ) and high s / n ratio ( typically a few hundreds ) obtained with boes at boao / korea , though spectra of much higher quality ( @xmath28 and s / n  @xmath114 ) secured with hides at oao / japan were additionally used for 7 apparently bright stars ( mostly of early a - type ) .",
    "we first carried out spectrum fitting analyses applied to the 61466163  @xmath16 region and derived @xmath18 , @xmath23 , @xmath3(o ) , and @xmath3(fe ) , from which the degree of am characteristics for each star could be confirmed .",
    "the abundances of sodium , which were determined by the spectrum fitting method applied to the region comprising na  i 5682/5688 lines , revealed a significant trend that @xmath3(na ) tightly scales with @xmath3(fe ) , which means that na becomes enriched similarly to fe in accordance with the degree of am phenomenon .",
    "this result should be regarded as important because it seriously contradicts the prediction from the atomic diffusion theory .    regarding lithium , @xmath3(li ) derived from the weak li  i line at 6708  @xmath16 showed a tendency of @xmath4-dependence for late a - type stars in the sense that @xmath3(li ) gradually decreases from @xmath94 ( @xmath95  k ) to @xmath96 ( @xmath97  k ) , while @xmath3(li ) for early a - type stars ( @xmath14  k ) tends to be around the solar system abundance of @xmath94 .",
    "however , several stars apparently deviating from this general trend and showing marked underabundances do exist , though what triggers such a li deficiency is not clear .",
    "the abundances of potassium derived from the k  i 7699 line revealed a tendency somewhat similar to the case of lithium : an apparent @xmath4-dependence ( and possibly with a weak anti - correlation with am peculiarity ) exists for late - a stars where @xmath3(k ) tend to be mildly subsolar systematically decreasing from  @xmath8 ( @xmath9  k ) to @xmath10 ( @xmath11  k ) , whereas those for most early - a stars remain near - solar around @xmath12  5.05.2 .    when these observational facts are compared with the theoretical prediction of richer et al .",
    "( 2000 ) or talon et al .",
    "( 2006 ) based on their atomic diffusion calculations , a serious discrepancy is found for na ( almost no anomaly or slightly subsolar tendency is predicted , while an enrichment of na just like fe is suggested from our analysis ) , though the simulated results appear to qualitatively reproduce the general trends observed for li and k. further improvement and development on the theoretical side would be desirably awaited to explain the results concluded in this study , which may serve as important constraints for any theory aiming to account for the origin of chemical anomalies in am stars .",
