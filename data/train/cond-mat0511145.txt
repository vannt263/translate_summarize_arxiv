    "terahertz radiation ( @xmath0 thz ) has enormous promising applications in very different areas of science and technology such as space astronomy , wideband communications and biosecurity , to name a few ( for recent reviews , see @xcite ) .",
    "one of the main challenges is to construct a coherent miniature source of thz radiation that can operate at room temperature .",
    "currently many groups worldwide are working in this direction .",
    "along with many experimental and technological problems there are still several fundamental problems to be solved . in particular , the traditional lasing scheme is based on a population inversion between different energy levels .",
    "a great recent achievement was the development of quantum cascade lasers that can operate at thz frequencies employing quantum transitions between the energy levels in multiple quantum well heterostructures @xcite .",
    "these quantum nanodevices require a low temperature to achieve a significant population difference .",
    "continuous improvements in the design of thz quantum cascade lasers allow to increase the temperature of operation above @xmath1 k @xcite .",
    "however , it would be a quite difficult , if ever possible , to reach population inversion at room temperature . really , the spacing of the energy levels , which is necessary to emit radiation at frequencies of the order of @xmath2 thz , is comparable with the room temperature in proper units .",
    "this simple observation makes it attractive to study other suggestions for nano - devices that do not require population inversion for the generation of thz radiation .",
    "the bloch oscillator is an inversionless thz laser that is based on bloch oscillations of miniband electrons in a dc - biased semiconductor superlattice .",
    "the continuous operation of a bloch oscillator has still not been demonstrated in any experiments .",
    "the development of a superlattice bloch oscillator has been initiated by suggestion of esaki - tsu @xcite and theoretical analysis of ktitorov , simin and sindalovskii @xcite .",
    "the main obstacle in the experimental realization is the formation of high - field electric domains in superlattice .",
    "nowadays the problem of thz bloch oscillator again attracts much attention ( for review , see @xcite ) .",
    "there are several interesting suggestions for modifications of the original scheme of bloch oscillator , which in principle should allow to reach thz gain in superlattice without formation of destructive electric domains .    in this report , we first briefly review the static electric properties of superlattices and their influence on both small - signal gain and electric instability in section  [ sec_static ] . in the original part of this report we develop the idea of a large - amplitude thz bloch oscillator suggested by kroemer @xcite .",
    "we consider a dc - biased superlattice subjected to a monochromatic ac probe field , so that the total electric field acting on the miniband electrons is @xmath3 note that in a real device the probe field with the amplitude @xmath4 should be a mode of resonator tuned to a desirable thz frequency .",
    "it is well known that while a superlattice device should allow strong gain for a small ac field ( @xmath5 ) in the wide range of frequencies from zero up to several thz , simultaneously destructive electric instabilities would arise inside superlattice ( see section  [ sec_static ] ) . as kroemer has demonstrated for particular values of superlattice parameters , the ac field with a large enough @xmath4 can suppress domains but still preserve significant thz gain @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite the single scattering constant approximation was used . however , a more realistic approximation allow two different relaxation constants , @xmath6 for the electron velocity and @xmath7 for the electron energy .    using the technique of superlattice balance equations ( section  [ sec_balance ] )",
    ", we re - examine the thz gain and the criterion of electric stability for the case of large @xmath4 .",
    "our main aim is to find how robust the kroemer scheme of bloch oscillator is against the effect of different relaxation constants ( section  [ sec_main ] ) . here",
    "our main finding is that this effect does not dramatically change the results obtained within the single scattering constant approximation , if ratio @xmath8 .",
    "moreover , for @xmath9 the differences from the results obtained within the single relaxation time approximation are insignificant .    in section  [ sec_time - scales ]",
    "we consider the characteristic time scales for the development of space - charge instabilities and for the growth of the ac field due to high - frequency gain in superlattice .",
    "we come to the conclusion that it really is possible to suppress a destructive accumulation of charges in the case of thz oscillations with large amplitudes .",
    "however , our estimates still demonstrate that it is very difficult to switch the device in the regime of large amplitudes before electric domains would be formed .",
    "discussion devoted to this and other remaining problems in the realization of thz bloch oscillator is presented in the final section .",
    "let us first review the static electric properties of superlattices using a single relaxation time .",
    "nonlinear electron transport in a superlattice with applied dc bias @xmath10 is a well - studied problem .",
    "the dc current through the superlattice depends on the dc bias as @xcite @xmath11 here @xmath12 is the esaki - tsu critical field , @xmath13 is the peak current corresponding to @xmath14 , @xmath15 is the scattering time , @xmath16 is the density of carriers , @xmath17 is the maximal electron velocity in the first miniband , @xmath18 is the miniband width , @xmath19 is the period of superlattice , @xmath20 is the temperature , @xmath21 is the cross sectional area of superlattice and @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the modified bessel functions .",
    "the dependence of @xmath24 on @xmath10 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : et ] .",
    "for @xmath25 the current - field characteristic demonstrates negative differential conductance ( ndc ) . note that @xmath26 with @xmath27 being the bloch frequency .",
    "therefore the condition of static ndc is also @xmath28 . for typical semiconductor superlattices and for the applied dc bias @xmath29 kv / cm",
    ", the bloch frequencies belong to thz range @xcite .    in the following it",
    "is useful to consider the esaki - tsu current ( [ eq : et ] ) as a function of voltage drop over one superlattice period @xmath30 with @xmath31 .",
    "we turn to the consideration of electron transport under the action of combination of dc and ac fields .",
    "the time - dependent current induced in superlattice by the field ( [ e - mono ] ) can be represented as @xmath32.\\ ] ] absorption of the probe ac field is proportional to the first fourier component of the time - dependent current @xmath33 .",
    "negative absorption or gain corresponds to @xmath34 .",
    "we start the discussion of small - signal gain ( @xmath5 ) with the case of quasistatic interaction @xmath35 . in this case",
    ", it is easy to show that @xmath33 is proportional to the slope of static vi characteristic @xcite .",
    "therefore , a choice of working point in the ndc portion of superlattice vi characteristic results in small - signal gain for a quasistatic ac probe field . obviously , in the quasistatic case the gain does not depend on the frequency . for typical superlattices at room temperature @xmath36 fs .",
    "therefore the quasistatic approximation is valid for microwave fields .    for a higher frequency ( @xmath37 )",
    ", it is still possible to have small - signal gain , but the magnitude of the gain becomes frequency - dependent .",
    "small - signal absorption is also often defined using the frequency - dependent complex conductivity @xmath38 : @xmath39 .",
    "it is easy to see that absorption is proportional to @xmath40 .",
    "complex high - frequency conductivity has been first calculated by ktitorov et al .",
    "@xcite @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the static conductivity of the superlattice .",
    "real and imaginary parts of the conductivity ( [ eq : kssres ] ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ksskuva ] .",
    "importantly , for @xmath43 gain exists up to frequencies around the bloch frequency , with even a resonance near @xmath44 .",
    "the physical mechanisms of this high - frequency gain has been studied both in the semiclassical picture with the help of electron bunches @xcite and in the quantum mechanical wannier - stark picture @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the small - signal absorption can be calculated by taking the so - called quantum derivative of the current - field characteristic @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ fig : et ] ) @xmath45 for @xmath46 the difference quotient in the quantum derivative becomes the usual derivative , and the result that small frequency absorption is proportional to @xmath47 is rediscovered .",
    "one immediate consequence of the quantum derivative is that in order to get high - frequency gain we must have static ndc ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : et ] ) .",
    "( color online ) esaki - tsu current - field characteristic .",
    "the figure also demonstrates the quantum derivative for the frequency @xmath48 taken at the operation point @xmath49 ( blue ) .",
    "absorption at frequency @xmath50 is proportional to the difference quotient , eq .",
    "( [ quant - der1 ] ) , which equals the slope of the inclined line ( green ) . ]",
    "( color online ) real ( red ) and imaginary ( blue ) parts of conductivity for ( a ) @xmath51 and ( b ) @xmath52 . note that for @xmath53 gain is possible almost up to @xmath54 . ]",
    "superlattices with static ndc , similarly as gunn diodes , are unstable against spatial space - charge fluctuations , which result in formation of high - field electric domains .",
    "the possibility of space - charge instability in the superlattice bloch oscillator was first pointed out by ktitorov et al .  themselves @xcite .",
    "later , it has been established within a simplified model by bttiker and thomas @xcite and in most consistent form by ignatov and shashkin @xcite .",
    "the electric domains are believed to be destructive for high - frequency gain in superlattices . nevertheless , in series of very interesting experiments french groups did observe gain at reflection of microwaves from long superlattices with @xmath55 @xmath56 in a wide range of frequencies up to several hundreds of ghz @xcite .",
    "it seems that physical reasons for these very interesting experimental observations are still not well understood in the semiconductor community .    on the other hand , for thz waves , santa - barbara group recently reported a decrease of absorption , but still not gain , in an array of short superlattices @xcite .",
    "experimental techniques for monitoring the domains in superlattices are under development @xcite .",
    "now we turn to consider the regime of large probe field , where high - frequency gain is not necessarily connected to the presence of static ndc .",
    "until now we have discussed electron transport in superlattices assuming the existence of a single relaxation time . however , experiments demonstrate that models employing two relaxation times are more realistic . by using the tight - binding approximation and the boltzmann equation with two scattering times ,",
    "the following balance equations can be derived @xcite @xmath57 .",

    "electrons are staying at the bottom of miniband for @xmath62 and the upper edge is reached if @xmath63 , where @xmath16 is the density of electrons in the first miniband .",
    "average electron energy in thermal equilibrium @xmath64 depends on the temperature , superlattice parameters and carrier density .",
    "the superlattice balance equations have been first introduced by ignatov and romanov @xcite .",
    "importantly , equations ( [ balance ] ) can describe both transient ( @xmath65 ) and stationary ( @xmath66 ) dynamics of miniband electrons under the action of strong electric fields ( the electric field is turned on at @xmath67 . ) .",
    "earlier these equations have been employed in the studies of decaying coherent bloch oscillations @xcite , absolute negative conductance @xcite and efficiency of thz bloch oscillator @xcite , as well as in the analysis of such strongly nonlinear phenomena like symmetry - breaking and chaos @xcite .",
    "the solution of equations ( [ balance ] ) for static field is a scaled esaki - tsu characteristic .",
    "its critical field is @xmath68 where @xmath69 .",
    "this new definition of critical field is used in the following and it reduces to the earlier definition , if @xmath70 .",
    "in addition to parameter @xmath71 , a parameter @xmath72 is needed to describe the system . if @xmath73",

    "moreover , it is easy to see that for small ac field @xmath4",
    "( i.e. for @xmath82 ) , @xmath83 becomes the quantum derivative defined by eq .",

    "they can also be used to check the numerical solution of the balance equations in the limiting case @xmath73 .",
    "note that since in the case of static electric field the solution of equations ( [ balance ] ) was the scaled esaki - tsu vi characteristic for all @xmath87 , different scattering rates do not give any qualitative changes to low frequency behavior .",
    "this is , however , not necessarily the case for higher frequencies . the quantum derivative result is valid only if @xmath73 , although it works as a good approximation , when @xmath88 : qualitative changes in the high frequency behavior can occur even for small signals , when @xmath87 is significantly smaller than @xmath2 .",
    "the changes in large amplitude oscillation dynamics are even more interesting , because the calculations for @xmath73 indicate possibility for gain and domain suppression @xcite .",

    "we are working with a high - frequency fields satisfying @xmath118 .",
    "the condition of lsa , additionally to the requirement for a positive slope of time - averaged vi characteristic ( pdc ) , includes also the inequality @xmath119 it indicates a small ( limited ) charge accumulation during every thz cycle .",
    "condition ( [ lsa2 ] ) can be easily satisfied for typical superlattices . only in heavy doped superlattices with very wide minibands ,",
    "@xmath120 can be comparable to @xmath15 @xcite , and therefore @xmath121 can approach unity .",
    "on the other hand , increasing the carrier density we are not only increasing the gain but also reducing the time scale for the growth of the field in the resonator ( [ tau_g ] ) .",
    "moreover if @xmath122 , then the resonator - mode can reach the minimum amplitude required for switching to local pdc before a domain would be developed .",
    "such a scenario can potentially solve the `` device turn - on problem '' @xcite for bloch oscillator .",
    "the ratio @xmath123 depends only on @xmath50 and @xmath44 , while material parameters are not crucial .",
    "however , according to our calculations @xmath124 and @xmath120 are close to each other for the most interesting case @xmath43 .",
    "this means that the growing space charge domains and the growing ac field can not be handled separately .",
    "in summary , we have shown that thz gain in the conditions of suppressed electric domains is possible in fairly large regions of parameter space , which could allow to build devices which can be used for generation and amplification of thz radiation .",
    "large - signal gain with suppressed domains is preserved with an introduction of two different relaxation times for the electron velocity @xmath125 and energy @xmath126 . in particular",
    ", we demonstrated that until @xmath127 , the difference from the results obtained using a single @xmath15 is negligible .",
    "note that according to the experiments @xcite @xmath127 is a good assumption , although it is not valid for all superlattices @xcite .",
    "quantitatively , the magnitudes of all current components and thus also the gain always decrease with decreasing ratio @xmath128 .    there remains , however , several important problems , which have not been considered in the present work .",
    "the first one is the possible influence of boundary conditions , which according to the computational results of rieder @xcite may turn out to be crucial from the point of view of extended lsa mode .",
    "hopefully , it is still possible to control these boundary conditions at least to some extent in which case the lsa mode can be made to work .",
    "second , we should mention that existence of lsa regime in superlattices at thz frequencies is not completely proven even theoretically .",
    "the existence of lsa operational mode is rather well established both theoretically and experimentally in gunn diodes at microwave frequencies .",
    "however , still no experiments devoted to the lsa mode in thz range are performed . from the theory side",
    "the consistent derivation of lsa conditions has been done only within quasistatic approximation and thus it is not valid at thz frequencies .",
    "therefore , for those who like complete proofs , the existence of extended lsa regime at thz frequencies still continues to be interesting theoretical problem to study .",
    "theoretical research in these and related directions is in progress in oulu . of course",
    ", experiments would also be very helpful in order to solve the remaining important problems .    finally ,",
    "in this work we have mainly focused on large - signal thz gain in superlattices with suppressed space - charge instability .",
    "a very important problem that still remains is how to get small - signal gain without domains .",
    "one possible solution is to make use of microwave pump to get gain at frequency multiplication in superlattices @xcite .",
