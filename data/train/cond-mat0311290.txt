    "the aim of this paper is to study , using molecular dynamics ( md ) computer simulations , the effect of having a mass difference in particles on properties of liquids .",
    "the influence of mass polydispersity on dynamical properties when simulating the dynamics of realistic system having size polydispersity was recently demonstrated by poole and one of the authors ( n.k . )",
    "computer simulation methods , md in particular , gives unique possibility to isolate and study the role of a single parameter for systems of any complexity that is much more difficult to accomplish ( or even impossible ) in an actual experiment .",
    "here we consider a model that allows us to isolate completely the effect of only changing the masses of the particles by keeping all other characteristics of system unchanged .",
    "our model is the simplest possible isotope system : a two - component mixture of isotopes , particles of the same size but different masses , consisting of 50% particles @xmath0 with mass @xmath1 and 50% particles @xmath2 with mass @xmath3 , so that no matter how we change @xmath4 , the average mass of particles , total mass and average mass and number densities of a system remain the same . in this sense",
    ", our model differs from these studied previously .",
    "for example , ebbsj _ et al .",
    "_ in @xcite and bearman and jolly in @xcite studied isotope systems in which one species had a fixed mass and the mass of another species varied . consequently , this affected the average mass and mass density .",
    "other authors @xcite considered the diffusion of solute particles in the limit of infinite dilution in a solvent .",
    "we perform the equilibrium md simulation of a 3-dimensional system of @xmath5 particles interacting via the shifted - force lennard - jones ( lj ) potential @xcite , a modification of the standard lj potential @xmath6 , \\ ] ] where @xmath7 characterizes the strength of the pair interaction and @xmath8 describes the particle diameter .",
    "both @xmath7 and @xmath9 are constant for all particle pairs . in the shifted - force lj interaction , the lj potential and force are modified so as to go to zero continuously at @xmath10 , and interactions beyond @xmath11 are ignored .",
    "we chose the lennard - jones potential because it is very popular in md studies and has proved to be a good approximation , for example , for liquid argon .",
    "in addition , there is a large amount of data , both theoretical and experimental , available for comparison @xcite .    in our work",
    "we use reduced units .",
    "energy is expressed in units of @xmath12 , mass @xmath13 in units of @xmath14 , length in units of @xmath9 , the number density of particles @xmath15 in units of @xmath16 , and temperature @xmath17 in units of @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is boltzmann s constant .",
    "time @xmath20 is expressed in units of @xmath21 . in these units",
    "the time step used for integrating the particle equations of motion is @xmath22 .",
    "the initial distribution of velocities was maxwellian .",
    "after equilibration , all quantities are evaluated in the microcanonical ensemble ( a constant nve ) .",
    "we present data for @xmath23 and @xmath24 that is not far from a triple point of one component fluid ( @xmath25 @xcite ) where the cooperative motion of liquid particles is more prominent .",
    "we conduct simulations for different @xmath26 from @xmath27 to @xmath28 with the step @xmath29 .",
    "the pair distribution function @xmath30 that characterizes the average liquid structure @xcite is shown in fig .",
    "[ g(r ) ] .",
    "we calculate @xmath31 for systems with different values of @xmath4 and for each species @xmath32 and @xmath2 of these systems .",
    "we find that the pair distribution function @xmath33 is the same in all cases , confirming that the static properties of the system do not depend on @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "[ msqdis ] presents the dependence of @xmath34 ( the mean square displacement of a particle ) on @xmath20 for different @xmath4 .",
    "as @xmath4 becomes larger , @xmath35 has a steeper slope .",
    "in addition , in fig . [ msqdis3 ] we plot three graphs that show the mean square displacements of particles @xmath0 , @xmath2 , and the total @xmath36 for @xmath37 , as an example .",
    "the curves for particles with mass @xmath38 lie above and for particles with mass @xmath3 lie below the curve for the total mean square displacement .",
    "this demonstrates the fact that lighter particles not only move faster between collisions , but also diffuse faster than heavier particles .",
    "it is interesting that for small @xmath20 the graph of the mean square displacement of a lighter particle has a steep slope which decreases and becomes constant for @xmath39 , whereas the graph of the mean square displacement of a heavier particle increases for @xmath40 .",
    "we calculate the diffusion coefficient @xmath41 in two ways : using the einstein relation @xcite @xmath42 and using the kubo formula @xcite    @xmath43    where @xmath44 is the velocity autocorrelation function . here and below subscripts @xmath45 and @xmath46 mean that @xmath41 calculated using the einstein formula and using the kubo formula .",
    "the results are presented in the table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "@xmath47 is the diffusion coefficient in scaled units for species with mass @xmath48 , and @xmath49 is the average diffusion coefficient of the mixture . at fixed @xmath15 and @xmath17 the diffusion coefficients",

    "( [ 2 ] ) are more accurate .",
    "the same conclusion was made in ref .",
    "this is because eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) involves integration where negative and positive parts of @xmath54 partially cancel out and because of uncertainties in the long - time behavior of the velocity autocorrelation function , whereas the graphs of @xmath36 versus @xmath20 are almost perfect straight lines for @xmath39 .",
    "from the table [ tab1 ] we can see that the relationship @xmath55 always holds and the difference among @xmath50 , @xmath41 , and @xmath51 increases with an increase of @xmath4 .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "the dependence of the diffusion coefficient versus @xmath4 is not linear .    even though the diffusion coefficient does not change too much with a change of mass ( if @xmath4 changes by @xmath56 , @xmath41 changes maximum by @xmath57 ) , the velocity autocorrelation function varies significantly , both in shape and magnitude as a function of @xmath20 .",
    "[ vacf ] shows the dependence on @xmath58 of the normalized velocity autocorrelation function @xmath59 @xcite    @xmath60    it is interesting to observe the behavior of the negative part of @xmath59 .",
    "the velocity autocorrelation function , basically , is the projection of a particle s velocity at time @xmath20 on the initial velocity of that particle , averaged over all particles .",
    "if @xmath59 becomes negative it means that a particle after a number of collisions , on average , reverses the direction of its motion .",
    "as we can see from the graph , all of the functions @xmath59 have a negative part but the minimum of @xmath59 behaves differently . for @xmath61 and @xmath62 ,",
    "the functions @xmath59 are very close to @xmath59 with @xmath63 . as @xmath4 increases , the minimum shifts to earlier times .",
    "its magnitude initially decreases , has a maximum at @xmath64 , and starts to increase drastically for @xmath65 . to reveal this difference we plot three curves on fig .",
    "[ vacf3 ] which shows the velocity autocorrelation functions of particles @xmath0 , @xmath2 , and the total value for @xmath37 .",
    "the curve for particles with mass @xmath1 has a deeper minimum than the total and the curve for particles with mass @xmath3 does not have a negative part at all . for a big difference in the masses @xmath66 and @xmath67 , the heavier particles do not reverse their direction of motion on average , even in a dense fluid .",
    "the general non - gaussian parameter @xmath68 is defined as @xcite    @xmath69    where @xmath70/3^n$ ] and @xmath71 are the ensemble average of the @xmath72 power of the particle displacements after a time @xmath20 @xcite :    @xmath73    for systems in which motions of particles are uncorrelated ( for example , in an ideal gas ) @xmath74 .",
    "the deviation of @xmath68 from zero serves to quantify the correlation of particle motions at intermediate time or , as it was shown in @xcite , the heterogeneity in masses for short times .    here , as in @xcite , we calculate @xmath75 :    @xmath76    in fig .",
    "[ alpha2 ] we plot @xmath75 for different values of @xmath77 . for small @xmath4",
    "the behavior of @xmath75 is similar to that of a polydisperse system @xcite . for @xmath78 , @xmath79 does not start from @xmath27 .",
    "we observe the characteristic , intermediate - time peak of @xmath79 , at approximately @xmath80 , which increases in magnitude as @xmath77 increases . as in @xcite , the combination of the non - zero , early - time behavior of @xmath79 , and the intermediate - time peak produces a minimum in @xmath79 at approximately @xmath81 .",
    "however , for larger @xmath4 , starting from @xmath64 , the minimum disappears , and @xmath75 becomes a monotonically decreasing function .",
    "for these @xmath4 the values of @xmath75 at @xmath82 even exceed the intermediate - time peak .",
    "it is interesting to observe how the total non - gaussian parameter is related to ones of particles @xmath0 and @xmath2 .",
    "[ alpha23 ] shows three curves representing @xmath75 for particles @xmath0 , @xmath2 , and the total when @xmath37 . both curves ( @xmath0 and @xmath2 ) start from @xmath27 ( each component has particles of the same size ) .",
    "the curve for particles with mass @xmath38 has a maximum that is twice as high and is located at an earlier time than the curve for particles with mass @xmath3 .",
    "the difference between these two curve increases when @xmath4 becomes larger .",
    "in addition , the curve for the lighter particle , after passing the maximum , completely coincides with the total @xmath75 and decays as @xmath83 , according to @xcite .",
    "the lighter particles are more mobile and give a larger contribution to the motion of the fluid .",
    "as we pointed out in @xcite , the non - gaussian behavior of @xmath75 shows that the self - part of the van hove correlation function @xmath84    @xmath85    deviates from the gaussian form . in the limit @xmath86",
    ", when particles move with a velocity @xmath87 as if they were free , this corresponds to the condition that the distribution of velocities of particles is non - maxwellian .",
    "the maxwell - boltzmann distribution for particle velocities is @xcite    @xmath88    we can see that it depends on the mass of a particle .",
    "even if for each species the distribution is maxwellian the total distribution is not    @xmath89    in fig .",
    "[ maxvel ] we plot the distribution of velocities of all particles ( solid line ) and the gaussian fit of this curve ( dashed line ) .",
    "it is clear that this distribution deviates from the gaussian form .",
    "it is narrower and has longer tails for large velocities .",
    "this is the contribution of particles with smaller mass .",
    "it is interesting that the same non - gaussian behavior of @xmath90 was observed experimentally in @xcite for colloid suspensions .",
    "it could be accounted for the polydispersity in the mass of colloids used in that experiment ( which was @xmath91 ) .",
    "finally , we can use the formula for the non - gaussian parameter @xmath79 at @xmath82 for the multicomponent system from @xcite :    @xmath92    where @xmath93 is the fraction of particles of species @xmath94 .",
    "( here , as in @xcite , the superscript `` @xmath95 '' indicates the limit @xmath96 . )",

    "[ alpha2x ] , confirming this analysis .",
    "an additional parameter which could reveal the diffusion mechanism in isotope mixtures is the isotope effect parameter .",
    "it was shown by parrinello _",
    "et al . _ in @xcite that for dilute gases the ratio of the self - diffusion coefficients of a binary mixture is equal to the reciprocal of the square root of masses of the two species .",
    "however , computer simulations performed by bearman and jolly @xcite ) show that the ratio of the self - diffusion coefficients varies with masses as    @xmath102    where @xmath103 differs from @xmath104 for higher densities and lower temperatures , when effects of collective motion is important . in fig .",
    "[ isoteff ] we plot @xmath105 versus @xmath106 .",
    "the slope of the best fit line gives @xmath107 .",
    "this corresponds to well - known results ( for example , therein ref .",
    "@xcite ) . there is another parameter that serves as a quantitative measure of collectivity , the isotope effect , defined as @xcite    @xmath108    large isotope effects are interpreted as single - atom jumps via vacancies @xcite , whereas small isotope effects indicate the presence of some collective processes .",
    "kluge and schober in @xcite estimated the number of particles moving cooperatively as    @xmath109    we find that for our binary mixtures the isotope effect @xmath45 varies from @xmath110 for @xmath61 to @xmath111 for @xmath37 .",
    "it indicates an increase in the cooperative motion of particles with an increase in their mass differences .",
    "we have considered md computer simulations of a toy model , a binary isotope mixture , that allows us to elucidate the effect of having a mass difference on properties of liquids .",
    "it has been shown that redistribution of mass ( @xmath4 ) among the two species , while keeping the rest of parameters fixed , does not affect static properties ( the pair distribution function @xmath30 ) both for the system and separately for each species @xmath0 and @xmath2 and these are independent of @xmath4 ) . at the same time , all dynamic properties ( the diffusion coefficient , velocity autocorrelation function , non - gaussian and isotope effect parameters ) are affected and exhibit @xmath4 dependence , which demonstrates the pure dynamical nature of mass heterogeneity .",
    "moreover , the @xmath4 dependence exhibits some `` critical '' values such as in the behavior of the negative part of the normalized velocity autocorrelation function @xmath59 ( see fig .",
    "[ vacf ] ) which at @xmath64 changes the initial tendency of decreasing magnitude of first minimum with increase of @xmath4 to the opposite , i.e. a drastic increase in @xmath59 . such phenomenon , we believe , deserves further investigation and analysis .",
    "many real systems have mass heterogeneities but , of course , not pure as in our model .",
    "nevertheless , even the hidden and probably not very strong effect of having a mass difference compared to other ( size , interaction , etc . ) has to create a pure dynamical contribution .",
    "as demonstrated by our simple model , this pure mass effect does not affect the static properties of a system .",
    "in particular , this observation leads us to question the validity of some universal empirical formulae based on the conjecture that `` atomic diffusion is an entirely geometrical phenomenon '' @xcite .",
    "the author of @xcite claimed that the relationship between @xmath41 and @xmath30 is governed by following equations    @xmath112    where @xmath113 is the diffusion coefficient in the dimensionless form @xmath114 , @xmath115 is given by    @xmath116    where @xmath9 is a position of first maximum of @xmath30 and @xmath117 is the two - particle approximation of the reduced excess entropy    @xmath118 -\\left [ g(r)-1\\right ] \\right\\ } r^2dr.\\ ] ]    according @xcite , eqs .",
