    "cell networks have attracted a lot of attention recently as they are considered a promising method to satisfy the ever increasing rate demands of wireless users .",
    "some studies have suggested that , by employing low cost access points ( aps ) , the density @xmath0 of aps will potentially reach , or even exceed , the density @xmath1 of user equipments ( ues ) , therefore introducing the notion of ultra dense wireless networks @xcite . with a large number of aps available",
    ", a random ue will most probably connect to a strong signal ap , having to share the ap resources with a limited number of co - served ues , and , ultimately , achieve high rates .",
    "however , in order to exploit the full system resources , a universal frequency reuse scheme is employed which inevitably results in significant interference that has to be taken carefully into account in system design and performance analysis .      with an increasing network density ,",
    "the task of optimally placing the aps in the euclidean plane becomes difficult , if not impossible .",
    "therefore , the aps will typically have an irregular , random deployment , which is expected to affect system performance .",
    "recent research has showed that such randomly deployed cellular systems can be successfully analyzed by employing tools from stochastic geometry @xcite .",
    "while significant results have been achieved , most of these works assume @xmath2 , effectively ignoring ue distribution , and/or consider only the user signal - to - interference ratio ( sir ) .",
    "assumption @xmath2 does not hold in the case of dense networks , whereas sir provides only partial insight on the achieved user rate as the effect of multiple access is neglected @xcite .",
    "a few recent works have attempted to address these issues .",
    "specifically , the ue distribution is taken into account in @xcite by incorporating in the analysis the probability of an ap being inactive ( no ue present within its cell ) .",
    "however , analysis considers only the sir . in @xcite",
    "the ue distribution is employed for computation of user rates under time - division - multiple - access ( tdma ) without considering the effect of sir outage .",
    "in addition , tdma may not be the best multiple access scheme under certain scenarios .",
    "partitioning the available bandwidth and transmitting on one of the resulting subchannels ( scs ) , i.e. , frequency - division - multiple - access ( fdma ) , has been shown in @xcite to be beneficial for the case of ad - hoc networks assuming a channel access scheme where each node transmits independently on a randomly selected sc .",
    "this decentralized scheme was employed in @xcite for modeling the uplink of a cellular network with frequency hopping channel access .",
    "however , this approach is inappropriate for a practical cellular network where scheduling decisions are made by the ap and transmissions are orthogonalized to eliminate intra - cell interference ( no sophisticated processing at receivers is assumed that would allow for non - orthogonal transmissions ) .",
    "a straightforward modification of the bandwidth partitioning concept for the downlink cellular network was considered in @xcite where ues are multiplexed via tdma and transmission is performed on one , randomly selected sc .",
    "this simple scheme was shown to provide improved sir performance , however , with no explicit indication of how many partitions should be employed or how performance would change by allowing more that one ues transmitting at the same time slot on different scs .      in this paper ,",
    "the stochastic geometry framework is employed for analyzing the downlink user rate of a dense wireless network under a multiple access scheme that exploits bandwidth partitioning for _ both _ interference reduction and efficient resource sharing among ues .",
    "the previously mentioned issues are explicitly addressed by considering in the analysis    *   the ue distribution , *   a multiple access scheme that allows for parallel orthogonal transmissions in frequency , *   the effect of sir outage .    under this framework ,",
    "the user rate distribution is analytically derived for two instances of multiple access schemes that reveals dependence of performance on the number of bandwidth partitions as well as the way the are utilized .",
    "the analytical rate distribution expression , apart from allowing for efficient numerical optimization of system parameters , is employed to derive a closed - form lower bound of the optimal number of partitions for the case of large ap density , as well as a closed - form upper bound of the minimum ap density required to provide a given , asymptotically small , rate outage probability .",
    "the latter is of critical importance given the trend of ap densification in future wireless networks .",
    "numerical results demonstrate the merits of increased ap density , as well as efficient use of bandwidth partitions , in enhancing network performance in terms of achieved user rate .    the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii describes the system model , along with a discussion on the suitability of various metrics with respect to ( w.r.t . )",
    "ue performance . in section iii ,",
    "the user rate distribution is analytically obtained for two instances of multiple access schemes .",
    "the number of scs that minimizes rate outage probability is investigated in section iv , and section v provides a closed form upper bound of the minimum required ap density that can support a given , asymptotically small , user rate outage probability .",
    "section vi presents numerical examples that provide insights on various system design aspects , and section vii concludes the paper .",
    "the downlink of an interference - limited , dense wireless network is considered .",
    "randomly deployed over @xmath3 aps and ues are modeled as independent homogeneous poisson point processes ( ppp ) @xmath4 , @xmath5 , with densities @xmath0 , @xmath1 , respectively . full buffer transmissions and gaussian signaling are assumed , with interference treated as noise at the receivers .",
    "each ue is served by its closest ap resulting in irregular , disjoint cell shapes forming a voronoi tessellation of the plane @xcite .",
    "elimination of intra - cell interference is achieved by an orthogonal fdma / tdma scheme with the total system bandwidth partitioned offline to @xmath6 equal size scs .",
    "all active aps in the system transmit at the same power over all ( active ) scs , with the power selected appropriately large so that the system operates in the interference limited region in order to maximize spectral efficiency @xcite .",
    "no coordination among aps is assumed , i.e. , each ap makes independent scheduling decisions .    considering a typical ue located at the origin and served by its closest ap of index , say , @xmath7 ,",
    "the sir achieved at sc @xmath8 is given by @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the distance from the serving ap , @xmath11 the path loss exponent , and @xmath12 an exponentially distributed random variable with unit mean , modeling small scale ( rayleigh ) fading .",
    "the denominator in ( [ eq:1 ] ) represents the interference power at the considered sc , where @xmath13 , @xmath14 are the channel fading and distance of ap @xmath15 w.r.t .",
    "the typical ue , respectively , and @xmath16 is an indicator variable representing whether ap @xmath15 transmits on sc @xmath17 .",
    "note that @xmath18 depends on the total number of ues associated with ap @xmath15 as well as the multiple access scheme and its presence in ( [ eq:1 ] ) is to account for aps that do not interfere due to lack of associated ues and/or scheduling decisions .",
    "channel fadings @xmath19 are assumed independent , identically distributed ( i.i.d . )",
    "ap index @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath20 is a random variable due to the randomness of fading , ap and ue locations , as well as the multiple access scheme , and its statistical characterization is of interest . to this end , the interference term of ( [ eq:1 ] )",
    "can be viewed as shot - noise generated by a marked ppp @xcite of density @xmath0 outside a ball of radius @xmath21 centered at the origin , and marks @xmath22 .",
    "statistical characterization of a marked ppp can be obtained by standard methods when the following conditions hold @xcite :    1 .",
    "marks are mutually independent given the location of points , and , 2 .",
    "each mark depends only on the location of its corresponding point .",
    "channel fadings @xmath19 satisfy both conditions by assumption , whereas variables @xmath23 satisfy only the first due to their dependence on the total number of ues associated with each ap . by fundamental properties of the ppp , the numbers of ues associated with different aps are mutually independent since ap cells are disjoint . for each ap ,",
    "the number of associated ues is determined by @xmath1 and its cell area , with the latter depending not only on its own position but also on the position of its neighbours aps as well , rendering condition ( 2 ) invalid for @xmath23 . in order to obtain tractable expressions for the sir distribution",
    "the following assumption is adopted :    the number @xmath24 of ues associated with a random ap is independent of @xmath4 .",
    "note that this assumption is actually stronger than the second condition but is convenient as it allows for incorporating the averaged - over-@xmath4 probability mass function ( pmf ) of @xmath24 that will be used later in the analysis , given by the following lemma :    the pmf of the number @xmath24 of ues associated with a randomly chosen ap , averaged over the statistics of @xmath4 , is @xcite @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the gamma function and @xmath27 .",
    "note that @xmath28 is a decreasing function of @xmath29 and the mean of @xmath24 equals @xmath30 .",
    "the above approach was shown in @xcite to provide accurate results and will be validated by simulations in sect .",
    "iii .    under assumption 1 , @xmath23 are i.i.d . over @xmath15 and characterized by the _ activity probability _ @xmath31 , \\forall i$ ] , whose actual value will be investigated in sect .",
    "iii for specific multiple access schemes .",
    "the cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) of @xmath20 can now be obtained in a simple expression as given by the following lemma :    the cdf of @xmath20 under an activity probability @xmath32 is given by @xcite @xmath33 for @xmath34 , where @xmath35 .",
    "note that setting @xmath32 _ a - priori _ equal to 1 , as in , e.g. , @xcite , implies that there is always a ue available to be allocated in every ap of the system , i.e. , @xmath36 , which is not the case in dense networks .",
    "for example , for the case @xmath37 and noting that @xmath38 for any multiple access scheme , it follows from ( [ eq : kpmf ] ) that @xmath39 .",
    "knowledge of ( [ eq : fsir ] ) is of importance as it provides the probability @xmath40 of service outage due to inability of ue operation below sir threshold @xmath41 whose value may be dictated by operational requirements , e.g. , synchronization , and/or application ( qos ) requirements . in addition , @xmath42 can be used to obtain cdfs of other directly related quantities of interest by transformation of variables .",
    "one such quantity employed extensively in the related literature , e.g. , @xcite , is the rate @xmath43 achieved _ per channel use _ , i.e , on a single time slot , given by @xmath44 examining @xmath43 is important from the viewpoint of system throughput @xcite but provides little insight on the achieved user rate .",
    "note that @xmath43 is an upper bound on the actual user rate . in case",
    "when the considered sc has to be time - shared among ues , rate will only be a fraction of @xmath45 . in an attempt to remedy this issue ,",
    "@xmath45 was divided by the ( random ) number of ues sharing the sc in @xcite ( case of @xmath46 was only considered ) .",
    "however , this is still a misleading measure of performance as it does not take into account the probability of an sir outage and , therefore , provides overconfident results .    in order to avoid these issues , the achieved rate of a typical ue is defined in this paper as @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the indicator function and integer @xmath49 is the number of time slots between two successive transmissions to the typical ue , referred to as _ delay _ in the following .",
    "clearly , ( [ eq:4 ] ) takes into account both the effects of multiple access and sir outage via @xmath50 and the indicator function , respectively . in order to obtain the rate outage probability , i.e. , the cdf of @xmath51 , ( statistical ) evaluation of @xmath52 and @xmath53 is required , both depending , in addition to the ue distribution , on the multiple access scheme that is investigated in the following section .",
    "in this section the effect of multiple access on the achievable user rate is investigated .",
    "the multiple access scheme must strive to maximize ue resource utilization , while at the same time minimize inter - cell interference .",
    "these are conflicting requirements which , as it will be shown , can be ( optimally ) balanced by the choice of @xmath6 . for analytical purposes",
    "the two schemes considered below are non - channel aware , with the corresponding performance serving as a lower bound under a channel aware resource assignment scheme , and fair , i.e. , there are no priorities among ues .",
    "the following scheme , referred to in the following as tdma , will serve as a baseline .",
    "- ues are multiplexed via tdma .",
    "- transmission to any ue is performed on one , randomly selected sc out of total @xmath6 .",
    "this scheme is a straightforward application of the random sc selection scheme employed in adhoc studies @xcite to the downlink cellular setting , and can be also viewed as a generalization of conventional tdma ( @xmath46 ) that is usually assumed in works on cellular networks .",
    "it was first examined in @xcite , where it was shown that it provides improved sir coverage by using essentially the same principle as in a frequency hopping scheme .",
    "the major argument against tdma is the inability of parallel transmissions in frequency by multiple ues when @xmath54 , which is expected to be beneficial under certain operational scenarios . in this paper , the following simple modification is employed , referred to as fdma / tdma in the following , that allows for multiple ues served at a single time slot ( @xmath55 denotes the largest smallest integer operator ) .",
    "- define @xmath56 the set of available scs for allocation at any given instant . -",
    "randomly order the @xmath24 cell users via an index @xmath57 .",
    "@xmath58 ; assign ue @xmath59 a random sc @xmath60 ; @xmath61 ; - ues sharing the same sc are multiplexed via tdma .",
    "note that the above scheme also subsumes conventional tdma as a special case .",
    "two typical realizations of the scheme for @xmath62 are shown in fig .",
    "as can be seen , there will be cases with unused scs ( @xmath63 ) or scs that support one additional ue compared to others ( @xmath64 ) with no action taken to compensate for these effects .",
    "the inefficient bandwidth utilization is not a real issue since presence of unused scs is beneficial in terms of reduced interference and also @xmath6 is variable that can be set to a small enough value so that this event is avoided , if desired .",
    "the load imbalance among scs is irrelevant for rate computations due to averaging .",
    "having specified the multiple access schemes , the corresponding quantities @xmath32 and @xmath50 will be evaluated in the following subsections . by the symmetry of the system model and the schemes considered , all the performance metrics presented in sect .",
    "ii do not depend on @xmath17 .",
    "therefore , the typical ue will be considered assigned to sc 1 and index @xmath17 will be dropped from notation in the following .",
    "the following lemma holds for the activity probability @xmath65 of tdma and fdma / tdma .    under assumption 1 ,",
    "the activity probability of any ap in the system , other than @xmath7 , is @xmath66[c]{l 's } \\frac{1}{n}\\pr\\{k>0\\ } , & for tdma,\\\\ \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{k>0}\\pr\\{k\\}\\min\\{k , n\\ } , & for fdma / tdma , \\end{ieeeeqnarraybox}\\right.\\ ] ] with @xmath28 as given in lemma 1 .",
    "see appendix a.    as expected , @xmath65 is a decreasing function of @xmath6 in both cases , and it can be easily shown that , for the same @xmath54 , @xmath65 of fdma / tdma is lower bounded by the corresponding @xmath65 of tdma with equality when @xmath67 , i.e. , with a dense ap deployment .",
    "note that in @xcite , @xmath65 for tdma was set equal to @xmath68 , implying that @xmath69 , which is ( approximately ) valid only for @xmath70 . substituting ( [ eq : activ_prob ] ) in ( [ eq : fsir ] ) shows that @xmath71 is decreasing in @xmath6 , i.e. , bandwidth partitioning improves performance in terms of sir .",
    "figure 2 shows the behavior of @xmath65 as a function of @xmath6 for fdma / tdma and tdma and various values of @xmath29 .",
    "conventional tdma performance corresponds to @xmath46 . it can be seen that both schemes outperform conventional tdma , with larger values of @xmath6 required to obtain the same @xmath65 under heavier system load .",
    "tdma is always better than fdma / tdma , especially under heavy system load . for @xmath72 ,",
    "both schemes essentially operate exactly the same and this is reflected on the values of @xmath65 . for @xmath73 , fdma / tdma is worse than tdma but relatively close , with similar dependence on @xmath6 ( inversely proportional ) .    _",
    "remark _ : according to the previous discussion , the sir grows unbounded with increasing @xmath29 and/or @xmath6 , which is unrealistic",
    ". however , arbitrarily large values of @xmath29 are not of interest due to practical considerations , whereas arbitrarily large values of @xmath6 are not acceptable from a user rate perspective as will be shown in sect .",

    "figure 3 shows the mean value of @xmath77 as a function of @xmath6 for fdma / tdma and tdma and various values of @xmath29 .",
    "both schemes provide reduced delay by increasing @xmath29 , since the number of ues associated with the ap is reduced . for the case of fdma / tdma ,",
    "average @xmath77 decreases also with @xmath6 as there are more scs available to ues and the probability of time sharing one of them by many ues is reduced . on the other hand , for tdma , @xmath77 is independent of @xmath6 since the availability of scs is not exploited for parallel transmissions .",
    "obviously , fdma / tdma is advantageous when delay is considered , whereas , tdma is more robust to interference .",
    "however , it is the achieved ue rate that is of more interest and , at this point , there is no clear indication which of the two schemes is preferable under this performance metric , i.e. , what is of more importance , robustness to interference or efficient multiple access .",
    "having specified the statistics of @xmath65 and @xmath77 , the cdf of @xmath86 can now be obtained for both multiple access schemes as follows .",

    "see appendix b.    note that the upper term of ( [ eq : f_r_l ] ) indicates that for small values of @xmath93 , rate outage probability coincides with the sir outage probability , irrespective of the actual value of @xmath93 , as for this rate region it is the sir outage event ( strong interference ) that prevents ues from achieving these rates . for larger rates",
    ", @xmath77 appears in the lower term of ( [ eq : f_r_l ] ) , i.e. , multiple access also affects performance in addition to interference .",
    "figure 4 shows @xmath94 for @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 , and various values of @xmath29 , for fdma / tdma and tdma .",
    "for the case of @xmath73 each analytical cdf is accompanied by the corresponding empirical cdf ( dotted lines ) obtained by simulations ( simulation results for other @xmath29 values are omitted for clarity ) . the good match between analysis and simulation",
    "validates the use of the derived formulas for system analysis and design .    as it can be seen , increasing ap density , i.e. , increasing @xmath29 , results in improved performance as the distance between ue and serving ap , as well as the number of ues sharing the resources of a single ap , are reduced , which overbalance the effect of reduced distance from interfering aps .",
    "concerning the dependence of rate on @xmath6 , it can be seen that setting @xmath46 ( conventional tdma ) is optimal when large data rates are considered , irrespective of @xmath29 .",
    "however , the shape of the cdf for @xmath46 indicates a highly unfair system .",
    "increasing @xmath6 results in a progressively more fair system , favoring the small - rate operational region .",
    "in particular , for @xmath73 , and assuming a rate outage when the typical ue rate is below @xmath98 b / s / hz ( corresponding to 2 mbps in a 20 mhz system bandwidth ) , the outage probability is about 0.49 , 0.25 , and 0.15 , for @xmath99 and 1@xmath7 , respectively with fdma / tdma .",
    "comparing fdma / tdma and tdma for the same @xmath54 , it can be seen that tdma is a better choice at low data rates . as stated above , at this value range",
    "it is the sir outage probability that defines performance and tdma is preferable as it is more robust to sir outage events .",
    "when higher data rates are considered , tdma is penalized by the inability of concurrent ue transmissions and fdma / tdma becomes a better choice . in fig .",
    "4 , this difference in performance is more clearly seen for @xmath72 , which results in average @xmath24 and @xmath74 equal to 10 and 12.8 , respectively . for this load and the values of @xmath6 considered",
    ", fdma / tdma utilizes all scs with high probability , resulting in significantly larger interference compared to that achieved by tdma which only allows for transmission on a single sc .",
    "however , for the same reason , performance of fdma / tdma is significantly better for higher rates as it provides much smaller delay than tdma .",
    "results for @xmath100 show that the performance advantage of fdma / tdma in higher rates and of tdma in lower rates still holds but is less pronounced .",
    "by simple examination of fig .",
    "4 , it is understood that for a given minimum rate @xmath101 , there is an @xmath21-dependent , optimal number @xmath102 of scs that minimizes rate outage probability which can be obtained by numerical search using the analytical expression of proposition 1 .",
    "unfortunately , the highly non - linear dependence of @xmath103 on @xmath6 does not allow for a closed form expression of @xmath102 that holds in the general case .",
    "however , the following proposition , valid under certain operational scenarios to be identified right after , provides some guidelines .",

    "these observations are summarized in the following corollary .",

    "performance of tdma follows the same trend with fdma / tdma but results in about 1.5 times larger values of @xmath127 for small @xmath21 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the very good correspondence of the numerical and analytical results for fdma / tdma implies that the optimal system parameters ( @xmath29 and @xmath6 ) for fdma / tdma are such that @xmath163 , i.e. , there is small probability of sharing a sc .",
    "in contrast , tdma achieves performance close to fdma / tdma with @xmath164 for small @xmath21 ( @xmath127 ) .",
    "conventional tdma is clearly out of consideration for the small rate region as it significantly suffers from interference and the only mechanism to reduce it is by employing a large ap density . for rate values",

    "was incorporated and the user rate distribution was derived analytically , taking into account the ue distribution , multiple access scheme and sir outage . it was shown that performance depends critically on the number of bandwidth partitions and the way they are utilized by the multiple access scheme .",
    "the optimal number of partitions was tightly lower bounded under large ap density , showing that smaller bandwidth utilization is beneficial for interference reduction when small rates are considered .",
    "in addition , an upper bound on the minimum ap density required to provide an asymptotically small rate outage probability was obtained , that was shown to provide a very good estimate of the minimum density under moderate probability constraints .",
    "when the considered rates are small enough to allow for bandwidth partitioning , the minimum required density is smaller by orders of magnitude compared to the one provided by conventional tdma .",
