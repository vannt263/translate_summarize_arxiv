    "it is a remarkable feature of the theory of critical phenomena to condense a large range of systems that undergoes a continuous phase transition in terms of universality classes @xcite .",
    "fundamental properties such as symmetries or dimensionality just can influence the critical exponent , regardless of the microscopic details of interactions . however , under some conditions , it is possible to observe a crossover phenomenon for a given system or model , namely , a change in its universality class . examples of crossover phenomena are known either in equilibrium , such as in ferromagnetic systems @xcite , as well as in nonequilibrium statistical physics @xcite , where the zero law of thermodynamics is not satisfied . in the present work we analyse a crossover from mean - field to ising universality classes in a nonequilibrium model , namely , the majority - voter model . however , as will be describe , these regimes are separated by a singular region where the critical exponents change continuously .    the majority - vote model ( mvm ) with noise @xcite is a nonequilibrium model system , which presents up - down symmetry and a continuous order - disorder phase transition .",

    ", these studies have focused on the area of phase transitions and critical phenomena to improve our understanding on the robustness and formation of social consensus @xcite .    in the present study , we perform monte carlo simulations and employ the finite - size scaling theory to obtain the phase diagram and critical behavior of the the mvm on spatially embedded networks @xcite ,",
    "namely , networks constituted of @xmath8-dimensional lattices as substrates over which long - range connections are randomly added to connect any two sites according to a probability that depends on the distance between these sites .",

    "ii we describe the main features of the social networking model proposed by kleinberg and the majority - vote dynamics used here to determine the time evolution of the ising variables associated to each node of this network . in section iii the results of our simulations are presented and the finite - size scaling analysis is used to investigate the critical properties of the model .",
    "we conclude in section iv .",
    "in order to study the effects of nonlocal interactions on the global ordering , we associate one ising spin variable to each one of the @xmath9 sites of a regular lattice and perform monte carlo simulations considering each spin evolving in time according to the majority - vote dynamics @xcite . here we adopt the kleinberg s network @xcite as a model for introduction long - range couplings between sites in the system . starting from a regular @xmath8-dimensional lattice each site",

    "previous studies have shown that the mvm model on regular lattices undergoes a typical order - disorder phase transition at the stationary state @xcite .",
    "its dynamics is governed by the probabilities @xmath12 to attribute to a randomly chosen spin the same state of the majority of its neighbors , and @xmath13 the opposite state .",

    "the former property implies that we are dealing with a nonequilibrium system in which neither energy nor temperature are defined , whereas the existence of up - down symmetry would ensure the ising universality class for the mvm on regular lattices .",
