    "with the advent of new and upgraded experimental facilities in the next year(s ) , flavour physics involving @xmath14 decays will come under minute experimental and theoretical scrutiny .",
    "the overriding interest in these experiments is in measuring cp - violating asymmetries in partial @xmath14-decay rates , which will allow to quantitatively test the kobayashi - maskawa @xcite paradigm of cp violation .",
    "in addition , the large number of @xmath14 hadrons anticipated to be produced at these facilities ( estimated to be @xmath15 - @xmath16 ) will allow to measure a number of flavour - changing - neutral - current ( fcnc ) processes involving the transitions @xmath17 and @xmath18 , with @xmath19 , and @xmath20 - @xmath21 mixings .",
    "in the context of the standard model ( sm ) , fcnc decays and mixings measure the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) @xcite matrix elements , in particular @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "these quantities can , in principle , also be measured directly in top quark decays @xmath25 , with @xmath26 .",
    "a comparison of these matrix elements in the fcnc processes and direct measurements in @xmath27 decays would provide one of the best strategies to search for new physics in @xmath14 decays .",
    "so far , only @xmath24 has been directly measured at fermilab , yielding @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "present knowledge of @xmath22 owes itself to the measurements of @xmath29 , the mass difference in the @xmath20 - @xmath21 complex . with the current world",
    "average @xmath30 ( ps)@xmath31 , the error on @xmath22 is dominated by theoretical uncertainty on the hadronic matrix element @xmath32 , for which present lattice - qcd estimates are @xmath33 mev @xcite , yielding @xmath34 .",
    "we also mention that a single event for the charged kaon decay mode @xmath35 reported by the brookhaven e787 experiment , yielding @xmath36 , allows one to infer @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "the branching ratio for the decay @xmath38 has led to a determination of the matrix element @xmath23 @xcite , yielding @xmath39 , with the error dominated by the experimental error on the branching ratio @xmath40 @xcite .",

    "the decays @xmath51 are practically free of long - distance complications @xcite and the renormalization - scale dependence of the decay rates has also been brought under control @xcite . hence , these decays are theoretically remarkably clean but , unfortunately , they are difficult to measure in @xmath52 decays and out of question in hadronic collisions . using the missing energy technique and lep i data , the aleph collaboration has searched for the decays @xmath49 setting an upper bound @xmath53 ( at 90% c.l . )",

    "our theoretical treatment differs from that of ref .",
    "@xcite in a number of ways , summarized below .    * the dilepton invariant mass distributions in @xmath61 can be calculated in the context of the heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) as a power expansion in regions far from the resonances , thresholds and end - points @xcite .",
    "away from the @xmath62-resonances , the @xmath63-expansion provides , in principle , a viable description of the non - perturbative contributions arising from the @xmath58-loop @xcite .",
    "the contribution of the light quark @xmath64-loops , which is not ckm - suppressed in the decay @xmath45 , can likewise be calculated by doing an expansion of the decay amplitudes in @xmath65 in regions of the dilepton squared mass satisfying @xmath66 .",
    "thus , the hqet framework provides an evaluation of the invariant dilepton mass spectrum in these processes with the present precision limited to the leading power corrections in @xmath57 , @xmath63 and @xmath65 .",

    "away from the resonances and the end - points , the power corrections in @xmath57 calculated in hqet and in explicit wave function models , such as the fermi motion ( fm ) model @xcite , yield very similar invariant dilepton mass @xcite and hadron energy distributions @xcite in the decays @xmath67 . however , it is known that there are marked differences in estimates of the non - perturbative @xmath58-contribution , obtained by using the @xmath63-corrections in the hqet approach and alternative methods based on the breit - wigner - shaped resonant amplitudes @xcite .",
    "data may eventually provide a discrimination against some of these approaches , but currently at least four different variations on this theme exist in the literature @xcite . this ld - uncertainty therefore compromises theoretical precision on decay rates and has to be taken into account .",

    "we find that the partial branching ratio in the sm is uncertain by typically @xmath75 ( @xmath76 for the decay @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) , but the ratio @xmath13 is remarkably stable with typical error less than several percent .",

    "have been studied earlier in ref .",
    "we point out that these estimates are uncertain by almost @xmath80 due to the sensitive scale - dependence and their stabilization requires next - to - leading order corrections . in the case of the cp - even parts , we recall that the inclusion of the explicit @xmath81 corrections in the matrix elements has reduced the scale dependence of the decay rates considerably @xcite .    this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we briefly review the derivation of the matrix elements and dilepton invariant mass distributions for the decays @xmath82 including long - distance contributions in the four approaches : ( i ) amm @xcite , ( ii ) ks @xcite , ( iii ) lsw @xcite and ( iv ) hqet @xcite .",
    "the partially integrated branching ratios and cp asymmetries are presented in section 3 where we also specify our input parameters .",
    "we show the scale dependence of the branching ratios @xmath83 and @xmath84 in the amm approach and the contributions arising from the individual wilson coefficients .",
    "we also present a comparative numerical study of the quantities @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 in the four mentioned approaches .",

    "however , for other points in the @xmath184-plane , the uncertainty is perceptible but still small , except for regions of the @xmath184-plane which are already ruled out from the existing ckm fits .",
    "the ratio @xmath13 should be measurable at the tevatron , the later phase of the b - factories , and certainly at the lhc .",
    "the merit of @xmath13 lies in the theoretical precision on @xmath48 ( or on the unitarity triangle ) which we have estimated here and found to be quite competitive with other proposals in the market , some of which are reviewed below .",
    "the @xmath20-@xmath21 mixing ratio @xmath185 can be expressed as follows : @xmath186 the achievable accuracy on @xmath187 depends , apart from the experimental measurement error , on the knowledge of the ratio of the hadronic matrix elements @xmath188 , for which the current lattice estimate is @xmath189 @xcite .",
    "the errors reflect , respectively , the actual calculational error of this ratio in the quenched approximation , estimated effects of unquenching , and from chiral loops .",
    "thus , the present theoretical error on this quantity is of @xmath190 and it remains a theoretical challenge to improve this significantly .",
    "however , the measurement of @xmath191 , for which the present experimental lower bound is 12.4 ps@xmath31 ( at 95% c.l.)@xcite , may turn out to provide the first measurement of @xmath187 , as the central value of @xmath191 in the sm is around @xmath192 @xcite , which is not too far from the present limit .",

    "the expected theoretical accuracy on the ratio @xmath199 is , however , not anticipated to be better than @xmath200 @xcite .",
    "the corresponding ld - corrections in the ratios of neutral @xmath14-decays , @xmath201 are expected to be smaller @xcite due to their being both colour and ( electric)-charge suppressed , hence reducing the theoretical uncertainty , but probably not better than @xmath202 .",
    "finally , we also note the constraints on @xmath48 , which can be obtained from the measurements of the ratios of some exclusive two - body non - leptonic decays , such as @xmath203 , advocated in ref .",
    "this method may provide interesting results on the ckm ratio , but once data are available on the fcnc radiative and semileptonic decays discussed above , they are expected to provide more reliable information on the ckm matrix elements @xmath22 and @xmath23 . in particular , the ratio @xmath13 may provide one of the most precise determinations of @xmath204 .",
    "we hope that the results presented here will help focus attention on experimental measurements of the branching ratios and cp asymmetries in the fcnc decays @xmath93 .",
