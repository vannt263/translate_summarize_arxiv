    "in the highly successful @xmath0cdm cosmology , the large scale structure ( lss ) forms through a process known as hierarchical clustering in which small - scale objects collapse first and merge to form systems of ever - increasing size .",
    "this scenario leads to a `` cosmic web '' of structure where galaxies reside mainly along filaments while galaxy clusters arise at the intersections of two or more filaments ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , a picture of a multi - phase intergalactic medium ( igm ) has emerged .",
    "a hot phase , often referred to as the intracluster medium ( icm ) because it is found inside and around clusters and groups of galaxies , has a temperature @xmath1 k and is observable via x - ray emission .",
    "the warm - hot intergalactic medium ( whim ) ( @xmath2 k ) is found mainly in filaments of galaxies @xcite .",
    "gas in the igm is heated by cosmological shocks which arise as objects in the hierarchy form . @xcite .",
    "magnetic fields are observed in galaxies of all types and in galaxy clusters .",
    "moreover , there is some evidence that they permeate the filaments of the cosmic web .",
    "various scenarios for the origin of galactic magnetic fields are discussed in @xcite of this volume .",
    "the basic idea is that weak fields , generated either by an exotic early universe mechanism or some astrophysical process , are amplified to @xmath3 g strength during galaxy formation and by dynamo action during the subsequent quiescent phase of galaxy evolution .",
    "similarly , weak seed magnetic fields can be amplified into the intergalactic magnetic field ( igmf ) by turbulent flow motions during the formation of the lss through a process known as small - scale turbulence dynamo . in a turbulence dynamo , kinetic energy of the fluid in converted to magnetic energy through stretching , twisting , and folding of the field ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "in addition , feedback from the black hole regions in active galactic nuclei ( agns ) can also contribute and amplify magnetic fields in the igm .",
    "this chapter will explore the structure formation - magnetic field connection .",
    "in particular , we will address two interrelated questions .",
    "first , can the structure formation itself generate new magnetic fields and amplify existing ones ? second , what role do magnetic fields play in structure formation and in other astrophysical processes ?",
    "an outline of the chapter is as follows : in section 2 , we briefly review the observational evidence for magnetic fields in the clusters and filaments of the cosmic web . in section 3 ,",
    "we describe various astrophysical mechanisms for the generation of seed magnetic fields , which would later be maintained and amplified within galaxies and clusters . in section 4",
    ", we discuss the evolution and role of magnetic fields during the first star formation : their stabilization due to a non - zero ionization degree as well as their potential implication for star formation .",
    "we then describe how magnetic fields are amplified during structure formation in section 5 .",
    "we discuss the effects of magnetic fields on the propagation of cosmic rays in the igm and also the faraday rotation measure ( rm ) induced by magnetic fields in section 6 .",
    "section 7 presents something of a departure from the more phenomenological and astrophysical discussion as it provides a formal treatment of the evolution of density perturbations in the presence of magnetic fields .",
    "finally , a brief summary follows in section 8 .",
    "the existence and strength of the igmf has been deduced from observations of synchrotron emission and confirmed directly from observations of rm ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for review ) .",
    "synchrotron emission from a galaxy cluster was first discovered by @xcite who surveyed the coma cluster in the radio . since then",
    ", it has been observed in numerous clusters , either as radio halos or as radio relics ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) . the diffuse radiation from radio halos is mostly unpolarized , and is thought to emerge from turbulent magnetic fields in the icm .",
    "the radiation from radio relics is highly polarized and is believed to be emitted from shocked regions in the icm . the strength of the magnetic field in radio halos is estimated to be @xmath4 g , while stronger fields are found radio relics .",
    "these estimates either assume equipartition ( also known as the minimum energy argument ) or incorporate measurements of inverse - compton emission .",
    "observations of the igmf based on faraday rotation have also been done , though mostly for magnetic fields in the icm ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "an rm map of the coma cluster , for example , reveals a field with a strength @xmath5 g and a coherence length of order @xmath6  kpc @xcite . for abell clusters ,",
    "the typical rm is @xmath7 which indicates an average field strength of @xmath810  @xmath3 g @xcite .",
    "rm maps of clusters can be used to determine the power spectrum of turbulent magnetic fields in the icm .",
    "for instance , a kolmogorov - like spectrum with a bending at a few kpc scale is found in the cooled core region of the hydra cluster @xcite , and spectra consistent with the kolmogorov spectrum were reported in the wider icm for the abell 2382 cluster @xcite and for the coma cluster @xcite .",
    "the nature of the igmf in filaments , on the contrary , remains largely unknown , because the studies of synchrotron emission and rm outside clusters are still scarce and controversial .",
    "although faint radio emission has been observed in the outskirts of clusters ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , there are no confirmed observations of synchrotron emission from filaments",
    ". such measurements present a challenge for current facilities . as well , the removal of the galactic foreground is a non - trivial task ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "at present there is an upper limit of @xmath9 g for the strength of the igmf in filaments based on the observed limit of the rms of background quasars @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite reported a lower bound for the strength of the magnetic field in voids .",
    "their claim , if true , is significant as it would represent the first evidence for magnetic fields in such low - density regions and on such large scales .",
    "the basic idea is that an igmf will deflect charged particles that arise in an electromagnetic cascade whose source is the very high energy @xmath10-rays produced in an agn . a non - observation of @xmath10-ray secondaries coincident with vhe @xmath10-rays ,",
    "is then taken as evidence of magnetic deflection along the path from the source to the observer .",
    "@xcite quote a lower bound of @xmath11 based on observations by the fermi and the high energy stereoscopic system ( hess ) telescopes .",
    "a similar analysis was performed by @xcite using data from the magic telescope though they are more cautious in presenting their conclusions and model dependencies .",
    "note that @xcite assume continuous emission of gamma - rays for @xmath12 years , or longer which may not be realistic .",
    "if this assumption is relaxed , then one obtains a more conservative lower bound @xcite .    the detection of the igmf in filaments , if it exists , might be made with the next generation radio facilities .",
    "these facilities include the square kilometer array ( ska ) , and upcoming ska pathfinders , the australian ska pathfinder ( askap ) and the south african karoo array telescope ( meerkat ) , as well the low frequency array ( lofar ) ( see , e.g. , papers in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    for discussions on magnetic fields in the icm and cluster outskirts , see @xcite and @xcite of this volume .",
    "the biermann battery is a promising mechanism for the creation of astrophysical magnetic fields .",
    "the mechanism arises in an ionized plasma whenever baroclinity exists , that is , when isodensity surfaces do not coincide with isobaric surfaces .",
    "this situation leads to an extra pressure gradient term in ohm s law which drives currents .",
    "these currents , in turn , generate magnetic fields at a rate given by @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the electron density and pressure , respectively @xcite . though the mechanism was originally studied in the context of stars @xcite , it may arise during structure formation in cosmology whenever the electron pressure and density gradients are not aligned , as often occurs in shocks @xcite .",
    "we note that vorticity , @xmath16 , is generated when the total pressure and density gradients are not aligned ( baroclinity of flows  see equation [ ryu - e02 ] below ) . in an ionized plasma , a simple order of magnitude estimate",
    "yields @xmath17 since the present - day vorticity in the igm is of order @xmath18 a few km s@xmath19kpc@xmath19 ( see section [ s - turb ] below ) , the seed fields from the biermann battery will be rather small ( @xmath20 g ) .",
    "however , vorticity , and hence seed fields , were almost certainly larger at early times .",
    "the following argument , based on dimensional analysis , suggests that for the objects which dominate the structure hierarchy at a given epoch the ratio of the vorticity to the hubble parameter , @xmath21 , is roughly constant and of order a few hundred .",
    "once an object collapses , @xmath22 where @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 are the characteristic mass , velocity and size of the object",
    ". the spherical collapse model , which serves as a useful toy - model for structure formation in an expanding universe , predicts that the mean density within an object is a factor @xmath26 times the critical density , @xmath27 .",
    "moreover , objects tend to follow the mass - size relation @xmath28 .",
    "if we put all this together and use the fact that the critical density scales as the square of the hubble parameter , we find that @xmath29 .",
    "thus , we expect larger seed fields at early times . similarly , the dynamical time for objects formed in the early universe is shorter than for objects today and hence the amplification of the magnetic fields by dynamo action will be more rapid . in short ,",
    "the biermann battery - dynamo amplification process may well operate at all stages of the structure - formation hierarchy .",
    "various alternatives have also been considered .",
    "for example , @xcite considered a battery driven by electron diffusion .",
    "@xcite considered the biermann effect during the epoch of reionization when ionization fronts sweep through the medium generating currents and magnetic fields .",
    "the fields are again fairly modest , but could be large enough to seed a dynamo which then amplifies them to an astrophysically interesting strength .      at finite temperatures ,",
    "a plasma exhibits a finite ( though possibly low ) level of thermal fluctuations at all scales @xmath30 and frequencies @xmath31 .",
    "differences in the thermal motions between the different charges generate micro - currents and hence electromagnetic fields which , on average , provide a noisy electromagnetic background . in the early universe ,",
    "the gas is both hot and dilute .",
    "for example , the gas temperature is @xmath32 ev both at the recombination epoch and after reionization but before the formation of lss .",
    "therefore , the cosmic gas constitutes a classical plasma to which the classical fluctuation theory @xcite can be applied .",
    "according to this theory , the power spectral density of magnetic field fluctuations @xmath33 at wavenumber @xmath34 and frequency @xmath31 is obtained from the spatial correlation function of the fluctuating magnetic fields and is given by @xmath35 here , the fluctuating field is designated by lower case letters , @xmath36 , @xmath37 is the index of refraction and @xmath38 is the complex transverse dielectric response function of the isotropic plasma .",
    "the latter , in ( nonrelativistic ) thermal equilibrium , is given by @xmath39 where the sum is over negative ( @xmath40 ) and positive ( @xmath41 ) charges , @xmath42 , the respective plasma frequencies , and @xmath43 , the derivative of the equilibrium distribution @xmath44 which is assumed to be maxwellian .",

    "were we to have integrated over all frequencies @xmath69 , we would have obtained the equipartition between magnetic and electron thermal energy densities @xmath70 which holds in thermal equilibrium .",
    "evidently , the thermal fluctuation level in equation ( [ treumann - e04 ] ) is quite low . in order to obtain a @xmath71 g field ,",
    "the spectral energy density must be amplified by the large factor of @xmath72}}/\\sqrt{t_{\\rm ev}}$ ] .",
    "dynamos on galactic or cluster scales need seed fields on comparably large scales to get them started .",
    "moreover , large - scale dynamos require turbulence and/or helicity which may not exist at adequate levels . recently , the so - called filamentation ( or weibel ) instability @xcite has been discussed as a generator of the igmf @xcite and a possible alternative to dynamos on galactic and extragalactic scales .",
    "the weibel instability does require a strong departure of the plasma state from thermal equilibrium , which can be provided by fast beams on the plasma background @xcite or temperature anisotropies .",
    "the latter can be caused by pressure anisotropies @xcite , shock waves @xcite , or thin current sheets .",
    "turbulence , if it exists in the early universe , leads to thin current sheets which can accelerate particles by second - order fermi acceleration @xcite , the local electric field which is generated in the current sheets , or by reconnection . here",
    ", we discuss the possibility that the instability is driven by kinetic pressure / temperature anisotropies in the absence of magnetic field , as a mechanism to create seed fields .",
    "pressure and temperature anisotropies are probably superior to the beam for driving the instability for the simple reason that beams are highly unstable with respect to high - frequency plasma instabilities ( langmuir and buneman modes ) .",
    "if the beams have velocity @xmath73 and are current - compensated ( i.e. , the velocities of particles with different charges are the same ) then the two - stream instability is excited with growth rate @xmath74 .",
    "current - compensated beams arise in the symmetric counter - streaming configurations found in shocks . for the reasonable beam density @xmath75",
    "we find @xmath76 few khz with a wavenumber is @xmath77 .",
    "if the beams are not current compensated , which is the case in turbulence where a multitude of thin current sheets is generated , then the buneman instability is excited with growth rate @xmath78 hz , if the current velocity @xmath79 exceeds the electron thermal speed @xmath80 . otherwise , for @xmath81 , the ion sound will be excited with growth rate roughly @xmath82 few 10@xmath67 hz .",
    "all these instabilities grow very fast and readily deplete the beams / streams , heating the electron plasma in the direction of flow and thus causing the pressure or temperature anisotropy of electrons with higher temperature along the flow direction , i.e. @xmath83 to @xmath84 .",
    "if this is assumed to be the ( readily achieved ) final microscopic state , then the temperature anisotropy @xmath85 becomes unstable with respect to the weibel thermally anisotropic mode .",
    "the temperature anisotropy corresponds to a pressure anisotropy @xmath86 $ ] .",
    "one should note that only the electrons , because of their large mobility , are important ; the ions are much less active on these microscopic time scales and thus do not contribute .    in this thermally anisotropic case , the electrons obey a bi - maxwellian equilibrium distribution function @xmath87 , \\label{treumann - e07}\\ ] ] and the weibel instability takes over with the linear electromagnetic dispersion relation @xmath88 and the transverse dielectric response function @xmath89 \\right\\ } -\\frac{\\omega_i^2}{\\omega^2 } = n^2 .",

    "hence , @xmath93 .",
    "the contribution of the resting ions has been retained for completeness ; because of the smallness of the ion plasma frequency @xmath94 , being much less than the electron plasma frequency @xmath95 , it plays no role in the instability but is important in the discussion of the thermal level .",

    "magnetic fields of @xmath117 g on kpc - scales would arise in @xmath118 years or so provided the fields on smaller scales do not saturate the instability .",
    "if magnetic fields were created before or during recombination they could have had a significant impact on the thermal and chemical evolution of gas during the dark ages , on the formation of first stars and galaxies , and on the epoch of reionization ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the ionization degree freezes out at about @xmath122 @xcite . though this ionization degree may seem rather low , it is significantly higher than the typical ionization degree in present - day molecular clouds @xcite .",
    "more to the point , it is high enough to prevent non - ideal magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) processes such as ambipolar or ohmic diffusion from dissipating the magnetic fields .",
    "the more relevant question is whether magnetic fields can be sustained during gravitational collapse when both the density and recombination rate increase and hence the ionization degree decreases .",
    "gravitational collapse occurs on length scales where the thermal pressure can no longer balance the gravitational force .",
    "the critical length scale is given by the jeans length @xmath123 where @xmath124 is the thermal sound speed and @xmath125 the mass density .",

    "their one - zone model takes into account the density evolution in the central core , where the collapse takes place on the free - fall timescale @xmath126 .",

    "the calculations of @xcite and @xcite showed that the ionization degree evolves roughly as @xmath128 until a density of @xmath129 @xmath60 is reached . at this stage ,",
    "the recombination rate becomes so high that the proton abundance becomes negligible .",
    "however , the presence of lithium and the low recombination rate of li@xmath130 stabilizes the ionization degree at a level of @xmath131 , and it stays roughly constant even at higher densities .    in order to assess the implications of this result , @xcite combine the chemical network of @xcite with a state - of - the - art model for ambipolar and ohmic diffusions , based on the work of @xcite and @xcite . in their multi - fluid approach , the ambipolar diffusion rate is given as @xmath132 where the @xmath133 denotes the magnetic field .",

    "the above deflection is much larger than the deflection by the gmf ; the deflection angle due to the gmf was predicted to be a few degree ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "as a matter of fact , the deflection angle of @xmath309 is also much than the angular window of @xmath311 used by the auger collaboration in the study of the correlation between their highest energy uhecr events and nearby agns @xcite .",
    "although the deflection angle is large , @xcite noticed that in the work of @xcite , the separation angle between the arrival direction of super - gzk protons and the sky position of nearest agns is substantially smaller with @xmath312 , which is similar to the mean angular distance in the sky to nearest neighbors among agns .",

    "the existence of magnetic fields in the early universe , although probably weak , can have consequences on the structure formation itself . in this section",
    ", we briefly review recent developments in our understanding of magnetized structure formation .",
    "studies of magnetized structure formation go back to the late 1960s with the early efforts based on newtonian gravity and the relativistic approaches being a relatively recent addition .",
    "all treatments typically work within the ideal mhd approximation and look at the effects of the magnetic lorentz force on density inhomogeneities @xcite .",
    "these effects generally come in the form of scalar , vector and ( trace - free ) tensor distortions .",
    "the former are those commonly referred to as density perturbations and represent over - densities or under - densities in the matter distribution .",
    "vector inhomogeneities describe rotational ( i.e. vortex - like ) density perturbations .",
    "finally , tensor - type density inhomogeneities correspond to shape distortions .",
    "following @xcite , we define the scalar @xmath347 which describes linear density perturbations and corresponds to the more familiar density contrast @xmath348 .",
    "note that positive values for @xmath349 indicate over - densities and negative ones under - densities . also , @xmath350 is the cosmological scale factor and @xmath351 is the 3-d laplacian operator that corresponds to an observer moving with 4-velocity @xmath352 .",
    "( so that @xmath353 ) , the tensor @xmath354 projects orthogonal to @xmath352 and @xmath355 defines the covariant derivative operator of the spatial hypersurfaces ( @xmath356 is the space - time metric and @xmath357 the associated covariant derivative ) . ] in a perturbed , weakly magnetized and spatially flat friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) universe , the above defined scalar evolves according to @xmath358 where over - dots denote proper - time derivatives ( relative to the @xmath352-frame ) . also , @xmath359 is the ( constant ) barotropic index of the matter , @xmath360 is the background hubble parameter ( with @xmath361 there ) and @xmath362 is the square of the alfvn speed .",
    "the variables @xmath363 and @xmath364 describe linear inhomogeneities in the smooth hubble expansion and in the magnetic energy density respectively .",
    "then , to first order , @xmath365 and @xmath366 respectively . note that @xmath367 is the square of the adiabatic sound speed and we have assumed that @xmath368 , given the relative weakness of the magnetic fields .    equation ( [ dotdelta ] ) shows that magnetic fields are generic sources of linear density perturbations .",
    "indeed , even if @xmath349 and @xmath369 are zero initially , @xmath370 will take nonzero values solely due to the magnetic presence .",
    "also , equation ( [ dotcb ] ) ensures that perturbations in the magnetic field energy density evolve in tune with their matter counterparts ( i.e. @xmath371 ) .",
    "finally , we should emphasize that only the pressure part of the lorentz force contributes to the linear relations ( [ dotdelta ] ) and ( [ dotcz ] ) . , with the former term corresponding to the magnetic pressure and the latter to the field s tension .",
    "the effects of the @xmath372-field on ( scalar ) density perturbations propagate via the divergence of the lorentz force . to leading order ,",
    "the latter is given by @xmath373 , where @xmath374 represents the background 3-curvature index .",
    "given that @xmath375 at the ideal - mhd limit , the magnetic tension effects are not included in this perturbative level , unless the spatial curvature of the frw model is accounted for @xcite . ]",
    "the system of equations ( [ dotdelta ] )  ( [ dotcb ] ) has analytical solutions in the radiation and dust eras @xcite . before equipartition , when @xmath376 , @xmath377 , @xmath378 and @xmath379constant , large - scale magnetized density perturbations obey a power - law solution .",
    "in particular , on super - horizon scales and keeping only the dominant growing and decaying modes , one arrives at @xcite @xmath380 in the absence of magnetic fields , we recover the standard growing and decaying modes of @xmath381 and @xmath382 respectively .",
    "so , the magnetic presence has reduced the growth rate of the density contrast by @xmath383 .",
    "well inside the horizon we can no longer ignore the role of the pressure gradients .",
    "there , the @xmath62-mode oscillates like a magneto - sonic wave with @xmath384\\ , , \\label{ssrdelta}\\ ] ] where @xmath385 is the perturbed scale and @xmath386 the hubble horizon @xcite . here , the magnetic pressure increases the effective sound speed and therefore the oscillation frequency .",
    "the former makes the jeans length larger than in non - magnetized models .",
    "the latter brings the peaks of short - wavelength oscillations in the radiation density closer , leaving a potentially observable signature in the cmb spectrum @xcite .    when dust dominates , @xmath387 , @xmath388 , @xmath389 and @xmath390 .",
    "then , on superhorizon scales , the main growing and decaying modes of the density contrast are @xcite @xmath391 with @xmath392/6 $ ] . in the absence of magnetic fields we recover again the standard solution with @xmath393 and @xmath394 .",
    "thus , as with the radiation era before , the magnetic presence slows down the growth rate of density perturbations .",
    "also , since @xmath371 [ see equation ( [ dotcb ] ) ] , the above describes the linear evolution of the magnetic energy - density perturbations as well .",
    "this means that cosmological magnetic fields trapped inside an overdense region of the post - recombination universe could grow by approximately two to three orders of magnitude .",
    "note that the aforementioned increase is different from the one occurring during the subsequent , nonlinear contraction of a protogalactic cloud ( see section [ s - nonl ] below ) .",
    "the field pressure also leads to a magnetically induced jeans length , below which density perturbations can not grow @xcite . as a fraction of the hubble radius ,",
    "this purely magnetic jeans scale is @xcite @xmath395 setting @xmath396 g , which is the maximum homogeneous field strength allowed by the cmb @xcite , we find that @xmath397 kpc . alternative , magnetic fields close to @xmath398 g , like those found in galaxies and galaxy clusters , give @xmath399 mpc .",
    "the latter lies intriguingly close to the size of a cluster of galaxies .",
    "overall , the magnetic effect on density perturbations is rather negative .",
    "although magnetic fields generate this type of distortions , they do not help them to grow .",
    "instead , the magnetic presence either suppresses the growth rate of density perturbations , or increases the effective jeans length and therefore the domain where these inhomogeneities can not grow .",
    "this negative role of magnetic fields , which was also observed in the newtonian treatment of @xcite , reflects the fact that only the pressure part of the lorentz force has been incorporated into the equations . when the tension component ( i.e. the elasticity of the field lines ) is also accounted for , the overall magnetic effect can change and in some cases it could even reverse @xcite .",
    "magnetic fields also induce and affect rotational , vortex - like , density inhomogeneities @xcite . to linear order , these are described by the vector @xmath400 , with @xmath401 representing the 3-d levi - civita tensor . then , on an spatially flat frw background , @xmath402 after matter - radiation equality @xcite . defining @xmath403 as the alfvn horizon , we may write the associated solution in the form @xmath404 with @xmath405/6 $ ] . on scales far exceeding the alfvn horizon , @xmath406 and",
    "the perturbed mode decays as @xmath407 .",
    "this rate is considerably slower than @xmath408 , the decay rate associated with magnetic - free dust cosmologies .",
    "well inside @xmath409 , on the other hand , magnetized vortices oscillate like alfvn waves , with @xcite @xmath410\\ , .",
    "\\label{sscw}\\ ] ] thus , the effect of magnetic fields on a given vortex mode is to reduce its standard depletion rate .",
    "analogous is the magnetic effect on @xmath411 , namely on the vorticity proper .",
    "hence , magnetized cosmologies appear to rotate faster than their magnetic - free counterparts .",
    "in contrast to density perturbations , magnetic fields seem to favor the presence of vorticity . this qualitative difference should probably be attributed to the fact that the tension part of the lorentz force also contributes to equation ( [ ddotw ] ) .",
    "in addition to scalar and vector perturbations , magnetic fields also generate and affect tensor - type inhomogeneities that describe shape - distortions in the density distribution @xcite .",
    "an initially spherically symmetric inhomogeneity , for example , will change shape due to the magnetically induced anisotropy .",
    "all these effects result from the lorentz force . even when the latter is removed from the system",
    ", however , magnetic fields remain active .",
    "due to its energy density and anisotropic nature , for example , magnetism affects both the local and long - range gravitational fields .",
    "the anisotropic magnetic pressure , in particular , leads to shear distortions and subsequently to gravitational - wave production @xcite .",
    "overall , magnetic fields are a very versatile source .",
    "they are also rather unique in nature , since they are the only known vector source of energy .",
    "an additional unique magnetic feature , which remains relatively unexplored , is the field s tension .",
    "when we add to all these the widespread presence of magnetic fields in the universe , it is not unreasonable to say that no realistic structure formation scenario should a priori exclude them .",
    "the evolution of large - scale magnetic fields during the nonlinear stages of structure formation is addressed primarily by means of numerical simulations .",
    "the reason is the high complexity of the nonlinear mhd equations , which considerably hampers analytical studies , unless certain simplifying assumptions are imposed .",
    "the simplest approximation is to assume spherically symmetric compression .",
    "realistic collapse , however , is not isotropic .",
    "in fact , when magnetic fields are present , their generically anisotropic nature makes the need to go beyond spherical symmetry greater .",
    "certain aspects of anisotropic contraction can be analytically studied within the zeldovich approximation @xcite .",
    "the latter is based on a simple ansatz , which extrapolates to the nonlinear regime a well known linear result .",
    "the assumption is that the irrotational and acceleration - free linear motion of dust , also holds during the early nonlinear stages of galaxy formation .",
    "this allows the analytical treatment of the nonlinear equations , leading to solutions that describe anisotropic ( one dimensional ) collapse and to the formation of the well - known zeldovich pancakes .",
    "suppose that magnetic fields are frozen into a highly conductive protogalactic cloud that is falling into the ( newtonian ) potential wells formed by the cold dark matter ( cdm ) sector . relative to the physical coordinate system @xmath412 , the motion of the fluid velocity is @xmath413 , where @xmath360 is the hubble parameter of the unperturbed frw background and @xmath414 is the peculiar velocity of the fluid ( with @xmath415 ) .",
    "then , the magnetic field induction equation reads @xcite @xmath416 where @xmath417 and @xmath418 are the peculiar volume scalar and the peculiar shear tensor respectively .",
    "the former takes negative values ( i.e. @xmath419 ) , since we are dealing with a protogalactic cloud that has started to turn around and collapse .",
    "also note that the first term in the right - hand side of equation ( [ zdotb ] ) reflects the background expansion , the second is due to the peculiar contraction and the last carries the anisotropic effects . introducing the rescaled magnetic field @xmath420 , the above expression recasts into @xmath421 with primes indicating differentiation with respect to the scale factor",
    "also @xmath422 and @xmath423 , where @xmath424 and @xmath425 ( with @xmath426 and @xmath427 ) . in the shear eigen - frame , @xmath428 and",
    "equation ( [ zrb ] ) leads to @xmath429 with exactly analogous relations for the rest of the magnetic components .",
    "the resulting system describes the second - order evolution of magnetic fields , which is frozen - in with the highly conductive matter of a collapsing protogalaxy , within the limits of the zeldovich approximation . to obtain analytical solutions",
    ", we recall that in the absence of rotation and acceleration , the peculiar volume scalar is given by @xmath430 at the same time , @xmath431 while analogous expressions hold for the other two shear eigenvalues .",
    "note that @xmath432 , @xmath433 and @xmath434 are the eigenvalues of the initial tidal field that determine the nature of the collapse @xcite .",
    "one - dimensional collapse along , say , the third eigen - direction is characterized by @xmath435 and by @xmath436 . in that case , the pancake singularity is reached as @xmath437 .",
    "spherically symmetric collapse , on the other hand , has @xmath438 .",
    "then , we have a point - like singularity when @xmath439 .    substituting , equations ( [ vartheta ] ) and ( [ tsigma1 ] ) into the right - hand side of equation ( [ zrb1 ] ) we arrive at the solution @xmath440\\left({a_0\\over a}\\right)^2\\ , , \\label{zb1}\\ ] ] for the first of the magnetic components .",
    "a similar calculation leads to exactly analogous equations for @xmath441 and @xmath442 .",
    "the zero suffix in the above indicates a given time during the protogalactic collapse .",
    "the ratio @xmath443 in parentheses reflects the magnetic dilution due to the background expansion and the brackets monitor the increase in the field s strength caused by the collapse of the protogalactic cloud . according to ( [ zb1 ] ) , when dealing with pancake collapse along the third eigen - direction , the @xmath442-component decays as @xmath444 , while the other two increase arbitrarily as @xmath437 .",
    "alternatively , during a spherically symmetric contraction , the magnetic field evolve as @xmath445 here , all the magnetic components diverge as we approach the point singularity ( i.e. for @xmath439 ) . comparing the two results , we deduce that the anisotropic ( pancake ) collapse leads to a stronger increase as long as @xmath446 .",
    "the later is always satisfied , provided that the initial conditions are the same for both types of collapse , given that @xmath447 and @xmath448 [ see expression ( [ vartheta ] ) above ] .",
    "our qualitative analysis indicates that magnetic fields trapped in an anisotropically contracting protogalactic cloud will increase beyond the limits of the idealized spherically symmetric collapse . also , the amplified magnetic fields will end up essentially confined to the galactic plane",
    "quantitatively , the achieved final strength depends on the time the magnetic back - reaction has grown strong enough to halt the collapse @xcite .",
    "thus , the longer the anisotropic collapse persists , the stronger the residual magnetic fields .",
    "the analytical study of @xcite , in particular , showed that ( realistically speaking ) the anisotropy could add one or two orders of magnitude to the magnetic strength achieved through conventional isotropic compression .",
    "these results appear in very good agreement with numerical studies simulating shear and tidal effects on the magnetic field evolution in galaxies and galaxy clusters @xcite .",
    "the cosmic web , a network of filaments and nodes wherein most galaxies reside , is a prediction of the highly successful @xmath0cdm cosmology and appears to be borne out by by simulations and observations .",
    "the web is filled with an ionized plasma , the igm , which is expected to be permeated by magnetic fields . in this chapter , we reviewed recent developments in our theoretical understanding of the nature and origin of igmf with a special focus on fields outside of clusters .",
    "we addressed two basic questions : first , `` can the process of structure formation generate seed magnetic fields and amplify them ? '' and second , `` what role do magnetic fields play in structure formation and in other astrophysical processes ?",
    "'' we presented several plasma physics mechanisms for the generation of seed magnetic fields , and showed that these fields could be amplified during the first star formation and later during the formation of the cosmic web .",
    "we saw that magnetic fields with a strength of @xmath449 ng are expected in filaments at the present universe , while magnetic fields should be stronger in and around clusters / groups .",
    "we then discussed the effects and implications of magnetic fields on the formation of the first stars .",
    "we also presented a formal treatment of the evolution of density perturbations in the presence of magnetic fields and their effects on the formation of structures .",
    "magnetic fields in the igm are difficult to be observed , mainly due to the weak nature of them , as well as due to the diffuseness of the media .",
    "however , the next generation radio interferometers including the square kilometer array ( ska ) , and upcoming ska pathfinders , the australian ska pathfinder ( askap ) and the south african karoo array telescope ( meerkat ) , as well the low frequency array ( lofar ) will enable us to investigate magnetic fields outside clusters with high - sensitivity observations of synchrotron radiation and rm ( see , e.g. , papers in * ? ? ? * ) .",
