    "argumentation frameworks ( afs ) are a convenient way to represent conflicting information and to deduce which subset of the information can be inferred .",
    "for instance , they can be used to model dialogs between several agents @xcite or to analyze on - line discussion between social network users @xcite .",
    "argumentation can also be useful in a mono - agent setting , for instance to infer non - trivial conclusions from an inconsistent knowledge base @xcite .",
    "the domain called _ dynamics of argumentation _ has become a hot topic in recent years , with numerous publications about it .",
    "the first ones consider really classical debate scenarios as the source of the dynamic process @xcite .",
    "these approaches are perfectly well - suited for classical exchange of arguments between agents .",
    "then , some approaches have proposed to consider new scenarios , closer to what happens with belief change in logical settings @xcite : these approaches propose to question the existing relation between arguments , and to modify this relation if it is required @xcite .",
    "+ these works directly deal with the structure of the abstract afs .",
    "an interesting question is `` what does af revision mean when we consider logic - based afs ? '' .",
    "indeed , it is not obvious that attacks between arguments can be changed , since they stem from the logical inference relation ; for instance , if arguments @xmath0 and @xmath1 attack each other because their claims are the negation of each other ( _ rebuttal _ attack ) , then it is not accurate to consider that the attack between @xmath0 and @xmath1 could be removed .",
    "but this is only the case when we consider completely specified deductive arguments @xcite .",
    "as argued in the literature @xcite , the arguments which are used in real situations are often enthymemes , which are partially specified arguments : some parts of the support or some parts of the claim are not described , because it is supposed that they belong to some `` common knowledge ''",
    ". there may be different reasons for an agent not to share some part of her knowledge , such as some cost on the communication process .",
    "then , the agent who receives an enthymeme must decide how to complete the content of the enthymeme to be able to use it .",
    "but if the missing formulae to complete the enthymeme are not part of the agent s beliefs ( or at least , are not considered by the agent as the most accurate way to complete the enthymeme ) , then she will use a badly completed enthymeme in her argumentation framework .",
    "we see with this situation that , even with an underlying logical belief base , the nature of arguments and attacks is not absolute ; it depends on the agent s beliefs and on her way to complete enthymemes .",
    "+ so we propose to consider the use of enthymemes in the argumentation process to explain the questionability of some attacks .",
    "we illustrate the possibility that a logic - based argumentation framework contains mistaken attacks .",
    "then we show that the existing work on the dynamics of afs can be used on such enthymeme - based afs , as soon as a distinction between classical deductive arguments and enthymemes is done in the abstract af , and that this distinction is used in the revision process .",
    "+ the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the first section presents the background notions required to the understanding of the paper . in particular",
    ", we describe briefly belief revision , abstract argumentation and revision of afs , and logic - based argumentation .",
    "then in the second section , we focus on enthymemes in logic - based afs ; we explain how using enthymemes can be a source of mistaken attacks in the resulting af . the following section illustrates the revision process on logic - based afs which contain enthymemes . after the description of a basic approach in which each attack concerning an enthymeme is questionable , we propose a refinement of this approach based on the notion of fixed part of an enthymeme .",
    "finally , the last section concludes the paper and sketches some interesting future work .",
    "belief revision is well - known when an agent s beliefs are represented in a logical setting .",
    "the intuitive idea is `` how can an agent incorporate a new piece of information into her beliefs ? '' , which is not a trivial question when the agent s previous beliefs and the new piece of information are conflicting .",
    "one of the most influencial works on this topic is the agm framework @xcite , which gives rationality postulates for belief change operators , when the beliefs are represented as deductively closed sets of formulae .",
    "here we are interested in the adaptation of agm revision to finite propositional logic by katsuno and mendelzon .",
    "they explain that revising a formula @xmath2 by a formula @xmath3 is equivalent to selecting some models of @xmath3 which are minimal w.r.t . some plausibility relation .",
    "this relation has to satisfy some properties .",

    "its stable extensions are @xmath50 .",
    "as explained in the introduction , the question of change in afs has been tackled by several approaches .",
    "here we use the _ translation - based revision _ from @xcite .",
    "the idea of this method is to translate the af and the semantics into a propositional formula , to use a km revision operator to perform the expected change , and then to decode the models of the revised formula to obtain a set of revised afs .",
    "the propositional encoding is a generalization of a result from besnard and doutre .",
    "they have defined a formula @xmath51 , built on propositional variables corresponding to the arguments , such that the set of models of @xmath51 exactly correspond to the set of stable extensions of an af . @xcite",
    "generalize this encoding with the addition of two other kinds of variables @xmath52 .",
    "@xmath53 means that there is an attack from the argument @xmath54 to the argument @xmath55 , and @xmath56 means that the argument @xmath54 is skeptically accepted .",
    "given an af @xmath57 , the stable encoding of @xmath39 is @xmath58 where @xmath59 \\end{array}\\ ] ]    in general , @xmath60 can be defined for any semantics @xmath38 as soon as the formula @xmath51 exists ; for semantics with a complexity higher than np , we can consider for instance qbf encodings to define @xmath51 .",
    "then , the revision operator is defined as follow :    given @xmath12 a km revision operator and @xmath2 a propositional formula built from the set of variables @xmath61 , the _ translation - based revision operator _",
    "@xmath62 is defined as @xmath63 with @xmath64 a mapping from a formula @xmath65 to a set of afs @xmath66 such that each af @xmath67 corresponds to one of the models @xmath68 of @xmath65 : @xmath69 appears in @xmath70 iff @xmath53 is true in @xmath68 .",
    "this general definition allows to change any attack and argument status as long as it is compatible with @xmath38 .",
    "if additional constraints should be satisfied , the use of a constrained version is possible :    given @xmath12 a km revision operator and @xmath71 two propositional formulae built from the set of variables @xmath61 , the _ constrained translation - based revision operator _ @xmath72 is defined as @xmath73    to conclude , let us mention a particular revision operator proposed by @xcite : we call @xmath74 ( resp .",
    "@xmath75 ) the translation - based ( resp . constrained translation - based ) revision operator which gives priority to the minimal change of the attack relation .",
    "this operator is similar to the dalal - based revision revision operator @xmath76 , but it uses a weighted version of the hamming distance such that changing the value of a single @xmath53 variable is more expensive than changing the value of each @xmath56 variable .",
    "we consider the af @xmath77 given in figure  [ fig : ex - graphe ] .",
    "we suppose the existence of an integrity constraint @xmath78 , which means that the attacks from @xmath79 and @xmath80 to @xmath81 must not be removed .",

    "now the extensions are @xmath84 , so @xmath81 is skeptically accepted .",
    "we focus on this kind of revision operators because @xcite already proposes a way to incorporate a constraint on the attack relation , which is required by our approach .",
    "other revision or update operators could be used instead , but we should adapt their definition to take into account the constraint .",
    "the question of the exact nature of arguments and attacks is tackled by several approaches which can be gathered under the name _ structural argumentation_. here we focus on one of the most prominent ones : deductive argumentation @xcite .",
    "[ def : deductive - arg ] a deductive argument built from a belief base @xmath85 is a pair @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is called the _ support _ and @xmath3 the _ claim _ , such that :    1 .",

    "@xmath89 , 3 .",
    "@xmath90 , 4 .",
    "@xmath87 is minimal with respect to @xmath91 among the sets of formulae which satisfy items 1 .",
    "2 . and 3 .",
    "there is an intuitive explanation to this definition .",
    "first the agent is supposed to use her beliefs to justify her claim , which explains the first condition .",
    "the second and third conditions guarantee that the claim is actually supported by the beliefs of the agent , but not by conflicting beliefs ( for instance , the sentence `` it is raining and it is not raining , so i am the queen of england . ''",
    "is not an argument at all ) .",
    "finally , the last condition ensures that there is no useless piece of information in the support : `` it is raining , when it is raining i should use an umbrella , and i love chocolate .",
    "so i will use my umbrella . ''",
    "is not accurate either .",
    "+ the conflicts between deductive arguments may have different natures .",
    "the most general sort of conflict is defined as follow :    a _ defeater _ for an argument @xmath86 is an argument @xmath92 such that @xmath93 , for some @xmath94 .",
    "it is possible to use deductive arguments to build an _ argument tree _ with the arguments and counterarguments which attack and defend a given claim .",
    "+ we can also build a full argumentation framework from the set of deductive arguments generated from a belief base .",
    "given @xmath36 the set of deductive arguments generated from the belief base @xmath85 , the _ exhaustive graph _ associated with @xmath85 is the af@xmath35 with @xmath95 is a defeater for @xmath96 .",
    "here we focus on the defeater relation , which is the most general one , but exhaustive graphs can be generated with another attack relation which guarantees additional properties for the defeaters ( undercut , rebuttal , and so on )",
    ". moreover , these graphs may be infinite in general ; besnard and hunter propose an approach to circumvent this problem .",
    "see @xcite for more details .",
    "before formalizing our approach , we want to explain intuitively , with natural language arguments , why agents can disagree on the attack relation , and more generally why attacks could be questionable .",
    "let us consider the following arguments :    ( c ) : :    the us army is preparing a secret plan to retreat from afghanistan    ( source : wikileaks ) .",
    "( b ) : :    our informed sources say that the wikileaks documents are fake    ( source : ny times ) .",
    "( a ) : :    the media can not be trusted on military issues ( source : n. chomsky ) .",
    "now we consider three agents @xmath97 ; each of them may have some personal beliefs which are not shared with the other agents .",
    "+    * @xmath98 thinks that chomsky is the most credible source , and considers that wikileaks is a media more reliable than ny times .",
    "so her af is the one given in fig .",
    "[ fig : agent - a1 ] .",
    "* @xmath99 thinks that chomsky is a more credible source than ny times , and ny times is a more credible source than wikileaks .",
    "she also believes that wikileaks can not be seen as a media .",
    "so her af is the one given in fig .",
    "[ fig : agent - a2 ] . *",
    "finally , @xmath100 thinks that ny times is the most credible source , and that chomsky is not reliable on this topic .",
    "so her af is the one given in fig .",
    "[ fig : agent - a3 ] .",
    "these personal afs may depend on many different parameters ( additional information which is not available to each agent , preferences , context , previous experience of each agent , and so on ) .",
    "+    of course , under the assumption that the agents share all their knowledge and beliefs , the personal beliefs of the agents can be represented as additional arguments and we obtain a single af representing the whole information about a topic .",
    "but we think that this assumption is too strong for at least three reasons .",
    "first , there may be technical issues with this information sharing ; for instance , there may be some cost on communication between agents , or the global amount of information in the network may be too important to be stored in a centralized way .",
    "then , for strategical reasons , agents may _ choose _ not to share their knowledge and beliefs .",
    "also , if argument are mined from natural language ( for instance , for an analysis of social networks debates ) , there are likely some implicit pieces of information used in the argumentation process . this explains why some attacks may be questionable .",
    "for instance , if the agents @xmath98 and @xmath100 consider that agent @xmath99 is trustworthy , then they could have to change the attack relation in their own afs if they receive from agent @xmath99 the information `` @xmath101 should be accepted '' . on the opposite , if agents vote to determine the arguments statuses , there will be a majority of agents ( @xmath98 and @xmath100 ) voting against @xmath101 ( meaning that @xmath101 is rejected in their afs ) , so agent @xmath99 should modify the attack relation to incorporate this piece of information in her af .    [ [ enthymemes - with - partial - support ] ] enthymemes with partial support + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    now let us formalize this notion of `` arguments with partial knowledge '' , and their role in the existence of mistaken attacks .",
    "hunter defines what he calls _",
    "approximate arguments _ , which are pairs @xmath86 which do _ not _ satisfy the four conditions of deductive arguments . he classifies them depending on which properties they satisfy , and then focuses on enthymemes",
    "enthymeme _ is a pair @xmath86 such that @xmath102 , but there is a set @xmath103 such that @xmath104 is a deductive argument .",
    "intuitively , @xmath105 represents some `` common knowledge '' that the agent supposes to be known by her opponents .",
    "then it is not useful for the agent to state the full deductive argument to be able to exchange information and to reach her goal ( persuading her opponent , helping to take a decision , negotiating , and so on ) .    to illustrate this concept , we borrow a simple example of real life use of enthymemes from @xcite",
    "let us consider john and his wife yoko , who is going outside without an umbrella .",
    "if john tells her `` you should take your umbrella , because the weather report predicts rain '' , there is no formal reason to consider that @xmath106 ( with @xmath107 and @xmath108 ) is an argument .",
    "it is in fact an enthymeme , because john supposes that @xmath109 is part of the knowledge he shares with yoko .",
    "one of the questions tackled in @xcite is `` how does the agent knows that @xmath105 is _ actually _ part of the common knowledge ? '' .",
    "hunter supposes that each agent has a way to evaluate the plausibility that a given formula will be part of the knowledge shared between her and another agent .    for each agent @xmath110",
    "whose beliefs are expressed in the propositional language @xmath111 ,    * @xmath112 denotes her own _ personal base _ , * and for each other agent @xmath113 , @xmath114 is a mapping from the language @xmath111 to @xmath115 $ ] , such that @xmath116 represents the certainty that @xmath3 is common to both agents @xmath110 and @xmath113 .

    "the idea is simply to keep only the formulae @xmath2 in the support such that the associated value @xmath117 is less than a given threshold @xmath118 ; the other ones can be omited because they are supposed to be known by agent @xmath113 .",
    "this process may lead to some problems in the exchange of arguments .",
    "there are at least two sources of mistakes .    1 .",
    "the mapping @xmath114 describes the _ perception _ that agent @xmath110 has of her common knowledge with @xmath113 .",
    "if this perception is wrong , then there could be some exchange of enthymemes that the agent @xmath113 can not decode accurately .",
    "2 .   even with a good evaluation of the common knowledge by @xmath114 , the choice of a bad threshold could also lead to enthymemes that the other agent can not decode .    in both these situations , agent @xmath113 receives some `` argument '' @xmath119",
    "which is not fully specified , and then she has to complete the support with some @xmath120 from her own belief base , which could of course lead to the addition of some attacks from an existing argument @xmath1 to this new argument @xmath0 , for instance if the claim of @xmath1 is the formula @xmath121 , for some @xmath122 . even if for low - level treatments , it can be represented as @xmath123 ( for instance to determine if possibly new incoming arguments attack it ) , at a higher level it is still the argument @xmath0 which is used .",
    "indeed , this @xmath124 is not an argument that @xmath113 has built by herself , since some of the premises are not part of her belief base .. ] then , agent @xmath113 can receive a new piece of information about the argument @xmath0 which is incompatible with the attack from @xmath1 to @xmath0 ( the simplest example being `` @xmath0 and @xmath1 should be accepted together '' ) .",
    "so she has to build a new internal state @xmath125 from a subset @xmath126 from her belief base ; for the same reason as previously , at a higher level it is still the argument @xmath0 originally built from agent @xmath110 s beliefs .",
    "+    [ [ enthymemes - with - partial - claim ] ] enthymemes with partial claim + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    we have seen that enthymemes are a way to communicate arguments with partial support .",
    "black and hunter also give some examples of enthymemes with a partial claim .",
    "borrowing their example , let us consider the sentence @xmath127 `` john has bought the times '' .",
    "the enthymeme @xmath128 can be interpreted in at least two ways , which lead to different claims :    1 .",
    "@xmath129 with @xmath130 `` john has bought a copy of the newspaper the times '' ; 2 .",
    "@xmath131 with @xmath132 `` john has bought the company which publishes the newspaper the times '' .",
    "similarly to what we have described for enthymemes with a partial support , if an agent receives an argument @xmath0 which is in fact an enthymeme with a partial claim , some mistakes in the attack relation can appear .",
    "for instance , she may consider that @xmath0 attacks an argument @xmath1 because some part of @xmath1 s support is conflicting with the completed claim ( either @xmath133 or @xmath134 in our example ) .",
    "if she later receives a piece of information which is not compatible with this attack , then she may have to consider a removal of this attack ( for instance , because the chosen claim is not accurate ) .",
    "+ so we can formally define the class of enthymemes ( with partial claims and partial supports ) as follows :    given @xmath135 a deductive argument , an approximate argument @xmath136 is an enthymeme for @xmath137 iff @xmath138 and @xmath139",
    ".    stated otherwise , the pair @xmath86 is an enthymeme for @xmath140 , with @xmath87 the partial support and @xmath3 the partial claim . in the rest of this paper , we call such a pair @xmath86 a _ non - completed enthymeme _ and @xmath140 a _ completed enthymeme_. a completed enthymeme may not satisfy the conditions stated in definition  [ def : deductive - arg ] , since the set of formulae @xmath87 comes from another agent s belief base .",
    "moreover , contrary to a fully specified argument stemming from the agent s beliefs , a completed enthymeme can be questioned .",
    "for several reasons , the use of an abstract af by the agent is interesting , even when she uses an underlying belief base .",
    "for instance , the developement of efficient approaches to solve abstract argumentation problems permits to obtain the conclusion of the agent s af with respect to several semantics and inference policies ( see for instance the competition of argumentation solvers @xcite ) . but to avoid the loss of information about the nature of arguments and attacks , we propose to refine the definition of the af .",

    "computing the extensions of such an af is identical to the process for classical dung s afs ; differentiating both kinds of attacks is useful only for the dynamics scenarios such as revision .    in this",
    "setting , each attack can be added or removed as soon as it concerns at least one enthymeme .",
    "we will refine this later .",
    "[ ex : enthymeme - based - af ] let @xmath148 be the enthymeme - based af presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : enthymeme - based - af ] .",

    "similarly , the dashed arrows represent the questionable attacks , while the other ones are the certain attacks . in this example",
    ", we suppose that the agent has received the enthymemes in the following way :    * @xmath149 , which has been completed by @xmath150 ; * @xmath151 , which has been completed by @xmath152 in the support and @xmath153 in the claim .    with this af ,",
    "the accepted arguments are @xmath154 .",
    "the existence of mistaken attacks in an enthymeme - based af can be tackled through some approaches of the _ dynamics of abstract argumentation _ @xcite . in the case when some arguments and the relations between them are certain ( in particular , when they are fully specified arguments instead of enthymemes ) , integrity constraints can simply be added to these revision / update / enforcement operators to ensure that forbidden attacks will not be added , and mandatory attacks will not be removed .",
    "since it is already defined by @xcite , we will exemplify the dynamics of argumentation with their _ constrained revision _ approach , presented previously .",
    "we can encode an integrity constraint to fix the attacks and non - attacks concerning the deductive arguments into the setting from @xcite .",
    "given @xmath155 an enthymeme - based af , the integrity constraint on deductive arguments is @xmath156    now , if the agent receives some piece of information about the arguments statuses or the attack relation , then she can use the af revision operator @xmath157 as defined previously in the case when this new piece of information disagrees with the current af .",
    "this revision operator guarantees that the relations between deductive arguments will not be modified during the revision process , which is desirable since they are directly stemming from the logical inference relation .",
    "ex : enthymeme - based - af we continue the previous example .",
    "the agent receives the piece of information `` @xmath158 should be accepted '' , which corresponds to the formula @xmath159 .",

    "the possible results are given in fig .",
    "[ fig : possible - results - revision ] .",
    "+    the exact _ change operator _ which should be used depends on the the properties expected for the process , for instance it is well - known that performing an update @xcite is accurate when the change is explained by an evolution of the world , while performing a revision @xcite is accurate when the evolution only concerns the agent s beliefs about the world ; thus these operations do not satisfy the same properties .",
    "similarly , among the different approaches in the state of the art about the dynamics of afs , each of them do not have the same expressivity .",
    "for instance , the revision approach described in @xcite permits to revise by a formula concerning the extensions , while the translation - based approach illustrated here permits to revise by a formula concerning skeptical acceptance of arguments and attacks at the same time .",
    "so , the choice of a change operator completely depends on the application and the agent s needs and preferences . in the following ,",
    "we continue to consider revision to be consistent with the previous example , but update and extension enforcement @xcite could be considered as well .      after obtaining the result of the revision process",
    ", the agent should now decode this result to determine which of the revised afs is the most plausible real af corresponding to her beliefs , and which enthymemes should be internally modified ( and _ how _ they should be internally modified ) to ensure that the abstract af and the logic - based af coincide .",

    "when the set of acceptable afs is not a singleton , we can consider two different solutions :    * the agent can keep the whole set as the result , to express the uncertainy of the result of the revision , as suggested by @xcite which consider that revising or updating an af can lead to a set of afs ; * the agent can use external information ( preferences between afs , preferences between formulae in the enthymemes , and so on ) to select a single acceptable af as the result .",
    "none of them is in general more desirable than the other one , the choice depends on the situation ( specific application , user s preferences , computational issues,@xmath170 ) .      in the previous parts , we suppose that each attack concerning an enthymeme is questionable .",
    "but we can be more precise in the definition of the enthymeme - based af .",
    "indeed , even when we consider an enthymeme @xmath171 , some of the attacks concerning it may be certain .",
    "we know that some parts of @xmath171 , that we have called previously the partial support and the partial claim , are fixed .",
    "if the reason of an attack between @xmath171 and a deductive argument is a logical conflict involving one of these fixed parts of @xmath171 , then this attack can be considered as certain .",
    "similarly , when we consider another enthymeme @xmath172 , if there is an attack between @xmath171 and @xmath172 which is stemming from the fixed part of @xmath171 and the fixed part of @xmath172 , then this attack can not be removed either .",
    "+ let us first formalize this notion of fixed part .",
    "if @xmath173 is a deductive argument or a non - completed enthymeme , then the _ fixed part _ of @xmath0 is @xmath174 .",
    "+ if @xmath175 is a completed enthymeme , then @xmath174 .",
    "so if we consider a fully specified deductive argument or a non - completed enthymeme , the fixed part is the set of all the formulae involved in it .",
    "but when we consider an enthymeme _ completed with the agent s beliefs _ , then the fixed part is the set of formulae which appear in the enthymeme that the agent has originally received , but do not appear in the completed version of it .",
    "ex : enthymeme - based - af let us consider again the arguments @xmath161 , @xmath162 , @xmath158 and @xmath168 .",
    "the fixed parts of the deductive arguments are trivially the union of their support and their claim .",
    "+ the result is more interesting for the enthymemes :    * @xmath176 ; * @xmath177 ;    now let us define the involved part of an argument in an attack .",
    "let @xmath173 and @xmath178 be two arguments ( deductive arguments , completed enthymemes or non - completed enthymemes ) .",
    "if there is an attack between @xmath0 and @xmath1 , then the _ involved part _ of @xmath0 in the conflict between @xmath0 and @xmath1 , denoted by @xmath179 , is the set @xmath180 such that @xmath181 and @xmath105 is minimal w.r.t .",
    "@xmath91 . otherwise , @xmath182 .",
    "so , if we have a rebuttal conflict between @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( meaning that the claims are the contradiction of each other ) then @xmath183 and @xmath184 .",
    "if the conflict is an undercut from @xmath0 to @xmath1 ( meaning that the claim @xmath3 of @xmath0 is conflicting with some part @xmath185 of the support of @xmath1 ) , then @xmath183 and @xmath186 .",
    "ex : enthymeme - based - af now we can see which parts of the arguments @xmath161 , @xmath162 , @xmath158 and @xmath168 are involved in conflicts .",
    "the certain attack @xmath187 comes from the contradiction between @xmath188 and @xmath189 , so @xmath190 and @xmath191 .",
    "concerning the questionable attacks , we have :    * @xmath192 and @xmath193 ; * @xmath194 and @xmath195 .",
    "now we can refine the definition of an enthymeme - based af .    given @xmath141 and @xmath142 which denote respectively the agent s deductive arguments and enthymemes , the agent s _ refined enthymeme - based af _",
    "is @xmath143 with    * @xmath144 ; * @xmath196 ; * @xmath197 : the set of certain attacks ; * @xmath198 : the set of questionable attacks .",
    "we use @xmath199 as a notation for @xmath200 , which is the set of attacks between deductive arguments .    of course ,",
    "if an argument is a fully specified deductive argument , then the part of it which is involved in conflicts is a fixed part .",
    "so to refine the af , we need to check if it is the case with the enthymemes .",
    "ex : enthymeme - based - af studying the relations between involved parts and fixed parts for the enthymemes @xmath158 and @xmath168 , we obtain the following :    * @xmath201 ; * @xmath202 .",
    "so none of the attacks @xmath203 and @xmath204 is certain .",
    "but we can exhibit more interesting cases , for which the use of a refined enthymeme - based af leads to another result than the basic enthymeme - based af .",
    "let @xmath205 be a deductive argument , and @xmath206 an enthymeme , which can be completed for instance by the additional support @xmath207 .",
    "+ it is easy to see here that @xmath208 , so the conflict between @xmath209 and @xmath210 is not questionable , and the af corresponding to these arguments is @xmath211 given in fig .",
    "[ fig : refined - af ] .",
    "\\(a ) @xmath212 ; ( b ) [ below of = a ] @xmath213 ;    \\(a ) edge[bend right ] ( b ) ( b ) edge[bend right ] ( a ) ;    when we consider these refined enthymeme - based afs in the revision process , the integrity constraint must be adapted to take into account each certain attack , and not only the ones between deductive arguments :    given @xmath155 a refined enthymeme - based af , the integrity constraint on certain attacks is @xmath214    this new constraint ensures that a certain attack will not be removed during the revision process , and that attacks between deductive arguments will not be added if they do not belong to the original af .      to conclude ,",
    "let us formalize the intuitive `` chomsky example '' , showing the different completions of enthymemes which lead to the different agents afs .",
    "we use the following propositional variables : @xmath215 means that the us army will retreat ; @xmath216 means that the * w*i*k*ileaks information about * r*etreat is true ; @xmath217 means that the * w*i*k*ileaks documents are * f*ake ; @xmath218 means that * m*edia can * n*ot be * t*rusted on military issues .",
    "as they are stated , the arguments @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath101 which are shared by the agents are these ones : @xmath219 all of them are enthymemes .",
    "for all the agents , the completion of @xmath101 is @xmath220 . but they disagree on the completion of the other enthymemes .",
    "agent @xmath98 considers that @xmath221 and @xmath222 .",
    "agent @xmath99 completes the enthymemes as follows : @xmath223 and @xmath224 .",
    "finally , agent @xmath100 uses these completions of enthymemes : @xmath225 and @xmath224 .",
    "these completions of enthymemes lead to the afs described in figure  [ fig : chomsky - example ] , with all arguments which are enthymemes , and all attacks which are questionable .",
    "so here , in case of a revision , the revision operator is used with the integrity constraint @xmath226 , which is equivalent to a revision without a constraint .",
    "+ we mentioned in the introduction two scenarios which require to use dynamics of argumentation techniques .",
    "first , we suppose that agent @xmath99 is considered to be trustworthy by other agents .",
    "then , when she says that @xmath101 should be accepted ( which is represented by the formula @xmath227 ) , the other agents have to revise their af with this new piece of information",
    ". the result of the revision for @xmath98 , with a corresponding completion of enthymemes which are modified because of the revision , is given in figure  [ fig : revision - chomsky - a1 ] .",
    "similarly , for @xmath100 , figure  [ fig : revision - chomsky - a3 ] describes the possible revised afs , with the modified enthymemes corresponding to it .    ' '' ''    finally , the other scenario was a vote on the acceptance status of @xmath101 .",
    "since the majority of agents rejects @xmath101 , @xmath99 has to revise her af by @xmath228 to find an agreement with the majority .",
    "possible results are described in figure  [ fig : revision - chomsky - a2 ] .    ' '' ''",
    "in this paper , we argue that , in realistic situations , agents do not share _ all _ their knowledge and beliefs .",
    "there are different possible reasons , among them , technical and strategical reasons seem to be the most intuitive explanations . also , implicit information is frequently used in natural language argumentation ( on social networks for instance ) .",
    "when this situation occurs , there is some uncertainty in the resulting argumentation frameworks built by the agents .",
    "it is likely that agents opinion about arguments meaning and relations between arguments will differ ; there may be some misunderstanding in the communication process which leads to mistakes in the generation of arguments and attacks . here ,",
    "this is formalized with the use of enthymemes , instead of deductive arguments , to represent the uncertain nature of some arguments .",
    "for this reason , the reception of a new piece of information ( supposed to be reliable ) can force the agents to question the current attack relation to obtain a result which is compatible with the new piece of information .",
    "we have described formally how the use of enthymemes in the argumentation process can lead to the existence of these mistaken attacks , and how to define an argumentation framework which makes the distinction between the certain attacks and the questionable attacks .",
    "then , we have seen that the existing works on the dynamics of abstract afs can be used to perform a change on an enthymeme - based af when it is required to incorporate a new piece of information . here , we exemplify it with the translation - based revision from @xcite , but it can be adapted to any revision , update or enforcement approach as soon as it is possible to consider an integrity constraint on the attack relation . +",
    "this paper only presents some preliminary work on this question .",
    "many future works can be envisioned .",
    "first , we want to model the uncertainty by other means than enthymemes . for instance , using weights could lead to the definition of original change operators which define the notion of minimal change w.r.t . these weights ; it would then be more expensive to change a single attack which has a high weight than to change several attacks with low weights .",
    "determining what can be the origin of these weights is particularly interesting . combined with the use of enthymemes",
    ", we think that giving a low weight to an attack which is easy to modify ( because there are many possible completions of enthymemes in the belief base ) is an interesting way to tackle the problem . for the eafs defined in this paper , as well as the weighted approach",
    "mentioned above , several questions are opened .",
    "we have made the simplifying hypothesis that the agents will have some possible completion of arguments at their disposal , which is not always the case in real world situations .",
    "similarly , the revision operators may lead to an empty - set of results ( because of the integrity constraint ) , or on the opposite , to a non - singleton set of results .",
    "all these cases must be investigated to ensure the possibility of some practical applications .",
    "the complexity of revising such framework , compared to the original revision approach in the abstract setting , will also be studied to be able to identify which approaches can be used for real applications .",
    "we also plan to use some of the existing pieces of software for the dynamics of afs ( in particular the one described in @xcite for extension enforcement ) , to study the scalability of the approaches on practical examples .",
    "but it requires first an important work to build argumentation graphs from logical knowledge - bases , since the existing works focus only on argumentation trees @xcite .",
