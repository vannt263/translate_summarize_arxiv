    "since their discovery in 1977 , the @xmath4 resonances have provided a unique laboratory for the study of strong interactions ( qcd ) , while the @xmath5 resonance provides a clean source of @xmath6 mesons which are used to probe the weak interaction .",
    "the analyses reported on here make use of approximately 20@xmath710@xmath8 @xmath3 , 9@xmath710@xmath8 @xmath1 , and @xmath9 @xmath2 decays recorded using the cleo iii detector at cesr .",
    "the analyses also utilize 0.2 @xmath10 , 0.4 @xmath10 and 0.2 @xmath10 of data taken just below the @xmath3 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 resonances ( _ ie . , continuum _ ) , respectively .",
    "the @xmath4 resonances have provided a fertile testing ground for both lattice qcd and qcd - inspired potential models . of particular interest",
    "are the total widths of these resonances , @xmath11 , which can be related to the muonic branching fraction , @xmath12 via @xmath13 , where the electronic decay width , @xmath14 , can be obtained from the integrated resonant cross - section for @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath16 also enters into the determination of other @xmath4 branching fraction measurements , and therefore may present a limiting systematic uncertainty .",
    "cleo is now in a position to provide a much improved measurement of @xmath12  @xcite .",
    "the branching fraction @xmath12 can be extracted by measuring the efficiency - corrected ratio : @xmath17 , which is related to @xmath12 through @xmath18 .",
    "dimuon events are selected by requiring exactly two nearly back - to - back charged tracks ( @xmath19 ) with energy @xmath20 in the range @xmath21 , one which must be detected in the muon system .",
    "hadronic events are selected by requiring @xmath22 , with additional requirements on the energy in the calorimeter when @xmath23 .",
    "the number of dimuon ( hadronic ) events surviving all analysis requirements are @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) , @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) , and @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) for @xmath3 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 , respectively . event selection and analysis requirement efficiencies",
    "are determined from simulation and are 65% ( 96 - 98% ) for the dimuon ( hadronic ) event selection .",
    "backgrounds are estimated using simulation and are below 3% for the dimuon samples and less than 1% for the hadronic samples .",
    "the branching fractions are found to be : @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , where the first uncertainty is statistical and the second systematic .",
    "the @xmath3 measurement is consistent with previous measurements , but the @xmath1 and @xmath2 are larger by 2 - 3 standard deviations .",
    "these latter two measurements provide factor of 2 - 3 improvement in the precision to which these branching fractions are known while the @xmath3 result is by itself competitive with the world average .",
    "measurements of the radiative decays of the @xmath4 resonances provide clues into the nature of the strong force and provides for unique tests of potential models and lattice qcd .",
    "for example , the electric dipole transition rate , @xmath33 can be determined experimentally , and can in turn be used to extract the corresponding matrix element . the matrix elements and the mass splittings",
    "can be used to learn about the contributing spin - orbit and tensor interactions  @xcite .    the events for this analysis  @xcite use the same hadronic event selection as in the @xmath12 analysis .",
    "radiative transitions are observed through their peaks in the inclusive photon energy spectrum .",
    "photon candidates are required to be isolated from all charged particles and have a shower profile consistent with an electromagnetic shower .",
    "the predominant source of background arises from @xmath34 decay .",
    "application of a @xmath35 veto for low energy photons does not improve the signal significance due to accidental combinations where the signal photon and a random photon have an invariant mass near the @xmath35 mass .",
    "consequently , the @xmath35 veto is not applied to the @xmath36 and @xmath37 analyses . on the other hand ,",
    "a @xmath35 veto is applied to the @xmath38 analysis , where the photon energies are much higher and accidental combinatorial losses are much smaller .    the inclusive photon spectrum for @xmath1 data is shown in fig .  [ fig : y2s_1p ] .",
    "the top figure shows the data ( points ) and overlayed are the fits to the data ( solid line ) and the background contribution ( dashed line ) .",
    "the lower plot shows the background subtracted peaks along with the fit ( solid line ) and the contributions from the individual @xmath39 states ( dashed line ) .",
    "the background is determined using a combination of continuum and @xmath3 data .",
    "the analogous distributions for @xmath2 data are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : y3s_2p ] . in both cases ,",
    "large signals are observed for each of the transitions .",
    "the yields , efficiencies , branching fractions and photon energies are summarized in table  [ tab : upsrad ] .",
    "the branching fraction measurements are by themselves about a factor of two better than the world average values . using the inclusive photon spectrum , we also observe the rare transition , @xmath40 , which is found to have a branching fraction of @xmath41 .",
    "this is the first measurement of this transition rate .    [",

    "one of the longstanding problems in qcd has been to understand the production mechanism for charmonium in a glue - rich environment . to account for the large excess of charmonium observed at the tevtron ,",
    "an additional color - octet mechanism  @xcite was proposed whereby a @xmath42 pair is produced in a color - octet state , and then evolves non - perturbatively into a color - singlet .",
    "the matrix element for the latter was determined as to account for the deficit .",
    "it has been suggested that the study of @xmath43 production in three - gluon decays of @xmath4 provides a unique opportunity to test color - octet predictions .",
    "the most dramatic expectation is a peaking of the @xmath43 momentum spectrum near the kinematic endpoint .",
    "a second mechanism which can also produce @xmath43 in @xmath4 decay is the color - singlet process , @xmath44 , which is inherently soft and should yield two additional open charm particles .",
    "events used in this analysis  @xcite are required to pass standard hadronic event selection . in order to suppress background from radiative return ( @xmath45 )",
    ", we reject events which have @xmath46 and either a detected photon with momentum greater than 3.75 gev / c , or an event momentum imbalance of larger than 2 gev / c .",
    "candidates @xmath43 s are reconstructed in the @xmath47 and @xmath48 modes .",
    "in addition to standard track selection criteria , muons are required to be detected in the muon system .",
    "electrons are required to deposit energy in the calorimeter which is consistent with its measured momentum .",
    "the invariant mass distributions for @xmath47 and @xmath48 candidates are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mass_1s ] . the continuum contribution ( @xmath49 )",
    "is estimated using data taken on and below the @xmath5 .",
    "this contribution is added to the expected @xmath50 contribution , and the total subtracted from the on-@xmath3 data .",
    "the resulting scaled momentum distributions for @xmath47 and @xmath48 in @xmath3 decays are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : x_spec ] .",
    "the data are compared to predictions of the color - octet ( solid curve ) and color - singlet ( dashed curve ) .",
    "the data are much softer than the color - octet predictions and moderately softer than the color - singlet predictions . in the latter case , the effects of fragmentation of the recoiling charm into @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , etc",
    "is not taken into account and is expected to further soften the spectrum . integrating the spectrum , we measure a branching fraction @xmath55 .",
    "this measurement is consistent with predictions of both the color - octet and color - singlet models which predict branching fractions of @xmath56 and @xmath57 , respectively .",
    "we have also made a first observation of the decay , @xmath58 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : psi2s ] ) and found evidence for @xmath59 .",
    "the branching fractions are measured relative to @xmath60 , and are found to be : @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 at 90% confidence level .",
    "the feed - down contributions to @xmath43 are about a factor of two higher than expected .",
    "these measurements have the potential to shed some additional light on the production mechanisms of charmonium in glue - rich environments .",

    "i also thank the national science foundation and the u.s . dept . of energy for their support of this research ."
