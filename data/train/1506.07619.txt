    "in the past decades , control of multiple - input - multiple - output ( mimo ) practical systems has attracted a great deal of attention , such as flying robots ( @xcite ) , biped robots ( @xcite ) and underwater vehicle ( @xcite ) . to characterize certain non - sensitivity for small control inputs of these mimo systems , dead - zone nonlinearities have to be considered otherwise it can severely limit system performances , even leading to instability . to handle dead - zone nonlinearities ,",
    "many control approaches have been developed in the literature such as ( @xcite ) and ( @xcite ) .",
    "on the other hand , time - delay usually can be encountered in these mimo systems , dealt with by many authors , e.g. , ( @xcite ) and references therein .",
    "time - delay , like the dead - zone nonlinearities , can also degrade the system performances or lead to instability if ignored during the course of controller designs .",
    "given the effects of the dead - zone and time - delay , this paper considers a class of nonlinearly parameterized mimo dynamic systems where time - varying delay and unknown nonlinear dead - zone are simultaneously taken into accounts .    to the considered problem in this paper ,",
    "the most relevant papers are ( @xcite ) , ( @xcite ) , ( @xcite ) , ( @xcite ) and ( @xcite ) . in ( @xcite ) , an adaptive neural control was proposed for a class of uncertain mimo nonlinear state time - varying delay systems with unknown nonlinear dead - zones and gain signs , however , it only guarantees semiglobal stability of the closed - loop system . both ( @xcite ) and ( @xcite ) used the backstepping techniques to construct the controllers . however , the backstepping procedure is computationally time - consuming due to the computation of many virtual controllers for the mimo systems .",
    "the authors of ( @xcite ) proposed a decentralized controller for large - scale systems with time - delay and dead - zone nonlinearities .",
    "however , in ( @xcite ) , the time - delay is constant and the parameters of the dead - zone are known . in ( @xcite ) the authors constructed a novel lyapunov function and then designed a smooth adaptive state feedback controller for the time - delay system with dead - zone input .",
    "however , linear dead - zone was considered and the tracking error can converge only within an adjustable region . thus one may wonder if it is possible to propose a new control method completely different from those existing ones to overcome these disadvantages mentioned above ? this paper provides an affirmative answer by introducing a new high dimensional integral functional as a lyapunov - krasovskii function of the closed - loop systems .    from the motivation above and following our previous work ( @xcite ) , this paper introduces a new high dimensional integral lyapunov - krasovskii functional for a class of nonlinearly parameterized mimo systems with time - varying delay in states and unknown nonlinear dead - zones to achieve its tracking control .",
    "compared to the existing results , the main contributions of this paper are : i ) by proposing a lyapunov - based adaptive control structure , neither cancelation of the coupling matrix during linearizing the system nor conventional backstepping techniques is needed ; ii ) by introducing a new high - dimensional integral lyapunov function in the control design , the process of controller design is simplified , i.e. , it is unnecessary to calculate the inverse of the unknown control gain matrix ; iii ) by the construction of the lyapunov - krasovskii functional , the unknown time - varying delay in the upper bounding function of the lyapunov functional derivative can be easily eliminated ; iv ) the developed control strategy is applied to a 2-dof robotic manipulator system and the comparative simulation studies demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method .",
