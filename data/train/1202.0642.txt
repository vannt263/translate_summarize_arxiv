    "we start from a more general hamiltonian than that given in eq .",
    "( 2 ) of the manuscript .",
    "this kind of generic hamiltonian has been already used previously , to describe a wire in the presence of majorana fermions overlapping between each other .",
    "see for example refs .   or  .",
    "we then write , @xmath77 in contrast to eq .",
    "( 2 ) , we assume that the overlap @xmath78 between the different sides of the junction can be in general different , which is something that is more similar to a real system .",
    "besides , we simplify the notation by using @xmath79 .",
    "in this situation it is useful to switch to a representation where two majorana fermions are combined to form one ordinary fermion .",
    "thus , performing the substitutions @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and @xmath83 , we obtain @xmath84 where @xmath85 and @xmath86 counts the occupation of the corresponding state .",
    "we rewrite the former hamiltonian in the base of occupation @xmath87 , that is @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 , yielding the matrix @xmath92 we diagonalize the resulting hamiltonian and obtain 4 eigenvalues @xmath93 where the super index denotes even ( e ) and odd ( o ) fermion parity respectively . assuming that the parity is conserved we can choose one of the eigenvalues and make landau - zener transitions between the @xmath94 eigenvalues .",
    "in fact , we are only interested in the generic features which an avoided crossing has on the shapiro steps . thus we replace either @xmath95 by a characteristic / generic value @xmath96 which directly leads to eq .",
    "( 3 ) . we have included a footnote in the manuscript making this explicit .",
    "note furthermore that the signs of @xmath97 are random , i.e. , determined by microscopic details .",
    "thus , it is not true that the odd sector has a smaller gap than the even sector as one might naively expect when looking at the equations above .",
    "in the main text we have used the approximation of neglecting interference effects coming from having two or more non - adiabatic transitions @xcite . in this appendix",
    "we justify this approximation and estimate the dephasing rate produced by biasing the phase difference by means of a fluctuating voltage . for the sake of simplicity",
    "we restrict the analysis to the infinite length 1d josephson junction which in the pseudo - spin basis is given by @xmath98 where @xmath99 denotes the _ z_-pauli matrix . as we have explained , the effect of fixing the current produces thermal fluctuations in the voltage , therefore fluctuations on the phase difference arise around some fixed value @xmath100 , namely @xmath101 .",
    "then , we assume that these fluctuations are small compared with @xmath100 , so we can rewrite the hamiltonian approximately @xmath102 thus , the energy difference between the states fluctuates in time . in order to see the effects of these fluctuations",
    "one can take a coherent superposition such as @xmath103 where @xmath104 are the eigenstates of @xmath99 .",
    "the state at time t is given by @xmath105 where we have used @xmath106 to denote the constant energy difference between the states @xmath104 .",
    "the phase @xmath107 accounts the time integral over the fluctuating component of the energy difference @xmath108 these fluctuations are seen in the expectation value @xmath109 taking the average over the fluctuating phase we observe a decay of the oscillations @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the time integral of the autocorrelation function . obtaining this integral allows us to determine lifetime of the coherences . in order to calculate it we have first to relate phase and voltage autocorrelation functions through the josephson formula @xmath112 so that we can express the phase correlation function in terms of the voltage correlation function",
    "can be written as @xmath113 since the voltage fluctuations fulfill the nyquist theorem , we can write @xmath114 where t is the temperature that affects to the external circuit , and r is its corresponding resistance . leading to the result @xmath115 where we have used @xmath116 due to the fact that the time needed to vary the phase by @xmath22 is of the order of @xmath117 and @xmath43hz , and taking into account that for the parameters that we have considered ( see caption of fig .  3 in the main text )",
    "@xmath118 , coherences become rapidly quenched .",
    "the current that results of having lzt has the form of the continuous line shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.current ] .",
    "however , from time to time the lzt does not occur , thus , the current suffers changes in its periodicity .",
    "the consequences of varying the periodicity of the current is reflected on the shapiro steps pattern .",
    "it leads to the splitting of the steps see fig  [ fig.appsplitting ] . in order to have some analytical insight to this phenomena",
    ", we use a fourier expansion of the current and of the non - lzt .",
    "we begin calculating the fourier components of the current when lzt are always given .",
    "we make an odd expansion leading to the terms @xmath119 where the fourier components are given by @xmath120 \\sin\\left(\\frac{n}{2}\\varphi\\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here sgn denotes the sign function and the current @xmath37 is given by    dynamical 4@xmath3 current ( solid ) in a josephson junction after having two consequtive lzt .",
    "dahsed curve corresponds to the opposite case , i.e.  two consequtive non - lzt.,width=288 ]    @xmath121    where @xmath12 is the overlap between the in - phase mf and @xmath6 is the josephson energy .",
    "the integral is zero for @xmath122 yielding just the odd fourier contributions .",
    "taking into account that @xmath13 , we take the first order ( taylor ) expanssion in @xmath12 , yielding @xmath123 this leads to write the current as , @xmath124 as expected , the current has a @xmath0 contribution proportional to @xmath6 perturbed by a sum of extra terms which are of the order of @xmath12 .",
    "we represent the phenomenon of not having lzt in a different way as it is presented in the main text . there , having a lzt was simulated by a change of sign .",
    "indeed , this has been already included in the fourier expansion above eq .",
    "[ eq.if ] , and for this reason here having a non - lzt will be simulated by changing as well the sign of the current . to this aim",
    "we will use a unit - step that changes its sign after a certain period , which depends on the average of the lz probability .    in the calculations we perform in the main text ,",
    "this effect is estimated stochastically . in turn , here we consider the average of a given lzt and non - lzt .",
    "since a lzt is not affected by a previous phase , this approximation will be in principle accurate .",
    "thus , we consider the averaged lz probability @xmath33 , namely , in average after a number lzt there is a non - lzt",
    ". the next approximation will be to consider that these non - lzt are distributed homogenously in time .",
    "this approximation , is a bit more fragile , due to the fact that we are measuring the periodicity of the current by the position of the shapiro steps .",
    "thus , to consider a homogeneous distribution or an inhomogeneous one will lead to different results in the experiment . in principle , the homogeneous distribution will be only appropiated when the non - lzt are separated enough in time , so that the periodicity of the 4@xmath3 current ( eq .  [ eq.if ] ) dominates .",
    "in addition , the function has to include the fact that the change of sign can only come at certain values of the phase , i.e.  when @xmath125 .",
    "then , it is straightforward to obtain the period as @xmath126 where @xmath127\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and therefore the fourier expansion becomes @xmath128    current / voltage curves for different values of @xmath72 : ( a ) 500 , ( b ) 100 , ( c ) 50 and ( d ) 30 , @xmath73na , the rest of the parameters are taken from those used in fig  3 in the main text .",

[ fig.appsplitting ] ) .",
    "we can also see that the average model deviates from the stochastic calculations as we increase @xmath12 .",
    "this is caused because increasing @xmath12 , the number of non - lzt increases so that non - lzt may not occur isoletely , changing thus the periodicity .",
    "therefore , for lower lz probabilities the average between the pure 2@xmath3 and 4@xmath3 currents weighted by @xmath33 give more accurate results .",
    "it is worthy to remark that the fourier current presented above , has been developed to show analyticaly the splitting , however , numerical results of the averaged model have been obtained from the current given by @xmath131",
    "the shapiro experiment has been proposed @xcite to detect the presence of majorana fermions because it allows to deduce the periodicity of the current - phase relation of the junction , and therefore to distinguish between majorana and normal modes , whose current is proportional to @xmath2 , and @xmath1 respectively .",
    "the physical fundament of the experiment consists of a resonance phenomena which involves the natural frequency of the majorana ( normal ) josephson junction @xmath132 and the frequency of an applied rf current ( voltage ) @xmath54 .",
    "when the resonance is fulfilled , i.e.  @xmath133 , shapiro steps arise .",
    "we can now see that shapiro steps coming from a majorana mode arise just at even multiples of the applied ac frequency , while normal modes appear at the whole spectrum of integer multiples , see fig .",
    "[ fig.shapiroapp ] .    in practice , to distinguish the presence of a majorana mode is expected to be more complicated due to the presence of both , normal and majorana modes , presenting a higher contribution the former one . in this scenario",
    ", shapiro steps should appear at even and odd positions .",
    "however , in the main text we have found a regime in the current biased experiment where the majorana mode can give rise to even steps in the presence of a much higher 2@xmath3 contribution to the current .",
    "this section is dedicated to explain the reason of this behavior .",
    "the structure of this section consists of two parts . in the first one we present briefly the voltage biased experiment , while in the second we analyze in more extension the current biased experiment .",
    "the second part is divided in two subsections where we analyze the numerical results of the rsj model in the absence and presence of majorana and with and without ac current .",

    "on the other hand , the phase difference is given by the josephson formula @xmath136 this means that applying an external ac - voltage @xmath137 we will be able to tune the phase difference , leading to @xmath138 here we have used @xmath139 .",
    "then , we substitute eq .",
    "( [ eq : phaset ] ) into the josephson current eq .",
    "( [ eq : josephcurr ] ) @xmath140 thus , in the stationary limit just the contributions with @xmath141 survive , namely @xmath142 with dirac deltas placed at integer values of the radio frequency , @xmath143 .",
    "it has to be noted that the contribution of the normal and majorana modes is linear in @xmath144 , and for this reason the height of the even steps will be sligthly modified by the presence of the majorana mode in the case that @xmath67 .",
    "therefore , we can understand that the presence of the normal andreev modes , which contributes with steps placed at all integer multiples , will difficult the separation of both contributions and thus the identification of the majorana mode .",
    "for this reason , in the situation where @xmath67 , the voltage biased experiment seems to be a non - sensitive method to detect the majorana mode .",
    "in the main text we have performed numerical calculations for the current biased shapiro experiment .",
    "we have presented i - v curves for different values of @xmath54 and seen that for some special regime of frequencies odd steps vanish , pointing out the 4@xmath3 periodicity of the junction . in this section",
    "we give numerical arguments to explain this phenomena . in order to simplify the discussion we will study the ideal case , where the majorana fermions at the extremes of the quantum wire are infinitely apart from the junction ,",
    "so that the overlap is zero and the supercurrent becomes proportional to @xmath2 .",
    "in this situation the equation under study is @xmath145 this equation is obtained from kirchoff s law where an external dc @xmath28 and ac @xmath29 currents are applied to the junction .",
    "the outgoing current is modeled by a parallel circuit whose components are , @xmath30 , given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : josephcurr ] ) , and a resistive current @xmath146 originating from the existence of quasiparticles .    in order to analyze the equation it results convenient to renormalize the involved parameters .",
    "therefore , we divide the entire equation by @xmath38 , and transform the time to a dimensionless quantity @xmath147 .",
    "this provokes a renormalization on the ac frequency @xmath148 , leading to rewrite the equation as @xmath149 where the renormalized intensities are given by @xmath150 .",
    "now , the analysis of the equation is reduced to the study the parameter regime of @xmath151 , and @xmath152 .",
    "the analytic solution of the equation in the absence of the majorana mode is not known , and only approximate solutions have been obtained @xcite , although none of them are valid in the regime where we observe that odd steps vanish . besides , the 4@xmath3 term coming from the presence of the majorana mode makes the system even more complicated .",
    "for all these reasons , it is out of the scope of this appendix to try to give an analytical insigth of the differential equations . in turn",
    ", we explore the numerical solutions and explain its general behavior .",

    "the value @xmath158 is called the critical value , which we denote by @xmath159 , and is defined as the value up to which the induced voltage passes from zero to a finite value . in general , this value will change depending on whether we add the majorana mode and/or the ac current .",
    "this value will be important in the incoming analysis .      in panel",
    "a of figs .",
    "[ fig.4pi ] and  [ fig.4pia0 ] we show numerical results of @xmath161 and @xmath162 as a function of time for two different values of @xmath155 .",
    "figure  [ fig.4pi ] presents values of @xmath155 close to the critical value of each system , while fig .",
    "[ fig.4pia0 ] presents a higher value of @xmath155 .",
    "as we can observe , @xmath161 presents two different ranges of slopes , i.e. velocities , fast and slow .",
    "the slow range is given when the term @xmath163 , so that the difference @xmath164 is minimum .",
    "this happens when @xmath165 ( dashed lines of panels a and b of figs .",
    "[ fig.4pi ] and  [ fig.4pia0 ] ) . in figure  [ fig.4pi",
    "] @xmath155 is very close to @xmath159 , thus the difference @xmath166 , and therefore we find a flat slope . for larger values of @xmath155 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig.4pia0 ] ) the difference does not tend to zero and we observe an increment of the slope between stairs . in the bottom plot of figs .",
    "[ fig.4pi ] and  [ fig.4pia0 ] we show results of @xmath167 vs. time .",
    "there we can observe that the increment of @xmath155 induces a widening of the peaks .",
    "on the other hand , the fast range is given for the rest of the values of @xmath161 , having a maximum speed when @xmath168 which occurs at @xmath169 .",
    "these ranges are periodically repeated with the frequency @xmath170 in units of @xmath171 .",
    "that is , the frequency of the junction is proportional to the induced voltage . in summary , by increasing @xmath155 we modify the frequency of the junction @xmath172 , and we also provoke an increment of the slope between stairs , which produces a widening of the peaks seen in @xmath162 .",
    "we add now the majorana mode by including the term @xmath173 to the supercurrent yielding @xmath174 with @xmath175 . in the example presented here",
    "we have used the value @xmath176 , so that the sum of this term modifies slightly @xmath1 . however , as we can observe in panel c of fig .",

    "fig.4pi]c ) and becomes 2@xmath3 for larger values of @xmath155 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig.4pia0]c ) .",
    "this effect is non - linear and makes a difference respect to the voltage biased experiment .",
    "the change in the periodicity can be explained by means of analogous arguments as above .",
    "the addition of the majorana mode may increase or decrease the duration of the flat regions depending on the sign of @xmath179 .",
    "the time difference between the short and long periods increases as long as we are closer to the critical value @xmath159 .",
    "thus , the 2@xmath3 periodic function turns to a 4@xmath3 periodic one as @xmath180 , still with the characteristic frequency @xmath172 .",

    "<S> we have calculated two different cases , when there are no extra 2@xmath3 modes , i.e.  @xmath44 , we have obtained that we can always determine the presence of the majorana mode due to the appearance of steps at even multiples of the ac frequency @xmath54 ( see fig .

    "<S> we have found that it is possible to match this range , and therefore its 4@xmath3 behavior , by using ac frequencies of the order of @xmath76hz ( see fig .  </S>",
