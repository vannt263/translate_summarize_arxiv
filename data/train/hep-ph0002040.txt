    "violation of time reversal invariance was discovered more then 30 years ago in @xmath2 meson decay @xcite . up to",
    "now it remains one of the great unsolved problems in elementary particle physics .",
    "many experiments were devoted to the search of any other manifestation of time reversal noninvariance . among them",
    "for example are measurements of electrical dipole moment ( edm ) of neutrons @xcite , atoms and molecules @xcite .",
    "no edm was found but these experiments impose strong restrictions on theory",
    ". in particular search of edm in heavy atoms set a tight limits on parameters of electron - nucleon @xmath3 violating interactions and value of electron edm .    at present more precise schemes of experiment",
    "are actively discussed .",
    "one of them is the observation of the light polarization plane rotation caused by pseudo - zeeman splitting of magnetic sub - levels of atom with nonzero edm in electric field .",
    "this effect arises due to interaction @xmath4 of atomic edm with external electric field @xcite .",
    "we should note here that discussions of these experiments @xcite take into account only static edm of atom .",
    "according to @xcite atom has another @xmath3 noninvariant characteristic that describes its response to the external electric field .",
    "it is a @xmath5 and @xmath6 - odd polarizability @xmath7 that arises in electric field due to interference of @xmath3 - odd and stark - induced transition amplitudes .",
    "as was shown in @xcite @xmath3 - odd polarizability also leads to the rotation of photon polarization plane and circular dichroism of atomic gas in external electric field .",
    "this contribution should exist even in a hypothetical case when atomic edm in a ground and excited states are occasionally equal to zero and pseudo - zeeman splitting of atomic levels is absent .",
    "unlike rotation of polarization plane due to atomic edm that manifest macaluso - corbino dependence of angle on light frequency , rotation caused by @xmath7 is a kinematic analog of faraday rotation in a van - vleck paramagnetic .",

    "this splitting appears even if atomic edm @xmath11 is equal to zero .    in this paper",
    "the mechanisms of rotation of polarization plane of light due to both @xmath3 noninvariant electron - nucleon interactions and nonzero electron edm are considered .",

    "possible experimental schemes to observe this rotation are discussed .",
    "we start with the simplest case .",
    "let us place an atom in a ground state @xmath13 to the electric field . if we take into account admixture of the nearest @xmath14 state due to @xmath5 and @xmath6 odd interactions and interaction with the electric field , then the wave function of atom takes the form .",

    "only terms proportional to the product of electrical field strength @xmath22 and @xmath3 odd mixing coefficient @xmath20 are important for our consideration because only they cause @xmath3 - odd rotation of polarization plane of light .",
    "the change of spin direction due to these terms is @xmath23 the vector field @xmath24 is shown in fig .",
    "since @xmath25 does not depend on initial direction of atomic spin , this spin structure appears even in non - polarized atom .",
    "let us note that the spin vector averaged over spatial variables differs from zero and is directed along the vector of electric field strength @xmath22 .",
    "the photons with directions of angular moment parallel and antiparallel to the electric field will interact with such spin structure in a different ways causing rotation of polarization plane of light .",

    "this allow us to distinguish @xmath3 - odd rotation from the other possible mechanisms of rotation of polarization plane .",
    "refraction index of gas has both real and imaginary parts .",

    "this angle is three orders of magnitude greater than one caused by atomic edm for this transition .",
    "angle of polarization plane rotation can be significantly greater for other atoms , for example rare - earth elements , where additional amplification goes from close levels of opposite parity .",
    "the interesting example is the transition @xmath271 , ( @xmath272 ) in @xmath273 @xcite , where the value of @xmath3 odd angle can be two orders of magnitude higher then for cesium due to larger @xmath3 noninvariant amplitude .",
    "therefore we can hope that experimental measurement of described phenomenon can achieve sensitivity in measurements of parameters of @xmath3 noninvariant interactions between electron and nucleus and electron edm , comparable with the current atomic edm experiments ."
