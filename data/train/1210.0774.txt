    "the potential energy is thus @xmath5 in which @xmath6 is the spring constant . besides the heavily studied linear polymer chains",
    "there are many other types of polymers whose dynamics deserve closer inspection . in this paper",
    "we concern ourselves with the dynamics of bead - spring chains that have the topology of a symmetric star ( with @xmath0 arms ) and tadpoles .",
    "further , in the context of bead - spring models , the rouse model for linear phantom chains @xcite deserves a special mention . in the rouse model",
    "the dynamics of the beads is formulated in the overdamped limit , with a solvent with viscous drag coefficient @xmath7 , and with thermal forces @xmath8 on the @xmath3-th bead , such that the dynamical equations of motion become @xmath9 here , the thermal forces are delta - correlated , namely @xmath10 with boltzmann constant @xmath11 and temperature @xmath12 .",
    "the reason why , to date , the rouse model deserves a special mention , lies in the fact that it allows full analytical calculations of virtually any dynamical quantity . rather than the equations of motion for the individual beads ,",

    "the quantities of interest for a phantom chain can be analytically tracked by reconstructing them from the modes @xcite .    using the definition of rouse modes it has been shown in recent works that the dynamics of a tagged bead in a linear bead - spring model is described by the generalized langevin equation ( gle ) @xcite , and that the dynamics of polymers with steric repulsion ( also known as self - avoiding polymer chains ) @xcite , as well as of those in melts",

    "here we show that for a symmetric star polymer with a special central bead the dynamical eigenmodes can indeed be written down exactly , and subsequently the dynamical behavior of many interesting physical quantities can be determined precisely . for simplicity , in commensuration with the rouse model , henceforth we term these dynamical eigenmodes as rouse modes .",

    "although from the synthesis process it is realistic that the core has a significantly higher hydrodynamic radius , the choice in our simplified model to make hydrodynamic radius of the central bead exactly @xmath0 times as the other beads is motivated by our strive to determine the rouse modes exactly . for modestly - sized chains , where the hydrodynamic radius of the core is not @xmath0 times",
