    "a problem of considerable importance in low temperature physics concerns physical limitations on how small a temperature can be well defined in the laboratory[1 ] . in what follows ,",
    "we shall consider temperature fluctuations which define a system temperature `` uncertainty '' @xmath3 whenever a finite system at temperature @xmath4 is in thermal contact with a large reservoir at bath temperature @xmath5 . only on the thermodynamic average",
    "do we expect the system temperature to be equal to the bath temperature ; i.e. @xmath6 . the fluctuation from this average result ( quoted in the better textbooks discussing statistical thermodynamics[2 ] ) , has the magnitude @xmath7 where @xmath1 is the heat capacity of the finite system , and @xmath8 is boltzman s constant .",
    "since @xmath1 is an extensive thermodynamic quantity , one expects the usual small fluctuation in temperature @xmath9 in the thermodynamic limit @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the number of microscopic particles .",
    "however , in low temperature physics ( for systems with finite values for @xmath11 ) , temperature fluctuations are by no means required to be negligible .    for those finite sized systems which obey the thermodynamic third law @xmath12 one finds from eqs.(1.2 ) and ( 1.3 ) that @xmath13 eq.(1.4 ) sets the limits on what can be regarded as the ultimate lowest temperatures for finite thermodynamic systems ; i.e. the temperature must at least obey @xmath14 .    in sec.ii , the theoretical foundations for eq.(1.4 )",
    "will be discussed . in brief , the micro - canonical entropy of a thermodynamic system is given by @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the number of system quantum states with energy @xmath17 .",
    "the micro - canonical entropy defines the _ system temperature _ @xmath4 via @xmath18 the _ thermal bath temperature _ @xmath5 , which is not quite the system temperature @xmath4 , enters into the canonical free energy @xmath19 where the partition function is defined as @xmath20    the probability distribution for the energy of the system , when in contact with a thermal bath at temperature @xmath5 , is given by @xmath21 as dictated by gibbs .",
    "thus , the temperature @xmath5 ( of the thermal bath ) does not fluctuate while system energy @xmath17 does fluctuate according to the probability rule of eq.(1.9 ) . on the other hand , the system temperature @xmath22 in eq.(1.6 )",
    "depends on the system energy and thereby fluctuates since @xmath17 fluctuates .",
    "it is only for the energy @xmath23 of maximum probability @xmath24 that the system temperature is equal to the bath temperature @xmath25 .",
    "if the energy probability distribution is spread out at low thermal bath temperatures , then temperature fluctuations are well defined in the canonical ensemble of gibbs .    in sec.iii ,",
    "temperature fluctuations are illustrated using the example of black body radiation in a cavity of volume @xmath26 .",
    "for this case , it turns out that the thermal wave length @xmath27 of the radiation in the cavity , @xmath28 must be small on the scale of the cavity length @xmath29 ; i.e. @xmath30 .",
    "for example , in a cavity of volume @xmath31 , the lowest temperature for the radiation within the cavity is of order @xmath32 .",
    "it is of course possible to cool the conducting metal walls of a cavity with a length scale @xmath33 to well below @xmath34 .",
    "however , this by no means implies that the radiation within the cavity can have a temperature well below @xmath34 .",
    "the point is that at temperatures @xmath35 , there are perhaps only a few photons ( in total ) in the cavity .",
    "the total number of photons are far too few for the cavity radiation system temperature to be well defined .    in sec.iv ,",
    "a confined system of @xmath36 atoms obeying ideal gas bose statistics is discussed .",
    "such systems can be bose condensed , and are presently ( perhaps ) the lowest temperature systems available in laboratories . in the quasi - classical approximation ,",
    "the free energy is computed in sec.v .",
    "questions concerning bounds on ultra - low temperatures are explored .",
    "whether or not such bose condensed atoms can exhibit superfluid behavior is discussed in sec.vi .",
    "the superfluid and normal fluid contributions to the moment of inertia are computed . in the",
    "concluding sec.vii , another simple system with fluctuation limits on ultra - low temperatures will be briefly discussed .",
    "let @xmath37 denote some physical quantity which depends on the energy @xmath17 of a physical system . if the system is in contact with a thermal bath at temperature @xmath5 , then the thermodynamic average may be calculated from @xmath38 where the probability @xmath39 has been defined in eq.(1.9 ) .",
    "using the `` summation by parts''[3,4 ] formula @xmath40 i.e. with a strongly peaked @xmath39 @xmath41 one finds @xmath42 employing eqs.(1.6 ) and ( 1.9 ) , @xmath43 eqs.(2.4 ) and ( 2.5 ) imply the central result of this section @xmath44    if we choose @xmath45 , then eq.(2.6 ) reads @xmath46 i.e. on average , the reciprocal of the system temperature is equal to the reciprocal of the thermal bath temperature .",
    "thus , with fluctuations from the mean @xmath47 @xmath48 eq.(2.6 ) reads @xmath49 if we choose in eq.(2.10 ) the function @xmath50 to be @xmath51 ( where @xmath52 is the system heat capacity ) , then @xmath53 the standard eqs.(1.1 ) and ( 1.2 ) follow from the more precise eqs.(2.7 ) and ( 2.12 ) in the limit of small temperature fluctuations ; i.e. @xmath54    the condition @xmath14 is required in order that the canonical thermal bath temperature be equivalent to the micro - canonical system temperature . if the micro - canonical and canonical temperatures are not equivalent , then the statistical thermodynamic definition of temperature would no longer be unambiguous .",
    "this raises fundamental questions as to the physical meaning of temperature .",
    "the view of this work is that in an ultra - low temperature limit , whereby @xmath55 for sufficiently small @xmath5 , the whole notion of system temperature is undefined , although the notion of a thermal bath temperature retains validity .",
    "the heat capacity of black body radiation in a cavity of volume @xmath26 with the walls of the cavity at temperature t is given by[5 ] @xmath56 where @xmath27 is given by eq.(1.10 ) . from eqs.(1.2 ) and ( 3.1 ) it follows that the radiation temperature of a black body cavity of volume @xmath26 is @xmath57 in order to achieve a well defined radiation temperature inside the cavity , @xmath58 must be small on the scale of @xmath5 or equivalently @xmath30 .",
    "as stated in sec.1 , this implies a minimum temperature of @xmath32 for a cavity of @xmath31 .",
    "the grand canonical free energy of an ideal bose gas is determined by the trace[6 ] @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the one boson hamiltonian and @xmath61 determines the number of bosons @xmath36 .",
    "if the one boson partition function is defined as @xmath62 then the free energy obeys @xmath63 the mean number of bosons is @xmath64 and the statistical entropy is given by @xmath65 where @xmath66 .    of considerable theoretical[7,8 ]",
    "experimental[9,10,11 ] interest is the bound boson in an anisotropic oscillator potential , @xmath67 where @xmath68 eqs.(4.3 ) and ( 4.7 ) imply @xmath69 the heat capacity may be defined by @xmath70 which must be calculated numerically .    shown in fig.1",
    "is a plot of the heat capacity ( in units of @xmath71 ) versus temperature ( in units of the critical temperature @xmath72 ) for the case of @xmath73 and @xmath74 particles .",
    "we choose , for experimental interest[12 ] , the frequency eigenvalues @xmath75 , and @xmath76 .",
    "* figure 1 . *    for finite @xmath36 ,",
    "there is strictly speaking no bose - einstein condensation phase transition .",
    "the critical temperature @xmath72 is therefore defined as that temperature for which the heat capacity reaches the maximum value @xmath77 .",
    "although phase transitions are defined in mathematics only in the thermodynamic limit @xmath78 , for all practical purposes , a quasi - classical approximation of eq.(4.1 ) in the form @xmath79 where @xmath80 does yield a bose - einstein condensation phase transition whose heat capacity is sufficiently accurate for values of @xmath81 or higher .",
    "thus , we regard recent experiments on bose atoms confined in a magnetic bottle to be probing a physical bose - einstein ordered phase .",
    "let us consider eq.(4.10 ) in more detail .",
    "in order to evaluate eq.(4.10 ) we employ the quasi - classical form[13,14 ] of eqs.(4.3 ) and ( 4.11 ) ; i.e. @xmath82 where @xmath83 . from eqs.(4.4 ) and ( 5.1 ) , it follows that eq.(4.10 ) evaluates to @xmath84 from eqs.(4.2 ) and ( 5.2 ) , the number of particles obeys @xmath85 with the usual definition of the @xmath86-function @xmath87 the bose - einstein condensation critical temperature is @xmath88 the non - zero number of bosons ( below the critical temperature ) in the condensate state is given by @xmath89 finally , the entropy below the critical temperature @xmath90 obeys the thermodynamic third law @xmath91 .",
    "the heat capacity in the bose - einstein condensed phase is then given by @xmath92    employing eqs.(1.2 ) and ( 5.8 ) we find that the temperature uncertainty below the critical temperature obeys @xmath93 thus , for @xmath81 one may safely consider the temperature of the ordered phase to be well defined in the range @xmath94 , where @xmath95 .",
    "the open question as to whether the ordered phase is a superfluid may now be considered .",
    "the notion of a superfluid fraction in an experimental bose fluid ( such as liquid @xmath96 ) may be viewed in the following manner : suppose that we pour the liquid into a very slowly rotating vessel and close it off from the environment .",
    "the walls of the vessel are at a bath temperature @xmath5 , and the vessel itself rigidly rotates at a very small angular velocity @xmath97 . in the `` two - fluid '' model[15,16 ] ,",
    "the normal part of the fluid rotates with a rigid body angular velocity @xmath98 , which is the same as the angular velocity of the vessel . on the other hand ,",
    "the superfluid part of the fluid does not rotate .",
    "the superfluid exhibits virtually zero angular momentum for sufficiently small @xmath97 .",
    "the total fluid moment of inertia tensor @xmath99 is defined by the fluid angular momentum @xmath100 ( as @xmath101 ) .",
    "we here take the limit @xmath101 , to avoid questions concerning the effects of vortex singularities on the superfluid . the normal fluid , which rotates along with the rotating vessel , contributes to the fluid moment of inertia .",
    "the superfluid , which does not rotate with the vessel , does not contribute to the moment of inertia .",
    "thus , the _ geometric _ moment of inertia , @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the mean mass density of the fluid ( at rest ) , overestimates the _ physical _ moment of inertia eigenvalues when the fluid is actually a superfluid .",
    "the normal fluid contributes to the moment of inertia and the superfluid does not do so in the limit @xmath101 .",
    "below , we consider in detail the moment of inertia of the bound bose gas .    for the bound bose system , we consider a mesoscopic rotational state[17 ] with a thermal angular velocity @xmath98 .",
    "the rotational version of eq.(4.2 ) reads @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the bound boson angular momentum .",
    "eq.(4.11 ) gets replaced by @xmath106 so that eq.(5.1 ) now reads @xmath107 where the matrix @xmath108 is written in eq.(4.8 ) and @xmath109 from eqs.(4.4 ) and ( 6.4 ) , it follows that @xmath110 the fluid moment of inertia tensor has the matrix elements @xmath111 eqs.(4.8 ) , ( 6.5 ) , ( 6.6 ) and ( 6.7 ) imply ( in the unordered phase ) @xmath112 in the unordered phase , obeying eq.(5.2 ) , one finds that eq.(6.8 ) is precisely what would be expected from a normal fluid with geometric moment of inertia @xmath113 where @xmath103 is the mean mass density of the atoms .    in the ordered phase @xmath114 , the moment of inertia of the particles over and above the condensate",
    "is given by eq.(6.8 ) with @xmath115 , i.e. @xmath116    the question of superfluidity concerns the magnitude of the moment of inertia of those particles within the condensate .",
    "for @xmath117 , we use the notation that @xmath99 denotes the moment of inertia of the excited bosons , and @xmath118 represents the moment of inertia of the bose condensate .",
    "if the moment of inertia of the particles in the condensate were zero , then the condensate particles would all be `` superfluid '' .",
    "let @xmath119 be the normalized ( @xmath120 ) bose condensation state . from the geometric viewpoint ,",
    "the moment of inertia of the condensate would be given by @xmath121 the _ physical _ bose condensate moment of inertia tensor is in reality @xmath122 where @xmath123 .",
    "one may derive eq.(6.13 ) by treating the rotational coupling @xmath124 to second order perturbation theory in the energy @xmath125 as @xmath101 .",
    "eq.(6.13 ) evaluates to @xmath126    if there exists an axis of symmetry , then the condensate moment of inertia corresponding to that axis vanishes . for an experimental example , if @xmath127 , then the @xmath128axis is an axis of symmetry and @xmath129 as implied by eq.(6.14 ) . in this sense , for the ideal bose gas , the superfluid fraction is the same as the condensate fraction in eq.(5.6 ) , @xmath130 if we were to employ an axis which is not a symmetry axis , i.e. if the angular momentum about that axis were not conserved , then even the superfluid would give some contribution to the moment of inertia .    finally , including",
    "the scattering length will have some effect on the magnitude of the superfluid fraction[18 ] .",
    "we have employed the heat capacity @xmath1 in the relationship @xmath131 in order to place lower bounds on possible system temperatures .",
    "the minimum system temperatures were estimated based on the notion that the temperature is `` well defined '' only if temperature fluctuations are small @xmath14 .",
    "the third law of thermodynamics , in the form @xmath2 , dictates that the condition @xmath14 is harder to achieve as the temperature is lowered .",
    "for example , one may achieve low temperatures by adiabatic demagnetization[19 ] .",
    "the thermodynamics of the method is well illustrated by a system of @xmath36 non - interacting two level particles , each with possible energies @xmath132 such a physical system might consist of @xmath36 nuclear one half spins in a magnetic field .",
    "the mean energy of such a system , @xmath133 implies a heat capacity @xmath134 given by @xmath135 the temperature fluctuation of a system of non - interacting two level particles follows from eqs.(7.1 ) and ( 7.4 ) to be @xmath136    thus , for a system of @xmath137 two level particles , it is only possible to achieve a temperature as low as @xmath138 . for a system of @xmath137",
    "trapped bosons , as shown in this work , it is possible to achieve a temperature as low as @xmath95 .",
    "it is evident on the grounds of temperature fluctuations alone that the bound boson systems are the more likely example for the very lowest temperatures .",
    "indeed , this has turned out to be true in the laboratory ."
