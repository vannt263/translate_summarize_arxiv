    "recent experiments @xcite have revealed important features of the neutrino mass matrix .",
    "it is now rather well - established that the neutrino masses are tiny , and that at least some of the mixing angles are large , or even maximal .",
    "considerable effort has been devoted to a theoretical understanding of these features .",
    "the small value of neutrino masses is a natural feature of theories with new physics entering at a high energy scale , such as grand unified theories ( gut ) . in such theories ,",
    "neutrino masses enter the low energy effective lagrangian as a dimension five operator @xcite involving two fermion fields and two higgs fields .",
    "thus the neutrino masses are suppressed from the charged fermion masses by a factor of the ratio of the weak scale to the scale of new physics .",
    "however these dimensional arguments do not explain why the neutrino mixing angles should be large .",
    "radiative corrections renormalize all terms in the lagrangian , including the neutrino mass .",
    "these effects may provide a dynamical explanation for the value of the top quark and higgs masses ( for a recent review , see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "for neutrinos , these corrections were worked out some time ago @xcite and have been studied extensively of late for the standard model ( sm ) and the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) ( see e.g. @xcite ) . in these models",
    "renormalization effects on neutrino mixing are proportional to the charged lepton masses and hence are relatively small . also , maximal neutrino mixing is a saddle point in the sm and mssm @xcite , with the infrared attractive fixed point corresponding to vanishing neutrino mixing .",
    "thus renormalization effects in the sm and mssm can not readily explain the observed large neutrino mixing .",
    "here we shall study neutrino mixing in an extension of the standard model to two higgs doublet fields , @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "it is customary to assume that the two higg s transform differently under a discrete @xcite or continuous ( e.g. @xcite ) symmetry chosen so that each type of charged fermion couples to only one higgs doublet .",
    "this insures that there are no flavor changing neutral higgs couplings in the dimension four terms .",
    "however this symmetry does not necessarily mean that there is only one type of dimension five neutrino mass term .",
    "in general , there are four ways to combine two higgs fields and two neutrino fields @xcite . of the four dimension five operators , one involves two @xmath0 fields , one involves two @xmath1 fields , and the other two depend on both fields .",
    "the symmetry used to eliminate flavor changing neutral currents among the charged leptons may be chosen such that almost any desired combination of these operators are allowed . here",
    "we choose to study the case where only the latter two operators are relevant : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the left - handed lepton doublet , @xmath4 and @xmath5 the generation indices and @xmath6 are su(2 ) indices .",
    "@xmath7 is symmetric under interchange of the generation indices @xmath4 and @xmath5 , while @xmath8 is antisymmetric .",
    "when the higgs fields acquire vacuum expectation values @xmath9 the neutrino mass term is @xmath10 where @xmath11 gev and @xmath12 . because the neutrino mass term does not explicitly depend on @xmath13 ,",
    "this combination of operators is relatively simple to study .",
    "renormalization mixes the two operators so both must be simultaneously evolved to study neutrino mixing .",
    "in the basis where the charged lepton mass matrix is diagonal , the evolution equations are @xcite @xmath14 \\kappa_{\\alpha\\beta } - { 1\\over 2 } ( y_\\beta^2 + y_\\alpha^2 ) \\kappa _ { \\alpha\\beta } \\nonumber \\\\ & & + 2 ( y_\\beta^2 - y_\\alpha^2 ) \\xi_{\\alpha\\beta } ] , \\nonumber \\\\ { d \\xi_{\\alpha\\beta } \\over d t } & = & [ - 9 g_2 ^ 2 + 2 \\lambda_3 - 2 \\lambda_4 + s ] \\xi_{\\alpha\\beta } + { 3\\over 2 } ( y_\\beta^2 + y_\\alpha^2 ) \\xi_{\\alpha\\beta } \\nonumber \\\\ & & + { 3\\over 2 } ( y_\\beta^2 - y_\\alpha^2 ) \\kappa_{\\alpha\\beta } ] .",

    "we concentrate here on studying the new effects on neutrino mixing introduced by the @xmath13 parameter . to simplify the analysis we assume that all parameters are real .",
    "the evolution of the scale of the neutrino mass matrix can be separated out from the evolution of the dimensionless parameters . for dimensionless physical parameters in the two - flavor approximation",
    "we use the mixing angle @xmath29 @xmath30 a ratio of neutrino mass eigenvalues , @xmath31 , defined as @xmath32 and the ratio of the upper off - diagonal elements of the two dimension five terms @xmath33 since the diagonal elements of @xmath13 vanish , this parameterization is complete .",
    "the particular form of @xmath34 is chosen so that the fixed points are finite and simple @xcite . in this parameterization , @xmath35    after a little algebra , one finds that the evolution equations for the dimensionless parameters are @xmath36 where @xmath37    these equations and the dimension five operators possess various symmetries .",
    "for example , under the transformation @xmath38 accompanied by an interchange of the mass eigenvalues @xmath39 the diagonal elements of the neutrino mass matrix , eq .",
    "( [ mmatrix ] ) , are invariant while the off - diagonal elements change sign",
    ". however the overall sign of the off - diagonal elements is not a physical observable since it may be absorbed in the unphysical phases with a redefinition of the neutrino wave function @xmath40 .",
    "this transformation changes the sign of @xmath41 and @xmath42 simultaneously , so @xmath43 is invariant .",
    "thus the neutrino mass matrix and the rge evolution equations respect this symmetry .",
    "the running of @xmath43 is independent of the neutrino physical parameters @xmath34 and @xmath29 .",
    "thus we shall use @xmath43 to characterize the possible motion of @xmath34 and @xmath29 .",
    "the fixed points of @xmath34 and @xmath29 are obtained by setting their derivatives in eq .",
    "( [ evo ] ) equal to zero and solving .",
    "the stabilities of each fixed point are obtained by finding the eigenvalues of the jacobian at the fixed point ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the results of this analysis for decreasing t ( i.e. approaching the infrared ) are in the table ( for increasing t the stabilities are reversed ) . as the table shows , the location of the fixed points are independent of @xmath43 , but their stability does depend on @xmath43 .",
    "of the five fixed points , only three are physically distinct since the symmetry of eqs .",
    "( [ st ] ) and ( [ sz ] ) maps two into two others .",
    "the fixed points at @xmath44 and @xmath45 correspond to no mixing and a massless muon - neutrino",
    ". the fixed points at @xmath46 and @xmath47 correspond to no mixing and a massless tau - neutrino .",
    "the fixed point at @xmath48 corresponds to maximal mixing with equal magnitude but opposite sign mass eigenvalues .",
    "note that the sm corresponds to @xmath49 for which large mixing is a saddle - node @xcite .    to determine which of the possibilities in the table is realized",
    ", we must determine the behavior of @xmath43 .",
    "setting @xmath50 in eq .",
    "( [ evo ] ) yields the fixed points of @xmath43 , @xmath51 , as @xmath52 thus @xmath43 evolution has two fixed points  one positive and one negative .",
    "the stability of the fixed points is easily found by plotting @xmath53 versus @xmath43 , as in fig .",
    "the minus sign is included in the derivative to give us the stability for t _ decreasing _ .",
    "we see that the positive fixed point , @xmath54 , is a repellor while the negative fixed point , @xmath55 , is an attractor .",
    "this is true , regardless of the value of the parameters @xmath56 or @xmath57 .",
    "if the initial ( high energy ) value satisfies @xmath58 , then @xmath43 evolves directly to the fixed point .",
    "if the initial ( high energy ) value satisfies @xmath59 then @xmath43 initially evolves toward positive infinity .",
    "however note that evolution through @xmath60 to the attractive fixed point at @xmath55 is possible when the denominator of @xmath43 , @xmath42 , evolves through 0 .    from the table ,",
    "the attractive fixed point value of @xmath43 will cause maximal neutrino mixing to be an attractive fixed point when @xmath61 this corresponds to @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath64 is the standard model value for the squared charged lepton yukawa coupling differences ( @xmath65 for @xmath66 s and @xmath67 for @xmath68 ) .",
    "our lack of knowledge of the higg s parameters @xmath69 and @xmath70 ( especially its sign ) makes it impossible to definitively evaluate this condition .",
    "however it appears that maximal neutrino mixing is an attractive fixed point for an extremely wide range of parameters .    the neutrino mixing and mass evolution for the case of negative @xmath43 is graphically displayed in fig .",
    "there the fixed points and the direction field are plotted for _ decreasing _ t. starting from some initial point specified by the high energy theory , the evolution of @xmath34 and @xmath29 follow a trajectory on this graph and the plotted unit arrows show the directions tangent to this trajectory . the vector field plot does not explicitly depend on @xmath71 or @xmath57 but does depend on the value of @xmath43 .",
    "however for @xmath72 the explicit @xmath43 dependence also cancels out of the vector field plot .",
    "here we use a fixed point value @xmath73 which corresponds to @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 . except at the extreme upper and lower edges of the plot",
    ", the evolution is towards the large mixing fixed point .    in the standard model ,",
    "the small size of @xmath57 tends to suppress the neutrino parameter evolution . to compensate for this small factor ,",
    "previous analyses @xcite have usually focused on the possibility of a large neutrino mass degeneracy at high energies , i.e. @xmath77 .",
    "let us briefly consider the evolutionary behavior of large @xmath78 .",
    "for large @xmath78 , @xmath34 changes much faster than @xmath29 does . for @xmath79 , the evolution equations , eq .",
    "( [ evo ] ) , are the same as those of the standard model and the approximate invariant is @xcite @xmath80 where @xmath81 is a constant , independent of @xmath71 and @xmath57 .",
    "qualitatively , the running is away from the standard model repulsive fixed point and toward the standard model attractive fixed point ( see table ) . for small initial ( high energy ) @xmath29 values , running causes @xmath82 and @xmath29 to decrease until @xmath83 when @xmath43 effects become relevant and then drive the mixing towards maximal .",
    "for large initial @xmath29 values ( @xmath29 near @xmath84 ) , running causes @xmath82 to initially increase and @xmath29 to initially decrease , until @xmath29 evolves through maximal mixing to @xmath85 where @xmath34 starts to decrease .",
    "when @xmath34 has decreased enough such that @xmath86 then @xmath43 effects become relevant and drive the mixing back toward maximal .",
    "thus it is only when @xmath87 that the attractive fixed point nature of maximal mixing is apparent .",
    "sufficient evolution will eventually produce @xmath88 .    for large @xmath89 , the @xmath34 dependence of @xmath90 in eq .",
    "( [ evo ] ) disappears and evolution of the mixing angle simplifies considerably . then the renormalization equations may be solved to give @xmath91 } \\label{thtan}\\ ] ] which describes the evolution of the mixing angle . here",
    "@xmath92 and @xmath93 are the high energy and low energy values of @xmath71 .",
    "this equation clearly shows that running does not change the sign of @xmath94 , but just increases its magnitude , i.e. @xmath95 . from eq .",
    "( [ thtan ] ) , the @xmath34 evolution can be obtained using the large @xmath43 approximation invariant @xmath96 where @xmath97 is a constant , independent of @xmath43 , and so only slowly varying with @xmath71 and @xmath57 .",
    "( [ thtan ] ) we can find the approximate conditions for significant evolution toward the maximal mixing fixed point .",
    "a change in @xmath94 greater than a factor of 10 requires @xmath98 where we have taken @xmath99 , @xmath100 and the @xmath101 denotes a value averaged over the running between these points",

    "( [ tcon2 ] ) , this conditions still weakly depends on @xmath57 .",
    "the smaller @xmath57 is , the larger the magnitude of the attractive fixed point value @xmath55 , and so more running is required which in turn requires a larger @xmath70 .",
    "in general , the amount the mixing angle evolves depends on two parameters that are not well known , @xmath70 and @xmath69 . a complete analysis of all the constraints on these parameters , and how they relate to neutrino mixing angle evolution , is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "however we note that studies of the evolution of the two - higgs potential parameters ( see e.g. @xcite ) suggest that the @xmath25 s are not generally driven to a particular fixed point , but that a range of values are consistent with experimental and theoretical constraints .",
    "constraints on two - higgs models also follow from studies of flavor changing neutral currents .",
    "in particular , the flavor changing neutral current decay b @xmath115 s + @xmath116 tightly constrains two - higgs models where a different higgs couples to the two types of quarks ( type - ii ) ( see e.g. @xcite ) . however this constraint can be avoided by coupling @xmath1 to both quark types and @xmath0 to the charged leptons",
    ". then large @xmath69 corresponds to large charged lepton yukawa couplings , but approximately standard model values of the quark yukawa couplings .",
    "large values of @xmath57 would help produce large mixing angle evolution , but they also tend to enhance lepton universality violations",
    ". however a recent analysis of w and z decay data @xcite finds very weak limits on two - higgs models from lepton universality , with values of @xmath69 up to and exceeding 100 allowed ( this corresponds to @xmath117 exceeding 1 ) .",
    "thus large running of the neutrino mixing angle appears to be compatible with present constraints on two - higgs models .",
    "the evolution of the physical mixing angles and mass ratios is quite complicated for three flavors .",
    "here we do not give explicit formulae for their evolution but instead focus on the texture of the mass matrix produced by evolution .",
    "then we plot renormalization effects obtained numerically for one particular scenario .",
    "the general nature of renormalization effects on the neutrino mass matrix in this model can be found by examining the relative running of diagonal to off - diagonal elements @xmath118   \\left ( { \\kappa_{\\beta \\beta } \\over \\kappa_{\\alpha \\beta } } \\right )   . \\label{dbbab}\\ ] ] here @xmath119 is defined just as it was for two flavors , @xmath120 @xmath119 is antisymmetric so for three flavors there are now three independent @xmath43 s ; @xmath121 , @xmath122 and @xmath123 . for two - flavor",
    ", this equation provides another way to understand the table .",
    "for @xmath124 for @xmath125 , the coefficient of @xmath126 on the right - hand side is positive for @xmath125 , and also for @xmath127 since @xmath119 is antisymmetric .",
    "thus as @xmath71 decreases the two diagonal elements decrease with respect to the off - diagonal elements .",
    "this leads to maximal mixing , in agreement with the table .",
    "conversely for @xmath128 for @xmath125 , both diagonal elements increase with respect to the off - diagonal elements , which drives the mixing away from maximal mixing and towards vanishing mixing .",
    "standard model like behaviour occurs for @xmath129 .",
    "then the cofficient of @xmath126 on the right - hand side is positive for @xmath125 but negative for @xmath127 .",
    "thus as infrared energies are approached the lower ( upper ) diagonal element increases ( decreases ) with respect to the off - diagonal term .",
    "running can go through the point where the diagonal elements are equal , and maximal mixing occurs , and proceed on towards vanishing mixing .",
    "thus the texture of the @xmath28 matrix depends on the behaviour of the @xmath119 s .",
    "the dynamics of the @xmath119 s follows from eqs .",
    "( [ dk ] ) .",
    "there we see that @xmath130 and @xmath131 only mix with each other so , aside from different yukawa couplings , the evolution equation for each three - flavor @xmath119 is identical in form to the two - flavor evolution equation for @xmath43 given in eqs .",
    "( [ evo ] ) .",
    "thus the general dynamics of the @xmath119 for @xmath125 are identical to what has been discussed previously and plotted in fig .",
    "they all evolve toward attractive fixed points , @xmath132 , given by the negative root of eq .",
    "( [ afp ] ) .",
    "thus evolution produces @xmath119 s which , for @xmath125 , are negative and readily less than @xmath133 ( see table and eqs . ( [ 1o4 ] ) and ( [ 1o4b ] ) ) . referring back to eq .",
    "( [ dbbab ] ) , this implies that evolution toward low energies decreases the diagonal elements relative to the off - diagonal elements of the neutrino mass matrix .",
    "then in the infrared limit the neutrino mass matrix approaches the form @xmath134 . \\label{zee}\\ ] ] here the @xmath135 s are the attractive fixed point values and @xmath13 s are their values at low energies .    for comparison purposes , let s consider the relative running of two off - diagonal elements @xmath136   \\left ( { \\kappa_{e \\mu } \\over \\kappa_{e \\tau } } \\right ) \\label{dod}\\ ] ] this equation shows that a cancellation occurs between the two terms proportional to @xmath43 s . indeed ,",
    "if we substitute in the fixed point value of the @xmath43 s for small yukawa couplings , all large terms cancel out and the running is not significant .",
    "thus the running of the off - diagonal terms is generally not a dominant process .",
    "the form of the neutrino mass matrix in eq .",
    "( [ zee ] ) is the same as that produced in the popular zee model @xcite .",
    "however note that the zee texture is never exactly obtained from renormalization , i.e. the diagonal elements never completely vanish .",
    "how closely the zee texture is approached depends on the amount of evolution , the size of the initial ( high energy ) parameters and the values of the two - higgs parameters @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "but this general texture is interesting because it can describe the experimentally desired bimaximal neutrino mixing @xcite when @xmath137 .",
    "this particular relationship among the off - diagonal parameters is not caused by running , as eq .",
    "( [ dod ] ) shows .",
    "however it may be realized if the @xmath138 s at the high energy scale have the appropriate hierarchy of values .",
    "the possible size and nature of running are demonstrated in figs .",
    "( 3 ) and ( 4 ) . in these calculations ,",
    "400 different neutrino mass matrices were generated by choosing the elements of @xmath139 at the high energy scale to be real , random numbers evenly distributed between -1 and 1 .",
    "the @xmath138 s at the high energy scale were chosen to be @xmath140 , @xmath141 and @xmath142 . the parameters @xmath143 and @xmath144 were chosen to be larger than the @xmath139 s at high energies to insure that @xmath145 and @xmath146 would be the largest matrix elements at low energies .",
    "additionally , these parameters were chosen because they satisfy @xmath147 ( actually their ratio is a little less than this to allow for running before the @xmath148 s reach their fixed points ) .",
    "the other relevant parameters were taken to be @xmath74 ,",
    "@xmath75 , @xmath149 ( which is equivalent to @xmath150 ) , and @xmath151 = 7.8 $ ] ( the last influences the overall neutrino mass scale evolution ) .",
    "these parameters were not evolved but instead held fixed because they mostly influence the overall amount of running so their precise values are not particularly important , and because the @xmath25 s and @xmath69 are for the most part unknown",
    "( 3 ) shows the mixing angles at the high and low energy scales .",
    "the mixing angles are defined following the convention of ref . @xcite as @xmath152 ^ 2 } \\ ] ] and @xmath153 ^ 2 } \\ ] ] where @xmath154 is the unitary mixing matrix .",
    "the neutrino mass eigenvalues are ordered such that @xmath155 mass squared difference .",
    "thus @xmath156 is the mixing angle relevant for atmospheric `` @xmath157-@xmath158 '' oscillations and @xmath159 is the mixing angle relevant for solar neutrino oscillations . fig .",
    "( 3 ) clearly demonstrates that renormalization from high to low energies can simultaneously drive these angles to maximal .",
    "the running effects on @xmath160 are not shown , however for the same parameters the relevant mixing quantity , @xmath161 , is driven from a range of values between 0 and 1 to @xmath162 at the low energy scale .",
    "this is consistent with the experimental limits from chooz @xcite .",
    "thus running can drive the neutrino mass matrix to a bimaximal form , consistent with present experiments .",
    "the approximate conditions for large mixing angle evolution were described in the two - flavor section in eqs .",
    "( [ tcon ] ) , ( [ tcon2 ] ) and eqs .",
    "( [ econ2 ] ) , ( [ econ3 ] ) .",
    "in particular , these equations shows that large angle evolution results if @xmath70 is large .",
    "indeed , our numerical results remain essentially unchanged if the charged lepton yukawa couplings are decreased to be their standard model values ( @xmath163 ) and @xmath70 is increased to @xmath164 .",
    "this agrees with eqs .",
    "( [ tcon2 ] ) and ( [ econ3 ] ) , except that the numerical results are somewhat better than the analytical estimates suggested by these equations because the numerical results used initial values of @xmath143 and @xmath144 that were large in magnitude .",
    "large mixing angle evolution could be maintained for smaller values of these initial @xmath143 and @xmath144 by increasing the size of @xmath70 .",
    "( 4 ) shows how running affects neutrino mass squared differences .",
    "the quantities @xmath165 and @xmath166 are each scaled by the largest neutrino mass squared and plotted against each other . from a distribution of values at the high energy scale , evolution produces an inverted hierarchy of neutrino masses with , roughly , @xmath167 .",
    "this is consistent with the results found in studies of bimaximal mixing in the zee model @xcite .",
    "neutrino masses enter into low energy physics as a dimension five operator , regardless of the details of the high energy theory . in multi - higgs extensions of the standard model ,",
    "there are generally more than one dimension five lepton - higgs operator . here",
    "we have worked in the two - higgs model , picked two of the dimension five operators ( one a symmetric mass term , the other an antisymmetric operator ) , and examined how mixing angle evolution is changed from the standard model .",
    "renormalization mixes these different operators , thus neutrino mixing depends on how the two operators evolve . because the operators evolution have different dependences on a higgs potential parameter , the mixing angle evolution depends on this parameter also .",
    "this parameter can be much larger than the tiny standard model charged lepton yukawa couplings , so the mixing angle evolution can be quite large .",
    "the size of angle evolution is also enhanced because multi - higgs models have larger charged lepton yukawa couplings .",
    "for the model studied here , for a wide range of parameters , running tends to produce a neutrino mass matrix whose diagonal elements are small compared to the off - diagonal elements . for two neutrino flavors , this corresponds to maximal mixing as the attractive infrared fixed point . for three neutrino flavors",
    ", the neutrino mass matrix resembles that produced by the zee model @xcite .",
    "it is known that this model can describe the experimentally suggested bimaximal mixing .",
    "here we showed explicitly that bimaximal mixing can be an attractive infrared fixed point if the elements of the asymmetric dimension five operator are large and heirarchical .",
    "this model predicts that the neutrino mass spectrum is inverted , with @xmath168 .",
    "this possibility may be tested using matter effects @xcite , either in long baseline experiments or in atmospheric neutrino observations .",
    "the scenario described here may be distinguished from the zee model by observing experimental processes such as double beta decay and cp violation .",
