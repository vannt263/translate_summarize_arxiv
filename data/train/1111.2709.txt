    "nonlinear optical properties of low - dimensional semiconductor nanostructures such as quantum wells ( qws ) , quantum wires , and quantum dots have become a very active field of research with respect to both theory and experiment [ 1 - 5 ] in the past decades . the advance in nanofabrication techniques",
    "has made it possible for researchers to fabricate ultra - small semiconductor structures of low nanometer size [ 6,7 ] , which has an important role and displays an interesting behavior in microelectronic and optoelectronic devices due to their influences on the electrical , optical and transport properties . and a number of theoretical and experimental investigations have been published .",
    "it is well known that the pseudopotential plays an important role in the studies of semiconductor structures [ 8 - 14 ] . nowadays , more and more important information about electronic structures in semiconductor",
    "have been theoretically obtained by using the pseudopotential approaches .",
    "tsirkin @xmath3 @xmath4 [ 8 ] studied the model pseudopotential for the @xmath5 surface of face - centered cubic ( fcc ) noble metals .",
    "the result shows that the proposed two - dimensional model pseudopotential allows to accurately reproduce the electronic structure of the @xmath5 surface of fcc noble metals at @xmath6 point .",
    "wang @xmath7 @xmath4 [ 9 ] reported the pseudopotential calculation of nanoscale cdsc quantum dots , and leiniger @xmath3 @xmath4 [ 10 ] investigated the accuracy of the pseudopotential approximation .",
    "@xmath8 . a comparison of various core sizes for indium pseudopotentials in calculations for spectroscopic constants of @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 .",
    "moreover , the pseudopotential is applied to interpreting some results from experiments with great success [ 15,16 ] .",
    "we have paid great attention to the parabolic potential before , which , as one of the pseudopotentials , is often considered to be a good representation of the potential in a quantum dot .",
    "the effects of the parabolic potential on the energy and optical properties have been widely investigated .",
    "recently , the theory of boundary value problems for hyperbolic partial differential equations has been clarified to a large extent . with separation of variable techniques ,",
    "ladyzhenskaya @xmath3 @xmath4 [ 17 ] investigated the general theorems on the existence of classical solutions to hyperbolic equations with coefficients depending on the spatial variables .",
    "lu @xmath3 @xmath4 [ 18 ] studied the rotation and vibration of diatomic molecule oscillator with hyperbolic potential function . to our knowledge",
    ", there has been no report of the nonlinear optical properties in a qw with the hyperbolic confinement potential . with respect to the lack of such studies",
    ", we believe that the present study can make an important contribution to the literatures . the aim of this paper is to investigate the effects of the hyperbolic potential on the nonlinear optical properties in a quantum well . for this purpose , we focus on studying the transition energy , oscillator strength , geometric factor and second - order nonlinear optical rectification ( or ) coefficient . the paper is organized as follows : the model and theoretical framework is described in section 2 , the results and discussions are presented in section 3 , and finally , the conclusions are given in section 4 .",
    "consider an electron in the hyperbolic potential well , x axis is perpendicular to the well layers , so hamiltonian within the framework of the effective mass approach is given by @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the electronic effective mass .",
    "@xmath14 is the hyperbolic potential which was proposed by schiberg as [ 19 ] @xmath15,\\ ] ] where @xmath16 , @xmath2 and @xmath1 are three parameters representing the potential property .",
    "1 shows the shape of the hyperbolic potential well for the different parameter @xmath1 with @xmath17 and the different parameter @xmath2 with @xmath18 , respectively . from fig .",
    "1(a ) one can see that , at the beginning , the values of @xmath19 decrease rapidly with increasing @xmath20 , and then they reach a minimum at around some @xmath20 . as @xmath20 is further increased ,",
    "the values begin to increase , and finally , they all approach asymptotically unity . moreover , the minimum position shifts to lower @xmath20 as @xmath1 increases . on the other hand , from fig .",
    "1(b ) , one can find that the shape of the hyperbolic potential well is similar to that from fig .",
    "1(a ) , but the minimum position shifts to higher @xmath20 as @xmath2 increases .",
    "the schrdinger equation with this potential is written as [ 20 ] @xmath21\\psi(x)=\\tilde{e}\\psi(x),\\ ] ] where we use the following notation @xmath22 and the formula @xmath23    the wave function and the energy spectrum of an electron confined in hyperbolic potential can be obtained [ 20 ] by solving the schrdinger equation . @xmath24 and @xmath25,\\ ] ] where the new parameters are defined as follows [ 20 ] : @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 $ ] , @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "and @xmath32 is the normalized factor to be determined from the normalization condition @xmath33 , from which @xmath32 can be further obtained as [ 20 ] @xmath34 where the pochhammer symbol @xmath35 is defined as [ 20,21 ] @xmath36      the oscillator strength is a very important physical quantity in the study of the optical properties , which are related to the electronic dipole - allowed transition .",
    "furthermore , the oscillator strength can offer additional information on the fine structure and selection rules of the optical absorption .",
    "generally , the oscillator strength @xmath37 is defined as @xmath38 where @xmath39 donates difference of the energy between lower and upper level , @xmath13 is the electronic effective mass , and @xmath40 is the electric dipole moment of the transition from the @xmath41 state to the @xmath42 state",
    ".      based on the density matrix approach and perturbation expansion method , the second - order nonlinear optical rectification coefficient is given by [ 22 - 25 ] @xmath43(\\frac{t_{1}}{t_{2}}-1 ) \\}}{\\epsilon_{0}[(\\delta e_{fi}-\\hbar\\omega)^2+(\\frac{\\hbar}{t_{2}})^2][(\\delta e_{fi}+\\hbar\\omega)^2+(\\frac{\\hbar}{t_{2}})^2]},\\ ] ] additionally , in the present work , we also investigate the intensity - dependent resonant peak of the nonlinear optical absorption coefficient which is given by [ 26 ] @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the vacuum permittivity , @xmath46 donates the volume density of electrons in the structure .",
    "@xmath47 is the electronic charge . @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the longitudinal and the transverse relaxation times , respectively . in calculation we set the relaxation time at @xmath50 , @xmath51 [ 24,25 ] . and",
    "@xmath52 [ 24 ] , @xmath53 is the photon energy .",
    "@xmath54 is the vacuum velocity of light , and @xmath55 is the refractive index of the semiconductor .",
    "we carry out numerical calculations for a typical @xmath56 qw with the hyperbolic confinement potential .",
    "the parameters chosen in the present study are the followings [ 24,25 ] : @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the free electron mass , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 .",
    "we restrict our study to the transition between @xmath61 state and @xmath62 state .",
    "the results of our calculations are presented in figures 2 - 6 . in fig .",
    "2 , we display the theoretical results for the transition energy in a hyperbolic potential qw as a function of @xmath1 for three different values of @xmath2 . from fig .",
    "2 , it is clearly found that the transition energy decreases monotonously as @xmath1 increases .",
    "the physical origin is that the increment of @xmath1 results in a reduction of the confinement strength of the hyperbolic potential qws . on the other hand",
    ", one can see that the transition energy increases with the increase of @xmath2 .",
    "this is because the confinement strength enhances as @xmath2 increases , so one can conclude that the two parameters @xmath63 can greatly affect the energy level distribution of the electronic states in a hyperbolic potential qw , moreover , the electron wave function is more strongly localized inside the hyperbolic qw with decreasing @xmath1 and increasing @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "3 presents the variation of the oscillator strength as a function of @xmath1 for different @xmath2 .",
    "obviously , one can observe that the oscillator strength decreases as @xmath1 increases , but finally , they all approach asymptotically zero as @xmath1 increases further .",
    "the physical explanation is that the increasing @xmath1 leads to a reduction of the energy difference between the two different electronic states , as well as the electric dipole moment .",
    "hence , the tunneling probability for hyperbolic potential becomes smaller .",
    "moreover , it is shown that the oscillator strength increases with increment of @xmath2 .",
    "the main reason is that the increasing @xmath2 causes an enhancement of the energy difference between the initial state and the final state .",
    "and there is a bigger tunneling probability with the increasing @xmath2 , as a result , the oscillator strength enhances .",
    "4(a ) , 4(b ) show the second - order nonlinear or coefficient @xmath64 as a function of incident photon energy @xmath53 for three different @xmath1 with @xmath17 and for three different @xmath2 with @xmath65 , respectively . from fig .",
    "4(a ) , it can be clearly seen that for each @xmath1 , the @xmath64 as a function of @xmath53 has a maximum value which occurs because of the one - photon resonance enhancement .",
    "moreover , it is readily observed that with the increase of @xmath1 , the peak value of @xmath64 quickly decreases and the position of the peak value moves to left side , which shows a red shift .",
    "this behaviors can be explained as follows : with the increase of @xmath1 , the quantum - confinement of the electron reduces quickly .",
    "therefore , the energy intervals become narrower , and as a result , the peak of the @xmath64 suffers a redshift . on the other hand , fig .",
    "4(b ) also shows that the @xmath64 as a function of @xmath53 has a maximum value with the same physical origin , but it is easily found that the peak position of @xmath64 moves to right side , which shows the blue shift , due to the augment of the energy difference between the initial state and the final state with increasing @xmath1 . in conclusion ,",
    "the @xmath64 is greatly dependent on the two parameters for a reason that the asymmetry of the hyperbolic potential qd is strongly affected by them .    for the purpose of better understanding the relationship between nonlinear or coefficient and the two parameters , it is useful for us to study the dependence of the geometric factor on the parameters of the hyperbolic potential . in fig",
    "5 , the geometric factor @xmath66 is displayed as a function of @xmath1 for three different @xmath2 .",
    "from which , one can find that the value of the geometric factor @xmath66 monotonically decreases as both @xmath1 and @xmath2 increase .",
    "this is because the geometrical factor depends on the confinement strength of the hyperbolic potential qw , and the increasing @xmath1 leads to an obvious reduction of the confinement strength , which result in a decrement of the overlap integral @xmath67 and the mean electron displacement @xmath68 , respectively . for @xmath2 ,",
    "the consequences are similar . as a conclusion , the geometric factor and the corresponding peak of @xmath64 are strong dependence of @xmath1 and @xmath2 in the hyperbolic qw .    in fig .",
    "6 , the nonlinear optical absorption ( oa ) is presented as a function of @xmath1 for three different @xmath2 . from this figure",
    ", one can clearly note that the nonlinear oa decreases rapidly as @xmath1 increases , and this physical behavior can be explained as follows : the increasing @xmath1 causes an enhancement of the electron geometric confinement of electron , thus , the electron becomes more energetic , so it penetrates easily into the potential , and the penetration can lead to a reduction of overlap between the @xmath61 state and the @xmath62 state . as a result , the overlap integral @xmath67 weakens .",
    "in addition , the increasing @xmath1 can also lead to the fact that the energy levels become closer to each other , so the energy difference reduces with the increment of @xmath1 .",
    "furthermore , we can see that the nonlinear oa is more sensitive to @xmath2 in comparison with @xmath1 .",
    "for instance , the magnitude of oa increases very quickly as @xmath2 increases .",
    "the physical origin is that rapid enhancements of the energy interval and the geometric factor are occurred because of the variation in @xmath2 .",
    "so by tuning the values of the @xmath2 and @xmath1 , one can get some special consequences needed in the experiment , which could be very significant in designing devices .",
    "a detailed study of the optical properties have been presented for a typical @xmath56 qw with hyperbolic confinement potential .",
    "we have investigated the effects of @xmath1 and @xmath2 on the transition energy , oscillator strength , nonlinear or and nonlinear oa .",
    "the energy levels and the corresponding wavefunctions are obtained within the framework of an effective mass approach . as indicated in results , an increment of @xmath1",
    "reduces the transition energy , oscillator strength , geometric factor , nonlinear or and nonlinear oa .",
    "however , an increment of @xmath2 enhances these physical quantities , but not for the geometric factor .",
    "so one can control these physical quantities by modulating the values of these parameters to meet some special needs in designing electro - optical devices . in conclusion , optical properties in a qw with hyperbolic confinement potential are strong dependence of @xmath1 and @xmath2 , and we hope this theoretical study can stimulate experimental studies and practical applications .",
