    "the above example is somewhat degenerate : the critical point @xmath39 is at the edge of the physical space with @xmath40 .",
    "a more regular example of the cpt is given by the phase transition at @xmath41 in the @xmath42-dimensional gross - neveu model : in that case both positive and negative values of @xmath43 are physical ( see sec.3 ) .",

    "also there may exist phase transitions in @xmath50-dimensional theories which `` imitate '' the cpt ( see sec.5 ) .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to reveal the main features of the cpt ( common for its different realizations ) and to apply the conception of the cpt to concrete models .",
    "the cpt is @xmath51 a @xmath1-model like phase transition , though it is continuous . in particular , in the cpt , one can not introduce the parameters @xmath52 governing the phase transition .",

    "this feature implies a specific form of the effective action describing light excitations in theories with the cpt , which will be discussed in this paper .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec.2",
    "we consider the properties of the spectrum of light excitations around the critical point @xmath10 in the cpt .",
    "we show that , though the cpt is a continuous phase transition , there is an abrupt change of the spectrum of light excitations as the critical point is crossed . in sec.3",
    "we describe the chiral phase transition in the @xmath53-dimensional ( @xmath54 ) nambu - jona - lasinio ( gross - neveu ) model .",
    "we study the cpt in the 2-dimensional gross - neveu model .",
    "this allows to illustrate main features of the cpt in a very clear way . in sec.4",
    "we study the cpt in quenched qed4 , which is relevant for the study of the phase transition with respect to fermion flavors in a 4-dimensional @xmath44 gauge theory . in sec.5",
    "the main features of the cpt are summarized and the realization of a pseudo - cpt in qed3 is considered . in sec.6",
    "the structure of the effective action in theories with the cpt and the realization of the dynamics of the partially conserved dilatation current in these theories are discussed . in sec.7 the phase diagram with respect to the bare coupling constant @xmath55 and the number of fermion flavors @xmath13 in a @xmath44 gauge theory is considered . in particular , we suggest a modified ( as compared to that suggested in ref . [ 3 ] ) phase diagram .",
    "possibilities of the examination of this phase diagram in lattice computer simulations are discussed . in sec.8",
    "we summarize the main results of the paper . in the appendix",
    "some useful relations are derived .",
    "as was already pointed out in introduction , in the case of the @xmath1-model like phase transition , masses of light excitations are continuous functions of the parameters @xmath11 around the critical point @xmath10 ( though they are non - analytic at @xmath10 ) .",
    "let us show that the situation in the case of the cpt is different : there is an abrupt change of the spectrum of light excitations , as the critical point @xmath10 is crossed .",
    "let us start from a particular , and important , case of the cpt connected with dynamical chiral symmetry breaking . in this case , in the non - symmetric phase , amongst light ( with masses much less than cutoff @xmath15 ) excitations",
    ", there are massless nambu - goldstone ( ng ) bosons @xmath56 , their chiral partners , @xmath1 bosons , and light ( with @xmath57 ) fermions .",
    "the masses of @xmath1 and fermions are given by scaling relations : @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 are some positive constants , and @xmath16 is a universal scaling function .",
    "because of the assumption ( [ 3 ] ) , @xmath61 and @xmath62 are indeed much less than @xmath63 , when @xmath11 is near @xmath18 from the side of the non - symmetric phase .",
    "now , are there light @xmath56 and @xmath1 resonances in the symmetric phase , with @xmath64 ?",
    "since , as was assumed , @xmath24 as @xmath25 in that phase , one should expect that there are no light resonances .",
    "let us show that this is indeed the case .",
    "one might think that in the symmetric phase the mass relation for @xmath56 and @xmath1 is yielded by the analytic continuation of the relation ( [ 5 ] ) for @xmath61 .",
    "however this is not the case .",
    "the point is that while in the non - symmetric phase , @xmath56 and @xmath1 bosons are described by bethe - salpeter ( bs ) equations with a non - zero fermion mass , in the symmetric phase they are described by bs equations with @xmath65 . because of that , bs equations ( and , more generally , all the schwinger - dyson equations for green s functions ) in the symmetric phase are not yielded by an analytic continuation of the equations in the non - symmetric phase .    to overcome this obstacles",
    ", we shall use the following trick . in the non - symmetric phase , besides the stable solution with @xmath66 , there is also an unstable solution with @xmath67 . in that solution ,",
    "@xmath56 and @xmath1 bosons are tachyons : @xmath68 .",
    "since the replacement of @xmath69 by @xmath64 ( at fixed values of the parameters @xmath11 ) does not change the ultraviolet properties of the theory , the scaling relation for the tachyon masses has the same form as that in eqs .",
    "( [ 5 ] ) and ( [ 6 ] ) : @xmath70 since now @xmath67 , the bs equations for tachyons have the same form as the bs equations for @xmath56 and @xmath1 in the symmetric phase ; the difference between these equations is only in the values of @xmath11 ( for convenience , we shall assume that @xmath71 in the non - symmetric ( symmetric ) phase ) .",
    "then , in the symmetric phase , @xmath72 with @xmath73 and @xmath74 from eq .",
    "( [ 7 ] ) .",
    "notice that because in the symmetric phase @xmath56 and @xmath1 bosons decay to massless fermions and antifermions , @xmath75 and @xmath61 are complex , i.e. @xmath56 and @xmath1 are now resonances , if they exist at all .",
    "since , by definition , in the cpt , @xmath24 as @xmath76 , we conclude from eq . ( [ 8 ] ) that there are no light resonances near the critical point from the side of the symmetric phase : @xmath77 as @xmath76 .",
    "so far , for concreteness , we have considered the case of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "but it is clear that ( with minor modifications ) this consideration can be extended to the general case of the cpt connected with spontaneous breakdown of other symmetries .",
    "notice also that the relation in eq .",
    "( [ 8 ] ) can be useful for general phase transitions and not just for the cpt .",
    "the point is that the scaling function @xmath16 can be determined from the gap equation for the order parameter ( @xmath62 , in the case of chiral symmetry ) which is usually much simpler than the bs equation for massive composites .",
    "for example , an abrupt change of the spectrum at the critical point @xmath10 have been revealed in some models : in quenched qed4 @xcite and qed3 @xcite .",
    "this conclusion was based on an analysis of the effective action @xcite and the bs equation @xcite , considered in a rather crude approximation . on the other hand , since the determination of the scaling function @xmath16 in these models is a much simpler task , this conclusion can be firmly established in the present approach ( see secs.4 and 5 ) . thus the present consideration yields a simple and general criterion of such a peculiar behavior of the spectrum of light excitations .",
    "it is clear that the abrupt change of the spectrum discussed above implies rather peculiar properties of the effective action for light excitations at the critical point .",
    "below we shall consider this problem in more detail .",
    "we shall also reveal an intimate connection between this point and the essential difference of the character of the breakdown of the conformal symmetry in different phases of theories with the cpt .",
    "in this section we consider the dynamics in the @xmath53-dimensional @xmath78 nambu - jona - lasinio ( gross - neveu ) model and , in particular , describe the cpt in the gross - neveu ( gn ) model at @xmath79 .",
    "this will allow to illustrate main features of the cpt in a very clear way .",

    "what are physical reasons of such a peculiar behavior of the effective potential at @xmath79 ? unlike the case with @xmath96 , at @xmath79 the lagrangian density ( [ 9 ] ) defines a conformal theory in the classical limit . by using the conventional approach , one can derive the following equation for the conformal anomaly in this model ( see the appendix ) : @xmath142 \\label{27}\\ ] ] where @xmath143 is the dilatation current , @xmath144 is the energy - momentum tensor , and the @xmath35 function @xmath145 .",
    "it is @xmath146 both in the non - symmetric and symmetric phases .",
    "while the non - symmetric phase corresponds to asymptotically free dynamics , the symmetric phase ( with @xmath147 ) defines infrared free dynamics : as @xmath136 , we are led to a free theory of massless fermions , which is of course conformal invariant .    on the other hand , in the non - symmetric phase the conformal symmetry",
    "is broken , even as @xmath136 .",
    "in particular , eq . ( [ 24 ] ) implies that @xmath148 in leading order in @xmath120 in that phase .",
    "the physics underlying this difference between the two phases is clear : while negative @xmath93 correspond to repulsive interactions between fermions , attractive interactions at positive @xmath93 lead to the formation of bound states , thus breaking the conformal symmetry .",
    "notice the following interesting point .",
    "as follows from eq .",
    "( [ 26 ] ) , at @xmath149 the conformal symmetry is broken by a relevant ( superrenormalized ) mass operator : its dynamical dimension is @xmath150 at all @xmath151 . on the other hand , at @xmath79 the symmetry",
    "is broken by a marginal ( renormalized ) operator with the dynamical dimension @xmath150 .",
    "this point is reflected in that while at @xmath79 the expression for the order parameter @xmath134 has an essential singularity at the critical point @xmath152 , at @xmath96 , the singularity at @xmath104 in @xmath134 is not essential : as follows from eq .",
    "( [ 13 ] ) , the solution to the gap equation @xmath153 is @xmath154 in that case . as is known , the essential singularity implies the absence of of fine tuning for bare parameters .",
    "this is another reason why the cpt is so interesting .",
    "thus the cpt , in accordance with its name , describes the two essentially different realizations of the conformal symmetry in the symmetric and non - symmetric phases .",
    "if one adds a fermion mass term , @xmath155 , in the 2-dimensional gn model , the conformal and chiral symmetries will be of course broken in both phases .",
    "however , there remains an essential trace of the cpt also in this case : an abrupt change of the spectrum of light excitations still takes place .",
    "while now in the subcritical @xmath156 phase repulsive interactions between massive fermions are take place ( and there are no light resonances there ) , in the supercritical @xmath157 phase the pcac dynamics , describing interactions between fermions and light @xmath56 and @xmath1 bosons , is realized",
    ". still defines the fermion dynamical mass , and the would - be ng boson @xmath56 transforms into a bkt gapless excitation @xcite . ]    besides the point that in the 2-dimensional gn model both subcritical and supercritical phases are physical , this picture is similar to that in qcd .",
    "it is hardly surprising : in both models the dynamics in the supercritical phases are asymptotically free .",
    "we will however argue that the main features of the cpt found in the gn model will retain valid ( with appropriate minor modifications ) in the general case .",
    "in this section we shall describe the main features of the cpt in quenched qed4 .",
    "the dynamics in this model is relevant for some scenarios of dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking and has been intensively discussed in the literature ( for a review see ref . [ 10 ] ) . in the present paper",
    "the emphasis of the discussion will be on the points relevant for the general cpt in gauge theories .",
    "we shall consider the ladder ( rainbow ) approximation in massless qed4 .",
    "since the contribution of fermion loops is omitted , the perturbative @xmath35-function equals zero in this approximation .",
    "however , as is well known @xcite , beyond the critical value @xmath158 , there are nonperturbative divergences which break the conformal symmetry in the model . moreover , since at @xmath159 ,",
    "the anomalous dimension @xmath160 of the chiral operators @xmath161 and @xmath162 is @xmath163 @xcite , the four - fermion operators @xmath164 and @xmath165 become ( marginally ) relevant : their dynamical dimension @xmath166 is @xmath167 , where @xmath168 is their canonical dimension .    therefore , it is appropriate to include these four - fermion operators in the qed action .",
    "this leads to the gauged nambu - jona - lasinio model @xcite : @xmath169 + \\frac{g}{2 } \\left [ ( \\bar\\psi \\psi)^2 + ( \\bar\\psi i \\gamma_5 \\psi)^2 \\right ] , \\label{29}\\ ] ] where @xmath170 ( for simplicity , we consider the chiral symmetry @xmath171 ) . in this model ,",
    "the gauge interactions are treated in the ladder approximation and the four - fermion interactions are treated in the hartree - fock ( mean field ) approximation .",
    "since the coupling constant @xmath172 is dimensional , one may think that the four - fermion interactions in eq .",
    "( [ 29 ] ) explicitly break the conformal symmetry .",
    "the real situation is however more subtle . in fig . 1",
    ", we show the critical line in this model @xcite , dividing the symmetric phase , with the unbroken @xmath171 , and the phase with the spontaneously broken chiral symmetry @xmath173 ) .",
    "each point of the critical line corresponds to a continuous phase transition .",

    "therefore while this operator indeed breaks the conformal symmetry along the part ( [ 30 ] ) of the critical line , it is a marginal ( scale invariant ) operator along the part of the critical line with @xmath183 : its dynamical dimension is @xmath184 there .",

    "the line of these zero is the vertical line at which the first - order phase transition occurs ( it can not be second - order because @xmath35 has no ultraviolet - stable zeroes ) ;    \\b ) the number @xmath13 refers to the number of fermion fields in the formal continuum theory which is twice the number of single component lattice fields .",
    "therefore the minimal ( non - zero ) value of @xmath13 is @xmath441 .",
    "the vertical line ends at this value since in pure gluodynamics there is apparently no phase transition between weak - coupling and strong - coupling phases @xcite .",
    "the right - hand portion of the curve on the diagram , separating symmetric and non - symmetric phases occurs due to the following reason . at large enough values of the coupling , spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking takes place for any number @xmath13 of kogut - susskind fermions .",
    "then the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite argue that it is not reasonable to allow spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking to persist bellow some finite @xmath442 . as a result",
    "they suggest the existence of that right - hand portion of the curve on the diagram , describing a chiral first - order phase transition .",
    "the form of this curve reflects the fact that polarization screening effects become stronger with increasing @xmath13 , and therefore the value of @xmath43 , at which the first - order chiral phase transition occurs , increases with @xmath13 .",
    "note that it is called a bulk phase transition in the literature .    at last",
    ", the left - hand portion of the curve , separating symmetric and non - symmetric phases , coincides with the line of the infrared - stable fixed points @xmath443 in eq .",
    "( [ 92 ] ) .",
    "it separates the symmetric , coulomb , phase describing interactions of massless gluons and fermions , and the non - symmetric ( and confinement ) phase .",
    "since it is a line of infrared - stable fixed points , it describes a first - order phase transition .",
    "thus , in the banks - zaks picture , spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking and confinement occur in the weak - coupling phase at all @xmath444 . notice that the left - hand part of the curve in the phase diagram describes a rather unusual situation : at @xmath445 spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking and confinement disappear with @xmath446 the bare coupling constant @xmath43 .",
    "as we shall show , the phase diagram changes dramatically if one adopts the suggestion of ref .",
    "@xcite concerning the dynamics of chiral symmetry breaking in this model .",
    "the suggestion is that since the value of the infrared - stable fixed point @xmath434 is small at @xmath447 , one should expect that there is a critical value of @xmath13 , @xmath448 , above which the chiral symmetry is restored .    in order to estimate the critical value @xmath47 , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite use the dynamical picture of chiral symmetry breaking corresponding to the rainbow ( ladder ) approximation . as in known @xcite , in a @xmath44 gauge theory , this picture coincides with that in quenched qed4 , with the replacement the coupling constant @xmath449 by @xmath450 .",
    "therefore , in this approximation , spontaneous chiral symmetry occurs when the gauge coupling exceeds a critical value @xmath451 .",
    "then , the estimate for the critical value @xmath47 is @xmath452 where @xmath443 is @xmath453 with @xmath34 and @xmath436 from eq .",
    "( [ 91 ] ) .",
    "the estimate ( [ 93 ] ) leads to the critical value @xmath454 for @xmath439 , for example , @xmath47 is just below 12 .. of approximately @xmath455 @xcite . for @xmath456 , the factor",
    "@xmath457 is @xmath458 .",
    "therefore , if this factor reflects the contribution of higher orders , the estimate ( [ 93 ] ) may be reliable . ]",
    "when @xmath459 , the value of the infrared - stable fixed point @xmath434 is less than the critical value @xmath460 and there is no chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "there are two possibility : the bare coupling constant @xmath425 is @xmath461 or @xmath462 .    let us first consider the case with @xmath463 . then , if @xmath464 , the running gauge coupling @xmath465 is equal to the value @xmath434 for all @xmath466",
    ". then , as @xmath136 , one gets a conformal theory describing interactions of massless fermions and gluons .    on the other hand , if @xmath467 , the running coupling @xmath468 changes from @xmath469 at @xmath470 through @xmath471 at @xmath472 .",
    "nonperturbative effects , such as chiral symmetry breaking , are now absent , though the conformal symmetry is broken by ordinary perturbative contributions leading to running of @xmath473 .",
    "thus , in this case , an interacting non - abelian coulomb phase of massless quarks and gluons is still realized .",
    "let us now consider the case with @xmath474 .",
    "if the value of @xmath425 is close to @xmath434 , then the interactions are still weak , and chiral symmetry is unbroken .",
    "therefore there is still an interacting coulomb phase in this case , though , unlike the case with @xmath467 , the running coupling decreases with @xmath475 , and @xmath476 as @xmath477 . as @xmath136",
    ", we recover the conformal theory , with @xmath478 for all @xmath475 , discussed above .",
    "as @xmath425 becomes sufficiently large , one comes again to the first - order chiral ( bulk ) phase transition .",
    "the above consideration leads us to suggesting the phase diagram shown in fig .",
    "3 .    notice that , as before , the form of the right - hand part of the curve , describing the bulk phase transition , reflects the point that the polarization screening effects becomes stronger with increasing @xmath13 .",
    "in particular , the rainbow approximation , used at @xmath479 , ceases to be good at larger @xmath13 .",
    "the left - hand portion of the curve in fig .",
    "3 still coincides with the line of the infrared - stable fixed points @xmath443 in eq .",
    "( [ 92 ] ) .",
    "however , now it separates two symmetric ( with unbroken chiral symmetry ) phases , and , besides that , its lower end point is @xmath448 and not @xmath480 as in fig . 2 : at @xmath481 the infrared - stable fixed point is washed out by generating a dynamical fermion mass .",
    "these two symmetric phases are distinguished by their dynamics at short distances : while the dynamics of one phase is asymptotically free , another is not . on the other hand ,",
    "their long distances dynamics , governed by the infrared - stable fixed point , are similar .    at last , the horizontal , @xmath448 , line describes the cpt - like phase transition in this model .",
    "the relation ( [ 74 ] ) suggests the following scaling law for @xmath62 : @xmath482 where @xmath419 is some constant @xmath483 in eq .",

    ".    the dynamics in a @xmath485 gauge theory with @xmath486 may be relevant for the realization of the scenario of `` walking''-like technicolor for electroweak symmetry breaking @xcite : the `` walking''coupling constant @xmath487 governs the chiral symmetry breaking dynamics . in this case",
    "the effective action in quenched qed4 , considered in sec.4 , should be relevant for the description of this dynamics .",
    "let us now turn to data of lattice computer simulations of a @xmath44 gauge theory .",
    "lattice computer simulations of the @xmath488 theory with @xmath489 and @xmath490 of staggered fermions in ref .",
    "@xcite show the presence of the first - order , bulk transition separating strong- and weak - coupling phases .",
    "while at @xmath490 there is a clear signature of the chiral phase transition at which the order parameter jumps to zero , at @xmath491 the situation is less clear .",
    "more recent , and refined , simulations of this theory with @xmath491 indicates that in this case there is a first - order phase transition at which the order parameter jumps without vanishing @xcite .",
    "thus the data of both these simulations seem indicate on the presence of the vertical line ( at least at @xmath492 ) shown in fig . 2 and fig .",
    "it is still impossible at present to discriminate between these two phase diagrams .",
    "note that since the bulk phase transition is a lattice artifact , the form of the phase diagram can depend on the type of fermions used in the simulations .",
    "the simulations of the @xmath488 theory with wilson fermions @xcite show that theories which satisfy both quark confinement and spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in the continuum limit exist only for @xmath493 . when @xmath494 , the theory is non - trivial ( interacting ) , however , without quark confinement",
    ". moreover , at @xmath495 , chiral symmetry is unbroken at all values of the bare coupling @xmath425 .",
    "these data seem favor the phase diagram in fig . 3 in which the right - hand part of the curve is replaced by the horizontal line @xmath496 .",
    "it is clear that more data are needed in order to establish firmly the phase diagram in a @xmath44 gauge theory .",
    "in this paper we introduced the conception of the conformal phase transition ( cpt ) which provides a useful framework for studying nonperturbative dynamics in gauge ( and also other ) field theories .",
    "we described the general features of this phase transition .",
    "the cpt is intimately connected with the nonperturbative breakdown of the conformal symmetry , in particular , with the pcdc dynamics . in the non - symmetric phase",
    "the conformal symmetry is broken by marginal operators .",
    "this in turn yields a constraint on the form of the effective action in theories with the cpt .    in all the examples of the cpt considered in this paper , the conformal symmetry was explicitly broken by the conformal anomaly in the phase with spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "is it possible to realize dynamics with both chiral and conformal symmetries being broken spontaneously ?",
    "although at present this question is still open , we would like to note that long ago arguments had been given against the realization of such a possibility @xcite    the conception of the cpt can be useful for strong - coupling gauge theories , in particular , for qcd and models of dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking . in connection with that , we note that the effective action considered in sec .",
    "6 may be relevant for the description of @xmath1 meson @xmath497 @xcite .",

    "it is also clear that the conception of pcdc and massive dilaton can be useful for the description of the dynamics of composite higgs boson .",
    "another application of the cpt ( or pseudo - cpt ) may be connected with non - perturbative dynamics in condensed matter .",
    "here we only mention the dynamics of non - fermi liquid which might be relevant for high - temperature surperconductivity : some authors have suggested that qed3 may serve as an effective theory of such a dynamics @xcite .",
    "there has been recently a breakthrough in understanding non - perturbative infrared dynamics in supersymmetric ( susy ) theories ( for a review see ref .",
    "it would be worth considering the realization of the cpt , if any , in susy theories , thus possibly establishing a connection between susy and non - susy dynamics .",

    "as @xmath501 , where @xmath502 is the canonical expression for the trace of the energy - momentum tensor and @xmath503 is its vacuum expectation value in the perturbative ( massless ) vacuum .",
    "for the models in question , this definition guarantees the finiteness of @xmath500 in the continuum limit , after renormalizations of coupling constants . ] then , because of the lorentz invariance , @xmath504 , where @xmath505 is the vacuum energy density .",
