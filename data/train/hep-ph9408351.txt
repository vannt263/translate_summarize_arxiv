    "recently the cleo collaboration has observed@xcite the exclusive decay @xmath7 with a branching fraction of @xmath8 .",
    "a new upper limit on the inclusive @xmath9 process is also obtained as @xmath10 at 95% c.l.@xcite .",
    "this has been a subject of many papers@xcite recently .",
    "it has been argued that this experiment provides more information about restrictions on the standard model , supersymmetry , technicolor etc .",
    "their results are found to be sensitive to the theoretical calculation of @xmath11 decay . in order to reduce the theoretical uncertainty , a more accurate calculation of this decay rate",
    "is needed .",
    "the radiative @xmath12 quark decay has already been calculated in several papers@xcite@xcite .",
    "it is found to be strongly qcd - enhanced ( e.g. a factor of 7 for @xmath13 gev and @xmath14 mev in ref.@xcite ) . in other words , the strong interaction plays an important role in this decay . however , there are still some uncertainties in these papers . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "the anomalous dimension matrix was truncated and the estimated uncertainty due to this truncation is less than 15% .",
    "refs.@xcite did not contain a full leading logarithmic analysis either , although they included some of the terms neglected in ref.@xcite .",
    "ref.@xcite is believed to be a more accurate result .",
    "but it did not include the qcd running from @xmath1 to @xmath2 .",
    "since the top quark is found to be heavier than w boson ( @xmath15 gev.@xcite ) , a detailed calculation of this effect is needed .",
    "ref.@xcite does include this running , however there are some errors in the calculation of anomalous dimensions , which can lead to some changes in the final result .    in the present paper ,",
    "we recalculate the @xmath11 decay including qcd running from @xmath1 to @xmath2 , and correct the errors in ref.@xcite , i.e. its anomalous dimension matrix .",
    "furthermore , we use untruncated anomalous dimensions of qcd running from @xmath2 to @xmath4 .",
    "in minimal standard model , we first integrate out the top quark , generating an effective five - quark theory . by using the renormalization group equation",
    ", we run the effective field theory down to the w - scale , at which the weak bosons are removed .",
    "finally we continue running the effective field theory down to b - quark scale to calculate the rate of radiative @xmath12 decay . to maintain gauge invariance ,",
    "we work in a background field gauge@xcite .    the charged sector of standard model lagrangian is @xmath17\\phi_+ \\nonumber\\\\      &   + & h.c .. \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where v represents the @xmath18 unitary kobayashi - maskawa matrix , @xmath19 and @xmath20 denote the diagonalized quark mass matrices , the subscript @xmath21 and @xmath22 denote left - handed and right - handed quarks , respectively .",
    "we first integrate out the top quark , introducing dimension-6 operators to include effects of the absent top quark . in ref.@xcite",
    ", an approximation was made to keep only leading order terms of @xmath23 , neglecting the next to leading order charged current to w boson . to include the full set of dimension-6 operators",
    ", we have to pick up five more operators involving w bosons .",
    "our operators now make a complete basis of dimension-6 operators .",
    "higher dimension operators are suppressed by factor @xmath24 , where @xmath25 characterizing the external momentum of b quark etc . @xmath26 .",
    "the basis operators are : @xmath27 where @xmath28 stands for @xmath29 and the covariant derivative is defined as @xmath30 with @xmath31 denoting the qcd coupling constant .",
    "the tensor @xmath32 appearing in @xmath33 assumes the following lorenz structure , the index @xmath34 ranging from 1 to 4 : @xmath35 then we can write down our effective hamiltonian @xmath36    the matching diagrams are displayed in fig.1 and fig.2 .",
    "the diagrams involving w bosons are introduced in addition to goldstone boson ones , so the number of diagrams considered now is 2times bigger than that in ref.@xcite . after tedious calculation",
    "we have @xmath37    notice that we have included the terms of all orders of @xmath38 as far as the dimension-6 operators are concerned .",
    "however , to really achieve higher accuracy in @xmath39 , the dimension-8 operators should be considered in the matching of @xmath2 scale .",
    "these coefficients are all from the finite part integrations of electroweak loops .",
    "terms like @xmath40 always accompanied by the infinity @xmath41 vanishes here , because of our matching scale @xmath16 .",
    "they will be regenerated by renormalization group running of electroweak in the next section .",
    "the renormalization group equation satisfied by the coefficient functions @xmath43 is @xmath44 where the anomalous dimension matrix @xmath45 is calculated in practice by requiring renormalization group equations for green functions with insertions of composite operators to be satisfied order by order in perturbation theory .",
    "let @xmath46 denote a renormalized n ",
    "point 1pi green function with one insertion of operator @xmath47 .",
    "then the anomalous dimension @xmath45 characterizing the mixing of operator @xmath47 into @xmath48 is determined from the renormalization group equation for @xmath46 , @xmath49 here @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 stands for the wave - function anomalous dimensions arising from radiative corrections to the green function s @xmath53 external lines .    after evaluating the loop diagrams , we find the following leading order weak mixing of operators , with the q , r part agrees with ref.@xcite . @xmath54 these mixing are all between operators induced by tree - diagram and loop - diagram .",
    "the vanishing @xmath40 terms in the last section are regenerated here by renormalization group equation .",
    "the qcd anomalous dimensions for each of the operators in our basis are @xmath55    @xmath56    comparing with ref.@xcite , except the @xmath57 part , there are still some differences in the anomalous dimension matrix , which may lie in omitting a factor of 1/2 in ref.@xcite in calculating feynman diagram like fig.3 .",
    "after these changes , the whole matrix can be easily diagonalized , and all eigenvalues are real , which is required to maintain hermiticity of the effective hamiltonian at all renormalization scales . while in ref.@xcite it can not . in their case , some eigenvalues are complex .",
    "the solution to eqn.([ren ] ) appears in obvious matrix notation as @xmath58 c(\\mu_1).\\label{solu}\\ ] ] after inserting anomalous dimension ( [ weak][anom2 ] ) , we can have the coefficients of operators at @xmath59 . and some of these operators change a lot from ref.@xcite due to our improvements . for details ,",
    "see next section .",
    "in order to continue running the basis operator coefficients down to lower scales , one must integrate out the weak gauge bosons and would - be goldstone bosons at @xmath59 scale .",
    "the diagrams are displayed in fig.4 . in these new matching conditions",
    ", one finds the following relations between coefficient functions just above and below @xmath59 : @xmath60 in addition to these , there are new four - quark operators : @xmath61 , \\nonumber\\\\ o_4&=&(\\overline{s}_{l\\alpha } \\gamma^{\\mu } b_{l\\beta } )          [ ( \\overline{u}_{l\\beta } \\gamma_{\\mu } u_{l\\alpha})+ ... +          ( \\overline{b}_{l\\beta } \\gamma_{\\mu } b_{l\\alpha } ) ] , \\nonumber\\\\ o_5&=&(\\overline{s}_{l\\alpha } \\gamma^{\\mu } b_{l\\alpha } )          [ ( \\overline{u}_{r\\beta } \\gamma_{\\mu } u_{r\\beta})+ ... +          ( \\overline{b}_{r\\beta } \\gamma_{\\mu } b_{r\\beta } ) ] , \\nonumber\\\\ o_6&=&(\\overline{s}_{l\\alpha } \\gamma^{\\mu } b_{l\\beta } )          [ ( \\overline{u}_{r\\beta } \\gamma_{\\mu } u_{r\\alpha})+ ... +          ( \\overline{b}_{r\\beta } \\gamma_{\\mu } b_{r\\alpha})],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with coefficients @xmath62    to simplify the calculation and compare with the previous results , equations of motion(eom)@xcite is used to reduce all the remaining two - quark operators to the gluon and photon magnetic moment operators @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "the effective hamiltonian then appears just below the w - scale as @xmath65    for completeness , we first give the explicit expressions of the coefficient of operator @xmath63 and @xmath64 at @xmath66 , @xmath67 @xmath68\\right.}&\\nonumber\\\\ & \\displaystyle { + \\left[-\\frac{9}{2 } c_{o_{lr}^1}(m_t )      -\\frac{9}{2}c_{p_l^{1,1}}(m_t ) -\\frac{9}{4}c_{p_l^{1,2}}(m_t ) + \\frac{9}{4}c_{p_l^{1,4}}(m_t)\\right ] \\left[1- \\frac{8}{9 } \\left ( \\frac{\\alpha _ s ( m_w ) } { \\alpha _ s ( m_t ) } \\right ) ^ { \\frac{2}{23 } } \\right ] } & \\nonumber\\\\ & \\displaystyle { \\;\\;\\;\\left.-\\frac{1}{4}c_{p_l^4}(m_t ) + \\frac{9}{23 } 16\\pi^2 c_{w_l^1}(m_t ) \\left[1- \\frac{\\alpha _ s ( m_t ) }      { \\alpha _ s ( m_w ) } \\right ] \\right \\ }      -\\frac{23}{12 } } . &",
    "\\label{c3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] they are expressed by coefficients at @xmath16 and qcd coupling @xmath69 .",
    "so it is convenient to utilize these formula .    in the previous paper@xcite , the higher order terms of @xmath70",
    "are included in this stage by hands in order to match the previous work@xcite@xcite when @xmath71 .",
    "therefore it is unnatural . while in this work ,",
    "we keep higher order terms of @xmath70 from the very beginning at @xmath72 scale . if the qcd correction is ignored ( by setting @xmath73 in eqn.([c2]),([c3 ] ) ) , our results would reduce to the previous results@xcite exactly where the top quark and w bosons are integrated out together .",
    "this is required by the correctness of the effective hamiltonian , and it is also a consistent check .",
    "if we rewrite our operators @xmath64 , @xmath63 as @xmath74 , @xmath75 like ref.@xcite , @xmath76 then @xmath77 the obvious differences from qcd correction to @xmath78 and @xmath79 can easily be seen from fig.5 and fig.6 . in comparison to ref.@xcite , the enhancement of coefficient of operator @xmath74 is almost the same size , but the values for @xmath75 are quite different . here the effect to @xmath75 is an enhancement rather than a suppression as in ref.@xcite . at @xmath80 , it is enhanced a factor of 40% in comparison to ref.@xcite .",
    "these changes come mainly from the corrections of anomalous dimensions described earlier .",
    "since @xmath78 and @xmath79 are both the input of the following qcd running from @xmath2 to @xmath4 , it will be is expected to change the final result .",
    "the running of the coefficients of operators from @xmath59 to @xmath82 was well described in ref.@xcite . after this",
    "running we have the coefficients of operators at @xmath82 scale .",
    "table 1 gives the numerical values of coefficients of operators @xmath74 , @xmath75 with different input of top quark mass .",
    "here we use @xmath83gev , @xmath84gev . both @xmath85 and @xmath86",
    "are enhanced in comparison to values obtained by misiak @xcite .",
    "the obtained values of @xmath87 at the @xmath4 scale are -0.030 , -0.036 , -0.041 for @xmath88 , 200 and 300 mev , respectively .",
    "the corresponding values of @xmath89 are 0.007 , 0.008 and 0.009 .",
    "they are just the same as ref.@xcite .",
    "the leading order @xmath90 matrix element of @xmath91 is given by the sum of operators @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath74 , @xmath94 \\right\\ } < |o_7|>. \\label{heff}\\ ] ] therefore , the sought amplitude will be proportional to the squared modulus of @xmath95 \\label{c7}\\ ] ] instead of @xmath96 itself .",
    "following ref.@xcite@xcite , @xmath97 then applying eqs.([heff]),([c7 ] ) , one finds @xmath98 where @xmath99 and @xmath100 corresponding to the phase space factor and the one - loop qcd correction to the semileptonic decay , respectively@xcite .",
    "the electromagnetic fine structure constant evaluated at the @xmath12 quark scale takes value as @xmath101 .",
    "afterwards one obtains the @xmath102 decay rate normalized to the quite well established semileptonic decay rate .",
    "the results are summarized in fig.7 as functions of the top quark mass : the two upper solid lines represent the qcd - corrected ratio of the decay rates , corresponding to @xmath88 mev and @xmath103 mev , respectively . while the dashed lines correspond to the results obtained by misiak@xcite .",
    "the qcd - uncorrected values are also shown .    in this figure",
    ", we can easily see that , at @xmath5gev , it results in 12% enhancement from misiak s result@xcite , and for @xmath6gev , 15% is found .",
    "as a conclusion , we have given the full leading log qcd corrections(include qcd running from @xmath1 to @xmath2 ) , with whole anomalous dimension matrix untruncated .",
    "comparison to the previous calculation@xcite , three points are improved :          in fact , point(2 ) makes an enhancement while point(3 ) leads to a suppression . for point(1 )",
    "there is no significance change in final result .",
    "the total result does not change a lot , e.g. a suppression of 4% comparing ref.@xcite .",
    "table  2 gives the results by different authors .",
    "the branching ratio @xmath107 ranges from about @xmath108 to @xmath109 as @xmath42 varies from 90gev to 250gev(@xmath106mev ) .",
    "although this result is not quite different from the previous calculations , our improvements lie in reducing some theoretical uncertainties .",
    "this improvements are important , since the anomalous dimension matrix of ref.@xcite is not a hermitian one , and its results are not faithful .",
