    "recently developed methods to control the contour length and the effective diameter of elongated virus particles @xcite have opened up the way to systematically study the bulk phase behavior of mono- and bidisperse rods over a relatively wide range of lengths and widths .",
    "this is important , because it allows for the experimental verification of a vast amount of theoretical work that has been done on the isotropic - to - nematic ( _ in _ ) phase transition in dispersions of mutually repelling rods , and in particular that on bidisperse mixtures @xcite .",
    "the agreement of theoretical predictions for binary dispersions with experimental data @xcite has so far not been as impressive as that for monodisperse ones @xcite , where the impact of , e.g. , the size  @xcite , shape  @xcite , molecular flexibility  @xcite and coulomb interactions  @xcite appear to be well understood @xcite .",
    "one of the reasons for this state of affairs is probably that in binary mixtures there is a coupling between ordering , fractionation , and demixing , leading to a much more complex phase behavior @xcite .",
    "indeed , in bidisperse systems more length scales compete with each other , presumably making them more sensitive to the effects of flexibility , residual van der waals attractions , non - additivity or charges @xcite .",
    "binary mixtures are therefore a much more critical gauge of the accuracy of theories than monodisperse systems are . in some cases , the disagreement between theory and experiment is not just quantitative  @xcite but even qualitative .",
    "for example , in experiments on aqueous mixtures of bare fd virus particles and fd virus particles onto which polymeric chains are grafted , purdy et al .",
    "@xcite discovered a nematic - nematic coexistence region that exhibits a lower critical point .",
    "extensions of onsager s classical second - virial theory for infinitely rigid rods incorporating a diameter bidispersity do not predict such a lower critical point @xcite , not even if one allows for non - additivity of the interactions between the species @xcite .",
    "however , these theories do predict a nematic - nematic demixing either with an upper critical point or no critical endpoint at all @xcite .",
    "theoretically , nematic - nematic demixing transitions of bidisperse rods with a lower critical endpoint have been predicted , but only for rods with a sufficiently large bending flexibility @xcite , or for sufficiently short rods for which higher order virials become important @xcite .",
    "it appears , however , that some of the predictions are quite sensitive to the invoked approximations , and in our view the issue remains contentious .",
    "for instance , depending on how precisely higher order virials are approximately accounted for , the lower critical point appears and disappears in the phase diagram @xcite .",
    "this is reminiscent of the qualitative difference in the predicted phase behavior of hard - rod mixtures , depending on whether the exact orientational distribution is used or a gaussian approximation to that @xcite .",
    "so , given the apparently inherent sensitivity to the details of the theories , it remains important to explore alternative explanations of the observed phase behavior , and in particular that of the lower critical end point .",
    "a factor that has not been considered , and that could significantly influence the phase behavior in systems such as those studied by purdy and coworkers , is the finite compressibility of the polymer coating of the rods .",
    "the effective diameter of these polymer - coated rods is not necessarily fixed but could well be a function of the thermodynamic state of the dispersion .",
    "so far , the dimensions of rod - like colloids have been treated as quenched variables , i.e. , as invariants of the thermodynamic state of the suspension .",
    "( an exception to this are micellar rods with annealed length distribution @xcite . ) with the polymer - coated rods of ref .",
    "@xcite in mind , it seems opportune to explicitly consider the elastic response of this coating to the osmotic pressure of the dispersion .",
    "contrary to for instance theoretical work on the crystallization of dendrimers , where entropic interactions of a similar nature are modelled by a soft potential @xcite , we model the effects of compression not at the interaction potential level but at the level of the volume exclusion . in effect",
    ", our theory is that of particles with an annealed diameter , and hence an annealed excluded volume .",
    "our calculations show that monodisperse fluids of elastically compressible rods exhibit an isotropic - nematic phase transition at a density higher than that of the corresponding incompressible - rod system of equal diameter , as expected .",
    "how much higher , depends on the stiffness of the shell .",
    "weakly impacted upon by the shell stiffness is the relative density gap in the coexisting phases . for binary mixtures of incompressible and compressible rods ,",
    "the structure of the phase diagram changes dramatically with varying elasticity of the coating , showing once more the sensitivity of this kind of mixtures to the details of the interactions @xcite .",
    "still , the topology of the phase diagrams that we calculate does bear some resemblance to that of incompressible hard - rod mixtures of unequal diameter : an upper but no lower nematic - nematic critical point is produced by the theory .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
