    "the study of the velocity gradient tensor @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the velocity field , has great significance in determining the small - scale structure of turbulent flows . among others",
    ", it allows to identify the areas of the flow in which either strain - rate ( i.e.  deformation ) or vorticity ( i.e.  rotation ) prevails .",
    "it contains geometric information about the orientation of vorticity and strain - rate eigenvectors , and its higher - order moments quantify the level of intermittency of small - scale turbulence .",
    "here we focus on three - dimensional , incompressible turbulent flows , i.e.  @xmath2 .",
    "the lagrangian interpretation of the evolution equation for @xmath3 , derived from the ( eulerian ) navier  stokes equation , leads to a closure problem due to the fact that the pressure hessian and viscous term are not directly expressed in terms of the local value of @xmath3 .",
    "the restricted euler ( re ) model @xcite is the classical and crudest closure scheme , as it completely neglects the viscous term and the deviatoric part of the pressure hessian , assuming the latter to be isotropic .",
    "the re closure captures several qualitative features of real turbulence , such as the alignment of the vorticity vector with the direction corresponding to the intermediate eigenvalue of the strain matrix , and the statistical prevalence of axisymmetric expansion ( situations in which a fluid element , initially spherical , become pancake - like rather than cigar - like ) .",
    "it allows the analytical investigation of the lagrangian evolution of material volume elements and of their deformation tensor @xcite .",
    "moreover , it also represents the starting point to deduce the so - called advected delta - vee ( adv ) system for velocity increments @xcite .",
    "however , it presents a major drawback , namely the appearance of an unphysical finite - time singularity .    with the aim of overcoming this problem , the so - called recent fluid deformation ( rfd ) closure",
    "was introduced @xcite .",
    "it provides a model for the pressure hessian and viscous term , which are suitably parameterized , i.e.  expressed as functions of the local velocity gradient tensor . using matrix exponentials",
    ", it takes into account both the geometry and the dynamics of the recent history of the deformation of a fluid element , and requires the specification of a decorrelation time scale @xmath4 , of the order of the kolmogorov time scale .",
    "it was shown that this refined parameterization leads to stationary statistics , removing the above - mentioned finite - time singularity .",
    "moreover , it also captures some other relevant properties observed in real turbulence , such as : the non - gaussianity of longitudinal and transverse velocity gradients , the characteristic teardrop shape of the probability density function ( pdf ) in the @xmath5-@xmath6 plane , the quasi - lognormality of pseudodissipation , and , more importantly for our purposes , the correct scaling with the reynolds number ( @xmath7 ) at small to intermediate values of @xmath8 .",
    "however , when @xmath4 is chosen too short ( or , equivalently , @xmath8 is too high ) , unphysical statistics are observed in the model @xcite .    in the present paper , we investigate the limitations of the rfd closure at increasing reynolds numbers ( or decreasing imposed correlation time scale , @xmath4 ) by means of numerical computations . in particular , the predicted lagrangian time - correlation structure of the model is studied .",
    "we also propose a simplified , linearized version of the model , which turns out to have the same ( or even narrower ) ranges of applicability , but allows us to proceed analytically ( in the spirit of @xcite ) and to draw some additional conclusions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : rerfd ] we review the re model and rfd closure . the equation deduced from rfd is then integrated numerically in time , and the results are shown in section [ sec : num ] . in section [ sec : exp ] we perform an analytical manipulation of the matrix exponential , expanding it in a power series in @xmath4 , and we show the resulting equations for @xmath3 at the different orders in @xmath4 . in section",
    "[ sec : lin ] we focus on the @xmath4-linear approximation and we deduce a restricted dynamical system . conclusions and perspectives follow in section [ sec : conc ] .",
    "appendix [ sec : app ] shows some details about the random forcing term we use to obtain stationary statistics for the rfd closure .",
    "starting from the navier  stokes equation , @xmath9 ( @xmath10 is the pressure divided by density and @xmath11 the kinematic viscosity ) , it is sufficient to take the gradient ( @xmath12 ) to obtain the evolution equation for the velocity gradient tensor : @xmath13 the incompressibility constraint makes @xmath3 a traceless tensor , @xmath14 , thus reducing its number of independent components from 9 to 8 .    equation ( [ evol ] ) , interpreted in eulerian sense , tells us little more than the original navier  stokes formulation .",
    "the key point consists in reinterpreting it in a lagrangian sense , by considering its left - hand side as a material derivative following a fluid particle",
    ". however , one immediately faces a particular closure problem , because the last two term at its right - hand side ( rhs ) are not known in terms of @xmath3 at the same point and time .",
    "the isotropic part of the pressure hessian can easily be rewritten by using the poisson equation ( obtained from ( [ evol ] ) by taking its trace ) , which allows to express the pressure laplacian as a quadratic term in @xmath3 : @xmath15 .",
    "thus , one obtains : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the ( traceless ) unclosed term for which a suitable model is required in order to express it in terms of @xmath3 and other known quantities .",
    "notice that , if one wants to investigate not the actual velocity field itself , but rather a coarse - grained version of it ( e.g.  in order to study velocity increments , as we will show at the end of section [ sec : lin ] , in the spirit of a large - eddy simulation ( les ) ) , equation ( [ vgt ] ) remains valid , provided one includes the appropriate subgrid terms into @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "the re model takes @xmath19 , i.e.  it completely neglects the effect of viscosity and the anisotropic action of the ( eulerian ) pressure hessian , which are known to play an important role in the regularization and evolution of the turbulent dynamics .",
    "it is therefore not surprising that the re model @xmath20 leads to a finite time singularity .",
    "the rfd closure overcomes the blow - up by introducing four approximations and two time scales , namely a typical decorrelation ( kolmogorov ) time @xmath4 and an integral ( large - eddy turnover ) time @xmath21 .",
    "the closure is based on the mapping between the eulerian position @xmath22 ( at time @xmath23 ) and an initial lagrangian coordinate ( or label ) @xmath24 ( at some earlier time @xmath25 ) .",
    "this map is invertible because of incompressibility , as the jacobian has unit modulus .",
    "we briefly recall the four approximations used to obtain the closure . for more details , see @xcite . + as a first step , when writing second derivatives by means of the chain differentiation rule , one neglects the spatial variations of the jacobian : @xmath26 secondly , the _ lagrangian _ pressure hessian is assumed isotropic ( this is physically more meaningful than the corresponding approximation in re about the isotropy of the _ eulerian _ hessian ) : @xmath27 ( the proportionality prefactor can be found through the poisson equation ) .",
    "moreover , one models the viscous term via an isotropic linear damping with the integral time scale @xmath21 : @xmath28 finally , the crucial step is represented by the parameterization of the well - known cauchy ",
    "green tensor , @xmath29 with an `` on - off approximation '' : @xmath30 i.e. , the actual slow decorrelation of @xmath31 along the lagrangian trajectory is replaced by a perfect correlation only during the kolmogorov time scale @xmath4 and by a complete decorrelation for longer times : in this way , the cumbersome , full time - ordered exponential reduces to a much simpler matrix exponential ( here , the superscript @xmath32 denotes the transposed matrix ) .",
    "the reynolds number ( based on the integral scale ) corresponds to @xmath33 , or in other words the taylor - scale reynolds number behaves as @xmath34 . from ( [ vgt ] ) , using these approximations , and including a stochastic forcing term @xmath35 to enable statistically stationary dynamics , the resulting system is : @xmath36 with @xmath31 given by ( [ cgt ] ) .",
    "notice that the re model corresponds to @xmath37 , such that @xmath38 , with @xmath39 . in what follows",
    ", we will thus try to understand what happens when @xmath4 becomes smaller and smaller , a critical aspect of the rfd closure .    among related approaches to remove the blow - up behavior of re",
    ", we can mention the tetrad model @xcite , the cauchy - green models @xcite , and a multi - scale coupling approach in the spirit of shell models @xcite .",
    "the rfd closure is attractive because of its relative simplicity : it is a system of only 8 independent stochastic ordinary differential equations , based on a physically inspired connection to the pressure hessian .",
    "however , unlike the shell model which allows to be extended to high reynolds numbers by addition of shells , as already mentioned the rfd closure produces unrealistic predictions at increasing reynolds numbers . in @xcite , @xmath40 was the smallest value for which realistic results could be obtained .",
    "the analysis that follows explores the behavior at smaller @xmath4 in detail , in order to provide a basis for possible future improvements of the model .",
    "in this section we present results based on numerical time integration of ( [ rfd ] ) , including the full matrix - exponential expression for @xmath31 . in terms of documenting results from the simulations",
    ", one can follow the evolution of the 9 ( 8 of which independent ) components of @xmath3 individually , e.g.  in order to investigate their time correlations .",
    "one can also represent parts of the relevant dynamics in terms of the two invariants @xmath41 and @xmath42 . in the @xmath5-@xmath6 plane",
    "the zero - discriminant curve @xmath43 is usually called the vieillefosse line ( denoted in the plots as ): the re model is known to diverge on its right - bottom part .    as numerical procedure",
    "we adopt a standard fourth - order runge ",
    "kutta scheme for the time integration , with time step @xmath44 small enough ( always @xmath45 , i.e.  at least one thousandth of the shortest relevant time scale ) . as in @xcite",
    ", we perform a non - dimensionalization of the equations with @xmath21 , thus the only remaining significant parameter is @xmath4 ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "we run the code for a total time @xmath47 ( i.e.  at least one thousand large - eddy turnover times ) , in order to accumulate well - converged statistics . as a first test",
    ", we integrated the equations starting from several initial conditions without forcing ( @xmath39 ) , in order to check that the dynamics properly decay , converging to the origin .    in order to obtain stationary statistics , the tensorial forcing term @xmath35 is introduced on the rhs of ( [ rfd ] ) .",
    "following arguments given in @xcite , this term mimics the effects of neighboring small - scale eddies that affect the velocity gradient in its lagrangian evolution .",
    "we performed some preliminary tests by using a white - in - time random signal ( following @xcite ) , but then we chose to focus on a gaussian , smooth noise , with a finite time correlation @xmath48 .",
    "this time scale will be chosen of the order of @xmath4 itself , because this is the time scale at which the interactions with the other eddies are believed to take place .",
    "a comparison between the two kinds of noise , and thus on the influence of the time correlation , will be made in subsection [ sec : timecorr ] , where various values of @xmath48 ( namely @xmath49 ) will be considered . in appendix",
    "[ sec : app ] we discuss some details of the forcing .    from ( [ cgt ] )",
    "it appears that the tensor @xmath31 will become important once @xmath3 should have order of magnitude @xmath50 .",
    "the quadratic terms on the rhs of ( [ rfd ] ) then suggest that @xmath3 should vary on a characteristic time scale of order @xmath4 .",
    "thus , as a first guess for the scaling of the amplitude of the noise , it was chosen of the order of @xmath51 so that it is comparable to the magnitude of @xmath52 . however , for @xmath53 and smaller , this turned out to be a too strong a forcing amplitude : the forcing overwhelmed the quadratic self - interaction term , resulting in nearly gaussian statistics for @xmath3 . therefore , a more careful procedure must be followed to prescribe the amplitude of the forcing .",
    "we begin by taking the value @xmath54 as a baseline case ( this value was the baseline value also for the prior studies @xcite ) . for this reference case , in @xcite an amplitude of the forcing @xmath55 was used , along with a compensation with the integration time step , due to the white - noise character of the forcing used there .",
    "let us denote the actual amplitude of the forcing @xmath56 .",
    "equation ( [ oup ] ) in the appendix shows how the forcing is generated as function of @xmath56 .",
    "since we wish to compare our results with the ones of @xcite , we also adopt @xmath57 for this reference case .",
    "as shown in appendix [ sec : app ] , @xmath56 is used in ( [ oup ] ) as amplitude of the diffusion term . note that @xmath58 .    as a next step , we consider increasing @xmath8 , and we know that the strength of the forcing ( i.e.  of the action of neighboring eddies ) should increase , but at a rate smaller than @xmath59 , as already explained . an important criterion that the dynamics should follow when increasing @xmath8 is that , for energy dissipation to remain constant at increasing @xmath8 , one should observe that @xmath60 , when @xmath4 is interpreted as the kolmogorov time scale @xcite .",
    "hence , the forcing may be adjusted to generate approximately such scaling . in figure",
    "[ fig : points ] we plot , in logarithmic scale , the response behavior of @xmath61 , multiplied by @xmath4 , as a function of @xmath56 , as obtained from a large number of simulations .    , multiplied by @xmath4 , as a function of the typical noise amplitude @xmath56 , for three different values of @xmath4 .",
    "the two ( approximate ) intercepts with the horizontal line passing through the point representative of the reference case @xmath54 ( for which one only value is clearly plotted , corresponding to @xmath57 ) represent the correct values of @xmath56 which will be used in what follows for the cases @xmath62 and @xmath63 , i.e.  @xmath64 and @xmath65 respectively .",
    "the arrows have been introduced to help the understanding of the procedure .",
    "for every point ( full squares and circles ) , the corresponding couple of empty symbols ( above and below it , in some cases overshadowed ) indicates the minimum and maximum values obtained by subdividing the whole numerical run into 10 equal sub - intervals , and is thus an indication of the statistical uncertainty appearing in the ranges where the increase in amplitudes is very steep . ]",
    "we observe that @xmath66 increases monotonically until a certain forcing strength , and then a sudden increase in amplitude is observed . beyond this transition",
    ", the increase continues less dramatically . following the energy - dissipation - based criterion ( of aiming to reproduce @xmath67 ) , the values @xmath68 and @xmath69 , obtained by finding the approximate intercepts with the horizontal line drawn through the reference - case point , represent the correct amplitudes to be used for @xmath62 and @xmath63 , respectively .",
    "the baseline case of @xmath54 is computed , using a gaussian random forcing with time correlation @xmath70 and with forcing parameter @xmath57 .",
    "the model yields the probability density function for @xmath6 and @xmath5 shown in figure [ fig : m-1 ] , which agrees well with @xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning that , differently from @xcite , here we multiply @xmath6 and @xmath5 by ( the appropriate power of ) @xmath4 , rather than normalizing them with the trace of @xmath71 ^ 2 $ ] .",
    "+ next , we consider the case of @xmath62 ( with @xmath72 , such that @xmath61 becomes 10 times bigger than in the previous case ) and show the results in figure [ fig : m-2 ] .",
    "the shape of the pdf is reasonable , but one should notice that the values of @xmath5 and @xmath6 do not scale with factors @xmath73 and @xmath74 with respect to figure [ fig : m-1 ] , as one would expect from a simple dimensional analysis .",
    "this is a clear indication of the presence of a very intermittent behavior , as we will show in subsection [ sec : timecorr ] . + this observation is confirmed further when plotting the case @xmath75 ( figure [ fig : m-3 ] ) , for which the picture is very similar to the latter case , in the sense that the rescaling of @xmath5 and @xmath6 is much smaller than expected .",

    "one could therefore wonder what happens when the amplitude of the forcing is chosen in a way such as to give results whose orders of magnitude of @xmath6 and @xmath5 are consistent with the expected @xmath81 and @xmath82 scaling . in other words , for @xmath62 we momentarily impose a different value @xmath83 ( @xmath84 ) such that , passing from figure [ fig : m-1 ] to figure [ fig : m2 ] , a rescaling of @xmath4 by one order of magnitude ( @xmath85 ) brings about an approximate rescaling of the quadratic and cubic quantities , @xmath6 and @xmath5 , by factors @xmath74 and @xmath73 respectively .",

    "however , none of them lead to physically meaningful results for small @xmath4 .",

    ". + in figures [ unf-1][unf-2 ] we show the unforced evolution for the full matrix - exponential model and for its linear , quadratic and cubic approximations , starting from a few representative initial conditions in each of the quadrants of the @xmath5-@xmath6 plane . figure [ unf-1 ] shows the resulting time evolution for @xmath54 , for which all these unforced cases converge and decay towards the origin .     and @xmath6 ( multiplied by the appropriate power of @xmath4 ) for the unforced dynamics using the rfd closure with @xmath54 , imposing the full matrix - exponential model or its linear , quadratic and cubic approximations . the four arbitrary initial conditions have been chosen as : ( a ) @xmath129 , such that @xmath130 and @xmath131 ; ( b ) @xmath132 , such that @xmath130 and @xmath133 ; ( c ) @xmath129 ( except for @xmath134 and @xmath135 ) such that @xmath136 and @xmath133 ; ( d ) @xmath129 ( except for @xmath134 and @xmath137 ) such that @xmath136 and @xmath131 ( in all cases we have then redefined @xmath138 ) . ]    for @xmath62 ( figure [ unf-2 ] ) similar results can be obtained , although the weaker restitution term provided by the lower value of @xmath4 allows some excursions along the bottom - right viellefosse tail before the decay towards the origin .     using @xmath62 , but not including case ( d ) , which has not been reproduced to avoid crowding in the figure . ]    these trends also hold at @xmath75 ( not shown ) , also starting from different quadrants , but then numerical instabilities occur if @xmath4 is further reduced , and these can only be avoided if the integration time step is reduced drastically .",
    "the important observation is that , in all of the previous cases , the linear , quadratic and cubic expansions are similar to one another , and provide a good approximation of the full matrix exponential .",
    "therefore , in what follows , we will only focus on the comparison between the linearized model and the full , original one , not focusing on the @xmath128 and @xmath139 approximations .",
    "let us now introduce again our additive forcing term , with a finite correlation time @xmath70 ( according to the framework described in section [ sec : num ] and in appendix [ sec : app ] ) , also on the rhs of ( [ expan ] ) only including the first order in @xmath4 .",
    "+ at @xmath54 , and @xmath57 , the linear approach is basically equivalent to the ( already analyzed ) matrix - exponential one in terms of resulting pdf s , as shown convincingly in figure [ fig:-1 ] .     with both the full matrix - exponential model and its linear approximation shown .",
    "proceeding from the interior outwards , the isolines are for densities of @xmath140 , @xmath141 , @xmath142 and @xmath143 respectively . ]",
    "+ reducing @xmath4 , the simulations with the linear approximation based on the energy - dissipation criterion ( @xmath79 for @xmath62 and @xmath80 for @xmath75 ) are again basically equivalent to the ones from the full matrix exponential shown in figures [ fig : m-2][fig : m-3 ] .",
    "however , if one tries to reproduce the dimensional - scaling - based results of figures [ fig : m2][fig : m3 ] ( @xmath83 for @xmath62 and @xmath86 for @xmath75 ) , simulations with the linear approximation begin to suffer from numerical instabilities , regardless of how small the time step is chosen .",
    "it is therefore not possible to perform detailed numerical comparisons for significantly lower values of @xmath4 . in order to proceed one step further using analytical tools , in the next section",
    ", the evolution equation for the complete set of relevant invariants is studied .",
    "focusing on the `` linearized '' model , derived from ( [ expan ] ) by retaining only up to the first - order terms in @xmath4 , allows us to proceed one step further analytically .",
    "following @xcite , we derive a dynamical system for the five tensor invariants @xmath6 , @xmath5 , @xmath144 , @xmath145 ( already introduced in section [ sec : exp ] ) , and @xmath146 , the latter defined from the strain - vorticity alignment @xmath147 , where @xmath148 is the vorticity vector . notice that @xmath149 by definition , moreover it can easily be shown that @xmath150 , so that the dynamics is confined below the zero - discriminant curve in the @xmath145-@xmath144 plane @xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning that it is not necessary to investigate the antisymmetric counterparts of @xmath144 and @xmath145 , because by definition @xmath151 and @xmath152 @xcite .",
    "starting from the equation for @xmath153 ( without forcing ) and using appropriate contractions and the cayley ",

    "what is most interesting is the fact that the linear `` damping '' terms , which have been factored at the end of each line for the sake of clarity , include terms at @xmath126 .",
    "it is of particular interest to study the sign of the square braces : when they ( or at least one of them ) becomes negative , divergences and blow - ups are likely to occur . however , in all equations except the one for @xmath144 , these terms are positive definite ( in fact larger than 1 ) since @xmath144 is never positive by definition .",
    "the possibility of negative damping is possible in the equation for @xmath144 itself , in which the damping term may become negative when @xmath155 , that is in highly rotating regions when @xmath6 is large and positive .",
    "in fact , the rate of phase - space contraction ( @xmath156 , where @xmath157 is the vector formed by the rhs of ( [ qsrsv ] ) ) is @xmath158 , i.e.  for overall growing solutions one would need @xmath159 , very large rates of rotation . clearly",
    ", however , along the excursions of the system along the vieillefosse tail ( the right - bottom part of the @xmath5-@xmath6 , where the re model is known to diverge ) when @xmath6 is negative , the term provides damping and thus protects against divergencies along this direction .    to obtain a system that generates stationary pdf s it is difficult to introduce random noise properly on the rhs of ( [ qsrsv ] ) .",
    "the difficulty stems from the inherent bounds and internal consistency conditions among the tensor invariants ( e.g.  the limits on @xmath144 and @xmath146 mentioned above ) . simply adding random noise to the equation system [ qsrsv ] quickly leads to @xmath160 or @xmath161 , etc .. introducing a simple , additive random forcing on the rhs of the evolution equation for @xmath3 , @xmath162 , leads to unclosed terms on the rhs of ( [ qsrsv ] ) .",
    "therefore , the analytical study of the invariants is limited to the results presented above .",
    "another set of interesting variables can be constructed by considering the tensor invariants of @xmath3 combined with a material line element @xmath163 being convected by the flow . specifically , following @xcite",
    ", one can introduce @xmath164 ( which can have either sign ) and @xmath165 ( the magnitude of the transverse velocity vector @xmath166 ) .",
    "these two variables represent the longitudinal and transverse velocity increments at a fixed scale @xmath167 , i.e.  between two fixed points with constant separation ( rather than between two material points or fluid particles whose relative distance @xmath168 would change with time ) .",
    "the derivation of a lagrangian time evolution equation for @xmath169 and @xmath170 based on the equations for @xmath3 and @xmath163 leads to the adv system introduced and studied in @xcite . in this prior work",
    ", it was shown that the neglect of viscous and much of the pressure hessian term leads to unphysical behavior of the dynamics .",
    "hence , it is of interest to consider the implications of the rfd closure and its expansions in the context of the adv system .",
    "repeating the relevant derivations @xcite but including the rfd closure expanded to first order in the equation for @xmath3 , one obtains : @xmath171\\delta u\\\\{\\mathrm{d}}_t\\delta v=&\\displaystyle-\\frac{2}{\\ell}\\delta u\\delta v-\\frac{1}{t}\\left[1-\\frac{2}{3}qt\\tau\\right]\\delta v\\\\&\\ + \\frac{2}{3}q\\tau a_{ij}r_i\\delta v_j\\delta v^{-1}\\;.\\end{array}\\right.\\ ] ] while the equation for longitudinal velocity increment is closed ( if @xmath6 is known ) , it is apparent that the equation for transverse velocity increment can not be closed in terms of @xmath169 , @xmath170 and @xmath6 . as shown in @xcite",
    ", parts of the invariant @xmath6 may be expressed directly in terms of @xmath169 , namely @xmath172 , where @xmath173 is composed of terms that may not be expressed in terms of @xmath169 or @xmath170 .",
    "the argument above is useful , since it shows that within the approximation @xmath174 ( as was done in @xcite ) , the added term from the linear expansion of the pressure hessian model is positive damping since @xmath175 , independent of @xmath169 . hence , by setting @xmath174 and neglecting the last term in the equation of the transverse velocity increment",
    ", the following system corresponds to the order @xmath125 rfd closure applied to the adv system ( in three dimensions ) : @xmath176\\delta u\\\\      { \\mathrm{d}}_t\\delta v=&\\displaystyle-\\frac{2}{\\ell}\\delta u\\delta v-\\frac{1}{t}\\left[1+\\frac{4t\\tau}{3\\ell^2}\\delta u^2\\right]\\delta v\\;.     \\end{array }     \\right.\\ ] ]",
    "in this work we have explored several consequences of the rfd closure as applied to modeling pressure hessian and viscous terms for the lagrangian dynamics of the velocity gradient tensor .",
    "consistent with the observations of @xcite , the model is shown to predict unphysical dynamics when attempting to reach high reynolds numbers ( decreasing the time - scale parameter @xmath4 ) .",
    "in particular , for @xmath177 , results quickly deteriorate .",
    "analysis of the time - correlation structure of the solution allowed us to conclude that an inconsistency develops , in which the assumed correlation time scale ( @xmath4 ) becomes much smaller than the actual correlation time scale predicted by the dynamics of the system .",
    "hence , at decreasing @xmath4 , the assumptions underlying the closure are not consistent with the simulated dynamics .",
    "how to `` break '' the observed longer - than - expected time correlations of the system is not clear and requires further study .",
    "increasing the forcing strength was not a solution to the problem .",
    "in fact , a number of experiments were performed and in no case was it possible to obtain physically realistic predictions at high reynolds number for @xmath177 .",
    "we must tentatively conclude that it may be impossible for a `` single - shell '' model in which only the dynamics at the smallest scales ( largest velocity gradients ) are computed dynamically to provide accurate predictions at arbitrarily high reynolds numbers .",
    "as @xmath8 grows , it may be impossible to describe the dynamics with only 8 independent degrees of freedom , even though it is already remarkable that at moderate @xmath8 such a system is able to reproduce many features of turbulence @xcite .",
    "this was the motivation for proposing a shell model @xcite that included additional degrees of freedom .    with the aim at improving our understanding of the dynamical effects of the recent fluid deformation closure ,",
    "an expansion into powers of the small parameter ( correlation time scale ) was performed .",
    "it showed to be a good approximation , at least for @xmath178 .",
    "it allowed to show that , to first order , the rfd model for the pressure hessian is a dissipative `` damping '' term for most of the tensor invariant s time evolution , except for the second invariant of the strain - rate tensor in regions of high rotation .",
    "that is also the region in which direct comparisons with dns in @xcite showed significant inaccuracies of the closure .",
    "the effect of the linearized rfd closure for the pressure hessian was shown to lead to a positive ( dissipative ) damping in the adv equations ( [ linadv ] ) for longitudinal and transverse velocity increments . for future efforts",
    ", it would be of interest to study the properties of this simple system of equations .",
    "in particular , one may want to develop stochastic forcing for the system in order to test whether it may yield realistic stationary statistics for longitudinal and transverse velocity increments in turbulence .",
