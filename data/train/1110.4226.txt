    "the observed global properties of galaxies obey a diverse set of scaling relations , which are fundamental tools to constrain models of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "particularly interesting are the correlations between dynamics and luminosity / stellar mass or size , such as the tully - fisher ( tf ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) relation for spirals , and the faber - jackson ( fj ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , @xmath4-@xmath5 @xcite , or fundamental plane ( fp ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) relations for spheroids , because they link the luminous to the total mass of galaxies , thus providing insights into the interplay between their baryonic and dark matter components .",
    "historically , the importance of the tight tf and fp relations as secondary distance indicators has driven the community to assemble galaxy samples that meet strict selection criteria , in order to minimize systematic errors and scatter . while fp studies targeted elliptical and s0 galaxies , the samples used for tf applications have typically been restricted to late - type spirals with inclinations to the line - of - sight larger than 30 - 40 , preferably observed in red or infrared photometric bands to minimize extinction effects ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these data sets are not ideal for characterizing the statistical properties of galaxies in general , because the excessive pruning means that they are not fair samples of the local universe .",
    "this issue is particularly problematic for the comparison with theoretical studies and numerical simulations of galaxy formation and evolution , which should be based on representative samples .",
    "for instance , tf studies of different classes of objects , such as s0s and early - type spirals ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , polar ring galaxies @xcite , barred spirals @xcite , and gas - rich dwarfs @xcite , have sometimes found disagreement with the tf relation of late - type spirals .",
    "most notably , gas - rich dwarfs lie systematically below the tf relation defined by bright galaxies .    during the last decades",
    ", the interest in tf and fj - like scaling relations has shifted from cosmic flow applications to constraining galaxy formation models , and samples with broader morphological properties have been constructed specifically for this purpose ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , current large and homogeneous data sets include either spirals ( e.g. , in addition to the works mentioned above , @xcite and @xcite , hereafter ss11 ) or early - type galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ".    there have been attempts to move beyond the spiral / elliptical dichotomy , and uncover relations between stellar content and dynamics that hold for all galaxies , independent of morphology .",
    "@xcite found that all galaxies , from disks to spheroids and from dwarf spheroidals to giant ellipticals , lie on a two - dimensional surface defined by surface brightness , half - light radius , internal velocity and mass - to - light ratio .",
    "as a measure of internal velocity @xmath6 , they adopt either the rotational velocity @xmath7  for disks or the velocity dispersion @xmath5 for spheroids , thus the two types of systems are still treated separately ( especially because the sample is a large but heterogeneous collection of published data sets , for which either @xmath7  or @xmath5 is available ) .",
    "it is also important to point out that the search for scaling relations that are valid for all types of galaxies should make use of _ baryonic _ masses ( i.e. , the sum of stellar and gas masses ) instead of luminosities or stellar masses , because they could be more fundamental quantities .",
    "this is demonstrated by the fact that baryonic scaling relations hold for subsets of galaxies that do not follow the corresponding stellar relations .",
    "for example , the offset of the gas - rich dwarf galaxies from the stellar tf relation disappears when their gas mass is taken into account @xcite . the baryonic tf relation ( btf ; * ? ? ? * ) is linear over 5 orders of magnitude in ( stellar + gas ) mass , suggesting that the tf is fundamentally a relation between baryonic ( rather than luminous ) and total mass of the galaxy .",
    "intriguingly , although supported by limited statistics , there is some evidence that giant and dwarf ellipticals might lie on the same btf as the spirals @xcite . unfortunately",
    ", because they require estimates of both stellar and gas masses , btf samples ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are significantly smaller than tf ones .    to summarize , it is still unclear if disk - dominated galaxies and spheroids obey the same dynamical scaling relations , mainly due to the lack of well - defined , representative samples of galaxies for which both rotation and stellar dispersion are measured . certainly , ellipticals might have no gas and",
    "no detectable rotation , and pure disks might have negligible stellar dispersions , but a significant fraction of local galaxies ( especially massive ones ) have a disk _ and _ a bulge ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the dynamical scaling relations should account for the smooth transition across galaxies with different bulge - to - disk ratios .",
    "as @xcite point out , a connection between the scaling relations of early - type and late - type galaxies is expected on the grounds that early - type systems are generally assumed to form through mergers of late - type ones .",
    "this is especially true at the high stellar mass end , where the blue sequence of star - forming disks merges onto the red sequence of passively - evolving , bulge - dominated galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the systems typically host a bulge and a disk .    in this paper , we investigate dynamical scaling relations for a representative sample of @xmath0500 massive galaxies that are selected _ only _ by stellar mass ( @xmath8 m@xmath2 ) and redshift ( @xmath3 ) , as part of the ongoing galex arecibo sdss survey ( gass ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , nuv@xmath9  colours from galex @xcite and sdss imaging , and hi  masses and rotational velocities for the subset of objects detected at 21 cm with the arecibo radio telescope . this unique sample , which includes massive galaxies of all morphological types , allows us to investigate how objects that are typically not included in tf or fj / fp data sets scatter around those relations . in the spirit of works like those of @xcite and @xcite",
    ", we wish to establish if there is a _",
    "fundamental _ correlation between baryonic mass and dynamics that is obeyed by the complete galaxy population , regardless of morphology .",
    "we show that , at least for the massive galaxies in our sample , such a relation does exist , and has a scatter smaller than 0.1 dex , comparable to that of the tf and fj relations applied to their respective pruned subsets .",

    "we summarize sample selection and measurements of relevant quantities in   [ s_sample ] .",
    "we present the baryonic mass - velocity relations , starting with the tf and fj , in ",

    "the sample used in this work is drawn from gass , an on - going survey which is gathering high - quality hi - line spectra for @xmath01000 massive galaxies , selected only by stellar mass ( greater than @xmath14 m@xmath2 ) and redshift ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "the gass targets are located within the intersection of the footprints of the sdss primary spectroscopic survey , the projected galex medium imaging survey and the on - going hi  blind arecibo legacy fast alfa ( alfalfa ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) survey .",
    "the galaxies are observed with the arecibo radio telescope until detected or until a gas fraction limit of @xmath16% is reached . for more details",
    "we refer the reader to paper i , where the first gass data release ( dr1 ) is presented .    here ,",
    "in addition to the dr1 data ( 176 galaxies ) , we use new arecibo observations of 240 galaxies that will be incorporated in the second gass data release ( catinella et al . , in preparation ) .",
    "as discussed in paper i , gass does not re - observe objects with good hi  detections already available from the alfalfa survey or the cornell hi  archive ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter s05 ) . to correct the gass sample for its lack of hi - rich objects , we add galaxies from alfalfa and s05 in the correct proportions , following the procedure detailed in section 7.2 of paper i. the sample thus obtained , which is representative in terms of hi  properties , includes 480 galaxies ( 296 detections and 184 non - detections ) .",
    "as explained below , we discard 44 galaxies for which the stellar velocity dispersion is not reliable .",
    "the final sample includes 436 galaxies ( 259 detections and 177 non - detections ) .",
    "as mentioned in paper i , the optical parameters are obtained from queries to the sdss dr7 @xcite data base server , unless otherwise noted .",
    "stellar masses are derived from sdss photometry using the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) fitting technique described in @xcite , assuming a @xcite initial mass function .",
    "a variety of model seds from the @xcite library are fitted to each galaxy , building a probability distribution for its stellar mass .",
    "the mean and the width of this distribution are used as measurements of the stellar mass and its formal error , respectively . over the interval probed by gass ,",
    "stellar masses are believed to be accurate to better than 30 per cent . as a measure of galaxy size",
    "we adopt @xmath17 , i.e.  half the 25 mag arcsec@xmath18 isophote diameter @xmath19 ( measured by us on the sdss _",
    "g_-band images ) , in kpc .",
    "the baryonic mass is the sum of stars and gas ; the latter is computed from the hi  mass , adopting the standard 1.4 correction factor to account for helium and metals , i.e.   @xmath20 .",
    "this correction neglects the contribution of the molecular hydrogen . in our stellar mass regime ,",
    "the amount of @xmath21 does not depend significantly on @xmath22  or concentration index and , on average , @xmath23 ( but with a large scatter , 0.41 dex ; @xcite ) .",
    "since the contribution of the hi  to the baryonic mass is , for our sample , typically small ( see   [ s_btf ] ) , it is safe to neglect the @xmath21 ( but we did check that including the molecular gas does not change our results ) .",
    "we set the hi  masses of the non - detections to zero , but we note that using the upper limits ( which correspond to 1.5 - 5% of the stellar mass by survey design ) would make no difference to our plots .",
    "other parameters used in this work are discussed below .",
    "hi  line widths from gass , alfalfa and the s05 archive are measured with the same technique , at the 50% of each peak level ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , the corrections applied to the raw measurements , as originally published , are different .",
    "gass and s05 widths are corrected for both instrumental broadening and cosmological redshift , whereas alfalfa widths are corrected for instrumental broadening only , following equation  1 in @xcite .",
    "no turbulent motion or inclination corrections are applied . for convenience , we report here the corrections adopted : @xmath24 @xmath25 where @xmath26  is the measured velocity width , @xmath27 is the galaxy redshift , and @xmath28  is the instrumental broadening correction , which differs for the three sources .",
    "for gass paper i and alfalfa , @xmath28  is simply the final velocity resolution of the spectrum after smoothing ( i.e. , between 5 and 21 km  s@xmath13  for gass spectra , which are hanning and boxcar smoothed , and @xmath010 km  s@xmath13  for alfalfa spectra , which are hanning smoothed only ) . for s05 ,",
    "@xmath28  equals @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the channel separation in km  s@xmath13  and @xmath31 is a complex function of signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) and type of smoothing applied . for high snr , hanning - smoothed spectra with @xmath32 km  s@xmath13  ( i.e. , the alfalfa case ) , @xmath33 ,",
    "thus @xmath28  is of order of half the velocity resolution after smoothing .",
    "this is smaller than the correction adopted for gass in paper i , and larger than the alfalfa one , where the subtraction in quadrature makes the correction negligible ( i.e. , @xmath34 km  s@xmath13 ) for velocity widths larger than 50 km  s@xmath13 .",
    "the issue of homogenizing velocity widths obtained from different sources has been discussed in the past , and most recently by @xcite for the extragalactic distance database @xcite , a large compilation of data for galaxy distance and peculiar motion studies .",
    "we follow @xcite , who adopt a simplified version of the s05 solution , i.e. : @xmath35 , where @xmath36 and @xmath37 is the final velocity resolution of the spectrum after smoothing ( this is half the correction adopted in paper i ) .",
    "this is in better agreement with our own tests on high snr gass hi  profiles , where the smoothing was gradually increased and the width remeasured .",
    "thus , we keep the s05 widths as published , we adopt the new @xmath28  correction for the gass data , and we uncorrect the alfalfa widths , @xmath38 , to obtain the raw @xmath26  measurements , then apply the same @xmath28  and @xmath39 corrections adopted for gass galaxies .",
    "lastly , we deproject all velocity widths to edge - on view .",
    "the inclination to the line - of - sight is computed from : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the minor - to - major axis ratio from the _ r_-band  exponential fit ( _ expab_r _ in the sdss database ) , and @xmath42 is the intrinsic axial ratio of a galaxy seen edge - on .",
    "we adopt @xmath43 ( @xcite ; see also , e.g.  @xcite ) , and set the inclination to 90  for galaxies with @xmath44 .",
    "the value of @xmath43 applies to galaxies of morphological type earlier than sbc , whereas @xmath45 should be used for sbc and later spirals ( e.g.  @xcite ; ss11 ) .",
    "however the difference is small , and our choice of @xmath42 seems appropriate for a sample of massive galaxies that was not selected for tf studies .",
    "thus , rotational velocities are computed as : @xmath46 where @xmath37 is the final velocity resolution of the spectrum after smoothing .",
    "as noted in paper i , the hi  masses of galaxies in the alfalfa and s05 archives have been recomputed from the tabulated fluxes , in order to be made consistent with gass ones .",
    "we identified 31 galaxies for which hi  confusion within the @xmath04  arecibo beam is certain , and therefore the measured hi  parameters should not be trusted .",
    "specifically , we closely inspected the sdss images of all the galaxies in our sample , and flagged as `` confused '' those with at least one late - type , similar size companion ( based on sdss spectroscopy , i.e. with redshift available and within 0.002 of that of the target galaxy ) within the beam .",
    "these objects will be highlighted in our analysis when needed .",
    "galaxy velocity dispersions are measured by fitting stellar templates convolved with gaussian functions to sdss spectra , which are obtained through 3-diameter fiber apertures . because the fiber covers only a fraction of the galaxy light at the gass redshifts , these quantities ( catalogued as _",
    "veldisp _ in the sdss spectroscopic data base , and here referred to as @xmath47 ) need to be corrected for aperture effects . as commonly done ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , fiber velocity dispersions are corrected to 1/8 effective radius as follows : @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 is the circular galaxy radius in arcseconds , computed as @xmath51 ( @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the effective radius and axis ratio from the _ r_-band  de vaucouleurs fit , respectively ) .",
    "this correction is small , @xmath03% on average , for the galaxies in our sample .",
    "only values of @xmath47 above the @xmath070 km  s@xmath13  instrumental resolution of the sdss spectra are considered reliable .",
    "we thus discarded 44 galaxies that do not meet this requirement from our sample ; the effect of this restriction on the stellar mass distribution of the sample is shown in figure  [ mstar ] .    that are not included in our analysis.,width=264 ]",
    "the main goal of this work is to establish if there is a relation between baryonic mass and a measure of the dynamical mass ( estimated based on rotational velocity , stellar dispersion or a combination of the two ) that is obeyed by massive galaxies _ regardless of their morphology_.    we begin by comparing the baryonic tf ( btf ) and baryonic fj ( bfj ) relations for our sample , in order to establish which quantity , the hi  rotational velocity or the stellar dispersion , most reliably traces the baryonic mass of massive galaxies .",
    "thanks to its unique selection by stellar mass and redshift only , the gass sample includes massive galaxies of all morphological types , and it is thus ideal for this comparison . indeed , this is not a sample designed for either tf or fj studies , but we can prune it to separately study inclined , disk - dominated and spheroidal , bulge - dominated systems .",
    "most importantly , we can investigate outliers and residuals of the btf and bfj relations , which is essential in order to determine how to bring disks and spheroids onto the same relation .",
    "we conclude by illustrating two different ways of obtaining a baryonic relation that holds for all the massive galaxies in our sample , and whose dispersion is comparable to that of the btf and bfj relations .          here we must restrict our sample to galaxies with hi  detections , for which the rotational velocity can be measured .",
    "the btf relation for this sample is shown in figure  [ btf]a .",
    "we note that , for our interval of stellar masses , the contribution of the gas to the baryonic mass is generally small  if we plotted stellar instead of baryonic masses , most of the points would move downward by an amount comparable to the symbol size ( indeed , there are only 13 galaxies in our sample with gas fractions @xmath54/@xmath22@xmath55 ) .",
    "we plot the btf as usually done ( i.e. , baryonic mass versus rotational velocity ) , but we fit the inverse relation , since the scatter is clearly associated to the @xmath7-coordinate ( as can be seen by comparing figures  [ btf]a and [ btf]b , explained below ) .",
    "the inverse fit to the data points , i.e.log @xmath7= a log ( @xmath22 + 1.4 @xmath54 ) + b , is shown as a dotted line and [ t2_fits ] list the expression of the fit , the scatter , and the number of galaxies contributing to the sample for all the main relations discussed in this work . ] .",
    "following ss11 , we compute the scatter in the @xmath56 variable around the best fit by applying tukey s bi - weight , which yields a robust estimate of the dispersion in presence of outliers ; the scatter ( in dex of velocity ) is noted at the bottom of the panel .",
    "also shown is the relation obtained by @xcite over nearly 5 orders of magnitude of baryonic mass ( solid line ) , which is in excellent agreement with our data .",
    "not surprisingly , the scatter around the best fit is large for our data set ( 0.127 dex ) , and discarding galaxies with confused hi  spectra ( magenta symbols ; see   [ s_hiwidths ] ) improves it only by a small amount ( 0.112 dex ) .",
    "however , we recover a significantly tighter relation when we prune the sample as usually done for tf studies .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ btf]b , where a _ tf subset _ was obtained by selecting non - confused , disk - dominated , inclined galaxies ( i.e. , objects with concentration index @xmath57@xmath58 and inclination @xmath59 ; the scatter of the btf for this subset is 0.076 dex ) .",
    "we inspected the three low - velocity outliers that stand out on the left of the plot .",
    "two of them are galaxies for which the sdss inclination is clearly overestimated ( we measured 17  and 26  instead of 46  and 49 , respectively ) , and the third one has uncertain hi  velocity width . removing these outliers ,",
    "the scatter of the relation becomes 0.072 dex .",
    "how does this compare with the scatter of other tf samples ? there is a vast literature on the tf relation , showing that its scatter depends on the sample analyzed , velocity indicator , photometric band , and type of fit performed ( forward , inverse , bisector or orthogonal ) .",
    "@xcite studied the btf relation using a sample of 60 galaxies with extended hi  rotation curves , and obtained a scatter of 0.191 dex in solar masses from a direct fit ( this is the average scatter for the relations marked as @xmath60 in his table 2 , where the stellar masses are computed using stellar population synthesis models as we do ) . for comparison ,",
    "a direct fit to the data in figure  [ btf]b ( excluding the three low - velocity outliers mentioned above ) yields a scatter of 0.221 dex in solar masses .",
    "a study that is directly comparable to ours is that of @xcite , who measured a scatter of 0.06 dex in velocity for the btf of a sample of 76 non - interacting disk galaxies , with inclinations @xmath61 and flat rotation curves ( see also , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "given the crude selection of our tf subset ( by concentration index ) , our sample is likely to include a broader range of disk galaxy types , thus the slightly larger scatter compared to these studies is not unexpected .    figure  [ btf]c demonstrates that the high - velocity outliers of the btf relation are all galaxies with small inclination to the line - of - sight . for these systems ,",
    "the corrected rotational velocities become so unreliable that the correlation with baryonic mass effectively disappears .",
    "once galaxies with inclination smaller than 40  are removed from the sample , even bulge - dominated objects lie reasonably close to the relation obtained for disk - dominated ones , although with larger scatter ( empty circles in fig .",
    "[ btf]d ) .",
    "this agrees qualitatively with the findings of @xcite , based on a compilation of 792 galaxies with inclination larger than 30  and heterogeneous measurements from hyperleda @xcite .",
    "indeed , ho showed that a @xmath62-band tf relation exists for all hubble types , including elliptical and s0 galaxies ( although these represent a very small fraction of his sample ) .",
    "figure  [ btf]c also shows a population of low - velocity outliers that can not be explained by small inclinations : these are galaxies with rotational velocities that are smaller than the stellar velocity dispersions ( red symbols ) . we note that @xcite also identifies a population of galaxies with unusually small @xmath63ratios , which are outliers in his tf relation . except for their small rotational velocities compared to their central stellar velocity dispersions , his outliers are otherwise normal luminous galaxies .",
    "these systems might be very interesting  ho argues that a significant fraction of their hi  gas must be dynamically unrelaxed , having been acquired through a minor merger episode or perhaps cold accretion . for our sample ,",
    "the fraction of low @xmath63  outliers is smaller ( @xmath05% , against 17% for ho s sample ) .",
    "as shown in the appendix , where these galaxies are described in more detail , most of them have asymmetric hi  profiles , suggesting that the hi  distribution and/or kinematics might be disturbed ( although we can not prove that the gas was externally accreted ) .",
    "lastly , here and in other figures of this paper we highlight the positions of two interesting galaxies that were discussed in our previous works , gass 3505 and 35981 ( marked as a red and a blue star in fig .",
    "[ btf]a ) .",
    "these are both unusually hi - rich systems , which are outliers in the gas fraction plane discussed in paper i ( relating the hi  mass fraction to stellar mass surface density @xmath64  and nuv@xmath9  color ) .",
    "however , gass 3505 is an early - type system , whereas gass 35981 ( ugc 8802 ) is a disk galaxy with a sharp metallicity drop in its outer disk , which suggests an external origin for the hi  gas ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) . as can be seen , from a dynamical point of view gass 35981 is not unusual , whereas gass 3505 is still an outlier .",
    "we now investigate how the residuals of the btf relation depend on a few representative galaxy parameters .",
    "the left column of figure  [ residuals ] shows the btf residuals for the sample in figure  [ btf]a with respect to the best inverse fit obtained for the _ tf subset _ in figure  [ btf]b . in other words ,",
    "residuals are computed as @xmath65 , where @xmath56 is the measured rotational velocity and @xmath66 is the value expected from our best btf relation for a galaxy with the same baryonic mass .",
    "cyan filled circles indicate objects with inclination smaller than 40 . from top to bottom , residuals are plotted as functions of concentration index , inclination , nuv@xmath9  color , stellar mass surface density , gas fraction , and distance from the gas fraction plane mentioned above and described in paper i ( galaxies more hi - rich than the average have positive distance ) , respectively .",
    "btf residuals do not exhibit strong dependence on structural and star - forming galaxy properties , except for a mild tendency toward increased scatter for more bulge - dominated , red galaxies , which largely disappears when the systems with low inclinations are removed from the sample .",
    "this is not surprising , as many attempts to identify a third parameter to minimize the scatter of the tf relation produced negative results ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the results presented in this section show that the btf is not very promising for our purpose of determining a relation between baryonic and dynamical mass that holds for all massive galaxies .",
    "firstly , its application is restricted to galaxies with hidetections and inclinations larger than 40 .",
    "secondly , the bulge - dominated systems with hi  detections are not simply offset from the relation defined by the disk - dominated galaxies , but are also more scattered .",
    "as demonstrated in the following two sections , the bfj relation does not suffer from these limitations , and can be generalized to include both disk - dominated and spheroidal systems .",
    "we now carry out a similar analysis for the bfj relation .",
    "since all the galaxies have a measurement of the stellar velocity dispersion from sdss , we can use here the full sample , but it is instructive to keep hi  detections and non - detections separated . in figure  [ bfj ]",
    "the baryonic mass is plotted as a function of the stellar velocity dispersion , and green upside - down triangles indicate galaxies that were not detected with arecibo .",
    "the relation plotted for the full gass sample ( panel a ) shows a clear segregation between hi  detections and non - detections , the former being offset towards lower values of velocity dispersion .",
    "the gas - rich elliptical gass 3505 ( red star ) is not unusual in terms of its stellar dispersion ( gass 35981 is not plotted because it has @xmath67 km  s@xmath13 ) .",
    "we recover a tighter relation when we restrict our sample to the _ fj subset _",
    "( panel b ) , which includes bulge - dominated galaxies ( i.e. , objects with @xmath57@xmath68 ) with inclinations smaller than 70 .",
    "we excluded from the subset highly flattened systems because these are likely to host a significant disk component , despite their high concentration index .",
    "the 26 bulge - dominated galaxies excluded by our inclination cut are shown as filled symbols in figure  [ bfj]c .",
    "these are mostly hi  detections , which already suggests that they are more likely to be disks than oblate spheroids .",
    "their sdss images ( figure  [ bfj_edgeons ] ) confirm that they are inclined disks , often with dust lanes running along their major axis .",
    "as demonstrated by the bottom panels of figure  [ bfj ] , disk - dominated galaxies are systematically offset from the best fit relation obtained for the data points in panel ( b ) , and they are mostly hi  detections .",
    "these objects have low stellar velocity dispersions for fixed baryonic mass , thus they increase the scatter of the fj relation when they are plotted together with the bulge - dominated galaxies .",
    "a.,width=302 ]    because fj studies usually do not include the gas component , we check our results by considering the _ stellar _ fj relation . in particular , we compared our fj relation with the one obtained for a large sample of sdss galaxies by @xcite , which is conveniently expressed in terms of stellar masses . the slope and scatter of our fj relation ( restricted to the _ fj subset _ )",
    "are in remarkable agreement with those published by @xcite ( both relations have a scatter of 0.071 dex ) , whereas the zero points differ by 0.17 dex in solar masses .",
    "the @xcite sample includes galaxies with concentration index @xmath69 , redshift @xmath70 , and whose sdss spectra have a median signal - to - noise per pixel greater than 20 .",
    "removing our inclination cut does not bring the zero points of the two relations into agreement ( the offset is still 0.14 dex ) .",
    "however , @xcite note that their stellar masses are systematically larger than those derived by @xcite ( and adopted here ) by @xmath00.1 dex , thus our results are completely consistent .",
    "lastly , we notice that adding the gas to the stellar mass slightly increases the scatter of the relation ( from 0.071 dex for the fj to 0.074 dex for the bfj ) .",
    "this is because the most hi - rich galaxies in our sample ( see for instance the blue points in fig .  [ bfj]d ) become even further displaced from the hi  non - detections , which constitute the bulk of the _",
    "fj subset_. a relation with similar scatter is obtained when , instead of restricting the sample to bulge - dominated systems , we consider only the bulge component itself .",

    "the relation between bulge mass and stellar velocity dispersion plotted in figure  [ mbulge ] has a scatter of 0.075 dex in velocity , comparable to that of the fj and bfj relations applied to the fj subset ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . incidentally , it is somewhat surprising that we can recover such a tight relation given the uncertainties in our crude b / t estimate .",
    "we now focus again on the _ baryonic _ fj relation presented in figure  [ bfj ] and study its residuals .",
    "the bfj residuals are plotted as functions of @xmath57 , inclination , nuv@xmath9  color , stellar mass surface density , gas fraction and distance from gas fraction plane on the right column of figure  [ residuals ] . as for the btf , these are the residuals for the sample in figure  [ bfj]a with respect to the best fit relation in figure  [ bfj]b , computed as described in   [ s_btf ] ( where @xmath56 is now stellar velocity dispersion ) . as in all the figures in this paper , green upside - down triangles indicate hi  non - detections .",
    "interestingly , bfj residuals show clear trends with concentration index , nuv@xmath9  color , @xmath64 , and gas fraction , in the sense that more disky , gas - rich and star - forming galaxies have larger residuals . a similar trend is seen as a function of d@xmath724000 index , which is an indicator of the age of the stellar population sampled by the sdss 3-diameter fiber ( larger residuals are seen for smaller values of d@xmath724000 , not shown ) .",
    "it is well known that the fj relation for elliptical galaxies is a projection of a more general fundamental plane @xcite , which is usually parametrized in terms of stellar velocity dispersion , effective radius @xmath73 , and luminosity or surface brightness ( central , or average within @xmath73 ) .",
    "thus , one might expect to see a dependence of the fj residuals on a third parameter related to @xmath73 .",
    "however , the trends in figure  [ residuals ] are _ not _ a consequence of the fundamental plane .",
    "firstly , our sample does not include only elliptical galaxies and spheroids .",
    "as can be seen by inspecting figure  [ residuals ] , the trends are driven by the disk - dominated , star - forming galaxies .",
    "secondly , quantities such as @xmath57 , nuv@xmath9  color or gas fraction are not directly related to an effective radius .",
    "the comparison of the btf and bfj relations for our sample of massive galaxies illustrates several important points : ( a ) the bfj is significantly less scattered than the btf when the relations are applied to their maximum sample . when the two relations are applied to their respective `` good '' , morphologically - pruned subsets , the scatter in both is almost identical .",
    "( b ) the bfj is insensitive to the inclination problems that plague the btf , which can be applied only to systems with inclination larger than 40 .",
    "furthermore , stellar dispersions are measured also for galaxies without hi  detections . naturally , one could measure rotational velocities with other tracers and methods , e.g. , with @xmath74rotation curves .",
    "however , these have their own sets of problems ( for instance , @xmath74  emission is typically significantly less extended than hiemission , thus it may not trace the full rotational velocity . moreover , it is unclear at which spatial position the rotational velocity should be measured .",
    "see , e.g. , @xcite ) , and the inclination issue remains .",
    "( c ) most importantly , and contrary to the btf case , the bfj residuals show systematic trends with other galaxy properties .",
    "as shown in figures  [ residuals ] and [ bfj ] , disk - dominated galaxies do not form a scatter plot in the bfj plane , but they systematically deviate from the main relation defined by the bulge - dominated systems .",
    "one might wonder if , for disk - dominated , inclined galaxies , @xmath5 is strongly affected by rotation . in other words ,",
    "the bfj for highly inclined disks ( figure  [ bfj]c and [ bfj]d ) could just be a tf relation in disguise . from the average rotation curves of disk galaxies of @xcite , we estimated that the typical rotational velocity reached at 1.5  by gass objects is @xmath0100 km  s@xmath13   ( but could be up to twice as large for the most luminous and/or most distant galaxies in our sample ) magnitudes into cousins @xmath75 magnitudes following @xcite , and adopted @xmath76 , the radius containing 90% of the petrosian flux in the sdss @xmath77-band , as a proxy for the optical radius @xmath78 , which is the radius encompassing 83% of the total _ i_-band  light of the galaxy . the average _",
    "i_-band  absolute magnitude for our sample is @xmath7122.35 mag , and the average coverage of the sdss fiber radius is 14% @xmath78 . ] .",
    "however , this does not take inclination and bulge - to - disk ratio within the aperture into account .",
    "most importantly , the fiber measurements are intensity - weighted , thus most of the disk stars contributing to the dispersion are those closer to the galaxy center , where @xmath7  is negligible . thus we conclude that @xmath5 measurements are not significantly affected by contamination from disk stars in circular orbits .    in summary ,",
    "the sdss stellar velocity dispersions provide an estimate of dynamical mass that  at least in the stellar mass and redshift regime probed by gass  is not only more generally applicable ( i.e. , not limited to inclined galaxies with hi  detections or with extended @xmath74  rotation curves ) , but also less affected by measurement problems ( which are largely responsible for the btf outliers ) compared to @xmath7 .",
    "moreover , the fact that the disk - dominated galaxies follow a bfj relation that is simply offset from that of the bulge - dominated systems suggests a simple way of bringing the two onto the same relation .",
    "this is accomplished in the next section .    shown in figure  [ residuals ] ( top right panel ) . as in other figures ,",
    "hi  non - detections are indicated as green triangles.,width=302 ]      spheroids and disk - dominated galaxies can be brought onto the same bfj - like relation by correcting the velocity dispersions for the trends observed in figure  [ residuals ] .",
    "the tightest dependencies of the bfj residuals are seen as a function of nuv@xmath9  color and concentration index . although the correlation with nuv@xmath9  is slightly tighter ( the dispersion of the linear fit is 0.073 dex ) , we decided to correct for the dependence on @xmath57 , which is a galaxy structural parameter .",
    "in fact , it is reasonable to expect larger corrections for more disk - dominated objects , where rotation is likely to be the main contributor to dynamical support .",
    "on the other hand , nuv@xmath9  color is linked to the star formation properties of the galaxy , thus the rationale for correcting velocity dispersions based on this quantity is much less evident . moreover , a correction based on nuv@xmath9  has the additional disadvantage of requiring uv photometry .",

    "we thus corrected the velocity dispersions @xmath81 of all the galaxies in our sample by subtracting the offset @xmath82 .",
    "the bfj relation obtained using the corrected velocity dispersions is plotted in figure  [ bfj_corr ] .",
    "the inverse fit is almost indistinguishable from that of figure  [ bfj]b , and has a scatter of 0.079 dex ( the scatter in solar masses , obtained from a direct fit , is 0.218 dex ) .",
    "this relation holds for all the galaxies in our sample , regardless of morphology , inclination or gas content , and is the main result of this work .",
    "we compared our results with the simulations performed by @xcite , which follow the formation of eight milky way - mass halos in a @xmath83-cold dark matter cosmology , including baryonic physics ( star formation , metal cooling , chemical enrichment , multiphase gas , thermal feedback from supernovae ) .",
    "for these simulated galaxies we can measure stellar and cold gas masses , and stellar velocity dispersions at a given radius , and calculate concentration indices ( from the ratio of the radii enclosing 90% and 50% of the total luminosity ; we used _",

    "we estimate total masses and luminosities within 10 kpc ( the mean value of @xmath84 for the galaxies in the gass sample ) , and obtain luminosity - weighted stellar velocity dispersions within 1.5 kpc ( the physical size subtended by a 1.5  radius at z=0.05 ) . using the concentration indices , we correct the stellar dispersions according to equation  [ eq_modsigma ] .",
    "the results are illustrated in figure  [ bfj_10kpc ] , where we compare the positions of the simulated galaxies ( red stars ) with those of the fj subset on the bfj plane ( a ) .",
    "the residuals from the bfj fit are plotted as a function of @xmath57  in ( b ) , and the generalized bfj relation is shown in ( c ) .",
    "the simulated galaxies are all disk - dominated according to our definition ( i.e. , @xmath85 ) except one , and their stellar dispersions are systematically offset from the fit in ( a ) towards smaller values , as the disk galaxies in the gass sample are .",
    "the correction applied to their stellar dispersions removes the offset , and the simulated galaxies lie on top of the relation in ( c ) .",
    "although it is based on eight halos only , the excellent agreement between simulations and data is encouraging .",
    "we have shown that disk - dominated galaxies are offset in the bfj plane , and that this is what allow us to obtain a tight baryonic mass - velocity relation that holds for all the galaxies in our sample .",
    "the reason why there is a _ disk _ bfj relation for massive galaxies is that @xmath5 is proportional to @xmath7 , and their ratio is a function of galaxy morphology . as demonstrated by @xcite , for a given @xmath7 , earlier type galaxies have higher @xmath5 .",
    "the brightest , bulge - dominated galaxies ( ellipticals , lenticulars and early - type spirals ) lie on the @xmath86 relation expected for isothermal stellar systems . later - type spiral and dwarf galaxies , on the other hand , depart from the isothermal relation by an amount that depends on morphology or total light concentration ( see their fig .  1 ) .",
    "we plot the relation between @xmath7  and @xmath5 for the hi - detected gass galaxies in figure  [ vsigma ] .",

    "in the previous section , we obtained a relation between baryonic mass and a measure of internal velocity that holds for our sample of massive galaxies , without any morphological pruning .",
    "we now ask whether we can find an even tighter relation by combining @xmath7  and @xmath5 measurements .",
    "both quantities measure the depth of the gravitational potential well of a galaxy , but they do so at different radii , namely those of the bulge and of the outer disk ( as traced by the hi  gas , which typically extends well beyond the stellar disk ; however in very high - density environments hi  could be severely stripped ; e.g. , @xcite ) . in principle , hi  widths should provide the best measurement of the total mass ( including dark ) of a galaxy , regardless of the presence of a bulge component .",
    "however , as discussed above , reliable @xmath7  measurements are not possible for galaxies with small inclination to the line - of - sight  in the limit of a perfectly face - on system , which has no measurable rotation , the velocity dispersion of the stellar component is a more useful quantity .",
    "thus , we have two methods of estimating the dynamical mass of a galaxy that are affected by different systematics and limitations .",
    "can we combine them in order to obtain a quantity that is , _ on average _ , more tightly correlated with the baryonic mass ?",
    "an interesting quantity in this context is the @xmath91  parameter ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : @xmath92 this expression has been used in several studies , with different meanings for the dispersion component .",
    "@xcite studied the tf relation for an emission line - selected sample of 544 galaxies at @xmath93 , and demonstrated that a remarkably tighter relation is obtained when the @xmath91  parameter is adopted instead of the rotational velocity from the optical rotation curve . in their case , @xmath5 is the dispersion of the gas ( but this may be contaminated by velocity gradients , see their section 4.2 ) .",
    "interestingly , their sample includes early to late spirals , irregular galaxies and merging systems , and their @xmath91-stellar mass relation for the lowest redshift bin is in very good agreement with the fj relation of @xcite in terms of slope and zero point .",
    "more relevant for our work , @xcite used the @xmath91  parameter ( which they refer to as internal velocity , @xmath6 ) with @xmath5 measuring the stellar velocity dispersion of spheroidal galaxies .",
    "they showed that all classes of galaxies lie on a two - dimensional surface , which is expressed as a linear combination of the logarithms of the effective radius @xmath73 , the internal velocity squared , the surface brightness within @xmath73 , and the mass - to - light ratio within @xmath73 .",
    "their sample is a heterogeneous collection of 1925 spheroids and disk galaxies from existing data sets , which span the full range of galaxy types and luminosities .",
    "however , although they define @xmath94 , they use _ either _ the circular velocity @xmath95 for disk galaxies or the stellar velocity dispersion @xmath5 for spheroids , but never add the two contributions .    another interesting analysis was carried out by @xcite , who studied the evolution of the stellar mass tf relation in a simulation of a disk merger .",
    "they argue that , since early - type galaxies are generally assumed to form through mergers of late - type systems , the scaling relations of early types should descend from those of late - type galaxies .",
    "thus , they simulate the evolution of a galaxy merger , mimic observations of emission lines , and study how the kinematics of the system changes with time .",
    "the progenitors are two identical sbc galaxies lying on the stellar mass tf relation , which merge and form a rotating elliptical galaxy .",
    "intriguingly , they show that , while rotation is converted into stellar dispersion , the @xmath91  parameter is approximately conserved  suggesting that @xmath91  might be really tracing the mass distribution .",
    "the above studies motivated us to look at the relation between baryonic mass and @xmath91  parameter for the galaxies in our sample , with an important caveat .",
    "the @xmath91  parameter defined by equation  [ eq_s05 ] has a physical meaning only if rotation and dispersion are associated to the _ same _ system .",
    "for instance , for a rotating isothermal sphere the dynamical support is provided by both ordered and thermal motions , and the above combination is a direct result of the virial theorem . for our galaxies , @xmath7  measures",
    "the rotational velocity of the gas , and @xmath5 is the velocity dispersion of the stars in the bulge , thus combining the two _ has no physical motivation_. however , we are not trying to partition the dynamical support of a galaxy between its bulge and disk components  as we already pointed out , @xmath7  should account for the full dynamical support , regardless of the presence of a bulge .",
    "we wish instead to establish if we can average two measures of the potential well of a galaxy , which are based on different tracers , in order to obtain a quantity that , empirically , better correlates with the baryonic mass .",
    "after all , we expect the hi  width to be a more reliable measurement for inclined disk galaxies , and @xmath5 to be better for elliptical or face - on , disk galaxies .",
    "thus , the combination of the two might work better _ on average_.    the correlation between baryonic mass and @xmath91  parameter is plotted in figure  [ s05 ] for the full sample ( a ) , for the galaxies with inclinations larger than 40  ( b ) , and for the tf and fj subsets ( c , d ) defined in   [ s_btf ] and   [ s_bfj ] .",
    "the @xmath91  relation for the full sample has a scatter of 0.094 dex , very close to that of the bfj relation for the full sample , but significantly larger than that of the generalized bfj plotted in figure  [ bfj_corr ] .",
    "the @xmath91  relation still suffers from the inclination problems that affect the btf , although to a lesser degree .",
    "the strongest outliers seen in figure  [ s05]a are removed by our 40  inclination cut ( b , c ) .",
    "notice that , when applied to disk - dominated galaxies with inclinations larger than 40 , the @xmath91  relation has a scatter of only 0.064 dex , i.e. , it is tighter than the btf shown in figure  [ btf]b ( which has a scatter of 0.076 dex )  this is in fact the tightest relation presented in this work ( for comparison , the generalized bfj relation restricted to the same sample has a scatter of 0.077 dex ) .",
    "conversely , restricting the sample to bulge - dominated galaxies does not decrease the scatter of the @xmath91  relation .",
    "there is still a small offset between galaxies with and without hi  detections .",
    "naturally , we do not have any information on the rotational velocity of the non - detections ( some of which are disks close to edge - on view )  thus , for a fraction of these , @xmath91  is certainly underestimated .",
    "overall , the baryonic @xmath91  relation is as good as our generalized bfj , but only for galaxies with inclinations larger than 40 .",
    "in this work we demonstrated that a simple correction applied to the stellar velocity dispersions removes the offset between disk - dominated galaxies and spheroids seen in the bfj relation , i.e. , to first order , it removes its dependence on the internal structure of the galaxy .",
    "we further investigate this by considering the size - velocity relation .",
    "the existence of such a correlation is well established for both disk galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ; ss11 and references therein ) and ellipticals or bulges of early - type spirals ( the @xmath4-@xmath5 relation , where @xmath4 is the diameter of the galaxy at a given surface brightness level ; e.g. , @xcite ) . here",

    "specifically , we wish to test how the correction to the stellar velocity dispersion introduced in   [ s_mbfj ] affects the size - velocity relation .",
    "the sizes of disk galaxies are commonly estimated from exponential scale lengths , @xmath96",
    ". however , disk scale lengths are not only problematic to measure ( e.g.  @xcite ; ss11 ) , but are also not meaningful for elliptical galaxies . @xcite and ss11 advocate the use of isophotal radii instead of disk scale lengths , as they yield scaling relations with significantly lower scatter .",
    "isophotal radii are also used as size indicators for early - type galaxies in the @xmath4-@xmath5 relation .",
    "thus , we adopt @xmath17 , which is half the 25 mag arcsec@xmath18 isophote diameter @xmath19 measured by us on the sdss _ g_-band images , as a measure of size for all the galaxies in our sample . for comparison , @xmath17 varies between 2 and 7 @xmath96 , where @xmath96  is the sdss exponential scale length in _ r_-band , for the disk - dominated galaxies in our sample .    the relation between size and rotational velocity ( rv )",
    "is shown in figure  [ vsize]a for all the galaxies with hi  detections .",
    "for this and the other relations presented in this section we performed bisector linear regressions instead of inverse fits , because it is less clear that the scatter is mostly confined to one variable .",
    "the scatter of @xmath17 about the best fit is computed as before , i.e. , by applying tukey s bi - weight , and is noted in the bottom right corner of the plot ( in dex of kpc ) . as in figures",

    "some of the main outliers of this relation are also outliers for the btf , but there is not a 1-to-1 correspondence .",
    "for instance , the very hi - rich spiral gass 35981 ( marked as a blue star ) is an outlier on this plot , but not on the btf , whereas the gas - rich elliptical gass 3505 ( red star ) is an outlier for both relations .",
    "the rv relation is significantly weaker and more scattered than the btf , as known from other studies that use disk scale lengths as size indicators ( e.g. , @xcite report a pearson correlation coefficient of @xmath98 and a scatter of 0.33 in log @xmath99 ) .",
    "however , as mentioned above , ss11 obtain a very tight correlation using isophotal radii instead of disk scale lengths ( @xmath100 and a scatter of 0.11 in log r ; in the notation adopted by these authors , the scatter of courteau s relation becomes 0.165 dex ) . when restricted to the tf subset ( fig .",
    "[ vsize]b ) , the scatter of our relation ( 0.15 dex ) is intermediate between those of @xcite and ss11 samples . although we use a similar size indicator as ss11 , their sample includes only late - type spirals , thus the larger scatter of our relation is most likely due to the broader morphological mix of the galaxies in our data set . as for the btf and bfj relations , we plot the residuals of the rv relation as a function of several quantities in figure  [ vsize_res ] ( left panels ) .",

    "yet , the same result was obtained by @xcite for a sample of s0 galaxies with inclinations @xmath035@xmath7160 , which are also , overall , rotation - dominated : the central stellar velocity dispersion is a better predictor of _",

    "we discuss here in more detail the 12 galaxies with hi  rotational velocities smaller than their stellar velocity dispersions , which are outliers of both btf and @xmath7  versus @xmath5 relations .",
    "these objects are indicated by red symbols in figures  [ btf ] and [ vsigma ] . while the high @xmath63  outliers are all galaxies with small inclinations , for which the rotational velocities are likely to be overestimated , the low @xmath63  outliers are potentially more interesting . as mentioned in ",
    "[ s_btf ] , @xcite identifies a population of galaxies with unusually small @xmath63  ratios , which are outliers in his tf relation , and argues that these systems must have experienced gas accretion .",
    "figure  [ vsigma_hi ] shows sdss images and hi - line profiles for 9 outliers detected by gass ( the other galaxies were either observed by alfalfa or included in the s05 archive ) .",
    "two of these galaxies , gass 30175 and 31156 , are outliers because their sdss inclinations are incorrect .",
    "they both have strong bars which dominate the sdss fits , thus overestimating the inclination ( 54  and 61  for gass 30175 and 31156 ; we measured 37  and 27  respectively ) .",
    "the same is true for gass 24236 ( agc 220363 , detected by alfalfa and not shown here ) , a nearly face - on barred galaxy with sdss inclination of 46  ( we measured 17 ) . of the remaining outliers ,",

    "its ( uncorrected ) velocity width measured from the co(1 - 0 ) spectrum is 137 @xmath104 km  s@xmath13 , which is exactly the same as the ( uncorrected ) hi  width . since the co(1 - 0 ) emission typically originates from the central regions of a galaxy , perhaps the fact that co and hi  widths are identical means that the hi  gas in this galaxy is not extended enough to sample the flat part of the rotation curve",
    "this is not particularly unusual , as there are other examples of early - type spirals with truncated hi  disks ( e.g.  ngc 3623 , where the hi  emission does not extend beyond the stellar disk ; @xcite ) or unexpectedly narrow hi  profiles ( e.g.  ngc 5854 ; @xcite ) .",
    "overall , even acknowledging that some of these profiles are not very high signal - to - noise detections , it is striking that most are asymmetric , suggesting disturbances in the distribution and/or kinematics of the hi  gas .",
