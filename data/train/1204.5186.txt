    "the particle identity of dark matter ( dm ) is one of the most important questions in particle physics , both from a theoretical as well as an experimental point of view .",
    "since none of the particles in the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics can make up the dm , the problem points to new physics beyond the sm .",
    "the most popular class of dm candidates is weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) , which are particles that have weak interactions and masses in the gev to tev range .",
    "one of the possibilities for new physics beyond the sm is provided by models with extra spatial dimensions . in particular , in models with universal extra dimensions ( ued )  @xcite , the conservation of kaluza ",
    "klein ( kk ) parity ensures the stability of the lightest kk particle ( lkp ) , which may be a viable wimp dm candidate @xcite . in the five - dimensional ued model ,",
    "the internal space has to be compactified on the orbifold @xmath0 in order to give chiral fermions at the level of the zero modes and to avoid the existence of massless fifth components of the gauge fields . at the excited kk levels , each fermion field @xmath1 in the sm",
    "is replaced by two dirac fermions , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , having the quantum numbers of the corresponding left- and right - handed sm fermions , respectively .",
    "in addition , each of the kk excitations of the electroweak gauge bosons obtains a mass by eating a scalar that is a combination of the excitations of the sm higgs field and the fifth components of the gauge bosons . in the limit of a large compactification scale @xmath4 in comparison to the higgs vacuum expectation value ,",
    "these goldstone bosons are mainly composed of the fifth components of gauge bosons , and hence , the kk excitations of the charged component @xmath5 and of the pseudo - scalar @xmath6 are physical particles",
    ".    the mass spectrum in the ued model , and thus the identity of the lkp , is affected by boundary localized terms ( blts ) in the lagrangian , which are not determined by the model itself . in minimal ued ( mued ) models",

    ", the particle masses and interactions generally change . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was shown , using a restricted set of blts , that the first - level @xmath9 boson , @xmath10 , or the first - level neutral higgs boson , @xmath11 , could be the lkp in such models .",

    "@xcite and the gamma ray spectrum from @xmath10 annihilations in refs .",
    "@xcite . in general ,",
    "the detection of @xmath10 dm is more challenging than for the @xmath8 , due to a larger preferred mass and a different distribution of annihilation channels .",

    "the rest of the letter is organized as follows : in sec .",

    "[ sec : conc ] , we summarize our results and state our conclusions .",
    "the standard calculation of the relic abundance of a thermally produced wimp is reviewed , for example , in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the case that the mass splitting between the lkp and some of the other first - level kk modes is small , the effects of coannihilations are important @xcite . taking these effects into account , the abundance is given by @xmath13 where @xmath14 , @xmath15 is the mass of the dm particle , @xmath16 is the freeze - out temperature , @xmath17 is the planck scale , and @xmath18 is the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom at freeze - out .",
    "the quantities @xmath19 and @xmath20 are given by @xmath21 here , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are defined by the expansion @xmath24 of the effective cross section , @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the coannihilation cross section between the states @xmath27 and @xmath28 , @xmath29 is the number of degrees of freedom for the state @xmath27 , and @xmath30 , with @xmath31 denoting the mass of the lkp .",

    "in addition , we have checked the results analytically , using eqs .",
    " , and found agreement between the two methods .    in the non - minimal ued model that we are studying",
    ", the mass spectrum has to be modified relative to the mued model , so that @xmath11 is the lkp .",
    "therefore , the rest of the first - level mass spectrum has to be fixed in some way in order to assess the effects of coannihilations , which depend strongly on the particle masses . rather than considering the detailed effects of the blts",
    ", we take a more phenomenological approach by making an ansatz for the mass spectrum .",
    "also , we do not consider modifications of the coupling constants due to the blts .",
    "the simplest ansatz for the mass spectrum is a universal mass splitting between the lkp and all the other first - level kk particles , parametrized by the relative mass splitting @xmath36 .",

    "since the amplitude for the contribution from the quark flavor @xmath50 is proportional to the square of the yukawa coupling , @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the vacuum expectation value of the higgs field , the scattering is suppressed for all flavors except for the top quark .",
    "the heavy quarks @xmath74 contribute to the scattering only through loop - level couplings to gluons .",
    "the effective couplings for these quarks , given in eq .  , were first derived in ref .",
    "@xcite for neutralino - nucleon scattering , and they do not hold in general .",
    "nevertheless , we use these expressions to estimate the contributions from the top quark , as the contributions from the light quarks are completely negligible for the @xmath11 .",

    "the direct @xmath125 channel is suppressed by the small yukawa coupling constants for light fermions .",

    "the gravitational capture of wimps in the sun could lead to a significantly enhanced density , giving neutrino signals from pair annihilations .",
    "however , the capture rate of wimps in the sun is proportional to the wimp - proton cross section , which is the same quantity that is constrained by direct detection experiments .",
    "this means that the expected results in neutrino telescopes are correlated with the limits from direct detection experiments .",
    "an important consequence is that for dm candidates that interact only spin - independently with nuclei , the constraints from direct detection experiments are already strong enough to rule out an observation of neutrinos from dm annihilations in the sun @xcite .",
    "this is the case for scalar dm candidates , such as the @xmath11 , and hence , neutrinos from the sun are not a promising detection channel for this dm candidate .",

    "although the @xmath11 is a typical wimp dm candidate , we find that detecting it would be very challenging in direct as well as indirect detection experiments .",
    "the main reasons for the suppressed rates are the facts that the yukawa couplings are small for all fermions except for the top quark and that annihilation into any fermion - antifermion pair is helicity suppressed .",
    "this means that the @xmath11-quark coupling relevant for direct detection is small , that the continuum gamma ray spectrum does not display a sharp cutoff , and that the positron spectrum is soft , consisting mainly of secondary positrons .",
    "in addition , being a scalar , the @xmath11 interacts only spin - independently with nuclei , and is not expected to give observable signatures in neutrinos from the sun .    to conclude , the dm phenomenology of the @xmath11 is very different from that of the standard kkdm candidate , the @xmath8 .",
    "the @xmath8 has relatively good detection prospects , especially in indirect detection experiments .",
    "the photon and positron channels both feature hard spectra with sharp cutoffs at @xmath139 , and also , the mainly spin - dependent @xmath8-nucleon interactions give rise to potentially strong signatures in neutrinos from the sun .",
    "the @xmath11 phenomenology is actually more similar to that of the @xmath10 , which has a similar preferred mass range for the relic abundance , and also features large branching ratios into bosons , rather than fermions .",
    "the main exception is the gamma ray line signal , which is expected to be strong for the @xmath10 , due to large contributions from the non - abelian gauge boson self - interactions , but not for the @xmath11 .",
    "it is apparently extremely hard to positively identify the @xmath11 as a dm particle .",
    "however , it would in principle be possible to produce it at a collider like the lhc .",
    "if collider experiments revealed part of the kk spectrum , with an @xmath11-like particle as the lkp , while direct and indirect dm detection experiments only kept setting limits , then one would be very tempted to declare the @xmath11 as the dm particle . a more detailed experimental investigation of its properties",
    "could then be used to probe the agreement of abundance calculations with the observed value . in short , although the experimental situation is very challenging , there is still hope to be able to establish the @xmath11 as dm in the future .    throughout the letter , we have assumed that the coupling constants are not affected by the blts . in general",
    ", this might not be the case , and the results could be changed by such effects .",
    "an investigation of this issue is beyond the scope of this work .",
