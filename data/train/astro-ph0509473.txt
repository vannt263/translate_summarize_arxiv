    "the shape of the galaxy luminosity function ( lf ) bears the imprint of galaxy formation and evolutionary processes . in particular",
    ", the presence of a break at the characteristic schechter luminosity @xmath5 , suggests that galaxies below @xmath5 differ substantially from those above it . because of this",
    ", our understanding of how galaxies form and evolve may profit from studying the evolution of not just the bright but also the faint members of the galaxy population at high redshift . to date , the faint end of the luminosity function at high redshift has only been studied using single deep but small fields that do not provide sufficient galaxy numbers or insurance against cosmic variance to give trustworthy lf measurements . and",
    "yet , for any reasonable faint - end slope of the lf , it is exactly these poorly - studied faint galaxies that not only dominate the number counts , but also contribute most of the cosmic luminosity density . with these facts in mind",
    ", we have set out to study the statistics of faint , sub-@xmath5 galaxies at high redshift .",
    "we study the global statistics of sub-@xmath5 galaxies at high redshift using a very deep imaging survey that utilizes the very same @xmath2 filter set and color - color selection techniques as are used for brighter galaxies in the work of steidel et al .",
    "( 1999 , 2003 , 2004 ) .",
    "in contrast to the steidel et al .",
    "work , our survey reaches @xmath0=27 ; this is 1.5 magnitudes deeper than steidel et al .  and significantly below @xmath5 at @xmath3=24 ( sawicki & thompson , 2005 ) . these keck deep fields ( kdf )",
    "were obtained with the lris imaging spectrograph on keck i and represent a total of 71 hours of integration .",
    "the kdf have an area of 169 arcmin@xmath7 divided into 3 spatially - independent patches .",
    "this arrangement allows us to monitor the effects of cosmic variance on our results .",
    "our use of the @xmath2 filter set lets us select high-@xmath3 galaxies using the color - color selection criteria defined and spectroscopically tested by steidel et al .",
    "( 1999 , 2003 , 2004 ) .",
    "we can thus confidently select sub-@xmath5 star - forming galaxies at high redshift without the need for spectroscopic characterization of the sample  characterization that would be extremely expensive at the faint magnitudes that interest us .",
    "moreover , this commonality with the steidel et al .",
    "surveys permits us to robustly combine our data with their , thereby for the first time consistently spanning a large range in galaxy luminosity at high redshift .    to @xmath8=27 ,",
    "the kdf contains 427 , 1481 , 2417 , and 2043 , @xmath2-selected star - forming galaxies at @xmath3@xmath44 , @xmath3@xmath43 , @xmath3@xmath42.2 , and @xmath3@xmath41.7 , respectively , selected using the steidel et al .",
    "( 1999 , 2003 , 2004 ) color - color selection criteria ( fig .  1 ) . a detailed description of the keck deep field observations , data reductions , and high-@xmath3 galaxy selection can be found in sawicki & thompson ( 2005a ) .",
    "figure  2(a ) shows the luminosity function of uv - selected star - forming galaxies at @xmath3@xmath44 , 3 , and 2.2 . at @xmath3@xmath44 and 3",
    ", we augment our kdf data with the identically - selected steidel et al .",
    "( 1999 ) galaxy count measurements at bright magnitudes , @xmath8@xmath925.5 .",
    "following steidel et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , our lf calculation uses the effective volume technique , computing @xmath10 through recovery tests of artificial high-@xmath3 galaxies implanted into the imaging data .",
    "our analysis includes a comprehensive study of a variety of potential systematic effects ( see sawicki & thompson 2005b for details ) and consequently we can be confident about the robustness of our lfs . when such robustness is lacking  as it is at @xmath3@xmath42  we know not to overinterpret our results .    as fig .",
    "2(a ) shows , our data reach very faint luminosities which correspond to star formation rates of only 12  @xmath11/yr ( not corrected for dust ) . until now , lf measurements at these depths",
    "have only been carried out in small , single deep fields ( such as the hdfs ) and so are subject to small number statistics and/or vagaries of large scale structure ( e.g. , sawicki , lin , & yee 1997 ; gabasch et al.2004 ) . moreover , until now it was necessary to combine these faint - end data with bright - end results that had been selected using different selection criteria  an approach fraught with potential biases . and finally , hitherto little attention has been paid to potential systematic effects in high - z lf measurements .",
    "in contrast , our kdf results are the deepest and most robust lf measurements at these redshifts and , very importantly , can readily and straightforwardly be combined with the steidel et al .",
    "( 1999 ) results at the bright end .",
    "our @xmath3@xmath44 and @xmath3@xmath43 lfs are very insensitive to a large range of systematics , although the @xmath3@xmath42.2 and @xmath3@xmath41.7 lfs are more uncertain .",
    "specifically , the @xmath3@xmath41.7 lf is likely quite strongly affected by systematics ( see sawicki & thompson 2005b for details ) and so we do not discuss it here .",
    "our @xmath3@xmath42.2 lf measurement is probably also affected by systematics but to a smaller degree than the @xmath3@xmath41.7 lf : we can confidently state that the number density of @xmath3@xmath42.2 galaxies is _ not lower _ than shown in fig .",
    "2(b ) , and that if it is higher than the lf shown , it is so by no more than a factor of @xmath42 .",
    "the @xmath3@xmath43 and @xmath3@xmath44 lfs _ are _ very robust against systematics as verified by a range of tests ( sawicki & thompson 2005b ) .",
    "the values of schechter function parameters are given in sawicki & thompson ( 2005b ) and here we only note that our @xmath12@xmath4@xmath1321 at @xmath3@xmath44 and @xmath3@xmath43 and also that we find shallower faint - end slopes than found by steidel et al .",
    "( 1999 ) using hdf - n data .",
    "specifically , steidel et al .  ( 1999 ) found @xmath14=@xmath131.6 at @xmath3@xmath43 in the hdf - n ( and in the absence of good statistics , had to _ assume _ the same @xmath14=@xmath131.6 value for @xmath3@xmath44 ) .",
    "our kdf analysis , which uses much larger datasets that span several spatially independent fields , finds @xmath14=@xmath131.43 at @xmath3@xmath43 and @xmath14=@xmath131.26 at @xmath3@xmath44 .",
    "workers who still use the steidel et al .",
    "( 1999 ) hdf - n value to extrapolate the contributions of sub-@xmath5 galaxies from bright galaxy counts at higher redshifts should take note of these more accurate , shallower faint - end slopes",
    ". the new , shallower faint - end slopes we find have a significant effect on estimates of the luminosity density of the universe ( see   5 ) .",
    "the luminosity function of high-@xmath3 galaxies undergoes evolution that is differential with luminosity . as fig .  2 shows",
    ", we find a factor of @xmath42.5 evolution in the number density ( or , alternatively , 2 mag in luminosity ) of _ faint _ , sub-@xmath5 lyman break galaxies between @xmath3@xmath44 to @xmath3@xmath43 . at the same time",
    ", there is no evidence for evolution of the bright end of the lf .",
    "our tests show that it is highly unlikely that the observed differential evolution is due to some systematic effect such as selection bias , our modeling of the survey volume , etc .",
    "( see sawicki & thompson 2005b for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "the effect is also statistically quite significant  the probability that the evolution is not differential with luminosity is only 1.5% ( see fig .",
    "we therefore conclude that the differential , luminosity - dependent evolution is very likely real .",
    "if so , it must reflect some real intrinsic evolutionary differences between faint and luminous lbgs .",
    "understanding what these differences are will give us insights into what drives galaxy evolution at high redshift .",
    "the importance of the faint end of the luminosity function extends into measurements of the cosmic luminosity density and its derivative , the cosmic star formation rate . as is illustrated in fig .",
    "3(a ) , for observed values of the faint - end slope @xmath14 the bulk of the luminosity density resides in galaxies that are fainter than @xmath5 .",
    "attempts to measure the contribution of the low - luminosity galaxies have been made previously using single small fields ( e.g. , madau et al .",
    "1996 ; sawicki , lin , & yee , 1997 ; steidel et al .  1999 ; gabash et al 2004 ) .",
    "but it is only with a deep , mutli - field and large - area survey such as the kdf that we can robustly measure the contribution of these dominant galaxies to the total luminosity density .",
    "figure 3(b ) shows a compilation of uv luminosity density values that trace the evolution of the luminosity density from @xmath3@xmath45 to the present .",
    "the black symbols show the total luminosity density , obtained by integrating the luminosity - weighted luminosity function over _ all _ luminosities .",
    "the total luminosity density exhibits a strong increase from @xmath3@xmath45 to @xmath3@xmath43 followed by the well - known strong decline below @xmath3@xmath41 . at present , it is not yet clear if there is a plateau at @xmath3@xmath432 since , as mentioned in   3 , our @xmath3@xmath42 points are strictly speaking lower limits .    it is interesting to ask which galaxies contain the bulk of the uv light and  presumably  star formation at each redshift .",
    "the colored points in fig .",
    "3(b ) show the contributions to the the total luminosity density that are made by galaxies in three luminosity ranges ( split at @xmath15=@xmath1321 and @xmath15=@xmath1318 ) .",
    "as the red diamonds show , the _ bulk _ of the luminosity density at high redshift comes from intermediate - luminosity galaxies between @xmath16 and @xmath16@xmath173 .",
    "galaxies that are brighter than @xmath15=@xmath1321 ( @xmath18@xmath12 ) as well as those fainter than @xmath15=@xmath1318 ( @xmath18@xmath12@xmath173 ) contribute little to the total luminosity density at high redshift .",
    "the galaxies that do dominate the luminosity density come from just a small range of luminosity just below @xmath5 and are exactly the galaxies probed by the kdf .",
    "the steep increase in the luminosity density at high redshift is due to the increase in the number density of sub-@xmath5 galaxies and the resulting steepening of the lf s faint - end slope @xmath14 .",
    "however , as fig .",
    "2 illustrates , while the number density of sub-@xmath5 galaxies increases with time , the number of luminous ones remains constant .",
    "this differential evolution must reflect important evolutionary differences between luminous and faint galaxies at these redshifts .",
    "understanding the mechanism that underlies this differential , luminosity - dependent evolution will teach us important lessons about how galaxies form and evolve .    at present , it is not clear what is responsible for the observed differential evolution of the lf .",
    "one straightforward possibility is that the number of faint ( but not bright ) lbgs simply increases over the 600  myr from @xmath3@xmath44 to @xmath3@xmath43 .",
    "if uv luminosity reflects underlying mass , such an increase could be a reflection of an evolutionary trend that favors star formation in progressively lower - mass systems as the universe ages ( see , e.g. , iwata et al.2005 ) .",
    "another possibility is that dust properties  its amount or covering fraction  may be decreasing in faint lbgs with time .",
    "such a change would make individual faint galaxies brigher and thus would steepen the faint end of the lf .",
    "yet another possibility is that if star formation in individual faint lbgs is episodic ( e.g. , sawicki & yee 1998 ) , then they may brighten and fade ( and thus move in and out of a given magnitude bin in the lf ) with duty cycle properties that change with redshift . longer or more frequent star - forming episodes would then result in a steeper luminosity function .",
    "whatever the mechanism , the fact that the lf evolution is differential suggests that different evolutionary mechanisms are at play as a function of uv luminosity .",
    "studies that _ differentially _ compare key galaxy properties as a function of luminosity and redshift should help us isolate the mechanisms that are responsible for this evolution .",
    "such studies , including comparisons between spectral energy distributions or clustering properties of galaxies as a function of luminosity are already underway .",
    "a key point here is that we have identified luminosity and redshift as important variables in galaxy evolution at high @xmath3 . while lbg follow - up studies to date have primarily focused on luminous galaxies , extending such studies to cover a range of luminosity that spans the break `` knee '' of the luminosity function will yield valuable insights into how galaxies form and evolve .",
