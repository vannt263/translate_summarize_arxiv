    "however , the existence of efficient acceleration of relativistic particles by pre - main sequence flares is observationally established by their radio gyrosynchrotron emission (  [ protons ] ) .    the enhancement in proton fluences of @xmath45 my onc solar analogs is thus inferred to be about @xmath13 above that produced by the most powerful flares from the sun today : @xmath11 from the increased x - ray luminosity , @xmath12 from the increased occurrence frequency , and @xmath120 from the increased proton flux compared to x - ray flux . as the contemporary proton fluence at 1 a.u . from the flare site averaged over a solar cycle",

    "note that , as the duration of a single powerful solar proton event is typically several hours and flares with @xmath124 erg s@xmath5 ( below our detection limit ) probably occurred several times a day , it is likely that the pre - main sequence sun was producing high fluences of relativistic protons nearly continuously from overlapping magnetic flare events .",

    "while the x - ray luminosities of young stars have dependencies on mass and age which we have accounted for , there is no known dependence on their star forming environments .",

    "this is commonly seen in powerful solar long duration flares as different portions of a complex active region release magnetic energy .",
    "second , some of the acis spectra show emission lines indicative of elemental abundance anomalies seen in stars whose emission processes are definitely unrelated to circumstellar disks . a considerable number of onc acis sources , including some solar analogs , show spectra suggesting overabundance of neon and underabundance of iron .",

    "this is the geometry assumed in the meteoritic spallation calculations of @xcite and @xcite and in the chondrule melting model of @xcite .",
    "it is likely protostellar disks amplify embedded magnetic fields through turbulence and dynamo processes , and it is possible that violent reconnection occurs when these fields emerge at the disk surfaces .",

    "the equivalent width of the two iron lines were comparable , indicating that the disk subtends a large solid angle when viewed by the x - ray emitting magnetic structure .",
    "this is evidence against reconnection of magnetic fields very close to the stellar surface (  [ surface_subsec ] ) , and favors a geometry where the reconnection occurs above the disk in a ` lamppost ' configuration (  [ stardisk_subsec]-[disk_subsec ] ) .",
    "fluorescent iron line emission under a variety of geometries has been investigated in the context of seyfert galaxies and x - ray binary systems ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , although similar study has not yet been conducted specifically for protostellar systems . as in seyferts , the high amplitude variability of the flare emission",
    "should be reproduced in the fluorescent line with time delays associated with the relative geometry of the emitting and reflecting components and the line - of - sight .",

    "we find that both of these calculations of a solar nebula origin of meteoritic short - lived nuclei are fully consistent with the flare proton levels we infer are present during the first million years of the solar system . the x - ray and proton luminosities assumed by @xcite to explain the observed abundances of several nuclides are nearly identical to the values we find from onc solar analogs (  [ inferred_sec ] ) .",

    "we infer that the proton fluence in the early sun is about @xmath13 times the time - averaged levels produced by the contemporary sun .",
    "the line of reasoning linking the onc x - ray measurements to solar nebular isotopic anomalies has several steps .",
    "the completeness of our sample and ubiquity of strong x - ray flaring during the first my ( though a decline in activity appears in some stars during the @xmath162 my period ,  [ evol_subsec ] ) argues strongly that the early sun produced such flares (  [ ori_sun_sec ] ) .",
    "there are also strong reasons , based on yso radio gyrosynchrotron measurements and analogy with solar flare physics , to believe that the onc x - ray flares are accompanied by high proton fluences (  [ protons ] ) .",
    "the geometry of the reconnecting magnetic fields and consequence fraction of flare protons that impact the disk is uncertain , particularly at distant locations in the asteroid belt where meteorites parent bodies are now found (  [ disk_sec ] ) .",
    "however , the report of the 6.4 kev iron fluorescent line in protostellar spectra strongly suggests that the x - rays , and by reasonable inference the protons , efficiently impact the disk . unless the flare geometries are unfavorable , we find the inferred proton flux on the disk is sufficient to produce the observed cai abundances of several important short - lived radioactive isotopes (  [ anom_subsec ] ) .",
    "our study thus strengthens the astronomical foundation for local proton spallation models of meteoritic isotopic anomalies .",
    "however , it can not not establish the entire theory .",
    "for example , it is not clear that a local spallation model can account for meteoritic @xmath155fe @xcite or for the evidence that the abundance of @xmath19mn was greater in the outer solar nebula than the inner nebula @xcite .",
    "it seems plausible that _ both _ external seeding and internal spallation may have been sources of short - lived nuclides in the solar nebula .",

    "<S> to address the role of energetic processes in the solar nebula , we provide a detailed characterization of magnetic flaring in stellar analogs of the pre - main sequence sun based on two 0.5-day observations of analogs of the young sun in the orion nebula cluster obtained with the _ chandra x - ray observatory_. the sample consists of 43 stars with masses 0.7 - 1.4 m@xmath0 and ages @xmath1 to @xmath2 my . </S>",
    "<S> we find the x - ray luminosities measured in the @xmath3 kev band are strongly elevated over main sequence levels with average @xmath4 erg s@xmath5 and @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the x - ray emission is strongly variable within our exposures in nearly all solar analogs ; about 30 flares with @xmath7 erg s@xmath5 on timescales from @xmath8 to @xmath9 hours are seen during the chandra observations . </S>",
    "<S> analogs of the @xmath10 my old pre - main sequence sun exhibited x - ray flares that are @xmath11 times more powerful and @xmath12 times more frequent than the most powerful flares seen on the contemporary sun .    </S>",
    "<S> radio observations indicate that acceleration of particles to relativistic energies is efficient in young stellar flares . extrapolating the solar relationship between x - ray luminosity and proton fluence </S>",
    "<S> , we infer that the young sun exhibited a @xmath13-fold enhancement in energetic protons compared to contemporary levels . unless the flare geometries are unfavorable , this inferred proton flux on the disk is sufficient to produce the observed meteoritic abundances of several important short - lived radioactive isotopes . </S>",
    "<S> our study thus strengthens the astronomical foundation for local proton spallation models of isotopic anomalies in carbonaceous chondritic meteorites . </S>",
    "<S> the radiation , particles and shocks produced by the magnetic reconnection flares seen with @xmath14 may also have flash melted meteoritic chondrules and produced excess @xmath15ne seen in meteoritic grains . </S>"
