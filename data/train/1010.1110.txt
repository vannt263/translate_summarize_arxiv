    "<S> we describe a magnetic shape memory alloy in which nanostructure confinement strain influences the crystallographic phase and the electronic and magnetic properties of the resulting nanowires . </S>",
    "<S> we use first - principles calculations on shape memory mnas nanostructures to study the influence of strain on crystal phases , which arises from surfaces . </S>",
    "<S> we show that mnas nanowires down to two nanometers can be stable in a new crystal phase different from bulk hexagonal and induced by one - dimensionality . </S>",
    "<S> the changes between structures through use of strain require the existence of twin domains . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis suggests that the strain - induced structural transition , demonstrated here in mnas compounds , could be extended to other ( magnetic ) shape memory nanowire systems for applications ranging from mechanical to magneto - electronic devices .    </S>",
    "<S> nanocrystalline structures such as quantum wires are attractive because of their peculiar properties arising from low dimensionality and quantum confinement which make them interesting for new nanodevice design @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> wires fully made of diluted magnetic semiconductor gaas : mn , typical spintronic material , have already been grown.@xcite when looking at epitaxial semiconductor - magnet interfaces , semiconductor wires have attached magnetic dots of shape memory alloy mnas @xcite or are fully covered with mnas wires around cores of iii - v semiconductor gaas.@xcite ferromagnetic nanowires made of mnas are also fabricated on gaas surfaces using lithographic@xcite and epitaxial@xcite techniques . in all cases , the resulting mnas / gaas heterojunctions are clean , atomically sharp , and thermodynamically stable . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite in these hybrid systems , the magnetic shape memory alloys such as mnas are easily grown on semiconductor surfaces due to commensurability at the interface . </S>",
    "<S> the shape memory nanostructures made of mnas can be highly strained because of nanostructure confinement , so strains will induce changes in other properties as it has already been found for semiconductor nanocrystals.@xcite thus , the theoretical study of nanowires made of magnetic shape memory alloys is necessary to understand such low - dimensional quantum structures .    </S>",
    "<S> magnetic shape memory alloys grow easily commensurate on semiconductor surfaces due to the softness of their phase transitions , which involve several crystal structures . </S>",
    "<S> this softness comes from the reversible transformation between a high - temperature phase called austenite and a low - temperature phase called martensite.@xcite recent experimental work has shown that the two phases involved in the non - magnetic shape memory ternary alloy cualni are more stable in nanoscale pillars than in the bulk.@xcite if we focus on the magnetic shape memory alloy mnas , the high - temperature and less - ordered orthorhombic phase changes at low temperatures to an hexagonal nias - type ferromagnetic phase.@xcite both structures are related by a shear of the atomic lattice together with relaxation of the unit cell atoms . above </S>",

    "<S> in this work we investigate polymorphic shape memory nanowires made of mnas within density functional theory . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we study the geometrical stability of hexagonal nias - type and zinc - blende crystal structures . </S>",
    "<S> unexpectedly , the most stable phase is neither the hexagonal nor the zinc blende , but a different structure induced by the low dimensionality of mnas nanowires . </S>",
    "<S> this ground - state structure is characterized by 8 nearest neighbors around central mn atoms and it is call hereafter `` 8 index '' . the fact that the crystal ground state is neither hexagonal nor zinc blende is surprising , and shows how strain plays an important role in stabilizing 1d crystal structures . to understand this confinement - induced behavior </S>",
    "<S> , we analyze the strain of ferromagnetic mnas nanowires through their associated winding numbers.@xcite for instance , we show that mnas nanowires can not be _ continuously _ deformed from the 8-index phase into zinc blende due to different winding numbers . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the formation of either dislocations or twins in the zinc - blende phase under strain justifies the different energetic order . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , we show that ferromagnetic mnas nanowires are metallic in the 8-index phase with large carriers velocities at the fermi energy , while hexagonal and cubic phases are half metallic .    </S>",
    "<S> [ tc ] we investigate the threefold polymorphism of ferromagnetic mnas nanowires by relaxing two bulk - like input geometries , hexagonal and zinc blende , as depicted in fig .  , where small pseudohydrogens@xcite are included in order to avoid surface effects and mimic the surrounding environment . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the wires are studied in the ferromagnetic configuration of mn spins since the antiferromagnetic ordering is less stable for the three shown crystal phases . </S>",

    "<S> the nanowires are at the same scale . </S>",
    "<S> for comparison , the stable crystal phases are depicted as in the bulk with empty spheres . </S>",
    "<S> the differences of cohesive energies per atom between wires and the 8-index found phase are given in mev below the plotted cubic and hexagonal geometries . </S>",
    "<S> the difference values show that although hexagonal wires are more stable than zinc - blende ones , these two phases are almost degenerate . ]    </S>",
    "<S> first we look at zinc blende nanowires when streching or compressing with different c / a ratios . </S>",
    "<S> our output zinc - blende nanowires are drawn in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> ( a ) . during relaxation , </S>",
    "<S> the mn - as bonds stretch from 2.46   to @xmath0   and the wire axis expands by 12% . </S>",
    "<S> the shape of the cross section changes from a circle to a rhombus . </S>",
    "<S> this output shape calls for a more detailed analysis of zinc - blende wires , as given later . </S>",
    "<S> the input and output hexagonal structures are plotted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) with the @xmath1 axis parallel to the wire axis ( @xmath2-plane orientation ) . </S>",
    "<S> we choose cross sections terminated with as edges since they are more stable than those with mn.@xcite during relaxation , the mn - as bonds lenghts increase from 2.57   to @xmath3   . </S>",
    "<S> this large strain ( 3@xmath48% ) compares to lattice mismatches measured at the mnas / gaas interface ( @xmath5@xcite ) . due to relaxation strain </S>",
    "<S> , the hexagonal wires expand along the axis by 15% . </S>",
    "<S> the 8-index phase is obtained by structural relaxation of a compressed zinc - blende wire along the axis with a small c / a ratio . </S>",
    "<S> this output geometry is drawn in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> ( c ) together with its bulk - like zinc - blende counterpart . in the relaxed wires , the mn - as bonds range from 2.68   to 3.13   in length . as compared with the bulk - like zinc - blende structure , </S>",
    "<S> the 8-index phase is contracted along the axis down to 0.53@xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> these relaxed wires are characterized by 8 nearest neighbors around the mn atoms in the axis . for the as and mn atoms off - center , </S>",
    "<S> the coordination index is either 5 or 6 depending on their positions .    </S>",
    "<S> the cohesive energy per atom in the unit cell is defined as @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the total energy and @xmath9 is the energy of the @xmath10-th free atom . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated values are 2.698 , 2.635 , and 2.629  ev for 8-index , hexagonal , and cubic phases , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the mnas nanowires are more stable with the new crystal geometry than with either the hexagonal or zinc - blende one , in the same order . the fact that a new phase different from bulk hexagonal is more stable shows the important role of strain induced by 1d nanostructures .    </S>",
    "<S> let us further investigate the nature of polymorphism in mnas nanowires by looking at their strain fields and associated winding numbers . </S>",
    "<S> the structural relaxation of the nanowires determine strain vectors that form strain fields in their cross sections . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on the 8-index and zinc - blende nanowires , as drawn in fig .  . </S>",
    "<S> the strain field corresponding to the ground state shows an homogeneous expansion that can be explained because of the compressed input geometry . </S>",
    "<S> however , the expansion for the zinc - blende phase is clearly inhomogeneous and it must be analyzed in more detail .    </S>",
    "<S> ( color online ) strain fields in the cross sections of ( a ) cubic and ( b ) 8-index nanowires . </S>",
    "<S> the strain vectors are multiplied by 2 for the sake of clarity . </S>",
    "<S> the numbers in the down right corners are the winding numbers around the nanowire surfaces . </S>",
    "<S> these numbers are the times that the strain vectors on the marked circumferences , when looking counterclockwise , rotate . counterclockwise ( clockwise ) rotations give positive ( negative ) winding numbers . </S>",
    "<S> different winding numbers suggest the presence of either dislocations of twins in the zinc - blende nanowires . ]    </S>",
    "<S> these strain fields are now studied within homotopy theory.@xcite this theory provides the formalism for the precise description of a large variety of ordered systems through a vectorial function . for strain fields , </S>",
    "<S> the values of this function are the strain vectors lying on circumferences centered in nanowire axis . </S>",
    "<S> the vectorial function is here not continuous but discretized at every atom . </S>",
    "<S> when looking counterclockwise at these strain vectors , the times that they turn around is known as the winding number of the strain field . </S>",
    "<S> this number is positive ( negative ) for counterclockwise ( clockwise ) rotations . for 8-index and cubic geometries , </S>",
    "<S> the winding numbers are 1 and -3 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> from homotopy theory we know that crystal structures with distinct winding numbers are not homotopic , that is , they can not be _ continuously _ deformed into one another . since 8-index and cubic structures </S>",
    "<S> are not homotopic , the phase transition between them suggests the formation of dislocations , such as twins , in the zinc - blende wires .    </S>",
    "<S> thus , with a larger number of dislocations , the energy of cubic structure being less stable than the 8-index one , we are lead to the idea of an additional dislocation energy in defective structures . this energy is related to the number of stacking faults in the nanowires . given these dislocations </S>",
    "<S> , we can return to the cohesive energy differences of ev per atom between 8-index and other geometries . </S>",
    "<S> we can qualitatively understand this as follows . assumed that the dislocation energy is @xmath11 ( @xmath12 20 mev about tenths of mev for pure metals@xcite ) and that the number of dislocations is , say , @xmath13 ( @xmath14 for zinc - blende wires ) , then the cohesive energy per atom is of the order of @xmath15  mev . </S>",
    "<S> this value is very close to our calculated cohesive differences , as shown in fig .  .    </S>",
    "<S> we now study the ferromagnetism of mnas nanowires in more detail . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated total magnetic moments per mn atom are 4.00@xmath16 , 4.38@xmath16 , and 4.59@xmath16 in the cubic , hexagonal , and 8-index nanowires . for comparison </S>",
    "<S> , we also calculate the total magnetic moments in the bulk , 4.00@xmath16 for zinc - blende mnas and </S>",
    "<S> @xmath173.89@xmath16 for hexagonal mnas . </S>",
    "<S> this latter value is close to the experimental one for the hexagonal phase , @xmath173.4@xmath16;@xcite we remember that bulk zinc - blende mnas is unstable . </S>",
    "<S> the previous magnetic moments 4.00@xmath16 and @xmath173.89@xmath16 show the same decreasing trend than 3.75@xmath16 and 3.09@xmath16 reported for bulk mnas with zinc - blende and hexagonal structures,@xcite respectively . in comparison with previous structural differences in magnetic moments , the position dependence is smaller , in the order of 0.1@xmath16 , and it can neglected .    </S>",
    "<S> the calculated total magnetic moment of 4.00@xmath16 per mn atom in the zinc - blende nanowires can be explained from ( i ) the large charge transfer of near three electrons from the mn cations to their neighbor as anions , and ( ii ) the strong @xmath18(as)@xmath19(mn ) hybridization.@xcite these two effects are in turn strongly dependent on the mn - as bond length which is @xmath172.55   in the zinc - blende phase , close to 2.46   in the bulk.@xcite looking at coordination numbers the total magnetic moment in the hexagonal phase should be smaller than that in the zinc - blende structure . however , the previous 4.38@xmath16 value for the hexagonal wires is larger than 4.00@xmath16 for the zinc - blende ones and also larger than @xmath20 in the bulk . </S>",
    "<S> both the charge transfer from mn atoms and the @xmath21 hybridization are reduced because of the longer mn - as bond length , @xmath172.70   . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , the 4.59@xmath16 total magnetic moment for the 8-index phase is related to the even longer mn - as bond distance , @xmath172.90   .    </S>",
    "<S> ( color online ) spin - polarized electronic bands calculated for ( a ) cubic , ( b ) hexagonal , and ( c ) 8-index mnas nanowires . </S>",
    "<S> the shadowed areas indicate the slopes for the 8-index bands crossing the fermi level . </S>",
    "<S> note that carriers velocities are thus larger for 8-index wires than for either hexagonal or cubic ones . ]    </S>",
    "<S> next we are interested in the electronic properties of mnas nanowires . </S>",
    "<S> the electronic bands along the wire direction are drawn in fig .   as a function of the electron wave vector between @xmath22 and x points . in the @xmath23 curves </S>",
    "<S> , we see that the hexagonal and zinc - blende nanowires behave as half - metals due to a gap in the spin - down channel , and that the 8-index ones behave as metals . </S>",
    "<S> we note that zinc - blende mnas is also half - metallic in thin films.@xcite from the slope of the dispersion curves we also estimate the velocities of the carriers close to the fermi energy . </S>",
    "<S> the largest slopes for both spin components correspond to the 8-index wires , as shadowed in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> ( c ) . </S>",
    "<S> the carriers velocities are thus larger for this new found structure than for the hexagonal and cubic ones . by tuning the crystal geometry with strain </S>",
    "<S> we can change the polytypism and twin planes inside nanowires . </S>",
    "<S> this level of control could lead to different transport properties and novel electronic behavior , recently found in semiconductor wires.@xcite    in summary , we have investigated the nature of polymorphism in ferromagnetic nanowires made of shape memory mnas within density functional theory . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental phases for bulk mnas and nanostructures are hexagonal nias type and zinc blende . </S>",
    "<S> however , the mnas nanowires are more stable in the so - called `` 8-index '' phase induced by strain in one dimension . </S>",
    "<S> the 8-index geometry has been further investigated by comparing its strain field with that of the zinc - blende wires . </S>",
    "<S> the strain fields are formed by the strain vectors arising from structural relaxation of the atomic positions . within homotopy theory,@xcite we have looked counterclockwise at the strain vectors lying on the most external circunferences centered in the wires and counted the times that these vectors rotate . for a strain field , this number is its associated winding number . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that 8-index and zinc - blende wires have distinct winding numbers suggests the formation in the latter of either twins or stacking faults . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the calculated electronic bands show that zinc - blende and hexagonal phases are half - metallic , while the strain - induced most stable crystal structure is metallic with also large velocities for the carriers . </S>",
    "<S> our results thus bring into contact the threefold polymorphism of mnas nanowires with their electronic and magnetic properties , and they broaden the applicability of shape memory mnas in nanomagnetism and spin - based nanoelectronics . </S>"
