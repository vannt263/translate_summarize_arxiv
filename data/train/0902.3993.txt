    "however , this illustrates that even precision measurements of the chemical composition and spectrum of crs may not be enough to resolve conclusively just where the galactic - to - extra - galactic transition occurs .",
    "an important clue in resolving this puzzle would be the identification of the cr accelerators themselves .",

    "[ conclusions ] and provide derivations of the results referred to in the main text in the appendices .",
    "cosmic rays originating in cosmic accelerators will typically be accompanied by gamma - rays and neutrinos .",
    "this is a consequence of the inelastic hadronic processes which are involved in their production mechanism  @xcite .",
    "candidate sources for the highest energy crs such as blazers or gamma ray bursts are expected to accelerate charged particles by the 1st - order fermi process or ` diffusive shock acceleration ' in which they repeatedly scatter off a propagating plasma shock front ( see ref .",
    "( it is also possible that uhe crs are accelerated by the 2nd - order fermi process , _",
    "e.g. _  in the extended lobes of radio galaxies  @xcite . ) for efficient acceleration up to the highest observed energies this process has to be repeated many times hence it is essential that a magnetic field confines the charged particles for sufficiently long in the vicinity of the shock front .    accelerated electrons and other light charged particles will lose their energy in the magnetic field due to synchroton radiation .",
    "the resulting photons provide a target for protons and heavier nuclei to undergo meson photo - production and photo - disintegration , respectively .",
    "a neutron produced in this process may escape out of the magnetically confined source before it @xmath14-decays into a cr proton . to maintain the efficiency of the acceleration mechanism , such interactions need to be much less frequent than the acceleration cycle . charged and neutral pions decay further into high energy neutrinos and gamma rays which are not confined by the magnetic field and can be emitted from the source .",
    "here we focus on cosmic proton accelerators . depending on the relative ambient gas and photon densities ,",
    "charged pion production may proceed either through inelastic @xmath15 scattering  @xcite , or photopion production predominantly through the resonant process  @xcite .",
    "the subsequent decay chain produces high energy neutrinos with an initial flavor ratio @xmath16 of @xmath17 , which is expected to evolve through oscillations into approximately @xmath18 after propagation over cosmological distances  @xcite .",
    "the relative luminosity of neutrons and neutrinos depends on various details of the source  @xcite .",
    "since the interaction time scale of protons and neutrons is similar , the relative luminosity of neutrinos will tend to be _ higher _ in sources which are optically thick to @xmath19 interactions .",
    "the life - time , geometry , bulk motion , and magnetic field of the source limits the maximal energy of the emitted protons  @xcite . also important are cooling processes of the muons and pions in the source prior to decay , such as adiabatic losses due to the expansion of the source , inverse compton scattering , bethe ",
    "heitler pair production , and synchrotron radiation losses  @xcite .",
    "our working hypothesis in the following can be expressed in terms of the time scales of @xmath20 and @xmath15 interactions ( @xmath21 and @xmath22 ) , the decay lifetimes of neutron , pion and muon ( @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 ) , the cooling time scale of charged particles ( @xmath26 ) , the characteristic cycle time of confinement ( @xmath27 ) , and the total confinement time scale ( @xmath28 ) : ( @xmath29 ) @xmath30 ; ( @xmath31 ) @xmath32 ; ( @xmath33 ) @xmath34 ; ( @xmath35 ) @xmath36 ; ( @xmath37 ) @xmath38 .",

    "each proton - photon interaction will produce @xmath41 neutrinos per neutron with relative energy @xmath42 per neutrino , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath43 in the following , we will consider a ( hypothetical ) source , where photo - pion interaction proceed exclusively via the @xmath40 resonance with fixed values @xmath44 and @xmath45  @xcite , and the blazar flaring state model  @xcite that has been previously discussed in ref .",

    "_  ( @xmath33 ) ) , then the neutrino to neutron ratio would also be enhanced due to neutron re - conversion into protons through @xmath14-decay and @xmath60 interactions , as well as simultaneous production of additional neutrinos .",
    "the optical thickness of the source depends on the intensity of the radiation field as well as the characteristic size @xmath61 of the acceleration region .",
    "in particular , gamma - ray bursts , possible sources of uhe crs , are optically thick for proton energies larger than @xmath62  gev given standard parameters  @xcite so we do not consider direct neutrino emission from such sources in the following ( conservative ) analysis .    however , if the target photon field gets too thin so that @xmath63 ( _ cf . _  ( @xmath33 ) ) , then the source would rather accelerate protons to higher energy than emit neutrons through photopion interactions . whereas this does not change the ratio ( [ ratio ] ) and our analysis remains conservative , both neutron and neutrino emission become inefficient .",
    "this is important for neutrino energies below a few @xmath64  gev in blazars  @xcite , hence we will not use experimental neutrino bounds below @xmath64  gev for these candidate sources .",
    "however , one can envision cosmic ray sources in which there is substantial leakage of protons from the vicinity of the shock wave , which however remain trapped in the source magnetic field until they interact with the photon background , producing neutrons and neutrinos .",
    "thus , in our general analysis of optically thin sources we extend the energy range down to @xmath65  gev .",

    "inverse compton cooling is the most relevant process for photointeractions of pions and muons  @xcite and its time scale can be related to the synchrotron loss time via the relative co - moving energy densities of photons and the magnetic field , @xmath66 . here",
    ", we have introduced the equipartition parameter @xmath67 which can exceed 1 in baryon - loaded flows due to the low radiation efficiency of relativistic protons  @xcite .",

    "hence , we will estimate the time - scale of secondary particle cooling by @xmath69 .",
    "synchrotron losses of secondary pions and muons in the background magnetic field are important if their lifetime @xmath70 is larger than the energy loss time @xmath69 , given by , @xmath71 and @xmath72 . ]",
    "@xmath73 with muon and pion lifetimes of @xmath74 and , respectively , this translates into a critial energy in the observatory frame @xmath75 above which our relation between neutron and neutrino luminosities is unreliable .",

    "the luminosity relation  ( [ ratio ] ) between neutrinos and crs in optically thin sources was first used  @xcite to derive an upper limit on the diffuse neutrino background from uhe cr observations .",
    "this argument was modified and extended in further studies which examined if the upper limit on the neutrino flux could in principle be _ exceeded _  @xcite . with the advent of km@xmath112-scale neutrino telescopes like icecube these limits will soon be tested  @xcite .",

    "[ fraction ] .",
    "the envelope of the corresponding proton flux gives the integrated upper limit on the proton fraction .",

    "[ fraction ] .",
    "again , the envelope of the corresponding proton fluxes provides the differential upper limit on the proton fraction .",
    "note , that this differential bound is more general and does not make the usual assumption that the neutrino energy spectrum is @xmath126 , but is in general weaker than the integrated limit by up to a factor of 10 .",
    "one year of observation with the fully deployed icecube detector should increase the sensitivity to diffuse neutrino fluxes by about an order of magnitude below @xmath115  gev .",
    "it is conceivable that this sensitivity can be extended to uhe neutrino energies of about @xmath76  gev  @xcite .",

    "as noted earlier , the interplay of a random walk of cosmic protons in magnetic fields together with an inhomogenous distribution of their sources may result in suppression of the observed proton flux below about @xmath11  gev  @xcite .",
    "hence , we expect that our upper limit on the proton flux in this energy region is rather conservative .",
    "in addition , a source evolution much stronger than the star formation rate ( [ hsfr ] ) would predict a much higher flux of neutrinos  cosmogenic as well as from the sources  whereas the spectrum of protons is fixed by the contribution of local sources within the ` gzk horizon ' .",
    "the flux of cosmogenic neutrinos , which dominates the total neutrino flux above @xmath76  gev , can also in principle be exploited to obtain bounds on the proton fraction independent of the nature of the sources  @xcite . however , since the cr flux is steeply falling as @xmath127 , to constrain the contribution of trans - gzk protons would require even more sensitive experiments than icecube and/or a significantly stronger source evolution with redshift than we believe is plausible . in the lower panels of fig .",

    "exactly where the transition occurs between the galactic and extra - galactic components of uhe cosmic rays is presently an open question and identifying this energy would provide important clues to unravelling their origin .",
    "the acceleration of crs in extra - galactic sources would be accompanied by the emission of high energy neutrinos , thus an upper limit on the proton flux can in principle be inferred from experimental bounds on the extra - galactic uhe neutrino flux .",
    "we have demonstrated this , focussing on blazar jets which we have argued are optically thin sources , so photo - hadron interactions generate a certain minimum flux of uhe cosmic neutrinos as long as proton diffusion and secondary particle cooling are negligible .",

    "<S> the transition can occur without such flattening but this requires some degree of conspiracy of the spectral shapes and normalizations of the two components . </S>",
