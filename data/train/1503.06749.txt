    "the harmonic oscillator can generate steady - state heat flow problems if the temperature varies in space@xcite : @xmath7    somewhat paradoxically , the nos - hoover motion equations as well as all the others we consider here are _ time - reversible _ , even away from equilibrium .",

    "no singly - thermostated oscillator models were found to be ergodic .",
    "this letter announces our recent achievements toward the longstanding goal of ergodic singly - thermostated oscillator models .",
    "we have carried out a comprehensive exploration of a previous model claimed to be ergodic , and found that it is not . as a result of those investigations",
    "we have found a path leading to a singly - thermostated and physically motivated ergodic model for the harmonic oscillator .",
    "we lay out the details of these discoveries in what follows and encourage the reader to help explore the new areas opened up by our work .",
    "in 2001 sergi and ferrario [ sf ] announced that they had found an ergodic thermostated oscillator model@xcite . here , and in what follows , we will ignore the fact that sf actually solve the above _ four _ equations , not just the three shown below : @xmath13 } \\ , \\ ] ] this is because their work was based on a hamiltonian with two degrees of freedom .",
    "the fourth equation , for the evolution of a variable which is the time integral of @xmath3 , plays no role at all in the dynamics of @xmath14 and can so be ignored , which we do throughout .",
    "this extraneous variable obscured the fact that sf implicitly claimed ergodicity for a _ singly_-thermostated oscillator .",
    "as a result , this desirable feature of their relatively widely - cited paper has been previously ignored . however , as a consequence of removing @xmath15 , the symplecticity of the dynamics disappears .    like the nh model the sf oscillator has mirror symmetry @xmath16 .",
    "in addition the time reversibility of the sergi - ferrario equations requires that the functions @xmath1 and @xmath3 , _ as well as the parameter _",
    "@xmath17 , all change sign in the reversed motion with the coordinate values unchanged . for clarity",
    "we have replaced sergi and ferrario s parameter `` @xmath6 '' by @xmath17 throughout the present work .",
    "this change emphasizes that an increase in @xmath18 reduces the response time of the thermostat terms .",
    "sergi and ferrario claimed that their four [ but actually only three , for the reason just cited ] oscillator equations@xcite were ergodic ( filling out the entire three - dimensional gaussian distribution ) for @xmath19 .",
    "that surprising claim sparked the present work . to begin our exploration of their model",
    "we carried out a simulation of the sf equations with the temperature @xmath2 and parameter @xmath17 both equal to unity and with the initial conditions @xmath20 .",

    ", width=384 ]    rather than abandoning the sf approach we also looked for modifications that might be ergodic . changing the parameter @xmath24 from 1 to 2 or 3 or 4 or 5 or 6 and applying due diligence led in each case to the discovery of nested tori .",
    "typically the tori penetrate the plane @xmath25 in four widely - separated distinct places .",

    "viewed in the @xmath28 plane , diligent searches showed that the six choices of @xmath17 shown in figure 2 , _ all _ include simple tori centered on a periodic and embedded in a chaotic sea .",

    "the rotation of the triangle seen in the closeups ( with linear zooms of factors of ten and one hundred ) from longest - side-``up '' to longest - side-``down '' suggests a singular region in between , which further investigation locates near @xmath47 .",

    "the periodic orbit is shown in * figure 5*. a zoom into this region by a factor of ten million places an upper limit of @xmath48 on the size of the thin torus that presumably surrounds the periodic orbit .",
    "the limiting torus has a winding number of ( 1/3 ) , which means that the orbit rotates through an angle @xmath49 the short way around the torus for each time around the long way .",
    "since the periodic orbit is a neutrally stable fixed point in the poincar section , it is surrounded by a region that very slowly fills in by orbits approaching from the chaotic sea that spend a long time in its vicinity , an example of which is evident in figure 4 .",

    "same _ result in 2010@xcite .",
    "we discovered this by noticing that their figure 2 looked identical to patra and bhattacharya s figures 2c and 2d in reference 15 .",
    "the key to understanding ergodicity and its lack in these simple oscillator systems lies in distinguishing two qualitatively different types of `` holes '' in the cross sections of the flow .",
    "we turn to that next .",
    "the holes found here in the cross sections are reminiscent of those found recently by patra and bhattacharya@xcite .",
    "they investigated the two unstable fixed points generated by the four - dimensional mkt oscillator equations . evidently the centers of the largest holes found in the present work typically include fixed cycles of four repeating points of the mapping from one penetration of the plane at @xmath25 to the next ( three intermediate penetrations separate pairs of point repetitions ) .",
    "the holes are especially clear for the case @xmath68 in figure 2 .",
    "* figure 4 * illustrates a relatively sensitive case , @xmath69 , using the original sergi - ferrario equations with linear friction .",
    "apart from four tiny similar holes in the section , the chaotic sea outside them has a gaussian distribution .",
    "this is consistent with the largest of the long - time - averaged lyapunov exponents ( as well as with the complete spectrum of four exponents ) vanishing for all those trajectories which pass through the holes .",
    "we took the precaution of solving this problem with three different integrators ( fourth - order , fifth - order , and adaptive runge - kutta ) and a variety of fixed and variable timesteps , all in a diligent effort to avoid numerical errors . for a purely - hamiltonian harmonic oscillator",
    "it is well - known that the fourth - order method gradually loses energy while the fifth - order method gains .",
    "the good agreement of all three integrators with one another shows that the nonlinearities of the differential equations dominate the errors ( on the order of @xmath70 or less at each timestep ) from the finite precision of the simulations . by simply searching for holes and evaluating the largest lyapunov exponents within them , or by evaluating the largest lyapunov exponents for millions of randomly - chosen initial conditions",
    "it is relatively easy to separate the chaotic and quasiperiodic regions .",
    "three families of singly - thermostated oscillators , with linear , quadratic , and cubic friction , were formulated to obey gibbs canonical distribution for an oscillator . all provided chaos but none was ergodic . in the linear case it is possible that there _ is _ a ergodic solution in the vicinity of @xmath71 .",
    "we can place an upper limit , @xmath72 , on the nonergodic measure there . in every case we examined ( with independent calculations in india , nevada , and wisconsin ) the cross sections revealed _ mixed _ solutions , holes containing nested tori embedded in a chaotic gaussian sea .",
    "* figure 5 * shows such a stable torus .",
    "this situation bears a qualitative resemblance to solutions of the original nos - hoover oscillator .",
    "visualization and the local values of the largest lyapunov exponent are the two most valuable tools for distinguishing the two solution types . to evaluate the local exponent @xmath26 requires both a `` reference '' trajectory and a nearby `` satellite '' .",
    "this increases the computer time required by only a factor of two .",
    "it is convenient to rescale the separation between the two similar trajectories ( by displacing the satellite toward the reference ) @xcite at every timestep so as to determine @xmath26 .",
    "these three - dimensional oscillator problems help illuminate features of ergodicity searches for the four - dimensional flows obtained with two thermostat variables .",
    "our work here has shown that the sergi - ferrario oscillators are at best seldom ergodic ( assuming only that the hundreds of cases we examined are typical ) .",
    "a particularly fascinating aspect of the fully time - reversible sergi - ferrario model is the symmetry breaking illustrated in * figure 6*. the forward structure of the flow s lyapunov instability is much more complex than the totally different backward structure despite the fact that any trajectory obeying the sf motion equations can be followed just as well backward as forward .",
    "this `` arrow of time '' asymmetry of the largest lyapunov exponent @xmath26 for a simple fully time - reversible flow deserves further study .",
    "we recommend the challenge of taking up the search for ergodic three - dimensional oscillator models . in pursuing this elusive goal",
    "it seems to us highly desirable to maintain the conventional relation between the coordinate and the velocity , @xmath73 .",
    "it is also desirable to resist such physically - artificial accelerations as the @xmath55 contribution to the thermostat variable @xmath3 . at their best control variables should utilize transparent and meaningful origins .",
    "it is certainly possible that with increasing computer power searches such as those carried out by sprott@xcite could uncover a host of new variations of the sergi - ferrario or sergi - ezra - patra - bhattacharya equations which are simultaneously robust , useful , physically meaningful , and , above all , _",
