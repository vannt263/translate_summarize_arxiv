    "the cluster model of quantum computation , or one - way quantum computation @xcite , is an alternative approach to the standard circuit model for quantum computing @xcite . in the cluster model ,",
    "a special type of entangled state is used as a resource for cluster computation .",
    "these resource states are known as cluster states .",
    "a cluster computation is basically a sequence of elementary , ` half ' teleportations @xcite where quantum information is not only transmitted through a cluster state but also manipulated in any desired way depending on the specific choice of the measurement bases at each teleportation step .",
    "as opposed to standard - teleportation - based schemes , the measurements in a cluster computation are all local ( subsequently performed on the individual nodes of the cluster ) . in order to achieve universal quantum computation using a fixed cluster state , active feedforward",
    "is needed , where the measurement bases of subsequent measurements have to be adjusted according to the outcomes of the earlier measurements .",
    "cluster states and cluster computation were originally proposed for discrete variables ( dv ) , namely qubits @xcite .",
    "more recently , the cluster - state model was then extended to the regime of continuous variables ( cv ) @xcite , in which universal cluster states can be approximated by experimentally highly accessible gaussian multi - mode squeezed states of sufficiently many quantized optical modes ( qumodes ) . both for dv and for cv",
    ", the cluster - state model is known to be equivalent to the circuit model in the sense that any finite - dimensional ( qubits ) as well as any infinite - dimensional ( qumodes ) operation can be efficiently realized in a cluster - based scheme .    for dv , an arbitrary single - qubit rotation ( unitary )",
    "can be exactly decomposed into three elementary single - qubit rotations @xcite . therefore , even though the whole set of single - qubit unitaries is continuous , concatenating three elementary ( but continuous ) single - qubit rotations in a three - step cluster computation using a linear four - qubit cluster state is sufficient to achieve universality in the single - qubit space .",
    "such elementary rotations by general angles would include so - called non - clifford gates ; in this case , feedforward is required during the cluster computation . as a result , provided that the continuous , elementary single - qubit rotations can be implemented in an error - resistant fashion , any multi - qubit unitary can be performed by connecting sufficiently many linear four - qubit clusters by vertical wires through which a fixed two - qubit entangling gate can be applied when needed .    in the case of cv",
    ", there are various subtleties , even in theory .",
    "first , independent of the cluster model , an arbitrary single - qumode transformation ( represented by a hamiltonian which is an arbitrary polynomial of the qumode s position and momentum variables ) must include ( arbitrary ) higher - order , nonlinear ( non - gaussian ) transformations @xcite .",
    "for this purpose , full universality has been shown to be asymptotically approachable through infinite ( but efficient ) concatenation of a finite set of elementary unitaries , each lying in the neighborhood of the identity , and including at least one nonlinear gate @xcite .",
    "secondly , when utilizing cluster states , in order to satisfy the above notion of full universality for cv , sufficiently large ( potentially infinite ) squeezing of the gaussian cluster state is required , as otherwise the asymptotic concatenation of elementary gate teleportations would accumulate an infinite amount of finite - squeezing - induced errors . the second issue here , the issue of finite squeezing , is then related with the first issue , the issue of full universality for cv based on infinite , elementary - gate concatenation .",
    "although it has been proven that the squeezing per mode needed to create a universal gaussian cluster state of fixed accuracy does not depend on the size of the cluster state ( and hence on the size of the computation it is used for ) @xcite , the errors in a cluster computation using a fixed - accuracy cluster would nonetheless grow arbitrarily with the length of the computation ( and the size of the cluster ) .    in this paper , we focus on a restricted class of cluster computations , namely those realizing linear , gaussian transformations corresponding to quadratic hamiltonians .",
    "more generally , these transformations are referred to as linear unitary bogoliubov ( lubo ) transformations . in this case",
    ", it is well - known that arbitrary quadratic hamiltonians can be exactly and finitely decomposed into elementary quantum optical elements such as single - mode squeezers and beam splitters @xcite .",
    "a perfect simulation of the total hamiltonian no longer requires an infinite concatenation of these elementary optical gates ; each elementary gate no longer has to be weak and may even be far from the identity .",
    "these properties greatly simplify the theoretical analysis and the experimental implementation of lubo transformations through cluster computation over cv .",
    "as the gaussian transformations play the roles of the clifford gates for cv , the measurements in a gaussian cluster computation may all be done in parallel ( ` gaussian parallelism ' ) ; moreover , local homodyne detections on the individual qumodes of the cluster are sufficient to achieve any multi - mode lubo transformation @xcite .    despite these known simplifications and possibly because of the known impossibility of full universality in the case of gaussian cluster computations , so far there has been no explicit derivation of universal cluster states for gaussian / clifford computations which would include an explicit choice of homodyne measurements on a specifically shaped finite - sized cluster state realizing operations far from the identity .",
    "it has only been shown how a single - mode squeezing transformation can be approximately applied to an arbitrary input state attached to a perfect ( infinitely squeezed ) , linear four - mode cluster state @xcite .    here",
    "we shall give several such explicit derivations .",
    "in particular , we show that an arbitrary one - mode lubo transformation can be _ perfectly _ achieved through an ideal four - mode linear cluster state .",
    "further , we show that an arbitrary input state can be coupled to the cluster state using standard quantum teleportation @xcite . finally , we present a simple idea that enables one to implement an arbitrary multi - mode gaussian transformation . even though we will not give a provably optimal , multi - mode solution with regard to the size of the cluster , in our proposed scheme , the dependence of the cluster size is quadratic on the number of the input modes and this order coincides with the minimum order of elements required for general multi - mode gaussian transformations .    as a consequence of our results ,",
    "the efficient experimental implementation of _ any _ multi - mode lubo transformation on _ any _ optical multi - mode quantum state ( especially including non - gaussian input states ) becomes possible using the existing optical schemes for efficient , deterministic creation of gaussian cluster states @xcite .",

    "one important thing here is that the qnd coupling @xmath10 is an element of the clifford group @xmath25 , which is a group that consists of the normalizers of the heisenberg - weyl ( hw ) group @xmath26 , i.e. ,  @xmath27 .",

    "more conveniently , when @xmath40 for all @xmath8 , none of the chosen measurement bases depend on any measurement outcomes such that all the measurements can be performed in any order .",

    "we complete this discussion by presenting the explicit choice of parameters @xmath136 .",
    "the total matrix for four steps is , @xmath137 an arbitrary one - mode gaussian operation represented by @xmath138 can be decomposed into @xmath135 , as follows , @xmath139 where @xmath130 is a free parameter which should be typically chosen such that @xmath140 , unless the numerators of @xmath141 and @xmath142 in the above equations are zero , for which @xmath143 may become zero .",
    "one simple example is the identity operation @xmath144 , which corresponds to @xmath145 .    as those operations which are not achievable through a three - step computation are only a small subset of the whole set of gaussian operations",
    ", one might just consider approximations infinitesimally close to them .",
    "however , in the realistic case , this is not a good strategy , because the squeezing of the ancilla cluster states will be finite . in this case , the finite - squeezing - induced excess noise grows arbitrarily big for three - step circuits that aim at sufficiently closely approximating otherwise unachievable operations . in the four - step case , however , such large excess noises are avoided , and furthermore , the extra degree of freedom can be exploited to minimize the excess noise .",
    "for clifford one - mode one - way quantum computation , it is straightforward to apply the results of the preceding section on universal one - mode lubo transformations directly to the most general scenario where an arbitrary input quantum state is attached to the ancilla cluster state through qnd coupling . in this general case ,",
    "the input state may have been already processed and may correspond to the output of an earlier quantum computation .",
    "a crucial question then is how to achieve this input coupling between a fragile input quantum state and the ancilla cluster state in an efficient and practical way . in this section",
    ", we address this issue .",
    "note that there is an essential difference between the qnd couplings for the initial ancilla squeezed states and those that couple an input state to the ancilla state .",
    "arbitrary ancilla cluster ( or graph ) states can be built through linear optics using beam splitters and offline single - mode squeezed states , as has been shown theoretically @xcite and also demonstrated for some examples experimentally @xcite .",
    "hence , as opposed to the actual input - cluster coupling , the qnd couplings for cluster generation can be effectively replaced by beam splitters .",
    "of course , there are situations when the input state may not be coupled to the cluster from the outside . in principle",
    ", an arbitrary multi - mode state can be prepared as a subset of modes from a larger cluster state , and , in this case , there is no need to prepare an independent input state before the cluster - state generation .",
    "one may just prepare any desired state within the cluster and then proceed with the quantum computation .",
    "such a strategy , however , can be rather inefficient , especially , in a one - way computation with gaussian cluster states @xcite . furthermore , there might be situations in which the input coupling is necessary , for instance , when an unknown state has been transmitted through a quantum channel and is to be further processed through cluster computation .",
    "provided that efficient qnd couplings are available , we may just prepare the ancilla cluster state offline , and attach an input state to the cluster through qnd coupling .",
    "however , alternatively , we may also employ a nonlocal measurement for this input coupling . a so - called bell measurement , which is the two - mode measurement used in quantum teleportation @xcite , is the prime example for such a nonlocal measurement . in the following",
    ", we will discuss this type of coupling for arbitrary input states through quantum teleportation . in an optical realization ,",
    "an important advantage is that the bell measurement can be easily implemented with a beam splitter and two homodyne detections @xcite .",
    "figure  [ figabstractbs ] shows a typical diagram of the input coupling , in which a two - mode input state ia attached to the cluster through bell measurements on the input modes together with suitable ` port ' modes from the cluster state .",
    "we will discuss only this situation , though there are many other possible configurations that might complicate the problem .",
    "quantum teleportation with cv uses an einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) type state as a resource .",
    "the key point for our proposal is that a two - mode cluster state is an epr state , up to a local fourier transform .",
    "thus , the end nodes of a cluster state can be considered as an epr pair , one half of which is connected to the rest of the cluster state through qnd interactions . by performing a bell measurement on a single - mode input state and a cluster end node ( the unconnected half of the epr state ) ,",
    "the input state will be teleported to the connected side of the epr pair , located at the edge of the cluster state . in the case",
    "that the input state is an @xmath23-mode ( entangled ) state , @xmath23 independent quantum teleportations using @xmath23 cluster end nodes would couple the input to the cluster , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ figabstractbs ] .",

    "however , by modifying the nonlocal measurement basis compared to the bell basis , this teleportation does not only couple an input state to the cluster , but it also manipulates the input state correspondingly . with the above beam splitter coupling and subsequent homodyne measurements , the possible operations are gaussian , as we will see below .",

    "however , teleportation - based coupling followed by an additional elementary step , @xmath207 does allow for arbitrary real values of @xmath208 except @xmath209 ; thus , using the lemma , yet another additional step @xmath210 added to @xmath211 does the trick and achieves gaussian one - mode universality .    in order to prove the above statement , we have to show that @xmath208 covers @xmath204 . for @xmath212 ,",
    "the unreachable points of @xmath213 in @xmath204 are those of @xmath214 ; the corresponding set is @xmath215 , using the same arguments as for @xmath197 .",
    "therefore , by showing that an arbitrary point @xmath216 is attainable for some nonzero @xmath143 , the proof is complete . we show this as follows : for @xmath217 , @xmath218 should be nonzero , and @xmath219 .",

    "a solution of these equations is , @xmath227 where @xmath153 is a free parameter , which can be utilized to minimize excess noises , as described above .",
    "note that the problem of zero denominators in the intermediate expressions of @xmath143 and @xmath142 is avoided in the final forms for a suitable choice of @xmath153 .",
    "in the remainder of this paper , as a final issue , we discuss arbitrary multi - mode gaussian operations ( general multi - mode lubo transformations ) .",
    "we will present an explicit way to implement any multi - mode gaussian operation using a finite - sized cluster state and homodyne measurements on it .",
    "the one - way two - mode entangling gate proposed previously @xcite corresponds to a qnd interaction with unit gain ( the same gate that is used to create the ancillary , unweighted cluster / graph state ) . in order to transfer this gate onto a two - mode input state",
    ", the state has to propagate through a two - dimensional cluster state .",
    "even though , in principle , sufficient for achieving universality with cv ( when supplemented by arbitrary single - mode gates ) , the use of a single fixed - gain two - mode interaction gate for multi - mode transformations is rather awkward , as arbitrary two - mode beam splitter interactions have proven very powerful for multi - mode linear optics @xcite .    here , instead of a fixed - gain interaction",
    ", we propose another type of interaction , referred to as a three - mode connection gate .",
    "its configuration is shown in fig .",
    "[ figthreemodeconnect](a),(b ) . in this scheme ,",
    "one ancilla mode would function as a kind of controller of the interaction gain .     and mode @xmath228 are the input modes , while modes @xmath229 , @xmath230 , and 3 are ancilla modes",
    ". the input state may be an entangled state .",
    "measurement results on mode 1 and mode 3 are added ( electronically ) and used to displace mode @xmath229 , while measurement results on mode 2 and mode 3 are added ( electronically ) and used to displace mode @xmath230 .",
    "( b )  a graph representation of ( a ) .",
    "( c ) shows a three - step three - mode connection gate in graph representation .",
    "a phase - free beam splitter can be implemented using this configuration .",
    "measurements and feedforwards are omitted in ( c ) .",
    ", width=283 ]    in fig .",
    "[ figthreemodeconnect ] , mode @xmath231 and mode @xmath228 represent the input modes ( in an arbitrary , potentially entangled two - mode state ) , while mode 3 , mode @xmath229 , and mode @xmath230 are ancilla squeezed vacuum modes . mode 3 plays the role of a controller of the interaction ; mode @xmath229 and mode @xmath230 are the end points for the propagation of quantum information from mode @xmath231 and mode @xmath228 , respectively . as before , links between cluster nodes represent qnd couplings .",
    "the measured variable at mode 3 is @xmath232 where @xmath233 .",
    "the resulting interaction is @xmath234 $ ] .",
    "on the other hand , the measurements on mode @xmath231 and mode @xmath228 correspond to the quadratic phase gates @xmath235 and @xmath236 , respectively , followed by fourier transforms .",
    "note that the above three operators , @xmath234 $ ] , @xmath237 , and @xmath236 , all commute .    as a result , by combining these three measurements ,",
    "an arbitrary two - mode operation is achieved whose lie algebra is quadratic with regard to the position operator @xmath4 , i.e. , @xmath238 .",
    "the subsequent fourier transform effectively swaps the roles of @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "thus , by cascading such three - mode connection gates , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ figthreemodeconnect](c ) , the two modes effectively interact subsequently with alternating quadratures @xmath4 and @xmath5 for every single step .",
    "hence an @xmath239-time cascaded interaction may be written as , @xmath240 where @xmath241 is a two - mode fourier transform , and @xmath242 , @xmath243 .",
    "note that any interaction can be suppressed by setting @xmath244 such that interactions may be only applied whenever they are needed for a fixed cluster state .",
    "the 4@xmath894 matrix representation of the connection gate is , @xmath245 where @xmath246 is a @xmath247 zero matrix and @xmath248 is a @xmath247 identity matrix ; @xmath249 is the matrix representation of the two - mode fourier transform .    to complete the discussion on arbitrary gaussian multi - mode transformations",
    ", we shall use the well - known decomposition of multi - mode gaussian operations , usually referred to as bloch - messiah reduction @xcite . an arbitrary @xmath23-mode gaussian operation @xmath250 ,",
    "whose dof are @xmath63 , is decomposed into the form @xmath251 , where @xmath252 and @xmath253 correspond to passive linear - optics circuits with @xmath254 dof coming from beam splitters ( with some fixed phase ) and single - mode phase shifters ; @xmath255 represents single - mode squeezers applied to each mode",
    ".    the phase shifters and squeezers are one - mode operations which are realizable using at most four ancilla modes , as discussed in detail before .",
    "thus , provided an explicit implementation of a phase - free beam splitter with arbitrary reflectivity @xmath256 is given , we can conclude that any multi - mode gaussian operation is achievable with our specifically shaped , finite - sized cluster ( where our implementation may be suboptimal ) .",
    "a decomposition of the linear - optics circuits @xmath252 and @xmath253 into beam splitters and phase shifters requires at most @xmath257 phase - free beam splitters and @xmath258 phase shifters @xcite .",
    "thus , the number of ancilla modes required for this implementation is quadratic in the number of input modes @xmath23 .",
    "it is now worth noting that the number of dof of @xmath48 is @xmath63 , corresponding to a minimum size of a cluster state for universal multi - mode gaussian operations also quadratic with regard to @xmath23 .",
    "hence our one - way scheme with a total cluster state of size @xmath259 ( using a supply of four - mode linear subclusters and the corresponding subclusters for three - mode connection gates ) would provide an efficient realization of universal multi - mode lubo transformations .",
    "finally , in order to establish the link between the three - mode connection gates and phase - free beam splitters , let us define a phase - free beam splitter with intensity reflectivity @xmath256 , @xmath260 note that @xmath261 .",
    "we have the following relation , @xmath262 ^ 3 \\equiv m_i^3.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the transformation @xmath263 is achieved using a three - mode connection gate , choosing the three parameters @xmath264 , and @xmath265 in the following way , @xmath266 therefore , a phase - free beam splitter with an arbitrary reflectivity @xmath267 can be implemented through a three - step three - mode connection gate .",
    "this would require in total nine ancilla modes .",
    "in conclusion , we have described an explicit implementation for arbitrary one - mode and multi - mode linear unitary bogoliubov ( lubo ) transformations ( gaussian operations ) in the framework of one - way computation over continuous variables using gaussian cluster states and homodyne measurements .",
    "we have shown that an ancillary , linear four - mode cluster state is a necessary and sufficient resource for universal one - mode gaussian operations .",
    "we have also presented a strategy for multi - mode gaussian operations , where beam splitter interactions are used as the sole multi - mode operation .",
    "arbitrary ( phase - free ) beam splitters can be realized in a measurement - based one - way scheme through so - called three - mode connection gates consuming one ancilla three - mode cluster per gate .",
    "every beam splitter requires three such three - mode connection gates , so nine ancilla modes in total .",
    "most importantly , our scheme scales quadratic with the number of input modes such that an ancilla cluster state of size at most quadratic in the number of input modes is sufficient . this scaling coincides with the scaling of the number of elementary optical gates ( phase shifters , beam splitters , and squeezers ) needed for a circuit implementation of general lubo transformations .",
    "we leave a possible optimization of our multi - mode cluster - based scheme for future research .    towards actual experimental demonstrations of the results derived here , we discussed some simplifications for coupling arbitrary input states to a given cluster state .",
    "our simplified scheme would be based on standard quantum teleportation instead of the more expensive qnd coupling .",
    "remarkably , eventually , the coupling qnd gate may just be replaced by a fixed beam splitter , as already through our generalized teleportation scheme , it is possible to manipulate and process the input state to some extent .",
    "one big strength of our scheme is as follows . as it is well - known how to generate arbitrary cluster / graph states using linear optics , by employing the present scheme",
    ", one may now perform a _",
    "general _ multi - mode lubo transformation on an _ arbitrary _ multi - mode input state ( including fragile non - gaussian states ) in an efficient , solely measurement - based fashion .",
    "all potentially inefficient , optical interactions ( such as online squeezing ) would be done beforehand offline for the resource cluster state .",
    "although efficient multi - mode lubo transformations are now , in principle , accessible even for non - gaussian input states , in a realistic scheme , only an approximate , finitely squeezed ancilla cluster state could be used .",
    "therefore , the resulting lubo transformations would become imperfect , depending on the initial squeezing level .",
    "apart from utilizing new experimental schemes with further increasing squeezing levels , one possibility to address the finite - squeezing issue may be in form of some kind of error correction such as postselection @xcite or redundant encoding @xcite .",
