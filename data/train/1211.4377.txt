    "qubit is constantly losing its coherence due to interaction with environment .",
    "dynamical decoupling sequences are proposed to eliminate the unwanted qubit - environment couplings with instantaneous @xmath4 pulses , and efficiency of dd sequences is largely dependent on the pulse locations .",
    "equidistant dd is a first order solution @xcite , while more advanced sequences employ non - equidistant @xcite or concatenated pulse locations @xcite . particularly in this article",
    "we are concerned about udd @xcite , whose pulse locations are @xmath5@xmath6udd sequence was first derived under pure dephasing models @xcite , able to protect the qubit coherence up to @xmath0th order with @xmath0 pulses .    in recent years , dd has been successfully extended to preserve multipartite quantum states @xcite . by nesting layers of udd ( nudd ) ,",
    "total @xmath7 pulses are needed to freeze a system of @xmath1 qubits to @xmath0th order without knowing any details of the qubit - environment coupling @xcite .",
    "it can be seen that in nudd pulse number grows polynomial with pulse order .",
    "however for a specific experimental setup , it is more realistic and efficient to tailor the pulse sequence accordingly , since pulse number is limited during a fixed time interval @xcite and errors from each imperfect pulse will accumulate @xcite .",
    "there are already some efforts to reduce the pulse number .",
    "if prior knowledge is available , such as initial qubit state @xcite , environmental coupling spectrum @xcite or unbalanced decoherence rates @xcite , the above universal plan can be greatly simplified .    in this paper",
    "we introduce another approach to reduce the dd sequence which is needed for a two - qubit system linearly coupled to a common bosonic bath .",
    "this situation may arise when two qubits are not spatially separated enough to create independent environments @xcite , or noises felt by each qubit are correlated @xcite .",
    "in addition , common environment has long been exploited to generate entangling gate and serve as quantum bus between qubits @xcite .",
    "while these gates and buses are idle we can use dd sequences to switch off the interactions and in the meantime protect the states .",
    "as it turns out , the simplified sequence is made very easy to implement .",
    "for example , we can apply udd(@xmath0 ) ( @xmath0-pulse udd ) on first qubit and udd(@xmath1 ) on second qubit . @xmath0 and @xmath1 can be chosen at will as long as they have different parity .",
    "the whole sequence will preserve the bipartite state up to an order of @xmath2 . for @xmath8 ,",
    "this scheme only needs @xmath9 pulses , while nudd(@xmath0 ) needs @xmath10 .",
    "we organize this paper as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we discuss the free dynamics of a two - qubit system in a common bosonic bath . in sec .",
    "iii , controlled dynamics and conditions for high - level dd are derived .",
    "sequences satisfying these conditions are given .",

    "we consider a two - qubit spin - boson model : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the annihilation operator for the @xmath13th mode of the bath and @xmath14 is coupling strength . @xmath15 and @xmath16 are spin operators acting on first and second qubit respectively .",

    ", the free evolution of the composite system can be calculated as follows @xmath22.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the collective term @xmath23 generates an indirect coupling between the two qubits dependent on their states , which will further induce an oscillation of quantum correlations @xcite . in order to preserve an arbitrary state , not only couplings to bath oscillators but also the indirect couplings must be removed . by introducing the spectral density function @xcite defined as @xmath24 , we can then write down the evolution of the density matrix @xmath25 @xmath26 with @xmath27 @xmath28 is the inverse temperature .",
    "the exponentially decaying factor @xmath29 is associated with decoherence process , while @xmath30 represents collective phase evolution .",
    "note that the phase factor is absent in classical noise model @xcite . if two qubits are subjected to the same classical noise",
    ", it is adequate to use simultaneous dd pulses on each qubit .    in the case of quantum noise ,",
    "still by flipping the sign of @xmath15 and @xmath16 with @xmath4 pulses , @xmath29 will be effectively averaged to zero .",
    "however , we can not apply the same sequence on both qubits , since simultaneous @xmath4 pulses will have no influence on the value of @xmath31 and so on phase evolution .",
    "this motivates us to consider the following scenario : @xmath0 pulses of @xmath4 rotation along axis-@xmath32 are applied to the first qubit , with the pulse locations given by @xmath33 , whereas @xmath1 analogous pulses are applied to the second qubit at different times @xmath34 .",

    "while @xmath121 is effectively averaged at low frequencies , the nonlinear part of @xmath122 is uncontrollable .    in the present model",
    "the indirect coupling via a thermal bath is commonly weak .",
    "if there exists highly nonlinear indirect coupling between the qubits , we expect more distinctions will be observed by using different udd sequences .    [ 0.5 ] is heaviside step function . in each of the three diagrams",
    ", red line stands for the same parity , and the other colored line for different parity.[fig3],title=\"fig : \" ]      in order to illustrate the difference caused by the parity , especially the distinct oscillation patterns of quantum correlation under different decoupling schemes , we numerically calculate the entanglement dynamics .",

    "[ fig3 ] we have used concurrence to measure the two - qubit entanglement @xcite .",
    "we consider the dynamical evolution of concurrence versus time under three kinds of environmental spectrum .",
    "we can see that for @xmath124 , the final concurrence at @xmath125 is perfectly kept at the initial level regardless of the parity .",
    "this result is consistent with our earlier observation that the low frequency part of @xmath126 is self - corrected .",
    "however for the other two spectrums , the udd performances are obviously dependent on the parity difference . for @xmath127 , the combination of udd(6 ) and udd(7 ) still preserves the initial entanglement at the end of the decoupling cycle , while udd(6 ) and udd(8 ) fails to do so . since udd(6 ) and udd(8 ) are not able to effectively suppress the indirect coupling between the two qubits , the quantum correlation of their final state is much larger than the initial one .",
    "similar increase can be observed in soft - cutoff spectrum ( @xmath128 ) .",
    "note that in this type of spectrum concurrences can not be well preserved in both combinations owing to severe decoherence @xcite .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , concurrences undergo violent oscillations within the pulse intervals . in contrast with udd(6 ) and udd(8 ) ,",
    "the concurrence that is controlled by the combination of udd(6 ) and udd(7 ) drops more rapidly in the beginning . for @xmath128 ,",
    "the concurrence even reach zero at one point , indicating the entanglement is completely lost .",
    "however at the final stage of the decoupling period , the sequences with different parity have a more smooth and steady concurrence , which makes them more feasible since the loose timing constraint for retrieving the final state , compared with the combination of udd(6 ) and udd(8 ) .",
    "in this paper we give a detailed analysis of available dd sequences which can be used to eliminate both qubit - environment and indirect qubit - qubit coupling in a common bath .",
    "exact dynamics under arbitrary pulse sequences are derived . as we find out",
    ", it is possible to apply udd sequences independently on each of the two qubit , and at the same time preserve the bipartite state to higher order .",
    "this result greatly simplifies the scheme of universal nudd when dealing with correlated environments .",
    "we has proven that by applying udd(@xmath0 ) and udd(@xmath1 ) with @xmath3 odd , the evolutions of all density matrix elements are bounded by the single - qubit filter functions of udd(@xmath0 ) and udd(@xmath1 ) .    in conclusion , we suggest using udd sequences with different parity to protect a dephasing bipartite system , in case that the environments for individual qubit are not completely independent . besides , our results may find applications in quantum information processing due to its superior ability to dynamically switch off the interaction induced by a common quantum bus .",
