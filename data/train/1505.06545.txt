    "the purpose of this paper is to prove the stability and convergence of a stabilized lagrange - galerkin scheme for the navier - stokes equations .",
    "the scheme is a combination of a lagrange - galerkin ( lg ) method and brezzi - pitkranta s stabilization method  @xcite .",
    "it has been proposed by us in  @xcite and , to the best of our knowledge , it is one of the earliest works which combine the two methods , lagrange - galerkin and stabilization .",
    "optimal error estimates are shown for both velocity and pressure .",
    "the lg method is a finite element method embracing the method of characteristics .",
    "the lg method has common advantages , robustness for convection - dominated problems and symmetry of the resulting matrix , which are desirable in scientific computation of fluid dynamics .",
    "many authors have studied lg schemes for convection - diffusion problems  @xcite and for the navier - stokes , oseen and natural convection problems  @xcite , see also the bibliography therein .",
    "the convergence analysis of lg schemes for the navier - stokes equations has been done by pironneau @xcite and improved by sli @xcite .",
    "the analysis has been extended to a higher - order time scheme by boukir et al .",
    "@xcite and to the projection method by achdou and guermond @xcite .",
    "while in these analyses they use a stable element satisfying the conventional inf - sup condition  @xcite , we extend the convergence analysis to a stabilized lg scheme .",
    "the reason to use the stabilized method is to reduce the number of degrees of freedom ( dof ) .",
    "in fact the cheapest p1 element is employed in our scheme for both velocity and pressure , which is based on brezzi - pitkranta s pressure - stabilization method .",
    "hence , the number of dof is much smaller than that of typical stable elements , e.g. , p2/p1 . as a result",
    ", the scheme leads to a small - size symmetric resulting matrix , which can be solved by a powerful linear solvers for symmetric matrices , e.g. , minimal residual method ( minres ) @xcite .",
    "it is , therefore , efficient especially in three - dimensional computation .    in lg schemes",
    "the position at the previous time @xmath0 of a particle is sought along the trajectory , which is governed by a system of ordinary differential equations .",
    "the position at @xmath0 of a particle at a point at @xmath1 is called upwind point of the point or foot of the trajectory arriving at the point .",
    "while the system of ordinary differential equations is assumed to be solved exactly in @xcite , approximate upwind points are computed explicitly without assuming the exact solvability of the ordinary differential equations in  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we may say that the latter schemes are fully discrete .",
    "our scheme is also fully discrete since the approximate upwind points are simply obtained by the euler method . in fully discrete schemes ,",
    "however , it is not obvious that the approximate upwind points remain in the domain , which should be proved .",
    "such difficulty caused by the nonlinearity of the navier - stokes equations is overcome in the proof by mathematical induction , which has been developed in  @xcite .",
    "thus , the stability and convergence with optimal error estimates are proved for the velocity in @xmath2-norm and for the pressure in @xmath3-norm  ( theorem  [ thm : main_results ] ) and for the velocity in @xmath3-norm  ( theorem [ thm : main_results_l2 ] ) under the condition @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the dimension of the space .",
    "this condition is caused from the nonlinearity of the problem and it is not required for the oseen problems  @xcite . a stabilized lg scheme with an @xmath3-type pressure - stabilization for the navier - stokes equations has been proposed in  @xcite , where the exact solvability of the ordinary differential equations is assumed for upwind points .",
    "the optimal error estimates are proved under a strong stability condition @xmath6 for @xmath7 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "our stabilized lg scheme for the navier - stokes equations is presented in section  [ sec : scheme ] .",
    "main results on the stability and convergence with optimal error estimates are shown in section  [ sec : main_results ] , and they are proved in section  [ sec : proofs ] .",
    "the theoretical convergence orders are recognized numerically by two- and three - dimensional computations in section  [ sec : numerics ] .",
    "conclusions are given in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
