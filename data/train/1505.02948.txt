    "in this text we discuss how to build expanders for a certain class of model problems .",
    "these problems were originally solved using the markov bases designed by diaconis and sturmfels @xcite , and they were not rapidly mixing in this setting .",
    "the book by drton , sturmfels and sullivant @xcite is an excellent introduction to algebraic statistics .    for basic facts about expanders and mixing time , we refer to the survey by hoory , linial and widgerson @xcite .",
    "the expanders in this paper are built using the zig - zag product introduced by reingold , vadhan and widgerson @xcite . mixing time and expansion are properties of sequences of larger and larger graphs , not of single graphs .",
    "we are interested in graphs from markov bases and they come naturally in sequences for fixed design matrices . in this paper we do nt study sequences of graphs from different design matrices ; allowing for any design matrices essentially does nt restrict the sequence of graphs and it s hard to make useful statements in that general setting .",
    "we are provided the following data :    _ ( i ) _ a finite set @xmath0 of rational numbers in @xmath1    _ ( ii ) _ a full dimensional polytope @xmath2 in @xmath3    for every positive integer @xmath4 we want to construct a connected graph @xmath5 whose vertex set is @xmath6 and it should be as fast as possible to random walk on @xmath7 the main result of this paper is an explicit construction of graphs @xmath5 that are expanders by a straight - forward application of the zig - zag product .",
    "[ nm ] the vertices of @xmath5 in our model problem have coordinates and we can assign a length to each edge of @xmath5 from the eulidean metric . we consider a wider context than of markov bases : assume that the edge lengths are bounded from above by some @xmath8 for all @xmath9 even as @xmath10 fix an hyperplane @xmath11 that divides @xmath2 into two equal volumes , such that the ( codimension one ) volume of @xmath12 is minimal among those hyperplanes .",
    "removing all vertices of @xmath13 that are within distance @xmath8 from @xmath14 will cut the graph @xmath5 into two disjoint subgraphs of similar orders . as @xmath15 the proportion of vertices removed from @xmath5 to cut it into two pieces tends to 0 , and this proves via the cheeger inequality that we do nt have expansion . in [ algi ]",
    "we make some remarks on this in practice .",
    "a typical problem in algebraic statistics is to random walk on all @xmath16 contingency tables with fixed row and columns sums @xmath17 this is encoded as @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the _",
    "design matrix_. both it and @xmath20 are kept fixed while @xmath4 is allowed to grow . the non - negative integer vectors @xmath21 encode the contingency tables .",
    "the non - negativity condition provides linear inequalities for a usually not full - dimensional polytope , but after restricting to the correct ambient space we have an instance of our model problem . for different @xmath4",
    "we might get different polytopes @xmath22 but one can deduce that they fall into a finite number of versions of our model problem .",
    "windisch have generalised and provided detailed analysis of several aspects of our results , and provided an independent construction of expanders for contingency tables in his preprint @xcite .",
    "we want to construct expanders for our model problem . in the construction",
    "we will refer to the example illustrated in figures [ fig : b ] and [ fig : a ] .                  _",
    "( iv ) _ define a connected @xmath27-regular graph @xmath11 whose @xmath28 vertices are in bijections to the set @xmath29 there are several properties of @xmath11 that would be beneficial but are nt necessary : preferably the neighbours of a vertex should be possible to calculate fast at any vertex , instead of keeping @xmath11 in memory .",
    "it is also preferable if the vertex degree is small .",
    "the brute force way to construct @xmath11 is as a complete graph .",
    "the recommended and more gentle way is to use markov bases , and if necessary add multiple self - loops at vertices to make it regular .",
    "the green big dots in figure  [ fig : b ] are the vertices of @xmath30    _ ( v ) _ we denote the absolute value of the second largest eigenvalue of @xmath11 by @xmath31 it is advisable to have a reasonable upper bound for @xmath32 at this point : @xmath33 should be smaller than one for this construction to achieve expansion as @xmath34 in practice @xmath32 is usually fine when @xmath11 is small and derived from a markov basis .",
    "one can always make @xmath11 denser and push @xmath32 towards @xmath35    _ ( vi ) _ take a regular graph ( expander ) @xmath36 with minimal ( absolute ) second eigenvalue @xmath37 provided that it should have @xmath38 vertices and vertex degree @xmath39 for large @xmath40 we have that @xmath41 see @xcite .    _",
    "( vii ) _ let @xmath5 be the zig - zag product between @xmath36 and @xmath42 see @xcite for the definition and basic properties of the zig - zag product .",
    "the vertex set of @xmath5 is @xmath43 it is a @xmath44regular graph , and the absolute value of its second eigenvalue satisfy @xmath45    _ ( iix ) _ by construction @xmath5 has @xmath46 vertices and there is a bijection @xmath47 we can assume that @xmath48 is represented by @xmath49 and do this fast by modulo arithmetic . compose @xmath50 with @xmath51 this gives a bijection to the translated points of @xmath0 situated inside big cubes whose middle points are inside @xmath52 these points are the small red points inside the jagged green triangle in figure  [ fig : b ] . in figure",
    "[ fig : b ] we had @xmath53 the local transition to from @xmath54 to @xmath55 is drawn in figure  [ fig : a ] .      _",
    "( ix ) _ each of the points of @xmath13 are given by a vertex of @xmath9 and we refer to them as the _ relevant _ vertices .",
    "the other vertices are _ irrelevant _ vertices .",
    "note that as @xmath56 the proportion of irrelevant vertices tends to a constant @xmath57    _ ( x ) _ we random walk on @xmath5 and for each vertex we test if it s relevant or not by evaluating linear inequalities of @xmath58 .",
    "the irrelevant ones are discarded , and for large @xmath4 this is a constant proportion .",
    "we may choose @xmath11 to achieve that @xmath59 for large enough @xmath17 this shows that the second eigenvalue of @xmath5 is bounded away from 1 by a constant as @xmath60 or equivalently :      if the proportion of discarded vertices is too high , it can be pushed arbitrarily close to zero by replacing @xmath2 by @xmath61 for some big positive integer @xmath62 in practical examples this is a bad idea ; it is surprisingly efficient in examples from algebraic statistics to discard a huge proportion , like 99.99% , because the markov basis inside the main construction might be much easier to calculate then .",
    "if we are prepare to discard even more , the blue triangle in figure  [ fig : b ] might be replaced by a box or some other polytope containing @xmath2 that is easy to understand  compare to the extension methodology in optimisation theory .",
    "an obvious extension is to not scale @xmath2 by @xmath4 in all axes but to have different scalings depending on the direction .",
    "it works fine to modify the main construction to achieve this , but we did nt spell it out since it does nt add anything conceptually .    it is tempting to ask if the construction could be recursed , with @xmath11 coming from it , and repeat several times .",
    "this is possible , but not necessary .",
    "the best constructions of expanders already contains a repeated use of the zig - zag product to build them from simple starting graphs . also referring to the theory of expanders ,",
    "see @xcite and @xcite , one should nt think of building them in memory but rather as building an algorithm that is used in each instance of the random walk taking a step .",
    "some of these algoritms are very explicit and we believe that for particular classes of problems from algebraic statistics it should be possible to write down the explicit zig - zag products with the explicit @xmath11 graphs from markov basis , and put this into industry grade software as r or matlab .",
    "[ algi ] the following interpretation is conceptually correct , but not completely correct .",
    "consider the problem of @xmath63 contingency tables with row and column sums @xmath4 let the _ floor _ of a table be that we replace each entry or @xmath64 by @xmath65 the entries of the floor of a table will be @xmath66 or @xmath67 note that we will never have @xmath68 in a row or column of the floor of a table .",
    "the graph @xmath11 in the construction should be thought of as a markov chain on the floors of the contingency tables .",
    "the expander @xmath36 is on @xmath69 vertices because there are @xmath70 degrees of freedom . to get a table back from the floor and the expander",
    ", one would multiply the floor by @xmath71 add the expander values on the top @xmath72 square , and then equate to get the correct row and column sums .",
    "sometimes numbers would become negative when equating , and this corresponds to falling outside the polytope , that is , being an irrelevant vertex .    to be completely clear",
    ", we should also clarify that the theory of expansion focus on when the asymptotic distribution is uniform .",
    "sometimes in algebraic statistics that is not the original setting , and it s not clear how to transfer results to that setup . for the hypergeometric setting",
    "there is a natural way to extend the weights to the irrelevant vertices , and in ( small ) computational experiments by the author it seems like that it s mixing better than in the uniform case . on occasions",
    "the author have also conjectured that to hold in general .    in [ nm ]",
    "we explained why the original markov bases setup does nt provide rapid mixing .",
    "in practice it can anyways be interesting to understand the mixing time , in particular in the hypergeometric setting . for a transition matrix @xmath73 with stationary distibution @xmath74 numerical evidence of slow mixing",
    "is provided by a vector @xmath75 that is far from @xmath74 while @xmath76 is close to @xmath77 in this remark we explain an heuristic how to find such @xmath77 the markov bases are frequently derived from grbner bases , see @xcite . in a grbner basis",
    "there is an order on the variables , and that order can be specified as an weight order on the monomials .",
    "the vertices of our graphs have coordinates , and the coordinates are exponents of the monomials .",
    "thus , there is an induced weight @xmath78 on the coordinates , and it is actually a linear form taking rational values . for some @xmath64 about half of the vertices gets a weight @xmath78 larger than @xmath79 in many problems of algebraic statistics there are symmetries that makes the choice of @xmath64 easy .",
    "define @xmath75 to have value @xmath80 for vertices with weight @xmath81 and value @xmath82 for vertices with weight @xmath83 rescale @xmath75 if necessary .",
    "in [ nm ] we cut a polytope containing the graph by an codimension one hyperplane  this is an explicit construction of that where @xmath84 defines the hyperplane ."
