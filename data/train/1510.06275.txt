    "dark matter , first introduced to explain the flat rotation curves at galactic scales , and the virial mass discrepancy at the galaxy cluster level , is presently considered to be a major component of the universe .",
    "dark matter , assumed to be non - baryonic and non - relativistic , is detected only by its gravitational effects at the scale of galaxies and clusters of galaxies , through observations of the motion of massive test particles @xcite .",
    "however , the particle nature of dark matter still remains mysterious .",
    "the most popular candidates for the dark matter particles are the wimp s , weakly interacting massive , lying beyond the standard model of the particle physics @xcite .",
    "other possible explanations for dark matter include self - interacting fermionic dark matter @xcite , scalar - field dark matter @xcite , or modified gravitational theories @xcite .    in the standard @xmath3cdm ( @xmath3 cold dark matter ) cosmological scenario dark matter",
    "is assumed to be a pressureless , low temperature cold fluid , interacting only gravitationally with itself , and with the cosmic environment .",
    "however , as was shown in @xcite , from the dark matter s lack of deceleration in the bullet cluster collision , the self - interaction cross - section @xmath4 of the dark matter particles with mass @xmath5 can be constrained as @xmath6 @xmath7/g ( 68% confidence limit ) for long - ranged forces .",
    "moreover , by using the chandra and hubble space telescopes observations of 72 collisions , a significant high dark matter self - interaction cross - section @xmath8 @xmath7/g ( 95% cl ) was obtained . from a theoretical point of view",
    "self - interacting dark matter ( sidm ) models were introduced in @xcite .",
    "an assumption which was intensively investigated is the possibility that the dark matter self - interaction is velocity dependent , with the simplest models assuming cross sections of the form @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the dark matter velocity , and @xmath11 is a constant @xcite .",
    "n - body simulations of a class of self - interacting dark matter models , having a non - power - law velocity dependence of the transfer cross section , physically motivated by a yukawa - like gauge boson interaction , were performed in @xcite .",
    "more exactly , and contrary to the standard cold dark matter model case , for self - interacting dark matter there are no subhalos that are more concentrated , as compared to what is inferred from the kinematics of the milky way dwarf spheroidal galaxies .",
    "the rate of dark matter scattering in collapsed structures throughout the history of the universe was estimated recently in @xcite .",
    "if the scattering cross - section is velocity - independent , it turns out that dark matter particle scattering occur mainly at late times in the cosmological evolution of the universe . on the other hand , for dark matter models with a velocity - dependent cross - section ( like , for example , the yukawa potential interactions via a massive mediator )",
    ", the scattering rate has a maximum at around @xmath12 .",
    "this maximum happens in objects with mass less than @xmath13 .",
    "however , from both a fundamental theoretical point of view , and from a phenomenological perspective , _ the physically best motivated self - interacting dark matter model is represented by the bose - einstein condensate dark matter model_.    the idea of the bose - einstein condensation was first introduced from a statistical physical point of view in the 1920s @xcite .",
    "the experimental realization of the bose - einstein condensation in dilute alkali gases was achieved seventy years later , in 1995 @xcite . a very basic and general result in quantum statistical physics",
    "is that at very low temperatures , in a dilute bose gas , all bosonic particles condense to the same quantum ground state , forming a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) . from a physical point of view",
    "the realization of a bec is signalled by sharp peaks in both coordinate and momentum space distributions .",
    "the bose - einstein condensation process starts when particles become correlated quantum mechanically , that is , when their de broglie thermal wavelength is greater than the mean particle distance .",
    "equivalently , the condensation is initiated when the temperature @xmath14 of the system is lower than the transition one , @xmath15 , given by @xmath16 where @xmath5 is the particle mass in the condensate , @xmath17 is the transition density , @xmath18 is boltzmann s constant , and @xmath19 denotes the riemmann zeta function .    generally , and up to now , bec was observed and studied extensively in the laboratory , on a very small scale , rather than at a large galactic / cosmological scale .",
    "however , _ the possibility that bosons also condensate on cosmological or astrophysical scales can not be rejected a priori_. therefore , based on the present day theoretical and experimental knowledge of the bose - einstein condensation processes , it is reasonable to assume the presence of some forms of condensates in the cosmic environment . due to their superfluid properties",
    "some stellar type astrophysical objects , like neutron or quark stars , may contain a significant part of their mass in the form of a bose - einstein condensate .",
    "stars made of bose - einstein condensates were investigated in @xcite .",
    "condensate stars with particle masses of the order of two neutron masses , forming cooper pairs , and with scattering length of the order of 10 - 20 fm may have maximum masses of the order of 2 @xmath20 , maximum central densities of the order of @xmath21 g/@xmath22 , and minimum radii in the range of 10 - 20 km .    the idea that dark matter is in the form of a bose - einstein condensate was considered , mostly from a phenomenological point of view , in @xcite .",
    "a systematic study of the properties of the bec dark matter was initiated in @xcite . in order to study the dark matter condensate the non - relativistic gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) in the presence of a confining gravitational potential",
    "was considered as a starting point .",
    "a significant simplification of the mathematical formalism can be achieved by introducing the madelung representation of the wave function , a standard approach in condensed matter physics .",
    "then the gp equation can be represented in the equivalent form of a continuity equation , and of a hydrodynamic euler type equation . from the madelung representation of the gp equation",
    "it follows that dark matter can be described as a non - relativistic , newtonian bose - einstein gravitational condensate gas , whose density and pressure are related by a barotropic equation of state . to test the validity of the bec dark matter model at the galactic scales the newtonian tangential velocity equation",
    "was fitted with a sample of rotation curves of low surface brightness and dwarf galaxies , respectively .",
    "a good agreement was found between the theoretical rotation curves , and the observational data boha07 .",
    "the properties of bec dark matter were further investigated in @xcite .",
    "in particular , in @xcite it was shown that the non - singular density profiles of the bose - einstein condensed dark matter generally show the presence of an extended core , whose formation is explained by the strong interaction between dark matter particles . the mean value of the logarithmic inner slope of the mass density profile of dwarf galaxies was also obtained , and it was shown that the observed value of this parameter is in agreement with the theoretical estimations obtained in the framework of the bec dark matter model .",
    "the cosmological implications of the finite temperature bec dark matter were considered in @xcite .    an interesting result in the theory of the zero temperature bec dark matter",
    "is that in the case of a condensate with quartic non - linearity , the equation of state is polytropic with index @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the corresponding lane - emden equation , describing the gravitational properties of the condensate , can be solved exactly , and the density profile of the dark matter can be obtained in a simple form . once the bec dark matter density profile is known , all the physical parameters of the condensed system ( mass , radius , central density ) as well as the rotational speeds can be obtained , thus leading to the possibility of a full observational test of the model .    up to now the properties of the bec dark matter",
    "were investigated mostly on the galactic scale .",
    "however , the second important evidence for dark matter comes from the virial mass discrepancy in galaxy clusters @xcite .",
    "a galaxy cluster is a giant astrophysical object formed of hundreds to thousands of galaxies , bounded together by their own gravitational interaction .",
    "they are composed of galaxies , representing around 1% of their mass , high temperature intracluster gas , representing around 9% of the cluster mass , and dark matter , representing 90% of the their mass .",
    "the total masses obtained by measuring the velocity dispersions of the galaxies exceed the total masses of all stars in the cluster by factors of order of @xmath24 200 - 400 @xcite .",
    "the measurement of the temperature of the intracluster medium represents another strong evidence for the presence of dark matter , since the determined depth of the gravitational potential of the clusters requires a supplementary mass component @xcite .",
    "hence galaxy clusters , being dark matter dominated astrophysical structures , are the ideal testing ground for the properties of dark matter .",
    "it is the purpose of the present paper to consider the properties of the bec dark matter at the galactic cluster scale .",
    "thus we extend the previous investigations of the bec dark matter properties at the galactic scale to astrophysical systems consisting of hundreds to thousands galaxies .",
    "we begin our study with a brief review of the properties of self - interacting dark matter bosonic system in bec state . from the non - relativistic gross - pitaevskii equation and its madelung representation of the wave function",
    ", we obtain the pressure of the system for both zero temperature and finite temperature bec dark matter .",
    "we assume that the bec dark matter systems are bound to hydrostatic equilibrium by the gravitational potential of the cluster . meanwhile , we consider that the hot intracluster gas , with density profile described by the standard king s @xmath0-model , is bound to equilibrium in the same gravitational potential .",
    "thus , the knowledge of the hot gas distribution allows as to reconstruct the density and mass distribution of the bec dark matter in the cluster .",
    "this reconstruction is model dependent , and in the present paper we consider three distinct cases : the case of the isothermal gas in gravitational equilibrium with zero temperature bec dark matter , non - isothermal gas in equilibrium with zero temperature bec dark matter , and finally , the case of the isothermal gas in equilibrium with finite temperature bec dark matter . in each of these cases",
    "the dark matter density and mass profiles are obtained , with the radius of the cluster expressed as a function of the astrophysical parameters of the cluster .",
    "the properties of the finite temperature bec dark matter halos in galactic clusters are investigated in detail by using numerical methods .",
    "the fitting of the model predictions via the least-@xmath25 fitting with the observational data for 106 clusters @xcite allows the direct determination of the ratio @xmath26 only , where @xmath5 is the mass of the dark matter particle , and @xmath27 is the scattering length . by combining the obtained values of @xmath28 with the observational self interaction cross sections , we can obtain some upper limits of the mass and scattering length of the dark matter particles .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sect1 ]",
    "we briefly review the basic physical and astrophysical properties of the bec dark matter , and we present the relevant equations of state for both zero temperature and finite temperatures cases .",
    "the zero temperature dark matter properties are investigated in section  [ sect2 ] for the isothermal intracluster gas case .",
    "the cluster dark matter density and mass profiles are obtained analytically , and the theoretical predictions are compared with the observations .",
    "the effects of the variation of the gas temperature on the astrophysical parameters of the zero temperature bec dark matter are investigated in section  [ sectn ] .",
    "the case of the finite temperature bec dark matter is considered in section  [ sect3 ] .",
    "we discuss and conclude our results in section  [ sect4 ] .",
    "in the present section we briefly review the main properties of the bose - einstein condensate dark matter at both zero and finite temperature , and we present the results which will be used in the sequel . for an in - depth discussion of the considered issues , and of the detailed derivation of the main results ,",
    "we further refer the reader to the papers and books @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the starting point in the study of the bose - einstein condensates is the heisenberg equation of motion for the quantum field operator @xmath29 . at arbitrary temperatures the heisenberg equation , describing the dynamics of a bose - einstein condensate ,",

    "we will restrict our analysis to the range of finite temperatures where the dominant thermal excitations can be approximated as non - condensed particles of high energy , with the particles evolving in a self - consistent exterior hartree - fock mean field , whose local energy is @xcite @xmath51 = \\frac{\\vec{p}^{2}}{2m}% + u_{eff}\\left ( \\vec{r},t\\right ) , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath52 $ ] .",

    "this represents a very good approximation , since one can show that the contribution of the anomalous density and of the three - field correlation function to the total density is just of the order of a few percents @xcite .",
    "one of the important properties of the finite temperature bose - einstein condensates is that in the thermal cloud the collision between particles determine the non - equilibrium distribution to evolve towards the standard static bose - einstein distribution function @xmath55 @xcite .",

    "<S> the possibility that dark matter may be in the form of a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) has been extensively explored at galactic scale . in particular , good fits for the galactic rotations curves have been obtained , and upper limits for the dark matter particle mass and scattering length have been estimated . in the present paper </S>",

    "<S> we consider several theoretical models , corresponding to isothermal hot gas and zero temperature bec dark matter , non - isothermal gas and zero temperature dark matter , and isothermal gas and finite temperature bec , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the properties of the finite temperature bec dark matter cluster are investigated in detail numerically . </S>",
    "<S> we compare our theoretical results with the observational data of 106 galactic clusters . using a least - squares fitting , as well as the observational results for the dark matter self - interaction cross section , we obtain some upper bounds for the mass and scattering length of the dark matter particle . </S>",
