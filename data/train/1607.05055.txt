    "an important feature of the approach in @xcite which seems to be absent from other works is that it is constructive and can easily be implemented to obtain explicit images of julia sets representing various shapes .    in this paper , we prove the following generalization of theorem [ thmkl ] .",

    "the proof of theorem [ mainthm1 ] generalizes the method introduced in @xcite by putting it in the more natural framework of potential theory .",
    "more precisely , our approach is based on the observation that in theorem [ thmkl ] , the roots of the polynomial @xmath5 are equidistributed with respect to harmonic measure on @xmath11 . in the connected case",
    ", such points can be obtained as images of equally spaced points on the unit circle under the riemann map .",
    "this , however , does not extend to disconnected sets and in this case , the explicit construction of equidistributed sequences of points is more difficult . nevertheless , this is a classical problem in potential theory which has been extensively studied in the past .",

    "since @xmath222 also has connected complement and @xmath235 are disjoint , we can apply lemma [ lemmajan ] to deduce that @xmath229 also has connected complement .",
    "next , we claim that @xmath0 is totally approximable by the sets @xmath229 .",
    "it suffices to prove that @xmath236 and @xmath237 as @xmath238 .",
    "first , assume for a contradiction that @xmath239 for all @xmath13 , for some @xmath240 and some sequence @xmath241 strictly decreasing to @xmath44 .",
    "then for each @xmath13 , either @xmath242 or @xmath243 . however , note that if @xmath244 , then @xmath75 belongs to a square @xmath180 in @xmath220 , so that the distance between @xmath75 and the boundary of the corresponding square @xmath223 in @xmath222 is less than @xmath245 , hence @xmath246 , for all @xmath4 .",
    "we can therefore assume that the second case , @xmath243 , holds for all @xmath13 .",
    "now , recall that @xmath222 is contained in the @xmath228-neighborhood of @xmath221 .",
    "it follows that for all sufficiently large @xmath13 , we have @xmath247 . then for each such @xmath13 , there is a point @xmath248 such that the disk @xmath249 does not intersect the boundary of @xmath0 , hence must be contained in @xmath250 . passing to a subsequence if necessary",
    ", we can assume that @xmath251 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath252 necessarily belongs to @xmath221 , since the sets @xmath253 form a compact exhaustion of @xmath250 with @xmath254 for all @xmath13 .",
    "this contradicts the fact that for sufficiently large @xmath13 , the disk @xmath255 is contained in the disk @xmath249 , a subset of @xmath250 . therefore @xmath236 as @xmath238 .",
    "it remains to prove that @xmath237 as @xmath238 .",
    "again , assume for a contradiction that @xmath256 for all @xmath13 , for some @xmath240 and some sequence @xmath241 strictly decreasing to @xmath44 .",
    "since @xmath257 and @xmath222 is contained in the @xmath228-neighborhood of @xmath221 , we have @xmath258 , for all @xmath4 .",
    "we can therefore assume that for each @xmath13 , @xmath259 .",
    "then for each @xmath13 , there exists @xmath260 such that the disk @xmath249 does not intersect @xmath261 .",
    "assume without loss of generality that @xmath251 .",
    "then for all sufficiently large @xmath13 , the disk @xmath255 does not intersect @xmath261 . if @xmath262 , then for sufficiently large @xmath13 , the disk @xmath255 contains a square in @xmath263 , and we get a contradiction . if @xmath264 , we get a contradiction with the fact that the sets @xmath253 form a compact exhaustion of @xmath250 .",
    "this completes the proof of the proposition .",
    "now , recall from theorem [ mainthm1 ] that any nonempty compact set with connected complement is totally approximable by polynomial filled julia sets . combining this with proposition [ totapproxprop ]",
    ", we get that any nonempty bounded set whose interior has connected complement is also totally approximable by polynomial filled julia sets .",
    "this proves the converse implication in theorem [ mainthm3 ] .    for the proof of the other implication ,",
    "we need the following elementary lemmas .",
    "[ lem1 ] for any set @xmath265 , we have @xmath266    clearly , we have @xmath267 .",
    "also , if @xmath268 , then @xmath269 , so that @xmath270 , from which we deduce that @xmath271 .",
    "this shows that @xmath272 .    for the other inclusion , if @xmath271 but @xmath273 , then the disk @xmath232 intersects both @xmath212 and @xmath274 . by connectedness , it must intersect @xmath275 , so that @xmath268 .    [ lem2 ]",
    "let @xmath276 be two nonempty proper subsets of the plane with @xmath277 and @xmath278",
    ". then @xmath279 .",
    "we first show that @xmath280 .",
    "let @xmath281 .",
    "if @xmath282 , then @xmath283 , since @xmath284 .",
    "on the other hand , if @xmath271 , then by lemma [ lem1 ] , we have that @xmath285 .",
    "it follows that @xmath286 , so that @xmath287 , from which we deduce that @xmath288 .",
    "in both cases , we get that @xmath289 .",
    "this proves that @xmath280 .",
    "the same argument with @xmath212 and @xmath213 interchanged yields the inclusion @xmath290 , hence @xmath279 , as required .",
    "we can now proceed with the proof of theorem [ mainthm3 ] .",
    "let @xmath0 be a nonempty proper subset of @xmath2 .    as previously mentioned , if @xmath0 is bounded and @xmath22 is connected , then by proposition [ totapproxprop ] and theorem [ mainthm1 ] , the set @xmath0 is totally approximable by filled julia sets of polynomials of degree at least @xmath21 .",
    "conversely , assume that @xmath0 is totally approximable by filled julia sets of polynomials of degree at least @xmath21",
    ". then for any @xmath4 , there exists a polynomial @xmath291 such that @xmath292 and @xmath293 .",
    "clearly , this implies that @xmath0 is bounded , since for each @xmath4 , the set @xmath294 is compact .",
    "it remains to prove that @xmath22 is connected .",
    "assume for a contradiction that @xmath295 , where @xmath10 and @xmath296 are disjoint nonempty closed subsets of @xmath2 .",
    "since @xmath0 is bounded , one of the sets @xmath297 must be unbounded , say @xmath10 , while the other set , @xmath296 , is bounded .",
    "now , fix a point @xmath298 , and let @xmath240 sufficiently small so that @xmath299 . since @xmath300 is a compact subset of the open set @xmath301 , there is a bounded open set @xmath302 with @xmath303 . in particular ,",
    "the boundary of @xmath302 is contained in @xmath304 .",
    "now , let @xmath4 be smaller than both @xmath305 and half the distance between @xmath306 and @xmath307 . since @xmath308",
    ", we have that either @xmath262 or @xmath309 . in both cases , since @xmath310 and @xmath311 by lemma [ lem2 ] , we get that the disk @xmath312 contains a point @xmath313 .",
    "this is enough to obtain a contradiction . indeed , since @xmath314 and @xmath313 , the connectedness of @xmath315 ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 9.4 ) ) implies that @xmath306 must have non - empty intersection with @xmath315 . since @xmath316 ,",
    "again by lemma [ lem2 ] , it follows that the distance between @xmath306 and @xmath295 is less than @xmath317 , a contradiction .",
    "therefore , @xmath22 is connected , as required .",
    "in this section , we illustrate the method of section [ sec3 ] with some numerical examples .",
    "as shown in theorem [ thmexplicit ] , the computation of julia sets approximating a given compact set @xmath10 requires a numerical method for the computation of fekete points for @xmath10 .",
    "unfortunately , the numerical computation of high - degree fekete points is a hard large - scale optimization problem . indeed ,",
    "as far as we know , even for simple compact sets such as triangles , fekete points have been computed only up to relatively small degrees , see e.g. @xcite , @xcite and the references therein . in order to circumvent this issue ,",
    "alternative numerical methods have been introduced for the computation of approximate fekete points : see e.g. @xcite for a method based on qr factorization of vandermonde matrices with column pivoting . see also @xcite for a discussion of the theoretical aspects of this method .    however , for slightly complicated sets , we were not able to use the algorithm of @xcite to compute fekete points of sufficiently high degree , due to rank - deficiency and ill - conditioning issues .",
    "for this reason , we decided to replace fekete points by other equidistributed points , leja points , which are much more convenient from a computational point of view .",
    "this sequence of points , introduced by leja @xcite , is defined inductively as follows .",
    "it is well - known that leja points are easier to compute numerically than fekete points , mainly because they are defined inductively by a univariate optimization problem .",
    "furthermore , this optimization problem can be made discrete by replacing the compact set @xmath10 by a sufficiently refined discretization .",
    "as previously mentioned , leja points are also equidistributed with respect to harmonic measure on @xmath11 , in the sense of proposition [ weakconvergence ] .",
    "in fact , pritsker s theorem [ thmpri ] also holds for leja points , with the same constant .",
    "we can now prove the following variant of theorem [ thmexplicit ] for leja points .",
    "as before , we assume that @xmath3 is a uniformly perfect compact set with connected complement @xmath23 and that @xmath327 is an interior point .",
    "recall then that @xmath328 and @xmath329 are defined by @xmath141 and @xmath330            the proof is exactly the same as in theorem [ thmexplicit ] except that in inequality ( [ eqq ] ) , the use of theorem [ thmfek ] is replaced by the inequality @xmath336 which follows directly from the definition of leja points .",
    "the main improvement here is that the polynomials @xmath337 are easier to compute numerically , even for high values of @xmath13 .",
    "indeed , the computation of @xmath337 only relies on the computation of the first @xmath13 leja points for @xmath10 , since the term @xmath338 can be approximated by the quantity @xmath335 , in view of lemma [ thmleja ] .",
    "now , given the polynomials @xmath337 , the computation of the corresponding julia sets is quite standard and is easily done with matlab , for instance .",
    "we illustrate this with three examples .",
