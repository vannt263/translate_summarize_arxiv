    "charge ordering in strongly - correlated electron systems has recently attracted a lot of attention on account of its possible influence on charge transport and dynamics . in the high - temperature superconductors",
    ", there is evidence for the formation of charge and spin stripes near the commensurate doping @xmath8 in la@xmath9sr@xmath10cuo@xmath1 in which superconductivity is suppressed.@xcite the suppression was attributed to the pinning by lattice distortions of the dynamic charge and spin stripes formed in this phase.@xcite very recently raman scattering in nav@xmath11o@xmath12 compound revealed considerable charge ordering there at t@xmath1335 k.@xcite in the manganates , charge ordering is observed at certain commensurate doping.@xcite the possibility of the coexistence of ferromagnetic and charge - order correlations may be relevant in understanding the phenomenon of colossal magnetoresistance in manganates .",
    "the earliest compound known@xcite to manifest charge ordering is magnetite ( fe@xmath0o@xmath1 ) .",
    "fe@xmath0o@xmath1 is a ferrimagnet below 850  k. at room temperature fe@xmath0o@xmath1 has an inverse spinel cubic structure with the @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) space group.@xcite the unit cell consists of 8 formula units .",
    "there are two types of fe positions in this structure .",
    "the so - called a positions are characterized by the tetrahedral oxygen surrounding the fe ions ; the b positions have octahedral oxygen coordination .",
    "the a positions are occupied only by fe@xmath16 ions , whereas the b positions are occupied with equal probability by fe@xmath17 and fe@xmath16 .",
    "magnetite undergoes a first - order transition ( the verwey transition ) at @xmath18 k , with changes of crystal structure , latent heat , and a two - order of magnitude decrease of the dc conductivity .",
    "this transition was discovered by verwey@xcite in 1939 ; in his model , the low temperature phase has the fe@xmath17 and fe@xmath16 ions at the b - sites ordered , forming layers of ions of each charge state . above @xmath19",
    "there is no long - range order , but short - range order persists .",
    "according to neutron measurements,@xcite an orthorhombic space groups ( either a d@xmath20 or c@xmath21 ) may describe the low temperature structure .    the verwey transition has been intensively investigated since its discovery , bur remains unexplained .",
    "basically , there are several ideas which partly explain experimental results although none is able to give a complete explanation of the transition .",
    "this incomplete theory is probably not surprising in a system where the electron - phonon interaction , the electron - electron interaction , and electronic bandwidth are of nearly the same importance .",
    "we shall mention some basic ideas which could lead to an understanding of the transition .    as already mentioned , verwey and haayman@xcite originally described this transition as an order - disorder transition .",
    "the ordered state is insulating , whereas the disordered state is metallic due to the motion of the extra electron on the b - positions .",
    "later , anderson@xcite argued that short range order ( sro ) is crucial for understanding the transition .",
    "he demonstrated that certain sro configurations are energetically favorable ( anderson s condition ) . in this picture ,",
    "long range order is destroyed above the transition although short - range order , satisfying anderson s conditions , persists above the transition .",
    "the presence of sro above the transition was confirmed by neutron measurements . however , there is still a question why an abrupt increase in conductivity is observed in spite of the persistence of sro above the transition.@xcite    cullen and callen@xcite presented a picture of the transition in which only electron - electron correlations are relevant .",
    "it is assumed , that an fe@xmath17 ion can be represented as an fe@xmath16 ion plus an extra electron . in this case , the physics of fe@xmath0o@xmath1 is just the physics of the interaction of this extra electron with a crystal of fe@xmath16 ions .",
    "the interaction can be described by the coulomb nearest neighbor repulsion and hopping integral for the extra electron .",
    "the competition between these two values determines whether an insulator or metal is obtained .",
    "in contrast mott,@xcite chakraverty,@xcite and yamada@xcite emphasized the importance of the electron - phonon interaction . in the mott@xcite picture of the verwey transition ,",
    "the charge carriers are either polarons or bipolarons . above the transition",
    ", the system can be described as a wigner glass , a system where carriers are localized by the disorder - induced random - field potentials .",
    "when the temperature is raised , some of the polarons dissociate leading to a hopping type of conductivity .",
    "one should note however that an activated conductivity could also be accounted for by the opening of a charge gap .",
    "recent photoemission studies@xcite of magnetite indicate a charge gap of 150 mev below @xmath19 .",
    "a recent optical measurement on magnetite@xcite found that the main temperature - dependent changes of optical conductivity occur below 1 ev , connected with a gap - like temperature - dependant increase of optical conductivity at 140  mev , followed by a broad polaronic peak at 0.6 ev .",
    "the gap - like behavior was attributed to the opening of a charge gap .",
    "the authors of ref .   suggested that the charge gap , determined as the onset of the polaronic band in the spectra below the transition , is consistent with the gap value found in photoemission studies .",
    "in contrast to the statement of ref .  , we must note that photoemission measures the transitions to the fermi level , whereas infrared spectroscopy measures an optically - allowed transition from one electronic band to another across the fermi level .",
    "this means that the optical gap of 140  mev would correspond to smaller gap , perhaps as small as 70  mev , measured in photoemission .",
    "moreover , according to ref .  , the gap does not close above transition but rather decreases by only 50  mev , which is not consistent with the analysis of the optical conductivity of ref .  .",
    "in this paper we present the results of systematic temperature - dependant infrared and raman measurements of magnetite and discuss both lattice and charge dynamics , as well as a possible mechanism of verwey transition .      above the verwey transition temperature , @xmath22 k",
    ", magnetite has a cubic - inverse - spinel structure belonging to the space group o@xmath23 .",
    "the full unit cell contains 56 atoms but the smallest bravais cell contains only 14 atoms . as a result",
    ", one should expect 42 vibrational modes .",
    "group theory predicts the following modes for this phase . @xmath24",
    "the @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 are silent .",
    "thus , there are five raman - active modes ( @xmath29 ) and five infrared - active modes ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "when the system undergoes the verwey transition , the symmetry of the crystal lowers to orthorhombic .",
    "the unit cell doubles along the @xmath31 direction and the diagonals of the former cubic unit cell become the faces of the low - temperature unit cell . as mentioned in ref .",
    ", it has not been possible to get a complete refinement from the neutron scattering data .",
    "nevertheless , we can analyze the proposed space groups and compare the results of the group theory analysis with our data .",
    "let us start with @xmath32 which is a nonstandard setting of the @xmath33 ( no .",
    "the unit cell contains 56 atoms , and in this case we can not reduce the unit cell as was possible for the room temperature crystal structure .",
    "the expected number of modes is 168 .",
    "group theory predicts the following modes for this phase @xmath34 the @xmath35 modes are silent .",
    "thus , there are 78 raman - active modes ( @xmath36 ) and 72 infrared - active modes ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "it is clear from this analysis that one should expect a dramatic increase in the number of modes in the low temperature phase .",
    "some of the new modes are the former brillouin - zone - boundary modes which become visible because of the unit cell doubling ; others are due to the lifting of degeneracy of former @xmath38 and @xmath39-type modes .",
    "some modes persist over the transition .",
    "for instance , the @xmath40 mode of the cubic phase becomes an @xmath41 mode of the orthorhombic phase , having the same raman tensor .",
    "the second proposed symmetry is @xmath42 , ( no .",
    "this group does not contain an inversion center , leading to very important consequences for the raman and infrared spectra .",
    "namely , if magnetite has such a structure below @xmath3 , both infrared - active and raman - active type modes should be detected by both spectroscopes .",
    "experimentally , this is not the case and we can rule this symmetry out .    the symmetry of the raman modes can be figured out by their polarization selection rules .",
    "the @xmath41 and @xmath43-type modes have diagonal raman tensor so that they are seen only when the polarizations of the incident and scattered light are parallel .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 modes have off - diagonal components so that they are observed when the polarizations of the incident and scattered light are perpendicular .",
    "the magnetite single crystals used in this work were grown by a chemical vapor transport technique using stoichiometric fe@xmath0o@xmath1 microcrystalline powder obtained by reduction reaction of ferric oxide ( fe@xmath48o@xmath0 ) .",
    "this procedure yielded near - stoichiometric crystals with typical size of 4x4x2  mm@xmath49 .",
    "x - ray diffraction confirmed the spinel - type structure of the crystals .",
    "transport measurements found the abrupt increase in resistance below @xmath50k , characteristic of the verwey transition .",
    "optical measurements were carried out on the optically smooth surfaces of the as - grown single crystals .",
    "the reflectance was measured in the frequency range of 5045000  @xmath4 ( 6 mev5.5 ev ) at several temperatures between 40 and 300  k. the sample temperature was maintained by mounting the crystal on the cold - finger of a he - flow cryostat . to cover a wide frequency range",
    ", we used three optical set - ups . a bruker ifs 113v spectrometer was employed for the far infrared and mid infrared regions ( 504500 @xmath4 ; 6550 mev ) , a perkin elmer 16u grating spectrometer for the near infrared and visible region ( 380024000  @xmath4 ; 0.473 ev ) .",
    "we observed no temperature dependence of the spectra above 20000 @xmath4 .",
    "therefore , in order to extend the data to higher frequencies ( 20000 - 45000 @xmath4 ; 2.55.5 ev ) we merged the spectrum at a given temperature with the room temperature reflectance spectrum obtained from a zeiss grating spectrometer coupled with microscope , and finally in the frequency range above 45000 @xmath4 we merged our data with the data of ref .  .",
    "in order to analyze the optical properties of the sample we performed kramers - kronig transformation of reflectance data . for the temperatures above the transition , we use drude - lorentz model fit in the low frequency part of the spectrum .",
    "then we calculated the reflectance and used the result for the low - frequency extrapolation .",
    "below the transition , we assume constant dc conductivity at zero frequency as a low frequency approximation .",
    "for the high frequency approximation , we used a power law ( @xmath51 ) extrapolation .",
    "the polarized raman scattering experiment was conducted a wide range of temperatures ( @xmath52@xmath53 k ) using a triple spectrometer equipped with a liquid - nitrogen cooled ccd detector .",
    "the 514.5 nm line of an ar@xmath54 laser was used as excitation with nominally 25 mw incident on the sample .",
    "the spectra were taken in the back - scattering geometry with the scattered light polarized vertically while the incident light is polarized to select a particular component of the raman scattering tensor .",
    "we now proceed to analyze the infrared and raman data keeping in mind all of the above - predicted changes .",
    "the infrared reflectance and optical conductivity are shown in fig .  1 and 2 , while the raman - scattering spectra of fe@xmath0o@xmath1 are in fig .",
    "oxygen phonon modes usually have their frequency above 200 @xmath4 , whereas vibrations of the heavier iron atoms should be at much smaller frequency . in fig .  1 and 2",
    ", two @xmath55 oxygen modes are found near 350 @xmath4 and 560 @xmath4 .",
    "these peaks are similar to the infrared - active phonons reported earlier by different groups.@xcite four raman - active phonons are observed at room temperature in fig .  3 .",
    "the strongest peak at @xmath56670  @xmath4 is either the @xmath40 or the @xmath43 mode since it is only present in the parallel polarization geometry ( xx ) .",
    "since we expect the @xmath40 mode to have the highest frequency as it involves the stretching vibrations of the oxygen atoms along the fe(a)-o bonds , the 670  @xmath4 phonon is assigned to the @xmath40 mode . in fig .",
    "3 , raman spectrum in which the incident and scattered light polarizations are perpendicular contains the predicted three @xmath44 modes at 193 @xmath4 , 308  @xmath4 , and 540  @xmath4 .",
    "verble@xcite made a similar assignment of the raman - active phonons in fe@xmath0o@xmath1 except for the 193  @xmath4 which he did not observe .",
    "instead , he reported that the lowest frequency @xmath44 mode is at 300  @xmath4 as observed in the spectrum at @xmath57 k. however , this feature seen by verble at @xmath57 k ( @xmath58 ) is related to the structural symmetry - breaking that occurs below @xmath3 as discussed below .",
    "the verwey transition manifests itself in both infrared and raman spectra by remarkable changes in the phonon spectrum as the temperature is lowered through @xmath3 . in the raman spectrum , one can see at least 17 new modes below @xmath3 .",
    "in addition to the new phonon modes there is a broad ( about 150  @xmath4 , full width on half maximum ) peak with a maximum at 350  @xmath4 . unfortunately , with so many additional phonon modes it is difficult to judge whether this broad peak is a superposition of phonon modes or a background on which phonon modes are sitting .",
    "there are several additional infrared modes as well . in fig . 1 and 2b",
    ", in addition to the infrared active phonons near 350  @xmath4 and 560  @xmath4 , weak phonon features appear below 300  @xmath4 .",
    "similar effects are observed in the raman spectrum at @xmath52 k as illustrated in fig .",
    "moreover , the verwey transition also leads to renormalization of the phonon frequencies and linewidths . the infrared- and raman - active phonons which persist over the transition were fitted to lorentzian lineshapes in order to obtain their frequency and linewidths .",
    "the results of this analysis are shown in fig .",
    "4 . for the infrared active phonons at 350  @xmath4 and 560  @xmath4",
    ", the phonon frequencies increase upon decreasing the temperature but without visible anomalies around @xmath3 . on the other hand ,",
    "their linewidths manifest an abrupt increase near @xmath3 .",
    "additionally , for the 350 and 560  @xmath4 phonons there is a reproducible fine structure in the reflectance ; see fig .",
    "1b . at temperatures below the transition the lineshape of the",
    "350 and 560  @xmath4 phonons can not be described by a single lorentzian , which leads to bigger error bars for the linewidth and frequency of these phonons below the transition .",
    "see fig .",
    "note that in contrast to the chakraverty@xcite result , within our experimental error we do not observe any soft optical mode .",
    "the observed phonon anomalies can be explained in the following way . above the transition",
    "most of the phonon modes are highly degenerate modes . when magnetite undergoes the verwey transition , the crystal symmetry reduces to orthorhombic , lifting the degeneracy of the modes .",
    "we suggest that splitting , determined by the degree of distortion associated with the symmetry changes , will not be too large .",
    "according to the neutron data@xcite the fe - o distances for both a and b sites are generally within the estimated standard deviations for the prototype structure ; therefore , one expects the splitting to be small , appearing as a broadening of the modes above the transition .",
    "this is what has been observed in our experiment for the two infrared active modes at 350 and 560  @xmath4 .",
    "the frequency and linewidth of the raman - active phonon at 670  @xmath4 in fig .",
    "4 shows an abrupt increase in frequency with a concomitant precipitous drop in the linewidth at @xmath3 .",
    "the symmetry of this mode in the cubic phase is @xmath40 ; it corresponds to the in - phase vibrations of the oxygen ions forming tetrahedra surrounding the fe ions in the a positions.@xcite at the same time , a similar type of displacement for the cubic - orthorhombic structural transition has been found from neutron measurements.@xcite therefore , it is plausible to assume that 670  @xmath4 phonon is directly coupled to the structural displacements at the verwey transition .",
    "this is the reason why this mode is so sensitive to the transition .      at room temperature , in addition to",
    "the phonon features , one notes a gradual decline of reflectance ( fig .",
    "1a ) towards higher frequencies with a distinctive minimum at about 10000  @xmath4 and some weak and almost temperature independent transitions occurring in the visible and ultra violet region .    with decreasing temperature ,",
    "the low frequency reflectance ( below 1000  @xmath4 ) decreases .",
    "below @xmath3 a minimum forms at @xmath56 750  @xmath4 , followed by increased reflectance , with a temperature- dependant hump around 4000  @xmath4 . above 20000",
    "@xmath4 , the reflectance is practically temperature independent .    the optical conductivity derived from the reflectance data",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "2 . aside from the phonon peaks ,",
    "one notes a decrease of the low frequency conductivity ( below 1000  @xmath4 ) with decreased temperature as well as a broad temperature - dependent band at 5000  @xmath4 .",
    "the intensity of this band increases with decreased temperature followed by slight temperature dependent increase of the conductivity towards higher frequencies .",
    "the most interesting aspect of the data is the temperature - dependence , which we will discuss next .",
    "we will base our discussion on the local density approximation calculations of ref .  .",
    "according to these calculations of the single - electron density of states , there are o(@xmath59 ) bands lying about 4  ev below fermi level which is found in the middle of the fe(@xmath60 ) bands .",
    "therefore , the interesting physics relevant to the verwey transition is connected with these fe(@xmath60 ) bands . within the fe(@xmath60 )",
    "bands one should pay special attention to the two spin - polarized bands . let us recall that there are two magnetic sublattices corresponding to the a and b positions in the unit cell , with the spins parallel to each other within one sublattice and antiparallel to the spins in another sublattice . from the electronic structure,@xcite one expects a peak in the optical conductivity associated with the optical transition from b site to b site .",
    "it is clear that such a peak should be sensitive to the verwey transition because the b sites are the sites where ordering takes place .",
    "a good candidate for this peak is the 5000  @xmath4 peak , which changes in intensity with temperature . in the framework of the mott model@xcite of the verwey transition",
    "this is the polaronic peak .",
    "the increase in oscillator strength above 10000  @xmath4 is attributed to the oxygen - iron optical transitions , although some optically allowed transitions from a to b site may also contribute .",
    "another striking feature which should be explained is a gap - like feature in the optical conductivity at  1000 @xmath4 at temperatures below the verwey transition . to analyze changes of conductivity we estimate the oscillator strength or spectral weight in the low - energy region .",
    "the effective number of carriers ( per fe@xmath17 ion ) participating in optical transitions at frequency less than @xmath61 is defined as@xcite @xmath62 where @xmath7 is the free - electron mass , @xmath63 is the effective mass of the carriers , @xmath64 is the unit - cell volume , and @xmath65 is the number of fe@xmath17 ions per unit cell .",
    "one can clearly see in fig.5 an increase of @xmath66 with temperature . for temperatures below the transition",
    ", we found the maximum change in this quantity at frequencies around 1800 @xmath4 . in order to compare the temperature dependence of @xmath66 with the dc conductivity , we show the @xmath66(1800 @xmath4 ) , for different temperatures together with the conductivity in the insert of fig.5 .",
    "the sharp increase of @xmath66 closely resembles the very similar increase in conductivity at the verwey transition .",
    "a similar result was shown by park et al.@xcite    one should note that there are several ways to interpret the gap - like feature in the conductivity .",
    "one can assign such a behavior either to an activated mobility of the form @xmath67 t ) , where @xmath68 is the polaron hopping energy , or to the opening of a charge gap @xmath69 . in later case",
    "the carrier concentration will behave like @xmath70 t ) , leading to activated conductivity as well .",
    "it is clear that both effects may alter the conductivity .",
    "however , the agreement of @xmath66 and the conductivity suggests activation of the free carrier density .    using the definition of @xmath66 we can try to estimate effective mass of the carriers .",
    "let us assume that @xmath66(1800 @xmath4 ) is purely due to the free carrier optical conductivity . in this case",
    ", using the definition of @xmath66 , we can expect @xmath66(1800 @xmath4 , 300k)@xmath71 , which gives us @xmath72100@xmath7 .",
    "now let us compare this number to the effective mass from mott equation:@xcite @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the zero - point phonon energy .",
    "we can get the value of @xmath68 from the polaron peak position .",
    "namely , the peak position ( @xmath56 5000 @xmath4 ) gives us @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the polaron binding energy . in the simple model of an electron jumping between two",
    "molecules@xcite the hopping energy can be estimated as @xmath77 , yielding @xmath78  @xmath4 .",
    "the zero - point phonon energy can be estimated to be the frequency of the highest - energy optical phonon , 670 @xmath4 .",
    "these estimates give @xmath79 , the same order of magnitude that we estimated from @xmath66 .",
    "note that the mott formula contains an exponent which is very sensitive to both value of @xmath68 and @xmath80 , therefore the fact that we have got the right order of magnitude for the effective mass is consistent with the idea of a polaron mechanism of conductivity in magnetite .",
    "we have presented results for infrared and raman measurements of magnetite .",
    "both raman and infrared spectroscopic techniques observed phonon anomalies at @xmath3 which are attributed to the symmetry and structural changes below @xmath3 .",
    "we are able to rule out a structure lacking inversion symmetry .",
    "our optical data seem to fit to the following description . at the temperatures below @xmath3 carriers are localized polarons and we have a strong polaron peak at @xmath56 5000 @xmath4 and a gaplike decrease of optical conductivity below 1000  @xmath4 .",
    "all polarons are bound and position of the polaron peak occurs at twice the binding energy .    at temperatures above the transition",
    ", some carriers are delocalized , leading to removal of oscillator strength from the 5000  @xmath4 peak , broadening , and an increase of the low - frequency conductivity .",
    "it is difficult to separate effects of the filling of the charge gap or the activated increase of mobility .",
    "however , no matter what is causing it , the low frequency optical conductivity follows the dc conductivity .",
    "the increase of the 5000  @xmath4 band oscillator strength with decrease of the temperature is consistent with the polaronic origin of this band , consistent with the previous observations of park et al.@xcite the effective mass of the carriers estimated from the optical conductivity gives a value of @xmath81 , close to that predicted by mott in the framework of the polaron model of the verwey transition .",
    "all these observations strongly indicate the importance of lattice dynamics effects , favoring the polaronic picture of the verwey transition .",
