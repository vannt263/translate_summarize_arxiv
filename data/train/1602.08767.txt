    "recent observations have revealed the existence of supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) with masses @xmath7 at redshifts higher than 6 @xcite . however , the formation history of these smbhs is not still revealed .",
    "there are two major competitive scenarios for the growth of smbhs : one is the mass accretion , and the other is the merger of bhs ( or stars ) @xcite . as for the mass accretion , the constraints from observed smbhs at high redshifts have been argued .",

    "the maximum rate of the super - eddington accretion is thought to be given by hoyle - lyttleton accretion @xcite .",
    "however , it is not elucidated how high accretion rate is realized in an early universe .    on the other hand , according to the hierarchical merger history of galaxy formation , galaxies with multiple mbhs are likely to form , if the number of bhs is conserved during the galaxy merger .",
    "however , most of galaxies harbor just one smbh in their centres , with several exceptions like a triple agn in the galaxy sdss j1027 + 1749 at @xmath15 @xcite , three rapidly growing mbhs of @xmath16 in a clumpy galaxy at @xmath17 @xcite , a quasar triplet qqqj14320106 at @xmath18 @xcite , and a second quasar triplet qqqj1519 + 0627 at @xmath19 @xcite .",

    "the accretion timescale is longer than the df timescale , since the accretion timescale depends on the sound velocity and also on the accretion efficiency @xmath122 .",

    "we find that in several sets of parameters , the masses in a binary match those in gw150914 within their uncertainties .",
