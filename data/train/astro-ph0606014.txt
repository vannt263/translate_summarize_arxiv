    "there is recently growing attention on radio detection of high energy cosmic rays  @xcite .",
    "high energy cosmic rays can initiate an electromagnetic cascade in a medium where relativistic electrons and positrons can be produced in a volume with a longitudinal ( along the line of sight ) dimension being smaller than the relevant radio wavelength .",
    "so , particles form a coherent bunch , acting like a single charged particle that emits a short burst of coherent radio emission .",
    "two radiation processes have been considered : coherent cerenkov radiation @xcite and coherent synchrotron radiation  @xcite .",
    "( coherent radio emission from air showers was first considered by @xcite , also @xcite , but their theory was not explicitly based on geosynchrotron emission . ) the former requires charge asymmetry , say an excess of electrons , and a relatively dense medium for coherent cerenkov emission to be at radio frequency .",
    "for example , the moon is a good target for high energy neutrinos that can lead to a cascade in the lunar rocks .",
    "excess electrons can develop leading to coherent cerenkov emission at radio frequency with wavelength comparable with or larger than the longitudinal size of the cascade  @xcite . for air showers ,",
    "coherent synchrotron emission is generally considered more important than cerenkov radiation ( in the radio band )  @xcite .",
    "the shower produces a bunch of relativistic electrons and positrons emitting coherent synchrotron radiation in geomagnetic fields . unlike coherent cerenkov radiation",
    ", coherent synchrotron emission does not need charge asymmetry  @xcite .",
    "so far , the relevant spectra of coherent synchrotron emission from air showers were commonly calculated using numerical simulation based on the retarded - potential method @xcite . in this method",
    ", the radiation is calculated from the retarded potential  @xcite . although coherent synchrotron emission has been considered analytically @xcite , their calculation is based on the standard synchrotron radiation formula , which does not include the effect due to the particle s finite track . for air showers , effective coherent",
    "emission occurs in the core of the shower where most of radiating particles are created .",
    "thus , it is of interest to consider radiation by a particle moving along a semi - infinite trajectory .",
    "apart from the usual synchrotron emission there is emission due to the onset of the particle s curved trajectory .",
    "the latter component is referred to as the modified impulsive bremsstrahlung ( mib ) as it is due to the combined effect of the usual impulsive ( or prompt ) bremsstrahlung due to particle ( @xmath0 ) creation , which is modeled as an abrupt jump in the particle s velocity from zero to @xmath1 , and curvature of the particle s trajectory .",
    "it is worth noting that the finite track effect was considered for cerenkov radiation  @xcite and was taken into account explicitly in calculation of cosmic - ray induced showers in a dense medium  @xcite . in the case of cerenkov radiation",
    ", the finite track leads to a reduction in radiation intensity and modification of angular distribution of the emission .",
    "since the main objective of studying radio emission from air showers is to infer the properties of the cosmic rays that induce the showers , one needs to determine the radio spectrum accurately . in this paper",
    ", we present a general formalism for coherent synchrotron radiation from a nonstationary many - particle system , which takes account of mib . the formalism developed here",
    "is based on the single particle treatment  @xcite , in which radiation is due to a current associated with particle s motion in a medium . here ,",
    "the current is regarded as extraneous as it is different from that due to the plasma response to waves .",
    "the spectrum of radiation from a many - particle system is derived from the total current that is obtained by adding all the currents due to individual particles . in the relativistic limit as in the usual synchrotron radiation",
    ", the spectrum can be expressed in terms of the airy functions and as a result , the radiation is highly beamed .    in sec.2",

    "coherent synchrotron emission is considered in sec .",
    "3 and the application to air showers is discussed in sec .",
    "in cosmic ray air showers , electrons and positrons are created with a relativistic velocity , emitting synchrotron radiation in the geomagnetic field .",
    "effective coherent emission by these secondary particles occurs at the core of the shower located very close to where most particles are produced .",
    "thus , the finite track effect , in particular the initial position of the particle s orbit , can be important and needs to be included explicitly in the calculation of the synchrotron spectral power . in the following , we start with the single particle formalism .",

    "effective coherent synchrotron emission by secondary particles in an air shower occurs in the core of the shower where most emitting particles are created , the initial point of the particle s trajectory need be included explicitly .",
    "it is shown that radiation from a particle moving along a semi - infinite track can be separated into the usual synchrotron emission and the bremsstrahlung - like emission ( mib ) .",
    "the latter is due to emission as the result of onset of the particle s curved trajectory .",
    "the spectral intensity of the modified synchrotron emission ( usual synchrotron plus mib ) is lower than that for normal synchrotron emission , roughly by a factor of 4 .",
    "it is interesting to note that such reduction is consistent with the recent result from numerical simulation by  @xcite .",
    "the radiation pattern has a broader angular distribution than the usual synchrotron emission .",
    "this feature is especially pronounced for the perpendicularly polarized component .",
    "the spectrum has a much slower decay above the critical frequency @xmath209 , while the usual synchrotron spectrum has an exponential cutoff above the critical frequency . in the application to radio emission from air showers ,",
    "the reduced intensity can be verified in principle provided accurate observations of the radio spectrum are available .",
    "although there exist early observations of air shower radio emission , there are some uncertainties in determining the calibration factor @xcite .",
    "the current lofar prototype station ( lopes ) and the future lofar may provide a better opportunity to test the predicted spectrum .",
    "since the transition frequency ( to spontaneous emission ) is much lower than the cut - off frequency , change near the cut - off frequency may not be observable .",
    "the broadening of the radiation pattern occurs mainly for the perpendicularly polarized component , which may be observable provided that there is significant charge asymmetry in the emitting plasma .",
    "a major advantage of the formalism presented here is that the initial conditions including the time of particle creation , initial velocity and gyrophase all appear in the phase ( [ eq : psi2 ] ) and these quantities can be modeled statistically . although the single - particle formalism was used by  @xcite to treat coherent gyromagnetic emission , in their calculation , the finite track effect was not considered .",
    "it is shown here that the distribution of the particle injection time is important in determining the coherence .",
    "the semi - infinite track approximation adopted here is valid provided that the emitting particles are highly relativistic with @xmath39 . in the relativistic limit , the synchrotron pulse duration ( @xmath210 ) is much shorter than the typical flight time @xmath211 for a particle s free path 500 m , and therefore the orbit can be approximately regarded as semi - infinite . if electrons and positrons from an air shower have an energy cutoff extending to mev energies with @xmath212 , the synchrotron approximation is no longer valid and one has cyclotron emission instead . in this case",
    ", a finite orbit needs to be considered .",
    "one may extend the calculation in sec . 3 and 4 to include the particle distribution in momentum and this requires a numerical approach , which is not considered here .",
