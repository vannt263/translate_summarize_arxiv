    "during the last decades , investigation of strong magnetic dipole ( @xmath0 ) transitions in medium - mass nuclei was of a keen interest @xcite .",
    "first of all , this was caused by a diversity of various physical effects related to these excitations : quenching of spin strength and impact of non - nucleonic degrees of freedom , relation to gamow - teller transitions and relevant astrophysical problems , isospin degrees of freedom of valence - shell excitations , peculiarities of the orbital scissors - like mode , cross - shell and l - forbidden transitions , impact of complex configurations , etc .",
    "furthermore , these nuclei are accessible to modern large - scale shell model calculations @xcite that have the capability to describe the effects mentioned above . theoretical efforts and advanced experiments have finally led to a significant progress in understanding the features of @xmath0 excitations in this mass region @xcite .",
    "open - shell @xmath4-shell nuclei are particularly important in this activity @xcite .",
    "description of these nuclei is rather complicated because here deformation and pairing effects come to play . at the same time",
    ", these effects make the physics of @xmath4-shell nuclei much richer . in particular , deformation results in appearance of the low - energy orbital scissors - like @xmath0 mode ( @xmath5 ) @xcite .",
    "so far the experimental data on the @xmath0 @xmath5 strength in the @xmath4-region were limited to a few axially deformed nuclei : @xmath6ti ( z=22)@xcite and @xmath7fe ( z=26 ) @xcite .",
    "it was found that the @xmath5 in these nuclei is mainly represented by one low - energy ( in the region 3.4 - 4.4 mev ) state with @xmath8 . as expected @xcite",
    ", this state is characterized by a strong @xmath0 transition to the ground state .",
    "the theoretical analysis  @xcite indicates that the @xmath5 in this mass region is of a mixed ( orbital + spin ) character , although with a dominant orbital contribution .",
    "shell - model calculations @xcite demonstrate a considerable dependence of the description on a subtle balance of different effects such as equilibrium deformation , pairing , interaction parameters , etc .    for a better understanding of the @xmath5 features in @xmath4-shell nuclei , we certainly need experimental data for deformed cr ( z=24 ) isotopes placed between the ti and fe chains .",
    "@xmath9 states of @xmath1cr are known from previous ( @xmath10,@xmath11 ) experiments  @xcite and for three of them @xmath2-ray transitions have been measured in nuclear resonance fluorescence ( nrf )  @xcite .",
    "@xmath12 values are known only for two @xmath3 states of @xmath1cr .",
    "a comprehensive @xmath0 strength distribution is missing .",
    "it is the purpose of the present study to provide data for a more comprehensive @xmath0 strength distribution for the deformed nucleus @xmath1cr .",
    "this nucleus was studied in photon scattering experiments using nrf  @xcite .",
    "the experiment was performed at the superconducting darmstadt electron linear accelerator s - dalinac  @xcite using unpolarized bremsstrahlung with a continuous spectral distribution from the darmstadt high intensity photon setup ( dhips )  @xcite .",
    "parity quantum numbers of spin-1 states were determined using the high intensity @xmath2-ray source  @xcite operated by the triangle universities nuclear laboratory and the duke free electron laser laboratory ( dfell ) at duke university in durham , nc , usa .    in the present experiment , the spectrum of @xmath1cr up to 9.7 mev and the corresponding m1 strength were determined .",
    "the m1 strength for the lowest @xmath8-state with excitation energy of 3628.2 kev was obtained and the @xmath12 values for 12 strongly excited @xmath13 states were measured for the first time .",
    "two theoretical models were used for further interpretation : skyrme quasiparticle random - phase - approximation ( qrpa )  @xcite and large - scale shell model ( lssm )  @xcite .",
    "the self - consistent qrpa and lssm rather well reproduce the experimental axial quadrupole deformation @xmath14=0.2897(44 ) @xcite of @xmath1cr and provided qualitatively close results .",
    "the calculations agree upon the feature that the 3628.2-kev state has predominantely orbital character with a minor spin admixture .",
    "this means that the present experiment provides observation of the @xmath5 in cr isotopes .",
    "the new data essentially supplement the @xmath5 systematics in @xmath4-shell nuclei and , as shown below , lead to a better understanding of @xmath5 features in this mass region . besides our analysis of the orbital flow implies a closer correspondence to the schematic view of lipparini and stringari  @xcite corresponding to isovector rotation - like oscillations of the nucleons inside the rigid nuclear surface than to the scissors - like picture of lo iudice and palumbo @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , the experimental method and data analysis are outlined . in sec .",
    "iii , the theoretical analysis of the results is given .",
    "iv provides a summary .",
    "in nrf measurements , the excitation mechanism is purely electromagnetic .",
    "therefore , intrinsic properties like spin , parity , and transition probabilities can be determined from the measured quantities ( angular distribution , polarization asymmetries , @xmath2-ray energy , and intensity  @xcite ) in a model - independent way . for details of the nrf method , basic relations between the detected number of events and energy - integrated cross - sections , transition widths as well as @xmath0 transition strengths , we refer the reader to the reviews by metzger  @xcite and kneissl and coworkers  @xcite .",
    "spin quantum numbers , cross - sections @xmath15 ( energy - integrated scattering cross sections for exciting a state @xmath16 and deexciting this state to the ground state 0 ) , ground - state transition widths @xmath17 , and transition strengths @xmath12 were measured at the dhips setup .",
    "a series of nrf experiments was performed at tu darmstadt and at duke university .",
    "the photon - scattering experiment with unpolarized bremsstrahlung from the darmstadt linear electron accelerator s - dalinac  @xcite was performed at the darmstadt high intensity photon setup ( dhips )  @xcite .",
    "two measurements on @xmath1cr were performed with bremsstrahlung at endpoint energies of 7.5(1 )  mev and 9.7(1 )  mev , respectively . the measurement with 7.5(1 )",
    "mev bremsstrahlung has been carried out to identify transitions via intermediate states .",
    "bremsstrahlung has been produced by completely stopping the intense electron beam from the s - dalinac s injector in a thick copper radiator target .",
    "the generated photon beam passes a massive copper collimator resulting in a beam spot with a size of about 2.5 cm diameter at the nrf target position .",
    "target nuclei are excited by the resonant absorption of photons and subsequently decay either directly or via intermediate states to the ground state .",

    "the first measurement was performed with 2.0 g of an isotopically enriched @xmath1cr target ( 96.416% enriched ) using an end - point energy of @xmath21  =  9.7(1 )  mev and average electron beam currents of about 20 @xmath22a . in this measurement data",
    "were taken for about 131 hours . for energy and photon - flux calibrations 399.3 mg of enriched @xmath23b ( 99.52% enriched ) were used that were irradiated simultaneously .",

    "the target was centered between four hpge detectors which were placed in a cross - like geometry at polar angles of @xmath19 with respect to the incident beam , two of them have 100% relative efficiency and the other two have 60% relative efficiency , respectively . in this setup",

    "figure  [ shell ] shows @xmath12 values obtained for the total ( orbital + spin ) , orbital , and spin @xmath0 transitions . in the spin part , a quenching factor of 0.75  @xcite",
    "the calculations give the state at 3.5  mev with a sizeable strength @xmath44 .",
    "the orbital strength dominates the 3.5  mev state , which indicates the scissors - like character of the state .",
    "it should be pointed out that in the lssm the 3.5-mev state is not purely orbital but also has some spin admixture , which appears in the qrpa calculations .",
    "the calculated 3.5-mev state matches remarkably well with the experimentally observed state at 3628.2 kev .",
    "the lssm calculations show that @xmath0 transitions above 3.6 mev are mainly of spin character ( see lower panel of figure  [ shell ] ) .",
    "the calculated summed @xmath0 strength in the experimentally investigated energy range from 2 - 9.7 mev amounts to @xmath455.6 @xmath46 as compared to the measured value of 4.1(1 ) @xmath46 .",

    "tab : table3 ] , the lssm results are compared to qrpa ones and present experimental data .",
    "the table shows that the lssm better describes the level energy than the skyrme qrpa .",
    "most probably this is because the lssm takes into account the coupling to complex configurations , omitted in the qrpa .",
    "the low - lying @xmath0-strength in the open - shell nucleus @xmath1cr has been determined with the method of nuclear resonance fluorescence using bremsstrahlung at the superconducting darmstadt linear electron accelerator s - dalinac and compton backscattered photons at the high intensity @xmath2-ray source ( hi@xmath2s ) facility .",

    "the experimental results were compared to calculations in the self - consistent skyrme quasiparticle random - phase - approximation ( qrpa ) @xcite and the large - scale shell model ( lssm ) @xcite .",
    "the qrpa allowed to highlight the basic features and origin of @xmath3 states while the lssm demonstrated the important role of complex configurations .",
    "both models reproduce the similar b(e2 ) values .",
    "following our theoretical analysis and comparison with other available results for @xmath4-shell nuclei the lowest @xmath3-state at 3.6 mev was identified as an isovector orbital mode with some spin admixture . in agreement with previous studies for fp - shell nuclei  @xcite , a constructive interference of the orbital and spin contributions for this state was confirmed .",
    "this augments the previous rare data ( @xmath6ti  @xcite and @xmath7fe  @xcite ) on this orbital mode in the @xmath4-shell region .",
    "the obtained data match the estimations and trends for the scissors - like mode in a satisfactory way .",
    "it is also interesting that distributions of the orbital current , computed within the skyrme qrpa for the lowest @xmath13-state , favor the schematic picture of lipparini and stringari @xcite ( isovector rotation - like oscillations inside the rigid surface ) rather than the scissors - like view of lo iudice and palumbo @xcite .",
    "the spin excitations above the scissors - like mode were also inspected .",
    "the qrpa calculation confirms that the spin @xmath0 resonance in @xmath1cr is provided by spin - flip transitions ( mainly @xmath47 ) inside the @xmath4-shell .",
