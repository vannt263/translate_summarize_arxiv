    "in some phenomenological models that describe condensed matter systems there exists the vicinity of the finite temperature phase transition that is called fluctuational region . in this region the fluctuations of the order parameter become strong .",
    "the contribution of these fluctuations to certain physical observables becomes larger than the tree level estimate .",
    "thus the perturbation theory in these models fails down within the fluctuational region .",
    "our main supposition is that the lattice weinberg - salam model ( at @xmath7 ) looks similar to the mentioned models .",
    "namely , we expect that there exists the vicinity of the phase transition between the higgs phase and the symmetric phase in the weinberg - salam model , where the fluctuations of the scalar field become strong and the perturbation expansion around trivial vacuum can not be applied . according to the numerical results the continuum theory is to be approached within the vicinity of the phase transition , i.e. the cutoff is increased along the line of constant physics when one approaches the point of the transition .",
    "that s why we expect that the conventional prediction on the value of the cutoff admitted in the standard model based on the perturbation theory may be incorrect .",
    "according to the conventional point of view the upper bound @xmath8 on the cutoff in the electroweak theory ( without fermions ) depends on the higgs mass .",
    "it is decreased when the higgs mass is increased .",
    "and at the higgs mass around @xmath9 tev @xmath8 becomes of the order of @xmath10 .",
    "at the same time for @xmath11 gev the value of @xmath8 can be made almost infinite .",
    "this conclusion is made basing on the perturbation expansion around trivial vacuum .    in the present paper",
    "we report the results of the numerical investigation of the model at the value of the scalar self coupling @xmath12 , the bare weinberg angle @xmath13 , and the renormalized fine structure constant around @xmath14 .",
    "the bare value of the higgs boson mass is around @xmath15 gev in the vicinity of the phase transition .",
    "we calculate the constraint effective potential @xmath16 for the higgs field @xmath17 . in the physical higgs phase",
    "this potential has a minimum at a certain nonzero value @xmath18 of @xmath19 .",
    "this shows that the spontaneous breakdown of the electroweak symmetry takes place as it should .",
    "however , there exists the vicinity of the phase transition , where the fluctuations of the higgs field are of the order of @xmath18 while the hight of the `` potential barrier '' quantum mechanics with the similar potential there are two separated minima with the potential barrier between them . nevertheless we feel it appropriate to use the chosen terminology as the value of the `` potential barrier hight '' measures the difference between the potentials with and without spontaneous symmetry breaking . ]",
    "@xmath20 is of the order of @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the fluctuation of @xmath19 .",
    "we expect that in this region the perturbation expansion around trivial vacuum @xmath23 can not be applied .",
    "we call this region of the phase diagram the fluctuational region ( fr ) in analogy to the condensed matter systems .",
    "the mentioned supposition is confirmed by the investigation of the topological defects composed of the lattice gauge fields that are to be identified with quantum nambu monopoles @xcite .",
    "we show that their lattice density increases when the phase transition point is approached . within the fr these objects are so dense that it is not possible at all to speak of them as of single monopoles . moving along the line of constant physics",
    "we reach the point on the phase diagram where the monopole worldlines begin to percolate .",
    "this point was found to coincide roughly with the position of the transition between the physical higgs phase and the unphysical symmetric phase of the lattice model .",
    "this transition is a crossover and the ultraviolet cutoff achieves its maximal value around @xmath24 tev at the transition point . ]",
    "namely , within this region the average distance between the nambu monopoles is of the order of their size .",
    "such complicated configurations obviously have nothing to do with the conventional vacuum used of the continuum perturbation theory .",
    "we have estimated the maximal value of the cutoff in the vicinity of the transition point .",
    "the obtained value of the cutoff appears to be around @xmath24 tev .",
    "the lattice weinberg - salam model without fermions contains gauge field @xmath25 ( where @xmath26 are realized as link variables ) , and the scalar doublet @xmath27 defined on sites .",

    "bare fine structure constant @xmath37 is expressed through @xmath38 and @xmath36 as @xmath39 . in our investigation",
    "we fix bare weinberg angle equal to @xmath40 .",
    "the renormalized fine structure constant can be extracted through the potential for the infinitely heavy external charged particles .",
    "all simulations were performed on lattices of sizes @xmath41 and @xmath3 .",
    "several points were checked using the larger lattice ( @xmath4 ) .    in order to simulate the system we used metropolis algorithm .",
    "the acceptance rate is kept around @xmath42 via the automatical self - tuning of the suggested distribution of the fields . at each step of the suggestion the random value",
    "is added to the old value of the scalar field while the old value of gauge field is multiplied by random @xmath43 matrix .",
    "we use gaussian distribution both for the random value added to the scalar field and the parameters of the random matrix multiplied by the lattice gauge field .",
    "we use two independent parameters for these distributions : one for the gauge fields and another for the scalar field .",
    "the program code has been tested for the case of frozen scalar field . and the results of the papers @xcite are repeated .",

    "in the three - dimensional ( @xmath50 ) phase diagram the transition surfaces are two - dimensional . the lines of constant physics on the tree level are the lines ( @xmath51 ; @xmath52 ) .",
    "we suppose that in the vicinity of the transition the deviation of the lines of constant physics from the tree level estimate may be significant . however , qualitatively their behavior is the same .",
    "namely , the cutoff is increased along the line of constant physics when @xmath53 is decreased and the maximal value of the cutoff is achieved at the transition point .",
    "nambu monopole density in lattice units is also increased when the ultraviolet cutoff is increased .    at @xmath54 the phase diagram is represented on figure [ fig.2 ] . the physical higgs phase is situated right to the transition line .",

    "we observe no difference between the values of the susceptibility calculated using the lattices of the sizes @xmath41 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 .",
    "this indicates that the transition may be a crossover .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the value of the renormalized higgs boson mass does not deviate significantly from its bare value .",
    "namely , for @xmath32 around @xmath59 and @xmath53 in the vicinity of the phase transition bare value of the higgs mass is around @xmath15 gev while the observed renormalized value is @xmath60 gev ( see the next section for the details ) .",
    "in order to evaluate the masses of the @xmath55-boson and the higgs boson we use the correlators : @xmath61 and @xmath62 here the summation @xmath63 is over the three  space \" components of the four - vectors @xmath64 and @xmath65 while @xmath66 denote their  time `` components .",

    "<S> the lattice weinberg - salam model without fermions is investigated numerically for the realistic choice of bare coupling constants correspondent to the value of the weinberg angle @xmath0 , and the fine structure constant @xmath1 . on the phase diagram there </S>",

    "<S> the classical nambu monopole can be considered as an embryo of the unphysical symmetric phase within the physical phase . in the fluctuational region </S>",
    "<S> quantum nambu monopoles are dense and , therefore , the perturbation expansion around trivial vacuum can not be applied . the maximal value of the cutoff at the given values of coupling constants calculated using the lattices of sizes @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 is @xmath5 tev . </S>",
