    "many renormalization schemes are carried out in momentum space and involve integrating out degrees of freedom using a momentum cutoff .",
    "for example , wilson s numerical renormalization group ( rg )  @xcite implements this program using a mapping of momentum shells to an effective lattice model .",
    "the renormalization process is carried out by successive numerical diagonalization of a finite system and energetic truncation of the hilbert space .",
    "while this lattice model corresponds to successive momenta or , equivalently , energy scales , its form is similar to that of a strongly correlated lattice model .",
    "attempts at applying a real  space version of the wilson procedure to short  range quantum lattice models such as the heisenberg or the hubbard model were not successful , however , because successive lattice points do not correspond to different energy scales .",
    "the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg )  @xcite overcomes these limitations by carrying out the renormalization on a subsystem . the truncated basis is formed by projecting the state of the entire system onto the subsystem using the reduced density matrix rather than selecting states energetically .",
    "this method has been very successful at treating low  dimensional quantum lattice models with open boundary conditions and short  range couplings .",
    "however , for longer  range off  diagonal interactions , higher dimensional systems or lattices with periodic boundary conditions , this real  space formulation of the dmrg is much less successful .",
    "in addition , it loses sight of an energy or momentum  based classification of the relevant degrees of freedom .    a potential way of overcoming this limitation for itinerant electron systems is to apply the dmrg ideas to the momentum ",
    "space formulation of the hamiltonian .",
    "this approach has a number of potential advantages over the real  space approach .",
    "first , since the single  particle basis in momentum space is explicitly translationally invariant , momentum is a conserved quantum number .",
    "use of this momentum quantum number reduces the size of the hilbert space in the diagonalization .",
    "second , momentum  dependent quantities such as the momentum distribution or the dispersion of excitations can be directly calculated .",
    "third , the kinetic energy term is diagonal so that varying the dispersion by , for example , changing the range of the hopping , is easy to do .",
    "attempts to formulate a numerical renormalization group procedure for quantum lattice systems in momentum space  @xcite predating the dmrg were not particularly successful  ",
    "this was one of white s motivations for turning to real space and formulating the dmrg . shortly after the development of the dmrg in real  space , white attempted to use dmrg methods on the momentum",
    " space formulation of the hubbard model .",
    "he calculated the ground ",
    "state energy in one and two dimensions at intermediate couplings , but found that the energies obtained were not significantly better than those obtained by other variational methods .",
    "@xcite    independently , xiang developed a similar technique and applied it to the hubbard model in one and two dimensions .",
    "@xcite in this work , xiang outlined an efficient implementation of the dmrg in momentum space .",
    "he developed a factorization of the hubbard interaction that reduces the number of term from @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the number of single ",
    "particle bloch wavefunctions in the lattice , to @xmath3 .",
    "he also pointed out some features of the algorithm that need to be carefully considered in momentum space : since the interaction is highly non  local , there is no natural ordering of the single  particle states ; the choice of the ordering can , however , have an effect on the performance of the dmrg algorithm . in addition",
    ", there is no well  defined infinite  system algorithm , so that care must be taken in how the lattice is built up initially .",
    "care must also be taken in this initialization procedure so that states with a sufficient spread in momentum quantum numbers are kept .",
    "one possible outcome of an inadequate initialization procedure is convergence to a state other than the true ground state .",
    "xiang investigated the performance of the algorithm for various interaction strengths for the one  dimensional hubbard model with 16 sites at half filling , and for the two  dimensional model on system sizes ranging from @xmath4 to @xmath5 for various band fillings .",
    "he found that the convergence of the method depends strongly on the interaction strength , @xmath6 .",
    "the method is exact for @xmath7 since the hamiltonian is diagonal and the convergence becomes rapidly worse with increasing @xmath6 . in one dimension , he compared with real  space dmrg calculations and found that the error in the ground  state energy was higher than the real  space calculation for both weak and intermediate interaction strengths ( @xmath8 and 4 , with @xmath9 the hopping matrix element ) , with 5% error for @xmath10 . in two dimensions ,",
    "he compared with exact diagonalization for a @xmath4 system , cluster diagonalization on a @xmath11 system , and quantum monte carlo and stochastic diagonalization calculations on @xmath4 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 systems .",
    "the relative errors increased rapidly with @xmath6 for the @xmath4 system .",
    "the variational energies were comparable to those of the stochastic diagonalization and quantum monte carlo methods ( for which the energy is non  variational ) for larger system sizes .",
    "the variational bounds for the energy were slightly higher than stochastic diagonalization for the @xmath11 lattice and slightly lower for the @xmath12 lattice . in comparing the performance in one and two dimensions ,",
    "xiang pointed out that the accuracy for given number of states kept , @xmath13 , and band filling for 16 site systems was better in two dimensions than in one , leading him to speculate that the momentum ",
    "space method becomes more accurate as the dimensionality is increased .",
    "our purpose in this work is to explore more fully both the convergence properties and the application of the momentum ",
    "space formulation of the dmrg to the hubbard model . in one dimension ,",
    "we take advantage of the existence of exact solutions for two choices of the dispersion , corresponding to nearest ",
    "neighbor hopping and @xmath0 hopping , to systematically investigate the dependence of the convergence of the ground  state energy on interaction strength , band filling , and number of density - matrix eigenstates kept , @xmath14 .",
    "we investigate the regularity of the convergence with @xmath14 and discuss schemes to extrapolate in @xmath14 in order to obtain more accurate energies .",
    "we reexamine the relative convergence for the one and two  dimensional models with a view to understanding the utility of the momentum ",
    "space dmrg for higher  dimensional systems .",
    "while the ground  state energy is useful for determining variational convergence , it does not directly provide much useful information about the physical behavior of the system .",
    "we therefore investigate some physically useful quantities , the quasiparticle gap , the momentum distribution and the dispersion of spinon excitations , for the one  dimensional models and compare to exactly known results and perturbative approximations , where appropriate .",
    "our calculations of the momentum distribution and the spinon dispersion for the @xmath0hopping model are , to our knowledge , the first independent numerical calculations of these quantities .",

    "( iii )  the two  dimensional hubbard square lattice with nearest ",

    "the dispersion relation is given by @xmath50 with @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "the bandwidth is  @xmath54 .",
    "the one  dimensional hubbard model  ( i ) is exactly solvable via the bethe ansatz  @xcite and can easily be studied using the real  space dmrg .",
    "@xcite comparison with the exact solutions and the real  space method will provide an opportunity to test the performance of the momentum  space dmrg .",
    "the @xmath0hubbard model  ( ii ) is also exactly solvable ,  @xcite but it is difficult to investigate with the real  space dmrg because the hopping is long  range and imaginary . for this model , the advantage of the momentum ",
    "space approach is clear : one need only change the real , diagonal dispersion @xmath55 .",
    "we will therefore use this model to investigate how a substantial change in the range of hopping affects the momentum ",
    "space algorithm . the hubbard model on a two  dimensional square lattice ( iii ) will be used to investigate and compare the effects of dimensionality on the momentum  space method and on the real  space method .",
    "in principle , the usual dmrg  @xcite can be applied directly to the momentum  space representation of the hubbard model ( [ eq : ham_k ] ) . in the momentum ",
    "space approach each bloch function with momentum @xmath56 and spin @xmath18 corresponds to a lattice site . to perform the calculations presented in this paper , we have adapted a program originally written by white.@xcite",
    "this program predates ( and thus does not use ) some recent developments which can greatly improve the performance of the dmrg such as the wavefunction transformation  @xcite , the use of composite operators ,  @xcite and of non  abelian symmetries .",
    "@xcite nevertheless , this program is highly optimized and allows us to carry out dmrg calculations keeping up to @xmath57 density  matrix eigenstates on a workstation with 1 gb of memory .",
    "below and in the next section we discuss features of the momentum space dmrg which differ from the usual real space dmrg .",
    "the summation in the second term of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ham_k ] ) runs over @xmath1 products of operators .",
    "a straightforward implementation of the dmrg algorithm requires calculating and keeping track of @xmath58 matrices representing the different products of operators .",
    "this represents a significant increase compared to the real space - approach which requires only a constant number of operators for the one  dimensional and order @xmath59 matrices for the two  dimensional hubbard model  ( [ eq : ham_r ] ) , respectively .",
    "xiang  @xcite has shown that is it possible to define so  called composite operators and thus reduce the number of operators which need to be kept to @xmath3 . in white s program , internal sums over blocks are carried out to reduce the number of operators to @xmath60 rather than @xmath61 , and an efficient representation of operators with small sparse matrices is used .",
    "we explicitly use the conservation of the particle number @xmath62 , of the @xmath63-component of the total spin @xmath64 , and of the total momentum @xmath65 momentum symmetry reduces the size of the effective hilbert space by about a factor @xmath2 and allows us to decompose the matrix representations of operators into several smaller matrices .",
    "therefore , the dimension of the effective hilbert space for a given number @xmath14 of density matrix eigenstates is smaller in the momentum  space approach than in the real space approach .",
    "this should be kept in mind when comparing results obtained with both approaches : in general , @xmath14  can be made larger for a given amount of computational effort in momentum space .    in a one  dimensional system in real space , there is a natural ordering of the lattice sites . in two dimensions ,",
    "there is some choice in the ordering ,  @xcite but reasonable choices yield similar results .",
    "@xcite in momentum space it is not a priori clear how one should arrange the sites in the lattice.@xcite thus , we have tested several possibilities including random ordering .",
    "we have found that the order of sites should be carefully chosen in the momentum  space approach ",
    "the rate of convergence and the accuracy strongly depends on the site order .",
    "fundamentally , it seems that bloch states which are strongly scattered by the hubbard term in ( [ eq : ham_k ] ) should be arranged to be as close together as possible .",
    "for the one  dimensional and two  dimensional hubbard models with nearest ",
    "neighbor hopping we use an energetic ordering in which the sites are arranged according to @xmath66 , where @xmath67 denotes the fermi energy in the non  interacting case ( @xmath7 ) . for the @xmath0hubbard model",
    ", the fermi energy has no particular relevance for low  energy scattering processes and we have found that ordering the sites according to @xmath68 works best .",
    "we use the finite  system dmrg algorithm and perform several sweeps through the lattice until the ground ",
    "state energy converges as in the real  space approach .",
    "wilson s numerical rg method is used instead of the infinite system algorithm to build up the lattice during the initial iteration .",
    "for the next iterations we apply the usual blocking scheme with a superblock made of two sites and two blocks with at most @xmath14 states each . in ref .",
    "the superblock was built using two blocks and a single site . according to xiang , this single ",
    "site approach is faster than the usual blocking scheme . as discussed in ref .",
    ", however , the single  site blocking scheme is not a robust method unless several states are targeted .",
    "as we always target a single state in our calculations [ the ground state for some quantum numbers @xmath69 , we use the two  site blocking scheme .",
    "we have observed that the dmrg has difficulty finding the ground state when the interaction @xmath6 is not weak or for some particular choices of the quantum number @xmath70 .",
    "the dmrg sometimes seems to converge first to a state other than the ground state and only converges to the true ground state after many sweeps or after the number @xmath14 of density  matrix eigenstates is increased .",
    "this behavior is marked by a rapid drop in the energy after a relatively large number of sweeps or at a high value of @xmath14 .",
    "a similar problem has been reported with the real  space dmrg applied to two  dimensional fermion systems .",
    "@xcite therefore , one should not rely on dmrg results obtained for a fixed number @xmath14 of density  matrix eigenstates kept or a fixed number of sweeps , but one should investigate the behavior of the dmrg as a function of @xmath14 and of the number of sweeps .",
    "in this section we discuss the convergence and accuracy of the momentum ",
    "space dmrg method applied to the hubbard model  ( [ eq : ham_k ] ) .",
    "we have also applied the real  space dmrg method to the real  space representation  ( [ eq : ham_r ] ) of the hubbard hamiltonian with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "this allows us to make comparisons of both dmrg methods in order to illustrate both their differences and their common features .",
    "space dmrg program uses more advanced techniques and is better optimized than our momentum",
    " space dmrg program .",
    "therefore , we have chosen to present no comparison of computer cpu time and memory usage in this paper as they would be meaningless .    as a measure of the dmrg precision we use the error in the ground ",

    "the real  space representation becomes exact ( i.e. , local ) when @xmath76 .",
    "it is important to note that this is not equivalent to the large @xmath13 limit , in which the real  space dmrg does _ not _ become exact .",

    "the results are oscillatory and hard to extrapolate .",
    "while the origin of this irregular convergence in xiang s data is unclear , one factor that is essential to consider is that the momentum of the ground state for a half  filled ring with 16 sites and periodic boundary conditions is @xmath78 because it is an open  shell configuration .",
    "our results for @xmath78 do converge smoothly to the exact solution as a function of @xmath81 , as seen in fig .",
    "the lowest  energy state with @xmath79 , also shown in the figure , lies closer to xiang s results for the larger values of @xmath14 , but converges smoothly to an energy that is clearly higher than the ground state .",
    "the deviation of xiang s result could either be due to his ground state having a different momentum or due to convergence of the the dmrg to a state other than the ground state , as discussed in the previous section .    for weaker interaction , @xmath8 , xiang s results",
    "converge to the ground  state energy for @xmath78 , but lie significantly above our own results for the same number of density  matrix eigenstates kept .",
    "for instance , the dmrg error in the ground  state energy @xmath77 for @xmath82 is one order of magnitude smaller in our calculations than the value reported by xiang .",
    "this also suggests an incomplete convergence of dmrg in xiang s calculations even for weak coupling .",
    "however , it should also be kept in mind that in his work xiang used a different superblock structure with a single site between two blocks . as a consequence ,",
    "the dimension of the effective hilbert space for a given number of states @xmath14 is smaller in xiang s calculations than in our calculations .",
    "this difference could be responsible for the better accuracy of our results in the weak coupling limit ( @xmath8 ) but can not explain the discrepancy observed for intermediate coupling ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "in our calculations we have often observed that the dmrg energy initially seems to converge towards a value larger than the exact ground  state energy . upon further increasing the number of states @xmath14 or the number of sweeps",
    ", it then converges to the exact result . in all the cases we present here , the momentum ",
    "space dmrg yields energies that _ do _ ultimately converge to the exact result , even for very large interaction strength @xmath6 , although the rate of this convergence and the accuracy deteriorate rapidly as @xmath6 increases .      in this section ,",
    "we discuss the dependence of the accuracy of the energy of momentum ",
    "space dmrg on the model parameters : the single  electron dispersion @xmath83 , the interaction strength @xmath84 , the lattice dimensionality , and the band filling .",
    "figures  [ fig3](a ) and ( b ) show the ground ",
    "state energy error @xmath75 as a function of the interaction strength @xmath84 for a fixed number @xmath85 of density  matrix eigenstates .",
    "we again see that errors decrease in the real  space approach [ fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) ] but increase in the momentum  space approach [ fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) ] for increasing @xmath84 . in both cases errors",
    "increase with the system size and are larger in two dimensions than in one dimension for the same number of lattice sites . however , the dependence on system size and dimensionality of the momentum  space approach is clearly weaker than in the real  space approach .",
    "the lower precision of the dmrg in higher dimension is easily understood as a consequence of increasing off  diagonal coupling in the real  space approach .",
    "a possible explanation for the slight decrease in accuracy with dimension in the momentum  space representation is that although the single  electron dispersion @xmath83 remains diagonal for any dimension , a larger proportion of single ",
    "electron states are close to the fermi surface and are thus strongly scattered . in figs .",
    "[ fig3](a ) and ( b ) one also sees that the precision of the real  space approach is generally better than that of the momentum ",
    "space approach in the one  dimensional hubbard model .",
    "the latter becomes more accurate than the former for @xmath86 only . in two dimension",
    ", however , the real  space approach performs very poorly for periodic boundary conditions . the momentum ",
    "space approach yields better results for @xmath87 .",
    "we finally note that dmrg errors seem to be affected only a small amount by the form of the dispersion @xmath83 in the momentum  space approach . in the real  space approach , however , changing the single  electron dispersion by introducing longer ",
    "range hopping lowers the dmrg performance very rapidly . in summary , we find that the momentum  space approach is superior to the real  space approach for applications to translationally invariant systems with weak to intermediate coulomb interactions in two dimensions or on one  dimensional lattices with long  range hopping .",
    "let us now consider the effects of the band filling . in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we show the error @xmath75 in the ground ",
    "state energy as a function of band filling @xmath88 for the one  dimensional hubbard model at @xmath89 . in the momentum ",
    "space approach , the accuracy is worst at or near half filling and improves as the density decreases from @xmath90 .",
    "one cause of this effect is that the size of the hilbert space is maximal at half filling and decreases rapidly at large doping .",
    "this effect is magnified in the 16site system relative to the 32site system , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , because a substantial proportion of the hilbert space is retained in the diagonalization step at large doping .",
    "another possible cause is the reduction in the effective strength of the electron  electron scattering as the system is doped away from half filling .",
    "the effective interaction strength depends on the ratio of @xmath6 and the density of states at the fermi energy , which becomes smaller with doping , in weak coupling .",
    "as the effective interaction becomes smaller , the electrons become more localized in momentum space , which should be favorable for the convergence of the momentum  space dmrg . in the real  space approach , fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] shows that the error in the ground ",
    "state energy first increases as the system is doped slightly away from half filling , then decreases upon further doping .",
    "as discussed previously , the charge degrees of freedom are localized in the half  filled insulator , leading to improved convergence for the real  space algorithm . for any finite doping ,",
    "the system immediately becomes metallic , i.e. , some charge degrees of freedom become delocalized , leading to a reduction in accuracy .",
    "as the system is doped further from half filling the reduction in the size of the hilbert space leads to an improvement in accuracy , as in the momentum  space approach .",
    "in the one  dimensional hubbard model for @xmath91 on lattices with 16 sites ( squares ) and 32 sites ( circles ) .",
    "open symbols represent the momentum  space dmrg results and filled symbols for the real  space dmrg results .",
    "space dmrg errors for 16 sites are smaller than @xmath92 and not shown . the number of density  matrix states is @xmath82 and @xmath85 for the 16site and 32site system , respectively.,width=302 ]      dmrg calculations have a truncation error which is reduced by increasing the number @xmath14 of density  matrix eigenstates kept .",
    "@xcite it is important to analyze the scaling of dmrg results as a function of @xmath14 to estimate dmrg errors quantitatively . in real ",
    "space dmrg calculations one generally observes that energy errors @xmath77 are proportional to the discarded weight @xmath94 ,  @xcite provided that the dmrg has converged to the right target state . here the discarded weight @xmath94 is defined as the total weight ( sum of the density  matrix eigenvalues ) of the discarded density  matrix eigenstates , averaged over a sweep through all lattice sites in the finite  system dmrg algorithm .",
    "thus , it is possible to extrapolate dmrg eigenenergies to the limit @xmath95 .",
    "this procedure produces extrapolated energies which are closer to the exact eigenenergies than the dmrg energies calculated for a given value of @xmath14 . moreover ,",
    "the extrapolation yields reliable quantitative error margins for the eigenenergies .    in momentum space , however , we have found that the linear relationship between the energy errors @xmath77 and @xmath94 often does not hold , even for small @xmath94 .",
    "in fact , we find that the dependence of @xmath94 on @xmath14 can even be non  monotonic .",
    "an extrapolation to vanishing discarded weight @xmath95 is therefore generally not possible .",
    "that such a non  monotonic behavior is found at all is surprising at first glance because the discarded weight @xmath94 of the _ exact _ density matrix for the system decreases monotonically with increasing @xmath14 per definition .",
    "an exact density matrix for the ground state of the hubbard model can be calculated numerically in small systems using exact diagonalization .",
    "using the results of such a calculation on a @xmath96 lattice , we have found that the density  matrix eigenvalues @xmath97 appear to decrease exponentially as a function of @xmath19 in the asymptotic regime @xmath98 . as a consequence , the exact discarded weight @xmath99 and",

    "<S> in contrast to the real  space algorithm , the accuracy becomes rapidly worse with increasing interaction and is not significantly better at half filling . </S>",
    "<S> we compare the results for different dispersion relations at fixed interaction strength over bandwidth and find that extending the range of the hopping in one dimension has little effect , but that changing the dimensionality from one to two leads to lower accuracy at weak to moderate interaction strength . in the one  dimensional models at half  filling , we also investigate the behavior of the single  particle gap , the dispersion of spinon excitations , and the momentum distribution function . for the single  particle gap , we find that proper extrapolation in the number of states kept is important . </S>",
    "<S> for the spinon dispersion , we find that good agreement with the exact forms can be achieved at weak coupling if the large momentum  dependent finite  size effects are taken into account for nearest  </S>",

    "<S> , we compare with various weak  coupling and strong  coupling approximations and discuss the importance of finite  size effects as well as the accuracy of the dmrg . </S>"
