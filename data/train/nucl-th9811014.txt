    "the interacting boson model ( ibm ) @xcite was originally proposed as a phenomenological model couched in terms of @xmath7 and @xmath8 bosons of which the microscopic structure ( e.g. , in terms of the shell model ) was unknown .",
    "this state of affairs quickly changed with the realization that the bosons could be interpreted as correlated ( cooper ) pairs with angular momentum @xmath9 and @xmath10 , formed by the nucleons in the valence shell .",
    "a connection with an underlying shell - model picture could be established by making a distinction between a proton pair ( @xmath11 boson ) and a neutron pair ( @xmath12 boson ) , the resulting model being referred to as the proton  neutron interacting boson model or ibm-2@xcite .",
    "the ibm-2 has been applied extensively and successfully to even  even medium - mass and heavy nuclei @xcite where the protons and neutrons occupy different valence shells . in the latter situation",
    "it is natural to assume correlated proton ",
    "proton and neutron  neutron pairs , and to include ( longe - range ) proton  neutron correlations through a quadrupole interaction in the hamiltonian . in lighter @xmath13 nuclei where the protons and the neutrons occupy the same valence shell ,",
    "this approach no longer is valid since there is no reason not to include proton ",
    "neutron @xmath14 pairs in such nuclei .",
    "the inclusion of proton  neutron @xmath14 pairs ( @xmath15 bosons ) has indeed been proposed by elliott and white @xcite and the resulting model has been named ibm-3 . since the ibm-3 contains a complete isospin triplet of @xmath14 bosons , it is possible to construct ibm-3 hamiltonians that conserve isospin symmetry and this feature can be exploited to establish a more direct correspondence between the ibm-3 and the shell model @xcite . as a final refinement of the interacting boson model , elliott and evans",
    "@xcite proposed the inclusion of a proton ",
    "neutron @xmath16 pair ( @xmath17 boson ) leading to a version referred to as ibm-4 .",
    "both @xmath16 and @xmath14 proton  neutron ( @xmath18 ) bosons play an important role in @xmath19 nuclei but their importance decreases with increasing difference @xmath20 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath16 bosons are crucial in odd ",
    "odd nuclei while even  even nuclei seem to be adequately described with @xmath14 bosons only .",
    "these observations then define the scope of the present work : the ibm-3 is geared towards applications to even ",
    "even @xmath13 nuclei although its results can be extended to isobaric analog states in neighboring odd  odd nuclei .",
    "the ibm-3 has a rich algebraic structure that starts from the dynamical algebra @xmath21 and allows several dynamical symmetries containing the @xmath22 subalgebra , necessary to conserve isospin symmetry . in this paper the dynamical symmetries",
    "are analyzed that arise after the reduction of @xmath21 to the direct product @xmath23 and thus assume a separation of the orbital ( @xmath2 ) and isospin sectors .",
    "the latter approximation plays the same role in ibm-3 as does the assumption of @xmath24-spin symmetry in ibm-2 @xcite .",
    "in realistic ibm-2 calculations the lowest - energy states are ( approximately ) symmetric under the exchange of proton and neutron indices , that is , they have a large component in the symmetric representation @xmath25 $ ] of @xmath1 ( or , equivalently , a large component with maximal @xmath24 spin , @xmath26 ) .",
    "non - symmetric states @xmath27 $ ] occur at higher energies @xcite .",
    "although realistic ibm-2 hamiltonians may contain important @xmath24-spin mixing interactions , @xmath24 spin is usually an approximately conserved symmetry because of the existence of a relatively large majorana interaction .",
    "the majorana operator is diagonal in @xmath1 [ or @xmath28 and separates the different @xmath1 representations @xmath25,[n-1,1],\\dots$ ] [ or @xmath29 representations with @xmath30 . as a result",
    ", the orbital and charge ( or @xmath24-spin ) spaces are approximately decoupled in ibm-2 .",
    "the situation is very similar in ibm-3 , the @xmath31 of ibm-2 being replaced by @xmath23 , which by analogy can be expected to be an approximate symmetry algebra .",
    "this is indeed confirmed in some realistic ibm-3 calculations for @xmath32-shell nuclei @xcite which show that , at low energy , states can be approximately classified by @xmath1 representations @xmath25 $ ] or @xmath27 $ ] .",
    "representations of lower symmetry such as @xmath33 $ ] are less well realized but these are not considered in this paper .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows .",
    "first , in section  [ sec - al - struc ] , a general overview of the algebraic structure of ibm-3 is given ; in section  [ sec - ham ] the ibm-3 hamiltonian is specified in different representations . in section  [ sec - dyn - sym ] a brief review",
    "is given of the three symmetries that are analyzed in this paper .",
    "sections  [ sec - elec - tran ] and [ sec - two - nucl ] are devoted to the analysis of electromagnetic transitions and two - nucleon transfer probabilities , respectively , and in section  [ sec - bos - num ] analytic expressions are given for boson - number expectation values .",
    "in section  [ sec - exp ] the most relevant predictions of ibm-3 ( as contrasted with ibm-1 and ibm-2 ) are pointed out and results of numerical calculations in the @xmath6 shell are shown .",
    "finally , conclusions are presented in section  [ sec - conclu ] .",

    "two important invariances occur in the context of ibm-3 : rotational and isospin invariance .",
    "the first one is an exact symmetry and leads to conservation of total angular momentum , here denoted as @xmath41 ; the second gives rise to the isospin quantum number @xmath42 .",
    "isospin is only an approximate symmetry ( mainly broken by the coulomb interaction ) but throughout this paper it is assumed to be exact .",

    ". the structure parameters of the quadrupole operators are assumed to be independent of @xmath42 : @xmath195 and @xmath196 .",
    "the parameter @xmath197 is obtained from the binding energies and single - particle levels of @xmath198ca , @xmath199sc , and @xmath200ti .",
    "the parameters @xmath201 and @xmath202 are determined through a best fit to low - energy states in @xmath203ti and @xmath191cr .",
    "finally , @xmath204 is obtained through a comparison with a shell - model calculation @xcite since reliable experimental information on states with @xmath205 is scarce .",
    "the parameters thus determined are : @xmath206 mev ( the same for @xmath11 , @xmath15 , and @xmath12 bosons ) , @xmath207 mev , @xmath208 , and @xmath209 mev .",
    "it is worth noting that the quadrupole ",
    "quadrupole interaction contains a sizeable contribution to the majorana term @xcite and this guarantees an approximate @xmath1 symmetry for the low - lying states .",
    "the experimental and theoretical spectra are shown in fig .",
    "[ comp - spec ] .",
    "an overall agreement is observed for the low - lying states of all nuclei ; the degree of agreement is similar to the one obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite .    regarding the electromagnetic transitions , some general conclusions independent of the @xmath1 symmetry can be obtained .",
    "unfortunately there are only few measured @xmath210(m1 ) transition rates in this mass region and it is difficult to determine the parameters in the electromagnetic operators . in table",
    "[ tab - comp - ener ] the observed energies of non - symmetric states are compared to the ones calculated with ibm-3 , the non - symmetric character of the states being proposed on the basis of their decay properties . in table",
    "[ tab - comp - bm1 ] the @xmath210(m1 ) values in ibm-3 are compared to the observed ones when known or to the shell - model values otherwise .",
    "two parameters enter the ibm-3 calculation : the isovector boson @xmath107 factor which is fixed to reproduce the @xmath211 value in @xmath189ti @xmath212 . although not suggested by microscopy , one may study the influence of an isotensor boson @xmath107 factor which is also illustrated in table  [ tab - comp - bm1 ] with @xmath213 , derived from the @xmath211 in @xmath190ti .",
    "rather unexpectedly , it is seen that the isotensor contribution improves the fit significantly .",
    "note that the isotensor contribution for @xmath189ti and @xmath191cr vanishes because @xmath18 for both nuclei .",
    "although boson - number expectation values are not directly measurable quantities , a comparison with more elaborate calculations can be carried out . in fig .",
    "[ bos - num ] the expectation value of boson numbers in ibm-3 in the ground state of even  even fe and cr isotopes is compared with smmc calculations @xcite .",
    "it is seen that the simple formulas ( [ avera ] ) qualitatively reproduce the features of full microscopic calculations .",
    "the smmc results are scaled such that the pair - number expectation values are normalized to the total number of bosons , which is only approximately valid for shells with finite size .",
    "the contributions of the majorana and @xmath214 terms in the hamiltonian are crucial to the relative position of states with different @xmath1 symmetry and isospin .",
    "we illustrate this with a schematic calculation that is relevant for @xmath19 nuclei .",
    "it is generally assumed that states with @xmath33 $ ] @xmath1 symmetry occur at higher energy than those with @xmath27 $ ] .",
    "this , however , is not necessarily so in @xmath19 even  even nuclei .",
    "this peculiarity arises because the lowest allowed isospin value in the @xmath27 $ ] representation is @xmath14 , while it can be @xmath16 in the @xmath33 $ ] representation .",
    "thus , although the majorana term always favors @xmath27 $ ] over @xmath33 $ ] states , in @xmath19 nuclei this effect is counteracted by the @xmath214 term . to make the argument somewhat more quantitative , assume a simple hamiltonian with a @xmath214 and a majorana term besides a general orbital dependence @xmath215 , @xmath216 appropriate values of the parameters in the @xmath6 shell are @xmath209 mev and @xmath217 , 2.5 , and 0.7 mev for @xmath218 , 3 , and 4 , respectively , where the values of @xmath219 are estimated from the energies of non - symmetric states in @xmath203ti @xcite .",
    "application of the schematic hamiltonian ( [ sch - ham2 ] ) to an @xmath19 nucleus with four bosons ( e.g. , @xmath191cr or @xmath220ge ) gives the result shown in fig .",
    "[ sch - spec ] .",
    "it is seen in particular that the @xmath33t=0 $ ] states occur at a lower energy than those with @xmath27t=1 $ ] .",
    "an intruiging feature is that the @xmath33 $ ] states can not decay to the symmetric ground - state configuration if one assumes the electromagnetic operators of one - body type in the bosons .",
    "however , this effect is not very likely to persist for realistic hamiltonians because of @xmath1 mixing between @xmath33 $ ] and @xmath27 $ ] states .",
    "the main objective of this paper was to present a comprehensive analysis of the symmetry limits of the ibm-3 that conserve @xmath0 charge or @xmath1 @xmath2 symmetry .",
    "although particular results were obtained for the three limits @xmath221 , @xmath154 , and @xmath222 , special emphasis was given to a general analysis independent of the latter limits but only requiring @xmath0 or @xmath1 symmetry .",
    "the origin of this symmetry was shown to be related to the majorana interaction in the ibm-3 hamiltonian which leads to a decoupling of the orbital and isospin spaces . in previous , microscopic studies of ibm-3",
    "the @xmath0 charge symmetry had been shown to be approximately valid and this paper has taken this result as a starting point to derive the properties of all limits with that symmetry .",
    "a numerical application of the ibm-3 was presented involving a simple , phenomenological hamiltonian with a few parameters either derived from shell - model considerations or fitted to the data .",
    "this hamiltonian was applied to even ",
    "even @xmath6 nuclei where the @xmath0 charge symmetry is thought to be approximately valid .",
    "reasonable results were obtained but any analysis of this kind will ultimately be hampered by the limited amount of collectivity exhibited by these nuclei .",
    "applications to regions of more collective nuclei should thus be considered ( e.g. , @xmath223 ) .",
    "a valuable aspect of algebraic models is that they usually are simple enough as to give clues concerning key observable quantities .",
    "the ibm-3 is no exception .",
    "examples are the expressions derived for the expectation values of the various boson numbers ; although these can not be measured , they can be compared to similar expectation values calculated in more elaborate models . in particular , the ibm-3 expectation values were shown to be in good agreement with shell model monte carlo calculations . the present analysis has also revealed two intriguing predictions of the ibm-3 .",
    "the first concerns the transfer probility of a @xmath15 boson ( i.e. , a proton ",
    "neutron @xmath14 pair ) which turns out to be zero in ibm-3 . as such",
    ", this result is too schematic to assign it too much weight : the transfer necessarily takes place from or into an odd  odd nucleus for which an ibm-3 description is incomplete .",
    "however , it indicates that the same problem should be revisited in ibm-4 where it possibly can teach us something about the proton  neutron pair structure of @xmath224 nuclei .",
    "the second intriguing prediction of the ibm-3 concerns the energy of non - symmetric states . in @xmath19 nuclei , and in @xmath19 nuclei _ only _ , it is conceivable that the @xmath33 $ ] states occur at a lower energy than those with @xmath27 $ ] symmetry .",
    "assuming exact @xmath0 charge symmetry , the decay from @xmath33 $ ] to the symmetric ground - state configuration @xmath25 $ ] is forbidden .",
    "the breaking of @xmath0 charge symmetry will , however , destroy this selection rule ; it would nevertheless be of interest to verify whether any remnant of it is still observable .",
