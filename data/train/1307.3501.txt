    "in solar broadband spectral observations at microwave frequency range , especially at decimeter and centimeter wavelength , it has been known for a long time that there are many isolated short - timescale strong bursts , such as microwave spike bursts ( benz , 1986 ; huang & nakajima , 2005 ; rozhansky et al , 2008 ; debrowski et al , 2011 ) , dot bursts ( karishan et al . 2003 ) , and narrow bandwidth type iii bursts ( huang & tan , 2012 ) occurred frequently associated with solar flares .",
    "the main features of these bursts include very short timescales ( lifetime @xmath2s ) , very narrow frequency bandwidth ( relative bandwidth @xmath3 ) , very high brightness temperatures ( @xmath4 ) , and always occurred in great clusters . practically , there are always no obviously differences among these three types of bursts , we may call them by a joint name as solar small scale microwave bursts ( smbs ) , which possibly associates with similar strong non - thermal energy releasing processes .",
    "smbs are always superposed on the underlying broadband flaring continuum emission ( malville , aller , & jensen , 1967 , etc ) and frequently occurred in the rising and maximum phases of solar impulsive flares ( beaz , 1986 , csillaghy & benz , 1993 , etc ) .",
    "however , recent observations indicate that they also occurred in flare decay phase and even after the flare ending ( benz et al , 2002 ; huang & tan , 2012 ) .",
    "the obvious differences of smbs from the underlying broadband flaring continuum emissions indicate that they may have entirely different generation mechanisms .",
    "actually , smbs are possibly related to some strong non - thermal processes with very short timescale and very small size of flaring magnetic energy release region .",
    "possibly , these processes may be elementary in solar flares , which should be fragmented ( benz , 1985 ; messmer & benz , 2000 ) .",
    "however , so far , there is no perfect model to explain the formation of flaring fragmentation and the generation of smbs . as for the source locations of smbs , there are two different viewpoints of theories .",
    "the electron cyclotron maser emission mechanism ( ecme ) predicted that the smb emission would be expected to originate from some loss - cone instabilities in some regions close to the footpoints of magnetic loop with strong magnetic field : @xmath5 ( melrose & dulk 1982 ) .",
    "here , @xmath6 is electron gyro - frequency and @xmath7 is electron plasma frequency . in other theories ,",
    "smbs are proposed to produce from acceleration processes and therefore would be expected to originate in the location of acceleration sites .",
    "tan & tan ( 2012 ) found that each pulse of a microwave quasi - periodic pulsation at frequency of 2.60 - 3.80 ghz is composed of a group of smbs , and the concomitant zebra pattern indicates that the corresponding magnetic field strength is only 147 - 210 gs , which is too weak to meet the ecme conditions .",
    "therefore , they proposed that smbs are triggered by plasma emission , another coherent emission mechanism , which is triggered by langmuir turbulence produced from non - thermal energetic electrons ( zheleznyakov & zlotnik 1975 ; chernov et al .",
    "2003 ) . in this case , the formation of smbs is closely related to electron accelerations and the evolution of plasma instability .",
    "benz et al . ( 2002 ) find that decimetric spikes are single source occurred in the flare decay phase and located about 20 - 400@xmath8 away from the flare site in hard x - ray and soft x - ray bursts .",
    "this fact indicates that the decimetric spikes are questionable to related with the main flare electron acceleration , but possibly with some coronal post - flare acceleration processes .",
    "therefore , the much more detailed investigation of smbs will give insight into the elementary processes taking place in flaring regions , and reveal the intrinsic properties of accelerations of non - thermal particles .",
    "in order to recognize smbs clearly , telescopes need enough high spectral resolutions and high cadence .",
    "gudel - benz law indicates that the lifetime of smbs is largely a function of emission frequency in frequency range 237 - 2695 mhz : @xmath9 ( gudel & benz , 1990 ) .",
    "this law predicts that the lifetime around 1.20 ghz is about 12 ms .",
    "csillaghy & benz ( 1993 ) found that bandwidth of individual smb is also a function of emission frequency : @xmath10 , which implies the frequency bandwidth about 13 mhz at frequency around 1.20 ghz .",
    "the chinese solar broadband radio spectrometer in huairou ( sbrs / huairou ) at 1.10 - 1.34 ghz has a cadence of 1.25 ms and spectral resolution of 4 mhz .",
    "it is sufficient to recognize smbs occurred in the corresponding frequency range .",
    "this work presents a comprehensive investigation of smbs by using the broadband spectral observations obtained by sbrs / huairou in several solar flares occurred in active region noaa 10720 during 2005 january 15 - 20 .",
    "a large number of smbs are registered in these flares .",
    "section 2 introduces the observation data and the main properties and evolutionary characteristics of smbs in these flares .",
    "section 3 presents a physical discussion on the above results , and finally , some conclusions are summarized in section 4 .",
    "the solar active region noaa 10720 is a flare - productive and most impressive one on the solar visible disk in january of 2005 .",
    "it appeared on the solar disk as a simple beta type magnetic region on jan .",
    "10 , grew rapidly and fully developed on jan 15 , ended as a complex sunspot region on jan .",

    "the observation sensitivity is : @xmath13 , here @xmath14 is the standard flux of the quiet sun . from the solar geophysical data ( sgd )",
    "we can obtain @xmath14 at frequencies of 610 mhz , 1415 mhz , 2695 mhz , 2800 mhz , and 4995 mhz , and make the calibration of the observational data followed the method reported by tanaka et al .",
    "( 1973 ) . as for the strong burst",
    ", the receiver may work beyond its linear range and a nonlinear calibration method is replaced ( yan et al .",
    "similar to other congeneric instruments , such as phoenix ( 100 - 4000 mhz , benz et al .",

    "2001 ) , sbrs / huairou has no spatial resolution .",
    "however , as the sun is a strong radio emission source , a great deal of works ( e.g. dulk 1985 , etc . ) indicate that the microwave bursts received by spectrometers are always coming from the solar active region when the antenna points to the sun .",
    "a specialized software based on idl program has also been developed for analyzing the spectrograms , which can display the spectral fine structures clearly . in order to corroborate the results obtained by sbrs / huairou",

    "this work focused on studying these flare events .    in order to present a receivable statistical analysis of smbs ,",
    "it is necessary to confirm practical definitions of parameters for describing smbs .",
    "here we follow the definitions mainly from tarnstrom & philip ( 1972 ) to obtain the parameters .",
    "\\(1 ) burst strength ( @xmath15 ) : defined as the maximum emission intensity subtracting the background emission intensity before and after the corresponding smb .",
    "a flux enhancement @xmath15 which exceeds obviously to the quiet sun emission may be regarded as a microwave burst .",
    "an universal accepted criterion is 5@xmath16 , here @xmath16 is the standard deviation of the background emission , when a flux enhancement exceeds @xmath17 respect to the background emission , we may say it is an isolated burst event . for example , from the sgd record during 2005 jan 15 - 20 , we may get the standard flux value of the quiet sun @xmath18 sfu at frequency of 1.10 - 1.34 ghz .",
    "the corresponding sensitivity is about @xmath19 sfu .",
    "because the signal of smb is much shorter timescale and much narrower bandwidth than that of the underlying flare continuum emission , it is easily affected by other factors , such as the instrument perturbations .",
    "here we adopt the similar criteria of high energy physical experiments of 5 sigma to show a real observation result ( 3 - 5 sigma to show an evidence , and @xmath20 sigma only reflects a hint or clue ) .",
    "naturally , this criteria will leave out some smbs with relatively weak intensities .",
    "however , such high criteria can help us to avoid the influence of other factors and increase the confidence level of our analysis .",

    "\\(3 ) frequency bandwidth ( @xmath22 ) : can be measured from frequency width of the smb spectral profile with half emission intensity maximum .    in the above three parameters ,",
    "the key step is to determine the time or frequency at the maximum value and the half maximum value .",

    "sometimes , smbs become so crowded that we ca nt distinguish them with each other . in order to make the result believable , here we only analyze the isolated smbs , while neglect the crowded smbs which can not be distinguished from each other clearly .",
    "the isolated smb is defined as : the quench time between two smbs is longer than its lifetime , and the frequency gap between two smbs is wider than its frequency bandwidth .",

    "\\(2 ) the 8th column of table 1 listed the number of isolated smbs occurring in each flare at frequency of 1.10 - 1.34 ghz . here , we find that different flare has different manifestations of smbs : ( a ) the most abundant smbs are occurred in two long - duration flares : e5 , an m8.6 flare occurred on 2005 - 01 - 15 with duration of 83 min and about 6000 smbs at frequency 1.10 - 1.34 ghz ; and e13 , an x7.1 flare occurred on 2005 - 01 - 20 with duration of 50 min and about 12600 smbs ; ( b ) some sporadic smbs occurred in other 4 flares , including e1 , e10 , e11 , and e12 ; ( c ) the short - duration flares tend to be lack of smbs , such as e2 , e3 , e4 , e6 , e7 , e8 , and e9 .",
    "the following paragraphs present the detailed properties of smbs appeared in these flares .",
    "the goes soft x - ray emission indicates that the m8.6 flare starts at 05:54 ut , reaches to maximum at 06:37 ut , and ends at 07:17 ut on 2005 - 01 - 15 with duration of 83 min .",
    "it is a long - duration flare accompanying with a powerful cme with speed up to more than 2000 km / s and abundant smbs .",
    "smbs appear not only in the early rising and impulsive peak phases of the flare , but also occur in the flare decay phase .",
    "fig.2 presents two segments of smbs which occurred in the rising and decay phase of the long - duration m8.6 flare ( e5 ) on 2005 - 01 - 15 , respectively .",
    "the left panels show a segment spectrograms of smbs during 06:02:05.0 - o6:02:06.0 ut in the flare rising phase with lcp ( left - upper ) and rcp ( left - bottom ) .",
    "the bright small patches represent smbs which show very strong left polarization , and distribute randomly .",
    "the frequency bandwidth of individual smb is in the range of 8 - 32 mhz , and the lifetime is about 5 - 21 ms . as a comparison",
    ", the quench time between each adjacent two smbs is in the range of 50 - 100 ms which is much longer than smb lifetime .",
    "the frequency gap between each adjacent two smbs is in the range of 24 - 64 mhz , which is wider than the frequency bandwidth of each individual smb .",
    "the right panels of fig.2 presents another segment of smbs during 06:38:22.0 - 06:38:23.0 ut in the flare decay phase .",
    "it shows that almost all smbs are appeared in rcp with strong polarization .",
    "most of the lifetimes are shorter and the frequency bandwidths are narrower than that occurred in the flare rising phase . in both of the above two cases",
    ", the frequency drifting rates of some smbs can be measured , and the values of @xmath35 are in range of 1500 - 6000 mhz / s . at the same time , most of smbs behavior as perpendicular to the time axis that we can not detect their @xmath35 .",
    "possibly this is because of their high frequency drifting rates that we can not detect them for restrictions of limited spectral and temporal resolutions .",
    "for example , when the bandwidth is 12 mhz , the detectable maximum @xmath35 is 9600 mhz / s for the cadence 1.25 ms , etc .",
    "fig.3 presents the temporal profiles of emission intensities of two segments of smbs with lcp and rcp , respectively . as a comparison ,",
    "the emission intensity of the quiet sun recorded during 05:45:00.0 - 05:45:00.6 ut ( before the onset of the flare ) is also over - plotted on the same figure .",
    "it is obvious that the microwave emission can be decomposed into three components .",
    "the first component is the quiet sun emission ( @xmath42 ) which can be represented by the record before the solar flare ( e.g. during 05:45 - 05:50 ut ) ; the second one is the underlying broadband flaring continuum emission ( @xmath43 ) which can be defined as the emission during the gap between two smbs ; and the last one is the emission of smbs ( @xmath44 ) which exceeds @xmath43 significantly . around the m8.6 flare , @xmath45 sfu at lcp and rcp without significant polarization .",
    "the left panel of fig.3 shows that @xmath46 sfu ( the standard deviation @xmath47 sfu ) at lcp and 87.7 sfu ( @xmath48 sfu ) at rcp , and @xmath44 at lcp is in the range of 43 - 85 sfu which exceeds 5@xmath16 with respect to @xmath43 and far surpass the instrument sensitivity @xmath49 .",

    "@xmath53 sfu at rcp which also exceeds 5@xmath16 with respect to @xmath43 and far surpass the instrument sensitivity @xmath49 .",
    "we may suppose that each smb is an independent burst which is different from the underlying broadband flaring continuum and the quiet sun emissions .",
    "the spectrogram in fig .",
    "2 implies that the distribution of smbs is randomly , either in the flare rising phase or in the decay phase .",
    "actually , from the onset of the long - duration m8.6 flare to its decay phase , there are numerous smbs occurred .",
    "the left panel of fig.4 presents the distribution of the smb occurrence rate in the flare and a comparison with the goes soft x - ray emission ( goes sxr ) , the microwave emission intensity at lcp and rcp .",
    "the plus signs ( + ) indicate smb occurrence rate .",
    "the solid curves are the radio emission intensity at 1.20 ghz .",
    "the positive and negative values indicate the presence at lcp and rcp , respectively .",
    "the comparison among goes sxr , the microwave emission intensity at lcp and rcp indicate that there are time differences between their maxima . the maximum of goes sxr occurred at about 06:37 ut , of lcp at about 06:25 ut , and of rcp at about 06:16 ut .",
    "a rough estimation indicates that there are about 6000 smbs associated with the flare . among them , about 94% lcp smbs occurred before the lcp maximum , and about 91% rcp smbs occurred after the lcp maximum .",
    "the polarization is another important parameter to reflect the nature of smbs .",
    "the right panel of fig.4 plots the temporal distribution of the polarization degree of smbs averaged in time interval of one second ( marked as @xmath54 ) associated with the m8.6 flare . in order to investigate the relationships between smbs and the underlying flare broadband emission , the polarization degree of @xmath42 ( during 05:45 - 05:57 ut ) and @xmath43 ( during 05:57 - 07:15 ut )",
    "are also over - plotted on the same figure . here , we find that @xmath42 has no obvious polarization with @xmath55 , @xmath43 has a moderate left - handed circular polarization increasing slowly from the rising phase to decay phase and in range of @xmath56 , and then decreasing rapidly to below 10% after the end of the flare .",
    "different from the above two components , almost all smbs are strong circular polarization with degrees of polarization exceeding 55% ; it is strong left - handed circular polarization before lcp maximum ( 06:25 ut ) and strong right - handed circular polarization after lcp maximum , mainly .",
    "there is no obvious correlation between the polarizations of smbs and background emission ( @xmath42 and @xmath43 ) .",

    "therefore , the reversed frequency may reflect the region where magnetic reconnections take place , and the reversed time may reflect the propagating process of energetic electrons from the acceleration site to its emission source region .",

    "it is an x7.1/2b flare , the most extremely powerful flare event occurred in the deep descending phase of solar cycle 23 .",
    "it has attracted great attentions from solar and solar - terrestrial community for its strong fast halo cme , strong gamma - ray bursts with energy up to 200 mev , the strongest solar energetic particle ( sep ) flux , and the strongest microwave bursts ( grechnev , et al , 2008 ; bombardieri , et al , 2008 ; wang , zhao , & zhou , 2009 ) .",
    "the most important is that e13 is an smb abundant event . from the sbrs / huairou observation at 1.10 - 1.34 ghz , there are about 12600 isolated smbs distinguished .",
    "different from e5 , there is no any isolated smbs occurred in the early rising and impulsive peak phase of the e13 flare .",

    "the left panel of fig.7 presents the distribution of smb occurrence rate in the flare and comparisons with goes solar x - ray emission , the underlying microwave emission intensity at lcp and rcp . here , we find that all smbs are occurred during 07:10 - 07:45 ut , after or far away the maxima of goes solar x - ray emission , underlying microwave emission intensity at lcp and rcp .",
    "the smb distribution is very crowded together , and some of the smb occurrence rate ( @xmath41 ) exceed 100 , which is much higher than that occurred in the above m8.6 flare event .",
    "the right panel of fig.7 presents a comparison of polarization degrees between the quiet sun ( before 06:36 ut ) , underlying flare broadband continuum emission ( during 06:36 - 07:26 ut ) , and smbs . here",

    "the burst strength is in the range of 29 - 72 sfu with averaged value 40.1 sfu .",
    "the lifetime is in the range of 20 - 76 ms , the averaged lifetime is 49.7 ms , and the averaged frequency bandwidth is 24.8 mhz .    the right panels show a 2.3 s segment spectrogram of a few isolated smbs occurred during 07:43:19.7 - 07:43:22.0 ut in the decay phase of another long - duration m6.7 flare ( e10 ) on 2005 - 01 - 19 .",
    "there are totally 45 isolated smbs associated with the flare .",
    "some of them have frequency drifting rates in the range from -61.3 mhz / s to -253.7 mhz / s . here , smbs are weakly right polarization with @xmath73 , the averaged lifetime is 221.1 ms , the averaged burst strength @xmath74 sfu , and the averaged frequency bandwidth is 41.7 mhz which is much wider than that occurred in the smb abundant long - duration flares .         actually , table 2 indicates that in the 4 flare events with sporadic smbs , the smb lifetime is much longer , the frequency bandwidths are wider , the frequency drifting rates are much slower , and the smb burst strengths are a bit smaller than that in the long - duration flares with a large amount of smbs .",
    "the above analysis shows that there are 6 flares in active region noaa10720 having isolated smbs at frequency of 1.10 - 1.34 ghz , some of them are abundant with smbs , while others only have sporadic smbs .",
    "\\(1 ) among the 6 flare events , there are 3 events having smbs in their decay phase , and they are just the long - duration flares .",
    "this fact implies that long - duration flares tend to produce more smbs in the decay phase .",
    "\\(2 ) most smbs , especially the smbs occurred abundantly in the decay phase of long - duration flares , have strongly circular polarization which is extremely different from the background emission ( @xmath42 and @xmath43 ) , very short timescale ( @xmath755 - 15ms ) , and narrow frequency band ( around 0.8 - 2.0% ) .",
    "\\(3 ) in the long - duration flares , some smbs are occurred in the deep decay phase far away from the flare maxima , even after the flare ending , and they still have similar burst strength and strong polarization . some of smbs have reversed frequency drifting rates , the reversed frequency is about 1.15 - 1.19 ghz , and the reversed time is about 20 - 80 ms ahead of the corresponding smbs .",
    "\\(4 ) there is no obvious correlation of the burst strength , lifetime , bandwidth , frequency drifting rates , polarizations degrees between smbs and background emission ( @xmath42 and @xmath43 ) .",
    "this fact implies that smbs are independent bursts overlapping on the underlying background emission .",
    "from the relative frequency bandwidth of smbs we may make an estimation of the upper limited spatial scales of the source region : @xmath76 . here , @xmath77 is the scale length of emission frequency around the source region .",
    "the highly circular polarization of smbs indicate that the emission mechanism is possibly the fundamental plasma emission , and the emission frequency can be expressed : @xmath78 .",
    "@xmath79 is the electron plasma density . then @xmath80",
    "here , @xmath81 is the scale length of plasma density ( @xmath82 ) which depends on the plasma thermal temperature ( @xmath83 ) . supposing that thermal temperature around the source region is about 1 mk , @xmath84 km , and the source region is near the lower part of corona",
    ". then the upper limited spatial width of smb source regions can be obtained .",
    "the eighth column of table 2 presents the estimated upper limited width of smb source regions , which is in the range of 160 - 700 km .",
    "this result is consistent with the vlbi imaging observations which shows the diameter of spike source region about 50 km at 1663 mhz ( tapping , et al , 1983 ) .",
    "furthermore , the lower limit of the smb s emission brightness temperature ( @xmath85 ) can be deduced ( smerd , 1950 ; tan et al , 2009 ) : @xmath86 here , units of @xmath69 and @xmath22 are in sfu and hz , respectively .",
    "the last column of table 2 lists the estimated lower limited brightness temperature of smbs , which is in range of @xmath0 - 1.92@xmath1 k. as a comparison , the image observation indicates that the length of active region ar10720 is about 200 arcseconds at 17 ghz ( obtained from nobeyama radio heliograph ) , we may suppose that the source region of the flaring radio emission will be larger than 200 arcseconds . as a upper limit",
    ", the emission brightness temperature of the flare radio emission at 1.20 ghz is about @xmath87 k , which is several orders lower than that of smbs .",
    "the emission brightness temperature of the quiet sun can be also estimated as @xmath88 k , which is two orders lower than that of the flaring broadband emissions .",
    "the very high brightness temperatures of smbs indicate that the emission mechanism should be some coherent emissions , which may reflect the presence of non - thermal energetic electrons in the source region . considering that they occur not only in the flare rising and impulsive phases , but also in the flare decay phase and even far away from the impulsive phase , possibly they reflect the existence of similar small scale nonthermal energy releasing in the flare decay phase .",
    "the most frequently mentioned coherent mechanism is ecme which is supposed to be the formation mechanism of solar radio spike bursts by many people ( fleishman , et al , 2003 , etc ) .",
    "however , ecme occurs only when the following conditions are satisfied ( melrose & dulk , 1982 ) : @xmath89 and @xmath90 here , @xmath91 is the emission frequency , @xmath92 is the harmonic number , @xmath93 is the lorentz factor of the energetic electrons , @xmath94 and @xmath95 are the parallel components of the wave number and electron velocity . the most favorable regime to produce ecme is the loss - cone instabilities occurred near the footpoint of flare loops . if the mechanism is ecme , then from equ.(3 )",
    ", the magnetic field strength in the smb source region should be @xmath96 430 gs .",
    "so far , we have no direct measurement of magnetic field in solar corona .",
    "microwave zebra patterns ( zp ) may be an useful tool to provide information of magnetic field associated to the microwave source regions ( tan et al .",
    "it is fortunate that there are several zps accompanying with smbs in e5 flare .",
    "fig.9 presents three segments of zps which occurred before the flare peak ( 06:31:30 - 06:31:55 ut , left ) , in the flare decay phase ( 06:51:06.4 - 06:61:07.6 ut , middle ) , and near the end of the flare ( 07:17:30 - 07:17:34 ut , right ) , respectively .",
    "the left one is a long - duration zp , which frequency range is in 1.136 - 1.340 ghz ( central frequency is about 1.24 ghz ) , lasts for about 25 s , and shows moderate rcp with polarization degree about 48% .",
    "the frequency separation between the adjacent zebra stripes is in the range of 78 - 88 mhz , the average value is 84 mhz .",
    "the middle panel shows an zp at frequency range 1.10 - 1.25 ghz ( central frequency about 1.18 ghz ) , strong lcp with polarization degree of about 71.3% , the frequency separation between the adjacent zebra stripes is in the range of 16 - 20 mhz with averaged value 18 mhz .",
    "the right panel shows an zp at frequency range 1.10 - 1.20 ghz ( central frequency about 1.15 ghz ) , strong lcp with polarization degree very close to 100% .",
    "the frequency separation between the adjacent zebra stripes is in the range of 12 - 16 mhz , the average value is about 14 mhz .",
    "fig.9 appears that the central frequency of zps have an obvious decreasing from the early to late in the flare . at the same time , the polarization of zps have a change from rcp to lcp , which is approximately different from that of smbs . using the similar method in tan et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , the estimated magnetic field strengths is about 126.8 - 143.0 gs , 26 - 32.5 gs , and 19.5 - 26.0 gs , respectively in the source region , which is much weaker than the requirement of equ.(3 ) .",
    "actually , it is possible that the source region of smbs may be different from zps .",
    "however , the linear force - free magnetic extrapolation indicates that it is very difficult to be more than 400 gs in the lower corona region above the active region 10720 ( cheng , et al , 2011 ) .",
    "both results of the above estimation indicate that ecme seems difficult to be the mechanism of smb formation .",
    "the another kind of coherent mechanism is plasma emission , which is generated from the coupling of two excited plasma waves at frequency of @xmath97 with weak polarization , or the coupling of an excited plasma wave and a low - frequency electrostatic wave at frequency of about @xmath7 with strong polarization ( zheleznyakov & zlotnik 1975 , chernov et al .",
    "the plasma waves are excited by fast electrons in relatively weak magnetic fields : @xmath98 and @xmath99 here , @xmath100 is the velocity of fast electrons , @xmath101 is the velocity of the thermal electrons in background .",
    "equ.(4 ) indicates that energetic electrons are necessary , and fast electron beam plays a dominant role in plasma emission processes .",
    "it is langmuir wave that can resonantly interact with electrons of @xmath102 and remove free energy .",
    "the recently only accepted form which can produce high levels of langmuir waves is the bump - in - the - tail instability , or say two - streaming instability .",
    "there is only one widely accepted means of creating bump - in - the - tail distribution : having fast electrons outpace slow ones so that , at some distance from the acceleration region , fast electrons arrive first , trigger a langmuir wave , resonantly interact with the ambient electrons , and transfer the free energy into emission .",
    "when the langmuir wave reaches to some place where equ.(5 ) does not agree , it will quench .",
    "the very short lifetime of smb requires that the source region must be highly inhomogeneous filled with great numbers of small scale structures .",
    "similar to the regime of microwave quasi - periodic pulsation with millisecond bursts ( tan & tan , 2012 ) , here we may also adopt the same model to interpret the formation of smbs .",
    "we may suppose the post - flaring loops are current - carrying plasma loops , where the resistive tearing mode instability can be triggered , and causes the formation of many small scale magnetic islands along each rational surface in the plasma loops .",
    "each x - point between the adjacent magnetic islands will be a small reconnection site and will produce secondary acceleration on the ambient electrons , similar to the regime in current sheet ( shen , lin & murphy , 2011 ) .",
    "these accelerated electrons impact the adjacent plasmas around the small x - point , trigger the langmuir turbulence and plasma waves , and produce microwave bursts by plasma emission mechanism .",
    "such microwave bursts are just smbs .",
    "as there are many magnetic x - points in the current - carrying plasma loops , each x - point will be a small reconnection site , and the region around each x - point will be a source of an smb .",
    "as a result , smbs can arise in huge clusters .",
    "however , as we are lack of imaging observations , it is a big challenge to set up a more self - consistent structure of the smb source region .",
    "the above analysis indicates that non - thermal energy releasing and highly inhomogeneity in source region are necessary for the formation of smbs in the frame of plasma emissions .",
    "as the frequency of plasma emission depends on the plasma density @xmath103 , when the fast electrons move in the inhomogeneous ambient plasma , the frequency will drift : @xmath104 . here , @xmath105 .",
    "@xmath92 is the harmonics , @xmath106 is the fundamental emission , @xmath107 is the second harmonic emission",
    ". then the velocity of fast electrons can be estimated : @xmath108    then , from the frequency drifting rates of smbs , we may estimate the velocity of the fast electrons .",
    "for example in the long - duration flare e5 , the frequency drifting rates are in the range of 1200 - 9600 mhz s@xmath67 , and the corresponding velocities of fast electrons are in range of 0.07 - 0.53c , and the kinetic energy is @xmath109 kev . here , c is speed of the light . in another long - duration flare e13 ,",
    "the frequency drifting rates are in the range of 1400 - 8800 mhz s@xmath67 , the corresponding velocities of fast electrons are in range of 0.08 - 0.49c , and the kinetic energy is @xmath110 kev .",
    "when @xmath111 , the exciter moves from tenuous plasma region to dense plasma region , such as the downward motion in corona ; when @xmath112 , the exciter moves from dense plasma region to the tenuous plasma region , such as the upward motion in corona .",
    "the reversed - drifting smb pairs may track the position of acceleration region . from the reversed time we may estimate the distance between the acceleration region and the smb source region : @xmath113 .",
    "supposing @xmath114 , and @xmath115 ms , then @xmath116 is about 400 - 38000 km .",
    "this agrees with the theoretical requirement that langmuir wave can be triggered in place at some distance from the acceleration region . and these facts are consistent with a similar recent result from euv and hard x - ray observations ( liu , chen , & petrosian , 2013 ) .    however , in flares with only sporadic smbs ( e1 , e10 , e11 , and e12 ) , the frequency drifting rates of some smbs are slow as 60 - 900 mhz s@xmath67 , the above method presents the velocities are only in the range of 0.003 - 0.05 c. considering their relatively longer lifetimes , wider frequency bandwidth , moderate circular polarizations , and occurred mainly in the early rising phase of mid- or short - duration flares , they are possibly associated with some small scale plasma jets",
    ". however , this is just a guess for lack of corresponding imaging observations .",
    "in the previous work ( benz , 1986 , etc . ) , since most of smbs ( mainly indicated spike bursts ) appear during the primary energy release in solar flares , they are regarded as fragmented into about ten thousands more or less single elementary flare bursts . and at least part of the flaring energy is carried by fast electrons released in these elementary flare bursts",
    ". however , this work presents a comprehensive analysis on a series of solar flares occurred in active region noaa 10720 during 2005 jan 15 - 20 , and indicates that long - duration flares can produce abundant independent isolated smbs in the flare decay phase as well as in flare rising phase , some of them are occurred even in the deep decay phase far away after the flare peak , and even after the flare ending .",
    "these smbs have strongly circular polarization which is extremely different from the background emission ( @xmath42 and @xmath43 ) , very short timescale ( around 5 - 15 ms ) , and narrow frequency band ( around 0.8 - 2.0% ) .",
    "possibly , they are independent bursts overlapping on the underlying background broadband continuum emission .",
    "the inferred brightness temperature is at least @xmath0 - 1.92@xmath1 k , and the obviously different polarizations of smbs from the background emission ( the quiet sun and flare emission ) indicates that each smb should be individual independent strong coherent emission burst which is related to some non - thermal energy releasing and production of energetic particles .",
    "these facts imply the existence of energetic particles and the strong nonthermal energy releasing processes with small scales in the decay phase of long - duration flares .",
    "it is meaningful to the prediction of space weather events .    as for the formation of smb , because the magnetic field strength deduced from zps and nonlinear force - free field extrapolation around the source region is too weak , ecme seems difficult to be the formation mechanism of smbs , while the plasma emission mechanism may become the favorable candidate for the formation of smbs at fundamental langmuir frequencies , although it also has some unresolved problems , such as the pattern of highly inhomogeneity in source regions . from the plasma mechanism",
    ", we may deduce the velocities and kinetic energy of fast electrons associated with smbs . using the observations of reversed drifting smbs we may track region of the electron acceleration and estimate the distance between the acceleration region and the smb source regions , etc .",
    "as energetic electrons coming from solar flares may create severe impacts to the environment of solar - terrestrial space .",
    "the activity of nonthermal processes and energetic electrons in the decay phases of long - duration flares indicate that it is also important to pay close attention to the impact of post - flare activities of long - duration flares on the space weather events .",
    "the study of smbs may reveal some new principles of the energetic non - thermal processes associated with solar flares , such as particles accelerations , the detailed structure of source region , and the mechanism of energy conversions , etc .",
    "because of the instrument limitations , this work just presents the behaviors of smbs in a relatively small frequency range ( 1.10 - 1.34 ghz ) .",
    "fig.6 and other spectrograms show that it is most possible to exceed the frequency range of 1.10 - 1.34 ghz .",
    "it is necessary to extend the observational frequency to below 1.10 ghz and above 1.34 ghz greatly with superhigh cadence and high frequency resolutions .",
    "additionally , the imaging observations at the corresponding frequencies are also most important for its ability to provide directly the locations , geometrical structures , and magnetic fields in the source region ( yan , et al , 2009 ) .",
    "these will help us to set up a much more self - consistent theoretical model of solar smbs .",
