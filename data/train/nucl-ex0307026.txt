    "ultra - relativistic heavy ions collisions are believed to produce initially hot systems that cool down by expanding until their temperature is low enough to release hadrons . were the conditions within these systems adequate to free , for a time , quarks and gluons of their hadronic confinement ?",
    "this question will remain pending at the end of the proceedings .",
    "our aim will be to assess whether or not the particle space - time emission pattern is consistent with a scenario where initially hot systems have cooled down by expanding . in this scenario , only a small fraction of the particles measured in the detectors , are produced in the initial collisions between the nuclei .",
    "most of the initially produced particles do not escape the system and reinteract inelastically with other particles .",
    "only the high transverse momentum particles are dominantly produced in the initial nucleus - nucleus collisions as there is not enough energy available to produce them after the system has cooled down . following this observation , we only consider particles with a transverse momentum smaller than 2 gev / c .",
    "hydrodynamic models describe the evolution of systems from hot initial stages until freeze - out by assuming zero mean free path , which provides the limit of maximum transverse expansion  @xcite . however , this affirmation is not strictly true because the equation of state , and especially its main feature , the phase transition , regulates the pressure , i.e. the collective expansion strength .",
    "hydrodynamic calculations may be used as a baseline to assess the presence of collective expansion , and ultimately to extract the equation of state of the system .",
    "complementary to the hydrodynamic calculations , we will also base our discussion on parameterization of the system final state .",
    "such parameterizations allow to quantify key points of the system final state as well as to investigate the consistency between various measures .    in these proceedings",
    ", we will first show that particle yield and transverse momentum distribution may be described assuming collective behaviors .",
    "then , we will investigate how the spatial extent of the pion source may be related to collective expansion .",
    "finally , we will discuss whether or not the time scales that are extracted assuming collective expansion make sense .",
    "the relative yields of many different particles species are well described by parameterizations assuming that particles are statistically produced within the available phase space  @xcite . with the additional assumption that the system is in thermal equilibrium at freeze - out",
    ", the fit parameters may be understood as temperature and chemical potential .",
    "the extracted temperature is on the order of 170 mev at rhic energies , which is remarkably close to the phase transition temperature predicted by lattice qcd  @xcite .",
    "it suggests but does not prove that particle yields are frozen out at the boundary between partonic and hadronic matter .",
    "particle yields stop changing when the number of inelastic interactions become insignificant",
    ". however , the number of elastic or pseudo - inelastic interactions ( such as @xmath4 ) may still remain significant .",
    "thus , the particle momenta may still significantly change after the yields are frozen - out ( at chemical freeze - out ) leading to a separate kinetic freeze - out stage .",
    "furthermore , if the chemical freeze - out corresponds to the boundary between partonic and hadronic matter , the interactions that lead to kinetic freeze - out depend on hadronic cross - sections .",
    "thus , the chemical and kinetic freeze - out of particles with low hadronic cross - sections , such as , presumably , @xmath0 , @xmath1 or @xmath2 may coincide .",
    "hydrodynamic calculations are successful at reproducing particle yields and transverse momentum spectra that have been measured at rhic  @xcite .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : fitptspectra ] , the blast wave parameterization  @xcite is also successful at reproducing @xmath5 , k , p , @xmath6 transverse momentum spectra measured in au - au collisions at @xmath3 130 gev published by the phenix  @xcite and star  @xcite collaborations .",
    "this parameterization is designed to mock up the final state of the hydrodynamic evolution .",
    "thus , it relies on transverse expansion to reproduce the spectra of different particle species with a single set of parameters : a freeze - out temperature and a mean flow rapidity ( or equivalently velocity ) .",
    "the freeze - out temperature is independent of the particle species the freeze - out time or position .",
    "the system is confined within an infinitely long cylinder along the beam line .",
    "longitudinal boost invariance is assumed .",
    "the transverse flow rapidity linearly increases from zero at the center to a maximum value ( @xmath7 ) at the edge of the system .",
    "in addition to the temperature and flow rapidity , the particle yields are also free parameters . the best fit parameters and @xmath8dof are summarized in table  [ tab : fitresult1 ] .",
    ".upper section : data used in the fit with their different centrality range .",
    "bottom section : bets fit parameters and @xmath8 dof . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     & 0.80 & 0.59 & 0.42 +    is the very short emission duration extracted from pion source radii also consistent with other measures ? before discussing this issue , it is important to recall that the emission duration is mostly determined by the difference ( or the ratio ) between the @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "as pointed out by the ceres collaboration  @xcite , the ratio @xmath11 and hence the emission duration may be artificially increased by a inappropriate coulomb correction applied to the two - pion correlation functions . with this point in mind",
    ", we argue that emission duration can not be very small ( i.e. less than 1 fm / c ) because it would nt leave enough time for the system to cool down from chemical to kinetic freeze - out and because it is not consistent with the measured yield of @xmath12  @xcite and @xmath13  @xcite resonances .",
    "the first point is valid if the chemical freeze - out temperature is truly higher than the kinetic freeze - out temperature . in this case , the requirement that the entropy can not decrease imposes , in a bounded system such as the one described by the blast wave parameterization , that the time between chemical and kinetic freeze - out is larger than 4 - 5 fm / c  @xcite .",
    "the second point has to do with the fact that the measured @xmath12 and @xmath13 yields are lower than calculated at chemical freeze - out using the same parameters ( temperature and chemical potential ) that reproduce the relative yield of all the other hadrons .",
    "this suppression is understood by arguing that the @xmath12 and @xmath14 decay products lose the invariant mass correlation when reinteracting ( pseudo-)elasticaly before freezing - out .",
    "these data challenge the scenario where chemical and kinetic freeze - out coincide , as this interpretation is only valid if ( pseudo)elastic interactions occur after chemical freeze - out .",
    "the lifetime of the @xmath12 and @xmath14 provide a gauge of the time between chemical and kinetic freeze - out which is on the order of 4 - 5 fm / c  @xcite .",
    "thus , the short emission duration extracted from fit to pion radii is inconsistent with other measures .",
    "however , this conclusion will need to be revisited when pion source radii are extracted using the proper coulomb correction technique .",
    "assessing the presence and characteristics of collective behaviors in ultra - relativistic heavy ion collisions is a key step towards the discovery of partonic matter . this step is well underway",
    "; we have shown that the data from au - au collisions at @xmath3 130 gev are consistent with systems undergoing a collective expansion . however , definite conclusions await the resolution of the following pending issues :    * carefully assess the effect of resonance feed - down on transverse momentum spectra . *",
    "improve the two - pion interferometry data by performing a proper coulomb correction and extending the data range to higher transverse momentum .",
    "this may clarify the time scale issues .",
    "* establish in a statisticaly significant manner whether or not @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 freeze - out at the same temperature and transverse flow velocity as @xmath5 , k , and protons . *",
    "investigate the no flow hypothesis by studying p - p and d - au collisions .",
    "indeed , space - momentum correlations such as the one that arrise from jet fragmentation may mock up the effect of flow .",
    "in addition to the measure described in these proceedings , new analyses will available soon .",
    "the large statistics available at rhic will allow to study the behavior of @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , with never used before tools such as @xmath15 or two - particle correlations .",
    "balance function analyses may also bring crucial information .",
    "furthermore the development of parameterizations such as the blast wave provides new opportunities to assess the consistency of the data within a single framework",
    ". however , with the quality and the variety of the data increasing significantly such parameterizations will be very significantly challenged in the coming future . in any cases , combining space - time analysis with yield and spectra analysis will remain the key to reach a global understanding of the ultra - relativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "+ i wish to thank the conference organizers for inviting me and hence providing me with the opportunity of developing these ideas .",
    "the blast wave fits were developed together with mike lisa following ten years of development within the community .",
    "these proceedings is the results of fruitfull discussions with ulrich heinz , mike lisa , dan magestro , thomas peitzmann , kai schweda , nu xu , and zanghbu xu , eugene yamamoto .",
    "i also wish to thank the whole star collaboration for the stimulating discussions that have gone along the release of the preliminary data shown at this conference ."
