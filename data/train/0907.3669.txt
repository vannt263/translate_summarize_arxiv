    "the enhanced production of the hadrons consisting of strange quarks , especially hyperons , was proposed to be one of the signatures of the formation quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) in relativistic heavy - ion collisions @xcite . in particular , the enhanced pair - production of thermal strange quarks was proposed to occur as an effect of quark and gluon deconfinement @xcite .",
    "the predicted enhancement in the production of hyperons has been observed in many experiments , e.  g. in ref .  @xcite . in temperature domains around @xmath2",
    "mev , deconfinement and and chiral symmetry restoration are the significant ingredients of the phase transformations of the qcd matter , and consequently they should play important roles in the thermal strange quark production . to elucidate their roles in the strange quark production , we study the probability of the production based on the thermodynamics . if the production rate is fast enough , the probability of thermal strange quark pair - production is @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the constituent strange quark mass and @xmath5 denotes the temperature .",
    "the probabilities of the strange quark pair - production in the hadronic gas ( e.g. @xmath6  mev ) and in the quark - gluon plasma ( e.g. @xmath7  mev ) are plotted respectively in fig .",
    "[ figure1](a ) . in fig .",
    "[ figure1](a ) , one can argue that the temperature dependence of @xmath8 follows the dot - dashed ( dashed ) curve when @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) , where @xmath11 is the critical temperature of the phase transformation .",
    "as the temperature increases , one would expect either a sudden or smooth jump of @xmath8 in the vicinity of @xmath11 . instead of the above argument",
    ", we focus on a more rigorous analysis on the temperature dependence of @xmath8 in the following contexts .",
    "the important physics aspects of @xmath8 is sensitive not only to the deconfinement of quarks and gluons , but also to the chiral symmetry restoration , as can be seen from the dependence of @xmath8 on @xmath4 .",
    "the recently developed nambu - jona - lasinio model with the polyakov loop ( the pnjl model ) incorporates both of the dynamics of deconfinement and chiral symmetry restoration in describing the phase transformations of the qcd matter @xcite .",
    "therefore , in this paper , we study the temperature dependence of @xmath4 by the three - flavor pnjl model in the mean - field approximation , thereby obtaining @xmath8 valid for the whole temperature range . besides , we investigate the temperature dependence of the adjoint polyakov loop and its implication for the gluon distribution function .",
    "finally , we obtain the temperature dependence of the pair - production rates of thermal strange quarks using the polyakov loop - suppressed quark and gluon distribution functions , and we identify the temperature where the gluonic contribution to the rate becomes dominant .",
    "the three - flavor pnjl model @xcite incorporates the phase transformations of deconfinement and chiral symmetry restoration in one theoretical framework .",
    "the order parameters of deconfinement and chiral phase transitions are the polyakov loops and the chiral quark condensates respectively .",
    "the polyakov loop in color - su(3 ) representation @xmath12 is defined as @xmath13 where @xmath14 denotes that the exponential is path - ordered , @xmath5 denotes the temperature , and @xmath15 is the temporal component of the @xmath16 gauge field in representation @xmath12 .",
    "in particular , @xmath17 and @xmath18 denote the polyakov loops in the fundamental and adjoint representations , respectively .",
    "the traces of the polyakov loops are denoted as @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 denote the color traces in the fundamental and adjoint representation , respectively .",

    "@xcite . in the limit of isospin symmetry , @xmath28 . from the above lagrangian",
    ", we obtain the grand canonical thermodynamic potential per unit volume , @xmath29 , in the mean field approximation .",
    "we obtain the temperature dependence of the order parameters , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 , by minimizing @xmath29 with respect to these order parameters and solving the equations simultaneously @xcite . besides",
    ", the constituent quark masses can be expressed as functions of the current masses and the chiral condensates @xmath34 where @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37  gev and @xmath38  gev @xcite .",

    "we obtain @xmath8 as a function of temperature with @xmath4 input by eq .",
    "( [ eq : ms ] ) , as shown in fig .  [ figure1 ] .",
    "we note that @xmath8 in the pnjl model exceeds @xmath8 of deconfined quarks for @xmath44  mev , which is due to an artifact of the pnjl model that @xmath45 and @xmath46 for @xmath44  mev .",

    "we obtain the thermal average of the adjoint polyakov loop from that of the fundamental polyakov loop by the following self - consistent procedure @xcite .",
    "first , we define the thermal average with respect to the weight function , @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 is a fit parameter depending on temperature @xcite .",
    "then , the thermal average of the fundamental polyakov loop gives the constraint equation , @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is , at each temperature , input by its mean - field value obtained in sec .",
    "[ sec : pnjl ] .",
    "we obtain @xmath57 by solving this constraint equation , and then we evaluate @xmath58 as a function of the temperature .",
    "we verify that , with this averaging procedure , the adjoint and fundamental polyakov loops satisfy the casimir scaling , @xmath59 , which is observed in lattice qcd @xcite .",
    "moreover , we obtain the color - averaged gluon distribution function @xcite @xmath60 we show that the color - averaged quark and gluon distribution functions are both suppressed by the polyakov loops , and the degree of suppression for the gluon distribution is higher than that of the quark distribution @xcite .",
    "the pair - production of thermal strange quarks is contributed by two processes , @xmath61 and @xmath1 .",
    "the production rates was first obtained by qcd perturbation theory for free quarks @xcite . in this paper , we take into account the effects of deconfinement and chiral symmetry restoration on the production rates . we obtain the strange quark production rate per unit volume by @xmath62 where the explicit expressions for @xmath63 and @xmath64 are shown in ref .  @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ figure1](b ) , we plot the temperature dependence of the production rates divided by @xmath48 for the pnjl model and those for free quarks respectively .",
    "the production rates for the pnjl model are smaller ( larger ) than those for free quarks when @xmath65  mev ( @xmath66  mev ) .",
    "this phenomenon is due to either the addition or the competition of the following two effects .",
    "one effect is the suppression of the thermal quark and gluon excitations by the polyakov loops , and the other effect is that , in the pnjl model , @xmath67 ( @xmath68 ) when @xmath69  mev ( @xmath70  mev ) .",
    "the later effect surpasses the former one when @xmath66  mev so that the production rates for the pnjl model become larger than those for free quarks .",
    "besides , as proposed in @xcite , the production rates for free quarks are enhanced in the deconfined phase , and the production rates for @xmath71 is dominant at all temperatures . in the pnjl model ,",
    "the enhanced production is also obtained , but the production rates for @xmath72 and @xmath71 cross over at @xmath73  mev .",
    "the production rate for @xmath74 ( @xmath71 ) is dominant when @xmath75 ( @xmath76 ) . because the threshold @xmath77 is well beyond the temperature range in which the chiral phase transition occurs , and our neglect of the contribution from collective ( hadronic ) modes in the transition region near @xmath11 appears justified .",
    "moreover , when @xmath9 , the production rates for the pnjl model are very small because quark and gluon quasiparticles are strongly suppressed below @xmath11 .",
    "in this temperature region , strangeness production is dominated by hadronic reactions , which were investigated by rehberg _",
