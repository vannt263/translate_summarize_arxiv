    "characterizing the molecular gas content of distant galaxies is essential in order to understand the evolution of the cosmic star formation rate density @xcite , and the build  up of stellar mass @xcite throughout cosmic time @xcite . a unique way to fully characterize",
    "the molecular gas content in galaxies in the early universe is through spectral line scans in well  studied cosmological deep fields . in comparison to targeted observations of individual galaxies , spectral scans have the advantage that molecular gas reservoirs can be characterized without pre  selection through other information ( e.g. , stellar mass , star  formation rate ) .",
    "such spectral line scans can also potentially reveal the presence of gas  rich ` dark ' galaxies , i.e. , galaxies that are invisible in the optical wavebands , and that would not be selected as targets to search for molecular gas emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in a sense , spectral line scans follow the spirit of the original _ hst _ deep fields ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as essentially no prior knowledge / selection based on galaxy properties enters the choice of field .",
    "as the main constituent of the molecular gas in galaxies , molecular hydrogen ( h@xmath10 ) , is too weak to be detected , the next most abundant tracer is typically used to measure the molecular gas content : @xmath11co ( hereafter : co ) .",
    "although this molecule is 10@xmath12 times less abundant , the line can be detected in various environments . as a consequence",
    ", this molecule has been used at low and high redshift to measure gas masses and kinematics .",
    "the co line emission is observed in various rotational transitions in galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the rotational ground  state ( j=10 ) of co is at 115.271ghz , and the higher rotational states ( j@xmath01 ) are approximately equally spaced by that frequency .",
    "the amount of high  j emission depends on the _ a priori _ unknown excitation of the molecular gas .",
    "nevertheless , full frequency scans in the lowest frequency alma bands cover co emission at essentially all redshifts ( see fig .  [ fig_z_range ] ) .",

    ", we used the @xmath60mhz and @xmath55mhz sampling for the 3 mm and 1 mm cubes respectively .",

    "we therefore masked a posteriori the line candidates associated with the two brightest 1 mm continuum sources ( see sec .",
    "[ sec_continuum ] and _ paper ii _ ) .",
    "we consider as duplicates line candidates that are offset by less than one synthesized beam ( @xmath65 at 3 mm , @xmath66 at 1 mm ) and that appear in consecutive channels in the floating average .    when assessing the reliability of our line candidates , we need to keep two separate issues in mind ( ` fidelity ' and ` completeness ' , which we discuss in secs .",
    "[ sec_fidelity ] and  [ sec_completeness ] ) .",
    "first , is a given line detection significant ?",
    "this question is harder to address in practice than one would naively think : the s / n of a single detection will be a function of the width of the line , and the noise in the cubes is not gaussian . the best way to address",
    "this question is to perform two independent searches : ( a ) for positive emission ; these candidates would correspond to both real astrophysical sources and noise peaks , ( b ) for negative emission ; these candidates would only correspond to non - astrophysical sources .",
    "these latter sources can be used to define a term that we refer to as _ fidelity _ , i.e. we can statistically subtract the unphysical ` negative ' lines from the physical ` positive ' ones .",
    "we thus assess the degree of fidelity in our line search by running the same search over the positive and negative peaks .",
    "the basic assumption is that , given the interferometric nature of our data set , and that we do not expect to detect absorption features against very high - s / n continuum emission , all the ` negative ' line candidates will be noise peaks , while the ` positive ' line candidates will be a mixture of noise peaks and genuine lines .",
    "the search for negative peaks is performed in the exact same way as the one for positive emission . by comparing the results of these two searches",
    ", we can quantify the fidelity of our search at a given line candidate significance as follows : @xmath67 where @xmath68 and @xmath69 are the number of positive and negative line candidates with a given @xmath70 , respectively .",
    "this definition is such that , if the number of negative candidates at a given @xmath70 is comparable to the number of positive candidates , then the fidelity is null ; if it is negligible , then the fidelity is close to 100% .",
    "for the analysis of our blind search , we request a fidelity level of 60% or higher . this threshold was chosen so that at the lowest accepted significance , more than half of the ` positive ' line candidates are real .",
    "we determine the signal - to - noise ( @xmath70 ) ratio computed by as follows : for each floating - averaged channel , we compute the map rms ( which will constitute the ` noise ' term ) and we take the peak pixel value at the position of a line candidate as ` signal ' .",
    "we emphasize that , since the averaging window is not optimized to match the actual width of a line candidate ( also this approach assumes spatially - unresolved line emission ) , this definition of @xmath70 is by construction conservative .",
    "the @xmath70 values of each line candidate are reported in tab .",
    "[ tab_lines ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig_fidelity ] we show how the fidelity of our line search changes as a function of the line @xmath70 .",
    "it is convenient to have an analytical description of the fidelity dependence on @xmath70 .",

    "this implies that we reach 60 , 80 , and 95% fidelity levels at @xmath70=@xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 at 3 mm , and at @xmath70=@xmath79 , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 at 1 mm .",

    "[ eq_fidelity ] . the number of candidates as a function of @xmath70 is also shown .",
    "we model the fidelity dependence on @xmath70 as an error function ( solid black line ) .",
    "the search reaches 60% fidelity at @xmath82 both at 1 mm and 3 mm , although the latter shows a sharper increase of fidelity with @xmath70 .",
    "we choose a fidelity level of @xmath060% for the sources that enter our analysis , implying that , at the lowest significance , out of a sample of 10 candidates , 6 are likely real , and 4 sources at similar @xmath70 were also detected with negative signal.,title=\"fig : \" ] +      the second question concerns our ability to extract faint sources from our data cubes ( _ completeness _ ) .",
    "we address this by inserting artificial line sources of various strengths and widths in our data cubes , then calculating our ability to recover them in our line search .",
    "this is a standard way of deriving the completeness of sources in the low s / n regime .",
    "we assess the level of _ completeness _ in our blind line search by adding 2500 artificial line sources to the data cube , re  running our line searching algorithm , and comparing the number of recovered sources with the input catalog .",
    "the line candidates are assumed to have a gaussian profile along the spectral axis , and the shape of the synthetic beam in the maps .",
