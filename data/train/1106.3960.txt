    "if a magnetic field @xmath10 is applied slowly , then the classical electron can continuously change from the straight line motion at zero field to the curved motion at a finite @xmath11 ( magnitude ) .",
    "quantum mechanically , the change from the momentum state to the landau state requires a perturbation .",
    "we choose for this perturbation the phonon exchange attraction between the electron and the _ fluxon _ ( elementary magnetic flux ) .",
    "consider an electron with a few fluxons . if the magnetic field is applied slowly , the energy of the electron does not change but the cyclotron motion always acts so as to reduce the magnetic fields surrounding the electron .",
    "hence the total energy of the composite of an electron and fluxon is less than the electron energy plus the unperturbed field energy . in other words ,",
    "the composite ( c-)particle is stable against the break - up , and it is in a bound ( negative energy ) state .",
    "the c - particle is simply a dressed electron carrying @xmath12 fluxons .",
    "originally , the c - particle was introduced as a composite of one electron attached with a number of chern - simons gauge objects .",
    "@xcite these objects are neither bosons nor fermions , and hence the statistics of the composite is not clear .",
    "the basic particle property ( countability ) of the fluxons is known as the flux quantization , see eq .  .",
    "we assume that the fluxon is an elementary fermion with zero mass and zero charge , which is supported by the fact that the fluxon , the quantum of the magnetic field @xmath10 , can not disappear at a sink unlike the bosonic photon , the quantum of the electric field @xmath14 @xcite .",

    "the energy eigenvalues of this system is not obtained by using the perturbation theory but they are obtained by solving the schrdinger equation directly .",
    "this example indicates that a two - body bound state is represented by an infinite set of ladder diagrams and that the binding energy ( the negative of the ground - state energy ) is calculated by a non - perturbative method .",
    "jain introduced the effective magnetic field  @xcite @xmath115 relative to the standard field for the composite ( c-)fermion .",
    "we extend this idea to the bosonic ( odd - denominator ) fraction .",
    "this means that the c - particle moves field - free at the exact fraction .",
    "the movement of the guiding centers ( the cm of the c - particle ) can occur as if they are subjected to no magnetic field at the exact fraction .",

    "the factor 2 arises since there are @xmath75 fc - bosons .",
    "away from @xmath103 , we must add the magnetic field energy @xmath123 , so that @xmath124 when the field is reduced , the system tries to keep the same number @xmath120 by sucking in the flux lines .",
    "thus the magnetic field becomes inhomogeneous outside the sample , generating the extra magnetic field energy @xmath125 .",

    "here the phonon exchange attraction played an important role .",
    "the repulsive coulomb interaction , which is the departure point of the prevalent fermionic theories  @xcite , can not generate a bound state .    in the presence of the supercondensate ,",
    "the non - condensed c - boson has an energy gap @xmath90 .",
    "hence , the non - condensed c - boson density has the activation energy type exponential temperature - dependence : @xmath130 .",
    "\\label{eq : ete_temperature - dependence}\\ ] ] some authors argue that the energy gap @xmath90 for the integer qhe is due to the ll separation = @xmath131 .",
    "but the separation @xmath132 is much greater than the observed @xmath90 . besides , from this view one can not obtain the activation - type energy dependence .",
    "the bec occurs at each ll , and therefore the c - boson density @xmath95 is smaller for high @xmath108 , see eq .  , and",
    "the strengths become weaker as @xmath108 increases .",
    "the most significant advantage of our bosonic theory is that we are able to explain why the plateaus in the hall resistivity is developed when the resistivity is zero as the magnetic field is varied .",
    "this plateau formation is phenomenologically assumed in the fermionic theories .",
    "the experiments by mani _ et al_.  @xcite and zodov _ et al_.  @xcite indicate that the applied radiation excites a large number of `` holes '' in the system . using these `` holes '' and the preexisting `` electrons '' the phonon exchange can pair - create @xmath75 c - bosons , that condense below @xmath16 in the excited ( upper ) channel .",
    "the c - bosons condensed with the momentum along the sample length are responsible for the supercurrent . in the presence of the condensed c - bosons , the non - condensed c - bosons have an energy gap @xmath90 , and therefore they are absent below @xmath16 .",
    "the fermionic currents in the base channel can not be suppressed by the supercurrents since the energy levels are different between the excited and base channels .",
    "these c - fermions contribute a small normal current .",
    "they are subject to the lorentz force : @xmath133 , and hence they generate a hall field @xmath98 proportional to the field @xmath11 .",
    "this is the main feature difference from the usual qhe ( under no radiation ) .    in the neighborhood of the qhe at @xmath103 , the current carriers in the base and excited channels are , respectively , c - fermions and condensed c - bosons .",
    "the currents are additive .",
    "we write down the total current density @xmath134 as the sum of the fermionic current density @xmath135 and the bosonic current density @xmath136 : @xmath137 where @xmath138 and @xmath139 are the drift velocities of the c - fermions and c - bosons .",
    "the hall fields @xmath98 are additive , too .",
    "hence we have @xmath140 the hall effect condition ( @xmath141 ) applies separately for the c - fermions and c - bosons .",
    "we therefore obtain @xmath142 far away from the midpoint of the zero - resistance stretch , the c - bosons are absent and hence the hall resistivity @xmath143 becomes @xmath144 : @xmath145 after the cancellation of @xmath138 . at the midpoint",
    "the c - bosons are dominant .",
    "then , the hall resistivity @xmath143 is approximately equal to @xmath146 since @xmath147 where we used the flux quantization [ @xmath148 , and the fact that the flux density @xmath110 equals the c - boson density @xmath149 at @xmath150 .",
    "the hall resistivity @xmath151 is not exactly equal to @xmath152 since the c - fermion current density @xmath153 is much smaller than the supercurrent density @xmath154 , but it does not vanish . in the horizontal stretch the system is superconducting , and hence the supercurrent dominates the normal current : @xmath155 .",
    "the deviation @xmath156 is , using eq .  , @xmath157 if the field @xmath11 is raised ( or lowered ) a little from the midpoint , @xmath156 is a constant ( @xmath146 ) due to the meissner effect .",
    "if the field is raised high enough , the superconducting state is destroyed and the normal current sets in , generating a finite resistance and a vanishing @xmath156 .",
    "hence the deviation @xmath158 and the diagonal resistance @xmath159 are closely correlated as observed by mani  @xcite .    in fig .  2 of ref .",
    "@xcite ( not shown here ) , we can see that in the range , where the sdh oscillations are observed for the resistance without radiation , the signature of oscillations also appear for the resistance @xmath159 with radiation .",
    "the sdh oscillations arise only for the fermion carriers .",
    "this sdh signature in @xmath159 should remain .",
    "our two - channel model is supported here .",
    "mani _ et al_. , fig .  2 of ref .",
    "@xcite , shows that the strength of the superconducting state does not change much .",
    "the 2d density of states for the conduction electrons associated with the circular fermi surface is independent of the electron energy , and hence the number of the excited electrons is roughly independent of the radiaton energy ( frequency ) .",
    "the `` hole''-like excitations are absent with no radiation .",
    "we suspect that the `` hole''-band edge is a distance @xmath160 away from the system s fermi level .",
    "this means that if the radiation energy @xmath161 is less than @xmath160 , the radiation can generate no superconducting state .",
    "an experimental confirmation is highly desirable here .",
    "if a bias voltage is applied to the system , then a normal current runs in the base channel . in the upper channel the supercurrent still runs with no potential drop . the both currents run in the same sample space .",
    "the apparent discrepancy in the electric potential here may be resolved by considering a static charge @xmath12 developed in the system upon the field application .",
    "that is , the system will be charged and the static potential @xmath162 where @xmath163 is the system s capacitance , can balance the total electric potential while the charging does not affect the supercurrents .",
    "this effect may be checked by experiments , which is a critical test for our two - channel model .    in summary ,",
    "the qhe under radiation is the qhe at the upper channel .",
    "the condensed c - bosons generate a superconducting state with a gap @xmath90 in the c - boson energy spectrum .",
    "the supercondensate suppresses the c - particle currents in the upper channel , but can not suppress the normal currents in the base channel .",
    "thus , there is a finite resistive current accompanied by the hall field .",
    "this explains the @xmath11-linear hall resistivity .",
