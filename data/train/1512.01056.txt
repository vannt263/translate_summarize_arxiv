    "a well - known result of classical particle tracking states that after an electron beam is kicked there is a change in the trajectory of the electron beam , while the orientation of the microbunching front remains as before , see fig [ classical ] .",
    "in other words the kick results in a difference between directions of the electron motion and of the normal to microbunching front @xcite . in xfel simulations",
    "it is generally accepted that coherent radiation from the undulator placed after the kicker is emitted along the normal to the microbunching front @xcite .",
    "the experiment @xcite showed the surprising effect that coherent undulator radiation can be kicked by an angle of about five times the rms radiation divergence practically without suppression .",
    "the maximal kick angle was limited only by the photon beamline aperture .        in a previous paper",
    "@xcite we presented a kinematical description the experiment @xcite and demonstrated that the effect of aberration of light supplies the basis for an understanding of a phenomena like deflection of coherent undulator radiation by a dipole magnet . in order to focus on the ideal mechanism of microbunch tilt influence , in @xcite we restricted our attention to the steady - state theory using the approximation of a continuous electron beam",
    "however , in practical situations the electron beam has a finite pulse duration , and a question arises concerning the region of applicability of results in @xcite .",
    "the present study answers such question , extending the analysis of the tilt influence by taking into account time - dependent effects .",
    "let us first consider a rectangular electron bunch of duration @xmath2 .",
    "the transverse distribution of the electron bunch has a gaussian shape with standard deviation @xmath3 .",
    "we make the assumption that the spatial profile of the bunching factor is close to that of the electron beam and that the modulation of the electron bunch is fully longitudinally and transversely coherent .",
    "self - seeding schemes have been experimentally studied to reduce the bandwidth of xfel pulses up to the fourier limit @xcite .",
    "if the bunch is sufficiently long and the stretch in bunch duration due to the kick is much less that the bunch length , @xmath4 , one can neglect edge effects and use the steady state approach .",
    "using the plots presented in this paper one can give a quantitative answer to the question about the region of applicability of the steady state model in the case of fully coherent modulation .",
    "let us now consider the case of an electron bunch with a modulation induced by the sase process in the undulator upstream of the dipole kick . as a consequence of the start - up from shot noise ,",
    "the longitudinal coherence of the bunch modulation is rather poor .",
    "here we are interested in the impact of the distortion of the microbunching front of the kicked bunch on the performance of the sase x - ray beam splitting setup @xcite , where spatiotemporal distortions affect the degree of transverse coherence value . when describing the physical principles , it is always important to find an analytical description .",
    "in fact , finding analytical solutions is always fruitful for understanding xfel physics and for testing numerical simulation codes .",
    "from this point of view , a sase xfel is a rather complicated object .",
    "it is important to find a model that provides the possibility of an analytical description without loss of essential information about the features of the random process .",
    "one can satisfy this condition by modeling the electron beam by means of a long rectangular bunch and by using a stationary random process for modeling radiation pulses .",
    "an analysis of the sase x - ray pulse quality is given in terms of analytical results .",
    "there is an urgent need to develop electron beam instrumentation allowing for a full measurement of the microbunching structure , including the spatiotemporal coupling of the modulation within the bunch . in order to characterize such modulated electron bunches",
    ", a conventional undulator module does not have enough resolution , and special diagnostic techniques are needed . a method for obtaining a full characterization of the bunch modulation",
    "could be based on the generation of an exact radiation replica of the electron bunch modulation . in our case ,",
    "the synthesizer would simply consist of a short , few period ( @xmath5 ) radiator undulator installed after the kicker . since the undulator is short , longitudinal dynamics in the undulator is purely governed by single - particle effects , where results do",
    "not depends on the presence of other particles .    in the following",
    "we assume that we actually have such a setup so that , after the kicker , the beam enters the short radiator undulator , which is resonant at the beam modulation frequency .",
    "since the beam has a large bunching component , coherent emission is copiously produced : in this paper we study the characteristics of this pulse of radiation .",
    "the energy of the output radiation pulse can be estimated to be in the @xmath6j - level . a realistic measurement of the microbunching heavily relies on the assumption that the beam density modulation does not appreciably change as the beam propagates through the radiator undulator .",
    "this approximation means that only the contributions to the radiation field arising from the initial density modulation are taken into account , and not those arising from the induced bunching .",
    "the effect of betatron motion on the preservation of micro bunching should be accounted for .",
    "in fact , the finite angular divergence of the electron beam , linked with the betatron motion , yields a spread of the longitudinal velocity of the electrons , leading to microbunching suppression .",
    "this factor can be easily estimated and one can conclude that due to the short length of the radiator undulator it does not constitute a serious problem .",
    "the signal produced by the radiator undulator is therefore expected to be an electric field pulse with amplitude @xmath7 .",
    "if no further longitudinal beam dynamics effects are present in the radiator undulator , this field is directly proportional to the microbunching amplitude @xmath8 .",
    "x - ray fel electric field pulses are usually represented with sufficient accuracy as the product of factors separately depending on space and time",
    ". however , when the manipulation of the microbunched electron beam requires the introduction of a kick , such assumption fails .",
    "the direction of the energy flow is always orthogonal to the surface of constant phase , that is to the wavefronts of the corresponding propagating wave .",
    "if one deals with coherent undulator radiation from the kicked microbunched beam , one has to consider , in addition , planes of constant intensity , that is pulse fronts .",
    "fig [ grat1 ] shows a schematic representation of the electric field profile of an undistorted pulse and one with a pulse - front tilt .",
    "let us suppose that the x - ray pulse propagates in the @xmath9 plane , and that the pulse front tilt is also in this plane .",
    "we start by writing the field of an undisturbed pulse as @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the pulse carrier frequency , which is linked to wave vector @xmath12 by @xmath13 .",
    "a distortion of the pulse front does not affect propagation , because the phase fronts remain unaffected .",
    "however for most applications , it is desirable that this fronts be parallel to the phase fronts , and therefore orthogonal to the propagation direction .",
    "a pulse - front tilt can indeed be introduced in the beam due to the propagation of an electron bunch through a kicker , which is our case of interest .",
    "the electric field of a pulse including tilt distortion can be expressed in the space - time domain @xmath14 $ ] as @xmath15 , while the fourier transform from the @xmath14 $ ] domain to the @xmath16 $ ] domain can be expressed as @xmath17 , which is the fourier component of the electric field of a pulse with angular dispersion and @xmath18 .",
    "the tilt angle @xmath19 is given by @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "this equation describes a line in the @xmath9 plane with slope @xmath22 .",
    "the pulse front is the surface where intensity is at a maximum .",

    "we choose the coordinates system so that @xmath25 for the mean @xmath26 and the mean @xmath27 values . in this case",
    ", the slope of the phase fronts is zero . because of this",
    ", the slope of the pulse fronts becomes @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "] one concludes that the pulse - front tilt is invariably accompanied by angular dispersion .",
    "any kick upstream of the radiator undulator , which introduces a bunch profile tilt , also introduces a pulse - front tilt and the output radiation is accompanied by angular dispersion .",
    "we first consider the case of sase radiation .",
    "we perform an analysis on the @xmath9 plane specified by the vertical and longitudinal directions in fig .",
    "[ grat1 ] . upon definition of",
    "we can specify in full generality the spatial correlation function of the electric field between points @xmath30 and @xmath31 at time @xmath32 as    @xmath33    where @xmath34 indicates an average over an ensemble of shots and the subscript @xmath32 is a reminder of the dependence of the correlation function on time . as discussed before ,",
    "when studying this time correlation function , we assume that the statistical process is stationary . though this model is very idealized , making use of it is justified by the fact that in many real cases the radiation pulse is much longer that the coherence length . in other words , partial coherence is an essential feature of sase xfel radiation in the time domain . under the assumption of ergodicity",
    "we can substitute the ensemble average in eq .",

    "it has a very simple functional form .",
    "it is clear from this that the effect of the kick is only significant when @xmath54 .",
    "we give an example of the use of this formula , involving the typical parameters of a soft x - ray fel . in the framework of the accepted model",
    "the input parameter is the standard deviation of the sase radiation spectrum , @xmath43 .",
    "we expect that the typical fwhm of the sase radiation spectrum envelope at saturation , @xmath55 , is of the order of @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the 1d fel parameter @xcite and @xmath11 is the resonance frequency .",
    "therefore , setting @xmath58 gives a good estimate of the rms deviation .",
    "another input parameter is the rms deviation of the transverse gaussian distribution of the radiation field amplitude , @xmath3 . within our model ,",
    "the transverse distribution of the field amplitude at the radiator undulator exit is close to that of the electron beam . for a typical soft x - ray case with @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 ,",
    "the sase radiation can be kicked by an angle of order of a mrad without suppression of transverse coherence .",
    "a useful figure of merit measuring the spatiotemporal coupling can be found in @xcite . considering the angular dispersion this parameter can be written as    @xmath62    where    @xmath63    the range of @xmath64 is in @xmath65 $ ] and readily indicates the severity of these distortions .",
    "thus , in order to estimate the pulse front tilt distortion we can simply calculate the pulse front tilt parameter @xmath64 .",
    "the case @xmath66 corresponds to a pulse free of spatiotemporal distortions , while @xmath67 indicates that some distortions are present .",
    "the @xmath64 parameter is very sensitive to a small amount of dispersion : a value of @xmath68 corresponds to a pulse stretched by only about @xmath69 .",
    "this correlation coefficient is ideal for controlling a setup that should approach the fourier limit .",
