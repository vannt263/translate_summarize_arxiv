    "to improve our understanding of qcd and the hadronization process we must study the properties of both jets and the underlying event in p - p collisions .",
    "the results presented here are from preliminary studies at mid - rapidity of p - p collisions at @xmath0= 200 gev by the star collaboration .",
    "the time projection chamber and barrel electromagnetic calorimeter ( bemc ) are used to measure the charged and neutral particle production respectively .",
    "the data were collected using either a minimum bias trigger or a  jet - patch \" trigger , which required e@xmath18 gev in a @xmath2 = 1@xmath31 patch of the bemc .",
    "the jet - patch trigger creates a neutral energy fragmentation bias for the triggering jet , hence charged particle fragmentation functions are presented only for the di - jet partner .",
    "jets were reconstructed using the fastjet@xcite package s k@xmath4 and anti - k@xmath4 recombination and the siscone jet algorithms .",
    "a cut of @xmath5  or @xmath6 @xmath70.2 gev / c was applied to all particles considered in the event .",
    "the jet energy resolution is of order 15 - 20@xmath8 for jets with @xmath5@xmath7 10 gev / c  @xcite .",
    "the inclusive jet spectrum@xcite and minimum bias @xmath9 and proton spectra@xcite have been measured at rhic and are in good agreement with nlo pqcd calculations over several orders of magnitude .",
    "in addition preliminary fragmentation functions , ff , of charged particles have been measured .",
    "these data are not yet corrected to the particle level .",
    "they are therefore compared to pythia 6.410  @xcite , tuned to the cdf 1.96 tev data ( tune a ) at the detector level .",
    "detector level pythia events have been passed through star s simulation and reconstruction algorithms .",
    "figure  [ fig : ff04 ] shows the results for a resolution parameter r=0.4 for the three jet algorithms .",
    "the solid curves are the predictions from pythia at the detector level .",
    "it can be seen that there is reasonable agreement between the data and pythia .",
    "a similar agreement is observed for r=0.7  @xcite .",
    "this similarity , especially for the larger resolution parameter , suggests that there are only minor nlo contributions beyond those mimicked in the pythia lo calculations at rhic energies .",

    "@xmath111-r , r=0.4 . ]",
    "while the agreement between the data , nlo calculations , and pythia predictions is good for @xmath9 and protons , the theoretical descriptions of strange particle production ( k , @xmath12 and @xmath13 ) significantly under predict the yields at intermediate to high @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "reasonable agreement with the strange baryon data can be produced via pythia if the k factor is increased from k=1 to k=3 , with the effect that the @xmath9 and proton data are no longer reproduced . to investigate strangeness production in p - p collisions",
    "further we examine strange hadron production in jets .",
    "k@xmath14 , @xmath12 and @xmath15 are identified via their distinctive v@xmath16 decay topologies .",
    "good signal - to - noise ratios are obtained via topological cuts and studying only particles with @xmath5@xmath7 1 gev / c .",
    "the residual background under the mass peaks is not yet corrected for .    for r=0.4 .",
    "the strange particle yields are not corrected for tracking efficiency . @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the reconstructed jet and fragment @xmath5 respectively .",
    "the curves show polynomial fits to the pythia detector level predictions . ]",
    "jets containing these identified strange particles are studied .",
    "figure  [ fig : strangeff ] shows the measured detector level ff ; again the curves are from pythia .",
    "the uncertainties are statistical added in quadrature to the small differences obtained by comparing the three different jet finders . as with the minimum bias data , pythia gives an reasonable description of the @xmath19 data but fails for the @xmath12 and @xmath15 .",
    "jetset ( the jet production scheme in pythia ) has also been shown to describe @xmath20 ff from @xmath21 collisions , for @xmath22 gev @xcite .",
    "although the strange baryon predictions from pythia have the correct over - all yields in the range measured , the trend as a function of @xmath23 is incorrect , over predicting at low @xmath23 and under predicting at intermediate @xmath23 .",
    "the integrated @xmath24 and @xmath25 ratios for @xmath26 gev / c as a function of reconstructed jet @xmath27  are consistent with the values obtained from the minimum bias inclusive spectra when the same @xmath5  range is considered@xcite .",
    "these pythia ratios are in agreement with the data .",
    "this suggests that the @xmath12 and @xmath19 spectra for @xmath26 gev / c have a dominant contribution from hard processes , i.e. jet production .",
    "further studies are needed to confirm this speculation .",
    "the detector level ff of _ non - leading _ charged hadrons when the _ leading _ particle is a charged hadron , @xmath12 , or @xmath19 have also been examined@xcite .",
    "the aim is to investigate whether gluon or quark jets can be preferentially selected by tagging on the leading particle species .",
    "measurements by delphi@xcite and theoretical calculations have shown that gluon jet fragmentation produces more hadrons than quark fragmentation at the same jet energy ; mlla calculations give a ratio of 9/4 for gluon / quark jet hadron multiplicities . therefore",
    "if a leading / high @xmath5  baryon is more likely to come from a gluon than a leading / high @xmath5   meson , as is suggested in this paper @xcite , we would expect the number of measured non - leading hadrons in the baryon jet to be greater than in those from meson tagged jets .",
    "however , for a given jet energy we observe that , within errors , the charged particle multiplicities are independent of the leading particle species used to tag the jet@xcite . while this might seem surprising at first , given , for example , the calculations shown in @xcite , the left plot of fig .",
    "[ fig : dssakkue ] illustrates that the ff into baryons , especially from gluons , are not well constrained and thus predictions resulting from their application have large systematic uncertainties .",
    "both dss@xcite and akk08@xcite , used to produce the left plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : dssakkue]@xcite give satisfactory descriptions of the available data .",
    "further studies are therefore needed to ( a ) constrain the gluon ffs and ( b ) determine if jets can be tagged at rhic .",

    "the uncorrected charged particle density in the transmin and transmax regions as a function of reconstructed lead jet @xmath5 , using siscone algorithm , r=0.7 ]    in a p - p collision the underlying event ( ue ) is defined as everything except the hard scattering .",
    "it therefore contains contributions from beam - beam remnants , initial and final state radiation , and soft and semi - hard multiple parton interactions .",
    "pile - up is not part of the definition of the ue .",
    "since this study is performed at mid - rapidity , the contribution from beam - beam remnants is believed to be negligible .",
    "we follow the technique designed by cdf to study the ue@xcite . once the jets have been reconstructed , each event is divided into four sections defined by their azimuthal angle with respect to the leading jet axis ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "the range within @xmath30@xmath1060@xmath16 is the lead jet region and that for @xmath30@xmath7120@xmath16 is the away jet area .",
    "the two sectors with @xmath31@xmath10@xmath30@xmath10120@xmath16 and @xmath32@xmath10@xmath29@xmath10 - 60@xmath16 are the transverse regions .",
    "the transverse sector containing the largest charged particle multiplicity is called the transmax region , and the other is termed the transmin region .",
    "the transmax region has an enhanced probability of containing contributions from the hard initial and final state radiation components . ",
    "leading \" jet events , where at least one jet is found in star s acceptance , and ",
    "back - to - back \" events which are a sub - set of the  leading \" jet collection are examined .",
    "back - to - back \" sub - set of events has two ( and only two ) found jets with @xmath33@xmath70.7 and @xmath34@xmath7150@xmath16 .",
    "this selection suppresses hard initial and final state radiation of the scattered partons .",
    "thus , by comparing the transmax and transmin regions in the  leading \" and  back - to - back \" sets we can extract information about the various components in the ue .",
    "the right plot in figure  [ fig : dssakkue ] shows the measured charged particle density in the ue .",
    "first it is apparent that the ue is largely independent of the jet energy .",
    "second the charged particle densities are the same within errors for the  leading \" and  back - to - back \" datasets .",
    "this again suggests that the hard scattered partons emit very small amounts of large angle initial / final state radiation at rhic energies .",
    "this is very different in 1.96 tev collisions where the  leading\"/back - to - back \" density ratio is @xmath350.65@xcite .",
    "the black lines show the expected density assuming events follow a poisson distribution with an average of 0.36 .",
    "the similarity of this simple simulation to the data suggests that at rhic energies the splitting of the measured transmax and transmin values is predominantly due to the statistical sampling .",
    "pythia again shows satisfactory agreement with the data when tune a is used ( not shown here ) .",
    "in summary , jet fragmentation functions have been measured in p - p collisions at @xmath0= 200 gev for both unidentified charged particles and strange hadrons .",
    "they will provide a stringent baseline for the measurements underway in au - au collisions .",
    "pythia , tuned to 1.96 tev data , shows reasonable agreement to the unidentified particle ff suggesting that the energy dependence of the underlying physics is well modeled .",
    "however the details , such as strange particle production are poorly described .",
    "finally , studies of the ue are underway , and show that it is largely independent of the momentum transfer of hard scattering and receives only minor contributions from initial and final state radiation from these hard scatterings .",
