    "the  weak - value amplification \" has been studied as a promising technique for improving an accuracy of a precision measurement  @xcite .",
    "the concept of the weak value comes from the weak measurement which was proposed by aharonov and his co - workers in 1988  @xcite .",
    "originally , the weak measurement was introduced as an example of the two - state - vector formalism for intuitive understanding of the time irreversibility of a measurement in a quantum system  @xcite , where the  weak \" means the weak coupling between the two quantum systems : the measured system and the measuring probe .",
    "usually , we assume that the interaction hamiltonian is of the von neumann type which gives a displacement of the order of the coupling constant to the probe distribution  @xcite .",
    "an important point of the weak measurement is the postselection of the measured system state after the interaction . by this operation ,",
    "the weak value shows up as the shift of the expectation value of the probe position or momentum",
    ". the weak value can be outside the eigenvalue range of the system observable by choosing the postselected state of the system almost orthogonal to its initial state  @xcite .",
    "we call this effect the weak - value amplification ( wva ) . if we choose an appropriate posteselected state , the shift of the expectation value of probe position or momentum is enhanced larger than the one given by the measurement without postselection which coincides with the coupling constant .",
    "we parenthetically note that for a large coupling constant , the measurement without postselection is sometimes called the strong measurement . therefore , we may hope to extract the information about the coupling constant even if the constant is smaller than a noise .",
    "reference  @xcite introduced the basic concept of the weak value and its application .",
    "it is known that the amplified shift has an upper bound if we take gaussian for the initial probe state  @xcite . especially , when the measured system is a two - state system , some researchers have shown the upper bound analytically without any approximation  @xcite . the initial measuring probe wave function which maximizes the amplification factor",
    "was studied in refs .",
    "the wva was confirmed in several experimental studies . setting two polarizers in front and behind of a birefringent crystal ,",
    "the weak value was measured and found to become large by arranging two polarizers almost orthogonal  @xcite .",
    "hosten and kwiat observed the spin hall effect of light with the wva  @xcite .",
    "et al_. monitored the laser deflection by the small tilting piezo mirror in the sagnac interferometer and measured the angle of the mirror in precision  @xcite .",
    "et al_. demonstrated the velocity measurement of the longitudinal moving mirror in the michelson interferometer  @xcite .",
    "there are theoretical researches about technical utilities of the wva .",
    "et al_. compared the signal and the shot noise in an optical interferometer  @xcite .",
    "et al_. showed that the wva has the error tolerance of the systematic error  @xcite .",
    "lee and tsutsui discussed the causes of the errors in the weak measurement with finite data and the merit of the wva  @xcite .",
    "however , the problem is that the larger the amplification factor is , the smaller the success probability of the postselection .",
    "the small number of detectable events leads to the possible disadvantage of the interaction parameter estimation using the wva as argued in  @xcite , while some researchers have mentioned that the data loss by postselection usually need not to be considered in practical cases  @xcite .    lately",
    ", the interaction detection capability of the wva has been focused on  @xcite . in this problem , using the wva , we want to decide whether the interaction exists or not in an indirect quantum measurement process .",
    "the result of ref .",
    "@xcite suggests that the detection capability of the wva is experimentally utilitarian .",
    "to theoretically study such a problem , the statistical hypothesis testing is a well - known method  @xcite .",
    "the hypothesis testing does not require a large number of data like the estimation , and the accuracy of testing is normally independent of the number of data .",
    "therefore , we note that the hypothesis testing works well for a small number of data given by the weak measurement . in ref .",
    "@xcite , however , the authors claim that the wva is suboptimal for the interaction detection .",
    "their conclusion is based on the discussion of the likelihood - ratio test with some debate  @xcite .",
    "it seems to us , however , we have to pay more attention to the well - known fact that the likelihood - ratio test is not appropriate to the detection of the interaction . more precisely , because the interaction detection problem is a two - side test , a uniformly most powerful unbiased ( umpu ) test is the standard procedure to solve this problem .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a statistical hypothesis testing based on the physical intuition , and analytically evaluate the interaction detection capability of the wva . to determine whether the interaction exists or",
    "not , we give a decision function such as the measurement outcome divided by the initial fluctuation of the measuring probe distribution [ @xmath0 below eq .",
    "( [ eq : sndecision ] ) ] . under this decision function and the particular condition for the weak value , we find that the wva can supersede the ordinary measurement without postselection .",
    "we can say a large weak value increases the detection power .",
    "more precisely , the advantage of the wva is the reducing of the possibility of missing the presence of the interaction with the false alarm rate fixed .",
    "our result is suggestive for the interpretation of the weak value .",
    "some researchers simply take the physical intuition of the wva for granted with the approximation in which the weak value amplifies the shift of the probe wave function . in this work ,",
    "we show without any approximation that the weak value itself determines the superiority or inferiority of each measurement , the weak measurement and the ordinary measurement , in the detection capability .",
    "we emphasize that our result mathematically clarifies the significance of the wva which justifies the physical intuition . throughout this paper , we assume that the initial probe wave function is gaussian and the measured system is a two - state system as considered in refs .",

    "there , we discuss the case that the data would be unobtainable by failure of the postselection . some complicated calculations and the supplementary discussion of the unobtainable case are shown in appendixes .",
    "we use the unit @xmath1 and the subscripts that `` ps '' means the case of the measurement with the postselection , i.e. , the weak measurement and `` nps '' indicates the case of the ordinary measurement , i.e. , the measurement with no postselection .",
    "we recapitulate the standard weak measurement process  @xcite and derive the probability distribution after the measurement .",
    "the weak measurement is described as the indirect quantum measurement formalism . to carry out the weak measurement ,",
    "initially we prepare a measured system @xmath2 and a measuring probe @xmath3 .",
    "( hereafter , we omit the indexes @xmath2 and @xmath3 unless otherwise stated . )",
    "the initial state of the measured system @xmath2 is a preselected state @xmath4 and the initial state of the probe system @xmath3 is @xmath5 , which is taken as the gaussian profile ; @xmath6 where the @xmath7 represents the position of the probe .",
    "we denote @xmath8 for the probe state in a density matrix expression for later convenience .",

    "the interaction produces the state of the combined system as @xmath14 finally , we postselect the measured system state @xmath15 .    here",
    ", we assume that the interaction strength @xmath13 is sufficiently small that the first approximation in @xmath13 is available .",
    "the postselection translates the wave function by @xmath16 , i.e. , @xmath17 where the @xmath18 is called the weak value defined by @xmath19 we can easily see that the weak value has a generally complex value , and becomes infinitely large when the postselected state @xmath20 is almost orthogonal to the initial state @xmath21 . because of the large @xmath18 , we find that the shift of the probe wave function gets large as can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ eq : translate ] ) .",
    "this implies that the coupling constant @xmath13 is effectively amplified .",
    "this effect is called  weak - value amplification \" ( wva )  @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that the postselection is essential in the wva .    for the later discussion ,",
    "we carry out full order calculation of the final probability distribution of the measuring probe concentrating on the two - state system case for the measured system .",

    "the weak value @xmath18 plays an important role in determining the distribution change .",
    "note that the condition @xmath34 makes the two peaks at the same height and that the increases of the imaginary part @xmath38 depresses the dip deeper while increasing the distance of the two peaks .",
    "this may not be very obvious , but is justified by the closer algebraic examination of the expression ( [ eq : fps ] ) . with an appropriate postselection , we can obtain peak shifts larger than the ordinary peak - to - peak distance  @xcite , which is given by the coupling constant times the eigenvalues of the observable as indicated in fig .",

    "a similar discussion goes through for @xmath40 or @xmath27 in the case without postselection .",
    "generally , the statistical hypothesis testing is used for a mathematical decision from the data of measurement  @xcite .",
    "our aim of this paper is the evaluation of the interaction detection capability by the wva in which the size of data is not necessarily large . in the classical theory of statistics ,",
    "the hypothesis testing provides a better solution for such evaluation than the estimation theory as explained below .",
    "the estimation accuracy is usually evaluated by the fisher information .",
    "more precisely , the mean squared error of the estimator approaches the inverse of the fisher information for an infinite number of data .",
    "then , the fisher information gives a good description for the accuracy of the estimation with a large number of data  @xcite . in the weak measurement ,",
    "the failed postselection makes data loss , so that the estimation theory is not a suitable method for analyzing the relative power of the wva when the number of experiments is limited . on the other hand",
    ", the hypothesis testing can be evaluated by the error probability regardless of the number of data .",
    "so , our discussion of the wva based on the hypothesis testing theory works even when we have a small number of data .",
    "the hypothesis testing is a statistical inference to decide which hypothesis is appropriate from the measurement results in the two contradictory hypotheses , the null and the alternative . for the detection problem",
    ", we take the hypotheses as follows : ( a ) the null hypothesis @xmath41 : absence of the interaction ( i.e. , @xmath42 ) , ( b ) the alternative hypothesis @xmath43 : presence of the interaction ( i.e. , @xmath44 ) .",
    "this hypothesis testing problem is a two - side test in the sense that the estimated parameter deviates in either direction ( @xmath45 , @xmath46 ) from the null hypothesis ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "we derive a decision function which takes the binary value as @xmath47 or @xmath48 .",

    "a set of the outside of the acceptance region is called the rejection region . when the measurement result is within this region ,",
    "the null hypothesis is rejected .",
    "since the decision function @xmath50 is independent of the coupling parameter @xmath13 , sometimes we get the wrong indications from the decision function .",
    "such wrong indications are classified to the two types , ( i ) the type-1 error : even if the null hypothesis is true , we wrongly reject it , ( ii ) the type-2 error : even if the null hypothesis is false , we wrongly accept it as truth . in our case , the type-1 error represents  there is no interaction but we wrongly guess the interaction exists , i.e. , falsely alarmed . \"",

    "the probability of the type-2 error is calculated as the integration of the probability distribution function over the acceptance region of the null hypothesis when the alternative hypothesis is true .",
    "the smaller probabilities of these errors become , the better the testing is . since it is difficult to make the two types of error small simultaneously",
    ", we make the probability of the type-2 error as small as possible while suppressing the probability of the type-1 error under a certain significance level as the general strategy  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we compare the weak measurement and the measurement without postselection by evaluating the probabilities of the two types of error for each measurement .",
    "to carry out the test with the small probabilities of the errors , an adequate decision function is necessary .",
    "the uniformly most powerful ( ump ) test is one of the good testings in the general strategy  @xcite .",
    "the neyman - pearson lemma is a famous example for explaining the ump test  @xcite",

    "in addition to this problem , the ump test does not exist in the two - side test .",
    "therefore , the likelihood - ratio test is secondary .    to find an adequate decision function in the two - side test",
