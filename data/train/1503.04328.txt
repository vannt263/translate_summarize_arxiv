    "the cosmic ray detectors of casa - mia @xcite , tunka @xcite , gamma @xcite and kascade - grande @xcite have measured the cosmic ray flux from the knee region at around @xmath0 ev which mostly contains iron nuclei .",
    "this is known as the  iron knee \" . beyond the knee",
    "there is a change in the composition of the cosmic rays from heavy to light nuclei .",
    "the radiation field produced from the stars is most intense near the galactic center region where the density of the stars is the highest and gradually decreases with the distance @xcite from this region .",
    "the cosmic rays emitted from the galactic and extragalactic sources interact with the interstellar radiation and matter during their propagation through the interstellar medium .",
    "secondary neutrinos and gamma rays are produced from their interactions @xcite .",
    "the pure hadronic interactions have negligible contribution to the observed neutrino events in the icecube detector @xcite .",
    "the photo - disintegration of cosmic ray heavy nuclei has been studied earlier analytically @xcite and with monte carlo simulations @xcite .",
    "more recently it has been suggested that the antineutrinos produced in the photo - disintegration @xcite of some very high injected flux of ultrahigh energy cosmic rays ( uhecrs ) may explain the flux observed by the icecube neutrino detector . in photo - disintegration protons and neutrons",
    "are produced almost equally .",
    "the neutrons decay to protons and antineutrinos . in this paper",
    "it has been assumed that 1 to 10@xmath1 of the high energy protons produced in the decay of the high energy neutrons reach us due to magnetic shielding and their flux is the same as the observed cosmic ray proton flux in the energy range of @xmath2 to @xmath3 gev .",
    "parametrizations of the all particle cosmic ray spectrum are given in @xcite for the following three population models ( i ) hillas model ( ii ) global fit model .",
    "we have used their parametrizations of the diffuse cosmic ray flux to calculate the antineutrino flux produced in the photo - disintegration of cosmic ray heavy nuclei . according to the hillas model the galactic cosmic ray spectrum ends at the knee which mostly originates from supernova remnants .",
    "the contribution to the diffuse cosmic ray flux from the extragalactic sources is significant at the ankle .",
    "this scenario is based on the amplification of the magnetic fields in non - linear diffusive shock accelerations which determines the maximum energy of the cosmic rays produced in galactic snrs . in this model",
    "at least three populations of particles are needed to explain the observed cosmic ray flux .",
    "many more populations may be introduced to explain the cosmic ray spectrum in much more detail . in the global fit model",
    "the fluxes of the individual cosmic ray nuclei measured by the cream experiment @xcite are well explained .",
    "this model is also consistent with the `` iron knee '' observed by the kascade - grande at @xmath0 ev @xcite . in each population",

    "another important aspect is the higher energy populations can significantly contribute to the cosmic ray flux at lower energy . for more details on these models",
