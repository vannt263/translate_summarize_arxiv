    "two hypotheses are available on the carrier of information in the brain .",
    "one , the rate coding hypothesis , states that information is represented by the density of spikes . the other ,",
    "the temporal coding hypothesis , states that information is represented by the timing of neuronal firings , that is , the synchronization of oscillatory neural activities .",
    "visual information is divided into a number of features , e.g. , color , form , motion , and so on , which are processed in parallel in different areas of the brain .",
    "von der malsburg @xcite has emphasized the necessity of temporal coding to bind these features , and have called into question conventional models based on rate coding .",
    "it should be noted that some physiological phenomena @xcite have supported his discussion .",
    "therefore , this discussion may also increase interest in temporal coding .",
    "one merit of temporal coding is that the information processing ( e.g. , optimization  minimization of an energy function ) achieved by temporal coding neurons ( i.e. , coincidence detectors ) is faster than that achieved by rate coding neurons ( i.e. , integrators ) @xcite .",
    "recently , therefore , the oscillator neural network has been attracting the attention of a growing number of researchers .    in this paper",
    ", we discuss a class of oscillator neural networks that store two - value memory patterns into synchronously oscillating states .",
    "this class of oscillator neural networks is difficult to study analytically , and therefore was not discussed in previous works @xcite . to overcome the difficulty",
    ", we employ a powerful method @xcite that can be applied to various networks , and derive the memory capacity .",
    "our model is more biologically relevant than previous models @xcite , since it is based on a real number synapse which is specified by a standard hebb learning rule .    in previous analyses @xcite and our analysis , a coupling function of a phase equation",
    "was approximately assumed as the sine function for mathematical tractability . in a large population of uniformly coupled oscillators with scattered natural frequencies ( which corresponds to ferromagnetic models ) ,",
    "the behavior of the system is invariant to the shape of the coupling function , that is , the critical variance of the natural frequency causing a phase transition is only dependent on the lowest frequency components of the coupling function @xcite .",
    "however , the former analyses do not support our analysis , since properties of the cross - talk noise in our system are different from those of scattered natural frequencies which break the mutual entrainment .    in this parer , in order to verify effects of the shape of the coupling function on the performance of a network , we estimate the memory capacity of more realistic models . in addition , we numerically show that , in the case of an associative memory ( on the basis of an oscillator network ) , gaps in the coupling function between in - phase and anti - phase improve the performance .",
    "in general , when the coupling is sufficiently weak , the high - dimensional dynamics of a coupled oscillator system can be reduced to the following phase equation @xcite , @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the total number of oscillators , @xmath3 is the phase of the @xmath4th oscillator and @xmath5 denotes a synaptic weight .",
    "@xmath6 is a periodic function .",
    "figures [ phase](a)(b ) show examples of @xmath6 values ( sine - like - curves ) obtained by the numerical calculation of weakly - coupled bvp ( bonhoeffer - van der pol ) oscillators .    for mathematical tractability , we approximately assume @xmath7 .",
    "then , eq . [ eq2:cupr ] is expressed as , @xmath8 in cook s model ( a q - state clock model with q@xmath9 ) @xcite , @xmath5 is a complex number synapse specified by a generalized hebb learning rule @xcite , which can not be easily achieved in biological implementation .",
    "cook s model can be regarded as an extension of hopfield networks to `` multi - states '' . here , @xmath5 is specified by the following learning rule , @xmath10 where @xmath11 are phase patterns to be stored in the network , and are randomly assigned to @xmath12 or @xmath13 with a probability of @xmath14 .",
    "we define a parameter @xmath15 ( loading rate ) such that @xmath16 .",
    "this learning rule is equivalent to a standard hebb learning rule like in the hopfield model @xcite , which can be easily achieved in biological implementation : @xmath5 increases between simultaneously firing cells ; otherwise , @xmath5 decreases .",
    "in area ca1 of the hippocampus , stimulation on the in - phase of the hippocampal theta rhythm includes a long - term potentiation that can be depontentiated by stimulation on the anti - phase of the theta rhythm @xcite .",
    "thus , oscillator network models with the standard hebb learning are simple and biologically plausible , yet have to be analyzed mathematically @xcite .",
    "the system ( [ eq2:cupa ] ) has the following potential @xmath17 : @xmath18 this potential ( [ eq2:poten ] ) is invariant under the transformation @xmath19 with any @xmath20 .",
    "in other words , the equilibrium solution is irresistant to a uniform shift of @xmath3 ( the neutral stability ) .",
    "hence , the relative phase informations , i.e. , the in - phase and anti - phase , can be embedded in the network .    here , we study the equilibrium properties of system ( [ eq2:cupa ] ) when @xmath21 with fixed @xmath16 , by using self - consistent signal - to - noise analysis ( scsna ) @xcite which is based on the s / n analysis to explain the equilibrium properties .",
    "the results of applying scsna to the hopfield model @xcite and cook s model @xcite coincide with those of the replica theory @xcite .",
    "scsna is a powerful method , since we can easily study the equilibrium properties of analog - neuron networks without considering the potential , for example , analogue neural networks with asymmetric connections @xcite .    defining the order parameters @xmath22 and @xmath23 ( overlap ) in a large @xmath2 limit as ,",
