    "-0.15 in since the early realization of sub - micron atom lithography @xcite , the subject of focusing neutral atoms by use of light fields continues to attract a great deal of attention .",
    "the basic principle of atom lithography relies on the possibility of concentrating the atomic flux in space utilizing a spatially modulated atom - light interaction . in the conventional atom - lithographic schemes ,",
    "a standing wave ( sw ) of light is used as a mask on atoms to concentrate the atomic flux periodically and create desired patterns at the nanometer scale @xcite .",
    "the technique has been applied to many atomic - species in one as well as two - dimensional @xcite pattern formations .",
    "there are two ways to focus a parallel beam of atoms by light masks in close correspondence with conventional optics . in the thin - lens approach ,",
    "atoms are focused outside the region of light field which happens for low intensity light beams . on the other hand ,",
    "the atoms can be focused within the light beam when its intensity is high .",
    "this is known as thick - lens regime and is very similar to the graded - index lens of traditional optics .",
    "the laser focusing of atoms depends on parameters such as thickness of light beam , velocity spread of atoms , detuning of laser frequency from the atomic transition frequencies , etc , .",
    "experimentally , atomic nanostructures have been reported with sodium , chromium , aluminium @xcite , cesium @xcite , ytterbium @xcite , and iron @xcite atoms .",
    "most of the theoretical studies on atom lithography employ a particle optics approach to laser focusing of atoms .",
    "the classical trajectories of atoms in the potentials induced by light fields suffice to study the focal properties of light lens . in the case of direct laser - guided atom deposition ,",
    "the diffraction resolution limit will be ultimately determined by the de broglie wavelength of atoms , and may reach several picometers for typical atomic beams @xcite . in practice , however , this limit has never been relevant because of the surface diffusion process , the quality of the atomic beam , and severe aberrations due to anharmonicity of the sinusoidal dipole potential . as a result ,",
    "all current atom lithography schemes suffer from a considerable background in the deposited structures . a possible way to overcome the aberration problem was suggested in @xcite , by using nanofabricated mechanical masks that block atoms passing far from the minima of the dipole potential .",
    "however , this complicates considerably the setup and reduces the deposition rate .",
    "therefore , there is a considerable need in a pure atom optics solution for the enhanced focusing of an atomic beam having a significant angular spread .    in paraxial approximation , the steady - state propagation of an atomic beam through a standing light wave is closely connected to the problem of the time - dependent lateral motion of atoms subject to a spatially periodic potential of an optical lattice . from this point of view ,",
    "enhanced focusing of the atomic beam can be considered as a squeezing process on atoms in the optical lattice . in recent work @xcite , novel squeezing technique",
    "has been introduced for atoms in a pulsed optical lattice .",
    "the approach considered a time modulation of the sw with a series of short laser pulses . based on specially designed aperiodic sequence of pulses",
    ", it has been shown that atoms can be squeezed to the minima of the light - induced potential with reduced background level .",
    "_ @xcite have verified this proposal experimentally using cs atoms in an optical lattice . in refs . , the atoms were loaded into the optical lattice and the dynamics of atoms along the direction of sw was studied as a time - dependent problem .",
    "the aim of the present work is to extend the focusing scenario of ref .",
    "@xcite to the beam configuration employed for atomic nanofabrication .",
    "we generalize the results on atomic squeezing in the pulsed sw to a system involving the atomic - beam traversing several layers of light masks .",
    "in particular , we will investigate prospects for reducing spherical and chromatic aberrations in atom focusing with double - layer light masks .",
    "high - resolution deposition of chromium atoms will be considered as an example .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , the basic framework of the problem is defined and the linear focusing of atoms by a double - layer light mask is studied using the particle optics approach in paraxial approximation . in sec .",
    "iii , we examine the optimal squeezing scheme of @xcite in application to the atomic - beam traversing two layers of light masks . the effects of beam collimation and chromatic aberrations are considered in sec .",
    ", we optimize the double lens performance and give parameters for the minimum spot - size in the atom deposition . finally , in sec .",

    "et al . _ .",
    "the light acts like an array of cylindrical lenses for the incident atomic beam , focusing the atoms into a grating on the substrate . however ,",
    "because of the non - parabolic nature of the light - induced potential , the focusing of atoms is subject to spherical aberrations giving a finite width to the deposited features @xcite .",
    "a doublet of light masks made from two standing light waves may , in principle , reduce the focusing imperfections due to a clear physical mechanism . in this configuration , the first sw prefocuses the atoms towards the minima of the sinusoidal potential .",
    "when the pre - focused atoms cross the second sw , they see closely the parabolic part of the potential which should result in a reduction of the over - all spherical aberrations .",
    "to test this scheme , we consider the propagation of an atomic - beam through a combination of two sws formed by counter - propagating laser beams .",
    "the two sws are identical except for their intensities and are assumed to be formed along the x - direction .",
    "atoms are described as two - level systems with transition frequency @xmath0 .",
    "we take the direction of propagation of atoms through the sw fields along the z - direction .",
    "if the atoms move sufficiently slow ( adiabatic conditions ) through the light fields , the internal variables of atoms maintain a steady state during propagation @xcite . in this approximation ,",
    "the atoms can be described as point - like particles moving under the influence of an average dipole - force .",

    "we have considered the intensities of light sws to be equal in the case of double light masks . for the other variables ,",

    "however , even for a single sw , the best squeezing of atoms ( maximal spatial compression ) is achieved not at the focal plane , but after the linear focusing phenomenon takes place . to characterize the spatial localization of atoms we use a convenient figure of merit , the localization factor @xcite : @xmath34~ , \\label{local}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 is the solution of the differential equations ( @xmath29 ) satisfying the initial condition @xmath36 at @xmath37 .",
