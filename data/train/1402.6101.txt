    "in the cold dark matter paradigm , dark matter halos play critical roles in hosting the formation of luminous objects and shaping the observable universe .",

    "numerical simulations reveal an approximately universal behavior of the density profile with @xmath6 at the inner part and @xmath7 at the outer part of halos .",
    "different fitting models for the density profile have been proposed , such as navarro ",

    "the profile proposed by @xcite , namely , the nfw profile , has been widely adopted to describe the density distribution .",

    "the lensing induced shape distortion for a background source is given by the two eigen values of the jacobian matrix . specifically , the source ellipticity is defined as @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the two axial lengths of the source image obtained from the quadrupole moment of the light distribution . the observed ellipticity",

    "can be obtained by averaging over the observed @xmath63 .",
    "then the cluster mass distribution can be analyzed either through parametric modeling or no - parametric studies .    in our analyses , we study the density profile of the simulated weak - lensing clusters , assuming it follows the nfw profile .",
    "we are mainly interested in the radial profiles of clusters and thus use the reduced tangential shears with respect to their chosen centers as our basic quantities .",

    "we can also reconstruct the lensing convergence field @xmath67 iteratively from @xmath61 according to the relation between @xmath68 and @xmath67 .    in our studies , the dark matter halo catalog is built on the _ millennium simulation _",

    "the cosmological parameters are @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 .",
    "we extract halos from the snapshot of @xmath78 using the friends - of - friends ( fof ; @xcite ) algorithm with linking parameter , @xmath79 and choose the position of the most bound particle as the true halo center for each halo .    for weak - lensing studies ,",
    "we assume that all of the halos are located at @xmath80 as a default , the typical redshift of the weak - lensing observed clusters for source galaxies at @xmath81 .",
    "because halo structures evolve little from @xmath80 to @xmath78 , using @xmath78 halos and putting them artificially at @xmath80 should not lead to significantly different results from using halos extracted directly from the snapshot at @xmath80 of the simulation .",

    "for high - mass halos , we generate @xmath94 different projected maps along @xmath94 different los directions for each halo .",
    "we then have @xmath89 lensing maps for low - mass halos and @xmath95 maps for high - mass halos .",
    "it is noted that the @xmath94 projections for high - mass halos are only used in statistically analyzing the center offsets . for the later studies of the @xmath0@xmath1 relation , we use one los projection for each halo , low or high mass , in order to faithfully preserve the mass function of dark matter halos . for the @xmath49 calculation",

    "therefore , the boundary effects on the @xmath106 calculation from @xmath67 using fourier transformation should be limited .",
    "similar to @xcite , we take into account the magnification effect in populating background galaxies by    @xmath108    where @xmath109 $ ] is the lensing magnification , and @xmath110 and @xmath111 are the lensed and unlensed galaxy number densities , respectively @xcite .",
    "thus to generate background galaxies , we first populate them randomly in the fov of @xmath104 with a given number density significantly higher than the desired one .",
    "then , for each galaxy , a probability @xmath112 from 0 to 1 is randomly given .",
    "only those galaxies with @xmath113 at their positions are kept .",
    "this way , we get a background galaxy catalog with their surface number density modulated by the lensing magnification effect , @xmath114 . from this , galaxies are further selected randomly to get the final galaxy catalog with the desired average number density of @xmath115 .",
    "we then assign each galaxy an intrinsic ellipticity , @xmath59 , following the probability distribution with random phases and @xmath116    @xmath117},\\ ] ]    where @xmath118 is the standard deviation of the total @xmath59 .",
    "the ` observed ' ellipticity for each galaxy is then obtained by equation ( [ eq : eps ] ) , where the lensing signal at the galaxy position is calculated from the grid values using a cubic convolution algorithm @xcite .",

    "this corresponds to @xmath123 in our notation , which is smaller than our default case with @xmath121 .    in order to systematically study the noise effects on the weak - lensing - derived @xmath0@xmath1 relation",
    ", we also generate large source galaxy samples with @xmath124 for each considered halo . to cover a wide range of noise levels ,",
    "we consider different @xmath118 with @xmath125 .",

    ", the range of @xmath118 considered here is a little stretched .",
    "it is also noted that , as we show later , given a smoothing kernel , the noise effect is largely characterized by @xmath127 , the dispersion of the mean signal per unit area .",
    "thus , there are some redundancies in our analyses for different combinations of @xmath128 .",
    "it should also be pointed out that , from an observational point of view , the values of @xmath118 and @xmath119 are usually correlated .",
    "good observational conditions result in smaller @xmath118 and larger @xmath119 , and vice versa .",
    "therefore , it is emphasized again that our analyses here combining different @xmath128 are solely for systematically demonstrating different noise levels but not for showing the combinations in real observations . on the other hand",
    ", the wide range of @xmath129 in our analyses indeed covers the noise levels from different observations . for comparison ,",
    "we also generate two noiseless catalogs with @xmath120 and an unrealistic @xmath130 , assuming no intrinsic ellipticities for background galaxies .    for testing the generality of our methods to locate the center , and making comparisons with the observational result of og12",
    ", we also generate a mock sample by placing the above selected @xmath131 halos at @xmath132 , with one los for each halo .",
    "we use @xmath133 and @xmath17 to define @xmath82 and @xmath84 .",
    "the fov is taken to be @xmath134 by default . in this case , the source redshift is set to be @xmath135 , in accord with that in og12 .",
    "to constrain the density profile of a dark matter halo with weak - lensing analyses , it is important to first identify the center of the halo . here , we explore different center identification methods based on the weak - lensing ` data ' alone and further quantify statistically their corresponding center offsets , @xmath136 , with respect to the true centers of the halos .",
    "we also describe the procedures for the nfw profile fitting from the reduced tangential shear signals .",
    "as described in the previous section , we construct mock weak - lensing data for each of the halos in the catalog .",
    "the data contains the positions and ` observed ' ellipticities for the background galaxies .",
    "they are named as shear maps . in total , for a given set of @xmath119 and @xmath118 , we have @xmath89 shear maps for the low - mass halos using one random los direction for each halo and @xmath95 maps for the @xmath90 high - mass halos with @xmath94 different los for each halo .",
    "we first explore the center identification using the @xmath137-statistic method @xcite .",
    "the @xmath137 value at @xmath138 is defined as    @xmath139    where @xmath140 is the tangential component of @xmath141 of the galaxy at @xmath142 ( see eq.([eq : ts ] ) ) , @xmath143 and @xmath144 with @xmath145 and @xmath146 .",
    "the filter function , q , is approximated to optimize the tangential shear profile corresponding to an nfw density profile . at each @xmath138 , we vary @xmath147 to find the best value to maximize @xmath137 . this maximized @xmath137 is taken to the @xmath137 value at @xmath138 .",
    "it can be seen that the best @xmath147 can be different at different @xmath138 . with the @xmath137 field over the whole map , the position with the highest @xmath137 value",
    "is then chosen as the center of the halo .",
    "specifically , for each shear map , we first divide it into @xmath148 regular grids , and calculate @xmath137 on each of the grid points .",
    "we then locate the position of the highest @xmath137 value among the @xmath148 grids . around this peak position",
    ", we consider a smaller region with a size of two grids along each direction and further divide it into @xmath148 finer grids .",
    "the same analysis as the last step is done to find the highest peak on the finer grids . around this new peak position",
    ", we perform the analyses another time with even finer grids to find the final highest shear peak ( sp ) .",

    "if the use of grids in our searching method can affect the center finding , we also run the nongrid method of levenberg ",
    "marquardt @xcite .",
    "we find that , for the case without noise from intrinsic ellipticities of source galaxies , the results of identified centers are nearly the same as those of our grid - based search , for both low- and high - mass halos . with the noise included ,",
    "the results from the two searching methods are also largely consistent with each other for high - mass halos . however , for low - mass halos",

    "marquardt identified centers and the true ones are rather large .",
    "we therefore use the grid - based searching method in our center finding analyses both from shear maps here and from convergence maps discussed in section 3.2 .",
    "while lensing shear signals can be extracted directly from observations , the convergence @xmath67 field represents the project mass distribution of a halo , and therefore can be used in a more visually clear way to identify the center of the halo .",

    "the number of grids is @xmath162 .",
    "we first identify the grid point with the highest @xmath67 value , excluding regions less than @xmath3 to the boundary of each side to eliminate the boundary effects .",
    "we denote this grid point as @xmath163 .",
    "we then consider a squared region of @xmath164 around @xmath163 and reconstruct the @xmath67 field within this small region from the reduced shear field over the full fov on finer grids of @xmath165 . within a squared region of @xmath166 around @xmath163 ,",
    "we search for the grid point corresponding to the highest @xmath67 value on the finer grids , which is finally identified as the center of the map .",

    "the lensing - derived mass is lower than @xmath222 by @xmath265 , and the concentration parameter is lower than @xmath266 by about @xmath235 . it is noted that , for low - mass halos , the intrinsic mass distribution of dark matter halos is relatively simple and regular without significant large substructures . for high - mass halos , however , the situation is somewhat complicated because their intrinsic irregularities are relatively high . while the center offset for low - mass halos",
    "is largely induced by noise , the identified center can correspond to true subclumps for high - mass halos ( e.g. , see the different identified centers in the middle left panel of figure [ fig : cenfinder ] ) .",
    "those subclumps appear more centrally concentrated along specific los than their host halos and therefore become the highest peaks in either shear maps or convergence maps .",
    "so , the concentration derived by fitting the signal around those subclumps may be even higher .",

    "that is because for these halos , the large offsets are usually associated with high - noise peaks .",
    "when fitting the signals , including noise , to the nfw profile around these false peaks , the chance alignments of intrinsic ellipticities leading to the false peaks contribute to the inferred mass with a high concentration .",
    "the median mass and concentration derived from fitting the nfw profile to the corresponding pure noise around the peaks are shown by gray lines in figure [ fig : q_cm ] .",
    "they are normalized by @xmath1 and @xmath0 for the default case using the true centers .",
    "it is seen that , for low - mass halos , the noise near the false centers indeed has significant effects on @xmath1 and @xmath0 , compensating for the impacts of large center offsets . for high - mass halos ,",
    "the noise effects are relatively weak , and the compensating effects are less significant than that for low - mass halos .     +      the @xmath0@xmath1 relation analyses discussed in this paper concern a sample of , but not a single , weak - lensing - studied cluster .",

    "the result is presented in the fourth row of figure [ fig : eobs28 ] . the slope @xmath24 from monte carlo analyses is slightly flatter but the normalization is almost unchanged .",
    "the last row presents the results with @xmath436 . with the selection of this larger einstein radius , the agreement between the simulation results and that of og12 improves further but",
    "the differences are still seen and @xmath289 is higher in og12 .    it is noted that in both ok10 and og12 , they discuss whether the steeper @xmath24 can be attributed to the known degeneracy between @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "they randomly sample @xmath270 in the region corresponding to the posterior distributions of weak - lensing - determined @xmath0 and @xmath1 for each cluster and then perform a simple @xmath5 fitting to the resampled data to derive the @xmath0@xmath1 relation .",
    "they conclude that the effects are not significant .",
    "it should be noted however , that the posterior distributions are around the best - fit values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , which can already be deviated from the reference @xmath270 ( see figure [ fig : cm1556 ] ) .",
    "therefore , such resampling can not fully reveal the noise effects if the simple @xmath5 fitting is done for analyzing the @xmath0@xmath1 relation . in ok10",
    ", they also perform monte carlo analyses based on an artificial cluster sample without intrinsic correlations between @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "they find @xmath440 from monte carlo weak - lensing analysis with noise . for our cluster samples ,",
    "the underlying @xmath0@xmath1 relation for dark matter halos has @xmath22 .",
    "thus , the increase of median @xmath292 due to noise ( the middle panel of the second row of figure [ fig : eobs19 ] ) is @xmath441 , consistent with the result of ok10 .",
    "although the bias of @xmath24 is small for the noise level considered here , the scatter is significantly increased by the noise .    in summary ,",
    "our monte carlo analyses show that by including a proper mass selection function @xmath336 , the observational result of ok10 is , within @xmath416 range , consistent with the simulation results based on the ms cluster sample , and the apparently steep slope @xmath24 for the @xmath0@xmath1 relation can be largely explained by the noise effects and the sample variance . for og12 , the noise effects can account for the steep @xmath24 but the amplitude @xmath289 of the derived @xmath0@xmath1 relation is considerably higher than that of simulations .",
    "the probability of finding og12 s result is somewhat low even for a selection function with a quite large einstein radius .",
    "+     +     +",
    "based on the halo catalog from the _ millennium simulation _ , we generate mock weak - lensing data for @xmath442 clusters and systematically investigate the effects of different center finding methods and the noise on the weak - lensing - derived @xmath0@xmath1 relation .",
    "four different methods of center identification using weak - lensing data alone are explored . in agreement with other studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we find that both the shape noise and the smoothing can lead to misidentifications of centers . for high - mass halos , their intrinsically irregular mass distribution can also considerably affect the center identifications .",
    "in general , the performance of a center identification method in a weak - lensing regime mainly depends on the @xmath443 . for intermediate redshift clusters ,",
    "the quantity @xmath444 can be used as an indicator to estimate the efficiency of weak - lensing center identification methods . among different methods , our newly proposed two - scale smoothing method , 2k05k , performs the best .",
    "our simulation analyses show that for @xmath445 , at least @xmath248 of the identified centers by 2k05k have offsets to the true centers being less than @xmath4 , demonstrating its great potential in weak - lensing cluster studies .    for nfw profile constraints ,",
    "consistent with other studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we notice that the center offset alone can lead to a large negative bias to the fitted mass and concentration parameter if it is larger than @xmath4 . on the other hand , unlike studies in which centers are defined independent of weak - lensing data , we identify centers from weak - lensing analyses .",
    "therefore , the located centers do have high apparent weak - lensing signals , either associated with real subclumps for massive halos or due to the chance alignments of source galaxies leading to high false peaks for relatively low - mass halos . consequently , with these contributions , the net biases on the mass and concentration parameter are actually smaller than that from the pure effect of center offset without including these additional signals .",
    "concentrating on statistically analyzing the @xmath0@xmath1 relation from a sample of weak - lensing studied clusters , each with an nfw fitted @xmath212 , we find that for our default case with @xmath207 and @xmath121 , using centers identified by 2k05k gives rise to almost the same result on the @xmath0@xmath1 relation as that using the true centers in the nfw profile fitting .",
    "again , this shows the feasibility of finding centers in weak - lensing cluster analyses .    regarding the shape noise effects , our systematic analyses , assuming different noise levels ,",
    "reveal that they can significantly affect the apparent @xmath0@xmath1 relation from weak - lensing studies .",
    "if the simple @xmath5 fitting method is adopted in deriving the @xmath0@xmath1 relation from a sample of weak - lensing analyzed clusters , we generally obtain a steeper slope parameter @xmath24 , in line with a number of observational studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* og12 , ok10 ) .",
    "this is mainly due to the scatter associated with the weak - lensing determined @xmath212 and their covariance , which are not properly accounted for in the simple @xmath5 fitting .    for the stacking analyses based on the weak - lensing - derived mass ,",
    "similar problems exist ; thus similar noise effects occur and lead to a steeper @xmath0@xmath1 relation than the true one . on the other hand ,",
    "if the stacking is based on true mass , the derived @xmath0@xmath1 relation shows no significant bias with respect to the true @xmath0@xmath1 relation .",
    "observationally , we do not directly know the true mass of halos . however , if we have other weak - lensing independent observables that strongly correlate with the underlying true mass of halos , they can be used to group clusters for stacking .",
    "we then expect no significant bias in the derived @xmath0@xmath1 relation .",
    "for that , the galaxy - galaxy lensing technique can be advantageous for either the luminosity or the stellar mass of foreground galaxies , which are often used to form bins for stacking analyses ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "they are shown to be good tracers of their host halo mass @xcite .",
    "the galaxy - galaxy lensing analyses of @xcite indeed give rise to a @xmath0@xmath1 relation that is rather consistent with the 3d result with a slope of @xmath22 .    on the other hand , concerning weak - lensing analyses alone , and the apparent steep @xmath0@xmath1 relation seen from the simple @xmath5 fitting , we further develop a bayesian method in probing the @xmath0@xmath1 relation , taking into account @xmath212 scatter and covariance .",
    "the sample selection effect is also considered by invoking a lower mass limit for a mass selected sample . in principle",
    ", more complicated selection functions suitable for different samples can be incorporated into the bayesian method .",
    "our results show that with the bayesian method , we can extract the underlying @xmath0@xmath1 relation of dark matter halos faithfully from the apparently noise - affected data for a wide range of noise levels .",
    "having finished our analyses , we note a recent study by @xcite .",
    "they perform constraints on the @xmath0@xmath1 relation by combining the information of einstein radius and optical richness for @xmath446 group and cluster - scale objects also using a bayesian approach .",
    "they also point out that the steep slope found by some previous studies is likely due to the degeneracy between concentration and mass .    to account for the sample variance of samples containing a limited number of clusters , we conduct monte carlo analyses with respect to the samples of ok10 and og12 .",
    "we find that the noise effects significantly contribute to the apparently steep @xmath24 in the @xmath0@xmath1 relation obtained by ok10 and by og12 .",
    "our bayesian analyses show that if a lower mass limit @xmath447 is adopted , the ok10 result is reasonably consistent with that of the ms clusters within @xmath416 range . for og12 , while the slope @xmath24 is consistent with that of ms clusters including the noise effects , the amplitude parameter @xmath289 in the @xmath0@xmath1 relation is higher from og12 , even with the strong - lensing bias taken into consideration .",
    "it is noted that ms is a dark matter - only simulation without including baryonic physics .",
    "it is believed that baryonic cooling and star formation tend to increase the concentration of the halo mass distribution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , feedback from supernova and agns can heat the gas and suppress star formation .",
    "therefore , the overall effects of the baryonic component on the density profile of cluster - scale halos may not be significant ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it should also be pointed out that ms adopts the cosmological model with a higher @xmath77 and lower @xmath448 than the current best model from latest observations , e.g. ,  _ wmap_7 and _ planck _ @xcite .",
    "varying cosmological models can affect the properties of dark matter halos and therefore their @xmath0@xmath1 relation @xcite .",
    "it is shown that while the slope @xmath24 is not sensitive to cosmological models , the amplitude @xmath289 is .",
    "for instance , @xmath289 for _ wmap_1 cosmology is about @xmath449 higher than that of _ wmap_5 model , and the slope @xmath24 is consistent with @xmath450 in both models @xcite .",
    "however , very recent studies perform a direct comparison of halo concentration from the ms and predict from the _ planck _ cosmological model @xcite .",
    "the results show that for cluster - scale halos , the concentration parameter is nearly the same for the two models .",
    "this is because the _ planck _ cosmological model has a larger @xmath451 than that of ms , although @xmath452 is smaller .",
    "our analyses for massive halos show that substructures can affect the center identifications , and also lead to a negative bias to 2d concentration in comparison with that of 3-d halos ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it has been shown that a halo with lower concentration and higher mass and a halo formed later tend to contain a higher fraction of mass in substructures @xcite .",
    "the change of cosmology is expected to affect the mass accretion history and therefore the subhalo abundances .",
    "however , recent analyses of @xcite and @xcite show that substructure abundances are not very sensitive to cosmological models .",
    "for example , @xcite find that subhalo abundances at given host halo mass are very similar between ms and _",
    "wmap_7 cosmology , although ms has a higher @xmath452 .",
    "overall , our results presented here based on ms - simulated clusters may not be seriously affected by the specific cosmological model adopted by ms . the reasonable agreement between our simulation analyses , including the noise and selection effects and that of ok10 for the @xmath0@xmath1 relation , may indicate that our current understanding of the structure formation is well on track . on the other hand",
    ", the somewhat larger @xmath289 seen in og12 still deserves further studies .",
    "apart from comparing with ok10 and og12 , in this paper , we emphasize the methodology of center identification using weak - lensing analyses alone , and the noise effects on the weak - lensing - derived @xmath0@xmath1 relation .",
    "future weak - lensing observations can result in a large number of clusters with high signal - to - noise ratios .",
    "we expect that both our newly proposed 2k05k center identification method , and the bayesian method in deriving the @xmath0@xmath1 relation from a sample of weak - lensing studied clusters can have important applications in future cosmological studies .",
