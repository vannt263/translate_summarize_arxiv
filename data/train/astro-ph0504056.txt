    "during the quiescent state ( i.e. , outside bursts events ) soft @xmath0-ray repeaters ( sgrs ) are detected as persistent x - ray emitters with a luminosity of @xmath6erg s@xmath3 .",
    "several characteristics of sgrs , including their bursting activity , are often explained in the context of the `` magnetar '' model @xcite .",
    "magnetars are neutron stars whose x - ray emission is attributed to the presence of an ultra - strong magnetic field ( @xmath7gauss ) .",
    "the frequent short bursts are associated with small cracks in the neutron star crust , driven by magnetic diffusion @xcite . alternatively , because of their short ( submillisecond ) time scale , they may follow a sudden loss of magnetic equilibrium through the development of a tearing instability @xcite .",
    "giant flares , acting on a much longer time scale , should involve not only the above phenomena but also global rearrangements of the magnetic field in the interior and magnetosphere of the star .",
    "observations made on 2004 december 27 showed that sgr 1806 - 20 had experienced an exceptionally powerful giant flare , lasting @xmath8s @xcite . for",
    "the first 200ms it saturated almost all instruments on satellites equipped to observe @xmath0-rays .",
    "instruments on board the geotail spacecraft provided unique measurements @xcite of the hard x - ray intensity throughout the event . the energy associated with @xmath0-rays above 50 kev was @xmath9 ergs ( assuming a distance of 15 kpc and that it radiates isotropically ) , hundreds of times brighter than the giant flares previously observed from other sgrs . following the event ,",
    "a radio afterglow has been detected @xcite .",
    "several follow - on studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have concentrated on the characteristics of the extended tail of the flare .    in this letter",
    "we report observations of the initial flare rise and decay of sgr 1806 - 20 .",
    "this phase was recorded by the thermal electron detectors @xcite onboard two of the four cluster spaceraft , and also by an identical instrument on the chinese double star polar spacecraft , tc-2 @xcite .",
    "the data reported here are unsaturated , have a slightly higher temporal resolution ( 4ms as opposed to 5.48ms ) than that of similar measurements taken by the geotail spacecraft @xcite , and , critically , captured the initial flare activity without interruption during the very steep rise through and beyond the maximum in intensity .",
    "this dataset sheds unique information on the most intense period of flare activity .",
    "we have drawn on data from the peace instruments on cluster-2 ( c2 , not shown below ) , cluster-4 ( c4 ) , and double star polar orbiter ( tc-2 ) .",
    "altogether , these spacecraft carry 5 nearly identical instruments , although the naturally occuring electrons , which the instruments are designed to detect , confuse the flare response on two of them ( the low energy electron analysers on c2 and c4 ) . as the remaining sensors provide the same coverage , with less interference",
    ", we concentrate on those . the cluster and tc-2 spacecraft were at approximately 42,000 km and 26,000 km altitudes respectively and had unobstructed sight lines to the source , which was @xmath10 from the earth - sun line @xcite .",
    "additionally , all the sensors used in the present work were not obstructed by other parts of the spacecraft during the initial flare spike .",
    "the peace detector onboard tc-2 sweeps through a full range of electron energies every 121ms followed by an 8ms gap .",
    "each sweep is divided into 30 energy channels , measured sequentially and returned in the telemetry stream , leading to a 4ms cadence in count rate values . at the time of the flare ,",
    "the instrument was operating in a mode in which the lowest 14 channels were not returned , leading to a sequence of 16 measurements at 4ms resolution ( 64ms in total ) followed by a gap of 56 + 8ms .",
    "the response of the instrument to x- and @xmath0-radiation has not been calibrated , but the count rates are due to direct stimulation of the micro - channel - plate detectors at the receiving end of the electron optics . as such , it is independent of the particular energy channel and proportional to the incident flux , but dependent on the photon energy .",
    "by contrast , the peace detectors onboard the other spacecraft ( c2 and c4 ) were operating in a different mode .",
    "firstly , neighbouring energy channels were summed pairwise , leading to an 8ms cadence within a single sweep .",
    "moreover , neighbouring sweeps were summed pairwise .",
    "thus an individual measurement is the sum of an 8ms sample with another 8ms sample taken 125ms later . while there is no possibility to deconvolve this data , we are able to use the steep rise and decay of the flare to our advantage by assuming that each datum is dominated by the 8ms sample located in time closest to the peak in flare intensity .",
    "the data show changes in count rate of an order of magnitude per sweep .",
    "this enables us to assign those values , with a 10% error in counts , to a unique time .",
    "however , near the peak itself , where the counting rates vary less rapidly , this technique leads to a larger error .",
    "additionally , on cluster the count rate due to natural eletrons increases toward the end of each 125ms sweep . in this manner",
    "we reconstruct , with some unavoidable error , a time series of 8ms samples in 128ms blocks with 125ms gaps between blocks .",
    "the response of the instruments on cluster falls off more rapidly with time beyond the flare peak than on tc-2 .",
    "this is most likely due to the changing instrumental response as the spacecraft spins , as described below ; it may also be indicative of changes in the spectral characteristics of the source @xcite .",
    "we have drawn most of our conclusions from the higher resolution data on tc-2 , which follows more of the event and with less natural electron interference , and used the cluster data to fill in information about the shape of the light curve during a single 56ms period when tc-2 did not return data .",
    "we have not attempted a determination of the absolute @xmath0-ray flux during the event .",
    "apart from the lack of normal ground calibrations ( the instruments were not designed to measure @xmath0-rays ) , the response depends on the orientation of the instrument .",
    "this is due to differences in shielding added to reduce background radiation effects on the measurements of in situ electrons , to the partial obscurations caused by other instruments , fuel tanks , and spacecraft body , to differences in the intrinsic detector response , and to the operational parameters of the detector",
    ". some of these will vary with spacecraft spin , which has a period @xmath11s on both c4 and tc-2 . both tc-2 and the sensor used here from c4 were relatively unobscured during the peak in intensity , but had turned through @xmath12 by the time of a secondary peak some 390ms later , shown below .",
    "thus while local features are well - represented , the relative intensities of more widely separated features should be used with caution .",
    "figure  [ dslightcurve ] shows the count - rate of the tc-2 electron detector over a 1.45 second interval .",
    "zero time corresponds to the peak in count rate .",
    "we also show the previously reported geotail data @xcite , aligned in time . where data is available from both spacecraft the detailed features match extremely well ; in particular the steep rise and peak are evident . following the first 64ms gap in the tc-2 data",
    "( see section  [ methods ] ) , a shoulder appeared followed by a steeper decline .",
    "two groups of data points later , at @xmath13ms , a secondary , noisy peak can be seen ( enlarged in the inset ) , which coincides in time and shape with that seen by the bat instrument on swift ( supplementary figure  2 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and also by geotail @xcite .",
    "count rates return to their ambient levels ( @xmath14 ) at a time 600ms beyond the peak in the count rate .",
    "there is no doubt that the large , but unsaturated , count rates shown in figure  [ dslightcurve ] are signatures of the @xmath0-ray giant flare emitted by sgr 1806 - 20 .",
    "there is some hint in the cluster data ( not shown ) of a signal 3.54 seconds after the main spike .",
    "this coincides with a broad feature seen in the bat data which marked the return of the periodic tail pulses at the same period ( @xmath157.56s ) as in the pre - flare observations .    in order to fill in the key time interval near the spike",
    ", we show in figure  [ composite ] the combined data from both c4 and tc-2 .",
    "the combined set reveals a dip after @xmath16s followed by an increase leading to the shoulder seen in the tc-2 data .",
    "such `` repeated energy - injections '' on a 100ms timescale were reported in the geotail data @xcite as can be seen in figure  [ dslightcurve ] .",
    "this 100ms timescale is a feature of all three known giant flares @xcite .",
    "the c4 data prior to the peak show evidence of time - convolutions described in section  [ methods ] and have been omitted from figure  [ composite ] .",
    "accordingly , we focus mainly on the tc-2 data in what follows .",
    "the steep initial rise is well fit by an exponential function ( shown as the solid line ) and has an @xmath17-folding time of 4.9ms .",
    "this is an order of magnitude longer than the 0.3ms timescales @xcite find in the detailed leading edge ( prior to saturation of the bat instrument ) .",
    "later , 24ms before the peak intensity was reached , the increase slowed to an exponential rise with an @xmath17-folding time of 67ms , also shown as a solid line in the figure .",
    "the previously unresolved @xmath155ms @xmath17-folding rise marks the transition to a timescale comparable to the 100ms timescale of the overall main peak and subsequent energy injection(s ) .",
    "@xcite recently proposed a scenario in which the magnetars ( axps and sgrs ) differ from standard radio pulsars since their magnetic field is globally twisted inside the star , up to a strength of about 10 times the external dipole . at intervals",
    "it can twist up the external field and propagate outward through alfvn waves .",
    "the resulting stresses built up in the neutron star crust and the magnetic footpoint movements can lead to crustal fractures , glitching activity and flare emission @xcite . in this scenario",
    "the giant flare is produced when the crust is unable to respond ( quasi)plastically any more to the imparted stress and finally cracks @xcite ; the flare emission and the crustal fracturing can be in turn accompained by a simplification of the exterior magnetic field with a ( partial ) untwisting of the global magnetosphere .",
    "we note here that all three of the timescales observed during the giant flare emitted by sgr  1806 - 20 can be explained in this scenario .",
    "the initial sub - ms timescale revealed by bat is typical of reconnection processes in the external magnetosphere , where the low density gives rise to short alfvn times .",
    "the longer @xmath18ms timescale is related to i ) the overall duration of giant flares , ii ) the final part of the rise observed here and iii ) the repeated intensity rises at @xmath18ms intervals observed with geotail in the first 200ms after the peak .",
    "this time scale is comparable to the time for a @xmath19 g magnetic field to rearrange material in the deep crust and core of the neutron star , at an internal alfvn time , and appears as a rather regular feature in the lightcurves of giant flares @xcite .",
    "the intermediate @xmath20ms time is naturally explained if the rising time is limited by propagation of a triggering fracture of size @xmath20 km given the theoretical expectation @xmath21km(@xmath22ms ) @xcite .",
    "an alternative but extreme possibility is that the giant flare is a purely magnetospheric process in which a @xmath23ms timescale is that which is necessary for the tearing instability to initiate large - scale magnetospheric reconnection @xcite .",
    "however @xcite concedes that the crustal fracture model is more likely to explain the extended post - flare activity .",
    "both perspectives require an initial fast process on a magnetospheric alfvn crossing time to explain the very steep , sub - ms rise .",
    "thus , while the 5ms timescale reported here could be related to a tearing instability in the magnetosphere , it seems more probable that it is the first of a number of crustal events",
    ". this may not be the case for short bursts seen more frequently from sgrs , for which tearing could play an important role .",
    "recently , tens of hz quasi - periodic oscillations have been detected in the tail of the event @xcite .",
    "these modes are likely to be associated to global seismic oscillations .",
    "in particular , the large crustal fracturing inferred by us can easily excite toroidal modes with characteristic frequencies in the observed range .",
    "the tc-2 data thus provide the clue to the missing link between the interior magnetic processes and their external consequences and probe directly the crustal properties .",
    "cluster and double star were designed to study the various boundary layers of the earth s magnetosphere , including the physics of magnetic reconnection .",
    "such boundary layer physics has application throughout the astrophysical plasma universe , and it is therefore appropriate that these missions contribute in a more direct way to the study of magnetic reorganisation in an astrophysical object outside the solar system .    some of this work was supported by the uk pparc .",
    "we are grateful to t.  terasawa for the provision of the geotail data shown in figure  [ dslightcurve ] and for many helpful remarks .",
    "we thank g.  israel and c. thompson for helpful comments and pre - publication material .",
    "cluster is a project of esa and nasa .",
    "double star is a project of the chinese national space agency together with esa ."
