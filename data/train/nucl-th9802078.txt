    "the sudbury neutrino observatory ( sno ) @xcite will utilize the interaction of @xmath0b solar neutrinos with deuterium in heavy water to measure the shape of the recoil electron spectrum in charged - current ( cc ) interactions and the ratio of the number of charged - current to neutral - current ( nc ) events . in",
    "what follows , we will concentrate only on the test of the cc spectral shape , where one of the measurable quantities is the average kinetic energy of the detected recoil electrons , @xmath1 , to be defined more precisely below .",
    "the main uncertainties , other than counting statistics , arise from uncertainties in ( a ) the theoretical standard @xmath0b neutrino spectrum , ( b ) the detector energy resolution and ( c ) the detector absolute energy scale .",
    "if the uncertainties from these sources can be reduced sufficiently sno should be able to distinguish between a standard solar model with no neutrino oscillations and one with various choices of neutrino oscillation scenarios @xcite : a small mixing angle ( sma ) , a large mixing angle ( lma ) or vacuum oscillations ( vac ) solutions .",
    "one way to reduce these uncertainties is to introduce a @xmath0li calibration source . as part of its overall calibration strategy ,",
    "the sno collaboration will install a system that is capable of producing a @xmath0li source placed at several different locations inside the detector @xcite .",
    "detection of electrons from this source would demonstrate that the results obtained by sno for a known beta - decay spectrum are consistent with those measured in the laboratory .    in this paper",
    "we point out that uncertainties in the measured cc spectral shape can be reduced considerably by a direct comparison with the measured beta - decay spectrum of @xmath0li .",
    "for instance , rather than considering @xmath2 to be the benchmark for comparing experiment with different theoretical expectations , we consider the ratio @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the average kinetic energy of detected electrons from @xmath0li decay . in forming ratios such as this , many uncertainties cancel producing a much improved error budget .",
    "this suggested analysis strategy is based upon the fact that the electron spectra from @xmath0li beta decay and from @xmath0b solar - neutrino absorption on deuterium originate from mirror weak decays to common final states in @xmath0be@xmath5 , hence are highly correlated , have somewhat similar shapes and cover essentially the same energy range . in formulating this strategy , we have calculated the forbidden and radiative corrections to the @xmath0li beta and @xmath0b neutrino spectra and have considered the effects of theoretical and experimental uncertainties on the above - mentioned ratio .    in sec .",
    "[ s : s2 ] we define more carefully the quantities involved and outline the suggested strategy . in sec .",
    "[ s : s3 ] we give some calculated results , and in sec .",
    "[ s : s4 ] we summarize our findings .",
    "most of the formulae have been relegated to appendices .",
    "the recoil electrons produced by @xmath0b solar neutrinos being absorbed on deuterium have an average kinetic energy ( for an ideal detector ) given by    t_e _ ^ideal = , [ tenuideal ]    where @xmath6 is the threshold kinetic energy below which events in sno will be discarded . for the discussions that follow ,",
    "we adopt @xmath7 mev .",
    "the charge - current differential cross - section for neutrino absorption on deuterium @xmath8 , is a function of neutrino energy .",
    "we will use the calculated cross - section of ellis and bahcall @xcite for our computations , and adopt from bahcall and lisi @xcite a 0.14 % @xmath9 error in @xmath2 , this being the difference when kubodera - nozawa cross - sections @xcite are used instead .",
    "the @xmath0b neutrino spectrum is denoted @xmath10 , and @xmath11 is the probability that an electron - neutrino produced at the core of the sun remains an electron - neutrino by the time it is detected on earth .",
    "the different neutrino - oscillation scenarios yield different survival functions , @xmath11 . in the standard model with no neutrino oscillations , @xmath12 .",
    "the decay electrons produced in @xmath0li beta decay have an average kinetic energy ( for an ideal detector ) given by    t_e _ e^ideal = , [ teeideal ]    where @xmath13 is the electron spectrum .",
    "the beta decay of @xmath0li is the isospin analogue of the beta decay of @xmath0b ; both populate the same daughter @xmath0be states .",
    "the @xmath0be excited states are unstable and break up into two alpha particles . as a consequence ,",
    "the shape of the @xmath0li @xmath14 spectrum and of the @xmath0b neutrino spectrum deviate significantly from the standard allowed shape .",
    "measurements @xcite of the delayed @xmath15 spectra allow one to determine the profile of the intermediate @xmath0be state and thus to calculate the deviations in the electron and neutrino spectra .",
    "this is discussed at length in bahcall @xcite , where it is shown there is considerable discrepancy among different experiments related to the absolute energy calibration of the alpha particles .",
    "bahcall @xcite choose to display this uncertainty as a possible offset @xmath16 in the energy of the alpha particles from @xmath0be break up : @xmath17 .",
    "the value of the offset affects the calculated shape of _ both _ the beta and neutrino spectra . the effective @xmath18 uncertainty of the offset is estimated to be @xmath19 mev @xcite ;",
    "this estimate includes theoretical errors .",
    "bahcall @xcite have tabulated their recommended @xmath0b neutrino spectrum together with their @xmath18 errors .    in this work",
    "we require both a @xmath0b neutrino spectrum and a @xmath0li electron spectrum from decay to the same final states in @xmath0be@xmath5 , in order to compare the effects of common - mode uncertainties .",
    "therefore we use r - matrix theory to model the profile of the intermediate @xmath0be state , and in particular , the r - matrix fits of barker @xcite . to reproduce the possible offset in the energy of alpha particles , we shift the energy of the dominant resonance , @xmath20 , where the offset @xmath21 is obtained from the requirement that this method gives the same error as the bahcall @xcite treatment .",
    "the same offset is used consistently for both decay spectra .",
    "details of the r - matrix analysis are given in appendix [ s : rfit ] .",
    "there are two further differences between the @xmath0b neutrino spectrum and the @xmath0li electron spectrum originating in ( a ) recoil ( or forbidden ) corrections and ( b ) radiative corrections .",
    "details of these have been relegated to appendices [ s : arc ] and [ s : ardc ] respectively . however , in figs .",
    "[ f:1 ] and [ f:2 ] we show plots of these corrections for the individual spectra and their ratio .",
    "although both corrections are energy - dependent and hence a factor in determining @xmath22 their ratio is very much less energy dependent .",
    "thus any error in @xmath22 associated with determining these corrections is much reduced in considering the ratio @xmath3 .    in fig .",
    "[ f:1 ] we show the recoil correction for the @xmath0b neutrino spectrum and @xmath0li electron spectrum for two cases .",
    "the calculation is based on the elementary - particle treatment of beta decay of holstein @xcite and the correction depends principally on two parameters : @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "here @xmath16 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the weak - magnetism , gamow - teller and induced pseudotensor current form factors respectively .",
    "the two cases correspond to the induced pseudotensor current being retained in or removed from the calculation . in both cases",
    "the ratio is almost independent of energy , indicating little sensitivity to the presence of induced pseudotensor currents .    in fig .",
    "[ f:2 ] we show the radiative correction for the @xmath0b neutrino spectrum and @xmath0li electron spectrum again for two cases . in the first case , we assume the internal bremsstrahlung photons are not detected and so the energy of the photon is integrated over in obtaining the radiative correction . in this case",
    "there is a large difference in the energy dependence between the radiative corrections for the electron and neutrino spectra . in the second case ,",
    "we account for the fact that in a calorimetric detector such as sno , the internal bremsstrahlung photons from a @xmath0li source placed in the detector would be recorded and summed with the beta energy .",
    "we assume , for simplicity , that the efficiency and detector response for electrons and photons is the same , and compute the radiative correction for the summed energy ( photons plus electrons ) deposited .",
    "now one sees there is a much reduced difference between the energy dependence of the radiative corrections for the electron and neutrino spectra .    from figs .",
    "[ f:1 ] and [ f:2 ] , it is fairly clear there will be little uncertainty in the ratio , @xmath3 , arising from any uncertainty in recoil and radiative corrections .",
    "therefore , we will not consider these corrections explicitly any further ; but rather we will assume they are effectively absorbed in the energy offset parameter , @xmath16 , which as has been mentioned above was estimated by bahcall @xcite to be @xmath27 kev , and contained theoretical uncertainties associated with recoil and radiative corrections .    finally , we turn to detector - related uncertainties . the measured electron kinetic energy , @xmath28 , determined by sno will be distributed around the true energy , @xmath29 , with a width established by the detected cerenkov photon statistics .",
    "the resolution function @xmath30 is approximated by a normalized gaussian :    r(t_e^,t_e ) = \\ { - } , [ resfn ]    where @xmath31 is an energy - dependent @xmath9 width given by @xcite    ( t_e^ ) = _ 10 , [ sig10 ]    with @xmath32 the resolution width at @xmath33 mev .",
    "we follow bahcall and lisi @xcite and use @xmath34 mev ( @xmath9 errors ) as an illustrative example .    the expressions , eqs .",
    "( [ tenuideal ] ) and ( [ teeideal ] ) , are now modified to include a response function    t_e _ = , [ tenu ]    t_e _ e = .",
    "[ tee ]    the other major uncertainty concerns the absolute energy calibration for the sno detector .",
    "for this , we assume a 1% error at 10 mev .",
    "this can be easily implemented in the calculations by modifying the energy - resolution function , eq .",
    "( [ resfn ] ) , with the replacement    r(t_e^,t_e ) r(t_e^ + , t_e ) , [ resfnrepl ]    where @xmath35 kev ( @xmath36 error ) .",
    "the above methods for treating detector - related uncertainties are a rough parametrization of detailed considerations regarding the spatial and directional response to energy deposition in the sno detector .",
    "other sources of uncertainties which have not been taken into account in this work are ( a ) the energy dependence of the detector efficiency , ( b ) the statistical and systematic uncertainties associated with background subtraction and neutral - current event separation , ( c ) the uncertainties in the @xmath37li beta - spectrum ( as measured in sno ) due to the source container , and ( d ) the position dependence of the measured energy .",
    "evaluation of the effects of these uncertainties will have to await detailed monte - carlo simulations and actual measurements of detector performance when sno is operational .",
    "having listed the source of uncertainties , it remains to quantify their contribution to the error budget for the detection of recoil electrons following neutrino absorption on deuterium alone , @xmath2 , or in concert with a calibration experiment with a @xmath0li source in the detector , @xmath3 .",
    "the results are given in table [ t:1 ] .",
    "the error budget for the former case has been given by bahcall and lisi @xcite and we follow their example .",
    "the statistical error ( @xmath38 ) on 5000 cc events is estimated at 0.98% for @xmath2 . in the calibration experiment",
    "there will be considerably more events counted , so the statistical uncertainty in the ratio @xmath3 will be dominated by the 5000 cc neutrino events : we use the same statistical error . for the neutrino - absorption on deuterium ,",
    "the uncertainty in the absorption cross - section is common to both @xmath2 and @xmath3 , so again we use the same error . the uncertainty in the neutrino spectrum from the beta decay of @xmath0b is characterised by the offset parameter , @xmath16 , associated with the absolute energy calibration of the @xmath15-particles in the measured delayed @xmath15-spectrum .",
    "upto differences associated with isospin - symmetry breaking , recoil and radiative corrections , the same uncertainty occurs in the calibration experiment , so the error in the ratio @xmath3 is much reduced .",
    "table [ t:1 ] shows a reduction of uncertainty by a factor of 7.6 .",
    "the same reasoning follows for the detector - related uncertainties , since in both experiments , energetic electrons are being counted in the same detector .",
    "we find a reduction in uncertainty by a factor of 8.5 due to the detector s energy resolution , and a factor of 5.0 due to its absolute energy calibration .",
    "the energy calibration of the detector here has been oversimplified .",
    "the analysis above assumes that the electron sources from @xmath0li beta decay and from neutrino absorption are identical , but of course they are not .",
    "the @xmath0li calibration sources are highly localized in space and time , while the recoil electrons produced by absorption of solar neutrinos are distributed throughout the detector and distributed in time .",
    "so our analysis here represents an optimal scenario , but it is sufficient to make the point that an improvement in the error budget will be achieved by performing an in situ calibration experiment .    if all errors are added together in quadrature , then the @xmath38 uncertainty in the cc test at sno using @xmath2 alone is 2.8% and is dominated by the uncertainty in the absolute energy calibration .",
    "however , in combination with a @xmath0li calibration experiment , the @xmath18 uncertainty in the ratio @xmath3 is reduced to 1.2% , and more importantly , is dominated by counting statistics .",
    "this analysis strategy will significantly improve sno s ability to discriminate among the different neutrino - oscillation scenarios . in fig .",
    "[ f:3 ] we display the error budget together with the theoretical value of @xmath3 for various neutrino - oscillation solutions @xcite to the solar - neutrino problem : the two ( best - fit ) mikheyev - smirnov - wolfenstein ( msw ) solutions at small and large mixing angle ( sma and lma ) and the purely vacuum ( vac ) oscillation solution . in an analagous plot by bahcall and lisi @xcite , it is shown that a measurement of @xmath2 alone is unlikely to resolve the two msw solutions .",
    "on the other hand , the ratio measurement , fig .",
    "[ f:3 ] , clearly shows the lma and sma solutions as being experimentally distinguishable , if the other uncertainties in the detector can be minimized .",
    "although we have considered the ratio of @xmath3 , it is possible to construct other experimental quantities from the measured cc and @xmath0li spectra .",
    "one of the simplest observables to consider is the actual ratio of the normalized measured cc spectrum , @xmath39 , to the normalized measured @xmath0li electron spectrum , @xmath40 . because of the high degree of similarity between those two spectra , the effect of uncertainties on the detector response function",
    "are expected to largely cancel when forming this ratio . in fig .",
    "[ f:4 ] we display the effect of the uncertainty in the detector energy scale , @xmath41 on the the double ratio    r(cc/^8li ) = [ dblratio ]    where @xmath42 refers to a spectrum where all parameters including the absolute energy calibration are assumed to be known .",
    "if @xmath40 is not measured ( i.e. the denominator is assumed to be unity ) , then the dashed lines enclose the error band with @xmath433@xmath44 errors on @xmath41 .",
    "a measurement of @xmath40 allows the cancellation of correlated errors and produces the much reduced `` @xmath433@xmath44 '' error band enclosed by the solid lines .",
    "the effect due to the statistics of 5000 cc events above 5 mev is shown by overlaying on fig .",
    "[ f:4 ] the shape distortion expected for the best - fit mass and mixing values for the sma solution @xcite ( @xmath45 ev@xmath46 and sin@xmath47 ) .",
    "we can clearly see that making use of the @xmath0li spectrum as measured in sno reduces the effects of systematic uncertainties and greatly increases the discriminating power of the cc shape measurement .",
    "the sno detector is being constructed primarily to measure the neutral - current ( nc ) to charged - current ( cc ) cross - section ratio for solar neutrino absorption in deuterium .",
    "it is anticipated this measurement will give a strong and unambiguous signal of neutrino oscillations ( or the lack thereof ) .",
    "another test , which does not rely on the knowledge of the absolute reaction cross - sections , is a measurement of the spectral shape of the cc reaction alone . to improve the sensitivity for this measurement , a calibration experiment",
    "is planned at sno with a @xmath0li source placed in the detector .",
    "if instead of considering only the first moment of the recoil electron spectrum in the cc reaction , @xmath2 , the ratio of this moment to the equivalent moment in the @xmath0li beta decay is used as a benchmark , then an increase in the sensitivity of a factor of 2.4 could be achieved in the cc - shape test .",
    "this improvement would be sufficient to resolve the small - angle and large - angle msw solutions to the solar - neutrino problem .",
    "we stress again , however , that not all uncertainties are known at the present time and some will require actual measurements when sno is operational , so our analysis here represents an optimistic best - case scenario . to us ,",
    "a calibration experiment with a @xmath0li source certainly seems beneficial .",
    "we thank emanuel bonvin for initially suggesting the use of @xmath0li to calibrate the sno detector , and graham lee - whiting for fruitful discussions on radiative corrections .",
    "we also thank j.n . bahcall and e. lisi for permission to use their computer code for the calculation of the neutrino - deuterium cross sections .",
    "the allowed @xmath48-transitions from the decay of @xmath0li or @xmath0b populate @xmath49 states of @xmath0be , which then decay into two @xmath15-particles .",
    "the @xmath15-spectra show a pronounced peak , corresponding to the @xmath49 first excited state of @xmath0be at @xmath50 mev .",
    "attempts to fit the @xmath15-spectra assuming only one state in @xmath0be is operative fail to give enough yield at high energies .",

    "radiative corrections to the electron spectrum from allowed beta decay have been considered in a number of papers @xcite . in obtaining the corrections ,",
    "integrations are carried out over the allowed neutrino and photon energies and the results exhibited as a differential spectrum in electron energy .",
    "the contributions to the radiative corrections have two components : the emission of real photons ( internal bremsstrahlung ) and virtual radiative corrections due , for example , to the exchange of photons between charged particles .",
    "the differential rate for real photon emission in an allowed beta transition is given by the expression @xcite      here @xmath124 represents the photon energy , @xmath125^{1/2}$ ] , @xmath126 being the photon momentum and @xmath70 a small nonzero photon mass introduced to regulate the infrared divergence .",
    "further , @xmath56 is the electron energy , @xmath57 the electron momentum , @xmath127 , @xmath128 the maximum electron energy and @xmath129 the cosine of the angle between the electron and photon directions .",
    "the delta function is used to integrate over the neutrino energies .",
    "the integrations over @xmath126 and @xmath129 are however very delicate : the logarithmic pole in @xmath70 has to be extracted to cancel with the @xmath70 dependence coming from the virtual corrections .    in the calibration experiment at sno , a @xmath0li source will be placed inside the sno detector .",
    "the real internal bremsstrahlung photons emitted by this source will in principle be detected .",
    "so we can not follow the normal procedure of obtaining the radiative correction by integrating over @xmath126 .",
    "suppose that sno detects photons of energy greater than some threshold , say @xmath130 .",
    "then for @xmath126 less than @xmath130 , the normal procedure can be followed except that in the integration over @xmath126 , the upper limit @xmath131 is taken to be the lesser of @xmath130 or @xmath132 , rather than just @xmath132 .",
    "the result for real photon emission is              for the case when the photon energy exceeds @xmath130 we must proceed a little differently .",
    "we assume , for simplicity , that photons and electrons are detected with equal efficiency and that it is the sum of the energy deposited that is observed in the sno detector .",
    "thus in eq .",
    "( [ tripledf ] ) we change variables from @xmath137 to @xmath138 , where @xmath139 is the sum @xmath140 , and integrate over @xmath56 from @xmath54 to @xmath139 .",
    "the result is              where @xmath52 is the nucleon mass , and @xmath142 a renormalization scale . in the early years",
    ", yokoo @xcite invoked an intermediate vector - boson model to argue that @xmath142 should be of the order of the nucleon mass . following the development of the weinberg - salam standard model , the virtual radiative correction includes additionally the exchange of @xmath143-bosons .",
    "sirlin @xcite has shown , remarkably , that the form of the expression , eq .",
    "( [ virtual ] ) , remains unchanged except that @xmath142 is now replaced by the mass of the @xmath143-boson , @xmath144 . for our purposes ,",
    "the value of @xmath142 is not important as it only enters in a constant , energy - independent term and would be absorbed into the normalization of the spectra . in fig.[f:2 ] we used @xmath142 equal to the nucleon mass , @xmath52 .",
    "note that the infrared divergence term in @xmath145 exactly cancels between the real and virtual photon expressions , as it should .",
    "in summary , the radiative correction to the electron spectrum is      finally , we consider the radiative correction for the neutrino spectrum .",
    "this is not obtained from the electron spectrum radiative correction by the substitution of @xmath115 because the energy available to the leptons is distributed three ways : to the electron , to the neutrino and to the internal bremsstrahlung photon .",
    "this was first pointed out by batkin and sundaresan @xcite .",
    "since the neutrinos are originating from beta decays in the sun , there is no question this time of the internal bremsstrahlung photons being detected .",
    "thus , starting from eq .",
    "( [ tripledf ] ) for the real photon radiative correction , the delta function is used in the integration over electron energies , while the integrations over @xmath126 and @xmath129 are done carefully to isolate the infrared singularity .",
    "the result has been given by batkin and sundaresan @xcite .",
    "the virtual radiative correction is unchanged and given by eq .",
    "( [ virtual ] ) .",
    "putting these together we get                                                               cdddcddd & & & & & & & + & & & + & & & & & & & + @xmath70 &  @xmath71 & @xmath72 & @xmath73 & & @xmath71 & @xmath72 & @xmath73 + & & & & & & & + 1 & 2.804 & 0.588 & 0.102 & & 2.798 & 0.591 & 0.108 + 2 & 8.87 & 0.884 & @xmath147.180 & & 8.85 & 0.880 & @xmath1480.181 + 3 & 34.1 & 1.442 & 0.000 & & 34.1 & 1.442 & 0.000 + 0 & 16.72 & 0.109 & 1.64 & & 16.72 & 0.109 & 1.77 + @xmath149 & 17.02 & & 0.000 & & 17.02 & & 0.000 +"
