    "proper motion catalogs that include faint stars have generally been used to obtain samples of low mass main sequence stars and white dwarfs of both disk and halo populations in the solar neighborhood . that this kind of selection introduces both kinematic and population biases ( usually in favor of high velocity stars )",
    "has long been recognized ( cf .",
    "hanson 1983 ) . the cumulative distribution function n(@xmath7 ) of a proper motion catalog should be proportional to @xmath8 , if the catalog is complete to proper motion and magnitude limits ( luyten 1963 , hanson 1979 ) .",
    "if , in addition , the kinematical properties of the sample of stars being selected may be modelled accurately enough , the bias can be removed in principle , and a luminosity function ( lf ) and space density can be determined for the sample .",
    "schmidt ( 1975 ) first applied his 1/v@xmath9 method to determine the lf of local halo stars , using primarily stars from the proper motion catalog of the lowell observatory ( giclas , burnham and thomas 1968 ) .",
    "bahcall & casertano ( 1986 ) applied a more comprehensive kinematical model for halo stars to a similar sample drawn mainly from lowell proper motion measurements .",
    "however , the luyten palomar survey utilizing the palomar observatory sky survey ( poss  i ) with the 48-inch schmidt telescope in the 1950s and a second epoch series of red - only ( 103ae ) plates obtained by luyten a decade later extended several magnitudes fainter than the lowell catalogs . using a sample of low mass halo main sequence stars drawn largely from the stars of largest motion in the luyten half second ( lhs ) survey ( luyten 1979 ) , dahn et al .",
    "( 1995 ) applied schmidt s and bahcall & casertano s methods to determine a local halo lf extending to the stellar mass terminus .",
    "liebert , dahn & monet ( 1988 , 1989 ) used a similar sample to estimate an lf for white dwarf stars of the disk and a sampling of the halo .",
    "finally , there have been several estimates of the disk low mass star lfs , and controversy has arisen as to why estimates based on nearby star or proper motion samples differ from those based on samples selected by red colors ( reid and gizis 1997 ) .",
    "the completeness of proper motion catalogs , especially for faint luyten stars of large motion , has also been a topic of some controversy .",
    "hanson s ( 1979 ) analysis suggested that the lhs catalog may be 20% incomplete for proper motions @xmath101 arcsec  yr@xmath1 .",
    "the analysis of dawson ( 1986 ) suggested that the lhs catalog is 90% complete to b= 21 over the region of sky north of @xmath11 = -30@xmath3 , above galactic latitude @xmath12 = 10@xmath3 .",
    "more negative assessments of the luyten catalogs include those of oswalt et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and wood & oswalt ( 1998 ) .",
    "these authors applied a very large correction factor for incompleteness of the luyten catalogs , resulting in a higher space density or lf for white dwarfs than was obtained by liebert et al .",
    "( 1988 , 1989 ) who assumed no incompleteness .",
    "however , wood and oswalt s ( 1998 ) simulations actually indicated that serious magnitude - limited incompleteness sets in at @xmath13 = 0.15 - 0.20 arcsec  yr@xmath1 , and do not obviously apply to the motions of the lhs . although their conclusion was based on the discovery of a single , cool white dwarf star ( wd0346 + 246 ) , hambly , smartt , & hodgkin ( 1997 ) also inferred that the luyten samples are incomplete .",
    "flynn et al . ( 2000 ) concluded that the lhs is only 60% complete to a red magnitude ( r@xmath14 ) = 18.5 , based on a statistical analysis of the new luyten two tenths ( nltt ) catalog .",
    "it is worth pointing out again that this was not a direct analysis of larger lhs motion stars .    of particular interest",
    "recently is the search for halo white dwarfs in the solar neighborhood where they might be bright enough to be detectable .",
    "this interest has intensified due to the possible discovery of faint stellar objects with proper motions in the hubble deep field ( ibata et al .",
    "2000 ) , and the possibility that macho collaboration detections could be halo objects of around half a solar mass ( alcock et al .",
    "1997 , 2000 ) .",
    "some researchers have suggested that cool white dwarfs could thus account for a substantial fraction of the dark halo or corona .",
    "the search for dim halo stars underscores another potential shortcoming of the luyten surveys , namely that the search radius of luyten s measuring machine limited the maximum detectable proper motion to about 2.5@xmath15  yr@xmath1 .",
    "as pointed out by graff , laughlin and freese ( 1998 ) , this limited any search for nearby halo white dwarfs to those with v@xmath16121",
    "km  s@xmath1 at 10pc distance .",
    "yet a majority of halo white dwarfs nearby enough to the sun to be found on schmidt plates may have higher tangential velocities than this .",
    "it should nonetheless also be noted that luyten personally blinked over 15% of the poss fields and found no stars with m@xmath17 15 and @xmath18 2.5@xmath15  yr@xmath1 .    the second palomar sky survey ( poss  ii ) with the same telescope , now called the oschin schmidt ( reid et al .",
    "1991 ) , introduces a valuable new dataset to test the completeness of the earlier survey , and indeed to find new proper motion stars to fainter limiting magnitudes ( b@xmath19 = 22.5 mag , r@xmath20 = 20.8 i@xmath20 = 19.5 ) due to the use of a new generation of kodak photographic emulsions and other improvements .",
    "the near - infrared bandpass had no counterpart in poss  i. in contrast luyten s `` second epoch '' for palomar catalogs was obtained with the same red kodak emulsion type as poss  i , and the exposure times were shorter than for poss  i. in addition , the telescope was upgraded considerably for the new survey , notably by replacing the corrector to improve the images at near - infrared wavelengths , refining the mechanical accuracy of the plate - holders and automating guiding .",
    "finally , for the new survey a @xmath21 spacing between fields was adopted , instead of the 6@xmath22 spacing of poss  i , the latter having barely allowed overlap between adjacent fields .    the u.s .",
    "naval observatory , flagstaff station , has obtained a new precision measuring machine ( pmm ) for the purpose of digitizing all poss  i and poss  ii plates , as well as u.k .",
    "science research council src - j survey plates , and the european southern observatory eso - r survey plates , of generally similar quality as poss for the southern hemisphere . the pmm design , operation , and data products are described in documentary files on the usno - a cd - rom set and on the web site http://www.nofs.navy.mil/projects/pmm/ ( monet et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "the principal goal of pmm has been to produce a digital sky survey for a variety of scientific purposes and as a resource for the community .",
    "the first catalog of point sources measured from the original poss  i , the src - j and eso - r survey ( the latter two for the non - overlapping southern sky ) is called usno - a . at the time of this writing , all plates accepted for poss  ii have also been scanned with the pmm .",
    "many second - generation r - band plates taken by the uk schmidt telescope have also been scanned .",
    "the long term goal is to produce the usno - b catalog , which will extend the usno - a catalog in key areas : providing star / galaxy differentiation information and proper motions for point sources detected at both palomar epochs .    the first poss  ii plates were obtained in 1986 , and they continue to be taken up to the time of this writing .",
    "thus the time baseline for measuring the proper motion of stars exceeds 30 years , and may extend to 45 years for some areas of the sky . for comparison ,",
    "the luyten - palomar time baseline was 10 - 15 years .",
    "clearly , the search radius for detecting the migrations of stars having large motion must be increased correspondingly in matching poss  ii with poss  i stellar positions .",
    "this makes the task of finding the correct match more difficult than that faced by luyten .",
    "thus , while it is easy to forecast that many more proper motion stars will be catalogued in usno - b than exist in current catalogs for motions near or below the limits of those catalogs ( 0.2@xmath15  yr@xmath1 for luyten ) , it may be difficult even with a new generation of software and hardware to find the stars of very high motion .",
    "given the high standards for acceptance of poss ii plate material , a significant fraction of the 894 fields have been imaged more than once in at least one of the b , r or i bands .",
    "a proportion of the latter plates have been rejected for cosmetic reasons ( aircraft trails , background density variations , small - scale photographic defects ) or because the image quality ( primarily due to mild astigmatism ) fails to meet survey criteria .",
    "many of those plates remain useful scientifically , particularly for analyses requiring positional ( rather than photometric ) data for point sources , such as the astrometric study described here .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to assess the completeness of surveys for stars of large proper motion ( notably the lhs ) using higher quality plate material spanning a smaller time baseline than used in the original analyses .",
    "although only a small percentage of the total sky is covered , we also had the chance to find much more easily than luyten any stars in these fields with proper motions @xmath0 2.5@xmath15  yr@xmath1 .",
    "we adopt a minimum value of 0.4@xmath15  yr@xmath1 , placing us below the lower bound of the lhs , but we are interested primarily in motions appreciably larger than that .",
    "we place an additional arbitrary constraint on the survey f plate brightness , restricting ourselves to objects fainter than f = 14 .",
    "other proper motion surveys for brighter stars ( eg . from the lowell observatory ) lend greater confidence in the completeness level for the brighter stars .",
    "the goal of our analysis was therefore ( 1 ) to find new stars that luyten missed with proper motions larger than 0.4@xmath15  yr@xmath1 , and fainter than f=14 , and ( 2 ) to test the completeness of our own methods by finding the percentage of catalogued proper motion stars that we recover .",
    "this presumably also tests our efficiency in finding proper motion stars missed in especially the lhs survey , and in testing the completeness of the lhs .",
    "our data set and procedures are described in section  2 , and the results presented in section  3 . the implications for the completeness of prior catalogs , and the promise of the poss  ii data for the discovery of new proper motion stars , are discussed in section  4 .",
    "for this project we selected fields where rejected red ( poss  ii iiiaf , hereafter f@xmath23 ) plates of good quality were available , as well as accepted plates for the blue and infrared bands .",
    "the reasons for this choice included the fact that stars of large proper motion are generally cool , that more such pairs were available than for blue ( poss  ii iiiaj ) pairs , and that luyten measured proper motions using the red ( e ) plates of both his epochs .",
    "a drawback of the sample is that the epoch differences between the rejected and accepted f plates , and between these and the accepted blue ( j ) and and infrared ( iv - n or n ) plates are random and can range from essentially zero to as long as 10 years .",
    "rejected f plates from 140 fields have been scanned with the pmm at flagstaff . in our initial analysis",
    "we concentrated on fields at high galactic latitude ( @xmath24 20@xmath3 ) with full four - plate sets ( poss  ii j , f , f@xmath23 and n ) .",
    "in addition , we required that the set of four plates provide a suitable spread in epoch distribution : specifically , no epoch difference between any two of the four plates could be less than 1.5 years .",
    "any proper motion object found thus was required to show a consistent pattern of motion ( the same amount and direction ) over four different epochs .",
    "the reason for this restriction is the prevalence of `` false '' detections of apparent point sources in the halos of very bright stars , in their diffraction spikes , within galaxies , and between double stars .",
    "the vast majority of these are filtered out by requiring the four - plate solution for motion to be consistent .",
    "it was feared that this stringent requirement might result in the inability to find some `` real '' objects owing to positional measurement errors .",
    "it was hoped , however , that by maintaining the four - plate requirement , the number of spurious detections would be reduced to a manageable number , excludable by inspection of a digitized poss server through the internet .",
    "( given the very large number of fields so inspected , this procedure was more practical than downloading our own pixel database stored on many tapes . )",
    "the imposition of these two requirements reduced the available fields from around 140 to 35 .",
    "this corresponds to roughly 5% of the luyten poss  i fields .",
    "the plate centers of these 35 poss  ii fields are listed in table  1 .    to ascertain the degree",
    "to which we inhibit our ability to recover real proper motion objects by requiring that there be consistent measurements on all four plates spanning the blue to infrared bands , we repeated the procedure using two combinations of just three plates .",
    "we omitted the n plate in one set , to test how much that ( generally ) lower quality plate affects our completeness . in the other",
    "set , we dropped the requirement of a j plate detection to determine the number of possibly - cool objects measured only on the f and n plates .",
    "a more detailed description of the procedure for matching point sources on the several plates used for each field , and the measurement of consistent proper motion candidates between pairs of plates is given in appendix  a.",
    "in the 35 fields for the four - plate solution , there were 50 objects classified as stars by the software that met our motion and magnitude constraints but with no corresponding entry in the luyten or giclas catalogs .",
    "of these , 31 were objects misidentified as point sources by the pmm but which visual inspection showed to be galaxies , close doubles , or diffraction spikes associated with very bright stars usually having substantial proper motion .",
    "nine objects showed no visible motion between the digitized versions of poss  i and poss  ii .",
    "that is , there could be no confirmation of a real proper motion star in the field down to the poss  i magnitude limit .",
    "three objects proved to be known , catalogued stars , but the identification was missed by the software .",
    "the remaining seven objects appear to be genuinely new proper motion objects , one of which is actually a common proper motion pair .",
    "these eight new proper motion stars , their j2000 positions , proper motions and position angles , and the four photographic magnitudes , are given in table  2 .",
    "finding charts are not displayed here , since each star is easily accessible via a poss web server ( http://www.nofs.navy.mil/data/fchpix/cfra.html ) .",
    "proper motion may also be confirmed by comparison with the poss  i and poss  ii fields .",
    "nine new proper motion stars from the two three - plate solutions are given in table  3 .",
    "the first two objects were found from the solutions lacking the j plates , and the last seven lacked the n plates .",
    "not surprisingly , a much higher fraction of `` mistakes '' occurred than for the four - plate solution ( diffraction spikes , galaxies , doubles and blended images , etc . ) and again had to be eliminated by visual inspection of the digitized poss  i and poss  ii fields .",
    "of the 17 new proper motion stars of tables  2 and 3 , 10 are below the 0.5@xmath15  yr@xmath1 limit of the lhs .",
    "while we used a generously low cutoff proper motion of 0.4@xmath15  yr@xmath1 in this exercise , the main interest is in the completeness for finding those of higher motion , such as above 0.6@xmath15  yr@xmath1 used previously for defining samples of white dwarfs ( dahn , monet & harris 1989 , liebert et al .",
    "1999 ) and halo subdwarfs ( dahn et al . 1995 ) .",
    "four such objects are listed in table  2 , and only two in table  3 had motions exceeding 0.6@xmath15  yr@xmath1 . in the remainder of this section , we discuss some of these stars individually .",
    "table  4 presents some broadband optical photometry we were able to obtain for the new proper motion stars in table  2 .",
    "poss  15:00:03.51  + 36:00:30.5 : inspection of the poss  ii image shows a clear point source at the j2000 position .",
    "a similar inspection of the poss  i shows a marginally - visible candidate at the expected separation and position angle .",
    "the photometry in table  4 indicates the object is fainter than luyten s poss  i and second epoch detection limit , and is certainly below the lhs completeness limit . a spectrum with the hale 5  m double spectrograph ( oke & gunn 1982 ) was obtained on 1998 may , and the blue and red spectra",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "atmospheric features in the red part of the spectrum have not been removed .",
    "no stellar features are detected in the spectrum .",
    "in particular the absence of an h@xmath25 line indicates that the spectral type , at least in the red , is that of a very cool dc white dwarf .",
    "a parallax is being measured with the @xmath26 strand telescope , and the preliminary result confirms the spectroscopic suggestion .",
    "after just over one year of observation , the absolute parallax is @xmath27 , and the absolute v magnitude is @xmath28 .",
    "this result is consistent with the m@xmath29 estimatable from the bvi colors ( bergeron , wesemael & beauchamp 1995 ) and implies that it is a cool white dwarf with a normal mass @xmath30 .",
    "together with the proper motion , this indicates a tangential velocity of @xmath31 showing that the object is a halo star .",
    "poss  15:30:55.62  + 56:08:56.4/15:30:56.51  + 56:08:52.0 : this is a resolved double whose components are of nearly equal brightness .",
    "our software paired the components wrongly and produced a single proper motion star with 1.438@xmath15  yr@xmath1 .",
    "inspection showed that both components move together and the remeasured values were 0.738@xmath15  yr@xmath1 with position angle @xmath32 .",
    "luyten ( 1981 ) wrote `` the machine - processed plates lack virtually all double stars with nearly equal magnitudes and separations less than 10 arc seconds '' because it ignored `` nonstellar '' objects .",
    "spectra were obtained of both stars on 1999 july 17 u.t . with the lris spectrograph on keck  ii ( oke et al .",
    "1995 ) , used in the configuration described in kirkpatrick et al .",
    "these spectra are shown in fig .  2 , fluxed on an f@xmath33 scale .",
    "strong features due to cah near 6900  demonstrate that each object is an extreme subdwarf m , logical spectral counterparts for stars of large proper motion .",
    "poss  21:01:04.18  + 03:07:05.1 : the poss  i image appears blended with a field star , though our poss  ii epochs have clean images .",
    "this presumably explains why this object was not in the luyten catalog .",
    "since its colors are quite red , it is likely to be a late m dwarf possibly within 20 pc .",
    "poss  00:01:25.72  + 28:25:20.5 and 16:17:50.84  + 19:05:43.2 : these are the only two new proper motion stars with @xmath34 0.5@xmath15  yr@xmath1 found from three - plate solutions that appear clearly on both digitized poss epochs . at magnitudes brighter than 19 in all bands",
    ", there is no apparent reason they fail to appear in a luyten catalog .",
    "we have not yet obtained photometric , spectroscopic or astrometric observations .",
    "to evaluate the completeness of our own survey , we analyzed the fraction of previously catalogued objects that the pmm successfully identified .",
    "there are a total of 230 fast ( @xmath35 ) and faint ( magnitude 13.0 in some band or fainter ) catalogued proper motion stars in these 35 fields . of these 230 stars ,",
    "216 were recovered , or 94% . of the remaining 14 objects ,",
    "six stars are sufficiently near the edge ( @xmath36 or @xmath37 ) of their respective plates , that there may be either larger errors in determining the astrometry or sufficient deviation among the four plate centers to put the star off the field of at least one of the plates",
    ". the remaining eight stars  less than 3.5% of the catalogued stars  appear to have been missed by the software for various reasons , some explainable and others not .",
    "( one object was in the flare of a bright star , one was nearby a bright star , two were perhaps too bright for the survey , two were blended , and two had no obvious explanation . )",
    "the effective survey area for each plate is @xmath38 or @xmath39 minus the occluded area of the density spots ( @xmath40 or @xmath41 ) , so that our 35 plate search covered some @xmath42 , or 3.3% of the sky .",
    "luyten processed by machine or eye some 804 poss  i fields , or roughly @xmath43 at significant galactic latitudes .",
    "some 160 low galactic latitude fields were not analyzed , and he estimated ( luyten 1979 ) that about twice that area of sky was inaccessible to palomar observation .",
    "the lhs catalog lists 3587 stars with proper motions above 0.5@xmath15  yr@xmath1 . in this experiment on some 1378 square degrees ",
    "@xmath443% of the sky or @xmath445% of the fraction measured by luyten ",
    "we discovered six new stars of such large proper motion .",
    "this experiment also offered the possibility of finding very high proper motion stars , such as nearby halo white dwarfs above luyten s 2.5@xmath15  yr@xmath1 search radius .",
    "however , no such star was found .",
    "our results suggest that a similar poss  ii survey of all 804 luyten fields might add a modest 6/0.05 or @xmath44120 new `` lhs '' stars plus doubles , or @xmath44130 objects if our @xmath4590% success rate in recovering catalogued lhs stars in these fields is indicative of our overall completeness .",
    "the proper motions of the new stars appear consistent with the expected @xmath8 distribution .",
    "if our yield of new stars is extrapolated to 2.5@xmath15  yr@xmath1 , only about two new stars of larger motion would be predicted for the entire sky .",
    "we have also experienced firsthand a few circumstances that might have caused luyten to have missed a motion star ",
    "superposition with another star during one epoch , close common proper motion pairs , and of course the modest limiting magnitudes of poss  i. much ado has been made of the fact that luyten missed the large proper motion star wd0346 + 246 , which is claimed to be a very cool halo white dwarf ( hambly , smartt and hodgkin 1997 ; hodgkin et al 2000 ) .",
    "however , this object is very faint , similar to the new , probable halo white dwarf poss  15:00:03.51  + 36:00:30.5 ; the second epoch luyten exposures may have been too short to detect either star .",
    "while this was a painstaking experiment , we do not claim an accurate value of the completeness of the lhs catalog .",
    "however , if the lhs were only @xmath4460% complete to a red magnitude of r@xmath14=18.5 ( hambly et al .",
    "1997 ; flynn et al .",
    "2000 ) , over one hundred new proper motion stars might have been found in this exercise .",
    "our work indicates instead that the completeness fractions reported by hanson ( 1979 ) and dawson ( 1986 ) ( 80 - 90% ) are not serious overestimates .",
    "a similar conclusion is implied by the analysis of the cumulative distribution of proper motions for an enlarged group of lhs - selected white dwarfs ( liebert et al .",
    "1999 ; harris et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "the discrepancy between the completeness of luyten s catalogs found in this paper and that found by flynn et al .",
    "( 2000 ) appears significant .",
    "what might cause such a discrepancy ? we have reviewed the clever argument made by flynn et al . , and we have confirmed their results ( their fig .",
    "one assumption made in their analysis that `` the number density of stars does not change appreciably on scales equivalent to a distance modulus of 0.5 mag '' is not strictly valid at high galactic latitudes because their space density drops away from the galactic disk .",
    "therefore , the cumulative effect of half - magnitude steps from magnitude 13 to 18 in the flynn et al .",
    "analysis might give a spuriously - low completeness .",
    "in fact , a repeat of the analysis on subsamples of the nltt is shown in figure 3 .",
    "the greater `` incompletness '' found at high latitude could be caused by this drop in stellar density away from the disk .",
    "a further exploration of the effect of density variations has been made with a monte - carlo kinematic model of the disk . using realistic values of the velocity ellipsoid , the luminosity function , and the space density profile of red dwarfs , we find that the nltt has 5 - 10% fewer stars at @xmath24 55@xmath3 than would be the case with a uniform space density .",
    "( the exact fraction depends on input parameters , particularly on the assumed velocity dispersion . ) therefore , a portion of the incompleteness found in the flynn et al .",
    "analysis can be explained by this effect .",
    "other effects , such as crowding and reddening at low latitudes , may also be important factors .    our findings in this paper",
    "constrain hypotheses about the possible contribution of white dwarfs to the dynamical or `` dark '' halo , such as alcock et al . ( 2000 ) and ibata et al . (",
    "2000 ) among others have suggested .",
    "an optimistic assumption is that the peak in such a halo white dwarf distribution occurs near m@xmath29 = + 17 to 18 .",
    "flynn et al . ( 2000 ) conclude that , if ibata et al.s ( 2000 ) claim to have discovered several halo white dwarfs in the hubble deep field were correct , that several times that number of similar stars should have been found in the greater search volume accessed by existing ground - based catalogs , principally the lhs .",
    "this might have been possible if the lhs were substantially incomplete . with our finding of a substantially greater completeness for the lhs ,",
    "flynn et al.s conclusion is strengthened .",
    "likewise chabrier s ( 1999 ) models also suggest that dozens of such stars might be detectable out to a distance of 15 pc that even a modest v=18 magnitude limit might permit .",
    "of course hansen ( 1998 ) , chabrier ( 1999 ) and others have shown that  depending on their mass distribution and outer layer compositions  the oldest halo white dwarfs may be much fainter than m@xmath29 = + 17 - 18 and not necessarily detectable to lhs limiting magnitudes .",

    "fields for which the epoch difference was at least 1.5 years between any two plates ( from among the sf , sj , sn , and either of the rejected plates  `` rf '' or `` rj '' ) were selected as eligible for finding high proper motion stars , at galactic latitude ( @xmath46 ) .",
