    "a metasurface is a composite material layer , designed and optimized in order to control and transform electromagnetic fields .",
    "the layer thickness is negligible as compared to the wavelength in the surrounding space .",
    "conventional devices for wave transformations are either bulky and heavy ( e.g. , reflector antennas or lenses ) or complicated and require active elements ( transmitarray antennas , also called array lenses @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , it is quite tempting to become able to realize desired transformations ( for example , focus or refract wave beams ) using extremely thin passive layers .",
    "recently , there has been considerable interest and progress in creating metasurfaces for controlling reflected and transmitted waves , see recent reviews in @xcite .",
    "some limited manipulations of waves transmitted through a thin metasurface can be accomplished due to specifically designed phase gradient over the metasurface plane @xcite .",
    "the required phase gradient is achieved by precise adjustment of the phases of transmitted waves from each metasurface inclusion .",
    "although this approach has enabled realizations of transmitarrays even at optical frequencies , it suffers from very low efficiency ( less than 25% of transmitted power ) and can not provide control of polarization of the transmitted waves ( in fact , it suffers from uncontrollable polarization rotation by @xmath0 ) .",
    "subsequently , another approach based on generalized boundary conditions and the use of symmetric metasurfaces was proposed by several researchers @xcite .",
    "it provided more efficient operation ( more than 80% of transmitted power ) and manipulation of polarization @xcite .",
    "however , even this approach can not ensure ideal performance @xcite , because these symmetric layers can not be matched to impedances of two propagating waves ( incident and transmitted ) in different directions , and , therefore , they inevitably produce some reflections .",
    "most recently , in refs .  @xcite it has been shown that the use of metasurfaces with asymmetric response can open a possibility to realize metasurfaces for perfect refraction .    known structures for manipulating reflection ( both reflectarrays and metasurfaces ) are able to control reflection phase at each point of the reflector surface and nearly fully reflect the incident power .",
    "representative examples can be found in papers @xcite .",
    "it has been believed that these properties can allow full control over reflected waves .",
    "however , it is not the case .",
    "as is shown in the submitted paper @xcite and in this paper , lossless fully reflecting metasurfaces designed to reflect a plane wave into another plane wave , always produce parasitic beams in undesired directions . without proper understanding of the physical properties of metasurfaces responsible for refraction and reflection phenomena",
    "it is not possible to create 100% efficient metasurfaces with desired properties .",
    "here we address this problem by introducing a general approach to the design of metasurfaces for arbitrary manipulations of plane waves , both in transmission and reflection .",
    "we explain the main ideas of the proposed analytical approach to the synthesis of general functional metasurfaces using simple but enough general examples of metasurfaces for refraction or reflection of plane waves into arbitrary directions . in the first example",
    ", a metasurface between two isotropic half - spaces ( generally different ) is designed so that a plane wave incident from one space ( the incidence angle @xmath1 ) is fully refracted into a plane wave propagating in the second space ( the refraction angle @xmath2 ) , without polarization change .",
    "we derive general conditions on the equivalent circuit parameters of the metasurface to ensure perfect refraction while the reflection coefficient is exactly zero ( see section  [ conditions ] ) .",
    "subsequently , we consider three different metasurface scenarios to satisfy these conditions ( sections  [ sec : teleportation ] , [ sec : transmitarray ] , and [ sc3 ] ) .",
    "the latter scenario was independently considered in @xcite . in the second example",
    ", we show how to design metasurfaces which fully reflect plane waves into an arbitrary direction ( the reflection angle @xmath3 ) . in this example",
    ", there are two plane waves coexisting in the space in front of the reflecting metasurface .",
    "this issue complicates the study , but the solution allows us to approach the problem of synthesis of metasurfaces for the most general field transformations , where the main challenge is to account for interference between multiple plane waves .",
    "indeed , any arbitrary field distribution can be represented as a series of plane waves that interfere on both sides of the metasurface . in section  [ sec : power1 ] , we examine conditions on the metasurface parameters for the perfect reflection regime .",
    "similar conditions were obtained independently in @xcite .",
    "next , in sections  [ sc4 ] , [ optdes ] , and [ sc5 ] , we consider different scenarios for metasurface realizations .",
    "we show that perfect control over both refraction and reflection using lossless metasurfaces requires careful engineering of spatial dispersion in the structure . to realize perfect refraction",
    ", we need only weak spatial dispersion in form of the artificial magnetism and bianisotropic omega coupling @xcite .",
    "this effect is described by local relations between the exciting electric and magnetic fields and the induced polarizations in the unit cells .",
    "perfect control over reflection using lossless metasurfaces appears to be possible only using strongly non - local metasurfaces : part of the power received in one area of the surface should be `` channelled '' and re - radiated at a different part of the surface .",
    "lossless local - response metasurfaces ( that is , conventional reflectarrays and earlier studied metamirrors ) can not create a perfect reflected plane wave in any direction except the specular and retro directions .",
    "the results clarify the necessary physical properties of metasurfaces for ideal wave refraction and reflection and explain the limitations of earlier used design methods and earlier studied realizations in form of electric and magnetic sheets , inhomogeneous high impedance surfaces and reflectarrays .",
    "possible routes towards realization of ideal and full control over refraction and reflection are identified and discussed .",
    "as a first step we consider the problem of synthesis of metasurfaces for control of transmitted waves .",
    "we require that a given plane wave is fully refracted into another plane wave , without reflections or energy loss .",
    "the geometry of the problem is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ geom ] .",
    "the metasurface is located in the @xmath4-plane between two isotropic half - spaces with the characteristic impedances @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "we assume , without loss of generality of the approach , a transverse electric ( te , with respect to the normal to the surface ) incident plane wave .",
    "our approach can be used for waves of arbitrary polarizaitons , including arbitrary polarization transformations , by using the dyadic parameters instead of the scalar ones .",
    "let us assume that the metasurface is illuminated from medium 1 by a plane wave ( with the wavenumber @xmath7 and the electric field vector @xmath8 ) at an angle @xmath1 .",
    "requiring zero reflections , the tangential field components @xmath9 and @xmath10 on the illuminated side of the metasurface ( at @xmath11 ) read _ e_t1=_e_ie^-jk_1_iz,_n_h_t1= _",

    "we want to synthesize a metasurface which will transform this incident wave into a refracted wave propagating in medium 2 ( characterized by parameters @xmath15 , @xmath6 ) in some other direction , specified by the angle @xmath2 , without any loss of power .",

    "this method was used for a long time in antenna engineering ( e.g. @xcite ) and more recently in designs of metasurfaces , both in microwaves ( e.g. @xcite ) and optics ( e.g. @xcite ) . however",
    ", this approach does not lead to the desired perfect refraction @xcite , and next we will explain how the desired performance can be realized exactly .",
    "first , let us find the amplitude of the transmitted wave @xmath17 which corresponds to full power transmission through the metasurface .",
    "looking for possible realizations as metasurfaces with local response , we equate the normal ( to the metasurface ) components of the poynting vector at each point of the metasurfaces , in the two media : ( _ e_t1_h_t1^ * ) = 12re(_e_t2_h_t2^ * ) , and substitute the field values from and . as a result , for metasurfaces with locally full power transmission we obtain _ e_t=_e_i.amp_trnote that the amplitude of the transmitted wave can be larger or smaller than the amplitude of the incident plane wave , although the metasurface is lossless and the power is conserved in transmission .",
    "this result already tells about a limitation of the mentioned above simple design approach based only on engineering the transmission phase according to .",
    "let us write the linear relations between the tangential fields at the two sides of the metasurface in form of an impedance matrix : _",
    "e_t1=z_11 _ n_h_t1 + z_12 ( -_n_h_t2 ) , 11 - 12 _ e_t2=z_21",

    ", we will be able to determine suitable topologies of constitutive elements ( the unit - cell structures ) which will realize the desired functionality .",
    "furthermore , the use of the equivalent @xmath20-circuit ( fig .  [ t ] ) helps in understanding what physical properties the metasurface should have in order to provide the desired response .    substituting the field values from , , and",
    ", we get the following equations for the @xmath19-parameters : @xmath21 @xmath22 obviously , there are infinitely many solutions for the unknown @xmath19-parameters , because we have only two conditions imposed on four complex parameters .",
    "note that solutions with complex values of impedance parameters mean that some of the components forming the metasurface are either lossy or active , but all these solutions still correspond to the _ overall lossless _ response of the metasurface , because the fields on the two sides of the metasurface form plane waves carrying the same power in both upper and lower half - spaces .",
    "this observation suggests that we can impose some restrictions on the values of the equivalent parameters of the metasurface for a specific transformation and achieve different realizations of metasurfaces which all perform the same operation on incident plane waves .",
    "the possibility of multiple realizations of arbitrary metasurfaces using the susceptibility model was discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "considering equations and , we observe that while the left - hand sides are single exponential functions ( corresponding to either incident or transmitted wave ) , the right - hand sides are sums of two different exponential functions .",
    "this property indicates that in general the @xmath19-parameters of the metasurface will depend on the coordinate @xmath12 , that is , the metasurface is , in general , not uniform .",
    "however , there is an interesting and conceptually simple solution corresponding to a _ homogeneous _ metasurface . if we assume that @xmath23 , then both equations are satisfied with z_11=_1_i , z_22=-_2_t . in this scenario , the metasurface is formed by a matched absorbing layer ( the input resistance @xmath24 , a perfect electric conductor ( pec ) sheet , and an active layer ( an `` anti - absorber '' @xcite ) on the other side .",
    "the incident plane wave is totally absorbed in the matched absorber .",
    "the negative - resistance sheet ( resistance @xmath25 ) together with the wave impedance of medium 2 forms a self - oscillating system whose stable - generation regime corresponds to generation of a plane wave in the desired direction ( the refraction angle @xmath2 ) . indeed , the sum of the wave impedance of plane waves propagating at the angle @xmath2 and the input impedance of the active layer is zero , and this is the necessary condition for stable generation .",
    "this structure is similar to the `` teleportation metasurface '' introduced in @xcite for teleporting waves without changing the propagation direction . as shown in @xcite , in that case if the reflector separating the resistive and active layers is made at least slightly imperfect ( parameters @xmath26 are very small but not exactly zero ) , the amplitude and phase of the transmitted wave is synchronised with the incident field .",
    "the teleportation metasurface is a theoretically perfect realization of the desired transformation of plane waves in transmission . in particular ,",
    "when the incidence angle equals @xmath1 , the reflection coefficient is exactly zero .",
    "however , because the input resistance of the metasurface seen from medium 2 is negative , reflections of waves coming from this medium are very strong .",
    "therefore , within the linear model of the negative resistance , the reflection coefficient tends to infinity for waves coming from the direction @xmath2 .",
    "moreover , the amplitude of the field in medium 2 is established due to non - linear saturation of the negative resistance device .",
    "therefore , it is probably practically impossible to ensure that the negative resistance saturates at exactly the desired amplitude of the generated wave .",
    "next , we consider an alternative realization , requiring perfect matching of the metasurface for waves coming from medium 2 .",
    "let us consider alternative realizations demanding that the input impedance of the metasurface seen from medium 2 is matched to the wave impedance in medium 2 , so that waves coming from the direction @xmath2 will not produce any reflections .",
    "this requirement can be satisfied if we demand that z_22=_2_t.now we can find a realization of the metasurface as a nonreciprocal system where the ideal voltage source in the output branch is defined by z_21=2 e^-j(k_2_t - k_1_i)z+j _ t , as follows from .",
    "if the desired response for illumination from medium 1 is the only requirement , we can set @xmath27 and @xmath28 , so that for illuminations from medium 1 at the incidence angle @xmath1 the metasurface is acting as a matched absorber ( matched receiving antenna array ) .",
    "this realization can be modeled by the corresponding nonreciprocal equivalent circuit , shown in fig .",
    "[ t_nonrec ] .",
    "this realization reminds conventional transmitarrays @xcite .",
    "the incident plane wave is received by a matched antenna array on one side of the surface and the wave is launched into medium 2 with a transmitting phase array antenna . in the ideal situation the transmitarray is overall lossless , as the resistance seen from the illuminated side is in fact the radiation resistance of the transmitting array ( the two arrays need to be connected by matched cables ) .",
    "the same model describes also the concept of field control and active cloaking using active huygens surfaces @xcite . in that scenario",
    ", there is no connection between the receiving side ( realized as a matched absorber ) and the active array .",
    "the incident field is assumed to be known and the amplitudes and phases of sources feeding the radiating array are set accordingly .      within the metasurface paradigm , the simplest approach to realization of refractive metasurfaces",
    "is to assume that the refraction is controlled by engineering surface densities of electric and magnetic current sheets , co - existing at the metasurface plane .",
    "it is obvious that sheets of _ only _ electric or _ only _ magnetic currents can not offer the desired functionality because of the symmetry of the scattered fields in the forward and backward directions .",
    "because electric and magnetic surface current sheets are conveniently modeled by surface impedance relations , it appears reasonable to model refractive metasurfaces by two impedance relations which should hold both for the electric and magnetic surface current densities @xmath29 and @xmath30 @xcite : _ j_e=_n_h_t1-_n_h_t2=y_e_e_t = y_e_e_t1+_e_t22,je_j_m=-_n(_e_t1-_e_t2)=y_m_h_t = y_m_h_t1 + _ h_t22.jm here @xmath31 and @xmath32 are",
    "the averaged tangential electric and magnetic fields at the metasurface plane .",
    "forming sums and differences of and , it is easy to see that relations and can hold only if the metasurface is symmetric and reciprocal , that is , when @xmath33 and @xmath26 . under these assumptions , y_e=2z_11+z_12 , y_m=2(z_11-z_12 ) .",
    "yem since we have only two unknown complex parameters @xmath34 and @xmath35 , the solution of and becomes unique and it reads z_11=_1_i , z_ap2z_12= _ 1 _ t_2_i+1 e^-j_t- _ 1 _ t_2_ie^j_t , z_ap1where @xmath36 is defined by .",
    "we see that these parameters , as well as the electric sheet admittance and magnetic sheet impedance , are complex numbers , which physically means that the surface is either lossy or active at different values of @xmath12 .",
    "for a special case of refraction of a normally incident plane wave at @xmath37 such solution for sheet parameters has been published in @xcite and later on discussed in e.g. @xcite .",
    "inspecting and , we see that the metasurface parameters can be purely imaginary for all @xmath12 , corresponding to passive lossless realizations , only if = 1,elefth_conditionin which case z_12=j_1_i1_t , z_11=j_1_i_t.corresponding surface admittances , given by , are also purely imaginary and coincide with those derived in @xcite in an alternative way .",
    "condition physically means that the impedance of the incident plane wave at the top side of the metasurface ( @xmath38 ) equals to the impedance of the refracted wave at the bottom side of the surface ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "it is , however , in contradiction with the desired field structure : equations and imply that the ratio of the tangential field components ( the wave impedance ) must in general change if we require perfect refraction .",
    "thus , lossless double current sheets modeled by impedance relations and can not realize perfectly refractive metasurfaces .    in paper @xcite the requirement for equal impedances",
    "was derived in a different way , demanding the absence of losses , and it was concluded that perfect refraction using lossless metasurfaces was not possible without reflections .",
    "indeed , it is clear that adding some reflected field to , it is possible to make sure that the ratio of the tangential fields on top of the metasurface is the same as at the bottom .",
    "this approach is followed nearly in all current literature on lossless metasurfaces for refraction control : nearly always only symmetric metasurfaces have been considered and used ( see @xcite ) and the realization is thought in form of a symmetric double - current sheet .",
    "this is the reason why earlier publications ( see the review in @xcite ) state that there must be at least small reflections or there is a need to use active elements .",
    "the only known to us exception is the recent paper @xcite where the problem is attacked using the generalized scattering matrix .    next we show that perfect refraction at an angle which is not equal to the incidence angle is in fact possible using only lossless structures , but only if the surface is spatially dispersive , exhibiting bianisotropic omega coupling .",
    "this result has been independently obtained in @xcite .      in the above example realizations ,",
    "metasurfaces contained both lossy and active elements , which may require complicated and expensive realizations .",
    "it is therefore of interest to consider if and how one can realize the same functionality using only reactive lossless components .      to answer this question",
    ", we again consider the main set of requirements on the @xmath19-parameters of an ideal refractive metasurface and and look for a solution where all the @xmath19-parameters are purely imaginary ( i.e. , @xmath40 ) : @xmath41 @xmath42 this is a system of four real - valued equations for four real unknowns @xmath43 , which has a unique solution : x_11=_1_i_t , x11x_22=_2_t_t , x22x_12=x_21= 1_t .x12 for the case of zero phase shift ( @xmath44 ) formulas  agree with the result of @xcite , obtained using the generalized scattering parameters approach .",
    "the metasurfaces modeled by  are reciprocal ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "indeed , the same solution follows from  if we demand that a plane wave coming from the second medium ( the incidence angle @xmath2 ) is fully transmitted into the first medium in the direction @xmath1 .",
    "the required physical properties of such metasurfaces can be understood from the corresponding equivalent @xmath20-circuit ( see fig .  [ t ] ) .",
    "the circuit is asymmetric , because @xmath46 .",
    "this structure of the @xmath19-matrix corresponds to bianisotropic omega layers , see a discussion in @xcite .",
    "possible appropriate topologies include arrays of @xmath47-shaped inclusions  @xcite , arrays of split rings , double arrays of patches ( patches on the opposite sides of the substrate must be different to ensure proper magnetoelectric coupling ) @xcite , etc .",
    "a more complicated set of three parallel reactive sheets was proposed in @xcite .",
    "previuosly , probably only in paper @xcite asymmetric metasurfaces were used for transmission management ( equations  also appear in @xcite for the case when @xmath44 ) .",
    "note also that the role of the omega - type bianisotropy of metasurfaces has been discussed in the review paper @xcite , and omega layers have been successfully used in single - layer metamirrors @xcite .    comparing to the simple designs based on symmetrical metasurfaces ( section  [ sec : symmetrical ] ) , we again see from and that lossless _ symmetric",
    "_ realizations with @xmath48 are possible only if @xmath49 , as we already saw from requirement .",
    "if media @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the same , we can conclude that previously proposed symmetrical metasurfaces can not provide perfect refraction ( without parasitic reflections or energy loss ) .",
    "although the impedance matrix model provides a simple tool to design structures for desired wave transformations , it is not directly applicable for identifying appropriate topologies of the metasurface unit cells .",
    "here we show how to determine what are the required properties of unit cells which realize ideally refractive metasurfaces . knowing the polarizabilities of each unit cell , we can identify what polarization response should be generated in unit cells and what inclusions are needed to realize this response .",
    "so - called collective polarizabilities @xcite relate the tangential electric and magnetic dipole moments induced in the unit cell to the fields of the incident wave . knowing the @xmath19-parameters of a metasurface is tantamount to knowing reflection and transmission coefficients .",
    "writing them also in terms of the collective polarizabilities of unit cells , we can find the required polarizabilities which realize the desired response .",
    "for the perfect refractive metasurfaces the collective polarizabilities of unit cells read ( see @xcite)_ee^yy= , aee_tr_mm^zz= , aeemm_tr_em^yz=-_me^zy= , aem_tr where @xmath52 is the unit - cell area and @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 are , respectively , electric , magnetic , electromagnetic , and magnetoelectric polarizability components ( coupling coefficients ) .",
    "the last two coefficients @xmath55 and @xmath56 imply so - called bianisotropic response in the unit cells which models the effect of weak spatial dispersion @xcite .",
    "in other words , the incident electric ( magnetic ) field should induce also magnetic ( electric ) polarization in the unit cell . here ,",
    "@xmath57 , which is a typical characteristic of reciprocal _",
    "inclusions @xcite .    as it can be expected , both the electric and magnetic polarizabilities in and depend on @xmath12 , and this dependence is the same for both of them .",
    "this result reflects the requirement of zero reflection at any point of the metasurface , which demands the balance of the induced electric and magnetic surface currents at any point ( huygens condition ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the omega coupling coefficient in is constant with respect to @xmath12 and depends only on the impedances and angles .",
    "this result reflects the fact that bianisotropic coupling of omega - type is necessary to ensure that the waves incident on both sides of the metasurface see the same surface impedance , so that reciprocal full transmission is realized .",
    "since the impedances of the two waves depend only on the impedances of the media and on the two angles , the coupling coefficient also depends only on these parameters .",
    "as expected , we see that when the impedances of the incident and transmitted waves are the same , that is , @xmath49 , the required coupling coefficient vanishes .",
    "bianisotropic metasurfaces with the required properties defined by  can be realized as arrays of low - loss particles with the appropriate symmetry .",
    "as it was mentioned , for microwave applications , metallic canonical omega particles or double arrays of asymmetric patches can be used .",
    "multilayered topologies were proposed in paper @xcite . for optical applications ,",
    "arrays of properly shaped dielectric particles were introduced as omega - type bianisotropic metasurfaces @xcite .",
    "it is important to compare the polarizabilities  which are required for realizing perfect refraction with the polarizabilities found in earlier works on wave transformations in the transmitting regime ( e.g. , @xcite ) , where the design approach is based on the geometrical optics model and the `` generalized law of refraction '' . in that theory , the metasurface",
    "is assumed to be locally periodical , and the unit cells are designed so that the transmission coefficient has unit amplitude and the desired phase at every point .",

    "periodical arrays formed by unit cells having these collective polarizabilities have unit transmissivity and the transmitted waves have the required phases @xmath58 , but when the cells are assembled into a non - uniform array , the performance becomes non - ideal .",
    "in other words , in order to ensure the desired response of the non - uniform metasurface , properties of periodical arrays formed by its unit cells must deviate from the simple geometrical - optics design recipe .",
    "this result is consistent with that in @xcite .",
    "we can conclude that in order to ensure perfect refraction , it is not enough to make the metasuface bianisotropic ( introducing asymmetry with respect to its two sides ) .",
    "the electric and magnetic polarizabilities in the exact synthesis [ see  ] solution are also different as compared to the conventional synthesis solution .",
    "in the previous case of refractive metasurfaces , there is only one single plane wave at every point of space . in order to be able to synthesize metasurfaces for general field transformations ,",
    "we need to understand how to control several plane waves which propagate and interfere in the same space . this problem can be solved at an example of a perfectly reflective metasurface , which we consider next .",

    "similarly to the refractive metasurface , we see that the phase of the reflection coefficient _",

    "the same expression tells also that it is possible to reflect a plane wave into only one plane wave along a specified direction if we allow energy loss in the metasurface . to understand this conclusion ,",
    "let us look for such _ constant _ amplitude of the reflected wave @xmath68 which ensures that @xmath69 for all @xmath12 ( negative values of @xmath70 corresponds to flow of power into the surface , where it is absorbed ) .",
    "obviously , this condition can be satisfied if @xmath71 , since with this amplitude of the reflected field we have p_n = e_i^22_1 ( _ r - _ i ) .alu_case since @xmath72 is non - negative , @xmath70 is negative or zero at all points of the metasurface @xmath12 if @xmath73 .",
    "this realization scenario was introduced in @xcite .",
    "for instance , if the metamirror is excited by a normally incident plane wave ( @xmath74 ) , it is possible to create a single reflected plane wave along any direction , because @xmath75 for any @xmath3 .",
    "however , as is seen from eq .  , the amount of power which is lost in the metasurface increases with increasing difference between the incidence and reflection angles . in the limit of @xmath76 , which corresponds to @xmath77 and @xmath78 ,",
    "all incident power is completely absorbed .",
    "figure  [ fig_efficomp ] ( dashed line ) shows the efficiency of this scenario as a function of the reflection angle @xmath3 .    the efficiency @xmath79 is defined as the ratio of the plane - wave power carried into the desired direction @xmath80 to the power of the incident plane wave @xmath81 . as it is clear from and this figure , increasing the reflection angle results in decreasing the efficiency by a factor of @xmath82 ( notice that @xmath71 ) .",
    "actually , ideal reflection into a single plane wave without losing any power is possible , but only if we allow periodical flow of power into the metamirror structure and back into space .",
    "this conclusion is also evident from formula .",
    "indeed , we see that if the amplitude of the reflected plane wave equals @xmath83 the normal component of the poynting vector is a periodical function with zero average value : p_n = e_i^22_1 ( _ r-_i)_r(z ) .",
    "mod_powerthe metasurface performs the desired function perfectly , but the response must be _ strongly non - local _ : the power which enters the metasurface structure in the areas where @xmath84 must be launched back from the areas where @xmath85 .",
    "alternatively , the perfect reflection can be achieved if the metasurface has active and lossy elements ( being overall lossless in the average over the surface area ) .",
    "we see again that there is no power flow into the metamirror at any point only if @xmath65 , in agreement with the previous conclusion .",
    "following the introduced synthesis approach based on the impedance matrix , we write the linear relation between the tangential fields at the metamirror surface . assuming that the metamirror is a boundary and the fields behind it are zero ( @xmath86 , @xmath87 )",

    "figure  [ z11_a ] presents the required input impedance for the case when @xmath90 and @xmath91 .     of the ideal metamirror for @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 .",

    "the surface _ acts _ as if it is lossy close to the regions where the reactive impedance is high ( close to the regime of a perfect magnetic conductor , pmc ) and active in the areas where the reactance is small ( close to a perfect electric conductor , pec ) . importantly , this behaviour does not imply that the surface can not be passive or lossless .",
    "we stress that , on the contrary , properly tuned metasurface with strongly non - local response can emulate such a metamirror : the power which passes through the input surface in the `` lossy '' regions is not absorbed but it is re - radiated from the `` active '' regions . another possibility to realize the ideal performance dictated by impedance could be a metasurface with truly active and lossy elements where only the overall response is lossless .     for passive metamirrors in the case",

    "one period of the metamirror along the @xmath12-coordinate is shown .",
    "the solid , dashed , and dotted lines correspond , respectively , to the lossy metamirrors [ eq .  ] , the lossless metamirrors creating two reflected plane waves [ eq .  ] , and the conventional non - uniform reflectors [ eq .  ] . ]    as discussed in section  [ sec : power1 ] , it is possible to eliminate the need to realize active input impedance ( which increases the realization complexities ) , at the expense of losing some part of the incident power in the metamirror .",
    "the surface impedance of such a lossy metasurface , which creates a single plane wave in the desired direction , can be found from upon substitution of the reflected field amplitude @xmath93 .",
    "the result reads z_11=_1e^-jk_1_iz + e^-jk_1_rz+j_r _ i e^-jk_1_iz-_r e^-jk_1_rz+j_r z11_alu_case . an example is plotted as a function of the coordinate in fig .",
    "[ z11_alu ] ( the solid lines ) . as it is seen , the real part of the impedance is always non - negative , corresponding to the absorbed power given by .",
    "so far we have demonstrated that a surface having the input impedance produces a single ( non - modulated ) reflected wave in the desired direction if the power loss in the metamirror is allowed [ see fig .",
    "[ fig_efficomp ] ] .",
    "however , depending on the application requirements , it can be preferable to allow some modulation of the reflected wave but reduce the power loss . in the next section",
    ", we present a scenario in which the metamirror is lossless at every point , and at the same time the reflections into non - desired directions are reduced .",
    "it is possible to optimize the reactance @xmath94@xmath95 profile of a lossless metamirror in order to minimize reflections into non - desired directions based on particular optimization criteria .",
    "as one example , we notice that there is an interesting lossless design , where all the power which can not be sent into the desired reflection direction @xmath3 is reflected into the specular direction . to demonstrate this possibility",
    ", we consider the situation when the difference between the incidence angle @xmath1 and @xmath3 is large , so that only three propagating plane waves can exist in the floquet spectrum of the propagating reflected field @xcite _ r = _ n=-2 ^ 0e_n e^-jk_1 z. floq for the normal illumination ( @xmath74 ) , this corresponds to @xmath3 larger than @xmath96 .",
    "it is easy to check that a set of three plane waves : the incident wave , the wave reflected into the desired direction ( @xmath97 ) , and the parasitic plane wave reflected into the specular direction ( @xmath98 ) exactly satisfy the boundary condition with a purely reactive impedance z_11(z)=j_1_r , 2waves if the wave reflected in the desired direction @xmath3 is given by e_0=e_i2_i_i+_r , and the wave reflected into the specular direction @xmath1 is e_-1=e_i_i-_r_i+_r.the amplitude of the floquet harmonic @xmath99 is equal to zero , and the evanescent part of the spectrum also vanishes .",
    "these amplitudes have been found by requiring that the normal component of the poynting vector is identically zero at the surface . in this case , the metasurface is lossless and exhibits no strong spatial dispersion .",
    "reciprocally , we can conclude that 100% power reflection in the desired direction can be achieved by illuminating the metasurface by two plane waves at once , properly selecting their relative amplitudes , phases , and propagation directions .",
    "it is interesting that the efficiency of transformation of the incident plane wave into the desired reflected plane wave is much better than for the passive lossy scenario ( presented in section  [ sec : power1 ] ) where the parasitic reflections were absent .",
    "this conclusion is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig_efficomp ] by comparing the efficiencies of these two cases .",
    "the conventional approach for designing lossless non - uniform reflectors is based on the `` generalized reflection law '' , which corresponds to a linear phase variation along the metasurface . in that approach",
    ", the measurface is designed so that the _ local _ reflection coefficient at every point has unit amplitude and the phase as dictated by .",
    "the local reflection coefficient is defined for an infinite uniform array , that is , the input impedance can be found from @xmath100 where @xmath101 and @xmath64 is given by .",
    "the result reads z_11=j_1_i , viki2 and an example is plotted in fig .",
    "[ z11_alu ] .",
    "one can see that the required surface impedance in the conventional reflectors is different from that of the lossless metamirror described by . in the conventional reflectors ,",
    "the reflected wave has a complex structure : generally , several propagating plane waves in different directions and some evanescent fields localized close to the surface are excited . to study the field structure",
    ", one can use numerical simulations or the theoretical technique exploited for the case of refraction in @xcite .      making use of the boundary conditions on the reflecting metasurface which tell that the tangential electric and magnetic fields are equal , correspondingly , to the surface magnetic and electric current densities , we can find relations between the surface impedance @xmath34 and the collective polarizabilities of unit cells of the metamirror ( see @xcite ) : + = ( _ 1_ee^yy+_em^yz ) , pol1z_11 + = ( _ 1_mm^zz-_em^yz ) .",
    "pol2here @xmath52 is the unit - cell area .",
    "obviously , these equations have infinitely many solutions for polarizabilities which realize the desired response .",
    "the metasurface can be either bianisotropic ( omega coupling ) or it can be a non - bianisotropic pair of electric and magnetic current sheets .",

    "the use of bianisotropy offers additional design flexibilities .",
    "knowing the collective polarizabilities required for the desired performance we can immediately see what are the appropriate topologies of unit cells . since we need both electric and magnetic polarizations , the physical thickness of the reflecting layer must be different from zero , to allow formation of tangential magnetic moments in unit cells .",
    "for example , it is not possible to realize the desired performance by any patterning of a single , infinitesimally thin sheet of a perfect conductor .",
    "the non - bianisotropic realization scenario suggests the use of a single array of small particles which are polarizable both electrically and magnetically , such as small metal spirals as in @xcite . a typical realization based on the bianisotropic route is a high - impedance surface with a pec ground plane ( such as `` mushroom layers '' @xcite ) .",
    "an important advantage in using bianisotropic effects is the relaxed requirement on the strength of the magnetic response . especially for optical applications ,",
    "it is easier to realize strong bianisotropy ( which is a first - order dispersion effect ) as compared with the artificial magnetism ( which is a weaker , second - order effect ) @xcite .",
    "we have seen that all local lossless non - uniform reflectors modulate the reflected waves , which reduces the power efficiency in the desired direction .",
    "the operation of conventional planar reflectors ( such as high impedance surfaces @xcite , reflective diffraction gratings @xcite , and reflectarrays @xcite ) are similar in this respect .",
    "next we discuss the potentials of ideal metamirrors based on non - local and non - reciprocal surfaces .",
    "as shown above , it is possible to synthesise an _ overall _ lossless metamirror which would create an _ unmodulated _ reflected wave into any desired direction , satisfying the requirement ( [ eq : plusmirror ] ) exactly , with a constant value of the reflected plane wave amplitude @xmath68 .",
    "this goal can be achieved if we require that the normal component of the poynting vector on the metasurface is zero only in the average over the metamirror period , and not necessarily is equal to zero at every point . in this case , the amplitude of the plane wave reflected into the desired direction is given by , and the normal component of the poynting vector oscillates , according to eq .  .",
    "realization of such metamirrors requires absorption of power in some areas of the surface and generation of power in some other areas or , alternatively , power channelling from one area to the other .",
    "conceptually , this scenario of balanced loss and gain can be realized using the same two approaches which were found in the analysis of perfectly refractive metasurfaces : teleportation metasurface ( section  [ sec : teleportation ] ) and transmitarrays ( section  [ sec : transmitarray ] ) . in the former approach",
    ", one can envisage a realization in form of an array of small receiving antennas loaded by positive resistors in the areas where the energy should be partially absorbed , and by negative resistors where the energy should be launched back into space . this arrangement is similar to the teleportation metasurface described in section  [ sec : teleportation ] , where such arrays were positioned at the two opposite sides of a metal screen .",
    "alternatively , one can envisage a similar array of antennas , where the antennas of the absorbing areas are connected by cables to the antennas of the active areas .",
    "thus , the power received at the absorbing areas is re - radiated by the active areas .",
    "it is important to note that both these devices should be non - reciprocal , as the `` active '' antennas should radiate power but not receive it back from space .",
    "actual realization of both these concepts is a challenging task . as to the teleportation approach",
    ", one needs non - reciprocal antennas , which can be in principle realized using non - reciprocal materials like magnetized ferrites or using active components .",
    "there is also an interesting possibility to use parametric circuits for the same purpose @xcite .",
    "the non - reciprocal transmitarray approach in principle can be realized also in reflecting metasurfaces , using non - reciprocal circuits inside the metasurface , but it appears that the use of spatial modulation of the surface impedance by external forces ( using unit cells equipped with varactors , for example ) , is more promising .",
    "conceptually , the desired performance can be achieved by modulating ( for example ) varactors in all unit cells with the same amplitude but with different phases . controlling the spatial distribution of the modulation phase",
    ", one can possibly realize parameteric amplification or absorption according to the design specifications .",
    "initial work on space - time modulated metasurfaces @xcite produced interesting and promising results , and we expect that developing this route may lead to realizations of theoretically perfectly operating lossless non - uniform metasurfaces .",
    "in the previous section , we considered metamirrors which reflect an incident plane wave into a desired direction .",
    "however , we encountered either active - lossy realizations of the metamirror or lossless reflection of modulated waves . in this section ,",
    "we introduce a new solution for a lossless metamirror which ideally reflects the incident wave into the desired direction without any modulations .",
    "since the main reason for modulations of reflected waves is interference between the incident and reflected fields , we construct a metamirror which reflects waves with the polarization orthogonal to that of the incident wave . as a simple canonical example",

    "the proper values of the cross - components @xmath109 and @xmath110 ensure the polarization rotation , and , finally , @xmath111 is responsible for reflection with the orthogonal polarization in the desired direction .",
    "next , we apply the condition for power conservation ( we demand that the normal component of the poynting vector identically equals zero at the metasurface plane at each point to ensure local response ) to find the required reflection coefficient @xmath112 .",
    "this condition reads @xmath113 which defines the reflection coefficient for the perfect reflection regime : r^zy= .rzy as it is clear from , realization of this scenario is possible with purely lossless metasurface elements .",
    "moreover , since the reflected field does not interfere with the incident one , there is no field modulation .",
    "therefore , the proposed metamirror provides an ideal and single reflecting wave .      following the procedure outlined in sections  [ polref11 ] , we can find the relations for collective polarizabilities of unit cells of the proposed metamirror in the case of perfectly reflecting polarizers ( see @xcite for details ) : 1 = ( _ 1_mm^zz+_me^zy ) , polrot1r^zye^j_r = - ( _ 1_mm^yz+_me^yy ) , polrot2 = ( _ 1_em^yz+_ee^yy ) , polrot3 = - ( _ 1_em^zz+_ee^zy ) .",

    "alternatively , another simple solution of system  can be found by suppressing the cross polarizability components ( i.e. , @xmath119 ) .",

    "one can note a similarity of the conditions on the polarizabilities  with those used earlier for realizing polarization transformers @xcite and absorbers @xcite . here",
    "we see that the amplitudes of the polarizabilities should be balanced ( as shown in @xcite for the normal incidence ) , and the ideal reflector operation is ensured by proper adjustments of the chirality parameter phase .",
    "these solutions are only two possibilities , selected for their simplicity .",
    "other solutions are possible considering .",
    "in this paper we have introduced a general approach to the synthesis of metasurfaces for arbitrary manipulations of plane waves . we have explained the main ideas of the method on two canonical examples : a metasurface which perfectly refracts plane waves incident at an arbitrary angle @xmath1 into plane waves propagating in an arbitrary direction defined by the angle @xmath2 , and a metasurface which fully reflects a given plane wave into an arbitrary direction @xmath3 .",
    "the general synthesis approach shows a possibility for alternative physical realizations , and we have discussed different possible device realizations : self - oscillating teleportation metasurfaces , non - local metasurfaces , and metasurfaces formed by only lossless components . the crucial role of omega - type bianisotropy in the design of lossless - component realizations of perfectly refractive surfaces has been revealed .",
    "the conventional approach to realization of refractive and reflecting metasurfaces as well as both transmitarray and reflectarray antennas is based on requiring full power transmission or reflection at each point of the surface and providing complete phase control over the transmitted and reflected waves .",
    "we have clarified the role of modifications in the required phase gradient for conventional planar refractive / reflective structures in gaining higher efficiencies .",
    "moreover , we have revealed fundamental limitations of this classical technique and showed how the ideal performance can be realized . for full control over transmission , weak spatial dispersion in form of bianisotropic coupling",
    "is necessary , while ideal lossless reflectarray operation calls for the use of structures with a strongly non - local response to the incident fields or structures that transform polarization of reflected waves .",
    "we think that the reason why the role of metasurface bianisotropy in controlling refraction has not been appreciated earlier is that in this field transformation the wave polarization should not change , and it appears natural to expect that bianisotropic effects , such as chirality , are not needed . however , as we have shown here , omega coupling effects , which do not change polarization , are crucial in engineering perfectly matched lossless refractive metasurfaces .",
    "in contrast to perfectly refracting metasurfaces , creation of perfectly reflecting surfaces requires careful control over the interference of the incident and reflected waves .",
    "we have shown that ideal transformation of an incident plane wave into a reflected plane wave propagating at an angle different from what is dictated by the usual reflection law requires either active structures or passive lossless non - local metasurfaces .",
    "we have discussed the structure of reflected fields and proposed an optimal compromise realization using local and passive metasurfaces .    in the last part of the paper we have shown that the requirement of strong spatial dispersion or active inclusions for realization of perfect metamirrors can be lifted if the polarization of the reflected wave is orthogonal to that of the incident field . in this case",
    "there is no interference between the incident and reflected wave , and perfect reflection can be realized using only weak spatial dispersion effects ( artificial magnetism and chirality ) , similarly to ideally refractive metasurfaces .    since",
    "any exciting fields can be expressed in form of a plane - wave expansion , the developed approach can be generalized to metasurfaces for the most general field transformations .",
    "we hope that understanding of the physical requirements for perfect metasurface operation in both transmission and reflection regime as well as the developed synthesis method will open a way for design and realization of ultimately thin composite sheets for a broad range of applications , such as lenses , antennas , sensors , etc .",
    "we would like to note that during the review process of this paper a related preprint @xcite has been published , which describes a conceptual realization of perfectly reflecting lossless metasurfaces in form of a set of three parallel reactive sheets .",
