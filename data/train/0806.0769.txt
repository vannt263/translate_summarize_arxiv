    "an important experimental and theoretical effort has been pursued over the last fifteen years aiming at constraining the gluon density in a proton , @xmath9 .",
    "the current precision on @xmath10 has reached a few percent level at not too large nor not too small values of bjorken-@xmath0 , @xmath11 , and at large virtualities , @xmath12  gev@xmath6 . lacking a similar facility such as hera using heavy ion beams , the gluon density in a nucleus , @xmath13  ( see  e.g.  @xcite )   or equivalently",
    "the normalised nuclear gluon distribution ratio @xmath14   is determined with a poor accuracy , say @xmath15 , and only for rather large values of @xmath0 , @xmath16 . as a consequence ,",
    "the precision level for perturbative qcd cross sections in nuclear collisions ( @xmath1a or a  a ) presently taken at rhic or soon to be taken at the lhc is far from that achieved in @xmath1@xmath17 and @xmath1@xmath1 collisions at tevatron and lhc .",
    "let us also mention that probing accurately @xmath18 is also interesting in itself in order to shed light on non - linear evolution expected in qcd at small @xmath0 ; a field which has recently received a lot of attention ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "for these reasons , any way leading to a better control of the gluon nuclear density needs to be considered and properly quantified . based on a recent study  @xcite , we explored in this talk how the production of prompt photons in hadron ",
    "nucleus reactions at rhic and lhc may serve as a sensitive probe of @xmath19 .    at leading - order ( lo ) in @xmath20 ,",
    "large-@xmath21 prompt photon production proceeds either via the annihilation process , @xmath22 , or by compton scattering , @xmath23 .",
    "note however that , below @xmath24 , the former channel is less than @xmath25 of the latter . for clarity purposes ,",
    "let us consider it to be negligible in the following . in the collinear factorisation framework , the inclusive production cross section in @xmath1a collisions",
    "can simply be expressed as a product of parton distribution functions .",
    "this scale dependence does not play an important role in the present discussion and is therefore not made explicit in the following . ] ( pdf ) , in the proton and in the nucleus , times the partonic cross section , @xmath26 :  @xcite @xmath27\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the sum over the quark flavours is implicit in the definition of @xmath28 .",
    "the integral over @xmath29 , stemming from the rapidity of the unobserved gluon recoiling jet , @xmath30asinh@xmath31 $ ] , therefore spoils the simple relationship between the observable on the one hand , and the nuclear parton densities   which we would like to constrain   on the other hand .",
    "however , as noticed in  @xcite , the fairly slow variation of @xmath32 and @xmath33 with @xmath0 as compared to that of the pdfs themselves allows eq .",
    "( [ eq : qcdloxs ] ) to be approximated by : @xmath34 where we used the fact that the integral is dominated by @xmath35 . within this approximation ,",
    "the inclusive prompt photon cross section is simply a linear combination of @xmath36 and @xmath37 , both being evaluated at @xmath38 .",
    "the above relationship simplifies even further in three kinematic limits . at mid - rapidity , @xmath39 , while we have @xmath40 at forward rapidity , and @xmath41 at backward rapidity .",
    "the last two inequalities arise from the dynamics of partons inside the proton : large-@xmath0 is dominated by valence while gluons are dominant at small @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , photons produced at large positive ( respectively , negative ) rapidity necessarily originate from the scattering of a valence quark inside the proton ( nucleus ) and from a gluon inside the nucleus ( proton ) .",
    "defining the nuclear production ratio as @xmath42 it immediately follows that : +    [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]      + we identify at least two reasons which could somehow complicate the above relationships .",
    "first of all , photons may also come from the collinear fragmentation of hard quarks and gluons produced in the partonic process . in that case , the photon transverse momentum can no longer be related to the momentum fractions of quarks and gluons inside the incoming hadrons , and hence to the proton / nucleus parton densities . however , a way to get rid of most of these fragmentation photons is to apply isolation criteria .",
    "in that sense , the production of _ isolated _ photons is a cleaner probe of @xmath36 and @xmath37 rather than the inclusive yield .",
    "furthermore , the above approximations have been derived at leading order , which may well be spoiled when higher order corrections are taken into account .",
    "in order to quantify the accuracy of the above approximations , the nuclear production ratio of isolated photons at forward rapidity ( taking @xmath43 , a region which should be accessible both by the phenix  @xcite and the star  @xcite experiments at rhic ) is computed at nlo ( using the calculations of ref .",
    "@xcite ) in @xmath2au over @xmath1@xmath1 collisions at @xmath3  gev ( fig .",
    "[ fig : isoy3rhic ] ) .",
    "the expected suppression using the ndsg nlo  @xcite nuclear parton densities ( solid line ) is @xmath44 , that is much below @xmath45 ( dashed line ) .",
    "the main reason for such a mismatch is , however , coming from an isospin effect , as we compare systems which projectiles differ : a proton and a deuteron .",
    "recall indeed that , being electromagnetic probes , photons couple more to @xmath46 quarks than to @xmath2 quarks ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "therefore , since the deuteron is poorer in @xmath46 than the proton is , prompt photon production is suppressed in @xmath2@xmath1 with respect to @xmath1-@xmath1 scattering .",
    "the proton and neutron seas being roughly symmetric , the suppression should be visible as long as valence quarks are involved , that is at large @xmath48 which is the case at rhic at forward rapidity . for",
    "the sake of a rough estimate , let us assume that only scattering of valence quarks with gluons is involved at large @xmath0 and that @xmath49 , then the isospin - corrected relationship we could expect between @xmath8 and @xmath36 is : @xmath50 ( in practice the isospin correction factor is given by @xmath51 , which is under better theoretical control ) . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : isoy3rhic ] ( dotted line ) the isospin - corrected @xmath36 is in pretty good agreement , say within @xmath25 , with the predicted @xmath8 ( see also the ratio of these two curves , minus one , @xmath52 , bottom line ) .            from this analysis  @xcite",
    ", it appears that photon production is a sensitive probe of the nuclear modifications of parton densities .",
    "this observable is , nevertheless , only interesting if the nuclear production ratio can be measured with a high statistical accuracy , that is if reasonable rates can be achieved . using an integrated luminosity of @xmath53  pb@xmath54 and @xmath55  pb@xmath54 at rhic  i and rhic  ii  @xcite ,",
    "respectively , the expected nlo rates are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : rates ] as a function of @xmath21 in the @xmath56@xmath57 rapidity range .",
    "fortunately , the photon yield is pretty large up to rather high @xmath21 and already at rhic  i , which is very encouraging .",
    "provided the experimental systematic uncertainties remain low , there is a real hope that the suppression of isolated photon production soon to be measured at rhic will allow for tight constraints to be set on @xmath58 at rather small values of @xmath0 ."
