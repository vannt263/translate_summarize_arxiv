    "in these modern times , even for a science pundit to argue , to a point of rational certainty , that science was pursued long before the advent of pen , paper , and printing is _ a hard nut to crack_. in prehistoric times , the knowledge used to be diffused from generation to generation in an oral tradition .",
    "the evolution of writing enabled knowledge to be stored and communicated across generations with much greater fealty .",
    "although empirical investigations of the natural world have been described since _ classical antiquity _ , and scientific methods have been employed since the _ middle ages _ , the dawn of modern science is often traced back to the early modern period and in particular to the _ scientific revolution _ that took place in the 16th to 17th century .",
    "scientific methods are considered to be so fundamental to modern science that some consider earlier inquiries into nature to be pre - scientific .",
    "science is a body of empirical , theoretical , and practical knowledge about the natural world , produced by the scientists who stress upon the observation , explanation , and prediction of real world phenomena . despite the slow but steady quest for science over the long time span , the english word _ scientist _",
    "is relatively recent  first coined by william whewell in 1833 .",
    "previously , people investigating nature called themselves _ natural philosophers_. subsequently , the term _ physics _ was coined in 1850 by cardinal newman , who defined it to be  that family of sciences which is concerned with the _ sensible _ world , that is the phenomena which we see , hear , and touch ; it is the philosophy of matter \" .",
    "gradually , physicists have narrowed their focus over the past century , perhaps because they have realized that the extent of knowledge has been growing so great and so fast that few , if any , can encompass it all .",
    "the world s renowned thinkers  from the past and present ",
    "believe that the transformation of the society has produced , to be sure , many beautiful ruins , but not a better society .",
    "the reason for such disappointments obviously lies in the man - made catastrophe in hiroshima and nagasaki in wwii .",
    "the physics and particularly the condensed matter physics that has an exceptionally poignant creation myth is the core behind such a contention . nevertheless , if there is any subject that can still claim to lie at the heart of knowledge of the natural world , it is physics .",
    "condensed matter physics is the largest branch of physics , which has the greatest impact on our daily lives by providing basis for technological innovations .",
    "condensed matter physics of the past twenty five years is the physics of the semiconducting systems of reduced dimensions .",
    "specifically , we refer to the exotic physics emerging from the semiconducting quasi - n - dimensional electron systems ( qndes ) ; with @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) being the degree of freedom .",
    "these are quantum wells ( @xmath7 ) , quantum wires ( @xmath8 ) , and quantum dots ( @xmath9 ) in which the charge carriers exposed to electric and/or magnetic fields exhibit novel quantal effects that strongly modify their behavior characteristics .",
    "the quantization of energy levels in inversion layers had been anticipated much earlier [ 1 ] , but 2d nature of the electron gas when only the lowest electric sub - band is occupied was confirmed a decade later by experiments on @xmath10-type inversion layers of ( @xmath11 ) surface of silicon in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field [ 2 ] .",
    "our insight of why and how behavior of a physical system depends on spatial dimensionality has been enriched significantly by studies of q2des .",
    "all the still - lower dimensional systems are known to be the willful derivatives of the q2des .",
    "the current progress in the nano - fabrication technology and the electron lithography and the ability to tailor potentials and interactions is stimulated by the world - wide quest to develop exotic high - speed , low - power devices that are small enough , sharp enough , and uniform enough to behave the way theory says they should .",
    "the discovery of quantum hall effects  both integral [ 3 ] and fractional [ 4 ]  is credited to have spurred the gigantic research interest in the systems of reduced dimensionality . in the present work ,",
    "we are concerned with the theoretical investigation of quantum wires or ( more realistically ) a quasi - one dimensional electron gas ( q1deg ) originally proposed by sakaki in 1980 [ 5 ] . for an extensive review of electronic , optical , and transport phenomena in qndes ,",
    "a reader is referred to ref .",
    "the literature is a live witness that much of the fundamental theoretical understanding of electron dynamics in one - dimensional ( 1d ) systems have emerged from the work on the tomonaga - luttinger liquid model ( tllm ) [ 7 - 8 ] .",
    "the tllm makes some of the drastic simplifying assumptions , which allow one to solve the interacting problem completely .",
    "one of the surprising results obtained from the solution of tllm is that even the smallest interaction results in the disappearance of fermi surface , leading to a system which is describable as a non - fermi liquid  in the sense that the elementary excitations are very different from those of the noninteracting system .",
    "therefore , one would expect that the experimental properties of the semiconducting quantum wires should be quite different from any of those based on the assumption that a 1d electron gas ( 1deg ) is a fermi liquid . and",
    "yet , contrary observations have been rather firmly established [ 9 ] .",
    "the proposal of the quantum wire structures was motivated by the suggestion [ 5 ] that 1d @xmath12-space restriction would severely reduce the impurity scattering , thereby substantially enhancing the low - temperature electron mobilities . as a result ,",
    "the technological promise that emerges is the route to the faster electronic devices fabricated out of quantum wires .",
    "a tremendous research interest burgeoned in quantum wires owes not only to their potential applications , but also to the fundamental physics involved .",
    "for instance , they have offered us an excellent ( unique ) opportunity to study the real 1d fermi gases in a relatively controlled manner .",
    "theoretical development of transport phenomena in quantum wires has also been the subject of an intense controversy over whether the system is best describable as luttinger liquid or as fermi liquid .",
    "this issue was elegantly resolved by das sarma and coworkers [ 9 ] who consistently justified the use of fermi - liquid - like theories for describing the realistic quantum wires .",
    "the quantum wires lie midway of the quantum rainbow and are known to possess some unique electronic , optical , and transport properties such as magnetic depopulation [ 10 ] , electron waveguide [ 11 ] , quenching of the hall effect [ 12 ] , quantization of conductance [ 13 ] , negative - energy dispersion [ 14 ] , magnetoroton excitations [ 15 ] , spin - charge separation [ 16 ] , to name a few .",
    "the theoretical investigations on the quantum wires , particularly associated with the magnetoplasmon excitations , have not been quite consistent with the experimental findings .",
    "for instance , early theoretical works [ 17 - 19 ] , had not been , to our knowledge , able to verify the prediction of the existence of magnetorotons [ 18 ] in quantum wires in the presence of an applied perpendicular magnetic field .",
    "also , our understanding of the inter - landau level collective excitations in the quantum wires has been quite limited in the situations where kohn s theorem [ 20 ] is violated .",
    "this review reports on the recent extensive investigations of the charge - density excitations in a magnetized quantum wire in a two - subband model within the framework of bohm - pines random - phase approximation ( rpa ) [ 21 ] .",
    "our main focus is the intersubband collective ( magnetoroton ) excitation which changes the sign of its group velocity twice before merging with the respective single - particle continuum . by definition ,",
    "a roton is an elementary excitation whose dispersion relation shows a linear increase from the origin , but exhibits first a maximum , and then a minimum in energy as the momentum increases .",
    "excitations with momenta in the linear region are called phonons ; those with momenta near the maximum are called maxons ; and those with momenta close to the minimum are called rotons .    a roton mode in 3d superfluid @xmath13he was empirically derived within the two - fluid model by landau [ 22 ] , and its reliable theory was developed and refined by feynman [ 23 ] . in 2d electron gas ( 2deg ) , the magnetoroton minimum was obtained in the fractional quantum hall effect regime within the framework of single - mode approximation by girvin et al .",
    "[ 24 ] . in q1deg ,",
    "the magnetoroton mode was predicted within the framework of hartree - fock approximation in 1992 [ 18 ] and it was soon verified in the resonant raman scattering experiments [ 15 ] .",
    "a rigorous theoretical finding of the magnetoroton ( mr ) modes in the realistic quantum wires had , however , been elusive until quite recently [ 25 ] . after a brief theoretical background , we illustrate and discuss a variety of relevant aspects of the mr mode collected from our recent research on the q1deg [ 25 - 28 ]",
    ". then we systematically connect the dots in order to bring about the central idea and substantiate the argument that an electronic device designed on the basis of such mr modes can act as an optical amplifier .",
    "there is one trait that many theoretical physicists share with philosophers . in both cases the interest in a field of study seems to vary in inverse proportion to",
    "how much one must learn to qualify as an expert .",
    "there is an important core of truth to the fact that  expertness is what survives when what has been learnt has been forgotten \" .",
    "true learning leading someone to become an expert is a long - term project  ideally life - long .",
    "however , present day learning of any subfield of science , particularly the vastly growing ( condensed matter ) physics , motivated to gain mastery is inconceivably parlous for survival in the existing competitive world of science . here",
    ", we shall try to review briefly what we have been able to learn from theoretically motivated analytical diagnoses of the magnetoplasmon excitations  specifically the intersubband collective [ or _ magnetoroton _ ] excitations  in a realistic quantum wire subjected to a harmonic confining potential and exposed to an applied ( perpendicular ) magnetic field .",
    "we appeal to interested readers to digest what they should and what they can and blame the author for the rest .",
    "the rest of the article is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "we list some fundamental mathematical formulae derived for the qndes in the absence of an applied magnetic field . generalization of these formulae to include the magnetic field is quite straightforward . in sec .",
    "iii , we present the theoretical framework in order to derive and discuss the full dyson equation ( that takes proper account of the coulombic interactions ) and the nonlocal , dynamic , dielectric function utilized for investigating the single - particle and collective ( magnetoplasmon ) excitations within the framework of rpa . in sec .",
    "iv , we discuss several illustrative examples , which focus mainly on the ( intersubband ) magnetoroton excitations computed in a two - subband model within the full rpa .",
    "this includes , e.g. , examining the effect of several experimental parameters such as the magnetic field , the charge density , and the confinement potential .",
    "then we examine the dependence on the damping of the gain coefficient for the magnetoroton excitations .",
    "lastly , we shed some light on the magnetic - field - dependence of the life - time of magnetorotons in the realistic quantum wires .",

    "they include , e.g. , fourier transform of the ( binary ) coulombic interactions , density of states , fermi energy , plasma frequency , to mention a few .",
    "the coulomb interaction in the wave vector space is given by the appropriate quasi-@xmath5-dimensional fourier transform of the coulomb interaction @xmath14(@xmath15)@xmath16 as    @xmath17    where @xmath18 is the background dielectric constant of the medium in which qndes is embedded .",

    "we choose to drop the subscript y on all the quantities for the sake of brevity .",

    "the dyson equation characteristically represents the quantum system and is known to serve useful purpose for investigating various electronic , optical , and transport properties such as , e.g. , the optical ( or magneto - optical ) absorption in the system .",
    "a simple mathematical manipulation of eqs .

    "the reason is that the matching eigenfunction is either symmetric or antisymmetric under space reflection .",

    "thus we set out on the extensive investigation associated with the magnetoplasmon excitations in a q1deg subjected to a perpendicular magnetic field @xmath2 at t=0 k [ 25 - 28 ] .",
    "the full - fledged mr mode was observed in the similar physical conditions in the magnetized quantum wires made up of narrow - gap in@xmath94ga@xmath95as systems in a rather different context [ 25 ] .",
    "subsequently , we extensively studied the dependence of its propagation characteristics on the charge - density , confinement potential , and magnetic field [ 26 ] . since the existence of this mr mode",
    "is exclusively attributed to the applied ( perpendicular ) magnetic field , we also scrutinized its group velocity for numerous values of the magnetic field in order to judge when and where this otherwise regular intersubband mode starts taking up the magnetoroton character .",
    "it was found that there really is a minimum ( threshold ) value of the magnetic field ( @xmath4 ) below which this mr does not exist and a regular intersubband magnetoplasmon survives .",

    "later , we also embarked on investigating the inverse dielectric functions ( idf ) for this system under the similar physical conditions [ 27 ] .",
    "the motivation there was not solely to reaffirm the fact that the poles of the idf and the zeros of the dielectric function ( df ) yield exactly identical excitation spectrum , but also to pinpoint the remarkable advantage of the former over the latter .",
    "for instance , the imaginary ( real ) part of the idf sets to furnish a significant measure of the longitudinal ( hall ) resistance in the system .",
    "moreover , the quantity i m [ @xmath106 also implicitly provides the reasonable estimates of the inelastic electron ( or raman ) scattering cross - section @xmath107(@xmath108 ) for a given system . for the details of the formalism of the idfs for the quasi - n dimensional systems ,",

    "the main concern here is the mr mode between maxon and roton where it exhibits negative group velocity ( ngv ) .",
    "we believe that the occurrence of ngv is quite unusual and hence must have some dramatic consequences .",
    "it turns out that the ngv matters  in the phenomena such as techyon - like ( superluminal ) behavior [ 31 ] , anomalous dispersion in the gain medium , a state with inverted population ( likely ) characterized by negative temperature , a medium having the ability of amplifying a small optical signal and hence serving as an _ active _ laser medium , ... etc .",
    "we focused on the latter and chose to compute the gain coefficient @xmath109(@xmath110 ) in order to materialize the notion of a quantum wire acting as an optical amplifier [ 28 ] .    in the classical electrodynamics",

    "the reduced propagation vector is fixed at @xmath151 .",
    "again , in analogy with the previous discussion , we focus on the imaginary part of the inverse dielectric function . since we choose a relatively small values of the propagation vector , the peaks in this figure can only identify the collective ( magnetoplasmon ) excitations .",
    "for the magnetic field @xmath152 t , we notice that the lower peak at @xmath153 mev stands for the intrasubband magnetoplasmon in the quantum wire , whereas the higher peak at @xmath154 mev corresponds to the rotonic part of the intersubband magnetoplasmon , which is identified as the magnetoroton mode in the corresponding system .",

    "figure 9 shows that the lower ( higher ) peak of the magnetoroton mode occurs at lower ( higher ) values of the propagation vector as the magnetic field is enhanced .",
    "also , generally speaking , the larger the magnetic field , the greater the propagation vector for the resonance peaks corresponding to the single - particle excitations .",
    "figure 10 depicts that the larger the magnetic field , the smaller ( greater ) the excitation energy of the intrasubband ( intersubband , or magnetoroton ) mode .",

    "the gain coefficient in the context of the laser amplification is defined as @xmath109(@xmath110)= ( @xmath158 ) i m [ @xmath159 ; @xmath160 being the speed of light in vacuum . the symbol i m refers to the imaginary part of nonlocal , dynamic , inverse dielectric function ( considered only for the relevant intersubband [ or magnetoroton ] excitations ) .",
    "the gain coefficient that persists due to the electronic transitions shows a maximum at @xmath161 mev for the damping factor @xmath162 .",
    "it is not just by chance that the peak position occurs at the expected values of ( @xmath78 ) in the excitation spectrum .",
    "as it is intuitively expected , the peak turns towards the lower energy with increasing damping factor .",
    "it is reasonable that an amplifier device such as a laser gain medium can not maintain a fixed gain for arbitrarily high input powers , because this would require adding arbitrary amounts of power to the amplified signal .",
    "therefore , the gain must be reduced for high input powers ; this phenomenon is called _",
    "gain saturation_. in the case of a laser gain medium , it is widely known that the gain does not instantly adjust to the level according to the optical input power , because the gain medium stores some amount of energy , and the stored energy determines the gain .",
    "given the sequence of instances manifesting in the system , it makes sense to reason that the applied magnetic field drives the system to a metastable ( or non - equilibrium ) state [ see , e.g. , fig .",
    "12 ] that gives rise to the population inversion so that gain rather than absorption occurs at the frequencies of interest .",
    "this is attested by the existing negative group velocity ( ngv ) associated with the anomalous dispersion in the range between maxon and roton .",
    "it is evident from fig . 11",
    "that the lower the damping ( or ohmic or scattering loss ) , the higher the gain in the medium .",
    "the bandwidth of the laser amplifier is seen to becoming narrower with increasing gain .",
    "the concept of bandwidth in the laser amplification is different from that in the band structure .",
    "conventionally , the bandwidth of an amplifier is defined as the full distance between the frequency ( or energy ) points at which the amplifier gain has dropped to half the peak value .",
    "another important issue is the nature of the electronic transitions : an amplifying ( absorbing ) transition implies a positive ( negative ) values of i m [ @xmath159 and hence of @xmath109(@xmath110 ) .",
    "of course , one can always associate a suitable @xmath163 sign with @xmath109(@xmath110 ) in order to give it the proper meaning for either amplifying or absorbing medium .",
    "one may argue that the sign specifying the gain or loss should result from the calculus . as a matter of fact , this is what we should expect if we are not sure of the characteristics of the medium .",
    "but if we know ( as is the case here ) that ngv implies gain rather than loss in a certain frequency range [ between maxon and roton ] , then we do have the freedom to choose the sign of the damping term .",
    "similar remarks as made on the sign convention here can be seen in the biblical textbooks on lasers .",
    "these characteristics open the possibility of designing mr - based electron device capable of amplifying a small optical signal of definite wavelength .",
    "figure 11 then clearly provides a platform for realizing the potential of a magnetized quantum wire to act as an _ active _ laser medium . the situation is analogous to the ( quasi - two dimensional ) superlattices where the crystal can exhibit a negative resistance : it can refrain from consuming energy like a resistor and instead feed energy into an oscillating circuit [ 6 ] .     vs. the reduced propagation vector @xmath114 for the magnetoroton for several values of the magnetic field @xmath2 [ with @xmath164 .",
    "the other parameters are as given inside the picture .",
    "we call attention to the trend : the stronger the magnetic field , the shorter the life - time , and hence more susceptible the metastable state around the maxon .",

    "this figure brings about the fact that the applied magnetic field drives the system to a metastable ( or non - equilibrium ) state .",
    "the metastable state is an important concept , from both a fundamental and a practical point of view , in the condensed matter physics .",
    "it is , by definition , a state that may exist even though it is much less stable than its ultimate equilibrium state .",
    "irradiation of the system with the light of suitable wavelength allows its electrons to jump to an excited state .",
    "when the incoming radiation is removed , the excited electron goes back to its original ( lower ) state .",
    "however , when an electron goes to a metastable state , it remains there for a relatively longer duration .",
    "this process leads to accumulation of electrons in the metastable state , since the rate of addition of electrons to the metastable state is higher than the rate of their de - excitation .",
    "this leads to the phenomenon called _ population inversion _ , which forms the basis of lasing action of lasers .",
    "there are different ways to represent the metastable state for a given system .",
    "we choose to compute the life - time of magnetoroton in the @xmath166 space until it propagates as a bonafide intersubband excitation [ i.e. , before it merges with the respective single - particle continuum ] ( see fig .",
    "just as expected , the roton stands as an unstable transition state between the metastable state near the maxon and the ultimate equilibrium state at lower wavelengths .",
    "the picture speaks clearly : the stronger the magnetic field , the shorter the life - time , and hence more vulnerable the metastable state .",
    "the damping can be interpreted as the inverse of the life - time of the excited quantum state .",
    "this implies that the smaller magnetic fields favor the optimum case for the higher gain coefficients .",
    "in summary , we have gathered and reviewed recent results obatined on the fundamental aspects associated with the intersubband collective ( magnetoroton ) excitations in the magnetized quantum wires within the rpa .",
    "the only necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of magnetorotons in quantum wires is : @xmath167 .",
    "the crucial part of the investigation is the negative group velocity observed by the magnetoroton between maxon maximum and roton minimum .",
    "the distinctive feature of ngv is that it leads to a tachyon - like ( superluminal ) behavior without one s having to introduce negative energies .",
    "the ngv is associated with the anomalous dispersion in a gain medium , where the sign of the phase velocity is the same for the incident and transmitted waves and energy flows inside the gain medium in the opposite direction to the incident energy flow in vacuum .",
    "the insight is that demonstration of ngv is possible in media with inverted population ",
    "an outcome of the metastable state caused by the magnetic field satisfying @xmath167  so that gain instead of absorption occurs at the frequencies of interest .",
    "a medium with population inversion has the remarkable ability of amplifying a small optical signal of definite wavelength ; i.e. , it can serve as an _ active _ laser medium .",
    "the mr minimum is the mode of higher density of excitation states .",
    "it is worth mentioning that roton features are among the most significant manifestations of the many - particle interactions .",
    "they arise from the interplay between direct and exchange terms of the electron gas and the depth of the minimum is determined by the strength of the exchange vertex corrections .",
    "as such , incorporating the many - body effects adequately should give a better insight into the propagation characteristics of magnetoroton .",
    "this fundamental investigation suggests an interesting and important application : the electronic device based on such magnetoroton modes can act as an optical amplifier . since all the parameters [ such as the charge density , magnetic field , confinement potential , propagation vector , etc . ]",
    "involved in the process that leads us to infer this proposal are in the reach of the current technology , the concept should prompt the device experiments . ever since its discovery [ 32 ] , graphene  a one - atom thick sheet of carbon atoms arranged laterally in a honeycomb lattice  has drawn tremendous attention of the scientific community world wide .",
    "it is the _ real _ thinnest material in the universe known so far , although similar synthesis of silicene [ 33 ] and germanene [ 34 ] have recently been reported .",
    "since it is real , it must have a _",
    "finite _ thickness .",
    "this allows the device physicists to electrostatically fabricate quasi-1- and quasi-0-dimensional ( dirac ) electron systems  the equivalent of semiconducting quantum wires and quantum dots  out of graphene .",
    "then it makes sense to probe graphene in the quest of magnetorotons and its role as an optical amplifier .",
    "it is premature to predict whether the tantalizing concept of magnetized quantum wire as an optical amplifier will emerge as an exciting idea to be engaged in by the researchers .",
    "but certainly no other system of reduced dimensions has spoiled scientists and engineers with as many appealing features to pursue .        during the course of this work",
    ", the author has benefited from many enlightening discussions and useful communications with some colleagues .",
