    "over the past few years our preliminary knowledge on the frequency of extrasolar planets in the low mass part of the hr - diagram has increased significantly . an ever increasing number of m dwarfs",
    "is being monitored by various doppler searches with high radial velocity ( rv ) precision .",
    "this has led to several discoveries of m dwarf planets that cover an enormous and surprising range in mass , almost comparable to the mass range of the planets in our solar system .",
    "jovian planets were found around gj  876 ( delfosse et al .",
    "1998 , marcy et al .  1998 , 2001 ) ,",
    "gj 849 ( butler et al .",
    "2006 ) and gj 317 ( johnson et al .",
    "2007 ) , and neptune - mass planets around gj  436 ( butler et al .  2004 ) , gj  581 ( bonfils et al .",
    "2005b ) and gj  674 ( bonfils et al .",
    "2007 ) . the low primary masses of m",
    "dwarfs combined with state - of - the - art rv precision even allowed the detection of additional planets with minimum masses below @xmath3 ( so - called `` super - earths '' ) in the gj  876 ( rivera et al .",
    "2005 ) and gj  581 ( udry et al .  2007 ) systems .",
    "in this paper we report the detection of a new low mass planet in a @xmath2  d orbit around the m dwarf gj  176 .",
    "this is the fourth planet in the class of neptune - mass companions orbiting m  dwarfs .",
    "gj  176 is already the third ( previously unknown ) planet host in our het m dwarf planet search ( endl et al .",
    "2003 , 2006 ) sample .",
    "gj  176 ( hd 285968 , hip 21932 , lhs 196 ) is a @xmath4 m2.5ve star at a distance of @xmath5 parsec , according to the hipparcos parallax of @xmath6 mas ( perryman et al .",
    "the star has a @xmath7 of @xmath8 and an absolute @xmath9 magnitude of @xmath10 .",
    "the 2mass magnitudes for gj  176 are @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 mag ( cutri et al .  2003 ) . using the v - band and k - band mass - luminosity relationships of delfosse et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , we estimate a mass of @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively . we adopt the mean value of @xmath16 as the mass of the star",
    ".    a photometric study by weis  ( 1994 ) did nt find significant variability for gj  176 .",
    "the v - band scatter measured by weis  ( 1994 ) is 0.006 mags , equal to the measurement uncertainties .",
    "the rosat all - sky - survey catalog of nearby stars ( hnsch et al .  1999 ) reports a moderate coronal x - ray emission level of @xmath17 .",
    "gj  176 is thus a moderately active star , possibly exhibiting starspots and flares , a quite typical behavior for m dwarfs .",
    "rauscher & marcy  ( 2006 ) measured the equivalent widths of the ca ii h and k lines with @xmath18    and @xmath19   , respectively . based on the v - band mass - metallicity relationship of bonfils et al .  ( 2005a ) we estimate an [ fe / h]@xmath20 for gj  176 , so roughly solar metallicity .",
    "we observed gj  176 as part of our on - going doppler search for planets around m dwarfs ( endl et al .",
    "2003 , 2006 ) using the het ( ramsey et al .",
    "1998 ) and its hrs spectrograph ( tull  1998 ) .",
    "we started observations of gj  176 in 2003 october 15 and collected a total of 28 spectra over 5 years .",
    "all observations were performed using our standard planet search setup and data reduction pipeline decribed in detail in cochran et al .",
    "we use the common i@xmath21 cell technique to obtain high precision differential rv measurements ( e.g. butler et al .",
    "1995 , endl et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "[ rvs ] shows the time series of our het / hrs rv measurements with the small secular acceleration of the rv of @xmath22 , as computed from the hipparcos parallax and proper motion information , already subtracted .",
    "the data have an overall rms - scatter of @xmath23 and average internal errors of @xmath24 . the total scatter is more than twice the measurement uncertainties , indicative of intrinsic rv variability of this target .",
    "the het rv data are listed in table  [ data ] .",
    "we searched the rv data of gj  176 for any significant periodicities using the classic lomb - scargle periodogram ( lomb  1976 ; scargle  1982 ) .",
    "[ lomb ] displays the resulting power spectrum .",
    "a strong peak is visible at a period of @xmath2  d. we estimate the false - alarm - probability ( fap ) of this signal with the bootstrap randomization scheme ( e.g. krster et al .",
    "after 100,000 bootstrap re - shuffling runs we find that the fap of the @xmath2  d signal is only 0.0004 .    as the next step we use gaussfit ( jeffereys et al .",
    "1988 ) to find a keplerian orbital solution to our rv data .",
    "a circular orbit fit yields a @xmath25 of @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) and a residual rv scatter of @xmath28 .",
    "a slightly better fit is obtained with an eccentric orbit with @xmath29 : @xmath25 of @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) and residual rms of @xmath32 .",
    "the large uncertainity in @xmath33 and the fact that a circular orbit yields a lower @xmath34 urges us to remain cautious concerning the reality of the non - circular orbit .",
    "however , future observations will allow us to determine whether the orbit is indeed eccentric .",
    "a moderately eccentric orbit could be an indication for additional planets around this star and thus warrants intensive follow - up monitoring .",
    "[ phase ] shows the rv measurements and both orbital solutions ( circular and eccentric ) phased to the best - fit period .",
    "the circular orbital solution yields a minimum mass for the companion of @xmath35 , while an eccentric orbit would lower the minimum mass slightly to @xmath36 .",
    "the orbital parameters are summarized in table  [ tab : planet2 ] .",
    "the case of gj  674 has demonstrated clearly that star spots can introduce low level signals in high precision rv data of m dwarfs ( bonfils et al .",
    "can the gj  176 signal also be caused by rotational modulation due to star spots and not a planet ?",
    "this scenario is very unlikely because a rotation period of @xmath37  d would mean that gj  176 would rotate more than 3 times faster than gj  674 , and this should lead to a higher activity level than gj  674 .",
    "this is not the case , as gj  176 has a slightly lower coronal x - ray emission than gj  674 ( hnsch et al .",
    "1999 ) . as mention before , weis  ( 1994 ) did nt detect photometric variability in gj  176 and we also did not find any significant variability or periodicity in the hipparcos photometry for this star ( the highest peak at @xmath38  d has a fap of @xmath39 . )    moreover , the vast majority of the data of bonfils et al .",
    "( 2007 ) was collected over a relatively short period of time ( @xmath40  d ) , where rotational modulation can mimic a keplerian signal of a planet because the active regions on the star remain constant for this period of time . however , over a larger amount of time , active regions will reconfigure and emerge at different stellar longitudes causing a phase as well as amplitude change in the rv signal .",
    "the gj  176 signal remains stable in phase and amplitude over 5 years , which makes the planet hypothesis much more plausible as the origin of the rv signal .",
    "remarkably , gj  176 is already the third m dwarf with a neptune - mass companion that was included in our het sample of @xmath41 m dwarfs .",
    "gj  436 and gj  581 were part of our m dwarf sample before the planets around them were announced .",
    "the frequency of short - periodic neptune - mass planets around m dwarfs in our het sample is hence @xmath42 , which is higher than the frequency of hot jupiters around fgk - type stars of @xmath43 ( marcy et al .",
    "neptunes and super - earths could be relatively common around low mass stars .",
    "of course , with m dwarfs we are still limited by small number statistics , as compared to the few thousands of fgk - type stars already observed by various doppler surveys around the world .",
    "we are currently increasing the size of the het m dwarf sample , and combined with the results of other programs observing m dwarfs , we should be able to derive important constraints for planet formation models .",
    "the present information about neptune - mass planets on short - period orbits suggests that they may be the tip of the terrestrial planet distribution , for several reasons .",
    "first , a number of hot neptunes have 2 or 3 sibling gas giant planets orbiting at much greater distances : @xmath44  1  cnc , @xmath45  ara , and gj  876 all have such systems .",
    "this planetary system architecture is the same as our own solar system , with inner terrestrial planets and outer gas giant planets , and suggests that the hot neptunes in these systems formed inside their gas giants , making them likely to be rocky planets .",
    "theoretical models of the collisional accumulation of terrestrial planets predict that rocky planets as massive as about @xmath46 would result from a protoplanetary disk with a surface density of gas and solids high enough to form a gas giant planet by core accretion in a few million years ( wetherill  1996 ; inaba et al .",
    "formation of the neptunes interior to their gas giants seems to be a much more likely scenario than formation as ice giants on orbits outside the orbits of the gas giants , followed by migration somehow past the gas giants to their current short - period orbits . while gj  876 is the only m dwarf of these three stars",
    ", one might expect a common explanation for its hot neptune as a rocky world , as well as those of gj  436 and gj  581 .",
    "this interpretation bodes well for the eventual detection of earth - mass planets on habitable orbits around low mass stars . for",
    "m  dwarfs with masses of @xmath47 we already have the sensitivity to detect @xmath48 planets in the habitable zone ( endl & krster  2007 , in prep . ) .",
    "while m dwarfs appear to have hot neptunes at a higher rate than g dwarfs , they appear to have short - period gas giant planets at a somewhat smaller rate than g dwarfs ( endl et al .",
    "2006 ; johnson et al .",
    "2007 ) . similarly",
    ", microlensing surveys have detected planetary companions at asteroidal distances to m dwarf stars at frequencies that suggest that planets at such locations are more likely to be neptune - mass than jupiter - mass .",
    "these results may simply be a result of m dwarfs have lower mass protoplanetary disks than g dwarfs , with the consequent result that the planets that form tend to have a mass distribution that is shifted downward .",
    "however , this apparent preference for cold super - earths over jupiters can also be explained at present by both the core accretion and disk instability formation mechanism for gas giant planets . in the case of core accretion",
    ", the lengthened orbital periods around m dwarfs could lead to most cores growing too slowly to accrete significant gaseous envelopes , making failed cores the usual outcome , rather than gas giants ( laughlin et al .",
    "disk instability explains the appearance of both gas giants and super - earths at asteroidal distances around m dwarfs by appealing to rapid formation of gaseous protoplanets by disk instability , followed by conversion to ice giants ( cold super - earths ) by photoevaporation at asteroidal distances in region of high mass star formation ( boss  2006 ) .",
    "because most m dwarfs form in regions of high mass formation , they should be orbited at asteroidal distance primarily by super - earths .",
    "m  dwarfs that form in region of low mass star will have gas giant planets at those distances , if disk instability is operative ( boss 2006 ) .",
    "it remains for these theoretical speculations to be tested by completing the extrasolar planetary census .",
