    "within the last decade , considerable attention has been turned to the explanation of the fact that intra - species dna sequence variation yields shallow gene genealogies resp .  low ratio between effective population size @xmath0 and adult census size @xmath1 in several marine species ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , as well as to the theory of mathematical models which may describe such genealogies in terms of so - called @xmath2-coalescents ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , hedgecock @xcite proposes a mechanism to describe substantial variation of reproductive success in marine species in terms of so - called `` reproduction sweepstakes '' , to be won by highly successful individuals within each generation , i.e , a few or even a single individual may replace a large fraction of the entire population .",
    "this requires great individual fecundity and high mortality early in life as well as `` sweepstake - like chances of matching reproductive activity with oceanographic conditions conducive to gamete maturation , fertilization , larval development , settlement and successful recruitment to the adult spawning population '' . as a result ,",
    "hedgecock claims that the variance in offspring numbers may be orders of magnitudes higher than what standard binomial or poisson models predict , leading to a small @xmath3 ratio .",
    "see also @xcite for a recent overview .",
    "however , if one tries to turn such a mechanism into a mathematical population model , it turns out that in order to make sense for large populations , sweepstakes whose size are a positive fraction of the present population can not be too frequent , in fact , the probability of such an event in a given generation must approach zero for large population sizes .",
    "otherwise , the model would predict vanishing genetic variability , in contrast to the empirical observations ( as already suggested by rnason in @xcite ) .    to circumvent such trivialities ,",
    "we first discuss two rigorous mathematical population models in the classical `` cannings framework '' ( @xcite , @xcite ) that incorporate extreme reproductive events ( due to eldon and wakeley @xcite and schweinsberg @xcite ) , which can be considered as simple models of hedgecock s sweepstakes , but still lead to non - vanishing variability . a classification result due to mhle and sagitov ( @xcite )",
    "then yields the required timescales for large population size , in a way that sweepstakes neither dominate ( leading to vanishing genetic variability ) nor become negligible .",
    "it is important to note that the required time - scaling is mostly `` non - classical '' ( i.e. , unlike the wright - fisher model and its relatives , not a linear function of the model s census population size ) hence will also affect the scaling of the mutation rates and make the concept of the so - called ( kingman- ) coalescent effective population size discussed in @xcite void , since the existence of the latter depends on a linear change in time - scale .",
    "the resulting limiting ancestral processes embedded in our population models ( with extreme reproduction due to sweepstake - like behaviour ) coincide with special cases of the so - called @xmath2-coalescents , i.e.  exchangeable coalescents , which allow multiple collisions of lineages ( extending the merely binary collisions in the kingman - coalescent setup ) , but not simultaneous multiple collisions .",
    "such processes were introduced and studied by pitman @xcite and sagitov @xcite and include the classical kingman - coalescent as a special case . however , the class of @xmath2-coalescents is vast , in particular allowing for any type of probability distributions on the set of ( random ) sweepstakes sizes .",
    "an important pair of questions in each concrete scenario therefore is : _ what is the `` right '' distribution on sweepstakes sizes , what is the right timescale ? _ in @xcite , eldon and wakeley discuss a simple model , in which sweepstake sizes are always the same fixed positive fraction of the population size .",
    "they then fit their model , using a maximum - likelihood method based on the number of segregating sites and total number of mutations , to mitochondrial data from pacific oysters ( _ crassostrea gigas _ ) , taken from @xcite , with the result that the maximum - likelihood estimator for the fixed sweepstakes size is @xmath4 of the living population .    to our knowledge , this was the first time that a @xmath2-coalescent based model has been calibrated to real data . however , there are a few issues that should be discussed . from the modeling perspective",
    ", there is no reason why there should be a fixed sweepstakes size .",
    "still , it is certainly infeasible to infer from the full ( non - parametric ) class of @xmath2-coalescents .",
    "parametric subclasses , which describe `` realistic '' mechanisms , would therefore be of interest ( we use certain so - called `` beta - coalescents '' , cf .",
    "e.g.  @xcite , @xcite , see section  [ subset : exceptgenealog ] and section  [ ssn : model ] for a discussion of this class of coalescents ) .",
    "another important point is the adequacy of the equilibrium population assumption underlying the coalescent model used in @xcite .",
    "as pointed out in @xcite , the pacific oyster data are taken from a population which had only recently been introduced from japan to canada .",
    "the shallow genealogy might therefore also be explained by the presence of a relatively recent population bottleneck .    in the present article",
    ", we analyse several datasets obtained from atlantic cod ( _ gadus morhua _ ) , taken from geographically separated locations , under the beta - coalescent model , taking the full information provided by the infinitely - many sites model into account ( as opposed to @xcite where the authors use summary statistics based only on the number of segregating sites and the total number of mutations ) .    as a result",
    "we report that in many cases , a neutral panmictic kingman - based scenario can be rejected .",
    "further , our maximum - likelihood estimators for the parameters of the beta - coalescents and mutation rates are presented , as well as an estimated real - time embedding of the genealogy and in particular the expected time to the most recent common ancestor given the data .",
    "we finally discuss the question whether there is evidence for a sweepstake - based scenario in these datasets and propose and calibrate a potential candidate for the distribution of sweepstake sizes .",
    "since the early 80ies , models based on the kingman coalescent have been successfully used to describe the genealogy of many biological populations .",
    "one of their distinguishing features is , together with exchangeability , that only binary collisions are allowed .",
    "that is , at most two ancestral lineages may coalesce at a time ( exchangeability meaning that all pairs of lineages are treated equal ) .",
    "however , it turns out that many species seem to exhibit `` exceptional genealogies '' , for example `` shallow genealogies '' , ( cf .",
    "e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , which may be appropriately described by more general exchangeable coalescents , the so - called @xmath2-coalescents , which allow _ multiple collisions _ of ancestral lineages .",
    "indeed , under a lambda - coalescent , given a sample of size @xmath5 , each @xmath6-tuple of ancestral lineages ( where @xmath7 ) is merging to form a single lineage at rate @xmath8 , where @xmath9 } x^{k}(1-x)^{n - k } \\frac{1}{x^2 } \\lambda(dx),\\ ] ] for some finite measure @xmath2 on the unit interval @xmath10 $ ] , see @xcite or @xcite .",
    "note that the family of lambda - coalescents is rather large , and in particular can not be parametrised by finitely - many real variables .",
    "important examples include @xmath11 ( kingman s coalescent ) and @xmath12 ( star - shaped genealogies ) . here ,",
    "we denote by @xmath13 the probability measure on @xmath10 $ ] with a unit point mass in @xmath14 $ ] .",
    "note that this means that ( for continuous functions @xmath15 ) @xmath16 from ( [ lambdarates ] ) and , one readily obtains @xmath17 } x^{k-2 } ( 1-x)^{n - k } \\delta_0(dx ) = 0^{k-2 } = \\begin{cases } 1 , & k=2,\\\\ 0 , & k > 2 , \\end{cases}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the kingman case and @xmath17 } x^{k-2 } ( 1-x)^{n - k } \\delta_1(dx ) = \\begin{cases } 1 , & k = n,\\\\ 0 , & 2 \\le k < n , \\end{cases}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the star - shaped case .",
    "a little more generally , a single point mass at @xmath18 , say @xmath19 , @xmath20 , yields @xmath21 } x^k ( 1-x)^{n - k } \\frac{\\psi^2}{x^2 } \\delta_\\psi(dx )   = \\psi^k(1-\\psi)^{n - k}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this has a simple interpretation via independent bernoulli trials with individual success probability @xmath22 that determines which lineages participate in a given merger event .",
    "also , forwards in time , it has a simple interpretation for the corresponding population model , namely , that on a macroscopic time - scale , at rate @xmath20 a fraction of @xmath23 of the living population is replaced by the offspring of single ancestor ( by the strong law of large numbers ) .",
    "such macroscopic reproduction events will be called `` extreme reproductive behaviour '' , and lead to multiple collisions in the genealogy .",
    "see , e.g. , @xcite for further details and references .    of course , from a modelling point of view a restriction to a fixed fraction @xmath22 appears unnatural , and the general case can be interpreted as a mixture over @xmath22 s .",
    "there are of course many possibility , and later , we will mainly be concerned with so - called _ beta - coalescents _ , in particular the case where @xmath2 has a beta@xmath24-density , i.e.   @xmath25 for some @xmath26 ( where @xmath27 denotes euler s gamma function ) .",
    "even though this is not integrable for @xmath28 , the transition rates then correspond to the classical kingman coalescent , which can in this way be included into the beta@xmath24-class , and intuitively smaller @xmath29 corresponds to stronger skew in offspring distributions .",
    "this class of multiple merger coalescents is mathematically distinguished ( revealing a close connection to @xmath29-stable branching processes , see @xcite ) ; furthermore , many large - sample properties are determined by the shape of @xmath2 near @xmath30 ( e.g.  @xcite ) , by varying @xmath29 we obtain a `` natural '' representative for each regularity index at @xmath30 .",
    "finally , the beta@xmath24-coalescents appear as limiting genealogies for a `` natural '' class of reproduction models derived from a branching mechanism with `` heavy tails '' , see section  [ subsec : exmodels ] below .",
    "we follow a classical framework of population genetics and regard neutral , non - overlapping discrete - generation population models with exchangeable offspring distribution , that is , _ cannings models _ , see @xcite , @xcite .",
    "consider a ( haploid ) population of fixed size @xmath1 , let @xmath31 denote the @xmath32-th generation .",
    "let @xmath33 denote the vector of offspring replacing the @xmath1 individuals in the @xmath32-th generation , where @xmath34 is the number of children of individual @xmath6 .",
    "we assume that the random vectors @xmath35 , with @xmath31 , are independent and identically distributed , and furthermore that , for fixed @xmath32 , the random variables @xmath36 are exchangeable .",
    "we write @xmath37 when speaking about distributional properties in a single generation , where @xmath32 is irrelevant .",
    "note that exchangeability and constant population size force that the expected number of offspring of each individual @xmath38 is one , i.e.  @xmath39=1 $ ] .",
    "let @xmath40}{n-1}\\ ] ] ( this is the probability that two randomly drawn individuals from the same generation are siblings ) .",
    "note that the numerator equals the variance of the offspring distribution , i.e.  @xmath41 $ ] and , of course , is independent of @xmath38 due to exchangeability . a famous result by kingman @xcite shows that if @xmath42 as @xmath43 ( and suitable higher moment bounds hold ) , then the genealogy of a sample of size @xmath5 taken from the limiting population ( time - changed by @xmath44 ) will be given by kingman s @xmath5-coalescent .    in @xcite",
    ", extending kingman s original result , mhle and sagitov provide the necessary and sufficient criteria so that a limiting cannings population model has a non - trivial genealogy given by a @xmath2-coalescent .",
    "in particular , if we consider the population model on the time scale @xmath44 , then the limiting genealogy will be governed by a @xmath2-coalescent iff    * @xmath45 , as @xmath43 , * for all @xmath46 with @xmath47 , we have @xmath48 } \\frac{1}{x^2 } \\ , \\lambda(dx ) , \\quad \\mbox{as}\\;\\ ; n \\to \\infty,\\ ] ] * and finally , for @xmath49 , @xmath50/(n^2 c_n ) \\longrightarrow 0 $ ] as @xmath43",
    ".    condition ( [ neun ] ) shows how the distribution of the individual offspring numbers determines the measure @xmath2 from ( [ lambdarates ] ) that governs the transition rates in the coalescent .",
    "indeed , ( [ neun ] ) can be interpreted as @xmath51 it in particular forces the offspring distribution _ to be `` highly '' skewed _",
    ", i.e.  there must be reproduction events where the number of offspring is of the same order as the total population size , which implies that the variance @xmath52 of @xmath53 blows up as @xmath1 gets large .",
    "note that this condition also implies that these extreme reproductive events need to happen on the time - scale @xmath44 , hence can not be too frequent ( an effect that has been pointed out , informally , in the introduction and also already in @xcite ) .",
    "several classes of cannings models have been considered recently in the literature in this context .",
    "for example , in @xcite , eldon and wakeley discuss a model of size @xmath1 where , in each generation , exactly one uniformly chosen individual reproduces and becomes parent of a fixed ( non - random ) positive fraction of the population , leading to a measure with an atom in  ( 0,1 ] .",
    "if one is interested in a model with variable ( random ) sweepstakes sizes , one might consider schweinsberg s ( @xcite ) model , which leads naturally to beta - coalescent based genealogies and is related to @xmath29-stable branching processes for some @xmath54 $ ] .",
    "again , consider a haploid population of size @xmath1 .",
    "reproduction is assumed to happen in two steps .",
    "first , each individual spawns ( independently ) @xmath55 offspring , according to a probability distribution with a power law tail - behaviour , i.e. @xmath56 , c > 0,\\ ] ] so that the amount of potential offspring has infinite variance .",
    "we denote the resulting vector of ( potential ) offspring by @xmath57 .",
    "note that the components do not ( yet ) sum up to @xmath1 , but to some random @xmath58 typically much larger than @xmath1 .",
    "hence , in a second step , @xmath1 individuals are chosen uniformly at random from the @xmath58 potential offspring particles , so that we obtain the new offspring vector @xmath59 where @xmath60 denotes the number of individuals drawn from the @xmath61 potential children of parent @xmath6 .",
    "this model has some resemblance of so - called `` type - iii survivorship '' : high fertility leads to excessive amount of offspring , corresponding to the first reproduction step , whereas high mortality early in life is modeled in the second step .",
    "choosing a suitable limit of a cannings population model ( e.g.  one of the models above ) determines an explicit probabilistic mechanism for the ancestral process , i.e.  the underlying class of @xmath2-coalescents .",
    "still , one needs to calibrate the corresponding parameters to the observed dna sample in questions , thus inferring `` evolutionary parameters '' like the mutation rate .",
    "we pursue a maximum - likelihood approach based on the full sample information .",
    "we assume that mutations occur according to the infinite - sites model , i.e. , each new mutation hits a novel site .    a general probabilistic mechanism of obtaining dna samples from a coalescent tree  which is our model for the gene genealogy of the ancestral limit process of our population models under consideration ",
    "is described in detail in @xcite . here",
    ", we provide a quick overview . to obtain a sample of size @xmath5 , first run an @xmath5-@xmath2-coalescent to obtain a _ rooted _ coalescent tree . on this rooted tree with @xmath5 leaves ( numbered from @xmath62 to @xmath5 ) , place mutations along the branches at rate @xmath63 to obtain a gene genealogy ( here , @xmath63 is the scaled mutation rate ) .",
    "then , label these mutations randomly : given there are @xmath64 mutations in total , attach uniformly at random the labels from @xmath65 to these mutations .",
    "an observed genetic _ type _",
    "@xmath66 is then given by the sequence of labels of mutations following its path backwards from a leaf to the root .",
    "when there are @xmath67 different types , we enumerate them randomly , from @xmath68 .",
    "note that @xmath69 , since each type has at least one unique mutation .",
    "we then let @xmath70=\\big[({\\bf x}_1 , \\dots , { \\bf x}_d ) , ( n_1 , \\dots , n_d)\\big ] $ ] denote the pair consisting of the observed unordered @xmath67-tuple of types @xmath71 and their respective multiplicities @xmath72 .",
    "note that @xmath73 $ ] equivalently describes a tree , commonly referred to as a _",
    "genetree_. we will denote the distribution of such a data set or tree , depending on @xmath2 and mutation rate @xmath63 , by @xmath74",
    ".    we may then compute the likelihood of observed data @xmath73 $ ] under the `` parameter '' @xmath75 , i.e.  @xmath76 ) : = { \\ensuremath{\\mathbb{p}}}_{\\lambda , r}([{\\bf t } , { \\bf n}])$ ] recursively , conditioning on the last event in the coalescent history , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section  1.3 ) .",
    "such a recursion may , for small sample sizes with few mutations , be solved numerically . however , for more complex samples , monte - carlo methods , for example importance sampling , need to be employed .",
    "such methods are being discussed in detail in @xcite and implemented in the program ` metagenetree ` .",
    "the pacific oysters dataset presented in @xcite was obtained as the result of a restriction - enzyme digest of mitochondrial dna taken from 159 pacific oysters ( _ crassostrea gigas _ ) from british columbia .",
    "this digest can ( in an ad hoc fashion ) be interpreted as sequence information resulting in 49 segregating sites or positions , where an enzyme either cuts or leaves the dna - molecule intact , depending on the allele present .",
    "this pattern was then manually edited to resolve violations of the infinitely many sites model , resulting in the exclusion of four samples and five sites , see appendix  [ app_details ] for details .",
    "this dataset has also been analysed in @xcite , where the authors already pointed out the underlying genealogy might not be adequately modelled by kingman s coalescent .",
    "the second set of dna sequence data was discussed in @xcite . there",
    ", rnason combined several datasets , published in other works , from a 250 bp region of the mitochondrial cytochrome _ b _ gene of the atlantic cod ( _ gadus morhua _ ) . in @xcite , he provided a discussion of the whole combined dataset which unfortunately turned out to be too large to be treated by our exact likelihood methods .",
    "for this reason we analysed the smaller component datasets described in @xcite separately .",
    "as rnason pointed out these samples stem from various geographic locations throughout the atlantic . in our analysis , we choose the most abundant type to represent the ancestral type , and we also consider summing out over all possible ancestral types . again , some of the samples violated the assumptions of the infinitely many sites model . to cope with this ,",
    "we considered the combined dataset of @xcite and introduced a consistent pattern of parallel mutations to resolve all violations ( again , see appendix  [ app_details ] for details ) .",
    "this procedure lead to a dataset that corresponds to the phylogenetic maximum parsimony network from figure  2 of @xcite .",
    "we then analysed the respective subsamples specified in the different publications .",
    "table  [ dtestsoyster ] and table  [ dtestscod ] show some characteristics of the datasets , and we refer to appendix  [ app_details ] for a more detailed description .      in several datasets , in particular the one discussed in @xcite , standard tests reject the `` kingman hypothesis '' , indicating that the genealogies underlying the observed datasets might not be adequately described by a kingman - coalescent .",
    "in particular , we consider tajima s @xmath77 and fu & li s @xmath77 in each case .",
    "recall that for a sample of @xmath5 sequences , tajima s @xmath77 ( see @xcite ) is based on the normalized difference between the mean number of pairwise differences @xmath78 and the weighted number of segregating sites @xmath79 . in a neutral , kingman - coalescent based scenario , @xmath77 should be approximately 0 .",
    "small values of @xmath77 indicate shallow genealogies , large values indicate long internal branches .",
    "another standard test statistic is fu & li s @xmath77 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "again , the test statistic is based on a standardized variable which is the difference between the number of mutations on external branches @xmath80 , and the number of mutations on internal branches @xmath81 , multiplied by a weighting factor .",
    "values for approximate  confidence intervals \" ( cis ) for each @xmath77 can be found in table  2 of @xcite .",
    ".statistical tests reject kingman hypothesis for pacific oyster data [ cols=\"<,>,>,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ cb][cb ] [ cb][cb ] [ cb][cb ] [ cb][cb ] [ cb][cb ] [ cb][cb ] [ cb][cb ]    to embed these values into real time we use rnason s estimate ( @xcite ) for the mutation / substitution rate of the mitochondrial dna for the atlantic cod @xmath82 .",
    "since we consider a stretch of 250 bp in the analysis of the atlantic cod data , the substitution rate for this stretch is given by @xmath83 .",
    "for the real time embedding of the coalescent time note that @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "thus the coalescent time can be transformed into real time by the relation @xmath86 the last two columns of table  [ tab_common_ancestor_beta ] and table  [ tab_common_ancestor_kingman ] show the real time embeddings ( in kya ) of the time to the most recent common ancestor and the corresponding credibility intervals for the different samples , in the beta respectively kingman case .",
    "some cumulative distribution functions are shown in figure  [ inference_plot_common_ancestor ] .",
    "we are not aware of any other estimates of @xmath87 for the presented atlantic cod datasets in the literature , but it would be interesting to compare our results with results obtained by other methods .    more importantly , our results show that the choice of the prior distribution for the genealogy has a severe impact on the estimation of @xmath87 .",
    "the estimates under the kingman coalescent are approximately 50% higher on average .",
    "this shows that , when estimating evolutionary parameters , it is crucial to verify the validity of kingman s coalescent as an appropriate model for the underlying neutral genealogy .",
    "it is a natural question to ask , if one finds that kingman s coalescent is not a suitable approximation , e.g.  due to the the presence of hedgecock s `` sweepstakes reproductive success '' ( srs ) , which particular @xmath2-coalescents are of biological relevance . in order to do this",
    ", one needs to determine the distribution of the relative sizes of these reproduction sweepstakes to be won .",
    "this quantity typically depends in non - trivial ways on the offspring distribution of the species in question , but also on many other ( ecological and demographic ) factors which can not be derived from simple assumptions from the outset ( e.g.  the geography of the habitat ) .    in @xcite , eldon and",
    "wakeley derived and used ( to fit to data from @xcite ) @xmath2-coalescents of the simple form @xmath88 , thus positing a fixed relative sweepstake size @xmath89 $ ] , see section  [ subset : exceptgenealog ] for an interpretation .",
    "this class has the advantages of conceptual simplicity and that it depends only on one real parameter .",
    "however , eldon and wakeley s model raises the question why srs should always be a fixed fraction of size @xmath22 of the total population .",
    "as hedgecock and pudovkin point out : `` it should come as no surprise , then , that just as recruitment success in marine fisheries fluctuates greatly , so too may severity of srs fluctuate '' ( @xcite ) .    in order to overcome this objection ,",
    "while still keeping the statistical advantages of a class of coalescents parametrised by a single parameter , we chose the class of beta@xmath24 coalescents .",
    "they arise naturally as scaling limits of branching - type populations models , where each individual reproduces independently ( subject to preservation of the total population size ) and offspring numbers are heavy - tailed with a power - law decay , see and the subsequent discussion , in particular the relation to `` type - iii - survivorship '' .",
    "note that our scenario , motivated by schweinsberg s model , considers _",
    "infrequent _ reproduction sweepstakes .",
    "this , together with a certain amount of independence between reproductive events and subexponential tail distributions , makes it highly unlikely to observe several `` sweepstakes winners '' within one generation ( hence ruling out @xmath90-coalescent like behaviour ) : typically , if a family of the order of the total population size is produced , the amount of offspring of the most successful individual dominates the number of offspring of the second - most successful individual , thus ruling out , at least for large populations , the emergence of simultaneous multiple mergers .",
    "however , in other scenarios , other @xmath2-coalescents might become relevant .",
    "examples include durrett and schweinsberg s models of recurrent selective sweeps @xcite mentioned above .",
    "the presence of externally induced recurrent severe bottlenecks might even yield @xmath90-coalescent based genealogies , admitting _ simultaneous _ multiple merger coalescents @xcite .",
    "often , as in the bottleneck scenario , simultaneous multiple mergers require drastic ( externally induced ) changes in the environment , which we do not consider here .    of course , stochastic fluctuations in the ocean environment ( see @xcite ) , could potentially cause such bottlenecks .",
    "it will be an objective of future research to test whether deviations from kingman s coalescent seem to be induced predominantly by independent heavy - tailed reproduction , or by external stochastic fluctuations .",
    "however , such an analysis is clearly out of scope of this expository paper ( in particular , there is a high risk of overfitting within the vast class of @xmath90-coalescents ) .",
    "still , a way to assess the adequacy of the underlying coalescent models is to compare how well these models may be fitted to functions of the observed data such as frequency spectra .",
    "indeed , in a recent presentation , schweinsberg compared minimal - least - squares fits of the observed _ site frequency spectrum _ of the full atlantic cod dataset from @xcite ( sample size @xmath91 ) to the expectation in beta@xmath24-models ( using an asymptotically exact formula for the expected site frequency spectrum for the beta@xmath24-case ) .",
    "the quality of the fit for the beta - coalescent , with an estimated optimal @xmath92 , is striking and much better than for the kingman - coalescent , making a strong point in favour of the use of beta - coalescent models ( the fit for the pacific oyster dataset from @xcite mentioned in the same presentation is worse , however , as already mentioned above , in this case the population history suggests a recent severe bottleneck , which is not literally compatible with any of the coalescent models considered here ) .",
    "it is a very interesting question in how far the dna sample data considered here allows a `` retrospective '' assessment of `` sweepstake sizes '' distributions , in particular whether a fixed sweepstake size @xmath89 $ ] as in the models considered by eldon and wakely in @xcite appears more or less plausible than the `` random '' one that is implicit in the beta@xmath24-models .    in preliminary computations",
    ", we computed likelihood values for the some of the component data sets considered here with @xmath2 as in ( [ eq : ewatom ] ) , varying @xmath22 on a grid in @xmath93 $ ] .",
    "the maximal likelihood values , attained at @xmath22 s between @xmath94 and @xmath95 , were sometimes comparable and sometimes one to two orders of magnitude smaller than those for the beta@xmath24-coalescents ( data not shown ) .",
    "in addition , we used the simulation algorithm described in @xcite to estimate the expected site frequency spectrum under a coalescent with @xmath2 as in ( [ eq : ewatom ] ) with @xmath91 ; the fit to the observed frequency spectrum of the total sample described in @xcite appeared much worse than that derived from the beta@xmath24-coalescent described by schweinsberg ( data not shown ) .",
    "while this suggests that `` non - fixed sweepstake sizes '' might be indeed a more reasonable model , it also indicates that larger sample sizes and presumably also multi - locus data sets would be required for a reliable answer .",
    "this is beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "finally , it is still a largely open question to assess the statistical properties of the estimator employed here , which is based on methods described in @xcite .",
    "some considerations in this direction can be found in @xcite .",

    "we now provide details on how we dealt with occasional violations of this condition in the datasets that we analysed .",
    "the dataset was taken from @xcite , where the authors obtained the data as the result of a restriction - enzyme digest of mitochondrial dna taken from 155 pacific oysters ( _ crassostrea gigas _ ) from british columbia .",
    "the authors reported the fragment sizes resulting from 9 different enzymes in their table  2 @xcite .",
    "we translated these lists of fragment length into pseudo - sequence data for every enzyme .",
    "such a pseudo sequence is a list of zeros and ones for every reported type , specifying the presence or absence of a restriction enzyme binding site .",
    "the choice whether 1 denotes the presence of a binding site and 0 the absence or vice versa is determined uniquely once we specify an ancestral type later .",

    "* table  2 ) the authors report a type ` c ' for the restriction enzyme ` hincii ' , however , this type is not reported in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* table  1 ) , so we omitted this type ` c ' for the subsequent analysis .",
    "table  1 of @xcite shows how the different observed haplotypes are composed of the sub - haplotypes , along with the respective abundance of a given type in the respective sub - populations .",
    "note that in  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* table  1 ) type ` ht32 ' reports a sub - type ` f ' for the enzyme ` haeii ' , but this sub - type ` f ' does not occur in the respective  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* table  2 ) , thus we treated this sub - type as ` e ' in the subsequent analysis .",
    "we chose the most abundant type `` ps2 '' to be ancestral , thus uniquely specifying which pattern of presence / absence of restriction sites corresponds to the all - zero pseudo - sequence . to remedy the violations of the infinitely - many - sites model present in the dataset",
    ", we deleted the sites for ` hindiii.5 ' , ` haeiii.12 ' , ` avaii.1 ' , ` haeiii.11 ' , ` haeii.6 ' , and removed the types ` hs45 ' , ` ps10 ' , ` hs44 ' , ` db40 ' .",
    "note that these steps eliminate the only difference between ps1 and ps2 , so that ultimately ps1 and ps2 are taken to be ancestral .",
    "after these steps , the data can be converted into a valid genetree as described in section  [ inference ] .",
    "the atlantic cod dataset is based on dna sequence data taken from a 250 bp stretch of the mitochondrial cytochrome _ b _ gene of the atlantic cod ( _ gadus morhua _ ) . in the numbering of the sites from @xcite ,",
    "this stretch ranges from site 14,459 to site 14,708 ( included ) . in @xcite",
    ", rnason took several cod datasets from different publications , combined them and provided an analysis of the whole dataset .",
    "however , since this combined dataset is too big to be treated by our method for computing likelihoods based on the full information , we analysed certain samples separately .",
    "as rnason pointed out , the samples stem from various localities throughout the atlantic , ranging from newfoundland @xcite , @xcite & @xcite , greenland @xcite , the faroe islands @xcite , and norway @xcite to the baltic sea @xcite .",

    "the authors provide the dna sequence data of a larger 566 bp stretch from which we only took the information of the 250 bp fragment in question .",
    "furthermore , in @xcite , the authors report the type ` r ' which differs from the type ` a ' only outside of the 250 bp segment we are considering .",
    "thus we count this type as an ` a ' type .",
    "since the full dataset from figure  1 on page  1874 in @xcite contains violations of the infinitely - many - sites model , we solved these violations by introducing a consistent pattern of parallel mutations .",
