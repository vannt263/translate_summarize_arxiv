    "probing hadrons by electromagnetic reactions strongly involves vector mesons according to the vector - meson dominance conjecture @xcite .",
    "although the standard vector - meson - dominance model ( vmd ) is quite successful to describe these kinds of reactions , it is not able to describe all of them . in the following ,",
    "we will study transition form factors , i.e. decays of a vector meson into a pseudoscalar meson and a dilepton @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : omegapinurvmd ] , the @xmath4 transition form factor calculated with vmd is plotted in comparison to form - factor data taken by the na60 collaboration for the decay into a dimuon @xcite . obviously , vmd fails to describe the data .",
    "+    due to the running coupling constant in qcd , perturbative qcd can only be used for high energies . for low energies ,",
    "this is not possible .",
    "a possible solution are effective theories which use hadrons as relevant degrees of freedom . in the lowest energy region , the effective theory called chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) @xcite is such an effective theory .",
    "the only active degrees of freedom are the pseudoscalar goldstone bosons ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath3 ) .",
    "all other mesons , in particular the vector mesons ( @xmath7 , @xmath0 , @xmath8 , @xmath1 ) are treated as heavy .",
    "therefore , chpt is not applicable for the energy range of the hadronic resonances .",
    "so far , there have only been phenomenologically successful models as , e.g. , vmd for this energy range .",
    "our final aim is to develop an effective theory for this range .",
    "+ we use a new counting scheme for both the goldstone bosons and the light vector mesons proposed in @xcite .",
    "according to this scheme , the masses of both the goldstone bosons and the light vector mesons are treated as soft , i.e. of the order of a typical momentum @xmath9 .",
    "if one describes decays , all involved momenta will be smaller than the mass of the decaying meson and , thus , also of the order of @xmath9 , @xmath10 the restriction to these mesons can be justified by the hadrogenesis conjecture , i.e. all other low - lying mesons are considered as dynamically generated from interactions of goldstone bosons and light vector mesons singlet is part of our ongoing work . ] .    in chpt ,",
    "the range of applicability , i.e. the range for @xmath9 is limited ( on tree level ) by the not - considered mesons , in practice by @xmath11 , and ( for loops ) by the scale @xmath12 , where @xmath13 denotes the pion decay constant . in the scheme of @xcite , where vector mesons are included and where two - particle reducible diagrams ( rescattering processes ) are resummed ,",
    "it is suggestive that the range of applicability can be pushed to larger energies .",
    "next - to - leading - order calculations are necessary to assess this proposition . at present , phenomenological consequences are worked out in leading order and compared to data .",

    "@xmath22 describes the photon field .",
    "+ the leading - order lagrangian ( [ lol ] ) allows only indirect decays , i.e. decays via a virtual vector meson .",
    "the first two terms proportional to the parameters @xmath23 and @xmath24 describe the decay of a vector meson into a virtual vector meson and a goldstone boson and the third term describes the decay of the virtual vector meson into a ( real or virtual ) photon .",
    "the decay of the photon into a dilepton is described by usual qed .",
    "+ to determine the uncertainties of our method , we use as a very rough estimate one particular next - to - leading - order term of the lagrangian , @xmath25_+ \\partial_\\beta \\phi \\right\\ } \\partial_\\mu a_\\nu \\label{nlol}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this terms describes the direct decay of a vector meson into a goldstone boson and a ( real or virtual ) photon .",
    "+ the open parameters @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath26 can be fixed by fitting the partial decay widths for the two - body decays @xmath27 to the available experimental data .",
    "we fixed two parameter sets , parameter set ( p1 ) with @xmath28 and @xmath29 which describes the leading - order calculation and parameter set ( p2 ) with @xmath30 and @xmath31 which includes the particular next - to - leading - order term .",
    "+ for the decays into dileptons no additional parameters are needed so that we have predictive power for these decays .",
    "hence , there is no additional fitting to experimental data included in the results which will be presented in the next section .",
    "due to isospin conservation , the decay @xmath32 is only possible via a virtual @xmath33 meson .",
    "thus , the transition form factor calculated with vmd equals @xmath34 whereby @xmath35 is the square of the invariant mass of the dilepton .",
    "the form factor calculated with the lagrangians ( [ lol ] , [ nlol ] ) contains both a term of vmd type and a constant term , @xmath36 with the abbreviation @xmath37 note that for @xmath38 one obtains a particularly simple form @xmath39 which is very different from ( [ ffvmdomegapi ] ) .",

    "as already mentioned in the introduction , the vmd form factor fails to describe the data .",
    "our calculations miss only the last three data points .",

    ", data with improved quality are expected from the kloe collaboration .",
    "+ the partial decay width for the decay into a dielectron is in agreement with the experimental data @xcite , @xmath46 there is no experimental data available for the decay into a dimuon so that our calculation has to be seen as a prediction @xcite , @xmath47",
