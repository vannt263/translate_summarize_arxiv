    "dusty circumstellar disks have been the focus of intense observational interest in recent years , largely because they are thought to be the birthplaces of planetary systems .",

    "spatially resolved observations of these disks , much of our knowledge of their structure is still derived from spatially _",
    "un_resolved spectroscopy and spectral energy distributions ( seds ) .",
    "the interpretation of this information ( as well as spatially resolved data ) requires the use of theoretical models , preferentially with as much realism and self - consistency as possible .",
    "such disk models have been developed and improved over many years .",
    "when they are in reasonable agreement with observations they can also serve as a background onto which other processes are modeled , such as chemistry , grain growth , and ultimately the formation of planets .",
    "this chapter reviews the development of such self - consistent disk structure models , and discusses the current status of the field .",
    "we restrict our review to models primarily aimed at a comparison with observations",
    ". we will start with a concise resum of the formation and viscous evolution of disks ( section [ sec - viscevol ] ) .",
    "this sets the radial disk structure as a function of time .",
    "we then turn our attention to the vertical structure , under the simplifying assumption that the gas temperature equals the dust temperature everywhere ( section [ sec - diskstruct ] ) . while this assumption is valid in the main body of the disk , it breaks down in the disk surface layers .",
    "the formation of stars and planetary systems starts with the gravitational collapse of a dense molecular cloud core .",
    "since such a core will always have some angular momentum at the onset of collapse , most of the infalling matter will not fall directly onto the protostar , but form a disk around it while matter falls onto the disk , viscous stresses within the disk will transport angular momentum to its outer regions . as a consequence of this ,",
    "most of the disk matter moves inward , adding matter to the protostar , while some disk matter moves outward , absorbing all the angular momentum ( _ lynden - bell and pringle _ , @xcite ) . during its formation and evolution",
    "a disk will spread out to several 100 au or more ( _ nakamoto and nakagawa _",
    ", @xcite , henceforth nn94 ; _ hueso and guillot _ , @xcite , henceforth hg05 ) .",
    "this spreading is only stopped when processes such as photoevaporation ( this chapter ) , stellar encounters ( _ scally and clarke _ , @xcite ; _ pfalzner et al .",
    "_ , @xcite ) or a binary companion ( _ artymowicz and lubow _ , @xcite ) truncate the disk from the outside . during the collapse phase , which lasts a few@xmath0 years",
    ", the accretion rate within the disk is very high ( @xmath1  @xmath2yr ) , but quickly drops to @xmath3  @xmath4yr once the infall phase is over ( nn94 , hg05 ) .",
    "the optical and ultraviolet excess observed from classical t tauri stars ( cttss ) and herbig ae / be stars ( haebes ) confirms that this on - going accretion indeed takes place ( _ calvet et al .",

    "dotted line : accretion rate _ in the disk_. , width=302 ]      an issue that is still a matter of debate is what constitutes the viscosity required for disk accretion , molecular viscosity is too small to account for the observed mass accretion rates .",
    "turbulent and magnetic stresses , however , can constitute some kind of anomalous viscosity .",
    "the magnetorotational instability ( mri ) , present in weakly magnetized disks , is the most accepted mechanism to drive turbulence in disks and transport angular momentum outwards ( _ balbus and hawley _",
    ", @xcite ; _ stone and pringle _ , @xcite ; _ wardle _ , @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "there is a disk region ( 0.2 @xmath5 4 au , for typical ctts disk parameters according to _ dalessio et al .",
    "_ , @xcite ) in which the ionization fraction is smaller than the minimum value required for the mri . neither thermal ionization ( requiring a temperature higher than 1000 k ) , cosmic ray ionization ( requiring a mass surface density smaller than @xmath6  100 g/@xmath7 ) ( _ jin _ , @xcite ; _ gammie _ , @xcite ) , nor x - rays ( _ glassgold et al .",
    "_ , @xcite , @xcite ) are able to provide a sufficient number of free electrons to have mri operating near the midplane . _",
    "gammie _  ( @xcite ) proposed a layered accretion disk model , in which a `` dead zone '' is encased between two actively accreting layers .",
    "the precise extent of this dead zone is difficult to assess , because the number density of free electrons depends on detailed chemistry as well as the dust grain size distribution , since dust grains tend to capture free electrons ( _ sano et al .",
    "_ , @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "if the disk dust is like the interstellar dust , the mri should be inhibited in large parts of the disk ( _ ilgner and nelson _ , @xcite ) , though this is still under debate ( e.g.  _ semenov et al .",
    "_ , @xcite ; ) .",
    "there are also other ( non - magnetic ) mechanisms for anomalous viscosity , like the baroclinic instability ( _ klahr and bodenheimer _ , @xcite ) or the shear instability ( _ dubrulle et al .",
    "_ , @xcite ) , which are still subject to some controversy ( see the recent review by _ gammie and johnson _ , @xcite ) .",
    "angular momentum can also be transferred by global torques , such as through gravitational spiral waves ( _ tohline and hachisu _",
    ", @xcite ; _ laughlin and bodenheimer _ , @xcite ; _ pickett et al . _ , @xcite and references therein ) or via global magnetic fields threading the disk ( _ stehle and spruit _ , @xcite ) ,",
    "possibly with hydromagnetic winds launched along them ( _ blandford and payne _ , @xcite ; _ reyes - ruiz and stepinski _ , @xcite ) .",
    "to avoid having to solve the problem of viscosity in detail , but still be able to produce sensible disk models , _ shakura and sunyaev _  ( @xcite ) introduced the `` @xmath8-prescription '' , based on dimensional arguments . in this recipe the vertically averaged viscosity @xmath9 at radius @xmath10 is written as @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the pressure scale height of the disk and @xmath13 is the isothermal sound speed , both evaluated at the disk midplane where most of the mass is concentrated .",
    "the parameter @xmath8 summarizes the uncertainties related to the sources of anomalous viscosity , and is often taken to be of the order of @xmath14 for sufficiently ionized disks .    from conservation of angular momentum ,",
    "the mass surface density @xmath15 of a _ steady _ disk ( i.e.  with a constant mass accretion rate @xmath16 ) , for radii much larger than the disk inner radius @xmath17 , can be written as @xmath18 . with @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the keplerian angular velocity",
    ", we see that for @xmath21 , @xmath22    as shown by fu ori and ex lupi type outbursts ( _ gammie and johnson _",
    ", @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "these outbursts can have various triggering mechanisms , such as thermal instability ( _ kawazoe and mineshige _ , @xcite ; _ bell and lin _ , @xcite ) ; close passage of a companion star ( _ bonnell and bastien _ @xcite ; _ clarke and syer _ , @xcite ) ; mass accumulation in the dead zone followed by gravitational instability ( _ gammie _ , @xcite ; _ armitage et al .",
    "_ , @xcite ) .",
    "disks are therefore quite time - varying , and constant @xmath8 steady disk models should be taken as zeroth - order estimates of the disk structure .    given the challenges of understanding the disk viscosity from first principles , attempts have been made to find observational constraints on disk evolution ( _ ruden and pollack _",
    ", @xcite ; _ cassen _ , @xcite ; _ hartmann et al . _ , @xcite ; _ stepinski _ , @xcite ) .",
    "for example , _ hartmann et al . _  ( @xcite ) study a large sample of cttss and find a decline in mass accretion rate with time , roughly described as @xmath23 , which they compare to the analytic similarity solutions of _ lynden - bell and pringle _  ( @xcite ) for the expanding disk .",
    "with the radial structure following from accretion physics , as described above , the next issue is the vertical structure of these disks .",
    "many authors have modeled this with full time - dependent 2d/3d ( magneto / radiation- ) hydrodynamics ( e.g. ,  _ boss _ , @xcite , @xcite ; _ yorke and bodenheimer _ , @xcite ; _ fromang et al .",
    "_ , @xcite ) .",
    "while this approach is obviously , it suffers from large computational costs , and often requires strong simplifying assumptions in the radiative transfer to keep the problem tractable . for comparison to these models",
    "are therefore less practical .",
    "the main objective of the models described in this section is the determination of the density and temperature structure of the disk . for a given surface density @xmath24 , and a given temperature structure @xmath25",

    "since the main source of opacity is the dust , most models so far make the assumption that the gas temperature is equal to the dust temperature ,    the temperature of the disk is set by a balance between heating and cooling .",
    "the disk cools by thermal emission from the dust grains at infrared wavelengths .",
    "this radiation is what is observed as infrared dust continuum radiation from such disks .",
    "line cooling is only a minor coolant , and only plays a role for @xmath31 when gas and dust are thermally decoupled .",

    "the stellar radiation impinges onto the flat disk under an irradiation angle @xmath33 ( with @xmath34 the stellar radius ) . neglecting viscous dissipation , the effective temperature of the disk",
    "is set by a balance between the irradiated flux ( with @xmath35 the stellar luminosity ) and blackbody cooling , which yields @xmath36 .",
    "the energetic domain of its sed therefore has a slope of @xmath37 with @xmath38 , follows from the that any disk with @xmath39 has an sed slope of @xmath40 .",

    "all but the most extreme group ii sources have a slope that is clearly inconsistent with that of a flat disk .",
    "it was recognized by _ kenyon and hartmann _  ( @xcite ) that a natural explanation for the strong far - infrared flux ( i.e.  shallow sed slope ) of most sources is a flaring geometry of the disk . the flaring geometry a significant portion of the stellar radiation at large radii where the disk is cool ,    where @xmath47 is the height above the midplane where the disk becomes optically thick to the impinging stellar radiation .",
    "a closer look at the physics of an irradiation - dominated disk ( be it flat or flared ) reveals that its surface temperature is generally higher than its interior temperature ( _ calvet et al .",
    "_ , @xcite ; _ malbet and bertout _ , @xcite ; ) . because of the shallow incidence angle of the stellar radiation @xmath48 , the _ vertical _ optical depth of this warm surface layer is very low",

    "the disk thickness and far - infrared flux can also be reduced by grain growth ( _ dalessio et al .",
    "_ , @xcite ; _ dullemond and dominik _ , @xcite ) .    from comparing infrared and ( sub-)millimeter spectra of the same sources ( _ acke et al .",
    "_ , @xcite ) , it is clear that the ( sub-)millimeter usually require mm - sized grains in the outer regions of the disk , while infrared dust emission features clearly prove that the disk surface layers are dominated by grains no larger than a few microns ( see ) .",
    "it appears that a bimodal size distribution can fit the observed spectra :      the very inner part of the disk is dust - free due to dust sublimation ( see for a discussion of this region ) . the dusty part of the disk can therefore be expected to have a relatively abrupt inner edge at about @xmath52 au for a 50@xmath53 star ( scaling roughly with @xmath54 ) .",

    "however , for meeus group ii sources these fits required relatively small disks ( see , however , section  [ subsec-2dtrans ] ) .",
    "the initial rim models were rather simplified , treating it as a vertical blackbody ` wall ' ( ddn01 ) .",
    "_ isella and natta _  ( @xcite ) improved this by noting that the weak dependence of the sublimation temperature on gas density is enough to strongly round off the rim .",
    "rounded - off rims appear to be more consistent with observations than the vertical ones : .",
    "there is still a worry , though , whether the rims can be high enough to fit sources with a strong near - infrared bump .    with near - infrared interferometry the rim can be spatially resolved , and thus the models can be tested .",
    "the measurements so far do not yet give images , but the measured ` visibilities ' can be compared to models .",
    "in this way one can measure the radius of the rim ( e.g. ,  _ monnier et al .",

    "most applications of these codes assume a given density distribution and compute spectra and images .",
    "there is a vast literature on such applications which we will not review here ( see ) .",

    "moreover , it is important to estimate how long disks remain gas - rich , and whether this is consistent with the formation time scale of gas giant planets ( _ hubickyj et al .",
    "_ , @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , gas lines often probe those regions of disks in which the gas temperature is difficult to compute .",
    "the disk models we described above assume that the gas temperature in the disk is always equal to the local dust temperature .",
    "while this is presumably true for most of the matter deep within optically thick disks , in the tenuous surface layers of these disks ( or throughout optically thin disks ) the densities become so low that the gas will thermally decouple from the dust .",

    ", the stellar radiation penetrates the disk under an irradiation angle @xmath56 like the one described in the previous section .",
    "this radiation gets diluted with increasing distance from the central star and attenuated by dust and gas along an _ inclined _ path into the disk .",
    "the stellar radiation therefore penetrates less deep into the disk than external uv radiation .",
    "the thermal balance of the gas in disks is solved by equating all relevant heating and cooling processes . for this gas thermal balance equation ,",
    "a limited set of key atomic and molecular species is sufficient : e.g. ,  h@xmath57 , co , oh , h@xmath57o , . for most atoms and molecules , the statistical equilibrium equation has to include the pumping of the fine structure and rotational levels by the cosmic background radiation , from the optical depth of the line ( similar to the approach of _ tielens and hollenbach _ , @xcite for pdrs ) .",
    "the optical depth used for this escape probability is the line optical depth in the _ vertical _ direction where the photons most readily escape .    of the most critical ingredients of these models",

    "this is why the complex surface structure models of section [ sec - surface ] are so important for fuv - driven photoevaporation .",

    "the effect of a strong stellar wind is such that the ram pressure reduces the scale height of the atmosphere above the disk and the euv photons are allowed to penetrate more easily to larger radii .",
    "this increases the mass - loss rate from the outer parts of the disk .",
    "it is noteworthy that the diffuse euv field , caused by recombining electrons and protons in the disk s ionized atmosphere inside @xmath96 , controls the euv - induced mass - loss rates ( _ hollenbach et  al .",
