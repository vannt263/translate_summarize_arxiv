    "soft magnetic composites ( smc ) have physical properties which are used for adapting these materials to specific applications @xcite,@xcite . very often the functionality of these materials depends on more than one feature .",
    "this leads to multi - criteria optimization problems , which has not been applied yet in the design of smc . however , there are papers which treat more than one physical property of smc but these are not considered as target functions in an optimization procedure @xcite,@xcite .",
    "recently an algorithm for designing values of the hardening temperature and the compaction pressure in the production process of soft magnetic composites ( smc ) has been derived by using the concept of the pseudo - state equation @xcite . in equilibrium thermodynamics",
    "the equation of state relates thermodynamic parameters .",
    "for instance , in the case of gas - liquid system they are the temperature , pressure and volume of the considered material . by analogy with the equation of state we consider a phenomenological relation between the technological parameters and physical properties of the material .",
    "such an approach for smc is possible thanks to the topology of the completed set of scaled power loss characteristics .",
    "the most important features of this topology are the following,@xcite :    set of characteristics consists of one variable smooth function @xmath2 where @xmath3 is density of power loss , @xmath4 is peak of induction , @xmath5 is frequency of electromagnetic field wave , @xmath6 is a function of the following form @xcite : @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 have to be determined from experimental data .",
    "the form ( [ uno ] ) has been derived from the assumption about the power losses as a homogeneous function in a general sense .",
    "each characteristic is determined by the values of @xmath10 coefficients and @xmath11 as well as @xmath9 exponents",
    ". these are functions of the technological parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 @xmath12 where @xmath0 and @xmath1 are hardening temperature and compaction pressure , respectively .",
    "( [ expony1 ] ) reveals that characteristics ( [ uno ] ) , ( [ equ ] ) of samples composed at different @xmath13 conditions possess different dimensions , whereas all disentangled characteristics @xmath14 possess a common physical dimension .",
    "why do we use the implicit form ( [ uno]),([equ ] ) ? note that the right - hand side of this equation depends only on one effective variable @xmath15 .",
    "therefore , calculations performed with ( [ uno]),([equ ] ) are represented by one curve for all values of @xmath5 and @xmath4 , whereas results of calculations performed with ( [ equ2 ] ) are split into many curves .",
    "for instance , if one needs @xmath3 as a function of @xmath5 then the number of generated characteristics is equal to the required number of different values of @xmath4 . because of the different dimensions of the different characteristics they do not cross each other except at origin point @xmath16 , for which dimension is not very important . according to the egenhofer theorem @xcite the relations between characteristics are invariant with respect to scaling , translation and rotation .",
    "just the conservation of the relations with respect to the scaling enables us to use the implicit form of characteristics .",
    "all the characteristics are monotonic increasing functions of @xmath15 according to ( [ expony1 ] ) the power loss characteristics are parameterized by pressure and temperature .",
    "this dependence enables us to introduce a measure of distance in the space of characteristics .",
    "let @xmath17 and @xmath18 be labels of the characteristics of the two composites which have been composed under conditions corresponding to these pressures and temperatures , respectively .",
    "then the distance between these characteristics has the following general form : @xmath19 where @xmath20 satisfies axioms of the distance function .",
    "therefore , the set of all characteristics constitutes metric space.we have shown in @xcite that this space consists of two subspaces .",
    "therefore , by introducing the distance measure in the space of all characteristics we make each of these subspaces compact .",
    "each compact set corresponds to physical phase which is defined by characteristic values of the physical parameters .",
    "for instance , in @xcite we considered the low and high losses phases of somaloy 500 .",
    "all the properties mentioned above are presented in fig .",
    "[ h_l_phas ] ; however , the compactness of characteristics subsets is ensured by the existence of ( [ distance ] ) .",
    "these properties have enabled us to introduce a measure of power loss @xmath21 which was the average of characteristics with respect to @xmath15 @xcite : @xmath22 note that the dimension of the denominator in front of the integral and the dimension of integration limits cancel themselves out .",
    "corresponding to the low losses phase and the one characteristic for @xmath23 corresponding to the high losses phase.,width=377 ]    from the topological properties of the characteristics set and on ( [ expony1 ] ) as well as on ( [ v1 ] ) the pseudo - state equation for soft magnetic composites has been derived .",
    "this equation has enabled us to determine the optimal values of the technological parameters @xcite .",
    "however , the described optimization relates only to the power losses and in design processes optimization of induction is also important .",
    "therefore , the goal of this paper is to create a new algorithm for optimization of both the power losses and the induction within the frame of a bicriteria problem .",
    "specimens were produced by cold pressing under pressure of 500@xmath24900 mpa .",
    "the specimens made of somaloy 500 powder were cured at a temperature of 400@xmath24600@xmath25c for 30 minutes in air atmosphere .",
    "the specimens used in experiments were ring - shaped with a square cross - section .",
    "the specimens had the following dimensions : external diameter 55 mm , internal diameter 45 mm and thickness 5 mm .",
    "total power loss density @xmath3 , expressed in watts per kilogram ( w/ kg ) , was obtained from measurements of the ac hysteresis cycle according to iec standard 60404 - 6 using the system amh-20k - hs produced by laboratorio elettrofisico walker ldj scientific .",
    "total power losses@xmath26 were measured at maximum flux density @xmath4 = 0.1  1.3 t over a frequency range of 10 to 5000 hz . during measurements of the total power losses @xmath3 , the shape factor of the secondary voltage was equal to 1.111@xmath271.5 % .",
    "maximum measurement error of the total energy losses was equal to 3% . in order to optimize the magnetic properties , the magnetic inductions",
    "@xmath28 at fixed magnetic field @xmath29 equal to 1000 a / m were determined .",
    "these values were obtained from measurements of the dc magnetization curve according to iec standard 60404 - 4 using the same measuring system .",
    "optimization of the power losses was based on the topological properties of the characteristics .",
    "however , in the case of magnetic properties the situation is much simpler . for optimization of magnetic properties we selected induction @xmath30 for the fixed magnetic field @xmath29=1000@xmath31a",
    "/ m@xmath32 .",
    "we chose this value because the magnetic permeability of the soft magnetic composites reaches a maximum value around this magnetic field .",
    "we expected that the pseudo - state equation would properly describe induction at this point as a function of @xmath0 and @xmath1 . in the previous paper @xcite it",
    "was assumed and confirmed that the loss measure @xmath33 obeys the scaling . here , this assumption was extended to induction . in order to justify this assumption we referred to two phenomena : invariance of power losses ( area of the hysteresis loop ) with respect to scaling and invariance of the hysteresis loop with respect to scaling @xcite .",
    "therefore , for the bicriteria optimization problem , minimization of the power losses and maximization of the induction for a fixed magnetic field , we used the following pseudo - state equations of general form :    @xmath34    @xmath35    where @xmath36    where @xmath37 and @xmath38 were arbitrary functions to be determined .",
    "@xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 are scaling exponents and scaling parameters respectively , and were to be determined . in the case of the power losses",
    "pseudo - state equation all calculations concerning modelling of @xmath37 and fitting of scaling exponents as well as model parameters were done in @xcite .",
    "the most important result was the derivation of an infinite set of solutions for the technological parameters which minimized the power losses : @xmath47",
    "in this section we derive a pseudo - state equation for induction @xmath30 which will constitute a function of the two variables @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "this function and the power losses pseudo - state equation ( [ general2 ] ) will enable us to optimize induction and losses together .",
    "the optimization criteria are the following : find @xmath48 and @xmath49 with respect to @xmath1 and @xmath0 . deriving in @xcite the form for @xmath50 we reveal two phases of somaloy 500 : low losses and high losses .",
    "therefore , in terms of the induction pseudo - state equation we have to take into account this phase separation .",
    "measurement data of @xmath30 vs. @xmath0 and @xmath1 are separated into these two phases in table [ table : table2 ] .",
    ".somaloy 500 .",
    "measure of induction @xmath30 vs. hardening temperature @xmath0 and compaction pressure @xmath1 for magnetic field @xmath29=1000 @xmath31a / m@xmath32 . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "all calculations in this section have to satisfy the following conditions : @xmath51 , which results from limitation of the presented calculations to the low losses phase presented in fig .",
    "[ fig.2 ] .",
    "the considered bicriteria problem is formulated by the initial value of @xmath52 , feasible set of @xmath53 and the two criteria : @xmath54 whereas @xmath55 .",
    "since increase of @xmath30 causes increase of @xmath33 these conditions are in contradiction . therefore looked for solving criterion should lead to self- consistency between @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "such consistency will be achieved as a fixed point of the following recurrence procedure .",
    "let maximiztion and minimization procedures be reprezented by the operators @xmath58 and @xmath59 , respectively .",
    "let @xmath60 and @xmath21 be functions defined by @xmath61 and @xmath62 respectively",
    ". then the one step of independent optimizations of @xmath60 and @xmath21 can be writen in the following form : @xmath63 the obtained result consits of the two points @xmath64 and the corresponding values of magnitudes to be optimized @xmath65 and @xmath66 . therefore ,",
    "any further optimization is not possible and the bicriteria problem is not solved . in order to mesh @xmath67 and @xmath56 we introduce constrain @xmath68 which protects ( [ r2 ] ) and ( [ r3 ] ) against collapse , where @xmath69 is an initial value of loss",
    ". then ( [ r2 ] ) get the following form which coupled @xmath67 and @xmath56 as well as leaved some space for further optimization : @xmath70 having @xmath65 we protect ( [ r3 ] ) against collapse : @xmath71 therefore , after @xmath72 steps we obtain : @xmath73 ( [ r4])-([r7 ] ) generate the two converging series : @xmath74 and @xmath75 : @xmath76 substituting @xmath77 and @xmath78 to @xmath61 and @xmath62 we derive the meshed values of @xmath33 and @xmath30 : @xmath79 the found solutions are not unique . selecting set of initial values for @xmath80",
    "we derive the set of final solutions .",
    "optimization has been done by solver routine of excel2010 program .",
    "obtained output is presented in table [ table : tableb ] .",
    "fig.[fig.3 ] and fig.[fig.4 ] present these results in technological and in physical spaces , respectively .",
    "the obtained results represented by markers are fixed points of the proposed procedure .",
    "there is one to one correspondence between these points in physical and technological spaces ( table [ table : tableb ] ) . in order to select an unique solution one must provide an additional criterion resulting from a relation between importance of losses and induction . for instance , assuming the deepest minimum for the scaled measure of losses @xmath81 we apply condition given by ( [ optim ] ) .",
    "intersection of two curves presented in fig.[fig.4nowy ] leads to the following single solution @xmath82 and @xmath83 . in the physical space",
    "this point corresponds to @xmath84 and @xmath85 .    at the end",
    "we pay some attention to the power losses measure @xmath33 .",
    "this is an auxiliary magnitude which help us to derive values of designing technological parameters due to the following features :    * @xmath33 is pseudo - thermodynamic average with respect to magnitude created with the peak of induction and the frequency of electromagnetic field wave .",
    "therefore , this includes information about both independent variables . *",
    "@xmath33 depends on the technological parameters . *",
    "physical dimension of @xmath33 is unknown yet due to a dummy exponent @xmath9 .",
    "however , the value of @xmath33 is well determined together with values of @xmath1 and @xmath0 which enables us to compose smc specimen and to perform measurements of its characteristics . finally , applying ( [ uno]),([equ ] ) we are able to calculate @xmath9 and to determine the physical dimension of the current @xmath33 .",
    "we have presented method for the bicriteria optimization of the chosen physical properties of soft magnetic composites . by this way we have solved the problem mentioned in @xcite which concerns optimization of losses and induction .",
    "achievement of the fixed point is interpreted as revelation of an equilibrium between the both assumed criteria.the crucial roles in the presented method play scaling and the notion of pseudo - state equation .",
    "the created system is as good as the experimental data which have been used for the estimations of model parameters .",
    "therefore , presented here the first version will be improved by forthcoming new experimental data .",
    "the presented example in this paper is a minimum nontrivial case of multiphysics problem and shows that this approach suits for designing magnetic composites .",
    "therefore , the presented algorithm is going to be extended for more than two physical features of the composing material .",
    "for instance , the designing of magnetic composites requires also optimization of mechanical properties , since the susceptibility of such materials to cracking in service is of fundamental concern @xcite .",
