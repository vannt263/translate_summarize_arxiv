    "according to classical electrodynamics a charged particle ( an electron , for definiteness ) accelerated by a background electromagnetic field emits radiation  @xcite . in the underlying quantum theory , qed ,",
    "the radiation process is rather described as the emission of photons by the electron @xcite . due to energy - momentum conservation",
    "a free electron is stable and can not emit photons .",
    "the scattering of an electron with a single photon is known as ( linear ) compton scattering . in general , the simultaneous interaction of an electron with many photons is suppressed by the appearance in the interaction probabilities of a corresponding power of the fine - structure constant @xmath0 . however , if the electron interacts with a coherent collection of photons , like those in a laser beam , the effective coupling strength appearing in perturbative expansions is not just @xmath1 , but it also depends on the typical amplitude and angular frequency of the laser field @xcite .",
    "qualitatively it is clear that a laser field characterized by an amplitude @xmath2 and by an angular frequency @xmath3 is able to transfer to the electron ( charge @xmath4 and mass @xmath5 ) a number of photons of the order of @xmath6 in the typical qed length @xmath7 ( compton wavelength ) @xcite .",
    "thus , at @xmath8 the probability for the electron of exchanging more than one photon with the laser field is not suppressed and the laser - electron interaction has to be taken into account exactly in the calculations . from a classical point of view , the condition @xmath8 corresponds to the onset of relativistic effects in the electron dynamics , which render the latter nonlinear with respect to the laser amplitude .",
    "now , if the electron enters a plane - wave field with a four - momentum @xmath9 , with @xmath10 , and in the process of photon emission it absorbs @xmath11 laser photons , due to the doppler effect , the typical energy @xmath12 of the emitted photon is of the order of @xmath13 , where @xmath14 with @xmath15 being the plane - wave s four - wave - vector and @xmath16 being the so - called `` critical field '' of qed  @xcite .",
    "the above estimate of the typical energy of the emitted photon is valid for @xmath17 . a constant and uniform electric field of the order of @xmath18 provides an @xmath19-@xmath20 pair with an energy comparable to its rest energy @xmath21 on a distance of the order of @xmath22 , such that the qed vacuum becomes unstable in the presence of such a strong field under @xmath19-@xmath20 pair creation  @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath23 controls the importance of photon recoil , which becomes essential at @xmath24 .",
    "the emission of a single photon in the regime @xmath25 is known as nonlinear single compton scattering and it has been studied thoroughly in the literature @xcite .    although initial electron wave - packets have been considered in some studies about thomson scattering  @xcite , and the general problem of the radiation emitted by a classical distribution of charges is a well - known problem in the free - electron - laser community  @xcite , in the study of nonlinear compton scattering , to the knowledge of the authors , the initial state of the electron has been mostly taken as having a definite momentum . in experiments , however , an electron in a beam has some characteristic indeterminacy in the momentum and is localized to some extent ; motivated by this fact , we will consider below that the electron is initially in a superposition of states of different momenta , i.e. , in a wave - packet , and , among other aspects , we study whether it is possible to observe interference effects among different components of the wave - packet .",
    "we do this in the framework of strong - field qed within the furry picture  @xcite . in  @xcite a scalar qed calculation with an initial particle described by a wave - packet",
    "shows how for nonlinear single compton scattering in a monochromatic plane - wave electromagnetic field the different components of the electron wave - packet do not interfere .",
    "this result has been extended in  @xcite to spinor qed in pulsed fields .",
    "we will show in the following a different derivation of the same result , and in addition we will investigate in detail the effects of the initial electron s wave - packet on the emitted radiation .",
    "peak laser intensities have been recently increasing dramatically due to the development of two techniques , chirped pulse amplification ( cpa )  @xcite and optical parametric chirped pulse amplification ( opcpa )  @xcite .",
    "all today s most intense lasers , like vulcan  @xcite , astra - gemini  @xcite , hercules  @xcite , berkeley lab laser accelerator ( bella )  @xcite , and planned ones , such as the extreme light infrastructure  @xcite , the high power laser energy research facility  @xcite , apollon  @xcite , and the exawatt center for extreme light studies ( xcels )  @xcite , are based on either one of these techniques .",
    "both cpa and opcpa generate , after the amplification of an initial pulse , an ultrashort laser pulse ; it is thus likely that this kind of pulses will be adopted in experiments to probe the nonlinear qed regime .",
    "thus , we will consider the laser field in our calculations to be an ultrashort pulse .    to the current date ,",
    "the record for the highest laser intensity ever achieved is held by the hercules facility , that reached a peak intensity of @xmath26 ( @xmath27 at @xmath28 ) , and lasers with peak intensity @xmath29 are readily available in many facilities .",
    "it is harder , however , to reach values of the parameter @xmath23 close to unity . starting from [ eq : chi ] , and substituting the previously given definition of @xmath18 , one can write @xmath30 ; the factor @xmath31 makes it necessary , in order to have a @xmath23 close to unity at optical frequencies , to use ultrarelativistic electrons ( even for large values of @xmath32 ) . nowadays",
    ", ultrarelativistic electron beams can be conveniently produced also at laser facilities via the wakefield acceleration technique  @xcite .",
    "although intense pulses are usually focused almost down to diffraction limit , we will model them as plane waves .",
    "this approximation is valid if the electron collides nearly head - on with the laser field and almost at the focus of the latter , provided that the transverse excursion of the electron is much smaller than the laser waist size , which occurs if @xmath33  @xcite . within the plane - wave approximation , the approach based on the furry picture can be conveniently applied as the dirac equation in a plane - wave field can be solved exactly .",
    "approximate solutions can be also found , however , for a field of more complex structure like a gaussian laser beam if the conditions @xmath34 and @xmath35 are fulfilled  @xcite .    in most of the numerical work",
    "performed to obtain the results in this paper , one of the main challenges is to perform integrals of highly oscillating functions ; typical quadrature schemes can not be adopted , since they become more and more inaccurate as the frequency of the oscillations of the integrand increases .",
    "thus , we have used filon s method  @xcite to deal with this kind of integrals .",
    "the basic idea behind it is to put an highly oscillating integral in the form @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is a smooth and sufficiently well behaved function , @xmath38 is a constant , and @xmath39 is an interval in @xmath40 ; then divide @xmath39 in some subintervals @xmath41 , sufficiently small that in each of them the function @xmath37 can be accurately approximated with a quadratic polynomial . then , in each subinterval the starting integrals are approximated by a weighted sum of terms each having the form @xmath42 , where @xmath43 , and each of these integrals can be evaluated analytically .",
    "the advantage of this method is that the accuracy of the estimate increases with increasing @xmath44 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in [ sec : theo ] , we present the general theory of the scattering of an electron in a superposition of states with different momenta and a short intense laser pulse and we show that interference effects among states with different momenta are not present . in [ sec : diffpz ] , we study the particular case of an electron wave - packet colliding head - on with a laser pulse and of normally distributed longitudinal momentum , while in [ sec : multi ] we investigate the more general case where there is also an indeterminacy on the transverse components of the momentum . through the rest of the article , natural units ( @xmath45 ) are adopted , and the electromagnetic units used are such that the qed coupling constant is @xmath46 .",
    "in the computation of nonlinear single compton scattering rates , perturbative approaches with respect to the laser field can quickly become impractical , when a sufficiently strong incoming electromagnetic field is considered .",
    "in fact , as we mentioned in the introduction , for an incoming laser field such that @xmath47 the exchange of many photons between the laser and the electron becomes important and perturbative calculations up to a very high order would be necessary .",
    "typically , however , such intense fields consist of an enormous number of coherent photons ; this makes it possible  @xcite to neglect the quantum nature of the background field and to treat it as a classical given electromagnetic field . by working within this approximation , one can split the electromagnetic field four - vector potential into two parts : a classical part , that accounts for the intense laser field , and a quantized part , that accounts for all the other excitations of the electromagnetic field , i.e. , the radiation emitted by the electron .",
    "after that , the electron - positron field is quantized by taking into account exactly the background laser field .",
    "this is the so - called furry picture of qed  @xcite , which we mentioned in the introduction , and all the following calculations are performed within this formalism .",
    "we assume that the incoming laser field is described by the linearly - polarized plane - wave four - vector potential @xmath48 here , @xmath49 is a constant four - vector , where @xmath50 defines the laser polarization , with amplitude @xmath51 related to the peak laser s intensity @xmath52 as @xmath53 , and @xmath54 is a function of the laser phase @xmath55 describing the shape of the plane wave and such that @xmath56 .",
    "it is convenient to use a frame of reference in which one of the spatial axes ( in our case the @xmath57 axis , for the sake of definiteness ) is directed along @xmath58 , and another one ( without loss of generality , we can choose @xmath59 ) is directed along the same direction as @xmath50 ( see [ fig : for ] ) .",

    "the physical reason behind the absence of interference is that , in principle , by measuring the final state of the electron and of the emitted photon one can retrieve the initial momentum of the electron , and so the initial state of the electron amongst the ones contained in the initial superposition .",
    "the results we presented so far allow us to state that , as far as one is interested in nonlinear single compton scattering rates , the state of the initial electron can be described equivalently either with a superposition of states like the one in [ eq : super ] or as a statistical mixture @xmath130 where the weighting function @xmath94 is the same of [ eq : super ] and @xmath131 .",

    "the above results can be easily explained as a result of the doppler effect . for the sake of simplicity",
    "we consider here the idealized case of a monochromatic laser field ( with laser photon energy @xmath3 ) . in this case , in fact , the frequency of the @xmath151 harmonic emission along the negative @xmath57 direction is given by @xcite @xmath152 where @xmath153 and where we have introduced the dimensionless parameter @xmath154 by means of a first - order expansion with respect to the shift @xmath155 , we can estimate the relative shift of these frequencies when slightly changing the value of @xmath150 : @xmath156 in the case of an ultrarelativistic electron and in the relevant regime @xmath34 , it is @xmath157 and @xmath158 , such that we obtain @xmath159 as it can be easily shown , the quantity @xmath160 increases monotonically with the harmonic number , in agreement with the findings in fig .",

    "it is thus interesting to compare the relative shift due to an uncertainty of @xmath150 to the one due to an indeterminacy on the value of @xmath3 . in analogy to what we have discussed for  [ eq : varipz ] , one can derive a similar relation , for a variation @xmath161 of the laser angular frequency . by adding the resulting expression to [ eq : varipz ] and by assuming again that @xmath162 and @xmath163 , it is possible to obtain the first - order relative variation of @xmath164 with respect to the relative variations of @xmath3 and @xmath150 as : @xmath165 since @xmath166 it is clear that for comparable relative variations in @xmath3 and @xmath150 , the induced shift due to the spread in the incoming electron momentum is larger . from the aforementioned properties of the emitted photon s spectrum of a monochromatic initial electron",
    "we can infer the final spectrum when the state @xmath95 of [ eq : super ] is considered , since the emission spectrum resulting from that state , as it was shown above , is a weighted average of monochromatic emission spectra with different @xmath150 .",
    "the sharp peaks present in the spectrum for a fixed value of @xmath150 will be differently shifted and will tend to fill the valleys present in the spectrum relative to another value of @xmath150 ; when averaging many of these spectra , the net effect is a smoothing of the final spectra and a decrease of the yield as compared to the latter obtained at the peaks in the monochromatic case .",
    "moreover , we have already mentioned the fact that the shift induced by the spread in the electron momentum is larger for higher emission frequencies .",
    "thus , the portion of the spectrum that will be smoothed earlier , i.e. , even for relatively small values of @xmath167 , is that at high frequencies of the emitted photon .",
    "indeed , this is the result we obtain in [ fig : dist ] , where the final photon energy spectrum for different values of @xmath167 is plotted ( the numerical parameters are the same as in [ fig : monochp3 ] and the average value of the initial momentum of the electron is @xmath168 ) .",

    "even when the relative indeterminacy on the momentum is only @xmath170 , we can see that the height of the highest peaks is reduced by a factor of about two , and all the oscillatory features at @xmath176 are completely washed out ( see fig .",

    "the numerical parameters are the same as in [ fig : distzpos ] . ]    in the numerical spectra in [ fig : distzpos ] and [ fig : distang ] , the average initial momentum of the electron is @xmath224 , and the indeterminacy on the transverse components is @xmath229 , while the one on the @xmath57-component is @xmath230 ( these parameters for the electron beam are compatible with those in @xcite ) .",
    "the intensity of the laser field is @xmath231 ( @xmath203 , @xmath232 as calculated from the average electron momentum ) .    in [ fig : distzpos ] and [ fig : distang ] one",
    "can see that for the chosen values of the parameters @xmath223 and @xmath167 , the most dramatic alteration of the spectrum is due to the transverse momentum spread of the electron beam , even though its value is orders of magnitude smaller than the spread on @xmath150 . in fact , the effect due to @xmath233 is so dominant that switching on also the longitudinal spread @xmath167 has no observable effect on the emitted spectrum ( the dotted red curve is on top of the short - dashed orange one in both [ fig : distzpos ] and [ fig : distang ] ) . as a result ,",

    "the numerical parameters are the same as in [ fig : distzpos ] , except that @xmath235 . ]",
    "we also show in [ fig : hixi ] the energy emission along a direction that lies on the laser polarization plane and forms an angle @xmath234 with the negative z - axis for @xmath236 ( the parameters used for [ fig : hixi ] are the same of [ fig : distang ] , except that @xmath237 corresponding to @xmath238 ) ; the qualitative behavior for nonzero values of @xmath167 and @xmath223 is the the same as the one previously discussed .",
    "we should emphasize that , as we have already mentioned in the discussion below eq .",
    "( [ delta_omegap ] ) , the larger effect due to the transverse momentum uncertainty is also related to the fact that the considered spectra refer to some specific observation directions .",
    "in fact , if we integrate with respect to the emission angles the spectrum corresponding to the numerical parameters in [ fig : hixi ] , we obtain the results in [ fig : angintegrated ] ; they show that the total emitted energy as a function of @xmath239 changes only at frequencies @xmath240 and that it is almost not affected by the momentum spreading of the incoming wave - packet .",
    "the higher rates observed at these frequencies in the case of a wave - packet with @xmath221 ( see inset of [ fig : angintegrated ] ) can be explained as some components of the wave - packet have energies larger than @xmath219 .    .",
    "]    in order to analyze the properties of the emitted radiation in the spatial domain , one can integrate @xmath241 with respect to @xmath239 and obtain the total energy emitted along each direction .",
    "a typical result of this procedure is shown in [ fig : total ] .",
    "on the right panel the energy emitted per steradian by an electron in a gaussian wave - packet is plotted ( the numerical parameters are the same as in [ fig : hixi ] ) .",
    "the left panel shows the same quantity but emitted by an electron in a volkov state with a definite momentum given by the @xmath242 of the mentioned gaussian wave - packet . in [ fig : total ] the polar angle @xmath243 and the azimuthal angle @xmath244 are indicated assuming the negative @xmath57-axis as polar axis .    .",
    "]    as mentioned above , when the electron is initially in a pure volkov state , and the laser is linearly polarized , the angular aperture of the emitted radiation is @xmath215 ( @xmath214 ) along the polarization ( magnetic - field ) direction , which is confirmed by the the left panel in [ fig : total ] .",
    "the emission in the case of a multivariate gaussian wave - packet , in the right panel of [ fig : total ] , extends over a broader region and is thus less intense , in the regime where @xmath223 and @xmath167 are much smaller than @xmath162 .",
    "in fact , at @xmath190 , if @xmath245 and @xmath246 , the total energy emitted when the electron is either in a volkov state or in a gaussian wave - packet is almost the same ( see fig . [",
    "fig : angintegrated ] ) .",
    "then , as the region of emission becomes broader , the radiation intensity in the gaussian wave - packet case decreases .",
    "we briefly notice here that this effect might be also exploited in principle as a diagnostic tool of the momentum spreading of the electron beam , provided that the laser parameters like its intensity are known with sufficiently high accuracy .",
    "in the present article we have studied nonlinear single compton scattering by an incoming electron described by a wave - packet of volkov states .",
    "we have obtained that the conservation of energy and momentum forbids interference effects among different momentum components of the wave - packet , even if the electron is originally in a superposition of volkov states .",
    "this means that an incoming electron wave - packet can be equivalently described in this respect as a superposition of states or as a statistical mixture .",
    "the net effect of having a wave - packet as initial electron state is a lowering and a smoothing of the angular resolved emission spectrum for an electron in a state with definite momentum ; this effect tends to be more pronounced than the non - monochromaticity of the laser pulse ( at comparable relative uncertainties in the electron and in the laser - photon energy ) .",
    "furthermore , for realistic values of the properties of the electron wave - packet as compared with those available experimentally for electron beams , the transverse momentum spread , even if orders of magnitude smaller than the longitudinal one , dominates the alterations on the structures and on the shape of the emission spectrum at a fixed observation direction . we have observed that a broadening of the angular emission region takes also place in the case of an electron wave - packet with respect to the case of a monoenergetic electron .",
    "however , by integrating the spectra over the observation directions , their dependence on the spreading of the initial wave packet is strongly suppressed .",
