    "casimir s calculation of the force between two neutral , parallel conducting plates originally inspired much theoretical interest as macroscopic manifestation of quantum fluctuation of the field in vacuum .",
    "however , the casimir effect arises not only in the presence of material boundaries , but also in spaces with non - euclidean topology@xcite .",
    "the simplest example of the casimir effect of topological origin is the scalar field on a flat manifold with topology of a circle @xmath7 .",
    "the topology of @xmath7 causes the periodicity condition @xmath8 for a hermitian scale field @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the circumference of @xmath7 , imposed on the wave function which is of the same kind as those due to boundary and resulting in an attractive casimir force .",
    "similarly , the antiperiodic conditions can be drawn on a mbius strip and bring about the repulsive casimir force as a result .",
    "recently , the topology of the helix boundary conditions is investigated in ref.@xcite .",
    "we find that the casimir effect is very much like the effect on a spring that obeys the hooke s law in mechanics .",
    "however , in this case , the pressure comes from a quantum effect , so we would like to call this structure a quantum spring .",
    "the pressurre is negative in both massless and massive scalar cases for this structure@xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that the concept of quotient topology is very useful for concrete application .",
    "we consider a surjective mapping @xmath11 from a topological space @xmath12 onto a set @xmath13 .",
    "the quotient topology on @xmath13 with respect to @xmath11 is given in @xcite .",
    "surjective mapping can be easily obtained when we use the equivalence classes of some equivalence relation @xmath14 .",
    "thus , we let @xmath15 denote the set of equivalence classes and define @xmath16 by @xmath17 $ ] the equivalence class containing @xmath18 . @xmath15 with the quotient topology is called to be obtained from @xmath12 by topological identification . for example , if we take the rectangle @xmath19 in @xmath20 with the induced topology and define an equivalence relation @xmath14 on @xmath13 by @xmath21 or @xmath22 and @xmath23 , then @xmath24 with the quotient topology is homomorphic to the cylinder @xmath25 can be drawn on the topology of a cylinder .",
    "similarly , we define another equivalence relation @xmath14 on @xmath13 by @xmath26 or @xmath27 and @xmath28 , then @xmath24 with the quotient topology is homomorphic to a torus @xmath29 .",
    "the boundary conditions @xmath30 and @xmath31can be drawn on the topology of the torus . in this paper",
    ", we will consider the helix torus topology using the concept of quotient topology .",
    "the @xmath32-function regularization procedure is a powerful and elegant technique for the casimir effect @xcite .",
    "the generalized @xmath32-function has many interesting applications , e.g. , in the piecewise string @xcite .",
    "similar analysis has been applied to rectangular cavity @xcite-@xcite , noncommutative spacetime@xcite , p - branes @xcite or pistons @xcite-@xcite .",
    "casimir effect for a fractional boundary condition is of interest in considering , for example , the finite temperature casimir effect for a scalar field with fractional neumann conditions @xcite , while the repulsive force from fractional boundary conditions has been studied @xcite .",
    "the chowla - selberg formula of the @xmath32-function has been applied to quantize the wheelar - dewitt equation @xcite and recently to calculate the casimir energies of cylinders @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the casimir effect of a scalar field with a helix torus boundary condition in the flat ( @xmath0)-dimensional spacetime . the chowla - selberg formula and its generalization are used to regularize the casimir energy density .",
    "we obtain the exact results of the casimir energy and pressure for any @xmath1 for both massless and massive scalar fields .",
    "the numerical calculation indicates that once the topology of spacetime is fixed , the ratio of the sizes of the helix will be a decisive factor . in massless case",
    ", there is a critical value @xmath2 of the ratio @xmath3 of the lengths at which the pressure vanishes .",
    "the pressure changes from negative to positive as the ratio @xmath3 passes through @xmath2 increasingly . in massive case",
    ", we compare the pressure of massive field with massless one and find the pressure tends to the result of massless field when the mass approaches zero .",
    "furthermore , we find there is also a critical ratio @xmath33 at which the pressure vanishes . at the same time , there is another critical ratio of the lengths @xmath4 and the pressure is independent of the mass at @xmath5 in the @xmath6 case .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "2 we introduce a specified helix topology for the flat spacetime . in sec .",
    "3 we consider the evaluation of the casimir effect for massless and massive cases .",
    "the results are summarized in sec .",
    "the casimir effect arises not only in the presence of material boundaries , but also in spaces with non - euclidean topology .",
    "first , we consider a specified 2-dimensional helix topology which may be obtained by identifying some or whole in a series of rectangles as a pedagogical discussion .",
    "the whole situation concerning the helix boundary conditions in this and similar cases is discussed in @xcite in great detail . in fig .",
    "1(a ) , the cylinder is obtained by identifying some of the boundary points of a rectangle , in which we intend to identify the two edges .",
    "this is often indicated by labeling the two points of edges with the same letter , such as a , b. similarly , we may obtain a torus ( see fig .",
    "1(b ) ) . furthermore",
    ", a helix torus topology can occur by identifying both distinct rectangles and the boundary points at the same rectangle(see fig .",
    "1(c ) ) .    before we consider a helix torus topology in the flat ( @xmath1 + 1)-dimensional spacetime @xmath34 using the concept of quotient topology , we have to discuss the lattices .",
    "a lattice @xmath35 is defined as a set of points @xmath36 where @xmath37 is a set of basis vectors of @xmath34 . in terms of the components",
    "@xmath38 of vectors @xmath39 , we define the inner products as @xmath40 with @xmath41 for @xmath42 , @xmath43 for otherwise . in the @xmath44 plane ,",
    "the sublattice @xmath45 are @xmath46 and @xmath47 the unit cell is the set of points @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 is a symbol of identity relation .",
    "next , we choose topological space @xmath51 as @xmath52 in @xmath34 with the induced topology and define an equivalence relation @xmath14 on @xmath51 by @xmath53 , then @xmath54 with the quotient topology is a new type topology which can be called a helix torus topology .",
    "this topology causes the helix boundary condition for a hermitian scalar field @xmath55 and the periodicity boundary conditions @xmath56 and @xmath57 it is worth noting that eq.([eq8 ] ) can be derived from eqs.([eq6 ] ) and ( [ eq7 ] ) , or eq.([eq7 ] ) derived from eqs.([eq6 ] ) and ( [ eq8 ] ) .",
    "therefore , we need only one of the two periodicity boundary conditions .",
    "in calculations on the casimir effect , extensive use is made of eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the corresponding field equation .",
    "a hermitian scalar field @xmath58 defined in the ( @xmath0)-dimensional flat spacetime satisfies the klein - gordon equation : @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 is the mass of the scalar field . under the boundary condition ( [ eq6 ] ) and ( [ eq7 ] ) , the modes of the field are then @xmath62 where @xmath63 is a normalization factor and @xmath64 , and we have @xmath65 here , @xmath66 and @xmath67 satisfy @xmath68 @xmath69 where @xmath70 and the constraint condition @xmath71 . in the ground state ( vacuum ) , each of these modes contributes an energy of @xmath72 .",
    "the energy density of the field is thus given by    @xmath73    where we have assumed @xmath74 and @xmath75 without losing generalities and the prime on the summation means that @xmath76 have to be omitted .",
    "remember that there are no material boundaries here and the casimir effect arises owing to the nontrivial topology .",
    "this allows us to define not only the separation - dependent global energy but also the energy density as above .    using the mathematical identity @xmath77 eq.([eq14 ] )",
    "can be reduced to @xmath78^{\\frac{d-1}2}.\\label{eq16}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    on the other hand , the generalized chowla - selberg formula was given firstly by elizalde et .",

    "we discuss the massless and massive cases respectively .      in the massless case @xmath86 , using eq .",

    "it is worth noting that the pressure can also be obtained from the component of the energy - momentum tensor which has the physical meaning of a pressure .    by the numerical calculation",
    ", we have @xmath95 when @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "it is obvious that @xmath98 is negative if @xmath99 and is positive if @xmath100 since the first and fourth terms are negative and the second and third terms are positive in eq.([eq23 ] ) .",

    "2 is the illustration of the behavior of the pressure on @xmath92 direction for @xmath6 .",
    "the curves correspond to @xmath103 respectively .",
    "it is clearly seen that for a given @xmath104 , the negative pressure become positive with @xmath105 increasing .",
