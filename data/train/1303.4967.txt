    "the results presented below and in the next subsection are calculated at the energy 100 mev above the @xmath4 production .    as discussed in section iv.d ,",
    "our main task is to use eq.([eq : diffcrsec ] ) to examine the dependence of the differential cross section @xmath272 of this process on the @xmath4-@xmath5 potential @xmath273 .",
    "obviously , we need to identify the region of the outgoing proton angle @xmath274 with respect to the incident photon where the @xmath4-@xmath5 re - scattering mechanism ( ( c ) of fig.[fg : diag ] ) dominates .",
    "we find that this is in the region close to @xmath275 , as can be seen in the left side of fig.[fg : phodpm ] .",
    "we see that in the low @xmath4 momentum , @xmath276 about 200 mev , the contribution from the @xmath4 re - scattering term ( blue dotted curve ) is much larger than that from the other two mechanisms . on the other hand , the impulse term dominates at @xmath277 as seen in the right side of fig.[fg : phodpm ] .",
    "accordingly , three @xmath4-@xmath5 potentials with the strengths @xmath278 , @xmath279 , and @xmath280 obtained by the effective field theory approach and lqcd can be easily tested at @xmath275 , but less possible at @xmath281 .",
    "this is shown in fig.[fg : phodjn ] .",
    "the results presented above clearly indicate that it is highly desirable to have data in the region close to @xmath275 in future experiments in order to be able to determine the @xmath4-@xmath5 interaction .      for the calculated @xmath235 of the @xmath282 reaction",
    ", we find that the impulse term dominates at all angles .",
    "furthermore , the contributions from the @xmath4-@xmath5 re - scattering ( fig.[fg : diag](c ) ) are weaker than those of the @xmath7 re - scattering ( fig.[fg : diag](b ) ) . nevertheless , the data from experiments on this reaction can be useful to determine the @xmath4-@xmath5 interaction .",
    "this is illustrated in fig.[fg : pinpid ] where the results from @xmath283 , @xmath279 , and @xmath280 for @xmath275 and @xmath284 are compared .      with the vector meson dominance hypothesis",
    ", we can predict the cross section of @xmath155 within the constructed coupled - channel model .",
    "this is done by using the amplitude given in eq.([eq : gn - jn ] ) . for three coupled - channel amplitudes calculated with @xmath286 , @xmath279 , and @xmath280 for @xmath287 ,",
    "our results are compared with that of the pomeron - exchange model ( green dot - dashed curve ) in the left of fig.[fg : phpphd ] .",
    "we note that the coupled - channel model results are expected to be valid only at energies near @xmath4 production threshold where the data are rather uncertain . on the other hand ,",
    "the use of pomeron - exchange model at very low energies is also questionable . our results for @xmath18 are close to the three data points near 4.5 gev . at @xmath288 about 5",
    "gev , we clearly need to improve the model",
    ". the data from the forthcoming experiment@xcite at jlab will be useful to clarify the situation .    in the right side of fig.[fg :",
    "phpphd ] , we show that the coupled - channel effects can increase the cross section significantly .",
    "our results here as well as that shown in fig.[fg : pin - cc ] suggest that any attempt to determine the @xmath4-@xmath5 interaction must include the coupled - channel effects , as required by the unitarity condition .",
    "we have developed a coupled - channel model with @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 channels to predict the @xmath4 production on the nucleon .",
    "the @xmath4-@xmath5 interaction potential @xmath289 is taken from the calculations using the effective field theory method and lattice qcd .",
    "the @xmath290 transition potentials @xmath291 and @xmath292 are calculated from one-@xmath26-exchange and one-@xmath25-exchange mechanisms with the parameters determined by the decay width of @xmath27 and the previously determined @xmath293 and @xmath294 coupling constants .",
    "the interactions @xmath257 with @xmath295 are treated as phenomenological complex potentials with their parameters constrained by the fits to the data of total cross sections of the @xmath0 reactions , @xmath148 , @xmath31 , and @xmath296 .",
    "the calculated meson - baryon amplitudes are then used to predict the cross sections of @xmath297 and @xmath298 reactions .",
    "the calculations on the deuteron target involve the contributions from the impulse term and the final @xmath7 and @xmath2 scattering .",
    "we have identified the kinematic region where the @xmath4-@xmath5 potentials can be distinguished in @xmath299 , @xmath9 and @xmath300 reactions .",
    "predictions of the dependence of the cross sections of these reactions on the @xmath4-@xmath5 potentials are presented .",
    "our results shown in figs.[fg : pin - jpsin ] , [ fg : phodjn ] , and [ fg : pinpid ] can be used to facilitate the experimental determinations of @xmath4-@xmath5 interactions .    within the vector meson dominance model ,",
    "we have also applied the constructed coupled - channel model to predict the @xmath11 cross sections .",
    "our results near the @xmath4 production threshold , as shown in fig.[fg : phpphd ] , are very different from what can be calculated from the conventional pomeron - exchange model which is mainly constrained by the @xmath301 cross section at high energies",
    ". it will be interesting to distinguish these two models in the forthcoming experiment at jefferson laboratory@xcite .",
