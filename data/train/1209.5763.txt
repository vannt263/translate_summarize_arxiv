    "the growing family of multinary copper chalcogenides has been of great interest for solar photovoltaic applications .",

    "recently the @xmath0-type semiconductor cu@xmath1pse@xmath2  has been established@xcite to have a direct bandgap of @xmath12 ev , with a calculated absorption @xmath13 @xmath14 for wavelengths less than @xmath15 nm .",
    "this bandgap lies in the optimal range for photovoltaic power output and warrants further investigation of the material .",
    "in addition to optical absorption , essential considerations for photovoltaic applications include ease of synthesis , conductivity , amenability to doping , and trap - assisted charge recombination .",
    "these quantities are largely controlled by the thermodynamic stability of the material with respect to competing phases and point defects .",
    "materials which allow bipolar doping ( both @xmath7-type and @xmath0-type behavior are achievable through doping ) are of special interest because @xmath0-@xmath7 homojunction capability may reduce the number of heterojunctions needed in a solar cell design .",
    "bipolar doping occurs under typical synthesis techniques only when all intrinsic defects have charge transition energies and formation energies large enough so that extrinsic ( dopant ) charged defect states are energetically favorable for a sizable range of fermi energies , extending well above and below the center of the bandgap .",
    "computational defect analysis using relatively inexpensive methods can often determine with good confidence whether bipolar doping is possible for synthesis methods near thermal equilibrium .",
    "here we perform a point defect analysis of cu@xmath1pse@xmath2  combining the + @xmath3 hubbard term for total energy calculations with the correction methods described recently by lany and zunger@xcite .",
    "several potential substitutional donor defects are also considered .",
    "furthermore we examine bulk properties including the partial density of states ( dos ) , the dielectric tensor , and the highly asymmetric effective mass tensor .",
    "we compare our results to recent experiments@xcite and to a more standard procedure using the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) for defect supercell calculations followed by a post - calculation valence band correction .",
    "we also compare our methods with the alternative electrostatic image correction procedure described by freysoldt _",
    "et al_.@xcite .",
    "defect formation energies are most often calculated using density functional theory ( dft ) within the local density approximation ( lda ) or within the gga .",
    "however , recent statistical studies@xcite on the accuracy of heat of formation calculations indicate that using gga with an additional hubbard @xmath3 term for the occupation of transition metal @xmath4 orbitals , the so - called gga+@xmath3 method , will be more accurate than using standard gga or lda .",

    "the @xmath3 value is held constant for each type of transition metal atom throughout the analysis , including calculations of the energies of the transition metal elements themselves .",

    "this value of @xmath3 for has been chosen in previous work ( c.f .",
    "ref .  ) to yield agreement with the experimental band structure below the valence band maximum ( vbm)@xcite , thus eliminating or significantly reducing the need for post - calculation corrections to the vbm of cu@xmath1pse@xmath2.@xcite calculations use a plane wave cutoff energy of and a set of comparison calculations using cutoff energy resulted in very small corrections of order .",
