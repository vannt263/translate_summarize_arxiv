    "anthracnose is a phytopathology which attacks several commercial tropical crops such as coffee .",
    "the anthracnose of coffee is known under the name coffee berry disease ( cbd ) and its pathogen is the _ colletotrichum _ _ kahawae _ , an ascomycete fungus .",
    "the literature on anthracnose pathosystem is extensive @xcite .",
    "there have been several attempts to model the spread of cbd and to identify efficient control strategies @xcite .",
    "possible control methods include genetic methods @xcite , biological control @xcite , chemical control @xcite and cultivational practices @xcite .",
    "chemical methods appear to be the most effective , but present ecological risks .",
    "moreover , inadequate application of chemical treatments can induce resistance in the pathogen @xcite .",
    "a dynamical spatial model of anthracnose infection that includes chemical control was proposed and analysed in @xcite ; this paper also showed how to optimize the use of the chemical control with respect to a given cost functional .",
    "the disease dynamics were represented by an inhibition rate that satisfies a reaction - diffusion partial differential equation with coefficients that depend on space and time .",
    "the present paper adds to the above model the possibility of a pulse control strategy that represents cultivational practices such as pruning old , infected twigs and removing mummified fruits .",
    "such actions are commonly performed at discrete times at regular intervals .",
    "an additional enhancement to the model results from our relaxing the regularity conditions on the model parameters that were imposed in @xcite .",
    "the enhanced model is able to take into account the fact that in realistic situations the application of antifungal compounds is typically not continuous in time ( although the action of these compounds once applied is continuous ) .",
    "the remainder of the paper has the following structure . in section [ system ] , we present the system model and explain the significance of the model parameters . in section [ wellposedness ]",
    "we establish the well - posedness of the model @xmath1 ( under certain conditions ) and its spatially - averaged version .",
    "section [ sectioncov ] proves existence of an optimal control strategy based only on the pulse strategy , for both the spatially - averaged model and the general model .",
    "some properties of the optimal control strategy are proven , and an algorithm for finding the optimal pulse strategy is given , which applies both spatially - averaged and general models .",
    "section [ sectioncouv]proves the existence of an optimal control strategy using simultaneously pulse and continuous strategies , for both the spatially - averaged and the general model .",
    "some extremal properties of these strategies are also established . in section  [ sectionmodsim ]",
    "we present system simulations of both the spatially - averaged and general models that demonstrate properties of the optimal pulse - only control .",
    "finally , in section [ discussion ] we summarize our conclusions .",

    "it is appropriate to model @xmath10 as an almost - periodic function , taking into account yearly seasonal changes .",
    "the term @xmath24 accounts for the ( possibly anisotropic ) diffusive spatial spreading of inhibition rate in the open domain @xmath25 , where the matrix @xmath26 contains the space- and time - dependent diffusion coefficients .",

    "@xmath28 is the inhibition rate corresponding to epidermis penetration .",
    "once the epidermis has been penetrated , the inhibition rate can not fall below this value , even under maximum control effort .    in the current paper , we propose the following modified model , that includes the possibility of impulsive control : @xmath29 where @xmath10 , @xmath30 , @xmath6 , @xmath26 , @xmath14 , @xmath18 , and @xmath20 are as above ( except that @xmath10 and @xmath26 no longer depend on @xmath2 ) and    @xmath31 is an increasing sequence of nonnegative reals such that @xmath32 ;    @xmath33 ;    @xmath34 , where @xmath35 denotes the volume @xmath36 ;    @xmath37 is a threshold value such that the inhibition rate is not measurable under it and is observable for values greater than @xmath38 ;    @xmath39 is a @xmath40$]-valued function defined on @xmath41 .    in @xmath42 , the inhibition rate @xmath2",

    "<S> in this paper we propose and study a spatial diffusion model for the control of anthracnose disease in a bounded domain . </S>",
    "<S> the model is a generalization of the one previously developed in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we use the model to simulate two different types of control strategies against anthracnose disease . </S>",
    "<S> strategies that employ chemical fungicides are modeled using a continuous control function ; while strategies that rely on cultivational practices ( such as pruning and removal of mummified fruits ) are modeled with a control function which is discrete in time ( though not in space ) . under weak smoothness conditions on parameters we demonstrate the well - posedness of the model by verifying existence and uniqueness of the solution for given initial conditions . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that the set @xmath0   $ ] is positively invariant . we first study control by pulse strategy only , then analyze the simultaneous use of continuous and pulse strategies . in each case </S>",
    "<S> we specify a cost functional to be minimized , and we demonstrate the existence of optimal control strategies that can be evaluated numerically using the gradient method presented in @xcite . we discuss the results of numerical simulations both for a spatially - averaged version of the model and for the full model .    </S>",
