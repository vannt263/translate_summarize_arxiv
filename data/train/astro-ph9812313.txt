    "an example is a scalar field @xmath0 slowly rolling down its potential @xmath1.@xcite for a general scalar field , the pressure is @xmath2 , and the energy density is @xmath3 . for a slowly rolling scalar field , the pressure can be negative if the kinetic energy is less than the potential energy . for quintessence",
    ", the equation - of - state , defined as @xmath4 , lies between 0 and @xmath5 . depending on @xmath1 ,",
    "@xmath6 may be constant , slowly - varying , rapidly varying or oscillatory.@xcite    a key problem with the quintessence proposal is explaining why @xmath7 and the matter energy density should be comparable today .",
    "there are two aspects to this problem .",
    "first of all , throughout the history of the universe , the two densities decrease at different rates , so it appears that the conditions in the early universe have to be set very carefully in order for the energy densities to be comparable today .",
    "we refer to this issue of initial conditions as the  coincidence problem.\"@xcite this is a generalization of the flatness problem described by dicke and peebles in 1979;@xcite the very same issue arises with a cosmological constant as well . a second aspect , which we call the  fine - tuning problem , \"",
    "is that the value of the quintessence energy density ( or vacuum energy or curvature ) is very tiny compared to typical particle physics scales .",
    "the fine - tuning condition is forced by direct measurements ; however , the initial conditions or coincidence problem depends on the theoretical candidate for the missing energy .",
    "recently , we introduced a form of quintessence called  tracker fields \" which avoids the coincidence problem.@xcite tracker fields have an equation - of - motion with attractor - like solutions in which a very wide range of initial conditions rapidly converge to a common , cosmic evolutionary track .",
    "the initial value of @xmath7 can vary by nearly 100 orders of magnitude without altering the cosmic history .",
    "the acceptable initial conditions include the natural possibility of equipartition after inflation  nearly equal energy density in @xmath0 as in the other 100 - 1000 degrees of freedom ( _ e.g. _ , @xmath8 ) .",
    "furthermore , the resulting cosmology has desirable properties .",
    "the equation - of - state @xmath6 varies according to the background equation - of - state @xmath9 . when the universe is radiation - dominated ( @xmath10 ) , then @xmath6 is less than or equal to 1/3 and @xmath7 decreases less rapidly than the radiation density . when the universe is matter - dominated ( @xmath11 ) , then @xmath6 is less than zero and @xmath7 decreases less rapidly than the matter density",
    ". eventually , @xmath7 surpasses the matter density and becomes the dominant component . at this point",
    ", @xmath0 slows to a crawl and @xmath12 as @xmath13 and the universe is driven into an accelerating phase .",
    "these properties seem to match current observations well.@xcite    in some cases , @xmath6 is very nearly equal to @xmath9 during the radiation- and matter - dominated epochs , and some authors have focused on the fact that the @xmath0 energy density decreases at nearly the same rate as the background energy density.@xcite however , our focus is on the fact that the cosmology is independent of initial conditions , which includes but does not require @xmath14 during the matter- and radiation - dominated epochs .",
    "hence , our use of the term  tracker \" is meant to refer to solutions joining a common evolutionary track , as opposed to tracking closely the background energy density .",
    "it is also an interesting point that some tracker solutions do not require small mass parameters to obtain a small energy density today;@xcite whether this is a satisfactory solution to the fine tuning problem is debatable , though .",
    "we do not explore this issue in this paper .",
    "the tracker solution differs from a classical dynamics attractor because it is time - dependent : during tracking , @xmath15 increases steadily .",
    "this contrasts with the solutions based on exponential potentials recently discussed by ferreira and joyce@xcite in which @xmath15 is constant during the matter dominated epoch . for this kind of solution , @xmath15 is constrained to be small ( @xmath16 ) at the beginning of matter domination in order that large - scale structure be formed , but then it can not change thereafter .",
    "hence , it remains a small , subdominant component .",
    "( see , however , discussion of undershoot and overshoot solutions later in this paper for a possible way around this constraint . )",
    "the tracker solution is more desirable , though , because it enables the @xmath0-energy to eventually overtake the matter density and induce a period of accelerated expansion , which produces a cosmology more consistent with measurements of the matter density , large scale structure , and supernovae observations.@xcite    an important consequence of the tracker solutions is the prediction of a relation between @xmath6 and @xmath15 today.@xcite because tracker solutions are insensitive to initial conditions , both @xmath6 and @xmath15 only depend on @xmath1 .",
    "hence , for any given @xmath1 , once @xmath15 is measured , @xmath6 is determined . in general , the closer that @xmath15 is to unity , the closer @xmath6 is to @xmath5 .",
    "however , since @xmath17 today , there is a sufficient gap between @xmath15 and unity that @xmath6 can not be so close to @xmath5 .",
    "we find that @xmath18 for practical models .",
    "this @xmath6-@xmath15 relation , which makes the tracker field proposal distinguishable from the cosmological constant , will be explored further in this paper .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to expand on our introductory article on tracker fields and the coincidence problem . in particular , we want to go beyond the specific examples of tracker potentials studied before and address in a general way the following questions ( the relevant section is shown in parentheses ) :    * what is a tracker solution ? ( ii.b ) * what potentials @xmath1 have tracker solutions and which do not ?",

    "( iv ) * why is the @xmath0-field first beginning to dominate at this late stage of the universe rather than at some early stage ?",
    "we shall consider a scalar field with present equation - of - state @xmath19 in a flat cosmological background ( consistent with inflation ) .",
    "the ratio of the energy density to the critical density today is @xmath15 for the @xmath0-field and @xmath20 for the baryonic and dark matter density where @xmath21 .",

    "the @xmath32 sign depends on whether @xmath33 or @xmath34 , respectively .",

    "an important function is @xmath39 , whose properties determine whether tracking solutions exist . taking the derivative of the equation - of - motion with respect to @xmath0 and combining with the equation - of - motion itself",

    "we shall use the term  converging \" to refer to the attractor - like behavior in which solutions to the equation - of - motion are drawn towards a common solution , @xmath43 .",
    "we shall argue that converging solutions with @xmath44 solve the coincidence problem .",
    "a tracker solution is one which undergoes long periods of converging .",
    "the converging period should be long enough so that any residue of initial condition is washed away and the solution today only depends on parameters in the potential .",
    "for a potential @xmath45 ( where @xmath46 is a dimensionless function of @xmath47 ) , there is a family of tracker solutions parameterized by @xmath48 .",
    "the value of @xmath48 is determined by the measured value of @xmath20 today ( assuming a flat universe ) .",
    "we make the ( fine ) distinction between  tracking \" and  converging \" because tracker solutions typically go through some periods when solutions are not approaching one another .",
    "in particular , during transitions in the background equation - of - state , such as the transition from radiation- to matter - domination , there are brief intervals during which @xmath6 changes rapidly and general solutions are not drawn towards the tracker solution ; fortunately , these transitory periods are too short to spoil the advantages of tracking solutions .    to be complete in classifying the possibilities , one should also consider potentials in which @xmath0 first passes through a regime where solutions converge and then ends up in a regime where they do not .",
    "we refer to these as  hybrid models \" below . by the time the second regime is reached ,",
    "sufficient convergence of solutions may have already occurred to insure that the desired range of initial conditions track along a common solution in the second regime .",
    "in the following section , we prove the key properties of tracker solutions .",
    "each subsection leads with a summary statement of the result for those who wish to skip the detailed mathematical arguments .",
    "our central theorem is that tracking behavior with @xmath49 occurs for any potential in which @xmath50 and is nearly constant ( @xmath51 ) over the range of plausible initial @xmath0 . for the cases of interest",
    ", the range extends to @xmath1 equal to the initial background energy density @xmath52 down to @xmath1 equal to the background density at matter - radiation equality , a span of over 100 orders of magnitude .",
    "although @xmath49 is what is desired for most practical applications , we also show that tracking behavior with @xmath53 is possible provided @xmath54 and nearly constant .",
    "tracking does not occur for @xmath55 .",
    "hence , testing for the existence of tracking solutions reduces to a simple condition on @xmath1 without having to solve the equation - of - motion directly . in particular , the condition that @xmath56",
    "can be evaluated either by testing @xmath57 over range of @xmath0 corresponding to the allowed initial conditions ; the middle expression is easily computed knowing @xmath1 only without having to solve an equation - of - motion .",
    "( here we have used the tracker condition @xmath58 which applies for the tracker solution . )",
    "an equivalent condition is that that @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the difference between the maximum and minimum values of @xmath61 over the same range of @xmath0 .",
    "the condition @xmath62 is equivalent to the constraint that @xmath63 be decreasing as @xmath64 decreases .",
    "these conditions encompass an extremely broad range of potentials , including inverse power - law potentials ( @xmath65 for @xmath66 ) and combinations of inverse power - law terms ( _ e.g. _ , @xmath67 ) . some potentials of this form",
    "are suggested by particle physics models with dynamical symmetry breaking or nonperturbative effects.@xcite    if @xmath68 , converging behavior does not occur for potentials in which @xmath63 strictly increases as @xmath64 decreases ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "this category includes quadratic potentials and most examples of quintessence models in the literature . instead of converging behavior ,",
    "these models require specially tuned initial conditions to obtain an acceptable value of @xmath15 today , as discussed in section iii.b .    for @xmath70 ,",
    "converging behavior does occur if @xmath71 is strictly increasing as @xmath64 decreases ( @xmath69 ) ; however , as we explain in section iii.f , potentials with @xmath72 do not produce viable cosmological models : if @xmath73 and @xmath74 today ( as suggested by current observation ) then @xmath15 must exceed @xmath20 in the past and there is no period of matter - domination or structure formation .",
    "hybrid potentials are possible in which converging behavior only occurs for a finite period during the early universe , provided that the time is sufficiently long to bring together solutions whose initial conditions span the range of practical interest .",
    "for example , one can construct potentials in which @xmath63 decreases at first as @xmath0 rolls downhill , and then @xmath63 begins to increase .",
    "another possibility is that @xmath63 increases at first and @xmath73 , as discussed in the previous paragraph .",
    "we pointed out that this condition allows convergence , but can not be maintained up to the present for practical reasons of structure formation .",
    "however , the condition could be maintained for a long , finite period in the early universe so long as it is terminated before matter - domination .      for potentials in which @xmath63 increases as @xmath64 decreases ( @xmath69 ) , the lhs of the the equation - of - motion eq .",
    "( [ teq ] ) is increasing . if @xmath49 , @xmath75 on the rhs is decreasing as @xmath0 rolls downhill .",
    "hence , the tracker condition , @xmath76 , can not be maintained and @xmath6 can not be maintained at a nearly constant value ( different from @xmath5 ) for any extended period .    in particular ,",
    "extrapolating backwards in time , @xmath63 is strictly decreasing and @xmath75 is strictly increasing . the only way to satisfy the equation - of - motion , eq .",
    "( [ teq ] ) , is to have @xmath6 approach @xmath5 .",
    "but , this corresponds to the @xmath0-field freezing at some value @xmath77 after only a few hubble times .",
    "the energy density of the frozen field is only slightly higher than the current energy density .",
    "consequently , to obtain this cosmological solution , one has to have special initial conditions in the early universe ( after inflation , say ) that set @xmath0 precisely to @xmath78 and the @xmath0-energy density to @xmath79 , a value nearly 100 orders of magnitude smaller than the background energy density .",
    "it is precisely this tuning of initial conditions ( the coincidence problem ) which we seek to avoid .",
    "we note that many quintessence models ( @xmath80 ) discussed in the literature fall into this non - tracking class and require extraordinary tuning of initial conditions .",
    "simple examples include the harmonic potential , @xmath81 , and the sinusoidal potential , @xmath82 $ ] . in these models ,",
    "the initial value of @xmath0 must be set to a specific value initially in order to obtain the measured value of @xmath15 today .",
    "our claim is that solutions converge to a tracker solution if : ( a ) @xmath83 is nearly constant ; and ( b ) @xmath62 for @xmath84 or @xmath69 for @xmath85 .",
    "we have explained in the previous section why @xmath61 must be greater than unity if @xmath84 or else the tracking condition , @xmath86 , can not be maintained .",
    "a similar argument requires @xmath87 if @xmath85 .",
    "but , as we shall see , we also need that @xmath61 be nearly constant in order to have converging behavior .    if @xmath61 is nearly constant , then the tracker equation , eq .",
    "( [ gamma ] ) , implies that there is a solution in which @xmath6 is nearly constant and @xmath88 and its time - derivatives are negligible . in this case",
    ", we have that the equation - of - state for the @xmath0-field is nearly constant : @xmath89 if @xmath90 , the value of @xmath6 must be less than @xmath9 to satisfy the tracker equation , which means that the @xmath0-energy red shifts more slowly than the background energy . for inverse power - law potentials",
    "@xmath91 , @xmath92 , and the relation we have derived matches the relation in our first paper.@xcite for @xmath93 , @xmath94 , which satisfies our condition for @xmath95 . for @xmath96 , the same relation says that the value of @xmath97 must be greater than @xmath9 ; but we also require that @xmath98 in order to satisfy the criterion , @xmath99 , necessary to have converging solutions ( see section iii.f ) .    if @xmath61 varies significantly with @xmath0 , then one can find a wide and continuous distribution of @xmath0 , @xmath15 , and @xmath6 which satisfies the tracker equation .",
    "hence , there is no single solution to which solutions converge .    in sum",
    ", we have succeeded in expressing our conditions for tracking solutions in terms of @xmath61 , which depends entirely on the functional form of @xmath64 .",

    "the case of interest for quintessence is @xmath49 , in which case the condition for a tracker solution is @xmath62 and nearly constant .",

    "this subsection explains in rough detail how solutions converge to the tracker solution for any initial @xmath102 that lies between the initial background energy density , @xmath103 , and the current critical density , @xmath104 .",
    "this range stretches nearly 100 orders of magnitude .",
    "in particular , we explain how the convergence to the tracker solution is different if initially @xmath105 versus @xmath106 . for simplicity ,",

    "the borderline case corresponds to @xmath168 , which has been studied by several authors.@xcite for this case , the tracker equation for @xmath169 demands that @xmath170 and , therefore , @xmath15 is constant .",
    "hence , for this case , the tracker solution corresponds to maintaining a constant ratio of quintessence to background energy density .",
    "the only deviation occurs during the transition from radiation- to matter - domination when @xmath158 becomes non - negligible , but this is a small effect .    because @xmath15 is constant throughout the matter - dominated epoch",

    "@xmath15 must be small ( @xmath171 ) at the onset of matter - domination in order not to disrupt structure formation .",

    "consequently , the models require @xmath172 , inconsistent with a number of determinations of mass@xcite , and the universe never enters a period of accelerated expansion , inconsistent with recent measurements of the luminosity - red shift relation for type ia supernovae.@xcite ( the overshoot scenario may lift the @xmath172 constraint but , as discussed in section d , introduces fine tuning which defeats the whole purpose of the scenario . )",
    "hybrid models have the property that solutions converge to a tracker solution at the early phase of evolution but cease to converge after a certain point due to a change in the shape of the potential as @xmath0 rolls downhill .",
    "one can imagine a sufficiently long convergence regime that all or most plausible initial conditions have collapsed to a common tracker solution before the second regime begins .",
    "effectively , this has the desired feature that a wide range of initial conditions lead to the same final condition .",
    "the models may be somewhat artificial in that the current cosmology is very sensitive to where the transition occurs .",
    "for example , consider the case where @xmath49 but @xmath61 undergoes a transition from @xmath90 ( converging ) to @xmath173 . recall that @xmath69 corresponds to @xmath63 increasing as @xmath64 decreases .",
    "we have shown that , extrapolating backwards only a small interval in time , the field @xmath0 must have been frozen at a value not so different from the current value ( assuming the field is rolling today and @xmath80 ) . in this kind of hybrid model , the transition to @xmath69 must be set so that the transition occurs so that @xmath0 is near the frozen value , which requires delicate tuning of parameters in the potential .",
    "a different example is where @xmath174 and @xmath72 during the early stages of the universe .",
    "we have argued that these conditions produce converging behavior but , if the conditions continue to the present , there is no period of matter - domination or structure formation ( see section iii.f ) .",
    "however , one can imagine hybrid models in which these conditions @xmath175<\\gamma < 1 $ ] and @xmath160 are satisfied for some period early in the history of the universe , providing a finite period of converging behavior .",
    "later , as @xmath0 moves down the potential , @xmath64 changes form so that @xmath49 .",
    "viable cosmological models of this type can be constructed in which @xmath15 does not dominate the universe during the matter - dominated epoch until near the present time .",
    "we have discovered a wide class of potentials that exhibit tracking behavior .",
    "this guarantees that a wide range of initial conditions converge to a common tracking solution , but the convergence may take longer than the age of the universe in some cases .",
    "in particular , if one assume equipartition after inflation , say , and the initial @xmath64 is too far above the tracker solution , then @xmath0 falls precipitously , overshoots the tracker solution , and freezes at some @xmath176 .",
    "for some potentials satisfying the condition @xmath177 , @xmath122 may be so large that the field does not begin to roll and track by the present epoch .",
    "if @xmath0 just started to roll by the present epoch , then it would behave exactly as a cosmological constant until now , and so the model is trivially equivalent to a @xmath178 model . as a practical consideration , we demand that a field starting from equipartition initial conditions should start rolling by matter - domination , say , so that the model is non - trivial .",
    "this imposes a mild added constraint on potentials , @xmath1 . for this purpose ,",
    "rough estimates suffice .",

    "for example , consider the highly contrived potential @xmath205 , in which we have intentionally chosen exponents differing by six orders of magnitude in order to obtain a small @xmath6 today .",
    "the second term in the potential dominates before equality and insures that the field is rolling by that point in time .",

    "hence , in figure  7 , the boundary can relax somewhat downward ( dashed line ) but it is difficult to obtain @xmath212 or @xmath213 . because @xmath6 is evolving at recent times , the value obtained from measurements at moderate to deep red shift will differ from the current value shown in figure 6 . for tracker potentials , the effect of integrating back in time over",
