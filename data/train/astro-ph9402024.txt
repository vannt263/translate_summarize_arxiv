    "the rapid development of both observations and theory has turned the search for the origin of cosmic structure into one of the most exciting fields of scientific research .",
    "succesful observations performed during the past few years have imposed severe constraints on theories of structure formation . in spite of these constraints",
    "one important question remains open : _",
    "what is the origin of primordial fluctuations that gave rise to structure in the universe ? _",
    "two classes of theories attempting to answer this question have emerged during the past ten years and have managed to survive through the observational constraints with only minor adjustments .    according to the first class , primordial fluctuations are produced by quantum fluctuations of a linearly coupled scalar field during a period of inflation ( hawking 1982 ; starobinsky 1982 ; guth & pi 1982 ; bardeen , steinhardt & turner 1983 ) .",
    "these fluctuations are subsequently expected to become classical and provide the progenitors of structure in the universe . because of the extremely small linear coupling of the scalar field , needed to preserve the observed large scale homogeneity , the inflationary perturbations are expected by the central limit theorem , to obey gaussian statistics .",
    "this is not the case for the second class of theories .    according to the second class of theories ( kibble 1976 ; vilenkin 1981 ; vilenkin 1985 ; turok 1989 ; brandenberger 1992 ) , primordial perturbations are provided by _",
    "seeds _ of trapped energy density produced during symmetry breaking phase transitions in the early universe .",
    "such symmetry breaking is predicted by grand unified theories ( gut s ) to occur at early times as the universe cools and expands .",
    "the geometry of the produced seeds , known as _ topological defects _ is determined by the topology of the vaccuum manifold of the physically realized gut .",
    "thus the defects may be pointlike ( monopoles ) , linelike ( cosmic strings ) , planar ( domain walls ) or collapsing pointlike ( textures ) .",
    "the cosmic string theory ( vilenkin 1981 ) for structure formation is the oldest and ( together with textures ( turok 1989 ) ) best studied theory of the topological defect class . by fixing its single free parameter @xmath3 (",
    "@xmath6 is the _ effective _ mass per unit length of the wiggly string and @xmath7 is newtons constant ) to a value consistent with microphysical requirements coming from gut s , the theory may automatically account for large scale filaments and sheets ( vachaspati 1986 ; stebbins _ et .",

    "it can also provide large scale peculiar velocities ( vachaspati t. 1992a ; perivolaropoulos & vachaspati 1993 ) and is consistent with the amplitude , spectral index ( bouchet , bennett & stebbins 1988 ; bennett , stebbins & bouchet 1992 ; perivolaropoulos 1993a ; hindmarsh 1993 ) and the statistics ( gott _ et .",

    "the cmb observations provide a valuable direct probe for identifying signatures of cosmic strings .",
    "there are three main mechanisms by which strings can produce cmb temperature fluctuations .",
    "the first mechanism has been well studied both analytically ( brandenberger & turok 1986 ; stebbins 1988 ; veeraraghavan & stebbins 1990 ; perivolaropoulos 1993a ; perivolaropoulos 1993b ; moessner _ et .",
    "al . _ 1993 ) and using numerical simulations ( bouchet _ et.al . _ 1988 ; bennett _ et .",
    "al . _ 1992 ) and is known as the _ kaiser - stebbins effect _",
    "( kaiser & stebbins 1984 ; gott 1985 ) . according to this effect , moving long strings present between the time of recombination @xmath10 and the present time @xmath11 ,",
    "produce step - like temperature discontinuities between photons that reach the observer through opposite sides of the string .",
    "these discontinuities are due to the peculiar nature of the spacetime around a long string which even though is _ locally _ flat , _ globally _ has the geometry of a cone with deficit angle @xmath12 .",
    "the magnitude of the discontinuity is proportional to the deficit angle , to the string velocity @xmath13 and depends on the relative orientation between the unit vector along the string @xmath14 and the unit photon wave - vector @xmath15 .",
    "it is given by ( stebbins 1988 ) @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the relativistic lorentz factor and the sign changes when the string is crossed . the angular scale over which this discontinuity persists",
    "is given by the radius of curvature of the string @xmath18 ( the parameter @xmath19 measures the string curvature radius as a fraction of the horizon angular scale @xmath20 ) .",
    "the second mechanism is based on the doppler effect .",
    "moving long strings present on or before the last scattering surface produce , due to their deficit angle , velocity fields directed towards the surface swept by the string .",
    "these perturbations affect both the plasma and the dark matter .",
    "the growth of velocity perturbations produced before recombination on the plasma , is prevented by pressure and photon drag .",
    "however , velocity fields produced on the plasma last scatterers of photons by moving long strings _ at _ the time of recombination _ are _ important because they produce temperature fluctuations on the scattered photons via the _ doppler effect_. the magnitude of these fluctuations can be obtained from the velocity perturbations ( vachaspati & vilenkin 1991 ; vachaspati 1992a ) induced by a long string as @xmath21 where @xmath22 and t is the tension of the wiggly long string estimated by simulations to be @xmath23 .",
    "the scale over which these fluctuations persist is the radius of curvature of long strings at @xmath10 ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "the third mechanism is based on potential fluctuations on the last scattering surface produced by both loops and long string wakes .",
    "wakes are planar density enhancements induced by the growing velocity perturbations of long strings on dark matter ( stebbins _ et .",
    "_ 1987 ; perivolaropoulos _ et . al .",
    "these perturbations begin to grow at about the time of equal matter and radiation @xmath25 ( assuming cold dark matter ( cdm ) ) . a wake produced by a long string at time",
    "@xmath26 has angular dimensions @xmath27 and a surface density at time t given by ( perivolaropoulos _ et .",
    "1990 ) @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the mean dark matter density at @xmath26 .",
    "the temperature perturbation due to the potential @xmath30 ( sachs & wolfe 1967 ; stebbins 1993 ) produced by the wakes present on the last scattering surface is @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the _ perpendicular _ distance to the wake as a function of the distance @xmath33 from the wake on the last scattering surface and @xmath34 is the angle between the photon wave - vector and the wake surface . as in the previous cases ,",
    "the _ angular _ distance from the wake over which this perturbation persists is approximatelly @xmath35 .",
    "loops present on the last scattering surface with their accreted dark matter are also expected to contribute to the potential fluctuations .",
    "it will be seen however that their contribution is minimal due to their very small size indicated by numerical simulations . according to simulations ( bennett & bouchet 1988 ) loops",
    "are produced with relativistic velocities ( which quickly erase any initial correlations ) and typical size @xmath36 ( @xmath37 is the hubble scale at time @xmath38 ) , which for @xmath39 corresponds to an angular scale of about 0.3 arcsec ( even though the largest loops can be about ten times larger ( bouchet 1988 ) ) .",
    "this scale is too small for any observable effects in present experiments . for completeness",
    "however we will include loops in our analysis in order to explicitly demonstrate that they are unimportant compared to other types of perturbations .",
    "the temperature fluctuations induced by a loop of radius @xmath40 , due to the disturbance of the last scattering surface potential at a distance @xmath33 from the center of the loop may be approximated by @xmath41 where @xmath42 is a parameter determining the length of string in a loop of radius @xmath40 ( typically @xmath43 ) . the time dependent growth factor takes into account the accretion of cdm ( as in the case of wakes ) .",
    "the above three mechanisms have specified four distinct types of seed functions that need to be superimposed ( in different ways ) in order to construct the cmb spectrum of string induced temperature fluctuations .",
    "the next step is to give an expression of the spectrum in terms of these seed functions . for simplicity we will focus on perturbations along a great circle on the sky . by isotropy ,",
    "our results for the correlation function and the spectrum @xmath44 are valid for _ any _ such circle and the extension of our results to _ patches _ will be shown to be straightforward .",
    "consider a seed function @xmath45 of size proportional to @xmath46 , superimposed at random positions @xmath47 and with variable amplitude @xmath48 , @xmath49 times on a circle ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "the resulting function is @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the fourier transform of @xmath53 .",
    "the fourier transform of @xmath54 is @xmath55 the probability distribution of the phases of this pattern has been studied previously ( perivolaropoulos 1993c ) . here",
    "we focus on the power spectrum of the resulting pattern which is @xmath56 where @xmath57 denotes ensemble average .    in a cosmological setup",
    "the role of seeds is played by topological defects which obey a ` scaling solution ' and therefore their size is a fixed fraction of the horizon at any given time . as the comoving horizon expands by a factor @xmath58 , the size ( total number ) of superimposed seeds on the great circle will also increase ( decrease ) by the same factor .",
    "therefore , after @xmath59 expansion steps the resulting spectrum will be @xmath60 this is a general result that can be easily applied to any particular type of seed function @xmath61 provided the following quantities are specified    1 .   _",
    "the number of seeds n at the first expansion step_. for a scaling defect with m seeds per horizon scale we have @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the angular size of the horizon at the first expansion step . for @xmath64 , ( _ i.e. _ h=1/2 ) and @xmath65 we have @xmath66 and @xmath67 since @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "the maximum and minimum size of superimposed seeds _ + @xmath70 . for initial and final times of superposition @xmath71 ( to be used for the kaiser - stebbins effect )",
    "we have @xmath72 while for @xmath73 ( to be used for the scales of potential perturbations ) we have @xmath74 the number of expansion steps is obtained simply as @xmath75 3 .",
    "_ the comoving horizon expansion factor @xmath58_. taking each expansion step when the _ physical _ horizon scales by @xmath76 in size leads to @xmath77 .",
    "increasing @xmath58 tends to increase each term in the sum ( 12 ) but this effect is compensated by the decrease in @xmath59 due to ( 15 ) .",
    "thus for reasonable values of @xmath76 ( @xmath78 ) our results are rather insensitive to the value of @xmath58 .",
    "in what follows we use @xmath79 which implies @xmath80 .",
    "4 .   _ the magnitude of @xmath48 and the form @xmath53 _ of the seed functions given by equations ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) , ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) .",
    "we are now in position to determine the contribution to the power spectrum for each one of the three mechanisms by which strings can produce temperature fluctuations on the cmb .    1 .",
    "_ kaiser - stebbins effect : _ it is easy to see from ( 1 ) that in this case @xmath81 while @xmath82 where @xmath83 .",

    "thus , substituting in ( 12 ) we obtain @xmath90 where @xmath91 .",
    "potential perturbations : _ 1 .",
    "_ wakes : _ we are interested in all the wakes present on the last scattering surface thus causing potential perturbations on it .",
    "those wakes were formed at time @xmath26 , with @xmath92 ( since perturbations start to grow at @xmath25 ) .",
    "all these wakes must be taken into account with their growth factors . in the case of wakes ,",
    "the sum of equation ( 12 ) will run not on the epoch that the photon was affected ( as was the case for the kaiser - stebbins component of the spectrum ) but on the growth factor and the size of the wake present on the last scattering surface . in this case",
    ", we have @xmath73 which implies @xmath93 and @xmath94 . using ( 5 ) and following the same steps as for the kaiser - stebbins effect",
    "we obtain @xmath95 where @xmath96 2 .",
    "_ loops : _ using ( 6 ) , ( 7 ) and ( 12 ) with @xmath73 we obtain @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the cubic root of the number of loops per horizon scale ( i.e. the number of loops that intersect a horizon size arc on the sky ) and @xmath99 is typical size of loops as a fraction of the horizon scale .",
    "the exact values of the parameters @xmath42 , @xmath100 and @xmath98 are unimportant for our calculations , since it will be seen that for all values of parameters which are consistent with string simulations , the term @xmath101 is orders of magnitude smaller than the other terms contributing to the power spectrum for @xmath102 ( @xmath103 arcmin ) . for definiteness we will use @xmath104 , @xmath105 and @xmath106 ( values which tend to overestimate the contribution of loops ) . even with these values",
    "it will be seen that loops are unimportant .",
    "doppler effect : _ since velocity perturbations on the plasma do not grow before recombination we will only consider the contribution of strings present at the time of recombination . using ( 2 ) and ( 12 ) with @xmath107 we obtain @xmath108    the total spectrum is therefore given by @xmath109",
    "before being able to make predictions about ongoing cmb experiments we must determine the only free parameter @xmath3 as well as the parameters @xmath110 , @xmath111 and @xmath19 .",
    "string simulations ( bennett & bouchet 1988 ; allen & shellard 1990 ) indicate that @xmath112 while @xmath113 implying @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "we will verify these values by directly fitting our spectrum with partial cmb spectra obtained by simulations on large angular scales .",
    "bouchet , bennett and stebbins ( hereafter bbs ) have used numerical simulations to calculate the term @xmath116 for a single expansion step .",
    "their result for the total power on angular scales smaller than @xmath117 with @xmath118 , @xmath119 is @xmath120 our analysis , focusing on a line across the sky rather than a patch predicts @xmath121 in figure 1 we show @xmath122 for @xmath123 and @xmath124 ( continous line ) superimposed on @xmath125 ( dashed line ) .",
    "we also show the @xmath126 errors to @xmath122 obtained from the variance of @xmath127 ( dotted lines ) .",
    "the values @xmath123 and @xmath124 were chosen in order to obtain the best fit to @xmath128 but they are in very good agreement with the expected values ( obtained for @xmath112 , @xmath129 and string radius of curvature about half the horizon scale ) .",
    "figure 2a shows a superposition of the components of the spectrum ( equations ( 22 ) , ( 23 ) , ( 25 ) and ( 26 ) ) with the above choice of parameters .",
    "the sums were performed using _ mathematica _ ( wolfram 1991 ) . clearly the kaiser - stebbins term ( continous line )",
    "dominates on large angular scales ( @xmath130 ) while the doppler term ( long dashed line ) is dominant on smaller scales .",
    "the contribution of potential perturbations by wakes ( dotted line ) is less important but is clearly not negligible especially on scales of a few arcmin ( @xmath131 ) . finally , the contibution of loops ( short dashed line ) is negligible on all scales larger than 2 - 3 arcmin ( @xmath132 ) .",
    "figure 2b shows the product @xmath133 fot the total spectrum ( equation ( 27 ) ) with @xmath126 errors denoted by the dotted lines .",
    "one of the most interesting questions that may be addressed using the spectrum of figure 2b is _ ` what is the effective power spectrum index n , predicted by cosmic strings on cobe angular scales?'_. previous studies ( bennett , stebbins & bouchet 1992 ; perivolaropoulos 1993a ) have addressed this question without taking into account the effects of potential and doppler perturbations .",
    "the correlation function @xmath134 for perturbations along a great circle is given in terms of @xmath44 as @xmath135 for 2d maps the corresponding equation is ( @xmath136 ) ( efstathiou 1989 ) @xmath137 by isotropy we must have @xmath138 .",

    "1994 ) which favor @xmath151 . in contast",
    "it is much harder for inflationary models to explain such high values of @xmath140 ( lyth & liddle 1994 ; steinhardt 1993 ) .",
    "there is a simple analytic way to show that in the sector of the power spectrum where the kaiser - stebbins effect dominates , a scale invariant ( @xmath152 ) spectrum should be expected . for @xmath153 ( as in the case of the kaiser - stebbins seed functions ) , ( 12 ) may be writen as @xmath154 therefore @xmath155 which indicates a scale invariant spectrum for the kaiser - stebbins term in the angular scale range @xmath156 ( @xmath157 ) .",
    "the kaiser - stebbins term plotted in figure 2a ( continous line ) is in agreement with this result ( the best fit for this component of the spectrum is obtained for @xmath158 ) .",
