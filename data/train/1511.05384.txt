    "in this section we investigate relations between two path numbers @xmath4 and @xmath108 for an arbitrary graph @xmath3 .",
    "let us start with the following example , showing that two elements of a path sequence must satisfy some additional conditions apart from the ones given in the previous section .",

    "<S> a subset @xmath0 of vertices of a graph @xmath1 is called a @xmath2-path vertex cover if every path on @xmath2 vertices in @xmath3 contains at least one vertex from @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> denote by @xmath4 the minimum cardinality of a @xmath2-path vertex cover in @xmath3 and form a sequence @xmath5 , called the path sequence of @xmath3 . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we prove necessary and sufficient conditions for two integers to appear on fixed positions in @xmath6 . a complete list of all possible path sequences ( with multiplicities ) for small connected graphs is also given . </S>"
