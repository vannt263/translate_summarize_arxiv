    "after obtaining the bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) in experiments with vapors of alkaline metal atoms , theoretical and experimental investigation of linear waves and nonlinear structures in the bec have been performed . in recent years",
    "the interest to the polarized bec has been increasing .",
    "it is connected with recent experimental progress in cooling of polarized atoms and molecules . at present day",
    "the bec with magnetic polarization is realized on atoms @xmath0cr .",
    "there are a lot of attempt of experimental obtaining of the electrically polarized bec ( see reviews  @xcite-  @xcite ) . for this aim",
    ", bose molecules having the electric dipole moment have been cooled .",
    "particular interest to the electrically polarized bec brought because of large dipole - dipole scattering length , and thereby because of both the big magnitude and large distance of interaction in compare with analogous quantities for the magnetized bec .",
    "many processes in quantum systems are determined by the dynamics and the dispersion of collective excitations ( ce )  @xcite .",
    "the law dispersion of the ce in the degenerate dilute bose gas was obtained by bogoliubov in 1947  @xcite .",
    "many authors studied the change of the bogoliubov spectrum which arises when the short - range interaction accounted more carefully  @xcite-  @xcite , or geometry of the system is complex  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite . in papers",
    "@xcite-  @xcite authors studied the influence of the electric dipole moment ( edm ) dynamics on the dispersion of the ce in the bec .",
    "the contribution of polarization in the dispersion law of the bogoliubov mode was obtained in ref.s  @xcite-  @xcite .",
    "instability of the bogoliubov spectrum in the 3d dipolar bec ( dbec ) with the repulsive short - range interaction ( sri ) was shown in ref.s  @xcite-  @xcite .",
    "u. r. fisher  @xcite obtained that the bogoliubov mode in the 2d dbec is stable for a wide range of system parameters .",
    "there are also review papers  @xcite-  @xcite , where various aspects of physics of the polarized bec were considered . in this paper",
    "we are interested in possibility of the polarization wave existence in the dbec , i.e. in existence of new type of the ce .",
    "dynamics of polarization is interesting not for the quantum gases only , but in the solid state physics and the physics of low - dimensional systems too .",
    "the polarization waves in the low dimensional and the multy - layer systems of conductors , dielectrics , and semiconductors are considered in the papers  @xcite .",
    "analogously , in the bec of molecules having the edm we expect the existence of a polarization wave along with the bogoliubov mode .",
    "for investigation of the bec , in system of particles with the edm or the magnetic moments , various theoretical methods are used .",
    "one of the ways of theoretical description of the polarized bec is the generalization of well - known gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation  @xcite-  @xcite . in this way",
    "next papers were made : for the spinor bec  @xcite , for the effect of magnetic moment on the bec evolution  @xcite-  @xcite and for the influence of electrical polarization of atoms on the dynamic processes in the bec  @xcite-  @xcite .",
    "dipolar fermions also attract a lot of attention  @xcite ,  @xcite .",
    "the same generalization of the gp equation is usually used for the magnetic moments and the electric dipoles : @xmath1 @xmath2 in equation ( [ di bec gp eq for introduction ] ) following designation are used : @xmath3 is the macroscopic wave function , @xmath4 is the chemical potential , @xmath5 is the potential of external field , @xmath6 is the constant of short - range interaction , @xmath7 is the dipole electric moment of single atom , @xmath8 is the mass of particles and @xmath9 is the planck constant divided by @xmath10 .",
    "along with the gp equation the method of quantum hydrodynamics ( qhd ) is also used .",
    "the method of qhd  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite was used for investigations of various physical systems , particularly for the bec  @xcite ,  @xcite and the polarization waves in conductors and semiconductors  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the method of qhd could be used to consider the possibility of arising polarization waves in the bec and calculate of the dispersion law of these waves .    at interpretation of the ddi in the quantum gases ( qg ) used the notion of the scattering length ( sl ) and the first born approximation ( fba ) , analogously to the sri described by the fourth term in the right - hand side of equation ( [ di bec gp eq for introduction ] ) .",
    "therefore , the problem reduces to the process of scattering .",
    "different approximations based on scattering process was analyzed in ref .",
    "@xcite . particularly , where were considered condition of the fba using and presented generalization of the gp equation for the scattering of polarized atoms beyond the fba .    considering the qhd we do not formulate the scattering problem .",
    "we do not need to limit ourselves to a scattering process , because we are interested in interaction between atoms including interaction between several atoms at the same time .",
    "this statement is especially important for the polarized atoms because of the long - range interaction between dipoles .",
    "each act of interaction between dipoles could be considered as the scattering process for system of particles with a low concentration .",
    "this approximation is possible as for the neutral polarized particles as for the charged particles .",
    "the kinetic theory for the last case was developed by l. d. landau in 1936  @xcite .",
    "landau constructed collision term for the coulomb particles , using analogy with the boltzmann equation .",
    "the landau collision integral depends on a scattering cross section . in this connection he considered the problem of the scattering of charged particles on small angles , that is suitable for rare systems . strictly speaking , for particles with the long - range interaction the conception of the self - consistent field",
    "is more suitable .",
    "this conception was suggested by a. a. vlasov in 1938 , for system of the charged particles  @xcite .",
    "in fact , group of particles moves in the field of their neighbors , but state of motion of the neighbors depends on motion of this group of particles as well ( this picture of interaction is described on fig .",
    "[ dipbecint01 ] ) . according to this idea vlasov proposed a kinetic equation for the charged particles called the vlasov equation .",
    "actually the landau collision integral and the vlasov equation are the two opposite branches of a hypothetical general theory . in this paper",
    "we follow to the vlasov approximation and derive the self - consistent field theory for the dipole - dipole interaction in the quantum gases . from this point of view",
    ", there is no need to consider the first born approximation or scattering process . in appendix b to this paper we present derivation of the gp equation for polarized particles from the qhd equations .",
    "we did it at the condition that dipoles are parallel each other and to an external field , they directions do not oscillate or vibrate around an equilibrium direction .",
    "( color online ) the figure presents the picture of the self - consistent interaction between dipoles .",
    "total polarization of region 2 ( red ) interacts with total polarization of region 1 ( green ) . changing the extreme point of a radius vector ( or shifting the region 2 )",
    "we can scan whole space . in this way we obtain action of external dipoles on region 1 .",
    "changing position of region 1 and repeating described operation we obtain action of surrounding dipoles on each region of space .",
    "this is a picture of the self - consistent interaction in fixed moment of time and this picture governs an evolution of polarization in system .",
    "this picture of interaction is typical for the classic physics , where we need to obtain smooth functions describing collective motion . for this aim",
    "is necessary to average the collective variables at the physically infinitesimal volume ( sketched circle ) . in quantum mechanics , where the particle concentration , polarization of medium , etc , are defined via wave function and",
    "we can consider described picture on interaction of separate particle instead of space regions.,width=302 ]    other methods were also applied for investigation of the polarized bec and other systems of particles having the edm , along with the gp equation .",

    "<S> we suggest the construction of a set of the quantum hydrodynamics equations for the bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) , where atoms have the electric dipole moment . the contribution of the dipole - dipole interactions ( ddi ) to the euler equation is obtained . quantum equations for the evolution of medium polarization </S>",
    "<S> are derived . </S>",
    "<S> developing mathematical method allows to study effect of interactions on the evolution of polarization . </S>",
    "<S> the developing method can be applied to various physical systems in which dynamics is affected by the ddi . </S>",
    "<S> derivation of gross - pitaevskii equation for polarized particles from the quantum hydrodynamics is described . </S>",
    "<S> we showed that the gross - pitaevskii equation appears at condition when all dipoles have the same direction which does not change in time . </S>",
    "<S> comparison of the equation of the electric dipole evolution with the equation of the magnetization evolution is described . </S>",
    "<S> dispersion of the collective excitations in the dipolar bec , either affected or not affected by the uniform external electric field , is considered using our method . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the evolution of polarization in the bec leads to the formation of a novel type of the collective excitations . </S>",
    "<S> detailed description of the dispersion of collective excitations is presented . </S>",
    "<S> we also consider the process of wave generation in the polarized bec by means of a monoenergetic beam of neutral polarized particles . </S>",
    "<S> we compute the possibilities of the generation of bogoliubov and polarization modes by the dipole beam . </S>"
