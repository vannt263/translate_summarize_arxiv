    "the concept of scaling , which plays an important role in the investigation of hadronic structure , can be introduced in the description of scattering processes whenever the cross section factorizes into a product of two different quantities , with the first one reflecting the nature of the scattering process , and therefore depending upon the relevant independent kinematical variables , and the second one ( the _ scaling function _ ) reflecting the internal structure of the target , and therefore depending upon a new variable ( the _ scaling variable _ ) which can be associated to the dynamics of the constituents of the target .",

    "inclusive scattering of leptons off a nucleus @xmath29 in the quasi - elastic ( qe ) region ( @xmath30 , i.e. @xmath31 ) has been theoretically shown  @xcite to exhibit another kind of scaling , the so called y - scaling , which can be summarized as follows - scaling see refs .",

    "the main results of our analysis can be summarized as follows :    \\1 .",
    "the relativistic inclusive @xmath42 cross section has been obtained in terms of the pole matrix elements @xmath248 and @xmath249 , taking into account the off - mass shellness of the nucleon and it has been found that unlike the non relativistic case , the bs cross section does not factorize into a product of the free electron - nucleon cross section and a structure factor depending upon the deuteron momentum distribution .",
    "it has been shown that the bs cross section can be written as a function of the three momentum transfer @xmath250 and a variable @xmath6 , which is exactly the same relativistic scaling variable used in the non relativistic approach and resulting from the relativistic instant - form energy momentum conservation .",
    "thus , in full analogy with the non relativistic case , a relativistic scaling function @xmath251 has been defined as the ratio of the bs @xmath42 cross section to the free @xmath65 cross section ( times a proper phase space factor ) , and @xmath6-scaling of @xmath251 has been demonstrated to occur , i.e. @xmath252 , with the conditions for relativistic @xmath6-scaling being very similar to those of non relativistic scaling , i.e. @xmath253 .    \\3 .",
    "it has been pointed out , that whereas the mechanism of non relativistic scaling is easily understood in terms of the rapid decay of the momentum distribution @xmath149 , which makes the non relativistic scaling function @xmath254 to rapidly saturate with @xmath44 , i.e. to scale in @xmath6 , a similar explanation in the relativistic case is not , in principle , possible , since , as stated in point 1 , the bs cross section does not factorize , and , moreover , the concept of momentum distribution in the bs case is not uniquely defined .",
    "thus , in order to understand the mechanism of the observed relativistic @xmath6-scaling , the role of the various components of the bs amplitude was analyzed , and it has been found that if the extremely small diagonal contribution of the negative energy @xmath41-waves is omitted , it is possible to define a covariant momentum distribution of the form @xmath255 , where @xmath234 , which originates from the interference between the positive and negative waves , can be safely disregarded provided @xmath256 , so that , as a result , the bs cross section factorizes in the same way as does the non relativistic cross section and the relativistic scaling function becomes @xmath257 ; such a result provides the explanation for the relativistic @xmath6-scaling and makes it possible to obtain the bs covariant momentum distributions by a simple first order derivative of the asymptotic bs scaling function @xmath258 .",
    "4 . the bs relativistic momentum distribution , @xmath17 , and the non relativistic one , @xmath149 , are practically the same up to @xmath259 , where they start to differ by an amount which depends upon the two - body interaction producing @xmath149 . to sum up , it can be concluded that , if the effects from negative energy @xmath41-states can be disregarded , which has been demonstrated to be the case when the nucleon momentum in the deuteron @xmath260 , the concept of @xmath6-scaling can be introduced in the bs relativistic description of inclusive quasi - elastic @xmath42 scattering , in the same way as it is in the conventional non relativistic approach , i.e. by introducing a scaling function which , in the scaling regime , is nothing but the nucleon longitudinal momentum distribution ; moreover , both in the relativistic and non relativistic cases , scaling is shown to occur in the same variable @xmath6 , and at values of @xmath23 and @xmath44 such that quasi - elastic scattering is the dominant process",
