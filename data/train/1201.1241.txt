    "the recent confirmation of neutrino oscillations @xcite gives a  clear signal of existence of physics beyond the standard model of particles and interactions ( sm ) . among many exotic proposals the introduction of supersymmetry ( susy ) proved to be both elegant and effective in solving some of the drawbacks of the sm .",
    "the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) ( a  comprehensive review can be found in @xcite ) populates the so - called desert between the electroweak and the planck scale with new heavy susy particles , thus removing the scale problem .",
    "what is more , using the mssm renormalization group equations for gauge couplings indicates that there is a  unification of @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 around @xmath4 which means that mssm in a  somehow natural way includes grand unified theories ( guts ) .",
    "this model is also characterized by a  heavier higgs boson , comparing with the higgs boson predicted by sm , which is in better agreement with the known experimental data .",
    "new interactions present in mssm lead to many exotic processes which opens a  completely new field of research .",
    "building the minimal supersymmetric version of the standard model one usually assumes the conservation of the @xmath0-parity , defined as @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the baryon number , @xmath7 the lepton number , and @xmath8 the spin of the particle .",
    "the definition implies that all ordinary sm particles have @xmath9 and all their superpartners have @xmath10 . in theories preserving @xmath0-parity the product of @xmath0 of all the interacting particles in a  vertex of a  feynman diagram must be equal to @xmath11 .",
    "this implies that the lepton and baryon numbers are conserved , and that susy particles are not allowed to decay to non - susy ones .",
    "it follows that the lightest susy particle ( usually the lightest neutralino @xmath12 ) must remain stable , giving a  good natural candidate for cold dark matter .",
    "all this makes the @xmath0-parity conserving models very popular .    in practice , however , the @xmath0-parity conservation is achieved by neglecting certain theoretically allowed terms in the superpotential .",
    "casting such hand - waving approach away , one should retain these terms , finishing with an  @xmath0-parity violating ( rpv ) model , with richer phenomenology and many even more exotic interactions @xcite .",
    "the rpv models provide mechanisms of generating majorana neutrino masses and magnetic moments , describe neutrino decays , susy particles decays , exotic nuclear processes like the neutrinoless double beta decay , and many more .",
    "being theoretically allowed , rpv susy theories are interesting tools for studying the physics beyond the standard model .",
    "the many never - observed processes allow also to find severe constraints on the non - standard parameters of these models , giving an insight into physics beyond the sm .",
    "the violation of the @xmath0-parity may be introduced in a  few different ways . in the first one @xmath0-parity violation",
    "is introduced as a spontaneous process triggered by a non - zero vacuum expectation value of some scalar field @xcite .",
    "another possibilities include the introduction of additional bi- @xcite or trilinear @xcite rpv terms in the superpotential , or both . in the following we incorporate the explicit rpv breaking scenario .",
    "the @xmath0-parity conserving part of the superpotential of mssm is usually written as @xmath13 ,   \\label{wmssm}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] while its rpv part reads @xmath14 \\nonumber \\\\    & + & \\frac{1}{2}\\epsilon_{xyz } \\lambda''_{ijk}\\bar u_i^x\\bar    d_j^y \\bar d_k^z + \\epsilon_{ab}\\kappa^i l_i^a h_u^b . \\label{wrpv}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the * y * s are 3@xmath153 yukawa matrices . @xmath7 and @xmath16 are the @xmath17 left - handed doublets while @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 denote the right - handed lepton , up - quark and down - quark @xmath17 singlets , respectively . @xmath21 and @xmath22",
    "mean two higgs doublets .",
    "we have introduced color indices @xmath23 , generation indices @xmath24 and the su(2 ) spinor indices @xmath25 .",
    "as far as the ( in principle unknown ) rpv coupling constants are concerned , the most popular approach is to neglect the bilinear terms and to discuss the effects connected with the trilinear terms only . in such a  case",
    ", if one is not intereseted in exotic baryon number violating processes , one has to additionally set @xmath26 , which ensures the stability of the proton . in this paper",
    "we concentrate on the bilinear terms only and set all trilinear rpv couplings to zero .    for completeness",
    "we write down the scalar mass term present in our model , @xmath27 the soft gauginos mass term ( @xmath28 for gluinos ) @xmath29 as well as the supergravity mechanism of supersymmetry breaking , by introducing the lagrangian @xmath30,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where lowercase letters stand for scalar components of the respective chiral superfields , and 3@xmath153 matrices * a * as well as @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the soft breaking coupling constants .",
    "the inclusion of the bilinear rpv terms imply mixing between neutrinos and neutralinos . in the basis @xmath33 the full @xmath34 neutrino  neutralino mixing matrix may be written @xcite in the following form : @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 is the standard mssm neutralino mass matrix : @xmath38 the matrix ( [ eq : nu - neutr - matrix ] ) has the seesaw  like structure and contains the sneutrino vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) @xmath39 .",
    "these are in general free parameters which contribute to the gauge boson masses via the relation @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the usual down - type and up - type higgs boson vevs , respectively . by introducing the angle @xmath43 defined by @xmath44",
    "we obtain four free parameters of the theory : @xmath45 and @xmath39 .",
    "fortunately it turns out that in order to obtain proper electroweak symmetry breaking the sneutrino vevs can not be arbitrary .",
    "we give the details in the next section .",
    "the rpv mssm model introduces several new free parameters when compared with the usual mssm .",
    "fortunately their number can be constrained by imposing gut unification and renormalization group evolution . in this paper",
    "we restrict ourselves to the bilinear rpv couplings only , setting all trilinear couplings ( @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 ) to zero .",
    "this assumption simplifies some of the rge equations , which we list below .",
    "such approach leads at the end to the following set of free parameters : @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath45 , sgn@xmath52 , and @xmath53 ( @xmath54 .",
    "the masses of all the supersymmetric scalars are unified at @xmath55 to a  common value @xmath49 , and of all the supersymmetric fermions to @xmath50 .",
    "the values of the trilinear soft susy breaking couplings are set according to the following relations @xcite @xmath56 the rge equations for the @xmath57 couplings can be found elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the @xmath6 couplings are evolved down to the low energy regime according to the renormalization group equations @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 , @xmath61 being the gut normalization factor .",
    "the three @xmath53 couplings at gut scale remain free in our model . after setting them the couplings",
    "are evolved down to the @xmath63 scale according to the renormalization group equations which in our case take the following simple form : @xmath64    an example of the running of @xmath62 is presented on fig .",
    "[ fig : kappa ] .",
    "one sees that for higher @xmath45 the couplings vary rather weakly ( notice the logarithmic scale on the energy axis ) for the whole energy range between the electroweak scale @xmath63 and @xmath55 . for small @xmath65 the difference between the @xmath55 and @xmath63 values are of the order of @xmath66 .",
    "the value 1  mev at the gut scale was chosen arbitrarily ; we will show later that this is the typical order of magnitude for which agreement with experimental data on neutrino masses and mixing may be obtained .      at the beginning of the numerical procedure we set the down and up higgs vevs to @xmath67",
    "while the initial guess for the sneutrinos vevs is @xmath68 the actual values of @xmath39 are calculated from the condition that at the electroweak symmetry breaking scale the linear potential is minimized . by taking partial derivatives of the potential one obtains the so - called tadpole equations @xcite , which are zero at the minimum .    in our procedure",
    "we solve three equations , which can be written as ( @xmath69 ) @xmath70 where @xmath71 @xmath72 being the kronecker delta , and @xmath73 notice that they are linear in @xmath74 and therefore this set has only one solution . after finding it",
    ", we use the trigonometric parameterization @xcite , which preserves the definition of @xmath45 , @xmath75 to calculate new values of @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "we return back to the tadpoles with these new values and continue in this way until self - consistency of the results is reached .",
    "it turns out that due to the expected smallness of the @xmath39 vevs , the initial guess eq .",
    "( [ eq : vevini ] ) is quite a  good approximation .",
    "it usually suffices to repeat the whole procedure three times to obtain self - consistency at the level of @xmath76 , which is more than enough for our purposes .",
    "the so - obtained set of vevs is used during the determination of the mass spectrum of the model .",
    "it is well known that , once allowing for @xmath0-parity violation , a  particle ",
    "sparticle 1loop diagrams give important corrections to the usual tree level neutrino mass term .",
    "these processes have been extensively discussed in the literature @xcite , mainly in the context of constraining the tree ",
    "level alignment parameters @xmath77 or the trilinear rpv couplings @xmath46 and @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "in general , the explicit rpv effects may be taken into account in three different ways .",
    "one may include the bilinear rpv couplings or the trilinear couplings , or both .",
    "of course the most complete one is the third possibility , which is at the same time the most complicated .",
    "therefore it is customary to limit the discussion to either tri- or bilinear terms only . in this paper",
