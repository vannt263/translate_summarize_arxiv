    "the power of these jets differs by orders of magnitude in quasars that appear similar at uv and optical wavelengths .",
    "the distribution of radio - to - optical power ranges over nearly six orders of magnitude and appears bimodal ( e.g. , kellermann et al .",

    ". why are only a fraction of quasars `` radio - loud ? ''",
    "why is this fraction about a tenth ?",
    "one previously strong result that seemed to be a clue to understanding this radio - loud / radio - quiet dichotomy was that broad - absorption - line ( bal ) qsos appeared to be exclusively radio - quiet ( e.g. , stocke et al .",
    "this suggested that outflows in radio - quiet qsos are not well collimated and either formed or accelerated bal material , while outflows in radio - loud qsos are confined to well collimated relativistic jets .",
    "becker et al . ( 1997a ) reported the discovery of an exception to the above result in the radio - loud bal qso first j155633.8 + 351758 , hereafter first 1556 + 3517 . while the radio flux is high ( @xmath3 mjy ) for its redshift ( z=1.48 ) , making its radio luminosity consistent with those of radio - loud qsos , the bal qso appears optically reddened and relativistically beamed in the radio , making it unclear just how radio - loud the object truly is .",
    "near - ir photometry shows that first 1556 + 3517 , with @xmath4 , is among the reddest qsos known ( hall et al .",
    "iso observations are also consistent with significant dust causing a line - of - sight reddening of @xmath5 , which indicates @xmath6 of dust and 800 @xmath7 of associated gas ( clavel 1998 ) ; correcting the optical magnitude for the reddening would bring first 1556 + 3517 within approximately 1 sigma of the radio - loud / radio - quiet division . furthermore , brotherton et al .",
    "( 1997 ) showed that much of the blue light is scattered , making the direct light from first 1556 + 3517 even more red than apparent .    while just how radio - loud first 1556 + 3517 is remains an open issue , becker et al .",
    "( 1997b ) report the discovery of other radio - loud bal qsos from the first bright quasar survey ( fbqs ; gregg et al .",
    "1995 ) , which selects stellar objects to a limiting magnitude of @xmath8 with @xmath9 that appear in the first , a deep radio survey that reaches 1 mjy at 20 cm ( becker et al .",
    "while none of these new radio - loud bal qsos are as red as first 1556 + 3517 , the fbqs has a weak color selection .",
    "therefore the prospect of reddening in fbqs radio - loud bal qsos remains an issue , especially because none are overly powerful radio sources .    as a result of the discovery of these new objects , weymann ( 1997 )",
    "has refined the statement of the anticorrelation between radio - loudness and the exhibition of bals : `` the observed radial terminal velocity of thermal gas being ejected from luminous qsos is strongly anticorrelated with the radio power of the qso . ''",
    "bal qsos that are formally radio - loud are interesting transition objects , which may display related properties that will shed light on the radio - loud / radio - quiet dichotomy .    in this letter , we report the discovery of five radio - loud bal qsos , selected as stellar objects with an ultraviolet excess ( uvx ) , and detected by the nrao vla sky survey ( nvss ; condon et al .",
    "1998 ) , within a complete sample of 111 qso candidates .",
    "because of the uvx selection , these qsos are unlikely to be reddened significantly .",

    "section 4 discusses the potential importance of these bal qsos and how our results compare with other surveys .",
    "as recommended by weymann ( 1997 ) , we adopt log r * as the formal measure of radio - loudness with log r * = 1.0 dividing radio - loud and radio - quiet qsos , where r * is the k - corrected ratio of radio - to - optical power ( sramek & weedman 1980 ; stocke et al .",
    "the uvx - nvss sample includes quasar candidates from the uvx ( aat-2df ) quasar survey ( smith et al .",
    "1996 ) that are within 10@xmath10 of a radio source from the nvss . to make the matches , we extracted our own radio catalog from the nvss images using the happy algorithm ( white et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "the uvx catalog includes just over 46000 stellar objects that meet the following selection criteria .",
    "the primary color selection is @xmath11 , which accounts for 90% of the qso candidates .",
    "additional color selection using @xmath12  extends the redshift range of qsos selected to @xmath13 , about 10% of the catalog .",
    "the magnitude limits are 18.25 @xmath14 20.85 .",
    "the area surveyed covers approximately 740 square degrees in two strips : ( 1 ) between declination + 2.5@xmath15 and @xmath162.5@xmath15 and right ascension 9.8 hours to 14.8 hours and ( 2 ) between declination @xmath1627.5@xmath15 and @xmath1632.5@xmath15 and right ascension 21.7 hours to 3.3 hours .",
    "preliminary 2df observations demonstrate that the uvx catalog is approximately 50% contaminated by non - agn sources , predominantly stars and narrow - line galaxies .",
    "the additional restriction that candidates also have a 20 cm radio flux density @xmath17 2.5 mjy ( 5 @xmath18 limit ) reduces the contamination to @xmath19 based on results below .",
    "the @xmath20 qso sample is expected to be @xmath21 complete with respect to previous qso surveys , with a lower level of completeness for @xmath13 ; additional details of the multicolor selection and completeness will be given by smith et al .",

    "we obtained spectra of all 111 quasar candidates from the equatorial uvx - nvss catalog with @xmath22 and right ascensions from 10 hours to 13 hours .",

    "given the selection criteria , all quasars in our sample with @xmath29 will be formally radio - loud ( log r * @xmath30 1 ) ; in the case of these specific objects , due to the combination of the properties of the quasar population , the selection criteria , and chance , all 103 quasars are formally radio - loud .",
    "we find three low - ionization bal qsos ( 3@xmath12% of the quasars with @xmath25 ) and two high - ionization bal qsos ( 6@xmath14% of the quasars with @xmath29 ; one of the low - ionization bal qsos also has @xmath29 making a total of 9@xmath15% bal qsos in the high-@xmath31 category ) .",

    "there are interesting features in two bal qsos .",
    "first , the absorption profiles in 1053@xmath160058 are unusual , appearing to extend to the red of the emission peak as well as to the customary blue : based on the redshift of the peak of ] @xmath44 , the @xmath26  emission should peak near the center of the absorption , and the @xmath45emission should peak near the local maximum in its corresponding absorption trough .",
    "this suggests an unusual flow pattern or significantly blueshifted emission lines ( e.g. , brotherton et al .",
    "1994 ) .",
    "second , in 1225@xmath160150 the emission - line spectrum is unusual and there is a `` mini - bal '' candidate .",
    "the intensity ratio of @xmath46  to ] @xmath44 is 0.88 ( based on a two - gaussian fit ) , significantly larger than nearly all other known qsos , including other bal qsos , which have enhanced / ] compared to radio - quiet qsos ( weymann et al .",
    "( an exception might be the handful of qsos like h0335@xmath16336 ( hartig & baldwin 1986 ) , which show strong @xmath46  and a strong in place of ] @xmath44 . )",
    "@xmath281549 emission appears weak relative to emission from ] @xmath44 and the @xmath281400 feature ( a blend of @xmath281397 and ] @xmath281402 ; see wills et al .",
    "1993 ) ; the @xmath281549 emission line does not appear to be affected by the bal trough , which appears detached by more than 8000 km s@xmath23 .",
    "what these unusual line ratios mean is not clear , although strong @xmath46  is an important coolant for very dense gas ( e.g. , ferland et al .",
    "1996 ) . because @xmath281549 is likely to have a very high optical depth",
    ", the line may become an ineffective emitter at high density ( e.g. , zheng & puetter 1990 ) .",
    "additionally , there is a smooth , intermediate width ( @xmath47 900 km s@xmath23 ) absorption system at @xmath1627,000 km s@xmath23 seen in both @xmath281549 and @xmath281397 ( the latter line is not commonly seen in interstellar systems ) ; we suggest that this may be an intrinsic `` mini - bal '' system ( e.g. , hamann et al .",
    "1997 ) , but higher resolution spectroscopy , perhaps at multiple epochs , would be needed to confirm our suggestion .",
    "foltz et al . (",
    "1990 ) find that 9% of the optically selected large bright quasar survey ( lbqs ; foltz et al .",
    "1987 , 1989 ; hewett et al . 1991 ; chaffee et al . 1991 ; morris et al . 1991 ; francis et al .",
    "1992 ) qsos with @xmath48 are bal qsos , the same fraction we find for our @xmath48 radio - loud uvx sample .",
    "one of the three bal qsos in our high - redshift subsample displays low - ionization bals .",
    "while this result is not statistically unlikely given the expected 0.1 fraction of low - ionization bals in optically selected samples , it is suggestive of an excess because this is a strongly color - selected sample .",
    "previous work has shown that low - ionization bal qsos tend to be more dust reddened than either high - ionization bal qsos or the bulk of radio - quiet qsos ( sprayberry & foltz 1992 ) .",
    "the question remains why radio - loud bal qsos were not identified sooner .",
    "two methods have been employed : searching the spectra of radio - loud qsos for bals , and measuring the radio - loudness of optically selected bal qsos ( e.g. , stocke et al . 1992 ) .",
    "the first method failed apparently because of the shallowness of radio surveys given the persistent but unexplained anticorrelation stated in section 1 . while our results suggest that the incidence of bals is independent of whether log r * is greater than or less than unity , it appears that there is some value of log r * above which bals are not seen .",
    "the answer to this issue will likely emerge with the growth of the fbqs ( e.g. , gregg et al . 1995 ) .",
    "the best current limits are discussed by weymann ( 1997 ) , who finds no bals among 20 qsos with 6 cm flux densities between 30 and 100 mjy .",
    "the radio - loud bal qsos reported here and by becker et al .",
    "( 1997b ) have 20 cm flux densities of no higher than approximately 30 mjy .",
    "given the optical fluxes of the qsos , the radio - loudness above which bals are not seen appears to be near to our largest log r * = 2.5 .",
    "the second method of discovering radio - loud qsos , while searching deep enough in the radio , failed apparently through insufficient numbers .",
    "there are about 5200 uvx quasar candidates that meet the present selection criteria independent of nvss detection , half of which should be qsos , and five of which we found to be radio loud bal qsos .",
    "therefore , the fraction of radio - loud bal qsos found with pure optical selection is at least 1 in 500 ( at least because the nvss does not detect all the radio - loud qsos in the sample , and because we do not know how many of the low - redshift qsos may show bals in the unobserved ultraviolet ) . assuming that 1/3 of the @xmath472600 uvx qsos have @xmath49 , for which the high - ionization @xmath281549 bal trough can be seen at wavelengths greater than 4000  the observed radio - loud bal qso fraction is greater than about 1 in 200 . at the lower limit of these detection rates ,",
    "the lbqs was too small to be sure of finding such an object . because becker et al .",
    "( 1997b ) find radio - loud bal qsos within the fbqs ( gregg et al .",
    "1995 ) , the fact that the uvx - nvss sample is optically fainter than the lbqs probably is not important .    despite differences in selection criterion , there are similarities that bias both the fbqs and the uvx - nvss sample toward finding radio - loud bal qsos . both samples preferentially select large numbers of radio - intermediate and radio - loud but low log r * qsos . furthermore , the radio selection is at a relatively high frequency , 1400 mhz .",
    "if falcke et al . (",
    "1996 ) are correct that radio - quiet qsos possess relativistic radio - emitting jets and that some fraction of radio - loud but low log r * qsos are actually beamed radio - quiet qsos , the pure anticorrelation between radio - loudness and the presence of bals may still be preserved .",
    "radio maps with high spatial resolution or spectral indices are needed for these radio - loud bal qsos to rule out strong beaming .",
    "such a face - on geometry with bal outflow along a radio - quiet jet axis could explain the overabundance of bals seen among radio - intermediate qsos by francis , hooper , & impey ( 1993 ) .",
    "we have discovered five radio - loud bal qsos in a complete sample of 103 deep - radio detected uvx qsos which are unlikely to be significantly dust reddened .",
    "the 9@xmath15% bal qsos in the high - redshift sample ( @xmath27 , entirely radio - loud ) is consistent with the frequency in purely optically selected qsos ( 9% ) .",
    "we find three ( 3@xmath12% ) low - ionization bal qsos , also consistent with pure optical selection ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "while bals are not seen in the most radio - loud qsos , the incidence of bals appears to be independent across the conventional radio - loud / radio - quiet division .",
