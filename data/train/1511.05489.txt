    "the discovery of the fractional quantum hall effect ( fqhe)@xcite provided an important impetus to investigate the physics of low - dimensional systems wherein particle- particle interactions play a fundamental role in the resulting dynamics . since the original work of laughlin@xcite , many theoretical approaches have been employed both to explain the observed collective behavior in the fqhe regime , and to expand the tools utilized for , and make connections between , a variety of strongly - correlated many - body problems . in particular ,",
    "model wavefunctions ( building upon the original variational ground state proposed by laughlin ) have been employed to study the ground state and elementary excitations@xcite , as well as composite - particle models@xcite , exact diagonalization for few - body systems@xcite and special conformal field theories@xcite .",
    "the problem is extremely rich ; although much early work focused on interacting fermions , the generalization of the problem to other systems has been ongoing .",
    "the richness associated with the fundamental dynamics of the fqhe regime ( i.e. a system of two - dimensional ( 2d ) charged particles under a large transverse dc magnetic field ) may be traced to the dynamic bound states resulting from the interplay of the inter - particle interactions and the external magnetic field . in 2d",
    ", any repulsive interaction will serve to separate the constituent particles to lower the energy , and the resulting separating motion will couple to the magnetic field , turning the particle trajectories back on themselves .",
    "the resulting dynamic many - particle bound state ( in the absence of additional confining potentials ) , is a rich problem , even classically , wherein a primary feature is that the bound system is dominated by rotation , and thus the system angular momentum is a key feature @xcite .",
    "a useful tool for connecting the classical problem to the quantum many - body problem is the study of the two - body fqh problem@xcite ; here the problem is separable , and the precise role of the relative angular momentum is evident .    in the absence of inter - particle interactions ,",
    "the spectrum of a 2-d charged gas under transverse field is comprised of a set of highly - degenerate landau levels@xcite . in the fqhe regime ,",
    "the dynamic bound states described above are responsible for creating gaps in the energy spectrum _ within _ the landau levels , and it is the origin and structure of these gaps , as well as the elementary excitations associated with them , that has garnered significant attention .",
    "it was originally pointed out by laughlin@xcite , and later studied in detail for few - body systems , that in the ground state of the interacting system in the lowest landau level the angular momentum for small clusters goes up in integer multiples of the particle number @xcite .",
    "in addition , exact diagonalization studies of few - body clusters interacting via coulomb potentials exhibit ` magic numbers ' in ground state energy of the system as a function of the total angular momentum@xcite ; at specific values of total angular momenta , local minima appear in the ground state energy , and at specific values of the ` magic ' angular momenta , a corresponding maxima in the the excitation gap from the ground state appears@xcite .",
    "the magic angular momenta for which the gaps appear are precisely those given by the trial ground - state wavefunction , and may be interpreted via the observation@xcite that in the fhqe ground state , the relative angular momentum for each pair of particles is the _ same _ , and the total angular momentum is therefore found via @xmath1q$ ] , the usual result for the thermodynamic limit of large systems . here",
    "@xmath2 is the total angular momentum , @xmath3 is the relative angular momentum quantum number for particles @xmath4 and @xmath5 , @xmath6 is the total number of particles , and @xmath7 is an odd integer ( fermi statistics ) . the origin of this remarkable result , and its dependence upon the form of the interactions , is an interesting question .    a further interesting question is whether or not the features of the fqhe regime generalize in a straightforward manner . in particular , can the structure of the vector potential and the particle interactions be projected in order to illuminate physical reasons for some of the fundamental structures ? recently ,",
    "separation of the schrdinger equation in hyperspherical coordinates in the fqhe regime demonstrated that the appearance of the fqhe may be associated with patterns in the degeneracy of the states@xcite , a conjecture also made earlier by stone , et . al.@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we study the dynamics of few - body 2d bosonic systems interacting via regularized pseudo - potential contact interactions under transverse magnetic field within the adiabatic hyperspherical method .",
    "the hyperspherical framework gives a convenient picture for studying the nature of the role of interactions and the degeneracy of the ground state , as well as the resulting landau - level structure .",
    "when interactions are included , we find that , away from a set of narrow avoided crossings in the eigenspectrum , the three - boson problem is nearly separable in hyperspherical coordinates , in agreement with previous results for few - electrons interacting via the coulomb interaction @xcite .",
    "weak attractive or repulsive s - wave interactions also produce ground state energies for fixed angular momentum that exhibit even / odd parity oscillations . on the repulsive side",
    ", we surmise that if repulsive higher angular momentum interactions are included , this parity oscillation combined with the degeneracy pattern of the lowest landau level might be the source of the ` magic number ' behavior predicted in previous studies .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we describe our theoretical approach including developing the hamiltonian for three - bosons in 2d with a perpendicular magnetic field , separating out the center of mass motion , and transforming into hyperspherical coordinates .",
    "we also describe the landau level structure that results for the noninteracting case and develop a transcendental equation , the roots of which produce the adiabatic hyperradial potentials . in section iii",
    "we examine the resulting adiabatic potentials and discuss the limiting cases of large and small s - wave two - body scattering length . in section iv ,",
