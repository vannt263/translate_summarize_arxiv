    "the seminal paper of searle & zinn ( 1978 ) argued that the formation of the milky way galaxy was clumpy and rather chaotic .",
    "furthermore , they suggested that some galactic globular clusters ( gcs ) may not have formed _ in situ _ but rather in proto - galactic fragments or dwarf galaxies that were later accreted .",
    "several workers have attempted to identify candidates for these accreted gcs .",
    "methods have included the retrograde motion of some metal - poor gcs ( rodgers & paltoglou 1984 ) , the variation of horizontal branch ( hb ) morphology with metallicity in the outer halo ( zinn 1993 ) , the oosterhoff class ( van den bergh 1993 ) , the size - perigalactic distance relation ( van den bergh 1995 ) and associations in phase - space ( lynden - bell & lynden - bell 1995 ) .    this subject was given impetus with the discovery of the accreted sagittarius ( sgr ) dwarf galaxy and its system of globular clusters ( ibata , gilmore & irwin 1995 ) .",
    "it has four clearly identified gcs ( terzan 7 , terzan 8 , arp 2 and m54 ) , with m54 as a prime candidate for the nucleus of the disrupted dwarf ( layden & sarajedini 2000 ) . comparing the phase - space distribution of gcs with the expected orbital path of the sgr dwarf , bellazzini  ( 2003a ) confirmed the status of these four gcs and identified a number of other possible gcs .",
    "the closest two gcs to the orbital path are pal 12 and ngc 4147 .",
    "bellazzini  ( 2003b ) found evidence for sgr dwarf ` tidal debris ' ( i.e. stripped stars ) around these gcs further supporting their association with the sgr galaxy .",
    "for the third closest gc , pal 5 , odenkirchen ( 2003 ) concluded that it was _ not _ part of the sgr dwarf as it is on a different orbital plane .",
    "thus , we have a sample of six gcs which can be confidently associated with the sgr dwarf . for a magnitude of @xmath1",
    ", this corresponds to a specific frequency of s@xmath2 = 18 , comparable to that of fornax dwarf ( s@xmath2 = 29 ; forbes  2000 ) , the highest s@xmath2 galaxy in the local group .",
    "recently , martin ( 2003 ) presented evidence for a second disrupted dwarf galaxy in the milky way ( martin 2003 ) .",
    "the ` monoceros ring ' , discovered earlier by newberg ( 2002 ) , is now thought to be the tidal stream of this disrupted dwarf ( whose nucleus lies in the direction of canis major ) . crane ( 2003 ) and frinchaboy ( 2004 ) compared the phase - space distribution of galactic clusters with m giant stars in the monoceros ring . assuming a typical thick disk velocity dispersion",
    ", they identified five gcs candidates of the disrupted dwarf .",
    "they are ngc  2298 , ngc  2808 , ngc  5286 , pal  1 and bh  176 respectively .    in the canis major discovery paper ,",
    "martin  ( 2003 ) included an n - body simulation of the dwarf s orbit over the last 2 gyrs .",
    "they simulated both a prograde and retrograde orbit .",
    "although the prograde orbit is favoured , the retrograde orbit could not be ruled out .",
    "further observational constraints and a non - static galactic potential in the model should help to confirm which orbit is correct .",
    "several gcs were found to have phase - space distributions in common with both models , which led martin ( 2003 ) to conclude they were associated with the canis major dwarf .",
    "they are : ngc 1851 , ngc 1904 , ngc 2298 and ngc 2808 . for",
    "an assumed magnitude similar to the sgr dwarf ( martin  2003 ) , the four gcs translate into a specific frequency of s@xmath2 = 12 . in a follow - up paper ,",
    "bellazzini ( 2003c ) argued that the spatial position and stellar populations of the old open clusters am-2 and tom  2 imply that they too are associated with the canis major dwarf .",
    "here we derive an updated age - metallicity relation for the sgr dwarf galaxy and compare it to the canis major and monoceros ring cluster systems .",
    "we show that the canis major gcs reveal well - defined age - metallicity and size - galactocentric distance relations .",
    "finally , we briefly discuss the possible thick disk / bulge association of the canis major gcs and assess the overall importance of accretion in building the stellar mass of the milky way .",
    "in table 1 we list various properties of the gcs associated with the sgr and canis major dwarf galaxies .",
    "we also include the three gc candidates , in addition to ngc  2298 and ngc  2808 , put forward by crane ( 2003 ) . we will refer to the latter three as the ` mono ring gcs ' but remind the reader that the ring is a tidal stream of the canis major dwarf observed near the galactic anti - center .",
    "most ages and metallicities are taken from the homogeneous compilation of salaris & weiss ( 2002 ) .",
    "however , metallicities for terzan 8 , m54 , ngc  4147 , ngc  5286 and pal  1 come from harris ( 1996 ) .",
    "the age of terzan 8 is assumed to be old , i.e. 13 gyrs old with m54 1 gyr younger at 12 gyrs based on the study of montegriffo  ( 1998 ) , for ngc  4147 and ngc  5286 we assume an old age ( 13.0 gyrs ) based on the colour - magnitude diagrams of friel ( 1987 ) and samus ( 1995 ) respectively , for pal  1 we take the age derived by rosenberg ( 1998 ) .",
    "we note that most of these age estimates are based on the magnitude difference between the horizontal branch and the main sequence turnoff , and thus may suffer from unknown systematic errors due to the second parameter effect .",
    "other properties are from the catalog of harris ( 1996 ) .    from table 1",
    "it can be seen that both the sgr and canis major / mono ring gc systems have a variety of hb morphologies , with different magnitude and metallicity distributions .",
    "the gcs also have both prograde and retrograde motions ( rodgers & paltoglou 1984 ) .",
    "thus such properties are probably of limited use in separating _ bona fide _ milky way gcs from those that have been accreted from disrupted dwarfs .",

    "the age - metallicity relation ( amr ) of a stellar system provides a key probe of the chemical enrichment history of that system ( e.g. , pagel & tautvaisiene 1995 ) . here , we derive an updated age - metallicity relation for the sgr dwarf ( see e.g. layden & sarajedini 2000 ) using both the gc system given in table 1 and studies of field stars .",
    "ages and metallicities for three field star populations in sgr were measured by layden & sarajedini ( 2000 ) .",

    "the mean age - metallicity and range for these four stellar fields , and the six gcs of the sgr galaxy are shown in fig . 1 .    in fig . 1",
    ", we also overplot a theoretical amr derived from a simple closed - box chemical enrichment model .",
    "this model assumes that the stellar system was completely gaseous 13.5 gyrs ago , and converted gas into stars at a constant rate ( set so that the gas supply has just been depleted at the present day ) .",
    "we assume z@xmath38 = 0.02 .",
    "we find that using a yield of 0.004 gives a reasonable fit to the data .",
    "the model amr provides a very good representation of the chemical enrichment history of the sgr dwarf over the last @xmath3913 gyrs .",
    "this supports the suggestion of layden & sarajedini ( 2000 ) that the sgr dwarf may have formed stars and gcs without significant infall or explusion of gas .",
    "simple closed - box models are also inferred for the fornax dwarf ( pont  2003 ) and the lmc / smc galaxies ( piatti  2002 ) , but more complicated enrichment models are also possible ( e.g. smecker - hane & mcwilliams 2002 ) .",
    "we now proceed to compare the sgr model amr with cluster and field star data for the canis major dwarf .",
    "as noted in the introduction , martin ( 2003 ) identified four gcs associated with the canis major dwarf and bellazzini ( 2003c ) added two old open clusters .",
    "the open clusters , am-2 and tom  2 , have approximate ages and metallicities of 5 gyrs and [ fe / h ] = @xmath40 ( lee 1997 ) and 4 gyrs and [ fe / h ] = @xmath41 ( brown  1996 ) respectively .    in fig .",
    "2 we show these six canis major clusters compared to the sgr model amr . given the similar inferred luminosities for the two galaxies ( martin 2003 )",
    ", we might expect the sgr amr to be a reasonable approximation for canis major .",
    "indeed this appears to be the case .",
    "both galaxies are consistent with a simple closed - box chemical enrichment model , although the stellar yield in the canis major galaxy may have been slightly higher than in sgr .",
    "we also show the three additional mono ring gcs candidates suggested by crane ( 2003 ) . the gcs pal  1 and ngc  5286 are generally consistent with the high yield amr , but the very young gc bh  176 deviates significantly ( @xmath423@xmath43 ) from it .",
    "we conclude that bh  176 is _",
    "unlikely _ to be a former member of the canis major dwarf galaxy .",
    "2 also shows the ages and metallicities of the remaining ( i.e. non sgr and non canis major ) milky way gcs in the list of salaris & weiss ( 2002 ) .",
    "the model amr deviates from the milky way gc distribution at intermediate - to - high metallicities .",
    "the milky way gcs reveal a much steeper amr ( i.e. , they are more chemically enriched at a given age ) .",
    "a closed - box model would require a much higher yield to achieve such an amr . however , detailed studies of the milky way amr indicates that such a model is a poor representation of reality , and additional processes are required , such as pre - enrichment or infall ( e.g. , tinsley 1980 ) .",
    "some of the metal - poor milky way gcs deviate from the mean trend line to younger ages .",
    "these gcs typically lie at large galactocentric radii and have been classified as `` young halo '' gcs ( zinn 1993 ) .",
    "these gcs include : eridanus ( age = 8.4 gyrs , [ fe / h ] = @xmath44 , r@xmath45 = 95.2 kpc ) , pal 3 ( 9.2 , @xmath46 , 95.9 ) , pal 4 ( 9.2 , @xmath47 , 111.8 ) , and rup 106 ( 10.4 , @xmath48 , 18.5 ) .",
    "these , and other gcs with large galactocentric radii , have been suggested as prime candidates for accreted gcs by van den bergh ( 2000 ) .",
    "thus , fig .",
    "2 provides further circumstantial evidence that these gcs may have been accreted from tidally captured galaxies . if these ` young halo ' gcs and the canis major and sgr gcs are excluded from a milky way analysis , then the age spread of the salaris & weiss ( 2002 ) sample of metal - poor gcs is reduced from @xmath49 gyrs to @xmath50 gyr",
    "this would make any els - type collapse ( eggen , lyden - bell & sandage 1962 ) very rapid indeed .",
    "the existence of a size - galactocentric distance relation for milky way gcs suggests that the bulk of the system formed _ in situ _",
    "( van den bergh 1995 ) .",
    "this point holds because the half - mass radius of a gc ( unlike the core and tidal radii ) is expected to be largely unaffected by internal or external dynamical processes over a hubble time ( murray & lin 1992 ) , and any compact gcs at large galactocentric distances are likely to have survived to the present day ( ashman & zepf 1998 ) . in fig .",
    "3 we show the half - mass radius versus galactocentric distance for the canis major gcs compared to other milky way gcs . both quantities are taken from harris ( 1996 ) .",
    "the canis major gcs have relatively small half - mass radii for their galactocentric distance .",
    "this lends further support to their origin outside of the milky way .",
    "we note , however , that the sgr gcs span a large range in half - mass sizes .",
    "this suggests that a small range in gc sizes , while suggestive , is not a common feature of all dwarf gc systems .",
    "it is likely that the sgr and canis major dwarfs are not the only satellites accreted by our galaxy .",
    "there are good examples in other disk galaxies of _ accreting _ ( forbes  2003 ) and _ accreted _ ( ibata  2001 ) satellite galaxies that contribute to the build - up of galactic halos . for m31 , gas associated with an accreted satellite may have induced some new gc formation ( beasley  2004 ) .",
    "how significant are these accretions in the growth of a typical spiral galaxy and to which galactic component do they contribute ?",
    "martin  ( 2003 ) suggested that the canis major dwarf is a major building block of the milky way s thick disk .",
    "this interpretation fits in well with the simulations of abadi  ( 2003 ) , in which thick disks are the result of satellite accretions in the galactic plane .",
    "the thick disk gc system is traditionally thought to be a flattened , highly rotating system with a relatively high mean metallicity ( zinn 1985 ) . today the metal - rich gc system is often considered to be associated with the bulge of our galaxy ( minniti 1995 ) , and similarly for external galaxies ( forbes , brodie & larsen 2001 ) .",
    "however , the mean metallicity of the four canis major gcs identified by martin ( 2003 ) is [ fe / h ] = @xmath51 , i.e. consistent with the mean for the _ metal - poor _ gc system .",
    "even the highest metallicity gc , ngc  1851 , is still relatively metal - poor with [ fe / h ] = @xmath20 .",
    "such metallicities are not typical of thick disk / bulge gcs but are generally associated with halo gcs .",
    "futhermore , only one sgr gc ( pal  12 ) , and none of the five fornax dwarf gcs , have [ fe / h ] @xmath52 .",
    "this suggests that even when satellite accretions do add to the gc system of the milky way , such additions are unlikely to contribute significantly to a thick disk or bulge population of gcs .",
    "we note also that the alpha - element ratios of thick disk stars ( feltzing 2003 ) are generally super - solar and so _ not _ consistent with ( solar ratio ) stars found in local group dwarfs such as the sgr dwarf ( bonifacio 2004 ) .",
    "such solar abundance ratios indicate chemical enrichment over an extended time period , as suggested by the amrs for sgr and canis major ( see figures 1 and 2 ) .",
    "several studies have placed limits on the importance of dwarf galaxy accretion to the milky way s halo .",
    "based on studies of halo stars , van den bergh ( 2000 ) has argued that 37 sgr - like dwarf accretions may have occurred over the milky way s lifetime . by comparing halo star ages with those from dwarf galaxies , unavane , wyse & gilmore ( 1996 )",
    "have argued that only @xmath53 of the _ halo _ mass could have come from dwarfs .",
    "gilmore & wyse ( 1998 ) went on to examine the orbits of halo stars with alpha - element ratios that are similar to dwarf galaxy stars and concluded they were unlikely to have come from accreted dwarfs .",
    "the identification of globular clusters ( gcs ) with the accreted dwarf galaxies sgr and canis major has highlighted the fact that gc properties such as the horizontal branch morphology , prograde or retrograde orbits , range in cluster magnitudes , metallicity and galactocentric distance do not provide a unique signature of an accreted gc .",
    "we have examined the relation between half - mass size and galactocentric distance for the canis major gc system , finding that all of the associated gcs have smaller than average sizes .",
    "this suggests an origin outside of the milky way .    we have derived a simple closed - box age - metallicity relation that provides a good representation of the chemical enrichment history of the sgr and canis major dwarf galaxies",
    "this is consistent with formation of these gcs outside of the milky way .",
    "the model amr deviates from the milky way gc distribution at intermediate - to - high metallicities , thus providing an alternative and fairly robust method of identifying accreted metal - rich gcs within the milky way gc system .",
    "based on the literature age and metallicity measurements for the gc bh  176 , we argue it is unlikely to be a former member of the canis major galaxy .",
    "we support earlier suggestions that the younger , metal - poor milky way gcs are prime candidates for accreted gcs from as yet unidentified galaxies .",
    "this would reduce the gc age spread , at a given metallicity , to less than a gyr and imply that any halo collapse was very rapid .",
    "as the age - metallicity relation of the known accreted gcs is distinct from that of other milky way gcs for [ fe / h ] @xmath54 , it suggests that accretion was not a major factor in building the stellar mass of the thick disk or bulge . the majority of the milky way gc system and , by implication , the galaxy itself formed _ in situ_."
