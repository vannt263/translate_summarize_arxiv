    "now , we need to check whether the graph @xmath97 satisfies the conditions ( 1)-(3 ) of the theorem [ characterization ] .",
    "it is well - known that the properties ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) can be checked in polynomial time , so we will consider only the testing of ( 3 ) .    from a graph @xmath101 with a bipartition @xmath98",
    "we construct a network @xmath280 with new vertices @xmath281 and @xmath282 . the arcs of @xmath280 are defined as follows :    * connect @xmath281 to every vertex of @xmath275 with an arc of capacity @xmath103 ; * connect every vertex of @xmath276 to @xmath282 by an arc of capacity @xmath283 ; * for every edge @xmath284 , @xmath285 , @xmath100 add an arc connecting the vertex @xmath225 to the vertex @xmath223 which has capacity @xmath283 .    note that    * the value of the maximum @xmath286 flow in @xmath280 is no more than @xmath287 ( the capacity of the cut @xmath288 , where @xmath289 , @xmath290 , is @xmath291 ) ; * the value of the maximum @xmath286 flow in @xmath280 is @xmath291 if and only if the graph @xmath101 contains @xmath292 vertex disjoint @xmath103-paths ,    thus ( 3 ) also can be tested in polynomial time .",
    "recently monnot and toulouse in @xcite proved that @xmath103-path partition problem remains @xmath6-complete even for bipartite graphs of maximum degree three .",
    "fortunately , in theorem [ characterization ] we are dealing with a special case of this problem which enables us to present a polynomial algorithm in corollary [ polynomialalgorithm ] .",
    "the reader may think that a result analogous to corollary [ polynomialalgorithm ] can be proved for the property @xmath7 in the class of graphs containing a perfect matching .",
    "unfortunately this fails already in the class of bridgeless cubic graphs , which by the well - known theorem of petersen are known to possess a perfect matching .      clearly , the problem of testing the property @xmath7 for graphs containing a perfect matching is in @xmath6 , since if we are given perfect matchings @xmath50 of the graph @xmath0 with @xmath293 @xmath52 then we can calculate @xmath1 and @xmath2 in polynomial time .",
    "let @xmath0 be a bridgeless cubic graph .",
    "consider a bridgeless cubic graph @xmath294 obtained from @xmath0 by replacing every vertex of @xmath0 by a triangle .",
    "we claim that @xmath0 is @xmath24-edge - colorable if and only if @xmath295 .",
    "suppose that @xmath0 is @xmath24-edge - colorable .",
    "then @xmath294 is also @xmath296-edge - colorable , which means that @xmath294 contains two edge disjoint perfect matchings @xmath41 and @xmath297 .",
    "this implies that @xmath298on the other hand , the set @xmath9 forms a perfect matching of @xmath294 , and @xmath299since every component of @xmath300 is a triangle .",
    "thus : @xmath301(d ) of theorem [ ratios ] implies that @xmath302 .",
    "now assume that @xmath302 .",
    "note that for every perfect matching @xmath41 of the graph @xmath294 the graph @xmath303 is a 2-factor , therefore @xmath304where @xmath305 and @xmath306 denote the minimum and maximum number of odd cycles in a @xmath103-factor of @xmath294 , respectively .",
    "since @xmath302 we have @xmath307taking into account that @xmath308 , we have : @xmath309note that @xmath310 means that @xmath294 is @xmath24-edge - colorable , which in its turn implies that @xmath0 is @xmath24-edge - colorable . the proof of the theorem is completed ."
