    ", correlated hopping can be the dominant source of kinetic energy . in a mean - field analysis , it has been shown that such purely kinetic terms favor the existence of a new pairing phase which shows a molecular condensate ( @xmath0 ) without single - particle condensation @xmath1@xcite .",
    "similar phases have been discussed in atomic physics in the context of ultracold atoms@xcite . in particular , a continuous transition from an atomic to a molecular condensate is of interest since it would be a realization of an ising transition between two different superfluid phases .",
    "this quantum phase transition has to be contrasted with the smooth bec - bcs crossover as e.g. in an atomic fermi gas . here",
    "both phases can be distinguished by their symmetry . in a standard superfluid",
    "the @xmath2 symmetry is completely broken while in a paired superfluid a residual discrete @xmath3 symmetry remains .",
    "evidence beyond mean - field for the existence of such a paired superfluid ( psf ) is still lacking however , and its detailed physical properties and the quantum phase transitions out of such a phase remain to be understood . in this work",

    "the model maps to the heisenberg model .",
    "away from half filling , a large negative or positive chemical potential leads either to an empty or a full system .",

    "mean field theory targeting a homogeneous solution predicts a phase transition between a standard sf with single - boson condensation and an exotic psf with boson - pair condensation for large enough correlated hopping@xcite .",
    "indeed , the basic physical effect of the correlated hopping is to act as a binding mechanism for bosons .",
    "this however opens the possibility that the system undergoes ps , similar to bosonic ring - exchange models  @xcite .",
    "we will show in this work that this is indeed the case .",
    "the role of the nearest - neighbor repulsion is therefore crucial .",
    "we propose the following scenario .",
    "the system displays ps if the nearest - neighbor repulsion is small . on intermediate scales of the repulsion the ps",
    "is significantly reduced and the boson - pair condensation region is stabilized . note that this is different for bosonic ring - exchange models where a finite repulsion only gives rise to a standard sf@xcite . for large repulsion",

    "the three different phases sf , psf , and ps can then be characterized by the way in which the total particle number @xmath26 changes upon changing the chemical potential with @xmath27 , @xmath28 , or @xmath29 respectively . typical curves of the total number of particles @xmath23 as a function of @xmath7 are shown in the insets of fig .",

    "are destroyed and a standard sf at low density is realized .",
    "note also the appearance of yet another region of phase separation around densities of @xmath33 for @xmath21 .",
    "this region of ps is related to the first order transition out of the checkerboard solid reported in ref .  [ ] . at intermediate repulsions ,",

    "still a region of ps remains between the psf and the sf , leading to a region of excluded densities between the two stable phases . at the even larger value of @xmath21 , ( fig .",
    "[ pd]c ) the ps is completely suppressed , while a reduced region is maintained where the psf is stable .",
    "the major outcome of the phase diagram for the finite clusters is that the psf is indeed realized in a small window of finite nearest - neighbor repulsion and at low densities . in the following",
    "we will study the dilute low - density limit in order to see whether we get a consistent physical picture .",
    "we therefore calculated the ground state energies @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 for a @xmath37 cluster is a square sample where the edges are spanned by the vector ( 7,3 ) ] cluster with one , two and four particles , and form the two and four particle binding energies @xmath38 and @xmath39 . we attribute a bound state of four particles @xmath40 to a precursor of ps , a bound state of two particles @xmath41 corresponds to the psf , and the case of no bound states @xmath42 corresponds to the sf phase , in analogy to the binding of hole - pairs in the 2d @xmath43 model @xcite . in fig .",

    "but the psf can be stabilized by finite @xmath10 at large correlated hopping . for @xmath44 ,",
    "a pair of nearest - neighbor bosons hops on an effective square lattice with amplitude @xmath12 , and the pair can gain at most a kinetic energy of @xmath45 equal to half the band - width .",
    "so the boundary at @xmath46 for @xmath47 is an exact result .    up to now",
    "we have only discussed energies and densities , which provided evidence in favor of the presence of a region in the phase diagram where the bosons form pairs . yet",

    "let us consider first @xmath57 .",
    "for any phase without a usual single - boson condensate all large distance two - point correlations are generically exponentially suppressed , i.e. all entries in @xmath57 with @xmath71 are very small and the matrix has only a finite number of sizable entries for fixed @xmath72 . in the limit of no correlations when @xmath73 , one has a diagonal matrix with maximum eigenvalue of order @xmath74 .",
    "in contrast , for a standard sf one has long - range two - point correlation functions and _ all _ entries of @xmath57 are of the same order . for the case where all correlations are exactly the same , one can easily convince oneself that the maximum eigenvalue is of the order @xmath51 .",
    "the behavior of @xmath66 is more complex . for the case of no single - boson _ and _ no boson - pair condensate all four - point correlations are suppressed exponentially and one again obtains in complete analogy a maximum eigenvalue of order @xmath74 . for the standard",
    "sf all four - point correlation functions are long - ranged since the four - point correlators contain always two - point correlation functions , i.e. _ all _ entries of @xmath66 are of the same order and the maximum eigenvalue @xmath48 is of order @xmath75 .",
    "the psf has suppressed two - point correlation functions and simultaneously long - range correlations between two boson pairs .",
    "therefore all entries involving large distances are basically zero except the ones where two distances @xmath76 and @xmath77 ( or the other combination of indices ) are within a pairing length .",
    "this gives a maximum eigenvalue @xmath48 of order @xmath51 . in this way one can either have long - range order of single bosons or long - range order of boson pairs .",
    "it does not make sense to speak about ordering in both channels simultaneously since a condensate of single bosons is automatically accompanied by a pair condensate .    in order to compare the behavior of @xmath64 and @xmath48 for the different phases , we concentrate on systems with an even number of bosons at constant and low densities . since we are limited by the size of the considered systems we use the following procedure to characterize @xmath64 and @xmath48 .",
    "we consider the maximum eigenvalues @xmath64 and @xmath48 as a function of @xmath51 and @xmath23 where we restrict @xmath23 to be even .",
    "using a linear interpolation between the calculated points we obtain the maximum eigenvalues @xmath78 and @xmath79 as a function of @xmath51 for a constant density . the resulting data for @xmath49,@xmath50 , and the extreme cases @xmath80 are shown in the upper panels of fig .",
    "[ eigen ] .",
    "then we fit the functions @xmath81 with @xmath82 .",

    "this is nicely reflected in the displayed exponents .",
    "@xmath54 is close to the expected value of @xmath74 and @xmath55 is close to the value of @xmath85 .",
    "deviations are presumably due to finite size effects .",
    "it can be clearly seen that these ratios change drastically in the regime of large correlated hopping .",
    "the deviations are strongest for @xmath86 . here",
    "one obtains @xmath87 and @xmath88 , i.e. values which are close to the expected values for the psf . in the intermediate @xmath9-regime where one has ps no particular exponents",

    "the investigation of the maximum eigenvalues of @xmath65 and @xmath66 yields therefore additional evidence for the presence of the psf for large @xmath9 at low densities , i.e.  the system realizes a stable condensate of boson pairs .",
    "in this section we exploit the results obtained by qmc and we complement the physical picture deduced from the ed results , i.e.  we will establish the existence of the psf in a finite window for finite nearest - neighbor repulsion .",
    "the second part of this section will address the question of possible phase transitions out of the psf .",
    "the model under study does not suffer from a sign problem and is therefore accessible to quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) techniques .",
    "however , the treatment of three - site terms is not standard . we will use a sse algorithm@xcite to tackle the problem as it has been shown to be able to treat multi - site terms@xcite .",
    "some details of the algorithm and its implementation are given in the appendix .",
    "we start the discussion about the sse results by important comments on the numerical efficiency of the one - worm sse algorithm for the case of the pairing phase .",
    "a basic property of the psf are exponentially decaying two - point correlation functions . since typical worm algorithms",
    "are based on the insertion of two discontinuities into the system which propagate in an extended configuration space@xcite ( relevant for measuring two - point correlation functions ) , the worm updates in space and time are short - ranged .",
    "normally , this does not cause a problem because the single - boson sf becomes unstable to insulating phases which have short ranged green s functions like charge - ordered states . for the psf",
    "this is different .",
    "it is a long - range ordered phase with short range two - point correlation functions .",
    "the very nature of the psf itself therefore leads to intrinsic algorithmic problems for single worm updates .",
    "nevertheless , we believe that a certain number of important observations can be made .",
    "the stiffness of a sf phase is determined in sse by measuring the winding number@xcite .",
    "if a macroscopic fraction of the particles winds around the system , the system acquires a finite stiffness .",
    "the sse algorithm uses a starting configuration with fixed zero winding number . in the single - boson",
    "sf the worm algorithm is efficient and the algorithm is able to let a large number of bosons to wind around the system . in the psf",
    "however , we generically expect pairs of bosons to wind around the system .",
    "this expectation is indeed confirmed by sse simulations on small systems , where winding number histograms show a very clear even - odd effect , i.e. only even winding numbers occur .",
    "but the accumulation of a large number of winding bosons pairs is exponentially suppressed by the short range nature of the single worm updates in the psf .",
    "the higher winding numbers and therefore the stiffness are not well explored in the psf , based on the present worm update scheme .",
    "we are currently working on two - worm update schemes which should improve the efficiency of the algorithm in the psf@xcite .",
    "in contrast to the winding number , the density of the system can be randomly set in the starting configuration .",
    "it is therefore possible to use for a given parameter set a large number of different seeds and average over the different runs . in this way one has access to the total density and also to density histograms .",
    "the latter counts how many times a system with a certain total number of bosons is realized .",
    "one expects a pronounced even / odd effect in the psf which should be absent for a standard sf .",
    "the third quantity we focus on is the equal - time one - particle green s function @xmath89 .",
    "we expect that these correlations are exponentially decaying in the psf , due to the pairing gap , while they are long - ranged in the conventional sf .",
    "based on the ed results we expect that the psf is realized at low densities for large correlated hopping and at corresponding values of the nearest - neighbor repulsion . in the following",
    ", we will concentrate on two parameter sets : @xmath90 , @xmath91 , and @xmath20 on one hand , and @xmath92 , @xmath93 , and @xmath21 on the other hand . in the first case we expect the psf at low densities to be separated from the standard sf by an excluded density region of ps . for the second parameter set ed results predict the psf at low densities with possibly a direct transition to the standard sf . in the following",

    "let us briefly summarize our characterization of the large @xmath12 , low density phase .",
    "whenever we have only a fluctuating even number of bosons in the system and when we observe simultaneously exponentially decaying one - particle correlations , it is natural to conjecture that we are in presence of a paired superfluid phase . of course , on the basis of these quantum monte carlo results alone",
    ", we can not exclude the possibility of a paired phase with vanishing stiffness since we presently have no direct access to this quantity , but this seems unlikely on the basis of the results of the previous section : the size scaling @xmath70 strongly suggests pair off - diagonal long - range order .",
    "besides , an insulating behaviour can be excluded since it would be easily detected as plateaux in the density as a function of the chemical potential , which are clearly not present in the quantum monte carlo data .",
    "so altogether the existence of a psf seems to be on solid grounds .",
    "a second important issue is the nature of possible quantum phase transitions out of such an unconventional psf .",
    "we remind the reader that the two superfluid phases ( sf and psf ) have distinct symmetries enabling the possibility of a true quantum phase transition between them .",
    "so the transition between the psf and the sf can be either a first order transition , or a second order transition in the ising universality class@xcite .",
    "the available data are not sufficient to answer this question in a rigorous fashion .",
    "this is mainly due to the above - mentioned intrinsic algorithmic problems of the worm updates . besides , to decide between a weakly first order and a second order transition is numerically hard",
    "nevertheless , important trends can be deduced .",
    "let us first discuss the case @xmath90 , @xmath95 , and @xmath20 .",
    "results for this parameter set are shown in fig .",
    "[ nvsmu_1 ] and fig .",
    "[ histo_n_1 ] .",
    "ed predicts a first order transition between the two superfluid phases .",
    "a first order transition at zero temperature corresponds to a jump of the total density as a function of the chemical potential .",
    "the finite temperature nature of the sse results will smear out this jump slightly .",
    "indeed , the sse data in fig .  [ nvsmu_1 ] display a rather sharp dependence of the density as function of the chemical potential close to @xmath105 as expected from the ed data . additionally , the density histogram in fig .",
    "[ histo_n_1 ] displays a finite - temperature coexistence region ( coex ) of the typical behavior of both superfluids near @xmath105 : there is a gaussian with only even particle number at lower densities characteristic for the psf and a second gaussian with even and odd particle number at higher density representing a standard single - boson sf .",
    "it is therefore likely that the transition for this parameter set is first order .",
    "ed predicts a continuous transition for the second parameter set @xmath92 , @xmath24 , and @xmath21 .",
    "the corresponding results are shown in fig .",
    "[ nvsmu_1 ] and fig .",
    "[ histo_n_1 ] . indeed , the density as a function of the chemical potential displays a much smoother behavior as shown in fig .",
    "[ nvsmu_2 ] . a clear jump is not visible but one can identify an inflection point close to @xmath106 signaling a change of phase .",
    "the same trend can be seen in the density histogram in fig .",
    "[ histo_n_2 ] .",
    "there is a rather smooth evolution of the density histogram from the psf to the sf .",
    "but the numerical data are not sufficient to decide whether a weakly first order ( existence of a tiny coexistence region ) or a second order transition between the two superfluids is present .",
    "it is likely that the second order transition is only realized ( if at all ) in a narrow window for large enough values of the nearest - neighbor repulsion .",
    "in this work we studied a model of hard - core bosons on the square lattice with correlated hopping .",
    "we used ed and sse simulations to establish the existence of an unconventional phase of condensed boson pairs at zero temperature . in the psf two - point correlations",
    "are short ranged while there is long - range order in the four - point correlations . in other words",
    "the bosons form stable molecular pairs which condense .",
    "we found that a finite nearest - neighbor repulsion is crucial for such a phase .",
    "the correlated hopping acts as an attractive force between the bosons . as a consequence ,",
    "the system is unstable against ps for small nearest - neighbor repulsion . a macroscopic part of the bosons glue together . in the opposite limit of large repulsion",
    "all bound states between the bosons are destroyed and a standard sf is realized .",
    "but the major outcome of this work is that there is a finite window of nearest - neigbour repulsion where the formation of a condensate of paired bosons is stabilized .",
    "the nearest - neighbor repulsion is large enough to destroy the ps but it is small enough not to destroy the boson pairs .",
    "a second important aspect is the nature of the phase transition out of the psf .",
    "this can be either of first or second order .",
    "clearly , the realization of a continuous transition would be of great interest since it is expected to be in the ising universality class .",
    "the detailed nature of the transition at zero but also at finite temperature is an open issue and can be studied microscopically in our model with correlated hopping .",

    "but it is likely that the continuous transition is only realized at large values of the nearest - neighbor repulsion .",
    "when the repulsion is too small , the transition is probably first order .    in conclusion",
    ", we have established in this work the existence of an unconventional pairing phase of hard - core bosons in a microscopic model with correlated hopping .",
    "we have seen that current sse simulations based on worm updates are not efficient in a phase of boson - pair condensation .",
    "the development of updates schemes bases on two worms are currently under study@xcite and should enable the clarification of the nature of the phase transitions out of this exotic phase at zero and at finite temperature .",
    "we thank f. alet , r. bendjama , h.p .",
    "bchler , b. kumar and l. pollet for stimulating discussions .",
    "the sse simulations were done using the alps libraries@xcite .",
    "we also acknowledge the swiss national funds and the manep for financial support and the cscs ( manno ) for allocation of computing time on the cray xt3 .",
    "in this appendix we mention some technical points allowing the reader to follow the numerical implementation of the problem . for some introductory literature on sse",
    "we refer to ref .",
    "the sse simulations were done using a modified version of the alps sse code  @xcite based on the alps libraries@xcite .",
    "conventionally , sse algorithms use bond terms as basic building blocks .",
    "the presence of three - site terms demands a larger building block .",
    "we have chosen as basic objects of our problem operators acting on a plaquette of the square lattice@xcite . in the following",
    "we denote the four sites of one plaquette @xmath6 , @xmath72 , @xmath107 , and @xmath108 in anti - clockwise direction putting the first site in the left lower corner .",
    "we have three classes of vertices .",
    "first , there are diagonal vertices @xmath109\\\\\\nonumber   & & -\\frac{v}{2}\\left [ n_i n_j i_{kl}+ n_j n_k i_{il}+ n_k n_l i_{ij}+ n_l n_i i_{kj}\\right]\\quad . \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath110 is a constant which has to be adjusted such that all diagonal contributions are not negative , i.e. that there is no sign problem .",
    "second , there are bond vertices @xmath111 where @xmath112 .",
    "third , we have vertices originating from the correlated hopping @xmath113 a second important issue is the choice of the updates . beside standard diagonal updates",
    "we use directed loop updates .",
    "the determination of the travel probabilities of the two discontinuities in order to fulfill detailed balance for the created directed loops is a non - trivial problem .",
    "a successfull strategy is to minimize the bounce probabilities having in mind that one wants to create large directed loops .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , one can write down a solution which minimizes the bounce amplitudes .",
    "the bounce processes are only non - zero in a parameter regime where one term in the hamiltonian dominates the other terms . in all other cases ,",
    "the maximum weight does not dominates the other weights , and bounce free solutions can be obtained@xcite .",

    "<S> while for non interacting hard - core bosons the effective attraction induced by the correlated hopping leads to phase separation at low density , we show that a modest nearest - neighbor repulsion suppresses phase separation , leading to a remarkable low - density pairing phase with no single particle bose - einstein condensation but long - range two - particle correlations , signaling a condensation of pairs . </S>",
