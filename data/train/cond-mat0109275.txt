    "the 4@xmath04 * * _ k_**@xmath1*_p _ * hole hamiltonian for the wave function envelopes ( so called effective - mass hamiltonian ) , that takes into account mixing of the light- and heavy - hole bands , was obtained in ref .   using the perturbation theory .",
    "this multiband hamiltonian has been employed for description of the hole states in bulk crystals@xcite as well as in low - dimensional structures , in particular , in free - standing homogeneous quantum dots ( qds)@xcite . the inclusion of the mixing with the spin - orbit split - off hole band leads to the 6@xmath06 * * _ k_**@xmath1*_p _ * hamiltonian which has also been applied@xcite to qds . to consider the nonparabolicity of the electron dispersion in narrow- and medium - gap semiconductors , it is necessary to take into account the coupling of the conduction and valence bands . using the * * _ k_**@xmath1*_p _ * perturbation theory for bulk semiconductors with cubic lattice symmetry , the 8@xmath08 * * _ k_**@xmath1*_p _ * model was developed in ref .  .",
    "this model explicitly includes eight bands around the @xmath2 point of the brillouin zone , namely , electron , heavy- , light- , and spin - orbit split - off hole bands ( each of them is twice - degenerate due to the spin ) , and treats all other bands as remote . along with more simple models , the 8@xmath08 * * _ k_**@xmath1*_p _ *",
    "hamiltonian has been used to investigate different qds ( see , e.  g. refs .  ) .",
    "recently , one has begun to apply multiband effective - mass hamiltonians to investigate elastic , electronic , and optical properties of multilayer nanostructures such as quantum - dot heterostructures ( qdhs ) : cds / hgs@xcite , inas / gaas@xcite , gaas / al@xmath3ga@xmath4as@xcite , and cds / hgs / cds / h@xmath5o@xcite .",
    "however , it should be emphasized , that multiband * * _ k_**@xmath1*_p _ * hamiltonians are derived for homogeneous bulk materials , i.e. under the assumption that all effective - mass parameters are _",
    "constant_. this is important , because at a certain step of the derivation , wavenumbers @xmath6 are declared as operators @xmath7 that do not commute with the functions of coordinates .",
    "but , at the heterointerfaces of the multilayer nanostructures , there occurs an abrupt change of effective - mass parameters from their values in one material to those in the adjacent material . inside a thin transitional layer that contains the heterointerface , the ordering of the differential operators and coordinate - dependent effective - mass parameters in the multiband hamiltonian becomes crucial . in qds with an",
    "infinitely high confining potential for electrons and holes , all components of the wave function vanish at the heterointerface , and there remains a possibility of applying the bulk multiband * * _ k_**@xmath1*_p _ * hamiltonian straightforwardly .",
    "@xcite there are two ways to proceed from qds to qdhs .",
    "\\(i ) the first way is to use an appropriate bulk multiband hamiltonian for each constituent material separately , and then to match the obtained homogeneous solutions at the abrupt heterojunctions applying the _ connection rules _ ( crs ) that are usually obtained by imposing the continuity of the wave function envelopes and of the normal to the heterointerface component of the velocity.@xcite it should be underlined that this way is heuristic and nonunique . in ref .",
    "the general crs , that even do not require the continuity of the wave function envelopes , have been proposed for planar heterostructures .",
    "\\(ii ) the second way ( cf .",
    "refs . ) is to derive a multiband hamiltonian valid for the entire heterostructure , including the heterointerfaces , and then , if material parameters change abruptly at some interfaces , to find the _ boundary conditions _ ( bcs ) for the solutions of the envelope function equation . to find these bcs",
    ", one should use the multiband envelope function equation @xmath8 at any point of the heterostructure , including the heterointerfaces , and integrate this equation over the volume of an infinitely thin layer , which includes the considered heterointerface .",
    "thus , the bcs are derived starting from the requirement of continuity of the components of the wave function at the heterointerface",
    ".    one can always choose the crs physically equivalent to the bcs.@xcite the both approaches ( i ) and ( ii ) are usually used when the wave function inside each layer of a heterostructure can be found analytically , for example in planar or spherical heterostructures . in case of an arbitrary shape of the heterointerface , the approach ( ii ) can still be used because , when the hamiltonian is known for the entire heterostructure , one can find an overall numerical solution of the schrdinger equation .    a commonly used heuristic method to obtain a multiband effective - mass hamiltonian for heterostructures uses symmetrization@xcite of the corresponding * * _ k_**@xmath1*_p _ * hamiltonian .",
    "this method consists in the symmetrical arrangement of the components of the momentum operator , that ensures the hermicity of the resulting hamiltonian .",
    "namely @xmath9 and @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is a spatially varying effective - mass or other material - dependent parameter which is usually considered a piece - wise constant , because in each layer of a heterostructure it has the value for a corresponding bulk material .",
    "the symmetrization has been applied to qdhs in refs .  .",
    "an essential fault of the symmetrization is that it is not a _ necessary _ condition for the multiband hamiltonian to be hermitian . besides that ,",
    "as will be seen below , some intrinsic properties of the heterointerface , such as reducing the symmetry of the problem and smoothing the abrupt change of the effective - mass parameters at a heterojunction , are completely neglected in the symmetrized hamiltonian .",
    "burt has derived@xcite the exact envelope - function equations for a heterostructure .",
    "the order of the components of the momentum operator arises as a part of that derivation .",
    "this theory has been used by foreman to explicitly write the 6@xmath06 ( ref . ) and 8@xmath08 ( ref . )",
    "effective - mass hamiltonians for planar heterostructures .",
    "general rules for constructing the valence - band effective - mass hamiltonians with a correct operator ordering have been described in ref .   for the heterostructures with arbitrary crystallographic orientations . in ref .",
    ", correct boundary conditions for planar heterostructures with wurtzite symmetry have been presented . comparing the conduction- and valence - subband dispersion of a planar quantum well ,",
    "calculated using the bcs following from the exact nonsymmetrized and from the symmetrized effective - mass hamiltonians , it has been shown that the former bcs give physically reasonable results , while the latter bcs can produce nonphysical solutions.@xcite more recently , these two sets of bcs for a planar quantum well have been examined within the tight - binding approach.@xcite the result of the comparison allowed to give preference to the nonsymmetrized model resulting from burt s derivation of the envelope - function hamiltonian , which was shown to give reliable results even when the well and barrier effective - mass parameters were very dissimilar .    in the present paper the envelope - function representation of refs .",

    "the electronic structure of two - layer hgs / cds , inas / gaas , and gaas / alas spherical qdhs is investigated as a function of the dot radius .",
    "it should be mentioned that the _ spurious solutions _ ( `` oscillating''@xcite states and `` gap '' states@xcite ) did not become apparent in the aforementioned qdhs .",

    "the radial cb hamiltonian @xmath305 for spherical qdhs can be derived from the hamiltonian ( [ 22h ] ) by the same way as the radial hamiltonian ( [ hjp ] ) has been obtained from the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) in the spherical approximation ( see sec .",
    "thus we find @xmath306 where @xmath307 and the operator @xmath308 is defined by eq .",
    "( [ delta ] ) . inside the @xmath309-th spherical layer",
    ", the hamiltonian ( [ elh ] ) takes the form @xmath310 where @xmath311 is the spherical laplacian and @xmath312 is the energy - dependent cb mass of the @xmath309-th material .",
    "further , one should solve the schrdinger equation with the hamiltonian ( [ elhi ] ) for each spherical layer and match the obtained solutions at the spherical heterointerfaces using the bcs ( [ new ] ) ( see sec .",
    "the radial component of the cb current operator @xmath313 is obtained from the hamiltonian ( [ elh ] ) by the same way as the radial component of the current operator ( [ bc ] ) has been obtained from the hamiltonian ( [ hjp ] ) .",
    "thus , @xmath314    in a two - layer spherical qdh the electron energy depends on the difference @xmath315 ( as seen from the bcs ( [ new ] ) , ( [ je ] ) ) , where the indices `` 1 '' and `` 2 '' denote the interior and exterior materials , correspondingly .",
    "the value of this difference is usually very small for typical qdhs .",
    "therefore , in the first approximation , one can find the energy spectrum @xmath316 ( @xmath317 ) neglecting the term proportional to @xmath318 in the bcs .",
    "then , including this term as a perturbation , one finds the energy spectrum @xmath319 .",
    "it is seen that the energy levels with @xmath320 remain unchanged , while each energy level @xmath316 with @xmath321 splits into two levels : @xmath322 and @xmath323 . for the electron levels that are not very close to the cb minimum ( it is the case for the qdhs under consideration )",
    ", the following estimate can be obtained @xmath324 where @xmath325 . in table",
    "[ table ] we have used eq .",
    "( [ estimate ] ) to estimate the spin - orbit splitting of the lowest @xmath256 and @xmath326 levels .",
    "it is seen that the value of the splitting of the electron levels is of the order of 3  mev in all considered qdhs , and therefore this splitting can be neglected .",
    "this fact does not imply that the dependence of the parameters of the cb hamiltonian on the energy can be neglected , too . as seen from table  [ table ] , the electron effective masses in qdhs can differ by a factor of 2 from their values in the corresponding bulk materials .",
    "the deduction of the vb hamiltonian is analogous to the deduction of the cb hamiltonian with the only difference : one should treat two cbs as remote . in order to express the cb envelopes @xmath275 and @xmath289 in terms of the vb envelopes @xmath278 , ",
    ", @xmath276 and to exclude them from the schrdinger equation ( [ se ] ) , one should apply the approximation @xmath327 and @xmath328 .",
    "this approximation has the same grounds as the approximation used above to obtain the cb hamiltonian .",
    "now , we express the cb envelopes @xmath275 and @xmath289 in terms of the vb envelopes @xmath278 ,  , @xmath276 from the first two equations of the set ( [ se ] ) and substitute them into the last six equations of the same set . as a result",
    "we have the vb hamiltonian @xmath329 , which coincides with the hamiltonian @xmath87 ( see eq .",

    "( [ chidef ] ) , one should change the parameter of dissymmetry @xmath25 as follows @xmath332 as a result of the change ( [ chil ] ) , the parameter of dissymmetry increases ( see table  [ table ] ) , therefore the results of the symmetrized hamiltonian ( with @xmath333 ) will deviate sharply from the exact solutions .",
    "the parameters @xmath118 usually weakly depend on the energy . consequently , to obtain the hole spectrum one can use the hamiltonian @xmath334 , where @xmath301 is an average hole energy .      the radial vb hamiltonian @xmath335 for a spherical qdh coincides with the radial hamiltonian ( [ hjp ] ) in which @xmath336 and @xmath337 ( in conformity with eqs .
