    "cp violation may also exist in the lepton sector .",
    "one of the ways to describe low energy cp violation in this sector is to have cp violating dirac phase @xmath5 in the pontcove - mkai - nagawa - sakata ( pmns ) mixing matrix  @xcite .",

    "lee is that cp is spontaneously violated  @xcite .",
    "the popular weinberg model  @xcite of spontaneous cp violation model has problems  @xcite with data and has been decisively ruled out by cp violating measurement in b decays  @xcite . in a previous work",
    ", we have studied the possibility of restoring the idea that cp is broken spontaneously and identifying the phase @xmath4 , up to a sign , as the phase @xmath6 that causes spontaneous cp violation in the higgs potential  @xcite . in this work",
    "we generalize this approach to the lepton sector to study how cp violating phase @xmath5 may be identified with the phase @xmath7 , and some of the consequences .",
    "a model to realize the above idea for quark sector has been studied in ref .",
    "it involves multi - higgs fields . in that work , in order to avoid possible strong cp problem a peccei - quinn symmetry  @xcite is imposed to the model  @xcite . implementing spontaneous cp violation with pq symmetry then requires more than two higgs doublets  @xcite . for our purpose",
    "we find that in order to have spontaneous cp violation with pq symmetry at least three higgs doublets @xmath8 and one complex higgs singlet @xmath9 are needed .",
    "the higgs singlet with a large vacuum expectation value ( vev ) renders the axion from pq symmetry breaking to be invisible  @xcite , thus satisfying experimental constraints on axion couplings to fermions .",
    "two possible ways of assigning pq charges to the quarks and higgs bosons were considered  @xcite , @xmath10 in both cases , @xmath11 has pq charge @xmath12 .    with these pq charge assignments , it is possible to have spontaneous cp violation with a non - zero phase of vevs , @xmath13 .",

    "if @xmath26 ( or @xmath27 ) can always be written as a sum of two terms with a relative phase , then the phase in the ckm matrix can be identified with the phase @xmath6 .",
    "since multi - higgs bosons are involved , there are in general flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) interactions mediated by neutral higgs bosons at the tree level .",
    "however , unlike in general multi - higgs models , the fcnc yukawa couplings are fixed in terms of the quark masses , ckm mixing angles , and vacuum expectation values @xmath28 of higgs bosons making phenomenological studies much easier and having different predictions than general multi - higgs models  @xcite . in the following we will study how the same idea can be applied to lepton sector and related implications .",
    "there are some complications for a straightforward generalization of the idea discussed in the previous section to lepton sector because neutrinos may be majorana type .",
