    "nowadays inflation is a widely accepted element of the early cosmology @xcite .",
    "it gives the possibility of solving many of the shortcomings of the standard hot big bang model and provides the source for the early energy density fluctuations responsible of the large scale structure of the universe observed today .",
    "although there are many models of inflation , the underlying physical ideas are well established .",
    "these are characterized by a period of `` slow roll '' evolution of a scalar field ( called inflaton ) toward the vacuum potential . during this period the field changes very slowly , so that the kinetic energy @xmath0 remains smaller than its potential energy @xmath1 . the energy density associated to the scalar field acts as a `` cosmological constant '' term , allowing a period of quasi exponential expansion of the scale factor . when the period of inflation ends , the scalar field @xmath2 start a phase of rapid coherent oscillations around the vacuum .    very recently",
    "( @xcite ) it has been pointed out that inflation can persist during the coherent oscillations of the inflation field phase .",
    "this exciting result is possible when the inflaton potential verifies a simple constrain of curvature far from the core convex part , where the inflaton field can roll slowly .",
    "the efficiency of this phenomena could have important implications for  gut scale baryogenesis @xcite .",
    "in fact , as suggested by damour and mukhanov ( @xcite),it can be expected that due to the increase of the oscillation frequency , there is the possibility to generate massive particles heavier than @xmath3 .    in ref.@xcite damour and mukhanov estimated the amount of inflation to be @xmath4 e - fold ( powers of the scale factor ) .",
    "they argue that this effect can be more efficient than the parametric resonance effect @xcite for the amplification of cosmological perturbations @xcite .  in ref.@xcite liddle and",
    "mazumdar showed that mukhanov et al . overestimated the number of e - fold because they have used a slow - roll definition of this object .",
    "in their paper , liddle and mazumdar found an analytical expression for the number of e - fold of inflation using the appropriate definition finding a number of @xmath5 e - fold concluding that this effect is not very efficient .",
    "the study of adiabatic perturbations in this phase has been made by taruya @xcite .",
    "he found a poor amplification in the case of a single scalar field model but anticipated an enormous amplification for multi - field systems .    in this letter",
    "we review the problem .",
    "in particular we find that the analytical expressions used to compare with the numerical estimation are not well defined in the @xmath6 region and propose a way to correct these analytical estimations .",
    "furthermore , with this result we study the evolution of the scalar field finding total agreement with the conclusions of ref.@xcite for @xmath7 , but a remarkable different result for small @xmath8 .",
    "for this region , the initial conditions are very important .",
    "we find that @xmath6 gives the leading contribution for oscillating inflation and the dominant part in the amplification of the fluctuations .",
    "the letter is organized as follow ; first we describe briefly the damour - mukhanov model .",
    "then , we make some comments about the initial conditions for this phenomenon and later we propose an improved expression , valid for the leading region of @xmath8 , which is our main contribution .",
    "now we shall restrict ourselves to models of inflation driven by a single scalar field .",
    "the equations are @xmath9    @xmath10    here @xmath11 is the hubble parameter , @xmath12 is the scale factor of the universe and @xmath13 with @xmath14 the planck mass . during the oscillatory phase of @xmath2 we have two time scales ; the inverse of the frequency @xmath15 of oscillations of @xmath2 and the inverse of the rate of expansion @xmath16 . if the limit @xmath17 is taken we can neglect terms proportional to @xmath18 in the equations . so from ( 1 ) we can integrate to obtain , @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the maximum value of @xmath1 in each oscillation when the field reaches the maximum value @xmath21 . from this relation",
    "we obtain the period of a single oscillation , @xmath22 ^{\\frac{1}{2}}.$]when @xmath23 we can define an adiabatic average index @xmath24 by @xmath25where the bracket means @xmath26 .",
    "equations ( 1,2 ) can be re - written in the fluid form @xmath27    @xmath28    then from the definition of @xmath29 and eqns.([ec3],[ec4 ] ) we have several ways to compute the adiabatic index @xmath30 because @xmath31 and ( [ ec4 ] ) we have a superluminal expansion @xmath32 when @xmath33 . from the last two relations in eqn.([g ] )",
    "the inequality @xmath33 leads to @xmath34",
    "until now everything has been done for an arbitrary potential , but from now on we shall consider the potential @xmath35 ,   \\label{pot}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is a dimensionless parameter , @xmath36mass@xmath37^{4}$ ] is a constant and @xmath38mass@xmath37 $ ] determines the size of the convex core of @xmath39 . we assume for a while that @xmath40 marks the end of _ oscillating inflation_. the analysis made in ref.@xcite works well far from the core of the potential .",
    "further , the limit @xmath41 of eqn.([pot ] ) was written as : @xmath42 in this case , the adiabatic index can be computed exactly given @xcite by @xmath43 so , from the inequality @xmath33 we note that to hold inflation during the oscillatory phase we must have @xmath44 . by using eqn.([gama ] ) in eqn.([ec3 ] ) we obtain @xmath45 and together with eqn.([ec2 ] ) we have @xmath46 @xmath47 @xmath48 where @xmath21 is the amplitude of the oscillations , @xmath49 and @xmath50 is a typical value of @xmath2 at the end of slow - roll inflation and the beginning of oscillating inflation . to compute the number of e - fold of inflation during oscillating inflation",
    "we can not use the standard expression @xmath51 , appropriate for the slow - roll stage , but the improved expression proposed in ref.@xcite @xmath52 because in each oscillation , while the field spends time in the core region , the universe continue their expansion so @xmath18 can vary .",
    "then from ( [ ec2 ] ) and ( [ ee3 ] ) @xmath53 the product @xmath54 and from ( [ ne ] ) we obtain @xmath55 ,   \\label{ne2}\\ ] ] where we have used @xmath56 . in",
    "@xcite the numerical curves for @xmath57 show that @xmath58 . using the analytical expression ( [ ne2 ] )",
    "we do not find agreement for small values of @xmath8 .",
    "however there is not a compelling reason to believe in ( [ ne2 ] ) for small @xmath8 .",
    "to study the small @xmath8 region , we must use the correct limit @xmath59 of ( [ pot ] ) which leads to @xmath60 ,   \\label{pot2}\\ ] ] so , if now we take the limit @xmath41 we obtain the logarithmic potential @xmath61 . a very important fact to note from ( [ pot1 ] ) is that the limit @xmath59 does not exist .",
    "of course , the expression ( [ pot1 ] ) is wrong around the @xmath6 region and the expressions derived from this are ill - defined .",
    "but , some work has been done in this regard @xcite . for the logarithmic potential",
    "the adiabatic index is @xmath62 , so from ( [ ec3 ] ) and ( [ ec2 ] ) we obtain @xmath63 ,   \\label{ta3}\\ ] ] but this form does not permit us to write an explicit expression for @xmath64 ( see ref .",
    "let us make some comments about this result . because @xmath65 from ( [ ec3 ] ) we obtain @xmath66 , then @xmath67 .",
    "moreover , from ( [ ec2 ] ) we have @xmath68 , then to compute @xmath64 we should evaluate the factor @xmath69 at the extremes @xmath50 and @xmath40 , but this is not possible .",
    "the problem arises when @xmath21 is chosen close to @xmath40 in a expression valid for @xmath41 .",
    "because ( [ pot1 ] ) is valid for @xmath41 too , the same problem should appear in the calculation of @xmath64 .",
    "in fact this is the case but , to see that , we must include the constant term @xmath70 in ( [ pot1 ] ) or equivalently , write the limit correctly .",
    "when we use the potential @xmath71 ,   \\label{pot3}\\ ] ] the adiabatic index become time - dependent , satisfying the equation @xmath72 where @xmath73/q . $ ] replacing this in ( [ ec3 ] ) we obtain the same behavior as in eqn.([ee2 ] ) .",
    "but when we calculate @xmath18 we obtain @xmath74^{1/2}$ ] , which is not well defined at the point @xmath75 . the same happens to the e - fold number , as mentioned before .",
    "the authors of @xcite found @xmath56 using the potential ( [ pot1 ] ) . from this result",
    "they found a decrease of @xmath64 at decreasing values of @xmath8 .",
    "this seems very strange because , for smaller values of @xmath8 we obtain flatter potentials at @xmath76 , then @xmath2 rolls slowly most of the time increasing the amount of inflation .",
    "furthermore , we are not safe of how they set the initial conditions for @xmath2 in their numerical analysis . in general",
    ", the initial and final field configuration depends on the potential .    for @xmath8 close to cero , @xmath50 is not proportional to @xmath8 .",
    "in fact , we know that @xmath50 came from the saturation of the slow - roll inequality @xmath77 using the expression ( [ pot3 ] ) for the potential @xmath78 .   \\label{recur}\\ ] ] for the @xmath41 region . in figure 1",
    "we see the behavior of @xmath50 in terms of @xmath8 given by eqn.([recur ] ) . of course , in the large @xmath8-region both curves agree . in order to illustrate this point and compare with ref.@xcite we use its expression given by eqn.([ne ] ) but instead of using @xmath56 we use the numerical values of @xmath50 obtained from eqn.([recur ] ) .",
    "the results are plotted in figure 2 . in the small @xmath8-region",
    "the field @xmath79 grows preventing the fall of @xmath64 predicted in ref.@xcite .",
    "moreover , as we have anticipated before , the value of the field at the end of oscillating inflation will have a @xmath8-dependence too .",
    "we know from ref .",
    "@xcite that the intercept @xmath80 , must be positive to hold oscillating inflation .",
    "let us define @xmath81 to be the value of the inflaton field @xmath2 at which @xmath82 .",
    "this condition represents the end of inflation due to oscillation .",
    "we need thus to compare @xmath83 for different values of @xmath8 .",
    "if we take the potential ( [ pot3 ] ) and define @xmath84 , we obtain @xmath85 .",
    "\\label{ta6}\\ ] ] from this equation we can extract a explicit expression for @xmath83 .",
    "if we impose @xmath86 we obtain the value of the scalar inflaton field at the end of this phase @xmath87 using the improved expression eqn.([ne ] ) for the e - fold number ( ref.@xcite ) , but inserting the corrected values for @xmath50 and @xmath88 given by eqns .",
    "( [ recur ] ) and ( [ fif ] ) we obtain @xmath89 ^{1/2}\\right\\ } .",
    "\\label{ta7}\\ ] ] the corrected value for @xmath83 leads to a even smaller amount of inflation when comparing with the value obtained in ref.@xcite . in figure 3 , we plot eqn.([ta7 ] ) and show the behavior of both effects combined . because @xmath83 is greater than @xmath40 , the amount of inflation is smaller than one obtained by liddle et al.@xcite in the whole range of @xmath90 .",
    "moreover , the correct values of @xmath50 produce a positive contribution to @xmath64 in the small @xmath8-range , which avoids the fall of @xmath64 , as @xmath8 goes to smaller values , predicted by liddle et .",
    "again , it is not possible to show the whole range of @xmath8 because @xmath91 ( see comments below eqn.([recur ] ) ) .    because oscillating inflation adds e - folds of inflation after the slow - roll regime , where the observed perturbations are generated , is possible that this additional period of inflation could push perturbations to observable scales . in order to obtain the required amplitude of density perturbations and without imposing unphysical constraint on the potential",
    ", we should compute the density perturbation spectrum for the model being studied .",
    "in reference @xcite an expression for this object was derived @xmath92 however , this expression is not well defined close enough to zero . using the primordial density perturbation spectrum",
    "@xmath93 as was define in @xcite we obtain for eqn.([pot3 ] ) @xmath94 ^{3}}{\\left ( \\varphi /\\varphi _ { c}\\right ) ^{2q}}\\right\\ } ,   \\label{pertur}\\ ] ] which is well defined even for the small values of @xmath8 : @xmath95 because the cobe satellite require @xmath96 , in the @xmath97 case the amplitude of the potential for @xmath57 gives @xmath98 , which is a typical number for inflationary models .",
    "as a summary , we have made some corrections about how to compute the e - fold number , which accounts for the amount of inflation during the oscillatory phase .",
    "in particular we note that previous studies are not accurate because they are not valid close to the core of the potential @xmath99 .",
    "thus , we make the analysis for the small @xmath8 region of the potential , which has not been considered until now .",
    "finally we find that , in order to extract the correct amount of inflation during this phase , a very careful definition of initial and final field configuration is needed .",
    "our results show that near @xmath6 the e - fold number is maximal but it is still not enough to be more efficient than the parametric resonant effect discussed in @xcite .",
