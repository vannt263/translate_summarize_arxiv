    "in the classical work on critical dynamics @xcite the important role of initial conditions for relaxation processes was not fully appreciated .",
    "guided by the ( incorrect ) idea that all memory of the initial state would be lost after a _ microscopic _ time span , so that the initial condition would leave no universal traces on _ macroscopic _ time scales , most authors refrained from a thorough analysis of the effects of the initial condition , taking the relaxation process to start in the infinite past @xmath6 .",
    "others chose initial conditions at time @xmath7 and incorporated the initial value @xmath8 of the order - parameter density @xmath4 in the scaling analysis of the relaxation process , but tacitly presumed that @xmath9 scaled with the same dimension as @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "as shown some time ago by janssen et al .",
    "@xcite , this assumption is in general incorrect . due to its failure , quantities relaxing from an initial nonequilibrium state with short - range correlations may exhibit interesting short - time anomalies on _ macroscopic _ time scales . to be specific ,",
    "let us consider a @xmath11-dimensional ising system with purely relaxational dynamics , which relaxes at the curie temperature @xmath12 from an initial nonequilibrium state prepared by a rapid quench from a thermal equilibrium state with @xmath13 and small @xmath9 .",
    "we assume that @xmath11 is below the upper critical dimension @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) , but above the lower one , @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "the following is now well - established @xcite : ( i ) the initial value @xmath9 gives rise to a _",
    "macroscopic _ time scale @xmath18 , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 denote the usual dynamic bulk exponent and the scaling dimension of @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "( ii ) the latter is greater than @xmath21 , the scaling dimension of the equilibrium order parameter @xmath22 , so that @xmath23 is positive .",
    "( iii ) for @xmath24 , @xmath4 displays an anomalous increase of the form @xmath25 , which crosses over to the familiar nonlinear relaxational behavior @xmath26 for @xmath27 .",
    "similar short - time anomalies have been found for other dynamic universality classes @xcite and in the case of relaxation near a tricritical point @xcite .    on a qualitative level ,",
    "the puzzling fact that @xmath4 actually _ increases _ in the above short - time regime even though the equilibrium state that is approached as @xmath28 has zero magnetization can be understood as follows ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . by choice of the initial state ,",
    "its correlation length @xmath29 is small .",
    "as @xmath30 grows , @xmath31 will increase , too .",
    "fluctuation effects will be suppressed as long as @xmath31 is small .",
    "let us suppose for a moment that fluctuation effects can be neglected completely for small @xmath30 .",
    "then a mean - field ( mf ) description should be valid . for systems with short - range interactions",
    "this is known to give a critical temperature @xmath32 significantly higher than the exact @xmath33 .",
    "hence for short times the system should behave as if it were in the ordered mf phase , with @xmath4 trying to approach the corresponding nonzero value of the spontaneous mf magnetization . in reality , fluctuations must _ not _ be neglected when @xmath34 , not even in the short - time regime .",
    "this is clearly borne out by the renormalization group ( rg ) analyses @xcite , which show that loop corrections _ do _ contribute to the short - time behavior , producing nontrivial short - time exponents @xmath35 and @xmath20 .",
    "consequently , one must first integrate out all degrees of freedom with wave lengths up to the scale @xmath31 using the rg before reliable information can be extracted by perturbative means .",
    "this necessity of taking into account fluctuations will lead to quantitative modifications .",
    "yet it seems reasonable to expect that the tendency of @xmath4 to increase at short times should qualitatively persist . accepting this argument",
    "one concludes that as @xmath30 and @xmath31 grow , the system will eventually realize that the true @xmath33 is much lower and _ not _ below the temperature @xmath36 of the surrounding heat bath .",
    "then @xmath4 will start its decrease towards zero .",
    "recently we have extended the work of janssen et al .",
    "@xcite to systems of finite size @xcite .",
    "specifically , a cube of large , but finite , side length @xmath37 was considered under periodic boundary conditions .",
    "as is well known , @xmath37 gives rise to a characteristic time of the form @xmath38 @xcite . at bulk criticality , this is the only other macroscopic time scale besides @xmath39 . in the case of the dynamic universality class",
    "considered , namely the one represented by the familiar model a of refs .",
    ", the asymptotic long - time behavior is of the exponentially decaying form @xmath40 which identifies @xmath41 as the linear relaxation time at @xmath12 . while @xmath41 is independent of the initial state , the amplitude @xmath42 was found to exhibit a _",
    "universal _ dependence on both @xmath9 and @xmath37 .",
    "it may be written as @xcite @xmath43 where @xmath44 is a universal function , up to redefinitions of its overall amplitude and the scale of its argument @xmath45 .",
    "since @xmath44 approaches a constant in the limit @xmath46 , any dependence on @xmath39 ( and hence on @xmath9 ) asymptotically drops out completely of ( [ amde ] ) for @xmath47 ; i.e. , any memory of the initial condition is lost for @xmath48 . in the opposite limit , @xmath49",
    ", the scaling function behaves as @xmath50 , giving @xcite @xmath51 that is , the amplitude varies linearly in @xmath9 , and its @xmath37-dependence is governed by the same exponent @xmath35 that characterizes the short - time singularity of @xmath4 in the bulk case .    as we have shown in ref .",
    ", these predictions follow in a natural fashion from a phenomenological scaling approach .",
    "while they should therefore be valid for general values of @xmath0 , detailed checks and explicit calculations of the scaling function @xmath44 have so far been undertaken with only two methods .",
    "one , utilized in ref .  , is the exact solution of the finite - sized @xmath0-component model a in the limit @xmath52 .",
    "this yielded for the amplitude in ( [ amde ] ) the simple form @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are nonuniversal constants .",
    "the second method used so far is monte carlo simulation of two and three - dimensional ising models @xcite .",
    "both li et al .",
    "@xcite and grassberger @xcite estimated the short - time exponent @xmath35 , obtaining values in reasonable agreement with the @xmath56-expansion results of janssen et al .  . in ref .",
    ", also the dependence of @xmath57 on @xmath9 was investigated and found to conform remarkably well with the large-@xmath0 result ( [ minfn ] ) .    in the present paper",
    "we wish to apply an alternative powerful approach , one which works for general @xmath0 : the rg approach that uses @xmath58 as small parameter . from previous studies",
    "@xcite it is well known that a proper treatment of finite - size effects by this method requires a rather _ subtle _ procedure . unlike to the case of bulk critical behavior ,",
    "a dimensionality expansion in integer powers of @xmath56 does not in general result .",
    "the reason is that the lowest - energy mode of the order - parameter field @xmath59 , which is the spatially homogeneous one ( with wave number @xmath2 ) in our case of periodic boundary conditions , must be treated _ nonperturbatively _ ; only the other , @xmath3 modes may be treated by rg - improved perturbation theory .    a frequently used technique @xcite is to integrate out the latter modes in order to obtain an effective action for the former .",
    "upon using the functional - integral formulation of our dynamic model , this could in principle also be done in the present case .",
    "due to the fact that even the free propagator of the @xmath3 modes involves the @xmath2 part of @xmath60 as a background field , the resulting effective action becomes rather complicated , however , and does not lend itself easily to direct calculations of time - dependent quantities such as @xmath4 .",
    "we have found it more convenient to perform the perturbative elimination of the @xmath3 modes directly on the level of the langevin equation , following goldschmidt s procedure in in this regard . at lowest nontrivial order of renormalized perturbation theory",
    "the resulting equation for the @xmath2 mode takes the form of a nonlinear stochastic equation .",
    "the required nonperturbative treatment of this mode then amounts to solving this equation by numerical means . upon averaging the solutions over the associated noise",
    ", the desired @xmath4 follows .",
    "our analysis goes in two respects beyond the related one by goldschmidt .",
    "first of all , we take care to properly build in the initial conditions .",
    "this is a central purpose of the present work .",
    "the advantage is twofold . on the one hand",
    ", our approach encompasses an adequate description of the anomalous short - time behavior . on the other hand ,",
    "it permits us to study in a systematic fashion how the initial condition @xmath9 manifests itself on long time scales . in this",
    "regard , our work complements  and in parts corrects  ref .  .",
    "second , we consider the finite - sized model a for general component number @xmath0 . accordingly",
    "our findings can be compared both with the exact results for the limit @xmath52 @xcite as well as with monte carlo calculations for the kinetic ising model ( @xmath5 ) @xcite and for polymers ( @xmath61 ) @xcite .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "ii we first recall the definition of the finite - sized @xmath0-component model a. starting from the stochastic equation for the order - parameter field @xmath59 , we eliminate the @xmath62 degrees of freedom to obtain the reduced stochastic dynamics for the @xmath2 component @xmath63 of @xmath60 . section iii deals with the finite - size scaling forms of the stochastic equation for @xmath63 and of its solution .",
    "we first reconsider briefly the problem in the case @xmath64 . upon renormalizing the theory for @xmath65 ,",
    "rg equations are then derived for @xmath63 and its stochastic equation whose solutions yield the desired asymptotic scaling forms .",
    "subsequently the so - obtained scaling form of the stochastic equation is explicitly verified by means of rg - improved perturbation theory up to one - loop order within the framework of the resulting @xmath66 expansion . in sect .",
    "iv we first show that the scaled stochastic equation at bulk criticality has asymptotic solutions with the correct limiting behavior in both the short - time regime as well as in the long - time one .",
    "the scaled stochastic equation is extrapolated to @xmath67 , and numerical results for its solutions are presented .",
    "these are compared with the large-@xmath0 results of ref .   and the monte carlo simulations of refs .   and .",
    "section v contains a brief summary and concluding remarks .",
    "some technical details have been relegated to two appendices .",
    "we consider the @xmath0-component model @xmath54 for a @xmath11-dimensional hypercube @xmath68 with volume @xmath69 under periodic boundary conditions .",
    "this is defined by the langevin equation @xcite @xmath70 with the ginzburg - landau hamiltonian @xmath71\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath72 is an @xmath0-component field , while @xmath73 is a gaussian random force with mean zero and correlation @xmath74 all times @xmath30 and @xmath75 are assumed to be positive . at @xmath7 we impose the initial condition @xmath76 where @xmath9 is independent of @xmath77 .    in view of the chosen periodic boundary conditions we make a fourier expansion @xmath78 where the sum runs over all @xmath79 with @xmath80 next we decompose @xmath81 into its @xmath82 part @xmath83 and a remainder @xmath84 given by the sum of all @xmath85 terms on the right - hand side of ( [ fourierexp ] ) . an analogous decomposition we make for the noise ,",

    "let us denote an average over @xmath91 by @xmath94 .",
    "further , we introduce the notation @xmath95 with @xmath96 . because of ( [ intvartheta ] ) and translational invariance we also have @xmath97 . the resulting stochastic equation for @xmath63",
    "can be written in the form @xmath98 = \\xi^{\\alpha}(t)\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath99 and repeated indices are summed over . a systematic derivation of eqn.([exstocheq ] )",
    "is given in appendix a. the functions @xmath100 and @xmath101 in ( [ stensor ] ) are the expectation values of bilinear and trilinear products of @xmath90 s and @xmath102 s .",
    "these are independent of @xmath77 but depend , of course , in a complicated manner on @xmath103 with @xmath104 .",
    "in terms of @xmath105 the initial condition ( [ inicond ] ) becomes @xmath106 and expectation values involving @xmath90 s and @xmath102 s have to satisfy dirichlet initial conditions .",
    "eqn.([stensor ] ) , which is an exact consequence of ( [ langevin])([stoch ] ) , forms the basis of our subsequent analysis .",
    "we emphasize that the functions @xmath107 and @xmath108 are functionals of @xmath105 . in order for ( [ langevin ] ) to become a closed equation for @xmath105 , this functional dependence must be known .",
    "this is the case  at least in principle  if we consider these functions to be given by their feynman graph series .",
    "explicit expressions for their graphs to two - loop order are presented in appendix a. the @xmath105-dependent free propagators involved  and hence the resulting expressions for the graphs  differ from the ones used by goldschmidt @xcite .",
    "this is because we imposed an initial condition at @xmath7 rather than in the infinite past .",
    "we are interested in the asymptotic solutions of the stochastic equation ( [ exstocheq ] ) near the bulk critical point .",
    "since these are known to have a scaling form , the stochastic equation itself should take a scaling form on sufficiently large length and time scales . in order to show this and to compute explicit expressions for these scaling forms",
    ", we will largely follow ref .  .",
    "differences arise because of our imposed initial condition at @xmath7 . in the case",
    "@xmath109 , essential modifications are required to ensure a proper treatment of both the short - time anomalies and the long - time behavior . in the case",
    "@xmath64 , the differences are marginal as far as the leading asymptotic behavior is concerned , and the results could be gleaned from ref .  .",
    "since the subsequent analysis for @xmath109 makes substantial use of these , it is useful to recapitulate them briefly .      above the upper critical dimension @xmath110 ,",
    "the effect of the @xmath3 modes ( i.e.  of @xmath90 ) is asymptotically negligible .",
    "thus @xmath107 and @xmath111 may be replaced by zero , their zero - loop expression , in ( [ exstocheq ] ) .",
    "inspection of the resulting stochastic equation reveals that it takes a scaling form . in summary",
    ", it follows that @xmath105 asymptotically behaves as @xmath112 where the scaling function @xmath113 is a solution to the scaled stochastic equation @xmath114 with the initial condition @xmath115 here @xmath116 is the scaled time , and the scaled noise @xmath117 obeys @xmath118    the result ( [ scphidg4 ] ) is a manifestation of the familiar fact that finite size scaling @xcite gets modified above the upper critical dimension @xcite . below it",
    "the finite size scaling forms involve the temperature field @xmath119 and the time @xmath30 in the combinations @xmath120 and @xmath121 , respectively , where @xmath122 is the equilibrium bulk correlation length .",
    "this simple form of finite size scaling breaks down for @xmath64 because @xmath123 gives rise to a further length that must be taken into account in the scaling theory .",
    "a second and trivial remark concerns the scaling of @xmath9 .",
    "since the scaling form ( [ scphidg4 ] ) is dictated by dimensional considerations , @xmath9 necessary scales with @xmath37 in precisely the same fashion as @xmath105 and hence @xmath4 . only for @xmath109 can the corresponding scaling dimensions @xmath20 and @xmath124 become different .",
    "finally , we note that corrections to the leading asymptotic term given on the right - hand side of ( [ scphidg4 ] ) can be computed by perturbation theory in @xmath123 , provided the ultraviolet singularities have been regularized .        in this case",
    "the influence of the @xmath3 part @xmath90 on @xmath105 must _ not _ be neglected . since perturbation theory in @xmath123",
    "is known to break down in the critical regime , it can not be used to treat this influence .",
    "we will rely on rg - improved perturbation theory near @xmath125 . to this end",
