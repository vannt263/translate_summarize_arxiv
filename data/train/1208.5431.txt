    "time reversal ( tr ) mirrors can , under ideal circumstances , precisely reconstruct a wave disturbance which happened at an earlier time , at any given later time .",

    "more recently , tr mirrors have been realized using electromagnetic waves @xcite expanding their range of applicability .",
    "they have applications in communications @xcite , imaging @xcite , source localization @xcite , non - destructive evaluation @xcite , selective beamforming @xcite , and sensing @xcite .",
    "the principle of tr mirrors is closely linked with the concepts of scattering fidelity @xcite , and the loschmidt echo @xcite .",
    "tr mirrors are used to focus waves both in space and time .",
    "an ideal tr mirror consists of a wave source located inside a lossless medium that is completely enclosed by a surface of transceivers .",
    "a tr mirror operates in two steps . in step one , the transceivers record and absorb the signal broadcast by the source . in step two ,",
    "the transceivers rebroadcast time reversed versions of the recorded waves .",
    "the waves broadcast in step two eventually focus on the location of the source and reconstruct a time reversed version of the original signal , which was broadcast in step one .",
    "this is possible because of the tr invariance property of the lossless wave equation .",
    "this ideal tr mirror uses the so called closed tr cavity @xcite .",
    "however , it is not generally practical , for example , to build a closed tr cavity , whose interior is completely covered with transceivers .",
    "practical tr mirrors have several limitations , which result in an imperfect reconstruction of the original signal .",
    "these limitations include i ) limited spatial coverage by the transceivers , and ii ) dissipation during the wave propagation ( which breaks tr invariance of the wave equation ) @xcite .",
    "the first limitation of tr mirrors can be overcome by the use of a reflecting wave chaotic cavity with partial spatial coverage by transceivers that have a long recording time @xcite .",
    "however , the limitation due to dissipation persists , and leads to increasing loss of information as the recording time increases .    the technique of iterative tr was proposed to improve the performance of tr mirrors which suffer from the limitations of dissipation and incomplete spatial coverage of transceivers @xcite .",
    "however , the iterative technique may not converge fast enough , despite a recent result showing the tunability of its convergence @xcite .",
    "a faster alternative to the iterative technique is the inverse filter technique @xcite .",
    "but , the inverse filter technique is computationally costly and potentially unstable @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the technique of exponential amplification was used to overcome the adverse effect of dissipation on tr based sensing techniques @xcite .",
    "the spatial range of these techniques is limited due to dissipation .",
    "the exponential amplification technique was successfully employed to extend the spatial range of the tr based sensing techniques .",
    "exponential amplification has also been employed to remove the effects of dissipation on the scattered field intensity in disordered wave propagation systems @xcite .    in this paper ,",
    "another application of the exponential amplification technique is proposed . unlike the work in ref.@xcite , the application involves improving the performance of tr mirrors which suffer from dissipation .",
    "the performance of tr mirrors is defined as the normalized correlation between the original pulse and the time reversed version of the reconstructed pulse ( after some post - processing ) .",
    "this paper quantitatively demonstrates that the exponential amplification technique mitigates the adverse effects of dissipation on the performance of tr mirrors , for different spatial loss distributions .",
    "the technique of exponential amplification can compete with the iterative tr technique in improving this performance of tr mirrors , to some extent .",
    "the advantage of the exponential amplification technique is that it is faster to implement , as it does not rely on iterative steps .",

    "the theory supporting the exponential amplification technique was originally presented in ref.@xcite . in this section ,",
    "the theory is summarized and a quantitative measure of performance of tr mirrors is defined . to summarize the theory , a cavity with transfer function @xmath0 is considered .",
    "when a brief pulse , @xmath1 , is broadcast into the cavity , the response is @xmath2 . at a later time , a time reversed version of @xmath2 denoted @xmath3 is broadcast back into the cavity producing reconstructed pulse denoted @xmath4 at the original broadcasting antenna or transducer .",
    "ref.@xcite provides a derivation showing that , if the cavity is lossless , @xmath1 is the same as a time reversed version of @xmath4 denoted here as @xmath5 .",
    "thus , the tr mirror works perfectly in a lossless cavity .",
    "even if the cavity is lossy , it is shown that the tr mirror can still recover the original pulse in the special case of uniform loss .",

    "the electromagnetic tr mirror operates as shown in fig .",

    "the tr mirror involves a one cubic meter aluminum box that has irregular scatterers inside it , and two ports in its walls .",
    "the aluminum walls of the cavity are constructed of a single material , and can be assumed to have a uniform spatial distribution of loss .",
    "the original pulse was broadcast into the cavity using port 1 , and the response signal , which we call `` sona '' , was collected using port 2 .",
    "the original pulse had a carrier frequency of @xmath21 and a gaussian envelope with a standard deviation of @xmath22 .",
    "the sona was recorded for about @xmath23 with a signal to noise ratio ( snr ) greater than @xmath17 . during the second step of the tr mirror operation ,",
    "the sona signal was time reversed and broadcast back into the cavity using port 1 ; this made use of the spatial reciprocity property of the wave equation .",
    "finally , a reconstructed pulse , which approximates a time reversed version of the original pulse was collected at port 2 . the reconstructed pulse ( and its temporal sidelobes )",
    "was collected over a @xmath24 duration .",
    "the first @xmath23 included a direct recording of the time reversed sona being injected into the cavity from port 1 .",
    "the last @xmath25 was a recording of the post - reconstructed pulse emerging from port 2 , reverberating throughout the cavity .",
    "based on eq .",
    "[ eqn : trperf ] , @xmath13 can be calculated as the normalized correlation between the following two aligned signals : i ) the time reversed version of the reconstructed pulse with its temporal sidelobes ( which was a @xmath26 long recording ) , and ii ) the original pulse broadcast ( by considering the @xmath27 long gaussian envelope to be located at @xmath28 of a @xmath26 long signal of mostly zero voltage values ) .",
    "note that these two signals are equivalent to the aligned @xmath1 and @xmath5 signals introduced in sec .",
    "[ sec:5-theory ] . if the tr mirror were perfect , @xmath13 would be @xmath17 .",
    "however , as can be seen in part 4 of fig .",
    "[ fig : eafig1 ] , the reconstructed pulse has temporal sidelobes which result in @xmath29 .",
    "the sidelobes arise due to the limitations of practical tr mirrors discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec:5-introduction ] , which include limited spatial coverage of transceivers and dissipation .",
    "generally , the sona signal shows an exponential decay which is caused by dissipation and coupling losses .",
    "the experimental system discussed here is strongly under - coupled @xcite , which means that the effect of dissipation dominates the effect of coupling .",
    "therefore , the @xmath6 voltage decay constant ( @xmath7 ) which is related to the unloaded quality factor can be readily determined by a linear fit to the @xmath30 of the sona energy as a function of time .",
    "the exponential amplification can then be applied to the sona signal before it is time reversed and broadcast into the cavity .",

    "in addition , the function @xmath37 is typically terminated by a smooth ramp - down function whose time span is at least as wide as the time duration of the original pulse , which is @xmath27 ; this prevents additional frequency components from entering into the sona .",
    "suppose that the sona is exponentially amplified using @xmath37 , before it is time reversed and broadcast into the electromagnetic cavity .",

    "the @xmath26 long reconstructed waveform was time reversed so that the @xmath27 long gaussian pulse is located at about @xmath28 ; this waveform was then multiplied by @xmath41 to get the corrected reconstructed waveform ( i.e. @xmath12 ) introduced in sec .",

    "the fact that the @xmath29 even for @xmath44 can be explained by the fact that the tr mirror has only one recording channel , whereas the theory assumes that all the waves are captured .",
    "thus , the exponential amplification technique only overcomes the limitation of the tr mirror associated with dissipation , and not the problem of insufficient spatial coverage of recorders .",
    "noise , which is not considered in the theory , also affects the performance of tr mirrors as seen in ref.@xcite .    as shown in fig .",

    "nonetheless , the exponential amplification has an advantage because of its speed , and computational simplicity .",
    "the result in this section proves that the exponential amplification improves the performance , @xmath13 , of tr mirrors with uniform spatial loss .",

    "this modest improvement is due to the use of very lossy microwave absorber material to vary the loss , resulting in very inhomogeneous loss distribution . in this section ,",
    "a systematic and better controlled numerical study of the effect of non - uniform spatial loss distribution on the applicability of the exponential amplification technique is presented .",
    "the applicability of the exponential amplification technique was studied as the inhomogeneity of the spatial distribution of loss was increased .",

    "set up @xmath72 is chosen as @xmath73 , where @xmath74 .",
    "the second reason to use this particular pdf is that its support is the set of positive numbers , which should be the case as @xmath70 should always be positive on the passive transmission lines .",

    "@xmath52 lines were used in the star graph to increase the back - reflection coefficient of the waves that are trying to leave the star graph .",
    "this forced the waves to reverberate inside the star graph longer , which decreased the coupling loss by two orders of magnitude compared to the dissipation loss .",
