    "in the standard model of particle physics , the @xmath0 scattering amplitude violates the unitarity bound at a center of mass energy c.o.m . @xmath1 tev  @xcite .",
    "one solution to this problem is offered by the higgs mechanism  @xcite through the introduction of a massive scalar particle with non - zero vacuum expectation value .",
    "loop corrections to this `` higgs boson s '' mass involving other massive particles are quadratically divergent , implying that the physical mass of the higgs boson corresponds to a scale at which new physics is present . to successfully address the @xmath0 scattering amplitude problem the higgs boson mass",
    "is constrained to @xmath2 tev/@xmath3 , and if fermions acquire their masses through coupling to the higgs boson , then @xmath4 gev/@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "if the higgs boson , whether elementary or composite , does nt exist , some other form of new physics must be present at the tev scale to prevent the @xmath0 scattering amplitude from violating the unitarity bound . among the models of new physics , supersymmetric ones are certainly , and justifiably , the most popular . these address the divergences in the corrections to the higgs mass in a very natural way , improve the unification of couplings at a high scale , provide a good dark matter candidate and lead to radiative electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "unfortunately , they do not tell us anything about the origin of the number of generations of fermions , their mass spectrum , charges , etc . in this",
    "talk , recent results from the cdf and d  collaborations on searches for manifestations of non - supersymmetric new physics are presented .",
    "new heavy gauge bosons are predicted in many extensions of the standard model :    * in so - called little higgs models , the quadratically divergent radiative corrections to the higgs mass are canceled `` individually '' , leading to the appearance of partners of the @xmath5 and @xmath6 bosons at the tev scale . * in grand unified theories ( guts ) and left - right symmetric models ( lrsms ) heavy partners of the electroweak bosons generally appear , although their masses are less well constrained .",
    "* in extra dimensional models where the gauge bosons are allowed to propagate in ( some of ) the additional space dimensions kaluza - klein excitations will be observable . to address the hierarchy problem",
    ", these should typically have masses @xmath7 tev/@xmath3 .",
    "* if the higgs field is a triplet rather than a doublet , doubly charged higgs bosons exist .",
    "it should also be noted that graviton resonances which appear in randall - sundrum type models  @xcite lead to similar signatures .",
    "cdf recently released a new result in the search for dielectron resonances using almost 900 @xmath8 of data .",
    "the invariant mass spectrum of dielectron events used in this search is shown in figure  [ fig : cdf - diem ] .",
    "dielectron invariant mass spectrum in the cdf search for electron - positron resonances . ]    no significant excess is seen at any mass value leading to a limit on the mass of a sequential , standard model - like @xmath9 of @xmath10 gev@xmath11 at 95% c.l .",
    "cdf also searches for pair production of doubly charged higgs bosons in the lepton flavor violating modes @xmath12 and @xmath13 ( and charge conjugates ) .",
    "at least three leptons are required in the final states so that the backgrounds are very small , and no events are observed in approximately 350 @xmath8 of data . interpreted in a left - right symmetric model , the corresponding mass limit on doubly charged higgs bosons coupling to left - handed particles is @xmath14 gev@xmath11 at 95% c.l . in the @xmath15 channel .    in the search for singly charged gauge bosons ,",
    "cdf looked for a @xmath16 decaying to an electron and a neutrino in 205 @xmath8 and derived a limit @xmath17 gev@xmath11 from a study of the transverse mass spectrum .",
    "leptoquarks are a natural consequence of the unification of quarks and leptons into a single multiplet , and as such are expected to be gauge bosons as well . while their masses can logically be expected to be of the order of the unification scale , in some models they can be relatively light .",
    "experimentally , it is customary to consider one leptoquark per generation .",
    "these are assumed to be very short - lived and decay to a quark and a lepton .",
    "the branching ratio to a charged lepton and a quark is then denoted as @xmath18 .    at hadron colliders",
    ", leptoquarks can be pair - produced through the strong interaction or singly produced . in the latter case",
    "the production cross - section depends on the ( unknown ) quark - lepton coupling , which is generally taken to be of the same order of magnitude as the fine structure constant .",
    "there are two recent results from leptoquark searches at the tevatron .",
    "d  has searched for leptoquarks decaying to a quark and a neutrino ( @xmath19 ) in the jets plus missing tranverse energy in 370 @xmath8 of data .",
    "experimentally this is a difficult analysis which suffers from substantial qcd dijets background due to mismeasured jets . to mitigate this , d  requires exactly two acoplanar jets .",
    "the ensuing missing transverse energy distribution , before final analysis cuts , is shown in figure  [ fig : d0-met ] .",
    "missing transverse energy distribution in the dsearch for @xmath19 leptoquarks before final cuts .",
    "the inset shows the two different fitting functions used to evaluate the background from mismeasured qcd dijet events . ]",
    "the background from qcd dijets , dominant at low missing transverse energy , is extrapolated to higher values using two different fitting functions as shown in the inset .",
    "the dominant non - qcd standard model background is @xmath6 boson plus jets production with the @xmath6 decaying to a pair of neutrinos .",
    "no excess is observed so d  sets a limit at @xmath20 gev@xmath11 at 95% c.l .",
    "cdf has released results on a search for vector leptoquarks of the third generation in the @xmath21 decay channel .",
    "the signature consists of a dijet plus ditau final state , in which one tau is required to decay leptonically and the other hadronically .",
    "the main discriminating variables are the number of jets and an @xmath22-type variable which is a scalar sum of the transverse energies of all jets , leptons and the event s missing transverse energy .",
    "this allows cdf to set a limit at @xmath23 gev@xmath11 assuming @xmath24 . note that this limit is much higher than the typical limits on leptoquark masses at the tevatron due to the model choice of vector leptoquarks , which have a much larger production cross - section than the scalar leptoquarks which are usually chosen .",
    "in the original large extra dimensions model of arkani - hamed , dimopoulos and dvali  @xcite in which only gravitons propagate in the bulk but all standard model fields are confined to a 3-brane , a tower of kaluza - klein excitations of the graviton emerges .",
    "the graviton states are too close in mass to be distinguished individually , and the coupling remains small , but the number of accessible states is very large .",
    "it is therefore possible to produce gravitons which immediately disappear into bulk space , leading to an excess of events with a high transverse energy jet and large missing transverse energy , the so - called monojet signature .",
    "the dominant standard model backgrounds are the production @xmath6 or @xmath5 bosons plus jets , with the @xmath6 decaying to a pair of neutrinos or the lepton from @xmath5 decay escaping detection . using 368 @xmath8 of data , cdf sets limits on the fundamental planck scale between @xmath25 tev@xmath11 and @xmath26 tev@xmath11 for a number of extra dimensions ranging from 2 to 6 .",
    "both cdf and d  have new results on the search for resonances decaying to @xmath27 .",
    "cdf has two analyses , with the first using @xmath22 as its main discriminating variable . after selecting events with leptonic",
    "@xmath6 decays , a control region with @xmath28 gev is used to establish a good understanding of the data , and the signal region is chosen to have @xmath29 gev , including at least two jets , each with transverse energy @xmath30 gev . using 305 @xmath8 of data , no events are observed in the signal region .",
    "a limit is set on the production cross - section of @xmath31 gev@xmath11 right - handed down - type quarks as proposed in reference  @xcite at @xmath32 pb at 90% c.l .    in a second analysis , cdf studies the transverse momentum distribution of @xmath6 bosons .",
    "this has the advantage of being insensitive to the nature of the other decay products , but is of course more difficult and potentially less sensitive than a direct resonance search . selecting events with a dielectron invariant mass compatible with the mass of the @xmath6 boson , @xmath33 gev@xmath34 gev@xmath11 , cdf measures the @xmath6 transverse momentum distribution shown in figure  [ fig : cdf - zpt ] .",
    "transverse momentum distribution of @xmath6 bosons decaying to electron - positron pairs measured by cdf in 305 @xmath8 of data . ]    from this they determine an upper limit on the anomalous production of @xmath6 bosons as a function of transverse momentum using 305 @xmath8 of data .",
    "the 95% c.l .",
    "limit ranges from about 1 pb for @xmath35 gev@xmath36 to approximately 2 fb for @xmath37 gev@xmath36 .",
    "d  explicitely searches for a @xmath6 boson plus jet resonance by combining the @xmath6 boson plus jet mass spectrum and the @xmath6 boson transverse momentum distribution as discriminating variables .",
    "the invariant mass distribution measured in 380 @xmath8 of data is shown in figure  [ fig : d0-zjm ] .",
    "invariant mass of the @xmath6 boson and leading jet as measured by d  in 380 @xmath8 of data .",
    "the curves with different @xmath38 thresholds correspond to different generation thresholds for 2 @xmath39 2 processes in pythia , and the open circles represent the signal due to an excited quark of mass @xmath40 gev@xmath11 and narrow width . ]    no excess is observed and a limit is set on the mass of an excited quark as proposed in reference  @xcite at @xmath41 gev@xmath11 at 95% c.l .    in the search for excited muons both cdf and d  have results as well . both experiments",
    "search for associated production of a muon and an excited muon , with the latter decaying to a muon and a photon .",
    "the production is approximated as a contact interaction , while the decay is assumed to proceed either through a gauge interaction ( cdf ) or a combination of a gauge and a contact interaction , with the relative fraction of the two depending on the mass of the excited muon and the compositeness scale .",
    "both experiments obtain very similar results using 371 ( cdf ) and 380 ( d ) @xmath8 of data . to make comparison with lep results easier",
    ", cdf also reinterprets the result in a gauge mediated model with drell - yan - like production of the @xmath42 pair with coupling @xmath43 .",
    "this result is shown in figure  [ fig : cdf - muslim ] .",
    "exclusion region from the cdf search for excited muons in a gauge mediated model with coupling @xmath43 for comparison with lep results . ]",
    "in run i , cdf reported an excess of events with a photon , a lepton and large missing transverse energy compared to standard model expectations  @xcite .",
    "this excess , corresponding to a 2.7 sigma effect , was deemed `` an interesting result '' , but not `` a compelling observation of new physics . ''",
    "cdf has repeated this analysis in run ii using 305 @xmath8 of data  @xcite .",
    "the data is now compatible with standard model expectations in all channels , suggesting that the excess observed in run i was due to a statistical fluctuation .    in a similar spirit , cdf searches for events with two photons and an electron or muon ( 700 @xmath8 ) , or three photons ( 1 @xmath44 )",
    "this is primarily a counting experiment , and again , unfortunately , no excess is observed over expectations .",
    "in 2000 , the nutev collaboration reported  @xcite on a search for heavy neutral leptons decaying to @xmath45 and a few other final states . in the dimuon channel , they observed three events while only 0.07 were expected . because of the asymmetry in the muon momenta , and the absence of signal in other channels , nutev argued that the signal was unlikely to be due to neutral heavy leptons . to further investigate this ,",
    "d  has searched for pairs of muons originating from a common vertex located between 5 and 20 @xmath46 from the beamline .",
    "this allows a good calibration of efficiencies using @xmath47 mesons .",
    "no signal is seen in 380 @xmath8 of data , and to compare results the momentum of the hypothetical new particles in the neutrino beam was converted to the tevatron center of mass frame .",
    "the result , which is weakly dependent on assumptions made in regard to the new particle s decay process , is illustrated in figure  [ fig : d0-nutev ] in terms of the particle s production cross - section times branching ratio and lifetime .",
    "excluded area in the search for a long - lived particle decaying to muon pairs plus anything in terms of the particle s production cross - section times branching ratio , and lifetime . ]",
    "as the tevatron continues its good performance , cdf and d  collect large amounts of data and search for new physics in many channels .",
    "only recent results have been reported here , and many other analyses are in progress .",
    "there is _ still _ nothing interesting , and previous excesses have been shown to be due to fluctuations .",
    "so far , new physics has remained hidden , but a substantial amount of data is yet to be recorded at the tevatron and the lhc is scheduled to start operations soon .",
