    "canonical phase measurement in quantum mechanics is a significant problem , for the main reason that phase is a quantity that is conjugate to the number , @xmath0 , of photons in a particular electromagnetic mode  @xcite . due to this conjugate nature , the phase estimate @xmath1 is ultimately limited by the number @xmath0 of the photons as @xmath2 , which is conventionally referred as the heisenberg limit . in the usual classical setting , such as interferometry with lasers , for a given number of input resources , @xmath0 , phase estimate scales as @xmath3 , which is usually referred as shot - noise limit .",

    "the phase estimate thus obtained is independent of the system phase , unlike in other methods  @xcite where the ultimate limit is achieved for a particular system phase .",
    "also , the measurement specified by sanders and milburn is not particular to a specific input state .    motivated by this work , berry and wiseman  @xcite analytically derived an input state , called as the optimal state , subject to the canonical measurement .",
