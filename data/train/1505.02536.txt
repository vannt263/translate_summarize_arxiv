    "in most current free space optical ( fso ) communication systems , for reasons of simplicity , intensity modulation with direct detection ( im / dd ) is used . to improve the spectral efficiency , we consider @xmath0-ary pulse amplitude modulation ( mpam ) here by presuming that the receiver photodetector will not be saturated by the impinging optical signal level that has the highest energy .",
    "the transmitter side constellation is shown in fig .",
    "[ fg : cons_tx ] , where @xmath1 denotes the minimum signal intensity distance and the transmitter average power is defined as @xmath2 . inside the receiver , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fg : receiver ] , there is an integrator that integrates the photo current for each symbol period @xmath3 . for the @xmath4th symbol interval ( @xmath5 ) ,",
    "the received electrical signal @xmath6 is obtained by sampling the integrator at time @xmath7 .",
    "since the photo current can be assumed to be constant during the integration time , @xmath6 can be expressed as @xcite @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the responsivity of the photo detector and @xmath10 denotes the instantaneous channel gain .",
    "the transmitted data symbol @xmath11 takes on any value from set @xmath12 with equal probability , and gray mapping of bits onto the levels is assumed . in practice , multiplying the received signal by the normalising basis @xmath13 , which is shown in fig .",
    "[ fg : receiver ] , is not necessary .",
    "we use it here because we want to simplify later performance analysis by normalizing the discrete additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) term @xmath14 such that @xmath15=\\delta _ { ij } { n_0}/{2 } $ ] conditioned on that the continuous noise term @xmath16 is an additive white gaussian random process with mean zero and two - sided spectral density @xmath17 . by defining @xmath18 as the instantaneous receiver - side electrical - domain minimum signal distance",
    ", @xmath6 can be modelled as @xcite @xmath19 correspondingly , the receiver side constellation is shown in fig .",
    "[ fg : cons_rx ] . since atmospheric turbulence and pointing errors cause fluctuations in the intensity of the received signal , i.e. , @xmath10 is time - varying ,",
    "therefore , @xmath20 is time - varying and is modelled as @xmath21 where @xmath22 denotes the minimum signal distance when @xmath23 , i.e. , @xmath24 , which is related to the average transmit power @xmath25 , i.e. , @xmath26        for the on - off keying ( ook ) system that is considered as the simplest mpam ( @xmath27 ) case , the turbulence and pointing error induced fading is the major issue that degrades system performance .",
    "thus , the accurate channel state information ( csi ) , i.e. , the accurate instantaneous value of @xmath10 , is required for properly adjusting the decision threshold . in previous studies , frequent insertions of pilot symbols",
    "@xcite or co - propagating reference light @xcite is used to estimate the csi . in this paper ,",
    "when it comes to pilot symbols , we specifically refer to pilot symbols used for channel estimation . in practice",
    ", pilot symbols are also required for other purposes such as timing synchronization .",
    "since pilot symbols do not carry data , the use of them results in a system spectral efficiency reduction and additional energy overheads .",
    "therefore , we hope to minimize the amount of pilot symbols . the co - propagating reference light has the same problem , and besides , since it has a different frequency with the signal - bearing light , the estimation result may not be accurate . for mpam systems ( @xmath28 ) , to detect signals reliably , the requirement of accurate csi is more stringent .",
    "the difficulty of accurate csi acquisition is the main reason that limits the use of mpam in practical systems . however , though these two above - mentioned methods can be extended to mpam systems , they are not so suitable in practice .",
    "the receiver design problem remains challenged by the fact that the csi is hard to acquire at the receiver side if very few pilot symbols and no co - propagating reference light are used .    since the channel coherence length",
    "@xmath29 , defined as the number of consecutive data symbol intervals over which the channel gain @xmath10 can be considered to be constant , is a very large number ( @xmath30 ) for multi - gbps systems@xcite , the data and the csi can be jointly detected and estimated . in @xcite , for the 2-level pam system , i.e. , the ook system , based on the generalized likelihood ratio test ( glrt ) principle , we derived a maximum likelihood ( ml ) sequence detection receiver ( the glrt - mlsd receiver ) that jointly detects the data sequence and estimates the unknown channel gain . in @xcite , we have extended this glrt - mlsd receiver to multi - level pam systems . however , as we discussed in @xcite , the search complexity of the glrt - mlsd receiver increases with the modulation order @xmath0 almost quadratically .",
    "therefore , in section ii of this paper , we derive a simpler decision - feedback ( dfb ) , symbol - by - symbol receiver , whose implementation complexity is independent of the modulation order @xmath0 .",
    "it uses the most recently detected data symbols to help estimate the instantaneous channel gain . as the number of the detected data symbols used to estimate the channel increases , the bit error probability ( bep ) of this receiver approaches the genie bound , which is defined as the bep of detection with perfect csi ( pcsi )",
    "we use @xmath31 to denote the decision on symbol @xmath11 and @xmath32 , @xmath33 , ... , @xmath34 $ ] to denote the decision on the subsequence @xmath35 , @xmath36 , ... , @xmath37 $ ] .",

    "selective store strategy _ ( sss ) : at each time @xmath4 , we only store the @xmath76 most recent received signals that have been detected to carry symbol @xmath77 .",
    "since all the signals correspond to the same data symbol @xmath77 , store of detection results is unnecessary , and thus , the estimate of @xmath20 reduces to @xmath78 where @xmath79 is defined as the @xmath80th most recent received signal at time @xmath4 that is detected to carry data symbol @xmath77 . in this way ,",
    "a zero - denominator of the channel estimator will never occur , leading to completely avoiding the channel estimation failure .",
    "we assume all the decisions before time @xmath4 are correct . even in practice",
    ", decisions can not be 100% correct , with a very low error probability , we can assume so when analysing system performance . in the later section that shows simulation results",
    ", we do not assume 100% correct decision feedback .",
    "thus , with the assumption , we have @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the corresponding awgn term . substituting @xmath81 into and simplifying",

    "thus , since @xmath89 , we have @xmath90 with probability 1 .",
    "since the estimation of @xmath20 can approach the true value , we can say that the bep of our dfb receiver with sss approaches the genie bound as @xmath76 goes to infinity .",
    "a more general sss is given as follows : we selectively store the @xmath76 most recent received signals and their corresponding detection results with the criterion @xmath91 , where @xmath92 takes value from set @xmath93 .",
    "clearly , @xmath92 is an important parameter and the sss introduced in the previous two paragraphs is an extreme case with @xmath94 .",
    "if @xmath95 , both detected data and corresponding signals are required to be stored , and the required memory length is @xmath96 ; if @xmath94 , since only signals that are detected to carry @xmath77 are required to be stored , the memory length is @xmath76 and the best memory efficiency is achieved .",
    "also , with a fixed value of @xmath76 , a higher value of @xmath92 leads to better performance .",
    "another aspect to consider is to keep the observation window length @xmath97 , which is on the order of @xmath98 , far smaller than the channel coherence length @xmath29 .",
    "thus , to achieve the best performance with a fixed @xmath76 value , we can choose the highest value of @xmath92 that makes @xmath99 .",
    "the bep of symmetric pam over the awgn channel has been studied and given in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eq.s ( 9 ) and ( 10 ) ) in terms of the average energy per bit @xmath100 and the awgn spectral density @xmath101 .",
    "it should be noticed that @xcite assumed an electrical digital communication system and thus @xmath100 is the electrical - domain average energy per bit .",
    "based on the mapping given in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eq . ( 2 ) ) which is from @xmath100 to the minimum signal distance @xmath22 , we can obtain its inverse . after substituting this inverse into ( * ? ? ? * eq.s ( 9 ) and ( 10 ) ) , we can derive the general bep expression in terms of the minimum signal distance @xmath20 and the awgn one sided spectral density @xmath101 as .",
    "@xmath102    since is expressed in terms @xmath20 and @xmath101 , it applies to both symmetric and asymmetric pam signals over the awgn channel .",
    "therefore , the bep of the pcsi receiver conditioned on a given value of @xmath10 is @xmath103 , and the average bep over all possible values of @xmath10 is given by @xmath104 this average bep , which is also referred to as the _ genie bound _ , is used as a benchmark when analysing other receivers . specifically ,",
    "when discussing the bep of our receiver , we refer to the average bep over all possible channel states .",

    ", we need to keep , @xmath106 unchanged . for conventional electrical digital communication systems",
    ", we have @xmath107 which is equivalent to @xmath108 where @xmath100 denotes the electrical - domain energy per bit . from",
    ", we see that when keeping the same level of error probability , @xmath100 is irrelevant to the transmission rate .",
    "this means no matter how fast we transmit data , the energy consumed on each bit does not change , i.e. , to transmit the same amount of data , the total energy consumed is irrelevant to the transmission rate .",
    "however , for optical systems , the situation is different .",
    "the optical - domain energy consumed per bit @xmath109 can be calculated via @xmath110 according to , we have @xmath111 where @xmath112 is defined as the data rate .",
    "we can see that the higher the transmission rate @xmath113 is , the lower the energy consumed on each bit transmission is .",
    "therefore , we can say that , when @xmath22 , @xmath101 , @xmath0 and @xmath105 are unchanged , i.e. , the same level of error probability is retained , to transmit the same amount of data , using a larger data rate ( bandwidth ) is suggested since the total energy consumption is lower .    this is because the amplitude of the photo detector output current is proportional to the incident light power @xcite . that means",
    "if we increase the optical power by @xmath114 times , the electrical - domain signal amplitude is increased by @xmath114 times and the electrical - domain signal power is increased by @xmath115 times .",
    "when we use a larger bandwidth , say @xmath116 times of before , to achieve a higher data rate , the noise power , which is the product of the noise power spectral density and the bandwidth , is increased by @xmath116 times . to keep the error probability same ,",
    "the electrical - domain signal power is also required to be increased by @xmath116 times , corresponding to increasing the optical signal power by @xmath117 times . since the transmission rate is increased by @xmath116 times , the required time for transmitting the same amount of data is shortened to @xmath118 of before , and thus the total optical energy consumption is @xmath119 times of before . finally , our conclusion is that using a higher bandwidth is suggested since it saves energy .",
    "it should be emphasized that all the analysis and conclusions in this subsection are based on several basic assumptions :    * pin diode is used for photo detection , i.e.",
    ", thermal noise can be regarded as the dominant noise souse and shot noise is negligible * the photo detector will never be saturated by the signal pulse that is with the highest power level * the photo detector can response as fast as the user requires , i.e. , the photo detector bandwidth is no less than the system symbol rate . *",
    "the fso channel is always in a linear regime , where the output power is proportional to the input signal power .    without any of the abovementioned assumptions",
    ", the analysis and conclusions may not be true .      as discussed in @xcite and @xcite , geometric spread and pointing errors @xmath120 , atmospheric turbulence @xmath121 , and path loss @xmath122 together",
    "determine the overall channel gain @xmath10 .",
    "the channel state @xmath10 is formulated as @xmath123 .",
    "all these three parameters are time - varying for outdoor environments .",
    "the path loss is related to the atmospheric phenomena , such as rain , fog and snow , and the distance between the transmitter and receiver .",
    "therefore , if the distance between the transmitter and the receiver does not chain , @xmath122 changes much slower than @xmath121 and @xmath120 . in @xcite and @xcite , @xmath122 is considered as a deterministic variable while @xmath121 and @xmath120 are considered as random variable . in @xcite",
    ", log - normal distribution is adopted to model @xmath121 for weak turbulence , gamma - gamma distribution for moderate to strong turbulence and the negative exponential distribution for strong turbulence . since in @xcite",
    ", it has been shown that the gamma - gamma distribution can nicely fit the channel fading statistics of all turbulence regimes , in this paper , we only consider @xmath121 is a gamma - gamma distributed random variable , and the pdf of @xmath121 is @xmath124 where @xmath125 is the modified bessel function of the second kind , and @xmath126 and @xmath127 are the variances of the small and large scale eddies , respectively .",
    "pointing error influence on an fso system is discussed in @xcite and @xcite , and we here use the model in @xcite where the pdf of @xmath120 is given as @xmath128 parameter @xmath129 is the fraction of the collected power when no pointing error occurs , and @xmath130 is the ratio between the equivalent beam radius at the receiver and the pointing error displacement standard deviation at the receiver@xcite . without loss of generality",
    ", we can incorporate @xmath122 into @xmath121 which amounts to setting @xmath131 .",
    "then for a turbulent channel with pointing errors , the channel gain is @xmath132 , and by using ( * ? ? ?",
    "* example 13.1.10 ) , its pdf can be derived by @xmath133 full model details can be found in @xcite .",
    "the system parameters of this paper are given as follows : for the weak turbulence channel , @xmath134 , @xmath135 and the corresponding @xmath136 ; for the strong turbulence channel , @xmath137 , @xmath138 and @xmath139 . according to ,",
    "the turbulence with si=0.1244 , which is less than 1 , is in weak irradiance fluctuations regime ; and the turbulence with si=1.3890 , which is larger than 1 , is in moderate - to - strong irradiance fluctuations regime .",
    "the pointing error parameters are chosen to be @xmath140 and @xmath141 . without loss of generality , the photo detector responsivity @xmath9 is assumed to be 1 and the expected channel gain @xmath142 $ ] is set to be 1 .",
    "additionally , we assume the system data rate @xmath113 is on the order of 10 gbps , thus the symbol duration @xmath143 is on the order of @xmath144s and the channel coherence length @xmath29 can be safely regarded as @xmath54 data symbols .",
    "we consider the typical thermal noise , which is -174dbm / hz , passing through a 50@xmath145 receiver circuit .",
    "thus , the value of @xmath17 is @xmath146 , i.e. , @xmath147 .      in fig .",
    "[ fg : bep_vs_snr_sss2 ] , we plot the bep versus average receive power curves of our dfb receiver . since the implementation complexity of our dfb receiver is independent of @xmath0 , we show simulation results with up to @xmath148 .",
    "we see that as the value of @xmath76 increases , the bep decreases . to achieve the genie bound ,",
    "the required value of @xmath76 is 12 for the weak turbulence channel and no larger than 16 for the strong turbulence channel .    from fig .",
    "[ fg : bep_vs_snr_sss2 ] , we see that if we keep the data rate unchanged and increase @xmath0 to save bandwidth , to achieve the same error probability , we need to increase the transmit power .",
    "this means bandwidth and power are a pair of contradictions .",
    "we can hardly minimize both of them simultaneously , but we can select appropriate values according to practical requirements .",
    "another interesting observation is that if we keep @xmath0 unchanged and use a larger bandwidth to achieve a higher data rate , to achieve the same level error probability , the multiple of the power growth is the square root of that of the data rate growth . specifically , from fig .",
    "[ fg : bep_vs_snr_sss2 ] , we can see that for @xmath149 , if we increase the data rate from 10 gbps to 20 gbps , the corresponding power increment is less than 3db , approximately 1.5 db .    to further study the receiver performance with more values of memory lengths , we plot fig .",
    "[ fg : bep_vs_l ] . for the reason of space limit",
    ", we only pick one ( @xmath0 , average receive power , data rate , si ) point here , which is ( @xmath150 , -1 dbm , 40 gbps , si=1.3890 ) .",

    "[ fg : estimation ] , we plot the estimate of @xmath20 with different memory lengths .",
    "we assume ook modulation and choose @xmath151 .",
    "the numerical results given in fig .",
    "[ fg : estimation ] completely agree with the theoretical analysis given in the previous section .",
    "thus , we have shown that , by both theoretical analysis and simulation , with a higher value of @xmath76 , the estimation of @xmath20 is more accurate .",
    "this enables the bep of our dfb receiver to approach the genie bound .",

    "when starting to operate our dfb receiver , @xmath76 pilot symbols are required to obtain an initial value of @xmath152 . unlike some other communication systems that require frequent insertion of pilot symbols to avoid burst errors , in our simulation , no burst errors are observed even with only @xmath76 pilot symbols for initializing and no further frequent insertions .",
    "thus , the pilot - to - data ratio is far smaller than 1 , and we do not consider the power consumed by pilots when calculating the average snr per bit .",
    "since the channel coherence length @xmath29 is very large , we can use the detected data symbols to estimate the unknown channel state instead of using pilot symbols which causes spectral efficiency reduction . in this paper , based on the decision metric of our previously proposed glrt - mlsd receiver ,",
    "we propose a dfb symbol - by - symbol receiver , whose implementation complexity is much lower and is independent of the modulation order .",
    "hence , it is efficient both spectrally and computationally .",
