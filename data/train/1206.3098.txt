    "in recent years , there has been intense renewed interest in light - meson transition form factors due to their potential role in the theoretical determinations of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) . with more and more exclusive channels contributing to the hadronic vacuum polarization measured experimentally with unprecedented precision",
    ", it is believed that the hadronic contribution to light - by - light scattering may soon constitute the dominant uncertainty  @xcite .",
    "while a full determination of the light - by - light scattering tensor remains a formidable task , a combination of experimental data and theoretical analyses may help to constrain one of the most important contributions ( and one of the few that are model - independently accessible ) , namely the pseudoscalar ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 ) pole terms .",
    "their strength is determined e.g.  for the @xmath7 pole contribution by the decay @xmath8 , given in terms of the doubly - virtual form factor @xmath9 ( see e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite for precise definitions ) , where @xmath10 denote the two photon virtualities .",
    "as these doubly - virtual form factors , that are to be measured in the rare decays @xmath11 ( with branching ratios of the order of @xmath12 ) , are difficult to determine precisely in experiment , it is useful to note that they are intimately linked ( for specific values of one of the photon virtualities ) to vector - meson conversion decays : e.g. , the form factor @xmath13 determines the dilepton spectrum in @xmath14 , the form factor @xmath15 can be measured in @xmath16 etc .",
    "the interactions of hadrons with ( real and virtual ) photons are often thought to be described at least to good approximation in the picture of vector - meson dominance ( vmd ) : the @xmath17-dependence of the form factors above should largely be given by the propagator of a light intermediate vector meson ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 ) , see e.g.  refs .",
    "what is interesting about the vector - meson conversion decays is that they show a very clear deviation from such a simple vmd picture , as has been established in the decay @xmath2",
    "@xcite , and also in @xmath21  @xcite .    in this article",
    ", we will analyze two such vector - meson transition form factors with the method of dispersion relations , concentrating on @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( the latter being rarer due to the implied violation of the okubo  zweig ",
    "iizuka rule ; see ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent theoretical work ) .",
    "one specific theoretical advantage of vector - meson conversion decays , as opposed to the pseudoscalar dalitz decays , is that the isospin of the virtual photon is fixed ( in the approximation that isospin is conserved ) . in the cases at hand",
    ", it needs to be an iso__vector _ _ photon , hence the lowest - lying intermediate states to contribute in a dispersion relation are @xmath22 , @xmath23 etc .  only , and experience with pion ",
    "pion p - wave interactions suggests that the @xmath22 intermediate state will already saturate the dispersion relation to a large degree . as we will demonstrate below",
    ", a dispersive reconstruction of the @xmath22 contribution requires two amplitudes as input : the corresponding @xmath24 decay amplitude ( in the appropriate partial wave ) , and the pion ( electromagnetic ) vector form factor .",
    "an analysis of the @xmath0 transition form factor using dispersion theory has already been performed decades ago  @xcite ( although phenomenologically the focus of that work lay more on the @xmath25 production cross section ) . the reasons to take up this subject again are manifold : we now have much more accurate experimental as well as theoretical input at our disposal , both for the pion vector form factor and the required pion  pion phase shifts ; furthermore , we have recently performed a dispersive analysis of the three - pion decays of both @xmath19 and @xmath20 that treats final - state interactions between all three pions rigorously  @xcite , which can now serve as the consistent input to the investigation of the transition form factors .",
    "all these ingredients of the analysis will be reviewed below .    as a final introductory remark , we note that in this article , we will confine ourselves to an analysis of the transition form factors in the kinematical region accessible in the corresponding vector - meson _ decays_. we are aiming for a precision analysis and hence refrain from analyzing also the processes @xmath26  @xcite and @xmath27  @xcite , as we expect these to be significantly more dependent on information from the excited - resonance region .",
    "the outline of this article is as follows .",
    "we introduce the necessary definitions concerning kinematics and partial - wave decomposition in sec .",
    "[ sec : vpivkin ] .",
    "we discuss the dispersion relation for the transition form factors in sec .",
    "[ sec : vpivdr ] , including the two main elements required as input : the pion vector form factor and the @xmath28 partial - wave amplitude .",

    "[ sec : summary ] .",
    "technical details on a representation of the pion vector form factor including higher resonances are relegated to an appendix .",

    "we will also discuss the corresponding normalized form factor , @xmath36 the differential decay rate in terms of this amplitude can be written according to @xmath37 with the fine - structure constant @xmath38 and masses of vector meson , neutral pion , and leptons denoted by @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 , respectively .",

    "note finally that the corresponding _ real - photon _ total decay rate is given by @xmath48    in establishing a dispersion relation for the @xmath49 transition form factors , the corresponding three - pion decays @xmath50 play a central role .",
    "we define @xmath33 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 with @xmath53 .",

    "the amplitude is given as @xmath56 neglecting the discontinuities of f and higher partial waves , we can decompose @xmath57 in terms of functions of a single variable with only a right - hand cut  @xcite , @xmath58 for our analysis we will require the @xmath59 partial - wave projection of @xmath57 , which is given by @xmath60 where @xmath61 . note that the angular integration in eq .",
    "is a highly nontrivial issue due to the fact that the cuts in the variables @xmath62 and @xmath63 need to be avoided ; compare the discussion in appendix  b of ref .",
    "to set up the dispersion relation for the transition form factor , we calculate the two - pion discontinuity of the diagram shown in fig .  [",

    "stem from heavier intermediate states of the appropriate quantum numbers ( isospin 1 p - wave states ) : @xmath23 , @xmath66 ,  , which are expected to be suppressed significantly due to phase space and their higher masses .",
    "we therefore neglect these contributions in our analysis and resort to elastic @xmath67 final states only . given the standard assumptions on the asymptotic high - energy behavior of the pion form factor , @xmath68 ( modulo logarithms ) , and the @xmath69 partial wave , @xmath70  @xcite , eq .",
    "allows for an unsubtracted dispersion relation  @xcite .",
    "as our analysis , however , is confined to two - pion intermediate states and neglects any higher contributions , we decide to employ a once - subtracted solution of eq .   instead , @xmath71 in order to suppress inelastic contributions .",
    "for the predictions of the @xmath72-dependence of the form factor , we fix the subtraction constant @xmath73 to reproduce the @xmath74 partial width according to eq .  .",
    "assuming the validity of an unsubtracted dispersion relation , the subtraction constant and therefore the @xmath74 partial width can be calculated by means of a sum rule , @xmath75 which is expected to show a more problematic convergence behavior than the form - factor dispersion relation .",
    "we will quote results for this sum rule in sec .",
    "[ sec : numres ] in order to quantify the potential role of heavier intermediate states in the transition form factor .",
    "nevertheless , eq .   is a remarkable result : as we will briefly reiterate below , in the elastic approximation the pion vector form factor is entirely given in terms of the @xmath67 p - wave phase shift @xmath76 , which also determines the @xmath54 partial wave up to a single subtraction constant that can be written as an overall normalization  @xcite .",
    "this means that the ratio of branching ratios @xmath77 is entirely determined by @xmath76 , up to inelastic corrections .",

    "the aforementioned procedure treats the higher resonances @xmath87 and @xmath88 as purely elastic , which they clearly are not ( compare the more sophisticated form factor representation of ref .",
    "@xcite ) ; we merely use the phase thus obtained as an indicator for uncertainties generated in the energy range between roughly 1.3  gev and 1.9  gev .",
    "as the omns representation requires the @xmath67 p - wave phase shift up to infinity , we have to make assumptions about its asymptotic behavior .",

    "[ fig : f1 ] .",

    "furthermore , we note that the phase of @xmath78 also does not follow @xmath89 : watson s theorem does not hold due to three - pion - cut effects , see fig .  [",

    "[ fig : disc3pi ] ; as discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , these singularities in the discontinuity do _ not _ translate into singular behavior of the form factor itself when evaluated at the upper rim of the unitarity cut .",

    "+    we will in general stabilize the high - energy behavior of our dispersion integrals by manually leading @xmath108 to @xmath113 beyond a certain cutoff @xmath114 .",
    "there is no obvious prescription as to when exactly the amplitude or the form factor should show this asymptotic behavior ; we choose the point up to where we have adjusted our form factor representation to data , that is @xmath115  gev , and incorporate a variation of the cutoff up to @xmath116  gev in our error considerations .",
    "this prescription assures that we have a precision representation for the amplitude in the low - energy regime as well as the correct high - energy behavior . by varying the cutoff",
    "we assure that the intermediate - energy regime is sufficiently suppressed so as not to taint our numerical results , which we present in the following section .",
    "for the numerical evaluation , we use the different parameterizations of the phase shift described in sec .  [",
    "sec : fvpi ] ; the same parameterization is always used consistently for both pion form factor and @xmath54 partial wave .",
    "we vary the cutoff of the dispersion integrals in eqs .  , , and ( beyond which the assumed asymptotic behavior is enforced by hand ) between @xmath115  gev and @xmath116  gev as detailed above .",
    "we note that it does not make sense to vary the cutoff of the aforementioned integrals individually : the uncertainties in our treatment are related to our lack of knowledge concerning final - state interactions in the intermediate - energy range , and thus apply equally to all considered dispersion integrals .",
    "the subtraction constants of the @xmath54 amplitudes are fixed by the total widths @xmath117  mev and @xmath118  mev together with the @xmath54 branching ratios @xmath119 , @xmath120 , the uncertainties of which we will always neglect in the following .",
    "it turns out that for all of our evaluations of the _ once - subtracted _ dispersion relation in eq .  , a variation of the phase between the parameterization of ref .",
    "@xcite and the one derived from the form factor spectrum along with an integral cutoff of @xmath115  gev gives rise to an enveloping uncertainty band .    for the following @xmath74 branching ratios determined from eq .   and the _ unsubtracted _ dispersion relation , the parameterization of ref .",
    "@xcite and the one from the form factor spectrum together with an integral cutoff of @xmath116  gev give rise to limiting values .",
    "we find @xmath121 which is to be checked against the experimental averages @xmath122 , @xmath123  @xcite .",
    "we observe that the @xmath124 partial width compares favorably to experiment , whereas the result for @xmath125 turns out to be slightly too low ; even then , the @xmath22 intermediate state seems to saturate more than 90% of the sum rule for this partial width .",
    "we note that the most precise individual measurement of @xmath126 actually determines the ratio of branching ratios @xmath127  @xcite , which is precisely the ratio we argued in sec .",
    "[ sec : vpivdr ] to be a pure prediction due to the @xmath67 p - wave phase shift , independent of any subtraction constant ; for this quantity , our numerical result amounts to @xmath128 hence suggesting a saturation of the sum rule even at the 95% level .",
    "we stress , however , that due to the slow convergence behavior of the integrand in eq .  , we do not consider the sum - rule results to be extremely reliable : they depend rather strongly on the assumed intermediate and high - energy behavior of the @xmath67 phase shift .",
    "for example , using a cutoff of @xmath129  gev in the dispersion integral   beyond which the asymptotic fall - off is enforced by hand , we find that this asymptotic region @xmath130 still yields a 10% correction to the @xmath125 branching ratio .",
    "we therefore rather take these as benchmark values to test the accuracy of the approximation of using only two - pion intermediate states in the dispersion relation : we expect this to work _",
    "better _ in the description of the @xmath72-dependence of the transition form factor , in which we choose the subtraction constant in eq .   fixed to the experimental values of the @xmath74",
    "partial widths .",
    "the errors on these values contribute a large part to the uncertainty of the transition form factor and the differential @xmath30 decay width , which we will present in the following .",

    "[ fig : tff ] we compare the absolute value squared of the @xmath0 transition form factor ( left panel ) and the differential @xmath14 decay widths ( right panel ) calculated in our approach , standard vmd with a finite energy - dependent width , , but guarantees sensible results for @xmath132 . ] and a chiral lagrangian treatment with light vector mesons from refs .",
    "@xcite , to data from refs .",
    "the dispersive approach leads to a significant enhancement of the transition form factor over the pure vmd result , which in turn results in an improved description of the data .",
    "part of this enhancement is even present if we use a simplified , vmd - inspired @xmath104 partial wave @xmath133 inside the dispersion integral . as fig .",
    "[ fig : f1 ] suggests , using the correct full @xmath104 p wave mainly leads to a further enhancement for invariant masses of the lepton pair near and slightly above the two - pion threshold .",
    "we note that using the slightly smaller sum - rule value for the normalization of the form factor ( instead of the one determined from the experimental @xmath125 width ) would further enhance @xmath134 by 510% , albeit at the expense of a significantly enlarged uncertainty .",
    "however , we also find that our analysis can not account for the steep rise towards the end of the decay region , which is somewhat better described by the calculation in refs .",
    "the size of the discrepancy for large invariant masses is surprising ( note that the form factor in fig .  [",
    "fig : tff ] is shown on a logarithmic scale ) , in particular given the level of agreement found in the sum rule for the @xmath125 branching ratio that should converge rather worse .",
    "within the dispersive framework it is therefore hard to think of a plausible explanation for such a steep rise .",
    "we note that in contrast to @xmath105 , we have not yet been able to test the @xmath104 decay amplitude against experimental precision studies of the dalitz plot , so a remaining deficit in our input for @xmath78 can not rigorously be excluded .",
    "still , given the analogy to the @xmath105 study in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is implausible that this can account for the size of the difference .",
    "the transition form factors are often characterized by their slope at @xmath135 : @xmath136 we quote this slope in units of @xmath137 ( where we use @xmath138  mev ) , such that vmd suggests @xmath139 .",
    "our dispersive analysis yields @xmath140 therefore a significant enhancement with respect to the vmd value , yet not as large as the theoretical value found in refs .",
    "@xcite , @xmath141 , and significantly smaller than the experimental determinations @xmath142",
    "@xcite , @xmath143  @xcite .",
    "we note , however , that the latter experimental extractions are in principle model - dependent , as they rely on a monopole parameterization .    in order to improve on the comparison of our form - factor description to the data",
    ", one may think of subtracting eq .",
    "once more and treating the additional subtraction constant as a free parameter , at the expense of spoiling the high - energy behavior of the transition form factor .",
    "the difference between the once- and twice - subtracted representation amounts to an additive term @xmath144 , and it is rather obvious that this term can not account for the strong _ curvature _ in the form factor at higher energies , such that the overall picture is not drastically improved .",
    "furthermore , the value given in eq .   amounts to a value for the slope given by a sum rule , which would be expected to converge much better than the one for @xmath145 in eq .  , yet it yields a result ostensibly off by a large factor .    the differential decay width for @xmath2 ( top , right panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : tff ] ) is calculated according to eq .  .",
    "partial width , similar to the dispersive calculation .",
    "we refrain from displaying errors on the vmd calculation thus induced , since it merely serves illustrative purposes . ]",
    "we observe that the values of the form factor close to the end of the decay region are actually strongly suppressed by phase space . from that vantage",
    "point the situation does not look as dire as when the form factor is considered directly ; however , due to the smallness of the errors of those values our solution still deviates by several @xmath146 .",
    "the integration of the spectrum yields @xmath147 which agrees with the experimental average @xmath148  @xcite within errors .",
    "this is not surprising : as the largest deviations from the experimental form factor are strongly suppressed by phase space , they do not have a large influence on the partial width .",
    "we also display the @xmath149 differential decay width ( bottom , right panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : tff ] ) , which has not been measured yet .",
    "phase space combined with the @xmath150 behavior of the virtual photon lead to a strong enhancement near threshold and a variation of the spectrum over many orders of magnitude ; we therefore only display the full dispersive result , since it is almost indistinguishable from @xmath133 on this scale . for a better comparison to @xmath2",

    "this corroborates our skepticism that an imperfect determination of the @xmath104 p wave is the likely source of the discrepancy seen in the @xmath19 transition - form - factor data .",

    "this is different in @xmath1 : the @xmath18 resonance can be measured in this decay ; if there systematically is a steep form factor rise as seen in @xmath0 , mapping it out in full in @xmath1 will help clarify its origin . from the theoretical side ,",
    "our dispersive analysis for this process is based on a very precisely measured @xmath105 dalitz plot , such that we are very confident about the reliability of our prediction .",
    "we thus strongly advocate an experimental analysis of the @xmath1 form factor to the best possible precision .    as a final illustration",
    ", we show the ( experimentally unobservable ) phases of the @xmath49 transition form factors , both for @xmath19 and @xmath20 , in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasetff ] .",
    "we calculate these from the _ unsubtracted _ solution to the discontinuity equation  , as we can only fix the modulus of the subtraction constant @xmath73 by means of the @xmath74 partial width , not its phase , which is nonvanishing due to the complex discontinuity of the @xmath54 partial - wave amplitude @xmath78 .",
    "only the phases of the full dispersive calculations , as compared to the @xmath67 p - wave phase shift , are displayed .",
    "we refrain from showing the ( small ) error bands and fix the input in complete analogy to fig .",
    "[ fig : f1 ] .",
    "an additional consequence of the complex discontinuity of the @xmath54 partial - wave amplitude is that watson s final - state theorem also does not apply to the transition form factors , and their phases are _ different _ from @xmath89 : three - pion - cut effects , see fig .",
    "[ fig : tffdisc - three ] ,     +    produce nonvanishing imaginary parts / nonvanishing phases of the transition form factors also below the @xmath67 threshold , @xmath164 .",
    "we observe the transition - form - factor phases to be significantly larger than @xmath89 above the two - pion threshold , and a tendency to small negative values below .",
    "in this article , we have analyzed the @xmath49 electromagnetic transition form factors for @xmath131 and @xmath132 by means of a dispersive framework .",
    "it requires the corresponding p - wave projection of the @xmath28 decay amplitudes , and the pion vector form factor as input , both of which depend on the pion ",
    "pion p - wave scattering phase shift as input and are otherwise predictions up to a subtraction constant determining the overall normalization of the @xmath54 amplitudes .",
    "the consistent treatment of crossed - channel effects in the @xmath54 partial - wave amplitudes by incorporating three - particle cuts leads to a nontrivial analytic structure for the transition form factors , in particular its phase does not follow the @xmath67 p - wave phase .",
    "we have calculated the real - photon @xmath74 branching ratios using a sum rule , which yields good agreement with the experimental @xmath124 branching ratio and indicates that the sum rule for @xmath125 ( which is much more precisely determined experimentally ) is saturated roughly at the 90%95% level by two - pion intermediate states . to lessen the dependence on medium - to - high - energy input",
    ", we have oversubtracted the dispersion relation for the form factors and used the real - photon partial widths as input for the subtraction constant .",
    "we found that this approach leads to an enhancement compared to a pure vmd calculation and thus to an improved description of experimental data from na60 for the @xmath2 channel .",
    "three - pion effects in particular lead to an enhancement in the two - pion - threshold region .",
    "we are unable to solve the puzzle of the steep rise in the @xmath0 transition form factor data close to the end of the decay region . in order to try to better understand the physical mechanism behind this enhancement",
    ", we strongly advocate a measurement of the @xmath1 transition form factor : the fact that the physical region of the decay goes beyond that of the corresponding @xmath19 decay and incorporates the @xmath18 resonance peak suggests that it should give some clues about the nature of this rise .",
    "while our predictions for branching ratios of the various @xmath30 channels are in good agreement with experimental determinations , data on decay spectra only exists for @xmath2 .",
    "it would certainly be helpful , especially in light of a theoretical analysis of contributions to light - by - light scattering , if precision data for additional channels could be obtained  @xcite .",
    "we are grateful to s.  leupold for extensive , very useful discussions and a critical reading of this manuscript .",
    "we would like to thank s.  damjanovic and g.  usai for providing us with the data of refs .",
