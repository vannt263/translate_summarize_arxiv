    "the mechanism for increasing the li interaction calls for a subtle interplay between strong confinements of the fields and their spatial oscillations @xcite , together with a reduction of the group velocity @xcite .",
    "metals strongly confine the fields , but the li force is limited by losses @xcite and the repulsion is contrasted by huge cl forces .",
    "dielectrics have a weaker cl force , they confine less efficiently the fields , but once nano - structured they have ultra - low group velocities @xcite .",
    "they represent an optimal compromise , allowing the largest values of repulsion @xcite , orders of magnitude higher than non - structured dielectrics .    here",
    "we propose the exploitation of graphene sheets @xcite in optomechanical waveguides systems to manage li interactions .",
    "remarkably , graphene manifests low group velocity modes , a strong metallic ability to confine them , it is practically lossless in a wide region of frequencies , and gives rise to very weak cl forces .",
    "furthermore , the li force becomes tunable by varying the graphene fermi level via an electrostatic voltage or via chemical doping .",
    "these unique features make graphene sheets able to strongly increase the repulsion , up to 1 - 2 orders of magnitude higher than the best nano - structured systems .",
    "such electromagnetic properties are combined with peculiar mechanical properties ( low density and bending stiffness , large modulus of elasticity ) making them attractive for optomechanics @xcite .    in section [ sec : system ]",
