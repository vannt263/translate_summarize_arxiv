    "starting from the affine covering of a projective space , a new type of noncommutative deformations of complex projective spaces was introduced in  @xcite .",
    "therein , the complex projective space @xmath6 is presented as a natural gluing of polydiscs , dualized to the multi - pullback @xmath3-algebra , and deformed to a multi - pullback of tensor powers of toeplitz algebras .",
    "the case of @xmath7 was analyzed in detail in  @xcite , and called the mirror quantum sphere .",
    "in particular , its @xmath4-groups were easily determined .",
    "the goal of this note is to determine the @xmath4-groups in the case @xmath8 , which requires some tools .",
    "the @xmath3-algebra of the mirror quantum sphere is simply a pullback @xmath3-algebra , so that its @xmath4-theory is immediately computable by the mayer - vietoris six - term exact sequence .",
    "the @xmath3-algebra of the triple - toeplitz deformation of @xmath9 is a triple - pullback @xmath3-algebra , and it turns out that , in order to apply ( three times ) the mayer - vietoris six - term exact sequence , we need to check the cocycle condition .",
    "we begin by general considerations allowing us to combine the cocycle condition , the distributivity of @xmath3-ideals , and the mayer - vietoris six - term exact sequence into a certain general computational tool .",
    "then we use it to establish the @xmath4-groups of the aforementioned quantum  @xmath9 .    to focus attention and for the sake of simplicity , we start by considering the category of vector spaces .",
    "let @xmath10 be a finite set , and let @xmath11 be a family of homomorphisms .",
    "in this category , the multi - pullback of a family   can be defined as follows .",

    "furthermore , one can easily transform the triple - pullback @xmath12 into an iterated pullback :    [ vect ] let @xmath12 be the multi - pullback of a family   for @xmath14 .",
