    "the co - evolution of quasars and galaxies , suggested by the scaling relation between the mass of the supermassive black holes and properties of their host spheroids @xcite , implies that studies of evolution and environment of quasars are a key to understanding evolution of galaxies .",
    "a number of studies have argued that quasar activity is triggered by galaxy mergers ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "there are several observational hints for this , including the morphology of binary quasar host galaxies @xcite and the small - scale environment @xcite , although it is still not clear how and to what extent mergers are crucial for triggering quasars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) .    in particular , clustering measurements of quasars provide an important means of studying the evolution and environment of quasars .",
    "substantial progress have been made thanks to large - area spectroscopic surveys such as two - degree field ( 2df ) and sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) .",
    "large - scale quasar auto - correlation functions measured in these surveys @xcite indicate that the clustering bias of quasars is relatively high and increases rapidly with redshifts , which suggests that quasars live in massive ( @xmath6 ) dark matter haloes . yet ,",
    "small - scale ( @xmath7 ) clustering measurements , which are crucial for testing the suggested merger - driven quasar activities , have been difficult in these surveys , because of the finite size of fibres used for the multi - object spectroscopy which corresponds to @xmath8 on the sky .    while the measurement of small - scale clustering is challenging , @xcite compiled a sample of binary quasars obtained from follow - up spectroscopy of sdss data , and measured the projected correlation function down to the comoving separation of @xmath9 ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for similar results at higher redshifts ) .",
    "they found that the measured small - scale clustering is stronger than the power - law extrapolation of the large - scale clustering measurement by @xcite .",
    "this `` excess '' of small - scale clustering has been interpreted as enhanced quasar activities by direct interactions .    however , one of the potential problems about the analysis of @xcite is that the follow - up observations were not complete and therefore they had to introduce large corrections of incompleteness .",
    "the uncertainty in the incompleteness factor therefore directly translates into the uncertainty of the measured small - scale clustering .",
    "indeed , @xcite constructed more complete sample of binary quasars from follow - up observations of the sdss photometric quasar catalogue for a limited range of angular separations , and claimed that the small - scale excess is not as strong as @xcite found .    in this paper",
    ", we measure the very small - scale clustering of low - redshift ( @xmath1 ) quasars from the sdss .",

    "while the main focus of sqls is to locate lensed quasars , it has also discovered a large number of binary quasars with the angular separation @xmath10 .",
    "thanks to the careful candidate selection , which is designed to achieve very high completeness of the lens candidate selection , and extensive follow - up observations for constructing a complete and robust sample of lensed quasars , the binary quasar sample from the sqls is also expected to be nearly complete and uniform within a specified range of the redshift , magnitude , and angular separation .",
    "we use this binary quasar sample to make an accurate measurement of the quasar correlation function down to @xmath11 , which is small enough for discussing the effect of dynamical interaction and mergers on quasars .",

    "we find that the overall shape of @xmath21 for quasars is quite similar to that for lrgs .",
    "both the correlation functions show deviations from a power - law in a similar manner , which can be better fitted by a more general hod model as we will see in  [ sec : hodresult ] .",
    "we however note a possible difference in the shapes of @xmath21 at the smallest separations of @xmath22 .",
    "the lrg correlation function appears to decrease significantly at the smallest bin , which is also suggested by the recent measurement of the satellite galaxy distribution around lrgs @xcite , whereas there is a hint of excess at the smallest separations in the quasar correlation function .",
    "the difference might be explained by different effects of direct interactions on quasars and galaxies .",

    "calculations of @xmath21 with the hod model are done at the mean redshift of our parent quasar samples of @xmath23 .",
    "our hod model involves only two parameters , @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "considering the fact that the two - halo term is independent of @xmath25 and that the data points of @xcite lie in the scale where the two - halo term is dominant , we first use the measurement of @xcite at @xmath26 to fit @xmath24 only .",
    "the best - fit value is found to @xmath27 , and the resulting normalization is @xmath28 .",
    "this means that dark matter halos with the peak mass of @xmath29 harbour @xmath30 quasars on the average .",

    "figure  [ fig : fsat ] illustrates how the small - scale clustering measurements presented in this paper constrain @xmath25 .",
    "basically @xmath25 controls the amplitude of the one - halo term such that larger satellite fractions predict larger small - scale clustering amplitudes .",
    "figure  [ fig : profile ] compares our best - fit hod models for sis and nfw profiles with the measurements . except for a few points at the smallest scales ,",
    "our hod model reproduces the global feature of the measured correlation function very well . at the smallest scale around @xmath11 ,",
    "the difference of assumed number density profile of quasars in a halo becomes prominent as expected , although even the steep sis profile fails to reproduce the clustering amplitude at these scales .",
    "hence , we also consider the case of an nfw profile with the concentration parameter value enhanced by a factor of 10 compared with our fiducial model @xcite .",
    "this enhanced concentration model predicts @xmath42 for haloes with mass @xmath29 at @xmath43 .",
    "the result shown in figure  [ fig : profile ] indicates that this high - concentration model better reproduces the strong small - scale clustering found in the measurements .",
    "we have measured the small - scale correlation function of low - redshift ( @xmath1 ) quasars using a new sample of 26 spectroscopically confirmed binary quasars from the sqls .",
    "the angular separation range of @xmath44 for the binary quasar sample allows us to measure the quasar auto - correlation function from the projected comoving separation @xmath45 down to @xmath4 . to do so",
    ", we have assumed that our binary quasar sample is complete within a specified range of redshifts and angular separations , which is based on careful selections and extensive follow - up observations of the sqls in order to construct a complete gravitational lens sample .",
    "we have found that the correlation function rises steeply toward smaller separations .",
    "our result is in reasonable agreement with earlier result by @xcite , in which large corrections of sample incompleteness has been applied to measure small - scale clustering signals . while the measured small - scale clustering in our analysis appears to be slightly smaller than the result of @xcite , we note that our result is more consistent with the clustering amplitude measurement within a narrow separation range presented by @xcite based on a complete binary quasar sample . by combining our measurements with the large - scale correlation function obtained by @xcite ,",
    "we have fitted the correlation functions for a wide range of @xmath46 by a power - law @xmath47 , and found the best - fit values to @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "the measured correlation function can be described reasonably well by this single power - law model over 4 order of magnitudes in @xmath50 .",
    "we have interpreted the measured quasar correlation function within the framework of the hod . in particular ,",
    "we have proposed a simple hod model that assumes a constant satellite fraction @xmath25 , which is a reasonable assumption when the average number of quasars in haloes with mass @xmath51 , @xmath31 , becomes large within relatively narrow range in masses . using this model ,",
    "we have shown how the small - scale clustering can be used to constrain @xmath52 .",
    "the best - fit satellite fraction of our quasar sample is @xmath3 for an sis profile and @xmath40 for an nfw profile .",
    "the hod model reproduces the measured correlation function quite well , except at the smallest separations of @xmath53 where the model slightly under - predicts clustering signals even if we assume the steep sis profile for the spatial distribution of satellite components .",
    "we find that even steeper profiles , such as an nfw profile with the concentration parameter of @xmath5 , are needed to explain the measured clustering amplitudes at the smallest scale .",
    "recent numerical simulations of low - luminosity agn also suggest that radial profile of agn inside haloes is much steeper than the normal nfw profile @xcite .",
    "such excess clustering at the smallest separations , as well as possible different behaviors between quasar and lrg correlation functions at those scales ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a discussion on the radial profile of lrgs from hod modelling ) , might be due to an enhanced quasar activity by mergers .",
    "direct high - resolution imaging of host galaxies for these very small - separation binary quasars might be helpful for testing this hypothesis .",
    "when we almost finished this paper , we found that @xcite conducted similar hod analysis of quasar clustering to constrain the satellite fraction , using small - scale clustering measurements of @xcite .",
    "however , their best - fit satellite fraction of @xmath54 for quasars at @xmath55 appear to be significantly smaller than our result .",
    "this discrepancy is explained by different forms of hod modelling adopted in both papers .",
    "their @xmath56 extends toward the mass scale of massive clusters where satellite components dominate the mean number of quasars , whereas in our hod model we have assumed a deficit of quasars in very massive clusters .",
    "we confirmed that their best - fit hod model indeed predicts significantly smaller @xmath25 than our result .",
    "also note that we have assumed that the quasar activities of the central and the satellite quasars are independent of each other , which means that quasars can be satellites even if the central object is not a quasar .",
    "when there exists a strong central - satellite correlation such that haloes are allowed to host satellite quasars only if the central galaxy is also a quasar , we expect that smaller @xmath25 can recover the small - scale clustering of quasar pairs . in this sense",
    ", our best - fit @xmath25 value may be considered as an upper limit .",
    "detailed observation of the environment of ( binary ) quasars or dynamical analysis of quasar pairs might provide more direct information on the mass of host haloes of quasars and on the location of quasars in the host haloes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
