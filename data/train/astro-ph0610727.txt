    "fundamental difficulties remain in our understanding of structure formation on the subgalactic scales . among these , formation and evolution of galactic disks and bulges , angular momentum redistribution between baryonic and dark matter ( dm ) , radial density profiles of dm halos ( especially survival of the dm cusps ) , fueling of the central activity , correlation between masses of the central black holes ( sbhs ) and the surrounding host galaxies  provide an incomplete but impressive list of stand - by problems . on the other hand , understanding the origin of the large - scale structure in the universe has been largely successful .    because the formation and evolution of galactic disks involves grossly non - linear processes , both dissipative and non - dissipative , they are typically investigated by means of extensive numerical simulations .",
    "a major outcome of these simulations is that halos forming within the @xmath0cdm cosmology appear to be universally triaxial ( e.g. , allgood et al .",
    "2006 ) while those inferred in the nearby universe are compatible with being axisymmetric ( e.g. , combes 2002 ) . here",
    "we argue that the underlying halo shape evolution is directly related to the disk formation and its subsequent growth .",
    "two main approaches have been used to follow the formation and evolution of disk galaxies .",
    "first , large - scale cosmological simulations of collisionless and collisional matter have been invoked , with a subsequent extraction of a dm halo and its immediate environment .",
    "resampling was implemented in order to increase the number of particles per halo ( e.g. , sommer - larsen et al .",
    "2003 ; governato et al .",
    "with all the advantages , these simulations still suffer from insufficient numerical resolution and can not compete with simulations of individual galaxies .",
    "second , models of galactic disks in frozen spherically - symmetric halos or analytically growing ( frozen ) halos have been advanced ( e.g. , samland & gerhard 2003 ; immeli et al .",
    "they treat a variety of important processes , such as chemical evolution , but can not follow other processes , such as angular momentum redistribution in the system , especially the halo - disk resonant coupling .    here",
    "we summarize our results from two alternative approaches : ( 1 ) simulations of a limited volume using cosmological initial conditions obtained by means of constrained realizations method ( hoffman & ribak 1991 ) of a prescribed density field ( romano - diaz et al .",
    "2006 , 2007 ) .",
    "berentzen & shlosman ( 2006 ) have applied this method in order to follow the evolution of dm within a @xmath1  mpc@xmath2 box , starting with a redshift @xmath3 and inserting a ` seed ' disk at @xmath4 , in the open cdm ( ocdm ) universe with @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the disk was grown tenfold over different periods of time , @xmath7  gyr .",
    "( 2 ) heller , shlosman & athanassoula ( in preparation ) have followed the hubble expansion and collapse of an isolated dm@xmath8baryons perturbation starting with @xmath9 .",
    "our star formation ( sf ) algorithm is physically motivated and feedback from stellar evolution in the form of ob stellar winds and sn is included .",
    "we have used the updated hybrid sph/@xmath10-body code ftm-4.4 of heller & shlosman .",
    "the dm model has been constructed with a nested set of three off - center @xmath11 perturbations .",
    "the pure dm halo ( model a0 ) went through the epoch of major mergers which ended at @xmath12 .",
    "its density profile is given by nfw ( navarro et al .",
    "1997 ) established by @xmath13 .",
    "we use the _ isopotential _ contours to measure the halo shape , which has a substantial advantage over the isodensities method ( berentzen et al .",
    "the a0 model has settled in a stable , substantially triaxial ( elliptical and flat ) configuration ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "this halo ellipticity leads to a strong interaction with a seed disk immersed at @xmath4 and grown ( or not ) over the next 13  gyr .",
    "we find that a growing disk is responsible for washing out the halo equatorial ellipticity ( in the disk plane ) and for diluting its flatness over a period of time comparable to the disk growth . in models where the disk contributes more to the overall rotation curve , it appears more efficient in axisymmetrizing the halo , _ without _ accelerating the halo figure rotation .",
    "the observational corollary is that the maximal disks probably reside in nearly axisymmetric halos , while disks whose rotation is dominated by the halo at all radii can reside in more elliptical halos .",
    "the halo shape is sensitive to the final disk mass , but is independent of how the seed disk is introduced into the system  abruptly or quasi - adiabatically .",
    "it is only weakly sensitive to the timescale of the disk growth . while models with massive disks have developed strong bars , we find that light disks have this instability damped by the halo triaxiality  an interesting implication for the cosmological evolution of disk galaxies .",
    "the halo itself responds to the stellar bar by developing a gravitational wake  a ` ghost ' bar of its own which is almost in - phase with that in the disk .",
    "we have also investigated formation and evolution of galactic disks within assembling live dm halos in a large number of models ( heller et al . , in preparation ) .",
    "disk and halo structural components have been evolved from the cosmological initial conditions and represent the collapse of an isolated density perturbation in the ocdm universe with @xmath14 , @xmath15 and 10% baryons .",
    "the gas temperature was obtained from the energy equation .",
    "the sf takes place in the jeans unstable , contracting region .",
    "we fix the gas - to - background density at which the gas is converted to a star , the local collapse - to - free fall time , and introduce the probability that the gas particle produces a star during a given timestep .",
    "four generations of stars form per gas particle with an instantaneous recycling along with an increment in metallicity . the balance of the specific internal energy along with the gas ionization fractions of h and he and the mean molecular weight are computed as a function of @xmath16 and @xmath17 for an optically thin primordial composition gas .",
    "the energy feedback from the stellar evolution includes the ob stellar winds and sn , and uses the thermalization parameter  a fraction of the feedback deposited as a thermal energy and converted into kinetic energy via equations of motion .",
    "full details of the sf algorithm and energy feedback are given elsewhere .",
    "the initial density profile corresponds to the average density around a @xmath18 peak in a gaussian random density field .",
    "the spin parameter is set to @xmath19 .",
    "we impose the collapse redshift of @xmath20 .",
    "the mass of collisionless dm particles is @xmath21 and the gas comprises 10% of the total mass initially .",
    "we find that the pure dm models lead to the formation of triaxial halos with a negligible tumbling of @xmath22 over the hubble time .",
    "this leads to corotation and inner lindblad resonance being moved to very large and small radii , respectively .",
    "orbital response of a disk immersed in such a halo will be always out of phase with the halo major axis  thus diluting the halo equatorial potential and washing out its ellipticity .",
    "( baryon effect on the halo shape was first noticed by dubinski [ 1994 ] by diluting the halo potential with that of a rigid plummer sphere , and by kazandzidis et al . [",
    "2004 ] by damping baryons inside the halo . )",
    "in addition , the increasing central mass concentration in the model contributes to the dm orbit scattering and so to decrease in halo ellipticity and flattening .",
    "evolution of the dm halos differs in the presence of baryons in that it reaches smaller triaxialities and these are reduced further .",
    "consequently , the growing disks exhibit substantial ellipticities in the first 2  gyr .",
    "these heavily gas rich disks respond dramatically to halo s non - axisymmetric driving by forming a pair of strong grand - design density waves in the stellar component and associated shocks in the gas .",
    "the pattern speeds of the oval disks and the barlike response are identical and lead to a rapid gas inflow toward the central kpc . in a number of models ,",
    "this resulted in decoupling the central part of the bar in the prograde direction  i.e. , formation of nested bars ( heller , shlosman & athanassoula 2006 ) in accord with shlosman et al .",
    "( 1989 , 1990 ) but under different initial conditions ( begelman et al . 2006 ) .",
    "the disk grows from inside out by increasing its radial scalelength .",
    "this and other disk parameters appear to lie within the range observed in the local universe  from essentially bulgeless to bulge dominated disks ( fig .  2 ) . they do not ` suffer ' from the angular momentum ` catastrophe . '",
    "the total @xmath23 is approximately conserved , even in models accounting for feedback from the stellar evolution .",
    "the baryons lose @xmath24 and the dm acquires @xmath25 of their original @xmath23 .",
    "the specific @xmath23 for the dm is nearly constant while that for the baryons is decreasing with time .",
    "shapes of host dm halos are shown to have a profound effect on the morphology and dynamics of growing disks  with the caveat that the disk growth alters the halo shape .",
    "we find that maximal disks wash out the equatorial ellipticity of inner ( @xmath26  kpc ) halos and lessen their flatness .",
    "they are expected to reside in ( nearly ) axisymmetric halos in the local universe , while disks dominated by halos at all radii can reside in elliptical halos .",
    "the initial disk response to the halo asymmetry is barlike .",
    "this facilitates the angular momentum transfer between the disk and the host halo , and triggers the radial gas inflow .",
    "these conditions provide fertile grounds for the formation of gas rich nested bars .",
    "whether the large - scale bars survive for longer time periods depends largely on the timescale of a halo losing its ellipticity , as stellar bars and elliptical halos appear to be incompatible ( el - zant & shlosman 2002 ) .",
