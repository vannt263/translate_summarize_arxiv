    "the existence today of a @xmath3 k cosmic neutrino background ( c@xmath0b)an exact analogue of the @xmath4 k cosmic microwave background ( cmb)is a fundamental prediction of the standard big bang theory . permeating the universe at an average number density of @xmath5 per flavour , these relics of the big bang trace their origin to the freeze - out of the weak interaction when the universe was a mere one second old ( @xmath6 ) , predating even the cmb photons by thirteen orders of magnitude in time . yet , for the same reason that they decoupled so early , the c@xmath0b neutrinos have so far escaped direct detection in a controlled laboratory setting . to date , cosmological measurements such as the cmb anisotropies and the large - scale matter power spectrum , and , independently , the observed light elemental abundances , provide the best probe of the c@xmath0b s presence in the _ early stages _ of cosmological evolution ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it is therefore our view that alternative avenues , however indirect , that could potentially afford us a glimpse of the c@xmath0b _ as it is today _ should be thoroughly explored .",
    "one such avenue is the @xmath1-dip / burst mechanism and its associated phenomenology @xcite , which proposes to exploit the resonant annihilation of hypothetical ultra - high energy cosmic neutrino ( uhec@xmath0 ) beams on the c@xmath0b as a target .",
    "supposing such beams exist , the annihilation process @xmath7 proceeds at the resonance energy @xmath8 with a cross section enhanced by several orders of magnitude compared to non - resonant scattering , and @xmath9 is a function of the neutrino and the @xmath1 masses , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , alone . the annihilation can be detected as absorption dips in the incident uhec@xmath0 flux at @xmath12 ( `` @xmath1-dips '' ) @xcite and/or as emission features in the @xmath1-decay products ( nucleons and photons ) @xcite .",
    "indeed , in the latter case , the happy coincidence between @xmath13 ( for @xmath14 ) and the energies of the most energetic cosmic rays observed by agasa @xcite , fly s eye @xcite , hires @xcite , yakutsk @xcite , and haverah park @xcite has long led to a possible identification of ultra - high energy cosmic rays ( uhecr ) above the greisen ",
    "zatsepin  kuzmin ( gzk ) cut - off energy @xmath15 @xcite with @xmath1-burst nucleons and photons @xcite .    clearly , the success of the @xmath1-burst mechanism as a means to detect the c@xmath0b and/or as an explanation of uhecr depends first and foremost on the uhec@xmath0 fluxes ( the beam ) ; figures [ fig : current_future ] and [ fig : road ] summarise the current status of the search for such fluxes , the projected sensitivities of ongoing and planned experiments , and predictions from various theoretical models .",
    "a second factor is the nature of the c@xmath0b density distribution ( the target ) . to this end",
    ", it is important to note that an oscillation interpretation of the atmospheric and solar neutrino data ( e.g. , @xcite ) implies that at least two of the mass eigenstates in the c@xmath0b are nonrelativistic today , i.e. , @xmath16 , and at least one mass must exceed @xmath17 .",
    "these nonrelativistic neutrinos are subject to gravitational clustering on existing cold dark matter ( cdm ) and baryonic structures , possibly causing the local c@xmath0b density to depart from the cosmological average .",
    "standard large - scale structure theories tell us that , in the currently favoured @xmath18cdm cosmology , @xmath19 , fluctuations in the c@xmath0b ought to track their cdm counterparts at scales above the neutrino free - streaming length ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the inferred local large - scale matter distribution from peculiar velocity measurements @xcite therefore precludes any increase in the relic neutrino content of the local gzk zone ( @xmath20 ) by more than a factor of two due to gravitational clustering alone @xcite .",
    "however , clustering in local gravitational potential wells such as galaxies and galaxy clusters may still be sizeable on the sub - mpc to mpc scale .",
    "indeed , for neutrino masses satisfying experimental and cosmological bounds , , depend on the data sets used and the priors assumed .",
    "for example , analyses including also the lyman @xmath21 data and information on the dark matter  galaxy bias tend to produce bounds that are much tighter than those derived from the shape of @xmath22 alone",
    ". furthermore , the neutrino mass appears in combination with several other uncertain cosmological parameters in the determination of @xmath22 , such as a running scalar spectral index @xmath23 and the effective number of thermalised fermionic degrees of freedom @xmath24 .",
    "these degeneracies can lead to considerable relaxation in the bound on @xmath10 . in the present work , we take a conservative upper limit of @xmath25 @xcite for three degenerate neutrinos , derived from the sdss galaxy power spectrum @xcite and the wmap data @xcite assuming a constant @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "laboratory bounds from tritium @xmath28-decay experiments , @xmath29 @xcite , and from neutrinoless double beta decay , @xmath30  ev  @xcite , are not yet competitive .",
    "see the reviews @xcite . ]",
    "detailed calculations show that the c@xmath0b overdensities in the largest galaxy clusters ( @xmath31 ) can be as much as a thousand within the central @xmath32 region .",
    "an immediate consequence for the @xmath1-burst scenario is a possible directional dependence in its emission features , even if the uhec@xmath0 sources are isotropically distributed ; the highest number of @xmath1-burst events should originate from the directions of nearby galaxy clusters .",
    "= 8.5 cm    the implications of gravitational neutrino clustering for the @xmath1-burst emission spectra were first investigated quantitatively in reference . in the present paper , we extend the said analysis in several ways :    1 .",
    "we present a more accurate determination of the c@xmath0b overdensities in and around galaxies and galaxy clusters based on the calculations of reference @xcite , which take into account nonlinear effects in the clustering process .",
    "the linearised method adopted in systematically underestimates the overdensities by a factor of several particularly in the virialised region of large galaxy clusters .",
    "we compute both the primary nucleon and photon spectra .",
    "a generic feature of the @xmath1-burst scenario is a photon to nucleon ratio of almost 20:1 at the @xmath1 production site .",
    "this ratio is greatly reduced upon arrival at earth because of the much shorter attenuation length for photons than for nucleons . still , unless the photons are heavily attenuated by a strong universal radio background ( urb ) and/or by strong extragalactic magnetic fields ( @xmath33 ) ,",
    "we expect a predominance of photons in the observed primaries .",
    "3 .   as in",
    ", we assess the experimental prospects for observing enhanced @xmath1-burst rates from nearby galaxy clusters , focussing on our nearest neighbour : virgo . at an average distance of @xmath34 from the milky way and with a mass close to @xmath35 @xcite ,",
    "the virgo cluster is able to accumulate a sizeable excess of relic neutrinos while sitting close enough such that the @xmath1-burst primaries suffer minimal energy loss during their propagation to earth .",
    "if clustering - enhanced @xmath1-bursts were to be seen at all , the virgo cluster would be the prime site .    for rate estimates",
    ", we shall take the extreme universe space observatory ( euso ) experiment @xcite as our fiducial detector .",
    "the sensitivity of euso to uhecr and uhec@xmath0 above @xmath36  ev is about three orders of magnitude beyond what is available to date from agasa and hires .",
    "as presently designed , euso will consist of a two - metre fresnel lens positioned on the international space station at a height of 400 km .",
    "the lens will focus near - uv fluorescence emitted by radial de - excitation of @xmath37 in the air shower .",
    "euso operates as a space - based eye looking for tracks in one gigantic cloud chamber : the earth s atmosphere .",
    "the lens opening angle will be @xmath38 , giving the instrument an enormous field of view ( fov ) , @xmath39 .",
    "since the atmospheric density decreases exponentially with altitude with an 8 km scale - height , the euso fov encompasses an equivalent of @xmath40 of air at surface density , corresponding to more than a teraton of mass .",
    "= 8.5 cm    due to the thin height of the earth s atmosphere , the distance @xmath41 between the euso lens and the observable air shower is highly constrained . for a shower directly below the lens , @xmath42 to within a few percent",
    "; for an event on the periphery of the fov , @xmath41 increases by only @xmath43 .",
    "thus , the energy threshold for euso , determined by the @xmath44 fall - off of signal , is quite sharp . in its presently planned configuration ,",
    "the threshold of euso is a few times @xmath45  ev , fortuitously positioned to observe the region at and above the gzk cut - off .",
    "the duration of the euso experiment is nominally three years , but extensions beyond that seem likely . on the other hand",
    ", the smaller auger project @xcite will likely collect data for a decade , so that its exposure ( product of acceptance and time ) may come to rival that of euso .",
    "unfortunately , the present configuration for auger is limited to the southern hemisphere , casting a blind eye in the direction of virgo .",
    "other existing cosmic ray facilities are not competitive with the size of the euso fov .",
    "the angular resolution expected for euso showers is about one degree , or 20  mrad .",
    "other neutrino telescopes also offer similar resolutions .",
    "as we shall show later , the c@xmath0b `` halo '' expected for the virgo cluster spans several to ten degrees , so a one - degree resolution is sufficiently fine for the task at hand .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section [ sec : emission ]",
    "we describe the calculational procedure for the @xmath1-burst fluxes .",
    "section [ sec : nu ] discusses the modelling of the c@xmath0b density distribution .",
    "our predictions for the @xmath1-burst fluxes originating from the virgo cluster and the corresponding event rates expected at euso are presented in sections [ sec : fluxes ] and [ sec : events ] respectively .",
    "we conclude in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",

    "if neutrinos are majorana particles , as is predicted by the most neutrino mass models , then all c@xmath0b spin states will participate in annihilation , and equation ( [ eq : flux ] ) is correct as written .",
    "however , if neutrinos are dirac particles , then half of the nonrelativistic spin states are `` sterile '' states , and the rate presented in ( [ eq : flux ] ) should be reduced by a half . ]",
    "since the cross section @xmath64 is sharply peaked at the resonance energy @xmath71 , we may approximate @xmath72 where the superscript `` res '' denotes resonance , and @xmath73 is the energy - averaged @xmath74-channel @xmath1-exchange annihilation cross section .",

    "furthermore , we take @xmath82 , and @xmath83 , while at the same time driving one of @xmath84 or @xmath85 to zero exponentially .",
    "this has the curious consequence of increasing the @xmath1-burst rate , but not necessarily the @xmath1-dip depth .",
    "for the latter , the severe suppression of @xmath84 or @xmath85 in the c@xmath0b gives an asymptotic depth of one half for the @xmath1-dip .",
    "of course , the increased number of events concomitant with a neutrino  antineutrino asymmetry improves the statistics of the dip . ] since significant relic neutrino  antineutrino asymmetries ( @xmath86 ) are incompatible with big bang nucleosynthesis in the presence of bi - large mixing inferred from the solar and atmospheric neutrino experiments @xcite . and @xmath87 neutrino  antineutrino asymmetries are applicable insofar as large - angle @xmath88 oscillations are operational prior to neutrino decoupling . an obvious way to evade these bounds is to suppress these oscillations by way of new , non - standard matter effects .",

    "the decay process inevitably generates also photons and/or electrons with an energy fluence comparable to that of the neutrinos .",
    "subsequent em cascades via collisions with the diffuse extragalactic photon background , notably the cmb , bring the cascade photons into the energy range @xmath138 probed by egret @xcite .",

    "a lower integration limit of @xmath144 has been imposed in the evaluation of @xmath145 , since no known sources reside within this distance .",

    "in such a case , the associated @xmath1-dips @xcite in the incident uhec@xmath0 flux will also have been resolved by the next generation of dedicated uhec@xmath0 detectors such as anita in the same time frame .",
    "remarkably , viable uhec@xmath0 fluxes and neutrino masses in the @xmath204  ev ballpark are also able to produce the correct amount of @xmath1-burst nucleons and photons to explain the cosmic ray events observed by agasa at energies above the gzk cut - off .",
    "it is interesting to note that if euso , or any successor experiment , succeeds in measuring @xmath1-bursts _ and _ the diffuse uhec@xmath0 rate at @xmath205 , then the neutrino  nucleon cross section @xmath206 can be inferred at @xmath207  ev , far above energies available to terrestrial accelerators .",
    "the ratio of the @xmath1-burst rate and the diffuse uhec@xmath0 rate is independent of the flux , but dependent on the two cross sections , @xmath208 and @xmath206 .",
    "the former is determined purely by weak interaction physics to be 40.4  nb , leaving only @xmath206 , which depends on the qcd dynamics of the nucleon , as the unknown variable .      for transparent sources , the em cascade limit on the uhec@xmath0 fluxes applies , thereby excluding @xmath1-burst emissions as an explanation of the agasa post - gzk excess ( cf .",
    "figure [ fig : road ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , euso has a projected exposure three orders of magnitude larger than the exposures of existing experiments ; one may therefore hope for the eventual discovery of @xmath1-burst events in the future , even if @xmath1-bursts are not the source of the agasa events .",
    "however , with a cascade limited uhec@xmath0 flux , the observation of @xmath1-burst rates in the direction of virgo seems difficult to realise even with three years of euso .",
    "this remains true even with the substantial clustering enhancement available to quasi - degenerate neutrinos ( figure [ fig : cascade ] ) .",
    "better statistics may be achievable by widening the solid angle about virgo , but inevitably at the expense of narrowing the tell - tale gap between the clustered and unclustered rates . furthermore , to pursue this low signal - to - noise scenario",
    ", one would likely require a more accurate modelling of gravitational neutrino clustering in the local universe  something beyond our simple halo description .",
    "all in all , a larger experiment is required .",
    "the owl and multi - owl proposals @xcite would put ( multi ) satellites into orbit , to provide a fov that dwarfs even euso .",
    "experiments using low - frequency radio antenna arrays ( lofars ) have also been proposed .",
    "the prototype for this kind of detector has just reported positive identification of uhecr @xcite .",
    "the westerbork @xcite lofar facility in the netherlands may offer the potential to improve the event rates of uhecr and uhec@xmath0 by two or more orders of magnitude beyond euso .",
    "suppose the uhec@xmath0 flux comes from transparent sources , in which case it is cascade limited and can not explain the post - gzk events in agasa .",
    "further suppose that the post - gzk agasa spectrum and rate are correct .",
    "then , is the `` background - free '' window for neutrino physics above @xmath209 closed ?",
    "the answer is , not necessarily , if the c@xmath0b does cluster sufficiently . in figure",
    "[ fig : zburst_vs_agasa ] , we show events in the energy interval @xmath170 and in a @xmath168 solid angle , projected for three years of euso observations , assuming the apparent post - gzk agasa flux ( assumed to be isotropic ) .",
    "this is to be compared with the clustering - enhanced @xmath1-burst emissions from the virgo cluster , also shown .",
    "the latter constitute up to @xmath210 and @xmath211 of the projected primary events for @xmath212 and @xmath213 , respectively , and dominate , albeit at a lower rate , beyond @xmath214  ev .",
    "thus , detecting @xmath1-burst emissions with an observatory larger than euso , even in the face of less than optimal uhec@xmath0 fluxes and a possible post - gzk cosmic ray background , may not be entirely hopeless if the c@xmath0b clusters appreciably .    = 8.5 cm",
    "resonant annihilation of ultra - high energy cosmic neutrinos ( uhec@xmath0 ) on the cosmic neutrino background ( c@xmath0b ) into @xmath1 bosons ",
    "the @xmath1-burst mechanism  is a unique , albeit indirect , process capable of revealing the c@xmath0b in its present state .",
    "the annihilation can be detected as absorption dips in the incident uhec@xmath0 flux and/or as emission features in the @xmath1-decay products ( nucleons and photons ) at energies above the greisen ",
    "zatsepin  kuzmin ( gzk ) cut - off .",
    "general @xmath1-burst absorption and emission phenomenology , including the possibility that @xmath1-decay products may constitute the post - gzk ultra - high energy cosmic ray ( uhecr ) events observed by agasa , has been investigated in a number of recent publications . in the present work ,",
    "we have considered exclusively the implications of a non - uniform c@xmath0b for the @xmath1-burst emission rates and sky map . in particular , we have focussed on the effects of augmentations to the c@xmath0b number density in and around large galaxy clusters due to gravitational clustering , and the potential of future cosmic ray experiments , especially the extreme universe space observatory ( euso ) , to observe clustering - enhanced @xmath1-burst emission rates originating from the nearby virgo cluster .    the gzk suppression of nucleons from extragalactic sources provides a clean environment for the study of @xmath1-burst initiated events at energies above @xmath215 . indeed , for uhec@xmath0 fluxes saturating the electromagnetic cascade limit , @xmath1-burst nucleon and photon fluxes originating from a uniform c@xmath0b already dominate at these energies .",
    "gravitational c@xmath0b clustering at the virgo cluster further enhances the fluxes by up to a factor of several to more than forty , depending on the neutrino mass , at the centre of the cluster ( figure [ fig : virgo_fluxes ] ) .",
    "the enhancement decreases with angular distance from the centre in a manner highly sensitive to the neutrino mass ( figure [ fig : intflux ] ) .",
    "this angular dependence of the emission events can in principle serve as an independent probe of the neutrino mass , the shape of the virgo halo , as well as the @xmath1-burst mechanism as a whole .    however , the statistics of @xmath1-burst observation is necessarily limited by the magnitude of the available uhec@xmath0 flux . for three years of euso observations , we find that a detection of clustering - enhanced @xmath1-burst rates from the virgo cluster is probable , provided that the uhec@xmath0 fluxes are close to current observational limits ( figure [ fig : obs ] ) .",
    "sources capable of generating such large fluxes will most likely involve physics beyond the standard model .",
    "a quasi - degenerate neutrino mass spectrum is also desirable , since gravitational clustering is considerably more efficient for `` large '' neutrino masses , @xmath2 ( figure [ fig : ov_dens ] ) . under these favourable conditions",
    ", one would also expect the associated absorption dips in the incident uhec@xmath0 flux to be resolved by euso and/or other forthcoming dedicated uhec@xmath0 detectors .    in the case of less than optimal uhec@xmath0 fluxes , e.g. , fluxes below the electromagnetic cascade limit , or a hierarchical neutrino mass spectrum",
    ", the observation of enhanced @xmath1-burst rates in the direction of virgo seems to require an experimental sensitivity exceeding that of euso by at least two orders of magnitude ( figure [ fig : cascade ] ) .",
    "the westerbork radio observatory in the netherlands offers a tremendous new reach in uhec@xmath0 and uhecr detection by looking for signals of their interactions with the lunar regolith . if it establishes a uhec@xmath0 flux at energies above @xmath216 , then the final uncertainty in the @xmath1-burst mechanism is removed .",
    "this allows definite predictions to be made for associated @xmath1-burst emissions from the virgo cluster .",
    "such measurements would finally establish the existence ( or not ) of the cosmic neutrino background .",
