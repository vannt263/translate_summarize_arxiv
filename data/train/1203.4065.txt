    "applied scientists frequently deal with attributes defined on continuous spatial domains . in this framework , if the design - based approach is assumed , the target attribute may be expressed as a fixed bounded function @xmath0 taking values on the study region @xmath1 ( a suitable subset of the plane ) . in the simplest case",
    ", @xmath2 may represent the value of the attribute at @xmath3 . as an example , in an environmental survey , @xmath2 could be the air - borne pollutant level at the sample site @xmath4 on a landscape . in a more structured setting , @xmath2 may also describe the `` attribute density '' arising from the selected spatial sampling design [ this topic is extensively considered and explained in chapter 10 of @xcite ] . as an example , by supposing a fixed - radius circular plot sampling in a forest survey , @xmath2 could represent the number of trees lying in the plot centered at the sample site @xmath4 [ up to a known proportionality constant ; see @xcite , pages 328332 ] . in this case , under the design - based approach",
    ", the population universe is constituted by a _ continuum _ ( ideally by the noncountable set of sample sites on @xmath1 ) and the inference is actually carried out by assuming the so - called `` continuous - population '' paradigm .",
    "this approach has been extensively considered in recent years on the basis of the seminal papers by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .    in the described framework",
    ", the estimation goal is usually focused on the spatial total , that is , @xmath5 [ see , e.g. , @xcite and chapter 10 of @xcite ] . indeed , as emphasized by @xcite , the integral representation in ( [ 11 ] ) embraces a general family of population parameters , such as means , proportions or distribution functions . in order to estimate @xmath6 ,",
    "the key problem of the design - based approach is the selection of an appropriate sampling strategy . as usual",
    ", it is assumed that the sampling strategy includes the joint selection of a suitable estimator and the corresponding scheme for the placement of the @xmath7 sample sites on the study region @xmath1 .",
    "since an integral representation for @xmath6 holds , it is quite evident that the estimation problem may be rephrased in terms of the monte carlo integration theory .",
    "interestingly , known monte carlo integration strategies are equivalent to the sampling strategies which are commonly adopted in environmental and ecological studies [ barabesi ( @xcite , @xcite ) , @xcite , page  327 ] .",
    "similar monte carlo integration approaches to parameter estimation occur in very different research areas , such as in stereology [ see , e.g. , the monograph by @xcite ] or in computer graphics [ see , e.g. , @xcite ] .    the basic reference sampling scheme for selecting the sample sites is the uniform random sampling ( urs ) , which constitutes the continuous - population analog to simple random sampling from a finite population [ @xcite ] . under urs ,",
    "the @xmath7 sample sites are independently and uniformly selected on @xmath1 [ figure  [ f1](a ) ] . despite its simplicity",
    ", urs may be not suitable in practice since it may produce an uneven coverage of the study region and the corresponding unbiased estimator of @xmath6 displays a variance of order @xmath8 , that is , the variance decreases to @xmath9 at the rate @xmath8 as @xmath10 . in any case , urs is often considered a helpful benchmark to compare the performance of more refined schemes .     sample sites over a study region @xmath1 according to the urs scheme , the tss scheme , the sgs scheme and the ss scheme based on equal - size strata obtained by means of the brus , sptjens and de  gruijter ( @xcite ) algorithm .",
    "for the tss and sgs schemes , the set @xmath11 is chosen as a rectangle and the tessellation is based on squares , while @xmath7 represents the mean number of sample sites in @xmath1 . ]    in order to overcome the drawbacks involved with urs , a sampling scheme frequently adopted in environmental studies is the so - called tessellation stratified sampling ( tss ) [ see , e.g. , @xcite and the @xcite , page 63 ] . the tss scheme is initially implemented by superimposing a suitable set @xmath11 onto the study region in such a way that @xmath12 and by introducing the analytical extension @xmath13 of @xmath0 on @xmath11 .",
    "formally , the analytical extension is defined as @xmath14 if @xmath15 and @xmath16 if @xmath17 .",
    "obviously , in this setting ( [ 11 ] ) may be conveniently rewritten as @xmath18 .",
    "subsequently , a regular tessellation of  @xmath11 is carried out and one sample site is independently and uniformly selected in each tessellation element [ figure [ f1](b ) ] .",
    "the theoretical properties of the tss scheme have been explained in detail [ barabesi and marcheselli ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) ] .",
    "the scheme gives rise to an unbiased estimator for  @xmath6 with variance of order @xmath19 , where @xmath20 $ ] .",
    "hence , the estimator under tss is `` superefficient '' since its variance decreases to @xmath9 faster than the variance of the estimator under urs as @xmath10 .",
    "the parameter @xmath21 depends on the degree of regularity of the analytical extension @xmath13 : for instance , it turns out that @xmath22 for smooth functions , but it can occur that @xmath23 even for noncontinuous and rather irregular functions [ barabesi and marcheselli ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) ] . hence , the variance of the estimator for @xmath6 decreases to @xmath9 faster as @xmath13 becomes more regular .",
    "in addition , consistent variance estimation is available if @xmath13 is a differentiable function on @xmath11 [ barabesi and marcheselli ( @xcite , @xcite ) ] . in order to avoid the difficulties involved in the variance estimation ,",
    "@xcite and @xcite suggest modifying the tss scheme by randomly shifting the tessellation .",
    "the randomized tss scheme does not involve extra - sampling effort and allows for unbiased variance estimation without any restriction on the function @xmath13 [ @xcite ] , even if the consistency of the variance estimator has not been proved .",
    "@xcite show that the tss scheme and its randomized modification produce estimators for @xmath6 with identical variance convergence rates .",
    "a further frequently - considered scheme is systematic grid sampling(sgs ) , which constitutes a systematic version of the tss scheme [ see , e.g. , @xcite and the @xcite , page 70 ] .",
    "the sgs scheme provides the continuous - population analog to systematic sampling from a finite population as considered by @xcite [ see also @xcite , as to systematic sampling of a spatial finite population ] . similarly to tss , the sgs scheme requires a regular tessellation of @xmath11 and the extension of the function @xmath0 on @xmath11 .",
    "however , under sgs , a sample site is uniformly generated in the reference tessellation element and it is systematically repeated in the other tessellation elements [ see figure [ f1](c ) ] . the sgs scheme is commonly adopted in stereology and gives rise to an unbiased `` superefficient '' estimator for  @xmath6 , under certain smoothness conditions on @xmath13 [ @xcite , @xcite , page 159 ] .",
    "however , the variance of the estimator tends to be extremely elevated when the periodicity in the function  @xmath13 is `` in phase '' with the tessellation elements [ @xcite , chapter 13 ] .",
    "even if the tss and sgs schemes allow for an even coverage of the study region and give rise to unbiased `` superefficient '' estimation for @xmath6 , these schemes suffer due to two main technical drawbacks which are related to the analytical extension of @xmath0 on @xmath11 . indeed ,",
    "the sample sites are actually placed on @xmath11 ( not on  @xmath1 ) and , hence , the number of sample sites on @xmath1 is a  random variable , unless @xmath1 is exactly tessellated .",
    "obviously , the tessellation may be selected in such a way that the mean number of sample sites on  @xmath1 equals the prefixed sample size @xmath7 [ as an example , this procedure is adopted for figure  [ f1](b ) and  ( c ) ] .",
    "however , the task is generally undesirable for field scientists , who usually require reproducible designs .",
    "moreover , even if the function @xmath0 is regular on @xmath1 , the function @xmath13 is likely to be not continuous on the boundary of @xmath1 ( and hence on @xmath11 ) , unless @xmath0 is null on this boundary .",
    "as previously explained , the lack of regularity considerably reduces the efficiency of the estimators for @xmath6 .    an alternative way to face the whole setting",
    "may be based on stratification methods involving the `` one - per - stratum '' placement of the sample sites .",
    "more precisely , under the `` one - per - stratum '' stratified sampling ( ss ) , the study region @xmath1 is partitioned into @xmath7 suitable strata and one sample site is independently and uniformly selected in each stratum [ figure [ f1](d ) ] .",
    "the scheme constitutes the continuous - population counterpart to the classic `` one - per - stratum '' stratified sampling in the finite - population setting [ see , e.g. , @xcite ] .",
    "moreover , the ss scheme generalizes the tss scheme when @xmath1 coincides with @xmath11 and the tessellation is noncongruent .",
    "the scheme is commonly adopted for environmental and agricultural surveys [ see , e.g. , @xcite and the references therein ] .    in this paper , it is proven that the ss scheme produces an unbiased `` superefficient '' estimator for @xmath6 , which shares the variance properties of the estimator under the tss scheme . however , in contrast with the tss and sgs schemes , when the ss scheme is adopted the @xmath7 sample sites are exactly placed on @xmath1 and no analytical extension of @xmath0 is introduced . moreover , in real surveys spatial stratification is often demanded in practice , owing to geographical or administrative convenience and tessellation - based methods would not be applicable .",
    "in addition , there exist ad hoc algorithms for partitioning the study region into strata ( eventually of the same size ) with suitable geometrical and statistical properties [ @xcite , @xcite ] .",
    "finally , even if schemes with more than a single sample site per stratum may be considered , it is apparent that the benefits arising from the full force of the stratification are achieved by adopting the `` one - per - stratum '' allocation . in any case , the `` two - per - stratum '' scheme will be briefly considered since it produces unbiased and consistent variance estimation .    even if the achieved results may be applied to a broad range of different data sets collected on a continuous spatial domain , the motivating practical setting of the paper originates from an experiment dealing with canopy coverage estimation in the monterano nature reserve . owing to the complex boundary mosaic of this forest ,",
    "the estimation approach based on forest polygon delineation and area mensuration in the gis environment may produce omission and commission errors ( which tend to be systematic ) in the image interpretation . in order to overcome these shortcomings , a survey procedure based on line - intercept sampling which just involves the measurement of the intersections of linear transects with forest patches",
    "is considered . as to the monterano nature reserve ,",
    "forest researchers collected data by placing transect midpoints according to the ss scheme with equal - size strata by means of the @xcite . hence",
    ", the results of this paper may be suitably applied in order to provide point and interval estimation of canopy coverage .",
    "as pointed out in the , the benchmark for comparing different schemes is the urs and , hence , spatial total estimation under this scheme is briefly described . if @xmath24 are @xmath7 i.i.d .",
    "random variables representing the sample - site locations , in such a way that each @xmath25 is uniformly distributed on @xmath1 , the usual unbiased estimator for @xmath6 under urs [ see , e.g. , @xcite ] is @xmath26 where @xmath27 denotes the area of a set in @xmath28 ( technically , @xmath29 represents the lebesgue measure in @xmath28 ) . the variance of the estimator in ( [ 21 ] )",
    "is given by @xmath30=\\frac{1}{n } \\bigl(a(a)s - t^2\\bigr),\\ ] ] where @xmath31 , and , hence , it turns out that @xmath32=o(n^{-1})$ ] . as usual ,",
    "if @xmath33 and @xmath34 represent two positive sequences , @xmath35 means that the ratio @xmath36 is bounded for all @xmath7 .    under the ss scheme , the study region @xmath1",
    "is partitioned in @xmath7 strata  @xmath37 , in such a way that each stratum is connected and compact ( in a topological sense ) , and one sample - site location is independently and uniformly selected in each stratum .",
    "therefore , let us suppose that the sample - site locations are represented by the random variables @xmath38 . according to the continuous horvitz  thompson theorem [ @xcite ] , an unbiased estimator for ( [ 11 ] ) under ss is @xmath39 with variance @xmath40=\\sum_{i=1}^na(a_i)^2 \\operatorname{var}[y(v_i)]=\\sum_{i=1}^na(a_i)s_i-\\sum_{i=1}^nt_i^2,\\ ] ] where @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "in order to assess the variance properties of the estimator in ( [ 22 ] ) , let us assume that @xmath0 is a hlder function on @xmath1 , that is , a function satisfying the condition @xmath43 where @xmath44 , @xmath45 $ ] and @xmath46 , while denotes the usual norm in @xmath28 , that is , @xmath47 denotes the distance between the points @xmath4 and @xmath48 .",
    "obviously , @xmath0  reduces to a lipschitz function for the special case @xmath49 .",
    "the family of hlder functions is very large [ for more details , see , e.g. , @xcite , page 254 ] .",
    "indeed , it is at once apparent that hlder functions are continuous .",
    "in addition , from the above definition , it also follows that the family of hlder functions contains the family of lipschitz functions , which in turn contains the family of continuously differentiable functions . informally speaking",
    ", the hlder condition quantifies the local variation of the function @xmath0 , in such a way that the index @xmath50 may be interpreted as the corresponding `` degree of local continuity . ''",
    "hence , the family of hlder functions encompasses `` smooth '' functions , as well as functions displaying a very irregular behavior . as a matter of fact , there exist hlder functions which are continuous , but nowhere differentiable .    by assuming that @xmath51 represents the diameter of a given set @xmath52 , that is , the largest distance between two points in @xmath52 , let @xmath53 be the maximum diameter of the @xmath54 s .",
    "hence , let us consider the condition @xmath55 where @xmath56 is a bounded constant .",
    "since @xmath57 condition ( [ 23 ] ) implies that @xmath58 in addition , let us also consider the condition @xmath59 where @xmath60 is a bounded constant .",
    "it should be remarked that condition  ( [ 23 ] ) simply requires that the stratification be performed by assuming quite `` homogeneous '' strata , that is , avoiding strata having `` stretched '' shapes and in such a way that no `` large '' strata are admitted as @xmath61 . in addition , condition ( [ 24 ] ) actually ensures that too `` small '' strata are in turn avoided as @xmath10 .",
    "these requirements are likely to hold for practical choices of @xmath62 .",
    "obviously , condition ( [ 24 ] ) is always satisfied with equal - size strata , that is , when @xmath63 for @xmath64 .    on the basis of result [ result1 ] in the , by assuming that @xmath0 is a hlder function and that condition ( [ 23 ] ) holds",
    ", it turns out that @xmath65 hence , the ss scheme may lead to a noticeable estimation improvement with respect to the basic urs scheme .",
    "the best variance order @xmath66 is achieved when @xmath0 is a lipschitz function . in any case",
    ", the ss scheme produces more efficient estimation with respect to urs for each @xmath50 value as @xmath10 .",
    "the gain may be remarkable since in many real surveys @xmath50 is likely to be about one  for example , as to the canopy coverage estimation considered in section [ sec4 ] ; see the discussion after the formula in ( [ 41 ] ) .",
    "the achieved variance properties may be extended to a larger class of functions .",
    "more precisely , let @xmath0 be a piecewise hlder function on @xmath1 , that is , there exists a finite partition of @xmath1 in such a way that  @xmath0 is a hlder function on each partition element and the partition boundary is rectifiable , that is , in practical terms the boundary is `` smooth . ''",
    "this setting is of real interest , since  @xmath0 often belongs to this function family when  @xmath0 represents the `` attribute density '' as defined in the .",
    "thus , by assuming that  @xmath0 is a piecewise hlder function and that condition ( [ 23 ] ) holds , on the basis of result [ result2 ] in the , it turns out that @xmath67 hence , even if the gain is lessened owing to the discontinuity of the function  @xmath0 , the performance of the ss scheme is in turn considerable . in this case ,",
    "the best variance order @xmath68 is achieved when @xmath0 is a piecewise hlder function with @xmath69 . in turn , the ss scheme is preferable with respect to the urs scheme for each @xmath50 .    as to the large - sample normality of the estimator in ( [ 22 ] ) , on the basis of result  [ result3 ] in the , by assuming that @xmath0 is a hlder function and that conditions in ( [ 23 ] ) and in ( [ 24 ] ) hold , it follows that @xmath70 as @xmath10 .",
    "this convergence result holds even if @xmath0 is a piecewise hlder function ( see remark [ remark2 ] in the ) .",
    "these findings on the variance properties and the large - sample normality of the estimator in ( [ 22 ] ) are in complete agreement with the results obtained by barabesi and marcheselli ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) and @xcite under tss .",
    "indeed , the tss scheme may be considered a special case of the ss scheme when @xmath1 coincides with @xmath11 and the strata correspond to the elements of the tessellation.=-1    it should be finally emphasized that for each @xmath7 the variance of the estimator under urs is greater than or equal to the variance of the estimator under ss when the strata are of the same size , that is , it holds that @xmath30\\geq\\operatorname{var}[\\widehat{t}_n].\\ ] ] indeed , in this case the previous inequality is verified since @xmath71 and @xmath72 , while the inequality @xmath73 obviously holds .",
    "the estimation of @xmath74 is not a trivial task , since a single observation per stratum is available and the strata generally do not constitute a regular tessellation , that is , the strata display different sizes and shapes .",
    "in such a setting , estimators relying on contrast - based techniques  such as the proposals by barabesi and marcheselli ( @xcite , @xcite ) under tss or the proposal by @xcite under randomized tss  seem quite difficult to implement .",
    "however , a simple estimator may be obtained by treating the sample as if it were obtained under the urs scheme .",

    "for example , in the case study contained in section [ sec4 ] , the partition elements are equally - sized strata which are indexed in such a way that the @xmath88th and the @xmath89th strata have a  side in common ( see figure [ f2 ] ) .",

    "in order to illustrate an application of the ss scheme in an environmental survey , the estimation of the canopy coverage in the monterano nature reserve has been considered . the monterano nature reserve ( which constitutes the study region @xmath1 in this case )",

    "@xcite remark that if the boundary of @xmath111 is rectifiable , @xmath0 is a hlder function .",

    "even if the canopy coverage could be estimated by means of polygon delineation on the basis of visual interpretation of remotely sensed imagery , the procedure may typically produce errors and omissions [ see , e.g. , @xcite ] .",
    "so , in order to avoid the interpretation drawbacks in the estimation of forest features such as forest ecotone or canopy coverage , @xcite suggest adopting replicated line - intercept sampling .",
    "hence , for estimating canopy coverage in the monterano nature reserve , the replicated line - intercept sampling protocol has been implemented by assuming the described procedure with @xmath123 transects with fixed direction and length @xmath124 m [ these choices are consistent with the study by @xcite ] . the transect midpoints ( displayed in figure [ f2 ] ) have been placed by adopting the ss scheme with equal - size strata obtained by using the @xcite algorithm . in this case , the estimator in ( [ 41 ] ) has given rise to the estimate @xmath125 ha for the canopy coverage .",
    "hence , @xmath126% of the monterano nature reserve is covered by vegetation .",
    "in addition , variance estimation has been performed on the basis of ( [ 32 ] ) by adopting a sequential indexing of strata with a common side ( see figure [ f2 ] ) .",
    "accordingly , the standard deviation estimate is @xmath127 ha and a conservative confidence interval for canopy coverage at the approximate @xmath128% confidence level is @xmath129 .",

    "under the design - based approach , the target attribute of many surveys can be conceptualized as a suitable fixed function @xmath0 defined on a given planar domain .",
    "this approach is usually described as the continuous - population paradigm and it is especially suitable in environmental and ecological frameworks [ see , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite , page 2 ] . indeed , in such spatial contexts , it is not often possible to achieve an area frame in order to apply the usual finite - population sampling theory .",
    "regrettably , practitioners frequently force the continuous - population setting into the finite - population setting , owing to the lack of results or to the misunderstanding of the continuous - population paradigm .",
    "the continuous - population paradigm requires implementation of an effective probability sampling design to estimate the target parameter , usually the total of the study attribute given by the integral of the function @xmath0 .",
    "hence , a key decision is the choice of the sampling scheme for the placement of sample sites .",
    "schemes based on tessellation and stratification are widely used in natural resource assessment and for environmental monitoring , since evenly - spread sample sites over the study region often simplify collection of field data and estimation efficiency is usually increased . however , as emphasized by @xcite , schemes based on tessellation methods may involve several drawbacks and , hence , stratification schemes may often be preferable .    in the present paper",
