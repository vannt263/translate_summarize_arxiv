    "the discovery of a new satellite companion of the milky way was recently announced by @xcite , who named it the bo@xmath9tes dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) after the constellation of bo@xmath9tes in which the structure was detected .",
    "@xcite ( @xcite ) obtained spectroscopy of red and asymptotic giant branch stars in the bo@xmath9tes dsph galaxy from which they measured a very low metal abundance of [ fe / h]@xmath13 dex , confirming the results obtained by @xcite based on the galaxy color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) .",
    "this low metallicity makes of bo@xmath9tes the most metal - poor local group dsph known so far . the galaxy @xmath14 cmds published by @xcite and @xcite clearly show a horizontal branch ( hb ) that extends to the blue enough to cross the classical instability strip , thus suggesting that rr lyrae stars should be present in the bo@xmath9 dsph .",
    "rr lyrae stars have been found in all the local group dsphs where observations were deep enough to reach the hb .",
    "they trace the old stellar population ( @xmath15 gyr ) of the host system and , being standard candles , provide an invaluable tool to estimate the galaxy distance .",
    "in this letter we present @xmath0 light curves for 12 variable stars we have identified in the bo@xmath9tes dsph , periods and pulsation properties for 11 of them , and the first cmd of the galaxy in the @xmath0 bands of the johnson - cousins photometric system .",
    "our sample includes 11 of the variable stars for which @xcite ( @xcite , hereinafter s06 ) presents @xmath16 photometry and periods evaluated by fitting the observed @xmath17 light curves with rr lyrae templates by @xcite .",
    "observations and data reductions are described in section 2 .",
    "the color magnitude diagram of the bo@xmath9 dsph is presented in section 3 .",
    "identification and pulsation characteristics ( periods , amplitudes , and types ) of the variable stars are described in section 4 . in section 5",
    "we discuss the distance we derived for this new satellite of the milky way using independent methods based on the rr lyrae stars .",
    "final results are summarized in section 6 .",
    "time series @xmath0 photometry of the bo@xmath9tes dsph galaxy has been collected between april and july 2006 with bfosc at the 1.52 m telescope of the bologna observatory in loiano , and with dolores at the 3.5 m tng telescope , whereas @xmath18 observations have been gathered at the 2.3 m wyoming infrared observatory ( wiro ) telescope , using the wiro - prime ccd prime focus camera.amonson/wiro/prime.html ] in this letter we present results from the analysis of the @xmath0 data .",
    "a more extended analysis of the full dataset will be presented in a forthcoming paper . due to the different field of view of the three instrumental set - ups ,",
    "the number of phase points ranges from a minimum of 17 and 4 to a maximum of 52 and 17 in the @xmath2 and @xmath19 bands , respectively .",
    "typical internal errors of our @xmath2 band photometry for single phase points at the level of the hb are in the range from 0.01 to 0.03 mag .    images were pre - reduced following standard techniques ( bias subtraction and flat - field correction ) with iraf , and @xmath19-band images were corrected for fringing by adopting , for each instrument , a well - suited fringing map .",
    "we measured the star magnitudes by aperture photometry , since the field is not crowded and the image quality of a number of frames was not sufficient for a satisfactory psf evaluation .",
    "after a preliminary psf reduction performed with the daophotii / allstar packages @xcite , aperture photometry was carried out with a radius of 1.5 fwhm for each individual image .",
    "the absolute photometric calibration was obtained during the night of may 8 , 2006 , through the observation at the tng of standard stars in landolt field pg1633 @xcite as extended by p.b .",
    "stetson . for the atmospheric extinction coefficient",
    ", we adopted the average value for la palma .",
    "a total number of 67 standard stars covering approximately the color interval 0.6@xmath20 2.7 were used to derive the calibration equations which have @xmath210.016 and @xmath40.019 mag scatter , in @xmath2 and @xmath19 , respectively .",
    "the derived color terms are in good agreement with those found on the dolores@tng web page and in the literature . since the aperture photometry of the standard stars was performed with an aperture radius of 5.5 arcsec , we derived a correction for the ( smaller ) aperture used in the two reference scientific frames .",
    "this correction is 0.06 and 0.07 @xmath22 mag in @xmath2 and @xmath19 , respectively .",
    "the total uncertainty of our photometry is @xmath23=0.035 mag and @xmath24=0.04 mag , in @xmath2 and @xmath19 , respectively .",
    "the @xmath25 cmd of the bo@xmath9tes dsph is shown in figure 1 .",
    "the two lines are the mean ridge lines of the globular clusters ( gcs ) m15 ( solid line ) and m3 ( dashed line ) , drawn from the cluster s cmds available at padua university web site , and shifted in magnitude and color to fit the galaxy hb .",
    "the bo@xmath9tes red giant branch ( rgb ) is very well fitted by a metal - poor cluster like m15 ( [ fe / h]@xmath26 ) , thus supporting the low metal abundance derived for the galaxy by @xcite . a low metal abundance in the range from @xmath27 , to @xmath5 dex",
    "is also suggested by the location in the petersen diagram of a double mode pulsator we have identified in the galaxy , ( see section 5 ) .",
    "if we adopt for the galaxy the distance modulus we infer from the average luminosity of the rr lyrae stars ( see section 5 ) and adopt the @xcite calibration of the tip @xmath19 luminosity , we estimate that the galaxy rgb tip is at @xmath19=15.40 mag for [ fe / h]=@xmath5 .",
    "bo@xmath9tes brightest star in our cmd is v16 at @xmath2=15.97 and @xmath19=14.60 , hence about 0.8 mag above the galaxy tip .",
    "variable stars were identified from the @xmath2 band time series where we have a larger number of phase points and then counter - identified in @xmath19 .",
    "first we calculated the fourier transform ( in @xcite formulation ) for each star in the photometric catalog with at least 12 epochs , then we averaged this transform to estimate the noise and calculated the signal - to - noise ratios .",
    "we then checked all the stars with high s / n , that for the rr lyrae stars typically went from 25 to 160 .",
    "coordinates for the variable stars were obtained cross correlating our catalog with the catalog mast / casg available at http://www-gsss.stsci.edu .",
    "the r.m.s of the cross correlation is 0.07 arcsec for both coordinates .",
    "all the rr lyrae stars in our sample are also in the s06 database , while s06 s v1 , v7 , v11 and v13 are outside our field of view .",
    "we were able as well to assess the variability of the bright star located close to the tip of the bo@xmath9tes rgb ( see fig .",
    "1 ) for which s06 does not provide a light curve .",
    "periods were derived using gratis ( graphycal analyzer of time series ) a custom software developed at the bologna observatory ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we were able to derive reliable periods for 11 of the 12 stars we identified in the bo@xmath9tes dsph . given the about 100 days window of our observations these periods are accurate to the fourth digit .",
    "along with the star s average luminosity , the light variation amplitude and cmd position allowed us to classify the variable star type .",
    "our sample includes 5 rrc s , 5 rrab s , 1 rrd and 1 long period variable ( lpv ) .",
    "the properties of the variable stars are summarized in table 2 .",
    "an electronic table of dates and magnitudes is available by request .",
    "examples of the light curves are shown in figure 2 , where data for the rr lyrae stars are folded using the periods and epochs of maximum light provided in table  2 .",
    "v16 turned out to be a lpv . in the 100 days spanned by our observations",
    "we only observed a portion of the star s light curve , thus only a rough estimate of the period could be obtained . in figure 2",
    "we show for v16 the sequence of observations in hjd .",
    "our periods agree with s06 s periods rounded to the second digit for 9 out of the 11 variables we have in common .",
    "however , the s06 periods , although similar to ours , do not provide the best fit to our data . furthermore , there are two remarkable differences with respect to s06 classification , namely stars : v5 and v12 .",
    "these stars have been classified by s06 respectively rrc and rrab . the s06 period for",
    "v5 ( 0.3863158 d ) does not phase our data .",
    "our best fit period for the star is 0.6506 d. a shorter period of about 0.3943 d could possibly phase our data , although with a larger scatter and it is thus considered less likely .",
    "we also find that the star has very small amplitude , on average about 0.2 smaller than other _",
    "c-_type rr lyrae stars , and is about 0.2 mag brighter than the galaxy hb . both the reduced amplitude and the overluminosity might be caused by v5 being blended with a companion star .",
    "however , additional and better resolution data would be needed to assess the star actual nature . given its peculiarities and the less certain classification in type , in the following discussion",
    "this star will always be considered separately .",
    "the most striking difference with s06 is star v12 that we find to be a double mode rr lyrae star , with periods of @xmath28=0.3948 and @xmath29=0.5296 d , and period ratio of 0.7455 d. the double mode behavior of v12 is clearly seen in figure 2 , and the star s position near the transition between _",
    "c- _ and _ ab- _ type rr lyrae stars seem to support our finding .",
    "the average periods of the rr lyrae stars are : @xmath8=0.37 d ( @xmath30=0.04 , average on 5 stars ; average and @xmath30 do not change whether we include or not the double mode star ) and @xmath31=0.69 d ( @xmath30=0.12 , average on 4 stars ) or 0.68 ( @xmath30=0.10 , average on 5 stars ) if the variable star brighter than the hb is considered .",
    "these average values and the high frequency of _ c-_type stars are consistent with the bo@xmath9tes dsph being an oosterhoff type ii system ( @xcite ) , and along with the low metal abundance make of the galaxy an analog of the ursa minor dsph galaxy .",
    "the @xmath2 period - amplitude relation of the bo@xmath9tes rr lyrae stars is shown in figure 3 and compared with the distributions of the m3 rrab stars .",
    "the 4 bo@xmath9tes _ ab-_type rr lyrae stars with certain classification ( open circles in figure 3 ) are found to lie close to the region occupied by the well - evolved m3 rrab stars ( dashed curve in figure 3 , taken from @xcite ) and the oosterhoff type ii locus . according to table 1",
    "these stars appear also to be slightly brighter than the average level of the bo@xmath9tes hb and in figure 1 lie slightly above the hb ridge lines of m15 and m3 , thus confirming they could be evolved objects . in conclusion , all the evidence agrees that the bo@xmath9tes dsph is an old , metal - poor object of oosterhoff ii class .",
    "the average luminosity of the bo@xmath9tes rr lyrae stars is @xmath32=19.546 @xmath33 ( @xmath30=0.057 , average on 10 stars ) and @xmath34=19.531 @xmath35 ( @xmath30=0.073 , average on 11 stars ) if the overluminous star is included .",
    "assuming for the absolute luminosity of the rr lyrae stars at [ fe / h]=@xmath36 @xmath37=0.59@xmath40.03 ( @xcite ) , @xmath38$]=0.214 ( @xmath4 0.047 ) mag / dex ( @xcite , @xcite ) for the slope of the luminosity metallicity relation , @xmath6=0.02 ( according to @xcite and in agreement with the small color shift required to match m15 and the bo@xmath9tes horizontal and red giant branches ) , and [ fe / h]=@xmath5 ( munoz et al .",
    "2006 ) , the galaxy distance modulus is : 19.11 @xmath4 0.08 or 19.09 @xmath4 0.08 if the overluminous variable is included , where errors include the standard deviation of the average , and the uncertainties in the photometry , reddening , and rr lyrae absolute magnitude .",
    "the presence of a double - mode rr lyrae star in boo allows us to estimate its mass , hence derive the galaxy distance , by comparing observed and predicted period ratios in the petersen diagram @xcite for double mode rr lyrae stars .",
    "@xcite published an updated version of this diagram and compared it with the pulsation models of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the position of v12 in the petersen diagram is shown in figure 4 which is an update of @xcite figure 14 .",
    "the star location in the diagram seems consistent with rrd stars in ooii clusters , and we find the star s mass is close to 0.80 @xmath39 , in agreement with the evolutionary predictions for hb stars populating the instability strip at @xmath40=0.0001 ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this mass , combined with the luminosity provided by the petersen diagram and the observed fundamental period of v12 , allows us to evaluate the star s",
    "@xmath41 from the pulsation equation .",
    "we used equation 1 in @xcite .",
    "once the mass , luminosity , and effective temperature are known , the star s absolute visual magnitude was calculated using the model atmospheres by @xcite ( @xcitea , b ) .",
    "we find @xmath37(v12)=0.52 , with a conservative error of @xmath42 0.13 mag .",
    "the corresponding distance modulus for the bo@xmath9tes dsph is then @xmath43 mag .",
    "we estimated the distance to the bo@xmath9tes system with two further independent methods : i ) the comparison of theoretical and empirical rr lyrae first overtone blue edges ( fobe ) and fundamental red edges ( fre ) in the @xmath37 versus @xmath44 plane ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) and , ii ) the theoretical wesenheit function ( see @xcite ) . > from the first technique we find that the @xcite theoretical boundaries of the instability strip ( fobe and fre ) for metal poor pulsators with mean mass of 0.80 @xmath45 match the observed rr lyrae stars in bo@xmath9tes for a distance modulus of 19.21@xmath40.10 masg .",
    "a distance modulus of @xmath46 mag is obtained instead by adopting the theoretical wesenheit relation for the same value of the mass and discarding v5 .",
    "all these independent distance determinations based on the rr lyrae stars are well consistent to each other within their quoted uncertainties .",
    "we have identified and obtained @xmath0 light curves for 11 rr lyrae stars ( 5 rrc , 5 rrab and 1 rrd ) and one long period variable in the newly discovered dsph galaxy in bo@xmath9tes @xcite .",
    "we have investigated the oosterhoff classification of this dwarf galaxy with the rr lyrae stars .",
    "we have found that the rr lyrae parameters support an oosterhoff ii class for the bo@xmath9tes dsph and that the galaxy _ ab-_type rr lyrae stars might be slightly evolved objects .",
    "> from the average luminosity of the rr lyrae stars the galaxy distance modulus is @xmath3=19.11 @xmath4 0.08 ( d=66 @xmath4 3 kpc ) .",
    "three further rr lyrae - based independent methods confirm this distance within the observational errors , leading to a weighted mean modulus of @xmath3=19.14 @xmath4 0.07 mag .",
