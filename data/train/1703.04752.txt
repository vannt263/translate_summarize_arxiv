    "studying polarization of particles produced in high - energy collisions provides more information of a certain process . it can serve as a powerful tool to test the standard model , as well as to search for new physics .",
    "all polarization measurements depend on a pre - selected frame .",
    "consequently , the outputs are inevitably dependent on the frame choice .",
    "such dependence often causes cumbersomeness in comparison between theoretical predictions and experimental measurements , as well as comparison between different measurements .",
    "an example is the study of @xmath0 polarization , in which the results from the tevatron and the lhc seem to be inconsistent @xcite .",
    "recently , a few rotation - invariant observables have been proposed @xcite , based on the fact that all experimentally interesting frames are related by a rotation in the production plane @xcite .",
    "these rotation - invariant observables provide much more powerful test for the underline production mechanism , and they also provide a non - trivial check of the unaddressed systematic uncertainties for experimental data analyses @xcite .    in this work , we show that there could be more rotation - invariant observables and provide a general recipe to find all of them for an arbitrary decay process .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : general ] , we show that the angular distribution of the decay products from a spin-@xmath1 particle can be expanded by spherical harmonics @xmath2 with @xmath3 . then in section  [ sec : ri ] , we introduce a general method of finding all the rotation - invariant observables . in section",
    "[ sec : application ] , we apply our method to obtain explicit expressions of the rotation - invariant quantities for three most phenomenologically important cases , i.e. the decay process of a particle with spin @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "to @xmath7 daughter particles . , scaledwidth=21.0% ]    let us first consider a vector boson @xmath8 with mass @xmath9 decaying into @xmath7 particles , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : decay ] .",
    "angular distribution of a daughter particle with momentum @xmath10 in the rest frame of the parent particle @xmath8 can be expressed as @xmath11_{ij}(2\\pi)^4\\delta^{(4)}(p-\\sum_{l=1}^n k_l)\\big\\}\\\\ & \\times \\sum_{\\lambda,\\lambda'}\\rho_{\\lambda \\lambda'}\\epsilon^{i}_{\\lambda}\\epsilon^{*j}_{\\lambda ' } , \\end{split}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the squared amplitude of the decay process with summation over spins of all decay products , @xmath13 is the momentum of @xmath8 in its rest frame , @xmath14 is the spin density matrix of @xmath8 , and @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) are polarization vectors with polarization @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) for @xmath8 in the amplitude ( the complex conjugate of the amplitude ) .    after the integration over @xmath19  ( i@xmath202 ) and @xmath21 , the only vector left in the curly bracket in eq .",
    "is @xmath22 , where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the polar and azimuthal angles of @xmath25 in the rest frame of @xmath8 , respectively for a given choice of the coordinate system . as a result ,",
    "the only possible tensor structures in the curly bracket are @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , where @xmath29 . therefore the left - hand side ( lhs ) of eq .",
    "can be expanded by spherical harmonics @xmath30 with @xmath31 .",
    "especially , if the decay process conserves parity , terms proportional to @xmath28 are equal to zero , and then , the lhs of eq .   can be expanded by @xmath30 with @xmath32 only",
    ".    the same conclusion can be obtained from the transformation of eq .   under @xmath33 rotation .",
    "if we rotate the reference frame ( passive interpretation ) , both polarization vectors on the right - hand side ( rhs ) of eq .",
    "transform as the @xmath34 representation @xmath35 of @xmath33 .",
    "then the curly bracket on the rhs of eq .   must transform as @xmath36 .",
    "therefore it can be expressed by linear combination of @xmath30 with @xmath31 .",
    "the argument with the rotational symmetry is very general to be applied to parent particles with any spin . with some algebra",
    ", one can show that the angular distribution of any daughter particle in the rest frame of the parent particle can always be expressed as @xmath37 where @xmath1 is the spin of the parent particle .",
    "since @xmath38 is real , there are relations @xmath39 for any @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "together with the trivial relation @xmath42 fixed by the normalization condition , the number of the degrees of freedom of all coefficients @xmath43 is @xmath44 .",
    "in practice , the most commonly - used frames ( such as s - channel helicity frame , collins - soper frame @xcite , and gottfried - jackson frame @xcite ) can be related by a @xmath52 rotation in the production plane , which is usually chosen as the @xmath53 plane of the reference frame @xcite .",
    "since @xmath52 rotation has only one degree of freedom , one thus expects two additional rotation - invariant observables .    to obtain the rotation - invariant observables under @xmath52 rotation in @xmath53 plane ,",
    "it is better to express eq .   in bases of @xmath54 , which is the eigenstates of @xmath55 , @xmath56 where @xmath57 is related to @xmath45 defined in eq .   by @xmath58 and",

    "in the new frame is @xmath63 .",
    "thus the following observables are invariant under @xmath52 rotation in the @xmath53 plane :    [ eq : riso2a ] @xmath64    eq .",
    "gives @xmath65 @xmath52 rotation - invariant observables , and one can construct even more of them by multiplying @xmath57 with different values of @xmath41 . however , only two of them is independent of the @xmath33 rotation - invariant observables defined in eqs .   and .",
    "we find eq .",
    "is adequate to give the two independent @xmath52 rotation invariants .",
    "in this section , we apply eqs .  , and to the three most important cases in phenomenology , i.e. the decay of a particle with spin @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "we find explicit expressions for the @xmath33 and @xmath52 rotation - invariant observables . some of these invariants have been found in previous literatures .",
    "we show that our formula can reproduce all of them , and also give more invariants which have not been realized before .",
