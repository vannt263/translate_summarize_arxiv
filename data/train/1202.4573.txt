    "effects of static , randomly placed impurities ( disorder ) are central to our understanding of transport properties of electronic solids .",
    "indeed , building on anderson s seminal work , @xcite an immense amount of research activity has emerged over the past few decades on models of disordered electronic solids , in particular of non - interacting electronic systems , the subject now generically known as the anderson localization .",
    "@xcite about a decade and a half ago , the field of anderson localization has received a tremendous boost through the work of zirnbauer , @xcite and altland and zirnbauer @xcite ( az ) which provided a very general classification scheme of the behavior of non - interacting fermions subject to static disorder potentials .",
    "their work showed that universal behavior emerging on length scales much longer than the mean free path must be in one of only 10 possible symmetry classes , which depend solely on the behavior of the hamiltonian under generic symmetries ( time - reversal , particle - hole , chiral ) .",
    "@xcite these 10 symmetry classes are in one - to - one correspondence with the 10 types of symmetric ( constant curvature ) riemannian spaces in the classification scheme of the mathematician cartan .    electronic disordered systems exhibit , in a variety of symmetry classes and spatial dimensions , second order quantum phase transitions between insulating and conducting phases , which are examples of anderson ( localization ) transitions .",
    "( for a recent review of anderson transitions , see e.g. ref . ) .",
    "other examples of anderson ( localization ) transitions are quantum hall plateau transitions between insulating phases with different topological order and different quantized values of a hall conductance .",
    "a famous example is the integer quantum hall ( iqh ) plateau transition observed in two - dimensional ( 2d ) semiconductor devices subject to strong magnetic fields .",
    "the nature of the critical state at and the critical phenomena near the iqh transition are at the focus of intense experimental @xcite and theoretical research .",
    "@xcite    in spite of much effort over several decades , an analytical treatment of most of the critical conducting states in disordered electronic systems , including in particular that of the mentioned iqh transition , has been elusive ( although some proposals @xcite have been put forward , but see refs . and ) .",
    "a notable exception is the so - called spin quantum hall ( sqh ) plateau transition , @xcite which is similar to the iqh transition , but in a different symmetry class ( class c in the az classification ) . in this case",
    "an exact mapping to the classical problem of bond percolation is available .",
    "@xcite through ( variants of ) this mapping , exact expressions for various disorder - averaged observables and critical exponents for the sqh transition were obtained .",
    "@xcite    the universal ( critical ) properties of anderson transitions can be formulated in terms of so - called network models .",
    "the prime example of a network model is the celebrated chalker - coddington network model @xcite describing iqh transition .",
    "a similar network for the sqh transition @xcite was the starting point for the mapping to percolation @xcite mentioned above .",
    "while a network model formulation exists for systems in all 10 ( az ) symmetry classes , a particularly rich behavior is seen in symmetry class d in two dimensions , @xcite comprising , for example , a fermionic representation of the two - dimensional short - range ising spin glass ( ising exchange couplings with random signs ) .",
    "the phase diagram of a generic network model in symmetry class d contains three phases : an insulator , the so - called thermal quantum hall state , and a metal with continuously varying ( thermal ) hall conductivity .",
    "conventional critical statistical mechanics models are known to possess conformal invariance .",
    "@xcite implications of this invariance are most powerful in two dimensions , where it allows us to apply methods of 2d conformal field theory ( in short , cft ) @xcite to study critical phenomena in such models . as in any field theory description ,",
    "basic objects of study in cft are correlation functions of local observables .",
    "one of the more important characteristics in any cft is the so - called central charge @xmath1 .",
    "this parameter is related to the way a critical system responds to changes in its geometry .",
    "it is widely believed that anderson transitions in two dimensions also possess conformal symmetry ( and there is numerical evidence to support this belief in certain cases @xcite ) . however , in this case one is usually interested in correlation functions ( density of states , conductivities , etc . )",
    "averaged over all disorder realizations .",
    "taking such averages is complicated since the partition function of a disordered system undergoes statistical fluctuations from one realization of disorder to another .",
    "@xcite one way to handle this difficulty is to apply the supersymmetry method where two types of fields ( bosonic and fermionic ) are introduced in the theory .",
    "the outcome is a theory whose partition function is unity , @xmath2 , independent of the particular disorder realization , as well as of the shape and the size of the system .",
    "this implies the vanishing of the central charge for a cft describing an anderson transition in two dimensions ( see e.g. ref .",
    "for a recent review ) .",
    "recently , another approach to the study of two - dimensional critical systems has appeared .",
    "the approach uses methods of probability theory and conformal maps , and can be called the `` stochastic conformal geometry approach '' .",
    "the focus of stochastic geometry is to directly describe randomly fluctuating geometric objects in scale - invariant ( i.e. , , critical ) systems : regions in space of fractal dimension ( often referred to as `` clusters '' ) and their boundaries ( often referred to as `` cluster boundaries '' ) which form fractal curves . in a seminal paper , @xcite oded schramm has introduced a one - parameter family of random processes , since then called the schramm - loewner evolutions ( sle ) , which describe growth processes of random fractal conformally invariant curves .",
    "conformal invariance in this case is understood precisely as a statement about probability measures on curves . since their original discovery ,",
    "the sle processes have been studied in depth , have been related to traditional cft , and generalized in several ways .",
    "many reviews of this beautiful theory exist by now , and we recommend refs . for more details .",
    "the curves described by sle are unique candidates for ( scaling limits of ) cluster boundaries in 2d critical statistical mechanics systems .",
    "a one - parameter family of sle processes conventionally denoted by sle@xmath3 , which was discovered by schramm , fully exhausts all possible ensembles of sle curves .",
    "the real parameter @xmath4 of the sle@xmath3 family is related to the central charge of the cft describing the critical system by @xmath5 since we are interested in theories with @xmath0 , the values @xmath6 and @xmath7 play a special role for us .",
    "the sle@xmath8 process describes the scaling limit of 2d self - avoiding random walks ( saw ) or polymers , and the sle@xmath9 process describes the percolation hulls .",
    "these two types of critical curves possess special properties called locality ( for @xmath7 ) and restriction ( for @xmath6 ) .",
    "it is the restriction property that is intimately related to cfts with @xmath0 .",
    "it turns out that the notion of ` conformal restriction ' ( i.e. , the presence of the restriction property in a conformally invariant 2d system ) can be extended to certain two - dimensional sets ( ` clusters ' ) .",
    "in fact , there is a one - parameter family of conformal restriction measures , supported on such sets , which are fully characterized by a real number @xmath10 called the _",
    "restriction exponent_. in terms of cft this exponent is the scaling dimension of a certain boundary primary operator .",
    "the sets ( ` clusters ' ) that are described by conformal restriction all have boundaries ( ` cluster boundaries ' ) which are fractal curves that happen to be variants of sle@xmath8 , called sle@xmath11 . here",
    "the parameter @xmath12 is related to the exponent @xmath10 mentioned above by @xmath13 the theory of conformal restriction , the related theory of ( multiple ) sle@xmath14 processes , and their connections with cft are the subject of refs . and , and we will review relevant results later in the paper .    in this paper we propose to make use of the theory of conformal restriction to study quantum hall transitions and other 2d disordered electronic systems .",
    "a connection between a 2d disordered electron system and the theory of conformal restriction can be established by studying the so - called point contact conductance ( pcc ) , that is the conductance between two infinitely narrow leads introduced and studied in ref . .",
    "loosely speaking , in a given microscopic model the disorder - averaged pcc is represented as a sum of contributions from paths that the current follows between the point contacts , in the sense of the feynman path integral ( or sum ) for a quantum mechanical amplitude .",
    "when the contacts are placed at the _ boundary _ of a disordered conductor , we obtain the so - called _ boundary _ pcc . as we will explicitly show , the current paths , when studied in the presence of _ absorbing boundaries _ , @xcite satisfy the restriction property on the lattice ( i.e. , at the discrete , as opposed to the continuum level ) .",
    "assuming that the discrete ( lattice ) model has a continuum limit at its critical point , we expect the continuum analogs of the current paths to satisfy the ( continuum ) restriction property .",
    "furthermore , upon making the assumption of conformal invariance , we conclude that scaling limits of the current paths can be described by conformal restriction measures . in the following",
    "we will keep these assumptions in mind without stressing the difference between discrete and continuous settings .",
    "the fact that the continuum limits of current paths satisfy the restriction property turns out to imply immediately that , in the language of cft , the point contacts are points of insertions of ( virasoro ) _ primary _ conformal boundary operators .",
    "the connection between current paths and restriction measures opens up the possibility to obtain analytical results for disorder - averaged pcc s at the iqh critical point with a variety of boundary conditions .",
    "in addition , we show how our results naturally apply to the sqh transition , where the current paths are percolation hulls which , in the continuum limit , are known to be described by sle and are rigorously known to satisfy the restriction property .",
    "problems of classical diffusion and transport in two dimensions in a strong perpendicular magnetic field @xcite also admit a description in terms of conformal restriction .",
    "this is especially clear in the classical limit of the chalker - coddington model considered in ref . , where it was shown that in the continuum limit conductances of various kinds can be obtained by solving laplace s equation with tilted ( oblique ) boundary conditions .",
    "the tilt angle is the hall angle .",
    "this setting is naturally related to brownian motions reflected at an angle ( related to the hall angle ) upon hitting a reflecting boundary .",
    "such reflected brownian motions in fact underlie microscopic constructions of arbitrary restriction measures .",
    "@xcite a field theory formulation of classical high - field transport was given in the form of a gaussian model which is the linearized version of pruisken s ( replica ) sigma model for the iqh effect .",
    "@xcite    the same gaussian model field theory results from linearization of a _ different _ nonlinear sigma model that describes thermal transport of quasiparticles in disordered superconductors in class d in 2d.@xcite the perturbative renormalization group flow in this model is towards weak coupling , and in a finite system of size @xmath15 one can linearize the nonlinear sigma model to obtain the gaussian model with a coupling constant of order @xmath16 . in this limit quasiparticle transport is essentially classical with thermal conductivities ( divided by temperature , and in the corresponding units ) growing logarithmically with length scale , @xmath17 , while @xmath18 is arbitrary .",
    "thus , our results obtained from the general theory of conformal restriction apply to this system as well .",
    "before we proceed with a detailed derivation of our results , we briefly summarize them here .",
    "the main results that apply to all systems that we have mentioned above are as follows :    \\(1 ) disorder - averaged pccs within microscopic models are mapped to _ classical _ statistical mechanics problems with _ positive , albeit in some cases nonlocal , weights_.    \\(2 ) the so - obtained weights are _ intrinsic _ , which means that they are specific to certain geometric objects , and depend only on the shape and the structure of these objects , while they are independent of the shape of the rest of the system and of the boundary conditions",
    ". these weights also satisfy the crucial _ restriction property _ with respect to deformations of _ absorbing _ boundaries .",
    "more details regarding the meaning of intrinsic weights and the significance of the boundary conditions will become clearer in the sequel .",
    "\\(3 ) upon assuming conformal invariance we find that current insertions through point contacts on a boundary are ( virasoro ) _ primary _ cft operators .",
    "the dimensions of these operators are known exactly in some cases , and numerically in others .",
    "other operators related to changes in boundary conditions are also shown to be primary .",
    "this immediately allows us to use global conformal invariance to determine disorder - averaged pccs that reduce to two- and three - point functions of primary operators [ see eqs .",
    "( [ 2-point - g - absorbing ] ) , ( [ 2-point - g - mixed ] ) , ( [ 2-point - g - reflecting ] ) , ( [ delta - g ] ) , and ( [ g - reflecting - segment ] ) ] .",
    "this also sets the stage for future work addressing the computation of pccs that reduce to the more complex four - point functions .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : c=0 ] , we explain the conformal restriction property . we also explain in general terms how the graphical representation of boundary pccs in terms of feynman paths satisfies restriction with respect to absorbing boundaries . in sec .",
    "[ restriction in models ] , for each of the models mentioned above ( iqh , sqh , diffusion in strong magnetic field , and the metal in class d ) , we provide a detailed derivation of the relation between the disorder - averaged pccs and classical weights satisfying the restriction property .",

    "we also compute the conformal weights ( scaling dimensions ) of some of the relevant primary operators .",
    "some of these weights turn out to be _ superuniversal _ in the sense that they are fully determined by conformal restriction alone , and do not depend on the particular symmetry class of the model ( see table [ dimensionstable ] for a summary ) . in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] we discuss our results with the view on possible extensions and generalizations .",
    "appendices provide some relevant background information from graph theory , and details of some calculations .",
    "we begin this section by describing the conformal restriction property .",
    "then we explain how current paths contributing to boundary pccs at anderson critical points naturally satisfy this property with respect to _ absorbing _ boundaries ( which , we recall , describe ideal leads attached to the boundaries ) .      consider a statistical ensemble of curves defined in a simply - connected domain @xmath19 of the complex plane .",
    "all these curves start at a fixed point @xmath20 on the boundary of @xmath19 and end at another fixed boundary point @xmath21 ( see fig .",
    "[ restriction - curves ] ) .",
    "the ensemble is specified by a finite measure on the curves .",
    "the measure can be normalized to be a probability measure , but it is more natural and convenient to think about un - normalized weights associated with curves in the ensemble , similar to boltzmann weights of configurations in statistical mechanics .",
    "next , consider a set @xmath22 such that the topology of the sub - domain @xmath23 is the same as that of @xmath19 .",
    "this means that @xmath22 is `` attached '' to the boundary of @xmath19 , so that @xmath23 is simply - connected , and that the points @xmath20 and @xmath21 belong to the parts of the boundary that are common between @xmath19 and @xmath23 .",
    "notice that we allow for sets @xmath22 that have more than one connected component .",
    "the original ensemble of random curves can be used to define two new ensembles of curves in the sub - domain @xmath23 .",
    "the first one is obtained by restriction : it is the ensemble of curves in @xmath19 conditioned not to intersect @xmath22 . in other words , of all the curves in the original ensemble",
    "we keep only those that do not enter @xmath22 . to a curve @xmath24",
    "this definition assigns the same weight in the new ensemble that this curve has in the original ensemble .",

    "note that the equivalence is at the level of probabilities and not statistical weights .",
    "if in this construction we use sets @xmath22 that can only border the boundary of @xmath19 on one arc from @xmath20 to @xmath21 , say , the one that goes counterclockwise , then we have the so - called one - sided restriction ( see the left panel in fig .",
    "[ restriction - curves ] ) .",
    "if different connected components of @xmath22 can be attached to either of the arcs of the boundary , we have the two - sided restriction ( see the right panel in fig . [ restriction - curves ] ) .",
    "notice that this is a stronger property since any two - sided restriction measure automatically satisfies the one - sided restriction , but the opposite is not necessarily true .",
    "it is known @xcite that the only ensemble of simple curves that satisfies the two - sided conformal restriction property is the sle@xmath8 .",
    "however , we can consider more general sets @xmath29 that `` touch '' the boundary of @xmath19 only at the two fixed points @xmath20 and @xmath21 ( see the right panel in fig .",

    "[ restriction - sets ] .",
    "it is clear that a set @xmath30 intersects @xmath22 if and only if its boundary ( shown by thick curves ) intersects @xmath22 .",
    "thus , the restriction property does not care about the internal structure of the set @xmath30 , and it is sufficient to `` fill it in '' and consider the boundaries of the filled - in sets .",
    "this means that two different ensembles of sets that only differ by their internal structure , but have the same fillings and boundaries , lead to the same restriction measure .",
    "an example of this is provided by ensembles of brownian excursions and percolation hulls conditioned to avoid the boundary ( see sec .",
    "[ restriction in models ] for details ) .",
    "we note in passing that for a certain range of the restriction exponent @xmath10 ( @xmath31 ) , samples of two - sided conformal restriction measures ( the filled - in sets @xmath30 ) have so - called _",
    "cut points_.@xcite these are points with the property that if one of the them is removed , the filled - in set @xmath30 becomes disconnected .",
    "these points are shown on the right panel in fig .",
    "[ restriction - sets ] as intersections of the `` left '' and `` right '' boundaries of @xmath30 .",
    "these points are similar to the so - called `` cutting bonds '' , @xcite which are important components in the structure of percolation clusters .",
    "in fact , in the mapping to percolation for the sqh transition , the cut points are exactly the cutting bonds of the critical percolation clusters .    for a one - sided restriction measure ( see the left panel in fig .",
    "[ restriction - sets ] ) , its sample may touch the portion of the boundary where we are not attaching sets @xmath22 .",
    "then all statistical information related to the restriction property is encoded in the `` left '' filling of the set @xmath30 or , equivalently , in its `` right '' boundary . in either case , as we have mentioned in the introduction , the boundaries of restriction measures are variants of sle@xmath8 known as sle@xmath11",
    ". we shall give more details on sle@xmath32 in sec .",
    "[ restriction theory ] .    as we have already mentioned , it is more natural to think of un - normalized restriction measures . in this case",
    "the total weight of a restriction measure can be thought of as a partition function @xmath33 , which is the sum of weights of all sets @xmath30 in the ensemble .",
    "we point out that @xmath33 is somewhat arbitrary , since it depends on an arbitrary normalization .",
    "this is especially subtle when we imagine obtaining @xmath33 from a partition function in a discrete microscopic model ( as in the examples in sec .",
    "[ restriction in models ] below ) .",
    "such a derivation will typically involve an infinite normalization in the continuum limit . however , once a particular normalization is chosen for each microscopic model of interest , the partition functions @xmath33 become well defined in the continuum , and contain meaningful information through their dependence on the domain @xmath19 , the marked points @xmath20 and @xmath21 on the boundary @xmath34 where the random sets @xmath30 intersect the boundary , and on the type of the restriction measure that we consider .",
    "[ see sec .",
    "[ restricion theory : the basic theorem of conformal restriction ] for a more in depth discussion of this point , which is based on the definition of the partition function @xmath33 in terms of a physical quantity , namely , the disorder - averaged pcc @xmath35 [ see eq .",

    "consider now a finite 2d disordered conductor occupying a domain @xmath19 .",
    "we can place small contacts at points @xmath20 and @xmath21 on the boundary of @xmath19 and measure the boundary pcc @xmath35 between the contacts . in this paper",
    "we will focus specifically on systems described by network models of chalker - coddington ( cc ) type ( see fig .",
    "[ chalkerbig ] ) . then",
    ", in general , a diagrammatic approach can be developed for computing the disorder - averaged conductance @xmath36 ( more details will be presented below for specific models ) .",
    "in particular , `` feynman '' paths drawn on a network for a system defined in the domain @xmath19 determine contributions to @xmath36 .",
    "all these paths begin at the point @xmath20 and end at the point @xmath21 and are connected , which is a crucial feature of a disordered system .",
    "indeed , for a system with quenched disorder we must average not the partition function , but the free energy . while the partition function generates all paths , the free energy generates connected paths only .",
    "let us examine under what conditions the feynman paths satisfy restriction . in order to do",
    "so we consider two sets of feynman paths :    \\(1 ) the feynman paths for @xmath36 for the system defined in the domain @xmath23 .",
    "( 2)the feynman paths for @xmath36 in @xmath19 which do not enter @xmath22 .",
    "it is easily seen that paths from the two sets will have the same weight after disorder averaging if the rules for generating the paths do not depend explicitly on the domain in which they are defined .",
    "the only dependence on the domain is that the paths are drawn in that domain . in other words ,",
    "the crucial condition for a set of curves to satisfy restriction is that the weights of the curves are _ intrinsic _  namely , the weight of a curve may be determined by examining its shape , without reference to the shape of the system ( domain ) it is in .",
    "a simple example of an intrinsic weight is the probability of a random walk on a square lattice , which is @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the total number of steps in the walk .",
    "this weight is intrinsic since it depends only on the length of the walk , but not on the domain in which the walk happens .",
    "an important caveat has to be added to this statement : special boundary conditions must be chosen in order to allow us to identify the weights of the paths described in items 1 and 2 above .",
    "these boundary conditions may be described as the `` absorbing boundary conditions '' and often come up naturally in the study of disordered systems : they describe , as already mentioned , the presence of ideal leads attached to the boundary . indeed",
    ", a given path may approach the boundary , and then a certain weight will be associated with the path turning back into the bulk or escaping the system through the boundary . for network models ,",
    "these weights are determined by parameters ascribed to a particular node that is on the boundary of the network . for the weights to be intrinsic",
    ", they must not depend on whether a particular node lies on the boundary or in the bulk of the system .",
    "therefore , a boundary node should be such as to allow a path going through that node to escape the system . a boundary with such nodes",
    "is called _ absorbing _ , and in physical terms it is realized by attaching ideal leads to the disordered system . a microscopic picture of the absorbing boundary for the cc network is shown in fig .",
    "[ a boundary ] .        the role and the importance of the absorbing boundary conditions will be described in more detail in sec .",
    "[ restriction in models ] , where we shall also describe in more detail the assignment of classical statistical weights to sets of feynman paths , after disorder averaging .    as in the formal definition of the restriction property above",
    ", it is sufficient to consider not the feynman paths themselves with all their internal structure ( multiple loops and crossings ) , but their fillings and boundaries .",
    "this will be implicitly assumed in the following . in particular , in the case of the cc model considered in sec .",
    "[ restrictioninchalker ] we will introduce the `` pictures '' that emerge as important geometric objects determining contributions to conductances",
    ". they will derive from disorder - averaged pairs of feynman paths on the links of the network model , and will have loops .",
    "however , as for any sets satisfying restriction , it will be sufficient to consider the filled pictures ( i.e. , the geometrical objects that result when all internal ` holes ' of a picture are filled ) and the boundaries of these filled pictures , especially in the continuum limit . in the presentation given below",
    ", we sometimes will refer to both filled and unfilled objects as `` pictures '' to simplify the discussion .",
    "however , when we need to distinguish a picture and its filling , we will make the distinction explicit .    in order to establish conformal restriction we must _ assume _ that an alternative way of obtaining the paths in the first set ( in item 1 above ) is to conformally map the paths from domain @xmath19 onto domain @xmath23 .",
    "but this assumption is the standard assumption of conformal invariance of critical systems in two dimensions .",
    "so we expect conformal restriction to hold for the set of disorder - averaged feynman paths for a disordered system at criticality .    in order to connect this conformal restriction property to probability theory",
    "we must also show that the weights obtained for configurations of paths after disorder averaging are positive , such that they can be considered as _ classical _ statistical weights .",
    "this will hold in the systems of interest to us , as discussed in sec . [",
    "restriction in models ] .",
    "we expect that a similar formulation , utilizing feynman paths , is possible for a large class of network models describing other disordered systems .    in all cases that we consider ,",
    "the relevant classical geometric objects describing disorder - averaged pccs at critical points become samples of conformal restriction measures in the continuum limit .",
    "this immediately leads to the following consequences .",
    "first , this means that the disorder - averaged pccs are equal ( up to some normalization factor ) to the partition functions that we have introduced above : @xmath39 the normalization factor that is involved in this relation reflects the freedom of normalization of the partition function @xmath33 that we have mentioned above at the end of sec .",
    "[ subsec : conf - restriction ] .",
    "once this normalization is fixed for a given system , the meaningful dependence on @xmath40 is the same for the pcc and the partition function .",

    "the first example is the operator that injects current through an absorbing boundary .",

    "if @xmath546 we will have an insulator as @xmath547 , while if @xmath548 we will have a superconductor .    another way to arrive at the same conclusion",
    "is to consider the total current through a segment @xmath549 .",
    "this total current should be a conformally - invariant object of dimension 0 .",
    "but if we perform a conformal transformation that takes @xmath50 to @xmath550 , the current transforms to @xmath551 the conformal invariance of @xmath552 implies @xmath54 .",
    "the second example of a superuniversal operator appears in the situations shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : g - change ] . in these cases",
    "we consider diagrams in which current is forced to pass through a point @xmath50 on the boundary of the system .",
    "the boundary is absorbing around this point . a diagram forced to touch the point",
    "@xmath50 looks locally as a sample of a two - sided restriction measure , and the weight of this measure can be easily seen to be @xmath553 . indeed , to select only diagrams that pass through the point @xmath50 we introduce a small semicircle @xmath22 of radius @xmath525 centered at @xmath50 the difference between the overall weight of all diagrams and the weight of diagrams that avoid @xmath22 is proportional to the weight of the pictures that pass through @xmath50 ( as @xmath525 tends to zero ) .",
    "the conformal restriction property allows us to compute the weight of the diagrams that avoid @xmath22 by effecting a conformal transformation that removes @xmath22 [ see eq .",
    "( [ transformation ] ) ] .",
    "such transformation @xmath276 that also fixes the points @xmath20 and @xmath21 can be easily written explicitly ( see appendix [ conformal - map ] ) . then , using eq .",
    "( [ transformation ] ) we can find the change in the pcc after the deformation of the boundary to the first non - vanishing order in @xmath525 as @xmath554 this is exactly the equation ( [ delta - g ] ) with @xmath539 , a universal value independent , in particular , of @xmath161 .",
    "the dimension @xmath539 is consistent with the fact that in the cft language the removal of the semicircle @xmath22 is effected by the insertion of the stress energy tensor @xmath207 .",
    "the stress energy tensor @xmath207 has always dimension @xmath553 , and for @xmath0 is a primary operator .",
    "the third superuniversal weight is that of lift - off points : @xmath540 ( see fig .",
    "[ grayfeymanns ] ) . this can be seen in the following way : the lift - off point must always be integrated over to obtain a physically measurable average conductance .",
    "the conductance is conformal invariant .",
    "for example , to compute the overall contribution of diagrams in fig .",
    "( [ grayfeymanns ] ) we must take @xmath555 , where @xmath556 is the operator which creates a lift - off at point @xmath50 , and the ellipsis denotes other operators which must be inserted ( in the example shown in fig . [ grayfeymanns ] , the other operators are inserted at the points @xmath21 and @xmath1 ) . upon a mbius conformal transformation @xmath276 that maps the upper half plane to the upper half plane",
    ", the integral @xmath557 transforms to @xmath558 conformal invariance of the pcc that is obtained from this expression implies that @xmath559 .",
    "since the operator @xmath560 is of dimension one , its integral is also a primary operator , but of dimension@xcite @xmath561 .",
    "this means that in fig .",
    "[ grayfeymanns ] , instead of summing over @xmath50 , we may simply place an operator of dimension zero at @xmath20 .",
    "thus , the operator that changes the boundary condition from absorbing to reflecting is a primary of dimension zero .",
    "note that this result is completely general .",
    "this has been noticed and used before by cardy@xcite in the context of percolation to compute the crossing probability in a rectangle .",
    "but , for other systems with central charge @xmath0 , to the best of our knowledge , the value @xmath561 was not reported before .",
    "this shows that the integral expressing the average conductance in eq .",
    "( [ g - integral ] ) is simply given by the three point function of operators with weights @xmath562 , @xmath529 , and @xmath54 : @xmath563        one more superuniversal weight @xmath564 is a special case of @xmath517 ( or @xmath518 ) which is obtained when current is injected through the smallest possible opening between reflecting boundaries with the opposite chirality ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : dimension - zero ] ) .",
    "in this situation the current can not exit through the same opening , and the average pcc between two such contacts does not depend on the distance between them due to current conservation .",
    "therefore , the dimension of such current insertion is zero : @xmath565 .",
    "we note that most of the results for superuniversal weights are consequences of conservation laws , and can be derived from ward identities , such as those associated with the current operator or the stress energy tensor",
    ". however , some of the results for the superuniversal weights are stronger .",
    "for example , as we shall see in the next section , for critical percolation the operator that creates two percolation hulls at the absorbing boundary , namely @xmath566 , has weight two .",
    "this is the superuniversal weight @xmath539 of the stress energy tensor .",
    "both operators locally correspond to the case that a unit flux of charge impinges on the boundary and then escapes to infinity .",
    "since they are locally equivalent , they must have the same weight .",
    "however , @xmath566 is not globally equivalent to the stress energy tensor .",
    "the difference between the operators becomes apparent at the macroscopic level : while the stress energy tensor only forces a hull to touch down on the absorbing boundary , solutions to the null vector equation associated with a @xmath566 operator may be selected in such a way as to obtain a certain topology of current flow through boundary points .",
    "such global distinction is important , for example , in the proof of watts formula.@xcite      we now turn to the kac table classification of the operators appearing in the sqh effect problem .",
    "these are directly related to hulls of percolation clusters.@xcite the operator creating @xmath325 percolation hulls ( multiple sle@xmath459 ) at a boundary ( also called the boundary @xmath325-leg operator ) is known@xcite to be @xmath477 in the theory with @xmath7 . according to eq .",
    "( [ h-6 ] ) , its weight is @xmath479    consider now the operator that injects current through a single link ( a point contact ) at the origin on the absorbing boundary .",
    "this creates a percolation hull that is not allowed to hit the boundary until it goes out through the other point contact .",
    "consider the positive real axis .",
    "by known@xcite percolation arguments this absorbing boundary can be replaced by a reflecting boundary plus insertion of an additional hull emanating from a point immediately to the right of the origin .",
    "this extra hull `` screens '' the current carrying hull from approaching the boundary .",
    "the same can be done for the negative real axis .",
    "this absorbing boundary can also be equivalently described by a reflecting boundary plus insertion of a hull , this time immediately to the left of the origin .",
    "the overall outcome is that we can think of current inserted on the absorbing boundary as three hulls inserted on a reflecting boundary .",
    "this is the three - leg operator @xmath567 with dimension @xmath568 , the superuniversal value .",
    "this value is consistent with what is known rigorously@xcite about the sle@xmath459 conditioned not to touch the boundary .",
    "similarly , we can consider the operators that inject current at points of juxtaposition of a reflecting and the absorbing boundaries .",
    "these are shown in fig .",
    "[ r - a and l - a contacts ] and have weights @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "let the current be injected at the origin through links that are shown by fat lines .",
    "the absorbing boundary along the positive real axis can be replaced by a reflecting boundary plus a `` screening '' hull inserted immediately to the right of the origin ( its origin is marked by a dashed link immediately to the right of the current insertion ) .",
    "the reflecting boundary conditions on the negative real axis are in fact different for @xmath55 and @xmath56 . for @xmath56",
    "the negative real axis is simply the reflecting boundary in the percolation language .",
    "then it is clear that the weight @xmath56 is that of the two - leg operator in percolation , that is , @xmath569 . at the same time , for @xmath55 the negative real axis is described by a reflecting boundary plus an insertion of an additional screening hull immediately to the left of the origin .",
    "this makes @xmath55 the weight of the three - leg operator just like @xmath140 : @xmath570 .    the dimensions for operator insertions at reflecting boundaries are easily seen to correspond to the two - hull operators : @xmath571 .",
    "they are equal to each other , in accord with eq .",
    "( [ hr = hl ] ) .",
    "similarly , it is easy to see that @xmath572 and @xmath573 .",
    "other superuniversal weights are also easily confirmed for the sqh transition .",
    "indeed , forcing a hull to go through a point on the absorbing boundary is equivalent to having two percolation hulls starting at this point , plus two screening hulls to screen the absorbing boundary .",
    "thus , the relevant operator is the four - leg operator with @xmath574 . for a lift - off point",
    "we have the two halves of the current - carrying hull that comes to this point and leaves it , plus one screening hull that ensures that the current does not touch the boundary again .",
    "this is the three - leg operator , and @xmath575 .",
    "the switch between the absorbing and a reflecting boundary can be described by a single screening hull , and the corresponding weight is @xmath576 .",
    "the same one - leg operator injects current through a switch between the left and the right reflecting boundaries ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : dimension - zero ] ) , and @xmath577 .",
    "we comment here that the degeneracies between certain weights ( @xmath578 and @xmath579 ) are a consequence of the _ locality _ property of percolation : even one `` absorbing '' link next to a point contact creates a screening hull .",
    "weights of all boundary operators that we have introduced can be found exactly for the classical cc model ( diffusion in a magnetic field ) . in particular , this confirms the superuniversal weights .",
    "first consider injecting a current through the absorbing boundary .",
    "the dimension of such current insertion is @xmath54 . indeed , since there are no reflecting boundaries around , the problem is equivalent to that of diffusion .",
    "it is easy to see , using green s functions , that the fraction of diffusing particles that will reach a height @xmath51 from the real axis if they are released from the point @xmath580 is @xmath581 , the rest will be trapped by the absorbing boundary .",
    "since releasing the diffusing particles is equivalent to the insertion of current through the absorbing boundary ( we assume that @xmath525 is the lower cutoff scale ) , and the @xmath525 dependence marks the weight of the operator , we indeed see that the weight for current insertion through the absorbing boundary is @xmath54 .",
    "the rigorous formulation of this result in terms of brownian excursions and its proof are due to virag.@xcite    now let us consider lift - off points .",
    "a touch - off point is a point at which current arrives at a point on a reflecting boundary , immediately leaves it , and is conditioned never to touch the boundary again , say , to the left of the point at which it arrived . in the classical cc , due to lack of interference , one may separate the past of the diffusing particle from its future , relative to the moment it reached the lift - off point .",
    "the past and the future are actually two independent restriction measures , whose weights simply add up@xcite due to lack of interference .",
    "the weight of the future measure is @xmath582 as in eq .",
    "( [ his1minusthetaoverpi ] ) . for the past measure we must apply time reversal in order to be able to apply eq .",
    "( [ his1minusthetaoverpi ] ) ; this takes @xmath583 , which means that for this measure , @xmath584 .",
    "the sum of the two weights is the weight of the touch of point @xmath559 .",
    "the simple decoupling ( independence ) of the past from the future also occurs if we force the current to pass through a boundary point . here",
    "both the past and the future are current insertion ( extraction ) operators having the same weight @xmath54 . summing up the weights of the two measures",
    ", we obtain that the operator in question has weight @xmath539 .",
    "a general way of finding weights of current insertions at a boundary is to solve a boundary value problem for the electric potential @xmath183 that gives the conductance of a rectangular sample ( hall bar ) of length @xmath15 and width @xmath492 . for long samples with @xmath585",
    "the conductance is exponentially small : @xmath586 where @xmath10 is the scaling dimension of the most relevant operator contributing to the conductance .",

    "we have revisited the problem of the plateau transition in the integer quantum hall ( iqh ) effect and related anderson localization - delocalization transitions in two spatial dimensions .",
    "specifically , we have considered the chalker - coddington network model and related models . in all cases",
    "we have focused on the so - called boundary point - contact conductances ( pccs ) at critical points , and their behavior in the presence of various boundaries ( absorbing and reflecting ) .",
    "while most of our results are general and apply to all problems we consider , let us concentrate here on the most interesting case , the iqh problem .",
    "there are two key observations that allow us to analyze the problem .",
    "the first observation is that microscopic expressions for pccs can be written as a sum of _ positive _ contributions related to certain geometric objects that we call _ pictures _ ( see sec .",
    "[ restrictioninchalker ] ) . written as a sum over pictures ,",
    "a pcc can be interpreted as a partition function of an ensemble of pictures , each picture having a certain statistical weight .",
    "the second observation is that these statistical weights are _ intrinsic _ and satisfy the so - called restriction property with respect to _ absorbing _ boundaries .",
    "namely , whenever we deform an absorbing boundary , the pictures that continue to contribute to a pcc are the ones that are present in the new ( deformed ) system .",
    "the pictures that intersect the deformed boundary do not contribute any more , and the pcc is renormalized .",
    "when we combine the restriction property with the assumed conformal invariance at the iqh transition point , we can employ the recently developed mathematical theory of conformal restriction measures .",
    "this theory is closely related to conformal field theories ( cfts ) with zero central charge . as a result",
    ", we get several results that were already mentioned in the introduction and discussed at length in the main part of the paper .",
    "let us briefly repeat them here .",
    "first , pccs in various geometries can be studied as correlation functions of ( virasoro ) _ primary _ cft operators .",
    "this statement alone allows to calculate exact forms for pccs that reduce to three - point functions .",
    "secondly , we predict the values of conformal dimensions of some of the primary operators that appear in the theory based on very general arguments .",
    "finally , the connection with conformal restriction is established for other disordered systems , including the spin quantum hall transition , the classical limit of the chalker - coddington model ( diffusion in a magnetic field ) , and the metal in class d. for these systems many more dimensions of primary operators can be obtained exactly .",
    "the relation between the chalker - coddington model and conformal restriction that we have discovered allows for an approach to the study of the critical properties of the iqh transition that is alternative to the ones used before . a full understanding of the transition by these methods will require much more work .",
    "we plan to extend this paper in several directions .",
    "we hope to be able to consider pccs in more complicated geometries , where the necessary cft correlation functions will be four - point or higher functions . in these cases , knowing the conformal dimensions of the primary operators involved will not be sufficient .",
    "in addition , we would have to understand whether there are degenerate operators@xcite related to the existence of null vectors in the corresponding representations of the virasoro algebra .",
    "potentially , this can be established by analyzing fusions of the operators that we have already identified .    in this paper",
    "we have considered only boundary pccs .",
    "the necessary mathematical theory of sets @xmath30 that `` touch '' the boundary of a domain at two points is called the `` chordal restriction theory '' . in principle",
    "one can define conductances between point contacts in the bulk of a network ( obtained by cutting some of the internal links),@xcite or between a boundary and a bulk contact . upon disorder averaging these conductances should also satisfy a ( suitably modified ) restriction property .",
    "the corresponding mathematical theory of the `` bulk '' restriction or the `` radial '' restriction has not been worked out , and we plan to develop it , and its relations to bulk cft operators .",
    "for the bulk theory the cut points that we have mentioned in secs .",
    "[ subsec : conf - restriction ] and [ restrictioninchalker ] will likely be important objects .",
    "it is known from the conformal restriction theory@xcite that two - sided restriction measures have cut points for any restriction exponent @xmath10 in the range @xmath587 .",
    "the cut points form a fractal set of hausdorff dimension @xmath588 as we have argued , in our problems two - sided restriction measures correspond to pccs between contacts placed on the absorbing boundary , in which case the restriction exponent is the dimension of the conserved current operator : @xmath54",
    ". then the dimension of the set of cut points is @xmath589 . in the case of the sqh transition ( percolation )",
    ", this dimension can be written as @xmath590 where @xmath591 is the dimension of the _ bulk _ four - leg operator [ see eq .",
    "( [ n - leg - bulk ] ) for @xmath592 well known to be related to the critical exponent of the correlation length for percolation @xmath593 while we know that the localization length exponent for the sqh transition is exactly this @xmath594 , it is very different for the iqh transition .",
    "the relation of cut points to @xmath595 ( if any ) is not clear to us at the moment , but it is tantalizing to speculate that one can get more understanding by focusing on a decomposition of fillings of pictures into irreducible components .",
    "another possible extension of our results is in the direction of studying the restriction property away from critical points .",
    "while the conformal invariance is lost away from critical points , the restriction property for pictures survives , and one can attempt to create a theory of `` massive '' restriction measures . similar attempts to develop a theory of `` off - critical '' or `` massive '' variants of sle exist in the literature.@xcite also , one - sided conformal restriction measures can be built from brownian motions with oblique reflection at boundaries , and one can try to extend this construction by introducing a finite `` killing rate '' for the brownian particles . in the field theory language this corresponds to adding a mass term to the action ( [ s0 ] ) .",
    "finally , we hope that the general idea of using notions and methods of stochastic conformal geometry ( conformal restriction and sle ) can be fruitful in the study of other critical disordered systems .",

    "in this appendix we present a relation between pictures and feynman paths on the cc network .",
    "the connection goes through the notion of a directed graph , or _",
    "( see refs . ) .",
    "namely , for each picture @xmath94 we construct a digraph with vertices being the network nodes visited by the picture by replacing each link of the picture that is traversed @xmath96 times with @xmath96 directed edges .",
    "( all graphs constructed in this way are _ loopless _ : there is no edge in them that connects a vertex to itself . )",
    "then , each feynman path @xmath100 corresponds to an eulerian trail ( that is , a sequence of directed edges that visits every edge exactly once ) on this digraph .",
    "the correspondence is one - to - many , since all permutations among @xmath96 edges of the digraph connecting a pair of vertices correspond to the same feynman path .",
    "there are several theorems in the theory of directed graphs that are relevant for our discussion and allow us to characterize the pictures that come from feynman paths , and also count the number of feynman paths @xmath152 for a given picture @xmath94 .",
    "first , we introduce a few definitions .",
    "let @xmath19 be a digraph with vertex set @xmath596 and edge set @xmath597 .",
    "a _ trail _ in @xmath19 is a sequence @xmath598 of distinct edges such that the final vertex of @xmath599 is the initial vertex of @xmath600 for all @xmath601 .",
    "if , in addition , the final vertex of @xmath602 is the initial vertex of @xmath603 , then the trail is called a _ tour _ or _ cycle_. a trail ( tour )",
    "is _ eulerian _ if it visits every edge of @xmath19 exactly once .",
    "a digraph that has no isolated vertices and contains an eulerian tour is called an eulerian digraph .",
    "the _ outdegree _ of a vertex @xmath604 , denoted outdeg@xmath605 , is the number of edges of the digraph with initial vertex @xmath604 .",
    "similarly the _ indegree _ of @xmath604 , denoted indeg@xmath605 , is the number of edges of the digraph with final vertex @xmath604 .",
    "a digraph is _ balanced _",
    "if indeg@xmath605 = outdeg@xmath605 for all vertices @xmath604 .",
    "the first theorem that we need is the following : a digraph without isolated vertices is eulerian if and only if it is connected and balanced .",
    "this immediately gives the characterization of pictures that come from feynman paths : for every vertex of such a picture the sum of numbers @xmath96 on the incoming links must be equal to the sum of numbers @xmath96 on the outgoing links .",
    "an example of such a balanced picture is shown in fig .",
    "[ picture eight ] . actually , there is a little caveat that we need to mention",
    ". as drawn , this picture has the initial and final vertices that are _ not _ balanced . to eliminate this problem",
    ", we connect these two vertices into a single vertex @xmath606 ( labeled by 0 in fig . [ picture eight ] ) with @xmath607 . the resulting picture _",
    "is _ balanced .",
    "moreover , after this is done , the number of feynman paths corresponding to the original picture is equal to the number of eulerian tours on the digraph corresponding to the modified picture divided by the multiplicity factors @xmath608 for each link of the balanced picture .",
    "next we describe how we can count the number of feynman paths @xmath152 that correspond to a balanced picture @xmath94 .",
    "we need two more theorems .",
    "one of them is the so - called best theorem that relates the number of eulerian tours on a digraph @xmath19 to the number of spanning ( directed ) trees on @xmath19 .",
    "here is a precise formulation .",
    "let @xmath19 be a connected balanced digraph with vertex set @xmath609 .",
    "fix an edge @xmath610 of @xmath19 , and let @xmath604 be the initial vertex of @xmath610 .",
    "let @xmath611 denote the number of oriented ( spanning ) subtrees of @xmath19 with root @xmath604 , and let @xmath612 denote the number of eulerian tours of @xmath19 starting with the edge @xmath610 .",
    "then @xmath613    the other theorem , the so - called matrix - tree theorem , gives the number of spanning trees @xmath611 with a given initial vertex @xmath604 in terms of the minor of the _ laplacian matrix _ of the digraph .",
    "let us denote the number of edges going from vertex @xmath614 to vertex @xmath615 by @xmath616 .",
    "the laplacian matrix @xmath617 of a directed graph @xmath19 with vertex set @xmath618 is the @xmath619 matrix @xmath620 the matrix - tree theorem states the following : let @xmath19 be a digraph with vertex set @xmath596 , and let @xmath621 .",
    "let @xmath15 be the laplacian matrix of @xmath19 , and define @xmath622 to be @xmath15 with the @xmath156-th row and column deleted .",

    "( [ best theorem ] ) and ( [ matrix - tree theorem ] ) with the known degeneracy of the eulerian tours that give the same feynman path , we finally obtain the following general formula : @xmath624 to illustrate this formula , consider the balanced picture shown on the left in fig . [ picture eight ] . instead of counting the number of eulerian trails that start at the beginning of every feynman path , we can join the initial and final vertices of these paths into a single vertex ( labeled by @xmath68 on the left in the figure ) , and count the number of eulerian tours on the corresponding digraph .",
    "it is clear from the above discussion that the extra vertex @xmath68 does not enter into the calculation of @xmath612 ( even though the denominator in the formula ( [ number of paths ] ) for @xmath152 should still contain the edge multiplicities @xmath616 from the original picture ) .",
