    "the prototypical starburst galaxy ngc  253 is a highly inclined ( i=78 , @xcite ) disk galaxy at a distance of about 3  mpc ( @xcite ) .",
    "the view towards its inner region is heavily obscured , and the exact location of its nucleus has been the matter of some debate .",
    "the astrometry of the various infrared sources in the central 10  has been discussed in detail by kalas & wynn - williams ( 1994 , hereafter kw94 ) in the near - infrared and @xcite in the mid - infrared . from their @xmath01  resolution",
    "h , k , l , and m observations , kw94 conclude that the brightest source in all the maps ( their peak  1 ) lies at r.a.(1950)=@xmath1 , decl.(1950)=@xmath2 .",
    "this position is in very good agreement with that of the emission peak at mir wavelengths as determined by keto  ( 1993 ) at 10  from astrometric methods and pia ( 1992 ) from low - level contour fitting to published maps with lower resolution .",
    "it is safe to assume that the location of peak  1 is independent of wavelength up to 20  , enabling us to adopt the above coordinates for the continuum peak in our maps .",
    "peak  1 is not connected to any of the strong radio point sources found at 2  cm by turner & ho ( 1985 , hereafter th85 ) and 6  cm by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the radio sources are highly aligned along the major axis of ngc  253 at p.a . 51 .",
    "all of them are most likely either radio supernovae or hii regions , based on their spectral index .",
    "the only exception is the source th  2 in th85 , a powerful flat spectrum radio source that they proposed to be the nucleus of ngc  253 .",
    "th85 argue that because of its high radio luminosity ( @xmath3  ) and its unique location at the center of a synchroton disk this source probably is a compact synchroton source , similar to those observed in active galactic nuclei ( agns ) .",
    "it lies close to a secondary mir peak ( peak  2 ) @xmath0 2.2 northeast of peak  1 ( @xcite , @xcite ) . however , as we will show , the radio nucleus is most likely not identical with any characteristic infrared source .",
    "this view was strongly supported from 0.5  resolution nir color maps by @xcite .",
    "their maps were referenced to other observations by cross - correlation of low level contours and show that the radio nucleus th  2 coincides with an extinction maximum of @xmath4 .",
    "in addition , kw94 show that the exact position of peak  2 is wavelength dependent in the sense that for j , h , k observations it lies @xmath0 1  further east than in m - band .",
    "the physical nature behind the various infrared sources is uncertain .",
    "for example , according to @xcite , the emission of the -line at 2.17  is strongest at peak  1 . on the other hand , kw94",
    "show that peak  1 has a low pah - feature / continuum emission ratio .",
    "since pah emission is usually indicative of ongoing star formation , kw94 argue against peak  1 being an intense starburst which would be the natural explanation for the  emission .",
    "to investigate this matter further , we have observed ngc  253 at mir wavelengths , both in continuum and line emission . the forbidden @xmath5 transition of singly ionized neon at 12.81  traces the photoionization regions of hot stars and thus carries similar information than e.g. , but at a much lower extinction : @xmath6 ( @xcite ) .    in the next section",
    "we will describe how the data were obtained .",
    "we also discuss the special observing techniques in the mir and their implications on data reduction .",
    "we present the results of our observations in sec .",
    "[ results ] and interpret them in sec .",
    "[ discussion ] .",
    "our observations were carried out with maniac , the mid- and near - infrared array camera ( @xcite ) built at the max - planck - institut fr extraterrestrische physik in garching , germany .",
    "ngc  253 was observed during five nights at the eso 2.2 m telescope in lasilla , chile in october 1996 .",
    "the average seeing was below 1 , therefore the data have a spatial resolution defined by the diffraction limit of about 1.4 .",
    "we used three narrow band filters ( @xmath7 ) centered on the [ neii ] line ( 12.81  ) and two continuum positions shortwards ( 12.62  ) and longwards ( 13.00  ) .",
    "this is essential for accurate continuum subtraction , because strong silicate absorption features and emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) make it difficult or even impossible to determine the continuum emission underlying the [ neii ]  line from n - band photometry .",
    "the mean of the two continuum images should represent the emission underlying the [ neii ] , its subtraction from the 12.81  map then reveals the distribution of the [ neii ] emission .",
    "the total on - source integration time was about 9600  s on the [ neii ] filter and 4800  s on each of the two continuum filters .    due to the high thermal background of the atmosphere at wavelengths around 10  , rapid readout of the detector , chopping of the telescope secondary , as well as frequent",
    "beam switching is essential .",
    "we typically used a chop amplitude of 15 so that the source remained on the maniac detector all the time .",
    "the correct telescope movement for the beam switch was defined with high precision by alternate guiding on each of the two ( chopped ) images of a nearby guide star .    the sky signal through the filters allowed single frame integration times of 80  ms before saturating the detector .",
    "frames taken immediately after the chop movement were discarded because of the settling time of the secondary .",
    "after 1  min , the data ( two sums of about 375 frames for each chop position ) were transferred to the maniac pc and the beam switch was performed .",
    "after subtraction of the two beams , the residual background emission in our data is typically reduced by a factor of @xmath8 , as can be determined from empty regions in our images .    during the course of the night one gathers many such exposures , which have to be coadded . because of refraction by the atmosphere , the source slowly changes position on the detector as the zenith distance changes .",
    "we correct for this drift by coadding a few exposures both at the beginning and the end of the observations to increase the signal - to - noise ratio , and determining the centroids of the well - defined emission peak .",
    "their difference in position gives the drift over this timeline .",
    "assuming it to be linear with time , we can estimate the drift per exposure and correct each before coadding them .",
    "the chop amplitude and direction , required for the correct overlay of the three source images on the detector , was accurately determined by observing a point source in an identical way , and fitting gaussians to its three images .",
    "finally , the resulting maps were calibrated for ( slightly ) different filter transmissions and a mean image for each filter was generated from the data of the individual nights . because the 12.81  filter showed a ghost reflection during the october 1996 run , the filter maps had to be deconvolved with their point spread functions ( psf ) before subtraction .",
    "we used a clean algorithm ( @xcite ) with observations of reference stars as the psf for each filter .",
    "since the observations described here are diffraction limited , the psf is much more stable and the deconvolution more reliable than is normally the case .",
    "flux calibration of our data was performed by assuming that the 12.8  flux density of the nearby star @xmath9 ceti is 53  jy .",
    "this number was extrapolated from the 12  iras flux and a blackbody temperature of 4200  k. the flux density inside a 5.5 aperture at 12.8  is 17  jy which should be compared to the value of 11.2  jy given by @xcite in the same aperture at 12.6  .",
    "the total flux density in our map is 35  jy , about a factor of 2.5 higher than the result of keto  ( 1993 ) , measured at 12.5  . on the other hand ,",
    "the [ neii ] flux we derive from the central 7.6 is @xmath10  w / m@xmath11 , roughly 60% of the result by @xcite .",
    "the data thus seem to agree to some extent , although it should be stressed that a direct comparison between various data sets is problematic because of the differences in filter passbands and bandwidths .",
    "this is especially true in the mir since this regime is rich in spectral features .",
    "the results of the above data reduction are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( plate 1 ) .",
    "we show in panel a ) the `` raw '' 12.81  filter map before deconvolution with the psf and in b ) the deconvolved 12.81  map .",
    "panels c ) and d ) contain the two deconvolved continuum maps at 12.62  and 13.00  .",
    "finally , panel e ) shows the resulting [ neii ] line map , calculated as described in sec .",
    "the continuum maps show a good overall agreement with other mir maps at comparable resolution ( @xcite ) , although there are differences in the detailed emission morphology .",
    "this emphasizes our point that a reliable continuum subtraction is only possible with narrow band continuum filters neighboring the emission line .    since both the strongest two continuum sources and the elongated emission structure along the major axis of the ngc  253 disk at p.a .",
    "51   ( @xcite ) are easily identified , we can safely adopt the astrometry and terminology used by kw94 ( sec . [ intro ] ) .",
    "for the remainder of this paper , we will identify our strongest continuum source with peak  1 and the secondary continuum source with peak  2 , keeping in mind that at nir wavelengths peak  2 is offset by @xmath0 1  to the east .",
    "the most striking result of the [ neii ] map is that the emission forms a double - peaked , arc - like structure .",
    "the brightest source coincides with peak  1 , adding to the evidence that it is indeed powered by a burst of star formation .",
    "the opposite end of the arc seems to coincide with peak  2 , but is somewhat elongated in e - w direction .",
    "the [ neii ] morphology is in excellent agreement with the  map of @xcite .",
    "it is important that the [ neii ] emission from the central @xmath0 5is aligned with the major axis of the ngc  253 optical disk . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we show again contour plots of the [ neii ] and continuum emission to demonstrate its relative orientation .",
    "the line of nodes at p.a .",
    "51  is indicated by the dashed line .",
    "the dotted line shows the orientation of the nir bar detected first by @xcite .",
    "the [ neii ] morphology and its relation to the nir bar will be further discussed in sec .",
    "[ discussion ] .      adopting the coordinates of peak  1 of kw94",
    ", we can relate our maps to the astrometry at longer wavelengths . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , we have marked the location of the compact radio sources of th85 on both the [ neii ] and the continuum emission . as can be seen",
    ", the major axis of the [ neii ] emission coincides well with the radio axis .",
    "the radio nucleus th  2 - or extinction peak according to @xcite - does fall on none of the [ neii ] or continuum peaks .",
    "rather , th  2 lies inside the arc - like [ neii ] emission region .",
    "this supports the view of th85 that th  2 is most likely not an hii region , but a synchroton source in the dynamical center of ngc  253 .",
    "all other radio point sources are distributed rather randomly in the plane of the [ neii ] emission , supporting the idea of them being radio supernovae ( th85 ) .    to summarize , the location of the nucleus of ngc  253 lies in the center of the [ neii ] emission arc , about 2.2 northeast of peak  1 in a region with high extinction .",
    "from 10  resolution k - band imaging , @xcite find a prominent nir bar at p.a .",
    "68 . however , the nir continuum of the central @xmath0 10  in all high resolution nir maps ( e.g. forbes  1993 , kw94 , sams  1994 ) is oriented at p.a .",
    "51 , roughly parallel to the major axis of the optical disk .",
    "this change in orientation is also visible as an isophote twist in @xcite and all mir maps ( @xcite , fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "what is the reason for this behavior ? from kinematical studies of the cs(2 - 1 ) line at 98  ghz , @xcite have tried to answer this question .",
    "they derived a model for the dynamical processes in the center of ngc  253 . in short ,",
    "they find five prominent cs emission spots .",
    "the two innermost spots are aligned along the axis of the radio knots , i.e. the major axis of ngc  253 .",
    "they are separated by @xmath0 3  and positioned symmetrically on either side of the radio nucleus .",
    "two other knots lie again symmetrically to the nucleus , but are aligned with the large scale nir bar .",
    "their observations are well explained by a rotating gas torus around the dynamical center of ngc  253 .",
    "the torus is the response of the viscous molecular gas to the potential of the nir stellar bar .",
    "gas clouds in the inner @xmath0 10  move along elliptical @xmath12 orbits whose major axis is aligned perpendicular to the bar ( athanassoula 1992a , b ) . at the inclination of ngc  253 , these orbits appear to be oriented parallel to the major axis of the optical disk as demonstrated in fig .  5 of @xcite .",
    "the gas clouds outside of @xmath0 10  move on @xmath13 orbits , their major axis being aligned with the bar . the existence of @xmath12 orbits depends on the presence of at least one inner lindblad resonance ( ilr ) . for the case of ngc  253 ,",
    "@xcite have shown that there are in fact two ilrs , one at a radius of 25 , the other close to the nucleus .",
    "it is at the inner ilr , where the orientation of the dominant orbits changes from @xmath12 to @xmath13 ( e.g. @xcite ) . because of orbit crowding ,",
    "massive star formation occurs predominantly at the apocenters of the @xmath12 orbits ( @xcite ) , oriented symmetrically on either side of the nucleus .",
    "therefore , @xcite interpret their cs results as evidence for a rotating torus of dense gas around the radio nucleus th  2 .",
    "these results are in agreement with observations of other tracers of high density gas like hcn ( @xcite ) .",
    "based on their model , @xcite predict that higher resolution line mapping should prove that gas emission from the central 10  ( 145  pc ) of ngc  253 is aligned with the radio knots rather than with the optical disk . in that context ,",
    "our results provide an independent confirmation of this scenario .",
    "firstly , the [ neii ] emission is well aligned with the radio knots ( figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( plate 1 ) and [ fig2 ] ) . secondly , based on the structure of the [ neii ] emission",
    ", we also confirm the distribution of the star forming material in a ring around the radio nucleus .",
    "the ring has a rotation velocity of @xmath0 60  km / s as seen in the cs data by @xcite , the western side moving away from the observer .",
    "unfortunately , our observations are unable to resolve the velocity structure of the [ neii ] , this has to await higher resolution line mapping , e.g. with a cryogenic fabry - perot interferometer .",
    "our data only show weak emission from the southeastern half of the ring . on the other hand",
    ", the [ feii ] map of @xcite does show emission from this region ( their source b ) .",
    "thus , we favor the interpretation of the double - peaked morphology as a starburst ring with a diameter of @xmath0 4  ( 60  pc ) . the total observed flux from a circular aperture with 1.4 ( 20  pc ) diameter centered on peak  1 is @xmath14  w / m@xmath11 .",
    "after dereddening with @xmath15 ( sams  1994 ) in a mixed case scenario , this corresponds to @xmath16 ( @xcite ) ] .    with the conversion factor @xmath17 } }",
    "= 64 $ ] ( @xcite ) , the intrinsic lyman - continuum luminosity is @xmath18 .",
    "this value should be used with caution given its uncertainties , but it compares well to other bright star forming regions like the core of 30  doradus in the lmc ( @xcite ) or the brightest sfr in the gaseous ring of ic  342 ( @xcite ) .",
    "this supports the view that the [ neii ] emission probably stems from individual giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) that actively form stars and are located in a ring at the ilr . we will extend the comparison to a similar structure in ic  342 in the next section",
    "it is interesting to note the close similarities between ngc  253 and ic  342 , another nearby late type spiral .",
    "bker  ( 1997b ) describe the dynamical processes in the central 100  pc of ic  342 as derived from nir integral field spectroscopy .",
    "table [ tab1 ] compares the two galaxies .",
    "[ tab1 ]    the dynamical processes and the morphology of the molecular gas are almost identical .",
    "this was also noted by paglione  ( 1995 )",
    ". one important difference , however , is that ic  342 does not house a central synchroton source .",
    "in fact , in the case of ic  342 , there is no radio emission from the dynamical center ( @xcite ) .",
    "rather , it is occupied by a cluster of young red supergiants that dominate the nir continuum . for ngc  253",
    ", there is no obvious nir component at the location of the radio nucleus , but the edge - on orientation and patchy extinction might complicate its detection . both the diameter and rotation velocity of the molecular rings are very similar .",
    "this adds to the increasing evidence that stellar bars and small star formation rings on scales of 50 - 100  pc are a common feature in late type spirals .",
    "this points to an evolutionary connection between spirals of different hubble type , as suggested by @xcite .",
    "we have reported on mir line and continuum mapping of the central 200  pc of ngc  253 .",
    "the main results can be summarized as follows : + 1 ) the continuum maps confirm that the nucleus of ngc  253 is not identified with any strong ir source .",
    "+ 2 ) the [ neii ] map reveals two peaks separated by about 4  and connected by an arc - shaped emission region .",
    "+ 3 ) the nucleus lies inside the [ neii ] arc .",
    "+ 4 ) we interpret the morphology of the [ neii ] map as evidence for a bar - triggered starformation ring with a diameter of 50  pc , similar to that seen in ic  342 .    it is a pleasure to thank thomas lehmann for his invaluable help before , during , and after the campaign .",
    "we are indebted to the eso 2.2m - team for their continuous support , and to rolf chini and craig smith who helped a great deal with the observations .",
    "we also would like to acknowledge thomas ott for his expertise on deconvolution algorithms , and the anonymous referee whose comments led us to re - examine the point spread function and thereby substantially improve this paper .",
