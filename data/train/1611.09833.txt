    "all leaves have infinitely many ends , infinite genus , or both .    in this context , it is natural to ask : which closed 3-manifolds admit minimal foliations by hyperbolic surfaces ?",
    "of which type ?",
    "there are well - known obstructions to the existence of these foliations , dating back to the 1960 s through the 1990 s .",
    "we combine them in section  [ sgeomstruc ] to see which of the eight thurston geometric structures contain foliated manifolds by hyperbolic surfaces . as way of summary",

    "although this seems part of the folklore of the golden age of foliations , we have tried to update these techniques to obtain examples of interest from a modern perspective based in the interplay between topology and dynamical systems . in sections  [ swithoutholonomy ]  and  [ sbranching ] , in the same spirit , we show two different methods to construct minimal foliations on hyperbolic 3-manifolds .",
    "firstly , by deforming their fibrations , we obtain minimal foliations without holonomy by geometrically infinite surfaces on hyperbolic 3-manifolds that fiber over the circle ( having first betti number greater than @xmath11 ) .",
    "this uses a very recent construction of pseudo - anosov homeomorphisms which are partially torelli by i. agol , c. j. leininger and d. margalit @xcite .",
    "next , we describe a method to obtain via branched coverings minimal foliations by geometrically infinite surfaces on hyperbolic 3-manifolds from the center-(un)stable folation of a anosov flow on a @xmath7 manifold .",
    "this method applies to any fiber bundle over the circle whose monodromy has a stretch factor which is quadratic over @xmath12 , according to a theorem by j. franks and e. ryyken @xcite , but in section  [ sanosov ] it is also illustrated from the `` bare hands '' description of two examples : the pseudo - anosov homeomorphisms constructed by f. laudenbach in the celebrated volume on _ travaux de thurston sur les surfaces _ and the translation surfaces obtained as branched covers of a torus .",
    "minimal foliations are always taut , and all the examples are @xmath13-covered in the sense that the leaf space of the lifted foliation to the universal covering of the manifold is hausdorff , and then diffeomorphic to @xmath13 . in the last section  [ splume ] , we construct an example of minimal taut foliation by geometrically infinite hyperbolic surfaces which is not @xmath13-covered .",
    "in fact , the leaf space of the lifted foliation is diffeomorphic to the `` plume compose '' of @xcite .",

    "the interior of @xmath537 is foliated by planes ( since all leaves inject their fundamental groups in the fundamental grooup of the interior of @xmath483 , again due to novikov s theorem ) and therefore by palmeira s theorem it is diffeomorphic to @xmath5 .",
    "the boundary of @xmath537 consists of countable infinite planes , the liftings of the boundary , and each plane is foliated by parallel lines corresponding to the circle boundaries of the leaves .",
    "3 .   a simple closed curve @xmath523 which parametrizes a circle fiber and is entirely contained in @xmath538 lifts to @xmath537 to a countable infinite simple closed curves @xmath522 in the interior of @xmath537 and each curve @xmath522 meets every leaf in the interior in exactly one point .",
    "therefore the leaf space of the lifted foliation is diffeomorphic to @xmath13 .",
    "[ gluing_along_an_interval ] each boundary component contains exactly one connected component @xmath539 of the lift of @xmath39 , which is a curve diffeomorphic to @xmath13 .",
    "therefore , the set of leaves that intersect each boundary plane component is parametrized by bounded open interval in @xmath13 with the above identification of the leaf space of the foliation on @xmath537 with @xmath13 .",
    "let @xmath540 be the universal covering projection .",
    "let @xmath541 and @xmath542 . then @xmath543 and @xmath544 are disjoint unions @xmath545 and @xmath546 where each @xmath547 and @xmath548 are diffeomorphic to @xmath537 .",
    "let @xmath549 be the foliation which is the lift of @xmath1 to @xmath550 .",
    "each connected component @xmath547 is either disjoint from @xmath551 with @xmath552 , or else @xmath547 and @xmath551 intersect in a single boundary component since otherwise one can easily construct a loop in @xmath550 which is not homotopic to a constant and that would be a contradiction .",
    "this implies in particular that a leaf @xmath553 is either disjoint from @xmath547 or @xmath551 or intersects each of these sets in a connected set which is a leaf of the foliation in that set .",

    "therefore the disjoint union @xmath558 of the countable collection of disjoint curves @xmath554 and @xmath555 is a complete transversal of @xmath43 because every leaf of @xmath44 meets at least one of these curves .",

    "these curves @xmath554 and @xmath555 serve as coordinate charts of the leaf space , but we have to identify points on the same leaves . in other words , the leaf space of @xmath44 is obtained from @xmath558 identifying two points if they belong to the same leaf .",
    "thus a point in @xmath554 ( respectively @xmath555 ) is not identified with other point in @xmath554 ( respectively @xmath555 ) .    if the indices @xmath560 are such that @xmath547 and @xmath551 meet along a boundary component , due to property ( 4 ) above , this glues @xmath554 and @xmath555 along the interval @xmath561 .",
    "since @xmath547 and @xmath551 intersect only along leaves which are parametrized by this interval @xmath561 , the leaves of @xmath44 passing through the points @xmath562 and @xmath563 ( resp . @xmath564 and @xmath565 ) are not equal .",
    "this creates two pairs of non - hausdorff branching points corresponding to the points @xmath389 and @xmath566 .",
    "since @xmath40 acts minimally on the leaf space @xmath567 , this happens for a dense set of points in @xmath558 and therefore @xmath567 is homeomorphic to the _ plume compose_.",
    "using theorem  [ thm : franks ] , we have obtained foliations of hyperbolic @xmath14-manifolds which share some interesting properties :      as explained before , there are complete closed transversals to the foliations @xmath143 and @xmath1 which have the same holonomy pseudogroup . hence @xmath143 and @xmath1 are minimal taut foliations with the same transverse dynamics .",
    "in particular , both foliations are transversely affine .",
    "since the foliation @xmath1 is taut , it has no reeb component and novikov s theorem implies that each leaf of @xmath1 embeds its fundamental group into the fundamental group of the hyperbolic manifold @xmath2 . as proved in section  [ spre ] , @xmath1 lifts to a foliation @xmath549 by properly embedded hyperbolic planes on the universal cover @xmath568 .",
    "moreover , since @xmath143 and @xmath1 have the same transverse structure , @xmath569 is diffeomorphic to @xmath13 and @xmath1 is @xmath13-covered .",

    "if @xmath170 belongs to the fundamental group of the leaf @xmath584 passing through a point @xmath585 and @xmath576 projects on @xmath261 , then @xmath170 fixes the leaf @xmath582 acting on it as a deck transformation .",
    "for each point @xmath586 , its image @xmath587 where @xmath588 acts on @xmath574 as a discrete subgroup of @xmath589 . as the fundamental group of @xmath584 is a purely hyperbolic fuchsian group of the first kind , the limit set @xmath590 is the whole circle at infinity .      returning to diagram @xmath591 , since the action of @xmath40 preserves the lifted foliation @xmath549 , it induces an action on the leaf space of @xmath549 , which is homeomorphic to @xmath13 .",
    "then the fundamental group of the each leaf can be seen as the stabilizer of the leaf .",
