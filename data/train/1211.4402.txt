    "einstein - aether theory @xcite consists of general relativity coupled , at second derivative order , to a dynamical timelike unit vector field  the aether .",
    "it is one of several proposed models of early universe cosmology which incorporate a violation of lorentz invariance @xcite . in this effective field theory approach , the aether vector field , @xmath0 , and the metric tensor @xmath1 together",
    "determine the local spacetime structure .",
    "we shall discuss the late time dynamics of einstein - aether cosmological models ; in particular we explore the impact of lorentz violation on the inflationary scenario @xcite , which provides one of the simplest ways to describe various aspects of the physics of the early universe in standard cosmology .",
    "more precisely , we study the inflationary scenario in the scalar - vector - tensor theory where the vector is constrained to be unit and time like , and investigate whether an example of the large class of the inflationary solutions proposed @xcite are stable when spatial curvature perturbations are considered .      in an isotropic and spatially homogeneous friedmann universe with expansion scale factor @xmath2 and comoving proper time @xmath3 , the aether field will be aligned with the cosmic frame and is related to the expansion rate of the universe .",
    "the einstein equations are generalized by the contribution of an additional stress tensor for the aether field .",
    "if the universe contains a single self - interacting scalar field @xmath4 ( e.g. , a scalar inflation which would dominate in any inflationary epoch ) , with a self interaction potential @xmath5 that can now be a function of @xmath6 and the expansion rate @xmath7 then the modified stress tensor is @xcite    @xmath8    this corresponds to an effective fluid with pressure @xmath9 and density @xmath10 of the form @xmath11 and @xmath12 , where @xmath13 .    the energy - momentum conservation law or klein - gordon eqn .",
    "is @xmath14the augmented friedmann equation ( with the addition of the aether stress to the energy density , and where @xmath15 , and @xmath16 is the renormalized gravitational constant ) is given by :    @xmath17    where @xmath18 is the curvature parameter , and the friedmann metric is given by @xmath19 [ in @xcite @xmath18 was set equal to zero ] .",
    "the raychaudhuri eqn . follows from the differentiation of the friedmann eqn .",
    "exponential potentials of the form @xmath20 arise naturally in various higher dimensional frameworks , such as in kaluza - klein theories and supergravity @xcite , and the dynamical properties of the positive exponential potentials leading to inflation in the friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) model have been widely studied @xcite . in einstein - aether theories there might exist a coupling between the scalar field and the aether field through the aether expansion scalar @xmath21 , which requires one to consider more general types of potentials than the standard exponential form . in @xcite",
    "barrow proposes an ansatz of the form    @xmath22+\\sum_{r=0}^{n}a_{r}\\theta ^{r}\\exp [ ( r-2)\\lambda \\phi /2 ] ,   \\label{3}\\ ] ]    where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are constants , and concludes that there exist power law solutions of the einstein - aether - generalized combined friedmann - klein gordon system on the form @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a solution of the polynomial equation @xmath27 he presents two potentials for which explicit solutions to can be found , namely potentials where @xmath28 and potentials where only @xmath29 is different from zero .",
    "this corresponds to , respectively , the ordinary exponential potential and an exponential potential plus a term quadratic in the expansion .",
    "we shall consider one of barrow s examples where the exponential part couples to the expansion scalar .",
    "we shall study the case : @xmath30 where , for convenience , we have renormalized the constant @xmath31 ( the constant @xmath29 can be absorbed @xcite and will not play an essential role in the dynamical analysis ) .",
    "the potential @xmath32 can be assumed to be positive definite , but this does not imply that the constants @xmath33 necessarily are positive , as can be seen in the positive definite potential @xmath34 where @xmath31 is negative and @xmath35 .    if @xmath33 are small , the potential can be thought of as a perturbation of the standard exponential potential . for very large constants",
    "@xmath33 we can study non - perturbative generalizations .    for the potential",
    "the augmented friedmann equation becomes @xmath36 where we have normalized the equation with a factor proportional to the square of the expansion .",
    "the normalized friedmann equation suggest a suitable set of expansion normalized variables : @xmath37 assuming that @xmath38 is a positive constant and that @xmath29 is larger than @xmath39 . in terms of these variables",
    "the friedmann equation assumes the simple form @xmath40 and the raychaudhuri equation ( expressed in terms of the deceleration parameter @xmath41 ) becomes @xmath42 using the raychaudhuri equation one can express the klein - gordon equation as a first order ordinary differential equation completely in terms of the expansion normalized variables , and an expansion normalized time : @xmath43 : @xmath44 where the constants @xmath45 and @xmath46 are defined through @xmath47 the evolution equation for @xmath48 is directly given from the definition of @xmath48 and the klein - gordon and raychaudhuri equations : @xmath49    the equations , constitute an autonomous system of first order differential equations .",
    "the invariant set @xmath50 corresponds to a model with a free scalar field , and it divides the two - dimensional ( 2d ) state space into a region with an expanding universe ( @xmath51 ) and one corresponding to a contracting universe ( @xmath52 ) .    the curvature @xmath53 is determined from the friedmann equation , but an auxiliary evolution equation can be derived from , : @xmath54 k$ ] , showing that @xmath55 is an invariant set that also partitions the state space into two disjoint regions : a bounded negative curvature region @xmath56 , and an unbounded positive curvature region @xmath57 .",

    "linearization about the points will result in the same eigenvalues as before for the eigendirections contained in the @xmath92 subspace , but will also pick up a new eigenvalue from the influence of the fluid on the dynamics .",
    "the additional eigenvalues are :    @xmath93    equilibrium points @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath72 all gain an eigenvalue that is negative for all @xmath94 .",
    "the new eigenvalue transforms the source(s ) to saddle(s ) but retains @xmath72 as a sink in the same range as before .",
    "how it affects the points @xmath70 and @xmath71 is not immediately obvious , but as we shall see below it does not affect the properties of the sinks when @xmath95 is in the range @xmath96 .      the point remains a sink if , in addition to the conditions in the previous section , also @xmath97 solving for @xmath98 we get @xmath99 for @xmath100 this condition reduces to @xmath101 which is the same restriction as before . since the r.h.s .",
    "of is increasing with @xmath95 we have that @xmath70 is a sink in the same range as before for all @xmath102 .      the third eigenvalue is negative if @xmath103 which implies @xmath104 for @xmath105 this inequality also coincides with with one of the previous restrictions on @xmath46 required for @xmath71 to be a sink .",
    "larger @xmath95 gives a weaker restriction and hence is @xmath71 a sink in the same range as before if we have @xmath102 .",
    "there are also additional equilibrium points with @xmath107 :    corresponding to the flat frw solution is @xmath108 with eigenvalues @xmath109 hence @xmath110 is a saddle in the entire range considered , @xmath87 .",

    "@xmath112 the point @xmath111 has zero curvature and the deceleration parameter is given by @xmath113 which is negative for @xmath114 .",
    "linearization of the system - about the equilibrium point @xmath111 yields the eigenvalues : @xmath115 where @xmath116    the last eigenvalue is negative for all the values of @xmath95 that we consider in this paper .",
    "the value of @xmath117 can be both positive and negative depending on the values of @xmath95 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 .",
    "but since the terms under the square root in @xmath118 always are positive and hence @xmath118 real , we have that the expression @xmath119 is either positive or purely imaginary",
    ". the eigenvalue @xmath120 will therefore always have negative real part , and the point @xmath111 will always be a saddle .",
    "we also briefly take a look at more general potentials .",
    "in particular , we consider the potential of the form with a single non - zero @xmath121 ( @xmath122 an arbitrary integer ) : @xmath123 where @xmath121 here is normalized by an appropriate power of @xmath38 .",
    "defining normalized variables @xmath124 and @xmath125 as before , @xmath126 the normalized friedmann eqn . becomes @xmath127 where @xmath128 and we shall define @xmath129 .",

    ": @xmath137 whence we obtain @xmath138 it can easily be checked that these values for @xmath125 , @xmath124 do indeed satisfy the zero - curvature condition and are equilibrium values of the system . for vanishing @xmath139",

    "linearization of the system , is more complicated with a general power @xmath122 , but an approximate linearization for small @xmath139 around the zero - curvature solution is possible .",
    "we have analyzed the dynamical evolution and stability of inflationary solutions of homogeneous and isotropic einstein - aether cosmologies containing a scalar field , under the assumption that the scalar field interacts with itself and the aether through a potential given by .",
    "the potential is of the general form proposed in @xcite and more general than the examples explicitly studied therein .",
    "we find that the scalar field - aether interaction term only slightly affects the stable solution of the system for small values of the normalized scalar field self interaction coupling @xmath46 , even when the normalized scalar field - eather coupling @xmath45 is large .",
    "when large scalar field self interactions are considered there is a qualitative change in the future stable equilibrium of the system compared to the ordinary exponential potential case . for negative values of the coupling @xmath45",
    "there exists a region ( region ii , fig .",
    "[ sinkplots ] ) where the stable equilibrium is spatially flat but non - inflationary , a situation that in the normal case requires fine tuning of @xmath46 .",
    "even larger scalar field self interactions destabilizes the flat equilibrium and drives the state towards a spatially curved equilibrium , like in the normal exponential potential case .",
    "when we also include a matter source term in the form of a perfect fluid with linear equation of state that does not couple directly to the other fields , we find equilibrium states corresponding to the usual frw model and matter scaling solution .",
    "the precise value of the normalized field variables of the latter equilibrium depend on the coupling @xmath45 , but the qualitative properties like its curvature and deceleration parameter do not .",
    "the equilibrium point is a saddle when curvature perturbations are considered , like in the normal case , but even within the flat models it can remain a saddle for some values of @xmath46 and @xmath45 , unlike the case with an ordinary exponential potential where the matter scaling solution is a late time attractor .",
    "the matter source term do not qualitatively alter the stability of the sinks found earlier , they all obtain a stable manifold of one dimension larger than previously and thus remain sinks .    also potentials with a coupling between the exponential part and the expansion of general order are susceptible to a dynamical systems analysis in the scale invariant variables .",
    "the problem of finding a scale invariant solution with zero curvature can be reduced to solving a polynomial equation , and the solutions all reduce to the standard inflationary power - law solution when the coupling becomes arbitrarily small .",
