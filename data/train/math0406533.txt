    "the problem of _ maximum likelihood estimation _ is to find parameters @xmath3 which best explain the data @xmath12 .",
    "this leads to the following optimization problem : @xmath13 under suitable assumptions we have an optimal solution @xmath14 to the problem ( [ mle ] ) , which is an algebraic function of the data @xmath12 . our goal is to compute the degree of that algebraic function .",
    "we call this number the _ maximum likelihood degree _ of the model @xmath15 .",
    "equivalently , the _ ml degree _ is the number of complex solutions to the critical equations of ( [ mle ] ) , for a general data vector @xmath12 . in this paper",
    "we prove results of the following form :    [ thm1 ] let @xmath1 be polynomials of degrees @xmath16 in @xmath17 unknowns . if the maximum likelihood degree of the model @xmath18 is finite then it is less than or equal to the coefficient of @xmath19 in the generating function @xmath20 equality holds if the coefficients of the polynomials @xmath21 are sufficiently generic .    as an example , consider a model given by @xmath22 quadratic polynomials in @xmath23 parameters .",

    "we present the algebraic geometry for studying critical points of a rational function @xmath29 on an irreducible projective variety @xmath30 .",

    "we study the case when @xmath30 is a smooth toric variety , and we derive a formula for the ml degree when the @xmath21 s are laurent polynomials which are generic relative to their newton polytopes . for instance , example [ rectangles ] shows that the ml degree is @xmath37 if we replace ( [ 2by2table ] ) by @xmath38    section 4 is concerned with the relationship of the ml degree to the bounded regions of the complement of @xmath39 in @xmath5 .",
    "the number of these regions is a lower bound to the number of real solutions of the critical equations , and therefore a lower bound to the ml degree .",

    "this section also discusses how resolution of singularities can be used to compute the ml degree for nongeneric polynomials .",
    "section 6 deals with topological methods for determining the ml degree .",
    "theorem [ euler ] shows that , under certain restrictive hypotheses , it coincides with the euler characteristic of the complex manifold @xmath41 , and theorem [ semiconti ] offers a general version of the semi - continuity principle which underlies the inequality in theorem [ thm1 ] . in section 7",
    "we relate the ml degree to the sheaf of logarithmic vector fields along @xmath34 , which is the sheaf dual to @xmath42 .",
    "this paper was motivated by recent appearances of the concept of ml degree in statistics and computational biology .",
    "chor , khetan and snir @xcite showed that the ml degree of a phylogenetic model equals @xmath43 , and geiger , meek and sturmfels @xcite proved that an undirected graphical model has ml degree one if and only if it is decomposable .",
