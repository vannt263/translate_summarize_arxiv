    "a fundamental difference between quantum and classical physics is the possible existence of nonclassical correlations in quantum systems .",
    "the physical property responsible for this quantum correlation is called entanglement @xcite .",
    "entanglement has been recognized as an important resource for quantum information and computation @xcite .",
    "however the role of entanglement in quantum phase transition ( qpt ) @xcite is of considerable interest .",
    "qpt as well as classical ones are characterized by detecting nonanalytic behaviors in some physical properties of the system .",
    "it is often accompanied by divergence in some correlation functions , but quantum systems possess additional correlations which do not exist in a classical counterpart , the entanglement .",
    "entanglement is a direct measure of quantum correlations and shows nonanalytic behavior such as discontinuity in the vicinity of the quantum phase transition point @xcite .",
    "an important motivation to study the interconnection between condensed matter and quantum information is to investigate whether it is possible to better characterize condensed matter states by looking at their entanglement properties .",
    "recently , there has been extensive analysis of entanglement in quantum spin models @xcite .",
    "various models were considered for entanglement generation and their static @xcite as well as dynamical properties @xcitewere investigated .",
    "a thorough understanding of the dynamical evolution of entanglement in the spin models has obviously implications for the performance of quantum information processing , as well as for understanding of fundamental quantum mechanics .",
    "our main purpose in this work is to compose the ideas of quantum renormalization group @xcite and quantum information theory to study the evolution of the dynamical properties of the spin models in low energy states . to have a concrete discussion , the one dimensional @xmath0 ising model in transverse field ( itf )",
    "has been considered by implementing the quantum renormalization group ( qrg ) approach @xcite .",
    "the main idea of the rg method is the mode elimination or thinning of the degrees of freedom followed by an iteration which reduces the number of variables step by step until reaching a fixed point . in kadanoff s",
    "approach , the lattice is divided into blocks .",
    "each block is treated independently to build the projection operator onto the lower energy subspace .",
    "the projection of the inter - block interaction is mapped to an effective hamiltonian ( @xmath1 ) which acts on the renormalized subspace @xcite .",
    "we have considered the itf model on a periodic chain of @xmath2 sites with hamiltonian h =- j_i=1^n(_i^x_i+1^x+g_i^z ) .",
    "[ eq1 ]    where @xmath3 is the exchange coupling and @xmath4 is the transverse field . from the exact solution",
    "@xcite it is known that a second order phase transition occurs for @xmath5 where the behavior of the order parameter or magnetization is given by @xmath6 for @xmath7 and @xmath8 for @xmath9 .    to implement qrg the hamiltonian",
    "is divided to two - site blocks , @xmath10 with @xmath11 .",
    "the remaining part of the hamiltonian is included in the inter - block part , @xmath12 where @xmath13 refers to the @xmath14-component of the pauli matrix at site @xmath15 of the block labeled by @xmath16 .",
    "the hamiltonian of each block ( @xmath17 ) is diagonalized exactly and the projection operator ( @xmath18 ) is constructed from the two lowest eigenstates , @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the ground state and @xmath21 is the first excited state . in this respect the effective hamiltonian ( @xmath22p_{0}$ ] )",
    "is similar to the original one ( eq.([eq1 ] ) ) replacing the couplings with the following renormalized coupling constants .",
    "[ eq2 ] j=j ,  q = g+ ,  g=g^2 .",
    "the entanglement is a local quantity which includes the global properties of a system .",
    "generally , the global properties of a system enters the entanglement effectively by summing over the whole degrees of freedom except the local one . in other words ,",
    "a system can be supposed of a single site and a heat bath ( the rest of system ) . it is supposed that the effect of a heat bath can be replaced by an effective single site quantity , _ the entanglement_. the effective single site represents the long range properties of the model and not the microscopic ones .",
    "therefor we can enter the global properties of the model to entanglement ( the local quantity ) using the renormalization group idea . in this respect , we always think of a two site model which can be treated exactly .",
    "however , the coupling constants of the two site model are the effective ones which are given by the renormalization group procedure .",
    "this can be used as an new method to calculate the low energy states dynamic of entanglement in a large system .",
    "the two site hamiltonian of itf model in the space spanned by @xmath23 denote the eigenstates of @xmath24 ) , can be expressed as    [ eq4 ] h =- j (    cccc 2 g & 0 & 0 & 1 + 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 + 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 + 1 & 0 & 0 & -2 g    )    however the time evolution operator @xmath25 of the two site hamiltonian ( eq.([eq4 ] ) ) has the following form    [ eq5 ] u(t)=j (    cccc u_11(t ) & 0 & 0 & u_14(t ) + 0 & u_22(t ) & u_23(t ) & 0 + 0 & u_32(t ) & u_33(t ) & 0 + u_41(t ) & 0 & 0 & u_44(t )    )    where    u_11(t)&=&i(jt)+(jt ) , + u_14(t)&=&u_41(t)=(jt ) , + u_22(t)&=&u_33(t)=jt ,  u_23(t)=u_32(t)=ijt , + u_44(t)&=&u^_11 .    the density matrix for the two sites system at time @xmath26 is @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the the density matrix of system at @xmath29 which is the thermal equilibrium of the system .",
    "we choose the thermal ground sate of the pure ising model ( no transverse field applied ) @xmath30 as the initial state which the concurrence equals zero .    here",
    "@xmath31 and @xmath32 are the two degenerate ground state of ising model with all spins pointing respectively to the positive and negative @xmath33 direction .     for @xmath34 and in the inset for @xmath35.,width=340 ]    for bipartite entanglement , a commonly used measure for arbitrary state of two qubits is the so called concurrence @xcite .",
    "the concurrence is defined as    [ eq6 ] c(t)=max\\{0,2_max(t)-tr }    where @xmath36 , and @xmath37 is the largest eigenvalue of the matrix @xmath38 .",
    "therefor the analytic expression of the concurrence in terms of the parameters defined for the two site system is    [ eq7 ] c(t)=.    we have plotted the evolution of @xmath39 under rg steps versus @xmath4 for @xmath34 and @xmath35 in fig.[fig1 ] which shows that the concurrence changes from the equilibrium state and start to oscillating when the external magnetic filed is turned on . as @xmath4 increases , the height of each peak decreases gradually and finally vanish as @xmath40 . increasing the length of chain",
    "enhances the oscillation of the concurrence versus the magnetic field .",
    "however as the length of chain increases the first peak of concurrence approaches the critical point ( @xmath5 ) and at the thermodynamic limit the system becomes disentangled except at the critical point .",
    "surviving of the concurrence at the critical point is the results of the correlation length divergence at @xmath5 .",
    "the evolution of concurrence under rg has been plotted in fig.[fig2 ] versus @xmath26 for @xmath41 and @xmath5 . from the eq.([eq7 ] ) , it is easy to see that the concurrence is periodically fluctuating with the time @xmath26 with period of @xmath42",
    ". figure.[fig2 ] shows that the concurrence reduces under rg ( increasing the size of system ) and disappears in the large system .",
    "but for @xmath5 there is no concurrence reduction under rg and the concurrence of different length chains coincide with each other ( inset of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .     for different length chain for @xmath41 .",
    "the inset shows the concurrence of different lattice sizes collapse on a single curve at the critical point ( @xmath5).,width=321 ]    the non - analytic behaviour in some physical quantity is a feature of second - order quantum phase transition .",
    "it is also accompanied by a scaling behaviour since the correlation length diverges and there is no characteristic length in the system at the critical point . as we have stated in the rg approach for itf model , a large system , i.e. @xmath43 ,",
    "can be effectively describe by two sites with the renormalized coupling of in the n - th rg step .",
    "thus , the concurrence between the two renormalized sites represents the entanglement between two parts of the system each containing @xmath44 sites effectively . in this respect",
    "we can speak of _ block entanglement _",
    "-the entanglement between a block and the rest of system- in a large system provided the size of the block and the rest of system is equal .    for any @xmath4",
    ", there is a time @xmath45 at which the @xmath39 reaches its @xmath46th maximum ( fig.([fig2 ] ) ) and is analyzed as a function of coupling @xmath4 at different rg steps which manifest the size of system .",
    "the first derivative of @xmath47 with respect to the coupling constant ( @xmath48 ) shows a singular behavior at the critical point .",
    "respect to magnetic field ( @xmath4 ) under rg .",
    "the inset shows the @xmath49 at different rg steps.,width=321 ]    we have plotted @xmath48 for @xmath50 ( first maximum of the @xmath39 ) versus @xmath4 in fig.[fig3 ] for different rg steps which shows the singular behaviour as the size of system becomes large .",
    "surveying the detail shows that the position of the minimum ( @xmath51 ) of @xmath48 tends towards the critical point like @xmath52 in which @xmath53 ( inset of figure [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "moreover , we have derived the scaling behavior of @xmath54 versus n. this has been plotted in fig.([fig4 ] ) , which shows a linear behavior of @xmath54 versus @xmath55 . the scaling behavior is @xmath56 with exponent @xmath53 .     for various size of system .",
    "the inset shows the scaling of the position ( @xmath57 ) of @xmath58 for different length chains.,width=340 ]    it is easy to show that the exponent @xmath59 is directly related to the correlation length exponent ( @xmath60 ) close to the critical point .",
    "the correlation length exponent , gives the behavior of correlation length in the vicinity of @xmath61 , i.e. , @xmath62 . under the rg transformation , eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) , the correlation length scales in the @xmath63th rg step as @xmath64 , which immediately leads to an expression for @xmath65 in terms of @xmath60 and @xmath66 ( number of sites in each block ) . dividing the last equation to @xmath67",
    "gives @xmath68 , which implies @xmath69 , since latexmath:[$\\frac{dt_{max}^{k}}{dg}|_{g_{m}}\\sim    noted that the scaling of the position of minimum , @xmath57 ( inset of figure [ fig3 ] ) , also comes from the behavior of the correlation length near the critical point .",
    "as the critical point is approached and in the limit of large system size , the correlation length almost covers the size of the system , i.e. , @xmath71 , and a simple comparison with @xmath62 results in the following scaling form @xmath72 .    to obtain the finite - size scaling behavior of @xmath73",
    ", we look for a scaling function in such away that all graphs tend to collapse on each other under rg evolution which results in a large system .",
    "this is also a manifestation of the existences of the finite size scaling for the case of block entanglement .",
    "we have plotted @xmath74 versus @xmath75 for @xmath50 in fig.[fig5 ] .",
    "the upper curves which are for large system sizes clearly show that all plots fall on each other .",
    "the similar scaling behaviours and their relation to correlation length exponent have been reported in our previous work @xcite in which we have studied the static properties of the ground state entanglement of itf model by rg method .",
    "we would like to mention that in ref.@xcite the authors investigate the dynamics of concurrence of two nearest - neighbor sites at itf model using the exact solution .",
    "they shows that @xmath58 dose not diverge at the critical point but has a minimum at @xmath76 . the divergence of @xmath58 at the @xmath61 in our work and the similarity of the dynamic scaling behaviors to the static scaling behaviors originates from the low energy state properties .",
    "in this article , we have implement the idea of renormalization group ( rg ) to study the low energy states dynamic of entanglement for spin chains . in this respect",
    "we show that the rg procedure could be implemented to obtain low energy states dynamic of systems in terms of effective hamiltonian which is described by renormalized coupling constants .",
    "this manifest the fact that some dynamical quantities of the system could show the fingerprint of quantum phase transition for an infinite size system .",
    "these notions have been observed and approved in our study of the itf model .",
    "moreover , the rg approach shows that as the size of the system becomes large , the derivative of the time at which the entanglement reaches its maximums with respect to the transverse field , diverges at the critical point and its scaling behaviors versus the size of the system are as same as the static ground state entanglement of the system .",
    "the author would like to thank a. langari , r. fazio , a. g. moghaddam , y. sobouti , and v. karimipour for fruitful discussions and comments ."
