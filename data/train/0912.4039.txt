    "scalar - field models in cosmology and classical gravity have been quite successful in describing variety of important issues in modern cosmology ( viz the problem of dark energy , dark matter , inflation , late time acceleration of the universe , cosmic evolution etc . ; see e.g. @xcite .",
    "in particular , the use of a higgs scalar field @xcite in a jordan  brans  dicke ( jbd ) model of gravity @xcite is of quite significant importance .",
    "it was first acquainted during the early nineties of the last century @xcite by using the idea of the broken - symmetric theory of gravity @xcite along with a jbd model of gravity @xcite . since then",
    ", it has seen various subsequent developments during the last few years @xcite .",
    "such a model is important especially because , as a result of spontaneous breakdown of symmetry , a higgs potential as used in the model naturally leads to a cosmological function of anti - gravitational behaviour as well as because of the role of the higgs field in the mass generation mechanism of the constituents , i.e. the basic building blocks ( quarks , leptons and gauge bosons ) of nature @xcite .",
    "+ many efforts to find exact solutions of the field equations entailing scalar fields ( with and without mass ) in gravity have been made time and again @xcite .",
    "within gr , they lead to singularities and black holes related to schwarzschild singularities which hide point ",
    "singularities from outside .",
    "in particular , whether naked singularities exist or not is still an open question , both within scalar  tensor theories and within gr . actually , the _ cosmic censorship conjecture _ ( ccc )",
    "@xcite prohibits such singularities , which are widely regarded as nonexistent .",
    "however , their appearance is theoretically predicted in several models of gravity @xcite .",
    "different classes of bh and wormhole solutions as well as the nonsingular spherically symmetric solution in such models have been constructed and analysed in different contexts @xcite . in case",
    "the ccc is violated , then the naked singularities might contribute to some new gravitational phenomena including their relationship to gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) @xcite .",
    "+ the appearance of singular and nonsingular black hole ( bh ) solutions in scalar ",
    "tensor theory models @xcite , and their relation with the facets of the scalar field are of crucial interest @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we have noticed the breakdown of ccc ( i.e. the appearance of naked singularities ) in certain circumstances in our investigations of this induced gravity model with higgs potential @xcite .",
    "recently , we have studied the appearance of bhs as well as their consequences in a scalar  tensor theory with higgs potential along with the amplitude ( integration constant ) of the vacuum scalar - field excitation in relation to the appearance of quintessential effects towards reissner ",
    "nordstrm - like bh solutions @xcite and flattening of the galaxy rotation curves @xcite .",
    "further , the above mentioned integration constant indicates a relation to effective mass as measured mass which differs from bare ( luminous ) mass derived only from the usual densities @xcite .",
    "this integration constant of the scalar - field excitation is in fact related to the energy ",
    "stress tensor and hence to the densities and pressures .",
    "it therefore plays a crucial role in the dynamics of the present model of induced gravity . on the one hand ,",
    "the energy density and pressure appear within linear solutions such that the finite pressure terms contributing from the scalar field account to the dynamical mass .",
    "these terms are regarded to assure the equivalence with newtonian and standard results of gr having consistency within a parameterised - post - newtonian ( ppn ) framework @xcite .",
    "+ a dynamical mass parameter appears for linearised gravity , whereas an effective mass appears for higher - order solutions .",
    "their interrelation as pressure containing terms is of special relevance as pressure screens bare mass from density with dynamical pressure terms which are related to the scalar field . on the other hand , for galactic dynamics , a dark matter profile has been derived for flat rotation curves @xcite . within this framework",
    ", density may be decomposed in a usual , mainly baryonic component and a further scalar - field density term which is directly related to a pressure term @xcite .",
    "it is of crucial interest to constrain such terms as well as to clarify their nature and relevance for galactic dynamics as well as for solar - relativistic effects , i.e. for solar ranges and higher - order solutions . in both cases , scalar - field pressures ,",
    "i.e. pressure terms of the perfect fluid which are related to the appearance of the scalar - field excitation , are of special interest .",
    "+ in the present paper , we address the above mentioned issues and point out a universal character of scalar - field pressure to understand the dark - matter problem .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : we first recall the field equations and the integration constant of scalar - field excitations corresponding to the model used for our investigations in section i. the field equations are then identified with maxwell - like equations of gravity with an energy density in section ii .",
    "utilising these equations , the physical consequences of the scalar - field pressure are presented for linear solutions and perihelion advance in the first and second parts of section iii respectively .",
    "further , in the last part of section iii , we present the dark - matter profile as well as the constraints on pressure terms coming from dark - matter phenomenology within this model .",
    "the non - newtonian properties of the density are also discussed for different length scales .",

    "since left - handed states underlie different gauge groups , they differ for left- and right - handed fermionic fields ( but also depend on the type of fermion ) . however , there are no derivatives in the yukawa term and , thus , both - handed states acquire equal mass .",

    "we will use this relation for a system which is not vacuum , however beyond the galactic bulge , as usual within the analysis of rotation curves in relation with universal density profiles @xcite .",
    "+ now , the poisson equation in the weak field limit is obtained as follows , @xmath189 the scalar field equation yields @xmath190 phenomenologically , especially rotation velocity of the spiral galaxies is nearly constant ( well known as the problem of flat rotation curves ) outside the luminous core as if a spherical halo of non - luminous matter with an extension much greater than the galaxy s visible disc surrounded them @xcite this is usually analysed in the context of universal halo profiles , whereas a halo of non - hadronic , dark matter is assumed @xcite . in the same spirit , we hence assume now that the rotation velocity is constant and analyse the necessary conditions following such case .",
    "dark - matter in the sense of non - newtonian dynamics shall appear as a consequence of the scalar field , related to the dark - matter profile @xcite .",
    "+ the form of the gravitational potential which is necessary to give the flat rotation curves is of the following form , @xmath191 the poisson equation ( [ poissonmod ] ) together with the scalar field equation ( [ scalarmod ] ) leads to @xmath192 the equation ( [ pes ] ) defines a density profile having the following form , @xmath193 it possesses , on the one hand , a contribution @xmath194 of matter density in general , and a contribution @xmath94 of pressure ( coming from the inner structure of matter ) . on the other hand , it has a newtonian - type energy density and a scalar - field contribution to density distribution as clearly evident from the equation ( [ dmp ] ) .",
    "hence , we define two energy - density components as follows , @xmath195 both the definitions @xmath196 and @xmath197 together give the density profile usually called dark matter profile @xmath198 @xcite .",
    "in these terms , the scalar - field contribution ( @xmath197 ) is expected to act as dark - matter density contribution to the total energy density . the remaining contribution ( @xmath196 )",
    "is purely newtonian and represents the energy density especially of baryons .",

    "+ phenomenologically , there is a relation of about ten to one between hadronic matter ( @xmath196 ) and dark matter . according to the equations ( [ es ] ) and ( [ ex ] ) , dark matter",
    "may then be given by the scalar - field contribution of density .",
    "hence , a relation of the following form is expected , @xmath202 the total energy density @xmath203 for the dark - matter density profile is in fact given according to equation ( [ dmp ] ) , and it is interesting that following equation ( [ px ] ) , the relation between total energy density @xmath203 and pressure gives an eos parameter as follows , @xmath204 for large , galactic scales , hence , @xmath205 is given by the dark - matter contribution which comes from the scalar field .",
    "furthermore , for vanishing contributions of the scalar field , @xmath206 tends to zero , and for @xmath207 , i.e. for a complete dominance of the scalar - field excitation , the total eos parameter reads exactly 1/5 . astonishingly , this value which is necessary within dark - matter phenomenology of flat rotation curves is equivalent to the eos parameter @xmath106 within the context of solar - relativistic effects .",
    "it appears for matter density given by usual matter @xmath196 with newtonian dynamics and for such matter as only source of the scalar field . apparently , an eos parameter of @xmath140 is a weak - field constraint not only for solar - relativistic effects and energy density of gravitation but also within dark matter phenomenology derived from the present induced gravity model with a higgs potential .",

    "in this article , we have investigated the relation between the scalar - field excitations of induced gravity with a higgs potential and the obligatory presence of finite pressure terms in energy density of gravitation , along with their appearance in linear solutions for solar - relativistic effects such as perihelion advance , and for flat rotation curves leading to dark matter phenomenology with scalar - field density components of the dark - matter profile .",
    "the important conclusions drawn from this study are summarised below :    * an energy density of gravitation following maxwell - like equations may differ with its analogue of gr . gravitational energy within induced gravity and gr",
    "are identical for @xmath47 which denotes the coupling of the scalar field to the matter lagrangian as well as a decoupled higgs field , and for @xmath48 ( i.e the absence of the coupling of the scalar field with the matter lagrangian ) they are the same only with the constraint on the eos parameter as @xmath140 . * finite values of pressure of the ideal fluid within vacuum solutions are expected from the nature of scalar - field excitations .",
    "this further leads to the notion of the dynamic and bare ( luminous ) masses in this model .",
    "the value of the dynamical mass is observed greater than that of the luminous mass , and the present formulation is thus useful to describe the signatures of unseen matter in nature .",
    "* perihelion shift is found the same as within gr for low - energetic systems with values of pressure as constrained by energy in view of the eos parameter as @xmath135 as in ( i ) .",
    "there is , further , more complicated dynamics for highly energetic systems with high coefficients of @xmath179 per @xmath232 and @xmath233 .",
    "scalar fields are essential for low - range dynamics although they have newtonian behaviour at such range .",
    "* flat rotation curves of galaxies lead to dark - matter profiles with baryonic and scalar - field components of density .",
    "scalar - field densities are strongly related to pressure terms in this model and they seem to provide a viable explanation of the dark matter contents of our universe . * dark matter dominance leads to pressures related to an eos parameter of total energy of the same value as for weak fields in solar - relativistic ranges . *",
    "the non - newtonian behaviour of density appears as distances grow , according to ( iii ) .",
    "such non - newtonian behaviour of scalar - field excitations leads to flat rotation curves .",
    "the contribution due to the scalar field in the energy density in fact acts as the dark - matter profile in view of the total energy density of the system .",
    "however , the estimation of the shift of intermediate behaviour of scalar fields , i.e. the relation between scalar fields and galactic centres , is still unclear , and it would be a quite interesting problem to investigate .",
    "further , this might also be valuable in relation to quintessential properties of scalar fields for galaxies within exact solutions , leading to reissner ",
    "nordstrm behaviour .",
    "moreover , the cosmological implications of induced gravity with higgs potentials in terms of the quintessence and dark matter along with the primeval dynamics would be another important task to study in greater detail .",
