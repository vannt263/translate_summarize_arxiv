    "given a proliferating population of cells starting from one or more progenitors , a natural quantity of interest in cell biology is the average number of divisions per cell since the initial progenitors , i.e. the average generation of presently living cells . the average generation is related to the population s turn - over rate and can potentially be used to quantify dynamics and aging of the immune system @xcite , to better understand the evolution and risk of cancer @xcite , and to rank cell types in hierarchies of complex differentiation programs @xcite .",
    "estimating average generation is a simple matter if cell lifetimes are all equal and the division time is known or , alternatively , if total cell counts can be measured and there is no cell death . if , however , lifetimes are heterogeneous , the population is subject to death as well as division or total cell counts are not available , the issue is more involved . in these settings ,",
    "several experimental techniques can be employed to estimate average generation , including time lapse microscopy , division diluting fluorescent dyes , and inference from somatic mutations and telomere length .",
    "the most unambiguous measurement technique is _ in vitro _",
    "time lapse microscopy as it affords nearly direct determination of lineage trees and cell generation .",
    "time lapse microscopy has been used to study many cell systems including bacteria , lymphocytes , embryonic development , gut development , to name but a few , e.g. @xcite .",
    "even it , however , has limitations as filming is not continuous , cells can leave the field of vision or form three dimensional structures that inhibit tracking .",
    "the complexity of image segmentation increases with cell numbers , and so time lapse microscopy has proved challenging if more than approximately @xmath0 generations are to be followed .",
    "another popular experimental approach , particularly in immunology , is to stain starting cells with a fluorescent dye such as carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester @xcite , celltrace@xmath1 violet or cell proliferation dye efluor 670 @xcite . with each division , cells inherit approximately half of their parent s dye and so fluoresce with half their intensity .",
    "a cell s generation can thus be determined by its luminous intensity via flow cytometry .",
    "this approach is used both _ in vitro _ and _ in vivo _ , and allows the experimenter to start with a large number of progenitors without difficulty .",
    "it enables 6 - 10 generations to be followed before dye dilution is such that the signal - to - noise ratio is too high for a cell s generation to be reliably determined .    determining generation _ in vivo _ remains challenging as often it can not be achieved by direct observation or cell stain methods .",
    "estimating replicative history , cell depth and lineage trees has been proposed by measurement of average telomere length @xcite or by the number of somatic mutations , which are introduced during dna duplication @xcite . while methods in this direction rely on inference rather than direct observation , they offer the possibility of tracing more than 10 generations in a wide range of species , including humans .",
    "in the present paper , we provide a novel average generation estimator that is designed with the _ in vivo _ setting in mind .",
    "the estimator is suitable for systems where cells undergo an unlikely , heritable division - linked label change with a determinable probability , where the label serves only as a marker and does not impact on cell dynamics .",
    "chief amongst the estimator s desirable properties are that : ( 1 ) it requires no information on cell lifetime distributions ; ( 2 ) the population can be subject to death as well as division ; and ( 3 ) only a proportion of label - positive to total cells needs to be measured .",
    "the present article introduces the estimator , analytically establishes its fundamental properties , validates its applicability by comparison with simulation and comparison with published data , proposes an experimental realization , and demonstrates its utility .    in section [ sec : estover ] we describe the estimator and explain how it can be used .",
    "the estimator appropriateness is a consequence of theorems that are presented in detail in section [ sec : math ] , with a heuristic explanation and overview of them appearing first in section [ sec : mathsum ] .    in section [ sec : val_sim ] ,",
    "validation using simulated data , we use monte carlo simulations to assess the estimator s performance for physiological parameterizations . in section [ sec : val_data ] , validation using published data , we use several sources of publicly available data to illustrate the estimator s applicability .",
    "we avail of complete lineage tree data for the development of _ c. elegans _ , as determined from time - lapse microscopy @xcite , stochastically labeling it . applying the estimator results in accurate inference of the average generation in comparison to the directly observed quantity .",
    "we also take data from two distinct experimental studies , one on human colorectal cancer cells @xcite and one on murine embryonic fibroblasts @xcite , that employ micro - satellite mutation fluorescent reporter systems .",
    "micro - satellite mutation is an unlikely division linked change and the fluorescence of cells in these systems serves as a label suitable for average generation estimation .",
    "the results show consistency between average generation estimates , measured quantities and values reported in the literature .    as an illustrative example , in section [ sec : expdes ] ,",
    "experiment design , we propose a genetic construct , based on existing pieces , to facilitate average generation inference .",
    "we describe how the probability of label - loss could be measured and how the method could be validated . in section [ sec :",
    "disc ] , discussion , we conclude with experimental designs where the method would prove biologically informative .",
    "we consider a system where cells are subject to a division - linked , heritable label change that serves as a measurable distinguishing marker , but does not influence population dynamics .",
    "the method is appropriate regardless of whether initial cells are label - negative and can gain the label , which is then inherited by their offspring , or are label - positive and can lose the label , with their offspring not regaining the label . for a consistent description ,",
    "we phrase the paper in terms of the latter , but the results all hold _ mutatis mutandis_.    during each cell s lifetime , assume that a label - positive cell becomes label - negative with a known , small likelihood , @xmath2 .",
    "let @xmath3 be the total live cell count at time @xmath4 and @xmath5 be the live cell count of label - positive cells .",
    "assume that the initial cells at @xmath6 are all label - positive and that at some time @xmath4 the fraction of label positive cells to total cells , @xmath7 , can be measured . with @xmath8 denoting the sum of the generations of all cells living at time @xmath4 and with @xmath9 defined to be @xmath10 , then given there are label - positive cells in the system at @xmath4 , i.e. @xmath11 , we establish that the average generation of cells alive at time @xmath4 satisfies the following relationship @xmath12 that is , the average generation of the population can be estimated directly from the proportion of label - positive cells if the delabeling probability is known .",
    "perhaps unexpectedly the formula does not depend on several difficult - to - measure factors such as cell - lifetime distributions and total cell counts .",
    "moreover the right hand side of requires only a proportional measurement of label - positive cells , which can be determined from a sample , and the relationship holds even though the population could be subject to death as well as division .    for the validity of",
    ", we have assumed that at @xmath6 all cells are label - positive . as a result @xmath13 and",
    "so both the right and left hand side of are @xmath10 at @xmath6 , agreeing irrespective of the initial starting number . if , however , not all cells are initially label - positive , the estimator and the average generation would not agree .",
    "this can be rectified if measurements of the proportion of positively labeled cells are available at two time - points , @xmath14 .",
    "then , irrespective of the initial composition of label - positive and label - negative cells , so long as @xmath15 , @xmath16    this two - measurement estimator has an additional advantage when initial cell numbers are small .",
    "if the culture is started , as an extreme example , with a single progenitor , then the right hand side of can be subject to stochastic fluctuations at shorter time - scales ( see the monte carlo simulations in section [ sec : val_sim ] ) . as established rigorously in section [ sec : math ] , with @xmath17 , the two - sample estimator in is more accurate than as it removes the influence of the timing of early cell events on the estimate .",
    "the estimators and have non - obvious forms . utilising expansion properties of cumulant generating functions , results in the following section show that the relationships hold , in expectation , for an arbitrary familial relationship .",
    "this includes , in particular , estimation of average generation for heterogeneous cell populations with distinct , potentially interdependent , proliferation characteristics .    in the absence of a generative model of family trees , however , that derivation can not provide information about the development in time of the average generation of a family of cells .",
    "nor can it be used to determine time - dependent properties of the estimators on a developing population . for a more detailed analysis of sample - path , multi - progenitor and time - dependent properties ,",
    "a general mathematical framework for capturing the stochastic dynamics of a proliferating cell system subject to division and death , as well as heterogeneous cell life times , is that of age dependent branching processes @xcite where cells have random lifetimes as well as random numbers of offspring . since the seminal work of bellman and harris @xcite",
    ", it has been known that if cells are more likely to divide then die , given the cell population does not die out , the number of cells living at time @xmath4 grows exponentially in time , @xmath18 , at a rate , @xmath19 , dubbed the malthus parameter , that depends on the lifetime and offspring number distributions of cells .",
    "this result is known to be robust , for example , to sibling dependencies @xcite .    in a cell system experiencing heritable one - way label - changes",
    ", label - positive cells can become label negative - cells , but the reverse is not possible .",
    "thus the number of label - positive cells at time @xmath4 also satisfies the branching process result , @xmath20 , but with a malthus parameter that is smaller than that for the total label - independent population of cells , @xmath21 .",
    "the difference @xmath22 depends on the likelihood , @xmath2 , that a label - positive cell loses its label .",
    "fewer results have been established regarding the total generation of a cell population , the sum of the generations of all cells living at time @xmath4 , @xmath8 , for which new theorems can be found in section [ sec : math ] . for the label - independent population , in substantial generality",
    "we prove that @xmath23 .",
    "that is , the total generation increases faster than the total population size by a factor of @xmath4 . recalling that @xmath24 , for a general age - dependent branching process , the average generation of the population grows linearly in time @xmath25 for some @xmath26 . in the following section we give a deterministic result to provide non - probabilistic intuition for why this is so before considering the stochastic system .",
    "the clinching result quantitatively relates the phenomena of stochastic delabeling to generational expansion .",
    "so long as label - positive cells remain @xmath27 so that for @xmath2 small @xmath28 this identification holds for any age dependent branching process and does not depend upon the details of life - time distributions or the possibility of cell death , so long as populations do not go extinct .    the estimators are related through stochastic quantities and are subject to sample - path fluctuations , particularly at early time - points . establishing that estimates , as a function of time on individual sample paths , converge to the true average generation underlies the development of the two time - point estimator in equation .",
    "that methodology circumvents this issue of small number variability by eliminating the early fluctuations on a path - by - path basis . as a supporting result",
    ", we also prove that the path - to - path variability of estimates decreases inversely proportionally to the number of progenitors , supporting the precision of estimates for experimental systems that are initiated with multiple cells , which is typically the case .",
    "we begin by deriving a version of based on averages over realisations of the delabeling process .",
    "this derivation has the advantage that it requires no assumptions regarding the family tree and so holds in complete generality , but it is not informative with regards individual realisations .",
    "sample - path , time - dependent properties of the estimators arise as a consequence of involved theorems in the context of the most well established generative model of family trees , age dependent branching processes , which follow this derivation .",
    "at some time @xmath4 , consider a collection of @xmath3 cells , whose familial relationship need not be known .",
    "the generation of a cell is defined to be the number of ancestors it possesses , with initial cells being defined to be in generation @xmath10 .",

    "of the generations of all living cells being denoted by @xmath30 knowing @xmath2 we wish to estimate the average generation of presently living cells , i.e. @xmath31 , by observation of the proportion @xmath7 .",
    "if initial cells are label positive and with each division the label is lost independently with probability @xmath2 , the probability cell @xmath32 is still label positive in generation @xmath33 is @xmath34 . with @xmath5 denoting the number of label positive cells , by linearity of expectation the average proportion of label - positive cells in the population is @xmath35 identifying @xmath36 , this can be re - written in a form that identifies it with a moment generating function , e.g. @xcite , @xmath37 where @xmath38 is uniformly selected in @xmath39 . as both the moment generating function and the cumulant generating function , @xmath40 , are real analytic , we can take a taylor expansion of the latter around the origin , giving @xmath41 so that @xmath42 taking @xmath43 is equivalent to taking @xmath44 . thus noting that @xmath45 , we obtain @xmath46 which is formula , albeit with an expectation over stochastic delabelings . while this result is not as strong as others we shall prove , it illustrates both how the unusual formulation arises and that , averaged over delabeling processes , the relationship holds for arbitrary family tree structure .      to determine sample path properties of the generation counting estimator",
    ", we must establish two quantitative relationships in a general age - dependent branching process : ( 1 ) relating the growth rates of labeled and unlabeled populations when the probability of delabeling per cell division is small ; and ( 2 ) for the relationship between the number of cells alive and the sum of the generations of all living cells .",
    "for the quantitative relationship between the growth - rates of the labeled and unlabeled populations when the delabeling probability per cell division is small and label - state does not impact on population dynamics , we leverage well - know single type results @xcite . for the relationship between the number of cells alive and the sum of the generations of all living cells ,",
    "there are some results indirectly available from @xcite , but to identify more properties of our estimator we find it beneficial to provide an analysis of the joint probability generating function of number of cells alive and their total generation number .",
    "our initial mathematical study treats systems that start with a single initiating progenitor . from these results , systems that start with several statistically equivalent progenitors with indistinguishable progeny",
    "can be deduced .",
    "in addition , we provide results on the behavior of the estimator for a system with numerous progenitors , establishing that that variances behave inversely proportionally to the number of progenitors .",

    "the dependence of the malthus parameter , @xmath57 , on the expected number of offspring of a cell , @xmath59 , is not usually made explicit , but will prove essential for us as we shall be interested in relating the growth rate of the label - positive population and of the total population , which will differ .",

    "in contrast , the per - realization estimates , the blue lines , which the sample path theory establishes will ultimately grow with the same slope as the average orange line , exhibit substantial variability at short time - scales .",
    "two dynamical properties contribute to these fluctuations . at the beginning , there are no label - negative cells and so the logarithm of the ratio is @xmath10 .",
    "when the first label - negative cells appear , the ratio of label - positive to total cell population can dramatically change , especially if the population size is small . in effect , the theorem is not in force until both the label positive and label negative populations are large enough for average behavior to become dominant , which only happens after at least an order of @xmath250 division events have occured .",

    "this can be understood as there is no estimate prior to at least one cell delabeling , which requires , on average , @xmath250 divisions to occur .",
    "as @xmath2 is assumed small , typically one does not intially get an estimate and this delay explains the observed lag in the blue lines . on the other hand , in the unlikely event that an early cell delabels , then the approximation initially gives signifcant over - estimates .",
    "this bias , which we have observed consistently across other simulations , suggests that if starting with a single progenitor family , only becomes accurate at longer time - frames , i.e. after several generations have passed .",
    "note that the mean value of the estimator at early times over multiple runs is effected by outliers , hence the mean lies outside the inter - quartile range .",
    "results in section [ sec : math ] for the time - dependent sample paths of estimates suggest that one way to mitigate this initial variability in the single time - point estimate @xmath249 is to make two measurements at distinct times , @xmath253 and use their difference to estimate @xmath31 via the approximation in section [ sec : intro ] : @xmath254 the effect of this difference measurement is the removal of the initial fluctuations on a path - by - path basis .",
    "this is illustrated in , panels ( e ) and ( f ) .",

    "the two - point estimate is not only more symmetrically distributed around the true value , but its variability is significantly less than the single time - point estimates .",
    "while the method works well for single progenitors , experiments are typically seeded with multiple progenitors .",
    "theorem [ thm : largen ] establishes that the variability decreases inverse linearly with the number of progenitors , @xmath260 , and so one expects that starting with even a small number of cells will eradicate the early time variability and here we demonstrate that this is , indeed , the case . for @xmath261 , panels ( a ) and ( b ) correspond with those of .",
    "the orange lines , showing the per - realization of the average generation , remain largely unchanged , but the accuracy of the single time point estimates ( blue ) are greatly improved .",
    "this comes about as even if an individual progenitor s family generates label - negative cells relatively late this is balanced by another progenitor s family where delabeling happened relatively early .",
    "thus both @xmath5 and @xmath3 rapidly become sufficiently substantial for the limit theorem to be in force and for the estimator to be precise .",
    "panels ( c ) and ( d ) show monte carlo created box plots of the per - sample average generation , the single time - point estimate and the two time - point estimate for a range of initial progenitor numbers .",
    "sample - to - sample variation is greatly reduced even with as few as @xmath0 progenitors .",
    "thus in standard experimental systems , which are often seeded with hundreds or thousands of cells , the estimator is expected to be precise .",
    "the simulations of the previous section show that the estimator works well for parameterizations akin to those found in experimental systems and provide insight into the impact of a number of factors , such as the delabeling probability and the number of progenitors , on the quality of the estimates .",

    "the first application takes lineage trees of the early development of _ c. elegans _ determined by time - lapse microscopy and reported on in @xcite .",
    "as the entire family tree is known , we have direct access to measurements of average generation as a function of time . simulating a stochastic delabeling process on this tree , as would be experimentally possible via a division linked mosaic",

    "a reference lineage tree was constructed based on output from automated tracking of nuclei in @xmath262 embryos , recorded over approximately six hours at 1.5 minute intervals by three - dimensional resonance - scanning confocal microscopy .",
    "each node in the figure represents a cell division and the tree contains information about all parent - daughter relationships and gives the timing of more than @xmath263 division events during an embryo s development .",

    "regarding independence , there are correlations throughout the tree .",
    "( e ) demonstrates , for example , that lifetimes of siblings are positively correlated .",
    "these features are not in line with the assumptions under which some of the the sample path properties of the estimator were established , but are consistent with the derivation via properties of the cumulant generating function in section [ sec : math ] .",
    "to test the accuracy of the estimator , we stochastically decorated the tree . beginning with a single label - positive progenitor , daughters are delabeled with probability @xmath2 .",

    "thus bfp+ cells are regarded as label positive and bfp- cells are label negative .",
    "this design is similar in spirit to an existing one used to create mosaics in zebrafish @xcite , which employs micro - satellites as a division linked probabilistic driver and a kaloop in lieu of site - specific recombination .",
    "the proportion of label - positive cells in a cell system incorporating this construct can be readily determined via fluorescence - activated cell sorting ( facs ) .",
    "the essential remaining ingredient for average generation inference is the determination of the probability of label - loss .",
    "this can be achieved by a _ in vitro _",
    "facs experiment , as illustrated by the _ in silico _ simulated experiment in ( b)-(c ) .",
    "a collection of cells that incorporate the construct are stained with a division diluting dye , such as cfse @xcite , with noise added for illustrative purposes .",
    "after division , cells are gated based on their generation , and the proportion of label - positive cells per - generation determined by their fluorescence . with @xmath272 being the measured proportion of label - positive cells in generation @xmath94 , in the presence of a large number of initial progenitors the probability label - loss , @xmath2 ,",
    "irrespective of whether deaths occur , is @xmath273 , which should be the same for every @xmath94 . in particular , if all initial cells are bfp+ , then @xmath274 and @xmath275 , the proportion of bfp negative cells in generation @xmath55 .",

    "for this simulation , an estimated value of @xmath2 is determined using this measurement for @xmath276 , @xmath277 .",
    "the accuracy of the method can then be checked during or after the experiment by comparing the average generation as determined by the division diluting dye with the value estimated via equation with the measured @xmath2 , ( d ) .",
    "once @xmath2 is known , similar cell stain experiments with distinct cell lines or distinct stimulii can be performed to validate the method s inference before its use _ in vivo _ and for generation counts beyond the range possible with division diluting dyes or fluorescence microscopy .    the construct described in this section",
    "is intended as an exemplar , creatable with present technology .",
    "further experimental possibilities , including those based on naturally occurring mutations , can be found in the following discussion .",
    "the estimators introduced in this article , and , offer means to estimate a biologically significant quantity , the average generation of cell populations , for cell systems where direct measurement poses a significant challenge .",
    "their appropriateness is not intuitively apparent and their development requires several mathematical results . throughout the development of those results",
    "we assume that the label change is one - way , which can be shown not to be essential for the cumulant generating function derivation of the estimators , but is relied on in establishing the sample - path results as if the label change is reversible , so that labels can be gained as well as lost , then asymptotically it is known that the growth rate of the number of label - positive cells equals the growth rate of the total number of cells @xcite .    despite its less than obvious genesis",
    ", the estimator has highly desirable features : it allows the population to be subject to death and division ; it does not need to know the number of progenitors ; it does not require knowledge of cell - cycle distributions ; and , subject to knowing the per - division label - change probability , only requires the measurement of proportions .",
    "comparison of estimates for simulations suggest that the estimator is accurate for physiological reasonable parameterizations .    the estimators and depend on the proportion of label - positive cells in the population , where the label can be any of the cell s properties that is lost with a small probability during its division cycle .",
    "several naturally occurring and engineered cellular processes exist that approximately match this requirement .",
    "somatic mutation is probably the best studied natural process of this kind . in this case",
    "germ - line cells are defined to be label - positive , while label - negative cells correspond to those with mutations in their dna .",
    "the proportion of label - positive cells can be assessed by next generation sequencing . in humans",
    "there is a high rate of fidelity in dna replication , giving an error rate of @xmath278 per base per division @xcite and so using only a single nucleotide location as a label appears impractical .",
    "considering instead the full germ - line genome as a positive label , even though each nucleotide may suffer mutations with distinct rates , and potentially in concert , there is still an over - all probability of label - change that has been estimated in human sperm cells as approximately @xmath279 @xcite . in principle",
    ", this rate could be used as the probability of delabeling for our estimator .",
    "alternatively , hotspots of mutation could also be analyzed .",
    "for example , micro - satellites , short repetitive sequences of dna , mutate in humans with @xmath2 in the range @xmath239 , which we have used for the parameterization to evaluate the performance of our estimator .",
    "the use of hotspots of mutation as a label suffers from the difficulty that delabeled cells could relabel due to the occurrence of further mutations .",
    "the impact of this can be ameliorated by creating an asymmetry in the likelihood of relabeling to delabeling .",
    "one selects a set of @xmath48 sites for measurement , each having their own probability of mutation , @xmath280 .",
    "one defines the label - positive cells as those that have germ - line values at all sites .",
    "the likelihood of a labeled cell delabeling is the likelihood that any of the sites mutate away from germ - line , @xmath281 , if the individual @xmath280 are small .",
    "the likelihood that a cell with a single mutation relabels is @xmath282 , creating a significant asymmetry .",
    "moreover , for a cell that has had several mutations , the likelihood that all revert , which is necessary for relabeling , is smaller still .    while it seems likely that one must rely on naturally occurring processes to estimate the average generation of a cell population for humans , genetically modified cell lines and animals have the advantage that measuring the proportion of label - positive cells can be directly facilitated by fluorescent markers .",
    "the construct described in the experiment design section could be built or existing constructions , such as cre - mediated sister chromatid recombination @xcite and micro - satellite mutation induced label activation @xcite , can be adapted , so that reversion does not occur . using fluorescence - activated cell sorting or live imaging technologies and the estimators developed in this article it could be possible to follow the average generation of specific cell populations , like neoplastic tissue or the skin , in living organisms over long periods of time .",
    "recent evidence from _ in vivo _ cell lineage tracing techniques such as cellular barcoding @xcite has demonstrated that apparently homogeneous progenitors give rise to heterogeneous families in cancer , immunology and hematopoesis , e.g. @xcite .",
    "theoretical work developing methodologies to interrogate data from these experiments is ongoing , but one key difficulty that must be overcome is that the generation of individual families is unknown @xcite .",
    "combining any of the above experimental methodologies and using the estimator developed in the present article would allow inference of the per progenitor average generation , enhancing the deductive power of these techniques , which have already proved invaluable .",

    "<S> for proliferating cells subject to both division and death , how can one estimate the average generation number of the living population without continuous observation or a division - diluting dye ? in this paper we provide a method for cell systems such that at each division there is an unlikely , heritable one - way label change that has no impact other than to serve as a distinguishing marker . if the probability of label change per cell generation can be determined and the proportion of labeled cells at a given time point can be measured , we establish that the average generation number of living cells can be estimated . crucially , the estimator does not depend on knowledge of the statistics of cell cycle , death rates or total cell numbers . </S>",
    "<S> we validate the estimator and illustrate its features through comparison with published data and physiologically parameterized stochastic simulations , using it to suggest new experimental designs . </S>"
