    "the introduction of ` toy ' mappings which demonstrate essential features of nonlinear dynamics has led to many insights in the field of classical chaos .",
    "a well - known example is the so - called _",
    "baker s transformation _",
    "interest in this mapping stems from its straightforward characterization in terms of a bernoulli shift on binary sequences .",
    "it seems natural to consider a quantum counterpart to the baker s map for the investigation of quantum chaos .",
    "unfortunately , there is no unique quantization procedure , and hence , we must embrace the possibility of different quantum maps limiting to the same classical baker s transformation .",
    "balazs and voros @xcite were first to conceive a quantum version of the baker s map .",
    "this was done with the help of the discrete quantum fourier transform .",
    "subsequently , improvements to the balazs - voros quantization were made by saraceno @xcite , an optical analogy was found @xcite , a canonical quantization was devised @xcite , and quantum computing realizations have been proposed @xcite .",
    "a quantum baker s mapping on the sphere has also been defined @xcite .",
    "more recently , an entire class of quantum baker s maps was proposed by schack and caves using qubits @xcite .",
    "the balazs - voros quantization is but one member of this class .",
    "the classical limit of the schack - caves quantizations is the subject of this article .",
    "we explicitly derive a semi - classical approximation for the propagator in the coherent state basis .",
    "this enables us to give conditions upon which the schack - caves quantizations will behave as the classical baker s transformation in the limit @xmath0 .",
    "we find that , provided the number of momentum qubits approaches infinity , the semi - classical propagator takes the form @xmath1\\exp\\big[-\\big(|a|^2+|b|^2\\big)/4 \\hbar\\big]\\ ] ] where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are coherent states on the torus , and @xmath4 is a classical generating function .",
    "similar propagators have been encountered before using spin coherent states @xcite , but all may be thought of as variants of those derived long ago by van vleck @xcite and gutzwiller @xcite .",
    "semi - classical propagators play an important role in the path - integral formulation of quantum mechanics @xcite and the related theory of periodic orbit quantization @xcite .",
    "the latter has been investigated thoroughly for the balazs - voros quantum baker s map @xcite .    in deriving a semi - classical approximation only for the one - step propagator",
    ", we avoid complications which will arise after many iterations of the mapping . for long time scales",
    ", simple quantum - to - classical correspondences will break down @xcite and one must incorporate the theories of decoherence @xcite or continuous measurement @xcite .",
    "the classical limit of the schack - caves quantization has already been investigated @xcite in this light using a decoherent histories approach @xcite .",
    "however only a special case ( @xmath5 in our notation ) was considered .",
    "we proceed under an assumption that provided our one - step propagator agrees with the baker s transformation in the semi - classical limit @xmath0 , decoherence will restore quantum - to - classical correspondences for long time scales .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we introduce the baker s map , both in classical and quantal form .",
    "coherent states for a toroidal phase space are also introduced . in section",
    "iii our core results are presented . here",
    "we derive semi - classical approximations to the coherent - state propagator and give conditions for when the schack - caves quantizations have the proper classical limit .",
    "finally , in section iv , we summarize our findings .",
    "the baker s map is a standard example in chaotic dynamics .",
    "it is a mapping of the unit square onto itself in the form @xmath6 where @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the integer part of @xmath9 , and @xmath10 denotes the @xmath10-th iteration of the map .",
    "geometrically , the map stretches the unit square by a factor of two in the @xmath11 direction , squeezes by a factor of a half in the @xmath12 direction , and then stacks the right half onto the left .",
    "the map s action may be rewritten in terms of the complex variable @xmath13 , @xmath14 a generating function for this mapping ( up to an arbitrary constant ) is @xmath15 assuming @xmath16 is non - integer .",
    "the classical baker s map may then be rederived _ via _ the relations @xmath17    interest in the baker s map is due mainly to the simplicity of its _ symbolic dynamics_.",
    "if each point of the unit square is identified through its binary representation , @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) , with a bi - infinite symbolic string @xmath21 then the action of the baker s map is to shift the position of the dot by one point to the right , @xmath22    for a quantum mechanical version of the map , we work in the @xmath23-dimensional hilbert space , @xmath24 , spanned by either the position states @xmath25 , with eigenvalues @xmath26 , or momentum states @xmath27 , with eigenvalues @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) . the constants @xmath30 determine the periodicity of the space : @xmath31 , @xmath32 . such double periodicity identifies @xmath24 with a toroidal phase space .",
    "the vectors of each basis are orthonormal @xmath33 , @xmath34 and the two bases are related _ via _ the finite fourier transform @xmath35 for consistency of units , we must have @xmath36 .",
    "the first work on a quantum baker s map was done by balazs and voros @xcite .",
    "their expression for the map was given in the form @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the finite fourier transform acting on half of the hilbert space . later saraceno @xcite improved certain symmetry characteristics of the map using anti - periodic boundary conditions ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "finally , taking again the anti - periodic hilbert space , schack and caves @xcite introduced a whole class of quantum baker s maps for dimensions @xmath40 .",
    "for these cases , we can model our space as the product of @xmath41 qubits with a binary expansion association @xmath42 where @xmath43 has the binary expansion @xmath44 next we rewrite the quantum fourier transform as @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "the connection with the classical baker s map comes from its symbolic dynamics . in the quantum case",
    ", a string is created through the partial fourier transform @xmath48 .",
    "it is an operator which fourier transforms the @xmath49 least significant qubits of a state @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath9 are defined through the binary expansions @xmath52 and @xmath53 . in the limiting cases",
    ", we have @xmath54 and @xmath55 .    the analogy to the classical case",
    "is made clear through the definition @xmath56 these states form an orthonormal basis and are localized in both position and momentum .",
    "they are strictly localized in a position region of width @xmath57 centered at @xmath58 , and are roughly localized in a momentum region of width @xmath59 centered at @xmath60 .    )",

    "( [ symbseq ] ) , we see that each quantum baker s map takes a state localized at @xmath68 to a state localized at @xmath69 .",
    "the decrease in the number of position bits and increase in momentum bits enforces a stretching and squeezing of phase space in a manner resembling the classical baker s map . in figures",
    "[ gstates](a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) , we have plotted the husimi function ( defined below ) for the partially fourier transformed states ( [ partialfourierstates ] ) when @xmath61 , and @xmath62 , 1 and 0 , respectively .",
    "the quantum baker s map is simply a one - to - one mapping of one basis to another",
    ".    it will be useful to rewrite our baker s map in the position basis . to do this ,",

    "however the above representation proves to be most convenient when performing our semi - classical analysis .    we will now introduce _",

    "observe from eq .",
    "( [ bakern ] ) that in this limit , the total number of position and momentum bits @xmath41 necessarily become infinite .",

    "the saddle - point approximation can be written down immediately using well - known formulae found in any standard text @xcite .",
