    "local symmetries play an important role in the study of differential equations .",
    "in particular , they are extensively used in the case of ordinary differential equations ( odes ) since they provide a unified approach to the reduction problem .",
    "in fact , if an ode @xmath1 admits a local symmetry , one can use this symmetry to reduce the order of @xmath1 by one .",
    "hence , when the symmetry algebra of @xmath1 is sufficiently large ( and solvable ) , this can be solved by quadratures .",
    "local ( classical or higher ) symmetries of a @xmath3-th order ode @xmath1 in the unknown @xmath4 are defined by the solutions to a linear pdes depending on the derivatives of @xmath4 up to order @xmath5 . since the general solution to this pde",
    "can not be found unless one knows the general solution to @xmath1 , one usually can only search for particular solutions depending on derivatives of @xmath4 up to order @xmath6 .",
    "therefore , if @xmath1 does not have such a kind of symmetries it may be not solvable by quadratures . moreover , one may encounter equations which can be solved by quadrature but with a lack of symmetries of order less or equal to @xmath6 .",
    "in fact , examples of this type are well known in the recent literature ( @xcite ) but the first examples probably go back to equations of the type classified by painlev @xcite .",
    "these examples seem to prove that local symmetries are sometimes inadequate to handle equations which have not enough local symmetries and they raise the question of whether an extension of the notion of symmetry would lead to a more effective method of reduction . hence , various attempts in this direction have been done and some new classes of symmetries have been introduced . among these , in the last few years , a special attention has been devoted to a new class of symmetries introduced by muriel and romero in @xcite ( see also @xcite).these symmetries are neither lie point nor lie - bcklund and are called @xmath0-symmetries , since they are vector fields which depend on a function @xmath0 .    in the case of equations with a lack of point symmetries , muriel and romero have shown that many of the order - reduction processes can be explained by the invariance of the equation under @xmath0-symmetries .",
    "in fact , if an equation is invariant under a @xmath0-symmetry , one can obtain a complete set of functionally independent invariants and reduce the order of the equation by one as for lie symmetries .",
    "the aim of this paper is to show that this new class of symmetries can be always recovered by a class of nonlocal symmetries of the given equation .",
    "in fact , we show that by embedding a given ode @xmath1 into a suitable system @xmath2 determined by the function @xmath0 , any @xmath0-symmetry of @xmath1 correspond to a local standard symmetry of @xmath2 ( see proposition [ main_proposition ] ) . as a consequence ,",
    "we show that the reduction method of muriel and romero follows from the standard method of reduction by differential invariants applied to @xmath2 .",
    "an outline of the paper is as follows . in section [ preliminari ] , in order to fix notations and for the convenience of the reader , we collect some notations and basic facts from the geometric theory of differential equations . in section [ interpretazione ] , after recalling the definition of @xmath7-symmetries ( as given in @xcite ) , we present our main result ( proposition [ main_proposition ] ) on the nonlocal interpretation of @xmath0-symmetries .",
    "finally , in section [ riduzione ] , we use the nonlocal interpretation of @xmath0-symmetries to reinterpret the muriel - romero reduction method as a nonlocal symmetry - reduction method .",
    "in this section we collect some notations and basic facts from the geometric theory of differential equations .",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite for further details .",
    "let @xmath8 be a smooth manifold and @xmath9 a smooth @xmath10 dimensional vector bundle .",
    "we denote by @xmath11 the @xmath3-order _ jet bundle _ associated to @xmath12 and by @xmath13 the @xmath3-order _ jet prolongation _ of a section @xmath14 of @xmath12 . since in this paper we are only concerned with the case @xmath15 , we assume that @xmath8 and @xmath16 have local coordinates @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "correspondingly , the induced natural coordinates on @xmath19 will be @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , where the @xmath23 s are defined by @xmath24 , for any section @xmath14 of @xmath12 .",
    "moreover , when no confusion arises , einstein summation convention over repeated indices will be used .    the @xmath3__-order jet space _",
    "_ @xmath19 is a manifold equipped with the smooth distribution @xmath25 of tangent planes to graphs of @xmath3-order jet prolongations @xmath13 .",
    "this is the _ contact ( or cartan ) distribution _ _ of _ @xmath26 , whose infinitesimal symmetries will be referred to as _ lie symmetries _ on @xmath19 . a special kind of lie symmetries on @xmath19 is represented by the _ lie point symmetries _ which are obtained as prolongation of vector fields @xmath27 on @xmath16 .",
    "a fundamental theorem due to bcklund @xcite shows that only when @xmath28 there are examples of lie symmetries on @xmath29 which are not the prolongation of point transformations .",
    "these lie symmetries , which do not come from point transformations , are called _ lie contact symmetries _ and can always be recovered as the prolongation of a lie symmetry @xmath27 on @xmath30 .",
    "we denote by @xmath31 ( or @xmath32 ) the lie point ( or contact , respectively ) symmetry obtained by prolonging the vector field @xmath27 to @xmath19 .    in this framework",
    "a @xmath3-th order system of differential equations can be regarded as a submanifold @xmath33 and any solution of the system is a section of @xmath12 whose @xmath3-order prolongation is an integral manifold of the restriction @xmath34 of the contact distribution to @xmath35 .",
    "a lie symmetry which is tangent to @xmath35 is , of course , also a symmetry of @xmath36 and is called a _ classical symmetry of _ @xmath35 .",
    "the fundamental role of classical symmetries in this context is due to the fact that , since they shuffle integral manifolds of @xmath37 , they induce a transformation on the space of solutions of @xmath35 .",
    "the natural projections @xmath38 , for any @xmath39 , allow one to define the bundle of infinite jets @xmath40 as the inverse limit of the tower of projections @xmath41 .",
    "the manifold @xmath42 is infinite dimensional with induced coordinates @xmath20 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and the @xmath45-algebra of smooth functions on @xmath42 is defined as @xmath46 .",
    "hence , any @xmath47 is a function of some arbitrary large but finite number of jet coordinates .",
    "analogously to the case of finite dimensional manifolds , tangent vectors and vector fields on @xmath42 are defined as derivations of @xmath48 .",
    "the set @xmath49 of vector fields on @xmath42 has the structure of a lie algebra , with respect to the commutator @xmath50   $ ] .",
    "since smooth sections of @xmath12 can be infinitely prolonged , if we consider the tangent planes to the graphs of @xmath51-order jet prolongations @xmath52 , one can also define a _ contact distribution _",
    "@xmath53 on @xmath42 . in terms of coordinates",
    ", @xmath53 is defined by the _ total derivative _ operator @xmath54 which annihilates all the _ contact forms _ @xmath55 .",
    "if @xmath27 is a lie symmetry , by considering the sequence of prolongations @xmath56 one gets the vector field @xmath57 , which is a symmetry of @xmath53 called the _ infinite prolongation _ of @xmath27 .",
    "however , contrary to the case of finite order jet spaces , symmetries of @xmath53 can not always be recovered by infinite prolongations of lie symmetries .",
    "in fact it can be proved that @xmath58 is an infinitesimal symmetry of @xmath53 if and only if @xmath59 are arbitrary functions and @xmath60 hence , @xmath61 is the infinite prolongation of a lie point ( or contact ) symmetry iff @xmath62 are functions on @xmath16 ( or @xmath30 , respectively ) .",

    "analogously , by considering the infinite prolongations of sections of @xmath12 , one can define the _ infinite _ _ prolongation _ @xmath69 .    in this paper we will deal only with ( systems of ) ordinary differential equations @xmath35 which are in _",

    "analogously to the case of classical symmetries , the key role played by symmetries of @xmath69 is due to the fact that they shuffle integral manifolds of @xmath76 and hence they induce a transformation in the space of infinite prolongations of solutions to @xmath35 .",
    "hence , instead of computing symmetries @xmath61 of @xmath53 which are tangent to @xmath69 , one should be mainly interested in computing their restrictions @xmath77 to @xmath69 .",
    "this choice turns out to be also convenient since it noteworthy simplifies computations ( see @xcite for more details about these and others aspects of @xmath51-jets theory ) .",
    "this section is devoted to the proof of the main result of the paper , which is the reinterpretation of @xmath0-symmetries of an ode @xmath1 ( as introduced in @xcite ) as shadows of nonlocal symmetries of @xmath1 .",
    "a first heuristic generalization of local symmetries appeared in @xcite and @xcite in the form of a nonlocal point of view . a conceptual framework for nonlocal symmetries",
    "is provided by the notion of _",
    "covering_. since here we only deal with ordinary differential equations , we give the definition of covering only in this case .",

    "let @xmath1 be a @xmath3-order ode on a one - dimensional bundle @xmath78 .",
    "we shall say that a smooth bundle @xmath79 is a covering for the ordinary differential equation @xmath1 if the manifold @xmath80 is equipped with a 1-dimensional distribution@xmath81 and , for any point @xmath82 , the tangent mapping @xmath83 gives an isomorphism between @xmath84 and the restriction @xmath85 of the contact distribution of @xmath86 to @xmath87 .",

    ", one can interpret @xmath95 as a parameterized family of solutions to @xmath1 .",
    "it follows that , in this picture , symmetries of @xmath84 also play a key role .",
    "in fact , since these symmetries shuffle integral manifolds of @xmath84 , they induce a transformation on @xmath1 which maps solutions to solutions . in view of this fact , we give the following    nonlocal symmetries of @xmath1 are the symmetries of the distribution @xmath84 of a covering @xmath96 .",

    "therefore , the reduced equation @xmath217 is determined by rewriting @xmath209 in terms of these invariants .    however , since we have proved that any @xmath0-symmetry of @xmath218 can be recovered as a local symmetry of @xmath219 , one can expect that proposition [ rid - muriel - romero ] above represents an application of mdi to @xmath2 .",
    "it is indeed the case as the following argument shows .    under assumptions of proposition [ rid - muriel - romero ] , the @xmath7-symmetry @xmath135}$ ]",
    "can be recovered by a nonlocal symmetry @xmath61 whose restriction @xmath220 to @xmath115 possess the invariants @xmath221 . then @xmath220 also admits the derived invariants @xmath222",
    ". moreover , since any @xmath215 depends on @xmath198 , the differential invariant @xmath223 are all functionally independent whereas @xmath224 .",
    "therefore , in terms of @xmath225 , @xmath226 can be rewritten in the form @xmath227 .",
    "now , since in @xmath2 the second equation is integrable by the quadrature @xmath228 , the general solution of @xmath2 can be obtained by solving first @xmath210 and then the auxiliary @xmath212-order ode @xmath213 .",
    "this proves the following    the reduction of @xmath229 via the @xmath7-symmetry @xmath135}$ ] is conditioned to that of @xmath219 via the nonlocal symmetry @xmath61 , and vice - versa .",
    "notice that , since the reduction can be achieved just by means of the invariants of @xmath135}$ ] , above discussion shows that the application of mdi to @xmath229 is independent from the explicit determination of a solution to the reconstruction problem ( see remark [ remark_1 ] ) for @xmath135}$ ] .",
    "a number of completely worked - out examples of reduction of odes by means of the method of proposition [ rid - muriel - romero ] are given in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "therefore the reader is referred to these papers for a detailed list of examples . however , we conclude this section with a couple of examples which provide an application of the above nonlocal symmetry - reduction method.*example 4 . *",
    "let @xmath1 be defined as@xmath230 as shown in @xcite , equation ( [ esempio - mu - ro ] ) does not have lie point symmetries but , for @xmath231 and @xmath183 , admits the @xmath0-symmetry @xmath176}$ ] .",
    "this @xmath0-symmetry can be recovered by a symmetry @xmath61 of the system @xmath2 , defined by ( [ esempio - mu - ro ] ) and @xmath232 .",

    "now , the invariants @xmath235 and @xmath236 reads @xmath237 and , in terms of the system @xmath238 , ( [ esempio - mu - ro ] ) reads @xmath239 therefore , since the general solution of ( [ mu - ro - int ] ) is@xmath240 one can find the general solution of ( [ esempio - mu - ro ] ) by solving the last equation @xmath241 since this equation can be linearized by the transformation @xmath242 , the general solution to ( [ esempio - mu - ro ] ) is@xmath243 * example 5 . *",
    "let @xmath1 be the ode ( [ esempio 3 ] ) of example 3 .",
    "as observed above , @xmath1 admits a @xmath0-symmetry which can be recovered by the following ( higher ) symmetry of @xmath2 ( the system defined by ( [ esempio 3 ] ) and @xmath244)@xmath245\\ ] ] where @xmath185 is a solution of ( [ pippone ] ) .",
    "now , the invariants @xmath235 and @xmath236 are just the invariants of @xmath220 ( the restriction of @xmath61 to @xmath115 ) which depend only on @xmath246 . therefore ,",
    "since @xmath220 simply reads as@xmath247   , \\ ] ] one can readily check that these invariants are@xmath248 and , in terms of the system @xmath249 , ( [ esempio 3 ] ) becomes @xmath250.it follows that @xmath251 , @xmath252 , and then the solutions of ( [ esempio 3 ] ) are described by the generalized riccati equation ( see @xcite)@xmath253",
    "the relevance of @xmath0-symmetries , introduced first in @xcite , is due to the fact that a number of equations not possessing lie point symmetries can be reduced by a method which makes use of @xmath0-symmetries .",
    "unfortunately , despite their name , @xmath0-symmetries of an ode @xmath254 are not at all symmetries ( unless @xmath255 ) and the @xmath0-symmetry reduction method may appear to be somehow unrelated to standard symmetry reduction methods .",
    "we have shown it is not the case : according to the main result of this paper ( see proposition [ main_proposition ] ) , @xmath0-symmetries of @xmath1 correspond to a special kind of nonlocal symmetries of @xmath1 .",
    "in fact , following the approach to nonlocal symmetries based on the notion of coverings @xcite , @xmath0-symmetries can be obtained by first embedding @xmath1 into the system @xmath256 and then computing local symmetries @xmath61 of @xmath2 which have the form ( [ pippo])-([pippo_2 ] ) and are such that @xmath145   = y$ ] .    as a consequence",
    ", one can show that ( see section [ riduzione ] above ) the @xmath0-symmetry reduction method of muriel and romero readily follows from the standard method of reduction by differential invariants applied to the system @xmath2 .",
    "finally , some remarks are in order . since their first appearance",
    ", @xmath7-symmetries have stimulated new research on the reduction problem for differential equations @xcite .",
    "in particular , a generalization of @xmath0-symmetries has been proposed in @xcite through the so called telescopic vector fields . however , as in the case of @xmath0-symmetries , also this generalization can be recovered by a nonlocal theory of symmetries .",
    "in fact , any telescopic vector field can be recovered as a nonlocal symmetry of the form ( [ pippo])-([pippo_2 ] ) such that @xmath257 and @xmath145   = y$ ] .",
