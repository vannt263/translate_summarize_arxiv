    "patterned and heterogeneously charged materials , in particular if the heterogeneity is disorder induced , have received much attention in recent years in a number of different research areas .",
    "for instance , randomly charged polyelectrolytes @xcite and patchy colloids @xcite show distinct collective and thermodynamic properties than ordinary colloids and charged homopolymers @xcite .",
    "proteins for instance represents a prime example of biological molecules exhibiting heterogeneous and highly disordered charge distributions . the high specificity and",
    "selectivity of protein - protein interactions is one of the fundamental problems of molecular biology and requires an understanding of the interaction between randomly patterned surfaces @xcite .",
    "another example which has been in the focus of recent experimental investigations is the problem of interaction between surfactant - coated surfaces which exhibit unusually strong and long - range attractive forces @xcite , shown to stem directly from the presence of quenched random domains ( patches ) of positive and negative charges on these surfaces @xcite .",
    "in fact , most solid surfaces exhibit heterogeneous charge distributions that can be highly disordered as revealed by recent kelvin force microscopy measurements @xcite . such random charges may result from the surface adsorption of charged contaminants and/or impurities , while even clean polycrystalline samples display patchy surface potentials @xcite .",
    "the patchiness of the surface potential is believed to lead to significantly large effects in the experiments aimed at measuring the casimir - van der waals ( vdw ) interactions between solid surfaces in vacuum .",
    "indeed , recent ultra - high sensitivity measurements have shown the presence of an  anomalously \" long - range interaction which can easily mask the casimir - vdw force at sufficiently large separations @xcite .    in a series of theoretical papers @xcite ,",
    "the effects of quenched monopolar charge disorder in the bulk or surface of dielectric slabs were investigated .",
    "it was shown that even a small amount of quenched random charges can lead to strong long - range interactions between dielectric slabs .",
    "these interactions were shown to result directly from the interplay between the electrostatic interactions generated by the presence of dielectric discontinuities ( the so - called image charge effects ) and the quenched statistics of the random charges .",
    "it is thus remarkable to note that such forces exist even for dielectrics which are _ electroneutral _ on the average but carry a disordered charge component . in this case , net coulomb forces are obviously absent and thus the disordered - induced forces directly compete with the casimir - vdw forces .",
    "while the latter dominates at small separations , the former becomes substantially large and wins at large separations .",
    "the previous calculations were however performed only within the classical regime , where only the zero matsubara frequency contributes to the casimir - vdw force @xcite .",
    "strictly speaking , this approximation would be valid above the thermal wavelength ( around 7 microns at room temperature ) @xcite , although the contribution from higher - order matsubara frequencies would in fact dominate at much smaller separations depending on the dielectric properties of the materials ( e.g. , below about 1 micron in vacuum and 100  nm in a polar medium such as water @xcite ) .",
    "the zero - frequency results would be relevant for the large - distance regime where the above - mentioned anomalous force is observed @xcite .",
    "however , at sub - micron separations , it would be necessary to examine the quantum effects from the higher - order matsubara modes of the electromagnetic field fluctuations .    in the present work",
    ", we shall thus set out to investigate in detail the interaction between two randomly charged net - neutral dielectric slabs by accounting for the full spectrum of electromagnetic field fluctuations in the following two cases : i ) the slabs interact across a disorder - free dielectric continuum , considering both similar as well as dissimilar slabs , and ii ) the slabs are separated in general by a dielectric layer which itself may contain random quenched charges . in both cases ,",
    "the results can be compared directly against those reported previously @xcite ; hence , we can determine the effects of the inclusion of higher - order matsubara frequencies , which will be computed via the lifshitz formalism @xcite , as well as the quenched disorder charges in the intervening medium .",
    "these results thus generalize the analysis of the disorder effects to all ranges of separation down to the nano scale ( as long as the continuum dielectric model employed within the lifshitz formalism remains valid ) .",
    "we can then draw conclusions regarding the crossover between different scaling regimes for the interaction between slabs , which were missing from a zero - frequency analysis @xcite .",
    "in particular , we show that the characteristic @xmath0 decay @xcite of the total force with the distance @xmath1 between two randomly charged but otherwise ( dielectrically ) identical semi - infinite slabs sets in well within the retarded regime ( around , e.g. , 50 - 500  nm ) .",
    "therefore , it is found that the interaction crosses over to this @xmath0 disorder - induced behavior from the standard ( retarded ) @xmath2 casimir - vdw behavior rather than from the classical zero - frequency @xmath3 behavior .",
    "it turns out that even for highly clean samples ( with disorder charge densities down to @xmath4 ) , the magnitude of the disorder - induced force is substantial if compared with the casimir - vdw force .    for dielectrically dissimilar slabs ,",
    "we show that the non - monotonic behavior @xcite of the total force as a function of distance persists when higher - order matsubara frequencies are included . however in almost all cases , the equilibrium separation defined through the zero of total force ( which can represent either a stable or unstable free energy extremum ) is shifted to separations that can be substantially larger than those predicted within the zero - frequency theory @xcite .",
    "this is an important consequence of our analysis and suggests that the non - monotonic features of the interaction force between dielectric slabs could be easily amenable to experimental measurements in this regime @xcite .",
    "such non - monotonic interaction profiles have received a lot of attention in the context of the casimir effect in recent years and may arise in the case of metamaterials @xcite and/or other exotic materials such as topological insulators @xcite , as well as in certain non - trivial geometries @xcite . in our analysis the @xmath0 behavior of the interaction force for identical slabs and the non - monotonic force profile for dissimilar slabs represent characteristic fingerprints of the charge disorder and can thus be useful in assessing whether the experimentally observed interactions in ordinary dielectrics can be interpreted in terms of disorder effects .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows : in section [ sec : model ] , we introduce our model and the details of the formalism employed in our analysis .",
    "the results for two semi - infinite slabs interacting across vacuum or a disorder - free dielectric layer are discussed in section [ sec : no_dis ] and those for the case where the slabs interacting across a dielectric layer which itself contains disordered charges is discussed in section [ sec : dis ] .",
    "we conclude our study in section [ sec : discussion ] .",

    "@xcite for the cases studied with annealed or partially annealed disorder , or with mobile ions on or in between the randomly charged surfaces on the zero - frequency level ) .",
    "the quenched model is an idealization of the real nature of random charge distributions that can in general exhibit dynamical behavior , but these effects are expected to be small since ion relaxation processes are extremely slow on the scale of the matsubara frequencies .",
    "we base our analytical calculations on no other assumption regarding the lateral correlation function , so the expressions in what follows may be applied straightforwardly to some rather general cases , such as disorder distributions with a  patchy \" structure characterized by a lateral correlation function decaying over a finite correlation length @xcite .",
    "although , for the sake of brevity , we restrict our final discussion in this paper to the case where the disorder distribution is statistically homogeneous and uncorrelated , @xmath25 , thus @xmath26    in our previous works , we derived the partition function of the system defined above for the case where the intervening medium is free from any kind of charge disorder and the electromagnetic field fluctuations are taken into account only on the zero - frequency level @xcite .",

    ", we shall account for all higher - order matsubara modes of the electromagnetic field fluctuations , which become increasingly important at small separations down to the nano scale .",
    "it is easy to see that when the disorder is perfectly quenched , as indeed we assume here , these charge sources only couple to the zero - frequency mode and thus do not mix with the higher - order frequency modes of the electromagnetic field fluctuations .",

    "in particular , it is shown that the characteristic @xmath0 behavior due to quenched disorder @xcite sets in well within the retarded regime ( e.g. , around 50 - 500  nm in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2]a ) and thus the force curves deviate rapidly from the standard ( retarded ) @xmath2 casimir - vdw behavior even for highly clean samples with disorder variances down to @xmath4 .",
    "this behavior should be contrasted with the zero - frequency theory @xcite which predicts that the @xmath0 emerges due to a crossover from the classical @xmath3 behavior .",
    "another remarkable prediction that follows from our present analysis is that the non - monotonic behavior of the total force as a function of distance persists when higher - order matsubara frequencies are included ; however , in almost all cases , the ( stable or unstable ) equilibrium separation is shifted to much larger values than predicted based solely on the zero - frequency theory @xcite .",
    "this is important in that it predicts that the disorder - generated non - monotonic behavior of the force is more easily amenable to experimental measurements that expected from zero - frequency calculations .",
    "we have also shown that the presence of charge disorder in the intervening medium leads to another additive contribution to the total force that can be repulsive or attractive depending on the system parameters ( such as the relationship between dielectric response functions of the media ) and can , for instance , wash out the non - monotonic behavior of the total force .",
    "such non - monotonic behaviors for the interaction between dielectric slabs have received a lot of attention in the context of the casimir effect and are known to emerge , e.g. , in the case of metamaterials @xcite and/or other exotic materials such as topological insulators @xcite , as well as in certain non - trivial geometries @xcite . in our analysis the @xmath0 behavior of the force for identical slabs and the non - monotonic force profile for dissimilar slabs represent characteristic fingerprints of the charge disorder and can thus be useful in assessing whether the experimentally observed interactions in ordinary dielectrics can be interpreted in terms of disorder effects .",
    "we presented our results explicitly for the case where the disorder distribution is statistically homogeneous and uncorrelated in space , although the formalism in section [ sec : model ] is in general applicable to layered materials exhibiting finite lateral correlations for the disorder charges as well .",
    "thus , it would be interesting in the future to examine the above - mentioned effects in the situation where the disorder distribution consists of random patches ( domains ) of finite size @xcite , and specifically , when the layering assumption is relaxed and the correlation domains within the slabs have a three - dimensional structure .",
