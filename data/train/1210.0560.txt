    "despite several years of studies , the chemical evolution history of the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) as well its star formation history ( sfh ) is still poorly understood .",
    "the lmc has experienced a complex sfh due to the interaction occurred both with the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) and the galaxy @xcite . a clear evidence of this quite complex evolution can be recognized in the lmc star cluster system , characterized by a wide range of age and metallicities .",
    "the study of these cluster stellar populations reveals the existence of at least three components : the old ( @xmath1 13 gyr , @xcite , @xcite ) metal - poor component ( [ fe / h ] @xmath3 1.5 dex , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) probably formed during the first episode of star formation ( sf ) , the intermediate age component ( @xmath1 13 gyr , @xcite , @xcite ) which is the dominant one , and a young component ( @xmath4 1 gyr , @xcite , @xcite ) that include the last formed clusters .",
    "the sfh of field stellar populations is less known .",
    "@xcite found that the dominant stellar population in the central bar was formed between 4 - 6 gyr and 1 - 2 gyr ago .",
    "this result was substantially confirmed by the simulations of @xcite who found that the formation of young stellar populations in the lmc bar is associated with efficient sf in the last few gyr ( in particular , @xmath1 2 gyr ago ) .",
    "a comprehensive spectroscopic study of field populations was performed by @xcite measuring the infrared caii triplet of 373 giant stars located around the center of the bar .",
    "they found a distribution peaked at [ fe / h ] @xmath1 0.4 dex with a low metallicity tail reaching [ fe / h ] @xmath4 2.0 dex . @xcite",
    "have measured the infrared caii triplet in four fields at different radial distances ( @xmath1 3@xmath5 , 5@xmath5 , 6@xmath5 and 8@xmath5 , that is between 2.6 and 7 kpc ) from the center of lmc .",
    "they found an average [ fe / h ] @xmath1 0.5 dex for the closest fields , a lower [ fe / h ] @xmath1 0.8 dex was found only in the more distant one .",
    "a detailed spectroscopic analysis of 59 giant stars located in the inner disk at @xmath1 1.2 kpc from the center was performed by @xcite , who found a distribution peaked at [ fe / h ] @xmath1 0.75 dex .",
    "this paper is part of a project devoted to investigate the kinematic and chemical properties of the stellar populations in the lmc through the use of high - resolution spectra , able to provide accurate information about the kinematics , the metallicity and the chemical abundance of individual elements of these stars .",
    "previous papers of the project have discussed the properties of old @xcite , intermediate - age @xcite and young @xcite globular clusters ( gc ) in the lmc .",
    "this paper is the first of the project dedicated to the kinematic and chemical characterization of the lmc field stellar populations : we present chemical patterns for a sample of 89 red giant branch ( rgb ) stars members of the lmc and located in the field around the old metal - poor gc ngc  1786 .",

    "the spectroscopic targets have been selected by using the near - infrared ( j , h and k bands ) photometric catalog , obtained by combining the sofi catalog for the inner @xmath1 2.5 arcmin , corresponding to the area covered by the gc ngc  1786 ( see @xcite for details ) and the two micro all sky survey ( 2mass ) catalog for the outermost region , in order to sample the surrouding field population .",

    "mg abundances have been derived with the same technique by using the strong line 5711.09 @xmath9 ; we decide to exclude the mg triplet at @xmath1 6318 @xmath9 because these weak lines are located on the red wing of a close auto - ionization ca line .",

    "for each abundance ratio we take into account two source of uncertainties , the internal error relative to the ew measurements and that arising from the uncertainties in the atmospheric parameters .",

    "daospec provides also for each measured spectral line an error computed from the standard deviation of the local flux residuals ( representing a 68% confidence interval on the derived value of the ew ) .",
    "these uncertainties have been used only in the computation of the slopes in the a(fe  i ) vs @xmath19 and a(fe  i ) vs ewr planes ( see section 3 ) .",
    "recently , @xcite pointed out that the internal ew errors provided by daospec are under - estimated of a factor of 2 with respect to those derived with the classical formula by @xcite , probably due to the pixel correlation during the wavelength calibration .",
    "we checked this effect in our data , assuming the fwhm estimated by daospec and the proper snr for each spectrum . on average",
    ", we found a general agreement between the two sets of uncertainties ( within @xmath14 10 - 20% ) but not a systematic effect .",
    "however , the daospec errors provide an internal ranking among the measured lines in a given star and possible systematic under / over - estimates do not afflict our results .    for o and mg , for which we derived the abundances from spectral synthesis of only one line each ,",
    "the uncertainty in the measurement has been estimated by resorting to monte carlo simulations .",
    "we study some stars as representative of the different snr of our targets .",
    "we injected poisson noise into the best - fit synthetic spectrum according to the snr of the observed spectrum and we repeated the fit procedure ; for each line we performed a total of 500 monte carlo events , assuming as uncertainty in the fitting procedure 1@xmath11 of the abundances distribution .",
    "for the o line ( falling in the hr13 grating ) , the derived uncertainties are of 0.04 , 0.03 and 0.02 dex at snr=  30 , 50 and 80 respectively , while for the mg line ( falling in the hr11 grating ) we obtained uncertainties of 0.13 , 0.09 and 0.04 dex for snr=  30 , 40 and 70 .",
    "we estimated also the uncertainty due to the continuum location , by using the root mean square of the residual provided by daospec , after removing all the fitted lines from the observed spectrum .",
    "for our stars the typical dispersion of the residual spectra is of @xmath14 3 - 4% , corresponding to an error in the abundances less than 0.1 dex . keeping in mind that daospec estimates a global continuum along the entire spectrum ( and not a local continuum for each individual transition )",
    ", this uncertainty can be considered as a systematic errorbar for all the lines in a given spectrum .",
    "the uncertainty arising from the atmospheric parameters has been computed following the approach described by @xcite .",
    "the usual method to derive the errors due to the stellar parameters is to vary one only parameter each time , keeping the other ones fixed and finally adding in quadrature the derived abundance variations .",
    "obviously , this method does not take into account the correlations among the atmospheric parameters , providing only a conservative value for the uncertainty . in our case , @xmath15 and @xmath23",
    "have been optimized spectroscopically ( and log  g has been derived according to the spectroscopic temperature ) , thus all the parameters are not independent each other . for each star ,",
    "the temperature has been varied by @xmath14 1@xmath28 , because the uncertainty in @xmath15 dominates the derived abundances as pointed out by @xcite .",
    "then , we repeated the optimization procedure described above by keeping the temperature fixed and deriving new values for log  g and @xmath23 .",
    "the advantage of this method is to naturally take into account the covariance terms among the parameters ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "the procedure has been repeated independently for each star by considering the corresponding @xmath29 uncertainty computed from the error of the slope in the a(fe)@xmath19 plane .",
    "table [ tab3 ] lists the results of this procedure for a representative star of our sample : the second column shows the final uncertainty for each abundance ratio , while the other columns are the results obtained with the usual approach to vary independently each parameter .",
    "last column of table [ tab3 ] is the sum in quadrature of the uncertainties due to one only parameter : these values are larger than those obtained with the @xcite approach because the covariances among the parameters is neglected .",
    "typical abundance uncertainties due to the atmospheric parameters are of the order of [ fe / h ] = @xmath14 0.03 dex , [ o / fe ] = @xmath14 0.04 dex , [ mg / fe ] = @xmath14 0.06 dex and [ si / fe ] = @xmath14 0.09 dex .    finally , the total internal error for each abundance ratio was obtained by adding in quadrature the error associated to ew measurements and atmospheric parameters .",

    "the [ o / fe ] ratio appears systematically lower than those measured in the galaxy and basically consistent with those by @xcite , even if they provide a few of measures for this abundance ratio .",
    "the [ mg / fe ] ratio turns out to be subsolar in the entire metallicity range and ever lower than the milky way stars ; also , our targets show lower mg abundances with respect to those measured by @xcite and we attribute such a discrepancy to the different values of oscillator strengths and damping constants for the mg line at 5711 @xmath9 employing in the two analysis . finally , the [ si / fe ] ratio seems to be barely consistent with the galactic stars , despite a larger dispersion .",

    "a substantial agreement of our abundances was generally found with the values measured in dsphs , in particular with the abundance ratios observed in the metal - poor component of the sagittarius dwarf galaxy @xcite : such a similarity of @xmath0-elements , metallicity distribution and fraction of metal - poor stars has been already suggested by @xcite .",
    "we determined kinematic and chemical properties for 89 giant stars members of the disk of the lmc .",
    "this sample increases significantly the number of stars analysed so far through high - resolution spectroscopy ( the largest sample observed by @xcite includes 59 stars ) .",
    "the derived metallicity distribution is dominated by lmc - r , a metal - rich and narrow component peaked at [ fe / h ] = 0.48 dex , with a secondary component lmc - p peaked at [ fe / h ] = @xmath1 1.0 dex and reaching [ fe / h ] = @xmath1 1.5 dex ( right panel of fig .",

    "the kinematic and abundance distributions can be now compared to those observed in the stellar population of the gc ngc  1786 .",
    "all the stars of our sample belong to the rgb , hence their age can range from @xmath1 1 - 2 gyr up to @xmath1 12 - 13 gyr , thus excluding very recent ( last 500 myr ) burst of star formation . at variance to the stars belonging to a stellar cluster ,",
    "the determination of the age for field stars through isochrone fitting is a dangerous and uncertain technique , because the position of a rgb star in the color - magnitude diagram is weakly sensitive to the age and highly affected by uncertainties in the color excess , evolutive mass and distance .",
    "even if precise ages for each target star can not be determined , we can draw the timeline of the chemical evolution in this region of the lmc , by comparing our results with the recent simulations by @xcite and the sfh inferred by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite in different regions of the lmc ; unfortunately , there are no determinations of sfh in the region of our targets .",
    "( 1 )  ngc  1786 is an old lmc gc generated during the first burst of sf occurred @xmath1 1213 gyr ago .",
    "following @xcite a loose stellar halo of old stars with a velocity dispersion of about @xmath1 40 km s@xmath13 and a broad metallicity distribution is also expected to be formed during that event .",
    "it is interesting to check whether some of the stars observed in our sample could belong to ngc  1786 or to the lmc halo .",
    "note that @xcite found for ngc  1786 @xmath35 = 264.3 km s@xmath13 ( @xmath32 = 5.7 km s@xmath13 ) , [ fe / h ] = 1.75 dex and [ @xmath0/fe ] = 0.37 dex .",
    "figure  [ feh_vrad ] shows that none of the observed stars has kinematic and chemical properties compatible with the population of ngc  1786 .",
    "in particular , the observed sample has a systematically higher [ fe / h ] ( @xmath36 1.0 dex ) and a lower [ @xmath0/fe ] ( @xmath4 0.20 dex ) , thus demonstrating that even lmc - p did not originated in the cluster .",
    "this evidence could be used to put some constraints on the presence of old metal - poor @xmath0-enhanced stars in the sampled lmc disk field , which turns out to be less then @xmath1 1@xmath2 .",
    "our outcome provides a substantial confirmation of the results by @xcite , who found @xmath1 3@xmath2 of their sample with [ fe / h ] @xmath3 1.5 dex ( but no measurements of [ @xmath0/fe ] ratio are available ) and by @xcite , who found @xmath1 2@xmath2 , although the abundance patterns are incompatible with old lmc gcs .",
    "since these samples cover different regions of the galaxy , the measured similar fraction of metal - poor stars in these three samples seems to suggest that the old , metal - poor component is distributed in a quite homogeneous way along the lmc disk .",
    "( 2 )  after the initial burst , the lmc has undergone a long period characterized by a continuous sf with low efficiency .",
    "the occurence of this quiescent period in the lmc field is clearly visible in the sfh provided by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , where a prolonged phase with very low or lacking sf is appreciable between @xmath1 4 - 5 gyr and @xmath1 12 gyr ago .",
    "this quiescent period is predicted also by the theoretical models proposed by @xcite that derived a typical sf efficiency in this age range of @xmath1 0.1 m@xmath37 yr@xmath13 .    during this period ,",
    "the lmc evolved in isolation , without gravitational interactions with the galaxy and the smc @xcite .",
    "lmc - p likely formed during this period , as also suggested by the lower ( by @xmath1 0.20.3 dex ) [ @xmath0/fe ] ratio with respect to the galactic values at similar metallicity , which indicate that during this long period mainly sneia contribute to the gas enrichment .",
    "if this scenario is correct , these stars were born during the period in which no gc formed ( the so - called _ age gap _ , @xcite ) , hence they are unique tracers of the lmc chemical evolution history between @xmath1 12 and 3 gyr ago .",
    "we also notice that the lmc - p fraction ( @xmath1 16@xmath2 ) is larger than that ( @xmath4 10@xmath2 ) found by @xcite .",
    "this is probably due to different location of the two fields .",
    "the sample analysed by @xcite is located around the central bar ( at variance with our targets , located in the inner disk at @xmath1 1.8 kpc from the lmc center ) .",
    "infact , @xcite suggest that the central bar formed in the last 34 gyr with a marginal fraction of metal - poor stars in its stellar content .",
    "also , it is interesting to notice that the [ @xmath0/fe ] ratio of this stellar component well resembles the mean locus defined by the dsph stars ( grey triangles in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ alpha ] , but see also fig.11 in @xcite ) , suggesting similar chemical enrichment histories .",
    "( 3 )  lmc - r formed during the relevant burst of sf occurred in the last few gyr probably due to the tidal capture of the smc by the lmc .",
    "numerical simulations @xcite predict that first close encounter between the two clouds occurred @xmath1 34 gyr ago , when the lmc and smc become a gravitational bound system .",
    "this strong interaction triggered the sfr up to @xmath1 0.4 m@xmath37 yr@xmath13 .",
    "the occurrence of this sf enhancement has been confirmed by @xcite by using color - magnitude diagrams of different regions of the lmc .",
    "however , the binary system status of magellanic clouds and its timescales is still a matter of debate since there is no unambiguous consensus between dynamical simulation and photometric studies .",
    "for instance , @xcite analysed new photometric dataset from the vista magellanic survey , finding an enhancement of star formation with a peak at @xmath1 2 gyr and in some regions a second peak at @xmath1 5 gyr and interpreted as the epoch of tidal interaction between the lmc and the galaxy .",
    "conversely , @xcite suggested that the lmc - smc system is on its first close passage about the galaxy , being entered in the milky way virial radius only in the last 1 - 3 gyr .",
    "lmc - r distribution is very narrow ( @xmath33}$]=  0.13 dex ) , suggesting that the episode of sf associated to the first close encounter between the two clouds has been very efficient ( in order to produce the majority of the lmc disk stars ) and fast , because the stars have not had time to furtherly enrich in iron .",
    "these stars show [ @xmath0/fe ] abundance ratios that are close to the solar value , in nice agreement with the values measured in the intermediate - age gcs @xcite with age of 13 gyr , as shown in figure  [ alpha ] .",
    "the observed [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios agree with those derived in the sagittarius dsph giants ( asterisks in lower panel of fig .",
    "[ alpha ] ) , while the nearby dsphs studied so far do not reach such metallicity . the most metal - rich stars discussed by @xcite in fornax show [ fe / h]@xmath10.6 dex , consistent with the metal - poor edge of the lmc - r population .",
    "these evidences ( the similarity with sgr and the difference with the nearby dsphs ) seem to confirm that the recent sfh of the lmc has been quite complex and turbulent , and the stars of the lmc - r population ( that dominates the metallicity distribution of our sample ) are the products of the tidal interactions occurring among lmc , smc and our galaxy .",
    "the intrinsic dispersion of each individual abundance ratio of the lmc - r population suggests a high degree of homogeneity , pointing out that an efficient and homogeneous mixing of the sn ejecta occurs .",
    "we note that the dispersion of the [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios in these stars is larger than the range of values covered by the intermediate - age gcs .",
    "thus , the scatter in [ @xmath0/fe ] abundances of the lmc - r stars reflects the larger age range in which these stars formed .",
    "however , we find a general agree between the values observed in the field and gc stars in this metallicity range , suggesting in any case a common origin of these stars from similar burst of sf .",
    "it is important to recall that there is an offset between the age of the onset of the sf in the lmc field and that of the gc formation .",
    "in fact , if the sf in the field started about 4 - 5 gyr ago ( the precise age depends on the location in the disk and the magnitude of the tidal interactions with the smc ) , the gc formation restarts about 2 gyr ago , as suggested also by @xcite .",
    "this difference is confirmed by the measured ages in the intermediate - ages gcs ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the lack of globulars in the age range between 2 and 5 gyr .",
    "furthermore , the lower metallicity edge of lmc - r stars ( [ fe / h ] @xmath38 0.7 dex ) , if compared to that of gcs , seems to support that the sf of field stars becomes efficient slightly before .",
    "recently , @xcite discussed the unusual low [ mg / fe ] ( 0.9 dex ) ratio measured by @xcite in the intermediate - age , metal - rich gc ngc  1718 , suggesting that this cluster and a fraction of lmc field stars were formed from the metal - poor gas acquired by infall from the smc about 1 - 2 gyr ago ( the so - called _ magellanic squall _ , @xcite ) . in our sample",
    "we did not detect metal - rich stars characterized by such low mg or @xmath0-depletion , pointing out that the stars formed from metal - poor gas accreted by the smc are ( if any ) a negligible ( @xmath31@xmath2 ) fraction of the lmc disk .",
