    "observations of pulsar signals provide a valuable tool for investigating electron density distribution in the interstellar medium .",
    "the pulsar intrinsic signal is narrow in time , being about few percent of the pulsar period .",
    "the observed signal ( averaged over many periods of pulsation ) is broad and asymmetric with a sharp rise and a slow decay .",
    "the pulse broadening is attributed to the random refraction the waves experience while propagating in the interstellar medium .",
    "the shapes of the signals , and their scalings with wavelength  @xmath0 and with the pulsar distance have been investigated observationally and analytically for 30 years .",
    "the standard theory of interstellar scintillations ( described in detail below ) assumes that the propagating wave is refracted by random gaussian gradients , thought to be a good approximation due to the central limit theorem  @xcite . the symmetric gaussian distribution is fully characterized by its second moment , and the standard theory of scintillations aimed at reconstructing this moment from observations .",
    "the contradictions of this theory with observations were noted in the early 1970 s , although not many pulsars were investigated at that time to make a definitive conclusion .",
    "the signal shape is characterized by its time - width ,  @xmath1 , estimated at the @xmath2 level . in 1971 ,",
    "sutton analyzed scalings of pulse broadening times , @xmath1 , with the radio wavelength ,  @xmath0 , and with dispersion measures , @xmath3 , corresponding to the pulsar s distance along the line of sight , @xmath4 .",
    "observational scaling for large dispersion measures , @xmath5 , is close to @xmath6 , while the theory gave @xmath7 . the recent observational results are shown in fig .",
    "( [ elbow ] ) . to overcome the difficulty with the anomalous dm - scaling , sutton suggested that the interstellar turbulence was not statistically uniform along the lines of sight , so that the lines of sight for more distant pulsars intersected regions with stronger turbulence .",
    "the second paradox was encountered by @xcite , who compared the observed shapes of the pulses with the shapes predicted by the standard theory .",
    "he obtained a surprising result that the model of continuous turbulent medium was not consistent with observations .",
    "rather , the best agreement was given by the models where all the scattering material was concentrated either in a thin screen or in a slab covering only @xmath8 of the line of sight between the pulsar and the earth , with nearly equal quality of fit to the data [ see the discussion and fig .  4 in @xcite ] .",
    "these two assumptions that are necessary to reconcile the standard theory with the observations may have physical grounds since the interstellar medium is not uniform and denser regions ( with stronger turbulence ) are encountered closer to the galactic center . however , in this paper we discuss a simple and perhaps more plausible physical explanation for the sutton and williamson paradoxes . according to this explanation ,",
    "the sutton and williamson paradoxes are not the consequence of the non - uniform , large - scale galactic distribution of the electron density responsible for scattering .",
    "rather , they reflect the universal properties of the microscopic structures of the density fluctuations .      in our recent work",
    "@xcite we proposed that the sutton paradox is the evidence of statistically uniform but _ non - gaussian _ electron distribution in the interstellar medium .",
    "we noted that the time - broadened pulses belong to those observational objects that depend not on the moments of the electron - density distribution function , but on its full shape .",
    "the standard gaussian approach did not recognize this fact because in the gaussian case , knowledge of the second moment is equivalent to knowing the distribution function itself .",
    "however , for a general non - gaussian electron - density distribution the second moment may formally diverge , and the electron - density correlation function may not characterize the pulse shape .    physically , this divergence means that the second moment of ray - angle deviation is dominated not by the bulk of its distribution function , but by the extremely far cut - offs at the tails of this function [ as we will see in the example of section  [ boundaries ] ] .",
    "in contrast , the observed signal shape is determined by the bulk of the distribution function and is not sensitive to its far - tail cut - offs . in other words , the electron - density correlation function and the shape of the observed pulsar signal",
    "provide different , complementary descriptions of the electron distribution in the ism .",
    "we also note that in the lvy model , the pulse shapes may provide a unique opportunity to diagnose plasma fluctuations at very small scales , @xmath9  cm . these scales can be smaller than the coulomb mean - free path in hii regions , and can be close to the ion gyro radius",
    ". observations of pulse shapes may thus provide diagnostics for magnetized plasma fluctuations , which may help to elucidate the role of magnetic fields in interstellar turbulence , see also  @xcite .    in the theory of scintillation",
    ", the quantity of interest is the transverse electron - density difference , averaged along the line of sight , @xmath10 $ ] .",
    "a wave propagating in the interstellar medium is scattered ( refracted ) by density inhomogeneities , and the statistics of the refraction angle is related to the statistics of density differences across the line of sight .    in the approach proposed in  @xcite we assumed that the distribution function of  @xmath11 was stationary and uniform , but non - gaussian , and it had a power - law decay as @xmath12 .",
    "if this distribution does not have a second moment , then the sum of many density differences along the line of sight does not have the gaussian distribution , i.e. the central limit theorem does not hold .",
    "instead , the limiting distribution , if it exists , must be the so - called lvy distribution , which is common in various random systems  @xcite . by construction ,",
    "such a distribution is stable under convolution , i.e. the appropriately rescaled sum of two independent variables drawn from the same lvy distribution , has again the lvy distribution . the gaussian distribution is a particular case of this more general stable distribution .    the fourier transform ( the characteristic function ) of an isotropic lvy probability density function , @xmath13 , has the simple form , @xmath14 where the lvy index @xmath15 is a free parameter , @xmath16 .",
    "this form is valid for an arbitrary dimensionality of the fluctuating vector  @xmath17 .",
    "as we explain below , in our case this vector is two - dimensional , @xmath18 $ ] , where @xmath19 is the coordinate in the plane perpendicular to the line of sight , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 is the unit vector in the direction connecting the two points in this plane , @xmath22 , where @xmath23 .    equation  ( [ levy ] ) can be taken as the definition of the _ isotropic _ lvy distribution , and in the present paper we will consider only isotropic distributions .",
    "however , it is important to note that a stable distribution need not be isotropic [ see , e.g. ,  @xcite ] . in the simplest case ,",
    "the anisotropic distribution is a copy of the isotropic distribution , rescaled along one axis ; but far less symmetric lvy distributions are possible .",
    "non - isotropic stable distributions might arise in the case of the magnetized interstellar medium , when wave scattering has one or several preferred directions .",
    "for example , anisotropic scattering may be characteristic of interstellar mhd turbulence , as described by  @xcite , where the preferred direction is given by the large - scale magnetic field .",
    "the sum of @xmath24 lvy distributed variables scales as @xmath25 , which becomes diffusion in the gaussian limit @xmath26 . for @xmath27 ,",
    "the probability distribution function has algebraic tails , @xmath28 , for large @xmath29 , and its moments , @xmath30 , of the order @xmath31 diverge . in @xcite",
    ", we considered smooth density fluctuations , @xmath32 , and the proposed lvy statistics of ray - angle deviation lead to the pulse - broadening scaling @xmath33 .",
    "this agrees with observations when @xmath34 , and provides a natural resolution to the sutton paradox .      in this paper",
    "we consider scintillations produced by a general , non - smooth density fluctuations , @xmath35 .",
    "more precisely , exponent @xmath36 denotes the scaling of the density - difference pdf defined in formula  ( [ levy ] ) , i.e. this pdf should have the form @xmath37 . in the non - smooth case , the effective lvy index that enters the expressions for angle deviations is different from @xmath15 , and",
    "is given by @xmath38 , as is explained in formulae  ( [ levyscreen ] ) and  ( [ tau ] ) below .    as we noted above , in the lvy case the electron - density correlation function ( or second order structure function )",
    "is contributed to by the far - tail cut - off of the electron - difference distribution function .",
    "we will denote the correlation - function scaling as @xmath39 , where the scaling exponent , @xmath40 , is in general different and independent of the lvy distribution scaling exponents @xmath36 and @xmath15 .",
    "the exponent @xmath40 is related to the fourier spectrum of electron density fluctuations , @xmath41 .    in the present paper",
    "we demonstrate that the proposed lvy statistics of ray - angle deviations provide a resolution for the williamson paradox as well . for this purpose",
    "we , first , develop a theory of wave propagation in a lvy random medium by approximating the medium by a uniform series of scattering screens . then , we provide a general method for constructing the pulse - broadening function for an arbitrary lvy index  @xmath42 . and finally , we compare our results with the observational signals of large - dispersion - measure pulsars , recently published by  @xcite and by @xcite .",
    "we obtain that the observational shapes agree well with the predictions of our theory for a uniform medium with the lvy index @xmath43 to  @xmath44 , while they are inconsistent with the gaussian theory corresponding to the lvy index  @xmath45 .",
    "we also discuss the effect of `` over - scattering '' which is inherent for the lvy scintillations , because the time - signals have long algebraic tails that do not decay to zero during pulse periods .",
    "this effect is crucial for comparing analytical and observational data , as we show in section  [ observation ] .    for illustrative purposes",
    ", we also present a particular model of the density distribution that produces the lvy statistics of scintillations .",
    "the proposed density distribution is strongly spatially intermittent , and it can be visualized as follows .",
    "imagine that the electron density is concentrated in separated regions that have sharp irregular boundaries .",
    "we make the simplest assumption that these boundaries are random , similar to randomly folded two - dimensional sheets or shocks .",
    "if one further assumes that the line of sight intersects the boundary at a random angle whose distribution is uniform in all directions , such a picture corresponds to the particular case of a lvy distribution of @xmath46 , with @xmath47 , @xmath48 , the so - called cauchy distribution .",
    "this distribution is rather distinct from the gaussian one , and is close to the distribution that has been predicted in our theory .",
    "the importance of randomly oriented discontinuous objects that can be encountered across the line of sight has been emphasized in earlier theoretical work on scintillation , see e.g. , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "as noted by @xcite , sharp density discontinuities may characterize stellar wind boundaries , supernova shock fronts , boundaries of hii regions at the strmgren radius , etc .",
    "they may also arise from supersonic turbulent motion .",
    "@xcite proposed that similar highly intermittent density structures may be responsible for observed low - frequency modulations ( fringes ) of dynamic pulsar spectra .",
    "the approach of @xcite utilized the non - kolmogorov spectra of discontinuous density fluctuations .",
    "@xcite considered wave scattering by confined or heavily modulated screens ( such as disks , filaments , etc . ) , when the statistics of angular deviations were generally assumed gaussian , with parameters varying along the screens .",
    "both papers discussed important aspects of non - kolmogorov and spatially intermittent electron - density distribution in the ism , however , they implied the existence of the second moments of the scattering - angle distributions . therefore , in the earlier considerations , the effects that we discuss in the present paper could not be discovered .    as we demonstrate in section  [ boundaries ] , sharp density discontinuities can , in fact , produce a non - gaussian distribution of the scattering angle , whose second moment diverges . in our approach",
    "we exploit such intermittent density statistics in their full generality . to elucidate the universal role of lvy distribution , we keep our consideration as simple as possible , assuming statistically uniform and isotropic scattering screens ( although generalizations for the non - isotropic and non - uniform cases are possible ) .",
    "the presence of strongly - scattering structures is naturally represented in our model by slowly decaying , power - law tails of the scattering - angle distributions .",
    "our model has a simple physical interpretation and provides a practical way of calculating pulse shapes and pulse scalings .",
    "most importantly , it naturally resolves both the sutton and the williamson observational paradoxes , in a manner that is simpler and complementary to the standard gaussian picture .",
    "the lvy - flight model may also be relevant to observations of extreme scattering events , such as those reported by @xcite .",
    "such events have been investigated theoretically , as by  @xcite .",
    "we note that these theoretical studies invoke uncommon incidents of scattering much larger than typical values to explain these events . in this sense , these events are consistent with the lvy model we develop here , which includes rare , large events in a statistically - stationary way .",
    "however , we do not yet know whether these phenomena might fit into a single model for interstellar scattering along with the common phenomena we discuss in this work .",
    "the answer might possibly depend on the details of the picture for turbulence in which the lvy model is realized .",
    "accordingly , we do not discuss the extreme scattering events in the present work .",
    "to address the puzzles mentioned above we need to review the standard theory of interstellar scintillations .",
    "first , we note that in the interstellar plasma with typical electron density @xmath49 , the electron plasma frequency is @xmath50 .",
    "this frequency is much smaller than the typical observational frequency of @xmath51 , and , therefore , the propagating wave scatters only by a small angle on the scale of density inhomogeneities .",
    "the fourier amplitude of electric field , @xmath52 , obeys the following equation : @xmath53 see , e.g. ,  @xcite .",
    "we are not interested in polarization effects that are small in the considered approximation by a factor @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the electron - cyclotron frequency , therefore , we consider the scalar wave amplitude ,  @xmath56 . equation ( [ waveeq ] ) can be reduced further , using the so - called parabolic approximation  @xcite . assuming that the wave propagates in the line - of - sight direction , @xmath20 , we can separate the quickly changing phase of the wave from the slowly changing wave amplitude , @xmath57 , where @xmath19 is a coordinate perpendicular to  @xmath20 .",
    "the equation for the wave amplitude @xmath58 reads : @xmath59\\phi_{\\omega}(z,{\\bf x})=0 , \\label{paraboliceq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath60 is a two - dimensional laplacian in the * x * plane , and @xmath61 is the classical radius of the electron .",
    "following the approach of @xcite we introduce the two - point function @xmath62 , whose fourier transform with respect to time is @xmath63 . for coinciding coordinates , @xmath64 ,",
    "this function is the intensity of the radiation whose variation with time we seek . to find this function",
    "we need first to solve the equation for @xmath65 , which can be derived from eq .",
    "( [ paraboliceq ] ) . assuming that @xmath66",
    ", we obtain the following equation , @xmath67 where we denote @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 .",
    "equation ( [ vequation ] ) is hard to solve since @xmath71 is an unknown random function .",
    "the standard theory uses the fact that it takes many refraction events to appreciably deviate the ray trajectory , as we discussed in the introduction .",
    "therefore , due to the central limit theorem , the ray deviation angle exhibits a gaussian random walk .",
    "one can therefore assume that the density fluctuations are gaussian with the specified second - order correlator @xmath72 ^ 2 \\rangle   = 2 \\kappa({\\bf x}_1-{\\bf x}_2)\\delta(z_1-z_2)$ ] , where short correlation length in @xmath20 direction is the mathematical expression of the fact that the ray becomes appreciably deviated only when it travels the distance much larger than the the density correlation length  @xcite .",
    "the correlation function @xmath73 is the two - dimensional fourier transform of the spectrum of the density fluctuations .",
    "more precisely , if the three - dimensional spectrum of the density fluctuations is @xmath74 , then @xmath73 is the fourier transform of @xmath75 with respect to @xmath76 . when the density has a power - law spectrum , @xmath77 , with @xmath78 , then @xmath79 . as we mentioned in the introduction , the statistically uniform gaussian model fails to reproduce the observational scaling of the the broadening time , @xmath80 .",
    "numerous attempts to reproduce this scaling by using different spectra of density fluctuations within this model have not been successful either .",
    "the purely shock - dominated density distribution has the spectrum @xmath81 , while the kolmogorov turbulence has the spectrum  @xmath82 ; the difference in the spectral exponents is rather small to have a considerable consequence .",
    "for various important aspects of the standard gaussian scintillation theory we refer the reader to  @xcite .",
    "in other contexts , the theory of wave propagation in gaussian random media was developed in  @xcite .    in the next section",
    "we formulate the problem by assuming that the refraction occurs in a series of discrete structures , refracting ` screens ' , that are statistically identical , independent , and placed uniformly along the line of sight .",
    "this setting is physically appealing since , as we have mentioned in the introduction , the refraction in the interstellar medium is consistent with the presence of spatially intermittent scattering structures , see e.g. ,  @xcite .",
    "moreover , this is the simplest setting when the problem admits an exact analytic solution that allows us to treat both gaussian and lvy cases on the same footing .",
    "let us assume that wave scattering occurs in a series of thin flat screens uniformly placed along the line of sight .",
    "also , for simplicity assume that the incident wave is planar , although an analogous consideration can be made for spherical geometry as well .",
    "each screen gives a contribution to the signal phase ; if we denote the wave function just before the screen by @xmath83 , then the wave function right after the screen will be given by @xmath84 .",
    "the phase function , @xmath85 , can be found from eq .",

    "( [ vequation ] ) in this region , @xmath89    in what follows we will be interested in the wave function , @xmath90 , averaged over different realizations of the electron density in the phase screens . due to space homogeneity ,",
    "the averaged transfer function , @xmath91 , should depend only on the coordinate difference @xmath92 .",
    "since refraction affects only the @xmath92  dependence of the wave function , we can assume that the averaged wave function is independent of @xmath19 , @xmath93 .",
    "taking into account the @xmath19  dependence would lead to more cumbersome formulas , although it would not qualitatively change the results .",
    "we therefore model the free propagation between the screens by @xmath94    to describe the scattering we need to specify the averaged phase function ,  @xmath95 . in the gaussian case",
    ", one can assume that the screen width , @xmath87 , is of the order of the characteristic length of the density fluctuations , @xmath96 , and therefore is not necessary .",
    "the only assumption required for our consideration is @xmath97 , and the final results can be generalized for this case .",
    "this generalization would however require further assumptions about the scattering structures , which at the present level of understanding can hardly be justified .",
    "] , @xmath98 , \\label{gaussianscreen}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath99 .",
    "assuming that the main contribution to the scattering comes from the scales ,  @xmath100 , much smaller than the density correlation length , we can expand @xmath101 , where @xmath102 , and @xmath103 is a typical amplitude ( say , rms value ) of density fluctuations .",
    "for example , if density fluctuations arise due to passive advection by the kolmogorov turbulence , then @xmath104 .",
    "the smooth density field corresponds to @xmath47 .",
    "the situation is completely different in the lvy case , when the second - order moment of the density integral in  ( [ freeequation ] ) diverges .",
    "we however can assume that the density difference has some scaling form , @xmath105dz   \\sim l_0 \\delta n_0 ( y / l_0)^{\\alpha/2}$ ] , and use the lvy formula  ( [ levy ] ) to write the most general expression for the averaged phase function  @xmath95 , @xmath106 in the gaussian limit , @xmath26 , this formula reduces to the previous result ( [ gaussianscreen ] ) .",
    "similar to the gaussian case , the exponent @xmath107 has the meaning of the density - difference scaling with the point separation , however , it characterizes not the second moment ( that does not exist ) , but the density - difference distribution function itself .",
    "more precisely , for a chosen point separation @xmath92 , the projected density difference in the screen function ( [ screen ] ) , @xmath108=\\lambda r_0 \\delta n_{\\perp } ,   \\label{deltaphi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] should be drawn from a distribution function that depends only on the combination @xmath109 .",
    "we also note that contrary to the gaussian case , the quantity @xmath103 entering equation  ( [ levyscreen ] ) , does not correspond to the rms value of density fluctuations , since @xmath110 does not exist in the lvy case .",
    "rather , it denotes the typical width of the density - difference pdf , say the density difference at which this pdf decays by the factor @xmath2 compared to its maximum value . on the contrary",
    ", the rms value of @xmath11 would be given by far , non - lvy tails of this pdf , and would be much larger than  @xmath103 .    physically , the lvy screen function in the form ( [ levyscreen ] ) could correspond to the distribution of the phase integral , @xmath111 , when the integration path intersects a random density discontinuity , say a sharp boundary of an ionized region .",
    "such a random boundary may naturally arise as a result of turbulent advection in an ionized region , and numerical simulations could test this intriguing possibility .",
    "our suggestion is based on a result that a smooth , randomly oriented boundary reproduces the particular form of the lvy screen function ( [ levyscreen ] ) corresponding to @xmath48 , @xmath47 .",
    "we will derive this result in the next section .",
    "in general , particular values of @xmath36 and @xmath15 depend on the physical realization of scattering screens , which is not completely understood and can not be specified in this work . for our present purposes , we simply assume the general form of the screen function ( [ levyscreen ] ) and provide a method for calculating the shape and the scaling of the received signal .",
    "let us consider a series of such screens placed along the line of sight , @xmath20 , perpendicular to it , such that the distance between two adjacent screens is @xmath112 .",
    "number the screens from the source to the observer , and consider the @xmath113th screen .",
    "denote as @xmath114 the wave function just before the wave passes the screen , and @xmath115 this function just after the screen . between the screens @xmath116 and @xmath113 , the propagation is free ,",
    "therefore , we obtain from equations ( [ vequation ] ) and  ( [ freeequation1 ] ) , @xmath117 we can write the wave function after the wave has passed @xmath24 screens , by iterating this formula @xmath24 times , and by using the expression for the screen function , ( [ levyscreen ] ) , @xmath118^{-n } \\int \\exp\\left([ia\\delta k]^{-1 } \\sum\\limits_{m=1}^{n}(\\delta { \\bf y}_m)^2   -b^{\\alpha \\beta/2}\\sum\\limits_{m=1}^{n-1 } \\vert y_{m } \\vert^{\\alpha\\beta/2 } \\right)\\times \\nonumber \\\\ & u_{0}(y_{0})\\ ,   d^2y_{n-1 } , \\dots , d^2y_1\\,d^2y_{0 } \\label{unscreens}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we introduced the short - hand notation : @xmath119 , @xmath120 , and @xmath121 .",
    "to do the integrals , we need first to make a simple transformation of formula  ( [ unscreens ] ) .",
    "we will substitute the following identity , @xmath122= -i\\pi a\\delta k \\int \\exp\\left(i\\bxi_m\\cdot   \\delta { \\bf y}_m - i a \\delta k \\xi_m^2\\right)d^2\\xi_m ,   \\label{identity}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for each @xmath123 , into formula  ( [ unscreens ] ) . our ultimate goal is to find the time dependence of the pulse intensity at the @xmath24th screen , i.e. , @xmath124 .",
    "we therefore change the order of integration and do the @xmath125-integral first . as the result",
    "we get : @xmath126 introducing the non - dimensional variables @xmath127 and @xmath128 , we rewrite formula ( [ intensity ] ) as follows : @xmath129 in the rest of this section we will use only the non - dimensional variables , and will omit the tilde signs .",
    "now we are ready to do the @xmath100-part of the integral .",
    "for this we make a simple rearrangement in the sum @xmath130 . recalling that @xmath131 should be set to zero , we are left with @xmath132 , where @xmath133 . to complete the @xmath100-integration",

    "the last step is to note that @xmath138 , which allows us to give a simple interpretation to formula  ( [ levyintensity ] ) .    before discussing this interpretation ,",
    "we note the quantum mechanical analogy of our approach .",
    "if we could assume that @xmath139 , and @xmath140 in the limit when the number of screens increases , @xmath141 , but the line - of - sight length is constant ( which would be natural for the gaussian case ) , the integral that we calculated in ( [ unscreens ] ) would formally become the feynman - kac path integral for the solution of the schrdinger equation with the potential  @xmath142 .",
    "the transition from ( [ unscreens ] ) to ( [ levyintensity ] ) given by formula  ( [ identity ] ) is the transition from the coordinate to the momentum representation of this integral .",
    "naturally , in the gaussian case one can find the shape of  @xmath143 either by doing the multiple integral in  ( [ levyintensity ] ) or by solving the corresponding schrdinger equation .",
    "the first approach was essentially adapted in @xcite , the second one in @xcite . in our lvy model",

    "although the general integral ( [ unscreens ] ) is quite complicated , the quantity of interest , @xmath143 , which is calculated with the aid of this integral , has a quite simple meaning , and its probabilistic interpretation  ( [ levyintensity ] ) can be easily understood .",
    "the @xmath40-function in formula ( [ levyintensity ] ) means that the signal intensity @xmath143 is the probability density function of the time delay , @xmath145 .",
    "the variable @xmath146 is proportional to the deviation angle of the ray path from the @xmath20-axis , @xmath147 .",
    "[ this is clear from  ( [ identity ] ) since @xmath148 , and this will also be the case in the geometric - optics analysis of section  [ boundaries ] . ]",

    "formula  ( [ levyintensity ] ) teaches us that each angle increment , @xmath151 , has a lvy distribution with the index @xmath38 , which provides a practical way of constructing the pulse broadening function  @xmath143 without doing the multiple integrals in  ( [ levyintensity ] ) .",
    "this is a monte - carlo - type method for multiple integration . indeed , to find the effect caused by the interstellar medium",

    ", we derive @xmath155 , where the number of screens is proportional to the distance to the pulsar , @xmath156 . the observational scaling , @xmath6 ,",
    "is reproduced for @xmath157 , and @xmath158 , which shows that ray - deviating density fluctuations do not have a gaussian distribution but rather a lvy distribution with the index @xmath159 .",
    "this is the important result of the lvy model of scintillations , and it resolves the sutton paradox .    in the section  [ observation ] , we will demonstrate that the williamson paradox is resolved naturally in the lvy picture of scintillations as well .",
    "but before that , in the next section we would like to present a physical model of scintillations that can be easily visualized and that demonstrates the essence of our approach .",
    "the intensity function @xmath143 can be calculated for the phase - screen function ( [ levyscreen ] ) , once the parameters @xmath36 and @xmath15 have been specified from the physics of the problem . as an important example ,",
    "let us consider a particular case of lvy phase screens , which we shall call cauchy screens , when the values of these parameters can be derived directly .",
    "let us assume that the interstellar medium is filled with separated ionized regions such that all of them have the same electron - density contrast with the ambient medium ,  @xmath103 .",
    "we also assume that these regions are randomly shaped and have sharp boundaries .",
    "a propagating ray is then refracted by these random boundaries due to the snell s law , @xmath160 , where @xmath161 is the angle between the ray and the normal to the boundary , and @xmath162 is the refraction index . as we explained in the introduction ,",
    "the interstellar parameters ensure that @xmath163 , and each refraction event results in a very small angle deviation , @xmath164 .",
    "expanding @xmath165 through the first order in @xmath166 , we get from the snell s law @xmath167 where @xmath168 .",
    "the distribution of @xmath169 can be found assuming ( somewhat artificially ) that the boundary normal is uniformly distributed over all directions in a half - space , at the point where it intersects the line of sight .",
    "denote @xmath170 , where  @xmath171 is a unit vector indicating the direction of the refraction in the plane perpendicular to the ray propagation .",
    "then the distribution of  @xmath172 is given in the polar coordinates by : @xmath173 quite remarkably , this distribution is the two - dimensional lvy distribution with the index @xmath48 , also known as the cauchy distribution .",
    "its fourier transform follows from formula  ( [ levy ] ) , @xmath174 , we leave the derivation of this result to the reader as an instructive exercise .    to apply this result we need to calculate the screen function  ( [ screen ] ) .",
    "it can be done if we note that for the plane - like density discontinuity , the screen phase  ( [ deltaphi ] ) is easily calculated , @xmath175= \\lambda r_0 \\delta n_0   \\ , ( \\bsigma\\cdot { \\bf y})$ ] .",
    "since @xmath176 has the cauchy distribution  ( [ cauchy ] ) , the averaged screen function can be found with the aid of formula  ( [ levy ] ) , @xmath177 and we recover formula ( [ levyscreen ] ) with @xmath178 , and with @xmath47 , @xmath48 ; the parameters are close to those that we have proposed for the interstellar scintillation on the observational grounds , i.e. , @xmath157 , @xmath34 .",
    "we expect that the observational scaling @xmath34 would correspond to more complicated , realistic structure of the boundaries , possibly , with the fractal dimension larger than  2 .",
    "interstellar turbulence can indeed corrugate two - dimensional structures to make them have higher - than - two fractal dimensions , as is seen in numerical results and in observations of molecular clouds  @xcite ; see also @xcite .",
    "we expect this effect to have implications for interstellar scintillations , and we plan to consider it in the future work .    an attentive reader has probably noticed that eq .",
    "( [ theta ] ) for the angle deviation can not be valid for the arbitrarily large @xmath169 . indeed , the refraction angle @xmath179 can not exceed the critical angle , given by @xmath180 , which is obtained when @xmath181 , where we assume @xmath182 . to obtain the general formula for the angle deviation we need to expand @xmath183 in the snell s law up to the second order in @xmath166 , which gives @xmath184.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "the distribution of @xmath185 thus has a cut - off at @xmath186 .",
    "for example , if the electron density fluctuations are @xmath187 , we have @xmath188 , which implies that formula  ( [ theta ] ) holds in the broad range of scales .",
    "indeed , the distribution of @xmath189 follows the cauchy law  ( [ cauchy ] ) , therefore the distribution function of  @xmath166 is strongly peaked at small  @xmath166 .",
    "this function has a maximum at @xmath190 , and a long asymptotic power - law tail , @xmath191 , that spans about six orders of magnitude before it reaches the cut - off at @xmath192 .",
    "this consideration provides an illustration to the main idea of our approach .",
    "the second moment of the distribution of  @xmath166 depends not on the shape of the distribution function  ( [ cauchy ] ) , but on the cut - off value of its asymptotic power - law tail ,  @xmath193 . on the contrary , the shape of the pulsar signal is determined by the full shape of the distribution function  ( [ cauchy ] ) , and is practically independent of the large cut - off value  @xmath193 .",
    "in fig .  ( [ levy_cauchy ] )",
    "we present the pulse - broadening function , @xmath194 which is the distribution function of the time delay , @xmath1 , given by formula  ( [ tau ] ) , for the standard gaussian model , @xmath195 , for the lvy - cauchy model , @xmath196 , and for the lvy model with @xmath47 , @xmath197 .",
    "note that , in comparison with the pulse through a gaussian medium , the lvy models predict relatively greater intensity at short delays from the arrival time for the original pulse , as well as power - law tails at long delays .",
    "these tails result from rare , large occurrences of scattering .",
    "we generated the two - dimensional isotropic lvy distribution of @xmath198 using the methods of  @xcite .",
    "let @xmath199 be a gaussian random vector , i.e. both components @xmath200 and @xmath201 are independent , identically distributed , one - dimensional gaussian variables .",

    "this variable can be numerically generated using the method by  @xcite , see also  @xcite .",
    "then the variable @xmath204 has an isotropic two - dimensional lvy distribution with the index  @xmath42 ; the proof can be found , e.g. , in  @xcite . to generate an anisotropic lvy distribution with uniform index @xmath42 ( as may be relevant for the magnetized interstellar medium ) one may choose an anisotropic gaussian vector  * x * , and then proceed as above . in our present work",
    "we consider only isotropic distributions .",
    "we compared the predicted pulse shapes with the data recently published in  @xcite and in  @xcite .",
    "out of the 76 pulsars analyzed by @xcite , we considered those with broad signals , in order to minimize the intrinsic - pulse effects .",
    "good examples are provided by the four pulsars , p1849 + 0127 at 430 mhz ( dm=214.4 ) , j1852 + 0031 at 1175 mhz ( dm=680.0 ) , j1905 + 0709 at 430 mhz ( dm=269.0 ) , and p1916 + 0844 at 430 mhz ( dm=339.0 ) , where higher - frequency observations indicate that the intrinsic signal may be narrow .",
    "the dispersion measures are given in the units of @xmath205 .",
    "shapes of all of the pulses have a characteristic sharp rise and a narrow , pointed apex , which is inconsistent with the gaussian model , in exact agreement with the observations by  @xcite [ see fig .",
    "( 4 ) in williamson s paper ] . on the contrary",
    ", our lvy model provides a good fit to such shapes . for another similar comparison we used the pulse shape of j1848 - 0123 ( dm=159.1 ) observed at 327 mhz by  @xcite",
    "; and we present this comparison in figs .",
    "[ shapes2],[alpack ] as the illustrative example .",
    "when making the comparisons , we tried to match the central parts of the observational and analytical curves .",
    "however , this was possible only when we shifted the zero level of the analytical curves down , as is shown by the thin solid lines in fig .",
    "( [ shapes2 ] ) .",
    "this may be natural for `` over - scattered '' profiles , i.e. , when the signal has a long tail that does not approach zero during the pulse period .",
    "this is exactly the case for our lvy model . besides",
    ", other observational effects , including noise from the sky and the telescope itself , usually prevent one from determining the baseline unambiguously .",
    "we note that for a precise comparison , we must convolve the calculated pulse - broadening function with the narrow intrinsic shape of the pulse , and with the response function of the receiving system  @xcite .",
    "this will lead to slight broadening of the predicted pulse profile , making the gaussian model even less consistent with the observations .",
    "the effects of over - scattering on baseline have not been considered observationally .",
    "this effect is important for comparison of our theory with observations , and we plan to investigate it in future work .",
    "interferometry can distinguish between sky and telescope noise , and the overscattered tail of the pulse ; comparison of the correlated flux density at the peak of the pulse , and between pulses , thus provides a measure of the parameter @xmath42 in figures  [ levy_cauchy ] and  [ compare ] .",
    "we are proceeding with additional observational tests that can distinguish among models for scattering .",
    "as figures  [ levy_cauchy],[compare ] suggest , different values of @xmath42 yield different delays between the arrival time for the unscattered pulse and the peak of the pulse , as well as different behavior in the tail .",
    "observations at short wavelengths yield the arrival time for the unscattered pulse , with corrections for dispersion in the uniform interstellar plasma .",
    "thus , multi - frequency observations of pulse broadening , with timing information , can distinguish among the different models .",
    "shapes of scattered images provide another possible observational test of our theory .",
    "as equation  ( [ levyscreen ] ) suggests , the distribution of deflections of waves , at a given point , is drawn from a lvy distribution . because the lvy distribution is a stable attractor , iteration of the process yields a lvy distribution of directions , at any distance from the source .",
    "compared with a gaussian distribution of similar width , a lvy distribution has excesses at both large and small angles : it produces large deflections more commonly , and compensates with a large population with small deflection .",
    "thus , the scattered image for a lvy flight should have a halo at large angles , and a cusp at small angles , compared with a gaussian image .",
    "interestingly , observations of some heavily - scattered extragalactic sources show such core - halo excesses  @xcite . intrinsic structure of the source could possibly explain the observed halo structure ; but can not explain the relatively less - scattered cusp .",
    "in the present paper , we have investigated the observational pulse shape .",
    "another object directly related to the electron distribution function is the visibility function , @xmath206 , measured at the locations @xmath207 and @xmath208 at the earth .",
    "however , the electron fluctuations probed by this function are limited to small scales , @xmath209 cm , which can be comparable to the inner scale of the turbulence  @xcite where the statistics of the ism are different from the statistics responsible for pulse broadening .",
    "the visibility function can be easily constructed in our multi - screen model by solving eqs .",
    "( [ vequation],[freeequation ] ) for @xmath210 , however , we leave its analysis for future communication . here",
    ", we estimate what restrictions would be imposed on our theory by an inner scale of the order @xmath211 .    due to the formulas of section  [ multi - screen ] ,",
    "large - angle refraction is provided by small - scale fluctuations of electron density . in the case of lvy statistics , a sum of random variables can be dominated by a single term , therefore , from formula  ( [ tau ] ) we can estimate @xmath212 . from formula  ( [ intensity - non - dim ] ) , the electron - density fluctuations producing such an angle deviation should be strong at the scale @xmath213^{1/2}$ ] , or @xmath214 where we introduced the dispersion measure @xmath215 , and the signal frequency , @xmath216 .",
    "quite conveniently , formula ( [ yin ] ) includes only the quantities averaged along the line of sight , but not the particular parameters @xmath87 , @xmath96 , @xmath103 , and @xmath36 of the scattering screens .    as an example , let us consider the parameters for the large - dispersion - measure pulsar j1852 + 0031 ( dm=680.0 ) observed at 1175 mhz in @xcite . substituting @xmath217 , @xmath218 , @xmath219 , and assuming that @xmath220 , we obtain @xmath221 .",
    "therefore , the condition @xmath222 is marginally satisfied . due to the scaling @xmath6",
    ", smaller - dispersion - measure pulsars satisfy this condition even better . for the cases when this condition is violated ,",
    "a more appropriate description will be given by `` truncated '' lvy distributions , see e.g. ,  @xcite .",
    "in conclusion we would like to mention the observational correlation functions that are expressed through the higher - than - second moments of the wave amplitude , @xmath223 .",
    "these observational quantities require a special consideration that at present is not available to us .",
    "the examples of such quantities are given by the frequency correlation function that is used to characterize pulse broadening for @xmath224 , see , e.g. , @xcite , or by the intensity correlation functions that are used to characterize the density statistics on scales larger than the earth size @xcite .",
    "the scaling of such functions may be easily found in the gaussian theory when these functions can be related to the second - order moment , @xmath225 .",
    "however , the meaning of these correlation functions in the lvy case has yet to be determined .",
    "for instance , it seems possible that the deviation of the pulse - width scaling from @xmath226 for the lower part of the elbow diagram , in fig .",
    "( [ elbow ] ) , is due to the different method of reconstructing @xmath1 in this region .",
    "indeed , below @xmath227 , @xmath1 is not measured directly , but rather is defined as the inverse frequency decorrelation bandwidth  @xcite .    to summarize , in the present paper we proposed a multi - screen model of the uniform , non - gaussian interstellar medium , and we found its analytic solution .",
    "we demonstrate that this model explains both the shapes and the scalings of the observational pulse profiles , and it is free of the sutton and williamson paradoxes that could hardly be resolved in the standard gaussian theory of scintillations .",
    "also , we provided a physical model of density distribution having random discontinuities , which produces lvy scintillations and which may serve as a good approximation for the analysis of the observational data .",
    "we have demonstrated that the observational pulse shapes depend on the entire shape of the distribution of electron density , rather than simply on the second moment .",
    "pulse profiles may therefore serve as a valuable tool for reconstructing this function from observations , and we have developed the corresponding method in the present paper .",
    "we are very grateful to ramachandran rajagopalan for allowing us to use the observational results published in @xcite .",
    "we would like to thank john nolan for his valuable advice on the method of numerical generation of symmetric stable distributions , and fausto cattaneo , arieh knigl , and robert rosner for important discussions .",
    "s.b . would like to thank the aspen center for physics where a part of this work was done .",
