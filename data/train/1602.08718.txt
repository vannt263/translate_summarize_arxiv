    "system becomes a mormal conductor at high temperatures and tends to a superconductor phase when temperature decreases . *",
    "if we consider hee in constant temperature ( isothermal curves ) , we showed that there exists at least one lower temperature regime @xmath69 is almost compulsory for superconductivity .",
    "furthermore , we conclude that there is no `` confinement / deconfinemnet '' phase transition point in the @xmath29 . *",
    "if we fixed the relative chemical potential @xmath70 , we observe that by increasing temperature we have much more amount of hee .",
    "the slope of the hee @xmath71 decreases as the relative chemical potential @xmath72 decreases .",
    "we interpret this phenomena as emergent of more degrees of freedom ( dof ) at low temperature regimes . *",
    "both of the hee and the characterestic length of the entangled system are always increasing with respect to the temperature @xmath73 , and never decreasing for fixed @xmath74 .",
    "* hee is linear function of length .",
    "one reason is that in small values of belt angle ( small sizes ) the system emerges new extra dof .",

    ", we found the critical temperature @xmath77 .",
    "it was demonstrated that the system softly has transition from normal phase @xmath78 to the superconductor phase @xmath58 for @xmath79 .",
    "* we demonstrated that the slope of the hee with respect to the belt angle @xmath80 remains constant .",
    "it means that there is no critical belt length @xmath81 in our @xmath29 system .",
    "a numerical study of hee and length shows that these quantities were smooth , and that their behaviors went most smoothly when the phase transition held the same mechanism as the usual .",
    "when the temperature of the system @xmath73 rattends to its critical value @xmath74 , we detect a discontinuity in the @xmath82 when the phase is changed , and a first order phase transition may be introduced into the system . by computing",
    "the difference between @xmath82 for @xmath83 and @xmath84 at @xmath85 ( scaled the entropy in @xmath86 scale ) we observe that this phase transition is of the first order . indeed , at the critical point @xmath87 and we observe the first order phase transitions from the behavior of the entanglement entropy hee at the critical point @xmath88 .",
    "these types of first order phase transitions have been observed recently in literature @xcite .",
    "we conclude that the hee is indeed a good probe to phase transition in lower dimensional holographic superconductors .",
    "furthermore , it implies that the hee can indicate not only the occurrence of the phase transition , but also we can learn about the order of the phase transition from it .",
    "prior work has documented the effectiveness of holographic entanglement entropy in describing phase transition of quantum systems .",

    "@xcite for example , reports that holographic superconductors in two dimensional systems moving towards the phase transition in lower dimensional quantum field theory systems improved across several studies . however , these studies have either been purely bulk studies or have not focused on thermodynamic whose entanglement entropy was boundary - related . in this study we showed that entanglement entropy predicts a first order phase transition in two dimensional holographic superconductors .",
