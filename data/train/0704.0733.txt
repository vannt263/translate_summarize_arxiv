    "exploring different geometries of potentials trapping cold condensed atoms is of both fundamental and practical importance .",
    "toroidal traps play a special role allowing for `` infinite '' atomic trajectories and for realization of quasi - one - dimensional ( quasi-1d ) regimes .",
    "these advantages are relevant for designing highly precise sensors based on matter wave interferometry  @xcite as well as for accurate study of such phenomena as superfluid currents , stability of sound waves , solitons and vortices in bose - einstein condensates ( bec s )  @xcite .",
    "traps with circular geometry are also believed to be conceptually important for implementation of the main ideas of the accelerator physics at ultra - low temperatures  @xcite and , in particular , for acceleration of ultracold atoms  @xcite . in this last context existence of well localized wave packets , and thus attenuation of the dispersion ,",
    "the latter being the intrinsic property of a quantum systems , is of primary importance . in the first experimental studies",
    "@xcite it was shown that the dispersive spreading out  @xcite can be compensated by using betatron resonances in a storage ring .",
    "an alternative way of contra - balancing dispersion is also well known - it is nonlinearity , leading in quasi-1d regime to existence of bright and dark matter solitons ( see e.g.  @xcite and @xcite , respectively ) .",
    "this issue has already been explored  @xcite from the point of view of acceleration of matter waves in a toroidal trap with help of a modulated optical lattice , which is known to be an efficient tool for acceleration of matter waves  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we propose two alternative ways of accelerating matter wave solitons  either by time varying or by stochastic external electric field .",
    "these new ways of soliton acceleration are especially relevant in view of radiative losses  @xcite and distortions  @xcite of solitons moving in optical lattices ( the effects acquiring significance for long trajectories ) . at the same time , it turns out that the toroidal geometry of a trap confining a bec allows one to realize a number of other dynamical regimes , like dynamical localization of solitons and solitonic implementation of the celebrated kapitza pendulum .",
    "theoretical description of all mentioned phenomena can be put witching the unique framework , based on the perturbation theory for solitons , what is done in the present paper .",
    "more specifically , in sec .  [",
    "sec : scaling ] we formulate the model and the main physical constraints determining its validity . in sections  [ sec :",
    "dyn_accel ] and  [ sec : stoch_accel ] we describe how by applying external time - dependent electric field matter solitons can be accelerated in the usual sense and in the sense of the time increase of the velocity variance ( the stochastic acceleration ) , respectively . in sec .",
    "[ sec : dyn_loc ] we describe localized states of the matter in circular trap subject to external field , and in sec .",
    "[ kapitza ] we show that a matter soliton affected by rapidly varying force represents an example of the kapitza pendulum  @xcite .",
    "summary and discussion of the results are given in the conclusion .",
    "we assume that a bec is loaded in a circular trap , which in cylindrical coordinates @xmath0 is described by @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the frequency of the magnetic trap in the @xmath3direction , @xmath4 is the potential in the radial direction , forming the trap circular in the @xmath5plane , and @xmath6 is the mass of an atom .",
    "we also suppose that the bec is subject to external electric field with amplitude @xmath7 , which produces an additional potential @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the polarizability of the atoms ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . if the amplitude @xmath7 or direction of the field vary along some direction , say , along the @xmath10-axis , smoothly on the scale of the trap radius @xmath11 , the potential energy @xmath12 van be expanded in the taylor series and , after neglecting nonessential constant , be rewritten in the form @xmath13 , where @xmath14 and we restricted the consideration only to the first term of the expansion . in order to realize one - dimensional geometry we require torus radius to be much larger than the core radius @xmath15 , what allows us to define a small parameter @xmath16 . in order to introduce quantitative characteristics",
    ", we consider the normalized ground state @xmath17 of the eigenvalue problem @xmath18 and define @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 . in the case at hand @xmath22 and thus @xmath23 .    in the present paper",
    "we are interested in the dynamics of matter waves which spatial extension is much less than the trap perimeter , allowing treat them similarly to the matter solitons in an infinite one - dimensional trap .",
    "this in particular the case where the spatial size of the bec excitations along the trap are of order of @xmath24 , which is the well defined parameter and thus convenient for formulation the constraints of the theory . indeed , now we can estimate the kinetic energy of the longitudinal excitations as @xmath25 and require it to be much less than the kinetic energy of the transverse excitations , @xmath26 ( for the sake of simplicity here we assume that the size of the trap in @xmath3-direction is of order of the core radius : @xmath27 ) . adding the requirement for the energy of the two - body interactions , which is estimated as @xmath28 ( where @xmath29 , @xmath30 is the scattering length , @xmath31 is a mean density , @xmath32 is the total number of atoms and @xmath33 is the effective volume occupied by the atoms and estimated as @xmath34 ) , to be of order of @xmath35 and to be much less than @xmath36 ( or more precisely , requiring @xmath37 ) , we can neglect in the leading order the transitions between the transverse energy levels  @xcite , and employ the multiple scale expansion  @xcite for description of the quasi - one - dimensional evolution of the bec .",
    "we also notice that subject to the assumptions introduced , one has the estimate @xmath38 .    in order to get an insight on practical numbers ,",
    "let us consider @xmath39li atoms ( @xmath40 nm ) in a trap with @xmath41 m , @xmath42 m and @xmath43 m .",
    "then @xmath44 , the characteristic size of solitonic excitations is @xmath45 m and the number of particles is estimated as @xmath46 .",
    "we emphasize , that these estimates indicate only an order of the parameters .",
    "thus , for example , a condensate of @xmath47 lithium atoms satisfy the conditions of the theory",
    ".    we will be interested in managing soliton dynamics by means of weak ( i.e not destroying solitons ) electromagnetic field varying in time . respectively , we consider @xmath48 time - dependent and characterized by the estimate @xmath49 .",
    "then , starting with the gross - pitaevskii equation , in which the external potential in cylindrical coordinates has the form @xmath50 , and using the multiple - scale expansion one ensures that the bec macroscopic wave function in the leading order allows factorization @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 solves the nonlinear schrdinger equation , which we write in terms of @xmath54 @xmath55 , and @xmath56 @xmath57 here @xmath58sign@xmath30 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "we choose the scaling in such a way that all terms in ( [ nls ] ) are of the unity order , and in particular @xmath61 .",
    "this can be done , taken into account the normalization @xmath62 @xmath63 , which follows from the normalization condition for the order parameter @xmath64 , and considering @xmath65 , what is of order of @xmath66 , in a typical experimental setting .",
    "( [ nls ] ) is subject to periodic boundary conditions @xmath67 .",
    "first we consider the acceleration , @xmath68 , which can be achieved due to the potential @xmath69 properly dependent on time .",
    "an order of magnitude of @xmath68 can be estimated by taking into account that eq .",
    "( [ nls ] ) makes sense provided that all terms are of the unity order . in the physical units this gives @xmath70",
    "then , recalling the above example of the lithium condensate we estimates @xmath71mm / s@xmath72 , what is of order of the acceleration announced in  @xcite .",
    "it however does not provide the best estimate in our case , because it is based on the 1d model , while lowering dimensionality imposes constrains on the atomic density and consequently on the amplitude of the applied force .    to describe the physics of the phenomenon we consider a bec with a negative scattering length ( @xmath73 ) .",
    "then a `` bright soliton '' solution of eq .",
    "( [ nls ] ) at @xmath74 ( or more precisely a periodic solution mimicking a bright soliton in an infinite 1d system ) which moves with a constant velocity @xmath75 can be written down as follows  @xcite @xmath76 here @xmath77 is the jacobi elliptic function  @xcite , @xmath78 is the elliptic modulus parameterizing the solution .",
    "the frequency and the amplitude are given by : @xmath79 and @xmath80 [ @xmath81 is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind ] .",
    "the velocity of the soliton is quantized @xmath82 with @xmath83 being integer .    to ensure that the solution @xmath84 satisfies the scaling relations imposed above",
    ", we notice that the size of the soliton can be estimated as @xmath85 and its smallness implies that @xmath78 is close to unity . in that case",
    "we obtain the estimates @xmath86 and @xmath87 .    in the limit @xmath88 quantization of the velocity does not play any significant role .",
    "we verified this numerically .",
    "for example , for @xmath89 deviation of the initial velocity from the quantized one produces appreciable effect on dynamics during intervals @xmath90 only if @xmath91 .",
    "when external force is applied , @xmath92 , the velocity is not preserved any more , what manifests itself in evolution of the momentum @xmath93 ( here @xmath94 stands for complex conjugation of @xmath95 ) according to the law : @xmath96 the external field , however , does not affect the norm : @xmath97=const .",
    "it follows from ( [ bs ] ) that in the adiabatic approximation the solution of the perturbed equation ( [ nls ] ) can be searched in the form @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the time - dependent velocity of the soliton and @xmath100 is the coordinate of the soliton center . substituting ( [ bs_ad ] ) in ( [ p ] ) and taking into account the parity of the functions in the integrand as well as the fact that all of them are periodic with the same period @xmath101 , we obtain the equation for the soliton coordinate @xmath102 here @xmath103 and it is taken into account that @xmath104 , where @xmath105 is the complete elliptic integral of the second kind .    depending on the choice of the function @xmath106 , eq .",
    "( [ x ] ) describes different dynamical regimes .",
    "now we are interested in acceleration which occurs during the rotational movement of the soliton in the trap ( i.e. @xmath107 is a growing function ) .",
    "we illustrate this acceleration using an example of the simplest step - like dependence @xmath106 . to this end",
    "we assume that initially the soliton is centered at @xmath108 and require @xmath106 to be a constant @xmath109 for time intervals such that the soliton coordinates @xmath110 and to be zero for @xmath111 where the intervals @xmath112 are given by @xmath113 $ ] with @xmath114 .",
    "then , as it is clear , the acceleration of the soliton , which is given by the right hand side of ( [ x ] ) , is positive for all times .",
    "the above requirement introduces natural splitting of the temporal axis in the set of intervals @xmath115 $ ] ( @xmath116 ) , with @xmath117 , such that @xmath118 for @xmath119 and @xmath120 for @xmath121 ( here @xmath122 ) .",
    "thus , our task is to find @xmath123 .",
    "this can be done by taking into account that during each of the `` odd '' intervals @xmath124 eq .",
    "( [ x ] ) describes conservative nonlinear oscillator , the solution for which is well known . during `` even '' intervals @xmath125",
    "the motion is free ( with a constant velocity ) what means that the time @xmath125 necessary for the soliton to cross an interval @xmath126 $ ] is @xmath127 where @xmath128 is the velocity in the point @xmath129 . during the time interval @xmath124",
    "the soliton has to cross the interval @xmath130 . from this condition",
    "we obtain : @xmath131 where @xmath132 is the energy of the soliton in the point @xmath133 , @xmath134 , and @xmath135 is the soliton velocity in the same point . at the end of the interval @xmath124 the soliton velocity is given by @xmath136 .",
    "thus one computes that after @xmath137 rotations the soliton acquires the velocity @xmath138 , which can be obtained from the recurrent relation : @xmath139 .",
    "[ cols=\"^ \" , ]",
    "in the present paper we have shown that dynamics of a matter soliton in a toroidal trap , well reproducing one - dimensional geometry , can be very efficiently governed by time varying external electric field . in particular , such regimes like dynamical acceleration , stochastic acceleration , localization and implementation of the kapitza pendulum can be realized by proper choices of the time dependence of the external force .",
    "experimental detection of the acceleration can be implemented either by direct imaging of the atomic cloud , which is well localized in space and has well specified trajectory , or by measurement of the atomic distribution in the momentum space displaying shift of the maximum towards higher kinetic energies .",
    "alternatively , one can study the evolution of the atomic cloud releasing from the trap ( by switching the trap off ) after some period of accelerating motion .",
    "the respective dynamics will be a spreading out cloud whose center of mass is moving with the acquired velocity .",
    "the obtained results were based on the one - dimensional model , although deduced using the multiple - scale method and thus mathematically controllable .",
    "this means that a number of problem , are still left open .",
    "one of them is the limitation on the soliton velocity , and thus acceleration , introduced by lowering the space dimension , which appears when the solitonic kinetic energy becomes comparable with the transverse kinetic energy .",
    "another limitation on the soliton acceleration emerges from the fact of the velocity quantization , when the radius of the ring trap is not large enough .",
    "we also left for further studies the diversity of localized stationary atomic distributions supported by the external filed , indicating only the lowest modes .",
    "we thus believe that the richness of the phenomena which can be observed by simple combination of the trap geometry and varying external field will stimulate new experimental and theoretical studies .",
