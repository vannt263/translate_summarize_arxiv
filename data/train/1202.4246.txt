    "the total - variation _ cutoff phenomenon _ describes a sharp transition in the @xmath3-distance of a finite markov chain from equilibrium , dropping abruptly from near its maximum to near @xmath4 ( see formal definitions in   [ sec : prelim - cutoff ] ) . since its discovery in the early 80 s by aldous and diaconis (",
    "@xcite following  @xcite ) the cutoff phenomenon has been believed to be widespread in markov chains . until very recently",
    ", however , rigorous proofs of cutoff were confined to very few cases where the stationary measure was well - understood and fairly simple , e.g.  uniform , 1-dimensional unimodal etc .",
    "the focus of this work is on cutoff for glauber dynamics for spin - systems such as the ising model , chains which are natural models for the evolution of these systems in addition to being their most practiced sampling methods . despite extensive study",
    ", the understanding of the stationary measure in these models remains limited .",
    "for instance , for the ising model on @xmath5 the value of the critical temperature is unknown , as is the basic question of whether spin - spin correlations at criticality decay with distance .",
    "peres conjectured in 2004 that glauber dynamics for the ising model on any sequence of bounded - degree transitive graphs would exhibit cutoff at high temperatures , yet even for the 1d torus ( ising on a cycle ) this was open until recently . in the companion paper  @xcite the authors proved cutoff and established its location for glauber dynamics for the ising model on the @xmath0-dimensional torus @xmath1 for any @xmath2 at any temperature where the stationary measure satisfies the _ strong spatial mixing _ condition which requires that the effect of changes in boundary conditions decay exponentially in distance ( this holds on @xmath6 at all temperatures and on @xmath7 all the way up to the critical temperature ; see  [ sec : prelim ] for definitions and background . )",
    "the proof featured a framework for eliminating the dependencies between distant small boxes , with which the @xmath3-mixing of the whole system could be reduced to @xmath8-mixing of its projections onto these boxes .",
    "the symmetry of the torus , giving any such box the same effect on mixing , played a key role in the analysis ( e.g. , the basic setting of a box in @xmath9 with free boundary conditions was not covered ) , as did the monotonicity of the ising model .    in this work",
    "we enhance the above framework to forsake the symmetry and monotonicity limitations . postponing standard definitions to   [ sec : prelim ]",
    ", we next describe the new results , first for the ising model and thereafter for non - monotone systems such as the gas hard - core model and the potts model .",
    "theorem  [ mainthm - arbitrary ] below formulates a cutoff criterion for stochastic ising on general graphs with arbitrary boundary conditions , interaction strengths and external fields ( possibly non - uniform ) .",
    "the criterion factors in the growth rate of balls of logarithmic radius and the log - sobolev constants of the induced system on subgraphs of poly - logarithmic diameter . as one application we obtain that on bounded - degree graphs where these log - sobolev constants are bounded away from 0 ( e.g. , lattices in the strong spatial mixing regime ) there is cutoff as long as the graphs have _ sub - exponential growth_.",
    "[ mainthm - arbitrary ] let @xmath10 be a connected graph on @xmath11 vertices with maximal degree @xmath12 , and consider glauber dynamics for the ferromagnetic ising model on @xmath10 with arbitrary ( possibly non - uniform ) interactions and external fields .",
    "let @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the log - sobolev constant of the dynamics on @xmath15 with free boundary and the original interactions and external field , and @xmath16 is the subgraph induced on the ball of radius @xmath17 around the vertex @xmath18 .",
    "then @xmath19 for any @xmath20 and large enough @xmath11 .",
    "in particular , for any sequence @xmath21 with @xmath22 and @xmath23 the dynamics has cutoff , as @xmath24 .    the above theorem allowed for an arbitrary ( possibly non - uniform ) external field , which in particular encompasses any arbitrary boundary condition . as mentioned above , it is known ( due to  @xcite ) that the log - sobolev constant of stochastic ising on a finite box in @xmath9 is bounded away from 0 whenever there is strong spatial mixing .",
    "the growth rate parameter @xmath25 defined in theorem  [ mainthm - arbitrary ] there satisfies @xmath26 , whence we deduce the following :    [ maincor - bc ] let @xmath2 and consider glauber dynamics for the ising model on a box @xmath27 of side - length @xmath11 under arbitrary boundary conditions , local interactions and external fields .",
    "then throughout the regime of strong spatial mixing the dynamics exhibits cutoff with a window of @xmath28 .",
    "for instance , the above corollary implies that on @xmath29 with free boundary conditions the dynamics exhibits cutoff for any @xmath30 .",
    "the proofs of the aforementioned results are not specific to the ising model but rather can be applied to glauber dynamics for any spin system model at high enough temperature , notably including non - monotone systems such as the potts model .",
    "this is formalized in the generic theorem  [ t : general ] ( see  [ sec : general ] ) , from which we can derive the following corollaries :    [ mainthm - potts - zd ] let @xmath2 and consider the potts model on a box @xmath27 of side - length @xmath11 with @xmath31 colors , inverse - temperature @xmath32 satisfying @xmath33 and arbitrary boundary conditions . then the glauber dynamics exhibits cutoff with a window of @xmath28 .",

    "let @xmath2 and consider the proper coloring model on a box @xmath27 of side - length @xmath11 with @xmath37 colors and arbitrary boundary conditions .",
    "then the heat - bath dynamics has cutoff with window @xmath28 .",
    "while the above results were stated for @xmath38 , analogous results hold for any @xmath0-dimensional lattice @xmath39 with finite periodicity , such as triangular , hexagonal etc .",
    ", in particular including non - bipartite lattices ( in which one can not use the standard monotone reordering procedure of an anti - monotone system ) .",
    "other notable examples for the lattice @xmath39 include :    [ it - long - range ] a @xmath0-dimensional lattice ( e.g.  @xmath38 ) with long range interactions ( edges between any two vertices with distance at most @xmath40 for some @xmath41 fixed ) .    [ it - prod ] a product of a @xmath0-dimensional lattice with any fixed graph @xmath15 .",
    "similarly , theorems  [ mainthm - potts - zd][mainthm - coloring - zd ] were stated for the heat - bath dynamics yet the proofs hold also for metropolis - hastings with suitably modified constants .    in all the results listed",
    "thus far there was no closed form for the cutoff location .",
    "the proofs specify this location as a threshold for the cumulative @xmath8-mixing on poly - logarithmic balls around each vertex , in which the effect of different subgraphs can greatly vary in general .",
    "when the boundary conditions are homogenous ( e.g. , free or all - plus ) we can obtain an explicit formula for the cutoff location in terms of spectral gaps of the infinite - volume dynamics on half - plane intersections .",
    "this is stated next for 2d lattices with all - plus boundary .",
    "( an analogous statement holds for free / minus boundary . )",
    "[ mainthm - plusbc2d ] consider glauber dynamics for the ising model on @xmath42 , an @xmath43 box with all - plus boundary conditions . throughout the high temperature regime",
    "@xmath44 cutoff occurs at @xmath45 , where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the spectral gaps of the dynamics on the infinite - volume lattice and the half - plane with all - plus boundary condition , respectively .    in  [ sec :",
    "cutoff - locations ] we prove the generalization of the above theorem ( theorem  [ t : plusgeneral ] ) to @xmath38 for any @xmath0 . in that generality , the cutoff location is given in terms of @xmath0 separate infinite - volume spectral gaps in @xmath38 where the corresponding boundary is imposed on the half - planes in a subset of the @xmath0 coordinates .",
    "furthermore , as in the remark following theorems  [ mainthm - potts - zd][mainthm - coloring - zd ] , the arguments extend beyond @xmath38 to give the cutoff location for any @xmath0-dimensional lattice @xmath39 with finite periodicity and homogenous boundary conditions .",
    "for instance , a special case of example   from that remark is the _ circular ladder _ graph , the product of the cycle @xmath48 with an edge . in  @xcite*theorem  15.10",
    "it was shown that glauber dynamics for the ising model on this graph mixes in continuous - time @xmath49 and noted that the correct order would be @xmath50 via a block - dynamics argument .",
    "our results imply that in fact there is cutoff in this setting and the mixing asymptotics are @xmath51 where @xmath46 is the ( explicitly known ) spectral gap of glauber dynamics on the infinite ladder .",
    "contrary to the results establishing cutoff , the argument that relates its location to infinite - volume spectral - gaps does rely on the monotonicity of the ising model in an essential way .",
    "nevertheless , in the special case of bipartite lattices such as @xmath38 the standard monotone reordering of the partial order on lattice configurations extends the arguments also to anti - monotone systems .",
    "the analogue of theorem  [ mainthm - plusbc2d ] ( cutoff and its location in terms of spectral - gaps of infinite - volume dynamics on half - plane intersections ) thus holds also for    anti - ferromagnetic ising model on @xmath38 under all - plus / all - minus / free b.c .",

    "moreover , propagation of information occurs at a constant rate and so the configuration in distant parts of the graph will be close to independent .",
    "this suggests that a product markov chain is the right heuristic to understand the convergence of high temperature glauber dynamics .",
    "we next discuss showing cutoff for such chains , followed by our approach to reduce the problem to that setting .",
    "an important step in our proof is bounding the total variation distance from stationarity of product chains by the @xmath8-distance of its component chains .",
    "in general for @xmath54 , the @xmath55 distance between the measures @xmath56 and @xmath57 that nowhere vanishes is @xmath58 the mentioned reduction is formalized by the next proposition ( proved in   [ sec - l1-l2 ] ) which we believe is of independent interest .",

    "in particular , if for a family of chains @xmath70 then @xmath71 whereas if @xmath72 and   holds for @xmath73 then @xmath74 .",
    "this identifies the cutoff location for product chains as above as the time @xmath75 such that @xmath76 , and further establishes the total - variation distance from equilibrium within the cutoff window to be @xmath77 asymptotically , where @xmath78 is the error - function .",

    "that is , its discrete - time analogue @xmath81 flips a uniform coordinate at each step , while @xmath82 for a poisson random variable @xmath83 ( eliminating periodicity issues ) .",
    "this was one of the original examples of cutoff , which occurs here at time @xmath84 as shown by aldous  @xcite .",
    "moreover , cutoff occurs within a window of @xmath49 , as follows from explicit bounds of  @xcite on the distance of the lazy discrete - time chain ( applies @xmath85 with probability @xmath86 and is idle otherwise ) from equilibrium at time @xmath87 .",
    "these bounds were refined in  @xcite*theorem 1 to show this distance is @xmath88 .",
    "to reobtain this result for the continuous - time chain via proposition  [ prop - l1-l2 ] argue as follows .",
    "let @xmath89 be the lazy continuous - time chain corresponding to the discrete kernel @xmath90 .",
    "it is well known ( and easy to see ) that the heat - kernels corresponding to @xmath91 satisfy @xmath92 , thus it suffices to estimate @xmath93 .",

    "one virtue of formulating it in terms of markov chains ( beyond its application in this work ) is that one can then derive the @xmath105 condition on @xmath60 from the analogous @xmath8 requirement on @xmath106 ( see , e.g. , corollary  [ cor - products ] ) .      while the product chain paradigm is useful in explaining the presence of cutoff , the key ideas of the proof are methods to break the dependencies inherent in the dynamics .",
    "proposition  [ prop - l1-l2 ] does suggest a natural way to establish lower bounds on the mixing time .",
    "if one takes well separated blocks @xmath107 , the projections of the chain onto the blocks are essentially independent .",
    "taking @xmath108 in proposition  [ prop - l1-l2 ] gives lower bounds on the distance from stationarity which are sufficiently strong to give sharp enough lower bounds on the mixing time .",
    "the dependencies of the measure and the chain , however , make sharp upper bounds far more challenging .",
    "since projection decreases the total variation distance this approach does not yield upper bounds . despite the rapid decay of correlations with distance , it remained a challenging open problem to give sharp total variation distance bounds even for the @xmath109 ising model . to overcome this in the case of the ising model on the torus in  @xcite we introduced a method to bound the total variation distance at time @xmath110 by the expected total variation distance at time @xmath111 of the chain projected onto a random set we call the _ update support_.    viewing the markov chain from time @xmath75 to time @xmath110 as a random function @xmath112 where @xmath113 it may be the case that the value of @xmath114 is determined by only a subset of the spins of @xmath115 ",
    "the smallest such set is the update support .",
    "since by definition the spins outside of this set have no effect on the value of the chain at time @xmath110 , the total variation distance at time @xmath110 is bounded by the expected projection onto the update support at time @xmath75 .",
    "( lemma  [ lem - support ] places this in a more general context of random mapping representations for markov chains . )",
    "a key step in our analysis is then to analyze the structure of the update support . while  @xcite used the symmetries of the torus in numerous ways , in this paper we consider graphs and systems with highly inhomogeneous structure and external fields .",
    "the hypothesis of theorem  [ mainthm - arbitrary ] is chosen in such a way that the dynamics in most local neighbourhoods of radius @xmath116 would couple completely in time of smaller order than the mixing time .",
    "the sub - exponential growth is essential as it ensures that these neighborhoods have size @xmath117 .    to ensure that well separated vertices are independent we modify the map @xmath114 to satisfy this property yet in such a way that it can be coupled to the true dynamics with high probability .",
    "we call this modified process the _ barrier dynamics _ , constructed so that information can not travel further than a given distance . using this independence we wish to show that when @xmath111 is sufficiently large , yet still of smaller order than the mixing time , the update support is _",
    "sparse_. here again the assumption of sub - exponential growth is essential as it allows us to take union bounds and show that the support size decays exponentially and that it splits into small well - separated components of diameter at most @xmath118 w.h.p .",
    "( see figures  [ fig : support - potts][fig : support - ising ] ) .",
    "finally , our requirement on the log - sobolev constant is chosen in such a way that the dynamics restricted to these regions mixes rapidly .",
    "square lattice at @xmath119 .",
    "frames depict evolution of the update support of the barrier dynamics ( support sites in yellow ) into microscopic disconnected components.,width=480 ]    the quantitative bounds of proposition  [ prop - l1-l2 ] then allow us to compare the derived upper and lower bounds .",
    "again , arbitrary geometry and external fields may grant much stronger effect to certain parts of the system on mixing compared to others ( whereas the setting of the torus studied in  @xcite had complete symmetry and the problem reduced to a product of i.i.d .",
    "nevertheless , it is possible to show that there exists a well separated subset of blocks which dominates an expected sparse set of blocks from the matching upper bound . finding this set of blocks",
    "is done in a greedy manner .",
    "overall , we identify a time @xmath120 at which the dynamics is far from mixed through the lower bound and then is well mixed at time @xmath121 through the upper bound .",
    "in  [ sec : general ] we extend our analysis to the case of general spin - systems .",
    "our construction of the function @xmath114 described above implicitly used a grand - coupling of the chain starting from all possible initial configurations . in the case of the ising model",
    "this is the standard monotone coupling , through which the chains from all starting states coalesce rapidly ( namely , exponentially fast ) at high temperatures . for general models , e.g. , non - monotone systems ,",
    "we extend the framework to remain valid so long as such a grand coupling is available ( see theorem  [ t : general ] ) . for concreteness",
    "we give a condition , valid for high enough temperatures , under which one can construct a grand coupling as required , thus implying cutoff and the aforementioned theorems  [ mainthm - potts - zd][mainthm - coloring - zd ] .",
    "this approach is akin to methods used in coupling from the past techniques for perfect simulation .      in  [ sec : cutoff - locations ] ( see theorem  [ t : plusgeneral ] ) we derive the cutoff location for the ising model on a box in @xmath38 under free / all - plus / all - minus boundary conditions . unlike the setting of the torus considered in  @xcite , the presence of boundary conditions destroys the symmetry of the graph and creates a disparity between the mixing effects of vertices near the boundary vs.  those near the center of the box . as such",
    ", the cutoff location becomes a function of the spectral gap of the dynamics not just on the infinite - volume lattice but also on intersections of half - spaces .",
    "our approach is to classify vertices according to their position in the box in terms of the number of faces they are close to and to couple the local dynamics to the one in the appropriate half - space .",
    "we note in passing that at present it is unknown whether for instance the spectral - gaps featured in theorem  [ mainthm - plusbc2d ] satisfy @xmath122 .",
    "( a weak inequality holds , while equality would imply that the cutoff location specified there is only a function of @xmath46 . )",
    "there are plausible heuristics suggesting that these half - space spectral - gap terms are imperative in at least some settings , e.g. , models with stronger correlations on the boundary than in the bulk due to boundary conditions ( see  @xcite for more details ) .",
    "in  [ sec : prelim ] we give the main definitions related to markov chains , spin systems and the glauber dynamics .",
    "we prove proposition  [ prop - l1-l2 ] in  [ sec - l1-l2 ] . in  [ sec : arbitrary ] we prove theorem  [ mainthm - arbitrary ] showing that cutoff applies in general on graphs of sub - exponential growth whenever the log - sobolev constants are suitably bounded .",
