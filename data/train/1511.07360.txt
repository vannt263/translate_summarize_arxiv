    "we thus deplete all molecules populating the set of states @xmath82 .    to deplete the population in all four rotational states @xmath81 we in addition drive the @xmath83 vibrational transitions from the state @xmath86 and couple the @xmath87 rotational transitions with mw as shown in fig .",

    "@xmath88 it is not possible to deplete only the rotational states @xmath89 with this scheme .",
    "however , a state selected signal of molecules populating the set of states @xmath89 is given by the difference of signals measured while depleting @xmath81 or @xmath82 .",
    "the sets of states which can be detected clearly depend strongly on which microwave sources are available to couple neighboring @xmath9 states .    to detect the population of the single @xmath1-sublevel @xmath65 we use the scheme shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : depl](a ) without coupling the @xmath90 states . thus , the single @xmath1-sublevel @xmath65 is the only one within @xmath82 which is not depleted .",

    "the detection of the population in the single @xmath1-state @xmath64 works similarly .",
    "in contrast to the detection of @xmath65 , the vibrational transition is here driven from the @xmath80 rotational state . as this leads to spontaneous decay to states with @xmath86 , the population in states with @xmath89",
    "is additionally removed by coupling all @xmath1-substates with mw to untrapped states .      in fig .",

    "[ fig : rsc](a ) .",
    "the changes in population caused by rsc can be calculated with a rate model .",

    "the time scale of the process matches the experimental results . in both cases , the population of the states with @xmath89 decreases by a factor of two within about .",
    "in addition , the rate model suggests about ten percent loss to untrapped states .",
    "however , we measure an increase of molecules in the total set of states @xmath81 . the reasons for this discrepancy are described in the following .",
    "to understand the outcome of our measurement we first have to consider of the whole experimental sequence shown fig .",
    "[ fig : rsc](b ) .",
    "in particular , the total time for storage is identical for all data points to minimize the influence of trap losses . as population transfer caused by blackbody radiation is present during that time",

    "however , our current detection scheme does not allow to measure the population of @xmath80 alone .",
    "therefore , the measurement presented in the letter tracks the population of @xmath82 together . ]",
    "the order of the experimental sequence is the main reason for the measured increase of molecules in the total set of states @xmath81 : rsc on average increases the stark shift of the molecule ( @xmath92 ) .",
    "for example , a spontaneous decay from the excited @xmath93 state to @xmath80 has to end up in the @xmath65 state , where the stark shift is a factor of 1.2 higher .",
    "the excited @xmath94 state can decay to the @xmath95 states .",
    "the lowest possible @xmath1-sublevel @xmath96 has the same stark shift as @xmath94 .",
    "therefore the molecules , again , end up in rotational states with on average higher stark shifts . as the lifetime in our trap increases with the stark shift of the molecule  @xcite",
    ", we expect to measure an increase in signal .",
    "this effect is particularly visible by comparing the results measured at and .",
    "already after about almost all molecules from the states @xmath89 were pumped to @xmath82 ( or lost to untrapped states ) , but the total signal still slightly increases for longer rsc times .",
    "the molecules have been pumped to higher stark shifts earlier in the experimental sequence and hence the trap losses are slightly reduced .",
    "another experimental subtlety is different detection efficiencies in different internal states which also might hide losses .",
    "as discussed in reference  @xcite , the detection efficiency of non manipulated molecules depends on the ratio of temperature and stark shift . however , rsc slightly changes the stark shift possibly resulting in a slightly different detection efficiency .",
    "both effects , the change in the molecule s lifetime and the possible different detection efficiency are hard to be included in the rate model but the outcome of our experiment can qualitatively be understood by the above considerations .",
    "the loss of about 10% of the molecules could be a limitation for extending the scheme to incorporate higher rotational states .",
    "however , instead of driving a @xmath97 ir transition one could first use a @xmath98 transition which accumulates the population in the highest @xmath1-substates and then use the @xmath97 ir transition to address these states . for large sets of states even switching several times between a @xmath97 and @xmath98 vibrational transition should be useful . in this way , the loss to untrapped states is strongly suppressed .",
    "mw , ir and rf radiation employed for sisyphus cooling are shown in the left panel .",
    "the rf transitions between the @xmath1-sublevels are driven in the high - field region of the trap as indicated in the blue ellipse for the two highest sublevels of @xmath79  @xcite . ]    to simplify the understanding of the optical pumping schemes which are detailed in the letter , we here append figures of the corresponding level schemes . first , fig .",

    "<S> [ fig : fig3](a ) also gives the timescale of rsc which matches nicely with the rate model in the supplementary information . </S>",
    "<S> the relatively long timescale is due to the slow spontaneous decay rate from the excited vibrational state of approximately @xmath49hz , combined with a probability of at most @xmath50 for a molecule to be in the excited vibrational state and a branching ratio of @xmath51 for a decay from the vibrational excited state to the states @xmath52 .    while fig .  </S>",

    "<S> we find that ssp increases the absolute number of molecules populating the state @xmath65 by 70 ( 3)% , with this number also yielding the optical - pumping efficiency . </S>",
    "<S> a slight modification of the scheme also allows pumping from @xmath65 to @xmath64 , specifically by driving a @xmath66 transition from @xmath14 and a @xmath41 transition from @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> this yields a transfer efficiency of 50(5)% , where the reduced value is a consequence of less favorable branching ratios . </S>",

    "<S> enhance the rotational - state purity of the trapped sample of molecules in the course of the shown experiments : apart from optical pumping , which is specifically applied for this reason , filtering occurs as a side effect of motional sisyphus cooling . during motional cooling , molecules initially populating states outside the closed cycling scheme consisting of @xmath75 , @xmath52 and @xmath76 are coupled to untrapped states with a slow rate  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , translational cooling alone leads to a significant increase of purity , since afterwards almost all molecules populate the states @xmath64 and @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> however , deliberate optical pumping to the target state @xmath65 ( ssp ) yields the greatest effect on state purity as can be expected from the previous discussions . </S>",
    "<S> the relative occupation is boosted a bit further by removing all molecules still populating states other than the dark state of the ssp scheme ( so - called cleaning ) .    in total , we augment the population of a single @xmath1-sublevel from initially @xmath77% to at least 70% while the molecular ensemble is motionally cooled by more than an order of magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , we even expect @xmath78% of the molecules to populate this particular rotational state , as our detection method underestimates the real occupation by roughly 20%  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the achieved purity is mainly limited by the above discussed blackbody radiation , which removes molecules from the target state during application of ssp and cleaning with a rate of . </S>",
    "<S> this limitation is of technical nature and can be eliminated by cooling down the electric trap or choosing a molecule species not suffering from significant blackbody - radiation losses .    by applying the extremely useful technique of optical pumping to trapped , </S>",

    "<S> thus , as a next step , we plan on internally cooling heavier molecules which populate numerous internal states even at cryogenic temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> this extends the number of species accessible to motional sisyphus cooling . </S>",
    "<S> comprehensive internal - state control also gives new prospects for high precision measurements or state resolved collision studies . finally , extending our scheme to pump into the absolute ground state  @xcite creates favorable conditions for the investigation of sympathetic or evaporative cooling of polyatomic molecules .    </S>",
