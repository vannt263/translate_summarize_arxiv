    "the state of an open quantum system is conventionally described through a reduced density matrix @xmath0 whose dynamics is given by a dissipative equation of motion  the quantum master equation . from a numerical point of view",
    "this formalism has a major drawback : for a system whose state is described in a @xmath1-dimensional hilbert space @xmath2 , the quantum master equation is a set of @xmath3 coupled differential equations .",
    "hence the numerical evaluation of the quantum master equation is in practice not feasible for large systems @xcite .",
    "this difficulty does not arise in the stochastic wave function approach to open systems @xcite : here , the state of an open quantum system is described by a stochastic wave function @xmath4 , _",

    "the connection to the density matrix formalism is made through the relation @xmath12p[\\psi_0,t_0],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 $ ] is the probability density of an ensemble of normalized pure states characterizing some initial density matrix @xmath14 and @xmath15 is the hilbert space volume element @xcite .",
