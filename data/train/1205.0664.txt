    "the disorder - induced metal - insulator transition ( mit ) and the concept of anderson localization@xcite have been studied extensively for over @xmath1 years .",
    "most of the attention was focused on electronic systems and their transport properties@xcite  indeed the acronym mit itself suggests this . however , localization physics is of course much broader than just electrons in solid state devices and encompasses the whole realm of waves  quantum and classical  and their interference due to random scattering events .",
    "recently , the interest in localization has been rekindled by its beautiful realization in cold atom systems .",
    "@xcite similarly , localization of classical waves has received new impetus from spatially resolved studies in elastic , vibrational systems.@xcite    theoretical work on the localization properties of harmonic solids has received somewhat less attention over the years . in our opinion , this could be due to ( i ) a general expectation that the vibrational problem only mimics the electronic one and ( ii ) the one clear feature when this is not the case  the so - called  boson peak \" ( bp)@xcite  up to this date remains to be understood fully . in a recent paper,@xcite we have shown that expectation ( i ) is only partially true : the phase diagrams , even for just a simple cubic harmonic lattice of masses and springs , exhibit several intriguing features for both the purely mass and the purely spring constant disordered cases .",
    "a similarly distinguishing characteristic of vibrational localization is the fact that the zero frequency , i.e.  @xmath2 mode that corresponds to global translational invariance , can not be localized regardless of the amount of disorder.@xcite the aforementioned bp corresponds to the appearance of a low - frequency enhancement of the density of states @xmath3 with respect to debye s @xmath4 law.@xcite most previous investigations of the localization properties of disordered vibrational modes agree that the modes near and above the bp are extended,@xcite i.e.  @xmath5 , where @xmath6 denotes the bp frequency ( peak of @xmath7 ) and @xmath8 the boundary between extended and localized states . it has been argued before via eigenvalue statistics that the states with @xmath9 are governed by random - matrix statistics of the gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe).@xcite in this paper , we present a detailed study of the vibrational localization and transport properties throughout the previously obtained phase diagrams of a cubic harmonic lattice system with either random mass or random spring constant disorder . using large matrix diagonalization techniques",
    ", we investigate the behaviour of the vibrational density of states ( vdos ) as well as the participation numbers and wave function statistics of the vibrational eigenstates .",
    "this complements earlier studies of participation ratios,@xcite level - spacing statistics@xcite and multifractal properties.@xcite in particular we demonstrate that the disorder - effected states below @xmath8 exhibit a modified porter - thomas statistics of the wave functions , which is close to the one from the goe ensemble .",
    "in addition , we present results from a high - precision transfer matrix method ( tmm ) and a finite - size scaling ( fss ) analysis which allow us to corroborate the phase diagrams and calculate the universality class of the mobility edges across all of the phase diagram .",
    "our results have relevance in the related problem of instantaneous normal modes in glasses and supercooled liquids@xcite as well as acoustic metamaterials.@xcite here we just note that in both these classes of materials , there exist excitations which can be related to the existence of states in what is formally part of the temporally decaying , negative @xmath10 region of the phase diagrams shown in fig .",
