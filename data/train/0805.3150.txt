    "more specifically , we compare the half - light radii of simulated and observed galaxies in terms of size - mass and size - luminosity relations .",

    "we adopt an approximate model for dust extinction following binney & merrifield ( 1998 ) but assume that dust attenuation is proportional to the metal column density rather than the total hydrogen density and correct for depletion of refractory elements ( zn ) onto dust grains parametrized by @xmath48 , fraction of iron in dust ( vladilo & peroux 2005 ) : @xmath49 @xmath50 mag , where @xmath51 is the proton mass , @xmath52 is the mass column density of metals in front of a given star particle .",

    ", we see that our high resolution permits formation of extremely dense structures . on the other hand , many rich and salient features produced by cosmological processes , such as mergers and tidal tails , are clearly visible and striking . comparing the leftmost and middle pictures of each row of the insets suggests that dust extinction significantly affects the observed luminosity density distribution in the observed @xmath63-band .",
    "this can be understood simply as a consequence of the empirical schmidt - kennicutt relation ( kennicutt 1998 ) : gas surface density increases monotonically as star formation rate density increases ; and we assumed that dust extinction is proportional to the metal surface density hence gas surface density ( for a constant metallicity ) .",

    "each sample of observed galaxies is shown by distinct symbols as indicated .",

    "( 2008 ) . in all panels ,",
    "the intrinsic sizes of the simulated galaxies lie mostly between 0.2 and @xmath66 , while the dust extinction - applied sizes can be significantly larger .",
    "this increase in apparent sizes is , on average , greater at shorter wavelengths and for more massive and luminous galaxies , and may be partly responsible for the observed relation between star formation and size at @xmath67 ( toft et al . 2007 ;",
    "zirm et al .",
    "remarkably , this trend is also seen in the sizes of the simulated galaxies measured in the rest - frame optical bands . in the top display of figure 2 ,",
    "the observational data are only available for galaxies with stellar masses of @xmath68 . in this mass range , there are more than one half of the observed galaxies having the half - light radii ( all measured in the rest - frame optical ) greater than @xmath69 , whereas all of the simulated galaxies in the same mass range have the half - light radii smaller than @xmath69 .",
    "a significant fraction of these relatively massive galaxies that are actively star - forming ( sfr @xmath70 m@xmath33 yr@xmath12 ) may be identified with the lbgs ( steidel et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "this discrepancy in half - light radii between simulated and observed galaxies is also seen in the size - luminosity relation at the bottom display of figure 2 , where luminosities at several different observed bands are shown in four separate panels . here",
    ", the half - light radii of the simulated galaxies again occupy the low - end of the distributions compared to galaxies observed in the hst wfpc2 f814w filter ( lowenthal et al .",
    "1997 ) , in the vlt isaac k@xmath71 band ( trujillo et al .  2006 ; toft et al .",
    "2007 ) . however , the situation here is slightly more complicated in that we find apparent agreement between simulated galaxies and observations of giavalisco et al .",
    "( 2008 ) in the hst acs f850lp filter and , to some degree , of buitrago et al .",
    "( 2008 ) in the vlt isaac k@xmath71 band . whether the discrepancy among observed sizes is real or an artifact of the different source extraction and fitting algorithms employed is an open question .",
    "overall , we conclude that there is fairly strong indication that the simulated massive galaxies are too small compared to their observed counterparts at @xmath15 , from rest - frame uv to rest - frame optical bands .",
    "this suggests that the concurrent star formation activities and the overall stellar mass distributions in the simulated galaxies at @xmath3 are both too concentrated near the galactic centers .",
    "concentration of stellar mass may be shown in an alternative way using rotation curves .",
    "figure 3 shows rotation velocity curves for the three top galaxies of total mass of @xmath72 .",
    "these curves seem to peak at too high a value ( @xmath10-@xmath11 km s@xmath12 ) at small radii ( @xmath6@xmath13 ) .",
    "it is prudent to ask if our results depend on limited resolution . to address this point , we ran higher resolution simulations ( with the smallest cell size of 0.11 proper@xmath73 or twice the linear resolution as in our fiducial models ) of 2 of the 5 subvolumes , or 8 of the 49 galaxies discussed in this letter .",
    "in all of these cases , we find that both the intrinsic half - mass and intrinsic half - light radii are significantly smaller ( by nearly a factor of 2 ) , indicating that our results have not yet converged in terms of obtaining the absolute sizes of the high - z galaxies .",
    "we find that the dust attenuated half - light radii with the higher resolution simulations are slightly smaller ( 10 - 30% ) than those from lower resolution simulation .",
    "while the absolute sizes have not converged , these tests support and strengthen our conclusion that the simulated galaxies at @xmath3 are too small compared to their observed counterparts .",
    "the standard cold dark matter cosmological model is in good agreement with a rich set of observations on large scales .",
    "our main purpose is to systematically examine it , through a series of papers , in the context of galaxy formation and evolution , a regime where , relatively speaking , it has not been seriously contested . because astrophysical processes tend to play a progressively more important role at smaller scales , in particular , on galactic scales and smaller , it is vital to employ as few adjustable astrophysical parameters as possible , to have a true test of the cosmological model . in this paper",
    "we focus on the sizes of galaxies , including lbgs ( steidel et al .",
    "2003 ) at redshift @xmath3 , using state - of - the - art amr cosmological hydrodynamic simulations with a spatial resolution of proper @xmath0 in five refined subregions embedded within a comoving cosmological volume ( @xmath74)@xmath2 .",
    "we find that , taking into account dust extinction , the computed distribution of half - light radii of simulated galaxies in the rest - frame @xmath63- and @xmath64-bands occupy only the low - end of the observed size distributions .",
    "while none of the simulated massive galaxies have half - light radii larger than @xmath6@xmath7 , more than one half of the observed galaxies have half - light radii exceeding that value .",
    "we note that the intrinsic ( i.e. , in the absence of dust extinction and finite instrumental resolution ) half - light ( and half - stellar - mass ) radii are smaller at @xmath75 and our resolution tests indicate that they become still smaller with higher resolution , hence strengthening our conclusions .",
    "consistent with this apparent discrepancy between simulated and observed lbgs , the rotation curves of the simulated galaxies of total masses of @xmath8-@xmath9 have unusually high values ( @xmath10-@xmath11 km s@xmath12 ) at small radii ( @xmath6@xmath13 ) .",
    "such rotation curves are not seen in local galaxies for which accurate measurements are available , although no direct comparison with observed high - redshift galaxies can be properly made at this time .",
    "these discrepancies appear to originate from stellar masses that are too highly concentrated in small ( @xmath76 ) central regions of the simulated galaxies .",
    "this may be caused by an over - abundance of smaller galaxies that formed at high redshifts and subsequently sank to the centers via dynamical friction _ or _ by vigorous _ in situ _ star formation in the central regions .",
    "likely , any potential viable solution to this apparent problem would have to reduce the amount of stars that formed .",
    "possible physical mechanisms include : ( 1 ) an early reionization with @xmath14 to suppress gas condensation that will reduce earlier star formation ( e.g. , bullock , kravtsov , & weinberg 2000 ) , ( 2 ) a strong , internal energetic feedback from stars or central black holes to reduce the overall star formation efficiency ( e.g. , sommer - larson et al .",
    "2003 ; governato et al .",
    "2007 ) , or ( 3 ) a substantial small - scale cutoff in the matter power spectrum , for example , if the dark matter particles are warm rather than cold ( e.g. , hogan & dalcanton 2000 ; sommer - larsen & dolgov 2001 ; bode , ostriker & turok 2001 )    since the age of the universe at @xmath3 is only about @xmath77 of the present age , a successful resolution to the galaxy size problem at @xmath78 may provide important  cleaner \" clues to the nature of the dark matter and/or important astrophysical processes at high redshifts . moreover , combining observations at both @xmath3 and @xmath17 may provide still more powerful constraints .",
