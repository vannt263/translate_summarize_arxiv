    "when an optical beam is totally reflected at a dielectric interface , the reflected beam comes out at a point shifted along the interface from the incident point .",
    "this deviation is called goos - hnchen ( gh ) shift @xcite .",
    "this arises due to the interference of its plane wave components whose phase loss upon the reflection varies with their incident angle . although it has been first observed in optical beams , the gh shift ( or effect ) is a generic phenomenon of wave mechanics and can be found in various physical systems such as graphene @xcite , normal / superconductor interface @xcite , optical beam @xcite , dielectric microcavity @xcite or in the dynamics of neutron @xcite .",
    "recently , the gh effect has been studied with electron waves in condensed matters , @xmath0/@xmath1-doped interface in graphene @xcite and normal / superconductor ( ns ) interface @xcite .",
    "note that these works have investigated the gh effect appearing at a _",
    "interface , where it is not difficult to find the phase loss , occurring upon reflection , for a plane wave component .",
    "however , if we deal with a _ curved _ interface , the plane wave decomposition becomes useless as the plane wave components are no longer satisfying the matching conditions at the curved boundary .",
    "thus a straightforward extension of the method used in the planar interface can not be applied to understand the gh shift appearing along the curved boundary and it becomes necessary to provide a qualitative / quantitative description in such a case .",
    "the gh shift at a curved interface has been studied by a few authors and only for optical systems .",
    "the contribution of the gh shift in a resonance mode of a circular microcavity has been estimated by comparing the decay rate expected from a multiple reflection with the eigenvalue of a resonance mode @xcite .",
    "also , the deviation of an optical - beam path from the specular ray reflection has been discussed when an incident beam comes from outside the cavity and reaches the circular interface @xcite .",
    "in addition to the gh effect , the curvature of the boundary induces tunneling transmission which can not be observed with the simple planar interface .",
    "it will occur at a range of energy just higher than the height of the potential and corresponds to _ dynamical tunneling _",
    "@xcite , even though it can be interpreted as tunneling through the barrier of an effective 1d potential , as we shall see later on . it is noted that both the gh shift and the tunneling arise from the intrinsic nature of ( quantum ) waves and have no classical correspondence .",
    "recently , considerable efforts have been made to understand tunneling phenomena based on the associated classical dynamics in various systems such as quantum map @xcite , optical microcavities @xcite or quantum potentials @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we study the time evolution of wave packets in the 2d circular step potential .",
    "we investigate the quantum gh shift and the tunneling transmission observed in the wave packet dynamics . using the eigenmodes ( bound modes and resonance modes ) of the system introduced in section  [ sec : eigenmodes ]",
    ", we construct an initial wave packet located deep inside the circular cavity , and its subsequent time evolution is then described by the interference of simple oscillations in time of individual eigenmodes ( sec .",
    "[ sec : expansion ] ) .",
    "section  [ sec : gh_shift ] is dedicated to the gh shift .",
    "we evaluate the phase change upon reflection by modifying partly the effective potential derived from the 2d system .",
    "it follows from the assumption that the gh shift is relevant only to the barrier region of the potential .",
    "it is shown that the variation of the phase loss with respect to the energy is proportional to a time delay along the radial direction and is found to be consistent with the gh shift observed numerically . in section  [ sec : tunneling ] , we demonstrate that the transmitted ( tunneling ) wave packet exhibits a free - space image with a distance @xmath2 from the circular boundary .",
    "the distance @xmath2 can be understood as an average over individual distances @xmath3 given by the angular momentum conservation in the @xmath4-th resonance mode .",
    "then , we shall provide a qualitative explanation of the transmitted angle @xmath5 of the maximum tunneling direction in terms of the time delay of a 1d wave packet in a simplified 1d effective potential .",
