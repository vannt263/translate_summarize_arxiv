    "in the past decade it has become increasingly easier to tie an arbitrary optical field to a standard astrometric reference frame with arcsecond precision .",
    "with the recent publication of the usno - a2.0 astrometric catalog ( monet et al .",
    "1998 ) it is now possible to achieve @xmath0@xmath1 accuracy at any point on the sky .",
    "this greatly enhances the ability to search for optical counterparts of sources detected at other wavelengths .",
    "this new accuracy is particularly desirable when searching for radio sources , which typically have positions more accurate than is achievable for the optical frame ( see , e.g. , deutsch et al .",
    "in addition , the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ will for the first time provide x - ray positions with arcsecond accuracy , creating a need for better optical precision . indeed ,",
    "even if the internal precision of a radio or x - ray position is well understood , it is often difficult to obtain a quantitative estimate of the additional uncertainty introduced by the transfer of these coordinates to a given optical astrometric frame . for many problems",
    ", this component can be the dominant source of positional error .",
    "this work describes an empirical , uniform test of the astrometric accuracy of several well known databases containing astrometric information .",
    "the first astrometric catalog with full and dense sky coverage was the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) guide star catalog ( gsc ) , which is described in detail by lasker et al .",
    "some initial defects in version 1.0 of this catalog have been corrected in the version 1.1 release .",
    "the gsc contains some @xmath2 objects incompletely down to @xmath3 . as it is possible that a deep , small field ccd image may contain few , if any , unsaturated gsc stars , it is often necessary to refer directly to the guide star selection system ( gsss ) images , the plate data used to create the gsc itself . in the north ,",
    "19821985 epoch `` quick  v '' plates are used , and in the south , deeper 19741984 epoch uk serc j plates are used .",
    "each plate image is digitized to @xmath4 pixel@xmath5 , and the coefficients for a third order polynomial astrometric solution are included in the image header , defining the gsc astrometric frame .",
    "the astrometric accuracy of the gsss images is discussed by russell et al .",
    "although the gsc has been available on cd - rom for a decade , extractions from the gsss images themselves have only been accessible outside the stsci via the www ( http://archive.stsci.edu/ ) for the last few years .",
    "note that additional astrometric improvements are implemented in the gsc 1.2 release ( see rser et al .",
    "1997 ) but as these improvements are not easily incorporated into the gsss images , this catalog is not considered here .",
    "the next astrometric archive to become widely available was the digitized sky survey ( dss - i ) .",
    "this image dataset was distributed on 102 cd - roms after undergoing a lossy @xmath6 compression process . in the south , the uk serc j gsss images are used , while in the north , a digitization of the 19501956 epoch palomar observatory sky survey i ( poss - i ) e ( red ) plates is used , again at @xmath4 pixel@xmath5 . although the astrometric accuracy in the south is identical to that of the _ hst _ gsc , the astrometric accuracy of the dss - i in the north is acknowledged to be inferior to the gsc .",
    "the poss - i e data were selected for the dss - i because they are deeper than the `` quick v '' data , and comparably deep to the southern uk serc j images .",
    "the dss - i was a major milestone as it made a snapshot of the sky down to @xmath7 with embedded astrometric information available to anyone with access to the cd - rom set , or shortly thereafter , anyone with www access to the stsci or other sites where the survey data are available on - line . an assessment of the astrometric accuracy of the dss - i has been previously published by vron - cetty & vron ( 1996 ) , and a more detailed description of the dss - i itself can also be found therein .",
    "the palomar observatory sky survey ii ( poss - ii ) and the second epoch survey ( ses ) in the south are currently being processed to form the second digitized sky survey ( dss - ii ) .",
    "it contains a 1985 - 1997 epoch multicolor entire - sky survey using newer , better quality plates digitized to slightly more than @xmath8 pixel@xmath5 . while nearly all of the data have been obtained , only about 85% of the sky ( red plates only ) is available at the stsci www interface at the time of this writing , and it should be further emphasized that these images are being made available with prepublication status .",
    "the astrometric information assessed here is likely to change when the final product is available .",
    "recent status reports of the digitized poss - ii ( dposs ; does not include the ses ) have been presented by djorgovski et al .",
    "( 1997 , 1998 ) .",
    "the usno - a1.0 astrometric catalog ( monet et al . 1996 ) contains @xmath9 objects down to @xmath7 , detected on plates digitized by the naval observatory s precision measuring machine ( pmm ) . for @xmath10 , poss - i o and e plates",
    "are used , and for @xmath11 , uk serc - j and european southern observatory eso - r survey plates are used .",
    "only objects which are detected in _ both _ the red and blue plates ( within 1@xmath12 ) are included in the catalog , and the catalog positions are derived from the blue plates . both a blue and a red magnitude are also published for each object in this catalog , which is available in a 10 cd - rom set and via the www .",
    "the absolute astrometric frame is based on the _ hst _ gsc version 1.1 , and is therefore not significantly more accurate than the gsc . whereas the images discussed above come only with a single polynomial astrometric solution to describe the entire plate , the usno catalog positions are based on images which are described with a polynomial plus a correction map to compensate for the systematic errors inherent at the edges of the schmidt plates .",
    "this allows significantly better precision over the entire area of the plates .",
    "see also canzian ( 1997 ) for additional information .      the usno - a2.0 astrometric catalog ( monet et al . 1998 ) is based on the usno - a1.0 with a few important differences .",
    "the most important difference is that the absolute astrometric calibration is based on the international celestial reference frame ( icrf ) as realized by the usno act catalog ( urban et al .",
    "1998 ) , which itself is based on the tycho catalog ( esa 1997 ) , generated from the hipparcos mission .",
    "another important difference is the source of individual positions ; whereas the a1.0 gives blue plate positions , the a2.0 gives the average of the blue and red plate positions .",
    "poss - i o and e plates were typically obtained on the same night , but serc - j and eso - r plates were obtained at different epochs and thus the catalog position will place objects with proper motion at the average epoch of the two plates ; objects which have moved more than 1@xmath12 between the two epochs will not be included in the catalog at all .",
    "the alignment with the icrf makes the usno - a2.0 the most accurate astrometric catalog of faint stars , i.e. the stars likely to be found unsaturated on an arbitrary ccd image .",
    "this catalog is available on an 11 cd - rom set and via the www from the us naval observatory flagstaff station ( http://www.nofs.navy.mil/ ) .",
    "the image data used , which was digitized at about @xmath13 pixel@xmath5 , may also become remotely available in early 2000 .",
    "although not yet available at this time , the second guide star catalog ( gsc - ii ) will likely be available soon , and promises to provide positions comparably accurate to the usno - a2.0 , as well as magnitudes , colors and proper motions .",
    "this catalog will be based on the dss - ii plate material , and the first epoch for the proper motion measurements will be based on the dss - i plates .",
    "the gsc - ii is merely mentioned here as a future valuable resource for completeness and is not discussed further . for additional information on the construction and status of the gsc - ii ,",
    "see mclean et al .",
    "( 1997 , 1998 ) .",
    "to assess the astrometric accuracy of these databases , a dataset of objects with extremely accurate radio positions is obtained from ma et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , who present a careful derivation of vlbi positions , most of which have milliarcsecond ( mas ) accuracy , for 608 extragalactic radio sources in the icrf .",
    "these sources are grouped into three classes , of which all are used in this work .",
    "the handful of sources which have positional uncertainties larger than 30 mas are not used .",
    "the sources are fairly evenly distributed over the entire sky .",
    "the right ascension zero point has been aligned to the icrf which is consistent with the fk5 j2000.0 optical frame .    for each of these sources , a small 1@xmath141@xmath15 region about each position is extracted from the usno - a2.0 catalog and the dss - i images .",
    "the images are examined individually , and those optical counterparts which are not suitable for this study are thrown out . briefly , 62 sources are somewhat subjectively deemed too faint for an accurate centroid based on the dss - i image ( not quite the same data as used to create the catalog , however ) ; 64 sources are too crowded by neighbors or too extended ; 136 sources were too faint and not even in the usno - a2.0 catalog ; 63 sources were not present in the usno - a2.0 catalog but yet appeared to have sufficient signal in the dss - i images that they probably ought to have been .",
    "this leaves a dataset of 283 sources for which the data are acceptable in at least some of the databases discussed here .",
    "the datasets used for testing of the various databases are sometimes reduced further .",
    "for the three imaging databases , a minimum of 20,000 adu ( `` counts '' ) within a @xmath16 aperture is required ; for example this reduces the dataset used for the gsss images by 41 sources as the northern `` quick v '' images are not as deep as the dss - i images .",
    "two of the 283 sources are not in the usno - a1.0 catalog ( in fact those particular fields contain far fewer sources in the a1.0 than a2.0 overall ) .",
    "as noted before , not all of the dss - ii images are yet available on - line , and thus the accuracy of the dss - ii was only assessed with the 235 sources for which a good dss - ii detection was available .",
    "for the 283 sources , positions from all the available databases , either directly from a catalog or centroided on an image , are recorded along with the radio coordinates of ma et al .",
    "( 1998 ) for later inspection .",
    "the total flux of the sources is also measured using simple aperture photometry within a @xmath16 radius .    in the fields of @xmath17 of the radio sources , a set of isolated , easily measurable reference stars with usno @xmath18",
    "is selected to transfer the usno - a2.0 astrometric frame to each of the three images .",
    "the transfer fit usually employs @xmath19 stars , depending on the field density , and yields an uncertainty in the transfer of @xmath20@xmath21 .",
    "the transferred solution is a simple linear solution ( sufficient for the small 10@xmath1410@xmath15 fields used for this purpose ) derived with a least - squares fit using procedures from the idl _ astronomy user s library _ ( landsman 1993 ) and written in idl by the author .",
    "the coordinates of each optical counterpart are then also recorded using the transferred solution .",
    "using the optical positions of these extragalactic radio sources measured in these various ways , the distribution of the deviation from the radio positions is examined . in table 1 relevant derived parameters from these distributions are listed for the different databases .",
    "each astrometric database is listed in column 1 .",
    "columns 23 list the average @xmath22 and @xmath23 , indicating any global shift from the icrf . in columns 4 through 6",
    "the maximum observed @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24r ( @xmath25 ) errors in arcseconds within the best 68 percent of the respective distributions are given .",
    "the next four sets of 3 columns list similar values within the 90 , 95 , 99 , and 100 percentiles , where the latter means all of the sources . the number of sources examined for each database is provided in the last column . for example , for the usno - a2.0 , 90% of the 283 objects examined differed radially from the radio position by less than or equal to @xmath26 . similarly , 90% of the 283 objects ( but not necessarily the same 90% as above ) differed in @xmath27 by less than or equal to @xmath28 .",
    "these results will be discussed for the various databases in turn .",
    "the usno - a2.0 is clearly superior to the other frames considered here .",
    "the average @xmath22 and @xmath23 are quite small but yet deviate from 0.0 in a marginally significant way .",
    "the astrometric uncertainties are better than the other databases by nearly a factor of 3 , with @xmath29 , 90% confidence at @xmath26 , and even @xmath30 .",
    "in fact , the largest observed discrepancy in this sample of 283 sources is @xmath31 ! this is quite remarkable given the possibility of true misalignment between a radio source and a slightly extended optical galaxy , not readily discernible as extended on the low spatial resolution dss - i images . a brief examination of this most discrepant source , 0458020 , yields no anomalies in the images and is cataloged as a high-@xmath32 qso , and thus not likely to suffer from intrinsic radio / optical misalignment .",
    "centroiding errors probably also contribute to these overall uncertainties in addition to local frame offset errors , but it is the combined effect that it most relevant in most cases .    in fig .",
    "1 the distribution of discrepancies is plotted against a variety of other parameters .",
    "the first panel depicts the discrepancies in @xmath22 and @xmath23 in arcseconds , in the sense that the radio coordinate is subtracted from the optical coordinate .",
    "the distribution is quite tight and slightly offset from the center .",
    "a fiducial @xmath1 radius circle is overplotted .",
    "the second panel shows the combined ( radial ) discrepancy ( @xmath24r ) vs. declination ; no declination region is apparently worse than others , even near the poles .",
    "the third panel shows @xmath24r vs. the distance of the source from the plate center on the dss - i images , which is mostly the same plate material as used to create the usno - a2.0 .",
    "the units are in @xmath4 pixels as encoded in the image headers .",
    "the horizontal solid line is simply the @xmath1 fiducial .",
    "the vertical dashed line indicates the approximate useful half width of the plates .",
    "clearly the astrometric solution is essentially as good near the edges of the plate as near the center .",
    "the fourth panel shows @xmath24r vs. the usno @xmath33 magnitude . it does appear that the faintest stars post slightly worse values . if all stars @xmath34 are excluded , the resulting errors are @xmath35 better for the new sample of 225 objects ( see table 1 ) . in the fifth panel @xmath24r",
    "is plotted vs. the usno @xmath36 color .",
    "even the bluest and reddest objects show no obviously greater errors than the others .",
    "finally in the last panel @xmath24r is plotted vs. @xmath37 within a @xmath16 aperture around the source in the dss - i image ; this is not directly indicative of the brightness in the images used to create the a2.0 , but a reasonably good estimate of it .",
    "a similar figure is generated for each of the databases examined .",
    "they are not all reproduced here , but are available from the author .",
    "figure 2 displays the distributions of @xmath22 and @xmath23 in arcseconds for the usno - a2.0 283 object sample .",
    "the slight average offsets evident in table 1 can also be readily seen here and appear to be significant .",
    "the reason for this systematic offset remains unclear .",
    "certainly for program objects of color significantly different from the typical usno - a2.0 star , atmospheric differential refraction must play some role .",
    "the usno - a1.0 catalog is worse than the a2.0 by nearly a factor of 3 , and shows similar results as the gsss images , not surprising as the a1.0 is based on the absolute astrometric calibration of the gsss / gsc .",
    "the results are probably slightly better due to improved plate distortion corrections . a set of plots like fig .",
    "1 for this database turns up nothing unusual .",
    "the gsss images provide the next best astrometric database .",
    "it is still in use for _ hst _ observation planning .",
    "russell et al .",
    "( 1990 ) assessed the astrometric accuracy of the gsc and gsss images . using a small sample of 48 extragalactic radio sources , they derived @xmath38 , @xmath39 , although the values were better in the north .",
    "however , with their much larger `` camc '' sample , they find for the whole plate @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and slightly better , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , for the inner 50% of plates .",
    "this compares favorably to the @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 values derived here , and lends considerable confidence that the reduction described herein is accurate .",
    "the dss - i begins with a reasonably good @xmath47 astrometric uncertainty but degrades at @xmath48% confidence to the worst statistics of the group .",
    "the worst offset ( for the object 0202 + 319 ) is @xmath49 .",
    "the accuracy in the south is identical to that of the gsss images , as they are the same data . in the north ,",
    "the poss e images have inferior astrometric fit quality , as is noted in the documents which come with the cd - roms , although it is perhaps not widely appreciated how far off the astrometry can be . a figure like fig .",
    "1 for this dataset indicates that the worst discrepancies lie near the outer edges of the plates .",
    "if all sources greater than 4500 pixels ( @xmath50 ) from the plate centers are excluded , the sample of 144 remaining objects shows a somewhat better distribution as seen in table 1 .",
    "clearly , positions derived from the dss - i should be treated with caution as there is a potential to be several arcseconds in error in the north . a far more detailed discussion of the dss - i astrometric accuracy is presented by vron - cetty & vron ( 1996 ) .",
    "they derive similar uncertainties as in table 1 and derive some corrections .      immediately noticeable in the dss - ii row in table 1 are the large @xmath20@xmath22@xmath51 , @xmath20@xmath23@xmath51 . in the plot like fig .",
    "1a for the dss - ii it is immediately evident that most sources exhibit a ( @xmath52 ) offset .",
    "as the pixelsize is @xmath53 it is likely that this is due to a one pixel offset somewhere in the pipeline which generates the astrometric solution for these images .",
    "it is , however , also readily evident that a smaller subset of discrepancies do lie about ( 0,0 ) and thus some images may not suffer from this defect .",
    "for this reason , it may not be prudent to simply apply this offset to the images .",
    "a second set of statistics is generated for the dss - ii with all source ( @xmath54 ) positions adjusted by ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "the result is better , but still not as good as the gsss image or usno catalogs .",
    "it should be stressed that these results are derived from the prepublication data available at this time , and the astrometry in the final product may be significantly improved .",
    "the uncertainties involved in obtaining an icrf position for an extragalactic point source from the usno - a2.0 catalog is now fairly well established .",
    "the positions of objects in the galaxy with known proper motion can also readily determined , although determining the exact epoch of the a2.0 positions is nontrivial ( the epoch for each field is available in a separate catalog at the nofs www site ) . for objects with unknown proper motion , the uncertainties must be estimated on a case by case basis , depending on the data available .",
    "the remaining case is for objects simply not listed in the usno - a2.0 catalog , for whatever reason .",
    "since large telescopes with modern detectors can go much fainter than the a2.0 is a relatively short time , this is actually a frequent issue . obtaining coordinates for such objects",
    "is easily done by fitting an astrometric solution to the new image using an input list of usno - a2.0 ( @xmath54 ) and image ( x , y ) positions for a set of stars common to both the catalog and the image .",
    "given a few tens of reference stars , the final uncertainty in the transferred solution due to centroiding errors can easily be less than @xmath21 . however , if the epoch of the usno - a2.0 and image data differ significantly , the small proper motions of the reference stars will dominate the uncertainty .",
    "stars with large proper motions can , of course , be easily rejected from the fit . if the directions of motions of the reference stars are mostly random , the residuals are merely inflated .",
    "the worst scenario is where the tiny proper motions of many reference stars yield a small systematic shift due to galactic rotation .",
    "this can be beneficial for stars moving with the reference stars , but is detrimental to determining positions of extragalactic objects , or objects otherwise not associated with the bulk motion . in an effort to quantify the uncertainties in determining positions of extragalactic objects not available in the usno - a2.0 , an a2.0 solution is transferred to several of the database images used here and the resulting position of the radio source counterpart measured as described in  2 . the results for the dss - ii images may be most relevant as they have fairly recent epochs and",
    "are better sampled and deeper than the other images used here .",
    "the results of this effort are tabulated in the last three rows of table 1 , where column 1 lists the source database which is aligned to the usno - a2.0 .",
    "the results yield a @xmath56% degradation over the a2.0 itself , which is quite respectable given that the difference in epoch between a2.0 images and dss - ii images can be up to 40 years . for many applications",
    "these larger values will be a better estimate of the true uncertainty of measured positions based on , but not directly from , the usno - a2.0 .",
    "in closing the reader is reminded that many precise positions are still found in b1950 , and special care must be taken when converting them to j2000 if subarcsecond accuracy is important .",
    "some generic precession utilities do not perform the necessary fk4 to fk5 correction , and the resulting improperly converted positions may be in error by @xmath57",
