    "the lattice action we use is designed for finite temperature monte carlo simulations . in the gauge sector",

    "that we add an improvement term which restores the rotational symmetry of the free quark propagator on the lattice up to order @xmath3 in the momentum @xmath4 @xcite . in order to improve the flavor symmetry ,",
    "which is violated in the staggered fermion formulation , we smear the gauge field which is used in the standard part of the fermion action .",
    "the procedure involves either only three link terms ( p4fat3 ) or up to seven link terms @xcite ( p4fat7 ) .",
    "while the p4fat3 action was used for thermodynamical calculation earlier @xcite , the combination of the p4-term and seven link smearing is used here for the first time in thermodynamic calculations @xcite .",
    "we perform simulations with three degenerate quark flavors as well as with 2 light and one heavy quark flavor .",
    "the lattices have temporal extent @xmath5 , which corresponds at the critical temperature ( @xmath6 ) to a lattice spacing of @xmath7  fm and @xmath8  fm respectively .",
    "the lattice extent in spacial direction is @xmath9 . to determine the scale",
    ", we perform zero temperature simulations on @xmath10 lattices .",
    "these calculations are being performed on the qcdoc teraflops computers at bnl .",
    "the observables we calculate at present are the gauge action , the polyakov loop and the chiral condensate . for each of these quantities",
    "we calculate also its susceptibility . using the multi - histogram reweighting technique",
    "@xcite we combine the statistics of monte carlo runs at different couplings @xmath11 .",
    "results for the chiral condensate and chiral susceptibility of the p4fat7 action in the case of three degenerate flavors and @xmath12 are shown in fig .",

    "data points are the individual monte carlo runs ; solid curves are from multi - histogram reweighting.[fig_pbp],scaledwidth=100.0% ]    as expected the chiral transition becomes more pronounced for smaller quark masses .",
    "the peak heights of the susceptibilities increase and a volume dependence becomes visible .",
    "we define the critical couplings ( @xmath13 ) as the peak positions of the chiral susceptibilities . however , we find that the peak positions of all susceptibilities agree within our statistical accuracy . in fig .",

    "we find that the separation between the @xmath12 and @xmath14 critical lines is much smaller for the p4fat7 action than for the p4fat3 action .",
    "in fact , for small quark masses the critical couplings for @xmath12 and 6 almost coincide which suggests the presence of a nearby bulk transition in the parameter space defined by the p4fat7 couplings .",
    "this also leads to the onset of first order transitions at pion mass values larger than those found for the p4fat3 action .",
    "all this makes the p4fat7 action less suitable for studies of thermodynamics as the extrapolation to the continuum limit will become more difficult , i.e. will require larger @xmath15 .",
    "the two @xmath16-flavor lines shown in fig .  [ fig_betac](left ) are lines at constant strange quark mass .",
    "the lines corresponds to @xmath17 and @xmath18 for the lower and upper curve respectively .",
    "a bare strange quark mass of @xmath17 approximately corresponds to the physical strange quark mass .    at each critical coupling @xmath13",
    "we perform a zero temperature scale setting calculation on a @xmath10 lattice , where we calculate hadron masses and heavy quark potentials . from the potential we extract the sommer scale @xmath19 as well as the string tension @xmath20 by fitting the lattice data with the usual ansatz @xmath21 .",
    "we show some preliminary results of the critical temperature in units of the string tension in fig .",

    "the quark mass dependence of the critical temperature for p4fat3 , @xmath12 and @xmath22 is consistent with the earlier calculations @xcite .",
    "the chiral extrapolation of @xmath23 with @xmath24 yields results consistent with earlier findings of @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "the chiral extrapolation for p4fat7 gives smaller values : @xmath26 and @xmath27 for @xmath12 and @xmath14 respectively .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath15 dependence of the transition temperature is much stronger for p4fat7 than for p4fat3 .",
    "this again indicates a possible bulk transition in the vicinity of the chiral limit of the p4fat7 action .",
    "the still ongoing determination of the critical temperature is part of a detailed study of the thermodynamics of ( 2 + 1)-flavor qcd .",
    "as soon as we have reliable chiral extrapolations for @xmath12 and @xmath14 we will add a @xmath15=8 calculation at selected quark mass values and try to perform the extrapolation to the continuum limit .",
    "moreover we will perform a study of the equation of state with an almost realistic quark mass spectrum .",
