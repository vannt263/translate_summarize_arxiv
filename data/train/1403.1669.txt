    "the focus of this paper is the development of a precise asymptotic description of the distribution of a multidimensional regularly varying random walk ( the precise meaning of which is given in section [ sectionis ] ) conditioned on hitting a rare target set represented as the union of half spaces .",
    "in particular , we develop tractable total variation approximations ( in the sample path space ) , based on change - of - measure techniques , for such conditional stochastic processes . using these approximations we are able to obtain , as a corollary , joint conditional limit theorems of specific objects such as the time until ruin , a brownian approximation up to ( just before ) the time of ruin , the `` overshoot '' , and the `` undershoot '' .",
    "this is the first paper , as far as we know , that develops refined conditional limit theorems in a multidimensional ruin setting ; results in one dimensional settings include , for instance , @xcite ; see also @xcite for extensions concerning regenerative processes .",
    "the techniques developed to obtain our results are also different from those prevalent in the literature and interesting qualitative features arise in multidimensional settings . for instance , surprisingly , the asymptotic conditional time to ruin is no longer purely pareto , as in the one dimensional case . a slowly - varying correction is needed in the multidimensional setting .",
    "other results in the case of multidimensional regularly varying random walks have been obtained by using a weak convergence approach ( see @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast to the weak convergence approach , which has been applied to non - markovian settings @xcite , the techniques that we present here appear to be suited primarily to markovian settings . on the other hand , the approach that we shall demonstrate allows to obtain finer approximations to conditional objects , for instance , total variation approximations , and conditional central limit theorems .",
    "moreover , the present approach has also been applied to non - regularly varying heavy - tailed settings , at least in one dimension ( see @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , if there is a need to improve upon the quality of the approximations the method that we advocate readily provides monte carlo algorithms that can be shown to be optimal in a sense of controlling the relative mean squared error uniformly in the underlying large deviations parameter ( see @xcite ) .",
    "standard approximation techniques for heavy - tailed large deviations can not be easily translated into efficient monte carlo algorithms ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the multidimensional problem that we consider here is a natural extension of the classical one dimensional random ruin problem in a so - called renewal risk model ( cf .",
    "the texts of @xcite ) . we consider a @xmath0-dimensional regularly varying random walk @xmath1 with @xmath2 and drift @xmath3 so that @xmath4 . define @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the union of half spaces and @xmath7 points to the interior of some open cone that does not intersect @xmath6 .",
    "the paper @xcite notes that @xmath8 corresponds to the ruin probabilities for insurance companies with several lines of business . using natural budget constraints related to the amount of money that can be transferred from one business line to another",
    ", it turns out that the target set takes precisely the form of the union of half spaces as we consider here .",
    "our goal is to illustrate new techniques that can be used to describe very precisely the conditional distribution of the heavy - tailed processes given @xmath9 .",
    "our approximations allow to obtain , in a relatively easy way , extensions of previous results in the literature that apply only in the one dimensional settings .",
    "asmussen and klppelberg @xcite provide conditional limit theorems for the overshoot , the undershoot , and the time until ruin given the eventual occurrence of ruin .",
    "similar results have been obtained recently in the context of levy processes ( see @xcite and references there in ) .",
    "we apply our results here to obtain multidimensional analogues of their conditional limit theorems and additional refinements , such as conditional central limit theorems .",
    "our general strategy is based on the use of a suitable change of measure and later on coupling arguments .",
    "the idea is to approximate the conditional distribution of the underlying process step - by - step , in a markovian way , using a mixture of a large increment that makes the random walk hit the target set and an increment that follows the nominal ( original ) distribution .",
    "the mixture probability is chosen depending on the current position of the random walk .",
    "intuitively , given the current position , the selection of the mixture probability must correspond to the conditional probability of reaching the target set in the immediate next step given that one will eventually reach the target set .",
    "the conditional distribution itself is also governed by a markov process , so the likelihood ratio ( or radon  nikodym derivative ) between the conditional distribution and our approximating distribution can be explicitly written in terms of the ratios of the corresponding markov kernels . by showing that the second moment of the likelihood ratio between the conditional distribution and our approximating distribution approaches unity as the rarity parameter @xmath10 we can reach the desired total variation approximation ( cf .",
    "lemma [ tv1 ] ) . a crucial portion of our strategy involves precisely obtaining a good upper bound on the second moment of the likelihood ratio . the likelihood ratio is obtained out of a markovian representation of two measures . it is natural to develop a lyapunov - type criterion for the analysis of the second moment .",
    "this approach is pursued in section [ seclbtv ] , where we introduce our lyapunov criterion and develop the construction of the associated lyapunov function which allows us to bound the second moment of the likelihood ratio of interest as a function of the initial state of the process .",
    "there are several interesting methodological aspects of our techniques that are worth emphasizing .",
    "first , the application of change - of - measure ideas is common in the light - tailed settings .",
    "however , it is not at all standard in heavy - tailed settings .",
    "a second interesting methodological aspect of our technique is the construction of the associated lyapunov function .",
    "this step often requires a substantial amount of ingenuity . in",
    "the heavy - tailed setting , as we explain in section  [ seclbtv ] , we can take advantage of the fluid heuristics and asymptotic approximations for this construction .",
    "this approach was introduced in @xcite and has been further studied in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in fact , many of our ideas are borrowed from the rare - event simulation literature , which is not surprising given that our strategy involves precisely the construction of a suitable change of measure and these types of constructions , in turn , lie at the heart of importance sampling techniques .",
    "the particular change of measure that we use is inspired by the work of @xcite who applied it to the setting of one dimensional ( finite ) sums of regularly varying increments .",
    "the approximation constructed in this paper is tractable in the sense that it is given by a markovian description which is easy to describe and is explicit in terms of the increment distribution of the associated random walk ( see ( [ dkt ] ) and theorem [ thmmain1 ] ) .",
    "this tractability property has useful consequences both in terms of the methodological techniques and practical use . from a methodological standpoint , given the change - of - measure that we use to construct our markovian description ( basically following ( [ dka ] ) ) , the result of convergence in total variation provides a very precise justification of the intuitive mechanism which drives the ruin in the heavy - tailed situations .",
    "in addition , the result allows to directly use this intuitive mechanism to provide functional probabilistic descriptions that , while less precise than total variation approximations , emphasize the most important elements that are present at the temporal scales at which ruin is expected to occur ( if it happens at all ) .",
    "these functional results are given in theorem [ thmmain2 ] .",
    "our total variation approximation ( theorem [ thmmain1 ] ) allows to construct a very natural coupling which makes the functional probabilistic descriptions given in theorem [ thmmain2 ] relatively straightforward in view of standard strong brownian approximation results for random walks .",
    "the tractability of our total variation approximation allows for a deep study of the random walk conditioned on bankruptcy , as mentioned earlier , via efficient monte carlo simulation , at scales that are finer than those provided by the existing functional limit theorems ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . using the techniques that we pursue here , the results in @xcite",
    "establish _ necessary and sufficient _",
    "conditions for optimal estimation of conditional expectations given bankruptcy using importance sampling ; surprisingly , one can ensure finite expected termination time and asymptotically optimal relative variance control even when the zero variance change of measure has infinite expected termination time .    as mentioned earlier ,",
    "we believe that the techniques that we consider here can find potential applications in markovian settings beyond random walks .",
    "this is a research avenue that we are currently exploring ; see , for instance , @xcite , where we apply similar techniques to multi - queues .",
    "additional results will be reported in the future .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sectionis ]",
    "we explain our assumptions , describe our approximating process , and state our main results .",
    "the estimates showing total variation approximation , which are based on the use of lyapunov inequalities , are given in section [ seclbtv ] .",
    "finally , the development of conditional functional central limit theorems is given in section [ sectcclt ] .",

    "regularly varying random vectors taking values in @xmath12 .",
    "let @xmath13 be a generic random variable equal in distribution to @xmath14 .",
    "the random vector @xmath13 is said to have a multivariate regularly varying distribution if there exists a sequence @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and a non - null random measure @xmath17 on the compactified and punctured space @xmath18 with @xmath19 such that , as @xmath20 @xmath21 where `` @xmath22 '' refers to vague convergence .",

    "@xmath26 is chosen such that @xmath27 and with this choice of @xmath26 we have that @xmath28 .",
    "the random vector @xmath13 has a relatively very small probability of jumping into sets for which @xmath29 .",
    "if @xmath30 for some @xmath31 and a slowly varying function @xmath32 ( i.e. , @xmath33 as @xmath34 for each @xmath35 ) , then we say that @xmath36 has ( regularly varying ) index  @xmath37 .",
    "for further information on multivariate regular variation see @xcite ; the definition provided above corresponds to the representation in theorem 6.1 , page 173 , in @xcite .",

    "let @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "we define @xmath45 we set @xmath46 and write @xmath47 @xmath48 .",
    "note that@xmath49 where@xmath50 finally , put @xmath51 we are concerned with the asymptotic conditional distribution of @xmath52 given that @xmath53 as @xmath54 . throughout this paper , we impose the following two assumptions .    [ ass1 ] @xmath55 has a continuous regularly varying distribution with index @xmath56 and @xmath57 , where @xmath58 .",
    "[ ass2 ] for each @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "assumption [ ass1 ] indicates that @xmath55 has a continuous distribution .",
    "this can be dispensed by applying a smoothing kernel in the definition of the function @xmath62 introduced later .",
    "the assumption that @xmath63 is equivalent ( up to a rotation and a multiplication of a scaling factor ) to @xmath64 , so nothing has been lost by imposing this condition .",
    "we also assume that @xmath60 for each @xmath59 ; this , again , can always be achieved without altering the problem structure by multiplying the vector @xmath65 and @xmath66 by a positive factor as long as @xmath67 .",
    "now , given that the random walk has drift @xmath7 , it is not difficult to see geometrically that some conditions must be imposed on the @xmath68 s in order to have a meaningful large deviations situation ( i.e. , @xmath69 as @xmath70 ) . in particular , we must have that @xmath6 does not intersect the ray @xmath71",
    ". otherwise , the law of large numbers might eventually let the process hit the set @xmath72 .",
    "however , avoiding intersection with the ray @xmath71 is not enough to rule out some degenerate situations .",
    "for instance , suppose that @xmath73 with @xmath74 ( i.e. , the face of @xmath75is parallel to @xmath7 ) ; in this case central limit theorem - type fluctuations might eventually make the random walk hit the target set .",
    "therefore , in order to rule out these types of degenerate situations one requires @xmath67 .    as mentioned earlier , we are interested in providing a tractable asymptotic description of the conditional distribution of @xmath76 given that @xmath77 as @xmath78 . it is well known that , given @xmath77 , the process @xmath52 is markovian with transition kernel given by@xmath79 note that @xmath80 is a well defined markov transition kernel because of the ( harmonic ) relationship @xmath81=e\\bigl[u_{b}^{\\ast } ( s+x_{1 } ) \\bigr].\\ ] ] the transition kernel @xmath80 is the doob s @xmath82-transform of the original random walk kernel ( the name @xmath82-transform is given after the harmonic property of the positive function @xmath83 ) .",
    "the markov kernel @xmath80 generates a measure @xmath84 on the @xmath85-field @xmath86 generated by the @xmath87 s up to time @xmath88 .",
    "our goal is to construct a _",

    ", we omit the index @xmath94 in the notation of @xmath92 and @xmath93 when it does not cause confusion .    by tractability",
    "we mean that the @xmath95 is constructed by a markov transition kernel that can , in principle , be computed directly from the increment distribution of the random walk . the transition kernel associated to @xmath95 will be relatively easy to manipulate and it will be explicit in terms of the associated increment distribution . together with the strong mode of convergence implied in ( [ tv1 ] ) , we will be able to provide refinements to common results that are found in the literature concerning conditional limit theorems of specific quantities of interest ( cf .",

    "if assumptions [ ass1 ] and [ ass2 ] are in place , it is well known that ( see @xcite and @xcite)@xmath100 as @xmath54 , uniformly over @xmath90 in compact sets .",
    "this result , together with the form of the @xmath82-transform , suggests defining the kernel@xmath101 where@xmath102 is introduced to make @xmath103 a well defined markov transition kernel .",
    "it is reasonable to expect that @xmath104 and the corresponding probability measure on the sample path space , which we denote by @xmath105 , will provide good approximations to both @xmath80 and @xmath106 .",
    "this approach is natural and it has been successfully applied in the one dimensional setting in the context of subexponential increment distributions in @xcite . however , in the multidimensional setting it is not entirely straightforward to evaluate and manipulate either @xmath107 or @xmath108 .",
    "therefore , we shall follow a somewhat different approach .",
    "our strategy is inspired by the way in which ruin is intuitively expected to occur in the context of heavy - tailed increments ; namely , the underlying random walk proceeds according to its nominal dynamics and all of a sudden a large jump occurs which causes ruin .",
    "this intuition is made more precise by the form of the kernel@xmath109 \\\\[-8pt ] \\nonumber & = & p ( x+s_{0}\\in \\mathrm{d}s_{1 } ) \\biggl\\ { p_{b } ( s_{0 } ) \\frac{i ( x+s_{0}\\in ba^{\\ast } ) } { p ( x+s_{0}\\in ba^{\\ast } ) } + \\bigl ( 1-p_{b } ( s_{0 } ) \\bigr ) \\biggr\\ } , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath110 will be suitably chosen so that @xmath111 in other words , @xmath112 is a mixture involving both the ruinous and the regular components .",

    "we will not work directly with @xmath114  to avoid some uniform integrability issues that arise in testing the lyapunov bound to be described later in lemma [ lemlb ] .",
    "the definition of @xmath113 requires a modification of the target set .",
    "this modification will be convenient because of two reasons : first , to localize the analysis of our lyapunov functions only in a suitable compact region that scales according to the parameter @xmath94 ; second , to apply a taylor expansion in combination with the dominated convergence theorem .",
    "the taylor expansion will be applied to a mollified version of the function @xmath115 in the verification of the lyapunov bound .",
    "first , given any @xmath116 we define @xmath117 , and observe that @xmath118 .",
    "we then write , given @xmath119 , @xmath120 to simplify the notation let @xmath121 be the vector whose @xmath122th component is equal to one and the rest of the components are zero , and express @xmath123 in the same form as we do for @xmath6 .",

    "the scalar @xmath144 eventually will be chosen arbitrarily close to 1 .",
    "as we indicated before , in order to follow the intuitive description of the most likely way in which large deviations occur in heavy - tailed settings , we should guide the selection of @xmath110 via ( [ eqpb ] ) .    using ( [ hultb ] ) and our considerations about @xmath145 , we have that as @xmath146@xmath147 the underlying approximation ( [ d-1 ] ) deteriorates when @xmath148 is not too big or , equivalently , as @xmath149 approaches the target set @xmath150 .",
    "in this situation , it is not unlikely that the nominal dynamics will make the process hit @xmath150 .",
