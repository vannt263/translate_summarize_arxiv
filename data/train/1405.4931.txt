    "perturbations around black holes have been intriguing objects of discussions for decades .",
    "one of the main reasons is their astrophysical interest .",
    "real black holes always have interactions with the respective astrophysical environment through absorption or evaporation processes .",
    "starting from analyses of the perturbations around black holes , we can inquire about their stability .",
    "if black holes are unstable under small perturbations , they will inevitably be destabilized and disappear or transform dynamically into another object , thus they simply can not exist in nature as it is originally defined .",
    "for the ( 3 + 1)-dimensional asymptotically flat black holes , such as schwarzschild , reissner - nordstrm ( rn ) and kerr black holes , the corresponding stability has been checked thoroughly against different kinds of perturbations including neutral scalar , electromagnetic and gravitational perturbations and they were found stable .",
    "analyses of these perturbations and proofs of stability of ( 3 + 1)-dimensional schwarzschild - de sitter ( ds ) , rn - ds , and kerr - ds black holes have been reported .",
    "recently , motivated by the discovery of the correspondence between physics in the anti - de sitter ( ads ) spacetime and conformal field theory ( cft ) on its boundary ( ads / cft ) , the perturbations around four - dimensional ads black holes have been examined and ( 3 + 1)-dimensional ads black holes were found stable under neutral scalar , electromagnetic and gravitational perturbations .",
    "it was concluded that all of the considered four - dimensional black holes tested for stability are stable , except the string theory generalization of kerr - newman black holes whose stabilities have not been tested due to the difficulty in decoupling the angular variables in their perturbation equations . for a review on this topic , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "the physics in higher dimensions is much richer .",
    "in contrast to the four - dimensional results , various instabilities have been found . in a wide class of @xmath2 configurations , such as black strings and black branes , the gregory - laflamme instability against linear perturbations was disclosed @xcite . for high - dimensional black holes in the einstein - gauss - bonnet theory , it was found that instabilities occur at higher multipoles @xmath3 , while the first few lowest multipoles are stable @xcite .",
    "recently , in the high - dimensional rn - ds black hole background , numerical investigations have uncovered the surprising result that the rn black holes in ds backgrounds are unstable for spacetime dimensions larger than six @xcite .",
    "the dynamical perturbations of a black hole background can usually be described by a single wavelike equation , where a growing mode of the perturbation indicates the instability of the black hole .",
    "besides such a procedure , there also exists a superradiant instability in the black hole spacetime . considering the classical scattering problem for a perturbation field in a black hole background",
    ", we can have superradiance , a phenomenon where the reflected wave has larger amplitude than the incident wave .",
    "if the effective potential contains an extra local minimum out of the black hole in addition to the local maximum , the superradiance will get successively amplified in the valley of the local potential near the black hole , which will result in the superradiant instability destabilizing the black hole .",
    "reviews of the superradiance stability can be found in refs .",
    "most investigations on the superradiant instability were concentrated on the rotating black holes .",
    "recently , the discussions of the superradiant stability were extended to the charged black holes with charged scalar field perturbations @xcite .",
    "it was found that the superradiant instability can happen more efficiently when one considers charged black holes and charged scalar fields @xcite .",
    "it would be of great interest to extend the study of the superradiant stability to black holes in the real universe , namely the black hole in the ds backgrounds",
    ".    we will study small charged scalar field perturbations in the vicinity of a ( 3 + 1)-dimensional rn black hole in a de sitter background by doing numerical calculations .",
    "the stability of such black holes under charged scalar perturbations has never been examined previously . in the ads",
    "spacetime , it was observed that the ( 3 + 1)-dimensional rn - ads black hole can become unstable due to the condensation of the charged scalar hair onto the black hole and finally the ads black hole can be destabilized under a small charged scalar field perturbation @xcite .",
    "does this observed instability occur only for the ads black holes because of their special spacetime properties ?",
    "will the dynamical stability also happen in other four - dimensional black hole backgrounds ?",
    "it is of great interest to test whether the ( 3 + 1)-dimensional rn - ds black hole can remain stable as other four - dimensional black holes under such charged scalar perturbing fields .",
    "this is the first motivation of the present paper . besides",
    ", we would like to explore whether the stability against linearized dynamical perturbations relates to the superradiant stability due to the superradiant amplification of charged scalar waves .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we review the ( 3 + 1)-dimensional rn - ds black hole background and give the radial wave equation for a charged scalar field perturbation . in sec .",
    "iii we use the finite difference method to study the time - domain perturbation evolution of the charged scalar field and test the stability against such perturbations . in sec .",
    "iv , we derive the superradiant condition for the four - dimensional rn - ds black hole under a charged scalar perturbation , and examine the relation between the dynamic stability and the superradiant stability .",
    "finally , we provide conclusions in sec .",
    "we use natural units with @xmath4 .",
    "we consider charged massive scalar field perturbation in the rn - ds black hole background with the metric @xmath5 where @xmath6 the integration constants @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the black hole mass and electric charge , respectively .",
    "@xmath9 is the positive cosmological constant .",
    "the spacetime causal structure depends strongly on the zeros of @xmath10 .",
    "depending on the parameters @xmath11 and @xmath9 , the function @xmath10 can have one to three or even no real positive zeros ( for a negative cosmological constant ) . for the rn - ds cases we are interested in , @xmath10 has three real , positive roots @xmath12 , and a real and negative root @xmath13 .",
    "the horizons @xmath14 are denoted as black hole cauchy , event , and cosmological horizons respectively , which satisfy @xmath15 .",
    "the metric function @xmath10 can be expressed as , @xmath16 introducing the surface gravity @xmath17 associated with the horizon @xmath18 , we can write the inverse of the metric function @xmath19 thus we can obtain the analytic form of the tortoise coordinate by calculating @xmath20 , @xmath21 it is easy to see that @xmath22 as @xmath23 and @xmath24 as @xmath25 .",
    "consider now a charged scalar perturbation field @xmath26 obeying the klein - gordon equation @xmath27\\psi=0\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are , respectively , the charge and mass of the perturbing field and @xmath30 denotes the electromagnetic potential of the black hole . by adopting the usual separation of variables in terms of a radial field and a spherical harmonic @xmath31 , the schrdinger - type equations in the tortoise",
    "coordinate for each value of @xmath3 read @xmath32 where @xmath33 and the effective potential @xmath34 is given by @xmath35    for a neutral massless scalar field perturbation , the effective potentials were described in refs .",
    "@xcite , which vanish at the black hole and cosmological event horizons . however , for the charged scalar field perturbation , it is easy to see that at both the black hole and cosmological event horizons , the effective potentials are negative .",
    "it is believed that the effective potential @xmath34 describes the scattering of @xmath26 by the background curvature @xcite .",
    "usually , if the effective potential is negative in some region , growing perturbation , can appear in the spectrum , indicating an instability of the system under such perturbations .",
    "however , in ref .  @xcite it was argued that this is not always true .",
    "they found that some potentials with a negative gap still do not imply instability .",
    "the criterion to determine whether a system is stable or not against linear perturbation is whether the time - domain profile for the evolution of the perturbation is decaying or not , or , in more general terms , the potential has to permit the existence of bound states @xcite .",
    "thus , in order to study the stability of the rn - ds black hole against charged scalar perturbation , we have to examine the evolution of the perturbation . in calculating the wave equation to obtain the evolution of the perturbation , usually the quasinormal boundary conditions should be employed by defining the solution with the purely ingoing wave at the black hole event horizon and outgoing wave at the cosmological horizon .",
    "we do not have analytic solutions to the time - dependent wave equation with the effective potentials considered here .",
    "we thus discretize the wave equation ( [ radial eq ] ) . because of the appearance of the term @xmath36 , the procedure used in ref .",
    "@xcite is not convenient here .",
    "one simple efficient discretization , used for example in ref .",
    "@xcite , is to define @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 , and to write ( [ radial eq ] ) as @xmath40 with the initial gaussian distribution @xmath41 $ ] and @xmath42 , we can derive the evolution of @xmath43 by @xmath44 in the following , we choose the parameters @xmath45 and @xmath46 in the gaussian profile . since the von neumann stability conditions usually require that @xmath47 , we use @xmath48 here .",
    "we will discuss the behavior of the field @xmath49 in the following .",
    "it is necessary to point out that the time - domain profiles of perturbations include contributions from all modes .",
    "it was argued that this method is based on the scattering of the gaussian wave on the potential barrier and is independent of the boundary conditions at the black hole event and cosmological horizons @xcite .",
    "therefore it includes all possible instabilities due to different boundary conditions .    in order to extract dominant frequency from the time - domain profile of the perturbation , we will use the prony method .",
    "we can fit the profile data by superposition of damping exponents @xcite @xmath50 we consider a late time period , which starts at @xmath51 and ends at @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is an integer and @xmath54 . then eq .",
    "( [ time - domain ] ) is valid for each value from the profile data : @xmath55 the prony method allows us to find @xmath56 in terms of the known @xmath57 and , since @xmath58 is also known to calculate the quasinormal frequencies @xmath59 .",
    "first , we use the finite difference method proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite to reexamine the neutral massless scalar field perturbations in rn - ds spacetime , which was first reported in ref .",
    "@xcite and later confirmed in ref .",
    "@xcite . for @xmath60 modes ,",
    "we plot the potential in fig .",
    "[ neutral0 ] .",
    "we can see that for the @xmath0 mode there exists a negative potential well following a potential barrier near the cosmological event horizon .",
    "but for the @xmath1 mode the potential well does not exist . the time - domain evolution of the perturbation in fig .",
    "[ neutral1 ] shows that when @xmath0 , the field rapidly settles down to a constant value after some quasinormal oscillations .",
    "when @xmath1 , the perturbation field falls off exponentially after the quasinormal oscillations .",
    "these results show very good agreement with those observed in refs .",
    "@xcite , which gives us confidence in the numerical method we employed .",
    "the neutral massless scalar field perturbations do not grow in the time - domain profiles , although there is a negative potential well when @xmath0 .",
    "this shows that the rn - ds black hole is stable against the neutral massless scalar perturbation .",
    "but when the multipole index @xmath0 , the late time tail of the neutral scalar perturbation settles down to a constant value , instead of a decay , implying that the @xmath0 mode is prone to instability .",
    "it is of great interest to extend the study to the charged scalar field perturbation .",
    "one expects that with the new term in ( 9 ) , the potential will become more negative when the scalar field is charged . whether this can lead to a deeper potential well and destabilize the rn - ds black hole configuration is a question to be answered .",
    "we first concentrate on the perturbation with the angular index @xmath0 for the charged massless scalar field . in fig .",
    "[ charge-1 ] we exhibit the potential behavior with the increase of the charge of the massless scalar field .",
    "it is clear that with the increase of the charge of the scalar field , the potential has wider and deeper negative well and the potential barrier becomes smaller . for big enough charge @xmath28 ,",
    "i.e. @xmath61 , the potential barrier disappears and the potential falls continuously from a small negative value at the cosmological event horizon to a very negative constant at the black hole event horizon .",
    "our main concern are regions where the effective potentials contain negative values , since possible instabilities are usually indicated in such regions .",
    "the response of a stable rn - ds black holes to external charged scalar perturbation is determined by the late time evolution of the perturbation . in fig .",
    "[ charge-2 ] we show the time - domain profiles for the evolution of charged scalar perturbations .",
    "when the scalar field is charged , the late time tail of the perturbation will grow in the end . with the increase of the charge of the scalar field ,",
    "the growth will become stronger .",
    "this can be determined by the slopes of the late time tails .",
    "the growth of the charged scalar perturbation can be attributed to the negative potential well , which can trap and accumulate the perturbation and finally destabilize the background rn - ds black hole spacetime .",
    "but when the charge of the scalar field is large enough , its tail decays instead of growing in the end .",
    "this can be understood from the corresponding monotonic behavior in the potential , which can not hinder the perturbation from falling into the black hole .",
    "above , we focused on the massless charged scalar field .",
    "it is of interest to explore the influence of the scalar field mass on the stability of the black hole . for the massive charged scalar field",
    ", we observe the influence on the potential by different values of the mass of the scalar field in fig .",
    "[ mass-1 ] .",
    "the dashed lines are for the neutral massive scalar fields , while the solid lines are for the charged scalar fields with different masses .",
    "we see that , when the scalar fields become more massive , the potential wells become narrower and less negative . when the mass of the scalar field is large enough , the potential will have only a positive barrier between the black hole and cosmological event horizons .    the evolution of perturbations is shown in fig .  [ mass-2 ] .",
    "the dashed lines are for the neutral scalar field .",
    "we see that only for the massless scalar perturbation , which contains a constant tail , all massive perturbations exhibit a decay behavior at late time . when the mass of the scalar field is large enough , i.e. @xmath62",
    ", neutral scalar perturbations have a long - lived ringing at the late time .",
    "the solid lines are for the scalar fields with fixed charge @xmath63 but different masses . for the massless case",
    ", it exhibits a growing mode , but when the scalar field becomes massive , the perturbation decays .",
    "fitting the curves in fig .",
    "[ mass-2 ] with function @xmath64 at late time , we can get the decay rate of perturbations in table [ table-1 ] .",
    "it is shown that , for both the neutral and charged scalar field perturbations , the decay of tails first becomes quicker , and then slows down with the increase of the mass of the scalar field .",
    "the massive field exhibiting oscillations in the late time tail has higher energy , so that it decays slower .",
    "the influence of the scalar mass on the behavior of decay in the late time tail is consistent with that reported in the kerr - newman background @xcite .",
    "in summary we find that for the @xmath0 mode , when the scalar field is charged , the perturbation can grow .",
