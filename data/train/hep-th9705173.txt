    "much has been learned from string duality about superstring vacua with extended supersymmetry ( for reviews of various aspects , see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "for instance :    @xmath0 naively distinct moduli spaces are smoothly connected ( e.g. through conifold transitions in 4d n=2 type ii vacua @xcite )    @xmath0 dual descriptions allow one to compute nonperturbative effects in one picture by doing tree - level computations in a dual theory ( e.g. in heterotic / type ii duality in four dimensions with n=2 supersymmetry @xcite )    while we now have an excellent understanding of most phenomena which occur in string vacua with extended supersymmetry , our understanding of 4d n=1 vacua is much less complete .",
    "there are several motivations for studying such vacua :    @xmath0 less supersymmetry allows richer phenomena .",
    "for example , in n=1 theories the classical moduli space can be @xmath1 by quantum effects , i.e. supersymmetry can be dynamically broken .",
    "this is impossible in theories with extended supersymmetry .",
    "@xmath0 4d n=1 is the case which might be relevant to the real world .",
    "n=1 allows chiral gauge representations , while for extended supersymmetric theories one typically has only nonchiral representations . in addition , weak scale susy is one plausible explanation for the unnaturally large ratio of the weak scale to the planck scale , the so - called `` hierarchy problem . '' finally , the observed unification of the gauge couplings in minimal supersymmetric extensions of the standard model leads one to suspect that n=1 susy may be lurking around the corner at the weak scale .",
    "@xmath0 n=1 susy is much more `` generic '' than extended susy , just in terms of number of vacua .",
    "such vacua should be studied for this reason alone .",
    "there are several different ways to get 4d n=1 theories out of string theory and its parent theories , m - theory and f - theory .",
    "we describe a few methods of constructing n=1 theories below . for most of these lectures",
    ", our focus will be on the heterotic @xmath2 and @xmath3 strings .",
    "one can start with either @xmath4 or @xmath2 gauge group in ten dimensions .",
    "then the low energy effective theory is 10d n=1 super yang - mills , coupled to supergravity .",
    "if we look for solutions of this theory preserving one four - dimensional supersymmetry , we find @xcite :    @xmath0 the compactification space @xmath5 must be a manifold of @xmath6 holonomy , a calabi - yau manifold .",
    "the reduced holonomy implies that the first chern class @xmath7 vanishes .",
    "such manifolds are complex kahler manifolds and can be equipped with a ricci - flat metric for each choice of their complex structure and kahler class @xmath8 .",
    "the parameters involved in these choices yield scalar moduli in the 4d n=1 effective field theory .",
    "one obtains @xmath9 such moduli parametrizing the choice of complex structure , and @xmath10 giving the choice of kahler class @xmath8 .",
    "@xmath0 the gauge field strength @xmath11 must satsify the equations @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 label ( anti)holomorphic coordinates on the complex manifold @xmath5 and @xmath15 is the ricci - flat kahler metric on @xmath5 .",
    "these equations have a solution iff the gauge connection is a connection on a @xmath16 vector bundle @xmath17 @xcite . furthermore , there is an integrability condition for the solution of the kahler yang - mills equations @xmath18 also , the bianchi identity for the three - form field strength @xmath19 requires @xmath20 typically , the vector bundles @xmath21 come in multiparameter families parametrized by elements of @xmath22 .",
    "* examples *    there are relatively simple techniques for constructing many examples of calabi - yau threefolds ; for a deeper understanding , one should consult e.g. @xcite .",
    "the simplest examples involve constructing the calabi - yau as a hypersurface or a complete intersection of hypersurfaces in some @xmath23 .",
    "the projective space @xmath24 is simply a space defined by homogeneous complex coordinates @xmath25 subject to the relation @xmath26 for any nonzero complex @xmath27 , and with the origin removed . using the adjunction formula @xcite , it is easy to see that a hypersurface @xmath5 defined by an equation which is homogeneous of degree @xmath28 in the @xmath29 will have @xmath30 . to get a threefold in this way , one needs to work in @xmath31 , and one obtains the famous quintic in @xmath31 .",
    "similarly , any intersection of @xmath32 hypersurfaces , with defining polynomials whose degrees sum to @xmath28 , will define a calabi - yau @xmath33 fold in @xmath34 .    a simple generalization of the complex projective space @xmath34 is the weighted projective space @xmath35 defined by homogeneous coordinates @xmath25 subject to an identification @xmath36 for any nonzero complex @xmath27 ( and again with the origin removed ) .",
    "one calls a polynomial @xmath37 homogeneous of degree @xmath38 in this weighted projective space if @xmath39 it again follows from the adjunction formula that a complete intersection of @xmath32 hypersurfaces whose degrees add up to @xmath40 will define a calabi - yau @xmath33 fold in the @xmath41 .",
    "there are subtleties in certain cases , involving singularities of the ambient @xmath41 which might be inherited by the calabi - yau ; we will not discuss these issues here , and refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "we have not mentioned the construction of appropriate gauge bundles here .",
    "each calabi - yau comes equipped with its tangent bundle , which serves as a suitable choice .",
    "however , one should keep in mind that this choice , `` embedding the spin connection in the gauge group , '' gives only a very small class of vacua .",
    "more general choices will be briefly discussed below in  3.1 .",
    "there are two important points to emphasize about our whole discussion of heterotic vacua :    \\i ) the conditions we ve discussed above are sufficient to guarantee a solution to all orders in the string worldsheet sigma model coupling @xmath42 .",
    "nonperturbatively in @xmath42 we must also worry about so - called `` worldsheet instanton '' effects @xcite .",
    "in certain classes of examples , it is known that such effects do not spoil conformal invariance @xcite .",
    "\\ii ) the heterotic @xmath2 and type i theories both have 10d n=1 super - yang mills coupled to @xmath2 gauge fields as their low energy limits .",
    "they are in fact identical theories , equivalent under the strong / weak duality transformation @xcite @xmath43 where @xmath27 denotes the string couplings .",
    "in particular , this implies that after compactification on a calabi - yau threefold @xmath5 , @xmath44 here , @xmath45 is the size of some rational curve in @xmath5 .",
    "so heterotic worldsheet instanton effects map to type i spacetime instanton effects !",
    "one should think of the heterotic string as the dirichlet 1-brane of the type i theory , so in particular the 1 brane wrapping a holomorphic curve in a d5 brane is a `` spacetime '' instanton effect in the d5 brane worldvolume quantum field theory @xcite .",
    "one can get 4d n=1 theories from m - theory by compactifying on a 7-manifold of @xmath46 holonomy .",
    "examples of such theories have been studied @xcite but not much is known about their physics .",
    "one gets a 4d n=1 theory by compactifying f - theory @xcite on a calabi - yau fourfold .",
    "we have two comments to make about such theories :    \\i ) the type iia string has an interaction @xcite @xmath47 where b is the ns - ns 2-form and @xmath48 is a quartic polynomial in the curvature .",
    "so if one compactifies on a fourfold @xmath49 with @xmath50 then naively there is a vacuum destabilizing tadpole for the @xmath51 field .",
    "this lifts to a similar term in f - theory involving the 4-form gauge field which couples to the sl(2,z ) invariant three - brane .",
    "one can show that @xmath52 for @xmath49 a calabi - yau . in order to cancel the tadpole",
    ", one can include @xmath53 threebranes localized on @xmath49 but filling the transverse spacetime @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "is negative , there is no way to cancel the tadpole and preserve supersymmetry . ]",
    "\\ii ) it follows from the adiabatic argument and the duality between the heterotic string on @xmath55 and f - theory on elliptic @xmath56 surfaces that there are also dualities between 4d n=1 heterotic and f - theory compactifications .",
    "suppose @xmath49 is an elliptic fourfold with base @xmath51 , and @xmath51 is fibered over @xmath57 with @xmath58 fibers .",
    "then the adiabatic argument suggests that f - theory on @xmath49 is dual to the heterotic string on the elliptic calabi - yau threefold @xmath59 with base @xmath57 . the @xmath53 three - branes present in the f - theory compactification map , in the heterotic theory , to @xmath53 5-branes wrapped on the elliptic fiber of @xmath59 .",
    "for most of these lectures , our focus will be on understanding heterotic compactifications on calabi - yau threefolds .",
    "the first step is to obtain a proper understanding of the classical n=1 heterotic vacua .",
    "we discussed the classical geometry briefly in  2.1 , but in string theory the classical vacua are really worldsheet conformal field theories .",
    "these can predict interesting `` quantum geometrical '' phenomena when some length scales in the compactification geometry shrink to the string length .    the worldsheet data required to specify a `` realistic '' @xmath2 heterotic string vacuum of the form @xmath60 where @xmath61 is",
    "minkowski space and @xmath5 is some compact manifold is :    @xmath0 a free theory with left and right central charges @xmath62 for the @xmath61 cft .",
    "@xmath0 a @xmath63 left - moving cft composed of free fermions , representing the @xmath64 current algebra .",
    "@xmath0 a @xmath65 conformal theory representing the `` internal '' calabi - yau sigma model with ( 0,2 ) supersymmetry .",
    "the left moving fermions couple to an @xmath66 bundle @xmath17 .",
    "these are the basic structures we need . to see if the classical string theory differs in any interesting way from the classical geometry , we need a considerably more precise description of the calabi - yau piece of the conformal field theory .",
    "it is prohibitively difficult in most cases to directly construct the 2d quantum field theory as an exact conformal field theory .",
    "what one can do , following witten @xcite , is construct a ( 0,2 ) gauged linear sigma model that should be taken under rg flow to the desired ( 0,2 ) conformal field theory in the infrared .",
    "the parameters in this gauged linear sigma model then represent the spacetime moduli of the string theory .",
    "we will now try to construct a ( 0,2 ) supersymmetric qft that will flow , in some limit , to a sigma model describing strings propagating on a complete intersection calabi - yau in a weighted projective space .",
    "the relevant ( 0,2 ) superspace has supercharges @xmath67 and @xmath68 and susy multiplets : @xmath69 @xmath70 where @xmath71 are complex worldsheet coordinates and the @xmath72s are the fermionic superspace coordinates . in such a superspace , we consider a @xmath73 gauge theory the following field content .",
    "we take @xmath74 chiral multiplets @xmath75 with gauge charges @xmath76 and one additional chiral multiplet @xmath77 with charge @xmath78 .",
    "we also take @xmath28 fermi multiplets @xmath79 with charges @xmath80 and @xmath81 fermi multiplets @xmath82 with charges @xmath83 .",
    "we will see momentarily that there are constraints on the various charges , following from the conditions discussed in  2.1 .",
    "in addition to normal kinetic terms for all of the fields , we will include two special terms in the action :    \\1 ) a fayet - iliopoulos d - term for the u(1 ) gauge field @xmath84 where @xmath85 is an auxiliary field in the u(1 ) gauge multiplet and @xmath86 is the u(1 ) field strength .",
    "\\2 ) a ( 0,2 ) superpotential @xmath87 where u(1 ) gauge invariance dictates that @xmath88 should be a polynomial in the @xmath89s with charge @xmath90 and @xmath91 should have charge @xmath92 .    with this lagrangian , integrating out auxiliary fields leads to a potential energy @xmath93 @xmath94 the infrared behavior of the quantum field theory will be governed by the vacua of @xmath95 , at least for large @xmath96 when the excitations around the minima are very massive .",
    "there are two such regimes :    \\(i ) the calabi - yau phase    take @xmath97 .",
    "assume @xmath98 ; we will explain this momentarily",
    ". then the locus of @xmath99 is @xmath100 dividing @xmath101 by the @xmath73 symmetry leaves a copy of the @xmath102 dimensional weighted complex projective space with weights @xmath103 , and with kahler class ( or `` size '' ) @xmath104 .",
    "then @xmath105 defines a complete intersection calabi - yau manifold @xmath5 in this weighted projective space , as long as we require @xmath106 .",
    "further examination of the yukawa couplings of the worldsheet fermions , as in @xcite , reveals that the massless combinations of the right - movers @xmath107 transform as sections of @xmath108 , while the left - movers transform as sections of a holomorphic bundle @xmath109 , with holomorphic structure defined by the @xmath110 .",
    "more precisely , this bundle is defined as the kernel of an exact sequence @xmath111 we now recognize that @xmath112 is necessary simply for the geometry of @xmath17 to be smooth",
    ". are sufficiently generic , mild singularities of @xmath21 or rather drastic singularities of @xmath5 may be present without adversely affecting the perturbative string theory . ] requiring that @xmath21 satisfy the constraints of  2.1  then constrains the @xmath73 gauge charges of various worldsheet multiplets : @xmath113 @xmath114 @xmath115 in fact , both conditions are simply anomaly cancellation conditions on the worldsheet @xcite .",
    "the first requires that there be a non - anomalous u(1 ) global symmetry acting on the left movers , while the second is simply the condition that the worldsheet u(1 ) gauge anomaly should vanish !    in this framework , the spacetime moduli fields appear as follows :    @xmath0 changes of @xmath116 correspond to varying the ( complexified ) kahler moduli    @xmath0 polynomial deformations of @xmath117 correspond to moduli of the complex structure of @xmath5    @xmath0 polynomial deformations of @xmath110 correspond to moduli of the holomorphic bundle @xmath21    so for @xmath97 we recovered the calabi - yau nonlinear sigma model , with the parameters ( moduli ) we expect of the ( 0,2 ) cft .",
    "this limit reproduces what we expect from classical geometry .",
    "what about the other phase , with @xmath118 but @xmath119 , which can also be studied semiclassically ?",
    "\\(ii ) the landau - ginzburg phase    for @xmath120 , the minimum of @xmath95 occurs when @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "the u(1 ) gauge symmetry is broken to a @xmath123 by @xmath124 , which carries nonzero u(1 ) charge .",
    "the massless degrees of freedom are the @xmath125s , @xmath126s , and @xmath127s , governed by a superpotential @xmath128 the unbroken @xmath123 discrete gauge symmetry instructs us to take a @xmath123 orbifold of the naive landau - ginzburg theory , to obtain a so - called `` landau - ginzburg orbifold . ''",
    "@xmath129 .5 cm    so the global picture of the kahler moduli space , controlled by @xmath116 , is roughly as follows .",
    "as @xmath104 decreases from @xmath130 to @xmath131 , the calabi - yau sigma model coupling gets stronger and stronger until finally the perturbation series for various correlators diverges .",
    "going `` past '' this point , to negative @xmath104 , one finds that there is a @xmath132 convergent perturbation expansion , this time in twist fields about the landau - ginzburg orbifold , which becomes more and more weakly coupled as @xmath133 .",
    "this is summarized in figure 1 above .",
    "the landau - ginzburg phases are as `` far away '' from the @xmath134 classical geometry limit as we can get in the calabi - yau moduli space .",
    "one might therefore expect that examples of `` stringy '' quantum geometrical effects might be particularly manifest there .",
    "one such phenomenon , which occurs in string theory but not classical geometry and is mediated through the landau - ginzburg phase , is a certain kind of smooth topology change @xcite .",
    "notice at the landau - ginzburg point , there is no invariant distinction between the @xmath82s and the @xmath135s ( or the @xmath136s and the @xmath137s ) .",
    "this is in marked distinction to the distinguished roles these fields play at large radius , where the @xmath136s determine @xmath5 and the @xmath137s determine the holomorphic structure of @xmath21 .",
    "this makes it possible for us to imagine an automorphism which exchanges certain @xmath126s and @xmath127s , while at the same time exchanging certain @xmath138s and @xmath11s , at the landau - ginzburg point . since the spectrum of chiral fields remains invariant under such a re - labeling , any models related by such a symmetry must ( at large radius ) be calabi - yau complete intersections in the @xmath139 weighted projective space . examples of such automorphisms yield pairs of topologically distinct calabi - yau manifolds @xmath140 ( which can even have different euler characters @xmath141 ) and vector bundles @xmath17 and @xmath142 which are smoothly connected through their ( shared ) landau - ginzburg phase . ; the net spacetime chirality does not change . ]",
    "the landau - ginzburg phase then plays the role of a multi - critical point in the cft moduli space .",
    "one can turn on distinct moduli , which are not mutually integrable , to go to large - radius in either of the two distinct calabi - yau phases .",
    "simple concrete examples of this phenomenon are discussed in @xcite and we will give no further details here .",
    "@xmath143 .5 cm",
    "as discussed by many other lecturers , susy field theories and string theories typically have moduli spaces @xmath144 of physically inequivalent vacua parametrized by scalar vevs @xmath145 .",
    "these moduli spaces @xmath144 typically have special points @xmath146 where the physics is @xmath147 .",
    "interesting dynamics occurs there .",
    "a lesson of the recent advances is that understanding what happens at singular points in the passage from the classical to the quantum theory is the crucial step in `` solving '' the quantum theory .",
    "@xmath148 .5 cm      let us begin by reviewing some prototypical examples .",
    "at least four sorts of phenomena have been observed in 4d gauge theory and string theory :    \\1 ) a classical singularity is @xmath149 in the quantum theory .",
    "example : consider the @xmath150 gauge theory with @xmath151 flavours of quarks , i.e. four doublets @xmath152 , @xmath153 . the coordinates on the classical moduli space @xmath154 are @xmath155 .",
    "the equation defining @xmath154 is @xmath156 in the quantum theory , this is deformed to @xmath157 where @xmath127 is the scale of the gauge theory .",
    "the singular point @xmath158 on the classical moduli space , where the @xmath150 gauge symmetry is restored , is @xmath149 in the quantum theory @xcite .",
    "\\2 ) the mathematical structure of @xmath154 and @xmath159 agrees , but the physical interpretation of the singular points changes .",
    "example : consider @xmath160 gauge theory with @xmath161 flavours of quarks .",
    "then the classical singular points are due to the appearance of massless gluons ( `` unhiggsing '' ) , while the quantum singularities are due to the appearance of additional massless composite `` baryons '' and `` mesons '' @xcite .",
    "\\3 ) there are still singularities on @xmath159 , but the mathematical structure ( and hence also the physical interpretation ) is modified .",
    "example : take the famous case of n=2 supersymmetric pure @xmath150 gauge theory .",
    "the n=2 gauge multiplet contains a complex scalar @xmath125 in the adjoint of @xmath150 .",
    "there is a one complex dimensional moduli space of vacua , parametrized by the gauge invariant coordinate @xmath162 . in the classical moduli space , there is a singular point at @xmath163 where the @xmath150 gauge symmetry is restored . in the quantum theory ,",
    "this splits into two singular points at @xmath164 ( where @xmath127 is the scale of the theory ) , where a monopole and a dyon become massless .",
    "this is the crucial insight needed to solve the theory @xcite .",
    "@xmath165 .5 cm    there is a @xmath166 possibility which seems to occur in string theory .",
    "namely :    \\4 ) the singularity is ` inexplicable ' classically . in the quantum theory",
    ", it arises due to quantum loops or nonperturbative dynamics of solitons .",
    "these ( quantum ) effects are independent of @xmath167 because of the unusual couplings of these solitons .",
    "example : a famous example is provided by strominger s resolution of conifold singularities in iib compactifications on calabi - yau threefolds @xcite .",
    "there , @xmath5 is a calabi - yau and @xmath168 a three - cycle .",
    "there is a scalar component @xmath169 in a ramond - ramond @xmath73 vector multiplet given by @xmath170 one can wrap a dirichlet three - brane on @xmath49 to obtain a bps state whose mass is bounded by @xmath171 , which is just the size of the 3-cycle @xmath49 .",
    "in particular , as @xmath172 one obtains a new massless charged particle , arising from the wrapped 3-brane ! this explains a log singularity in the @xmath173 iib prepotential .",
    "we will find even more dramatic examples of such phenomena in n=1 compactifications , where @xmath174 dynamics of solitons will explain singularities of classical string theory .",
    "we should note that a physical interpretation of the singular points is necessary for consistency of the theory .",
    "but more importantly , it allows one to gain control over novel physical effects .",
    "for instance :    @xmath0 in 4d n=2 models , the quantum understanding of conifold points gives a physical realization to the idea of `` conifold transitions . ''",
    "these allow one to connect up the moduli spaces of all calabi - yau compactifications of type ii strings @xcite !",
    "@xmath0 in the 4d n=1 case , we will see later on that singular points allow one to connect up models with different net numbers of chiral generations @xcite !",
    "there is yet another motivation for studying singularities , which is generic to n=1 supergravity models with superpotentials .",
    "it turns out that in 4d n=1 models , singular points are @xmath175 in order to have a non - vanishing superpotential @xcite .",
    "recall that n=1 supergravity theories are specified by a kahler potential @xmath176 as well as a holomorphic superpotential @xmath177 and gauge coupling function @xmath178 .",
    "@xmath0 the lagrangian @xmath179 has a kahler invariance under which @xmath180 this kahler transformation must be accompanied by a chiral transformation on the fermion fields in @xmath89 and the gravitino .",
    "@xmath0 in the presence of a superpotential @xmath138 , the kahler invariance still holds if in addition to the shift of @xmath181 , one has @xmath182 this means that w is actually a section of a line bundle over the moduli space @xmath144 parametrized by the @xmath89s .",
    "@xmath0 the @xmath183 on this bundle has covariant derivatives",
    "@xmath184 @xmath185 from which it follows that its @xmath186 is @xmath187 .",
    "since to get the right sign of the kinetic energy we want the metric on @xmath144 to be positive definite , this means that the superpotential is a section of a line bundle of @xmath188 curvature over @xmath144 .",
    "but now a standard theorem of complex geometry tells us that if @xmath144 is compact , or can be suitably compactified , then as a section of a line bundle of negative curvature @xmath138 @xmath189 poles if it does not identically vanish @xcite .",
    "this means that    \\a ) the known tree level superpotentials in string theory must have poles at codimension one .",
    "we must explain these poles physically .",
    "\\b ) if we want to find `` non - perturbative '' superpotentials which e.g. dynamically break supersymmetry or destabilize would - be supersymmetric ground states , they too must have poles .",
    "so it is sometimes easiest to see if such a superpotential is generated by going to the potential singular points in moduli space ( which are often clearly identifiable in a given model ) and checking there .",
    "our eventual goal is to study singularities of 4d n=1 compactifications of the heterotic string .",
    "however , our strategy will be to use knowledge of singular behavior in @xmath190 dimensions , fibered over an additional sphere , to determine the four - dimensional physics .",
    "so we first need to review the phenomena which accompany singularities in 6d ( 0,1 ) supersymmetric heterotic string compactifications .",
    "we will study the simplest cases here ; more complicated singularities in ( 0,1 ) vacua have recently been discussed in e.g. @xcite .",
    "when we compactify the @xmath2 heterotic string on a k3 to obtain a 6d @xmath191 theory , the bianchi identity @xmath192 together with the fact that @xmath193 tells us that we must put 24 yang - mills instantons in the @xmath2 . the natural place to look for singularities is then when one of the instanton scale sizes shrinks to zero .",
    "the novel physics of such points was explained by witten @xcite .",
    "what can @xmath194 happen at such a point ?",
    "singular points in the moduli space are most simply explained as points where new particles are becoming light . in 6d theories with ( 0,1 ) supersymmetry , the only massive supermultiplet with spins @xmath195 is the massive vector multiplet .",
    "as its mass goes to zero , it becomes a massless vector + hypermultiplet .",
    "so the only relevant @xmath196 low energy dynamics is that the higgs mechanism might be turned on or off .",
    "consider a shrinking instanton in @xmath197 then . since it is small the details of the @xmath56 are irrelevant , so we might as well pretend it is on @xmath198 .",
    "then @xmath199 @xmath200 @xmath201 where the @xmath198 factor is just the instanton center of mass .",
    "now if one proposes to get @xmath202 by higgsing a gauge group @xmath203 with @xmath32 hypermultiplets , then @xmath204 so one needs @xmath205 .",
    "hence , it is natural to conjecture that @xmath206 and the matter is n half - hypermultiplets in the @xmath207 of @xmath150 .",
    "at least two strong pieces of evidence favor the conjecture that a nonperturbative @xmath150 together with an @xmath208 of @xmath209 half - hypermultiplets appear when an @xmath197 instanton shrinks to zero size .",
    "\\1 ) there is a well known adhm construction of instanton moduli space @xcite .",
    "the moduli space of the proposed nonperturbative gauge theory precisely reproduces this construction .",
    "\\2 ) there is a description of instantons at scale sizes @xmath210 on @xmath56 as the ( 0,4 ) superconformal field theory of `` solitonic fivebranes '' of thickness @xmath211 .",
    "as @xmath212 , the fivebrane goes to zero thickness . since this whole process is independent of @xmath167 , we can take @xmath213 .",
    "then by heterotic/ type i duality one obtains a weakly coupled type i string .",
    "it is natural to think that the zero thickness object you have sitting at a point on @xmath56 is now nothing but a type i dirichlet 5-brane !",
    "the properties of the d5 brane are in complete agreement with the previous conjecture .",
    "one can similarly see , as is clear from 2 ) above , that shrinking @xmath32 instantons at the same ( smooth ) point yields an @xmath214 gauge theory .",
    "the @xmath3 heterotic string on @xmath56 can be thought of as m theory on @xmath215 @xcite .",
    "naively , the bianchi identity for the @xmath19 field tells one that one must place @xmath216 instantons in the two @xmath217s at the ends of the world , where @xmath218 if for simplicity we put the @xmath216 instantons in an @xmath150 subgroup of each @xmath217 , then the unbroken gauge symmetry on each end of the world is @xmath219 , and the charged matter consists of @xmath220 @xmath221s .",
    "one can now ask , what happens as one of these @xmath217 instantons shrinks to zero size ?    in  5.1 , we saw that the only possible @xmath196 ir dynamics consistent with ( 0,1 ) supersymmetry is that the higgs mechanism can be turned on or off .",
    "this insight sufficed in determining the behavior of the @xmath2 small instanton .",
    "however , it is easy to convince oneself that the singularity in the @xmath217 case must involve more subtle behavior than this ( a quick glance at the dimensions of @xmath217 representations makes this clear ) .",
    "in fact , as explained in @xcite , the six - dimensional theory at the end of the world is governed by a nontrivial fixed point as an instanton shrinks to zero size .",
    "this is a multicritical point .",
    "the zero - size instanton constitutes a fivebrane at the end of the world .",
    "there are two phases connected by the fixed point theory : the higgs phase is obtained by enlarging the small instanton , while a distinct coulomb - like phase is obtained by moving the fivebrane off into the eleven - dimensional bulk .",
    "the bianchi identity is generalized to @xcite @xmath222 where @xmath223 is the number of fivebranes .",
    "it follows from the previous discussion that the number of 1/2 @xmath224s at the end of the world the fivebrane leaves decreases by one .",
    "the fivebrane worldvolume theory contains a tensor multiplet consisting of a real scalar , an antisymmetric tensor with selfdual field strength , and fermions .",
    "the real scalar s vev gives the distance of the fivebrane from the end of the world .",
    "the perturbative heterotic theory has one tensor multiplet , whose two - form potential combines with that in the 6d gravity multiplet ( which has anti self - dual field strength ) to form an unconstrained antisymmetric tensor field .",
    "the transition back to the perturbative heterotic theory from the phase with extra tensor multiplets can not be described in conventional lagrangian field theory , since the extra tensors can not pick up masses without having any anti self - dual partners to couple to .",
    "@xmath225 .5 cm    if we consider a single fivebrane and call the real scalar in the tensor multiplet @xmath125 , then there are noncritical strings of tension @xmath125 and @xmath226 arising from membranes stretched between the fivebrane and the two ends of the world . as the fivebrane approaches an end of the world , the tension of the associated noncritical string goes to zero . for this reason ,",
    "the nontrivial fixed points which occur when an @xmath217 instanton shrinks to zero size are sometimes called `` tensionless string theories . '' these fixed points ( and their close relatives , obtained by compactifying on circles or tori ) have been extensively investigated , in e.g. @xcite .",
    "so far , we have studied the simplest singularities of the heterotic theories compactified on k3 to six dimensions .",
    "our real interest is to use this knowledge to understand singularities in the 4d n=1 theories coming from compactifications on calabi - yau threefolds which are k3 fibrations .",
    "if we study singularities which occur at a point in the generic k3 fiber , then we should be able to use our knowledge of the six - dimensional physics to learn about the four - dimensional physics .",
    "we proceed to do this for the @xmath2 string in this section , and discuss the @xmath3 string in  7 .",
    "@xmath227 .5 cm    the simplest situation which we are equipped to study is the case that the k3 fibration @xmath5 has a single small instanton in the generic fiber .",
    "then the generic fiber theory has an enhanced nonperturbative @xmath150 symmetry as described in  5.1 .",
    "we will now see how this `` fibers '' to yield the four - dimensional story .",
    "the question we need to answer is : what of the @xmath150 gauge theory with 32 1/2 @xmath207s of hypermultiplets survives in the 4d n=1 theory ?",
    "the method we will use is to analyze adiabatically by making the @xmath58 base @xmath228 large and compactifying the 6d theory on @xmath228 with a twist , to preserve precisely 4d n=1 supersymmetry @xcite .",
    "the lorentz group in the `` k3 part '' of the theory decomposes as @xmath229 , where @xmath230 is the holonomy group of k3 .",
    "the six dimensional supercharges are in a doublet of @xmath231 , with @xmath232 .",
    "the lorentz group of @xmath228 is a @xmath73 , and each 6d supercharge decomposes into pieces with @xmath233 under this @xmath73 .",
    "so if we twist and call the lorentz @xmath73 @xmath234 , we will end up keeping precisely half of the six dimensional supersymmetry .",
    "the four - dimensional @xmath150 gauge bosons also survive the reduction as constants on @xmath228 .",
    "so we will still get a nonperturbative @xmath150 gauge theory .",
    "the real question is , how many doublets survive ?    for the gauge bundle @xmath17 an @xmath66 bundle , the @xmath235 splits into 2n fields which couple to @xmath21 or @xmath236 and 32 - 2n which couple to the trivial bundle . to count how many @xmath237 survive ( the bosonic spectrum follows by susy )",
    ", we just need to count the number of zero modes of the dirac operator on @xmath228 .",
    "this counting is possible using several simple observations :    @xmath0 zero modes of @xmath238 on @xmath228 , where @xmath239 is the covariant dirac operator and @xmath240 is the gauge connection on @xmath21 , are in one to one correspondence with elements of @xmath241 .",
    "here @xmath242 simply denotes the line bundle on @xmath228 with first chern class @xmath243 , and @xmath244 is the spin bundle .",
    "@xmath0 it is also true that @xmath245 holomorphic bundle @xmath21 splits as a direct sum of line bundles when it is restricted to @xmath228 @xmath246    @xmath0 finally , to count the surviving fermions one needs to know that @xmath247 for @xmath248 and vanishes for @xmath249 .",
    "putting these facts together , we find that the 32 - 2n @xmath207s which couple to the trivial bundle do @xmath250 survive , since @xmath251 is trivial . on the other hand ,",
    "the 2n doublets which couple to @xmath21 and @xmath236 contribute @xmath252 @xmath253 so on @xmath254 of singularities of the sort i have been describing , there is a nonperturbative enhancement of the spectrum consisting of @xmath150 gauge fields with a calculable number of doublets .",
    "the dynamics in this extra sector should allow us to explain various singularities of @xmath2 string compactifications .",
    "note that the coupling of the @xmath150 is not the normal string coupling of the heterotic string .",
    "instead , it is @xmath255 @xmath256 where @xmath257 is the radius of the base curve @xmath228 . on the other hand , in the type i theory these gauge fields",
    "are governed by the string coupling too .",
    "there are two phenomena which occur in heterotic ( 0,2 ) models which can be explained by these nonperturbative @xmath150 gauge theories .",
    "\\1 ) worldsheet instanton destabilization    there can exist curves @xmath228 with worldsheet instantons ( nontrivial maps of euclidean string worldsheets which wrap @xmath228 ) contributing @xmath258 to the @xmath259 superpotential @xcite .",
    "it is of interest to know for which models such a superpotential appears , and to give an `` explanation '' of the superpotential in terms of conventional low - energy physics .",
    "\\2 ) poles in yukawa couplings    if we compactify the @xmath2 heterotic string on a k3 fibration @xmath5 and take @xmath17 to be a holomorphic deformation of @xmath108 , then the low energy effective theory has @xmath260 gauge group .",
    "the charged matter content consists of @xmath261 @xmath262 quantities of interest in @xmath263 include the yukawa couplings @xmath264 where @xmath265 is a function of the moduli .",
    "it has been observed that in many models @xcite  the following occurs : if @xmath169 is a modulus of the theory such that at @xmath266 @xmath17 becomes singular , then @xmath265 behaves like @xmath267 as @xmath266 , where @xmath268 is finite in the limit .",
    "it is necessary for consistency of the theory to find a dynamical explanation for such poles .",
    "we will try to explain phenomena 1 ) and 2 ) in turn , for this class of singularities .",
    "* application i : vacuum cleaning *    suppose that at codimension one in the moduli space of vacua , one finds a singularity of the sort we ve been discussing with @xmath269 where @xmath270 denotes further trivial factors .",
    "then one gets a nonperturbative enhancement of the spectrum consisting of @xmath150 gauge theory with 2 massless doublets @xmath271 .",
    "@xmath0 classically , this theory has a 1 complex dimensional moduli space of vacua with @xmath272 being the ( gauge invariant ) coordinate .",
    "@xmath0 quantum mechanically , affleck , dine and seiberg showed some years ago @xcite that a one instanton effect in this theory dynamically generates a superpotential @xmath273 where for us @xmath274 .",
    "that is exactly the sort of superpotential we expect worldsheet instantons to generate in heterotic string theory !",
    "there are several checks :    \\i ) the pole at @xmath275 can play the role of the pole required ( as reviewed in  4.2 ) for a nonzero superpotential in supergravity .",
    "\\ii ) the fact that @xmath228 is a curve of @xmath276 agrees perfectly with independent analysis of when a worldsheet instanton superpotential can be generated @xcite .",
    "\\iii ) by zero - mode counting arguments in an explicit worldsheet instanton computation , one can show @xcite  that this splitting type is one of only @xmath277 cases where a worldsheet instanton superpotential is possible .",
    "this involves a counting of heterotic string worldsheet fermion zero modes instead of nonperturbative @xmath150 doublets !",
    "the other splitting type consistent with a worldsheet instanton generated superpotential is trivial splitting . from our analysis",
    ", this case corresponds to a pure @xmath150 gauge theory , and gaugino condensation occurs , which again would generate a potential @xmath278 in the gauge theory analysis . in this case , since there are no moduli which remove the @xmath150 , the compactification would be generically singular , however .",
    "so , we have found that there is a complete agreement between situations where the nonperturbative @xmath150 gauge theory can lead to vacuum destabilization and situations where worldsheet instanton considerations allow a superpotential to be generated @xcite .",
    "three comments are in order :    \\1 ) duality maps these worldsheet instanton effects in the heterotic string to both spacetime instantons of the type i theory ( in the worldvolume gauge theory on a 5-brane ) , and euclidean 5-branes wrapping divisors of arithmetic genus 1 in f - theory on a dual calabi - yau fourfold @xcite .",
    "\\2 ) the physical upshot is that many heterotic or type i vacua with no nontrivial dynamics in the obvious ( perturbative ) gauge groups can still be destabilized by dynamics in less obvious nonperturbative gauge groups .",
    "\\3 ) the techniques of @xcite  have been used to study considerably more elaborate examples of nonperturbative superpotentials , which exhibit modular behavior @xcite .",
    "* application ii : poles in yukawa couplings *    analyzing the situations where the generic @xmath56 fiber is singular and there is a pole in a yukawa coupling , we find that @xmath279 this implies by our previous analysis that at the singular point in moduli space one finds an @xmath150 gauge theory with @xmath151 , i.e. 4 doublets .",
    "so how does this explain the pole in the yukawa couplings of @xmath260 charged matter @xcite ?",
    "denote the doublets @xmath280 . as we reviewed in  4.1 , susy qcd with @xmath281",
    "has a smooth quantum moduli space @xmath159 which is a deformation of the classical one : @xmath282 where @xmath127 is the dynamical scale of the gauge theory .",
    "the constraint restricting the fields to lie on @xmath159 can be imposed with a lagrange multiplier in the superpotential @xmath283    in the gauge theory , the higgs branch has 5 complex dimensions . in our problem , there is only @xmath284 relevant dimension in the moduli space , parametrized by @xmath169 .",
    "this implies the existence of a tree - level superpotential @xmath285 integrating out the @xmath21s appearing in @xmath286 , we find that they vanish",
    ". then the pfaffian constraint obtained by integrating out @xmath27 reveals @xmath287 this yields the required complex 1-dimensional moduli space .    what about the pole ?",
    "consider adding a term @xmath288 to the superpotential .",
    "then altogether we have @xmath289 now integrating out @xmath290 and @xmath27 , we find @xmath291 this is the desired pole , with @xmath292 !    note that nonperturbative @xmath293 phenomena in the @xmath150 gauge theory can explain @xmath173 heterotic string singularities because @xmath294 is playing the role of @xmath295 .",
    "this is the analogue of the special properties of rr fields used by strominger in explaining classical singularities of n=2 string vacua with quantum loops of light solitons @xcite .",
    "we will now briefly discuss a similar analysis of singular @xmath296 string compactifications on @xmath56 fibrations .",
    "this will reveal a novel phenomenon which we did not encounter in the @xmath2 case .",
    "we will basically motivate and summarize the results of @xcite , where all of the details can be found .",
    "one of the longest standing mysteries of string theory has been the vacuum degeneracy problem .",
    "it is hard to see how a dynamical selection principle could choose between @xmath297 components of the space of vacua . for the case of compactifications with n=2 supersymmetry ,",
    "the situation improved considerably with the work of @xcite .",
    "the case of n=1 vacua is qualitatively different from the n=2 case .",
    "n=1 is the first case where chiral gauge representations occur .",
    "no transition which occurs in weakly coupled lagrangian field theory can change the net number of chiral generations .",
    "nonetheless , we will find in this section that in fact some vacua of the @xmath296 string with different generation numbers can be connected by phase transitions @xcite .",
    "these transitions involve going through a point in moduli space where there is no @xmath196 long distance description of the physics .      as in  6 , we consider compactification on a k3 fibration @xmath5 with base sphere @xmath228 .",
    "call the radius of @xmath228 @xmath257 . above the scale @xmath298",
    ", the physics can be analyzed in terms of an effective six - dimensional compactification on @xmath56 .",
    "suppose an @xmath217 small instanton develops in the generic fiber . for simplicity ,",
    "suppose it develops in an @xmath217 factor which is on a locus with unbroken @xmath219 .",
    "then as we discussed in  5.2 , moving the small instanton fivebrane off into the bulk ( i.e. , turning on the scalar in its tensor multiplet ) yields a vacuum with one less 1/2 @xmath299 localized on the wall it left . at the intersection of the two branches , the physics is governed by a nontrivial rg fixed point .",
    "let us now consider the theory below the scale @xmath298 , i.e. in four dimensions .",
    "for definiteness let us consider an @xmath6 bundle @xmath21 embedded in one @xmath217 on the calabi - yau threefold @xmath5 .",
    "this leads to an @xmath300 gauge symmetry in spacetime . in a class of examples ,",
    "an analysis of the 4d spectrum reveals the following @xcite : each 6d 1/2 @xmath301 hypermultiplet descends to a set of @xmath302s @xmath303 to a @xmath304 in the 4d theory .",
    "there is also some matter which does not descend from matter in the 6d theory , i.e. which is not associated with the generic fiber .",
    "this matter is therefore associated with singular fibers .    in the 4d theory",
    ", a zero - size instanton in the generic fiber corresponds to a fivebrane wrapped around the base @xmath58 .",
    "as shown in @xcite it remains consistent with supersymmetry for the fivebrane to move away from the end of the world , as long as it is wrapped on a holomorphic curve .",
    "in this phase , since of the the 1/2 @xmath299s has been removed in six dimensions , the corresponding @xmath305s or @xmath306 have been removed in the four - dimensional theory .",
    "one can argue that no additional states from singular fibers are produced in the transition .",
    "so we find that the net generation number has shifted .",
    "this is possible because at the point of transition , there is no weakly coupled description of the infrared physics : the theory is governed by a nontrivial rg fixed point obtained by `` fibering '' the 6d fixed point over a sphere .",
    "it would be very interesting to obtain a better understanding of such exotic 4d n=1 fixed points ; examples have been constructed on brane probes in @xcite .",
    "so far , we have discussed the 4d theory below the scale @xmath298 set by the kaluza - klein modes on the sphere .",
    "there are also lower dynamical scales in the problem , set by the strength of worldsheet instanton effects . as we mentioned in  5.2 , in addition to the fundamental string",
    "there are two noncritical strings of interest when the fivebrane moves off into the interval .",
    "if @xmath125 parametrizes its position on @xmath307 , then the tension of these noncritical strings goes like @xmath125 and @xmath226 .",
    "so euclidean worldsheets of these strings wrapping @xmath228 will generate effects that go like @xmath308 and @xmath309 .",
    "the physics of these instanton effects can be classified according to the splitting type of @xmath21 over @xmath228 at the small instanton singularity , as in  6 .",
    "actually , in general there is another vector bundle @xmath310 embedded in the second @xmath217 . at the point where the fivebrane is `` absorbed '' into the second @xmath217 , @xmath310 is also singular over @xmath228 and its splitting type is of interest .",
    "there are a few different cases one can consider , and we mention two of the simplest below . note that t - duality relates this theory , compactified on an additional circle , to the @xmath2 theories we discussed in the previous section .",
    "so in many cases , results about three - dimensional @xmath150 gauge dynamics are ( indirectly ) related to the phenomena under study here .",
    "case i : if @xmath311 and @xmath312 are both greater than two , then there is no worldsheet instanton generated superpotential on the @xmath125 branch .",
    "this follows from a standard counting of worldsheet instanton zero modes @xcite , which are associated to these two cohomology groups for the two kinds of noncritical strings . for these splitting types ,",
    "there are too many zero modes for a potential to be generated .",
    "furthermore , in these cases @xmath313 string worldsheet instanton effects also can not remove the `` small instanton '' point in the classical moduli space , where the nontrivial fixed point theory occurs .",
    "the physics as analyzed at the scale @xmath298 persists in the full quantum theory .",
    "such vacua provide examples where the chirality change can occur while remaining in the moduli space of vacua , i.e. at zero cost in energy .    case ii : if @xmath314 or @xmath315 is @xmath316 , a nonperturbative worldsheet instanton superpotential destabilizes the @xmath125 branch where the fivebrane is on the interval .",
    "one can see this in the @xmath217 theory by considering tensionful string worldsheet instantons of the first or second @xmath217 . the number of zero modes on the worldsheet of such a string , for these splitting types , will be small enough for a nontrivial instanton - generated superpotential .",
    "this is consistent with known results about @xmath150 gauge theories in three dimensions @xcite . in this case , the chirality change which seems possible between the scale @xmath317 generated by the instanton superpotential and @xmath298 is obstructed by quantum effects below @xmath317 .",
    "however , the potential barrier which prevents chirality change in such cases can be hierarchically smaller than the string scale .",
    "this indicates that in these cases chirality change can `` almost '' occur , i.e. it is possible at a small cost in energy .    in closing : the insights from string duality have already been used to great effect in `` solving '' vacua with extended supersymmetry . in 4d n=1 compactifications ,",
    "there has been progress in understanding methods of supersymmetry breaking and in removing an obstruction to unifying vacua .",
    "new techniques ( particularly from f - theory / heterotic duality ) are being developed @xcite , and one should expect further progress in the near future .",
