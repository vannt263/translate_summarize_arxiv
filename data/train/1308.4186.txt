    "an _ open chain _ is a linkage of rigid bars ( links , line segments , edges ) connected at their joints ( vertices , endpoints ) , which forms a simple , unclosed path .",
    "a _ folding _ of a linkage is any reconfiguration of the linkage obtained by moving the joints such that : ( 1 ) the edges remain straight ; ( 2 ) the number and length of edges are preserved ; ( 3 ) the edges do not intersect or pass through one another .",
    "when the joints of an open chain act as universal joints , it is called a _",
    "flexible open chain_. often we drop the prefixes  flexible \" and  open \" when understood from the context .",
    "a chain with @xmath0 edges is called a _",
    "@xmath0-chain_. when emphasizing the edges in a chain , a @xmath0-chain is often referred as a @xmath0-link chain .",
    "a collection of chains are _ interlocked _ if foldings can not separate them .",
    "interlocking of open chains was studied in  @xcite , establishing a number of results regarding which collections of chains can and can not interlock . an open problem posed in  @xcite is : what is the minimal number @xmath0 such that an open , flexible @xmath0-chain can interlock with a flexible @xmath1-chain ?",
    "it was first established in  @xcite that there is an open @xmath2-chain in a trapezoid frame that achieves interlocking .",
    "this was subsequently improved in  @xcite to establish interlocking between a 2-chain and an open 11-chain . here",
    "we improve that result once more , establishing interlocking between a 2-chain and a 10-chain .",
    "we present arguments that indicate that 10 is likely the minimum .    here",
    "we summarize results from  @xcite that we use in the sequel :    1 .",

    "a construction of a 3-chain interlocking a 4-chain , which we call a _",
    "3/4-tangle _ , is repeated below in figure 1 .",
    "some facts about the 3/4-tangle :    1 .",
    "theorem  11 of @xcite : the convex hull @xmath3 of the flexible joints @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 does not change combinatorially as the chains are reconfigured .",
    "corollary 1 of @xcite : let @xmath9 and @xmath10 be the midpoint of @xmath11 , if @xmath12 , and end links @xmath13 , then all joints @xmath14 and endpoints @xmath15 stay inside the @xmath16-ball centered at @xmath10 .",
    "this 3/4-tangle is crucial to the construction of the @xmath17-chain in @xcite and the construction of the @xmath18-chain here . in both constructions , the 11-chain and 10-chain",
    "are positioned to form a nearly rigid triangular frame which interlock the 2-chain .",
    "note that there are other interlockings of a 3-chain with a 4-chain which could work , but we follow @xcite in using the 3/4-tangle in figure 1 to construct the 10-chain .    to make the 3/4 tangle part of a single open chain , there are four ways to connect the 3-chain with the 4-chain by adding additional link(s ) . in the discussion in  @xcite on ways to possibly further reduce the number of links in the 11-chain",
    ", two possibilities of allowing maximal sharing of the 3/4-tangle s 7 links were ruled out . in this paper , we find that one of the two remaining possibilities can allow maximal sharing of two of the 3/4-tangle s 7 links in the triangle frame .",
    "this allows us to prove it indeed provides an open 10-chain interlocking with an open 2-chain .",
    "the idea of proof and proof techniques are very similar to that in @xcite , and so we follow a similar proof structure .",
    "the main difference in proof idea is that the triangle frame shares two of the 7 links of the 3/4-tangle . therefore the triangle frame employs a total of @xmath19 links .",
    "we found it unnecessary to assume that the triangle frame is an isosceles triangle , and so we alter lemma 2 in @xcite accordingly .",
    "the main idea of the proof , as in @xcite , is to build a  rigid \" triangular frame with small rings at its vertices @xmath20 , which could interlock with a 2-chain , as shown in figure  [ triangle.idea](a ) where @xmath21 is shaded . for then pulling away the vertex @xmath22 of the 2-chain from the triangle frame would diminish the angle @xmath23 , and pushing @xmath22 up toward the triangle",
    "would increase @xmath23 .",
    "but the only slack provided for @xmath23 is that determined by the diameter of the rings , as otherwise the triangular frame is rigid .     with @xmath24 . ]",
    "we can construct such a triangle using three links . at each vertex",
    ", we take one subchain @xmath25 and confine its crossing with another subchain @xmath24 to within a small region of space .",
    "see figure  [ triangle.idea](c ) for the idea .",
    "this pinning can be achieved by the `` @xmath26-tangle '' interlocking from   @xcite and `` jag loops . ''",
    "so the idea is to replace vertex @xmath27 with a small copy of the 3/4-tangle configuration .",
    "this can be accomplished with @xmath28 links for a @xmath26-tangle , but maximal sharing with both the incident incoming and outgoing triangle links reduces the number of links needed .",
    "we can achieve confinement with @xmath29 links at the tangle near @xmath27 . at the other two vertices of the triangle ,",
    "this can be accomplished with one extra link per vertex .",
    "therefore , together with the @xmath30 links for the main triangle skeleton , we use a total of @xmath31 links .",
    "we take a 3/4-tangle whose joints all stay within an @xmath16-ball centered at the midpoint of the middle link @xmath11 of the 3-chain .",
    "position the tangle to represent the bottom vertex of a triangle , with the links arranged as shown in figure  [ 10chain ] . at each of the other two vertices ,",
    "we add an extra link to make a _",
    "jag loop_.        the configuration in figure  [ 10chain ] is realizable , that is , there is more than enough flexibility in the design to ensure that @xmath32 and @xmath33 can indeed meet at the 2-chain vertex @xmath22 . to see that this is so ,",
    "notice that the 3-chain and the 4-chain in the 3/4-tangle can be configured to lie in planes that are nearly orthogonal .",
    "if we arrange the plane of the 2-chain at angles with respect to the two orthogonal planes within which the 3-chain and 4-chain lie , then we can thread the 2-chain ( @xmath32 following the link @xmath34 and @xmath33 following @xmath35 ) as in figure  [ 10chain ] to pass through one jag loop in the 4-chain and one loop made up by the end link @xmath36 and the links of the 3-chain at vertex @xmath7 , at the same time as weaving through the two jag loops at the base of the triangular frame from above , as depicted in the figure .",
    "the jag loops at the other two corners can be assured to remain in an @xmath16-ball by making the extra link lengths ( @xmath37 and @xmath38 ) shorter than @xmath16 .",
    "we can conclude exactly as in @xcite that the link @xmath32 passes through an @xmath16-ball at @xmath39 and can not unlock with the jag . note",
    "the link @xmath33 passing through the jag loop at @xmath40 is a flip of the case @xmath32 passing through the jag loop at @xmath39 .",
    "thus we have that all corners of the triangle stay within @xmath16-balls , and both @xmath32 and @xmath33 interlock the jag loops .              from the construction of the @xmath18-chain , link @xmath32 pierces @xmath41 , and links @xmath33 and @xmath32 straddle @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath36 .",
    "we will prove that the vertex @xmath22 can not penetrate the tetrahedron @xmath44 , the convex hull with vertices @xmath45 , which is highlighted in figure  [ 10chain1 ] below .",
    "assume @xmath22 can penetrate @xmath46 , that is , @xmath22 can move into the inside of the tetrahedron @xmath44 .",
    "note that the link @xmath33 passes through the @xmath16-ball at @xmath40 . when @xmath16 is sufficiently small , @xmath33 and @xmath35 come very close to @xmath40 .",
    "we may assume @xmath33 and @xmath35 meet near a point @xmath47 on @xmath35 ; then all points on @xmath48 except @xmath47 stay inside @xmath46 as @xmath46 is convex .",
    "this contradicts the fact that @xmath33 is weaved under @xmath43 and @xmath36 and the 2-chain @xmath49 straddles @xmath43 and @xmath36 .",
    "so the vertex @xmath22 can not penetrate the tetrahedron @xmath44",
    ".    therefore the @xmath1-chain links are trapped by the 3/4-tangle .",
    "therefore the only way the 2-chain could slide free of the near rigid triangular frame is if one of the end vertices enters the @xmath16-ball at the jag loop corners .",
    "thus the 2-chain @xmath49 can not slide free of any of the triangle corners if we make the 2-chain links extra long , so that the two end points can not enter the @xmath16-ball containing the corners .",
    "we recall lemma 4 from @xcite .",
    "_ when @xmath16 is sufficiently small , a line piercing two disks of radius @xmath16 can angularly deviate from the line connecting the disk centers at most @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the distance between the disk centers .",
    "_        let @xmath53 be the centers of the three @xmath16-balls containing the triangle corners , see figure  [ triangle.lemma](b ) .",
    "let the side length @xmath54 , and @xmath55 , and the altitude @xmath56 . without loss of generality , we assume that @xmath57 is an acute angle ( otherwise @xmath58 is acute , and use @xmath58 ) .",
    "furthermore , when @xmath16 is sufficiently small , @xmath59 can be assumed to remain an acute angle .",
    "draw a perpendicular line from @xmath60 to line @xmath32 and let @xmath10 be the point of intersection .",
    "similarly , draw a perpendicular line from @xmath22 to line @xmath36 and let @xmath61 be the point of intersection .",
    "let @xmath47 be the point of intersection of @xmath36 and @xmath32 .",
    "the following lemma captures the key constraint on the motion of the 2-link chain .",
    "since @xmath32 and @xmath33 both pass through the @xmath16-ball centered at @xmath64 , the distance from @xmath22 to @xmath36 is at least @xmath65 .",
    "on the other hand , figure  [ triangle.lemma](c ) illustrates the largest distance @xmath62 between @xmath22 and @xmath36 .",
    "note @xmath66 is a right triangle , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 , so @xmath69 since the tangent function is increasing on the interval @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "@xmath76 meets these balls in disks each of radius @xmath77 .",
    "the lemma above shows that the distance @xmath62 from the vertex @xmath22 to @xmath36 is bounded above and below .",
    "thus , by choosing @xmath16 small enough , we limit to any desired amount the distance vertex @xmath22 of the 2-link chain can be pushed toward or separated from the triangle .",
    "thus , when we choose @xmath16 small enough ( and @xmath32 , @xmath33 long enough ) to prevent the two end vertices of the 2-link chain from entering the @xmath16-balls , it ensures that the 2-link chain is interlocked with the triangle chain .",
    "below we sketch an argument that suggests , without formally establishing , that 10 links is the minimum needed for interlocking .",
    "our main theorem above proves that the minimum @xmath78 .",
    "we argue that the minimum @xmath0 can not be less than 10 by contradiction .",
    "assume there is a flexible @xmath79-chain in a nearly rigid triangular frame that can interlock with a flexible 2-chain and @xmath80 .",
    "furthermore , assume that at two vertices of the triangle frame , jag loops are used to allow maximal sharing of links to result in a minimum number of links .",
    "now take away the two extra links at the jag loops and the side of the triangle connecting the jag loops , we consider the remaining links in the @xmath79-chain , which consists of two open chains with a total of links @xmath81 . in the following",
    "we argue that two open chains with a total of @xmath81 links either can not occur , or can not form a loop to trap the 2-chain at the vertex @xmath22 .",
    "the cases of two open chains with a total of links @xmath82 are :      case ( 1 ) can not happen . for",
    ", if it does occur , then the 1-chain would be used as both the end link of the open 9-chain and as a side of the triangular frame , which allows the frame some flexibility and renders it too flexible . in cases ( 2 ) and ( 3 )",
    ", the chains can not interlock , so they can not interlock the 2-chain .    the cases of @xmath83",
    "may be argued analogously to the cases of @xmath84 .",
    "the reason this sketch is not a formal proof is that we are assuming that , in order to reduce the number of links used , interlocking must be achieved by  rigidifying \" the 2-chain to a nearly rigid triangle .",
    "a more direct contradiction from the assumption of locking with a 9-chain would be desirable .",
