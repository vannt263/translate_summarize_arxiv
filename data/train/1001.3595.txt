    "among the many significant ideas and developments that connect mathematics with contemporary physics one that would have certainly intrigued riemann himself is the role that quantum field theory ( qft ) plays in geometry and topology .",
    "we can argue back and forth on the relevance of such a role , but the perspective qft offers is often surprising and far reaching .",
    "examples abound , and a fine selection is provided by the revealing insights offered by yang ",
    "mills theory into the topology of @xmath0manifolds , by the relation between knot theory and topological qft , and most recently by the interaction between strings , riemann moduli space , and enumerative geometry .",
    "doubtless many of the most striking connections suggested by physicists failed to pass the censorship of the department of mathematics , and so do not appear in the above official list .",
    "however , the role of these connections does not wholly fade out as a source of inspiration of mathematically interesting results . as an example that i would like to enter in the above inventory , and which passed into rather general use , is the role of path integral techniques and of the attendant renormalization group philosophy .",
    "as ill  defined these techniques may be , if we give them some degree of mathematical acceptance then the geometrical perspective they afford is always quite non  trivial and extremely rich .",
    "it is within such a framework that we shall examine here some aspects of the relation between the renormalization group analysis of a particular class of qfts and the ricci flow . in recent years",
    ", ricci flow has been the point of departure and the motivating example for important developments in geometric analysis , most spectacularly for g. perelman s proof @xcite of thurston s geometrization program @xcite for three - manifolds and of the attendant poincar conjecture . for one of those strange circumstances not unusual in the history of science ,",
    "the ricci flow , introduced in the early 80s by richard hamilton@xcite , independently appeared on the scene also in physics . indeed , daniel friedan , studying the weak coupling limit of the renormalization group flow for non - linear sigma models , introduced @xcite what later on came to be known as the hamilton ",
    "deturck version of the ricci flow .",
    "this qft avatar of the ricci flow was largely ignored in geometry until g. perelman acknowledged @xcite that in his groundbreaking analysis he was somewhat inspired by the role that the effective action plays in non  linear @xmath1model theory .",
    "this soon called attention to the fact that in qft the ricci flow is naturally embedded into a more general geometric flow , the renormalization group flow for non ",
    "linear @xmath1 models , which , even if mathematically ill - defined , provides an interpretation for the ricci flow which is open to generalizations .",
    "in particular , the physics of non ",
    "linear @xmath1 models shows that near a curvature singularity the renormalization group flow is no longer approximated by the ricci flow but it should be replaced by a geometric flow comprising new fields , coupled to geometry , that may give rise to a non  singular continuation of the flow .",
    "there are strong reasons to believe that the relevant singularity  suppressing contribution to this new dynamics does not come from the higher order loop expansions of the renormalization group , ( providing corrections to the ricci flow which are proportional to powers of the riemann tensor and of its derivatives , and which may even enhance the formation of singularities by introducing more reaction terms into the game ) .",
    "rather , it is the physics of strong coupling that seems to play a role in singularity avoidance @xcite by providing mass  generating mechanisms that transmute a collapsing solution of the ricci flow ( _ e.g. _ a shrinking soliton ) into a massive theory .",
    "the existence of a mass gap will imply that the shrinking soliton disappears .",
    "alternatively , we may have a supersymmetry  driven mechanism generating a topological transmutation allowing the flow to be continued through the singular geometry .",
    "renormalization group is too much a circle of idea rather than a theory , and thus it is not yet clear to what extent these indications may actually help in simplifying the actual , _",
    "ricci flow@xmath2surgery _ ,",
    "proof of the geometrization theorem . we are thus forced to dismantle the narrative , in favor of a mathematical truth unshaped by physics , and conclude these introductory remarks by stressing that it is in qft that the ricci flow is paying back .",
    "indeed , the understanding and the classification of singularities and the role of ricci solitons , has provided new strategies in the analysis of the landscape of the spaces of quantum field theories .",
    "we offer our own strategy which emphasizes the important role played by ricci flow singularities and provide what we consider a natural mechanism for extending , beyond the weak coupling regime , the embedding of the ricci flow into the renormalization group flow . in any case , we leave the reader the choice of which track to follow in studying the connection between renormalization of non  linear @xmath1 models and ricci flow theory .",
    "the amount of ( intentional ) and fortuitous inconsistencies in our presentation stresses the urge , for those aiming to a deep understanding of every small detail of this connection , to read the original work by daniel friedan @xcite , sasha zamolodchikov @xcite , and arkady tseytlin @xcite .",

    "to place the arguments to follow in a natural geometrical context , let us denote by @xmath3 and @xmath4 smooth riemannian manifolds with @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and let @xmath7 be the associated space of continuous maps . for simplicity of exposition we assume here that both the surface @xmath8 and the manifold @xmath4 are compact and oriented , and to allay anxiety we may suppose that @xmath9 is of sobolev class @xmath10 . in such a framework , let us consider the set of natural lagrangians on @xmath11 defined by some finite order jet of mappings @xmath12 from @xmath11 to the space of ( smooth ) functions @xmath13 , which are invariant under the diffeomorphism groups @xmath14 , and @xmath15 , and depend on a set of geometrical fields defined on @xmath4 , collectively denoted by @xmath16 , and which play the role of couplings parameters of the theory , ( fig . 1 and fig .",

    "this is a natural procedure which characterizes the action @xmath18 $ ] as a deformation of the fiducial @xmath51 $ ] .",

    "the biasing mechanism is through quantum interference ( qft proper ) or through stochastic analysis ( euclidean qft ) .",
    "in a ( very few ) favourable cases , the two mechanisms are related ( axiomatic qft ) and the resulting theory allows for a formalism which is rather appealing in its mathematical structure . a good example which is worthwhile to keep in mind , and which to some extent fits nicely in our geometrical set up is the case when @xmath3 is the circle and @xmath82 is a pointed riemannian manifold , _ i.e. _ , the loop space @xmath83 .",
    "this space is naturally endowed with a probability measure , the pinned wiener measure @xmath84 on continuous paths in @xmath4 starting and ending at some fixed point @xmath85 , and it is the framework appropriate for blending quantum mechanics with the riemannian geometry of @xmath23 . if the target manifold @xmath4 is a compact lie group , ( endowed with a bi  invariant riemannian metric ) , then the measure space @xmath86 is invariant under the flow induced by @xmath87 vector fields on @xmath83 @xcite .",
