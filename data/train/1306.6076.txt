    "a knowledge of the three - dimensional mass distribution of spiral galaxy disks is critical to understanding galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "unfortunately , kinematic measurements of rotation curves only provide the total ( stellar disk + dark matter ) mass distribution .",
    "generally , this issue has been avoided by making the assumption that stellar disks contribute all of the mass governing the rotation curve at small radii ( the `` maximal disk hypothesis '' , @xcite ) .",
    "however , the recent finding of significant disk submaximality @xcite indicates that the maximal disk hypothesis is , at best , not universally applicable and , at worst , invalid .",
    "additionally , the choice of low - inclination galaxies is necessitated by the methodology of these new mass - decomposition methods , making them insensitive to morphological determinations of individual disk components ( if multiple disks exist ) .",
    "disk mass can also be probed independently of the total gravitational potential by measuring the amount of starlight present in a galaxy and converting it into mass via a mass - to - light ratio @xmath6 . traditionally @xmath7 is found by fitting stellar population synthesis ( sps ) models to the integrated galaxy light @xcite .",
    "however , the values for @xmath7 computed this way are dependent on many significant assumptions , leading to large uncertainties in @xmath7 ( see @xcite for a discussion ) .",
    "additionally , any estimates of luminosity are dependent on attenuation from dust within the galaxy , which is known to be both clumpy and inclination dependent ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "lastly , as these sps models are created with the integrated light of a galaxy , they can not distinguish between different stellar disks , the detailed parameters of which can be significant for estimates of the disk mass @xcite .",
    "observing edge - on galaxies presents the best conditions for the identification and characterization of multiple disks , as any projection effects are minimized .",
    "however , the effects of dust attenuation are also maximized in galaxies with this orientation . while not as significant an issue in low - mass galaxies , where the dust is not tightly concentrated into a narrow lane @xcite and some galaxies are within the _ hubble space telescope _ s range for resolved stellar population studies of the vertical structure @xcite , in high mass galaxies similar to the milky way ( mw ) determining disk structure near",
    "the midplane is a considerable challenge .",
    "the problem of attenuation from the dust lanes of massive , edge - on galaxies is mitigated somewhat by observing in the infrared , where light is minimally absorbed by dust .",
    "ideally observations would be taken in the mid - infrared ( mir ) , around 3 - 4 @xmath8 m , where attenuation is at its minimum and just blueward of the point where thermal emission from cool dust begins to dominate the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) .",
    "however , this spectral region contains several narrow emission lines from non - thermal polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) molecules , as well as some continuum flux from very hot , small grains @xcite . additionally , to avoid the high opacity of the earth s atmosphere at these wavelengths , observations in the mir",
    "must be taken on space - based telescopes , which places strict limitations on the size of their mirrors .",
    "current - generation space - based telescopes with mir capabilities , such as the _ spitzer space telescope _ @xcite and _ wide - field infrared survey explorer _",
    "@xcite , have relatively poor ( @xmath91 ) resolution , which is generally too coarse to resolve surface - brightness profiles very near the midplane in all but the closest galaxies ( 90 pc , roughly the scale height of the young disk in the mw @xcite , is @xmath101at 20 mpc ) . at these wavelengths",
    "the diffraction limit also starts to become a significant limiting factor on resolution : _ spitzer _ , for example , has a diffraction limit of @xmath31.2at 4@xmath8 m .",
    "ground - based near - infrared ( nir ; @xmath30.7 - 2.3@xmath8 m ) detectors have improved dramatically in recent years and now can rival optical detectors in resolution and noise characteristics ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , while pah emission is no longer a concern , attenuation can still be significant ; @xcite find a central edge - on k - band optical depth of @xmath33 for ngc  891 , for example . due to the higher resolution and lack of dust emission , however , the nir is the best choice for detailed studies of stellar disk parameters near the midplane of massive galaxies .",
    "other researchers have turned to the nir in order to reduce the dust - lane attenuation of edge - on spirals .",
    "@xcite fit the surface - brightness distribution of an h - band image of ngc  5907 with a single vertical disk component , while @xcite perform a similar fit to ngc  4565 in the k - band .",
    "both studies follow @xcite in assuming that even for edge - on galaxies the effects of dust attenuation in the nir are minimal , which may contribute to their difficulties in fitting the vertical profiles . more recently , @xcite fit 2d models to edge - on galaxies from a survey with fwhm resolution of @xmath31 in the @xmath4-band @xcite",
    ". however , this survey is not local enough to resolve super - thin disks ( 1@xmath3300 pc at the sample s average hubble flow distance of 67 mpc ) and is also deliberately biased towards low surface - brightness galaxies .",
    "@xcite do make an effort to correct for the effects of dust in k - band vertical surface brightness profiles of ngc  891 .",
    "however , they model the dust as a foreground screen , as opposed to a more physically realistic ( albeit more complex ) intermixture of dust and starlight . @xcite",
    "use a smooth .",
    "axisymmetric distribution of dust and starlight to fit radiative transfer models to optical and infrared data on a small sample of nearby edge - on galaxies , including ngc  891 .",
    "while comparable to or better than current space - based capabilities in the mir , none of these studies have high enough resolution in the nir to fully explore any disk components with scale - heights similar to the mw s young , star - forming disk at heights where they are likely to dominate the vertical surface - brightness profile .    in this paper",
    "we present high - resolution ( @xmath11 ) nir observations of ngc  891 , a massive edge - on spiral galaxy often compared to the mw . as a relatively isolated system without significant signs of interaction in its starlight",
    "( although it contains significant amounts of extra - planar gas ; @xcite ) , ngc 891 is an excellent test case for studies of passive disk evolution in massive galaxies .",
    "we combine these nir observations with 3-dimensional monte carlo radiative transfer ( rt ) models , based on prior studies of ngc  891 @xcite , which employ fractally clumped dust and dust - enshrouded star - formation .",
    "we use these models to compute an attenuation correction that is both astrophysically realistic and specifically tailored to ngc  891 . in order to obtain a wider color baseline for the attenuation correction , we use archival _ spitzer _ irac @xcite 3.6 and 4.5@xmath8 m data in complement to the nir data . while these data have a larger pixel size than the nir data the surface brightness is generally smoothly varying , and as such introduces only a small amount of error into the attenuation corrections while allowing for a much tighter correction even at high attenuation .",
    "we then apply this correction to our data , allowing us to produce fully attenuation - corrected surface - brightness ( sb ) profiles of ngc  891 and for the first time investigate disk morphology near the midplane of a massive spiral galaxy outside of the mw .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : data ] we present our data and describe our reduction software .",
    "we then detail our approach to removing the attenuation in section [ sec : dustcorr ] .",
    "light profiles and two - dimensional fits to the data are presented in section [ sec : sbprofiles ] .",
    "we discuss our results in a broader context in section [ sec : discussion ] , and make concluding remarks in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "we assume a distance to ngc  891 of 9.5 mpc , so 1  = 46 pc .",
    "all observations were obtained with the wiyn 3.5 m telescope at kitt peak national observatory during an observing run in october 2011 .",
    "we used the wiyn high - resolution infrared camera ( whirc ; @xcite ) near - infrared imager , and took data in the broadband j , h , and @xmath4 filters .",

    "three regions of ngc  891 ( the center , along the major axis ne of the center , and along the major axis to the sw ) were observed to provide coverage on both sides of the galaxy out to @xmath3 2.5 and 14 k - band thin disk scale - lengths and scale - heights , respectively ( 10 and 4.7 kpc ; @xcite ) .",
    "enough overlap was left between these pointings to allow for combined mosaics to be produced .",
    "multiple exposures were taken in each band at each pointing in a dither pattern ( with offsets between dithers @xmath3 15for j and h and 25for @xmath4 ) and averaged into a mosaic ; the seeing estimates provided in table [ tab : obslog ] are for the image mosaics and come from gaussian fits to foreground stars in the image using the iraf task imexam .",
    "in addition to the on - source data , we also intersperse dithers of a sky field to aid in sky background subtraction ; the total exposure time of the sky dithers is of the same order as the total on - source exposure time .",
    "all observations were taken under photometric conditions .",
    "mean seeing conditions were 08 , 067 , and 063 fwhm in j , h , and @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "full details of the data reduction can be found in appendix [ sec : rdx ] , and a false - color image of our final mosaics is shown in figure [ fig : jhkimage ] .",
    "we downloaded `` post - basic '' calibrated data of ngc  891 from the _ spitzer _ archive in the 3.6 and 4.5 @xmath8 m irac channels .",
    "the images were inspected for defects .",
    "very low level surface gradients were found across the images and surface - subtracted using the iterative method described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the resolution of the irac data is @xmath31.8/arcsec ( fwhm ) , twice as large as the worst quality jh@xmath4 data . at these wavelengths , however , the surface - brightness distribution of ngc  891 is fairly smooth and slowly varying .",
    "therefore we interpolate the irac data to match the whirc mosaics , assuming that oversampling the irac images does not contribute significant additional uncertainties to our computed attenuation correction and will not significantly degrade the resolution of the mosaics .",
    "estimating the dust extinction on sight - lines to individual stars inside the milky way is relatively easy because we can assume the dust is a foreground - screen ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the task of estimating the internal extinction becomes far more difficult for external galaxies due to the complex interplay between stellar and dust geometries .",
    "for such systems the @xcite obscuration law is generally used .",
    "however , the @xcite law is designed for statistical studies of starbursts , not for detailed studies of individual galaxies and , moreover , does not take into account the inclination dependence of the obscuration law as seen in rt models @xcite of disk galaxies . in the past",
    ", studies presenting surface photometry of edge - on spiral galaxies have avoided the midplane in their analysis ( e.g. @xcite ) or used simplistic dust corrections ( e.g. @xcite ) . here , we are able to focus on the midplane of ngc  891 using high - resolution nir photometry and advanced rt models .      without knowing the 3d distribution of both dust and",
    "stars it is impossible to perfectly attenuation - correct images of ngc  891 .",
    "however , we can compute a statistically accurate correction by modeling the dependence of color on the attenuation at multiple points in a simulated galaxy , which produces the average attenuation as well as the statistical uncertainty due to the varying distributions of stars and dust in different sight - lines .",
    "this correction is then broadly applicable for real galaxies with similar physical parameters ( e.g. dust clumpiness ) and orientations .",
    "we base our models on the ngc  891 models of @xcite , with a bulge , two stellar disks ( an old , thin disk and young super - thin disk ) , and a dust disk .",
    "we use the same physical scales and un - attenuated stellar seds for all components as in @xcite , however instead of individual molecular cloud - sized clumps we choose to first place half of the total dust mass in fractal clumps .",
    "we choose not to model spiral structure : the rearrangement of dust and starlight might change the distribution of attenuation across the galaxy but should not effect the color resulting from a given amount of attenuation . furthermore , the addition of spiral structure has a negligible effect on the integrated galaxy sed @xcite ; therefore ignoring spirality will not significantly alter the parameters of a given rt model .",
    "both the percentage of dust in the fractal component as well as the details of the construction of the fractal grid follow from the median values for these parameters found in @xcite s modeling of ngc  891 - briefly , roughly 50% of the total dust mass is in clumps . in our models here",
    "the clumpy component is divided up into 130 fractal clumps .",
    "we choose to use the stellar emission parameters from @xcite instead of this more recent work because @xcite fit the entire sed of ngc  891 whereas @xcite were most concerned about the clumpy nature of the dust in absorption and therefore only explored models without dust emission .",
    "the young super - thin disk component is placed proportionately to the dust density in each grid cell . in this way",
    "the super - thin disk is not only clumpy , but the clumpy stellar emission is co - spatial with the dust clumps . in order to fit the integrated sed both in the uv and the mir",
    ", we find that we must also set a minimum dust density threshold below which there is zero emission from young stars .",
    "this threshold mimics the effect of having a gas surface density threshold for star formation @xcite .",
    "the unattenuated stellar seds ( again , following @xcite ) are set to that of an sb stellar sed for a galaxy with no dust from @xcite .",
    "the light from stars with m @xmath10 3 m@xmath12 is used as the input for the bulge and thin disk , while light from stars with m @xmath9 3 m@xmath12 is assigned to the super - thin disk .",

    "however , due to the minimum dust density threshold and the addition of clumpiness , the axial ratio of the super - thin disk has less physical meaning than for the thin disk : at large distances from the center of the galaxy and/or the midplane the super - thin disk will be essentially truncated .",
    "the physical parameters of the thin disk and dust component are based on the results of @xcite .",

    "we also note that @xcite have an extra component of diffuse dust with the same scale parameters as the super - thin disk .    for the model used here",
    "we mapped a 100x100x100 cell cartesian grid to a 40x40x5 kpc volume , where the 5 kpc dimension represents vertical height above and below the disk80 pc while the whirc resolution is @xmath340 pc . ] .",
    "we chose to employ a rectangular grid rather than a cubical one to properly sample the vertical extent of the dust grid , which ( as shown in table [ tab : modelparams ] ) has a scale - height in our model of only 200 pc . in our previous work @xcite , we used a rt code that only tracked scattering and absorption of photons emitted at a specific wavelength .",
    "the rt is performed by the hyperion software package @xcite , which computes the full sed of a model .",
    "hyperion uses an iterative scheme to compute the dust temperature , and we use 100 million photon packets per iteration ( an average of 100 photon packets per grid cell ) for both for the temperature calculation iterations and to produce seds and images . we compare the output sed of the model to data in figure [ fig : sedmodels ] . while the model has difficulty reproducing the mid - ir features associated with pah emission and photo - dissociation regions , @xcite indicate that this is likely due to a resolution effect in our models .",
    "regardless of the reason for this discrepancy we are most concerned about the sed between 1@xmath24 ( @xmath8m)@xmath105 , where the model appears to fit the data well .      to correct for the effects of dust on star - light we ran the model ( described in section [ sec : rtmodel ] ) twice : once with and once without any dust .",
    "we produced images in j , h , @xmath4 , 3.6@xmath8 m , and 4.5 @xmath8 m for both model runs at the inclination of ngc 891 ( 89.7@xmath25 , @xcite ) .",
    "the attenuation @xmath26 at any given pixel is then simply @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the flux of the model with dust and @xmath29 is the flux of the model without dust .",
    "note that we use ` attenuation ' here broadly to include the threefold effects of dust : absorption , scattering , * and * emission .",
    "the latter is of particular importance moving into the mir .",
    "as can be seen figure [ fig : sedmodels ] ( and will be discussed again in section [ sec : multidust ] ) , there is a very strong , narrow pah feature which lies within the irac 3.6 @xmath8 m bandpass .",
    "the 4.5 @xmath8 m filter , on the other hand , has no discrete dust components , although it is somewhat affected by continuum dust emission .",
    "we find that dust emission contributes 12% and 9% of the total integrated 3.6@xmath8 m and 4.5@xmath8 m model flux , respectively .",
    "local values , along sight - lines involving dust clumps , are likely higher : @xcite find ranges of 5 - 13% contamination at 3.6@xmath8 m in the integrated light of _ spitzer _ survey of stellar structure in galaxies ( s@xmath30 g ) targets but local amounts around 20% in star - forming regions .",
    "therefore , based on the reduced contamination from dust emission at 4.5@xmath8 m as well as the fact that it provides a larger wavelength baseline for other attenuation effects ( absorption and scattering ) , we expect that the 4.5@xmath8 m data will be more useful for estimating the nir attenuation than the 3.6@xmath8 m data .    with these considerations in mind we inspected the relationship between color and @xmath4-band attenuation of the model ( figure [ fig : acorr ] ) .",
    "an ideal attenuation correction metric would have both a tight and steep relationship between attenuation and color  i.e. , a small error in color leads to a small error in the estimated attenuation .",
    "the j- and h-@xmath4 corrections both have very small slopes at @xmath31 mag , making them poor choices for use as attenuation correctors .",
    "all nir - irac colors ( nir-4.5 @xmath8 m colors are shown in figure [ fig : acorr ] , but the trends are very similar for nir-3.6 @xmath8 m colors ) have similar slopes at @xmath31 of @xmath31 mag in color per mag in attenuation , which indicates that either the attenuation in the 4.5@xmath8 m band is slowly varying or dust emission is , on average , offsetting the light losses due to attenuation at that wavelength .    while the nir - irac colors have similar responses to increasing attenuation , the @xmath4 - 4.5@xmath8 m ( also @xmath4 - 3.6@xmath8 m ) color clearly has the least scatter in the relationship .",
    "this is likely due to two factors : the @xmath4-band has less dust attenuation than either j or h , and that @xmath4 is significantly redward of the wein peak for even the coolest stars , which makes the @xmath4-irac color insensitive to the effects of different stellar populations .",
    "this feature is especially critical because it means that the assumptions we made about the parameters of the super - thin disk in section [ sec : rtmodel ] will not bias our results .",
    "indeed , the attenuation corrections we produce use data at all positions in the model galaxy , and show a single trend applicable across the entire disk . for these reasons and those given concerning mir dust contamination earlier in this section , we choose to use the @xmath4 - 4.5@xmath8 m color to correct the attenuation .",
    "we take the 1-@xmath32 error on the attenuation correction in @xmath33 and propagate that with the errors on the data to compute the final errors for the corrected surface - brightness images .      to test the applicability of model a we overlaid color - color profiles of the model on the data and checked for discrepancies .",
    "we compared the colors as a function of both r and z to isolate any trends with position .",
    "a sample set of @xmath4 - 3.6@xmath8 m versus j-@xmath4 color - color distributions is shown in figure [ fig : cc36profiles ] ; @xmath4 - 4.5@xmath8 m versus j-@xmath4 distributions are shown in figure [ fig : cc45profiles ] .    at large distances from the midplane ( high z values ) , both the model and the data trend toward @xmath4 - 3.6@xmath8 m and @xmath4 - 4.5@xmath8 m colors of zero and j-@xmath4 colors of @xmath31 mag .",
    "the @xmath4-irac color is a result of even the coolest stars being on the rayleigh - jeans tail in those spectral regions  the slopes of all stars are self - similar at these wavelengths , so vega colors go to zero .",
    "we note that the large j-@xmath4 color implies the presence of very cool stars  a j-@xmath4 color of 1 mag is as red as the coldest dwarf in @xcite .",
    "if the nir light at these heights is dominated by giants , the j-@xmath4 color is roughly equivalent to a m2iii star or an o - rich agb with t@xmath343500 k @xcite .",
    "it is also evident that at small height model a fails to reproduce the colors of the data ; model colors are increasingly too red in @xmath4 - 3.6 and @xmath4 - 4.5 when z@xmath350.5 kpc . properly modeling the colors at",
    "z@xmath100.5 kpc is crucial , as the midplane is where attenuation from dust is the strongest * and * any signal from a super - thin disk component would be most apparent . while there is better overlap when using the @xmath4 - 4.5@xmath8 m color ( top panel of figure [ fig : cc45profiles ] ) , model a still produces redder @xmath4 - 4.5@xmath8 m colors than the data .",
    "the culprit for the discrepancy in the colors appears to be an excess of pah line emission in the model , as seen in figure [ fig : sedmodels ] : there is a weak emission line at @xmath33.5@xmath8 m which falls within the irac 3.6@xmath8 m bandpass , while the wings of several lines contribute to the flux in the 4.5@xmath8 m band .",
    "there are ( at least ) two possible reasons for this discrepancy .",
    "the first is that there are fewer pahs relative to other grain sizes near the midplane of ngc  891 . reducing the amount of pahs decreases the total 3.6/4.5@xmath8 m flux , increasing the @xmath4 - 3.6/4.5@xmath8 m color without affecting the j-@xmath4 color .",
    "lowered pah levels near the midplane could be the result of pah grain destruction in high density areas , similar to what is seen in the mw ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "on the other hand there is also empirical evidence that , contrary to what is frequently assumed in dust models ( including the model used here ) , the extinction law flattens in the mir @xcite . flattening the extinction law for the irac bands would also have the effect of reducing the @xmath4 - 3.6/4.5@xmath8 m color at higher attenuations while leaving the nir colors unchanged .    a full investigation of why a mw dust model has difficulty producing proper @xmath4 - 3.6/4.5@xmath8 m colors is beyond the scope of this work , given that we are merely concerned with computing a proper attenuation correction rather than conclusively determining the root cause of the attenuation . for simplicity",
    ", we choose to adjust the pah levels in high density regions instead of changing the entire extinction law .",
    "therefore we ran a second rt model with two prescriptions for the fraction of different sized dust grains . in this new model ( called model",
    "b ) voxels with dust densities @xmath36",
    "@xmath37 g @xmath19 are weighted 15% for ultra - small grains , 10% for small grains , and 75% for large grains , while high - density voxels use the following breakdown of grain sizes : 1% ultra - small grains , 35% small grains , and 64% large grains .",
    "all other quantities are held constant save the bolometric luminosity of the thin disk , which is decreased by @xmath37% .",
    "these changes were made empirically by eye to better reproduce the ir colors of the data while still accurately fitting the integrated sed .",
    "the sed of model b is shown alongside that of model a in figure [ fig : sedmodels ] , and color - color @xmath4 - 3.6/4.5@xmath8 m versus j-@xmath4 profiles are shown in the bottom panel of figures [ fig : cc36profiles ] and [ fig : cc45profiles ] .    model b s sed has only 9% and 6% of the total 3.6@xmath8 m and 4.5@xmath8 m flux contributed by dust emission , generally better replicates the color distribution of ngc  891 than model a. there are still some minor discrepancies between the data and the model in the mir , however , which are shown in figure [ fig : iracccprofiles ] . the model",
    "3.6@xmath8m-4.5@xmath8 m color is systematically bluer than the the data . near the midplane",
    "this is largely caused by the mismatch in the 3.6@xmath8 m flux as discussed earlier , but at large heights some of the discrepancy arises from the model being slightly too faint at 4.5@xmath8 m ( visible in the bottom panels of both models in figure [ fig : cc45profiles ] ) .",
    "this mismatch is @xmath350.08 mag , which implies that the y - intercepts of the attenuation correction formulae in appendix [ sec : attenuationdetails ] should be shifted by approximately that amount .",
    "the systematic error resulting from this mismatch will therefore be at the @xmath358% level , which should only impact flux measurements and ( as will be seen later ) does not have a significant effect on any of our conclusions . while the 3.6@xmath8 m model flux does match the data at large heights , due to the aforementioned significant mismatch in dust - obscured regions we still consider the 4.5@xmath8 m flux as more reliable for this purpose , systematic error notwithstanding .",
    "we will investigate ways to improve our input seds for future publications , but for now we will focus on demonstrating the rest of our methodology on ngc  891 .",
    "functionally , adjusting the dust distribution decreases the reddening in the @xmath4-irac@xmath8 m color while leaving j-@xmath4 essentially unchanged .",
    "in addition to the systematic error in intrinsic mir color , to have some leverage on our systematic uncertainty caused by our imperfect knowledge of the dust distribution we generally perform subsequent analyses with * both * models , using only model b when we do not expect to see different responses to analysis from the two models and the savings in computation time is significant .      the exact behavior of the attenuation as a function of color will be different in each bandpass , so we fit @xmath26 separately for j , h , and @xmath4 . fitting the attenuation from the rt models is non - trivial , largely because at low @xmath26 the slope of the attenuation curve changes significantly while at large attenuations the function becomes linear .",
    "this problem is compounded by the dearth of model data at very high attenuations .",
    "these factors lead to poor fits of single polynomial functions , especially at large @xmath26 . to deal with this issue",
    "we    employ piecewise fits of the attenuation curve .",
    "details of our method and the formulae for the resulting fits are shown in appendix [ sec : attenuationdetails ] .",
    "the attenuation fits are plotted against the model data in figure [ fig : colorfixcompare ] . in all cases",
    "it is apparent that the model trends are well fit . in figure",
    "[ fig : colorfixcompare ] we also compare the fits between models a and b. at low attenuations model b has much more complex behavior , although for all three bands the two models are within @xmath30.1 mag of each other in @xmath26 . at large attenuations",
    "the attenuation relations have very similar slopes but are offset from each other by about 0.3 mag in j , h , and @xmath4 .",
    "model b has more extinction at a given @xmath4 - 4.5@xmath8 m color than model a , for @xmath4 - 4.5@xmath8 m @xmath38 0.5 mag .",
    "the difference in behavior between the models at large values of @xmath4 - 4.5@xmath8 m arises because the depletion of pah grains in model b acts to lower the amount of line / continuum emission from dust at @xmath35 - 6@xmath8 m , the tail of which is blue enough to affect the 4.5@xmath8 m irac band .",
    "the attenuation in the @xmath4-band , however , is not strongly affected by changes in pah densities and therefore remains essentially constant .",
    "the result is that model b has bluer @xmath4 - 4.5@xmath8 m colors for a given @xmath26 , seen in figure [ fig : colorfixcompare ] .",
    "this also indicates that model a overpredicts the 4.5@xmath8 m surface brightness near the midplane by @xmath30.3 mag arcsec@xmath39 .      assuming a mw extinction law and a foreground screen of dust , @xcite correct their k - band emission by the formula @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the uncorrected k - band surface brightness and @xmath42 is the corrected k - band surface brightness . as the reddest filter and therefore the data least likely to be affected by errors in the attenuation correction , we follow @xcite and focus on our @xmath4-band data .",
    "we show the uncorrected @xmath4 data along with corrected @xmath4 profiles in figure [ fig : correctioncompare ] on both sides of ngc  891 at 3 , 5 , 7 , and 9 kpc in radius .",
    "we plot the vertical profiles at these positions because they show data at high s / n while avoiding bulge contamination , and are representative of the profiles at all radii . while the k and @xmath4-bands are not identical , we use the @xcite attenuation correction on our data to obtain a schematic understanding of the differences between it and our rt methodology .",
    "we find that generally both dust models in this work have larger peak attenuation than the @xcite correction .",
    "model a is on average brighter by @xmath30.16 mag , while model b is brighter by @xmath30.33 mag .",
    "this discrepancy is likely due to the saturation of the h-@xmath4 color at large optical depths ( @xcite and see figure [ fig : acorr ] ) , which we are less sensitive to since we are using @xmath4 - 4.5@xmath8 m color and models that accurately represent this effect .",
    "additionally , while the attenuation corrected vertical profiles of both model a and model b peak at a relatively consistent location at all radii , the peak of the @xcite dust corrected data has much more variation ( especially visible at 5 and 9 kpc ) .",
    "our two rt models are very similar to each other , but ( as predicted by figure [ fig : colorfixcompare ] ) the model with a pah - depleted grain size distribution in high - density regions ( model b ) leads to larger inferred @xmath26 for a given @xmath4 - 4.5@xmath8 m color than in model a , resulting in a brighter corrected @xmath43 .",
    "a false color jh@xmath4 image of the central portion of the dust - corrected galaxy ( using model b ) is shown in figure [ fig : imagecompare ] , compared to the rescaled image before attenuation correction and the irac 4.5@xmath8 m image .",
    "the central bulge region can now be clearly seen in the midplane .",
    "additionally , while the majority of the dust - corrected image is smoothly varying , in several places ( marked on figure [ fig : imagecompare ] ) there appear to be regions of slightly enhanced flux .",
    "these regions clearly correspond to areas with excess flux in the irac 4.5@xmath8 m image , indicating that they are real flux overdensities and not artifacts of the attenuation correction process .",
    "these are likely candidates for star - forming regions .",
    "while parts of the three regions are visible as bright point - source knots of light even before attenuation correction ( most easily visible in figure [ fig : jhkimage ] ) , the true nir projected size of these areas is only revealed after attenuation correction .    in general , the remarkable similarity between the morphology in the attenuation - corrected @xmath4 image and the irac 4.5@xmath8 m image is a confirmation that our correction method is accurate .",
    "this similarity is not tautological since the relation between attenuation and color is based on the rt - model predictions and not the data .",
    "we show ngc  891 s jh@xmath4 radial surface brightness profile along the major axis ( i.e. z=0 ) un - corrected for dust attenuation in figure [ fig : radialsbwdust ] .",
    "the vertical bin size is 0.9or @xmath340 pc .",
    "the radial profiles with dust are very similar to those shown in figure 9 of @xcite , except that our data shows a distinct bump in all bands at @xmath33 kpc on the sw side while they only see that feature in h and k. the reason for this discrepancy is unclear , but it indicates that this 3 kpc feature is a stellar over - density , not a dusty spiral arm as hypothesized by @xcite .",
    "we also present un - corrected j-@xmath4 and h-@xmath4 major axis color profiles in the left panel of figure [ fig : radialcolorwdust ] .",
    "the j-@xmath4 profile seems to show a weak trend towards bluer colors with increasing radius , but there is significant scatter .",
    "the h-@xmath4 profile shows a similarly weak trend .",
    "no color trend is visible as a function of radius when using attenuation corrected profiles ( right panel of figure [ fig : radialcolorwdust ] ) .",
    "there is also an asymmetry between the ne and sw colors of ngc  891 around r@xmath33 kpc , in the same position with the apparent stellar overdensity discussed previously in figure [ fig : radialsbwdust ] .    our major axis",
    "radial profiles also show the northeast side of ngc  891 , which was not shown in @xcite due to noise issues in the h band on their detector . comparing the radial profiles on both sides of the bulge",
    "shows the significant amount of stochastic structure in the midplane .",
    "in addition to the bumps noted by @xcite the southwest side has another light enhancement at @xmath37.5 kpc and a marked dearth of light at @xmath35.5 kpc . the northwest side appears to have fewer of these strong features , however , although it certainly has its fair share of smaller bumps and wiggles .",
    "all of these features point to the strong observable effect of clumpy dust and starlight , even at these long wavelengths .",
    "we compare the @xmath4-band major axis radial profile from figure [ fig : radialsbwdust ] to its dust - corrected counterpart ( using model b ) in the left panel of figure [ fig : radialsbdustcompare ] .",
    "the dust - corrected profile is uniformly brighter than the fiducial profile , which is to be expected .",
    "several local surface - brightness peaks seen in the observed profile are not present in the dust - corrected profile ( at @xmath44 kpc , for instance , on the sw side ) while others have been enhanced .",
    "the apparent star - forming regions mentioned in the previous section all correspond to local maxima in the dust - corrected profile ; of particular note is point ` b ' , which does not stand out on the original profile . also interesting is the ` trough ' on the sw side of the dust - corrected profile between 4 and 6.5 kpc .",
    "while the original profile has a local minima in the same region , it is much smaller in radial width .",
    "it seems likely that striking appearance of this feature is due to a combination of a real intensity drop - off at @xmath45 kpc and the enhancement of the underlying smooth profile at @xmath37 kpc ( point ` c ' ) .    just from looking at the attenuation - corrected radial surface - brightness and color profiles ( figures [ fig : radialcolorwdust ] and [ fig : radialsbdustcompare ] ) it is difficult to discern whether the asymmetries in the flux and color profiles are due to stellar density enhancements , intrinsic color variations , or both .",
    "figure [ fig : majoraxisdeltas ] shows the magnitude and color differentials between the sw and ne sides of the major axis profiles , where @xmath46 is defined as the magnitude difference between corresponding @xmath340 pc@xmath5 cells at the same radii but on opposite sides of ngc  891 s midplane .",
    "figure [ fig : majoraxisdeltas ] clearly indicates that asymmetries in surface brightness are correlated with color  brighter regions of ngc  891 s midplane are also bluer .",
    "the mean attenuation - corrected j-@xmath4 and h-@xmath4 colors for @xmath47j and @xmath47h = 0 are @xmath30.77 and @xmath30.12 mag , respectively , roughly the color of a k2iii star .",
    "there are minor ( @xmath30.03 mag ) differences in these colors between the two sides , but are well within the dispersions of the data .    to approximate the effect of star formation on these @xmath47 metrics we also compute how the colors would change if the excess midplane light between the two sides of ngc  891 is due to a hot star .",
    "we find that the @xmath47j-@xmath4 index is well fit by an o - type star , while the trend for @xmath47h-@xmath4 vs. @xmath47h is underpredicted for any stellar type .",
    "a full investigation of this minor discrepancy is beyond the scope of this work , but the general trend is clear . rather than merely being overdensities of old stars , asymmetries in the radial major - axis profile of ngc  891 are being caused by the addition of young stellar populations to the underlying stellar density . in some cases",
    "these asymmetries are likely due to individual regions of enhanced star - formation , but the broad nature of several features are at much larger scales than would be expected for localized star - forming regions . for instance , the surface brightness is relatively constant on the ne side of ngc  891 between 3 and 6 kpc , while the aforementioned sw ` trough ' is @xmath32 kpc wide .",
    "the simplest explanation for these features is that we are viewing projected spiral structure , which ngc  891 is believed to possess @xcite .    to verify the validity of our dust correction we compare irac 3.6 and 4.5@xmath8 m major axis profiles to the dust - corrected @xmath4 profile in the middle and right panels of figure [ fig : radialsbdustcompare ] .",
    "the irac data in general shows the same non - axisymmetric features as the dust - corrected @xmath4-band profile , with a few local exceptions ( e.g. at @xmath33 and @xmath35.5 kpc on the sw side ) .",
    "the irac profiles are also globally fainter by up to 0.5 mag arcsec@xmath39 , whereas for starlight the unattenuated @xmath4 - 3.6/4.5@xmath8 color should be zero ( in our vega photometric system ) due to all filters being in the rayleigh - jeans regime .",
    "these discrepancies are _ entirely _ due to dust attenuation in the 3.6 and 4.5@xmath8 m bands : we computed dust corrections for these filters in the same way as for the nir , which when applied to the irac major axis profiles produces profiles virtually identical to the @xmath4-band data ( figure [ fig : radialsbdustcompare_iraccorr ] ) .",
    "a series of @xmath4-band vertical profiles as several radii are shown in figure [ fig : vanderkruitplot ] .",
    "gray points show the profiles including the effects of dust , while black points have been attenuation corrected .",
    "the midplane attenuation is roughly constant at @xmath31.5 mag arcsec@xmath39 out to r = 8.5 kpc .",
    "the amount of attenuation quickly decreases with z , however , and by z@xmath30.5 kpc the effects of dust on the @xmath4-band vertical profiles are almost negligible . at r@xmath39 kpc",
    "there is a truncation in the central sb of the dust corrected profiles but not of the uncorrected ones .",
    "this scenario can only result from a cutoff in _ both _ the light near the midplane as well as the dust attenuation .",
    "this feature illustrates the importance of properly accounting for dust attenuation , as the uncorrected profile appears to be smoothly decaying across this threshold .",
    "the intensity distribution of an edge - on spiral with a radially exponential disk luminosity density distribution at all heights can be described , in the absence of attenuation , by the analytic function @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the central flux , @xmath50 is the modified bessel function of the first order , and @xmath51 is a function governing the vertical light distribution @xcite .    a simple analytic description of the vertical density profile of a spiral galaxy has been proposed by @xcite to be of the form : @xmath52 where @xmath53 varies between 1 and @xmath54 .",
    "the limiting behavior of this formula produces a sech@xmath55 distribution @xmath56 when @xmath53=1 and the exponential distribution @xmath57 when @xmath53 = @xmath54 . for convenience",
    "we include the factor of 4 in the sech@xmath5 profile with @xmath49 and use @xmath58 instead .",
    "the first attempts to fit the detailed vertical surface - brightness profiles of edge - on spirals began by treating the disk as a locally isothermal self - gravitating sheet @xcite , which results naturally in the sech@xmath55 model @xcite . as a result",
    "this model is generally referred to as the ` isothermal ' distribution .",
    "note , however , that this strict physical connection is lost when considering multiple disks , rotating disks with radial gradients , and/or disks embedded in a dark matter halo . nonetheless , the sech@xmath5 profile is not a bad descriptor of many observed disk vertical light profiles .",
    "more recent work has found that a steeper profile appears to fit some data better  usually an exponential profile @xcite , although sometimes the intermediate @xmath59 ` sech ' profile is employed @xcite .",
    "a theoretical framework which produces vertical surface - brightness distribution much closer to that of an exponential from physical conditions in spiral galaxies ( by considering the gas in addition to the stars ) has been developed partly in direct response to these experimental findings @xcite .",
    "@xcite also find that the vertical density profiles for dynamically consistent models of multiple self - gravitating disks are steeper than a sech@xmath5 function .",
    "discussed further in section [ sec : expvssech2 ] , their models are well characterized by the intermediate sech vertical profile .    in general",
    ", however , there is currently no concrete consensus for which type of profile ( or superposition of profiles ) better represents the underlying distribution of stars , due largely to the fact that both the exponential and sech@xmath5 profiles have significant deviations from each other only at small heights , exactly the place where dust obscuration is most prevalent . in this work , since we are able to accurately remove the deleterious effects of dust on the data , we will use both exponential and sech@xmath5 profiles in our vertical fits and see if we are able to distinguish one as clearly better in a statistical sense .",
    "additionally , since ngc  891 s thin and thick disks are well known ( e.g. @xcite ) and there is a clear super - exponentiality in the dust corrected profiles near the midplane in figures [ fig : correctioncompare ] , [ fig : imagecompare ] , and [ fig : vanderkruitplot ] , we expect our fits to require three separate vertical components in order to constrain the data at all z.      normally , observational studies of edge - on spirals have not required a detailed treatment of the effects of seeing on the observed profiles .",
    "this is a result of the combination of large pixel - sizes on detectors and the censoring of regions near the midplane to avoid dust effects ( e.g. @xcite;@xcite ) .",
    "however , in this work the seeing correction is of significant importance , especially in distinguishing between sech@xmath5 and exponential fits , where the seeing serves to smooth out the exponential profile and make it appear more like a sech@xmath5 .",
    "we make the simplifying assumption that the seeing profile can be approximated by a 2d gaussian point - spread - function , as in @xcite .",
    "then , the convolution is @xmath60 where @xmath32 is the fwhm of the seeing . since all the profiles we are considering here are of the form of equation [ eq : sbdistro ] we can perform the convolution separately in @xmath61 and @xmath62 : @xmath63 for both exponential and sech@xmath5 profiles we used the ` convolve ' function in the numpy python library .",
    "for every value to be convolved the surface - brightness profile was sampled with a spacing of 0.1 times the seeing ( fwhm = 09 ) over a range of values equal to six times the seeing in either direction .",
    "the gaussian kernel was sampled at the same spacing between -3 and + 3 times the seeing .",
    "this scheme ensured that the convolution did not miss any significant amounts of flux due to edge effects from either the convolution kernel or the function , while minimizing the computation time required to perform the integral .",
    "when the relevant scale - length or -height is much larger than the seeing , the effect of the convolution on the original profile is negligible .",
    "this is especially true at large distances from the center of the profile . since the radial scale - length is much larger than the seeing we use the unconvolved radial intensity profile in our fitting analyses to minimize computation time .      with the surface - brightness profiles corrected for the attenuation and convolutions for seeing in place",
    ", we now fit the intrinsic distribution of starlight . while one - dimensional fits have been successfully employed to compare single - component surface - brightness models to data , @xcite make a compelling argument , based on degeneracies between free parameters , for the necessity of fully 2d fits when multiple stellar distributions overlap .",
    "we therefore opt to model our data exclusively with image - based fits .",
    "we choose to model the @xmath4-band , as it is where both the dust correction and stellar population - mismatch errors will be smallest ( due to the decreasing attenuation with increasing wavelength and all stellar fluxes being on the rayleigh - jeans tail ) .",
    "before performing our fits , however , we first mask the image based on several criteria .",
    "all pixels with flux from foreground or background contaminants are masked , as well as pixels with errors @xmath9 1 mag ( while large - error pixels can still contribute to a @xmath64 fit in aggregate , gains from leaving these pixels in will be minimal and removing them allows for computational speedup in the fitting process ) .",
    "contaminant masking was done by hand and whenever possible we choose to be conservative .",
    "we also mask out all pixels with @xmath65 kpc to remove any pixels dominated by `` bulge '' light .",
    "we refer to the bulge light in quotations because , as we shall see in section [ sec : fitcentral ] , the central light distribution is complex and likely non - axisymmetric . for exactly these reasons we wish to focus first on the outer ( in radius ) disks .",
    "we use the python lmfit extension to the levenberg - marquardt nonlinear least - squares minimization routine in scipy.optimize.leastsq ( which is itself based on the minpack-1 library ) .",
    "although we report surface - brightness values in mag arcsec@xmath39 , all fitting is performed on flux values to preserve error estimates .",
    "to avoid false minima , we ran the fit 100 times for 1- and 2-component models and 200 times for 3-component models .",
    "the initial guesses of all free parameters for each run were chosen randomly within upper and lower limits based on what we considered to be reasonable ranges for spiral galaxies ( table [ tab:2dfit_newdust ] ) .",
    "the model with the lowest @xmath64 was selected and used as the input guess to 100 bootstrapping iterations , finding , as @xcite did , that standard error estimates from the nonlinear fit were often too small .",
    "note that only random uncertainties are shown in table [ tab:2dfit_newdust ] ; the @xmath358% systematic error on the central surface brightnesses from input stellar sed mismatch ( section [ sec : multidust ] ) is not shown .",

    "the 3-component exponential and sech@xmath5 fits are virtually indistinguishable from each other , both in a visual and statistical sense , and both are clearly able to fit the vertical profile at all heights .",
    "a representative plot of vertical surface brightness fits with the contributions of the individual disks is shown in figure [ fig : fitdecomp ] .",
    "first , the visual improvement resulting from adding the third component is clearly noticeable , especially at heights above @xmath30.75 kpc . additionally , while the total surface - brightness profiles of the 3-component exponential and sech@xmath5 fits are very similar , there are noticeable differences in the form of the individual components .",
    "these differences are largest in the relative @xmath81 between the exponentials and the sech@xmath5s , mostly to compensate for the flatter central profile of the sech@xmath5 profiles .",
    "even with the 3-component models , we find reduced @xmath84 .",
    "this could be due to an underestimation of our errors , most likely in the attenuation correction .",
    "however , given the relative simplicity of our model compared to the complex nature of a galactic system ( e.g. the model is perfectly axisymmetric ) , the fact that we do not recover a reduced @xmath85 is not surprising .",
    "our 2d fits do not take into account the potential effect of warps , star - forming regions , spiral arms , or any other non - axisymmetric structure . despite these limitations ,",
    "however , the reduced @xmath64 is still effective at distinguishing between the relative goodness - of - fit of models , as shown by the improvement from 1-component fits to 3-component fits both in reduced @xmath64 and upon visual inspection .      to investigate the impact of non - axisymmetric structures on our model fits to ngc  891",
    ", we constructed model - ( dust - corrected ) data residual surface - brightness images for both 3-component models ( top two panels of figure [ fig : modelresid ] ) .",
    "these images have been masked ( bad values set to zero ) in the same way as for the 2d fitting ( except for the inner 3 kpc , the boundaries of which are marked by dashed lines but not masked out ) , and smoothed by a @xmath32=27 gaussian to bring out larger - scale detail .",
    "additionally , the @xmath4-band bulge determined by @xcite has been added to the model image before producing the residual .",
    "white contours show the boundaries of regions with errors @xmath100.2 and @xmath100.5 mag pixel@xmath86 ( unsmoothed )  while we fit all points with errors @xmath101 mag pixel@xmath86 , we weight each pixel by its error and as a result the fit is most sensitive to pixels with small uncertainties",
    ". therefore we focus our analysis of the quality of the fit on the regions of the image with smaller uncertainties .",
    "several asymmetries are clearly present in figure [ fig : modelresid ] . based on a visual inspection of the data before resampling ,",
    "at least three of them ( labeled in figure [ fig : modelresid ] and also shown in figures [ fig : jhkimage ] and [ fig : imagecompare ] ) are likely to be regions of enhanced local star formation in ngc  891 .",
    "@xcite find a mild hi warp in ngc  891 ( position angle = 1.5@xmath25 ) .",
    "there are some slight indications of this warp in the data , chiefly in the excess of light over the model above the midplane at radii larger than region ` c ' on the sw side . on extremely close inspection of the non - dust - corrected mosaics",
    "( see figure [ fig : jhkimage ] , although it is difficult to distinguish in that image stretch ) it is also possible to discern a similar offset in the dust , but due to the clumpiness of the dust and the faintness of this feature we are unable to make a stronger claim about whether or not it is real .      beyond the specific asymmetries called out above ,",
    "it is clear that these models do a poor job of fitting ngc  891 s @xmath4-band light within 3 kpc .",
    "in addition to the large amount of light above and below the midplane from the galaxy s bar that is not reproduced in our model there is also clearly excess light in ngc  891 s nucleus  even with the addition of the @xcite bulge to the model .",
    "in contrast , just outside of the nucleus the model greatly overpredicts the flux near the midplane .",
    "the simplest explanation for this feature is that at r@xmath33 kpc there is a transition between disk and bar dominated regions , such that the 3-component disk is truncated within this radius and the bar does not extend beyond this radius .",
    "there is ample evidence for such truncations in other galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "to the extent that bars arise from dynamical instabilities in the inner disk , then this is not a truncation _ per se _ , but a redistribution of the disk from an axisymmetric , dynamically cold stellar mass distribution to a dynamically hotter distribution with more structure .",
    "this transition is more apparent as a function of radius in vertical profiles ( figure [ fig : modelvertprofs ] ) .",
    "while the 3-component model well fits the data outside of 3 kpc , the data clearly has a dearth of flux inside of 3 kpc right up until the very central regions of the galaxy . at small radii",
    ", however , there is a clear excess of flux at larger heights .",
    "we suggest this excess is due to a bar because previous studies have found evidence for such a feature in ngc  891 ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "further , there are clearly kinks in the vertical light profile ( most evident at r=1.5 and z=0.8 kpc ) caused by the ` x ' shape of the projected bar @xcite .",
    "other than these small kinks , however , the bar appears to be very close to having a pure exponential vertical light distribution .",
    "understanding the galaxy s behavior near the center is critical to estimating the total luminosity of each disk component and to fully characterize their radial distribution .",
    "therefore we perform a second set of 2d fits on the data attenuation - corrected by model b. while using the same basic scheme as in section [ sec:2dfitting ] , this time we leave the central region of ngc  891 unblanked .",
    "this necessitates several new model parameters .",
    "we approximate the bar in edge - on projection as an outer - truncated disk .",
    "this appears to be a good approximation to the light distribution of the bar seen edge - on , and the functional form of a truncated disk simplifies our fitting procedure .",
    "our bar model therefore has three free parameters : a central sb ( @xmath87 ) , scale - length ( @xmath88 ) , and scale - height ( @xmath89 ) .    since there is an excess of light at small r and z that appears morphologically disconnected from the bar emission ( see the top two panels of figure [ fig : modelresid ] ) , it is necessary to introduce an additional component .",
    "we first attempted to fit a classical @xmath90-law bulge to ngc  891 , but found that this form made for extremely poor fits .",
    "we found instead that the central component of ngc  891 was well - fit by a nuclear disk with the same scale - height as the super - thin disk .",
    "we therefore fixed the scale - height of this component @xmath91 and allowed the central sb @xmath92 and scale - length @xmath93 to vary .    finally , we add a truncation radius @xmath94 , which functions as an inner cutoff for all three main disks and an outer cutoff for the bar and nuclear disk . for simplicity",
    "this truncation is abrupt : at all points inside ( outside ) of @xmath94 the main disks ( bar and nuclear disk ) have zero flux . in reality",
    "there will be a transition length instead of a discontinuous truncation , but we do not find that the data warrants this complication in the model .",
    "the scale - heights of the three main disks should be well determined by our original fitting scheme , and tests indicated that there were minimal changes in central sbs and scale - lengths of the thin and thick disks when the central region of ngc  891 was uncensored .",
    "therefore we fixed the parameters of the thin and thick components at their best - fitting values in table [ tab:2dfit_newdust ] , but we allowed @xmath95 and @xmath96 to vary .",

    "the outstanding residuals that remain are associated with the ` x ' shape pattern attributed to the bar .",
    "it would be very useful to have a simple analytic parameterization of this light distribution , but we are not aware of one in the literature . while still not perfect , adding a disk truncation , a simple representation for the bar , and a nuclear disk dramatically improves our ability to fit the inner portion of ngc  891 .",
    "the central sb and scale - length of the super - thin disk change minimally from the original fits .",
    "the bar has a scale - height @xmath31.5 times that of the thin disk , but substantially smaller than the thick disk , which agrees with a visual inspection of our images .",
    "the reduced @xmath64 of this fit is somewhat larger than for the fits with only the three disk components ; this is due to the unmodeled ` x ' shape bar pattern .",

    "the decrease in scale - height in the nir may be due to the decreased role of dust attenuation .",
    "if vertical profiles are fit to data that hasnt been corrected for attenuation the dust will function to artificially increase the inferred scale - heights . alternatively , if vertical profile fits are restricted to sufficiently large z to avoid dust , then the fit is biased toward the light distribution of the thick(er ) disk components .",
    "supporting this hypothesis is the fact that @xcite find an optical scale - height of @xmath30.4 kpc from their rt models , closer to their nir scale - heights than the @xmath30.5 kpc found in @xcite and @xcite .    for our single component exponential fits ( the most directly comparable fits to most of the above - mentioned literature ) we obtain slightly smaller scale parameters ( 82% smaller scale - height , 92% smaller scale - length ) than @xcite .",
    "our increased resolution , combined with the fact that the super - thin part of the vertical light distribution is at high s / n , are the likely reasons for the decrease in scale - height of our single component fits .",
    "the scale - length of the model with the sech@xmath5 vertical profile is very similar to the fit using the exponential distribution .",
    "this is unsurprising since regardless of the functional form of the scale - height we use exponentials for the scale - length .",
    "the scale - height of the sech@xmath5 model , however , is only 68% of the exponential scale - height .",
    "indeed , a comparison between the exponential and sech@xmath5 scale - heights for all our models shows that the sech@xmath5 scale - height is always somewhat smaller than the exponential scale - height . as noted above",
    ", this discrepancy arises naturally from the shallower nature of the sech@xmath5 profile near the midplane , which forces smaller scale - heights to be used to reproduce the steeper features near the midplane .    for our multiple component",
    "fits , the thin disk is most closely approximated by the second disk component , so we will refer to it as the ` thin disk component ' . in our 2-component",
    "fits , the thin disk component has ( except for the sech@xmath5 scale - height ) larger scale parameter values than the xilouris k - band fits .",
    "this discrepancy seems likely to be due to the need for the thin disk component to fit light from both the thin disk as well as the thick disk ( due to the depth of our observations ) , while the light nearest to the midplane is fit well by the inner disk component .",
    "corroborating evidence for this hypothesis comes from the 3-component fits , which have thin disk component scale parameters very close to the k - band values reported by @xcite .",
    "in addition to the changing scale - heights for each disk of our 3-component models , we also see a positive correlation in the scale - lengths of the components .",
    "the scale - length of the super - thin disk for both the exponential and sech@xmath5 fit is @xmath350% of the scale - length of the thin disk , while the thin disk scale - length is only @xmath380% of the size of the thick disk .",
    "the scale - heights , however , still change more rapidly than the scale - lengths . defining @xmath112 , @xmath113 .    of special interest in our 2- and 3-component models",
    "is the need for a disk with a scale height even smaller than that of the thin disk component of ngc  891 .",
    "this component , which we term the ` super - thin disk component , ' is usually hidden from view by the dust lane as it has a scale - height of around 60 - 80 pc ( perhaps slightly higher , based on the results of the 2-component fits ) .",
    "even prior studies which attempted dust correction / modeling could not be expected to reveal this disk in the nir as it is very close to even our own resolution limit ( @xmath340 pc ) , and certainly would be unresolved in the data used by e.g. @xcite .",
    "we note , however , that @xcite do require a super - thin disk to fit excess light in their _ optical _ bandpasses ( which have better resolution ) , with @xmath83=0.15 kpc but an infinite scale - length with an arbitrary cutoff . with our data we are able to fit a non - infinite scale length , which we find to be @xmath32 kpc ( again , slightly higher in the 2-component fits ) .",
    "this is roughly half the size of the scale - lengths of the thin and thick disk components , indicating that the stars in the super - thin disk are very centrally concentrated compared to the stars in the other disks .",
    "a likely conjecture is that the super - thin disk in ngc  891 corresponds to the young star - forming disk seen in the mw .",
    "the average scale - heights given by @xcite for young ( @xmath390 pc ) and old ( @xmath3325 pc ) stars in the mw correlate well with the best - fitting parameters for ngc  891 s super - thin and thin disk components . before now",
    "this disk has never been observed as a discrete vertical component in a galaxy similar to the mw due to dust obscuration .",
    "however the presence of a super - thin star - forming disk has been inferred from the inability of rt models to reproduce the fir sed of edge - on galaxies based only on known thin and thick disk parameters @xcite . in these models ,",
    "the scale - height of such a disk is generally assumed to either be similar to that of the mw ( e.g. @xcite ) or the same as the dust ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "our unambiguous determination of the super - thin disk scale - height removes the need to make such assumptions .",
    "our finding that the super - thin disk scale - length is significantly smaller than the thin or thick disk scale - length is also important since previous studies have incorrectly assumed the super - thin disk has the same scale-_length _ as the thin disk .      for our single component fits ( as well as for the thin disk component of our 3-component exponential fits ) we compute comparable scale - lengths and scale - heights but @xmath31 mag arcsec@xmath39 brighter central surface brightnesses than found by @xcite .",
    "this result implies that our single component models predict @xmath350% higher total @xmath4-band luminosities for ngc  891 .",
    "our images do go deeper than those of @xcite , which would boost the luminosity of our model .",
    "our attenuation correction , which takes into account the effects of clumpy dust , may also contribute to this discrepancy .",
    "we note that our total luminosities are in much better agreement with more recent works ( e.g. @xcite ) , which will be discussed in more detail later in this section .    for exponential and sech@xmath5 disks",
    "the total flux can be computed by integrating over r and z. including the effect of an inner disk truncation gives @xmath114 for the super - thin , thin , and thick disks , where @xmath94 is the truncation radius and @xmath115 is the flux zero - point . in this work",
    "we use the 2mass value of 667 jy for the @xmath4-band zero - point @xcite .",
    "the equations for the total flux of the bar and nuclear disk are similar : @xmath116 we show the total luminosities of each component for both 3-component models as well as the model which adds a bar and nuclear disk ( the ` truncated ' model ) in tables [ tab:2dfit_newdust ] and [ tab : bulgefits ] .    for the truncated model",
    "we find that the bar contributes roughly the same total luminosity as the thick disk , despite being confined to the central regions of ngc  891 .",
    "the nuclear disk is by far the faintest , with a total luminosity only 40% of the second least - luminous component ( the thick disk ) .",
    "the total @xmath4-band luminosity of the truncated model is slightly ( @xmath35% ) smaller than the 3-component model .",
    "the fact that the @xmath4-band light lost by truncating the disks of the 3-component model is almost entirely made up for by the light from the bar and nuclear disk is tantalizing evidence that disk instabilities have merely rearranged the orbits of existing stars in ngc  891 s inner regions ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the super - thin disk has a total @xmath4-band luminosity of @xmath117 ( @xmath118 ) @xmath119 for the exponential ( sech@xmath5 ) three disk model .",
    "the truncated super - thin disk has a total luminosity @xmath362% of its non - truncated counterpart .",
    "assuming the nuclear disk is an inner continuation of the super - thin disk and adding its luminosity to that of the truncated super - thin disk increases this ratio to @xmath374% . assuming that the ` young ' stellar populations used as inputs to rt models correspond exactly to our super - thin disk , the truncated disk luminosity is about an order of magnitude larger than @xmath120 @xmath119 , the value assumed by @xcite for modeling the integrated sed of ngc  891 , and roughly 4 times larger than assumed for our rt modeling .",
    "we again note that due to the nature of our attenuation correction model b tends to have more luminous central surface - brightnesses , but even the truncated total super - thin disk luminosity of the model a fits are still @xmath382 times as large than the luminosity used in @xcite .",
    "these discrepancies are all significantly larger than either our random or systematic errors , which are of order @xmath310% .",
    "however , when the _ total _ flux ( bulge , young disk , and old disk ) from the model used by @xcite is compared to the total flux of our truncated model , they agree to within 10% .",
    "it therefore seems likely that the input seds used by @xcite need to be adjusted , with the young stellar sed getting boosted in the nir at the expense of flux from the old stellar sed . adjusting the bolometric luminosities of the two components",
    "will not solve this problem  boosting the luminosity of the young component at all wavelengths will cause an over - prediction of the uv flux ( or an over - prediction of the fir light if the extra uv emission is suppressed by dust ) .",
    "it is plausible that @xcite s young stellar sed underestimates the impact of cool , evolved stars , especially thermally - pulsating asymptotic giant branch stars which are known to be difficult to model and are very bright in the nir @xcite .",
    "if this is the case it would explain why @xcite are able to fit the uv and fir flux of ngc  891 while under - predicting the nir flux of the young stellar disk component of the galaxy .",
    "depending on the spectral type of these cool stars the peak of the old component s sed will shift , but it is not possible with our current data to predict exactly how these input seds will change .    @xcite report a b - band thin disk integrated luminosity of 6.7@xmath110 @xmath121 , which ( even though it s in the optical ) should be minimally affected by dust because it is computed away from the midplane of ngc  891 . using our fitted thin - disk @xmath4-band integrated luminosity",
    ", the thin disk has a b-@xmath4 color of @xmath34.5 mag ( vega ) , similar to a k4iii @xcite star .",
    "using the values from what @xcite call the old disk , which is most similar to our thin disk , gives a b-@xmath4 color of @xmath35.2 mag , close to a k5iii or m0iii .",
    "based on a galactic evolution model @xcite find i - k colors for the thin disks of edge - on galaxies to be @xmath31.2 mag , similar to the colors of a k3iii star .",
    "while these models were not designed specifically for ngc  891 , they are another indication that the nir luminosity in @xcite needs to be redistributed between the young and old stars .        as mentioned in section [ sec : profiles ] , the functional form of the vertical light distribution has been much debated , with different authors favoring different indices of @xmath53 in equation [ eq : vertprof ] . due to dust obscuration near the midplane , shallow image depth , or both ,",
    "most of the prior studies have only been able to accurately constrain fits with one ( or at most two , when the data are deep enough to probe the thick disk ) disk component(s )",
    ". however , our data provides constraints for three disks , and while our 1- and 2-component exponential models produce smaller reduced @xmath64 than the equivalent sech@xmath5 model , our 3-component model results in sech@xmath5 and exponential fits that are nearly indistinguishable from each other .",
    "this similarity is also seen in the inferred total luminosity ( @xmath122 ) of the exponential model and the sech@xmath5 model , where @xmath123 , @xmath124 , and @xmath125 are the super - thin , thin and thick components respectively . despite differences in individual component parameters @xmath126 .",
    "the same ratio for the 1- and 2-component models is @xmath31.15 and @xmath31.06 , respectively .",
    "these result indicates ( i ) that the presence of multiple disk components must be considered when fitting the vertical light distribution ; and ( ii ) a distinction between sech@xmath5 and exponential fitting functions can not be made in this context because when adequate components are introduced to fit the observed light distribution , the different functions are indistinguishable .    due to the difficulty of statistically distinguishing between different empirical forms of the vertical surface brightness distribution",
    ", it could be argued that physically motivating a vertical profile from equations of dynamical equilibrium would lead to more accurate results .",
    "@xcite take this approach in their vertical surface brightness profile fitting , and find theoretical values that seem to more closely resemble sech function , intermediate in concentration at small z between exponential or sech@xmath5 functions . to test the sech distribution we performed a 2d partially fixed 3-component disk parameter fit to our @xmath4-band data ( corrected with rt model b ) using this distribution .",
    "we find that all fitted free parameter values for the sech distribution fall between the fitted values from the equivalent model using the exponential and sech@xmath5 distributions ( see the 12th and 14th columns of table [ tab:2dfit_newdust ] ) , with a reduced @xmath64 only 0.01 better than the corresponding sech@xmath5 fit .",
    "this result indicates that it is not necessary to compute dynamically consistent profiles in order to parameterize the light distribution of galaxy disks : empirical functions can be used with the same accuracy provided there are adequate components .",
    "it still might be argued , however , that dynamically self - consistent vertical profile functions would enable a more physical interpretation of the derived parameters characterizing the light profile . on the other hand , in light of @xcite s argument that disk components are likely continuous , extant dynamical analysis assuming discrete components may be misleading .",
    "nonetheless , the observed vertical light profiles do appear to have clear breaks at 0.2 and 1.1 kpc , and this makes it reasonable to consider discrete components .",
    "as such , it is important to understand the systematics attributable to different choices for the vertical fitting function .",
    "we find that for all of our models ( 1 , 2 , and 3-component ) the cuspier exponential vertical profiles yield larger scale - heights relative to sech@xmath55 vertical profiles . although both models adopt a radially exponential light distribution , models with exponential _",
    "profiles yield smaller _ radial _ scale - lengths .",
    "combined , the disk oblateness changes by roughly a factor of 1.5 between models with vertical light profiles that are exponential or sech@xmath55 , with disk models becoming apparently thinner for sech@xmath55 vertical profiles .",
    "again , this holds for all components in 1 , 2 , and 3-component models .    in the 3-component model",
    "the disk oblateness also changes more rapidly between thin and thick components ( a factor of @xmath35 ) compared to the oblateness change between super - thin and thin components ( a factor of @xmath32 ) .",
    "these different oblateness changes are driven mostly by changes in the radial scale - length , which increases by almost a factor of 2 between super - thin and thin components , but only by @xmath320% between thin and thick components .",
    "in contrast the scale - height ratio for thin to super - thin components is @xmath127 for the exponential ( sech@xmath5 ) fits while for thick to thin components the ratio is @xmath128 for the exponential ( sech@xmath5 ) fits .",
    "not surprisingly for our 2-component models the scale - height ratio for the two components is intermediate between the results for thin - to - superthin and thick - to - thin ratios .",
    "the scale - height ratios for ngc  891 think - to - thin components are comparable to those found by @xcite , based on thin - thick disk decompositions of edge - on spirals in the s@xmath129 g survey , for morphological type t = 3 ( hyperleda indicates ngc  891 has t = 3.1@xmath20.4 ) .",
    "the good agreement of our results for thin and thick disk thickness ratios to those of @xcite , who only fit two disks to their data , indicates either that the presence of unaccounted - for flux from super - thin disks does not significantly bias their results for the ratios of scale - heights of thin and thick components or that most of their sample is without super - thin disk components .",
    "changes in relative component luminosities are more subtle . for the ease of the following disucssion we tabulate the component luminosities of the exponential and sech@xmath5 fits with three disk components in table [ tab : totlum ] . for 3-component models ,",
    "regardless of the functional forms of the vertical light profile and whether there is a truncation , the thin component contributes the most to the total disk luminosity , followed by the super - thin component , and last the thick component .",
    "( in the 2-component model it is also the case that the second component , most closely identified with the thin disk , also contributes the most light . )",
    "if we take the difference between the exponential and sech@xmath55 values as characteristic of the systematic errors then we find the three disk components , thin , super - thin and thick , contribute 51@xmath24% , 34@xmath24% , 15@xmath21% , respectively .",
    "the systematic error in the thick - disk component luminosity is likely underestimated because this component was fixed in scale - height and scale - length .",
    "the most striking change in relative luminosities occurs between superthin and thin disks in our three - component fits to ngc  891 , with the exponential model having @xmath130 compared to @xmath131 for the sech@xmath5 model .",
    "this comes about despite the scale - height and scale - length ratios between superthin and thin components being the same for both exponential and sech@xmath55 models .",
    "what drives the difference in component luminosity is a change in relative surface - brightness .",
    "in contrast to the superthin - to - thin luminosity ratio , the luminosity ratios of thick - to - thin components is @xmath132 , i.e. , essentially unchanged for exponential , sech@xmath5 or the truncated sech@xmath5 models .",
    "the relatively constancy of thick - to - thin luminosities is interesting given that @xcite report a systematic variation in @xmath133 when using different functional forms of the vertical surface brightness profile , which they argue arises as a result of how rounded ( or concentrated ) the model light profiles are near the midplane . specifically , they find thick - to - thin component luminosity ratios 60% larger than @xcite .",
    "the latter adopt a sech@xmath55 vertical profile , less concentrated than that adopted by @xcite , which is closer to a sech function .",
    "the fact that we obtain similar @xmath133 ratios for both our fitting functions might indicate that the addition of a super - thin disk component removes this discrepancy .",
    "however , even for our 2-component disk fits , the luminosity ratios only vary by 4% , so something else must be going on .    as an exercise",
    ", we took the sech@xmath55 vertical profiles fit for @xcite s sample , and fit to the sum of these components two new 2-component models , one where both components have sech vertical light profiles , and the other where both components have exponential vertical light profiles .",
    "we found that the luminosity ratios for the sech vertical profiles were roughly 60% larger than those for the input model sech@xmath55 vertical profiles ( the exponential vertical profiles were 60% larger again relative to the ratios for the sech vertical profiles ) .",
    "this is the same factor found by @xcite .",
    "both our exercise here and @xcite s are one - dimensional fits",
    "( in z only ) .",
    "our conclusion is that the difference in thick - to - thin luminosity ratios is an artifact of one - dimensional fitting which is largely eliminated when two - dimensional light - profiles fits are performed .",
    "ccccccc @xmath134&@xmath117&29&@xmath118&38&@xmath135&25 + @xmath136&@xmath137&55&@xmath138&48&@xmath139&42 + @xmath140&@xmath141&16&@xmath142&14&@xmath143&13 + @xmath144&&&&&@xmath145&15 + @xmath146&&&&&@xmath147&5 + @xmath148&@xmath149&100&@xmath150&100&@xmath151&100 + [ tab : totlum ]      of value to our investigation would be corroborating evidence of a super - thin disk in ngc  891 in another dataset , ideally in the mir which has been claimed to be ideal for studies of starlight with minimal attenuation @xcite . towards that end",
    "we analyzed the archival irac 4.5@xmath8 m data looking for a super - thin component consistent with our nir fits . while the irac data has resolution only half that of the lowest resolution of our whirc data , we note that our @xmath4-band fits indicate that ngc  891 s super - thin disk has a central surface brightness @xmath31.5 - 2 mag arcsec@xmath39 brighter than its thin disk , and @xmath34 mag arcsec@xmath39 brighter than its thick disk . at 4 kpc in radius and at the approximate resolution of the irac data in height ( 1.8\"@xmath380 pc ) , the super - thin disk surface brightness should be comparable to the fitted thin disk surface brightness ( @xmath30.2 mag fainter for the exponential fit , and @xmath30.9 mag brighter for the sech@xmath5 fit , assuming no color gradients between @xmath4 and 4.5@xmath8 m ) .",
    "therefore it is not unreasonable to expect to see at least some evidence of the super - thin disk in the irac data , even though it may never be the dominant component in the ranges we can probe .",
    "we computed 2d fits to the irac 4.5@xmath8 m data , using the same methodology as our fits of the @xmath4-band whirc data , with a 3-component disk model .",
    "the exponential disk model had difficulty converging on a physically plausible fit , due to degeneracies introduced by the lowered resolution .",
    "the sech@xmath5 model , however , produced a good fit ( table [ tab:2dfit_irac ] and figure [ fig:1dirac ] ) with parameters very similar to that for the @xmath4-band data .",
    "the scale - heights of the super - thin and thin disk in the fits to the 4.5@xmath8 m data are identical to the @xmath4-band values .    in hindsight",
    "it is perhaps unsurprising that we were able to identify ngc  891 s super - thin disk at 4.5@xmath8 m : @xcite set out to decompose the galaxies in the s@xmath129 g sample into thin and thick disk components , but several ( e.g. ic 2058 , ngc  1495 , and ngc  5470 ) have fits that are closer to what would be expected for a super - thin+thin disk .",
    "this suggests not only that the irac bands are capable of identifying super - thin disks in ( very ) nearby galaxies , but that such disks may be common in the local universe .",
    "attempting a 3-component decomposition of these s@xmath129 g galaxies would be a logical next step in determining if they are truly super - thin+thin+thick disk systems .",
    "indeed , @xcite perform a 3-component ( 1d ) analysis on s@xmath129 g data of ngc  4013 , and find a system that appears to have a mw - like super - thin disk but extended ( in height ) thin and thick disks .",
    "@xcite do not identify the narrowest disk as a super - thin disk but rather term the components thin , thick , and ` extended ' ; this difference is semantic until there is a clear astrophysical distinction between the components ( e.g. age ) .",
    "although the lower - resolution irac data appears good enough to identify super - thin disks in at least some nearby edge - on galaxies there are still several advantages to our methodology .",
    "first and foremost is the increased resolution in the nir , which allows super - thin disks to be constrained at much larger distances .",
    "this is especially important for the study of mw - sized galaxies , which are relatively rare in the local universe .",
    "the increased resolution is helpful even in nearby galaxies : lower spatial resolution increases the likelihood of degeneracies in the fits , which is already known to be an important issue in performing edge - on disk decompositions @xcite .",
    "the primary motivation for undertaking vertical disk decompositions in the mir is the limited dust attenuation at those wavelengths and the availability of deep imaging data from _",
    "spitzer_. however , our radiative transfer models indicate there is as much as 0.5 mag of attenuation at 4.5@xmath8 m ( figures [ fig : radialsbdustcompare ] and [ fig : radialsbdustcompare_iraccorr ] ) .",
    "while most of the 4.5@xmath8 m light experiences very little attenuation given the concentration of dust near the midplane , a full , accurate accounting of the mir light will * still * require an attenuation correction .",
    "further , by using @xmath4-band data we ensure that we exclusively fit the light from the stellar disk(s ) and avoid contamination from dust , which @xcite find to be @xmath1525% of total integrated light and up to 20% of the light locally from star - forming regions in spiral galaxies .",
    "while mir dust emission does affect our attenuation correction in the @xmath4-band by skewing the @xmath4 - 4.5@xmath8 m color , this is a second - order effect  a correction to a correction in the @xmath4-band itself .",
    "the ability of our model to reproduce the data at a variety of radii and heights ( figure [ fig : cc45profiles ] ) indicates that it has been properly accounted for in our modeling .",
    "in contrast , dust emission is both a first and second order correction at 3.6 and 4.5@xmath8 m .",
    "cc @xmath66&13.97@xmath20.032 + @xmath67&2.39@xmath20.016 + @xmath68&0.06@xmath20.002 + @xmath71&15.21@xmath20.012 + @xmath72&3.50@xmath20.007 + @xmath73&0.25@xmath20.001 + @xmath76&18.26@xmath20.003 + @xmath77&4.80@xmath111 + @xmath79&1.44@xmath111 + [ tab:2dfit_irac ]    finally , there is additional value in making the attenuation correction in the nir as it opens up this important spectral region for future imaging and spectroscopic efforts .",
    "for instance , there are several molecular band - heads between 1 and 2.3@xmath8 m which may be able to separate different types of cold giant stars @xcite , allowing for age and composition gradients to be determined in the stellar disks .",
    "we have obtained sub - arcsecond resolution nir imaging of ngc  891 , a nearby massive spiral galaxy frequently compared to the milky way , using the whirc instrument on the wiyn telescope .",
    "these images cover roughly @xmath210.5 kpc in radius and all relevant regions for vertical disk decompositions .",
    "we reduced the data using our own pipeline , specifically designed for the reduction of images with very extended sources .",
    "we supplemented this data with archival _ spitzer _ irac 3.6 and 4.5@xmath8 m data , primarily to assist in computing an attenuation correction .",
    "concurrently , we produced a 3d monte carlo rt sed model of ngc  891 using parameters known to fit the uv - fir sed of the galaxy .",
    "a comparison of the ir colors predicted by the model with our whirc and irac data indicated that the balance of dust grain sizes was different near the midplane compared to at large heights .",
    "we therefore constructed a second model with a lowered pah fraction near the midplane , which provided better fits to the data at small heights while leaving the color distribution at large heights unchanged .",
    "both of these models were used to construct an attenuation correction based on the @xmath4 - 4.5 @xmath8 m color .",
    "the difference in the attenuation correction between the two models is small ( to first order the difference starts at 0 mag , increases at a rate of @xmath30.4 mag per mag of @xmath4-band attenuation up to @xmath33=1.5 mag , then increases at a much smaller rate of @xmath3 0.07 mag per magnitude of attenuation ) and does not significantly affect the following results .",
    "using a levenberg - marquardt nonlinear curve fitting routine , we fit 2d seeing - convolved surface - brightness profiles to the @xmath4-band data , using models with up to three disk components .",
    "the vertical light distributions of the disks were parameterized by either exponential or sech@xmath5 functions , while the radial distributions were assumed to be exponential .",
    "it is immediately clear that single disk component models provide poor fits to the data .",
    "two- and 3-component models do much better , and a close inspection of the vertical profiles shows that three components are necessary to fully model the light distribution .",
    "the 3-component model produces a _ thin _",
    "disk with scale - length ( @xmath82 ) @xmath34 kpc and scale - height ( @xmath83 ) @xmath30.27 kpc , and a _ super - thin _ disk with @xmath82 and @xmath83 of @xmath32.1 kpc and @xmath30.07 kpc respectively .",
    "the thin and super - thin disks are consistent with prior work on ngc  891 and the mw s young , star - forming disk ( albeit with a smaller scale - length ) . we find that as @xmath83 decreases from the thick to the super - thin disk the oblateness @xmath153 increases from @xmath33 to @xmath330 , even though @xmath82 is also decreasing . without data sensitive to star - formation rate we can not definitively state that ngc  891 s super - thin disk is star - forming like its putative milky way counterpart , but this does seem to be the most likely possibility , particularly given the evidence for embedded star - formation from the observed fir excess in this galaxy .",
    "while our 3-component models fit the data well outside of the central bulge region , near the center of ngc  891 this model produces significant residuals with respect to the data , overestimating the light near the midplane while underestimating light away from the midplane .",
    "these residuals are consistent with what would be expected from a bar .",
    "co observations have indicated that ngc  891 has a bar , and the presence of such a structure is clear from x - shaped isophotes visible in our data , which are characteristic of bar orbits .",
    "the simplest explanation consistent with the data is that ngc  891 s bar truncates the galaxy s main disk components and redistributes the stars into the bar structure .",
    "other than the relatively low surface - brightness x - shaped isophotes the bar appears to be well fit by a disk with a scale - length of @xmath31.3 kpc and a scale - height of @xmath30.4 kpc .",
    "we also find excess light at the very center of ngc  891 .",
    "this excess is well fit by a nuclear disk with the same scale - height as the super - thin disk , a scale - length of 0.25 kpc ( @xmath310% of the super - thin disk ) , and 20% of the super - thin disk s luminosity ; a classical r@xmath154-law bulge can not adequately fit this feature and in fact this type of spheroid does not appear to be present at all in ngc 891 .",
    "a truncation between the central components ( the nuclear disk and bar ) and the three main disks is also necessary to accurately model the entire @xmath4-band light distribution of ngc  891 .",
    "this truncation happens at roughly 3.1 kpc .",
    "new models with this nuclear disk , a rough approximation to the bar , and a disk / bar truncation are able to produce good fits to our data all the way down to the center of ngc  891 .",
    "we find that when three disk components are modeled , both exponential and sech@xmath5 vertical distribution functions fit the data equally well , even at our sub - arcsecond resolution . despite the apparent difference in individual fitted parameters between the sech@xmath5 and exponential 3-component disk model ( e.g. sech@xmath5 disks tend to have smaller scale - heights than exponential disks ) , we find that they predict nearly identical _ total _ @xmath4-band luminosities for ngc  891 ( models with fewer components predict slightly larger total luminosities for the exponential disks , on the order of @xmath310% ) . the sech@xmath5 disk model including the bar , nuclear disk , and disk / bar truncation has comparable total luminosity , @xmath395% as bright as the simpler 3-component disk model with no truncation . based on the truncated model we find that the super - thin component ( including the nuclear disk ) contributes roughly 30% of the total @xmath4-band luminosity in ngc  891 , while the thin disk , thick disk , and bar respectively contain @xmath342% , 13% , and 15% of the total",
    ". the luminosity and scale height ratios of ngc  891 s thin and thick disk agree with those found for other edge - on spirals in the s@xmath129 g study of comparable type and rotation speed , even though the s@xmath129 g analysis only fits two disks to their data .",
    "the @xmath4-band luminosity of ngc  891 s super - thin disk is a factor of 4 - 10 larger than what has been adopted in radiative transfer models capable of reproducing the uv - fir integrated sed of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "the _ total _",
    "disk luminosity is , however , very similar between these models and our results .",
    "the most likely explanation for this discrepancy is that some of the nir light that had been attributed to the thin+thick disks in these earlier models actually belongs to the super - thin component .",
    "prior to the present work ngc  891 s super - thin disk had never been directly detected , and although its uv luminosity could be inferred by using energy - balance arguments , there were no direct constraints on its luminosity in the nir or its spatial location . because the uv luminosity of the super - thin disk _ is _",
    "fairly well constrained , the additional nir light seen in our data can not be accounted for by uniformly increasing the intrinsic super - thin disk luminosity at all wavelengths .",
    "rather , the nir luminosity must be boosted without affecting the intrinsic super - thin disk sed in the uv , likely through an increased amount of cool evolved stars , such as rsgs and agbs .",
    "confirmation of this conjecture will be the topic of a future paper .    finally , we determine that there is also an excess of light near ngc  891 s midplane in irac 4.5@xmath8 m data , with scale height comparable to what we find for the super - thin disk in the nir .",
    "however , while useful for verifying the validity of our methodology , there are several reasons why irac data are non - ideal for identifying super - thin stellar disks . first , contemporary nir instruments yield much higher angular resolution than their mir counterparts ; nir detectors will be able to probe super - thin disks at larger distances from the mw . secondly , we have shown that the irac bands have up to @xmath30.5 mag of dust attenuation near the midplane on ngc  891 .",
    "therefore , any attempt to determine the intrinsic light profile from a spiral galaxy s disk at low heights will need to employ an attenuation correction like the one derived in this work , even in the mir . finally , both the irac 3.6 and 4.5@xmath8 m filters ( the ones most commonly used to measure stellar flux ) have non - negligible amounts of non - stellar emission from pah and hot dust particles .",
    "any attempt to compute the stellar flux at these wavelengths must therefore correct for this emission , which is known to be highly variable across individual galaxies . by combining our nir observations with existing mir data ,",
    "we are able to probe deeper than if we used each wavelength regime independently : we retain the spatial resolution and minimal susceptibility to contamination from dust emission of the nir , while producing excellent attenuation corrections using the combination of the nir and the mir colors .",

    "before ( and during ) the data reduction process we inspected the individual images for artifacts and defects . three images from both the sw and ne @xmath4-band pointings contained elevated signal levels over a large region near the left - middle of the detector and were removed from the reduction .",
    "additionally , during a few exposures of the central @xmath4-band and sw h - band the sky background appears to undergo a rapid change , faster than our sky - source duty cycle .",
    "we therefore also removed four sw h - band exposures and five central @xmath4-band exposures from the reduction pipeline .",
    "data reduction generally followed the procedures described in the whirc quick guide to data reduction manual , although we modified several steps to optimize the reduction for very extended targets like ngc  891 .",
    "we detail all reduction steps here for clarity , going into depth for the non - standard portions of our reduction .",
    "first , excess data on the images were trimmed off .",
    "then , images taken with fowler-4 sampling ( j - band ) were divided by four to remove the additive nature of the sampling .",
    "we then applied a linearity correction to all images with the iraf task irlincor using coefficients provided in the data reduction manual .",
    "the coordinate matrix of the image headers was then adjusted to take into account the rotation of the telescope during the observations .",
    "we took 20 dome flat exposures for each filter : 10 with the dome lamps on and 10 with the lamps off . the 10 lamp - on flat images",
    "were scaled to have the same mean flux in the central quarter of the images and then averaged together to produce a combined lamp - on flat ; this process was then repeated with the lamp - off flats .",
    "the combined lamp - off flat was then subtracted from the combined lamp - on flat to remove any signal not coming from the flat lamps ( e.g. dark current , scattered light , or thermal emission in the dome ) .    before reducing the flat - fields any further ,",
    "a first - order correction must be applied because whirc has a ` pupil ghost ' , likely due to internal reflections in the imager s optics .",
    "it appears in the central 80of the detector .",
    "this feature is most prominent in the @xmath4-band , with an amplitude about 15% of the background , but it is also present ( albeit at much lower levels ) in j and h as well . the ghost was modeled and removed from the flat - fields ( it is removed from the object frames naturally during the sky - subtraction process ) using the representative pupil template provided on the whirc web page and the iraf mscred.rmpupil task .",
    "while pupil templates can be constructed from j and @xmath4 flats , for our purposes the provided template was more than adequate , with errors @xmath100.3% on the corrected images .",
    "we note that the flats we used are from an earlier night in our run ( ut date 2011 oct 16 ) ; we found night - to - night deviations in the flat - fields of @xmath101% over the entire image area . all object and sky images",
    "were flattened before proceeding with further data processing .    finally , the central quarter of the pupil - ghost - removed flat was normalized to an average value of 1 .",
    "small and negative pixel values ( caused by bad pixels and later masked out ) were replaced by unity , to prevent erroneously large and/or negative flux values from appearing in the flat - fielded science images .      with extended sources like ngc  891 , sky subtraction can be very difficult . to combat this problem",
    ", we interleaved observations of a relatively empty sky field @xmath310away ( with similar dither amplitudes between sky images as for the data ) with our observations of ngc  891 . for each set of on - source dithers ( 4 for j and h , 9 for @xmath4 )",
    "we combine sky images taken before ( 2 for j and h , 5 for @xmath4 ) and after ( again , 2 for j and h and 5 for @xmath4 ) to produce a sky frame suitable for use on the data images .",
    "each sky frame was scaled to have the same median value to avoid biasing the statistics .",
    "the sky frames were then median combined iteratively pixel - by - pixel with 2@xmath32 clipping until the median converged or all the pixels in the individual sky frames had been clipped out .",
    "after all pixels have been median combined , we used an iterative relaxation algorithm ( described in appendix [ sec : relaxation ] ) to interpolate sky values for sky image pixels where all the constituent pixels were clipped out .",
    "the relaxation procedure provides accurate interpolation and converges very quickly when the pixels needing interpolation are relatively few and widely spaced ; we deliberately chose to obtain dedicated sky images and ensured that dither amplitudes were larger than the stellar point - source - functions ( psfs ) in order to make this process as efficient and accurate as possible .",
    "for a given set of on - source images the appropriate combined sky frame was scaled to have the same median value as the data frame and then subtracted .",
    "the resulting sky - subtracted image was then field flattened by the normalized flat - field image .",
    "prior to registration , the sky - subtracted data images were cleaned of ( most ) chip defects using the iraf task fixpix ( a linear interpolator ) and a pixel mask created from the ratio of two lamp - on flats with different exposure times .",
    "the data images were then distortion corrected using the iraf task geotran and distortion files downloaded from the whirc web page .",
    "whirc has a very small dark current ( @xmath30.2 dn sec@xmath86 pix@xmath86 ) compared to the sky background in most filters",
    ". for comparison , whirc j - band has an average sky brightness of @xmath36 dn sec@xmath86 pix@xmath86 .",
    "( dark current is not an issue even in principle for dome flats since we utilize ` on - off ' differences . ) additionally , the sky subtraction procedure functions to remove most of the ( already small ) contribution to the image flux from the dark current .",
    "however , the dark current exhibits a fixed pattern structure .",
    "further , the correct procedure for dark current removal is subtraction _ before _ field - flattening . nonetheless , due to our limited set of dark frames",
    ", we were unable to demonstrate an improvement in image flatness with dark subtraction .",
    "therefore a separate dark subtraction has minimal impact on the reduced images . for future studies focusing on low surface - brightness",
    "extended structure we do recommend a more thorough investigation of dark - current subtraction .    when compared to a super - sky frame made up of an average of a given night s sky images , the dome flats appear to have small ( on the order of 1% ) illumination errors .",
    "however , the illumination appears to vary between nights and potentially even during nights , making correction difficult .",
    "we tested an illumination correction on a small subset of our data and found it made very little difference in the reduced images . due to the limited improvement and variability of the illumination",
    "we do not employ an illumination correction , but again we recommend a more careful exploration of this issue for detailed low surface - brightness studies .",
    "because of whirc s relatively small field of view and the extremely extended nature of ngc  891 on the chip , fully automatic registration procedures ( e.g. scamp ; @xcite ) were found to be unreliable .",
    "therefore we performed relative image registration between individual exposures by hand , first computing source catalogs for each image using source extractor @xcite , then hand - identifying individual sources that overlapped between images .",
    "based on visual comparisons between individual registered images and the psf of the final mosaics , our registration scheme is accurate to @xmath351 pixel .    with the images all registered in relation to each other , we created full j , h , and @xmath4 mosaics using the swarp software package @xcite . because of the extended nature of ngc 891 compared to the whirc field - of - view the estimate of the average flux in the individual data frames used to subtract the combined sky frame is biased , and therefore the background of the sky - subtracted images is over - subtracted . to combat this",
    ", we used the high s / n image mosaics to hand - produce very conservative masks of ngc  891 ( and foreground stars ) , essentially masking out all pixels except those very close to the edge of the mosaic where galaxy contamination is minimized .",
    "this global mask was then converted into a pixel mask for each individual frame .",
    "we then re - ran the pipeline , starting from the sky - subtraction step , this time normalizing the sky images to the source images using only unmasked pixels .",
    "the relative wcs offsets were held constant from the first iteration of the pipeline .",
    "this two - step process effectively removes the over - subtraction bias from the extended nature of ngc  891 in our images .",
    "the next step was to register the image mosaics in an absolute astrometric system .",
    "first we hand - constructed catalogs of the centroids of stars visible on both the whirc @xmath4-band image and the irac 4.5 @xmath8 m image ( see section [ sec : iracdata ] for details on the irac images ) using ds9 @xcite . using the irac image as an astrometric reference is useful not only because we will be using @xmath4-irac colors in our analysis and therefore want good registration between these datasets but also because both the irac and whirc data go much deeper than standard nir calibration catalogs .",
    "we then used the iraf task ccmap to perform the registration . to preserve the excellent relative agreement between bands",
    "the @xmath4-band absolute calibration was applied manually to the j and h bands .    to flux calibrate the images , stars from the 2mass psc with reliable photometry were matched to source extractor integrated fluxes on the mosaics .",
    "we then fit the relationship between log(dn ) and vega magnitude , obtaining fits with standard errors of 0.02 ( 0.03 , 0.02 ) mag in the j ( h , @xmath4 ) bands .",
    "when stacking dithered images together to produce a sky frame , the ideal situation is to have enough exposures so that every pixel on the stacked frame has a large number of samples of the sky background with which to do statistics . in reality , however , even for relatively sparse fields it is not uncommon to find a few pixels on the stacked frame which were masked out on all of the input individual images , usually due to foreground or background contaminants appearing at multiple dither positions . for these pixels",
    "the sky background must be interpolated . as long as this happens only to a small fraction of the total field",
    ", we can still construct a very accurate sky background using our iterative relaxation method , described below .    for each ` problematic ' pixel",
    "we first find the nearest pixel with a valid sky value , and use that value as an initial guess .",
    "then , the average value of all adjacent pixels ( including bad pixels ) is computed , with pixels diagonally adjacent given weights of 1/@xmath155 the weights of horizontally and vertically adjacent pixels .",
    "the weighted average then becomes the next guess for the pixel value , and the difference between the initial guess and the weighted average is computed .",
    "this process iterates for all problematic pixels until the average change per pixel between iterations is below 1% .",
    "when the bad pixels are surrounded ( or nearly surrounded ) by good pixels , this process converges in just a few iterations .",
    "while our dither strategy minimizes source overlap on multiple dithers , it is not perfect and there are a few regions with multiple adjacent bad pixels .",
    "generally , however , convergence occurs in under 100 iterations .",
    "to construct an attenuation correction we fit a curve to the projected image pixels of the rt model . because the attenuation curve is relatively complex",
    ", we employ a piecewise approach to accurately fit the attenuation without relying on very high - order functions , which can have undesirable edge behavior .    for @xmath4 - 4.5@xmath8 m @xmath35 1.5 mag we find that a fourth order polynomial fits the model trends of @xmath26 versus color quite well . for larger values of the attenuation we approximate the relationship as a line . to avoid any bias near the endpoints of the polynomial fit",
    ", we join the line to the polynomial where @xmath4 - 4.5@xmath8 m = 1.3 mag . to connect the two functions we require that both the value and the first derivative of both functions be equal at @xmath4 - 4.5@xmath8 m = 1.3 mag .",
    "this ensures that the attenuation correction is continuous at all points ."
