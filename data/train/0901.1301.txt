    "<S> we discuss the way non - perturbative quantization of cosmological spacetimes in loop quantum cosmology provides insights on the physics of planck scale and the resolution of big bang singularity . in recent years </S>",
    "<S> , rigorous examination of mathematical and physical aspects of the quantum theory has led to a consistent quantization which is consistent and physically viable and some early ideas have been ruled out . </S>",
    "<S> the latter include so called ` physical effects ' originating from modifications to inverse scale factors in the flat models . </S>",
    "<S> the singularity resolution is understood to originate from the non - local nature of curvature in the quantum theory and the underlying polymer representation . </S>",
    "<S> using an exactly solvable model various insights have been gained . </S>",
    "<S> the model predicts a generic occurrence of bounce for states in the physical hilbert space and a supremum for the spectrum of the energy density operator . </S>",
    "<S> it also provides answers to the growth of fluctuations , showing that semi - classicality is preserved to an amazing degree across the bounce . </S>"
