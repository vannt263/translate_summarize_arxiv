    "_  @xcite .",
    "once a minimal set of amplitudes is specified we aim to construct all other amplitudes by demanding they have the correct symmetries and singularities . defining the @xmath0-matrix using its singularities is a long - standing programme which is still active and fruitful  @xcite .    in this letter",
    "we build an @xmath0-matrix from a set of three - point amplitudes using their singularity structure .",
    "the @xmath0-matrix corresponds to a theory of einstein gravity extended by the addition of @xmath1 terms .",

    "@xmath14 these amplitudes have the correct spinor weight and are quadratic in the momenta .",
    "these amplitudes are only defined for complex momenta . for an on - shell three - point amplitude",
    "the condition @xmath15 demands @xmath16 etc . for real momenta",
    "this implies @xmath17 and the vertices are all zero .",
    "however if we consider complex momenta then we can have @xmath18 but @xmath19 .",
    "the tree amplitudes for einstein gravity can be computed recursively starting from these  @xcite . we show that a similar construction can be used for an extended theory .",
    "we extend this theory by adding additional three - point amplitudes which are of higher power in momenta . to be non - trivial",
    ", these three - point amplitudes must either be functions of @xmath20 or @xmath21 exclusively .",
    "the simplest polynomial amplitudes arise with six powers of momenta and are @xmath22 where @xmath23 is an arbitrary constant .",
    "we also have @xmath24 there being no polynomial function with the correct spinor and momentum weight .",
    "the amplitudes in this theory can be expanded as a power series in @xmath25 , @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the einstein gravity amplitude . here",
    "we focus on the @xmath28 part of the extended theory .",
    "this being the leading deformation of the theory from einstein gravity .",

    "however we note that to do so would involve determining increasingly complicated @xmath13-point vertices as the lagrangian is expanded in the graviton field . as we will see the three - point amplitudes are sufficient to completely determine the @xmath0-matrix .",
    "the key element is that the entire @xmath0-matrix is determined from these vertices if we demand that the amplitudes factorise on simple poles .",
    "specifically , for any partition of the external legs into two sets , @xmath31 and @xmath32 with @xmath33 and @xmath34 , if @xmath35 , then when @xmath36 the amplitude is singular with the simple pole being @xmath37 \\;.\\ ] ]    we can excite the pole in @xmath38 by shifting to complex momenta and applying methods of complex analysis .",

    ". additionally we can use the risager shift  @xcite , @xmath40 where @xmath41 is an arbitrary spinor . both shifts change the momenta to be functions of @xmath42 whilst leaving all momenta null and preserving overall momentum conservation .",

    "this is the on - shell recursive expression of  @xcite .",
    "note that if @xmath45 does not vanish at infinity this does not imply factorisation is insufficient to determine the amplitude but only that that particular shift can not be used to engineer the amplitude .",
    "expressions obtained from  ( [ recursiontree ] ) are not manifestly symmetric as the choice of shift legs breaks crossing symmetry , however symmetry is restored in the sum .",
    "this is a highly non - trivial check that the amplitude has been computed successfully .",

    "there are three independent helicity configurations , @xmath52 of these the first two are vanishing in einstein gravity with only the last being non - zero : which is consequently termed the `` maximally - helicity - violating '' ( mhv ) amplitude . for @xmath53",
    "the reverse is true : @xmath54 since there are no possible factorisations , while @xmath55 and @xmath56 are non - zero .",

    "this in indication that  ( [ eq : bcfwshift ] ) yields a shifted all - plus amplitude that does not vanish at infinity .",
    "conversely , for the single minus amplitude we must use the bcfw shift . performing the shifts and evaluating the amplitudes we obtain @xmath57 the other non - zero amplitudes are available by conjugation . for the all - plus amplitude the recursion generates terms that contain the arbitrary spinor @xmath41 , however",
    "the sum of terms is independent of @xmath41 and simplifies to the above .",
    "these expressions also appear as the uv infinite pieces of both two - loop gravity in four dimensions  @xcite and one - loop gravity in six dimensions  @xcite .",
    "_ five - point amplitudes : _ as before the shift  ( [ eq : kaspershift ] ) yields an all - plus amplitude that is independent of @xmath41 and has full crossing symmetry : @xmath58 where @xmath59 @xmath60 and @xmath61 denotes summation over the three cyclic permutations of legs 1,2 and 3 .",
    "@xmath62 denotes the three permutations of @xmath61 together with interchange of legs 4 and 5 .",

    "the non - zero factorisations of the amplitude are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fivepointmhv ] .        this amplitude can be obtained using a bcfw shift of either the two negative helicity legs or of a negative - positive pair .",
    "shifting the two negative legs generates the expression ( using only the second factorisation of fig .",
    "[ fig : fivepointmhv ] ) , @xmath66    this completes the set of five - point amplitudes .",

    "we have made available @xmath67 for @xmath68 in mathematica format at http://pyweb.swan.ac.uk/~dunbar/smatrix.html .",
    "the amplitudes have been generated up to @xmath69 and have the correct symmetries , are @xmath70-independent and have the correct leading soft - limits .",
    "graviton scattering amplitudes are singular as a leg becomes soft .",
    "weinberg  @xcite many years ago presented the leading soft limit .",
    "if we parametrise the momentum of the @xmath13-th leg as @xmath71 then in the limit @xmath72 the singularity in the @xmath13-point amplitude is @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the _ n_1-point amplitude .",
    "the soft - factor @xmath75 is universal and weinberg showed that ( [ softone ] ) does not receive corrections in loop amplitudes .    #",
    "1.#2.#3 ^ -|#2|^- # 1.#2.#3 ^ -|#2 |^+ # 1.#2.#3^+|#2|^+ # 1.#2.#3 ^ -|#2|^-    recently it has also been proposed @xcite that the sub - leading and sub - sub - leading terms are also universal .",
    "this can be best exposed , when a positive helicity leg becomes soft , by setting @xmath76 in the @xmath72 limit the amplitude has @xmath77 singularities . at tree level",
    "the amplitudes satisfy soft - theorems  @xcite whereby their behaviour as @xmath72 is @xmath78 where , for a positive helicity - leg becoming soft  @xcite @xmath79    the proof of the soft theorems follows from ward identities of extended bondi , van der burg , metzner and sachs ( bms ) symmetry  @xcite . although exact for tree level amplitudes these receive loop corrections  @xcite .",
    "we can summarise the behaviour of the leading amplitudes , @xmath80 , simply by stating :    * all the amplitudes calculated satisfy the soft limits of ( [ eq : softtheorem ] ) up to and including the sub - sub - leading term . *",
    "we have verified this for all helicity amplitudes up to @xmath69 .",
    "note : to check  ( [ eq : softtheorem ] ) one must implement momentum conservation consistently between the @xmath13-point amplitudes and the @xmath81-point amplitudes which in essence specifies how the point @xmath82 is approached .",
    "these are several ways to do this .",
    "we have followed the prescription of  @xcite but alternative implementations are possible  @xcite .    in principle we could have found a behaviour of the form @xmath83 where @xmath84 would be an @xmath25 correction to the soft functions and @xmath85 is a non - factorising term . in terms of this",
    "we find @xmath86 .",
    "since the theory we are considering is higher derivative it is not surprising that the leading and sub - leading parts of @xmath84 vanish however it is interesting that the vanishing continues for the sub - sub - leading - unlike the loop corrections to einstein gravity .",
    "we have chosen to extend gravity using a three - point vertex and use a diagrammer approach whereby we only consider the on - shell amplitudes .",
    "there is , of course , complementarity between this approach and that of lagrangian based field theory .",
    "the single choice of three - point amplitude corresponds to the single @xmath1 field density that affects on - shell amplitudes .",
    "this makes the extended @xmath0-matrix simply depend upon the single parameter @xmath25 .",
    "if we were to deform einstein gravity by an additional four - point amplitude then there are more choices consistent with symmetry and spinor weight , e.g. we could have @xmath87 from a field theory perspective this freedom corresponds to the observation that there are multiple @xmath88 tensors that contribute to on - shell amplitudes  @xcite .",
    "the same issue arises when we consider the further expansion in @xmath25 .",
    "if we consider @xmath89 there is a single factorisation as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : alphasquared ] .",
    "the amplitude @xmath90 has the correct factorisation for any choice of @xmath91 .",
    "this ambiguity means we also have to specify the four - point amplitude to determine the @xmath0-matrix . in the diagrammer approach",
    "this ambiguity arises due to the existence of a polynomial function with the correct symmetries and spinor and momentum weight . from a field theory perspective",
    ", additional counterterms can contribute to this amplitude .",
    "specifically , we could deform the theory via @xmath92 and the four - point amplitude is only specified once @xmath93 and @xmath94 are determined .    .",
    "we have constructed the ( leading part ) of the @xmath0-matrix of an extended theory of gravity starting from three - point amplitudes and only demanding factorisation .",
    "the theory is extended by the addition of amplitudes which are polynomial in momentum , thus implicitly imposing locality and unitarity on the @xmath0-matrix .",
    "we also require the amplitudes to have the correct spinor helicity as appropriate for massless particles .",
    "the @xmath0-matrix is then generated entirely from on - shell amplitudes by demanding factorisation .",
    "specifically , we have extended the theory by the addition of three - point amplitudes which , from a field theory perspective , corresponds to introducing @xmath1 terms .",
    "beyond the leading part , polynomial amplitudes exist at higher point and these must be specified to fully determine the @xmath0-matrix .",
    "consistency of this approach and a field theoretic approach beyond leading order requires a correspondence between these polynomial amplitudes and the counter terms contributing to on - shell amplitudes .",
    "we find that these amplitudes satisfy the same soft theorems as the tree amplitudes of einstein gravity .",
    "it is interesting that these theorems are robust to deformations of einstein gravity even at the sub - sub - leading level particularly given the link to bms symmetry which plays an important role in the recent understanding of black hole soft hair  @xcite .",
