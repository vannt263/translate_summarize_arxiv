    "since the discovery of high - transition - temperature ( @xmath6 ) superconductivity in cuprates,@xcite superconductivity in layered transition - metal compounds has been extensively studied .",
    "so far , a variety of exotic superconductors such as srru@xmath7o@xmath8 , na@xmath9coo@xmath7 , iron arsenides and chalcogenides have been found . among them , layered metallonitride halides ( mnx , m = ti , zr , hf ; x = cl , br , i ) discovered by yamanaka _",
    "et al._@xcite are of great interest , for which @xmath6 was found to be as high as 26 k at maximum.@xcite in fact , they had been the second highest record among transition metal compounds until the recent discovery of iron - based superconductors .",
    "the mother compounds of mnx consist of stacking of two - dimensional mn block layers , sandwiched by interlayer halogen ions .",
    "since the interlayer bonding is relatively weak , we can intercalate various louis bases between the layers or deintercalate halogen atoms for the carrier doping.@xcite interestingly , while the mother compounds are non - magnetic band insulators , they become superconductors upon doping .",
    "this is in high contrast with many other superconducting layered transition metal compounds , for which various magnetic phases reside in the vicinity of the superconducting phase .",
    "when we consider the mechanism of superconductivity in the doped mnx , we have two possibilities .",
    "one is a conventional scenario based on the migdal - eliashberg ( me ) theory ,  @xcite where the superconductivity is mediated by phonons , and the damping and retardation effects are treated by self - consistent perturbation theory , retaining the lowest - order dressed - phonon and dressed - coulomb contributions to the self energy .",
    "the momentum dependences of the gap function , self energy , and screened coulomb interaction is neglected within the energy scale of phonons . in the me theory ,",
    "the screened coulomb interaction is conventionally addressed with the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) and the frequency dependence is totally ignored .",
    "the other scenario is to consider the factors neglected in the me theory , in which we consider various pairing glues other than phonons , such as spin , charge , or orbital fluctuations .",
    "in fact , for some layered transition metal superconductors , it has been believed that the pairing mechanism is unconventional .",
    "for example , the anisotropic @xmath10-wave pairing in cuprates and triplet pairing in sr@xmath7ruo@xmath8 are difficult to understand within the me theory . as in the case of iron - based superconductors ,",
    "when the electron - phonon coupling is weak,@xcite we can also safely exclude the possibility of the conventional scenario . on the other hand ,",
    "the situation is not so simple for doped mnx .",
    "experimentally , the knight shift decreases toward zero below @xmath6 , indicating that the cooper pair is spin singlet.@xcite the break - junction and scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements suggest that the gap function does not have nodes.@xcite while these are typical behaviors of conventional superconductors , there are also several observations which support unconventional scenario",
    ". measurements of uniform spin susceptibility@xcite and specific heat@xcite indicate that the electronic density of states ( dos ) at the fermi energy ( @xmath11 ) is small and the estimated total electron phonon coupling @xmath12 is smaller than 0.22 . on the other hand , the specific - heat  @xcite and tunneling - current measurements@xcite give a rather large superconducting gap ratio @xmath13@xmath144.6 - 5.2 or even larger , implying the strong effective pairing interaction between electrons .",
    "also , the nitrogen isotope effect coefficient has been reported to be markedly small as @xmath150.07,@xcite compared with the value of 0.5 for the bcs superconductor.@xcite doping dependence of @xmath6 ( ref .  )",
    "is also difficult to understand in terms of the conventional scenario ; particularly in @xmath0-li@xmath1zrncl , it becomes higher with decreasing doping and exhibits the highest value at the border of the anderson insulating phase and the superconducting phase .",
    "on top of these , more recently , it has been reported that the spin - lattice relaxation rate of the nuclear - magnetic resonance does not exhibit the coherence peak,@xcite and muon spin rotation measurement indicates that the gap function has a significant anisotropy.@xcite    as for theoretical studies , both the phonon and electron mechanisms have been examined and proposed . for the electron mechanism , a possibility of spin - fluctuation - mediated superconductivity has been studied within the lattice fermion model.@xcite for the phonon mechanism , _ ab initio _ analyses based on the me theory have widely been performed : heid and bohnen  @xcite calculated the phonon spectrum and the electron - phonon coupling using density functional perturbation theory and estimated @xmath6 using the dirty - limit gap equation.@xcite they found that @xmath12 is as large as 0.5 for @xmath0-li@xmath16zrncl and the value is too small to explain the experimental value , @xmath6@xmath1516 k , with setting the coulomb pseudo potential @xmath17 ( ref .  ) to a typical value of @xmath150.10 .",
    "et al.__@xcite evaluated the hopfield - mcmillan parameter @xmath18 , also a measure of the electron lattice coupling , for @xmath0-na@xmath19hfncl using the gaspari - gyorffy formula.@xcite they found that @xmath20@xmath140.5 @xmath21 and @xmath22@xmath140.2 @xmath21 , which are one order of magnitude smaller than those of the binary transition - metal - nitride superconductors with @xmath3@xmath1420 k.@xcite on the other hand , recently , yin _ et al._@xcite proposed that @xmath12 is estimated to be larger if we employ the hybrid heyd - scuseria - ernzerhof functional@xcite and @xmath6 given by the macmillan - allen - dines ( mad ) formula@xcite with @xmath17=0.1 shows a nice agreement with experiments .",
    "it should be noted here that there are many examples where @xmath17 substantially ( larger than 50% ) deviates from the typical value @xmath23,@xcite so the problem whether the experimental @xmath3 can be described within the me theory is yet to be clear .",
    "we also note that there have been several studies which try to consider the physics beyond the me theory ; for example , bill _ et al .",
    "_ showed that acoustic plasmon can enhance the phonon - mediated superconductivity.@xcite there are also several studies which propose that disorder can enhance the pairing instability in systems with phonon - mediated attractive interactions.@xcite    for the electronic interaction , there are many efforts for describing it from first principles .",
    "lee _ _ et al.__@xcite proposed a method to evaluate the bare coulomb parameter @xmath24 with _ ab initio _ rpa calculations .",
    "however , there still remains an empirical parameter representing the electronic energy scale , needed for obtaining the renormalized value @xmath25 . on the other hand , lders _",
    "recently developed a parameter - free method to calculate @xmath3 based on density functional theory for superconductors ( scdft),@xcite where electron - phonon coupling and electron - electron interactions are nonempirically treated .",
    "since the exchange - correlation kernels are constructed on the basis of the me theory , the current - stage scdft has a close correspondence with the me theory .",
    "this method has been applied to a wide range of typical phonon - mediated superconductors such as simple metals,@xcite mgb@xmath26,@xcite calcium - intercalated graphite,@xcite li , k and al in high pressure@xcite and cabesi,@xcite and the reliability on the quantitative aspect has been examined and established , where @xmath6s have shown agreements with experimental results within a range of few k.    in this work , we performed an scdft analysis for the lithium - doped @xmath0-mncl ( m = ti , zr , hf ) superconductors to examine whether they can be described by the current scdft formalism based on the me theory .",
    "we calculate electronic structures , phonon spectra , electron - phonon couplings , screened coulomb interactions in the rpa level to estimate superconducting @xmath3 and examine the results focusing on the metallic - atom and doping dependences .",
    "we found that @xmath3 estimated by scdft is at maximum half of the experimental @xmath6 and its doping dependence is opposite to experiments , both of which imply that , as in the unconventional superconductors , the present superconductors require some elements missing in the conventional me theory .    in sec .",

    "although we do not rule out some possibilities of improvement by corrections to one - particle states as the starting point , the revealed discrepancy between the theory and experiment , as is known in the case of the unconventional superconductors , appeals the relevance of something ignored in the standard migdal - eliashberg theory to the superconducting mechanism of the doped @xmath0-mncl .",
    "this remains an open question .",
