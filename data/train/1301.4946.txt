    "the two vertices incident on a non - loop edge are _ neighbors _ , and the _ open neighborhood _ of a vertex @xmath5 is @xmath6neighbors of @xmath7 . a graph in which different edges can be distinguished by their vertex - incidences is a _ looped simple graph _ , and a _ simple graph _ is a looped simple graph with no loop .    in this paper",
    "we are concerned with properties of looped simple graphs motivated by two sets of ideas .",
    "the first set of ideas is the theory of the principal pivot transform ( ppt ) over @xmath8 .",
    "ppt over arbitrary fields was introduced more than 50 years ago by tucker @xcite ; see also the survey of tsatsomeros @xcite . according to geelen @xcite",
    ", ppt transformations applied to the mod-2 adjacency matrices of looped simple graphs are generated by two kinds of _ elementary _ ppt operations , _ non - simple local complementations _ with respect to looped vertices and _ edge pivots _ with respect to edges connecting unlooped vertices .",
    "the second set of ideas is the theory of 4-regular graphs and their euler circuits , initiated more than 40 years ago by kotzig @xcite .",
    "kotzig proved that all the euler circuits of a 4-regular graph are obtained from any one using @xmath9__-transformations__. if a 4-regular graph is directed in such a way that every vertex has indegree 2 and outdegree 2 , then kotzig @xcite , pevzner @xcite and ukkonen @xcite showed that all of the graph s directed euler circuits are obtained from any one through certain combinations of @xmath10-transformations called _ transpositions _ by arratia , bollobs and sorkin @xcite .",
    "bouchet @xcite and rosenstiehl and read @xcite introduced a simple graph associated with any  euler circuit of a connected 4-regular graph , the _ alternance _ graph or _",
    "graph ; an equivalent _ link relation matrix _ was defined by  cohn and lempel @xcite in the context of the theory of permutations .",
    "these authors showed that the effects of @xmath9-transformations and transpositions on interlacement graphs are given by _",
    "simple _ local complementations and edge pivots , respectively .    in the late 1980s , bouchet introduced two new kinds of combinatorial structures associated with these two theories . on the one hand",
    "are the _ delta - matroids _",
    "@xcite , some of which are associated with looped simple graphs . the fundamental operation of delta - matroid theory is a way of changing one delta - matroid into another , called _ twisting_. two looped simple graphs are related through ppt operations if and only if their associated delta - matroids are related through twisting . on the other hand",
    "are the _ isotropic systems _",
    "@xcite , all of which are associated with _",
    "fundamental graphs_. two isotropic systems are _ strongly isomorphic _ if and only if they share fundamental graphs .",
    "moreover , two simple graphs are related through simple local complementations if and only if they are fundamental graphs of strongly isomorphic isotropic systems",
    ". properties of isotropic systems were featured in the proof of bouchet s famous forbidden minors  characterization of circle graphs @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to introduce a binary matroid @xmath0 constructed in a natural way from the adjacency matrix of a looped simple graph @xmath1 ; we call it the _ isotropic matroid of",
    "_ @xmath1 , in honor of bouchet s isotropic systems .",
    "this matroid directly determines both the delta - matroid and the isotropic system associated with @xmath1 .",
    "moreover , it is not difficult to characterize the effects of edge pivots and both kinds of local complementations on isotropic matroids , so we have a single matroid invariant that serves to classify @xmath1 under all the operations mentioned above .    the paper is set up as follows .",
    "first , we recall some basic facts about binary matroids in  section 2 .",
    "@xmath0 is defined in  section 3 ,  where we also discuss a certain kind of matroid isomorphism between isotropic matroids .",
    "the heart of the paper is sections 4 and 5 , where we show that @xmath0 determines @xmath1 up to equivalence under various kinds of complementations and pivots . in section 6",
    "we show that the delta - matroid and isotropic system associated with @xmath1 are determined by @xmath0 , and in section 7 we discuss some fundamental properties of isotropic matroids . in the last section",
    "we show that @xmath0 has another interesting property : appropriately parametrized tutte polynomials of this matroid yield the _ interlace polynomials _ introduced by arratia , bollobs and sorkin @xcite , and also the modified versions subsequently defined by  aigner and van der holst @xcite , courcelle @xcite and the author @xcite .",
    "the ideas in this paper came to mind after the resemblance between the matrices appearing in aigner and van der holst s discussion of interlace polynomials @xcite and our nonsymmetric approach to interlacement in 4-regular graphs @xcite was pointed out to us by r. brijder .",
    "we are grateful to him for years of informative correspondence regarding delta - matroids , isotropic systems , ppt and related combinatorial notions .",
    "we do not review general results and terminology of graph theory and matroid theory here ; instead we refer the reader to standard texts in the field , @xcite for instance .",
    "all the matroids we consider in this paper are _ binary _ :    let @xmath11 be a finite set .",
    "a _ binary matroid _",
    "@xmath12 on @xmath11 is represented by a matrix with entries in @xmath8 , whose columns are indexed by the elements of @xmath11 .",
    "a subset of @xmath11 is dependent in @xmath12 if and only if the corresponding columns of the matrix are linearly dependent .",
    "the binary matroid represented by a matrix is not changed if one row is added to another , or the rows are permuted , or a row of zeroes is adjoined or removed .",
    "also , permuting the columns of a matrix will yield a new matrix that represents an isomorphic binary matroid .",
    "familiar results of elementary linear algebra tell us that consequently , every binary matroid has a representation of the following type :    let @xmath13 be an @xmath14 identity matrix .",
    "a _ standard representation _ of a rank-@xmath15 binary matroid @xmath12 is a matrix of the form @xmath16 that represents @xmath12 .",
    "if @xmath17 is a matrix with entries in @xmath8 then @xmath18 denotes the matroid with standard representation @xmath16 .",
    "recall that if @xmath19 is a basis of a matroid @xmath12 , and @xmath20 is an element of @xmath12 not included in @xmath19 , then the _ fundamental circuit _ of @xmath20 with respect to @xmath19 is@xmath21 where @xmath22 denotes the symmetric difference .",
    "@xmath23 is the unique circuit contained in @xmath24 .",
    "a peculiar property of binary matroids is that the fundamental circuits with respect to any one basis contain enough information to determine a binary matroid .",
    "the same is not true for general matroids ; for instance a matroid on @xmath25 with basis @xmath26 and fundamental circuits @xmath27 and @xmath28 might be either @xmath29 or the circuit matroid of a triangle with one doubled edge .",
    "( @xmath29 is not binary , of course . )",
    "notice that in essence , a standard representation @xmath16 is this kind of description : the matroid elements corresponding to the columns of @xmath13 constitute a basis @xmath19 , and for each element @xmath30 , the fundamental circuit @xmath23 includes @xmath20 together with the elements of @xmath19 corresponding to nonzero entries of the @xmath20 column of @xmath17 .",
    "the only part of this section that does not appear in the textbooks mentioned above is the following simple theorem , which tells us how the various standard representations of a binary matroid are related to each other .",
    "[ fund]let @xmath31 and @xmath32 be @xmath33 matrices with entries in @xmath8 . then @xmath34 if and only if @xmath35 can be obtained from @xmath36 using the following three types of operations on matrices of the form @xmath16 :    \\(a ) permute the columns of @xmath17",
    "\\(b ) permute the columns of @xmath13 and the rows of @xmath16 , using the same permutation .",
    "\\(c ) suppose the @xmath37 entry of @xmath17 is @xmath38 .",

    "as noted above , a standard presentation of a rank-@xmath15 binary matroid @xmath12 on an @xmath44-element set @xmath11 is obtained as follows .",
    "first choose a basis @xmath19 , and index its elements as @xmath45 .",
    "then index the remaining elements of @xmath11 as @xmath46 .",
    "finally , let @xmath17 be the @xmath33 matrix whose @xmath37 entry is 1 if and only if @xmath47 is an element of the fundamental circuit @xmath48 .",

    "suppose now that @xmath38 , and let @xmath50 be the matrix obtained from @xmath17 by an operation of type ( c ) .",
    "another way to describe @xmath50 is this : @xmath51 is obtained from @xmath16 by first interchanging the @xmath52th and @xmath53th columns , and then adding the @xmath52th row of the resulting matrix to every other row in which the original @xmath53th column has a nonzero entry .",
    "that is , the matrix @xmath51 is simply the standard representation corresponding to the basis @xmath54 , with the elements other than @xmath47 and @xmath55 indexed as they were before .",

    "all these references share the underlying presumption that although the interlace and tutte - martin polynomials are connected to other graph polynomials in some ways , they are in a general sense separate invariants . in this section",
    "we point out that in fact , the interlace polynomials of graphs can be derived from parametrized tutte polynomials of isotropic matroids .",
    "one way to define the _ tutte polynomial _ of @xmath0 is a polynomial in the variables @xmath589 and @xmath590 , given by the subset expansion@xmath591 here @xmath592 denotes the rank function of @xmath0 .",
    "we do not give a general account of this famous invariant of graphs and matroids here ; thorough introductions may be found in @xcite .",
    "tutte polynomials of graphs and matroids are remarkable both for the amount of structural information they contain and for the range of applications in which they appear .",
    "some applications ( electrical circuits , knot theory , network reliability , and statistical mechanics , for instance ) involve graphs or networks whose vertices or edges have special attributes of some kind  impedances and resistances in circuits , crossing types in knot diagrams , probabilities of failure and successful operation in reliability , bond strengths in statistical mechanics . a natural way to think of these attributes is to allow each element to carry two parameters , @xmath277 and @xmath285 say , with @xmath277 contributing to the terms of the tutte polynomial corresponding to subsets that include the given element , and @xmath285 contributing to the terms of the tutte polynomial corresponding to subsets that do not .",
    "zaslavsky @xcite calls the resulting polynomial@xmath593 the _ parametrized rank polynomial _ of @xmath0 ; we denote it @xmath594 .",
    "we do not give a general account of the theory of parametrized tutte polynomials here ; the interested reader is referred to the literature , for instance @xcite .",
    "however it is worth taking a moment to observe that parametrized polynomials are very flexible , and the same information can be formulated in many ways .",
    "for instance if @xmath589 and the parameter values @xmath595 are all invertible then formula ( [ partutte ] ) is equivalent to @xmath596 which expresses @xmath594 as the product of a prefactor and a sum that is essentially a parametrized rank polynomial with only @xmath277 parameters and one variable , @xmath597 .",
    "we prefer formula ( [ partutte ] ) , though , because we do not want to assume invertibility of the @xmath285 parameters .",
    "suppose that the various parameter values @xmath598 and @xmath595 are independent indeterminates , and let @xmath222 denote the ring of polynomials with integer coefficients in the @xmath599 independent indeterminates @xmath600 , @xmath601 .",
    "let @xmath602 be the ideal of @xmath222 generated by the set of @xmath603 products @xmath604 , @xmath605 , @xmath606 , @xmath607 , and let @xmath608 be the natural map onto the quotient . then the only summands of ( [ partutte ] ) that make nonzero contributions to @xmath609 correspond to transversals of the canonical partition of @xmath65 , i.e. , subsets @xmath610 with the property that @xmath611 @xmath570 .",
    "we denote the collection of all such transversals @xmath612 .",
    "each @xmath613 has @xmath614 , so @xmath589 and @xmath590 have the same exponent in the corresponding term of ( [ partutte ] ) : @xmath615    observe that @xmath616 is injective when restricted to the additive subgroup @xmath17 of @xmath222 generated by products@xmath617 where @xmath618 and @xmath613 .",
    "consequently there is a well - defined isomorphism of abelian groups @xmath619 , and we have @xmath620    note that @xmath621 , the image of the parametrized tutte polynomial @xmath594 under the mappings @xmath616  and @xmath622 , might also be described as the _ section _ of @xmath594 corresponding to @xmath612 .",
    "either way , formula ( [ partutte2 ] ) describes an element of @xmath222 , where @xmath589 , @xmath590 and the various parameter values @xmath598 , @xmath595 are all independent indeterminates .",

    "let @xmath626 @xmath627 , and for @xmath613 let @xmath628 .",
    "then @xmath629 defines a bijection from @xmath630 onto the power - set of @xmath3 .",
    "as @xmath631 is the @xmath8-rank of the matrix@xmath632 and the columns @xmath69 are columns of the identity matrix , @xmath633).\\ ] ] it follows that @xmath623 may be obtained from @xmath621 by setting @xmath634 , @xmath635 , @xmath636 , @xmath637 , @xmath638 , @xmath639 , @xmath640 and @xmath641 .",
    "these assignments are not unique ; for instance the values of @xmath589 and @xmath590 may be replaced by @xmath642 and @xmath643 for any invertible @xmath225 .",
    "the reader familiar with the tutte - martin polynomials of isotropic systems studied by  bouchet @xcite and the interlace polynomials introduced by aigner and van der holst @xcite , courcelle @xcite , and the author @xcite will have no trouble showing that appropriate values for @xmath589 , @xmath590 and the @xmath277 and @xmath285 parameters yield all of these polynomials from the parametrized rank polynomial @xmath644 .",
