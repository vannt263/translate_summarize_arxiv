    "the double - helix structure of dna is the source of many complications in its _ in - vivo _ functioning during condensation / decondensation , replication , or transcription .",
    "for example the necessary unzipping of the molecule during transcription induces torsional strain along dna .",
    "the development of magnetic tweezers @xcite or the use of quartz cylinders in optical tweezers @xcite allow researchers to investigate the _ in - vitro _ response of dna molecules to torsional stress .",
    "studies of the behaviour of this twist storing polymer are not just a game for physicists as it has been clearly established that , e.g. the assembly of reca could be stalled by torsional constraints @xcite , or that the rate of formation and the stability of the complex formed by promoter dna and rna polymerase depends on the torque present in the dna molecule @xcite . on the theoretical side ,",
    "matters are made difficult by the nonlocality of the topological property that is associated with the torsional constraint : the link .",
    "the two sugar - phosphate backbones of dna have opposite orientation and the ends of a double - stranded dna molecule can only be chemically bound in such a way that each strand joins itself , thereby yielding two interwound closed curves ( no mbius - like configuration can exist ) . for a circularly closed dna molecule ,",
    "the link is the number of times one of the sugar - phosphate backbone winds around the other .",
    "once the three dimensional shape of the molecule is projected onto a plane , the link is given by half the number of signed crossings between the two backbones .",
    "this quantity is best seen as the number of turns put in an initially planar plasmid ( a piece of circularly closed double - stranded dna ) before closing it .",
    "link has been shown to consist of two parts : the two sugar - phosphate backbones of a plasmid can be linked because @xmath0 the plasmid lies in a plane but the base - pairs are twisted around their centre line ( the curve joining the centroids of the base - pairs ) and/or @xmath1 the centre line itself follows a writhed path in space . in general the two possibilities coexist and the link @xmath2 of a dna molecule is the addition of the two quantities @xcite : @xmath3 the twist @xmath4 is a local quantity in the sense that it can be computed as the single integral of the twist rate @xmath5 : @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the arclength along the centre line and @xmath8 the total contour length of the molecule . in elastic dna models , the twist rate @xmath5",
    "is normally coupled to mechanical quantities ( e.g. the torque ) characterizing the molecule .",
    "contrary to the twist , wr is a _ global _ property of the centre line of the molecule .",
    "we first define the _ directional writhe _ of a closed curve @xmath9 .",
    "consider a closed curve in 3d and project this curve , along a certain direction , on a plane .",
    "the number of signed crossings seen in the plane is the directional writhe _ for that direction_. one could then reiterate the procedure with different directions of projection and compute the directional writhe for each direction .",
    "the average value obtained for the directional writhes , when all directions are considered , is the writhe @xmath10 of the 3d curve @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the following double integral has been introduced by clugreanu @xcite and white @xcite : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the position of points on @xmath9 and @xmath13 is the unit tangent to @xmath9 .",

    "it is the main purpose of this paper to show that these hypotheses are not met in the case of plectonemic dna .",
    "fuller s theorem @xcite states that the writhe of the curve @xmath9 can be computed by considering the writhe of a reference curve @xmath18 ( which should be known or easy to compute ) and the continuous deformation ( a homotopy ) morphing @xmath18 to @xmath9 : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the unit tangent to @xmath18 and where @xmath21 $ ] is a common parametrization for both curves , though not necessarily the arclength along @xmath9 or @xmath18 .",

    "we nevertheless remark that even in the case of self - intersection or antipodal points fuller s formula is always correct _ modulo _ 2 : the integer , and most important , part of @xmath10 will not be correct , but the fractional part will .",
    "each antipodal point present in the continuous deformation from @xmath18 to @xmath9 introduces a shift of two units between the actual writhe @xmath10 of the curve @xmath9 and the value @xmath36 @xcite .",

    "the quantities @xmath77 and @xmath78 do not suffer from the same pathologies in the computation of the writhe , contrarily to what is claimed in @xcite .",
    "another consequence is that , when sampling dna configurations to construct a statistical ensemble and compute writhe averages and fluctuations , it is not enough to introduce , as was done in @xcite , a small forbidden region around the south pole of the unit sphere to ensure that @xmath78 yields a correct value .",

    "we saw that if a continuous deformation @xmath22 with @xmath23 $ ] contains an antipodal event , then @xmath78 does not yield the correct result after the antipodal event . now one can argue that yet another continuous deformation , free of antipodal events and self - crossings , may exist ( with the same initial and final curves ) and that in this case @xmath78 would yield the correct result .",
    "this is not the case since , as we show in appendix b , as soon as a corrupted deformation exists in between two curves @xmath18 and @xmath9 , then _ all _ continuous deformations are corrupted and @xmath78 definitely yields an incorrect result .",
    "this means that the reference curve @xmath18 can not be used .",

    "it appears that an easy way to verify the applicability of fuller formula ( [ equa : fuller_2nd_theo ] ) between an actual curve and a reference curve is to consider any convenient deformation that avoids antipodal events .",
    "this can always be done if one allows for self - crossings .",
    "then formula ( [ equa : fuller_2nd_theo ] ) is applicable if and only if the net sum of self - crossings is zero . in the case of numerical computations ,",
    "either dealing with continuation of mechanical equilibria or statistical ensembles of configurations , the writhe can be assessed in an accurate way by using both the double integral ( [ equa : writhe_def ] ) and fuller integral ( [ equa : fuller_euler_angle ] ) in a cooperative way .",
    "the double integral being time consuming to evaluate , one can in a first step discretize it @xcite with a reduced number of elements so that it produces an approximate result that only has to be accurate up to @xmath93 ( one still has to estimate how many elements are needed to obtain such an accuracy @xcite ) . then in a second step , fuller integral is used to refine the result .",
    "even if fuller integral may be off by several integers , its fractional part is correct . in this scheme , the double integral yields the integer part of the writhe and fuller integral yields the fractional part of the writhe .",
    "moreover in cases where one knows the correct value of the writhe of a nearby configuration ( e.g. a predecessor configuration , one move away in a monte - carlo scheme ) this value can be used as the approximate result of the first step and one only has to compute fuller integral to obtain a correct and accurate value of the writhe .",
