    "the famous @xmath2-queens problem asks for the number of arrangements of @xmath2 nonattacking queens  the largest possible number  on an @xmath1[d : n ] chessboard .",
    "( see , for instance , @xcite . )",
    "there is no known general formula , other than the very abstract , that is to say impractical one we obtained in part  ii .",
    "solutions have been found only by individual analyses for small @xmath2 .    in this series of five papers",
    "@xcite we treat the problem by separating the board size , @xmath2 , from the number of queens , @xmath0,[d : q ] and rephrasing the whole problem in geometry .",
    "we also generalize to every piece @xmath3 whose moves are , like those of the queen , rook , and bishop , unlimited in length .",
    "such pieces are known as `` riders '' in fairy chess ( chess with modified rules , moves , or boards ) ; an example is the nightrider , whose moves are those of the knight extended to any distance .",
    "the problem then , given a fixed rider @xmath3 , is :    [ pr : formula ] find an explicit , easily evaluated formula for @xmath4[d : indistattacks ] , the number of nonattacking configurations of @xmath0 unlabelled pieces @xmath3 on an @xmath5 board .",
    "two kinds of piece were previously solved : the rook , which is elementary , and the bishop , for which arshon and kotovec  found a single formula . aside from those two , formulas in terms of @xmath2 have been found for only a few riders and only for small numbers of pieces  for instance , up to 6 queens or 3 nightriders  and mostly heuristically , without rigorous proof .",
    "( given the power of computers , proving a formula is more difficult than making an educated guess , which itself is by no means easy even for an expert like vclav kotovec  @xcite . )",
    "finding a single comprehensive formula , for all numbers of pieces @xmath0 and all board sizes @xmath2 , for any piece other than the rook and bishop  especially for the queen , the original problem of this type  looks impossible .",
    "one difficulty is not being certain what such a formula should look like .",
    "[ pr : format ] describe the nature of a formula for @xmath4 for an arbitrary piece .",
    "one would wish there to be one style of formula that applies to all riders .",
    "this ideal is realized to an extent .",
    "we proved in part  i that for each rider @xmath3 , @xmath4 is a quasipolynomial function of @xmath2 of degree @xmath6 and that the coefficients of powers of @xmath2 are given by polynomials in @xmath0 , up to a simple normalization ; for instance , the leading term is @xmath7 .",
    "being a quasipolynomial means that for each fixed @xmath0 , @xmath4 is given by a cyclically repeating sequence of polynomials in @xmath2 ( called the _ constituents _ of the quasipolynomial ) ; the shortest length of such a cycle is the period of @xmath4 .",
    "that raises a fundamental question .",
    "[ pr : period ] what is the period @xmath8[d : p ] of the quasipolynomial formula for @xmath4 ?",
    "( the period , which pertains to the variable @xmath2 , may depend on @xmath0 . )",
    "the period tells us how much data is needed to rigorously determine the complete formula ; @xmath9 values of the counting function determine it completely , since the degree is @xmath6 and the leading coefficient is known .",
    "the difficulty with this computational approach is that , in general , @xmath8 is hard to determine and seems usually to explode with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "( indeed , we have reason to believe the period increases at least exponentially for any rider with at least three moves ; see theorem  [ t : exponential ] . )",
    "a better way would be to find information about the @xmath4 that is valid for all @xmath0 .",
    "[ pr : coeffs ] for a given piece @xmath3 , find explicit , easily evaluated formulas for the coefficients of powers of @xmath2 in the quasipolynomials @xmath4 , valid for all values of @xmath0 .",
    "a complete solution to problem [ pr : coeffs ] would solve problem [ pr : formula ] .",
    "we think that is unrealistic but we have achieved some results . in part  i we took a first step : in each constituent polynomial , the coefficient @xmath10 of @xmath11 is ( neglecting a denominator of @xmath12 ) itself a polynomial in @xmath0 of degree @xmath13 , that varies with the residue class of @xmath2 modulo a period @xmath14 that is independent of @xmath0 . in other words ,",
    "if we count down from the leading term there is a general formula for the @xmath15th coefficient as a function of @xmath0 that has its own intrinsic period ; the coefficient is independent of the overall period @xmath8 .",
    "this opens the way to explicit formulas and in part  ii we found such a formula for the second leading coefficient as well as the complete quasipolynomial for an arbitrary rider with only one move  an unrealistic game piece but mathematically informative . in part",
    "iii we found the third and fourth coefficients by concentrating on _ partial queens _ ,",
    "whose moves are a subset of the queen s .    still , that is only scratching at the surface ; we want to go further .",
    "in this part we present our current state of knowledge about specific pieces : the queen , rook , bishop , and nightrider and the pieces that have a subset of their moves .",
    "our goal is to prove exact quasipolynomial formulas for a fixed number @xmath0 of each piece , where @xmath0 is ( unavoidably ) small , and along the way to see how many complete formulas we can prove for coefficients of high powers of @xmath2 .",
    "how large a number @xmath0 and how many coefficients we can handle depends on the piece . for the rook , naturally , we get well - known formulas for all @xmath0 . at the other extreme",
    "we have only very partially solved three nightriders , for which the formula was previously found heuristically , without proof , by kotovec .",
    "no formula for four nightriders has even been guessed ; it is conceivable , but judging by the 11-digit denominator we computed ( see table  [ tb : nightriders ] ) not probable , that it could be obtained by a painstaking analysis using our method .",
    "we offer no hope for five .",
    "one reason we want a quasipolynomial is to substitute @xmath16 to get the number of combinatorially distinct types of configuration , as explained in section  i.5 .",
    "the arshon ",
    "kotovec  formula for bishops is not a quasipolynomial and does not help us find the bishops counting quasipolynomials .",
    "for that reason we consider the bishops problem only partially solved and we give it close attention in part  v.    we summarize our geometrical approach : we create a configuration of points and lines to represent attacks of specified slopes .",
    "the boundaries of the square determine a hypercube in @xmath17[d : configsp ] and the attack lines determine hyperplanes whose @xmath18-fractional points within the hypercube represent attacking configurations , which must be excluded ; the nonattacking configurations are the integral points inside the hypercube and outside every hyperplane , so it is they we want to count .",
    "the combination of the hypercube and the hyperplanes is an inside - out polytope @xcite .",
    "the ehrhart theory of inside - out polytopes implies quasipolynomiality of the counting function and that the period divides the _ denominator _ @xmath19,[d : d ] defined as the least common multiple of the denominators of all coordinates of vertices of the inside - out polytope .",
    "then we apply the inside - out adaptation of ehrhart lattice - point counting theory , in which we combine by mbius inversion the numbers of lattice points in the polytope that are in each intersection subspace of the hyperplanes .",
    "we also investigate the denominators of individual vertices , which provide a better understanding of the period because the overall denominator bounds it .",
    "in general in ehrhart theory the period and the denominator need not be equal and often are not , so it is surprising that in all our examples , and for any rider with only one move , they are .",
    "we can not prove that is always true for the inside - out polytopes arising from the problem of nonattacking riders , but this observation suggests that our approach to that problem may be a good test case for understanding the relationship between denominators and periods .",
    "we find an exact formula for the denominator of a one - move rider in proposition  [ p:1moveiv ] , and we introduce a notion of trajectories to give intuition about finding the denominator for a piece with two moves ( section  [ sec : config2 m ] ) . we show that when a piece has three or more moves , by letting the number @xmath0 of pieces increase we obtain a sequence of inside - out polytope vertices with denominators that increase exponentially , and the polytope denominators may increase even faster .",
    "these vertices arise from geometrical constructions related to fibonacci numbers .",
    "a summary of this paper : section [ parti ] recalls some essential notation and formulas from parts  i  iii .",
    "section [ sec : period ] describes the concepts we use to analyze the periods .",
    "we turn to the theory of attacking configurations of pieces with small numbers of moves in sections  [ sec : fewer ] and [ sec : moremoves ] , partly to establish formulas and conjectural bounds for the denominators of their inside - out polytopes , especially for partial queens and nightriders , and partly to support the exponential lower bound on periods and our many conjectures . after connecting to our theory the known results on rooks in section  [ r ]",
    ", we discuss the current state of knowledge and ignorance about bishops and semi - bishops in section  [ b ] .",
    "section  [ q ] treats the queen as well as the partial queens that are not the rook , bishop , and semi - bishop .",
    "section  [ n ] concerns the nightrider and sub - nightriders , whose nonattacking placements have not been the topic of any previous theoretical discussion that we are aware of .",
    "we conclude with questions related to these ideas and with proposals for research .",
    "for example , since counting nonattacking rider placements is an accessible topic in ehrhart theory , we suggest in section [ simplified ] fairy chess pieces with relatively simple behavior that might provide insight into the central open problem of a good general bound on the period of the counting quasipolynomial in terms of @xmath0 and the set of moves . in future work",
    "we will prove stronger properties , such as that every positive integer @xmath20 appears as a denominator given enough pieces ; specifically , about @xmath21 pieces where @xmath22 depends on the piece s set of moves .",
    "we append a dictionary of notation for the benefit of the authors and readers .",
    "we must mention kotovec s book @xcite , replete with formulas , mostly generated by himself , for all kinds of nonattacking chess problems .",
    "we learned of this work after beginning our research ; then properties of kotovec s bishops and queens formulas inspired much of our detailed results .",
    "for instance , we saw that the coefficients of highest degree are constant ( independent of @xmath2 ) ; then we proved most of the observed constancies .",
    "kotovec  conjectured some formulas for high - degree coefficients ; we prove some of those conjectures .",
    "we saw that the bishops quasipolynomials ( for @xmath23 ) all have period 2 ; in part  v we prove that is true for every number ( at least 3 ) of bishops .",
    "kotovec  conjectured that the period of a queens quasipolynomial is a product of fibonacci numbers ; we take a step toward a proof .",
    "anyone who wants to know the actual number of nonattacking placements of @xmath0 of our four principal pieces will find answers in the online encyclopedia of integer sequences @xcite .",

    "<S> parts i  iii showed that the number of ways to place @xmath0 nonattacking queens or similar chess pieces on an @xmath1 chessboard is a quasipolynomial function of @xmath2 whose coefficients are essentially polynomials in @xmath0 and , for pieces with some of the queen s moves , proved formulas for these counting quasipolynomials for small numbers of pieces and high - order coefficients of the general counting quasipolynomials .    </S>",
    "<S> in this part , we focus on the periods of those quasipolynomials by calculating explicit denominators of vertices of the inside - out polytope . </S>",
    "<S> we find an exact formula for the denominator when a piece has one move , give intuition for the denominator when a piece has two moves , and show that when a piece has three or more moves , geometrical constructions related to the fibonacci numbers show that the denominators grow at least exponentially with the number of pieces .    </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we provide the current state of knowledge about the counting quasipolynomials for queens , bishops , rooks , and pieces with some of their moves . </S>",
    "<S> we extend these results to the nightrider and its subpieces , and we compare our results with the empirical formulas of kotovec . </S>"
