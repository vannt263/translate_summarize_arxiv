    "remarkable capabilities appearing in hearing are essentially governed by both passive mechanical and active biophysical procedures in the cochlea .",
    "the physics of hearing is pioneered by von helmholtz in 1880s  @xcite .",
    "he proposed that different regions along the longitudinal length of the cochlea vibrate independently , working as a series of oscillators driven by the pressure of the fluid filled in the cavity of the cochlea .",
    "the coupling among the successive parts of the cochlea is thought to be mainly determined through the fluid , instead of the cochlea itself",
    ". benefitted from the achievements in both the experimental techniques and the theoretical methods , auditory physics has been developing continuously from the time of von helmholtz and expanding on ever - widening problems  @xcite .",
    "observations revealed that the cochleae are coiled in almost all mammals , monotremes being the exceptions .",
    "this auditory apparatus is a fully fluid - filled system of canals contained inside the petrous bone .",
    "it suggests that detailed calculation of the fluid motion and the pressure distribution within the cochlea should be crucial for understanding of hearing in any mechanical models of the cochlea .",
    "fluid in the cochlea is a lymph .",
    "physically , it can be treated as incompressible and inviscid as a reasonable approximation  @xcite .",
    "the cavity of the cochlea is partitioned by the basilar membrane ( bm ) into two channels which are connected through the helicotrema at the apex of the cochlea . at the other end , the base ,",
    "the channels are sealed by two movable membranes working as pistons .",
    "these two movable membranes are labeled as the oval and the round windows , respectively .",
    "the channel abutting to the oval window is named as scala vestibuli ( upper channel ) .",
    "another channel abutting to the round window is known as scala tympani ( lower channel ) .",
    "the upper channel is further separated by the reissner s membrane ( rm ) into two subducts . however , the rm is usually ignored in the mechanical models for the cochlea because of its extreme flexibility , when the axial flow behavior is the main focus . as a consequence , the structure of the cochlea",
    "is typically modeled by two channels with the bm as their interface in most mechanical studies . however , when the spanwise pressure distribution is included in the study , the rm affects the flow characteristics and , thus , can not be neglected .",
    "we will address this problem below .",
    "the stapes is attached on the oval window and forms the boundary between the middle and the inner ear .",
    "incoming sound waves are transmitted into the fluid in the channels of the cochlea through the vibration of the stapes .",
    "nearly entire mechanical sound energy exerted by the stapes is used to produce the fluid movement . the sound pressure transmitted to the cochlear fluid interacts mechanically with the bm and vibrates it into oscillation in the form of a traveling wave that propagates along the bm from the base to the apex .",
    "the traveling wave on the bm grows as it travels , reaching a maximum at a position known as the characteristic place determined by the frequency of the stimulus , and then declines rapidly .",
    "the characteristic behavior along the longitudinal cochlea is described by a place - frequency map ; high frequencies are resonant near the basal end , whereas low frequencies are resonant near the apical end  @xcite .",
    "the first direct observation of the responses of the bm to sounds through experiment was achieved by von bksey  @xcite .",
    "he measured the bm movement of the cadaver and found that the mechanical response is a traveling wave propagating from the base to the apex .",
    "subsequent in - vivo measurements revealed that the responses of the bm are sharply tuned and very sensitive at low sound - pressure levels .",
    "hence it is evident that hearing involves an active process .",
    "however , a passive mechanism also plays an essential role in hearing and also in understanding the auditory phenomena .",
    "although the spiral coiling is one of the most distinct characters of the cochlea , it has been neglected in many mechanical models  @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is one of the prime interests to ask whether the shape of the cochlea influences hearing or just facilitates the packing of the long bm into a small space . if the answer is the latter , then the cochlea can be safely modeled as a straightly shaped duct to avoid the complexity of the spiral shape . due to the mathematical difficulties in dealing with the shape of the cochlea",
    ", this problem has not been fully answered yet .",
    "earlier studies mostly concluded that the shape of the cochlea has little effect on the response of the bm along the center line  @xcite .",
    "however , recently , manoussaki _ et .",
    "al . _ employed a wkb - like and linearly approximated solution to examine the effect of the curvature of the cochlea on the redistribution of the wave energy density . according to their linear expansion",
    ", it was concluded that the spiral geometry of the cochlea does play an essential role in creating a tilt of the bm between the outer and the inner wall , which is believed to be important to produce the vibration of the hair cells .",
    "the calculated tilt is shown to be proportional to the curvature of the center line of the cochlea and , thus , the maximum of the tilt is predicted to be always at the apex  @xcite . in the present paper",
    ", we employ a three dimensional fluid model without the assumption of the wkb - like solution . by employing a conformal transformation and a long - wave approximation ,",
    "we explicitly obtain the solutions of the fluid model which satisfies the boundary condition .",
    "our analytic solution shows that the manoussaki _ et al _ s solution  @xcite is naturally included as the lowest component of the general solutions , and has no flux across the channel width .",
    "the general solution shows that the resultant pressure acting on the bm is not uniform across the channel width .",
    "it is shown that different responsive modes show different patterns of the spanwise pressure tilt along the longitudinal length of the bm . especially , for higher modes which allow the flux across the channel width , the magnitude of the pressure tilt is not always a monotonic function of the curvature as predicted by manoussaki _",
    "et al . _",
    "since the real fluid oscillation is a linear superposition of several modes , we expect that the the maximum of the resultant pressure tilt is not located exactly at the apex as predicted by manoussaki _",

    "@xcite , but at a position determined by the input wave and the geometry of the cochlea .",
    "the arrangement of this paper is as follows . in sec .",

    "iii discusses the pressure in the fluid using the navier - stokes equation .",
    "iv gives a discussion on the results .",
    "v concludes the paper .",
    "because most mammalian cochleae are coiled into a spiral , the cochlea is approximately modeled as a logarithmic spiral duct with a rectangular cross section and the rm is approximately considered as the center line in the upper channel as shown in fig .  1 , although the detailed geometry is much more complicated .",
    "we also assume that it stays in plane in the present model although the center line of the cochlea coils out - of - plane in reality , the bm partitions the duct into two channels , the upper and the lower channels .",
    "the height and the width of the cochlea are assumed uniform along its longitudinal length . in what follows",
    ", we mainly discuss the response of the fluid in the outer part of the upper channel , between the rm and the outer wall using our idealized geometry .",
    "the result can be extended to the lower channel by considering the connectivity of the helicotrema and the symmetry as elaborated in the references  @xcite .",
    "cochlea fluid is approximated as incompressible and irrotational , i.e. , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the velocity of the fluid .",
    "hence the velocity of the fluid in the cochlea can be described in terms of the velocity potential , @xmath5 .",
    "thus , the velocity potential @xmath6 satisfies the laplace equation @xmath7 in the cylindrical polar coordinate system , @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the coordinates in the plane of the bm ; @xmath11 is the coordinate perpendicular to the bm . at the apex",
    ", the polar angle is zero and at the spiral axis , @xmath12 .",
    "recently manoussaki _ et al .",
    "_ studied the cochlea curvature effect on the radial shearing in the bm region  @xcite . instead of solving the laplace equation , eq .",
    "( [ vp_lp ] ) directly , they assumed a wkb - like propagating wave solution , @xmath13 , \\label{wkb}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is a slowly varying function of the angular coordinate @xmath10 , @xmath15 the distance to the spiral duct midline from the spiral axis , @xmath16 the axial wave number , and @xmath17 the input frequency .",
    "they applied this solution to the continuity and interface equations of the bm motion to obtain the bm displacement . in the first order approximation",
    ", they found that the displacement of the bm - fluid interface gets tilted across the width of the partition and the spanwise amplitude slope varies as @xmath18 .",
    "thus , they predicted that the maximum of the tilt to be always at the apex in the long - wavelength limit and the spiral shape of the cochlea plays an important role in distributing the wave energy density towards the cochlea s outer wall .",
    "however , it is believed that the pressure is transmitted through the fluid and not through the bm itself .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to study the detailed fluid response to the applied pressure in order to obtain detailed information on the pressure redistribution and the sound propagation . in the present study",
    ", we solve the laplace equation directly without the assumption of the wkb - like plane wave solution .",
    "since the above equation does not contain any explicit time - dependence , solutions of this equation can not describe propagation of the waves along the cochlea .",
    "however , it can give information on the spanwise distribution of the pressure on the bm of the steady response .",
    "it has been demonstrated that at least to the first order approximation , the in - phase assumption is a good approximation to discuss the spanwise profile of the bm  @xcite . separating the variable , @xmath11 , from the rest two variables , we have @xmath19 . eq .",
    "( [ vp_lp ] ) is separated into two independent parts @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a separation constant that can be any constant . here",
    ", we note that if we apply the wkb - like solution , eq .  ( [ wkb ] ) , to eq .",
    "( [ lp2 ] ) , we obtain the same result as in ref .",
    "now , we impose a boundary condition that the wall of the cochlea is impermeable , i.e. , the velocity of the fluid normal to the wall is zero on the walls of the cochlea .",
    "however , because the rm is extremely flexible , the velocity normal to the rm is not necessarily zero . since the rm is fixed on the bm , the pressure distribution near the intersection line between the rm and the bm is expected to be much complicated .",
    "the solution for such a case can only be obtained through very complicated numerical calculations . since",
    ", it is the aim of this paper to investigate the curvature effect of the cochlea and improve from the wkb - like solution , we neglect the edge effect and assume that the rm behaves as a free bondary .",
    "therefore , the solution of the velocity potential in the vertical direction to the bm is @xmath22 , \\label{vs}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is the half height of the cochlea . for simplicity",
    ", we assume that @xmath21 is sufficiently small , @xmath24 . note that the small @xmath21 corresponds to a long - wave approximation  @xcite .",
    "we will discuss later that the small @xmath21 is also related to a weak stimulation .",
    "accordingly , eq .  ( [ lp2 ] )",
    "is approximately rewritten as @xmath25 the solution of eq .",
    "( [ lp3 ] ) thus can be obtained as @xmath26 where @xmath27 is any integer and @xmath28 the constants to be determined by the boundary conditions .",
    "@xmath29 terms are neglected to avoid diverging contributions at small @xmath9 . in order to employ techniques developed in the harmonic functions , the velocity potential , @xmath30 ,",

    "the solution should satisfy the boundary condition , impermeability of the spiral walls .",
    "it thus requires to recombine these separated variables together in an appropriate way , so that the spiral boundary condition can be conveniently achieved .",
    "conformal transformation is a natural way to achieve it .",
    "we introduce a complex potential , @xmath35 .",
    "for @xmath36 being analytic , @xmath30 and @xmath37 must satisfy the riemann - cauchy relation , @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the real and the imaginary parts of the complex variable , @xmath34 , i.e. , @xmath41 .",
    "it is easy to verify that the imaginary part of the complex potential is the streamline of the fluid , @xmath42 $ ] .",

    "accordingly , the velocity potential is also a function of @xmath27 .",
    "different @xmath27 corresponds to each different responsive mode . to distinguish different modes , we introduce a suffix @xmath27 into the two - dimensional and the three dimensional velocity potential , velocity and pressure , i.e. , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 , respectively . in general , @xmath56 where @xmath57 represents the largest integer that is smaller than or equal to @xmath39 .",
    "the above solution shows that the originally separated variables are recombined through the conformal transformation in the process of generating the spiral boundary .",

    "the covering area of the spiral increases with @xmath60 describing the compactness of the logarithmic spiral . on the outer wall , @xmath61 ,",
    "the boundary condition of the impermeability of the cochlea wall requires that the normal component of the velocity should be zero ; @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the unit vector normal to the spiral ( see appendix a ) .",

    "we explicitly get the solution of the velocity potential of the outer part of the upper channel . according to eq .",
    "( [ po1 ] ) , the normal velocity is always zero in the first mode .",
    "consequently , this solution can be directly extended to the inner part of the cochlear duct . in this case , the fluid only has angular flux and the rm can be neglected in the mechanical model . however , for eqs .",
    "( [ po2 ] ) and ( [ po3 ] ) , the fluid possesses normal flux .",
    "the normal velocity on the outer wall is zero but it is nonzero on the rm .",
    "thus , it is expected that the rm critically influences fluid flow for the higher modes . in order to investigate this point",
    "more closely , we carried out a similar calculation on the inner part , from the inner wall to the rm .",
    "we find the normal velocities of the inner side and the outer side on the rm are virtually the same .",
    "thus , we belive that when the stimulation is weak so that no excessive pressure can be build up at the rm and at the bm boundary , the assumption of the free boundary for the rm can provide at least a qualitative picture for the bm oscillation .",
    "the pressure of the fluid is governed by the navier - stokes ( n - s ) equation  @xcite .",
    "viscosity of the lymph in the cochlear duct is usually negligible in the studies of hearing  @xcite .",
    "the inviscid n - s equation reads @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the density of the fluid ; @xmath75 ; @xmath76 is the pressure of the fluid . in the study of hearing ,",
    "the disturbance of the fluid in the cochlea is usually small .",
    "therefore , the pressure in the fluid can be obtained through the linearized n - s equation  @xcite @xmath77    the pressure in different modes can thus be obtained through the linearized n - s equation @xmath78t(t ) , \\label{pressure}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we assume an input frequency @xmath17 .",
    "the fluid pressure right above and below the bm are @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "when the upper channel is driven alone , the cochlear duct is expected to reduce the encountered large impedance through the lower channel .",
    "it has been shown that due to the symmetric structure of the upper and the lower channels and the connectivity of the helicotrema , we obtain an approximate relation @xmath81",
    "hence the net pressure in the mode @xmath27 , which is the pressure difference between the upper and the lower channels acting on the bm , is @xmath82 where @xmath55 is the pressure in the upper duct in the mode @xmath27 .",
    "we define a dimensionless tilt of pressure on the bm , which can be directly compared to the bm displacement tilt in ref .",
