    "nonlinear contraction theory is a comparatively recent dynamic control system design tool based on an exact differential analysis of convergence  @xcite .",
    "in essence , it allows one to convert a nonlinear stability problem into a linear time - varying stability problem .",
    "contraction analysis relies on finding a suitable _ metric _ to study a generally nonlinear and time - varying system .",
    "depending on the application , the metric may be trivial ( identity or rescaling of states ) , or obtained from physics , combination of contracting subsystems  @xcite , semi - definite programming  @xcite , or recently sums - of - squares programming  @xcite .",
    "the goal of this paper is to show that the computation of the metric may be largely simplified or avoided altogether by extending the exact differential analysis to the higher - order dynamics of the nonlinear system .",
    "intuitively this is not surprising , since , as an elementary instance , a scalar linear time - invariant system would require in the original approach a non - identity metric ( obtained from a lyapunov matrix equation ) .",
    "after a brief review of contraction theory in section 2 , the main results are presented in section 3 , first in the discrete - time case ( with a simple application to price dynamics in economics ) and then in the continuous - time case .",
    "simple examples and applications are discussed in section 4 , in the contexts of classical mechanics , process control , and observer design ( see @xcite for other recent applications of contraction theory to observer design ) .",
    "hamiltonian systems are studied in section 5 .",
    "concluding remarks are offered in section 6 .",
    "the basic theorem of contraction analysis  @xcite can be stated as    consider the deterministic system @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is a smooth nonlinear function .",
    "if there exist a uniformly positive definite metric    @xmath2    such that the hermitian part of the associated generalized jacobian @xmath3    is uniformly negative definite , then all system trajectories converge exponentially to a single trajectory , with convergence rate @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the largest eigenvalue of the hermitian part of @xmath6 .",
    "the system is said to be contracting .",
    "[ th : theoremf ]    in the above , @xmath7 denotes complex conjugation , @xmath8 for a matrix denotes the inverse of the conjugate matrix , and the state - space is @xmath9 ( in this paper ) or @xmath10 .",
    "the system is said to be _ semi - contracting _ ( for the metric @xmath11 ) if @xmath12 is always negative semi - definite , and _ indifferent _ if @xmath12 is always zero .",
    "it can be shown conversely that the existence of a uniformly positive definite metric with respect to which the system is contracting is also a necessary condition for global exponential convergence of trajectories . in the linear time - invariant case",
    ", a system is globally contracting if and only if it is strictly stable , with @xmath12 simply being a normal jordan form of the system and @xmath13 the coordinate transformation to that form .",
    "conceptually , approaches closely related to contraction , although not based on differential analysis , can be traced back to @xcite and even to @xcite .",
    "similarly , a discrete system @xmath14 will be contracting in a metric @xmath15 if the largest singular value of the discrete jacobian @xmath16 is strictly smaller than 1 . in the particular case of real autonomous systems with identity metric",
    ", the basic contraction theorem corresponds in the continuous - time case to krasovkii s theorem  @xcite , and in the discrete - time case to the contraction mapping theorem  @xcite .",
    "contraction theory proofs make extensive use of _ virtual displacements _ , which are differential displacements at fixed time borrowed from mathematical physics and optimization theory .",
    "formally , if we view the position of the system at time @xmath17 as a smooth function of the initial condition @xmath18 and of time , @xmath19 , then @xmath20 .",
    "for instance  @xcite , for the system of theorem 1 , one easily computes @xmath21    an appropriate metric to show that the system is contracting may be obtained from physics , combination of contracting subsystems  @xcite , semi - definite programming  @xcite , or sums - of - squares programming  @xcite .",

    "<S> nonlinear contraction theory is a comparatively recent dynamic control system design tool based on an exact differential analysis of convergence , in essence converting a nonlinear stability problem into a linear time - varying stability problem . </S>",
    "<S> contraction analysis relies on finding a suitable _ metric _ to study a generally nonlinear and time - varying system . </S>",
    "<S> this paper shows that the computation of the metric may be largely simplified or indeed avoided altogether by extending the exact differential analysis to the higher - order dynamics of the nonlinear system . </S>",
    "<S> simple applications in economics , classical mechanics , and process control are described .    </S>",
