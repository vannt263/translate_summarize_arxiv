    "there exists no direct measurement of @xmath1 .",
    "however , using different assumptions and experimental data , two indirect determinations of the above branching ratio have been given  @xcite .",
    "these two values are quite different , and thus it is likely that one of the procedures is incorrect .",
    "+ note that , since the channel @xmath2 is used for normalisation , a change in its branching ratio will affect most of the @xmath3 exclusive decay widths .",
    "+ here we propose a method , based on neutrino quasi - elastic charm production process , to directly measure the @xmath4 branching ratios .",
    "this measurement , solving the above puzzle , will provide new insight on the underlying hadronic physics .",
    "+ this letter has the following structure : in section  [ model ] we discuss the two different determinations of @xmath5 and the physics impact of a direct measurement . in section  [ chprod ] , the charm production in neutrino scattering",
    "is analysed by studying topology , kinematics and cross - sections of quasi - elastic processes and deep inelastic reactions , which are the main source of background .",
    "the evaluation of the accuracy achievable for these @xmath3-exclusive decay widths in neutrino scattering is performed in section  [ metho ] . in the last section ,",
    "we give our conclusions .",
    "as stated above , two different methods to extract @xmath7 from the experimental data have been proposed in literature  @xcite .",
    "* method * @xmath8    the argus  @xcite and cleo  @xcite experiments have measured the quantity @xmath9 .",
    "moreover , under the assumptions that @xmath10 is dominated by @xmath11 , cleo  @xcite and argus  @xcite have been able to determine the branching ratio @xmath12 .",
    "thus , combining these above measurements one obtains  @xcite @xmath13 it is worth pointing out , as emphasised in  @xcite , that in order to derive @xmath14    * @xmath15 and @xmath16 production in @xmath17-decays , * @xmath18 like decay channels    have been neglected .",
    "* method * @xmath19    a different determination of @xmath20 is based on the independent measurements of @xcite @xmath21 and @xcite @xmath22 averaging over the results of the two experiments one obtains  @xcite @xmath23 then the branching ratio for @xmath24 can be obtained from the following relation @xmath25 where @xmath26 the ratio @xmath27 is obviously @xmath281 since there are non - vanishing contributions to the leading @xmath29 = @xmath30 from @xmath31 @xmath32 and @xmath33 which however are phase space suppressed .",
    "the analogous fraction for the meson @xmath34 has been measured by cleo  @xcite @xmath35 thus one can reasonably expect @xmath27 @xmath36 in any case , experiments might measure @xmath27 directly .",
    "+ theoretical estimates of @xmath37 are based on operator product expansion in the framework of the heavy quark effective theory  @xcite , where the amplitudes for @xmath38 and @xmath39 are predicted to have the same leading terms , while the @xmath401/@xmath41 corrections are found to be larger for @xmath42 . as a result @xmath43  @xcite .",
    "thus , if one uses for @xmath44 the value of eq.([rexpt ] ) and  @xcite for @xmath45 we obtain from eq .",
    "( [ equa1 ] ) @xmath46 ref .",
    "@xcite gives the weighted value of the two measurements @xmath47 , where also the theoretical uncertainty is included .",
    "however , it is also stressed that this number is rather arbitrary . indeed ref .",
    "@xcite advocates method @xmath48 suggesting that one should reanalyse the existing @xmath17 @xmath49 baryon sample to look for @xmath18 decay channels . as a result , if this interpretation is correct , then :    1 .",
    "heavy baryon tables would change ; 2 .",
    "measured charm counting in @xmath50-decay would decrease ; 3 .",
    "@xmath17 @xmath49 baryon decay models should be reanalysed .",
    "the simplest exclusive charm - production reaction is the quasi - elastic process where a @xmath51valence quark is changed into a @xmath52quark , thus transforming the target nucleon into a charmed baryon .",
    "explicitly the quasi - elastic reactions are @xmath53 @xmath54 @xmath55 @xmath56 @xmath57 in literature there are two classes of models which try to describe the processes ( [ rea1])-([rea5 ] ) . the first class @xcite-@xcite is based on the @xmath58 flavour symmetry , but since @xmath58 is badly broken , the parameters ( axial and vectorial mass ) entering the cross - section formula can not be reliably predicted . + a different approach @xcite is based on the bloom - gilman  @xcite local duality in @xmath59 scattering modified on the basis of qcd  @xcite .",
    "+ the cross - sections predicted by the different models , assuming a neutrino energy of @xmath60 , are shown in table  [ tab : crosspred ] .",
    "as we can see , these predictions can even differ by one order of magnitude . from fig . 3 in refs . @xcite and",
    "@xcite we note that the total cross - section in both models is almost flat for a neutrino energy larger than @xmath61 .",

    "[ fi : topo ] . starting from a sample of about of 500000",
    "charged - current events , it is estimated that @xmath62 events will be analysed in the emulsions  @xcite . assuming a 50% efficiency to detect the @xmath0 decay and taking into account that @xmath63 , a statistics of @xmath64 quasi - elastic events can be expected . due to",
    "the good muon identification of the electronic detector and the emulsion capability in identifying electrons , chorus is well suited to study @xmath0 semi - leptonic decays . assuming 100% error on @xmath65 and the pdg central value @xcite , the following accuracy could be achieved : @xmath66    @xmath67    a measurement with higher sensitivity could be performed exposing a dedicated detector , whose feasibility study has not yet been worked out , at the future neutrino beams from muon storage rings  @xcite .",
    "such beams could provide @xmath68 @xmath69 in a @xmath70 fiducial mass detector , @xmath71 away from the neutrino source , allowing for a strong reduction of the statistical uncertainty on the @xmath72 branching ratios , see table  [ tab : brscena2 ] .",
    "we have presented a new method for a direct evaluation of the @xmath0 branching ratios . we have also stressed that this has very interesting consequences for our understanding of baryon production in charm decays . even just a good determination of the @xmath3 semi - leptonic exclusive decay widths would be sufficient : indeed from eq.([rexpt ] ) we would determine @xmath73 , very important phenomenologically as pointed out particularly in section  [ model ] .",
    "we have also shown that , already with existing data , it should be possible to perform a direct measurement of @xmath3 exclusive decay widths , which is lacking to date .    99 particle data group , euro .",
