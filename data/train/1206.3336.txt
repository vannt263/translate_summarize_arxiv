    "the issue of thermalization of the quark - gluon matter produced in heavy ion collisions is one of the most challenging problems in this field . on the one hand , this matter appears to behave like a nearly perfect fluid , as is suggested by the comparison between flow measurements at rhic @xcite and hydrodynamical models with low shear viscosity @xcite .",
    "moreover , this comparison seems to call for a very early onset ( @xmath0fm / c ) of the hydrodynamical behavior .",
    "such a good description by hydrodynamics is usually interpreted as an indication that the system is fairly close to local thermal equilibrium . on the other hand , trying to justify this fast equilibration from first principles has proven to be notoriously difficult and no definitive conclusion has been reached thus far .",
    "early estimates of the thermalization time based on a standard kinetic description ( with @xmath1 and @xmath2 processes ) , as in the bottom - up scenario @xcite , lead to equilibration times that are much larger than what hydrodynamics seems to require .",
    "in addition to kinetic scattering processes , quarks and gluons with an anisotropic particle distribution are subject to weibel instabilities @xcite that are well known in qed plasmas .",
    "these potentially play a significant role in restoring isotropy and in thermalizing the system .",
    "a formal description of weibel instabilities can be couched in the framework of hard thermal loop effective field theory where the hard particles coexist with soft fields @xcite .",
    "this approach has been applied to study the evolution of such anisotropic systems , and the role of instabilities in their relaxation towards equilibrium , in a series of mostly numerical works @xcite . for recent analytical parametric estimates of the effect of weibel instabilities in the expanding systems produced in heavy ion collisions ,",
    "see refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "another feature of heavy ion collisions that complicates our understanding of thermalization is the fact that , at such early times , the collision is more appropriately described in terms of fields rather than on - shell particles .",
    "such a description arises naturally in the color glass condensate ( cgc ) effective theory . in this approach @xcite ,",
    "the nuclei are described in terms of highly boosted color sources coupled to soft gauge fields . at the very high energies reached at rhic and lhc , the density of color sources becomes so large that their currents are inversely proportional to the ( assumed to be small ) coupling constant . in this framework",
    ", one can systematically arrange the various contributions to a computation of inclusive quantities in powers of the strong fine structure constant @xmath3 with a given order in @xmath3 corresponding to a fixed loop order .",
    "the leading order ( lo ) approximation can be expressed entirely in terms of the classical solution of the yang - mills equations , the next - to - leading ( nlo ) order is composed of the 1-loop graphs in the presence of a classical background field , and so on .",
    "a very satisfying aspect of this description is that the color source distribution of the projectiles appears only via universal weight functionals of these distributions .",
    "factorization theorems have been proven that demonstrate ( to leading accuracy in powers of @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the rapidity ) that these weight functionals are the same for all inclusive observables and for different reactions involving identical projectiles @xcite .",
    "the evolution of these weight functionals with rapidity is described by the jimwlk equation@xcite .    in the cgc framework ,",
    "the weibel instabilities manifest themselves in the form of unstable solutions of the classical yang - mills equations @xcite , that lead to secular divergences in the nlo correction to quantities such as the pressure : these corrections diverge when the time goes to infinity . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we sketched an improvement that resums , at each order of the expansion in @xmath3 , the terms that have the fastest growth in time .",
    "this resummation scheme , which amounts in practice to averaging classical solutions of the field equations of motion over a gaussian ensemble of initial conditions , was justified more extensively in @xcite . moreover , the precise form of the initial gaussian ensemble of gauge fields was also derived in this work .",
    "since the numerical implementation of this resummation in qcd is computationally very demanding , we first considered a much simpler field theory in @xcite , a scalar field theory with a quartic @xmath6 coupling .",
    "similar issues arise in this simpler context and provide one with a feeling for the effect of instabilities on the evolution of the system towards equilibrium .",
    "the scalar theory , like qcd , is scale invariant at the classical level in @xmath7 dimensions , up to small corrections . ] .",
    "more importantly , this theory is known to have unstable classical solutions because of parametric resonance ( see refs .",
    "although the microscopic nature of these instabilities is very different from the weibel instabilities encountered in yang - mills theory , they also lead to secular divergences in the pressure at nlo .",
    "therefore , as in the latter , a resummation of the divergent contributions at each order is essential to obtain finite results at late times .    in refs .",
    "@xcite , a resummation identical to the one advocated in @xcite for qcd was applied to this scalar theory and implemented in a numerical lattice computation .",
    "these simulations showed that the pressure quickly relaxes to the value required by the equilibrium equation of state ( @xmath8 ) . on longer timescales",
    ", the particle distribution evolves to a classical equilibrium distribution .",
    "moreover we found that when the system is initialized with an excess of particle number ( compared to the equilibrium value at a given energy ) , then a transient chemical potential appears , and even a bose - einstein condensate if the particle number excess is too large ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite ) .    in the two papers already mentioned exploring non - equilibrium scalar dynamics , only systems contained in a fixed volume box were considered .",
    "the isotropization of the pressure tensor was therefore not relevant . to address this issue",
    ", we shall extend here our study of scalar @xmath6 field theory to a system that expands longitudinally .",
    "in this case , one expects naively that the longitudinal expansion produces a red - shifting of the longitudinal momenta thereby leading to a small longitudinal pressure that decreases faster than the transverse one .",
    "if this conclusion was right , hydrodynamics would not be applicable to the description of such an expanding system .",
    "the main question we want to address with this extension is whether the instabilities can keep the longitudinal pressure close to the transverse one , despite the longitudinal expansion .",
    "a study of these instabilities for an expanding system has been presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , but the main focus of this work was not on isotropization .",
    "we will mimic closely , in this scalar theory framework , the color glass condensate description of high energy heavy ion collisions by assuming that the classical background field is independent of rapidity .",
    "the fluctuations that are superposed on this classical field at the initial time are the scalar analogues of the spectrum derived for qcd in @xcite .",
    "the derivation of this spectrum in the much simpler scalar case is done in section [ sec : specfluc ] . in the section [ sec : lattice ]",
    ", we discuss the lattice discretization of the model .",
    "the time evolution of the particle distribution is studied in the section [ sec : occupnumber ] .",
    "this discussion also shows why it is important to have a very small lattice spacing in the rapidity direction .",
    "the time evolution of the transverse and longitudinal pressures is studied in the section [ sec : enertensor ] .",
    "we conclude that the instabilities are indeed able to make the longitudinal pressure nearly equal to the transverse one . in the section [ sec : hydro ]",
    ", we compare the results obtained here in classical statistical field theory with expectations from viscous hydrodynamics .",
    "section [ sec : conclusion ] is devoted to conclusions and to an outlook into the application of this approach to qcd . some technical notes and",
    "complements are relegated to three appendices .",
    "following refs .",
    "@xcite , we consider a massless real scalar field theory with a quartic coupling , whose lagrangian density is given by @xmath9 the kinematics of a high energy nuclear collision is mirrored by picking a preferred spatial direction ",
    "the @xmath10 direction in this paper  to be the collision axis . for collisions in the high energy limit , the problem is invariant under finite lorentz boosts in this direction .",
    "a natural system of coordinates in which this invariance takes a simple form are the proper time @xmath11 and the rapidity @xmath12 coordinates that are related to the usual cartesian coordinates by the transformations @xmath13 with the transverse coordinates @xmath14 and @xmath15 unchanged . in this coordinate system ,",
    "the dalembertian reads @xmath16 longitudinal boosts preserve @xmath11 and @xmath17 , and shift the rapidity by a constant .",
    "thus , the invariance under longitudinal boosts implies that physical quantities are independent of the rapidity @xmath12 .      in the cgc description of heavy ion collisions ,",
    "the leading order approximation is given by the retarded classical solution of the yang - mills equations . in subsequent orders",
    ", this classical field plays the role of a background field whereby all the propagators and vertices are dressed .",
    "this classical background field is boost invariant .",
    "thus , in our scalar analog , we will require the background field to be independent of @xmath12 .",
    "the classical equation of motion for such a field @xmath18 is @xmath19 where the dot denotes a derivative with respect to the proper time @xmath11 .",
    "note that we only consider here the evolution of the system after the collision ( for @xmath20 ) .",
    "because the sources that describe the colliding projectiles have support only on the axis @xmath21 , the field evolution is not driven by these sources ; instead , they provide initial conditions for the field at @xmath22 .    to ascertain the nature of the initial conditions at @xmath22 ,",
    "let us neglect for the time being the interaction term @xmath23 and decompose the @xmath17 dependence of the field in fourier modes as @xmath24 the fourier coefficients obey the equation @xmath25 this is a bessel equation of index @xmath26 and its general solution is of the form @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are constants .",
    "only the term that contains @xmath30 can smoothly approach the limit @xmath31 .",
    "( if we keep the @xmath32 term , the field would diverge as @xmath33 and its derivative as @xmath34 in this limit . )",
    "therefore the solutions that are regular near the origin are of the form , @xmath35 where the @xmath28 coefficients are just the fourier transform of the field at @xmath36 @xmath37 note that its derivative tends to zero at the origin , @xmath38    the interaction term @xmath23 that we neglected in this discussion introduces some mixing among the fourier modes and modifies the evolution of the solution .",
    "however this modification is negligible at short times because the evolution of the field at very short times is dominated by the _ expansion rate _ which is much larger than the _ interaction rate_. therefore the solution that we find by neglecting the interaction term remains valid in the immediate vicinity of the origin this approximation is valid depends on the magnitude of the field and of the coupling constant @xmath39 , both of which determine the strength of the neglected non - linear terms . ] .",
    "we want now to perform for this scalar model the resummation described in ref .",
    "@xcite for the qcd case .",
    "this resummation amounts to allowing the initial condition for the classical field to fluctuate and to average observables over these fluctuations .",

    "( [ eq : fluct1 ] ) is precisely what is needed to achieve this .    in figure",

    "one can see that , for the times that are common to the two evolutions , these physical quantities do not depend on the time at which the system is initialized .",

    "this statement is true only as long as the initial time @xmath84 is small compared to the physical time scales in the problem ( for example , the period of the oscillations of the pressure in the fig .",

    "note also that the classical background @xmath18 itself in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fluct1 ] ) evolves from @xmath84 to @xmath121 , although this is a small effect if both initial times are small .",
    "a crucial aspect of dynamics in this theory is the presence of unstable modes that are amplified by parametric resonance ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite for a discussion of this question ) .",
    "we saw in @xcite that the resonance band for a constant volume is fixed and that its boundaries are proportional to the amplitude of the background classical field .",
    "the situation becomes more complicated when the system is free to expand in the @xmath10 direction .    for simplicity ,",
    "let us assume that the background field @xmath18 is spatially homogeneous .",
    "the linearized equation of motion for a small fluctuation of wave numbers @xmath106 and @xmath122 propagating over this background reads @xmath123 when the background field is not present ( @xmath124 ) , the solutions of this equation are the bessel functions @xmath125 and @xmath126 . at late times , they oscillate with an amplitude that decreases like @xmath127 .",
    "when @xmath128 , one can check ( numerically ) at any given time whether the fluctuation of wavenumbers @xmath129 has the expected magnitude , namely , if they were decreasing at the pace of the above bessel functions , or if they are larger than expected .",

    "this fact is easy to understand semi - quantitatively from what we know about the resonance in the fixed volume case .",
    "there the resonant modes form a narrow band @xmath131 where @xmath132 are two numbers proportional to the amplitude squared of the background field .",
    "the resonance occurs due to a special tuning between the `` effective mass '' @xmath133 of a mode and its coupling to the oscillating background field . in the expanding case ,",
    "it is the combination @xmath130 that plays the role of a mass term for the mode . for large times",
    "such that the variations of @xmath134 are slow compared to the oscillations of the background field we can justly transpose to this case the resonance condition obtained in the non - expanding case .",
    "we then get the resonance condition , @xmath135 these inequalities define a domain that has the shape of a narrow corona in the @xmath136 plane .",
    "the main effect of the expansion is that this corona expands with time , starting very close to the @xmath137 axis and progressively moving towards larger values of @xmath106 .",
    "therefore the modes that are unstable are not the same at all times .",
    "moreover , a given @xmath129 mode can only be resonant during a finite amount of time while the resonance band is sweeping through it . during this time",
    ", it is amplified by some possibly large but always finite factor .    from this discussion",
    "it is easy to understand fig .",
    "[ fig : reso ] .",
    "the shaded areas represent all the modes that have been resonant at some point between the initial time and the time @xmath11 of interest .",
    "this domain is the addition of the locations of the resonance band for all the times up to @xmath11 . in this interpretation",
    ", the boundary of the domain ( of equation @xmath138 ) corresponds to the modes that are just starting to become resonant at the time @xmath11 .",
    "note that the modes that become resonant at late times are not amplified as strongly as those that resonate early : indeed , as known already for a fixed box , the lyapunov exponent is proportional to the amplitude of the background field  which in this case decreases with time .",

    "however , for hydrodynamics to be applicable , the anisotropy of the pressure tensor should not be large .",
    "it is therefore of the utmost importance to determine whether the longitudinal and transverse pressures ever approach each other for the expanding system .    in the @xmath139 system of coordinates ,",
    "the diagonal components of the energy - momentum tensor are given by @xmath177 the transverse pressure is @xmath178 and the longitudinal pressure is @xmath179 .",
    "all these quantities , written here for a single classical field configuration , must of course be averaged over the gaussian ensemble of initial conditions derived in section [ sec : specfluc ] .    when computing the energy momentum tensor , it is important to do so on a lattice that has a fine enough spacing in the rapidity direction , as explained in the previous section .",
    "the artifacts one obtains at large time if this is not the case are illustrated and discussed in the appendix [ sec : artifacts ] . in the rest of this section ,",
    "all the numerical results have been obtained on a @xmath180 lattice .",
    "it is also important to subtract the contribution of the vacuum .",
    "indeed , our resummation leads to severe ultraviolet divergences in the energy - momentum tensor that behave generically like the fourth power of the ultraviolet cutoff ( here , the inverse lattice spacing ) .",
    "this unwanted term is a pure vacuum contribution and it can be removed by subtracting the result from another computation in which the background field @xmath18 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fluct1 ] ) is set to zero ( `` vacuum '' ) . in all the quantities",
    "presented later on , this subtraction has been performed .",
    "the first thing to assess is whether the system obeys an equation of state . towards that end ,",
    "we plot in the figure [ fig : evol2 ] the energy density and the sum of the three pressures .    as in a system with a fixed volume ( see @xcite ) , the pressure oscillates rapidly initially , with the oscillations being damped and disappearing eventually .",
    "when this happens , one sees that @xmath181 within statistical errors .",
    "if one recalls the conservation equation ( see for instance the figure [ fig : checktau ] ) , the longitudinal pressure must be negative and equal to @xmath182 at @xmath22 .",
    "this is indeed the case but not obvious from the figures , where we plot the absolute value of the pressures . ]",
    "that drives the time evolution of the energy density , @xmath183 it is also instructive to compare the time dependence of the energy density with two power laws that have a special physical meaning :    * @xmath184 , expected for a system whose longitudinal pressure is negligible , * @xmath185 , expected when @xmath186 .",
    "as one can see , at the beginning of the evolution , the energy density decreases approximately like @xmath184 , while it is well fitted by @xmath185 at later times .",
    "this is suggestive of the fact that the system is initially highly anisotropic , and then becomes nearly isotropic later on .",
    "given the above results on the time dependence of the energy density , let us now look at the evolution of the transverse and longitudinal pressures separately .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ fig : evolp ] .",
    "( we also plot the energy density and the sum of the three pressures in order to compare the timescales for the relaxation of the pressures and for isotropization . ) in this plot , one can distinguish three stages in the time evolution of the pressures :    * at early times ( on timescales comparable to that of the relaxation of the pressure or shorter ) , one sees that the magnitude of the longitudinal pressure drops very quickly .",
    "when well defined quasiparticles can be identified in the spectrum of the theory , this can be understood from the kinetic theory formula for the longitudinal pressure @xmath187 as a consequence of the red - shifting of the longitudinal momenta due to the expansion of the system .",
    "indeed , particles with a non - zero @xmath188 eventually escape from the unit slice of rapidity whose evolution we are considering .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ fig : expansion ] .",
    "+ at early times , the system we are considering is arguably not amenable to a description in terms of quasiparticles .",
    "however , the above argument about redshifting applies equally to the longitudinal pressure of a system of fields , and implies a rapid decrease of its magnitude .",
    "* next , a dramatic change of behavior occurs .",
    "the longitudinal pressure increases rapidly and approaches the transverse pressure .",
    "this change begins when the oscillations of the pressure have become small .",
    "moreover , from figure [ fig : fk320 ] , we see that this occurs when the particle distribution starts to expand and occupy modes in the @xmath106 direction .",
    "* eventually , the longitudinal pressure becomes very close to the transverse one , albeit at times much later than the relaxation of the pressure .",
    "this confirms what was guessed on the basis of the time dependence of the energy density alone .",
    "the difference between the transverse and longitudinal pressures essentially arises from the sign with which the various spatial gradients of the field enter in the formulas ( [ eq : pressures ] ) .",
    "in particular , it easy to see from these formulas that the two pressures are equal provided that @xmath189 in order to better understand the evolution of the two pressures , we have represented in figure [ fig : evol ] the expectation values of the two quantities @xmath190 and @xmath191 .",
    "note that these quantities have been vacuum - subtracted , as explained after eq .",
    "( [ eq : pressures ] ) , which means that they are not necessarily positive .",
    "negative values are indicated in the plot by a dotted line instead of a solid one .    at very early times , the transverse gradient is moderately small and positive , while the longitudinal gradient is large and negative ( after we have subtracted the contribution from the vacuum ) . up to @xmath192 ,",
    "the transverse gradient remains roughly constant ( more precisely , it oscillates around a constant value ) , while the magnitude of the longitudinal gradient decreases very rapidly .",
    "( note that since it is negative , this means that it is in fact increasing with time . )    for a short period of time after @xmath192 , the transverse gradient increases mildly . from the plots showing the evolution of the occupation number in the figure [ fig : fk320 ] ,",
    "this is clearly related to the expansion of the particle distribution in @xmath122 . during this period ,",
    "the transverse gradient is much larger than the longitudinal one ( which is still negative ) , and therefore the longitudinal pressure is much smaller than the transverse one .",
    "a qualitative change in behavior occurs around @xmath193 : the longitudinal gradient evolves faster than the transverse one and it increases rapidly , approaching zero to become positive shortly after @xmath194 . the consequence on the longitudinal pressure is a rapid increase despite the expansion of the system .",
    "microscopically the increase of the longitudinal gradients is presumably due to the resonance that can reshuffle efficiently momenta now that the expansion rate of the system is lower .",
    "( before that point , any particle that was scattered at a non - zero @xmath188 immediately escaped from the rapidity slice under consideration . )",
    "this trend continues until the transverse and longitudinal gradients become comparable , at which point the two pressures are nearly equal .    in appendix",
    "[ app : iso ] , we study how the isotropization timescale varies when we change the amplitude of the background field and the coupling strength ; our results show that isotropization is faster for larger fields and/or larger couplings .",
    "the previous results indicate that the trace of the pressure tensor relaxes to its equilibrium value .",
    "subsequently , the longitudinal pressure approaches the transverse one and the system becomes isotropic despite the continuing longitudinal expansion . a natural question to ask",
    "is whether the details of this time evolution are compatible with hydrodynamics .",
    "of course it does not make sense to try answering this question before the time at which the pressures become well defined , namely , before the pressure oscillations have disappeared .",
    "further , it is clear that to map our pressures onto hydrodynamics , a minimal requirement is to include a shear viscosity that will allow the pressure tensor to be anisotropic . given the geometry of our setup , it is sufficient to consider boost invariant hydrodynamics . also , since our problem is translationally invariant in the transverse directions , we can set the transverse fluid velocity to zero .      in this situation , the time evolution of the energy density is related to the longitudinal pressure , @xmath195 a first consistency check that we can make is to verify that this equation holds from our numerical results .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : depsilon ] , where one clearly sees that this equation is satisfied .",
    "this should of course not be a surprise because the equation comes directly from the conservation of energy and momentum and should be satisfied regardless of whether hydrodynamics applies or not .",
    "the previous check was merely a verification that our numerical approach fulfills basic conservation laws . in order to go further ,",
    "let us recall that in first order viscous bjorken hydrodynamics the longitudinal and transverse pressures would be given by @xmath196 where @xmath12 is the shear viscosity .",
    "this ansatz assumes that we are already in the regime where @xmath197 , and attributes the difference between the two pressures to the effect of the shear .",
    "first of all , we can compare the time evolution of the pressure anisotropy , @xmath198 , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dp ] , with what one would expect in a hydrodynamical expansion .    from the time where the oscillations of the pressures have died out to the time where this anisotropy has become very small ,",
    "it can be fitted by an exponential form @xmath199 . at later times , the quality of the fit can be improved slightly by adding a term in @xmath200 .",
    "( note that at times greater than @xmath201 , the anisotropy rises again due to lattice artifacts . )",
    "if the decrease of the anisotropy was driven by viscous hydrodynamics , one would expect its behavior to be a power law @xmath200 , not an exponential .",
    "although it is not easy to pinpoint what precisely is causing this exponential falloff of the anisotropy , it seems very plausible that the presence of instabilities in the microscopic dynamics of the system is responsible .",
    "one may argue that the hydrodynamical regime only starts when the power law term in @xmath200 becomes important  roughly after @xmath202 lattice spacings",
    ". then one could turn the coefficient @xmath203 of the @xmath200 term into a value of the ratio @xmath204 .",

    "( [ eq : visco1 ] ) , where we attributed to the viscosity only the power law term in the difference @xmath212 , we now define this effective viscosity from the full difference , including also the exponential term .",
    "this effective ratio can be computed at each time , and is shown in the figure [ fig : visco ] .",
    "the first thing one sees is that it is not constant , which certainly means that there are discrepancies with hydrodynamics .",
    "the value of this ratio before @xmath213 probably does not make much sense , because the pressures are oscillating before this time .",
    "after that , the ratio starts near a value of @xmath214 and decreases rapidly to reach a value of about @xmath215 .",
    "in addition to the non - constancy of this ratio , it should be noted that its value is quite small compared to the perturbative value . for a real scalar field theory with a @xmath216 coupling ,",
    "the lowest order perturbative result  @xcite is roughly @xmath217 given that @xmath157 in our simulation , one would expect @xmath218 , which is much larger than the effective ratio we observe .",
    "in other words , the system of fields we have studied is a much better fluid than one would expect on the basis of the perturbative estimates of the viscosity to entropy density ratio .",
    "this anomalously small value of the @xmath204 ratio is perhaps related to the phenomenon discussed in @xcite where it is argued that , in systems subject to turbulent unstable fields , momentum transport may occur as if the viscosity were much smaller than naive estimates from transport cross - sections .    to carry the comparison of our simulations with hydrodynamics even further",
    ", we must solve the hydrodynamic equations ; using eq .",
    "( [ eq : s ] ) , the evolution of @xmath210 in viscous hydrodynamics has the closed form @xmath219 comparisons between the two frameworks can be performed as follows :    * choose an initial time @xmath84 , where hydrodynamics is initiated .",
    "this time should be well after the oscillations in the pressures have disappeared .",
    "* initialize the energy density so that it has the same value in the two frameworks at @xmath84 . *",
    "set the value of the ratio @xmath204 in order to have the right values for the transverse and longitudinal pressures at @xmath84 .",
    "this is always possible if @xmath84 is in the region where @xmath220 . *",
    "solve ( numerically ) the differential equation ( [ eq : hydro2 ] ) from these initial conditions and compare with the evolution one obtains in classical statistical field theory .",
    "the result of this comparison is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hcomp ] , for three values of the initial time @xmath84 for hydrodynamics .",
    "the main lesson from this figure is that the pressure tensor isotropizes much faster in classical statistical field theory than it does in hydrodynamics .",
    "hydrodynamics begun at earlier times can not compete and thus flow and viscosity bounds derived from such exercises are suspect .    the last pair of hydro curves , with an initial time @xmath221 , remains close to the true evolution , but this is only because it _ starts _ with an already small amount of anisotropy .",
    "therefore , for hydrodynamics to describe accurately the evolution , hydrodynamical evolution should be initiated at a time where the pressure tensor is already close to isotropy .",
    "our comparison is based on first order viscous hydrodynamics only .",
    "arguably , viscous corrections are large in the system when @xmath222 and @xmath223 differ substantially and it is unclear whether first order hydrodynamics is a valid approximation .",
    "we close this section with a generic comment about the isotropization time .",
    "the precise value of the time we obtain in this model of scalar fields is of little relevance for the analogous question in qcd because the two theories are quite different in many respects .",
    "however , we expect the conclusion that the true isotropization time is considerably shorter than the time one would infer from hydrodynamics ( or equivalently from a boltzmann equation ) is quite generic in theories with instabilities .",
    "the other lesson from this comparison is that such systems may have an effective viscosity to entropy density ratio which is much smaller than what one expects from perturbation theory .",
    "therefore one could have nearly ideal fluid behavior without invoking strong coupling .",
    "moreover , we know from @xcite that full thermalization of this system takes much longer than the times considered here .",
    "we may conclude that full thermalization is not necessary for a hydrodynamical description ; only near isotropy is important .",
    "this work extends our previous study of the role of quantum fluctuations on the thermalization of strong fields ( subject to instabilities ) to the situation where the system undergoes longitudinal expansion .",
    "we considered a one - component scalar field theory , which is much simpler to study numerically than yang - mills theory , and implemented the same resummation program that one would employ in studying the early stages of heavy ion collisions in the color glass condensate framework .",
    "as in the case of a system confined to a fixed box , the trace of the pressure tensor exhibits rapid temporal oscillations that are quickly damped via the phenomenon of phase decoherence .",
    "following this state we find that the sum of the three pressures become equal to the energy density ( a well - define equation of state exists ) , but the transverse and longitudinal pressures remain different until full isotropization at an even later time .",
    "the main new result of this study is that the pressure tensor eventually becomes isotropic despite the longitudinal expansion of the system .",
    "after an initial decrease due to the rapid expansion at early times , the longitudinal pressure increases at later times to reach a value that is very close to that of the transverse pressure .",
    "this goes a long way towards justifying the validity of the hydrodynamical description for expanding systems , as encountered in heavy ion collisions .",
    "we also studied the time evolution of the particle distribution .",
    "even with a very far from equilibrium initial condition that has a single @xmath122 mode at @xmath22 , a continuum of modes rapidly get filled by the nonlinear interactions of the fields .",
    "this study of the occupation number highlights an important limitation of numerical simulations that use rapidity as the longitudinal coordinate , namely , the particle distribution expands in @xmath106 the conjugate momentum of rapidity over time and eventually reaches the ultraviolet cutoff imposed on this variable by the lattice spacing .",
    "therefore in order to pursue the study until sufficiently large times without being affected by these lattice artifacts , it is necessary to use a lattice that has a very fine mesh in the rapidity direction .",
    "this issue is by no means specific to a scalar theory , and will be present when this approach is applied to yang - mills theory .    in all the plots presented in this paper ,",
    "all dimensionful quantities were expressed in units of the appropriate power of the transverse lattice spacing .",
    "since the @xmath6 scalar theory in @xmath7 dimensions is scale invariant at the classical level ( as is yang - mills theory ) , one can re - express all of them in terms of a single dimensionful physical parameter . in the color glass condensate framework , this parameter would be the saturation momentum @xmath224 of the colliding nuclei . doing this for qcd would provide an answer to the following fundamental question : _ how long does isotropization take , given the value of the saturation momentum and of the strong coupling constant ?",
    "_ however , the lessons of this exercise in scalar field theory can not be simply applied to the gauge theory case because the former differs from qcd in a number of crucial ways . to list a few ,",
    "( i ) the field content of qcd is much richer , ( ii ) there is no meaningful way to compare the coupling constants of the two theories , ( iii ) the strength of their instabilities are quite different , both in their range and in their growth rate .",
    "thus it is best to see the present work as a proof of the concept that instabilities can isotropize the pressures of an expanding system .",
    "the next step obviously is to apply the same treatment to yang - mills theory . in a previous work @xcite",
    ", we derived the spectrum of initial field fluctuations that one must use in this computation .",
    "the numerical implementation of this approach to a yang - mills theory is under way but will require a significantly larger computational effort than what was needed for the present scalar theory .",

    "as we have already explained in section [ sec : fk - evol ] , the time extent of the simulation is limited by the finite size of the lattice .",
    "we demonstrated that as the time increases the particle distribution expands to larger @xmath106 values , ( @xmath106 is the momentum conjugate to rapidity ) , until it is artificially cut - off by the discretization in rapidity .    in figure",
    "[ fig : anis ] , we show the practical significance of this effect on the numerical computation of the components of the energy - momentum tensor , for lattices with increasing number of longitudinal spacings @xmath92 ( all describing a unit slice of rapidity ) .",
    "we see that when the number of lattice spacings in the rapidity direction is small ( see the curves for the @xmath225 lattice ) , the ratio @xmath226 approaches the isotropic value @xmath227 and then departs from this value . likewise , the ratio @xmath228 approaches @xmath227 from above , before deviating from this value ( in such a way that @xmath229 remains equal to @xmath210 ) .",
    "the time at which this occurs agrees with the time when the particle distribution reaches the longitudinal momentum cutoff as shown in table  [ tb : tmax ] .",
    "figure [ fig : anis ] demonstrates that this artifact appears at later times as the number of lattice spacings in rapidity is increased .    the additional complication of renormalization",
    "must also be considered when simulating scalar fields on a lattice .",
    "while there is no mass term in our bare lagrangian , vacuum fluctuations induce a non  zero mass . in a scalar @xmath6 theory ,",
    "the leading contribution stems from the tadpole graph having a quadratic uv divergence .",
    "the value of this tadpole is given as @xmath230 which clearly exhibits the nature of its divergence .",
    "on the lattice the above integral is replaced by a discrete sum having a uv cutoff dictated by the size of the lattice spacing . in @xmath11@xmath12",

    "figure [ fig : mass ] shows the time evolution of @xmath232 for various discretizations in rapidity . at intermediate times",
    "the mass has a logarithmic sensitivity to the lattice spacing .    in practice",
    "this means that computations done with the same bare lagrangian but having different longitudinal discretizations correspond to different renormalized theories .",
    "the logarithmic dependence of this mass with @xmath92 means that it varies more rapidly at small @xmath92 than at large @xmath92 , something that can be seen in the figure [ fig : anis ] by comparing the changes from @xmath233 to @xmath234 and from @xmath234 to @xmath235 . in the present work ,",
    "we have not attempted to renormalize the bare parameters as this will be further complicated by the fact that we are treating the transverse and longitudinal coordinates on different footings .",
    "therefore , one should keep in mind that the theory for which results are presented in the paper is not a truly massless theory , and the comparison between computations done at varying lattice spacings can only be made qualitatively .",
    "we should stress that this issue should not arise in gauge theories . in this case",
    ", the gauge invariance of the wilson action prevents the generation of a mass term for the gluons .",
    "a natural question that arises is whether the isotropization that we have observed is a generic phenomenon that occurs for all choices of coupling strengths and background fields .",
    "the scale invariance ( at the classical level ) of the theory we are studying suggests that it should be generic for all background fields since a larger background field can be hidden in a rescaling of the time and spatial coordinates .",
    "due to the limitations inherent to the lattice setup , we can only vary the background field in a limited window ; nevertheless , we have indeed observed numerically that isotropization occurs regardless of the amplitude of the background field .",
    "this is shown in the figure [ fig : phi0dep ] , where the time dependence of @xmath198 is represented for uniform background fields of amplitudes @xmath237 .",
    "moreover , we see that the isotropization time decreases if @xmath54 increases .",
    "this decrease is expected because all time scales should be inversely proportional to the field amplitudes .",
    "note that there are important lattice artifacts for the smallest value of @xmath54 that are visible in the very small change of the isotropization curve when going from @xmath158 to @xmath238 . in this regime of smaller fields , the tadpole mass  due to",
    "the vacuum fluctuations that we have not renormalized  seems to dominate the dynamics .",
    "this is a lattice issue related to the breaking of the scale invariance by lattice cutoffs of the theory we are simulating .",
    "less obvious is the question of what happens when varying the coupling .",
    "we do expect the isotropization time to decrease if we increase the coupling ; however , there could be some critical coupling below which isotropization never occurs .",
    "what we observe numerically over the range of couplings explored ( limited by the lattice configurations ) is that isotropization is faster at larger coupling strengths , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : g2dep ] .",
    "in the computation of the initial conditions ( eq .  ( [ eq : fluct1 ] ) ) and of the occupation number ( eq .  ( [ eq : fk ] ) ) , we need hankel functions of imaginary index @xmath75 . they are both needed at small arguments ( for the initial conditions ) , and at fairly large arguments ( for the occupation number ) .",
    "and we need them for very large indices @xmath106 , since on a lattice with @xmath92 spacings in a unit rapidity interval , the maximal value of @xmath106 is @xmath239 .",

    "<S> our primary objective was to understand how such a system , when initialized with a non - perturbatively large classical field configuration , reaches thermal equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> an essential goal of these works was to highlight the role played by the quantum fluctuations .    </S>",
    "<S> however , these studies considered only a system confined within a box of fixed volume . in the present paper , we extend this work to a system that expands in the longitudinal direction thereby more closely mimicking a heavy ion collision . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the microscopic processes that drive the system towards equilibrium are able to keep up with the expansion of the system ; the pressure tensor becomes isotropic despite the anisotropic expansion .    </S>",
