    "<S> it is shown how a chiral lagrangian framework can be used to derive relationships connecting quark - level qcd correlation functions to mesonic - level two - point functions . </S>",
    "<S> crucial ingredients of this connection are scale factor matrices relating each distinct quark - level substructure ( e.g. , quark - antiquark , four - quark ) to its mesonic counterpart . </S>",
    "<S> the scale factors and mixing angles are combined into a projection matrix to obtain the physical ( hadronic ) projection of the qcd correlation function matrix . </S>",
    "<S> such relationships provide a powerful bridge between chiral lagrangians and qcd sum - rules that are particularly effective in studies of the substructure of light scalar mesons with multiple complicated resonance shapes and substantial underlying mixings . </S>",
    "<S> the validity of these connections is demonstrated for the example of the isotriplet @xmath0-@xmath1 system , resulting in an unambiguous determination of the scale factors from the combined inputs of qcd sum - rules and chiral lagrangians . </S>",
    "<S> these scale factors lead to a remarkable agreement between the quark condensates in qcd and the mesonic vacuum expectation values that induce spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in chiral lagrangians . </S>",
    "<S> this concrete example shows a clear sensitivity to the underlying @xmath2-system mixing angle , illustrating the value of this methodology in extensions to more complicated mesonic systems .    </S>",
    "<S> scalars are the higgs bosons of qcd and induce spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking and their internal structure holds key information about nonperturbative qcd . </S>",
    "<S> however , understanding the light scalar sector of qcd has turned out to be considerably more challenging than other sectors @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> particularly the investigation of the quark substructure of scalar mesons continues to pose various complications , mostly stemming from the underlying mixings among different quark and glue components . on the one hand , </S>",
    "<S> the experimental data on light scalars , which originate from various low - energy decays and scatterings , seems to be less certain than other better understood channels such as vectors or pseudoscalars , while on the other hand , the theoretical foundation for understanding scalars faces challenges within the quark model . </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical challenges include describing the light and inverted scalar mass spectrum below 1 gev , which finds a fundamental explanation in terms of four - quark states described by the mit bag model @xcite , as well as describing the existing deviations from a quark - antiquark substructure of scalar states above 1 gev , which finds a natural explanation in an underlying mixing among scalars below and above 1 gev @xcite ( other works on mixing include refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> qcd sum - rules also find evidence of an inverted spectrum for four - quark states @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> such mixing patterns and global relations are far from the focus of chiral perturbation theory @xcite which aims to probe the near - threshold region in a systematic way . </S>",
    "<S> those formulations of chiral lagrangians ( both linear @xcite as well as nonlinear models @xcite ) that explicitly include scalar resonances have been shown to be effective frameworks for understanding scalars . in this approach </S>",
    "<S> , the framework is developed on the basis of chiral symmetry , the mechanisms for its breakdown , and the model parameters are found from fits to the available experimental data on scalars below 2 gev . particularly , it is seen that the underlying mixing patterns among scalar states provides an indirect probe into their substructure @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the scalars below and above 1 gev have considerable mixings , with those below 1 gev being predominantly of four - quark nature whereas those above 1 gev being closer to quark - antiquarks . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , two of them , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , tend to acquire a substantial admixtures of glue @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> qcd sum - rules have also provided insight into these gluonic mixings ( see e.g. , @xcite and review of earlier results in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) , as well as other methods @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> while the probe of quark substructure of scalars in the chiral lagrangian approach is robust and coherent , it is indirect and limited . </S>",
    "<S> one of the limitations is the fact that the four - quark chiral nonet can be mapped to different quark compositions , each representing different flavor , spin and color configurations ( e.g. , `` molecular '' type , diquark - antidiquark type ) . since these different compositions transform in exactly the same way under chiral transformations , the chiral lagrangians become oblivious to differences in internal quark substructure of the four - quark chiral nonet . in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , as discussed below , it is shown that @xmath5 differentiates between two - quark and four - quark nonets , but not between different types of four - quark substructures . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore desirable to supplement these investigations with a method that directly probes the quark substructure </S>",
    "<S> . this limitation of chiral lagrangians can be in principle addressed by a linkage to qcd sum - rules .    </S>",
    "<S> conversely , qcd sum - rules can benefit from chiral lagrangians . </S>",
    "<S> qcd sum - rules exploit quark hadron duality and connect fundamental qcd to hadronic physics @xcite . for probing a light , broad and highly overlapping state , such as the sigma meson , </S>",
    "<S> a simple breit - wigner shape may not be a realistic parametrization . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , when there are complicated underlying mixings , a realistic modeling of the hadronic side in qcd sum - rules that includes the effects of such underlying mixing phenomena seems necessary . </S>",
    "<S> chiral lagrangians ( such as those of refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) where their model parameters have been fixed by various low - energy data can provide important information on both the resonance shapes and mixings .    </S>",
    "<S> the main purpose of this paper is to demonstrate how chiral lagrangians and qcd sum - rules can play complementary roles in forming a bridge that ultimately connects the relevant low - energy experimental data to fundamental qcd . </S>",
    "<S> key parts of this bridge are scale factor matrices relating each distinct quark - level substructure to its chiral lagrangian mesonic counterpart . </S>",
    "<S> the scale factors and mixing angles are combined into a projection matrix to obtain the physical ( hadronic ) projection of the qcd correlation function matrix . </S>",
    "<S> this bridge is therefore mutually beneficial : chiral lagrangians provide phenomenological information to guide qcd sum - rules , and qcd sum - rules can provide additional methodologies for distinguishing between different chiral lagrangian scenarios , deepening our understanding of the chiral lagrangian approach .    </S>",
    "<S> although this work is motivated by the scalar channel , it is extendable to other channels such as the pseudoscalar and vector channels . </S>",
    "<S> here , we use the generalized linear sigma model of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite to demonstrate how connections can be made with qcd sum - rules , but the method is more general and can be extended to nonlinear chiral lagrangians such as those in refs </S>",
    "<S> .  @xcite . also , our focus in this work is the relatively less - problematic @xmath6 channel that allows us to demonstrate the connection without complicating factors . </S>",
    "<S> we intend to extend the present work to nonlinear chiral lagrangians as well as other channels ( @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) in future works .    </S>",
    "<S> we begin by defining our notation . at the mesonic - level </S>",
    "<S> , we employ the generalized linear sigma model of refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite which is formulated in terms of two chiral nonets @xmath9 and @xmath10 that respectively represent a quark - antiquark nonet and a four - quark nonet ( a `` molecule '' type and/or a diquark - antidiquark type ) underlying substructure . </S>",
    "<S> both chiral nonets transform in the same way under chiral transformations but differently under u(1)@xmath11 : @xmath12 the axial charge is the main tool for distinguishing these two nonets . each of these two chiral nonets can be expressed in terms of a scalar and a pseudoscalar meson nonet @xmath13 where the two scalar meson nonets contain the two- and four - quark `` bare '' ( unmixed ) scalars @xmath14 and similar matrices for @xmath15 and @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> the framework of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite provides a detailed analysis of the mixing between these two `` bare '' nonets and how that results in a description of mass spectrum , decay widths and scattering analysis of scalar as well as pseudoscalar mesons below and above 1 gev . in this picture , the physical isotriplet scalars become a linear admixture of two- and four - quark components @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a 2@xmath192 rotation matrix ( here we use the matrix computed in @xcite ) .    the transformation properties ( [ m_trans ] ) as well as decompositions ( [ m_sp ] ) are direct consequences of the assumed underlying quark configurations . </S>",
    "<S> the two mesonic - level chiral nonets @xmath9 and @xmath10 can be mapped to the quark - level chiral nonets @xmath20 and @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> for example , eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ m_trans ] ) implies @xmath22 to make the connection to the quark world we need to make a specific choice for the proportionality factor , where here we choose @xmath23 ( there is no loss of generality or physical consequences associated with this choice ) . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of a composite operator in foreshadows our connection to qcd sum - rules because they are based upon correlation functions of composite operators @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , @xmath21 can be mapped to quark - level composite field configurations . </S>",
    "<S> however , in this case there are several options , each representing a different angular momentum , spin , flavor and color configurations for diquark - antiquark combination . here </S>",
    "<S> we do not list such quark configurations and only give the specific form below that we have used for our example analysis .    </S>",
    "<S> we assume a direct relationship between @xmath24 and @xmath9 via a scale matrix @xmath25 that adjusts the mass dimensions @xmath26 eqs .   and imply that under chiral transformations , the physical chiral nonet @xmath9 transforms as follows @xmath27 where by multiplying both sides by @xmath25 from left @xmath28 if @xmath9 is to transform in the same way as ( [ m_trans ] ) , then @xmath29=0~.\\ ] ] similarly it can be shown ( based on chiral tranformation of @xmath30 ) @xmath31=0\\ ] ] which means @xmath25 is a multiple of unit matrix , @xmath32 , where @xmath33 ( that must be determined ) is a scale factor connecting mesonic and qcd fields . </S>",
    "<S> the quark mass factor @xmath34 will ultimately result in renormalization - group invariant currents as discussed below . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , @xmath35 and we can show that @xmath36 is a multiple of unit matrix , i.e. @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the scale factor for the @xmath10 structures ( similar to @xmath33 , the scale factor @xmath38 must also be determined ) .    </S>",
    "<S> at this point the general methodology should be evident : each distinct substructure ( e.g. , two - quark versus four - quark ) requires a separate scale factor connecting the meson fields to the qcd currents . </S>",
    "<S> methods for determining these scale factors are developed below , and are a central feature of our analysis . to examine the validity of the connections between chiral lagrangians and qcd sum - rules </S>",
    "<S> , we consider a specific example of the isotriplets @xmath0 and @xmath1 , for which @xmath39 \\left ( \\spi \\right)_1 ^ 1 - \\left(\\spi\\right)_2 ^ 2 \\end{pmatrix } \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 is the rotation matrix for isovectors defined in @xcite and @xmath41 is formed out of the scale factors defined for the two chiral nonets in ( [ m_scale ] ) and ( [ mp_scale ] ) @xmath42    we can now associate the qcd - level fields @xmath43 and @xmath44 with similar - structure currents that are needed for qcd sum - rule techniques , so that the physical currents can be parameterized in the same way as that of states : @xmath45 \\left ( \\spi \\right)_1 ^ 1 - \\left(\\spi\\right)_2 ^ 2 \\end{pmatrix}\\ ] ] and this is related to the projected physical currents @xmath46 that probe the physical particles through correlation functions @xmath47 |0 \\rangle~.\\ ] ]    then the projected physical correlators can be defined @xmath48 |0 \\rangle \\\\ = & \\left(l_a^{-1}\\right)_{il}\\left(i_a\\right)_{lm } \\pi^{\\rm qcd}_{mn}(x ) \\left(i_a\\right)_{nk } \\left(l_a\\right)_{kj } ~. \\end{split}\\ ] ] we thus obtain ( after a fourier transform to momentum space ) the projected physical qcd correlation function matrix @xmath49 where @xmath50 denotes the transpose of the matrix @xmath51 and @xmath52 . although has been developed for the specific case of the @xmath2 system , its form is quite general and can be easily extended to other systems by augmenting the matrix @xmath41 to include a scale factor for each substructure and expanding the mixing matrix @xmath40 accordingly . </S>",
    "<S> the key point is that a matrix @xmath51 , composed of scale factors and mixing angles , can be used to obtain the physical projection of the qcd correlation function matrix .    on the other hand , the hadronic contribution to the physical correlator </S>",
    "<S> is determined via the mesonic fields and a qcd continuum @xmath53 |0 \\rangle \\\\ & = \\delta_{ij } \\ , \\left ( { 1\\over { m_{ai}^2 - q^2 -i m_{ai}\\gamma_{ai } } } + { \\rm cont.}\\right)~. \\end{split } \\label{pih}\\ ] ] the effect of final - state interactions in the @xmath54 channel is not as significant as this effect in the @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) channel in which the sigma ( kappa ) is probed , and therefore in the first approximation is neglected here . </S>",
    "<S> the last term represents the qcd continuum contribution inherent in qcd sum - rule methods @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this hadronic correlator is related to the projected physical qcd correlator ( [ pip ] ) by a standard dispersion relation .    </S>",
    "<S> eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> , ( [ pih ] ) can be used to express some constraints on the correlators . in the isotriplet channel case </S>",
    "<S> the vanishing of the off - diagonal elements of @xmath57 ( which is a 2 @xmath19 2 matrix in this case ) leads to the following self - consistency condition for @xmath58 : @xmath59~. \\label{g12}\\ ] ] this expression can be used in various ways . </S>",
    "<S> if the off - diagonal qcd correlator is known , then this expression can be used to assess the self - consistency of ( or to augment ) the analysis . alternatively , because off - diagonal correlators typically require higher - loop calculations and may be unknown ( and impractical to calculate ) , this expression can be used to eliminate the off - diagonal correlator . </S>",
    "<S> this latter approach will be used in our analysis of the @xmath2 system .    </S>",
    "<S> following standard qcd sum - rule methodologies , an operator ( e.g. , borel transformation operator ) is applied to the dispersion relation connecting the qcd and hadronic contributions to the projected physical correlators @xcite . because the laplace qcd sum - rules emphasize the lowest state , they are not ideally suited to our purposes because they may obscure the mixing phenomena central to our considerations . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore focus on the lowest - weight gaussian sum - rules that provides similar weight to ground and excited states @xcite @xmath60\\ , { 1\\over \\pi } { \\rm i m } \\pi^{\\rm h}(t ) dt\\ ] ] which is a diagonal matrix @xmath61    as an illustration of how our proposed approach bridges chiral lagrangian and qcd sum - rule methods we now calculate the scale factors @xmath33 and @xmath38 for the isotriplet @xmath2 scalar meson system . </S>",
    "<S> the qcd currents are @xcite @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the charge conjugation operator and @xmath64 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the diagonal terms in give @xmath65 where the qcd continuum has been absorbed into the qcd gaussian sum - rules , @xmath66 and @xmath67 respectively represent @xmath0 and @xmath1 , and the factor of @xmath68 is combined with @xmath69 for renormalization - group purposes . </S>",
    "<S> note that each physical sum - rule has its own continuum threshold represented by @xmath70 and @xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> given an input of @xmath72 from chiral lagrangians @xcite and the physical mass and width of the @xmath2 states , one can solve for the ( constant ) scale factors @xmath33 and @xmath38 , and develop a procedure for the optimized values of the continuum thresholds that minimize the @xmath73 dependence of the scale factors . </S>",
    "<S> expressions for the necessary qcd sum - rules can be found in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite along with standard values of the qcd input parameters ( e.g. , qcd condensates ) . </S>",
    "<S> we choose @xmath74 consistent with the central value used in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ scale_fig1 ] we show the @xmath73 dependence of the scale factors for the optimized values of the continuum . </S>",
    "<S> the remarkable independence of the scale factors on the auxiliary sum - rule parameter @xmath73 clearly demonstrates the validity of our proposed methodology .    </S>",
    "<S> the extracted values of the scale factors from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ scale_fig1 ] , @xmath75 and @xmath76 , are characteristic of the energy scales intuitively expected to emerge in relating qcd to chiral lagrangian approaches . </S>",
    "<S> however , @xmath33 is also related to the vacuum expectation value @xmath77 in remarkable agreement with the chiral lagrangian prediction of @xmath78 @xcite , providing strong supporting evidence for our proposed methodology . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , @xmath38 is related to the vacuum expectation value @xmath79 compared with the chiral lagrangian prediction of @xmath80 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although this comparison is not expected to be as robust because it does not contain renormalization - group invariants , the approximate agreement is significant .     </S>",
    "<S> ( lower solid curve ) and @xmath38 ( upper dashed curve ) are shown as a function of @xmath73 for optimized continuum thresholds @xmath81 and @xmath82 . the mixing angle @xmath83 of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite has been used . ]    </S>",
    "<S> we have also explored variations in @xmath72 from the chiral - lagrangian value @xmath83 @xcite ; increasing to @xmath84 and decreasing to @xmath85 leads to clear increases in the @xmath86 measure used to optimize the predicted scale factors . </S>",
    "<S> thus the qcd content of our proposed methodology has sufficient sensitivity to discriminate between different chiral lagrangian mixing scenarios . as an additional consistency check </S>",
    "<S> , we have verified that eq .   </S>",
    "<S> for the off - diagonal sum - rule @xmath87 agrees with the estimated order - of - magnitude effects expected from the leading - order perturbative result .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have proposed a general methodology that connects chiral lagrangians to qcd sum - rules through scale factor matrices relating the two approaches . </S>",
    "<S> these scale factor matrices combined with a rotation matrix then provide a matrix used to obtain the physical projection of the qcd correlation function matrix onto mesonic states . </S>",
    "<S> a detailed implementation has been provided for the @xmath0-@xmath1 system , and the resulting qcd extraction of the scale factors are independent of the auxiliary sum - rule parameter and are in excellent agreement with the quark qcd condensates and vacuum expectation values in chiral lagrangians . in this example </S>",
    "<S> implementation , we find sufficient sensitivity to discriminate between different chiral lagrangian mixing angles . </S>",
    "<S> thus our proposed methodology provides a powerful bridge connecting the relevant low - energy chiral lagrangian models and experimental data to the theoretical framework of qcd . </S>",
    "<S> we expect that this powerful synergy between chiral lagrangians and qcd will permit future progress on more challenging and controversial aspects of low - energy hadronic physics . </S>"
