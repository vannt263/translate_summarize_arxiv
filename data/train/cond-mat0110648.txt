    "lattice - gas models of dense fluids have been explored  @xcite in order to understand the microscopic details of their slow dynamics and to compare them with the behavior of other disordered systems like structural glass formers , spin glasses and colloids .    among the lattice models _",
    "random sequential adsorption _ ( rsa ) of particles on a substrate is of particular interest .",
    "rsa has been invented to mimic many experimental situations like chemisorption on crystal surfaces , reactions on polymer chains , adsorption of macromolecules and colloidal particles , monolayer and multilayer growth processes ( for an an extensive review see  @xcite ) .",
    "in particular rsa with added diffusion ( rsad ) has been considered a model which captures the main features of the compaction dynamics in granular matter  @xcite .",
    "the description of the relaxation processes in the rsad model has been investigated through the behavior of the time density correlation function in a limited number of studies and only during the deposition process @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we explore by computer simulation the equilibrium dynamical properties of a lattice gas of dimers as a function of density in two dimensions .",
    "the starting configurations have been produced with a rsad model where by deposition and diffusion of particles we reach the desired value for the density . in this way , due to the geometrical frustration , as the dimer density increases trapping configurations that only depend on the local environment @xcite are created in the system .",
    "the dynamical properties are studied by switching the deposition off .    in the next section",
    "we describe the model and the details of our monte carlo simulation . in the third section we present our results for the single dimer dynamics as a function of particle density .",
    "in particular we analyze the mean square displacement , the van hove self correlation function and its space fourier transform , the self intermediate scattering function .",
    "last section is devoted to concluding remarks .",
    "in order to investigate the dynamical properties of dimers on a square lattice with fixed density we have generated the starting configurations through a rsa model of dimers with diffusion in two dimensions ( rsad@xmath4 )  @xcite by monte carlo ( mc ) simulations .",
    "we performed also simulations of the same model in one dimension ( rsad@xmath5 ) for comparison .",
    "we have considered a square lattice of @xmath6 sites , with periodic boundary conditions in both directions .",
    "two kinds of dynamical processes can occur in the system , namely deposition of a dimer on an empty pair of sites and diffusion of a deposited dimer on an empty first neighbor site ; no overlap of dimers is allowed .",
    "the lattice is initially empty and at each mc step one deposition event ( or one diffusion event ) is selected with probability @xmath7 ( or @xmath8 ) , where @xmath9 .",
    "dimers can be adsorbed on the lattice in two possible orientations ( horizontal and vertical ) and can diffuse along their own axis . in the case of deposition , the dimer can occupy a randomly selected pair of sites if they are both empty , otherwise the attempt is rejected . in the case of diffusion the randomly selected horizontal ( vertical ) particle attempts to move left or right ( up or down ) , with equal probability . a diffusion event to the right ( left ) or up ( down )",
    "is possible only if the chosen pair of sites is occupied and the corresponding right ( left ) or up ( down ) neighbor site is empty , otherwise the attempt is rejected . as usual the mc time unit corresponds to @xmath10 deposition / diffusion attempts .",
    "we checked that finite - size effects are negligible for @xmath11 , so in the following we analyze a square lattice with @xmath12 .",
    "we produced 11 starting configurations at densities @xmath13 .",
    "for each configuration production runs at constant density have been obtained by switching the deposition events off . in this way we are able to follow the dynamics of the system in an equilibrium situation .",
    "in fact , the equilibrium distribution for this system , where all allowed configurations have the same weight , is a constant .",
    "therefore the detailed balance condition reduces to two requirements : transitions to forbidden states are not allowed , and transition from an allowed state to another has the same probability as the reverse one .",
    "both these requirements are satisfied by the adopted algorithm .",
    "a more complete investigation of the irreversible dynamics of these models and discussion of the role of the dimensionality is presented elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "in this section we investigate the dynamical behavior of this lattice model through the single dimer density correlators .",
    "we have chosen relatively large values of the density ( @xmath14 ) , since we are interested in the diffusive dynamics of the system in the high densification regime where slow dynamics is more likely to occur .",
    "the time over which the diffusive motion of particles has been followed reaches in most cases @xmath15 mc time units ( because of the statistical noise in the last decade only @xmath16 up to @xmath17 is shown in the plots ) .",
    "we analyze in the following the mean square displacement ( msd ) of the particle , @xmath18 , defined as @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the number density , @xmath21 is the position of particle @xmath22 at time @xmath16 and @xmath23 denotes a time average . in fig .",
    "[ f.1 ] we show a log - log plot @xmath18 for rsad@xmath4 for the different densities investigated .",
    "[ f.1 ]    after an initial transient , which is more pronounced at high densities , the temporal behavior of the msd can be fitted with two power laws . in the first time region @xmath24 . in the intermediate time region for the lower densities the msd shows a bent followed by a slight increase in the exponent , i.e. @xmath25 with @xmath26 , where the exponents depend upon density . the bent becomes more evident as the density increases .",
    "values of @xmath27 and @xmath28 are reported in table [ table1 ] .",
    ".values of the exponents extracted from the fit to the power law of the msd plotted in fig.1 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table1 ]    they are less than @xmath29 for all the densities considered : in particular @xmath27 and @xmath28 do not exceed respectively @xmath30 and @xmath31 , which are the values found for the lowest density , i.e. @xmath32 . the difference between the two exponents is more marked for intermediate densities ( @xmath33 ) . for the highest density ( @xmath34 )",
    "the msd shows a plateau for large times . in the time region",
    "investigated none of the curves shown attains the brownian diffusive regime , @xmath35 .",
    "these findings can be interpreted in terms of the density characterizing the degree of motion of particles like the thermal energy in thermal systems . for low densities",
    "single particles can move freely and the diffusive dynamics is almost independent of time . increasing the density particles remain trapped in local transient configurations  @xcite and diffusion slows down .",
    "for very high density the trapping configurations are frozen and the system does not evolve any more on the time scale of our simulations . the existence of trapping configurations and subdiffusive behavior is in general linked to the presence of disorder  @xcite that in the present case can be ascribed to the random barriers associated with the local environment determined by the geometrical constraints .",
    "the particle has to overcome these barriers and spend a long time before detrapping ( see  @xcite for an analogous case in a random walk model ) .",
    "these dynamical features are not present in the rsad@xmath5 model , where we have found a msd with a density independent slope for this case .",
    "nevertheless the behavior is subdiffusive , with an exponent @xmath36 constant over the whole time window investigated .",
    "for a closer analysis of the motion of the dimer we have considered the self part of the van hove correlation function ( svhcf ) @xmath37 , defined as @xmath38 which gives the probability of finding a particle around a distance @xmath0 at time @xmath16 , given that the same particle was at the origin at time @xmath39 .",
    "the msd analyzed in the previous subsection is the second spatial moment of the svhcf .",
    "nonetheless , in disordered diffusive systems that do not have a simple behavior , the svhcf might contain additional information on the microscopic relaxation mechanisms of the system , that could be smeared out in the msd .    the svhcf is shown for our system in fig",
    ".  [ f.2 ] for four densities at different times .",
    "we have calculated the one dimensional svhcf along the horizontal or the vertical direction . in fig .",
    "[ f.2 ] we show the svhcf averaged over the two directions .",
    "the self correlation functions shows a single peak centered around zero for all the times investigated .",
    "the appearance of more than one peak at a given time would have evidenced the existence of more than one , well distinct , relaxation mechanism for that time .",
    "[ f.2 ]    the single peaked structure confirms the dynamics to be mastered only by a single mechanism related to the existence of high entropic barriers generated by configurations in which a particle is locally trapped .",
    "it is also seen that at low density the svhcf is localized at short distances ( typically @xmath40 ) for short times and tends to delocalize for large times , since it is able to explore more configurations . at higher densities",
    "we observe a `` clustering '' of the various curves for @xmath41 ( this effect is particularly evident in fig .",
    "[ f.2](d ) ) : this is the signature of the fact that the movement of particles drastically slows down at such densities .",

    "[ f.3 ] data for @xmath51 at several different densities .",

    "only a part of the sisf can be observed , due to the very slow dynamical relaxation and the freezing of particles which is also evident in the msd .",

    "the collapse of correlators onto a single curve when plotted versus @xmath54 demonstrates the existence of a well defined scaling law on several decades for this kind of systems . in the range of density considered the stretching exponent @xmath1 is essentially constant , with a value @xmath55 , the density dependence being reflected only in the relaxation time @xmath2 .",
    "furthermore we have found that the behavior of @xmath2 versus @xmath56 follows the scaling law @xmath57 this fit is shown in the inset of fig .",

    "our estimates yield @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "given the uncertainties in the fit , this value found for @xmath61 can not be distinguished from the maximal density reachable in this system , which has been found to be @xmath62 in numerical simulations ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "this would suggest that there is no dynamical transition in this model , i.e. no critical density ( lower than the maximal density ) exists at which a structural arrest of the system occurs .",
    "it is important to stress that the relaxation time obeys the power law eq .",
    "( [ e.taufit ] ) , which has the same kind of scaling found in many glassy systems and is the signature of a sluggish dynamical behavior .",
    "the existence of a power law behavior for @xmath2 as a function of density and the validity of kww law are novel and interesting points for systems of this kind",
    ". it would be interesting to investigate in the future the @xmath2 and @xmath1 dependence on the wavevector to check on the range of validity of both the kww law and of the power law .",
    "we presented a monte carlo study of the single dimer density correlators for a randomly diffusive model of dimers on a square lattice as function of density . for each density",

    "we have found that this correlator in the @xmath63 space has a well defined scaling behavior with density that can be described with a high degree of accuracy by the kww function in most of the time region investigated .",
    "this function is well known to reproduce many features of disordered systems , and is connected to fractality in configurational space  @xcite .",
    "the exponent of the stretched exponential function @xmath1 is density independent and the relaxation time follows a power law with an exponent @xmath64 in the range of those of structural glass formers @xcite .",

    "it can be consistently derived that for this non thermal system the role of thermal energy is played by the density .",
    "we correspondingly find a subdiffusive behavior in the msd .",
