    "cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) are binary star systems that have a white dwarf ( primary ) and a secondary which fills its roche lobe and transfers matter to the primary",
    ".    dwarf novae ( dne ) are one of subtypes of cvs .",
    "dne have outbursts that are well understood as a release of gravitational energy caused by large mass transfer through the disk by the thermal instability .",
    "su uma - type dwarf novae are a subclass of dne .",
    "they have occasional superoutbursts that are brighter and have longer durations than normal outbursts . during superoutbursts",
    ", they show light variations , which have a period few percent longer than the orbital period , called superhumps .",
    "it is believed that superhumps are caused by the tidal instability that is triggered when the disk radius expands to the critical radius for the 3:1 resonance [ see e.g. @xcite for a theoretical review ] . according to @xcite , su uma - type dwarf novae generally show three distinct stages of period variation of superhumps ; the first stage with a longer superhump period ( stage a ) , middle stage with systematically varying periods ( stage b ) and final stage with a shorter superhump period ( stage c ) .",
    "wz sge - type dwarf novae are a subgroup of dwarf novae [ see e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ] .",
    "they are known as systems that have infrequent large - amplitude superoutbursts .",
    "although the general properties of outbursts in wz sge - type dwarf novae can be understood with thermal - tidal disk - instability model [ see e.g. @xcite , @xcite for wz sge ] , there remain features in wz sge - type dwarf novae whose origin is still in dispute .",
    "wz sge - type dwarf novae have several characteristic properties .",
    "one is the existence of double - wave early superhumps with periods close to the orbital periods in early stage of superoutbursts @xcite .",
    "@xcite originally suggested that these humps represent enhanced orbital humps arising from an enhanced mass transfer .",
    "@xcite suggested that these humps arise from the 2:1 resonance .",
    "although @xcite now appears to favor the explanation by @xcite for the origin of early superhumps , @xcite suggested that an enhanced mass transfer plays a role in wz sge - type outbursts  post - superoutburst rebrightenings .",
    "post - superoutburst rebrightenings [ also called `` echo outburst '' by @xcite ] are often seen after superoutbursts of wz sge - type dwarf novae .",
    "these rebrightenings are classified by their morphology ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the mechanism of rebrightenings is still in dispute .",
    "there is a suggestion that the enhanced mass - transfer following the superoutburst cause rebrightenings ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "on the other hand , it is suggested that persistence of high viscosity in the accretion disk after the termination of the superoutburst produce rebrightenings ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite wrote `` hot - spot eclipses establish that mass transfer is greatly enhanced during superoutburst .",
    "this may settle the debate over the origin of echo outbursts in dwarf novae '' , while @xcite reported that the conclusion by @xcite was a result of mis - interpretation of the observation , and there is no evidence of an enhanced mass transfer .    according to the standard evolutionary theory , cvs evolve from a longer to shorter orbital period and finally reach a minimum orbital period when the secondary begins to be degenerate or the thermal and mass - loss time scales become comparable for the secondary .",
    "then the secondary becomes a brown dwarf which can not remain in hydrogen burning or becomes somewhat oversized for its mass as a result of deviation from thermal equilibrium and the orbital period becomes longer again .",
    "the systems whose periods increase after reaching the minimum period are called period bouncers [ see e.g. @xcite for standard evolutionary theory of cvs ] .",
    "a fraction of known wz sge - type dwarf novae are thought to be period bouncers because of their short orbital periods ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "although the mechanism of rebrightenings are unknown , the rebrightenings have been thought to be related with evolutionary stages . @xcite and",
    "@xcite classified the rebrightenings of wz sge - type dwarf novae into four types by their light curve shapes : long duration rebrightenings ( type - a ) , multiple rebrightenings ( type - b ) , single rebrightening ( type - c ) , and no rebrightening ( type - d ) .",
    "@xcite indicated there is a relation between these rebrightening types and @xmath2 versus @xmath3 [ see figure 37 of @xcite ] .",
    "this result implies that rebrightening type generally reflects the system parameters ( the nature or the evolutionary state ) of the system , although different superoutbursts in the same system sometimes show different rebrightening types [ al com : @xcite ; wz sge : @xcite ] . in ez lyn , however , two superoutbursts that have been observed so far were with type - b rebrightenings ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , suggesing that the same object tends to show the same type of rebrightenings .",
    "the cases were also true for uz boo ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and wz sge ( 1978 and 2011 , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we here assume as the starting point that wz sge - type dwarf novae can be generally categorized by the rebrightening type .",
    "eg cnc , one of wz sge - type dwarf novae , is known to have had a superoutburst with multiple rebrightenings ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "it was discovered with its outbursts in 1977 by @xcite .",
    "@xcite calculated its mass ratio @xmath4 from the fractional superhump excess , defined as @xmath5 .",
    "using an average white dwarf mass of 0.7 @xmath6 , this suggests very low secondary mass @xmath7 .",
    "after then , it has been generally considered that objects with multiple rebrightenings are good candidates of period bouncers .    in this paper",
    ", we present two wz sge - type dwarf novae which exhibited multiple rebrightenings .",
    "master ot j211258.65@xmath0242145.4 was discovered by the mobile astronomical system of the telescope - robots ( master ; @xcite ) network ( @xcite , hereafter master j211258 ) .",
    "the quiescent counterpart was identified with a 20-th magnitude star .",
    "the large outburst amplitude ( @xmath87 mag ) was suggestive of a wz sge - type dwarf nova ( vsnet - alert 14697 ) .",
    "master ot j203749.39 + 552210.3 was discovered by master network ( @xcite , hereafter master j203749 ) .",
    "no previous outburst is known .",
    "the quiescent counterpart was identified with a 20-th magnitude star . the large outburst amplitude ( more than 7 mag ) was again suggestive of a wz sge - type dwarf nova .",
    "these objects turned out to be wz sge - type dwarf novae with multiple rebrightenings .",
    "we report in this paper on the development of their outbursts and superhumps and discuss the implications from the recorded variation of superhump periods . in section [ sec : obs ] , we briefly show a log of observations and the analysis method . in section [ sec : res2112 ] and section [ sec : res2037 ] , we present the results of the observations of master j211258 and master j203749 , respectively . in section [ sec : discussion ]",

    "we presented an interpretation that the increase in the superhump periods is a result of the decrease of pressure effect during the final stage of the superoutburst and showed that the derived disk radius is in fair agreement with the previous work .",

    "<S> early superhumps were recorded in both systems . during superoutburst plateau , ordinary superhumps with a period of 0.060291(4 ) d ( master j211258 ) and of 0.061307(9 ) d ( master j203749 ) in average were observed . </S>",
    "<S> master j211258 and master j203749 exhibited eight and more than four post - superoutburst rebrightenings , respectively . in the final part of the superoutburst , </S>",

    "<S> we have made a survey of wz sge - type dwarf novae with multiple rebrightenings , and confirmed that the superhump periods of wz sge - type dwarf novae with multiple rebrightenings were longer than those of wz sge - type dwarf novae without a rebrightening . </S>",
    "<S> although wz sge - type dwarf novae with multiple rebrightenings have been thought to be the good candidates for period bouncers based on their low mass ratio ( @xmath1 ) from inferred from the period of fully grown ( stage b ) superhumps , our new method using the period of growing superhumps ( stage a superhumps ) , however , implies higher @xmath1 than those expected from stage b superhumps . </S>",
    "<S> these @xmath1 values appear to be consistent with the duration of the stage a superoutbursts , which likely reflects the growth time of the 3:1 resonance . </S>",
    "<S> we present a working hypothesis that the small fractional superhump excesses for stage b superhumps in these systems may be explained as a result that a higher gas pressure effect works in these systems than in ordinary su uma - type dwarf novae . </S>",
    "<S> this result leads to a new picture that wz sge - type dwarf novae with multiple rebrightenings and su uma - type dwarf novae without a rebrightening ( they are not period bouncers ) are located in the same place on the evolutionary track . </S>"
