    "measurements in the forward region probe the parton content of the proton at small values of the proton momentum fraction , in a region where the parton densities might become very large and where the probability for more than one partonic interaction per event should increase .",
    "the measurement of the energy flow in the cms forward region @xcite , in the pseudorapidity range @xmath3 , should therefore be sensitive to the modelling of parton radiation at large @xmath4 and the description of multiparton interactions ( mpi ) @xcite .",
    "the measurement is performed for two event classes : a minimum bias sample and a sample of events with a central dijet system . the first class is characterized by zero or few partonic interactions , while the second one has at least one hard scattering at the parton level .",
    "the amount of parton radiation in the forward region is therefore expected to be larger for the dijet sample , which should be directly reflected in the forward energy flow . the forward measurement can thus provide a complementary and independent constraint on the mpi modelling .      a detailed description of the cms experiment can be found elsewhere  @xcite and we only describe here the subsystems used to obtain the presented results .",
    "the two hadronic forward calorimeters hf+ and hf- , located at @xmath511.2 m from the nominal interaction point ( ip ) , cover the pseudorapidity region @xmath6 .",
    "these are cerenkov calorimeters made of radiation hard quartz fibers embedded into steel absorbers .",
    "two subsystems , the beam scintillator counters ( bsc ) and the beam pick - up timing for the experiments ( bptx ) are used to trigger the detector readout @xcite .",
    "the two bscs are located at @xmath510.86  m from the ip and cover the pseudorapidity region @xmath7 .",
    "each is a set of 16 scintillator tiles .",
    "the bsc elements have a time resolution of 3 ns and are designed to provide hit and coincidence rates .",
    "the two bptxs , located around the beam pipe at @xmath5175 m from the ip , are designed to provide precise information on the bunch structure and timing of the incoming beam , with better than 0.2 ns time resolution .",
    "the forward energy flow is measured at 3 values of @xmath1 = 0.9 tev , 2.36 tev and 7  tev , for the 2 event classes described above .",
    "the following conditions are imposed to select the minimum bias sample .",
    "a signal is required in each of the bscs in conjunction with bptx signals from both beams passing the ip .",
    "this condition rejects a large fraction of diffractive events .",
    "a primary vertex is required with @xmath8 15 cm and a transverse distance from the @xmath9 axis smaller than 2 cm .",
    "further cuts are applied to reject beam - halo event candidates , beam - scraping events and events with large signals consistent with noise in hf .",
    "the energy flow is then measured in 5 different @xmath4 bins by summing up all the energy deposits in the hf towers above a noise threshold of 4  gev .",

    "the dominant contribution of 15 @xmath15 corresponds to the global hf energy scale uncertainty .",
