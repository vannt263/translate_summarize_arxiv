    "gravitational instabilities ( gis ) can occur in any region of a gas disk that becomes sufficiently cool or develops a high enough surface density . in the nonlinear regime",
    ", gis can produce local and global spiral waves , self - gravitating turbulence , mass and angular momentum transport , and disk fragmentation into dense clumps and substructure .",
    "it has been quite some time since the idea was first suggested ( kuiper 1951 ; cameron 1978 ) and revived by boss ( 1997 , 1998a ) that the dense clumps in a disk fragmented by gis may become self - gravitating precursors to gas giant planets .",
    "this particular idea for gas giant planet formation has come to be known as the _ disk instability _ theory .",
    "the idea is appealing since gravitational instability develops on very short timescales compared to the accumulation of planetesimals by gravity and the subsequent accretion of gas by a rocky core , the conventional two - stage formation giant planet formation theory known as _ core accretion _ ( see the chapter by marzari et al . ) .",
    "the particular emphasis of this review chapter is on how gravitational instability develops when a protoplanetary disk is not isolated but is a member of a binary or multiple star system ( see the chapter by prato & weinberger ) .",
    "indeed such a configuration is likely to be the most common in the galaxy : the majority of solar - type stars in the galaxy belong to double or multiple stellar systems ( duquennoy & mayor 1991 ; eggenberger et al . 2004 ) .",
    "radial velocity surveys have shown that planets exist in binary or multiple stellar systems where the stars have separations from @xmath0 20 to several thousand au ( eggenberger et al .",
    "2004 ; see the chapter by eggenberger & udry ) .",
    "although the samples are still small , attempts have been made to compare properties of planets in single and multiple stellar systems ( patience et al .",
    "2002 ; udry et al .",
    "adaptive optics surveys designed to quantify the relative frequency of planets in single and multiple systems are underway ( udry et al . 2004 ; chauvin et al .",
    "at least 30% of extrasolar planetary systems appear to occur in binary or multiple star systems ( raghavan et al .",
    "these surveys could offer a new way to test theories of giant planet formation , provided that different formation models yield different predictions about the effects of a stellar companion .",
    "the parameter that determines whether gis occur in thin gas disks is    @xmath1    where @xmath2 is the sound speed , @xmath3 is the epicyclic frequency at which a fluid element oscillates when perturbed from circular motion , @xmath4 is the gravitational constant , and @xmath5 is the surface density . in a nearly keplerian disk , @xmath6 the rotational angular speed @xmath7 . for axisymmetric ( ring - like ) disturbances ,",
    "disks are stable when @xmath8 ( toomre 1964 ) . at high @xmath9-values , pressure , represented by @xmath2 in ( 1 ) ,",
    "stabilizes short wavelengths , and rotation , represented by @xmath3 , stabilizes long wavelengths .",
    "the most unstable wavelength when @xmath10 is given by @xmath11 .",
    "modern numerical simulations , beginning with papaloizou & savonije ( 1991 ) , show that nonaxisymmetric disturbances , which grow as multi - armed spirals , become unstable for @xmath12 . because the instability is both linear and dynamic",
    ", small perturbations grow exponentially on the time scale of a rotation period @xmath13 .",
    "the multi - arm spiral waves that grow have a predominantly trailing pattern , and several modes can appear simultaneously ( boss 1998a ; laughlin et al . 1997 ; nelson et al .",
    "1998 ; pickett et al . 1998 ) .",
    "numerical simulations show that , as gis emerge from the linear regime , they may either saturate at nonlinear amplitude or grow enough to fragment the disk .",
    "two major effects control or limit the outcome  disk thermodynamics and nonlinear mode coupling . at this point",
    ", the disks also develop large surface distortions . as emphasized by pickett et al .",
    "( 1998 , 2000 , 2003 ) , the vertical structure of the disk plays a crucial role , both for cooling and for essential aspects of the dynamics . as a result , except for isothermal disks ,",
    "gis tend to have large amplitudes at the surface of the disk .    using second and third - order governing equations for spiral modes and comparing their results with a full nonlinear hydrodynamics treatment , laughlin et al .",
    "1998 studied nonlinear mode coupling in the most detail . even if only a single mode initially emerges from the linear regime , power",
    "is quickly distributed over modes with a wide variety of wavelengths and number of arms , resulting in a self - gravitating turbulence that permeates the disk . in this",
    "_ gravitoturbulence _ , gravitational torques and even reynold s stresses may be important over a wide range of scales ( nelson et al . 1998 ; gammie 2001 ; lodato & rice 2004 ; meja et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "as the spiral waves grow , they can steepen into shocks that produce strong localized heating ( pickett et al .",
    "1998 , 2000a ; nelson et al .",
    "gas is also heated by compression and through net mass transport due to gravitational torques .",
    "the ultimate source of gi heating is work done by gravity .",
    "the subsequent evolution depends on whether a balance can be reached between heating and the loss of disk thermal energy by radiative or convective cooling .",
    "the notion of a balance of heating and cooling in the nonlinear regime was described as early as 1965 by goldreich & lynden - bell and has been used as a basis for proposing @xmath14-treatments for gi - active disks ( paczyski 1978 ; lin & pringle 1987 ) . for slow to moderate cooling rates ,",

    "@xmath9 then hovers near the instability limit , and the nonlinear amplitude is controlled by the cooling rate .",
    "there have been various attempts to model radiative cooling in self - gravitating disks . for a recent overview of the different methods appearing in the literature and for a general discussion of gravitational instability in protoplanetary disks , we point the reader to durisen et al .",
    "( 2007 ) . in this chapter",
    "we will focus on the radiative cooling models that have been used in the few existing works on binary self - gravitating protoplanetary disks .      as shown first by gammie ( 2001 ) for local thin - disk calculations and",
    "later confirmed by rice et al .",
    "( 2003b ) and meja et al .",
    "( 2005 ) in full 3d hydro simulations , disks with a fixed cooling time , @xmath15 , fragment for sufficiently fast cooling , specifically when @xmath16 , or , equivalently , @xmath17 @xmath18 .",

    "2003b ; mayer et al .",
    "when dealing with realistic radiative cooling , however , one can not apply this simple fragmentation criterion to arbitrary initial disk models .",
    "one has to apply it to the asymptotic phase after nonlinear behavior is well - developed ( johnson & gammie 2003 ) .",
    "cooling times can be much longer in the asymptotic state than they are initially ( cai et al .",
    "2006a , b ; meja et al . , in preparation ) . for disks evolved under isothermal conditions , where a simple cooling time can not be defined",
    ", local thin - disk calculations show fragmentation when @xmath19 ( johnson & gammie 2003 ) .",
    "this is roughly consistent with results from global simulations ( e.g. , boss 2000 ; nelson et al .",

    "( 2003b ) also found that clumps could form in disks with even longer cooling times ( @xmath22 ) if the disk mass was increased .",
    "this latter estimate is in agreement with the time scales for cooling found in 3d models with diffusion approximation radiative transfer and convective - like motions that led to fragmentation into self - gravitating clumps ( boss 2001 , 2004a ) .",
    "although there is general agreement on conditions for fragmentation , two important questions remain .",
    "do real disks ever cool fast enough for fragmentation to occur , and do the fragments last long enough to contract into permanent protoplanets before being disrupted by tidal stresses , shear stresses , physical collisions , and shocks ?",
    "recent simulations have just begun to address the issue of the long term survival of clumps once they have been produced in a disk ( durisen et al .",
    "none of these long - term simulations has explored the case of binary systems and therefore their results are not necessarily valid in that case ( for example they do not take into account the effect of eventual orbital resonances with the companion that might ) . .",
    "however , except for clumps forming at the very periphery of one of the two disks , one would expect the tidal stresses to be dominated by the central star of their own disk , in which case the results of isolated disks are still relevant .",
    "in addition , clumps are unlikely to form near the outskirts of disks since the surface density should be too low there .",
    "high spatial resolution appears to be crucial for the survival of clumps .",
    "pickett et al . ( 2003 ) found that 256 azimuthal cells were not enough to resolve self - gravity on a scale of a fraction of au , leading to artificial dissolution of overdensities .",
    "an increased ability of clumps to persist and become gravitationally bound as the resolution is increased was also found by boss ( 2001 ) and mayer et al .",
    "high spatial resolution of the gravitational force is crucial , as is the accuracy of a gravity solver for a given resolution element .",
    "these features are extremely code - dependent and are briefly discussed below in section 2.2 .",
    "to date , only three papers have been published that consider the possibility of forming giant planets by disk instability in binary star systems : nelson ( 2000 ) , mayer et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , and boss ( 2006b )",
    ". in short , nelson ( 2000 ) found that binarity prevented fragmentation from occurring , boss ( 2006b ) found that binarity could enhance clump formation , and mayer et al .",
    "( 2005 ) found the binarity could discourage fragmentation in some cases , but permit it in other cases .",
    "these three papers are the focus of the remainder of this chapter , as we try to decipher the reasons for this apparent dispersion in outcomes .",
    "three codes have been used so far to follow the evolution of binary protoplanetary disks , two smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) codes ( nelson 2000 ; mayer et al . 2005 ) and one finite - difference grid - based code ( boss 2006b ; described in detail by boss & myhill 1992 ) .",
    "the two sph codes are , respectively , a modified version ( nelson 2000 ) of a code originally developed by benz ( 1990 ) and gasoline ( wadsley et al .",
    "2004 ; mayer et al . 2005 ) .",
    "we begin with a description of the codes .",
    "although the two sph codes are based on a very similar implementation of sph , there are differences in some aspects that might be important for understanding differences in results .",
    "one major difference is that the version of the code used in nelson ( 2000 ) is 2d while gasoline is 3d , as is the boss ( 2006b ) code .",
    "evidence has been accumulated recently that gravitational instability in a protoplanetary disk is an intrinsically three - dimensional phenomenon ( cai et al .",
    "2006a , b ) . at the same time , at the resolution for which affordable simulations can be done , 3d codes resolve only very poorly the structure of the disk in the third dimension .",
    "nelson ( 2006 ) has shown that if the vertical structure is not well resolved , both from a hydrodynamical standpoint and from a radiative transfer standpoint , serious errors in the evolution of the disks may develop . therefore , even with all other things being equal",
    ", this difference alone could result in a different evolution of the spiral patterns , and thus of the outcome of gravitational instability . in what follows",
    "we will highlight the most important features of the two sph codes and we will explicitly indicate in what ways the two codes differ and what is the expected outcome of such differences .",
    "sph is an approach to hydrodynamical modeling first developed by lucy ( 1976 ) and gingold & monaghan ( 1977 ) .",
    "it is a particle - based method that does not refer to grids for the calculation of hydrodynamical quantities : all forces and fluid properties are determined by moving particles , thereby eliminating numerically diffusive advective terms .",
    "the boss & myhill ( 1992 ) code is an eulerian code , with all quantities defined on a spherical coordinate grid .",
    "the code is second - order accurate in both space and time , a crucial factor for keeping numerical diffusion at a tolerable level .",
    "the basis of the sph method is the lagrangian representation and evolution of smoothly varying fluid quantities whose value is only known at disordered discrete points in space occupied by particles .",
    "particles are the fundamental resolution elements comparable to cells in a grid .",
    "sph operates through local summation operations over particles weighted with a smoothing kernel , @xmath23 , that approximates a local integral .",
    "the smoothing operation provides a basis from which to obtain derivatives .",
    "thus , estimates of density - related physical quantities and gradients are generated .",
    "both gasoline and nelson s code use a fairly standard implementation of the hydrodynamical equations of motion for sph ( monaghan 1992 ) .",
    "the density at the location of each particle with index @xmath24 is calculated from a sum over particle masses @xmath25    @xmath26    where @xmath27 is an index running on the entire set of @xmath28 particles .",
    "the momentum equation is expressed as    @xmath29    where @xmath30 is pressure , @xmath31 is velocity and the artificial viscosity term is @xmath32 .    the kernel is a standard b - spline with compact support in both codes ( hernquist & katz 1987 ) . the number of neighbors , or in other words , the number of particles around a given particle that are considered for smoothed sums , is fixed in gasoline at @xmath33 and varies between 10 and 30 in the 2d version of nelson s code , depending on the local flow .",
    "clearly gravity solvers represent a crucial aspect of simulations of self - gravitating disks .",
    "they need to be both accurate and efficient , and possibly parallelized in order to take advantage of modern computer architectures and permitting very high resolution calculations to be performed .",
    "both gasoline and nelson s code compute gravity using a tree - based solver , which is fast , easily parallelizable and a natural choice for a particle - based hydrodynamical such as sph , since once a tree is built it can also be re - used as an efficient search method for hydrodynamical forces as well .",
    "both codes use a modified versions of the binary tree described in benz et al .",
    "( 1990 ) which approximates the gravity of groups of distant particles in a multipole expansion while calculating interactions of nearby particles explicitly .",
    "gravitational forces due to neighbor particles are softened to avoid divergences as particles pass near each other . the force calculation in tree algorithms",
    "requires work proportional to @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the number of particles in the simulation , as opposed to work proportional to @xmath36 in `` direct '' n - body algorithms where all gravitational forces between individual particles are computed directly .",
    "the drawback is that , except for very nearby particles whose interactions may be calculated as in direct summation codes , the forces are approximate rather than exact when using a tree .",
    "a particularly useful property of tree codes is the ability to efficiently calculate forces for a subset of the bodies .",
    "this is critical if there is a large range of time - scales in a simulation and multiple independent timesteps are employed ( see below ) . at the cost of force calculations",
    "no longer being synchronized among the particles substantial gains in time - to - solution may be realized .",
    "multiple timesteps are particularly important for applications where the primary interest and thus need for high spatial resolution tends to be focused on small regions within a larger simulated volume ; a protoplanetary disk undergoing fragmentation locally is one such application .",
    "gasoline uses 4th ( hexadecapole ) rather than 2nd ( quadrupole ) order multipole moments ( as used by most tree codes , including nelson s ) to represent the mass distribution in cells at each level of the tree .",
    "this results in less computation for the same level of accuracy : better pipelining , smaller interaction lists for each particle and reduced communication demands in parallel .",
    "the current implementation in gasoline uses reduced moments that require only @xmath37 terms to be stored for the @xmath38 moment . for",
    "a detailed discussion of the accuracy and efficiency of the tree algorithm as a function the order of the multipoles used , see stadel ( 2001 ) .",
    "relaxation effects compromise the attempt to model continuous fluids using particles .",
    "both in gasoline and in nelson s code the particle masses are effectively smoothed in space using the same spline kernels employed in the sph calculation .",
    "this means that the gravitational forces vanish at zero separation and return to newtonian @xmath39 at a separation of @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the gravitational softening applied to each particle . in this sense the gravitational forces",
    "are well matched to the sph forces .",
    "however , in gasoline gravitational softening is constant over time and fixed at the beginning of the simulation , while in nelson s code it is time - dependent and always equal to the local sph smoothing length .",
    "the use of adaptive softening in nelson s code ensures that gravitational and pressure forces are always represented with the same resolution .",
    "bate & burkert ( 1997 ) have shown that when an imbalance between pressure and gravitational forces occurs , artificial fragmentation or suppression of physical fragmentation can arise .",
    "while bate & burkert ( 1997 ) found that such imbalance leads to spurious results when it occurs at a scale comparable with the local jeans length of the system , more recently nelson ( 2006 ) has shown that particle clumping was amplified for imbalances in softening / smoothing even when the toomre wavelength was well resolved , which is a much more limiting codndition . when the gravitational softening is fixed over time , such as in gasoline",
    ", care has to be taken that this be comparable to the sph smoothing length at the scale of the jeans length .",
    "mayer et al .",
    "( 2005 ) choose the softening according to the latter prescription at the beginning of the simulation and set its value so that outside @xmath42 the softening drops to @xmath43 the local smoothing length .",
    "an argument can be made that later in the evolution , when strong overdensities develop along the spiral arms the sph smoothing length drops significantly , becoming smaller than the gravitational softening , thereby degrading the propensity for numerical fragmentation .",
    "both the initial softening / smoothing inequality and the later evolution of disks towards fragmentation were examined by nelson ( 2006 ) , with the result that to fragmentation was still enhanced , but after it began , simulations could be evolved much further , because the fragments did not continue to contract indefinitely but rather remained comparable in size to the fixed softening value .",
    "no specific tests of whether this occurs as well in the mayer et al .",
    "work , or how the results may be affected , has yet been done .",
    "it may be of some note however , that the fragmentation in their work only occured in the outer half of their disks , where the force imbalances favor gravity , as seen in nelson ( 2006 ) .",
    "an on going comparison between sph and adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) codes conducted at different resolutions and particle softening is in preparation ( mayer et al .",
    ", in preparation , see also durisen et al .",
    "2007 ) and may provide an independent check of the reliability of fragmentation in sph . on the other hand , since this happens when the gas is optically thick , cooling is also suppressed ( see below ) , and this might be the dominant , physical effect in slowing down the collapse .",
    "even so , compensating for insufficiencies in a physical model , using flaws in a numerical code , would seem to be , at best , undesirable .",
    "adaptive softening is also not without flaws  particles have a time - dependent potential energy , which induces fluctuations in the potential that can in principle increase force errors , possibly affecting the accuracy of the integration .",
    "this is known to be problematic for purely gravitational simulations such as those of cosmic structure formation , but its consequences have not been studied systematically for the case of self - gravitating fluids .",
    "recent work of price & monaghan ( 2006 ) has shown how adpative softening may be used while still conserving energy , but their technique has not yet seen wide adoption .    in the boss & myhill ( 1992 ) code , poisson s equation is solved for the gravitational potential at each time step .",
    "this solution is achieved by using a spherical harmonic ( @xmath44 ) expansion of the density and gravitational potential , with terms in the expansion up to @xmath45 32 or 48 typically being used .",
    "boss ( 2000 , 2001 ) found that the number of terms in this expansion was just as important for robust clump formation as the spatial resolution . because the computational effort involved scales as the number of terms squared , however , in practice this value can not be increased much beyond 48 without having the poisson solver dominate the effort .",
    "boss ( 2005 ) showed that the introduction of point masses to represent very high density clumps led to better defined , more massive clumps , but the computational effort associated with introducing these point masses also led to an appreciable slowing the execution speeds .",
    "nelson s code uses the runge - kutta - fahlberg method to evolve the equations of motion .",
    "it employs a global timestep for all particles in the disk , which was increased or decreased depending on the conditions in the simulations .",
    "the integrator is a first order accurate method with second order error control and the scheme provides limits on the second order error term in all of the various variables .",
    "gasoline incorporates the timestep scheme described as kick - drift - kick ( kdk ) ( see wadsley et al .",
    "2004 ) . without gas forces",
    "this is a symplectic leap - frog integration , which ensures the conservation of total energy , this being not guaranteed with the runge - kutta method ( quinn et al .",
    "1997 ; tremaine et al .",
    "2003 ) , though much better conservation can be had when a single time step for all particles is used , as was done in nelson ( 2000 ) .",
    "the leap - frog scheme requires only one force evaluation and minimum storage .",
    "gasoline uses multiple timesteps , hence at any given time different particles in the disk can be evolved with different timesteps .",
    "the base ( maximum ) timestep is divided in a hierarchy of smaller steps ( rungs ) , with different particles being assigned to different rungs .",
    "this allows to reach a much smaller step size when it is required , allowing to probe a much higher dynamic range and follow correctly the dynamics of regions with very high densities .",
    "the drawback is that the scheme is no longer strictly symplectic if particles change rungs during the integration which they generally must do to satisfy their individual timestep criteria .",
    "adaptivity in the time integration , hence the ability to achieve small timesteps than the dynamics or hydrodynamics require so , can be important to model correctly the formation and evolution of overdensities and clumps .",
    "in fact , if the step size is not small enough the acceleration inside the overdensities , that goes as @xmath46 , can be underestimated .",
    "this is equivalent to underestimate the self - gravity of clumps and can in principle lead to their artificial dissolution , although no systematic tests have ever been performed .",
    "gasoline uses a standard timestep criterion based on the particle acceleration ( see wadsley et al .",
    "2004 ) and for gas particles , the courant condition and the expansion cooling rate .",
    "nelson s code adopts the courant condition as well for hydrodynamical forces and addituonally a set of constraints based on the position and velocities of particles .",
    "if the latter are not met after a timestep , the scheme went back and tries again with a smaller timestep .",
    "the boss & myhill ( 1992 ) code uses a single - size timestep based on the courant condition , and uses a predictor - corrector method to achieve second - order accuracy in time .",
    "most hydrodynamic methods need artificial viscosity to stabilize the flow by avoiding particle interpenetration and to resolve in an approximate manner the physical dissipation present in shocks , and sph is no exception . both mayer et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and nelson ( 2000 ) use bulk and von  neumann - richtmyer ( so called ` @xmath47 ' and ` @xmath48 ' ) viscosities to simulate viscous pressures which are linear and quadratic in the velocity divergence .",
    "they both incorporate a switch ( see balsara 1995 ) that acts to reduce substantially the large undesirable shear component associated with the standard form .    in both gasoline and nelson s code",
    "the artificial viscosity term reads    @xmath49    where @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 is the sound speed . @xmath53 and @xmath54 are standard values of the coefficients of artificial viscosity , known to result in acceptable dissipative behavior across a wide variety of test problems .    in protoplanetary disks ,",
    "mach numbers are high ( of order 10 - 20 ) although shocks are not as strong ( i.e. the density jumps are not as pronounced ) as when gas collapses or collides with other gas along nearly radial trajectories such as in cosmological structure formation .",
    "this is important because it means that the standard settings for the viscous coefficients may be higher than strictly necessary for correct evolution of the flow .",
    "since artificial viscosity is essentially a nuisance with regard to improving the modeling of the hydrodynamical flow , any improvements which decrease the importance of unphysical side effects , while retaining the required stability and dissipative effects of the code , are desirable .",
    "mayer et al .",
    "( 2004 ) have therefore experimented with lowering the coefficients of artificial viscosity , finding that for e.g. @xmath55 and @xmath56 or @xmath55 and @xmath57 fragmentation is more vigorous .",
    "however , the simulations of binary protoplanetary disks in mayer et al .",
    "( 2005 ) were designed following a conservative approach , hence the standard values @xmath53 and @xmath54 were employed .",
    "they do , however , include a modification due to balsara ( 1995 ) , to modify the computation of the velocity divergence from its usual form by multiplying the above equation by a correction factor    @xmath58    to reduce shear viscosity .",
    "this factor is near unity when the flow is strongly compressive , but near zero in shear flows . in the simulations of nelson",
    "et al . ( 2000 ) and nelson ( 2000 ) , the typical reduction of viscosity due to this term is a factor of three or better .",
    "nelson s code starts from the same formulation of artificial viscosity shown above ( except that surface density replaces volume density ) , modified by the same balsara shear factor , but then also includes a second treatment to obtain a locally varying artificial viscosity .",
    "this treatment is due to morris and monaghan ( 1997 ) , who implemented a time dependence to the coefficient @xmath47 that allows growth in regions where it is physically appropriate ( strong compressions ) and decay in quiescent regions where it is inappropriate .",
    "the decay takes place over distances of a few sph smoothing lengths , after which the coefficient stabilizes to a constant , quiescent value .",
    "nelson adopts a formulation including both the @xmath47 and @xmath48 terms , where @xmath59 , but the magnitudes of the coefficients vary in time and space according to the morris & monaghan formulation . thus , except in strongly compressing regions ( shocks ) where it is required to stabilize the flow , artificial viscous dissipation is minimized .    .",
    "the snapshots after about 8 orbital times at @xmath60 au , i.e. about 240 years , are shown .",
    "on the left a run without the balsara correction term is shown , on the right the same disk is evolved with the balsara term on.,height=226 ]    in gasoline , only the balsara correction term is added .",
    "therefore , in general the gasoline simulations presented in mayer et al .",
    "( 2005 ) should be more diffusive , which should go in the direction of suppressing fragmentation if all other aspects of the modeling are the same .",
    "figure 2 supports the claim of mayer et al .",
    "( 2004 ) on the effect of artificial viscosity by showing that even the simple omission of the balsara term to reduce spurious shear viscosity can suppress fragmentation in an otherwise fragmenting disk .",
    "however , we note that the effect of artificial viscosity is more subtle than this , and that tests such as those of figure 2 probably address only the impact of viscosity on the transition between mild overdensities and those strong enough to begin collapsing .",
    "once they start collapsing the prevailing effect of artificial viscosity could actually be to enhance the growth and survival of the clumps by taking kinetic energy out of the system .",
    "artificial viscosity , be it explicitly inserted or implicit to the code , is one way in which actual physical processes ocurring on the sub - grid scale , such as shock front heating and dissipation , can be included in the calculation . a tensor formulation artificial viscosity is included in the boss & myhill ( 1992 ) code , but is generally not used in the disk instability models , except to discern the extent to which artificial viscosity can suppress fragmentation ( boss 2006b ) .",
    "numerical stability is maintained instead by using as small a fraction of the courant time step as is needed , sometimes as low as 1% of the courant value .",

    "( 2005 ) , to have eccentricities of either 0.25 or 0.5 , and to having the calculation start off with the binary companion at either apoastron or at periastron in its orbit .",

    "if the binary companion had a similar size disk , these disks would collide , but the binary companion is assumed to be a diskless point mass in all of the boss ( 2006b ) models .",

    "disk thermodynamics is crucial for the outcome of gravitational instability .",
    "fragmentation will occur only if cooling times are comparable to the orbital time .",
    "leaving alone all the other differences , the simple fact that nelson ( 2000 ) had cooling times in a large fraction of his disks that were a factor of 10 times longer than the orbital times can explain why fragmentation did not occur in his models . with such long cooling times , disks will not fragment in isolation , no matter how strong is the spiral structure appearing in the disk , and thus irrespective of whether this structure is spontaneous or is tidally triggered by a nearby companion .",
    "nevertheless , fragmentation is not determined by the longest cooling times in the disk , but by the shortest .",
    "nelson s disks did exhibit short cooling times at larger radii , in spite of this fact , did not fragment .",
    "rapid cooling of the disk midplane by convective - like motions in 3d disks has been shown to occur with several different codes ( boss 2004a , 2005 ; boley et al . 2006 ; mayer et al . 2006 ) and can lead to disk fragmentation ( boss 2004a , 2005 ) , provided that the heat transported upward by these motions to the disk s surface can be radiated away to the protostellar envelope , a condition disputed by rafikov ( 2006 ) .",
    "the vertical structure model of nelson ( 2000 ) assumed efficient vertical energy transport via convection , but did not produce fragmentation .",
    "the thermal boundary conditions on the disk surface then become of critical importance , and these boundary conditions are the subject of current research . until the issue of disk thermal boundary conditions can be further clarified , it is useful to ask whether for relatively short cooling times , comparable to or less than the orbital period , binarity promotes or suppresses fragmentation .",

    "clearly some mass transport has happened even without self - gravity .",
    "such mass transport is the result of tidal torques induced by the gravitational interaction with the companion and the fact that little disk material exists in the initial state inside 4  au to resist the flow of additional material inward .",
    "these tidal torques produce a two - armed spiral mode in the otherwise passive disk .",

    "a part of the contradiction can perhaps be explained by the fact that the system modeled by boss and yorke was t  tau , a system at a much later evolutionary stage than l1551  irs5 , with correspondingly different energy output .",

    ", in preparation ) . a prevalence of low order modes ( nelson 2000 ; mayer et al .",
    "2005 ; boss 2006b ) promotes fragmentation , as overdensities that occur on larger scales are easier to resolve with finite resolution .",
    "finally , and perhaps most importantly , short cooling times promote fragmentation ( mayer et al . 2005 ) , while long cooling times prevent it altogether ( nelson 2000 ) .",
    "mayer et al .",
    "( 2005 ) found that binary companions with semimajor axes of 58 au prevented disk fragmentation , unless the disks had moderate masses ( @xmath210 ) and cooled rapidly , indeed faster than even simulations that appeal to convective cooling suggest ( boss 2002 , 2003 ; mayer et al .",
    "they also found that when the semimajor axis was raised to 100 au , fragmentation or transient clump formation resulted in all cases studied .",
    "the results for large separations are not in contrast with those of boss ( 2006b ) . instead , those for separations of 58 au are in disagreement with boss ( 2006b ) , who found fragmentation and transient clump formation even for semimajor axes of both 50 au , although even closer encounters ( i.e. , higher eccentricities ) tended to work against the formation of self - gravitating clumps . the results of mayer et al .",
    "( 2000 ) are not in contrast with those of nelson ( 2000 ) , although nelson s disks were not fragmenting even in isolation according to nelson et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , which does not allow to formulate the same conclusion reached by mayer et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , namely that fragmentation is generally suppressed in tight binary systems .",
    "moreover , we note that most of the disks used by mayer et al .",
    "( 2005 ) were marginally unstable by construction ( @xmath211 ) , and therefore the fragmentation seen for larger semi - major axes might simply reflect the fact that as the separation increases the results tend to converge to those for disks with no binary companion .",
    "this in other words means that the fragmentation seen in such cases could have nothing to do with the tidal perturbation of a companion .",
    "conversely , boss uses mostly disks that would be stable in isolation ( @xmath212 or larger ) , and hence the only logical outcome of his calculations in presence of a companion is either that the disk remain stable or that fragmentation is enhanced ( i.e. no experiment was constructed to see whether fragmentation could be suppressed ) .",
    "this different logic behind the design of the simulations in the two works complicates the comparison and calls for future attempts by these and other authors to perform and compare exactly the same experiment .    .",
    "the box is 200 au on a side , and the system is shown about @xmath213 years after the collapse has been initiated , and a couple of binary orbits after the two disks have formed from the fragmentation of a bar - unstable , rapidly rotating protostellar core .",
    "the larger system weights @xmath214 , while the smaller system weights only @xmath215 .",
    "the total mass of the molecular core was @xmath216 and its size @xmath217 au at t=0 .",
    "the simulation employs @xmath218 particles in total , but the mass resolution in the inner 500 au is higher than in the surrounding volume , so that as many as @xmath219 of the particles are used only in this inner region , height=377 ]    the results of mayer et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and boss ( 2006b ) suggest that the formation of gas giant planets around binary stars with semimajor axes of 100 au or larger may be possible by the disk instability mechanism .",
    "note that for these systems core - accretion is in principle possible as well since spiral shocks do not heat the gas to temperatures high enough to vaporize major dust grain species ( mayer et al .",
    "2005 ) . for smaller semimajor axes the situation is much more complex . for the latter , mayer et al .",
    "( 2005 ) conclude that disk instability is unlikely but that core - accretion might happen once the disk is light enough , @xmath220 ( e.g. as a result of accretion onto the star ) that it can only form weak spiral shocks in which grains easily survive .",
    "this is because in mayer et al .",
    "( 2005 ) the role of self - gravity , and thus of disk mass , in the determining the strength of the spiral shocks is crucial ( see above ) .",
    "nelson ( 2000 ) claimed that both disk instability and core - accretion would be unlikely in such systems , drawing the same conclusion that mayer et al .",
    "( 2005 ) would have reached had they not considered binary systems composed of light disks ( but see above section 4.3 for possible caveats ) .",
    "finally , boss ( 2006b ) finds that these systems would fragment , although he can not follow the clumps for a long enough time to show that they are long lasting . despite the fact that disagreements exist between the different works , it is clear from now that the tightest binary systems might become an ideal testbed for theories of planet formation .",
    "it is thus important for observers to refine their estimates of the semimajor axes of binary systems containing gas giant planets , in order to learn if these systems could have been formed by disk instability .",
    "post - formational orbital evolution of multiple systems ( e.g. , decay of an unstable triple system ) might be another means to explain the observed binary systems with gas giant companions .",
    "finally , we recall that for intermediate semi - major axes orbital eccentricities might also be important . indeed , while mayer et al .",
    "( 2005 ) adopt nearly circular orbits , boss ( 2006b ) chooses eccentric orbits .",
    "hence in boss ( 2006b ) , for a given semi - major axis , the disks will spend a larger fraction of the orbital time far away from each other .",
    "the tidal perturbation will be more impulsive rather than contiunous .",
    "in other fields of astrophysics which deal with similar problems , such as in the study of galaxy interactions , it is well known that impulsive or continuous tidal heating give rise to quite different responses in a self - gravitating system , to the point of determining a completely different structural evolution ( mayer et al . 2001 ) .",
    "what is seen in particular in the case of galaxies is that impulsive encounters can generate `` cold '' features such as bars that then survive for many orbital times , but the same features are erased as the object increases too much its kinetic energy and/or thermal energy owing to a continuous tidal perturbation such as that associated with circular or nearly circular orbits .",
    "similarly , one could speculate that in encounters between disks on eccentric orbits transient overdensities might have a better chance to survive as the same tidal force that triggered their formation fades away later towards the apocenter of the the orbit .",
    "again , simulations exploring a larger parameter space are needed to assess if eccentricity is such an important parameter and might help to partially reconcile the disagreement between boss ( 2006b ) and mayer et al .",
    "disks perturbed by fast - fly bies of other stars or brown dwarfs also suffer significant tidal heating and do not fragment unless the cooling time is very short ( lodato et al .",
    "2007 ) .    a major source of the differences obtained by nelson ( 2000 ) and mayer et al .",
    "( 2005 ) relative to boss ( 2006b ) could be the use of artificial viscosity in the first two works based on sph and its neglect by boss ( 2006b ) the much longer cooling times in nelson ( 2000 ) are also expected to stifle fragmentation . clearly , when artificial viscosity is used to heat a disk , and this heat is unable to escape on an orbital time scale , the chances for clump formation by disk instability are severely reduced .",
    "this is a general issue for the disk instability model , irrespective of the presence or not of a binary companion .",
    "some of the heating associated with artificial viscosity will indeed a rise in nature as a result of turbulence and other unresolved aspects of hydrodynamical flows .",
    "it remains for future work to determine what is the proper amount of artificial viscosity to be used in simulating realistic protoplanetary disks , and to determine the proper boundary conditions at the surfaces of protoplanetary disk that will allow the disk to radiate away energy at the correct rate .",
    "the sensitivity to the cooling time is readily shown by the first in a series of new simulations of binary disks with the algorithm for radiative transfer described in mayer et al . ( 2006 ) .",
    "intermediate mass disks @xmath148 that were fragmenting in binaries in mayer et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , this being the only for which fragmentation was found even for orbits with separations of @xmath161 au at sufficiently short cooling times , develop strong spiral arms but no clumps when flux - limited diffusion plus atmospheric cooling via blackbody radiation is used ( see figure 13 ) .",
    "this is not surprising since this latest radiation physics model yields cooling times of order or slightly longer than the orbital time ( apparently via convection ) while in mayer et al .",
    "( 2005 ) these disks were fragmenting with shorter cooling times , half or less than half the local orbital time . indeed the average outer disk temperatures ( outside 5 au ) in these new simulation is larger than @xmath178 k , in comparison with @xmath221 k in the corresponding run of mayer et al .",
    "the results of this simulation are in good agreement with those of nelson ( 2000 ) .     moving on a binary orbit with average separation of @xmath134 au .",
    "the results are shown after @xmath113 binary orbits .",
    "on the left a run in which the cooling time is fixed to @xmath112 orbital time is shown , on the right a newer run in which flux - limited diffusion is employed and the disk cools at the surface as a blackbody , resulting in a cooling time slightly longer than the orbital time .",
    "clump formation has occurred in the run with the short cooling time while the in other run the two disks have achieved a higher temperature , lower densities and a much weaker spiral structure.,height=226 ]    however , the observational fact that binary stars with separations small enough for mutual tidal interactions to be important are orbited by gas giant planets means that somehow these planets can indeed form even in these systems . given the problems that core accretion encounters as well in binary systems ( thbault et al .",
    "2004 ) , disk instability would seem to remain a possible means for forming gas giants in binary systems .",
