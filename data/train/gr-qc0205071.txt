    "motivated by attempts to quantize gravity , based on the classical theory of general relativity , there has recently been interest in the quantization of `` timeless '' reparametrization - invariant systems , see , for example , refs.@xcite and further references therein .    presently , we begin with the study of a classical system and address the question , whether local observables can be found which allow to characterize the evolution in a gauge invariant way . in previous work",
    "it has always been assumed that the global features of the trajectories are accessible to the observer , which makes it possible , in principle , to express the evolution of an arbitrarily selected degree of freedom `` relationally '' in terms of others @xcite .",
    "thereby the hamiltonian and possibly additional constraints have been eliminated in favour of rovelli s `` evolving constants of motion '' @xcite .    in distinction",
    ", we presently attempt to characterize the evolution by invariant quasi - local statistical properties of the ergodic internal `` clock '' motion .",
    "heuristically , we assume `` time is change '' and try to quantify the former in terms of measurements of the latter .",
    "our results indicate that a ` deparametrized ' time evolution can be constructed based on coarse - graining localized observations in a classical reparametrization - invariant system which is ergodic .",
    "we remark that certain forms of globally incomplete statistical knowledge about a classical system lead to its effective quantization locally @xcite .",
    "this points towards a deterministic origin of quantization and certainly raises further interesting questions about the relation to the problem at hand .",
    "indeed we shall find that the external motion of the particle is described by a ( discrete - time ) schrdinger evolution .",
    "let us consider a fivedimensional model of a `` timeless '' nonrelativistic particle with the action : @xmath0 where the lagrangian is defined by : @xmath1 -\\frac{\\lambda}{2}\\left [ r^2\\omega^2(\\widetilde\\phi_1^{\\;2}+\\widetilde\\phi_2^{\\;2 } ) + 2r^2\\omega^2\\widetilde\\phi_1\\widetilde\\phi_2-e\\right ]   \\;\\;.\\ ] ] here @xmath2 stands for an arbitrary `` lapse '' function of the parameter @xmath3 , @xmath4 denotes an ordinary vector , and @xmath5 and @xmath6 denote the angular variables corresponding to the toroidally compactified dimensions with radius @xmath7 , respectively ; @xmath8 are angular velocity squared coupling parameters .",
    "the parameter e fixes the energy difference between the `` external '' and the compactified `` internal '' degrees of freedom .    suitably redefining the units of length and energy",
    ", we set @xmath9 henceforth .",
    "the notation @xmath10 indicates that the corresponding terms in @xmath11 are periodically continued : @xmath12 for any integer @xmath13 .",
    "thus , a ratchet type potential results in the @xmath14-plane .",
    "alternatively , we may consider the angular variables to be normalized to the square @xmath15 , of which the opposite boundaries are identified , thus describing the surface of a torus with main radii @xmath16 .    the relative minus sign between the kinetic terms allows the energy of the external motion to be unbounded from above .",
    "a similar feature is common to simplified cosmological models in accordance with general relativity , as discussed , for example , in refs.@xcite and references therein .",
    "furthermore , we choose the potential in the compactified dimensions to be unstable , in order to generate a chaotic internal motion which is ergodic and possibly more strongly irregular .    varying the action with respect to @xmath17 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 , we obtain the equations of motion : @xmath18   \\label{phi1 }   \\frac{1}{\\lambda}\\partial_t(\\frac{1}{\\lambda}\\partial_t\\phi_1 ) & = &   ( \\omega^2\\widetilde\\phi_1 + \\omega^2\\widetilde\\phi_2 ) ( 1-\\sum_n\\delta ( \\phi_1-n)\\ ; ) \\;\\ ; , \\\\ [ 1ex ]   \\label{phi2 }   \\frac{1}{\\lambda}\\partial_t(\\frac{1}{\\lambda}\\partial_t\\phi_2 ) & = &   ( \\omega^2\\widetilde\\phi_2 + \\omega^2\\widetilde\\phi_1 ) ( 1-\\sum_n\\delta ( \\phi_2-n)\\ ; ) \\;\\ ; , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the singular terms arise due to the discontinuities of the potential .",
    "variation of @xmath19 with respect to @xmath2 yields the constraint : @xmath20 + \\frac{1}{2}\\left [ \\omega^2(\\widetilde\\phi_1^{\\;2}+\\widetilde\\phi_2^{\\;2 } ) + 2\\omega^2\\widetilde\\phi_1\\widetilde\\phi_2-e\\right ]   = 0\\;\\;,\\ ] ] which will be recognized as a constraint on the hamiltonian momentarily .",
    "the canonical momenta are defined as usual : @xmath21   \\label{pi1 }   \\pi_1&\\equiv&\\frac{\\partial l}{\\partial ( \\partial_t\\phi_1)}=-\\frac{1}{\\lambda}\\partial_t\\phi_1 \\;\\ ; , \\\\ [ 1ex ]   \\label{pi2 }   \\pi_2&\\equiv&\\frac{\\partial l}{\\partial ( \\partial_t\\phi_2)}=-\\frac{1}{\\lambda}\\partial_t\\phi_2 \\;\\;. \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] incorporating these , we obtain the hamiltonian : @xmath22 \\label{h2 }   & = & \\frac{\\lambda}{2}\\left [ \\vec p^{\\;2}-\\left ( \\pi_1^{\\;2}+\\pi_2^{\\;2 } -\\omega^2(\\widetilde\\phi_1^{\\;2}+\\widetilde\\phi_2^{\\;2 } ) -2\\omega^2\\widetilde\\phi_1\\widetilde\\phi_2\\right ) -e\\right ] \\;\\equiv\\;\\lambda c \\;\\;. \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in terms of @xmath23 , eq.([constraint ] ) implies the primary constraint : @xmath24 which is a weak equality in the sense of dirac s formalism of constraint systems @xcite .",
    "consequently , the hamiltonian presents a weak constraint , @xmath25 .    finally , in hamiltonian form",
    ", the equations of motion ( [ q])([phi2 ] ) read : @xmath26   \\label{hphi1 } \\partial_t\\pi_1&=&-\\lambda   ( \\omega^2\\widetilde\\phi_1 + \\omega^2\\widetilde\\phi_2 ) ( 1-\\sum_n\\delta ( \\phi_1-n)\\ ; ) \\;\\ ; , \\\\ [ 1ex ]   \\label{hphi2 }   \\partial_t\\pi_2&=&-\\lambda   ( \\omega^2\\widetilde\\phi_2 + \\omega^2\\widetilde\\phi_1 ) ( 1-\\sum_n\\delta ( \\phi_2-n)\\ ; ) \\;\\;. \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] employing these equations and the definition of the constraint @xmath23 in eq.([c ] ) , it follows by explicit calculation that it does not evolve .",
    "consistently , this is also obtained by : @xmath27 employing the poisson bracket notation , @xmath28 , where a sum over all coordinates and canonical momenta , represented by @xmath29 and @xmath30 , is understood .",
    "therefore , no secondary constraints exist in our model .",
    "we conclude that the system has four physical degrees of freedom . its extended phase space , cf .",
    "ref.@xcite , is tendimensional , corresponding to the lagrangian variables in eq.([l ] ) and the associated canonical momenta .",
    "it is , however , reduced to a ninedimensional surface by the constraint .",
    "since the physical phase space is eightdimensional , there must be one `` gauge '' degree of freedom , which is related to the reparametrization invariance .",
    "the study of this gauge symmetry and its consequences will be performed in section2 , while the gauge invariant description of the evolution will be developed in section3 . in section4",
    "we demonstrate that under certain conditions the external motion of the particle can be mapped onto an evolution according to the schrdinger equation .",
    "we conclude with a brief discussion .",
    "we observe indeed that the action is invariant under the set of gauge transformations : @xmath31 where @xmath32 .",
    "corresponding infinitesimal transformations are generated by : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is infinitesimal .",
    "this yields immediately : @xmath35 \\label{inflambda } \\delta\\lambda&\\equiv&\\lambda ( t')-\\lambda ' ( t')=-\\partial_{t'}[\\epsilon ( t')\\lambda ( t ' ) ] \\;\\;. \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] employing the definitions of the canonical momenta , eqs.([p])([pi2 ] ) , we obtain from eq.([infx ] ) : @xmath36   \\label{infphi12 } \\delta\\phi_{1,2 }   & = & \\epsilon\\lambda\\pi_{1,2 }      \\;\\;. \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] similarly , with the help of eqs.([hq])([hphi2 ] ) , we obtain : @xmath37 \\label{infpi1 } \\delta\\pi_1   & = & \\epsilon\\lambda    ( \\omega^2\\widetilde\\phi_1 + \\omega^2\\widetilde\\phi_2 ) ( 1-\\sum_n\\delta ( \\phi_1-n)\\ ; ) \\;\\ ; , \\\\ [ 1ex ] \\label{infpi2 } \\delta\\pi_2   & = & \\epsilon\\lambda   ( \\omega^2\\widetilde\\phi_2 + \\omega^2\\widetilde\\phi_1 ) ( 1-\\sum_n\\delta ( \\phi_2-n)\\ ; ) \\;\\;.",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] comparing with the equations of motion , we see that the evolution of the coordinates and momenta is generated by the gauge transformations .",
    "obviously , the three - momentum @xmath38 is conserved , in accordance with translation invariance .",
    "its components present three gauge invariant observables which may serve as coordinates of the physical phase space .",
    "another invariant is provided by the internal contribution to the constraint : @xmath39 cf .",
    "eqs.([h2])([c ] ) ; since the constraint does not evolve , i.e. is invariant , as well as @xmath40 , this also holds for @xmath41 .",
    "however , being related via the constraint , @xmath41 is not independent of @xmath38 .",
    "the angular momentum suggests itself as a further observable , @xmath42 due to rotational invariance .",
    "clearly , @xmath43 .",
    "as expected , the external motion plays a rather passive role in our system , since it can be almost completely described in terms of the conserved linear and angular momenta .",
    "it only contributes with its kinetic energy to the constraint @xmath23 .",
    "however , note that @xmath38 and @xmath44 together determine only the two constant components of @xmath17 transverse to @xmath38 , i.e. @xmath45 .",
    "therefore , in order to predict the evolution of the coordinate @xmath17 , we need to construct a reference `` clock '' , such that the longitudinal component of eq.([p ] ) is well determined , when integrated : @xmath46 this is one of the objectives of the following section .",
    "furthermore , we remark that we so far obtained five gauge invariant coordinates ( @xmath38 , @xmath45 ) for the eightdimensional physical phase space plus one constraint ( @xmath23 , or @xmath41 ) , which allows to eliminate one more of the remaining four internal variables ( @xmath47 ) . due to the intrinsic nonlinearity of the gauge tranformations , eqs.([infq])([infpi2 ] ) , we are unable to find further invariants in the general , interacting case .",
    "this motivates our attempt to construct other , statistical observables , in order to obtain an invariant , even if coarse - grained description of the physical phase space .",
    "in order to proceed , we make the crucial assumption that our model forms an ergodic system @xcite .",
    "we also restrict the allowed lapse functions @xmath2 to be ( strictly ) positive , thus avoiding trajectories which trace themselves backwards ( or stall ) @xcite .    in the following",
    ", we will consider quantities @xmath48(c_i)$ ] which are functionals only of the trajectory determined by the coordinates @xmath14 and possibly depend parametrically on further constraints involving only them . while some explicit examples will be studied in detail , generally speaking , we have quantities in mind which reflect properties of poincar sections of the full trajectories .",
    "naturally , we require the constraints @xmath49 to transform as the coordinates under the gauge transformations ( [ gauge ] ) , i.e. @xmath50 .",
    "it follows that such quantities are gauge invariant , since they depend only on geometrical properties of a path and related constraints .",
    "being independent of the momenta , they do not depend on how the trajectory is parametrized : @xmath51(c_i')=n[\\phi_{1,2}](c_i)$ ] .",
    "thus , they qualify as coarse - grained observables characterizing the internal motion .",
    "our aim is to construct a timelike variable based on such observables . in the following first subsection",
    "we do this based on the idea that the geometric path length covered by the system evolving from an initial to a final state is an invariant measure of the `` time '' that passed .",
    "the crucial point is that this measure can be inferred in an ergodic system approximately from coarse - graining localized observations , provided we understand the dynamics sufficiently well .    in the second subsection , however , considering the interacting nonlinear system , we generalize this approach , in order to extract a `` time '' from quasi - local measures of the `` change '' occurring while the system evolves . in particular",
    ", we will employ a maximum - entropy method together with the fisher - rao information metric , in order to characterize the distance , i.e. the `` time '' passed , between evolving probability distributions .",
    "we point out that our approach is somehow orthogonal to the one of ref.@xcite , although we make use of its formalism . there",
    "the author launches the ambitious project to derive dynamics from rules of inference and the maximum - entropy principle in particular .",
    "we instead assume the reparametrization - invariant dynamics to be given and construct a pertinent notion of `` time '' .      illustrating our approach , we begin with the noninteracting case , i.e. , with @xmath52 . even without interactions , the internal motion is ergodic for almost all initial conditions .",
    "in particular , if the ratio of the two independent angular velocities is not a rational number , then , for sufficiently late times @xmath3 , the trajectory will come arbitrarily close to any point on the surface of the torus .",
    "this is easily seen in its parametric representation , eq.([phirelat ] ) below . in 1",
    "we show a typical example .",
    "the equations of motion immediately yield the solutions : @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 denote the initial coordinates and momenta , respectively ; of course , @xmath56 . eliminating the integral of the lapse function , we obtain , for example , @xmath6 in terms of @xmath5 : @xmath57 following refs.@xcite , this is a gauge invariant `` relational '' description of the motion : @xmath58 gives the value of coordinate @xmath6 , when ( ` the time is such that ' ) @xmath5 has the value @xmath59 . in this way , @xmath5 may serve as a time variable , even if not a unique one .",
    "however , similarly as in the models studied previously , there is additional information about the full path , which is necessary to complete this description . in the present case",
    ", the solution ( [ phirelat ] ) presents a line in the @xmath14-plane , unwrapping the motion which multiply covers the torus .",
    "thus , when folding it back onto the torus , one has to keep track of which unit square in the plane a respective piece is coming from .",
    "this can be labelled by two integers @xmath60 , which may be interpreted as the winding numbers characterizing additionally a given point @xmath61 on the path .",
    "obviously , this presents highly nonlocal ( topological ) information , which will be unavailable for a local observer under more realistic circumstances , such as in the presence of nonlinear interactions .",
    "therefore , we turn to statistical measures of the motion on the torus .",
    "consider the `` incident number '' @xmath62 which counts the number of times that a given trajectory @xmath63 , cuts the @xmath5-axis in the neighbourhood of the observer , i.e. , with @xmath64 $ ] and @xmath65 , subject to the constraint that the total path length equals @xmath11 , taking into account the wrapping around the torus .",
    "due to ergodicity and assumed nonnegative lapse functions , @xmath66 is a stepwise increasing function of @xmath3 , while @xmath67 are of sawtooth type , with details depending on the particular parametrization .",
    "the reparametrization - invariant value of @xmath66 , however , only depends on the path length ; thus , it implicitly involves nonlocal information .",
    "the incident number @xmath66 presents a very simple example of the coarse - grained observables discussed before .",
    "there exists an unlimited number of different such counting observables .",
    "the more of them we introduce and measure , the more detailed will be our reparametrization - invariant description of the internal motion .",
    "we will also use the incident number @xmath68 which is defined like @xmath66 , however , with the roles of coordinates `` 1 '' and `` 2 '' exchanged .",
    "furthermore , we may consider one incident number as a parametric function of the other : @xmath69 where @xmath70 is fixed , while the total path length @xmath11 is the implicit common variable .",
    "note that @xmath71 is unique , since we take the respective maximum of @xmath68 , which may increase while @xmath66 stays constant temporarily .    however , the constraint on a given path length is irrelevant for the actual values assigned to @xmath66 and @xmath71 .",
    "one operationally determines them by counting the localized incidents , with @xmath72 $ ] , and recording one incident number as a function of the other ; no knowledge of the path length is required .",
    "nevertheless , these reparametrization - invariant numbers can be used to determine the corresponding path length by a statistical consideration , since we have sufficient knowledge of the dynamics of the system in the present ( integrable ) case .    in the absence of interactions the path is composed of straight line segments .",
    "we denote the average length of these segments by @xmath73 .",
    "it can be calculated easily due to ergodicity : @xmath74^{1/2}}{\\pi_1^{(0)}+\\pi_2^{(0 ) } } \\equiv\\frac{[2e_{int}]^{1/2}}{\\pi_1^{(0)}+\\pi_2^{(0 ) } } \\;\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath75 denotes the conserved internal energy , cf .",
    "eqs.([h2 ] ) and ( [ cint ] ) . here",
    "we employed eq.([phirelat ] ) and averaged the straight - line paths with the asymptotically uniform density over the square @xmath15 , choosing coordinates such that @xmath76 .",
    "now , each increment of @xmath66 or @xmath71 ( i.e. @xmath68 ) by one unit corresponds to the completion of one line segment . due to the finite window size @xmath77 ,",
    "however , only a corresponding fraction of all incidents happening on both coordinate axes will be recorded on the average .",
    "correcting for this , invoking ergodicity as before , the path length @xmath11 which leads to the measured incident numbers is simply obtained by : @xmath78 where @xmath79 is _ along _ the curve of the function @xmath80 .",
    "practically , what appears on the right - hand side is the total registered incident number ( @xmath81 ) at a certain instant .    in this way",
    ", we obtain a measure of the `` time '' interval @xmath82 during which @xmath83 incidents occurred : @xmath84^{1/2 }   \\;\\;,\\ ] ] i.e. , dividing the path length by the constant velocity .",
    "the point of this rather trivial example is that nowhere do we make use of the time parametrizing the evolution nor of the generally unknown path length .",
    "rather , we derive @xmath82 from reparametrization - invariant localized measurements .",
    "not surprisingly , the resulting `` time '' will not run smoothly , due to the coarse - grained description of the internal motion : as if we were reading an analog `` clock '' under a stroboscopic light .",
    "this is precisely the role of a poincar section with respect to the increasing invariant path length of an evolving trajectory .    in order to illustrate the behavior of the `` time '' @xmath82 ,",
    "it is convenient to introduce the fictitious proper time ( function ) : @xmath85 then , keeping the notation as simple as possible , with @xmath86 for @xmath87 , we obtain : @xmath88 .",
    "applying this transformation to the definition of the canonical momenta and the equations of motion , the lapse function can be eliminated ; this replaces @xmath3 by @xmath89 and @xmath2 by 1 in eqs.([p])([pi2 ] ) and eqs.([hq])([hphi2 ] ) , respectively .",
    "the resulting equations are reparametrization - invariant . solutions of these equations are to be interpreted ` physically ' by introducing the inverse function @xmath90 and @xmath91 @xcite .    integrating the free internal motion with respect to the proper time , which replaces the integral in eq.([phifree ] ) by @xmath89 , we show @xmath82 as a function of @xmath89 in 2a ) and 2b ) . for the two runs differing in the total ( computer ) time @xmath89",
    ", we find that after a short while , i.e. already at low incident numbers , the constructed physical `` time '' @xmath82 approximates qualitatively well the proper time @xmath89 .",
    "the fluctuations on top of the observed linear dependence naturally reflect the stochastic internal motion .",
    "the fact that the slopes are consistently smaller than one can be attributed to the bias towards longer - than - average pieces of trajectory , which is introduced by measuring the incidents close to the origin and extrapolating from there , see eqs.([lav ] ) and ( [ l ] ) .",
    "finally , employing the reparametrization - invariant `` time '' , which runs approximately parallel to the unphysical proper time , @xmath92 ( @xmath93 constant ) , we succeed to describe the external motion with respect to the physical internal `` clock '' constructed here . recalling that the external motion is given by eq.([qevol ] )",
    ", we obtain : @xmath94 .",
    "interestingly , the coarse - grained ` jumpiness ' of @xmath82 introduces a corresponding stochastic component into the external motion .",
    "this would be recognized , if global relational data or results of increasingly fine - grained local measurements were available , with which to compare the change of @xmath95 .",
    "we will further study the consequences of this stroboscopic effect in section4 .",
    "now we consider the case of the internal motion on the torus with the interactions ( @xmath96 ) turned on .",
    "the interactions additionally mix the trajectories in phase space , since the potentials are of inverted oscillator type . slightly simplifying the ensuing calculations",
    ", we set @xmath97 henceforth .",
    "this leaves the motion parallel to the diagonal @xmath98 exponentially unstable , while the orthogonal motion is free . a typical trajectory for the case of still relatively weak interaction is shown in 3 .",
    "the microstates of the internal part of the system can be described by the phase space coordinates @xmath99 .",
    "however , in general , we will not be able to follow the deterministic evolution through sequences of microstates for any sufficiently complex nonlinear system .",
    "therefore , we develop a coarse - graining statistical approach based on probability distributions .",
    "let @xmath100 denote the expected number of microstates in the volume element @xmath101 at @xmath102 .",
    "then , we may characterize macrostates of the system by giving their coordinates @xmath103 in the @xmath13-dimensional state space : @xmath104 with @xmath105 denoting the relevant set of observables .",
    "it is assumed that all information necessary to answer our particular questions about the system is encoded in these observables @xcite .",
    "the conserved internal energy , see eq.([cint ] ) , presents an important observable : @xmath106 where we absorbed an inessential factor 2 into the definition for convenience .",
    "then , the ` prior ' distribution @xmath107 which best reflects our mostly lacking information about the state of the system , given the conserved energy , is obtained by maximizing the entropy : @xmath108\\equiv -\\int\\mbox{d}x\\;p(x)\\ln p(x ) \\;\\;,\\ ] ] subject to the constraint @xmath109 , with this constant being fixed by the initial conditions .",
    "the result is the canonical distribution : @xmath110 with the partition function @xmath111 and lagrange multiplier @xmath112 , respectively , to be calculated from : @xmath113 where @xmath114 .",
    "thus we recover expressions which are familiar from statistical mechanics .",
    "straightforward calculation yields the partition function : @xmath115 where @xmath116 denotes its configurational factor .",
    "it is given here in terms of the integral : @xmath117   & = & \\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{\\beta\\omega^2}}\\left ( ( a+b)\\;\\mbox{erfi}((a+b)\\sqrt{\\beta\\omega^2 } ) -a\\;\\mbox{erfi}(a\\sqrt{\\beta\\omega^2 } ) -b\\;\\mbox{erfi}(b\\sqrt{\\beta\\omega^2})\\right )   \\nonumber \\\\ [ 1ex ] \\label{jintegral1 } & \\;&-\\frac{1}{2\\beta\\omega^2}\\left ( e^{(a+b)^2\\beta\\omega^2}-e^{a^2\\beta\\omega^2 } -e^{b^2\\beta\\omega^2}+1\\right ) \\\\ [ 1ex ]   & = & ab\\left ( 1+\\beta\\omega^2[\\frac{1}{3}a^2+\\frac{1}{2}ab+\\frac{1}{3}b^2]\\right .",

    "we will make more use of this integral in the following .",
    "for example , incorporating the small-@xmath112 expansion , we calculate the relation between @xmath119 and @xmath112 : @xmath120 \\;\\;,\\ ] ] using eqs.([zbeta ] ) , ( [ zconf ] ) , and ( [ jintegral2 ] ) . here",
    "the error in comparison with the exact result rapidly decreases with energy and is less than @xmath121 for @xmath122 .",
    "we are presently interested in the positive energy regime , since only there the trajectories can explore all of the torus surface , cf .",
    "eq.([hint ] ) .    in order to improve the prior distribution @xmath123 with the help of quasi - local measurements , we again consider simple observables for illustration .",
    "we define two `` window functions '' : @xmath124 with @xmath125 ; @xmath126 is defined by the analogous expression with @xmath5 and @xmath6 exchanged .",
    "thus @xmath127 and @xmath126 project out small rectangles along the @xmath5- and @xmath6-axis , respectively , which do not overlap .",
    "here we explicitly introduced the small but finite window width @xmath34 , which in any case is necessary for a correct counting of incidents in numerical simulations with a finite resolution . in the following",
    "we will adapt to the present case the measurement of incident numbers .",
    "we decompose the prior distribution with respect to the windows determined by @xmath127 and @xmath126 : @xmath128p_c(x|h_{int})+[1-{\\cal i}_1(x)-{\\cal i}_2(x)]p_c(x|h_{int } ) \\nonumber \\\\ [ 1ex ] \\label{decomp } & \\equiv&p_w'(x|h_{int})+\\bar p_w(x|h_{int } ) \\;\\;.",

    "then , the distribution @xmath133 which best reflects the information contained in the prior distribution @xmath134 and in the data from measurements of the window functions is obtained by maximizing the entropy @xcite : @xmath135\\equiv -\\int\\mbox{d}x\\;[{\\cal i}_1(x)+{\\cal i}_2(x)]p(x)\\ln \\frac{p(x)}{p_w(x|h_{int } ) } \\;\\;,\\ ] ] subject to the constraints : @xmath136 here we determine the average of the incident functions , i.e. the ( total ) probabilities of observing an incident in the respective windows , in terms of the measured incident numbers .",
    "this obviously presents a crude coarse - graining .",
    "an improved description is obtained , for example , by binning the incident numbers with respect to the main axis of each window .",
    "many , more detailed measurements can be envisaged , but the simplest ones will suffice here .",
    "it is straightforward to show that this procedure yields a grand - canonical distribution : @xmath137 e^{-\\beta { \\cal h}_{int}(x)-\\alpha_1{\\cal i}_1(x)-\\alpha_2{\\cal i}_2(x ) } \\;\\;,\\ ] ] where , in this case , the partition function and lagrange multipliers are determined by : @xmath138 e^{-\\beta { \\cal h}_{int}(x)-\\alpha_1{\\cal i}_1(x)-\\alpha_2{\\cal i}_2(x ) } \\nonumber \\\\ [ 1ex ]   \\label{z } & = & \\int\\mbox{d}x\\;[{\\cal i}_1(x)\\lambda_1+{\\cal i}_2(x)\\lambda_2 ] e^{-\\beta { \\cal h}_{int}(x ) }   \\;\\ ; , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] introducing the fugacities @xmath139 , and : @xmath140 together with the constraints ( [ iconstraints ] ) . here @xmath112 is considered to be a known feature of the prior distribution @xmath123 , previously determined in eq.([eintbeta ] ) .",
    "the present situation differs in an important way from the usual one in statistical mechanics , where @xmath119 and @xmath141 would _ all _ correspond to conserved quantities and be treated on an equal footing . presently , the ( window functions related to the ) incident numbers are evolving quantities which we measure , in order to learn about the change occurring in the system .    the grand - canonical partition function can be calculated directly , resulting in : @xmath142   \\;\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath143 is the configurational factor of this partition function .",
    "furthermore , we obtain : @xmath144 which implies @xmath145 .",
    "we set @xmath146 , with a common ( undetermined ) constant @xmath23 . incorporating these results ,",
    "the distribution follows : @xmath147 } { j(\\delta , \\epsilon ) -j(\\epsilon , \\epsilon ) } e^{-\\beta { \\cal h}_{int}(x ) }   \\;\\;,\\ ] ] using @xmath148 and cancelling the common factor @xmath23 .",
    "finally , re - normalizing @xmath149 and using the resulting distribution in place of @xmath130 , cf .",
    "eq.([decomp ] ) , we obtain the properly normalized distribution for the whole phase space : @xmath150 p_c(x|h_{int})+[1-{\\cal i}_1(x)-{\\cal i}_2(x)]p_c(x|h_{int } ) \\;\\;,\\ ] ] which is updated by measuring the incident numbers @xmath151 and employing eq.([iconstraints ] ) .    with the distribution at hand , we could proceed similarly as in the previous section3.1 , trying to estimate the average path length related to the increasing incident numbers in particular , in order to gain a measure of the change taking place in the system .    however , in the following we proceed differently , in a way which appears more suitable to further generalization .",
    "we introduce the fisher - rao information metric for the purpose of quantifying the change due to the chaotic , even if deterministic motion from one configuration to the next @xcite .",
    "it is the uniquely determined riemannian metric ( except for an overall multiplicative constant ) on the space of states which are probability distributions @xcite . in our present case",
    "the states are simply described by the pair of coordinates @xmath152 $ ] , considering the coordinate @xmath119 to be fixed at a constant value .",
    "then , the ` distance ' @xmath79 between the states @xmath153 and @xmath154 is given by : @xmath155 with the metric : @xmath156   \\label{metric2 }   & = & 2\\frac{j(\\delta , \\epsilon ) -j(\\epsilon , \\epsilon ) } { j(1,1)}(q^i)^{-1}\\delta_{ij } \\;\\ ; , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] employing eqs.([pc ] ) , ( [ zconf ] ) , ( [ jintegral ] ) , and particularly eq.([pfinal ] ) in the explicit calculation .",
    "note that the coordinates , being probabilities , are constrained by @xmath157 , which further simplifies the result obtained here .",
    "however , we would like to express eqs.([fisherrao])([metric2 ] ) in terms of the directly measured incident numbers .",
    "thus , with the help of eqs.([iconstraints ] ) , we obtain : @xmath158 \\label{deltas2 } & = & 2\\frac{j(\\delta , \\epsilon ) -j(\\epsilon , \\epsilon ) } { j(1,1)(i_1+i_2 ) } \\left ( \\sqrt{\\frac{i_2}{i_1}}\\delta i_1+\\sqrt{\\frac{i_1}{i_2}}\\delta i_2\\right ) \\;\\ ; , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the second equality is due to the dichotomous character of the pair of increments @xmath159 and @xmath160 ; i.e. , we have @xmath161 , however , the two increments present the results of two mutually exclusive measurements which can not happen in coincidence .",
    "several remarks are in order here .",
    "first , the eq.([deltas2 ] ) is invariant under the similarity transformation @xmath162 and @xmath163 .",
    "thus , generally , the amount of  change per incident \" decreases inversely with the total number of incidents , i.e. , loosely speaking , with the age of the evolution going on .",
    "this seems natural in a statistical context , but less familiar in the context of dynamics , where we are accustomed to a linearly flowing time .",
    "second , the dichotomous increments of the incident numbers can be mapped on a binary sequence of zeros and ones , for example , according to @xmath164 and @xmath165 .",
    "then , the number of zeros and ones in the produced bitstring is simply related to @xmath166 and @xmath167 , respectively . thus , one could compare the behavior of the function @xmath168 with corresponding ones for different dynamical models or with randomly generated sequences .",
    "third , the statistical factors in the results of eqs.([metric2])([deltas1 ] ) , encoding the dynamics , are nicely factorized from the quantities incorporating the evolving observables @xmath66 and @xmath68 ; an analogous factorization is seen in eq.([t ] ) .",
    "we believe that the very simple structure of our results is indeed of a more general kind and similarly will be encountered , whenever one succeeds to identify pairs of dichotomous observables , which somehow reflect the symmetry of the system .",
    "furthermore , the generalization involving n - tuples of exclusive observables can be worked out along these lines .",
    "coming back to the construction of a reparametrization invariant `` time '' @xmath82 , we now set : @xmath169 with @xmath170 , i.e. stretching the time with an extra factor @xmath83 , in order to compensate for the aging of the measure @xmath168 , which we mentioned .",
    "furthermore , we divide out the square - root - of - energy factor , which is determined by the initial conditions .",
    "this results in a scaling with energy , similarly as in section3.1 . at high energy @xmath119 , eq.([hint ] ) , equals ( two times ) the kinetic energy , which might seem more appropriate here . however , it is by itself not a reparametrization invariant quantity in the present interacting case .",
    "we calculate the `` time '' passed by accumulating the time steps @xmath171 .",
    "the constant , though energy dependent , overall prefactor contained in the result of eq.([ts ] ) is set equal to one , recalling that the fisher - rao metric which enters here , see eqs.([fisherrao])([metric2 ] ) , is unique only up to a constant factor .",
    "the 4 shows the resulting behavior of the parametrization invariant `` time '' @xmath82 as a function of the proper time @xmath89 , eq.([tau ] ) , which is also incorporated in the present numerical simulations .",
    "for the two initial conditions , differing in the initial velocities , we observe the expected scaling with energy . furthermore , while the size of individual fluctuations is comparable to what was found in the noninteracting case of 2 , we notice here characteristic deviations from the average linear dependence over longer proper time scales .",
    "such nonlinear behavior becomes even more prominent in 5 , with long time excursions .    in any case",
    ", this demonstrates the existence of a monotonous `` time '' function also for the present more strongly irregular system , as compared to the ergodic ( but integrable ) one of section3.1 .",
    "presumably , an approximately linear dependence will only become recognizable for much longer runs , i.e. for larger incident numbers . on the other hand , of course",
    ", the statistical construction of @xmath82 based on quasi - local observables could be refined by considering a higher - dimensional state space from the outset , cf .",
    "eq.([qc ] ) , i.e. incorporating more observables .",
    "this completes our discussion of two examples of the construction of a coarse - grained parametrization invariant evolution parameter .",
    "it seems worth while to draw attention to a possible connection between the present subject and the _ deterministic classical systems which are effectively quantum mechanical _ , as recently discussed by thooft , see ref.@xcite and further references therein .",
    "the total number of incidents obtained from our exclusive observables always increases by one .",
    "these are the `` ticks of the clock '' , numbered by @xmath172 . however , via the constructed `` time '' sequence @xmath173 , the proper times @xmath174 vary irregularly , in general , due to the quasi - periodic internal motion",
    ". therefore , the free external motion , @xmath175 , shows stochastic behavior in terms of @xmath82 .",
    "we emphasize that @xmath176 here is _ not _ directly related to @xmath177 introduced in eq.([tau ] ) .",
    "let us assume that we could exhaust all possible _ invariant quasi - local observables _ and can not further resolve the `` time between the incidents '' marking @xmath82 and @xmath178 .",
    "that there arises a discreteness in the optimal `` time '' sequence generated in this way in a generic nonintegrable system @xcite seems plausible for two reasons .",
    "first , by realistically restricting the observables to be localized near to the observer , we loose information about the full trajectories in coordinate space .",
    "second , by insisting on gauge invariant observables , we loose the possibility to make use of additional momentum space observables ( except for a possible limited number of constants of motion ) , or higher proper time derivatives , in order to reconstruct the full trajectories and a smooth evolution parameter based on them .    anyhow",
    ", for given initial conditions , the incident counts as well as the coordinates @xmath179 present discrete physical data which are deterministically determined in our model .",
    "( the constant orthogonal components are of no interest here . )",
    "then , the question arises , can we still give an invariant meaning to and predict the future of the free external motion , instead of letting the system evolve and measuring ? - in general , the answer is ` no ' , since neither the future discrete values of @xmath82 , see eq.([ts ] ) , for example , nor the value of @xmath89 at those future instants will be predictable .",
    "however , motivated by the two practical examples of section3 , we introduce the notion of a well - behaved `` time '' , which will be sufficient to maintain some predictability indeed .",
    "well - behaved `` time '' _ @xmath82 be such that the onedimensional motion of a free particle , co - ordinated in a reparametrization - invariant way by the sequence @xmath180 , is of limited variation : @xmath181   & \\;&\\longleftrightarrow\\;\\;\\exists\\;\\bar\\tau , \\delta\\tau:\\ ; \\bar\\tau n-\\delta\\tau\\leq\\tau ( t_n)\\leq\\bar\\tau n+\\delta\\tau\\;,\\;\\;\\forall n\\in{\\mathbf",

    "n } \\;\\ ; , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath182 , and where @xmath183 denote the initial data .",
    "this is the next - best we can expect from a reasonable `` time '' , motivated by newtonian physics here .",
    "it is important to realize that there is no hope for continuity or periodicity , since our construction of @xmath82 is based generally on the ergodicity of a quasi - periodic process and related poincar sections .",
    "assuming a well - behaved `` time '' , we see that the sequence of points @xmath180 can be mapped into a regular lattice of possibly overlapping cells of size @xmath184 and spacing @xmath185 .",
    "`` as the clock ticks '' , i.e. @xmath186 , the particle moves from one cell to the next . on the average",
    "this takes a proper time @xmath187 and physical `` time '' @xmath188 . here",
    "we assume for convenience that @xmath189 itself is of limited variation , @xmath190 .",
    "in the simplest example , in section3.1 , we have @xmath191 and @xmath192 , showing a dependence on the initial momenta and the scale of localization of the observed incidents .",
    "thus , for a well - behaved `` time '' sequence ( of limited variation ) , we have mappings from `` clock ticks '' to ( `` time '' as well as ) space intervals .",
    "we identify the space intervals , containing the respective @xmath193 , with _ primordial states _ : @xmath194 in order to handle the subtle limit of an infinite system , we impose reflecting boundary conditions and distinguish left- and right - moving states . finally ,",
    "then , the evolution is described by the deterministic rules : @xmath195 \\label{r2 }    \\;\\ ; , \\\\ [ 1ex ] \\label{r3 }    \\;\\ ; , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath196 states in all , @xmath197 ; states with a negative ( positive ) label correspond to left- ( right-)moving states , according to negative ( positive ) particle momentum . reaching the states @xmath198 or @xmath199 ,",
    "the particle changes its direction of motion .",
    "the rules ( [ r1])([r3 ] ) can altogether be represented by a unitary evolution operator : @xmath200 which acts on the @xmath196-dimensional vector composed of the primordial states ; the overall phase factor is introduced for later convenience . here @xmath188 is the natural scale for the hamiltonian @xmath201 .    in the following analysis",
    "we apply thooft s method , who considered the discrete and strictly periodic motion of a classical particle on a circle , introducing a hilbert space based on the primordial states @xcite .",
    "the evolution operator turns out to be diagonal with respect to the discrete fourier transforms of the states @xmath202 .",
    "we define the basis functions : @xmath203 they present a complete orthonormal basis , since @xmath204 , with @xmath205 , and noting that @xmath206 .",
    "this yields indeed : @xmath207/n )   \\;\\leftrightarrow\\;\\langle m'|u|m\\rangle = \\delta_{m'm}\\exp ( -\\frac{2\\pi i}{2s+1}[s+m+\\frac{1}{2 } ] )   \\;\\;,\\ ] ] where the equivalence follows from @xmath208 and relabeling and replacing the states @xmath209 by states @xmath210 , with @xmath211 and @xmath212 .",
    "the phase factor of eq.([u ] ) contributes the additional terms which assure a positive definite ( bounded ) spectrum similar to the harmonic oscillator case .",
    "recalling the algebra of @xmath213 generators , and with @xmath214 in particular , we obtain the hamiltonian : @xmath215 i.e. , diagonal with respect to @xmath210-states of the half - integer representations determined by @xmath59 .",
    "continuing with standard notation , we have @xmath216 , which suffices to obtain the following identity : @xmath217 furthermore , using @xmath218 , we introduce coordinate and conjugate momentum operators : @xmath219 where @xmath220 and @xmath221 are complex coefficients . calculating the basic commutator with the help of @xmath222=2s_z$ ] and using eq.([hdiag ] ) , we obtain : @xmath223=i(1-\\frac{\\bar t}{\\pi}h ) \\;\\;,\\ ] ] provided we choose @xmath224 . incorporating this choice ,",
    "we calculate : @xmath225 in order to obtain a reasonably simple hamiltonian in the infinite system limit ( @xmath226 ) , we finally choose : @xmath227 then , defining @xmath228 , the previous eq.([hsq ] ) becomes : @xmath229 showing a nonlinearly modified harmonic oscillator hamiltonian at this stage , which corresponds to the result of ref.@xcite .",
    "following our construction of the reparametrization - invariant `` time '' , we presently keep @xmath188 finite while considering the infinite system limit .",
    "thus , for @xmath226 , we have @xmath230 and obtain : @xmath231 which has the low - energy limit @xmath232 . on the other side ,",
    "the energy is bounded from above by @xmath233 , since we have @xmath234 ( @xmath235 , for @xmath226 , when diagonalized ) .",
    "interestingly , towards the upper bound the violation of the basic quantum mechanical commutation relation , as calculated in eq.([commutator ] ) , becomes maximal , i.e. , there @xmath236 and @xmath237 commute and behave like classical observables .",
    "we conclude here with calculating the matrix elements of the operators @xmath236 and @xmath237 between primordial states . relating the primordial states @xmath202 to the @xmath210-states with the help of eq.([kbasis ] ) and using @xmath238^{1/2}|m\\pm 1\\rangle$ ] , we obtain : @xmath239   & \\ ; &   \\cdot\\sum_{m =- s}^{s}\\exp ( \\textstyle{\\frac{2\\pi i}{2s+1}(n'-n)(m-1/2 ) } ) [ s(s+1)-m(m+1)]^{1/2 } \\;\\;.",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for large @xmath59 the summation is replaced by an integral .",
    "then , using eqs.([qp ] ) and ( [ ab ] ) , the results are ( @xmath226 ) : @xmath240    \\label{pmatrix }   ( n'|p|n)&=&\\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{\\frac{\\bar t}{\\pi}}\\frac{j_1(\\pi ( n'-n))}{n'-n }   \\;\\ ; , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath241 denotes an ordinary bessel function of the first kind .",
    "thus , neither the position nor the momentum operator is diagonal in the basis of the primordial states .    in any case , we find here once more an emergent quantum model based on a deterministic classical evolution , similar as in ref.@xcite .",
    "the interesting feature presently is that the construction of a reparametrization - invariant `` time '' based on quasi - local observables naturally induces the particular stochastic features in the behavior of the external particle motion .",
    "the remaining predictable aspects of its motion can then most simply be described by a unitary discrete - time quantum mechanical evolution .",
    "our construction of a reparametrization - invariant `` time '' is motivated by the observation that `` time passes '' when there is an observable change , which is localized with the observer .",
    "more precisely , necessary are incidents , i.e. observable unit changes , which are recorded , and from which invariant quantities characterizing the change of the evolving system can be derived .",
    "a basic ingredient is the assumption of ergodicity , such that the system explores dynamically the whole allowed energy surface in phase space . generally , then there will be sufficiently frequent usable incidents next to the observer .",
    "we illustrate this in section3 with a simple timeless model of a nonrelativistic particle moving classically in five dimensions , of which two internal ones are compactified to form a torus . defining suitable window functions , localized observations of incidents correspond here to the trajectory passing by the window .",
    "thus , the incidents reflect properties of the dynamics with respect to ( subsets of ) poincar sections .",
    "roughly , the passing `` time '' corresponds to the observable change there .    in the first example in",
    "section3.1 the dynamics is very simple and even integrable @xcite . we know that the system is ergodic in this case and use this fact , in order to calculate statistically , based on quasi - local incident counts , the invariant path length run by the system .",
    "this provides an invariant measure of `` time '' .",
    "we find that the proper time is linearly related to this , however , subject to stochastic fluctuations .",
    "in the second example , section3.2 , we have additional interactions which mix the trajectories in a much more complicated way .",
    "we assume that the system is ergodic .",
    "our statistical formalism then allows to measure the change of the phase space distribution which is updated by the information coming from the incident counts .",
    "essential ingredient is the fisher - rao information metric @xcite .",
    "this calculation again provides an invariant `` time '' function , which behaves qualitatively similar as in the previous example , however , with characteristic long - time deviations from an average linear relation to proper time",
    ".    it will be interesting to generalize the present model to relativistic systems , as well as to generalize the statistical formalism .",
    "a related question is , which are the ( discrete ) limitations of such a construction of `` time '' based on localized observables , i.e. how close can one get to a linearly flowing newtonian time , in a generic nonintegrable system .    finally , we pointed out in section4 a possible connection of the present subject to the study of quantum mechanical systems which have an underlying deterministic classical dynamical model @xcite .",
    "indeed , we find that for certain `` well - behaved time sequences '' the remaining deterministic aspects of the induced stochastic classical motion of the ( in our model ) external particle can be most simply described by a discrete - time quantum mechanical schrdinger evolution .",
    "this `` stroboscopic quantization '' may arise under more general circumstances , if one insists to construct by statistical means an invariant `` time '' from localized observables .",
