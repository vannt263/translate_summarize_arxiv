    "since the 2012 discovery of a standard model ( sm)-like higgs boson at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc )  @xcite , there has been considerable interest in models with extended higgs sectors to be used as benchmarks for lhc searches for physics beyond the sm .",
    "one such model is the georgi - machacek ( gm ) model  @xcite , which adds isospin - triplet scalar fields to the sm in a way that preserves custodial su(2 ) symmetry .",
    "its phenomenology has been extensively studied  @xcite .",
    "the gm model has also been incorporated into the scalar sectors of little higgs  @xcite and supersymmetric  @xcite models , and an extension with an additional isospin doublet  @xcite has also been considered .",
    "the gm model has the interesting feature that the coupling strengths of the sm - like higgs boson @xmath3 to @xmath4 or @xmath5 boson pairs can be larger than in the sm . and @xmath6 couplings above their sm strength while preserving custodial su(2 ) symmetry can also be obtained in higher - isospin generalizations of the gm model  @xcite or in an extension of the higgs sector by an isospin septet with appropriately - chosen hypercharge  @xcite .",
    "] such an enhancement is not possible in higgs - sector extensions that contain only isospin doublets or singlets . in light of the upcoming lhc data - taking period during which higher - precision measurements of the sm - like higgs boson couplings and searches for additional higgs states will be pursued , it is timely to revisit the indirect constraints on the gm model from @xmath0-physics and electroweak precision data .",

    "we point out that the dominant one - loop contributions of the additional gm higgs bosons to nonoblique @xmath5-pole observables and to @xmath0-physics observables can be taken over directly from calculations in the type - i two - higgs - doublet model ( 2hdm )  @xcite .",
    "we use this fact to determine for the first time the constraints on the gm model from @xmath1 , @xmath9@xmath10 mixing , and @xmath11 . for @xmath1 , we adapt the numerical implementation for the 2hdm in the public code superiso  v3.3  @xcite . for @xmath12 , we make use of a new calculation of @xmath13  @xcite in the aligned 2hdm  @xcite . of these observables , we find that @xmath1 provides the strongest constraint , though it may be surpassed in the near future as the precision on the lhc measurement of the @xmath11 branching fraction improves .",
    "we also provide an analytic formula for the @xmath7 parameter in the gm model in the approximation that the new scalars are heavy compared to the @xmath5 mass .",
    "we then examine the effect of these indirect constraints on the accessible ranges of the sm - like higgs boson couplings .",
    "we find that simultaneous enhancements of the @xmath14 , @xmath6 , and @xmath15 couplings above their sm value are still allowed , and could simultaneously enhance the sm - like higgs boson production cross sections in all production modes by up to 39% .",
    "because the lhc measures higgs production rates only in particular higgs - decay final states , it could be blinded to such an enhancement by the presence of new unobserved higgs decay modes that would suppress the higgs branching ratios into detectable final states .",
    "disentangling these effects will be a major phenomenological and experimental challenge at the lhc . can be made with no reference to the higgs decay branching ratios by using the recoil mass method ; see , e.g. , ref .",

    "the gm model provides a concrete example of a model that violates the second assumption while being consistent with other experimental constraints .",
    "the flat direction could also be tamed by constraining the total higgs width through measurements of off - shell @xmath288  @xcite ; the interpretation of this measurement in terms of a higgs width constraint , however , is itself model - dependent  @xcite and it is not yet clear what effect the presence of additional higgs states will have .    crucially , however , the simultaneous enhancement of @xmath267 and @xmath268 occurs only when the new scalars are relatively light .",
