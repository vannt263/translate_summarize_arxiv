    "in the mott - insulating limit of a transition metal oxide the low - energy physics can be described by kugel - khomskii - type models @xcite , where both spin and orbital degrees of freedom undergo joint quantum fluctuations and novel types of spin - orbital order @xcite or disorder @xcite may emerge . following the microscopic derivation from the multiorbital hubbard model , the generic structure of spin - orbital superexchange takes the form of a generalized heisenberg model @xcite , @xmath3 as indeed found not only for the simplest systems with @xmath4 spins : kcuf@xmath5 @xcite , the rtio@xmath5 perovskites @xcite , linio@xmath6 and nanio@xmath6 @xcite , sr@xmath6cuo@xmath5 @xcite , or alkali ro@xmath6 hyperoxides @xcite , but also for larger spins as e.g. for @xmath7 in lamno@xmath5 @xcite .",
    "in such models the parameters that determine the spin-@xmath8 heisenberg interactions stem from orbital operators @xmath9 and @xmath10  they depend on the bond direction and are controlled by the orbital degree of freedom which is described by pseudospin operators @xmath11 .",
    "that is , these parameters are not necessarily fixed by rigid orbital order @xcite , but quantum fluctuations of orbital occupation @xcite may strongly influence the form of the orbital operators , particularly in states with spin - orbital entanglement ( soe ) @xcite . as a consequence , amplitudes and even the signs of the effective exchange can fluctuate in time .",
    "such entangled spin - orbital degrees of freedom can form new states of matter , as for instance the orbital - peierls state observed at finite temperature in yvo@xmath5 @xcite .",
    "another example are the collective spin and orbital excitations in a one - dimensional ( 1d ) spin - orbital chain under a crystal field which can be universally described by fractionalized fermions @xcite .",
    "it is challenging to ask which measure of soe would be the most appropriate one to investigate quantum phase transitions in such systems .",
    "the subject is rather general and it has become clear that entanglement and other concepts from quantum information provide a useful perspective for the understanding of electronic matter @xcite .",
    "other examples of entangled systems are : topologically nontrivial states @xcite , relativistic mott insulators with @xmath12 ions @xcite , ultracold alkaline - earth atoms @xcite , and skyrmion lattices in the chiral metal mnsi  @xcite .",
    "one well - known characterization of a quantum system is the entanglement entropy  ( ee ) determined by bipartitioning a system into @xmath13 and @xmath14 subsystems .",
    "this subdivision can refer for example to space @xcite , momentum @xcite , or different degrees of freedom such as spin and orbital @xcite .",
    "a standard measure is the von neumann entropy ( vne ) , @xmath15 , for the ground state @xmath16 which is obtained by integrating the density matrix , @xmath17 , over subsystem @xmath14 .",
    "another important measure is the entanglement spectrum ( es ) introduced by li and haldane @xcite , which has been explored for gapped 1d spin systems @xcite , quantum heisenberg ladders @xcite , topological insulators @xcite , bilayers and spin - orbital systems @xcite .",
    "the es is a _ property of the ground state _ and basically represents the eigenvalues @xmath18 of the reduced density matrix @xmath19 obtained by bipartitioning of the system .",
    "interestingly a correspondence of the es and the tower of excitations relevant for su(2 ) symmetry breaking has been pointed out recently @xcite .",
    "it was also noted that the es can exhibit singular changes , although the system remains in the same phase @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the es has less universal character than initially assumed @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we explore a different entanglement measure , namely the vne spectrum which monitors the vne of ground and _ excited states _ of the system , for instance of a spin - orbital system as defined in equation ( 1 ) . in this case",
    "we consider the entanglement obtained from the bipartitioning into spin and orbital degrees of freedom in the entire system @xcite . here",
    "the vne is obtained from the density matrix , @xmath20 , by taking the trace over the orbital degrees of freedom ( tr@xmath21 ) for each eigenstate @xmath22 .",
    "we show below that the vne spectrum , @xmath23 reflects the changes of soe entropy for the different states at phase transitions .",
    "the excitation energies , @xmath24 , of eigenstates @xmath22 are measured with respect to the ground state energy @xmath25 .",
    "it has already been shown that the vne spectra uncover a surprisingly large variation of entanglement within elementary excitations @xcite . also certain spectral functions have been proposed , that can be determined by resonant inelastic x - ray scattering @xcite , and provide a measure of the vne spectral function .",
    "here we generalize this function to arbitrary excitations @xmath22 , i.e. , _ beyond _ elementary excitations which refer to a particular ground state .",
    "we demonstrate that focusing on general excited states opens up a new perspective that sheds light on quantum phase transitions and the entanglement in spin - orbital systems .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in we introduce the 1d spin - orbital model with ferromagnetic exchange , and in we present its phase diagrams for the ising limit of orbital interactions and for the anisotropic su(2)@xmath0 model with enhanced ising component .",
    "soe is analyzed in using both the spin - orbital correlation function and the entanglement entropy and we show that these two measures are equivalent . in we present the entanglement spectra and discuss their relation to the quantum phase transitions . the main conclusions and summary are given in .",
    "the distance dependence of spin correlations in the antiferromagnetic phase is explored in the appendix .",
    "the motivation for our theoretical discussion of spin - orbital physics comes from @xmath26 electron systems in which orbital quantum fluctuations are enhanced by an intrinsic reduction of the dimensionality of the electronic structure @xcite .",
    "examples of strongly entangled quasi-1d @xmath26 spin - orbital systems due to dimensional reduction are well known and we mention here just latio@xmath5 @xcite , lavo@xmath5 and yvo@xmath5 @xcite , where the latter two involve @xmath27 orbitals along the @xmath28 cubic axis ; as well as @xmath29 and @xmath30 orbital systems in 1d fermionic optical lattices @xcite .",

    "here we explore in more detail the competition of the antiferromagnetic ( af ) spin correlations of the spin - orbital chain in the as / ao phase iii and the majumdar - ghosh like spin - singlet dimer correlations that coexist at finite @xmath41 , as we found in our work . for @xmath50",
    "the spin correlations in phase iii are those of an af heisenberg spin chain , @xmath144 which reveal the typical @xmath70-power law decay combined with logarithmic corrections that were first predicted by conformal field theory @xcite as well as by renormalization group methods @xcite , and subsequently confirmed @xcite by numerical density matrix method @xcite .",
    "equation ( [ sij ] ) versus the inverse distance @xmath70 as obtained for a spin - orbital ring ( [ som ] ) with @xmath72 sites , for : ( a ) @xmath50 , and ( b ) @xmath54 .",
    "parameter : @xmath91.,width=415 ]    in figure [ fig : s0sr](a ) we present our numerical data for the spin - correlation function @xmath145 equation ( [ sij ] ) ( i.e. , for translational invariant ground states ) for several values of @xmath44 , and for @xmath50 and @xmath91 . in the @xmath50 case",
    "there are only two distinct types of behaviour of @xmath145 , namely exponential decay in phase v and the power law decay of the 1d quantum nel spin liquid state , which are the same in phases ii and iii .",
    "equation ( [ sij ] ) for increasing distance @xmath146 as obtained for the spin - orbital model equation ( [ som ] ) on a ring of @xmath72 sites for @xmath54 , @xmath91 , and three values of @xmath44 .",
    "exponential decay of @xmath104 with increasing @xmath146 is obtained for phase v ( @xmath147).,width=434 ]    figure [ fig : s0sr](b ) displays @xmath145 at @xmath54 for different @xmath44-values . here",
    "again the unperturbed af correlations of the 1d nel spin - liquid state appear in phase ii ( @xmath148 ) .",
    "it is evident that in phase iii the af spin correlations are strongly reduced , due to the competition with the coexisting long - range ordered spin - singlet correlations .",
    "the spin singlet order increases with @xmath44 in phase iii , and as a consequence we observe here that the decay of @xmath145 becomes stronger as @xmath44 approaches the iii / v transition .    in figure",
    "[ fig : logfit ] we present a logarithmic plot which highlights the different decays of @xmath145 for @xmath54 in the three different phases : iii , v , and ii .",
    "we have selected the values for @xmath149 , @xmath150 and @xmath151 , respectively , for greater transparency .",
    "the log - plot shows clearly the exponential decay of @xmath145 in phase v. it also shows that the @xmath72 system reveals strong finite size effects in phase ii where @xmath145 has power law decay .",
    "nevertheless it is clear already from the @xmath72 data that the af spin correlations in phase iii ( here shown for @xmath149 ) are strongly suppressed and approach the exponential decay of @xmath145 in phase v ( @xmath152 and 0.6 ) when @xmath44 approaches the iii - v phase boundary from the left .    summarizing",
    ", we find that in phase iii the af spin correlations of the 1d nel spin liquid state decay much more rapidly as the competing spin - singlet order emerges .",
    "this effect is particularly strong near the boundary of phase iii to the spin - singlet dimer phase v. whether in the thermodynamic limit the correlations @xmath145 also decay exponentially in phase iii as in v can not be decided here , and this question is beyond the scope of the present work ."
