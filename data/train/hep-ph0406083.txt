    "many independent measurements provide convincing evidence that most of the matter in the universe is dark , i.e. non  baryonic and of unknown nature , the most common dark matter ( dm ) candidate being a weakly  interacting massive particle ( wimp )  @xcite .",
    "supersymmetric ( susy ) extensions of the standard model ( sm ) naturally predict a massive weakly interacting particle ( wimp ) called neutralino ( @xmath0 ) , which , in most versions of susy models , is the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) , and is made stable by virtue of the conservation of r  parity .",
    "dark matter searches are often discussed in the very popular msugra , _",
    "a.k.a _ cmssm ( constrained mssm ) , model  @xcite where one assumes unification of the soft susy breaking parameters at the gut scale .",
    "this assumption is essentially a reduction of the parameter space and has no real theoretical motivation .",
    "more refined susy models have been studied in the context of dm searches , relaxing the hypothesis of universality @xcite .",
    "here we focus on effective string inspired models , which represent a possible consistent framework linking fundamental high energy theory with low energy physics .",
    "recently , the full one loop soft supersymmetry breaking terms , in a large class of superstring effective theories , have been calculated  @xcite , based on orbifold compactifications of the weakly  coupled heterotic string ( including the so  called anomaly mediated contributions ) . the parameter space in this class of models has already been severely constrained taking into account accelerator and relic density constraints @xcite , direct or indirect detection of dm from the sun @xcite , or benchmark models at the tevatron @xcite . in this model ,",
    "supersymmetry breaking is transmitted by the auxiliary ( @xmath1 ) fields of the compactification moduli @xmath2 , whose expectation values determine the size of the compact manifold , or by the dilaton auxiliary field @xmath3 , whose vacuum expectation value determines the magnitude of the coupling constant @xmath4 .",
    "the spectrum and couplings of susy particles depend crucially on the contributions of each hidden fields to the breaking mechanism .",
    "there exist many ways of probing the existence of neutralino dark matter and supersymmetry .",
    "of course , accelerator searches are among the most promising ones .",
    "recent results give a mass limit of 45 gev for the lightest neutralino , in the framework of msugra @xcite .",
    "furthermore , interesting constraints have been derived from many experiments on direct and indirect detection of dark matter , whose sensitivities are expected to increase by orders of magnitude in the near future ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "direct detection is made via the measurement of the recoil energy of the nuclei of the detector after an elastic scattering with a wimp .",
    "indirect detection experiments look for the products of annihilation of the lsp in the sun , galactic halo or external galaxies ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it has been emphasized in @xcite that one  ton detectors are needed for direct searches to test all the parameter space in scenarios dominated by the dilaton @xmath5breaking terms , and that moduli dominated scenarios are generically not detectable by dark matter searches ( direct or indirect detection with neutrinos coming from the sun ) if we combine favored relic density and accelerator constraints .",
    "this means that such dm searches could be a way to distinguish the origin(s ) of the susy breaking mechanism , and to restrict or even determine some fundamental parameters of the model ( of stringy nature or not ) .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to investigate dm indirect detection with high energy gamma rays and synchrotron radiation from neutralino annihilation at the galactic center , in the class of weakly coupled heterotic string models discussed above @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : after a brief survey on the motivations , phenomenology and construction of the effective string models studied here , we analyze in section 2 and 3 the influence of the different coefficients parameterizing the susy breaking , on the gamma - ray and synchrotron emission from the galactic center . in section 4 ,",
    "we analyze the prospects of observation of gamma - ray fluxes with present and foreseen experiments and discuss synchrotron radiation in section 5 .",
    "we present our conclusions in section 6 .",
    "the task of string phenomenology is to make contact between the high energy string theory , and the low energy world . for this purpose",
    ", we need to build a superstring theory in four dimensions , able to reproduce the standard model gauge group , three generations of squarks , and a coherent mechanism of susy breaking .",
    "we set our analysis in the framework of orbifold compactifications of the heterotic string , within the context of supergravity effective theory , we focus on models where the action is dominated by 1loop contributions to soft breaking terms . the key property of the models is the non  universality of soft terms , consequences of the beta ",
    "function appearing in the superconformal anomalies .",
    "this non  universality gives a peculiar phenomenology in the gaugino and the scalar sector , modifying considerably the predictions of msugra models .",
    "in fact , these string  motivated models show a new behavior , that interpolates between the phenomenology of unified supergravity models ( msugra ) and models dominated by the superconformal anomalies ( amsb ) .",
    "the constraints arising from accelerator searches , and some dark matter aspects ( direct and neutrino indirect detections ) have been already studied in @xcite .",
    "we extend here the analysis to gamma - ray and synchrotron emission from the galactic center .",
    "we provide a phenomenological study within the context of orbifold compactifications of the weakly  coupled heterotic string , where we distinguish two regimes :    * in the first one , the susy breaking is transmitted by the compactification moduli @xmath2 , whose vacuum expectation values determine the size of the compact manifold .",
    "generic ( 0,2 ) orbifold models contain three @xmath6 moduli fields .",
    "we considered a situation in which only an `` overall modulus @xmath7 '' field contributes to the susy  breaking .",
    "the use of an overall modulus @xmath7 is equivalent to the assumption that the three @xmath6 fields of generic orbifold models give similar contributions to susy  breaking .",
    "this is expected in the absence of some dynamical effect that would strongly discriminate the three moduli . * in the second case , it is the dilaton field @xmath3 present in any four  dimensional string ( whose vacuum expectation value determine the magnitude of the unified coupling constant @xmath4 at the string scale ) , that transmits , via its auxiliary component , the susy breaking .",
    "we work in the context of models in which string nonperturbative corrections to the khler potential act to stabilize the dilaton in the presence of gaugino condensation @xcite .",
    "the origin of the soft breaking terms are completely different in the two scenarios .",
    "some are coming from the superconformal anomalies and are non  universal ( proportional to the beta  function of the standard model gauge groups ) , others are generated in the hidden sector ( from green  schwarz mechanism or gaugino condensation ) and are thus universal .",
    "this mixture between universality and non  universality gives the richness of the phenomenology in this type of effective string models and confirms the interest of non  universal studies in the prospect of supersymmetric dark matter detection , non  universality being in this case connected with the basic properties of the model .",
    "in all the models considered here , the lightest neutralino is the lsp .",
    "its phenomenology ( mainly the couplings and the spectrum ) is determined by its mass matrix , @xmath8    written in the ( @xmath9 ) basis , where , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 represents respectively the b ",
    "ino , w  ino and down , up  higgsinos fields .",
    "@xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the bino , wino , and higgs  higgsino mass parameters respectively .",
    "tan@xmath17 is the ratio of the @xmath18 of the two higgs doublet fields .",
    "this matrix can be diagonalized by a single unitary matrix @xmath19 such that we can express the lsp as    @xmath20    the parameter @xmath16 is obtained under the requirement that the electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) takes place .",
    "this is done by computing the complete one  loop corrected effective potential .",
    "the effective @xmath16term is calculated from the ewsb condition after minimization of the scalar potential    @xmath21    the sign of @xmath16 is not determined and left as free parameter .",
    "we clearly see that the nature of the neutralino ( and its couplings ) depends crucially on the hierarchy between the parameters @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 .      in the moduli dominated scenario , the one loop order supersymmetric susy breaking terms at gut scale can be written @xcite :    @xmath22g_2(t,{\\overline{t } } ) f^{t } + \\frac{2}{3}b_{a}{\\overline{m } } \\rbr , \\label{modsoftgaugi}\\\\ a_{ijk}&= & - \\frac{1}{3 } \\gamma_{i}{\\overline{m } } - p \\gamma_{i } g_2(t,{\\overline{t } } ) f^{t } + { \\rm cyclic}(ijk ) , \\\\",
    "m_{i}^{2 } & = & ( 1-p)\\gamma_i \\frac{|m|^2}{9}. \\label{modsoftscal}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the soft masses for the gauginos and scalars and @xmath25 , the trilinear coupling .",
    "@xmath26 is the beta ",
    "function coefficient for the gauge group @xmath27 :    @xmath28    where @xmath29 , @xmath30 are the quadratic casimir operators for the group @xmath27 in the adjoint representation and in the representation of the field @xmath31 respectively . @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the auxiliary fields for the dilaton and the khler modulus , respectively , @xmath34 is the supergravity auxiliary fields whose vacuum expectation value ( @xmath18 ) determines the gravitino mass @xmath35 , and @xmath36 is the green  schwarz coefficient which is a ( negative ) integer between @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the function @xmath39 is proportional to the eisenstein function and vanishes when @xmath7 is stabilized at one of its two self  dual points . from eq.([modsoftgaugi ] ) , it follows that when the moduli are stabilized at a self dual point , only the second term contributes to gaugino masses .",
    "this is precisely the `` anomaly mediated '' contribution .",
    "the loop contributions have been computed using the pauli ",
    "villars ( pv ) regularization procedure .",
    "the pv regular fields mimic the heavy string modes that regulate the full string amplitude .",
    "the phenomenological parameter @xmath40 which represents the effective modular weight of the pv fields is constrained to be not larger than @xmath41 , though it can be negative in value .",
    "thus the scalar squared mass for all matter fields is in general non  zero and positive at one loop ( only the higgs can have a negative running squared mass ) .",
    "the limiting case of @xmath42 , where the scalar masses are zero at one loop level and for which we recover a sequestered sector limit , occurs when the regulating pv fields and the mass  generating pv fields have the same dependance on the khler moduli .",
    "another reasonable possibility is that the pv masses are independent of the moduli , in which case we would have @xmath43 . and",
    "@xmath44 is related to the anomalous dimension through @xmath45 .",
    "( see @xcite for notations and conventions )    we clearly see in these formulae the competition between universal terms and non  universal ones .",
    "the scalar mass terms are all non  universal and proportional to their anomalous dimension and thus loop suppressed .",
    "the green - schwarz mechanism generates universal breaking terms for the gauginos ( proportional to @xmath36 ) whereas superconformal anomalies introduce non  universal contributions ( proportional to @xmath26 ) .",
    "the nature of the neutralino thus depends mainly on the value of the green  schwarz counterterm @xmath36 , whereas the mass scale is the gravitino mass @xmath46 .",
    "we illustrate in figs.[fig : mchi - oh2-dgs ] the neutralino mass and its relic density as a function of @xmath47 , vertical directions correspond to different values of @xmath46 .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "we apply the following conservative cuts on our models :    * higgs mass : @xmath48 gev @xcite , * chargino mass : @xmath49 gev @xcite , * relic density : @xmath50 , but we also show the wmap  @xcite range @xmath51 , * @xmath52 constraint @xcite : + @xmath53 , * the muon anomalous magnetic moment @xcite : @xmath54 $ ] .",
    "for our computations we have interfaced suspect@xcite , micromegas@xcite and darksusy@xcite .    concerning mssm renormalization group equations and radiative electroweak symmetry breaking we use the code suspect .",
    "it includes 2-loops rge evolution from high scale down to low energy scale ( we took @xmath55 @xcite ) and minimizes the 1-loop scalar potential by solving iteratively the condition        we then transfer all mssm parameters to the code micromegas which calculates the full physical mass spectrum including radiative corrections on higgs masses and widths .",
    "the calculation of neutralino relic density is then achieved following the iterative procedure described in  @xcite and including all annihilation and co - annihilation processes by solving      where @xmath58 is the abundance at the temperature @xmath7 , @xmath59 a degrees of freedom coming from thermodynamics , @xmath60 the newton constant and @xmath61 the thermally average cross section of all processes concerning @xmath58 .",
    "masses and couplings are then entered in darksusy which calculates the indirect detection rates of species @xmath62 coming from the galactic centre for a chosen galactic halo profile by splitting the particle physics dependance ( @xmath63 , @xmath64 including here only annihilations ) and the astrophysics part _ i.e _ the integration along the line of sight ( @xmath65 , @xmath66 being the dark matter density distribution ) .",
