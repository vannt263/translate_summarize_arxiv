    "accretion disc is an important physical object in astrophysics . the standard model of thin accretion disc is widely regarded as a successful model for explaining the observational features in active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and x - ray binaries ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) .",
    "however , the standard disk model can not explain the spectral energy distributions ( sed ) of many sources , such as sgr a@xmath1 . to understand such systems ,",
    "the model of advection dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) is introduced ( ichimaru 1977 ; narayan & yi 1994 ) . in this",
    "accretion flows , the energy released due to dissipation processes is retained in the fluid rather than being radiated away .",
    "the models of adaf place an intermediate position between the spherically symmetric accretion flow of non - rotating fluid ( bondi 1952 ) and the cool , thin disc of classical accretion disc theory ( e. g. pringle 1981 ) .",
    "the observational evidence of accretion flows imply that outflow is an important property in these systems .",
    "for example , comparison of the accretion luminosities of neutron stars and white dwarfs in quiescence with similar binary companions implies that the accretion rate onto white dwarfs is larger by three orders of magnitude than that on the surface of neutron star ( loeb et al .",
    "this indicates significant outflows in accretion flows .",
    "moreover , outflows seem to be common in the nuclei of galaxies .",
    "marrone et al .",
    "( 2006 ) suggested the accretion rate of sgr a@xmath1 at small radii , much smaller than the bondi radius , must be low , below @xmath2 . while , baganoff et al .",
    "( 2003 ) estimated the hot plasma surrounding sgr a@xmath1 should supply the accretion rate of @xmath3 at the bondi radius .",
    "this significant difference between the inner and outer mass accretion rates indicates mass loss from the accretion flow due to the outflow ( kawabata & mineshige 2009 ) .",
    "thus , the accretion discs in the presence of outflow have been studied by several authors ( knigge 1999 ; fukue 2002 , 2004 ; shadmehri 2008 ; xie & yuan 2008 ; kawabata & mineshige 2009 ; bu et al . 2009 ; li & cao 2009 ; abbassi et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "knigge ( 1999 ) derived the radial distribution of dissipation rate and effective temperature across a keplerian , steady - state , mass losing accretion disc , using a simple , parametric approach that is sufficiently general to be applicable to many types of dynamical disc - wind models .",
    "fukue ( 2002 ) examined a hydrodynamical wind , which emanates from an accretion disc and is driven by thermal and radiation pressure , under an one - dimensional approximation along supposed streamlines . in another study ,",
    "fukue ( 2004 ) studied a supercritical accretion regime , where the mass accretion rate was regulated just at the critical rate with the help of wind mass - loss .",
    "he derived a critical radius that outside of it , the disc is in a radiation - pressure dominated standard state , while inside this radius the disc is in a critical state , where the excess mass is expelled by wind , and the accretion rate is kept being just at the critical rate at any radius inside of critical radius .",
    "shadmehri ( 2008 ) studied the effects of thermal conduction and outflows on adafs .",
    "he found that in comparison to accretion flows without winds , the disc which rotates faster and becomes cooler because of the angular momentum and energy flux which are taking away by the winds .",
    "xie & yuan ( 2008 ) , based on one - and - a - half - dimensional description of the accretion flow , considered the interchange of mass , radial and azimuthal momentum , and the energy between the outflow and inflow .",
    "( 2009 ) presented the self - similar solutions for adafs with outflows and ordered magnetic fields .",
    "they assumed the magnetic field has a strong toroidal component and a vertical component in addition to a stochastic component .",
    "they found that the dynamical properties of adafs can be significantly changed in the presence of ordered magnetic fields and outflows .",
    "abbassi et al .",
    "( 2010 ) examined the effects of a hydrodynamical wind on adafs in the presence of a toroidal magnetic field under a self - similar treatment .",
    "their results implied that in the presence of the wind , the disc temperature decreases due to energy flux , which is taken away by winds and the accretion velocity enhances .",
    "the importance of magnetic diffusivity has been studied in several accreting systems , such as the protostellar discs ( stone et al .",
    "2000 ; fleming & stone 2003 ) , discs in dwarf nova systems ( gammie & menou 1998 ) , the discs around black holes ( kudoh & kaburaki 1996 ) , and galactic centre ( melia & kowalenkov 2001 ; kaburaki et al .",
    "moreover , two and three - dimensional mhd simulations have shown that resistive dissipation is one of the crucial processes that determines the saturation amplitude of the magnetorotational instability ( mri ) . as , the linear growth rate of mri can be reduced significantly due to the suppression by ohmic dissipation ( sano et al .",
    "1998 ; fleming et al .",
    "2000 ; masada & sano 2008 ) .",
    "moreover , from comparison of ideal and resistive mhd simulations , it seems the magnetic diffusivity may play an important role in astrophysical outflows ( fendt & emelji 2002 ; emelji et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "as mentioned , semi - analytical studies of adafs with outflow are typically related to systems without magnetic diffusivity . while , non - ideal mhd simulations imply that the resistivity plays an important role on outflows ( e. g. fendt & emelji 2002 ; emelji et al .",
    "akizuki & fukue ( 2006 ) proposed a self - similar solution for adafs with a highly ionized gas .",
    "thus , they assumed that the plasma resistivity is zero , and only viscosity is due to turbulence and dissipation in the disc .",
    "also , they ignored the effects of outflow / wind in their model . in this paper ,",
    "we want to explore the effects of the resistivity on magnetized adafs in the presence of outflows .",
    "thus , we adopt the presented solutions by knigge ( 1999 ) , akizuki & fukue ( 2006 ) , and shadmehri ( 2008 ) . the paper is organized as follow . in section 2 ,",
    "the basic equations of constructing a model for adaf in the presence of toroidal magnetic field , resistivity and outflows will be defined . in section 3 ,",
    "self - similar method for solving equations , which govern the behavior of the accreting gas will be used .",
    "results of the present model are brought in sections 4 and 5 .",
    "the summary of the model will appear in section 6 .",
    "we consider a non - ideal magnetohydrodynamics of steady , axisymmetric , viscous , accreting and rotating flow in presence of a purely toroidal magnetic field .",
    "we use a cylindrical coordinate ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 ) centred on the accreting object .",
    "we ignore the general - relativistic effects and use newtonian gravity . under these assumptions , the continuity equation is @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the radial velocity , @xmath9 is the surface density of the disc , @xmath10 and @xmath11 being the mid - plane density and half - thickness of the disc , respectively , and @xmath12 is the mass loss rate by outflow / wind .",
    "the half - thickness of the disc is given by @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the keplerian angular velocity , @xmath15 is the sound speed , @xmath16 is defined below in equation ( 9 ) .",
    "it will be reduced to its traditional form of @xmath17 in absence of the toroidal component of magnetic field ( @xmath18 ; equation 8) .",
    "the sound speed is defined as @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the gas pressure .",
    "the cumulative mass - loss rate from the disc can be written as @xmath21 where @xmath22 denotes the radius at the inner edge of the disc and @xmath23 is the mass - loss rate per unit area from each disc face . since the mass accretion rate is @xmath24 , from the equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) ,",
    "we can write @xmath25 above equation implies that the mass accretion rate varies by radius due to outflow .",
    "thus , we exploit a power - law dependence for mass accretion rate as follows ( e.g. blandford & begelman 1999 ) @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the radius at the outer edge of the disc , @xmath28 is the mass accretion rate at @xmath27 , and @xmath29 is a free parameter , which for a disc without outflow / wind , @xmath30 and in the presence of the outflow / wind , @xmath31 ( e.g. fukue 2004 ) .",
    "the observed broad - band spectra of sgr a@xmath1 and soft x - ray transients can also be fitted by adaf models with moderate outflows , @xmath32 ",
    "@xmath33 , if the direct heating of electrons in adafs is efficient ( quataert & narayan 1999 ; yuan et al .",
    "2003 ) . equations ( 1)-(4 ) imply that @xmath34 the radial equation of momentum is @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the angular velocity of the flow and @xmath37 is alfven speed , which is defined as @xmath38 , @xmath39 being the magnetic pressure .",
    "the angular momentum transfer equation with consideration of the outflow / wind can be written as ( e.g. knigge 1999 ) @xmath40 where the two terms on the right - hand side of above equation describe the effects of viscous torques due to shear ( @xmath41 , which is the effective kinematic viscosity ) and the angular momentum sink provided by the outflow . here , it will be assumed that matter outflowed at radius @xmath4 on the disc carries away specific angular momentum @xmath42 .",
    "thus , @xmath43 corresponds to a non - rotating disc wind and @xmath44 to outflowing material that carries away the specific angular momentum it had at the point of outflow ( knigge 1999 ) .",
    "the hydrostatic balance in the vertical direction is integrated to @xmath45=(1+\\pi ) c_s^2.\\ ] ] here , we introduce the parameter @xmath16 by @xmath46 which is the degree of magnetic pressure to the gas pressure .",
    "since we will apply a steady self - similar method to solve system equation , this parameter will be constant throughout the disc . really , this parameter is a function of position and time ( machida et al .",
    "2006 ; oda et al .",
    "2007 ; khesali & faghei 2008 , 2009 ) . studies of hot accretion flows represent the typical value of @xmath16 lies in the range @xmath47-@xmath48 ( de villiers et al .",
    "2003 ; beckwith et al .",
    "2008 ) , but here we also consider the magnetically dominated case ( @xmath49 ) . because , mhd simulation by machida et al .",
    "( 2006 ) shows as thermal instability grows in an accretion flow , the magnetic pressure exceeds the gas pressure due to the disc shrink in the vertical direction and conservation of the toroidal magnetic flux .",
    "this will result in large @xmath16 and forms a magnetically dominated accretion flow ( oda et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "we assume both of the viscosity and the diffusivity are due to turbulence in the disc , so that it is reasonable to use these parameters in analogy to the @xmath0-prescription of shakura & sunyaev ( 1973 ) for the turbulent @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the magnetic prandtl number of the turbulence assumed a constant of order of unity , @xmath52 is the magnetic diffusivity , and @xmath0 is a free parameter less than unity .    here , we can write the energy equation considering energy balance in the system . we will assume the energy released due to viscous and resistive dissipations can be balanced by the advection cooling and energy loss of outflow ( e.g. shadmehri 2008 ) .",
    "thus , @xmath53\\\\ -\\frac{1}{2 } \\xi \\dot{m}_w(r ) v_k^2(r),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath54 is a constant less than unity and is called advection parameter .",
    "the parameter @xmath54 measures how much the flow is advection - dominated ( narayan & yi 1994 ) .",
    "the first two terms on the right - hand side of above equation represent the energy generated due to viscous and resistive dissipation , respectively .",
    "the resistive dissipation is derived by @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the current density . moreover , the last term on the right - hand side of energy equation is the energy loss due to wind or outflow . depending on the energy loss mechanism , dimensionless parameter @xmath57 may change .",
    "we consider it as a free parameter of our model so that larger @xmath57 corresponds to more energy extraction from the disc due to the outflows ( knigge 1999 ; shadmehri 2008 ) .",
    "the creation / escape rate of the magnetic field can be described by dynamo and diffusion .",
    "we define the advection rate of the toroidal magnetic field as ( oda et al .",
    "2007 ) @xmath58 which is used instead of the induction equation .",
    "since we study a steady - state accreting system , the above quantity will be constant in absence of the dynamo and the diffusion effects .",
    "this quantity can vary with radius due to the presence of the dynamo / diffusion effect ( machida et al .",
    "2006 ; oda et al .",
    "2007 ) . in the present model",
    ", we expect the magnetic flux advection rate varies with radius due to the presence of resistivity .",
    "we will consider this property in next section .",

    "figure 1 shows that for non - zero @xmath29 , surface density is lower than the standard adaf solution and for stronger outflows this reduction of surface density is more evidence .",
    "we can see that adaf with wind rotates more quickly than those without winds and lead to enhance accretion velocity .",
    "the solution shows that temperature decreases for stronger outflows . on the other hand ,",

    "moreover , figure 3 represents that the radial and rotational velocities increase with the magnitude of @xmath16 .",
    "increase in the radial velocity is due to the magnetic tension term dominates the magnetic pressure term in the radial momentum equation , which assists the radial velocity of accretion flows . moreover ,",
    "increase in the rotational velocity is because of that the disc should rotate faster than the case without the magnetic field which results the magnetic tension .",
    "these properties are qualitatively consistent with the previous works on magnetized adafs ( e.g. akizuki & fukue 2006 ; khesali & faghei 2009 ; abbassi et al .",
    "figures 3 and 4 imply that the mass and energy losses due to wind give the same results by figures 1 and 2 . on the other hand ,",
    "the effects of mass and energy losses on the physical variables do not change in low and high values of magnetic field .",
    "figures 5 and 6 represent that the disc thickness increases with the magnitude of the resistivity or the magnetic field .",
    "because the temperature increases by adding the resistivity or the magnetic field , and from equation ( 21 ) we can see the disc thickness increases with temperature . in figures 5 and 6 , the disc thickness is also studied for several values of parameters @xmath29 and @xmath57 .",
    "the disc thickness profiles imply that it becomes thinner for the stronger mass or energy losses due to outflows . because these parameters reduces the temperature of the flow .",
    "here , we exploit bernoulli parameter ( @xmath100 ) to consider the effects of the resistivity to generate / enhance outflows in magnetized adafs . because , this parameter measures the likelihood that outflow or wind may originate spontaneously ( narayan & yi 1994 ) .",
    "an adiabatic flow has a constant @xmath100 along streamlines .",

    "we adopted the presented solutions by knigge ( 1999 ) , akizuki & fukue ( 2006 ) , and shadmehri ( 2008 ) .",
    "thus , we assumed that angular momentum transport is due to viscous turbulence and the @xmath0-prescription is used for the kinematic coefficient of viscosity .",
