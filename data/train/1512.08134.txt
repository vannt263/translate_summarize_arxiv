    "a graph structure with its laplacian matrix provides a mathematical tool to analyze the similarities between data points : those points with large enough similarities are connected by an edge .",

    ", it is noticed that the representation of the data set can be vastly improved by endowing the edges of the graph additionally with linear transformations @xcite .",
    "for example , when the graph is representing a social network , we hope to attach to each edge an element from the one dimensional orthogonal group @xmath0 to indicate two kinds of opposite relationships between members of the network ( vertices ) .",
    "when the graph is representing higher dimensional data set , e.g. , @xmath1-dimensional photos of a @xmath2-dimensional object from different views , one would like to assign to each edge an element of the orthogonal group @xmath3 which optimally rotationally aligns photos when comparing their similarity ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in theoretical research",
    ", assigning linear transformations to the edges of a graph also provides mathematical structures that have been found very useful in various topics , e.g. , the study of heawood map - coloring problem @xcite , the construction of ramanujan graphs @xcite , and the study of a discrete analogue of magnetic operators @xcite .",
    "the corresponding laplacian of a graph with such an additional structure is called _ the connection laplacian _ , defined by singer and wu @xcite .",
    "in fact , the connection laplacian of a graph yields a very elegant and general mathematical framework for the analysis of massive data sets , which includes several extensively studied graph operators as particular cases , e.g. , the classical laplacian , the signless laplacian @xcite , the laplacian for harary s signed graphs @xcite , and the discrete magnetic laplacian @xcite .    in this paper , we study the spectra of the graph connection laplacian , which are closely related to the geometric structure of the underlying graph with those transformations attached to its edges . we describe this geometric structure by introducing two types of quantities , cheeger type constants and a discrete ricci curvature .",
    "our main theorem is concerned with higher order buser type inequalities , showing the close relations between eigenvalues of the connection laplacian and the cheeger constants assuming nonnegativity of the discrete ricci curvature .",
    "we also obtain a lower bound estimate of the first nonzero eigenvalue of the connection laplacian by the lower ricci curvature bound , i.e. we show a lichnerowicz type eigenvalue estimate . in this process",
    ", the properties of the cheeger constants and discrete ricci curvature are explored systematically . in particular , our eigenvalues estimates help us to deepen the understanding of these two geometric quantities .",
    "we now aim to state our main theorem ( theorem [ thm : intromain ] below ) more explicitly .",
    "we first introduce relevant notation .",
    "let @xmath4 be an undirected simple finite graph with vertex set @xmath5 and edge set @xmath6 . for simplicity , we restrict ourselves to unweighted @xmath7-regular graphs in this introduction .",
    "let @xmath8 be a group .",
    "for each edge @xmath9 , we assign an element @xmath10 to it , such that @xmath11 actually , we are defining a map @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the set of all oriented edges .",

    "hence all eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath26 are real .",
    "note that the connection laplacian @xmath19 in ( [ eq : introconnction lap ] ) is defined as a negative semidefinite matrix for our later purpose of defining the discrete curvature , due to a convention originating from riemannian geometry .",

    "the cheeger type constants @xmath39 and the discrete ricci curvature @xmath40 that we are going to introduce are also switching invariant . a signature @xmath14 is said to be _ balanced _ if it is switching equivalent to the trivial signature @xmath41 .",

    "there are @xmath23 different groups of eigenvalues and @xmath23 cheeger constants , correspondingly .    in 1982 , peter buser @xcite showed that the first nonzero eigenvalue of the laplace - beltrami operator on a closed riemannian manifold is bounded from above by the square of the cheeger constant , up to a constant involving ricci curvature .",

    "that is , we are asking for a possible _ dual buser inequality _ for the graph laplacian @xmath57 .",
    "observe that the first eigenvalue of the connection laplacian @xmath93 , also known as the signless laplacian @xcite , is equal to @xmath82 . indeed , one check that @xmath94 therefore , theorem [ thm : intromain ] implies the following dual buser inequality for @xmath57 .",
