    "reducing the decoherence induced by interaction with the environment is one of the major challenges in the practical implementation of quantum computing . in particular , for solid state qubits this seems to be the most important issue . in this paper",
    "we discuss the effect of noise with a correlation time that is long compared to the decoherence time of the qubit . the work is directly motivated by experiments  @xcite on josephson charge qubits ( jcq ) , but due to their general nature they can also be relevant to many other systems . the jcq is built around a small superconducting grain connected to a superconducting reservoir by a josephson junction . by means of a capacitively coupled gate voltage one can control the number of cooper pairs on the small grain . because of the coulomb blockade there will be a preferred number of cooper pairs except at special degeneracy points where the energies of states with @xmath0 and @xmath1 coincide .",
    "the degeneracy is lifted by the josephson coupling , giving the usual level anticrossing picture sketched in fig .",
    "if the gate voltage is never too far from the degeneracy point we can ignore transitions to other levels and the device can be regarded as a two level system or qubit .    consider noise in this system originating from fluctuations in the electric potential of the grain .",
    "this could be either due to fluctuations in the gate voltage source , or to fluctuating charges in the environment .",
    "both would correspond to fluctuations of the working point position along the horizontal axis of the figure , with a corresponding change in the energy .",
    "the experiments@xcite where conducted with the gate voltage away from the degeneracy point , where to a good approximation the energy is a linear function of the potential .",
    "this case is covered by the theory@xcite for the case of free induction and narrow distribution of coupling constants and for both free induction and echo at arbitrary distribution of coupling constants , respectively .",
    "using a modified circuit devoret _ et .",
    "@xcite were able to work at the degeneracy point where to first order there is no change in energy when the potential is changed .",
    "the idea is that this would make the device less sensitive to electrostatic noise .",
    "this is then called the _ optimal working point_. at this point the expectation value of the charge is the same for both states .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to extend the theory  @xcite to this situation and to see how dephasing is changed as the optimal point is approached .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ mod ] the model for the qubit interacting with the noise",
    "is presented . in section [ st ]",
    "we discuss a short time expansion that illustrates in a simple way the interplay of the effect of several uncorrelated fluctuators at the optimal point .",

    "one of the sources of such fluctuations is hopping background charges.@xcite we briefly recall the model of refs .  .",
    "it is assumed that there are dynamic defects characterized by two metastable states .",
    "they can be , for example , traps near the electrodes able to capture electrons from the electrodes and then re - emit them , or pairs of traps with one electron bouncing between them .",
    "each dynamic defect is represented as a classical fluctuator producing random telegraph noise .",
    "that is , the state of each fluctuator is represented by a random function @xmath14 which switches between the two values , @xmath15 .",
    "the probability to switch @xmath0 times between theses states during the time @xmath16 is assumed to be given by the poisson distribution @xmath17 here @xmath18 is the characteristic switching frequency of the given fluctuator .",
    "this means that the switching events occur independently of each other .",
    "the fluctuation @xmath10 is a sum of the contributions of different fluctuators , @xmath19 different fluctuators are assumed to be statistically independent , @xmath20 this is actually the simplest model since it is assumed that the probabilities to jump between the states in two directions are the same . as a result ,",
    "equilibrium populations of the states are equal .",
    "this assumption can be relaxed  @xcite without change of the physical conclusions .",
    "indeed , since only fluctuators with energy splittings @xmath21 contribute to the decoherence , the equilibrium populations of the efficient states do not essentially differ .",
    "several papers  @xcite have addressed the dephasing in the presence of a large number of fluctuators with a broad range of switching rates , @xmath18 .",
    "this situation is relevant for systems showing @xmath22 noise .",
    "we believe , however , that the experiments with  good \" qubits , e. g. , ref .  , are best understood in terms of a small number of fluctuators .",
    "also , if one is to achieve quantum computation this is necessary as a large number of fluctuators most probably will lead to large decoherence and ruin the device .",
    "we will therefore here focus on the effect of a small number of fluctuators .",
    "the noise affects the qubit in two ways : ( i ) it causes shifts in the energy levels of the two states and thereby introduces a random contribution to the relative phase of the two states ( dephasing ) and ( ii ) it causes transitions between the two states leading to energy relaxation .",
    "let us for the moment concentrate on the first effect , dephasing .",
    "the important quantity that we study is the phase - memory functional @xmath23 \\right\\rangle\\ ] ] where @xmath24 is the shift in the energy splitting of the two levels caused by the fluctuators , while @xmath25 is some function which depends on the qubit manipulation procedure , as will be explained below .",
    "the phase - memory functional describes the relative phase picked up during time evolution by one state of the qubit relative to the other .",
    "diagonalizing eq .",
    "( [ ham0 ] ) we get the eigenenergies @xmath26 if the working point is far from the optimal one , @xmath27 , we can neglect the josephson energy , and coupling of the fluctuators to the qubit is linear , @xmath28 an exact formula for the phase memory functional for a linear coupling in the case of a single fluctuator coupled to the qubit was derived in refs .  .",
    "in this limit , because of the linearity @xmath29 in @xmath30 , the phase memory functional for any number of fluctuators is found by simply multiplying the phase memory functionals of different fluctuators . in the regime of exponential decay",
    "this procedure corresponds to simply adding the decay rates and the resulting decay rate is represented by the average over the distributions of fluctuator parameters.@xcite the optimal point , @xmath31 , was studied in various approximations and numerically in refs .  .",
    "the aim of the present work is to derive an exact formula for the phase memory functional of a single fluctuator similar to that in refs .   that is applicable at an _ arbitrary _ working point .",
    "averaging over a large number of fluctuators is in the general case not as simple as in the linear regime since the phase memory functional is not the product of individual factors for each fluctuator .",
    "however , we will extend the analysis to a small number of fluctuators , which we believe is relevant to qubit experiments.@xcite    to make the main idea clear let us first study the expansion at short times , @xmath32 .",
    "firstly , this expansion provides some insight ; secondly , the short - time situation can be most important for realistic qubits since at long times the phase memory functional has already decayed to a very low value .",
    "we expand the energy in the limit @xmath33 to obtain @xmath34 where @xmath35 . when averaging the phases we subtract the initial values so that we only get what comes from fluctuator jumps .",

    "if there is only linear coupling , each fluctuator appears in only one term in the exponent .",
    "since we assume the fluctuators to be statistically independent the average can be split into a product of averages over each individual fluctuator . with the quadratic term",
    "included this is no longer possible . here",
    "we will study the cases of one and two fluctuators .",

    "it is easy to see that a similar pattern will also appear for larger number of fluctuators . at longer times",
    "this product structure is lost .",
    "the interplay between the linear and quadratic coupling is now quite clear . if @xmath59 the linear coupling is dominant .",
    "approaching the optimal point will reduce the dephasing until @xmath60 becomes smaller than @xmath61 where the term proportional to @xmath62 becomes most important .",
    "this contribution results from the interplay between the two fluctuators and can not be eliminated ; thus it represents the minimal dephasing possible at the optimal point .",
    "the physical reason for this is quite easy to understand .",
    "switching of fluctuator 1 shifts the average point that fluctuator 2 is working around .",
    "both positions of fluctuator 1 can not represent the optimal point with respect to fluctuator 2 , and some dephasing is bound to occur .",
    "this is the most important physical insight that distinguishes the quadratic coupling from the linear . in the case of quadratic coupling ,",
    "even if the different fluctuators in themselves are independent , their effect on the qubit will be influenced by the positions of all the others . with linear coupling",
    "one finds that slow fluctuators , with @xmath63 do not contribute to the dephasing .",
    "this is no longer true for quadratic coupling , as they play a role in determining the effect of the fast fluctuators even if they do not have time to switch during the experiment .",

    "the fact that the experimental results are similar to our figures  [ f3 ] and [ f4 ] rather that the opposite shows that in these experiments the noise in the @xmath141 part is dominant .",
    "at the end we would like to discuss two simple observations based on the above results .",
    "the method that we have used to find the phase memory functional gave as an intermediate result an expression for the distribution function of the phase @xmath71 .",
    "the phase memory functional is the average of the quantity @xmath143 with this distribution .",
    "but can the full distribution function be compared to experiment ? in the first set of experiments @xcite only averages could be measured , but recently there has been demonstrated single shot readout of the qubit state.@xcite is it possible to extract the full distribution function from such data ?",
    "unfortunately , the answer is no for the following reason . for each realization of the experiment",
    ", there is a certain realization of the random external noise .",
    "this gives the phase difference @xmath70 a certain well defined value .",
    "the next realization gives another realization of the noise process and another value for the phase difference and so on .",
    "since we have no knowledge about which realization of the noise is relevant to a certain experiment , we have to describe the final state of the qubit by a density matrix representing a mixed state .",
    "since all outcomes of all possible experiments can be calculated from the density matrix , no more information about the system can be learned that what is contained in the density matrix .",
    "since the phase distribution was calculated ignoring the relaxation ( @xmath103 ) processes the density matrix will be represented by a vector in the equatorial plane of the bloch sphere ( but for a mixed state it will not be on the surface of the sphere but at some interior point ) , and the components of this vector are exactly the real and imaginary parts of the phase memory functional .",
    "thus , the phase memory functional contains all information that we can extract about the qubit through experiments . a different way to express",
    "the same is that there are many different phase distribution functions yielding the _ same _ qubit density matrix , and there is no way that one can experimentally distinguish these in an experiment with a single qubit .",
