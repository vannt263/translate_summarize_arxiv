    "( [ eq99 ] ) . for @xmath104 tunneling through the chain without exciting it and without using virtual excitations dominates .",
    "however , for @xmath105 the tunneling electron uses predominantly @xmath43 virtual excitations to tunnel and the chain has most likely @xmath43 excitations once the electron tunneled through .",
    "this shows a difference from the single oscillator case where in the strongly coupled regime , @xmath105 , the oscillator was not excited by the tunneling electron .",
    "only for @xmath42 near one excitations are likely . to understand this",
    "we note that each single mode in the many oscillator case is weakly coupled . the probability to excite some is only finite because there are many modes .      within a debye approximation",
    "we assume a spectrum of modes with linear dispersion @xmath106 with the speed of sound @xmath107 . the debye cut - off @xmath108 is chosen to give the correct number of modes .",
    "it leads qualitatively to the same results as an einstein approximation for a two and a three dimensional tunnel junction since their phonon spectra favor high frequency modes and @xmath92 is replaced by an average frequency .",
    "we therefore focus on tunneling through a chain of atoms .",
    "we further restrict the following considerations to the probability for tunneling without final state excitations since the probability for tunneling with final state excitations follows then from eq .",

    "is suppressed by @xmath110 . in the thermodynamic limit , @xmath111 ,",
    "this approaches zero .",
    "this behavior is similar to the orthogonality catastrophe described by anderson @xcite for an electron tunneling into a fermi gas which has a constant density of states near the fermi surface .",
    "we now investigate the contribution @xmath93 from a tunneling path involving @xmath94 virtual excitations .",
    "the key question is whether there is a dominant tunneling path ( a @xmath94 with @xmath93 maximal ) and what would be its effective virtual energy @xmath112 ( compare eq .",
    "( [ eq25 ] ) ) .",
    "we suggest that the contribution of mode @xmath100 to the effective virtual energy is determined by a factor @xmath113 since the same factor determined in the case of tunneling with one final state excitation the contribution of the tunneling path with mode @xmath100 finally excited ( compare eq .",
    "( [ eq20 ] ) ) .",
    "since @xmath93 involves @xmath94 virtual excitations we introduce further a normalizing factor @xmath114 and find [ eq21 ] a_m = e^-w w^m . for the energy of the @xmath94 virtual excitations we find [ eq78 ] _",
    "j_j = _ c .",
    "numerically we find that this approximation holds when the energy of the @xmath94 virtual excitations does not exceed the barrier heights .",
    "for large finite @xmath59 we find that @xmath43 tends logarithmically to infinity .",
    "however , for @xmath32 the probability for tunneling without final state excitations is simply given by the tunneling probability through an effective barrier ( compare eq .",

    "the dominating path involves @xmath43 virtual excitations leading to an energy @xmath115 of the virtual excitations which is independent of @xmath43 .",
    "thus the probability for tunneling through the chain without final state excitations is finite and independent of the length @xmath59 .",
    "note that the maximal virtual energy @xmath116 possibly used in a tunneling event with @xmath43 virtual excitations increases logarithmically with the number @xmath59 of modes .",
    "once this energy @xmath116 exceeds the barrier heights @xmath117 the numerical investigation showed that our approximation , eq .",
    "( [ eq21 ] ) , fails .",
    "however at the same point our approach using second order perturbation theory is questionable .",

    ", we first investigated tunneling through a barrier with a coupling to a single oscillator .",
    "the result can be characterized by a coupling strength @xmath43 given by the square of the ratio of the classical shift of the oscillator to its zero - point fluctuation . for weak coupling , @xmath104 , tunneling without final state excitations",
