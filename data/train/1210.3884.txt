    "in the papers @xcite , treschev developed a new averaging method called continuous averaging .",
    "it is a powerful tool to derive sharp constants in the exponentially small splitting problems in hamiltonian systems with one and a half degrees of freedom .",
    "but the technicality becomes very heavy when we use the method to study hamiltonian systems of more degrees of freedom .",
    "for this reason , the method has not been applied to other problems yet .    in this paper",
    ", we use the continuous averaging to give a new proof of the nekhoroshev theorem .",
    "we consider the following analytic nearly integrable hamiltonian system : @xmath0 the phase space is @xmath1 we complexify the variables and extend the domain of @xmath2 to a @xmath3 neighborhood and that of @xmath4 to a @xmath5 neighborhood of the original domains respectively .",
    "the extended phase space to the complex domain is @xmath6 where @xmath5 is the width of analyticity in @xmath4 and @xmath3 is that of the slow variables @xmath7 .",
    "as stated in @xcite , nekhoroshev theorem ensures that when the unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath8 is quasi - convex , by which we mean that the set @xmath9 is strictly convex , the following general estimate holds for sufficiently small @xmath10:@xmath11 for some constants @xmath12 independent of @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the action variable component of any orbit associated to hamiltonian  ( [ eq : main ] ) with initial condition in the set @xmath15 .",
    "there are many works studying the stability exponents @xmath16 and @xmath17 ( c.f.@xcite ) .",
    "their approaches are based on a careful study of the geometric and number theoretical aspects of resonances . instead , in this paper we try to sharpen the estimates in the analytic part of the proof using continuous averaging to obtain an improved normal form ( see theorem  [ thm : main ] ) .",
    "then we apply the normal form to lochak s argument to get the nekhoroshev theorem ( see theorem  [ thm : global ] ) where all the stability constants are estimated explicitly . in this paper",
    ", we only work on the case @xmath18 . but",
    "the normal form theorem can be easily applied to other prescribed @xmath16 and @xmath17 to get the corresponding @xmath19 .",
    "the method of lochak is called the simultaneous diophantine approximation , which turns out to be an important alternative to the classical approach via small divisor techniques , as explained in @xcite .",
    "its main idea is to do the averaging in a vicinity of a periodic orbit .",
    "so it is essentially an averaging procedure for systems with one fast angle . in general , we can kill the dependence on the fast angle up to exponential smallness .",
    "this makes the simultaneous diophantine approximation suitable to prove the nekhoroshev theorem .",
    "the work @xcite can be considered as a development of the continuous averaging to the small divisor case . in this paper , it is the first time that the continuous averaging has been developed to the simultaneous diophantine approximation .",

    "we first show local stability result of nekhoroshev theorem in section  [ section : local ] , and then global stability in section  [ section : global ] . here",
    "local stability means the stability result in a neighborhood of a periodic orbit and global stability means stability for all initial conditions . finally , we have two appendices  [ section : appendix ] and  [ section : majorant ] .",

    "the second one is some basics of majorant estimates .",

    "please see the chapter 5 of @xcite for more details .",

    ", we have : @xmath124 where @xmath125 stands for the @xmath67 part of the poisson bracket .",
    "+ our goal is to show that    _ if we choose a suitable hamiltonian isotopy @xmath21 and extend @xmath126 as large as possible , the dependence of @xmath22 on @xmath4 can be killed to be exponentially small , i.e. @xmath127 for some constant @xmath128 .",

    "following @xcite , we explain here the heuristic ideas that justify this choice of @xmath21 . if we set @xmath135 in  ( [ eq : fourier ] ) , we get @xmath136 whose solution tends to zero as @xmath137 . if we neglect the third term in the rhs of  ( [ eq : fourier ] ) , we have @xmath138 it has an exact solution of the form @xmath139 where @xmath64 means the hamiltonian flow generated by the hamiltonian @xmath140 .",
