    "a _ line arrangement _ @xmath0 in @xmath1 is a finite collection of projective lines .",

    "two line arrangements @xmath3 and @xmath4 are lattice isomorphic , denoted by @xmath5 , if up to a permutation on the labels of the lines their lattices are the same . in this case",
    "we say that the arrangements have the same combinatorics .",
    "a _ zariski pair _ of line arrangements is a pair of lattice isomorphic arrangements @xmath6 that have different embeddings in @xmath1 .",
    "this means that the pairs ( @xmath7 ) and ( @xmath8 ) are not homeomorphic .",
    "rybnikov @xcite found the first such pair of arrangements in 1998 and showed furthermore that the complements have different fundamental groups .",
    "artal bartolo , carmona ruber , cogolludo agustn , and marco buzunriz @xcite give another example explicitly .",
    "one necessary condition for a zariski pair is a disconnected moduli space .",
    "we define the _ moduli space of an arrangement @xmath3 _ to be @xmath9 by randell",
    "s isotopy theorem @xcite , the embedding types of arrangements in the same connected component are the same .    by studying moduli spaces , nazir and yoshinaga @xcite proved that there is no zariski pair of arrangements of up to eight complex lines and listed a classification of arrangements of nine lines without proof ( later proved to be complete by ye in @xcite ) .",
    "the classification implies that there is also no zariski pair of arrangements of nine lines .    following this methodology ,",
    "a classification of the moduli spaces of arrangements of ten lines was completed by the authors in @xcite and @xcite . by theorem 5.3 and corollary 5.5 . in @xcite ,",
    "this gives a list of eighteen potential zariski pairs , as determined via disconnected moduli spaces , for all complex line arrangements of ten lines satisfying a reasonable assumption ( * ? ? ?",
    "* assumption 1.2 ) .",
    "just one of these arrangements has a moduli space of dimension one ; the rest have dimension zero .",
    "of these seventeen , only seven are realizable with real coefficients . following the enumeration from @xcite and intentionally omitting the cases @xmath10 through @xmath11",

    "specifically these three have moduli spaces that are two distinct points .",

    ". then we will refer to points of the moduli spaces throughout as @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "there are cases with moduli spaces that are two distinct points ( or more general two disconnected components of any dimension ) arising from complex conjugation @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 .",
    "these have already been removed from the list above due to the fact that embedding types of two complex conjugate arrangements are the same .",
    "furthermore , cohen and suciu ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 3.9 ) proved that the braid monodromies of complex conjugated curves are equivalent .",
    "motivated by the effect of complex conjugation acting on moduli spaces , our present results show the geometric symmetry @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 can similarly be used to disqualify some potential zariski pairs .",

    "this work relies on algorithm [ algorithm ] to produce this geometric reflection @xmath22 by exploiting a combinatorial @xmath23 subgroup of the automorphism group of the arrangement .",
    "we apply this technique to show that arrangements @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 are not zariski pairs , as stated in the main theorem [ thm : main ] .",
    "these three arrangements have automorphism groups which contain a @xmath23 subgroup ; the omitted four do not .",
    "* ramifications . *",
    "we suspect that the authors of @xcite were aware of this type of situation based on several comments , specifically in examples 3.4 , 3.5 , 3.6 , remark 3.8 , and again in section 5 .",
    "in fact they refer to our definition of the moduli space as the _ ordered moduli space_.    in our work we pair previous geometric techniques used by nazir and yoshinaga to determine this ( ordered ) moduli space together with insight from the automorphism group .",
    "this gives us an understanding of the more general moduli space of artal bartolo et al .",
    "in particular , our algorithm gives insight into where such a situation might arise .",

    "the complex cases are considered in section [ sec : complex ] with subsection [ subsec : lit ] on two examples from the literature , the maclane arrangement and the nazir - yoshinaga arrangement , and subsection [ subsec : complex ] on examples from @xcite . the geometric reflection given by complex conjugation",
    "can already be used to disqualify these as zariski pairs , but our geometric reflection @xmath22 works , as well .",
    "lastly section [ sec : counter ] points out two examples from the literature , the falk - sturmfels arrangement and rybnikov s example , that act as counterexamples to our algorithm [ algorithm ] as it stands now .",
    "the combinatorics of line arrangements can be given by means of several equivalent objects : an intersection lattice , a line combinatorics ( as seen in @xcite ) , a combinatorial type ( as seen in @xcite ) , and a configuration table ( as seen in @xcite ) , which omits double points as these can be recovered from points of higher multiplicities alone .",
    "it is this last most concise expression , the configuration table , that we use to describe the combinatorics in the examples below .",
    "however , in order to define combinatorial symmetries , we keep the intersection lattice terminology :    let @xmath27 and @xmath28 be two line arrangements in @xmath1 .",
    "lattice isomorphism _ between @xmath29(@xmath3 ) and @xmath29(@xmath30 ) is a permutation @xmath31 on the index set @xmath32 for which @xmath33 is identical to @xmath34 .",

    "examples of the automorphism groups of arrangements appear throughout the paper .",
    "the unfamiliar reader will appreciate the proof of proposition [ prop : anna ] which explains this idea in careful detail for arrangement @xmath24 .            1 .",

    "set the lines @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 as the lines @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 , respectively .",
    "3 .   apply the grid lemma 3.10 of @xcite and the same techniques of previous work to obtain a parametrized equation that defines representative arrangements from each of the connected components of the moduli space @xmath36 .",
    "4 .   for an appropriate pair @xmath51 and @xmath52 of the obtained arrangements , check that the map @xmath22 sends the line arrangement @xmath53 to the line arrangement @xmath54 .",
    "[ rem : inverse ] in the last part of the algorithm , the check must involve the parameters of the defining equation .",
    "let @xmath13 be the two solutions of the quadratic giving the two disconnected components of the moduli space .",
    "often the reflection @xmath22 realizes the galois conjugation @xmath55 by means of an additional inverse operation @xmath56 on the parameter @xmath57 ( up to some constant ) !    a list of arrangements that we consider in this work can be found in table [ tab : summary ] .",
    "we apply our algorithm [ algorithm ] successfully to those in the first two sections of the table .",

    "the next five arrangements can not be realized with real coefficients , have two disconnected components , and have dimension either zero ( the first two ) or one ( the last three ) . in the two former cases , the variable @xmath13 stands as above , along with the notation @xmath14 and @xmath15 . in the three latter cases",
    ", the variable @xmath58 will give the two disconnected components of the moduli space , while the variable @xmath57 will act as the free variable giving dimension one .",
    "see notation [ rem : variables ] .",
    "any symmetry of the arrangement must respect the lines @xmath60 that pass through the lone quadruple point labeled @xmath61 in the configuration table .",
    "a permutation on the set @xmath62 of lines will also respectfully act on the sets @xmath63 and @xmath64 of triples also on these lines .",
    "of course this fixes the line @xmath65 . by the first set of triples ,",
    "this permutation must also respectfully act on the set @xmath66 of lines containing these triples .",
    "this must also respectfully act on the set @xmath67@xmath68 @xmath69@xmath70 of pairs of remaining triples .",
    "the following shows that no permutation except for the identity may fix an element of the set @xmath64 , each of which is the same up to symmetry .",
    "suppose , for example , that the triple @xmath71 is fixed . then the line @xmath72 is fixed , and the lines @xmath73 may either be acted on by the identity or a transposition . supposing it is a transposition , then ( @xmath74 @xmath75 ) gives ( @xmath76 @xmath77)(@xmath78",
    "@xmath79 ) , which leads to ( @xmath80 @xmath81 ) , a contradiction .",
    "let us suppose now that the permutation sends the triple @xmath71 to @xmath78 .",
    "then this sends the line @xmath72 to @xmath80 and the triple @xmath82 to @xmath77 .",
    "this forces the unordered pair of lines @xmath83 to be sent to the set @xmath84 .",
    "suppose by way of contradiction that the line @xmath74 is sent to itself , and so the line @xmath75 is sent to the line @xmath85 .",
    "then the triple @xmath78 must be sent back to @xmath71 , and the triple @xmath77 must be sent to @xmath86 .",
    "this would send the line @xmath80 to @xmath81 , forcing the triple @xmath78 to be sent to @xmath79 , instead , a contradiction .",
    "thus we may assume this permutation sends the ordered pair of lines @xmath73 to the ordered pair of lines @xmath87 .",
    "this sends the triple @xmath76 to @xmath86 , the triple @xmath78 to @xmath88 , the triple @xmath77 to @xmath76 , and the triple @xmath79 to @xmath71 .",
    "this gives the permutation ( @xmath72 @xmath80 @xmath89 @xmath81)(@xmath90 @xmath75 @xmath74 @xmath85)(@xmath82 @xmath77 @xmath76 @xmath86)(@xmath71 @xmath78 @xmath88 @xmath79 ) yielding a @xmath59 symmetry .",
    "the inverse of this permutation sends the triple @xmath71 to @xmath79 , as expected .",
    "the only other remaining option is to send the triple @xmath71 to @xmath88 , and this yields a @xmath23 symmetry that lives within the @xmath59 symmetry above .",
