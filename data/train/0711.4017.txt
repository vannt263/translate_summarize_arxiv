    "the van der waals ( vdw ) interactions are particularly important in colloidal systems since , along with the electrostatic forces , they determine the structure of such systems .",
    "the stability of colloidal systems resulting from the interplay between the vdw and the electrostatic interactions is very well elucidated in the context of derjaguin - landau - verwey - overbeek theory .",
    "@xcite the vdw interactions which originate from the irreducible electromagnetic ( em ) fluctuations of vacuum are usually calculated by means of the hamaker approach , @xcite where the force stems from simple pairwise addition of the corresponding intermolecular forces , @xcite although the vdw interactions are not additive . a rigorous treatment of the vdw interactions based on fluctuational electrodynamics @xcite has been pioneered by lifshitz @xcite for the case of two infinite half - spaces .",
    "the lifshitz theory has been extended to the case of pairs of finite - sized objects such as spheres or cylinders ( derjaguin approximation ) @xcite which is valid , however , for very short distances between the objects , in the nonretarded limit . in some cases , elements of the lifshitz theory for half - spaces",
    "are incorporated within the hamaker formula for the vdw force between two particles , in the form of semi - empirical corrections .",
    "@xcite by use of perturbation theory and the clausius - mossotti formula , langbein @xcite developed a general formalism for the vdw force between two spheres which has been primarily applied to aerosol particles .",
    "@xcite    recently , a new , rigorous theory based on fluctuational electrodynamics for the calculation of the vdw interactions among a collection of macroscopic bodies of finite size has been proposed .",
    "@xcite this theory is based on a multiple - scattering green s tensor formalism incorporated within the framework of fluctuational electrodynamics .",
    "more specifically , the vdw force results from the integration over the surface of the bodies of the maxwell stress tensor of the vacuum/ thermal em field which is provided by the fluctuation - dissipation theorem and through this by the green s tensor of the classical em field .",
    "the calculation of the green s tensor is based on an em multiple scattering formalism for arbitrary collections of scatterers .",
    "the multiple - scattering green s tensor formalism offers a precise knowledge of the fluctuating em field by going beyond the approximation of pairwise interactions between the scatterers and by taking into account the full multipole interactions between them .",
    "furthermore , since it constitutes a solution to the inhomogeneous wave equation , retardation effects are included _ a priori _ in the presented formalism .",
    "in addition , metallic and dielectric particles are treated on an equal footing since the method in question also accounts for the magnetic - field vacuum fluctuations which can not be neglected in the case of metallic particles .",
    "finally , the effect of finite temperature can be easily addressed .",
    "we note that a different approach has been recently presented @xcite where the em green s tensor entering the fluctuation - dissipation theorem is calculated by means of a finite - difference frequency - domain method .    when a particle is a member of a colloidal crystal and a net vdw force exerted on the particle is evident ( e.g. , in a finite slab of a colloidal crystal or in an infinite crystal containing point and/ or line defects ) , it is calculated from a pairwise addition of the forces stemming from the all the other particles of the crystal .",
    "so , at first glance , an extension of the ref .   to the case of a colloidal system would be based on a pairwise summation of the ( exact ) force for a pair of particles .",
    "however , such an approach is only approximately correct since the vdw interactions are not additive . the way to extend the method of ref . to the case of a colloidal crystal",
    "is to derive a semi - analytical expression of the em green s tensor for the particular crystal .",
    "the knowledge of the em green s tensor everywhere in space allows the calculation of the cross - spectral correlation functions of the vacuum em field which are contained in the em maxwell stress tensor , by application of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem . by integrating the maxwell stress tensor over the surface of the particle",
    "we obtain the vdw force .",

    "[ fig2 ] we show the net vdw force ( @xmath183- and @xmath184- components ) for different lattice constants @xmath185 of the the underlying 2d square lattice .",
    "while each of the components oscillates from positive to negative values , it is evident that there exists a value of the lattice constant @xmath185 , namely @xmath186  nm , where the net force is zero and this particular sphere rests in equilibrium .",
    "overall , the magnitude of the vdw force decreases with the lattice constant , as expected .",
    "we have presented a method for the calculation of the vdw forces in colloidal systems such clusters of colloidal particles , infinite periodic or defected crystals , and colloidal crystals slabs .",
    "the method is based on the fluctuation - dissipation theorem which relates the cross - spectral correlation functions entering the formula for the vdw force ( integral of the maxwell stress tensor over the particle surface ) with the em green s tensor of the system of particles ( scatterers ) .",
    "the calculation of the green s tensor is based on a rigorous multiple - scattering formalism for em waves .",
    "the accuracy stems from the fact that it does not include any kind of approximations apart from the unavoidable cutoffs in the angular momentum expansion and/ or in the plane - wave expansion of the em field . as such",
    ", the method includes all essential multipole terms beyond the dipole term in the em response of the scatterers and is valid for any distance between the scatterers . by including _ a priori _ all the possible multiple - scattering processes of the vacuum fluctuations , the method , naturally , accounts for all possible many - body interactions between the scatterers and therefore goes beyond the approximation of pairwise interactions .    finally , we note that a theoretical approach , analogous to the multiple - scattering treatment for the wave equation , has been developed for solving the poisson equation in solids described by arbitrarily shaped , space - filling charges .",
    "@xcite by combining this electrostatic multiple - scattering approach with the vdw theory presented in this work , one can devise a general , first - principles theory for the determination of colloidal structure .",
