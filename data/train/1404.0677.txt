    "the preferred solution is that feedback from massive stars and accreting supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) regulates the cold gas supply for star formation by ejecting cold gas from galaxies and preventing hot gas from cooling .",

    "the most massive ellipticals have high @xmath8/fe abundance ratios implying very short formation times ( @xmath9  gyr ; @xcite ) .    the ejective feedback that is necessary to quench star formation quickly in simulations is predicted to be most effective in major mergers of massive gas - rich galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . under the assumption that such mergers form dynamically hot spheroids and quench subsequent star formation ( e.g. , * ?",
    "* ) , this merger - driven model has been proposed to be the dominant formation mechanism for red elliptical galaxies @xcite .",

    "these models have been successful in reproducing a number of empirical trends , including the color - magnitude relation and the correlation between supermassive black hole ( smbh ) mass and bulge stellar velocity dispersion .",

    "however , linking galaxy - wide outflows to feedback processes ( e.g. , radiation pressure , jets ) from a smbh that originate on parsec scales remains a challenging problem because momentum coupling is not fully understood .",
