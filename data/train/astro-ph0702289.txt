    "since observational evidence of star - to - star abundance inhomogeneity among the light elements of stars in the galactic globular clusters ( gcs ) was discovered ( e.g. , cohen 1978 ; peterson 1980 ; norris et al .",
    "1981 ; leep et al .",
    "1986 ) , the origin of the inhomogeneity has been extensively discussed both theoretically and observationally ( e.g. , sneden et al .",
    "1992 ; norris & da costa 1995 ; smith et al . 2005 ; see gratton et al .",
    "2004 for a recent review ) .",
    "so far the following two scenarios ( or working hypotheses ) have been proposed for the origin of the abundance inhomogeneity : ( 1 ) the primordial hypothesis and ( 2 ) the mixing hypothesis ( e.g. , sweigart & mengel 1979 ; cottrell & da costa 1981 ; freeman & norris 1981 ; smith 1987 ; suntzeff 1993 ; kraft 1994 ; denissenkov & weiss 1996 ) .",
    "the first hypothesis is that the observed inhomogeneity is due to the second generation of stars that formed from gas ejected from the first generation of evolved stars ( e.g. , agb stars ) ( `` primordial pollution '' or `` self - pollution '' scenarios , e.g. , cottrell & da costa 1981 ) .",
    "internal processes of stars , such as dredge - up of the cn - processing of envelope material in inner hydrogen - burning regions , are key for understanding the observed chemical inhomogeneity of gcs in the second mixing hypothesis ( e.g. , `` deep mixing '' ; smith 1987 ; kraft 1994 ; thoul et al . 2002 ) .",
    "although deep mixing is highly unlikely to occur in less evolved stars on the main sequence and subgiant - branch , star - to - star abundance inhomogeneity was found in these stars of some galactic gcs ( e.g. , cannon et al .",
    "1998 for 47 tuc ) .",
    "the self - pollution scenario is accordingly suggested to be more promising than the mixing ( evolutionary ) scenario ( da costa et al .",
    "2004 ; gratton 2004 for a recent review ) .",
    "stellar ejecta from agb stars and massive stars have been considered to play a key role in early chemical evolution of gcs for the self - pollution scenario ( e.g. , fenner et al .",
    "2004 ; charbonnel & prantzos 2006 ; prantzos & charbonnel 2006 ; karakas et al .",
    "2006 ; bekki & chiba 2007 ) .",
    "previous studies suggested that gcs are unlikely to retain agb ejecta owing to ram pressure stripping by warm / cold gas of the galactic halo and disk ( e.g. , frank & gisler 1976 ; smith 1996 ; gnedin et al . 2002 ) .",
    "these imply that gcs are even more unlikely to retain agb ejecta in protogalactic environments , where denser halo / disk gas can strip the agb ejecta efficiently from gcs during hydrodynamical interaction between the gas and the agb ejecta .",
    "these previous studies thus appear to suggest that self - pollution is _ not _ likely within gcs evolving in isolation , though numerical attempts have not yet been made to investigate the details of self - pollution processes within gcs .",
    "furthermore , the self - pollution scenario is suggested to have the following two problems in explaining physical properties of gcs .",
    "the first is that the observed large number fraction of cn - strong populations ( @xmath7 for ngc6752 ) , which correspond to the second generation of stars formed from agb ejecta , can not be explained by the scenario without assuming very unusual and unrealistic imfs ( e.g. , smith & norris 1982 ; dantona and caloi 2004 ) : the total mass of agb ejecta from the first generation of stars in a gc is only @xmath8% of the total mass of the gc with a canonical imf ( bekki & norris 2006 ) .",
    "the second is that the observed o@xmath9na and mg@xmath9al anticorrelations and c - depleted stars in cn - strong populations can not be reproduced quantitatively by chemical evolution models based on the self - pollution scenario ( fenner et al .",
    "this problem , however , could be due to the adopted agb models , which have some uncertainties in predicting chemical yields ( e.g. , denissenkov & herwig 2003 ; karakas & lattanzio 2003 ; ventura & dantona 2005a , b ; campbell et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "the most serious problem among these is the first one  the observed large fraction of stars that ( in this scenario ) formed from agb ejecta .",
    "the very large mass fraction of `` polluted '' second generation of stars in the self - pollution scenario requires that agb ejecta used for the formation of this generation of stars originate from stellar systems that had total masses much larger than those of the present gcs and have already disappeared for some reason .",
    "there could be two possible scenarios that can satisfy the above requirement . in the first place",
    ", we propose : ( i ) the gcs were initially more massive than the present - day gcs by a factor of @xmath10 , ( ii ) agb ejecta of the first generation of stars were consumed by the formation of the second generation with very high star formation efficiency , and ( iii ) most ( @xmath11% ) of the first generation of stars had been _ preferentially _ lost by some physical mechanisms such as tidal stripping due to the galactic tidal field .",
    "this scenario can be viable if enough of the agb ejecta can be converted into the second generation in less than @xmath12 yr after the completion of the first generation type ii supernovae ( sneii )  otherwise , age differences between the first and the second generation would cause a large age spread inconsistent with the observed tightness of the color - magnitude diagrams of gcs .    in the second scenario , proposed by bekki ( 2006 ) : ( i )",
    "proto - globular clouds are located in the central regions of low - mass proto - galaxies embedded in dark matter subhalos , ( ii ) agb ejecta of the host galaxy s field stars , which formed earlier and surround the clouds , goes into star formation within the clouds on a time scale of @xmath13 yr ( i.e. , until the intracluster gas is expelled by sneii ) , and ( iii ) the low - mass galaxies were destroyed by the galactic tidal fields to become the galactic halo components whereas the gcs were tidally stripped to form the galactic halo gcs . in this scenario",
    "there can be very small age differences ( @xmath14yr ) between stars with different abundances in a single gc .",
    "this pollution process would be better called `` external pollution '' rather than `` self - pollution '' , because most of agb ejecta originates from _ outside _ the gcs .",
    "although bekki & norris ( 2006 ) have recently discussed the origin of the possible helium overabundance of stellar populations of @xmath6 cen in the context of the external pollution scenario , the abundance inhomogeneities observed in `` normal '' gcs have not been extensively studied using previous chemical evolution models based on the _ external pollution _ scenario .",
    "the purpose of this paper is thus to discuss the origin of abundance inhomogeneity observed in the lighter elements ( e.g. , c , n , o , na , and al ) of gcs by using chemical evolution models based on the external pollution scenario .",
    "in particular , we discuss ( 1 ) the [ c / fe]-[n / fe ] anticorrelation , ( 2 ) cn - bimodality , ( 3 ) the o@xmath9na and mg@xmath9al anticorrelations , ( 4 ) the helium abundance , and ( 5 ) observable predictions of the models .",
    "we adopt the agb models recently developed by campbell et al .",
    "( 2006 ) in which the third dredge up in low - mass agb stars can , in effect , be switched off and on due to the use or non - use of the ledoux criterion for convective boundaries .",
    "we mainly show the results of the models _ without _ the third dredge - up , because the models can better explain the observed abundance inhomogeneity if they are included in the present chemical evolution models .",
    "we realize that these models are ad - hoc , but they enable us to investigate the proposed formation mechanism .",
    "we consider gc formation in the central regions of low - mass , proto - galaxies embedded in dark matter halos at very high @xmath0 .",
    "the gc host galaxies can provide a deep gravitational potential that allows agb ejecta to be retained and used for star formation in proto - gc clouds . in this scenario , both ( i ) agb ejecta from field stellar populations ( i.e. , the main components of the galaxies ) and ( ii ) proto - galactic interstellar gas ( which falls into the central regions ) can be mixed with each other and subsequently used for gc formation .",
    "gas ejected from sneii with velocities of @xmath15 km s@xmath16 is assumed to be expelled from dwarfs during galaxy formation and thus irresponsible for the chemical evolution of forming gcs .",
    "after gc formation , the host galaxies merge with the proto - galaxy and are completely destroyed by the strong galactic tidal field .",
    "the field stellar components of the galaxies are dispersed into the galactic halo region to become old , metal - poor halo stars whereas gcs , which are not destroyed by the galaxy owing to their initial compactness , become the galactic halo gcs .",
    "star formation and chemical evolution are assumed to proceed until type ii supernovae ( sne ii ) formed within proto - gcs prevent further star formation in this scenario .",
    "therefore , star formation is assumed to continue for less than @xmath13 yr in the models in which stars with different masses form in a coeval way .",
    "age differences of stars are typically less than 5 myr for most models in the present study .",
    "evolution of chemical abundances depends mainly on ( 1 ) how much agb ejecta is mixed into fresh ism and consequently converted into stars and ( 2 ) the time scale of gas infall into central regions of galaxies .",
    "advantages and disadvantages of the external pollution scenario are discussed later in  4.1 .      the total gas mass ( @xmath17 ) of a forming gc changes through the gas ejection of agb stars , gas infall , and star formation : @xmath18 where @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 are the gas ejection rate of the field agb stars , gas infall rate , and star formation rate , respectively .",
    "in order to calculate @xmath19 at each time step for the field stars ( which have a total mass of @xmath22 ) , we assume an imf in number defined as @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the initial mass of each individual star and the slope @xmath25 corresponds to the salpeter imf .",
    "the normalization factor @xmath26 is a function of @xmath22 , @xmath27 ( lower mass cut - off ) , and @xmath28 ( upper mass cut - off ) : @xmath29 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are set to be @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively .",
    "we adopt @xmath25 for all models in the present study .",
    "@xmath19 between @xmath32 and @xmath33 is accordingly described as : @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are masses of stars that turn off the main sequence ( thus becomes a agb star ) at the time @xmath33 and @xmath32 , respectively ( thus @xmath37 ) .",
    "@xmath38 describes the total gas mass ejected from an agb star with initial mass @xmath24 and final mass ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "we derive an analytic form of @xmath38 ( @xmath40 ) from the observational data by weidemann ( 2000 ) by using the least - square fitting method , and find : @xmath41    in order to calculate the main - sequence turn - off mass ( @xmath42 and @xmath43 ) at each time step , we use the following formula ( renzini & buzzoni 1986 ; norman & scoville 1988 ) : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is in solar units and time @xmath46 in years .",
    "we assume that the time @xmath47 corresponds to the epoch ( @xmath48 ) when the most massive agb star ( with @xmath49 ) starts to eject gas in the present models .",
    "therefore @xmath50 in the above equation ( 5 ) .",
    "the gas infall rate @xmath20 is described as @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the normalization factor for the total mass of infalling gas , @xmath53 represents the epoch of the maximum infall rate , and @xmath2 describes the time - scale of gas infall .",
    "the adopted gaussian distribution means that the gas infall rate increases , whether slowly or rapidly , ",
    "depending on the adopted @xmath2 , for @xmath54  and then decreases for @xmath55 .",
    "the star formation rate @xmath21 is described as @xmath56 where @xmath57 ( a normalization constant ) is determined for a given @xmath58 so that most of the gas can be consumed within an order of @xmath13 yr .",
    "although we investigate a range of @xmath58 , we show the results for the models with @xmath59 which can better explain observations .",
    "observations ( e.g. , tightness of color - magnitude diagrams of gcs ) strongly suggest that the timescale of gc formation should be quite short ( an order of @xmath12 yr ) .",
    "we also consider that star formation is truncated owing to feedback effects of type - ii supernovae ( sne ii ) formed during gc formation : the present models with this truncation can keep abundance homogeneity in heavy elements ( e.g. , fe ) and thus can be consistent with physical properties of normal gcs in the galaxy .",
    "therefore we assume that gas can be converted into stars in gcs only for @xmath60 , where @xmath61 should be similar to or shorter than @xmath62 yr corresponding to the typical lifetimes of stars that explode as sne ii .",
    "we present the results of the representative models with @xmath63 yr and @xmath64 in the present study .",
    "the gas mass ( @xmath65 ) is given in units of @xmath22 ( the total mass of field stars ) .",
    "in the adopted imf , @xmath66 is 0.01 ( @xmath67 ) at @xmath68 for all models .",
    "the time evolution of the abundance of the @xmath69-th element is described as follows : @xmath70 where @xmath71 and @xmath72 are the @xmath69-th abundance of agb ejecta and infalling gas , respectively .",
    "@xmath71 is time - dependent , because of the varying timescales of evolution for the different masses of agb stars ( see equation ( 5 ) ) .",
    "we assume that @xmath72 is constant for each @xmath69-th element and thus refer to it simply as @xmath73 in the present study .    in order to calculate @xmath71",
    ", we use the latest chemical yield tables produced by campbell et al .",
    "( 2006 ) in which h , he , c , n , o , na , @xmath74 mg , @xmath75 mg , @xmath76 mg , al , are listed for agb stars with the masses ranging from @xmath77 to @xmath78 for a given [ fe / h ] ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "these models follow normal agb evolution with hot bottom burning , but we produce two sets of yields - one with the normal third dredge - up and one without ( see below for details ) . the chemical yield model without ( with ) the third dredge - up",
    "are referred to as ya1 ( ya2 ) in the present study .",
    "table 1 shows the mass fraction of the above eleven species in agb ejecta from campbell et al .",
    "we consider that @xmath73 should be similar to typical values of old halo stars in the galaxy ( e.g. , goswami & prantzos 2000 ; venn et al .",
    "2004 ) and the adopted values of @xmath73 are summarized in table 2 for four different models .",
    "the details of the models without third dredge - up are given in campbell ( 2006 ) . throughout this study",
    ", we assume that [ fe / h ] is the same between infalling gas and agb ejecta .",
    "this assumption is reasonable , because we consider that gas from sneii can be expelled from dwarf efficiently during galaxy formation .",
    "we do not include the effects of massive rotating stars on the chemical evolution of proto - gc clouds in the present study , because we intend to understand more clearly the roles of agb stars in the chemical evolution : we need to derive separately the roles of agb stars and those of massive rotating stars in the chemical evolution .",
    "we mainly show the results of the models that use the agb yields with no third dredge - up , though we investigate the models with and without third dredge - up . it should be stressed here that the models with no third dredge - up are purely hypothetical ones that have not yet been proved .",
    "previous studies based on self - pollution models with third dredge - up in agb stars failed to explain many of the observations of abundance inhomogeneity in gcs ( e.g. , fenner et al . 2004 ) .",
    "if our models can successfully reproduce some observations that were not explained by previous ones , we can obtain some insights into the `` culprits '' in the self - pollution or external pollution scenarios .",
    "the abundance inhomogeneity of gcs in the present models with no third dredge - up originates from pure hydrogen burning , which is available in hbb agb stars .",
    "the present models with third dredge - up can not explain at all most of the observed correlations between different abundances ( e.g. , the [ c / fe]-[n / fe ] anticorrelation ) .",
    "for example , these models can not produce stars with [ c / fe ] @xmath80 and [ n / fe ] @xmath81 , because [ n / fe ] increases with the increase of [ c / fe ] during the chemical evolution owing to the c - rich ejecta of agb stars .",
    "furthermore , the observed cn - bimodality of stars can not be reproduced in these models , owing to the lack of c - depleted , n - rich stars in these models .",
    "these failures would suggest that _ agb stars are not the polluters that are responsible for the observed abundance inhomogeneity in gcs_. we however consider that it is still worthwhile to investigate abundance properties of gcs by using different agb models ( i.e. , those with no third dredge - up ) in the present study for the above - mentioned reason .",
    "it should also be stressed here that the present models with no third dredge - up can better explain observations , because we adopt the star formation histories of proto - gc clouds in the external pollution scenario : successful reproduction of some observations in the present study is due to the _ combination of the adopted models both with no third dredge - up and star formation histories of the external pollution scenario_.    further , at present there are no yields available for the so - called `` super - agb stars '' , which are more massive agb stars that experience thermal pulses after core carbon burning .",
    "the few calculations in existence ( e.g. , ritossa et al 1996 ; gil - pons et al 2005 ; siess 2006 ) show that these stars experience very hot hbb and very little dredge - up .",
    "qualitatively this is what is required to solve the gc problem , so our models without dredge - up may simulate to some extent the yields from these stars , while we await full evolution and nucleosynthesis calculations for the appropriate masses and compositions .",
    "we close this section with some comments about the reliability of agb star yields .",
    "we believe that the balance of evidence indicates that agb stars with dredge - up are not the site of the abundance inhomogeneities seen in globular cluster stars . however , there are still so many uncertainties that it may still be possible for these stars to produce the abundance profiles required .",
    "for example , the depth of dredge - up is still very uncertain , the temperature profile in the hbb envelope depends on the convection theory ( e.g. , ventura & dantona 2005a , b , c ) as well as associated parameters , mass - loss and of course various reaction rates .",
    "although previous studies ( ventura et al . 2002 ; ventura & dantona 2005c ) provided useful tables for stellar yields of agb stars , the lack of tables for some abundances ( e.g. , the lack of a table for al abundance in ventura & dantona 2005c ) currently does not allow us to investigate the o - na and mg - al anticorrelations in a fully self - consistent manner .",
    "it is thus our future study to compare the present results with those based on chemical evolution models using tables from works other than campbell ( 2006 ) .",
    "more comments on agb models with and without third dredge - up are given in the appendix b.      one of the most important parameters that govern the chemical evolution of gcs in the external pollution scenario is the ratio ( @xmath1 ) of the total mass of the infalling gas ( @xmath82 ) to that of agb ejecta ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "we investigate the models with @xmath1 ( @xmath83 ) ranging from 0.1 to 100 and thereby isolated the best values of @xmath1 that can explain observations .",
    "the time scale of gas infall ( @xmath2 ) is also an important parameter that can control final abundance distributions of gcs in the present study .",
    "we investigate models with @xmath2 ranging from @xmath84 yr to @xmath62 yr and show important results of the models .    although these @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the most important parameters , the initial gas mass @xmath85 can also change abundance distributions in a less dramatic manner for a given @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "we investigate the models with @xmath86 and show the results of some representative models .",
    "table 3 summarizes the parameter values used for the 15 models investigated in the present study .",
    "we first present the results of the fiducial model m1 , which shows interesting and important results , in  3.1 .",
    "we then describe the dependences of the results on the two key parameters ( @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) in  3.2 .    by changing @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath85",
    ", we can construct a model that can explain reasonably well the abundance distribution for a specific gc .",
    "for example , the model m11 shows a bimodal [ n / fe ] distribution with the normalized number fraction of n - rich and c - depleted stars being equal to that of the n - normal and c - normal ones and thus is consistent with the observed cn distribution in ngc 6752 ( e.g. , smith & norris 1993 ) .",
    "since we are focusing on the general behaviors resulting from parameter dependences of the models , we do not discuss extensively the abundance distributions of individual gcs .",
    "we however just briefly discuss the origin of he abundance distributions of different stellar populations in @xmath6 cen in the appendix a , because this issue is quite topical and is currently being investigated extensively by different theoretical models ( e.g. , bekki & norris 2006 ; maeder & meynet 2006 ) .    in order to compare the present models with previous ones ( e.g. , fenner et al .",
    "2004 , ventura & dantona 2005c ) , we compare the present results with the same observational ones ( yong et al .",
    "2003 for ngc 6752 ) that have been already compared also with these previous studies in  3 .",
    "we also compare the present results with other more recent observations on abundances of stars ( in particular , less evolved stars ) in gcs ( e.g. ramirez & cohen 2002 ; briley et al .",
    "2004a , b ; carretta et al . 2005",
    "; cohen et al .",
    "2005 ) and assess the viability of the external pollution scenario later in  4.1",
    "2 shows the time evolution of the fiducial model m1 in comparison with the model m2 on the [ c / fe]-[n / fe ] plane .",
    "there are differences in initial abundances of infalling gas between models m1 and m2 ( e.g. , [ c / fe ] and [ n / fe ] ) .",
    "since these abundances are estimated for new stars formed at each time step in a gc , each location of the line represents abundances of stars with given ages rather than the mean abundances of the gc .",
    "as the proto - gc cloud is polluted by ejecta from more massive field agb stars ( @xmath87 ) , [ n / fe ] and [ c / fe ] in the cloud rapidly increases and decreases , respectively .",
    "gas infall increases the total gas mass of the cloud ( and thus the density ) and consequently increases gradually star formation in the cloud . as a result of this ,",
    "new stars that formed from the gas , which is a mix of infalling gas and agb ejecta , can have higher [ n / fe ] and lower [ c / fe ] .",
    "as a larger amount of agb ejecta is accumulated in the cloud at later times , new stars formed later can have higher [ n / fe ] and lower [ c / fe ] than those formed earlier .",
    "thus stars with higher [ n / fe ] can show lower [ c / fe ] in the fiducial model m1 and this anticorrelation between [ n / fe ] and [ c / fe ] can be seen in most models .",
    "although the fiducial model can qualitatively explain the observed anticorrelation in fig . 2 ( e.g. , norris et al .",
    "1981 ; smith & norris 1993 ) , it does not pass the observed location of the n - rich population in ngc 6752 .",
    "this quantitative inconsistency between the model and the observation can be seen in the comparative model m2 with initially small [ n / fe ] in the infalling gas that can significantly dilute [ n / fe ] during star formation within gcs . in the present model , [ n / fe ]",
    "always becomes significantly high ( @xmath88 ) _ when [ c / fe ] becomes low irrespective of the infall rate of n - poor gas .",
    "_ since only two data points ( i.e. , two stars ) shown in fig .",
    "2 are obviously not enough to make any robust conclusions on the quantitative consistency of the present model with observations , we discuss the consistency of the model by using more data sets later in  4.1 .    as a result of gradual increase ( decrease ) of [ n / fe ] ( [ c / fe ] ) due to agb pollution",
    ", new stars formed at different times can have different [ n / fe ] and [ c / fe ] and thus show abundance inhomogeneity in [ n / fe ] and [ c / fe ] .",
    "3 , showing the normalized number distributions of stars with different [ n / fe ] and [ c / fe ] in m1 , demonstrates that the [ n / fe ] distribution has a clearer bimodality than the [ c / fe ] distribution .",
    "most n - rich stars with [ n / fe ] @xmath89 show a lower [ c / fe ] ( @xmath90 ) , as expected from chemical pollution from massive agb stars . owing to the adopted density - dependent star formation rate ,",
    "the gas infall causes two peaks in the star formation rate in m1 .",
    "new stars formed during the first peak of star formation can have lower [ n / fe ] whereas those formed during the second peak can have higher [ n / fe ] due to a higher degree of agb pollution .",
    "the reason for the apparent absence of the bimodality in [ c / fe ] is that [ c / fe ] can not dramatically change within a short time scale ( @xmath13 yr ) so that new stars can show a much narrower [ c / fe ] distribution ( i.e. , the bimodality can not be evident for the adopted binning ) .",
    "the final _ mean _ [ c / fe ] and [ n / fe ] at @xmath91 yr are -0.09 and 0.85 , respectively .",
    "as the gas mass of the proto - gc cloud increases owing to accumulation of agb material in m1 , the he abundance ( y ) of the gas also increases in a monotonic fashion : the final _ mean _ y at @xmath91 yr is 0.26 whereas the final y of stars _ formed at @xmath91 yr _ is 0.33 . as a result of this , new stars formed later will have higher y than those formed earlier . since agb ejecta increases [ n / fe ] rapidly ,",
    "new stars that form later and thus have higher y can show higher [ n / fe ] .",
    "4 clearly shows a positive yet non - linear correlation between y and [ n / fe ] in new stars of gcs for m1 .",
    "this correlation can be seen in almost all models in the present study and thus is simply a result of h - burning .",
    "owing to the time - evolution of y in the gas cloud , new stars formed at different times show different y , which results in a y inhomogeneity in the gc .",
    "5 clearly shows that as the proto - gc cloud is polluted by agb ejecta to a larger extent , newly formed stars show a larger degree of y inhomogeneity .",
    "furthermore , the location of the peak in the y distribution is also shifted to the higher values as the agb pollution proceeds : the peak value changes from 0.23 at @xmath92 myr to 0.25 at @xmath93 myr .",
    "these results imply that the time scale of gc formation is an important factor which can determine y distributions of gcs .    since abundances in the present model either increase or decrease in a monotonic fashion as agb pollution proceeds , strong correlations or anticorrelations can be expected between different abundances of stars in a gc .",
    "6 shows that y can anticorrelate with [ c / fe ] , [ o / fe ] , and [ na / fe ] , though the dependences are not necessarily linear .",
    "these correlations can be expected for any chemical evolution models of gcs using stellar yields of agb stars with no 3rd dredge - up .",
    "7 shows the time evolution of m1 in the [ mg / fe]-[al / fe ] plane and the observations of bright red giant stars in ngc 6752 ( yong et al . 2003 ) . as a natural result of ongoing chemical pollution of the proto - gc cloud by field agb stars , the [ mg / fe ] and [ al / fe ] ratios of new stars within the gc decrease and increase , respectively , as agb pollution proceeds .",
    "although the observed [ mg / fe]-[al / fe ] anticorrelation can be well reproduced qualitatively , the observed slope of the anticorrelation and the ranges of [ mg / fe ] and [ al / fe ] are not consistent with the predicted values : a shallower slope of the anticorrelation , a wider range of [ mg / fe ] , a smaller range of [ al / fe ] are clearly seen in the model .",
    "this inconsistency can be seen in the model m3 with initially higher [ al / fe ] .",
    "although all models in the present study show [ mg / fe]-[al / fe ] anticorrelations , none of the models shows slopes as steep as the observed one for ngc 6752 .",

    "a consequence of this is that the field stars in dwarfs on average should be older and more metal - poor than gcs when gcs are formed in this scenario .",
    "accordingly , if dwarfs with gcs can be destroyed by the tidal field of the proto - galaxy to form the galactic field halo stars and the halo gcs soon after gc formation , the field halo stars are highly likely to be more metal - poor than the halo gcs in this scenario .",

    "if the origin of the second parameter problem is related to the difference in helium abundance between gcs ( see catlan 2005 for a recent review ) , the external pollution scenario suggests that the origin of the problem can be closely associated with differences in agb pollution processes ( controlled mainly by the two parameters , @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) between different proto - gc clouds in the central regions of forming dwarfs at high @xmath0 .",
    "norris ( 1987 ) investigated possible correlations between the @xmath96 parameter and other physical properties of gcs ( e.g. , metallicities and luminosities ) and found that there exists a correlation between ellipticities ( @xmath110 ) of gc shapes and the values of the @xmath96 parameters ( see smith ( 2002 ) for recent confirmation of this correlation ) .",

    "norris ( 1987 ) however pointed out that this explanation has a difficulty in explaining the existence of cn - enhanced stars near the main - sequence turnoff of 47 tuc ( bell et al . 1983 ) unless the effects of rotation are efficient for main - sequence stars .",
    "furthermore it is unclear why stars within gcs with a larger amount of intrinsic angular momentum would have a larger amount of stellar rotation in this scenario by norris ( 1987 ) .    in the present external pollution scenario ,",
    "the values of the @xmath96 parameters depend strongly on the relative mass fraction of agb ejecta with respect to the total gas mass ( i.e. , agb ejecta + fresh infall gas ) in proto - gcs : the higher the fraction is , the larger the @xmath96 becomes .",
    "one of possible explanations for the above @xmath110-@xmath96 correlation in the context of the external pollution is therefore that whenever a larger amount of agb ejecta can be transferred into proto - gc regions ( i.e. , central regions of their host dwarfs ) , the gas is highly likely to have a larger amount of angular momentum , from which gcs with a larger amount of angular momentum and thus with larger @xmath110 can be formed .",
    "we suggest that the above situation of the larger amount of agb ejecta with higher ( specific ) angular momentum is likely if field stars in the central regions of dwarfs ( thus , agb polluters for proto - gcs ) have rotational kinematics : agb ejecta from such stars rotating dwarfs can also have orbital angular momentum ( with respect to the centers of dwarfs ) so that gcs formed from the ejecta in the centers can have rotational kinematics and thus large @xmath110 after conversion of orbital angular momentum of gas into intrinsic spin angular momentum of gcs during gc formation .",
    "it is thus our future study to investigate ( i ) whether orbital angular momentum of agb ejecta from field stars rotating dwarfs can be really converted into intrinsic spin angular momentum of gcs and ( ii ) whether gcs have a larger amount of intrinsic spin angular momentum thus larger @xmath110 , if they are formed from gas with a larger fraction of agb ejecta .",

    "if [ n / fe ] of gcs can be controlled by nuclear dynamics of their host dwarfs at very high @xmath0 , as suggested by the present study , more luminous galaxies would have both a larger number of gcs with high [ n / fe ] and more metal - rich ( thus redder ) stellar halos .",
    "we thus suggest that future high - resolution spectroscopic studies for gc abundances in galaxies beyond the local group , combined with wide - field imaging of stellar halos in these galaxies , can give some constraints on the formation histories of gcs within dwarfs at very high @xmath0 .",
    "we have investigated the abundance inhomogeneity among the light elements ( e.g. , c , n , o , na , and al ) in stars in the galactic gcs by adopting the external pollution scenario and using latest stellar yield models of metal - poor agb stars with and without third dredge - up . in the external pollution scenario ,",
    "gcs within a forming low - mass dwarf embedded in a dark matter halo can be formed from the mixture of ( i ) gas ejected from the field agb stars formed earlier in the dwarf and ( ii ) the interstellar gas infalling to the central region of the dwarf .",
    "we extensively investigated our models with no third dredge - up over wide parameter ranges .",
    "we summarise our principal results of the models as follows .",
    "\\(1 ) the ratio of the total mass of infalling gas to that of agb ejecta during gc formation within a forming dwarf galaxy ( described by the @xmath1 parameter ) and the time scale of gas infall ( @xmath2 ) are the most important parameters that can determine abundance properties of gcs .",
    "\\(2 ) both [ n / fe ] and [ c / fe ] can be diverse among stars within a gc owing to chemical pollution from field agb stars .",
    "[ n / fe ] distributions in some gcs can clearly show bimodality where s [ c / fe ] can be monomodal in most models .",
    "[ n / fe ] distributions depend on @xmath1 , such that models with smaller @xmath1 ( i.e. , larger mass fraction of agb ejecta used for gc formation ) show the [ n / fe ] bimodality more clearly .",
    "\\(3 ) n - rich , c - poor stars in gcs also have higher he abundances owing to pollution from massive agb stars with he - rich ejecta . the number fraction of he - rich stars ( y @xmath3 ) is higher for the models with smaller @xmath1 and shorter @xmath2 for @xmath4 and @xmath5 yr . he abundances of stars can correlate with [ n / fe ] and [ al / fe ] and anticorrelate with [ c / fe ] , [ o / fe ] , and [ na / fe ] within gcs ( and a simple consequence of h - burning ) .",
    "\\(4 ) although our models can much better explain the observed c - n and mg - al anticorrelations than previous theoretical models , the observed o - na anticorrelation can not by simply explained by any models with different parameters in this scenario .",
    "the inability of the present models to match the observations results from the adopted agb yields and thus suggests that models using different agb yields need to be explored to assess the viability of agb pollution scenarios ( for more details , see appendix b ) .",
    "\\(5 ) extensive comparison between the models and the observations demonstrates that the predicted [ c / fe]-[n / fe ] anticorrelation can be more quantitatively consistent with observations for less evolved stars ( ms populations , subgiants , and dwarfs ) than for evolved ones ( e.g. , red giants ) .",
    "the comparison also demonstrates that the observed [ c / fe ] and [ n / fe ] distributions for less evolved stars are at least qualitatively consistent with the model predictions .",
    "\\(6 ) one important prediction of our models is that gcs with higher degrees of abundance inhomogeneity should show a larger color spread ( e.g. , @xmath107 ) in their ms populations as the result of bluer stars formed from he - rich gas .",
    "accordingly , it would be worthwhile for future observational studies to investigate correlations between the @xmath96 parameters ( i.e. , the number ratio of cn - strong to cn - weak stars ) and @xmath107 in gcs .",
    "\\(7 ) the values of the two key parameters ( @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) are suggested to be controlled by stellar and gas dynamics in the central regions of host galaxies of gcs .",
    "central stellar and gas dynamics ( e.g. , gas fueling rates to the central 10 pc ) have been suggested to be controlled by global properties ( e.g. , total masses and densities ) of galaxies .",
    "accordingly , abundance inhomogeneities of gcs may have fossil information on ( i ) formation and evolution histories of central regions of defunct dwarfs and ( ii ) physical properties of the dwarfs .",
    "thus we have shown that the cn - bimodality and the number fraction of c - depleted , n - rich populations of a gc can give strong constants on the short - term ( an order of @xmath62 yr ) star formation history of the proto - gc cloud of the gc , if the cloud is chemically polluted by agb stars .",
    "we accordingly suggest that any theoretical models for the origin of gc abundances need to explain not only the o - na and mg - al anticorrelations but also the bimodal cn abundance distributions in gcs .",

    "bedin et al . ( 2004 ) suggested that stars on the bluer main sequence ( bms ) of the double main sequence ( dms ) can be a very helium - rich ( @xmath106 ) population .",
    "a number of recent investigations have suggested that a higher degree of he enhancement in the bms is a viable explanation for the origin of the dms ( e.g. , lee et al . 2005 ; norris 2004 ; piotto et al .",
    "2005 ) and recent analytical works by bekki & norris ( 2006 ) have suggested that he enhancement due to self - pollution ( or more correctly , external pollution ) of agb stars can explain the origin of the bms .",
    "it however remains unclear whether such agb pollution scenarios can _ quantitatively _ explain the observed abundance properties ( e.g. , [ c / fe ] , [ n / fe ] , and y ) in a self - consistent manner .",
    "a1 shows y , [ c / fe ] , and [ n / fe ] distributions of the model m14 in which very small @xmath1 ( i.e. , a higher degree of agb pollution ) , smaller @xmath2 ( i.e. , more rapid gas infall ) , and smaller @xmath85 ( i.e. , more rapid chemical enrichment ) are adopted so that the model shows a large fraction of he - rich stars .",
    "owing to the modeled very larger degree of agb pollution , stars in this model shows a large fraction of he - rich ( @xmath114 ) and n - rich ( @xmath89 ) stars .",
    "piotto et al .",
    "( 2005 ) have reported that ( i ) the he - rich bms shows a rather large nitrogen abundance ( [ n / m ] @xmath115 ) and ( ii ) it is not very rich in c ( [ c / m]=0 ) .",
    "the result in fig .",
    "a1 implies that these observations can be due to agb pollution , though the c abundance of the bms is not so consistent with the predicted one . an important result in fig .",
    "a1 is that some fraction ( @xmath116 ) of stars show relatively normal y ( @xmath117 ) .",
    "this suggest that if the bms is formed from gas polluted by agb stars , stars with relatively normal y are also formed , though the mass fraction of the he - normal population is small .",
    "this may well provide a clue to the origin of the observed normal y ( = 0.246 ) for the metal - intermediate rrl stars ( that would have been formed with the bms ) in @xmath6 cen ( sollima et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "very luminous gcs such as @xmath6 cen in the galaxy and g1 in m31 have long been suggested to originate from nuclei of ancient nucleated systems , where continuous gas infall and chemical enrichment were highly likely to occur ( e.g. , hilker & richtler 2000 ; bekki & freeman 2003 ; bekki & chiba 2004 ) .",
    "as demonstrated above , the total mass of agb ejecta used for the he - rich population in @xmath6 cen needs to be @xmath118 6 times larger than that of infalling gas not enriched by agb stars .",
    "it remains unclear whether this can really happen in the nuclei of dwarf galaxies that are considered to be progenitors of very luminous gcs like @xmath6 cen and g1 .",
    "current standard models of intermediate - mass agb stars with third dredge - up ( 3dup ) do not reproduce the observed c - n , o - na or mg - al inverse - correlations observed in most gcs .",
    "we note however that the models of ventura & dantona ( 2005b ) do come close , due to their use and development of an alternative theory of convection , which alters the evolution of their models significantly ( see e.g. , ventura & dantona 2005a ) . in the standard models",
    "the combination of hot bottom burning ( hbb ) and 3dup during agb evolution does predict enhancements of nitrogen , sodium and aluminium , and a reduction in oxygen  all of which are needed to explain the observations  however they also predict an increase of carbon and magnesium , giving positive c - n and mg - al correlations which is in direct violation of the observations .",
    "in addition to this the models do not _ quantitatively _ account for the large degree of o depletion and tend to over - produce na , thus falling short of the mark with the o - na inverse - correlation as well ( e.g. , denissenkov et al .",
    "1997 ; denissenkov & herwig 2003 ; ventura et al .",
    "furthermore the standard agb models produce ejecta with an overall increase in cno nuclei of @xmath118 1 to 3 dex ( mainly due to the dredge - up of carbon ) , whilst observations show that the sum of cno nuclei is virtually constant , varying by a factor of only two or so at most ( e.g. , pilachowski 1988 ; smith et al .",
    "1996 ; ivans et al .",
    "these discrepancies are based on confronting single stellar models with observations .",
    "taking the evolution of an entire cluster of stars into account  in particular convolving with an imf  presents further problems as the stars with the prerequisite hot hydrogen burning are few in number when using a standard imf ( e.g. , fenner et al . 2004 ) , whilst these stars need to contribute an amount of polluting material that is a large fraction of the gc mass . despite all these discrepancies",
    "it should be stressed that the agb pollution scenario should not be dismissed outright just yet , as the models are well known to have many serious uncertainties ( e.g. , the treatment of convection , overshoot , mass loss and the uncertainties in reaction rates ) .",
    "for example the non - standard models of ventura & dantona ( 2005b ) , which use a different convection model , can reproduce most of the abundance anomalies , although some overshooting and the adoption of a high mass - loss rate is required .",
    "in addition to the uncertainties in the input physics of all stellar models , numerical details can also significantly affect the results .",
    "for example , time - stepping during diffusive mixing can cause changes in the stellar structure , hence altering the temperature at the bottom of the convective envelope , and thus the resulting nucleosynthesis and yields ( siess , private communication ) .",
    "attempts have been made to reconcile the ( standard ) models with the observations but have universally ended with a need to ` tweak ' the relative effects of hbb and 3dup to an unpalatable degree ( e.g. , denissenkov & herwig 2003 ) , also suggested by fenner et al .",
    "the models using a different convection formalism ( ventura & dantona 2005b ) show a better agreement with observations but , as mentioned earlier , also need some overshooting and the adoption of a high mass - loss rate .    with the results of all these stellar modelling studies in mind we have chosen to investigate the limiting case by utilising yields from agb models that do not experience any 3dup , which we have calculated ourselves .",
    "although ` turning off ' 3dup in our models is ad - hoc , it was surprisingly easy to achieve . by adding an extra physical condition for the determination of convective boundaries ( the molecular weight gradient ) via implementing the ledoux criterion rather than the schwarzschild criterion we found that no dredge - up at all occurred in our models .",
    "we note that we have not extended the convective boundaries past the formal ones given by the ledoux criterion .",
    "we leave the detailed description of the models for a separate paper , but now discuss the nucleosynthetic results relevant for the current problem .",
    "decoupling 3dup from hbb exposes the dependence of the yields on the interplay between the two processes and provides a possible solution to the mismatch between theory and observation . at the very least , by separating the effects it is a useful investigative tool .",
    "a salient result from our new stellar models , evident in table 1 , is that oxygen is now heavily depleted in the more massive stars . also of importance",
    "is the fact that there is now an opposite trend for mg ( in the same stars )  it is depleted instead of produced .",
    "furthermore , the c is depleted whilst the n yield remains high .",
    "all of these features derive from the lack of 3dup , as o is now not periodically replenished , c can not increase and fresh fuel for the mgal cycle is not available .",
    "the lack of 3dup also implies that the sum of cno nuclei will remain constant , as fresh cno is not added to the envelope and the cno burning cycles ( occurring at the base of the convective envelope ) conserve the number of cno nuclei .",
    "all these features indicate that a better fit to the observations is expected ( imf withstanding ) .",
    "also , as stated above , these models may simulate the effects of a previously ignored population of stars , the super - agb stars .",
    "the main discrepancy we now have  in terms of comparing at a single mass  is with na . at the high masses ( ie .",
    "temperatures ) required to deplete o and mg via the mgal and on cycles , na is not produced enough , or rather it is destroyed too much by proton captures , resulting in low yields . moving to lower masses ( temperatures ) improves the na situation but prevents o and mg from being depleted .",
    "interestingly this is the identical problem that ventura & dantona ( 2005b ) have with their best - fit ( for the na - o inverse - correlation ) model .",
    "denissenkov & herwig ( 2003 ) also report this problem .",
    "we note that the models of ventura & dantona ( 2005b ) are quite independent as they use a different treatment for convection . in a recent and very timely study ventura & dantona ( 2006 )",
    "have investigated this problem in detail , finding that their stellar model requires either the addition of some overshooting or a reduction of the @xmath119na@xmath120ne reaction rate in order to produce the required na yield whilst maintaining the o destruction .",
    "the ventura and dantona ( 2005b , 2006 ) models , like our more ad - hoc models , otherwise match the abundance anomalies fairly well , with the strong exception of the mg isotopes , which seem resistant to any approach tried thus far .",
    "note that we do not suggest that real agb models of low metallicity do not suffer from the 3dup .",
    "rather we have used this as an investigative tool to simulate reduced 3dup , or sagb stars with little or no 3dup , or some other source of ( almost ) pure h - burning .",
    "clearly a thorough understanding , and reliable quantitative prediction of 3dup is still required , for stars of all masses and metallicities ."

    "<S> \\(1 ) both [ n / fe ] and [ c / fe ] can be diverse among stars within a gc owing to chemical pollution from field agb stars . </S>",
    "<S> [ n / fe ] distributions in some gcs can clearly show bimodality whereas [ c / fe ] is monomodal in most models . </S>",
    "<S> [ n / fe ] distributions depend on @xmath1 such that models with smaller @xmath1 ( i.e. , larger mass fraction of agb ejecta used for gc formation ) show the [ n / fe ] bimodality more clearly .    </S>",

    "<S> . the number fraction of he - rich stars ( y @xmath3 ) is higher for the models with smaller @xmath1 and shorter @xmath2 for @xmath4 and @xmath5 yr . he abundances of stars correlate with [ n / fe ] and [ al / fe ] and anticorrelate with [ c / fe ] , [ o / fe ] , and [ na / fe ] within gcs in our models .    </S>",
