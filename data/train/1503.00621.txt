    "the financial crisis has boosted the development of several network - based methodologies to monitor systemic risk in the financial system @xcite .",
    "a traditional approach towards the quantification of systemic risk is to measure the effects of a shock on the external assets of each institution and then to aggregate the losses .",
    "however , the crisis has highlighted that stress - testing should also incorporate so called `` second - round '' effect , which might arise via interbank exposures , either as losses on the asset side or liquidity shortages ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "for instance , the recent ecb comprehensive assessment carried out in 2014 @xcite goes into this direction by taking into account counterparty credit risk while the basel iii framework @xcite gives attention to interconnectedness as a key source of systemic risk .",
    "some network - based methods focus on the events of a bank s default ( i.e. its equity going to zero ) as the only relevant trigger for the contagion to be passed on to the counterparties . in other words ,",
    "an institution that has faced some shocks will not affect its counterparties in any way as long as it is left with some positive equity .",
    "this is a useful simplification which has allowed for a number of mathematical developments @xcite . because regulators recommend banks to keep their largest single exposure well below their level of equity , most stress test conducted in this way yield essentially to the result that a single initial bank default never triggers any other default .",
    "systemic risk emerges only if , at the same time , one assumes a scenario of weak balance sheets @xcite or a scenario of fire sales @xcite .",
    "in contrast , both the intuition and the classic merton approach , suggest that the loss of equity of an institution , even with no default , will imply a decrease in the market value of its obligations to other institutions . in turn , this means a loss of equity for those institutions , as long as they revalue their equity as the difference between assets and liabilities .",
    "therefore , financial distress , meant as loss of equity , can spread from a bank to another although no default occurs in between .",
    "the total loss of equity in the system can be substantial even if no bank ever defaults in the process .",
    "indeed , in the 2007/2008 crisis , losses due to the mark - to - market re - evaluation of counterparty risk were much higher than losses due from direct defaults . ]",
    "the so - called debtrank methodology has been developed with the very idea to capture such a distress propagation @xcite .",
    "the impact of a shock , as measured by debtrank , is fully comparable to the traditional default - only propagation mechanisms @xcite in the sense that the latter is a lower bound for the former . in other words , debtrank measures at least the impact that one would have with the defaults - only , but it is typically larger and this allows to assign a level of systemic importance in most situations in which the traditional method would be unable to do so because the impact would be zero for all banks .",
    "debtrank has been applied to several empirical contexts @xcite but it was not so far been embedded into a stress - test framework . in this paper , building on the method introduced in @xcite , we develop a stress - test _ framework _ aimed at providing central bankers and practitioners with a monitoring tool of the network effects .",
    "the main contributions of our works are as follows .",
    "first , the framework delivers not only an estimation of _ first - round _ ( shock on external assets ) , and _ second - round _ ( distress induced in the interbank network ) effects , but also a _ third - round _ effect consisting in possible further losses induced by fire sales . to this end",
    "we incorporate a simple mechanism by which banks determine the necessary sales of the asset that was shocked in order to recover their previous leverage level and assuming a linear market impact of the sale on the price of the asset .",
    "the three effects are disentangled and can be tracked separately to assess their relative magnitude according to a variety of scenarios on the initial shock on external assets and on liquidity of the asset market .",
    "second , the framework allows to monitor at the same time the _ impact _ and the _ vulnerability _ of financial institutions . in other words , institutions",
    "whose default would cause a large loss to the system become problematic only if they are exposed to large losses when their counterparties or their assets get shocked .",
    "these quantities are computed through two _ networks of leverage _ that are the main linkage between the notion of capital requirements and the notion of interconnectedness .",
    "third , the framework allows to estimate loss distributions both at the individual bank level and at the global level , allowing for the computation of individual and global var and cvar ( table [ tab : variables ] ) .",
    "fourth , since data on bilateral exposures are seldom available , the framework includes a module to estimate the interbank network of bilateral exposures given the information on the total lending and borrowing of each bank . here",
    ", we use a combination of fitness model @xcite , for the network structure and an iterative fitting method to estimate the lending volumes , but alternative methods could be used or added as benchmark comparison ( e.g. the maximum entropy method @xcite , or the minimum density method @xcite .",
    "finally , the framework has been developed in matlab and is available upon request to the authors .",
    "as an illustration , we carry out a stress - test exercise on a dataset of 183 european banks over the years @xmath0@xmath1 , starting from the estimation of their interbank exposures .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : related work ] we review similar or related work ; in section [ sec : stress - test ] we describe the main aspects of the framework , providing an outline of the distress process , a discussion of the main variables , and the framework s building blocks ; in section [ sec : exercise ] , we show how the framework can be applied to a dataset and we discuss the main results of this exercise ; in section [ sec : discussion ] , we review the main contributions and introduce elements for future research . in appendix",
    "[ sec : methods ] , we provide the technical details of the distress propagation process , including how the key measures are computed ; in the appendix [ sec : data_collection ] , we described the data we used for the exercise in section [ sec : exercise ] and , last , in appendix [ sec : network_reconstruction ] , we outline the network reconstruction methods when only the total interbank lending / borrowing for each bank is known .",
    "the recent  and still ongoing  economic and financial crisis has made clear the importance of methods of early detection of systemic risk in the financial system . in particular , researchers , regulators and policy - makers have recognized the importance of adopting a macroprudential approach to understand and mitigate financial stability .",
    "notwithstanding the many efforts @xcite , regulators still lack an adequate framework to measure and address systemic risk .",
    "the traditional micro - prudential approach consists in trying and ensuring the stability of the banks , one by one , with the assumption that as long as each unit is safe the system is safe .",
    "this approach has demonstrated to be a dangerous over - simplification of the situation @xcite .",
    "indeed , we have learned that it is precisely the interdependence among institutions , both in terms of liabilities or complex financial instruments and in terms of common exposure to asset classes what leads to the emergence of systemic risk and makes the prediction of the behaviour of financial systems so difficult @xcite .",
    "while risk diversification at a single institution can indeed lower its individual risk , if all institutions behave in a similar way , herding behaviour can instead amplify the risk . clearly , if all banks take similar positions , the failure of one bank can cause a global distress @xcite , because of the increased sensitivity to price changes @xcite . to add more complexity , the causes of market movements are still under debate @xcite , suggesting that exogenous instabilities add up to endogenous ones @xcite . the tension between individual regulation and global regulation @xcite poses a series of challenging questions to researchers , practitioners and regulators @xcite",
    "traditionally , well before the recent crisis , it was argued that systemic risk is real when contagion phenomena across countries take place @xcite . in this spirit , a series of studies dealt with the description of systemic risk in the financial system from the perspective of the contagion channels across balance - sheet of several institutions @xcite . in particular ,",
    "some focus was drawn upon the topology of connections ( or the network @xcite ) between institutions @xcite .    in this way , the problem of analysing systemic risk splits in two distinct problems @xcite .",
    "first , the problem of understanding the role of an opaque ( if not unknown ) structure of financial contracts @xcite and , second , the problem of providing a measure for the assessment of the impact of a given shock @xcite . as for the first problem , the obvious starting point is to consider the structure of the interbank network @xcite , with the aim of possibly extracting some early warning signals @xcite .",
    "while many argued that the network structure can be intrinsically a source of instability , it turns out instead that no specific topology can be considered as systematically safer than the others @xcite .",
    "indeed , only the interplay between market liquidity , capital requirements and network structure can help in the understanding of the systemic risk @xcite .",
    "for the second problem , researchers have tried to describe the dynamics of propagation of defaults with various methods , including by means of agent - based models @xcite or by modelling the evolution of financial distress across balance - sheets conditional upon shocks in one or more institutions @xcite .    from the perspective of financial regulations ,",
    "capital requirements represent the cornerstone of prudential regulations .",
    "institutions are required to hold capital as a buffer to shocks of any nature . the most used risk measures ( such as value at risk and expected shortfall )",
    "are indeed related to the quantity of cash each individual bank needs to set aside in order to cover the _ direct _ exposures to different types of risk . in such manner ,",
    "the _ indirect _ exposures arising from the interconnected nature of the financial system are not considered .",
    "interconnectedness , though , is now entering the debate on regulation : for example , the definition of `` global systemically important banks '' ( g - sibs , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) does include the concept of interconnectedness , thereby measured as the aggregate value of assets and liabilities each bank has with respect to other banking institutions .",
    "although this represents a fundamental step towards the inclusion of interconnectedness in assessing systemic risk , a further level of disaggregation would be needed .",
    "in fact , institutions that are similar in terms of their aggregated exposures ( including those _ vis -  - vis _ other financial institutions ) , might have completely different sets of counterparties , therefore implying different levels of systemic impact and/or vulnerability to shocks .",
    "another important point is that the potential negative effects arising from interconnectedness ought to be included into the definition of capital requirements .",
    "in this section , we introduce and describe the debtrank stress - test framework .",
    "one of the main characteristics of the framework lies in its _ flexibility _ along the following four main dimensions .",
    "* shock type*. the framework can implement different shock types and scenarios ( on external assets ) .",
    "* network estimation*. when detailed bilateral interbank exposures are not available , the framework provides a module to estimate the interbank network from the total interbank assets and liabilities of each bank , 3 .",
    "* contagion dynamics*. the framework can implement two different contagion dynamics , distress contagion and default contagion .",
    "* systemic risk indicators*. the framework returns as output a series of systemic risk indicators , both at the individual and a the global level .",
    "the user can aptly combine this information to extract the information needed .",
    "several graphical outputs are also available and represent a key feature of the framework : graphics are specifically designed to capture relevant information at a glance .    given the flexibility of the framework and the number of outputs produced , in the remainder of the section , we focus on :    1 .",
    "describing the main features of the debtrank _ distress process _ as the key foundation of the framework ; 2 .   providing a qualitative description of the main variables of interests ; 3 .   providing a technical summary of the _ building blocks _ of the framework , which include the _ inputs _ required , the _ outputs _ that can be obtained and the different _ modules _ constituting the framework",
    ".    the reader can find detailed information about the process and the main variables of interest in the methodological appendix [ sec : methods ] .",
    "one of the key concerns in the measurement of systemic risk is to quantify _ losses _ at the individual and global level . in particular , debtrank focuses on the depletion of equity when banks experience losses in external or interbank assets .",
    "we envision a system of @xmath2 banks ( indexed by @xmath3 ) and @xmath4 external assets ( indexed by @xmath5 ) .",
    "the framework features a dynamic distress model , with @xmath6 :    lll time & round & effects on balance sheets + @xmath7 & baseline & initial allocation +   + @xmath8 & first round effects &    .the distress dynamics.[tab : dynamics ] [ cols= \" < \" , ]      +",
    "the fundamental input data are represented by banks balance sheets . in particular",
    ", the framework takes the equity , the total asset value and the total interbank lending and borrowing of each bank as minimal inputs .",
    "more granular data on the structure of external assets are indeed possible ( e.g. in case one wants to simulate a shock on a specific asset class ) .",
    "the flexibility of the modeling framework allows for a number of shock scenarios , including :    1 .   a fixed shock ( e.g. @xmath9 ) on the value of all external assets ; 2 .   a shock on the value of all external assets drawn from a specific probability distribution ( e.g. a beta distribution , which we use in the exercise in section [ sec : exercise ] . ) ;",
    "when more detailed information on the holdings in external assets for banks is available , the shock ( either fixed or drawn from a probability distribution ) on specific asset classes .",
    "as outlined above , the framework allows to compute the main systemic risk variable for two main types of contagion dynamics :    1 .   the _ default cascade _ dynamics : banks impact other banks only in case of their default ( see , for the technical details , the discussion related to equation [ eq : main_debt_rank ] in the methodological appendix [ sec : methods ] . ) 2 .   the _ debtrank _ dynamics : banks impact other banks regardless of whether the event of default occurred .",
    "the rationale behind this type of dynamics is that , as banks reduce their equity levels to face losses , they decrease their distance to default and therefore are less likely to repay their obligations . in this case , the market value of their obligations is reduced and is hence reflected on the asset side of their counterparties in the interbank market .",
    "as detailed data on banks bilateral exposures are often not publicly available , estimations need to be performed in order to run the framework .",
    "even though such estimations constitute a key input of the stress test framework in case the exposures are not known , they constitute an output on their own , because they can be then analyzed with the typical tools of network analysis .",
    "also , the estimations can serve for two other purposes : i ) as a benchmark for comparison with the observed data , _  la _",
    "@xcite , or ii ) for the estimation of missing data @xcite . from a technical viewpoint , the methodology we use to estimate the interbank network",
    "is based on the so called `` fitness model '' @xcite .",
    "the technical details are reported in appendix [ sec : network_reconstruction ] .",
    "in order to show how the framework works and what type of outputs are available , in this section we apply the framework to a specific dataset of @xmath10 eu banks for the years @xmath11 .",
    "more details on the dataset are available in appendix [ sec : data_collection ] . in brief :    1 .",
    "we collect yearly data on equity , external assets , interbank assets and liabilities for the set of banks under scrutiny ; 2 .",
    "we estimated the exposures by combining the fitness model and an interative fitting procedure ( appendix [ sec : network_reconstruction ] ) , generating ( for each year ) @xmath12 networks compatible with the total interbank borrowing and lending of each bank at end - year ; 3 .",
    "we then ran the stress - test in order to obtain the main systemic risk variables for all years .",
    "when not explicitly specified , the statistics reported in this section are computed by taking the median value of the @xmath12 networks .    in the remainder of this section , we describe the main results , including some key charts and figures , in order to show part of the graphical output of the framework .",
    "figure [ fig : vulner_impact ] provides an overview of the response of the reconstructed financial networks and its individual elements to the distress scenarios simulated .",
    "the chart on the left shows the dynamics of global equity losses ( @xmath13 ) from @xmath0 to @xmath1 , the values reported are the median value of @xmath13 across the @xmath12 networks in the monte carlo sample and are computed for a common shock of @xmath9 on the external assets .",
    "the chart also offers a deconstruction of the losses , according to if they are caused by the first ( external assets shocks ) , second ( reverberation on the interbank lending network ) , and third ( fire sales ) round of distress propagation .",
    "the relative losses in equity due to the second and third rounds are substantial , implying that an assessment of systemic risk solely based on first order effects is bound to underestimate potential losses .",
    "the chart on the right shows the evolution of the impact for each of the @xmath10 banks in the sample throughout the years . each line is the median of the impact calculated over the @xmath12 networks in the ensemble .",
    "the plot clearly shows a general decrease in the systemic impact for the individual institutions over time . in order to visually capture the persistency over time of banks with higher or lower impact ,",
    "the colours reflect the level of the average impact computed over the years .",
    "in particular , red lines are associated to banks that consistently show a high impact .",
    "conversely , blue lines are associated to banks that have a consistently low impact .",
    "we observe a certain level of stability of the relative levels : banks which show a higher systemic impact tend to do so throughout the years .    from a systemic risk perspective",
    ", it is of particular interest to compare the two main systemic risk quantities associated to each individual bank : the vulnerability to external shocks and the impact of a bank onto the system in case of its default . by _",
    "jointly _ analyzing these two quantities , we divide institutions into four main categories : i ) high vulnerability / high impact , ii ) high vulnerability / low impact , iii ) low vulnerability / low impact , iv ) low vulnerability / high impact .",
    "results for this exercise are reported in figure [ fig : vuln_vs_imp ] .",
    "the graphs report a plot of the vulnerability @xmath14 at the second round versus the impact @xmath15 for each year in the sample .",
    "the @xmath16 \\times [ 0 , 1]$ ] square is divided into four quadrants , which correspond to the aforementioned four categories .",
    "interbank leverage and total asset size are respectively visualised by node colour ( red implies high leverage , blue otherwise ) and node size . both interbank leverage and asset",
    "size appear to be associated with high values of vulnerability and impact .",
    "we observe an interesting phenomenon : in @xmath0 , a high number of large ( in terms of asset size ) institutions are _ both _ highly vulnerable ( up to their default ) and impactful ( up to @xmath17 of the total initial equity ) . their systemic relevance is therefore extremely high , as they have higher likelihood to receive distress . in turn , once the distress has been received , they would have a great impact on the rest of the system .",
    "the situation improves over time and , in @xmath1 , no bank is in the upper right quadrant .",
    "some financial institutions retain , though , very high vulnerability and significant impact .",
    "a financial institution that can cause a global relative equity loss of 10% still acts as a source of systemic risk not to be ignored .",
    "however , some large institutions are still prone to receive high level of distress , and nevertheless keep a significant impact ( up to @xmath18 on the rest of the system ) .",
    "we also notice that those institutions which are both vulnerable and impactful are generally large and very large ones in terms of asset size .",
    "figure [ fig : eff_decomp ] shows a way of visualizing the decomposition of first and second round effects .",
    "again , we compare the years 2008 ( left ) and 2013 ( right ) .",
    "the x - axis plots the losses at the first round and y - axis the losses after the second round . since the losses at the second round _ include _ the ones at the first , points must lie above the line bisecting the first quadrant .",
    "nodes lying on the line itself are isolated in all the artificially generated networks .",
    "we observe a significant reduction in the effects . as usual , the color reflects the interbank leverage and circle diameter the asset size . consistently with the findings in appendix [",
    "sec : methods ] , nodes with higher interbank leverage typically suffer more losses in the second round .",
    "we evaluate a distribution of relative global equity losses by simulating @xmath21 different systemic shock levels drawn from a beta distribution . and",
    "@xmath22 respectively .",
    "the distribution has been then truncated in order to attain a maximum value of @xmath23 and a minimum of @xmath24 . ]",
    "figure [ fig : glob_losses_distr ] shows the distributions resulting by taking into account first only ( blue lines ) and second round ( red lines ) distress propagation effects for the years @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "vertical lines indicate var values at 95% , dashed lines are cvar at the same level ( see [ ssec : loss_distr ] for details ) .",
    "an extremely important consideration can be made from this figure : accounting for second order effects greatly increases the likelihood of having larger global equity losses , thus _ shifting _ var values towards the right . in @xmath0 ,",
    "a scenario where only first order distress is induced leads to a relatively low var level .",
    "this , instead , reaches a much higher value after the second round effect is added . a similar ,",
    "though less extreme , pattern is found in @xmath1 . the observed _ var shift _",
    "phenomenon is another compelling piece of evidence stating that systemic risk measures ought to take into account network effects .",
    "figure [ fig : individual_losses ] shows yet one of the outputs of the framework : the distribution of losses can be obtained for each individual bank .",
    "here , we focus on two large institutions ( by asset size ) : hsbc ( which ranks first by asset size in @xmath1 ) and intesa sanpaolo ( which ranks thirteenth in @xmath1 ) . despite the difference in asset size , the original distance in the levels of var for the first round ( @xmath25 vs @xmath26 ) become much more relevant when second round effects are considered ( @xmath27 vs @xmath28 ) .",
    "the example shows that significant differences in terms of standard risk measures are missed out if we neglect second - round effects .",
    "the exercise carried out in section [ sec : exercise ] shows how the framework can be used to compute a variety of individual and global quantities that are relevant to systemic risk .",
    "the framework allows for a number of additional analyses which are not reported in detail in this paper for the sake of conciseness .",
    "for instance , figure [ fig : network_visualization ] represents one of the outputs of the framework in terms of network _ visualization _ and allows to compare the network position of individual institutions with other information . in this example , the interbank exposures among the top @xmath29 banks by total asset size in @xmath0 ( left ) and @xmath1 ( right ) are considered .",
    "the position of a bank in the chart is determined by its impact : the higher the impact , the more central the bank is located in the circle .",
    "the bubble size is proportional to total asset size of the bank , while the color encodes its vulnerability ( on a scale from blue to red , red nodes are more vulnerable ) .",
    "it is worth mentioning the discussion on the determinants of the _ systemic importance of financial institutions_. in particular , one question is to what extent the asset size of an institution can be a good predictor of the impact of the bank on the system as a whole , and how much we should instead consider the position of the bank in the interbank network .",
    "previous work have found that , although systemically important banks are typically among the large banks , banks with similar size can have very different impact on the system , in case of default @xcite . in line with those results , in our exercise , we find , loosely speaking , that asset size is _ not _ a good predictor of impact ( i.e. the pearson correlation between asset size and individual impact , as measured by debtrank , for the top @xmath30 institutions by total assets , each year is quite low , around @xmath31 ) .    to summarize , this paper presents a stress - test framework focused on the evaluation of network effects in systemic risk .",
    "we have illustrated how to carry out a stress - test exercise on a dataset of 183 european banks over the years @xmath0-@xmath1 .",
    "the code underlying the framework has been developed in matlab and is available upon request to the authors .",
    "the notion of interconnectedness has already entered the debate on `` global systemically important banks '' ( g - sibs , * ? ? ? * ) . however , this notion has been meant so far in an aggregate sense , without fully recognizing that institutions with similar aggregated exposures can have very different levels of systemic impact and/or vulnerability to shocks . indeed , a central notion in our framework is the one of _ leverage networks _ , i.e. the set of leverage relations among banks balance - sheets and among banks and assets .",
    "the effect of these relations is the key starting point to monitor systemic risk from a network perspective .",
    "accordingly , our framework allows to track separately the magnitude of the so - called first , second and third round effects , a feature that is particularly important in the discussion of future stress - tests at national and international level . in this respect , in line with previous work on german interbank data @xcite , we find that the second - round effect is at least as large as the first - round effect .    notice that by adopting traditional analyses based on default - only mechanisms @xcite , we would instead find very limited second round effects .",
    "there are two main reasons for this discrepancy .",
    "first , in a default - only framework the propagation of distress only occurs in the case of outright default .",
    "for example , in order to trigger any second round effect , at least one default in the first round is necessary : this would in turn imply that an initial shock needs to be at least as large as the reciprocal of a bank s leverage ( see appendix [ sec : methods ] ) . in order for the second round to be significant",
    ", there would need to be a large number of defaults in the first round .",
    "indeed , banks are recommended to keep their single largest exposure well below their capital so that a necessary condition for second round losses is the default of at least two of their counterparties .",
    "however , in the practice , banks regularly re - evaluate their mark - to - market exposures to their counterparties in order to take into account the changes in their probability of default ( i.e. credit valuation adjustment ; see * ? ? ?",
    "indeed , debtrank captures the effects of this adjustment in a recursive way .",
    "the second reason for the discrepancy arises from the fact that , in @xcite , while the recovery rate on interbank assets is determined endogenously , the recovery rate on the external assets is assumed to be one .",
    "although this assumption has been relaxed in @xcite , very large shocks at the first round are still necessary to trigger any second round . in contrast , the dynamics of debtrank assumes zero recovery rate on interbank assets , which is a realistic assumption in the short run .",
    "future work will aim at bridging these two paradigmatic approaches .    in the framework",
    ", we further compute a series of systemic risk variables , along with their evolution over time , thus showing the dynamics of systemic risk in the financial system . in this respect , there is an added value in looking at quantities such as impact and vulnerability of financial institutions in combination , since systemic risk emerges when institutions that are systemically important become also vulnerable . while the results illustrated here have been obtained assuming the distress propagation mechanism of debtrank @xcite , other mechanisms can also be used in the framework and compared .",
    "one of the obstacles in estimating network effects is the limitation in the availability of interbank exposures data . in order to address this issue ,",
    "our framework allows to generate sets of interbank networks that satisfy the constraints on the total lending and borrowing of each bank . in this way",
    ", we can gain insights on the possible range of variation on systemic risk , due to differences in key network quantities .",
    "for example , one could tune the density parameter to assess whether this has an impact on the levels of systemic risk ( see appendix [ sec : network_reconstruction ] ) , or use various interbank network formation models ( see , e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "overall , our aim is to enrich the set of existing tools by integrating the estimation of network effects with risk measures that are familiar to regulators and practitioners .",
    "the most used risk measures ( such as value at risk and expected shortfall ) look at the buffer that each individual bank needs to set aside in order to cover the _ direct _ exposures to different types of shocks .",
    "in contrast , the _ indirect _ exposures arising from the interconnected nature of the financial system are typically not considered in such measures . in this respect ,",
    "our framework allows to estimate individual and aggregate banks loss distributions conditional to both direct shocks and indirect shocks on other banks .",
    "in this methodological appendix , we provide the technical details of the process underlying the stress - test framework . in order to bridge between capital requirements and the network structure ,",
    "we build on the common notion of _ leverage _ and define two _ leverage networks _ , which reflect a more granular representation of banks balance sheets .      in the framework",
    ", we consider a financial system composed of @xmath2 institutions ( banks ) .",
    "each institution @xmath32 in the system can invest in either @xmath4 external assets or in the funding of the other @xmath33 financial institutions .",
    "the focus of our analysis is on the dynamics of the balance sheets of each institution ( at each time @xmath34 ) and , in particular , of their equity levels .",
    "the balance sheet is modelled as follows : @xmath35 is the equity value of institution @xmath32 at time @xmath36 , @xmath37 is value of its total assets and @xmath38 its total liabilities . consistently with much of the literature , we assume that assets are marked - to - market whereas liabilities are written at their face value",
    ". we can classify assets and liabilities into _ external _ and _ interbank_. in particular , we consider the @xmath39 interbank lending matrix , whose element @xmath40 is the amount bank @xmath32 lends to bank @xmath41 in the interbank market and the @xmath42 external assets matrix , whose element @xmath43 is the amount invested by bank @xmath32 in the external asset @xmath44 .",
    "the sum @xmath45 is the total amount of interbank assets of bank @xmath32 and the sum @xmath46 is the total amount of external assets of bank @xmath32 . in this framework , we consider external liabilities as exogenous and do not specifically model them : to simplify the notation , these liabilities do not carry a time index .",
    "the balance sheet identity at each time @xmath47 reads : @xmath48 , or , equivalently , @xmath49 .",
    "we define the _ total leverage _ of bank @xmath32 at time @xmath36 as the ratio between its total assets and its equity : @xmath50 , which can disaggregated into its additive subcomponents :    @xmath51    where the element @xmath52 is the leverage of bank @xmath32 towards bank @xmath41 at time @xmath36 and the element @xmath53 is the external leverage of bank @xmath32 with respect to the external asset @xmath44 . by considering these two matrices as weighted adjacency matrices , we can then envision two _ leverage networks _ :",
    "i ) a mono - partite interbank leverage network and ii ) a bipartite external leverage network . by summing along the columns of these matrices , we can obtain the _ total interbank leverage _",
    "@xmath54 ( the interbank leverage _ out - strength _ ) and the _ total external leverage _",
    "@xmath55 ( the external leverage _ out - strength _ ) .",
    "these quantities are the key variables in our framework .",
    "in particular , we will show that interbank and external leverage produce compounded effects when the dynamic of losses for the second round is considered .      as banks deplete capital in order to face losses in both interbank and external assets , in the stress - test framework",
    "we are mainly concerned with the dynamics of the relative loss in equity for each institution , with respect to a baseline level at @xmath47 .",
    "this dynamics is captured by the following process :    @xmath56    which represents the individual cumulative relative equity loss in time .",
    "we assume that either no replenishment of capital or positive cash flow are possible , therefore @xmath57 , @xmath58 . in this way , the relative equity loss is a non - decreasing function of time .",
    "further , @xmath59 $ ] @xmath58 . a bank defaults ( i.e. the bank reaches the maximum distress possible ) if @xmath60 . when @xmath61 the bank is undistressed .",
    "all values of @xmath62 between @xmath63 and @xmath64 imply that the bank is under distress .",
    "similarly , we can compute the global cumulative relative equity loss at each time @xmath36 as the weighted average of each individual level of distress :    @xmath65    where the weights are given by @xmath66 , i.e. the fraction of equity of each bank at the baseline level ( @xmath47 ) . notice that @xmath62 is a pure number and so is @xmath67 .",
    "the monetary value ( e.g. in euros or dollars ) of the loss can be obtained by @xmath68 ( individual loss ) and @xmath69 ( global loss ) .    using the terminology introduced in the main text , equations [ eq : individual_equity_loss ] and [ eq : global_equity_loss ]",
    "allow to measure the _ individual _ and _ global _ vulnerability respectively .",
    "the entire distress process featured in the framework can be outlined in the following steps .",
    "let @xmath70 be the value of one unit of the external asset @xmath44 . at time @xmath71 , a ( negative ) shock @xmath72 on the value of asset @xmath44 reduces the value of the investment in external assets of bank @xmath32 by the amount : @xmath73 .",
    "banks record a loss on their asset side that , provided the hypothesis that assets are mark - to - market and liabilities are at face value , the loss needs to be compensated by a corresponding reduction in equity :    @xmath74    the individual and global relative equity loss at time @xmath71 can be obtained as follows : ] ] @xmath75    which shows how the initial shock on each asset @xmath44 is _ multiplicatively _ amplified by the external leverage on that specific asset .",
    "this leads to a straightforward interpretation of the leverage ratio .",
    "indeed it is immediate to prove that the reciprocal of the leverage ratio corresponds to the minimum shock @xmath76 that leads bank @xmath32 to default ( this applies to all summands @xmath77 e @xmath78 in equation [ eq : summands ] ) .",
    "since the single largest exposure is typically smaller than the equity , it is likely that defaults and large losses originate by different combinations of shocks affecting the different external assets . in the absence of detailed data on the exposure to different classes of external assets , we assume a _ common _ negative shock @xmath79 on the value of all external assets",
    ". this assumption can be interpreted in two alternative ways .",
    "first , we can envision a common small shock to all asset classes , as in times of general market distress .",
    "the second way is that of a large shock to specific asset classes held by all banks ( e.g. sovereign on a class of countries , housing shocks , etc . ) .    we can therefore drop the index @xmath44 in the summation and write : @xmath80 . at this point ,",
    "the initial loss reverberates throughout the interbank network .",
    "the debtrank algorithm @xcite extends the dynamics of default contagion into a more general distress propagation not necessarily entailing a default event .",
    "in other words , shocks on the asset side of the balance sheet of bank @xmath32 transmit along the network even when such shocks are not large enough to trigger the default of @xmath32 .",
    "this is motivated by the fact that , as @xmath32 s equity decreases , so does its _ distance to default _ @xcite and , consistently with the approach of @xcite the bank will be less likely to repay its obligations in case of further distress , therefore implying that the market value of @xmath32 s obligations will decrease as well .",
    "consequently , the distress propagates onto its counterparties along the network .",
    "if we denote the market value of the obligation with @xmath81 , is the element standing on the liability side of @xmath41 ( i.e. the face value established at time @xmath63 ) , whereas @xmath82 is the value ( mark - to - market ) at time @xmath36 written on the asset side of i. ] then above argument implies that the distress @xmath41 propagates onto its lender @xmath32 can be expressed , in general terms , as the relative loss with respect to the original face value @xmath83 . by summing over all obligors ,",
    "the relative equity loss of each bank @xmath32 at time @xmath84 is described by :    @xmath85    where @xmath86 is the set of _ active _ nodes , i.e. nodes that transmit distress at time @xmath36 .",
    "the choice of the set of active nodes at time @xmath36 , @xmath86 , is a peculiarity of debtrank .",
    "in fact , equation [ eq : main_debt_rank ] is of a recursive nature and therefore needs to be computed at each time @xmath36 by considering the nodes that were in distress at the previous time .",
    "since the leverage network can present cycles , the distress may propagate via a particular link more than once .",
    "although this fact does not represent a problem in mathematical terms , its economic interpretation is indeed more problematic . in order to overcome this problem",
    ", debtrank excludes more than one reverberation . from a network perspective , by choosing the set @xmath86 we exclude walks that count a specific link more than once .",
    "the process ends at a certain time @xmath87 , when nodes are no longer active .",
    "[ [ the - functional - form - of - fcdot . ] ] the functional form of @xmath88 . + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the choice of the function @xmath88 deserves further discussion .",
    "in fact , a correct estimation of its form would require an empirical framework which should take into account the probability of default of @xmath41 and the recovery rate of the assets held by @xmath32 .",
    "however , the minimum requirement that @xmath88 needs to satisfy is that of being a non - decreasing relation between @xmath14 and the losses in the value of its obligations .",
    "more specifically , we can hypothesize that small values of @xmath14 may have little to no effect on the market value of @xmath32 s obligations , whereas extremely large losses would settle the value of @xmath32 s obligations almost close to zero : the relationship is therefore necessarily non - linear and @xmath88 is likely to be a sigmoid - type of function .",
    "in view of this , although further work will deal with the analysis of more refined functional forms , we hereby present two main forms , referring to the following two specific dynamics of distress :    default contagion .",
    ": :    in this case , in line with a specific stream of literature , @xcite ,    only the event of default triggers a contagion .",
    "the function    @xmath88 is therefore chosen as the indicator function    over the case of default    @xmath89 .",
    ": :    the characteristics of @xmath88 imply the existence of    an intermediate level where @xmath88 can be approximated    by a linear function . by choosing the identity function    @xmath90",
    ", we obtain to the original debtrank    formulation @xcite .",
    "this functional form will be the one we use the    most in the framework and the exercise .    for the sake of clarity , in the remainder of this section ,",
    "we consider only the latter functional form .",
    "however , in the framework , stress tests can be easily carried out for both cases .",
    "[ [ vulnerability . ] ] vulnerability .",
    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + + +    we are now ready to compute the vulnerability ( both individual and global ) and the _ impact _ ( at the individual level ) .",
    "the individual vulnerability @xmath62 can be easily computed by setting @xmath91 in equation [ eq : main_debt_rank ] .",
    "the global vulnerability is then given by @xmath92 . even though the framework can take as input _ any _ type of shocks ,",
    "we focus briefly on the case in which the external assets of all banks are shocked : in this case all banks transmit distress at time @xmath71 and , given the choice of the set @xmath93 , the process indeed ends at time @xmath94 .",
    "we can hence derive a closed - form solution for the individual vulnerability after the second round : @xmath95 which elucidates the _ compounding _ effect of external and interbank leverage .",
    "if the shock @xmath96 is small enough not to induce any default , then [ eq : first_order_approx ] can be rewritten as : @xmath97    [ [ impact.-1 ] ] impact .",
    "+ + + + + + +    debtrank , in its original formulation @xcite , entails a stress test by assuming the default of each bank individually and computing the global relative equity loss _ induced _ by such default .",
    "this is indeed what we define as the _ impact _ of an institution onto the system as a whole .",
    "formally , this can be written as : @xmath98    [ [ network - effects - a - first - order - approximation - of - vulnerability ] ] network effects : a first order approximation of vulnerability + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    equation [ eq : main_debt_rank ] clearly shows the main feature of the distress dynamics captured by debtrank : the interplay between the network of leverage and the distress imported from neighbors in this network .",
    "further , equation [ eq : first_order_approx ] clarifies the multiplicative role of leverage in determining the distress at the end of the second round .",
    "we now develop a first - order approximation of equation [ eq : first_order_approx ] , which will serve the purpose of further clarifying the _ compounding _ effects of external and interbank leverage in determining distress .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , we assume no default , which allows us to remove the `` @xmath99 '' operator .",
    "this is a reasonable assumption in case of a relatively small shock on external assets .",
    "we approximate the external leverage of the obligors of bank @xmath32 by taking the weighted average ( with weights @xmath100 ) of their external leverages , which we denote by @xmath101 . as @xmath102",
    ", we write @xmath103 . by denoting with @xmath104 the weighted average of @xmath105",
    ", we can approximate the global equity loss at the end of the second round @xmath106 as : @xmath107 which allows to see how the second - round effects alone can be obtained as the product of the weighted average interbank leverage and weighted average external leverage .",
    "typically , stress tests emphasize the effects of the first - round : as we observe , this may potentially bring to a severe underestimation of systemic risk .",
    "after the second round , banks have experienced a certain level of equity loss that has completely reshaped the initial configuration of the balance sheets at time @xmath47 .",
    "banks are now attempting to restore , at least partially , this initial configuration .",
    "in particular , we assume @xcite that each bank @xmath32 will try to move to the original leverage level @xmath108 .",
    "this implies that banks will try to sell external assets in order to obtain enough cash to repay their obligations and therefore reduce the size of their balance sheet .",
    "because of the vast quantity of external assets sold by the banking system in aggregate , the impact on the prices of external assets is also relevant , which will reduce accordingly .",
    "banks therefore will experience further losses due to fire sales and we label such losses as _ third round _ effects . here , we provide a minimal model for the scenario described above .",
    "consider the leverage dynamics at @xmath109 .",
    "the leverage at @xmath36 is    @xmath110    we assume that , at @xmath47 , each bank had a quantity of external assets @xmath111 and , without loss of generality , that the initial price of the asset is unitary ( @xmath112 ) . hence , the asset values at @xmath47 can be written as @xmath113 .",
    "the asset price after the first round is therefore simply @xmath114 .",
    "recalling that the first round affects only the external asset and that the second round affects only interbank assets , the leverage of each bank @xmath32 immediately after the second round can be written as : @xmath115    where , for ease of notation @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "first , we need to prove that the new leverage levels are higher with respect to the initial conditions .",
    "it is easy to prove that @xmath118 ( as long as @xmath32 has not defaulted ) : @xmath119 where @xmath120 .",
    "the above inequality leads to the condition @xmath121 , which is always verified in our setting .    at @xmath122 , banks attempt to restore the target leverage @xmath123 , by selling a fraction @xmath124 $ ] of their external assets at the price @xmath125 and replenish their equity of an amount @xmath126 .",
    "therefore , we modify equation [ eq : newleveragelevels ] as follows :    @xmath127    after some passages , we obtain the value for @xmath128 :    @xmath129    which satisfies equation [ eq : newnewleverage ] .",
    "the relative amount of assets sold is given by @xmath130 .",
    "we further assume that the simultaneous selling of external assets in the market produces a further linear impact on the price .",
    "given the impact of fire sales , the new price is further reduced as follows :    @xmath131    and the relative change in price is therefore proportional to the relative change in quantity of sold assets through a constant @xmath132 $ ] .",
    "finally , by computing the additional loss given by the decline in price following equation [ eq : pricedecline ] , we obtain the final individual relative equity loss at @xmath133 :    @xmath134    and the global equity loss at the third round ( assuming no defaults ) :    @xmath135      the distress process allows to capture , at each time @xmath36 , the relative equity loss for both the individual institution and the system as a whole .",
    "this implies the possibility to compute , at each time @xmath36 , a ( continuous ) _ relative equity loss distribution _",
    "conditional to a certain shock .",

    "consistently with a recent stream of literature @xcite , for each bank we take as fitness @xmath149 the average between its total lending and borrowing propensity , implying that , the greater this value , the higher will be the number of counterparties ( the _ degree _ of a node ) . considering empirical evidence on the density of different interbank networks @xcite , we assume on average a density of @xmath153 ( i.e. about @xmath154 over the @xmath155 possible links ) . does not influence the overall results of the exercise .",
