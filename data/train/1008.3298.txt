    "one of the most important discoveries of relativistic heavy ion collider experiments is that relativistic ideal hydrodynamic models quantitatively describe the collective behavior of the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) created in the collisions @xcite .",
    "the success is a great motivation to take non - equilibrium processes into account to explain small discrepancies between theoretical predictions and experimental data .",
    "large hadron collider experiments also expect heavy ion collisions of higher energies , and viscous hydrodynamic models would become more important as one might observe _ less _ strongly - coupled qgp because of asymptotic freedom in qcd .",
    "the ambiguities of viscous hydrodynamic models lie in the formalism of relativistic dissipative hydrodynamics itself .",
    "if one considers only the first order dissipative correction to the entropy current , theories are known to become acausal and unstable @xcite .",
    "thus varieties of theories with the second order correction have been proposed . however , the resulting constitutive equations for the dissipative currents differ among theories . also , most viscous hydrodynamic models are based on the theories for single component systems with binary collisions . considering that the qgp is a multi - component system with particle creation and annihilation ,",
    "it is important that one establishes a multi - component formalism which takes account of inelastic scatterings .",
    "this naturally motivates us to consider multiple conserved currents because one needs to solve continuity equations for conserved charges , rather than the ones for particle numbers .",
    "we would like to formulate relativistic dissipative hydrodynamics for multi - component and multi - conserved current systems @xcite .",
    "relativistic hydrodynamics is a general theoretical framework which describes collective motion of strongly - coupled systems with the energy - momentum conservation @xmath0 , the charge conservations @xmath1 and the law of increasing entropy @xmath2 . here",
    "the index @xmath3 denotes different types of conserved quantum number .",
    "typically , one can consider the baryon number @xmath4 or the strangeness @xmath5 for such quantities in relativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "we introduce tensor decompositions of the energy - momentum tensor @xmath6 and the conserved currents @xmath7 in terms of the flow field @xmath8 to define thermodynamic quantities @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the projection operator .",
    "there are @xmath11 equilibrium quantities : energy density @xmath12 , hydrostatic pressure @xmath13 and type-@xmath3 charge density @xmath14 . on the other hand",
    ", one has @xmath15 dissipative currents : bulk pressure @xmath16 , energy density distortion @xmath17 , energy current @xmath18 , shear stress tensor @xmath19 , type-@xmath3 charge density distortion @xmath20 and type-@xmath3 charge current @xmath21 .",
    "although thermodynamic stability conditions @xcite require @xmath17 and @xmath20 to be zero , we have to keep them for the moment to correctly count the number of the dissipative currents . in ideal hydrodynamics , the conservation laws and the equation of state",
    "@xmath22 give sufficient number of equations to describe systems because the number of unknowns is @xmath23 in such systems .",
    "in dissipative hydrodynamics , one needs _ constitutive equations _ because there are the @xmath15 additional unknowns @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath21 .",
    "we would like to derive them from the law of increasing entropy , because it embodies irreversible processes .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor and the conserved currents are expressed in relativistic kinetic theory with the phase space distribution @xmath26 as @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are degeneracy and type-@xmath3 quantum number of @xmath30-th particle species , respectively .",
    "we introduce the higher moment equations for the energy - momentum conservation and for the charge conservations @xmath31 to derive second order constitutive equations . @xmath32 and @xmath33 are to be determined from the law of increasing entropy .",
    "the conventional israel - stewart theory @xcite has only eq .",
    "( [ eq : ene_consv_high ] ) because single component systems with binary collisions are considered .",
    "however , one has to introduce the new sets of equations ( [ eq : chg_consv_high ] ) to consistently match the numbers of equations with that of dissipative currents in multi - component and/or multiple conserved current systems .",
    "the entropy production can be written in kinetic theory as @xmath34 = \\sum _ i \\int \\frac{g_i d^3 p_i}{(2\\pi ) ^3 e_i } p_i^\\mu y^i",
    "\\partial_\\mu f^i , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 is defined in @xmath36^{-1}$ ] .",
    "the sign factor @xmath37 is @xmath38 for fermions and @xmath39 for bosons .",
    "we estimate the distortion of distribution @xmath40 in terms of dissipative currents by generalizing the grad s moment method @xcite for the systems with multiple conserved currents .",
    "if we require that the resulting constitutive equations satisfy onsager reciprocal relations @xcite , the only possible moment expansion would be @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are self - consistently determined so that the distribution reproduces the energy - momentum tensor and the conserved currents ( [ eq : emcc ] ) .",
    "then the @xmath44 s are expressed as linear combinations of the dissipative currents .",
    "on the other hand , the entropy production ( [ eq : ent_pro ] ) is expressed in terms of @xmath44 s and @xmath45 s as @xmath46 the law of increasing entropy requires that @xmath45 s are linear combinations of @xmath44 s .",
    "then the second order constitutive equations for multi - component systems with multiple conserved currents are obtained by writing the moment equations ( [ eq : ene_consv_high ] ) and ( [ eq : chg_consv_high ] ) with the dissipative current : @xmath47 here @xmath48 and @xmath49 are time- and space - like derivatives .",
    "the angle brackets denote the operation @xmath50 a^{\\alpha } b^{\\beta}$ ] .",
    "@xmath51 s , @xmath52 s and @xmath53 are first order transport coefficients ; @xmath51 is bulk viscosity , @xmath54 energy conductivity , @xmath55 charge conductivity and @xmath53 shear viscosity .",
    "@xmath56 s are relaxation times , and @xmath57 s are second order transport coefficients",
    ". the ratios of the first and the second order coefficients can be determined in kinetic theory .",
    "we have derived constitutive equations for multi - component systems with multiple conserved currents in arbitrary frame .",
    "we would like to emphasize four points .",
    "firstly , the equations have onsager cross terms , although most of the conventional formalisms do not consider them carefully .",
    "these terms contain important physics such as soret and dufour effects , which are chemical diffusion caused by thermal gradient and its counter - effect respectively .",
    "the reciprocal relations are satisfied . secondly , there are relaxation terms  terms with time - like derivatives of the dissipative currents themselves  in the constitutive equations .",
    "these terms play important roles in preserving causality because they cause exponential damping of the dissipative currents .",
    "thirdly , we have independent equations for energy and charge currents .",
    "this means that our formalism can describe systems in an arbitrary frame unlike the conventional formalisms in which one has to choose either energy or particle frames .",
    "fourthly , we have several second order terms which do not appear in ref .  @xcite . for further detailed discussion including comparison with other approaches",
    "@xcite , see ref .",
