    "the study of the nuclear regions in radio galaxies with very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) has proved to be a very important tool for the understanding of the properties of the central engine in low and high power radio galaxies .",
    "furthermore it has provided a major contribution in testing the unified schemes which attribute the main differences between the various classes of agns to relativistic beaming and orientation effects .",
    "vlbi observations of complete samples of radio galaxies , together with detailed observations on individual objects ( see for example feretti et al . 1993 ; venturi et al . 1993 and 1995 ; giovannini et al . 1994 , 1998 , 1999 ; lara et al . 1997 and 1999 ; jones & wehrle 1997 ; krichbaum et al . 1998",
    "; taylor 1996 ) , show that lobe - dominated , edge - darkened low power fri radio galaxies and the lobe - dominated , edge - brightened high power friis ( fanaroff & riley 1974 ) are almost indistinguishable on the parsec scale .",
    "both classes of radio galaxies are typically characterised by one - sided parsec - scale morphology .",
    "a few cases of symmetric two - sided morphologies are found both among fris , i.e. hydra a ( taylor 1996 ) and 3c338 ( giovannini et al .",
    "1998 ) , and among friis , for example 3c452 ( venturi et al . 2000 , giovannini et al .",
    ", in preparation ) . from these studies , relativistic bulk motion of the radio emitting plasma in the radio jets , with lorentz factors ranging from a few units up to 10 - 15 were derived .    for both classes of objects",
    "it is estimated that the radio emission is oriented at intermediate to large angles to the line of sight .",
    "this is in agreement with predictions from the standard unified models where frii radio galaxies represent the misaligned population of flat spectrum quasars ( barthel 1989 ) , while fris are the misaligned population of bl - lac objects ( urry & padovani 1995 ) . for the latter unification ,",
    "there remain some issues to be clarified .",
    "for example , on the basis of statistical arguments and optical data , chiaberge et al .",
    "( 1999 , 2000 ) and capetti & celotti ( 1999 ) concluded that the lorentz factors needed for fris and bl - lacs , in order to account for the different orientation dependent properties , are in the range @xmath4 .",
    "these values are lower than derived by independent arguments , such as the modelling of the spectral energy distribution in bl - lacs ( ghisellini et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "chiaberge et al . ( 2000 ) proposed that a two - phase jet in fris could account for the apparent discrepancy in the standard unification model .",
    "furthermore they underlined the importance of multifrequency studies of the nuclear regions of radio galaxies and their parent aligned population , in order to overcome the remaining discrepancies between theoretical predictions and observations , and to probe the inner parsec - scale regions in agn .",
    "in addition , radiative inefficient accretion models , such as the advection dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) , have been recently suggested to explain the spectral properties of some radio galaxies . in particular , they have been applied to galaxies with high hard x - ray excess and moderate radio luminosity ( see e.g. di matteo et al .",
    "1999 ) but no sign of agn activity from the optical lines .",
    "milliarcsec resolution radio observations provide parsec - scale imaging of the innermost regions in radio galaxies , and allow derivation of the radio spectrum of the nuclear component , both crucial pieces of information to test and constrain the adaf accretion process .    given the importance of multi - wavelength information , as emphasized above , we have started a program to provide vlbi information for some of the radio sources in the 2-jy sample .",
    "for the sources in this sample a wealth of radio , optical , x - ray data are already available .",
    "in this paper we present vlbi radio observations of the nuclear region in six radio galaxies selected from this sample not yet imaged at parsec - scale resolution , and discuss them in the light of their large scale radio properties , optical and x  ray features . in section 2",
    "we illustrate the selection criteria and give an overview of the selected sources ; the observations and data reduction are described in section 3 ; individual sources are discussed in section 4 .",
    "discussion and conclusions are given in section 5 .",
    "radio sources belonging to the 2-jy catalogue of radio sources ( wall & peacock 1985 ) are potentially a very useful tool for the understanding of the nuclear properties of radio galaxies .",
    "the 2-jy sample is well studied in a wide range of wavelengths , from radio ( morganti et al .",
    "1993 , 1999 and references therein ) , to optical spectroscopy ( tadhunter et al . 1993 , 1998 and references therein ) , up to x  ray energies ( siebert et al . 1996 , trussoni et al . 1999 , padovani et al .",
    "recently , 23 galaxies in the sample have also been searched for hi absorption ( morganti et al .",
    "2000 , submitted ) .",
    "this allows comparative studies , which are crucial to understand the physics of the inner parsec - scale region of agn , and to test unified models and evolutionary scenarios .",
    "the 2-jy sample includes radio sources with flux density s@xmath5 2 jy , redshift z @xmath6 0.7 and declination @xmath7 .",
    "given the frequency of observation , the sample is biassed towards beamed radio sources .    among the 2-jy sample we have selected all sources with s@xmath8 ( 5 ghz ) @xmath9 200 mjy not yet imaged at vlbi resolution .",
    "the core flux density limit was chosen so as to be able to image the southernmost radio galaxies with the sensitivity of the southern long baseline array ( lba ) at the time the original proposals were made . in this paper",
    "we present the results of parsec - scale observations for six radio galaxies from the selected sample .",
    "the list of objects is given in table 1 , where the most relevant parameters , i.e. redshift z , core power logp@xmath10 at 5 ghz ( data taken from morganti et al .",
    "1993 ) and total power logp@xmath11 at 408 mhz are also reported .    among them",
    "we have four classical fris , one core - halo source and one intermediate type fri / frii .",
    "the power range of 3c17 is typical of friis , however its arcsecond scale morphology is more similar to the transition objects between fris and friis than to the typical classical doubles ( morganti et al .",
    "1993 ; morganti et al .",
    "it is the most distant object among the sources in the present sample .",
    "the total power for the five remaining galaxies is that of the most powerful fris , and their large scale radio emission is typical of fri except for 3c317 , which is classified as core - halo .       even though the core dominance leads to more stringent limits for @xmath12 and @xmath13 , the values we derived with these two methods are in reasonable agreement with each other , except for 3c317 , which we will discuss in further detail below .",
    "3c17 shows the highest degree of asymmetry among our sources , consistent with the fact that it is a broad line radio galaxy , hence expected to be oriented at small to moderate angles to the line of sight .",
    "pks 0625@xmath035 and pks 1318@xmath043 are both one - sided on the parsec - scale , but their degree of asymmetry is less severe than for 3c17 and leads to upper limits to the viewing angle fully consistent with the expectations from unification",
    ". in particular , for pks 0625@xmath035 the upper limit derived for @xmath14 with both methods is in very good agreement with the independent estimate done by trussoni et al .",
    "( 1999 ) . for this source",
    ", the upper limit found , coupled with the indication of a hard x  ray unobscured nuclear component , argues in favour of the fact that nuclear obscuration from a torus is probably not relevant in this object .",
    "interestingly enough , for pks1333@xmath033 the core power at 5 ghz derived on the basis of the logp@xmath10 - logp@xmath15 correlation is in perfect agreement with the measured value ( see table 1 ) , thus suggesting that the source is viewed at an angle @xmath16 .",
    "the case of 3c317 is more complex . even though we can not rule out the possibility that 3c317 is an edge - on radio galaxy with intrinsic bends on the parsec scale amplified by a small viewing angle ( see table 5 ) , an alternative explanation for the properties of 3c317",
    "should also be taken into account .",
    "we suggest that the observed bent morphology is the result of the interaction between the relativistic plasma and a very dense external medium . under this second hypothesis ,",
    "the parsec - scale jets are disrupted in the sub - arcsecond region , as consequence of gas accretion in the optical counterpart ugc 9799 from the cluster cooling flow , thus preventing the source from evolving into a classical fri radio galaxy .",
    "the merlin - only images in figure [ fig:3c317_18mer ] and [ fig:3c317_6mer ] at 1.66 ghz and at 4.99 ghz respectively show no hint of jets or extended emission at the resolution of the order of 50 mas ( @xmath17 50 pc ) at 5 ghz or 150 mas at 1.7 ghz , and this suggests that jet disruption may take place at most at such distance from the core .",
    "zhao et al .",
    "( 1993 ) gave estimated the sonic radius @xmath18 for 3c317 , i.e. the region where radio jets may become unstable and disrupt as a consequence of the cooling flow at the centre of the galaxy , and gave a value @xmath190.4 kpc .",
    "our parsec - scale images of 3c317 first of all confirm that the radio plasma is indeed collimated at least out to a distance of @xmath17 20 pc from the core , moreover they place a new upper limit to the sonic radius @xmath20 50 pc .    as shown in the previous section , comparison between the nuclear spectrum and the large scale spectrum of 3c317",
    "suggests that a very active nucleus is embedded in a steep spectrum radio halo . if we make the simplified assumption that the parsec - scale emission in the source is in equipartition and if we make the standard equipartition assumptions , i.e. cylindrical geometry , filling factor @xmath21 = 1 , ratio of protons to electrons energy k=1 , and integrate in the range of frequencies @xmath22 hz , we obtain an estimate for the average parsec - scale magnetic field of the vlbi image b@xmath23 g. from the core spectrum reported in figure [ fig:3c317_spix ] we estimated a break frequency @xmath24 ghz , and with the derived value for b@xmath25 we obtain a radiative age @xmath26 2000 yrs . these numbers confirm that the nuclear region in 3c317 is active , furthermore they suggest that the radiating electrons are very young .    to summarise , the six radio galaxies presented in this paper exhibit parsec - scale properties in agreement with the unified models for radio loud galaxies , i.e. they are characterised by at least mildly relativistic speeds and are viewed at intermediate to large angles to the line of sight .      our detailed study on 3c317 shows that the source is characterised by parsec - scale collimated jets , which disrupt on the sub - kiloparsec region , possibly as consequence of the cooling flow at the centre of the galaxy .",
    "our spectral analysis of the source core region suggests that the source is very young .",
