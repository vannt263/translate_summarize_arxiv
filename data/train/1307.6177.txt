    "the question of the evolution and maintenance of altruism or , as wilson @xcite put it bluntly `` the surrender of personal genetic fitness for the enhancement of personal genetic fitness in others '' , has been subject of stern dispute since the 1960s ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the central point of this debate is the potential of intergroup selection , whose underlying mechanism is the differential population ( group ) extinction , to counteract individual selection .",
    "of particular historical relevance to this matter was wynne - edwards suggestion that in order to control population growth animals would limit their own fertility for the sake of group survival @xcite .",
    "in fact , if the extinction of groups occurs at a rate depending on their composition , then such extinctions will , in principle , favor the existence of individuals that increase the probability of survival of the group they belong to .",
    "the difficulty is that the group extinction rates should have a magnitude comparable to that of individual selection , a condition that , seemingly , lacks empirical support @xcite .",
    "the issue boils down then to the identification of the range of the parameters associated to the relevant evolutionary processes  differential reproduction rate of individuals , differential extinction rate of groups , migration and group size ( genetic drift )  necessary to maintain an altruistic trait in the population .",
    "such a trait is defined as one that is detrimental to the fitness of the individual who expresses it , but that confers an advantage to the group of which that individual is a member .",
    "hence the mathematical analyses of the large variety of group selection models for the evolution of altruism presented in the literature have provided the basic information one needs to access the relevance of intergroup selection as an evolutionary force in nature @xcite . moreover ,",
    "the challenging mathematical models used to describe the resulting two - level selection problem are viewed as an attraction on their own and have kept a recurrent theoretical interest on this controversial theory @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we offer exact numerical and approximate analytical solutions to perhaps the most elegant mathematical formulation of the intergroup selection problem proposed yet , namely , kimura s diffusion model of intergroup selection @xcite .",
    "the key quantity at the group selection level is the group survival function @xmath0 which essentially determines the rate at which a group containing a fraction @xmath1 of altruists survives extinction .",
    "whereas kimura has considered the case that @xmath0 increases linearly with the frequency @xmath1 of altruists within the group , i.e. , @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is a positive constant ( see also @xcite ) , here we explore the effects of an additional quadratic term , i.e. , @xmath4 , where @xmath5 , whose effect is to engender convexity to the survival function .",
    "the biological interpretation of the convexity of the survival function is similar to that of epistatic interactions between mutations or genes in genetics @xcite . in particular , in the linear case ( @xmath6 ) ,",
    "the beneficial effects that the altruists accrue to the group are purely additive , i.e. , they do not interact with each other . in the case of concave functions ( @xmath7 )",
    ", we have a situation akin to positive or synergistic epistasis in which the group benefit is greater than the additive effects of the single altruists , whereas in the case of convex functions ( @xmath8 ) the presence of the altruists together have a smaller effect than expected from their effects alone , a situation known in genetics as negative or antagonistic epistasis .",
    "hence the linear case studied by kimura occurs when the individuals do not interact with each other in the group , which is a somewhat unrealistic assumption since individuals within the same group should exhibit some sort of interaction .    in the case",
    "the group survival function is concave ( @xmath9 ) we find an ergodic coexistence phase in addition to the altruistic and non - altruistic phases , whereas in the case of a convex survival function ( @xmath10 ) the coexistence phase is eliminated altogether but a bistable regime sets in for sufficiently large values of @xmath11 .",
    "overall we conclude that a non - decreasing concave group survival function of the frequency of altruist can increase significantly the region in the parameter space where the altruistic trait can be maintained , albeit in combination with the non - altruistic one .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : model ] we describe the evolutionary events that comprise the life cycles of the individuals and groups , and derive the partial differential equation that governs the time evolution of the proportion of groups @xmath12 carrying a fraction @xmath1 of altruists at time @xmath13 . in section [ sec : linear ] we re - examine the problem studied by kimura , @xmath2 , and offer rigorous arguments to locate the transition line between the altruistic and non - altruistic phases as well as to characterize the non - ergodic coexistence regime at the transition line . in section [ sec : quad ]",
    "we consider the effect of adding the quadratic term @xmath14 to the linear term considered by kimura .",
    "the resulting phase - diagram is studied in detail for the concave case ( @xmath9 ) and the continuous transition lines separating the ergodic coexistence phase from the altruistic and non - altruistic phases are determined numerically and analytically .",
    "our arguments to prove the existence of a bistable regime in the case @xmath8 are presented in the appendix . in section [ sec : heav ] we describe succinctly the results for a heaviside survival function and show that the continuous transition between the non - altruistic and coexistence phases observed in the case of a concave survival function becomes discontinuous for the heaviside function .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : conc ] we summarize our main results and present some concluding remarks .",
    "we consider a meta - population composed of an infinite number of competing groups .",
    "each group encompasses exactly @xmath15 haploid , asexually reproducing individuals .",
    "there are two alleles at a single locus that determine whether an individual is altruist ( allele @xmath16 ) or not ( allele @xmath17 ) .",
    "the fitness of the individuals are fixed solely by this trait - altruists are assigned fitness 1 and non - altruists fitness @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is a parameter on the order of @xmath20 .",
    "we assume that @xmath15 is sufficiently large so that the frequency of altruists within a group , denoted by @xmath1 , can be viewed as a continuous variable in the closed interval @xmath21 $ ] .",
    "the meta - population is described by the proportion of groups @xmath22 whose frequency of altruists lies in the range @xmath23 at time @xmath13 .",
    "our goal is to determine how the probability density @xmath24 is affected by the three evolutionary processes : the individual competition within a group , the migration of individuals between groups and the competition between groups . in the following we discuss these processes in detail .      if we assume that a group contains @xmath25 altruists ( hence @xmath26 non - altruists ) , then the probability that there will be exactly @xmath27 altruists after reproduction is given by the wright - fisher process @xcite @xmath28 where @xmath29 $ ] is the relative fitness of the subpopulation of altruists in the group .",
    "the way this process affects the probability density @xmath30 is derived using the diffusion approximation of population genetics , which consists essentially on the calculation of the jump moments @xmath31 and @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the frequencies of altruists before and after reproduction , respectively . here @xmath35 stands for an average using the transition probability @xmath36 .",
    "these moments contribute to the drift and the diffusion terms of a fokker - planck - like equation for @xmath24 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eqphi ] ) ) .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for a detailed discussion of the diffusion approximation .",
    "more pointedly , direct evaluation of the jump moments using the transition probability ( [ rij ] ) yields @xmath37 and @xmath38 where we have kept only terms of the first order in @xmath20 ( recall that the fitness advantage @xmath39 of the non - altruists is on the order of @xmath20 ) .      following wright s island model",
    "we assume that @xmath40 individuals of each group are replaced by migrants in the time interval @xmath41 and that the frequency of altruists among the migrants is equal to the average frequency of altruists in the entire meta - population , i.e. , @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "the probability that a group with @xmath25 altruists ( @xmath33 ) becomes a group with @xmath27 altruists ( @xmath43 ) due to the migration process is then @xcite @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "this somewhat formidable expression has a simple interpretation : the hyper - geometric component yields the probability that exactly @xmath47 altruists and @xmath48 non - altruists are eliminated from the group to make room for the @xmath40 migrants , whereas the binomial part yields the probability that there are exactly @xmath49 altruists among the @xmath40 migrants .",
    "note that after migration the number of altruists in the group is given by the sum of the altruist originally in the group @xmath50 and the number of altruists among the migrants @xmath51 .",
    "the first two jump moments are given by @xmath52 and @xmath53 where @xmath54 stands for an average using the transition probability @xmath55 and @xmath56 is the fraction of the local population that is replaced by migrants . assuming that @xmath57 is on the order of @xmath20 , i.e. , that the number of migrants @xmath40 remains finite and limited when @xmath15 grows large , we can neglect the second jump moment which is @xmath58 .",
    "in addition , the first jump moment becomes of the same order of the drift contribution due to the selective advantage of the non - altruists , eq .",
    "( [ d1r ] ) .",
    "since @xmath1 represents the fraction of altruists in a group , we define the group survival rate @xmath0 as a monotone non - decreasing function of @xmath1 . assuming that a proportion @xmath59 \\delta t$ ] of the groups carrying the fraction @xmath1 of altruists survives extinction during time interval @xmath41 we can write @xmath60 \\delta t \\right ] \\phi \\left ( x , t \\right )   \\zeta\\ ] ] where @xmath61 is some arbitrary rate . here",
    "@xmath62 is such that @xmath63 , i.e , @xmath64 $ ] with @xmath65 the enforcement of the normalization of @xmath24 after the extinction process is akin to assume that the extinct groups are recolonized or replaced by the surviving ones in proportion to their frequencies .",

    "clearly , @xmath70 is non - decreasing in the interval @xmath71 $ ] provided that @xmath72 , in which case the model can be said to describe the competition between individual selection favoring non - altruistic individuals ( @xmath73 ) and intergroup selection favoring altruistic individuals .",
    "in addition , @xmath74 and @xmath75 regardless of the value of @xmath76 .",
    "we note that the sole role of @xmath76 in eq .",
    "( [ cx ] ) is to generate convexity .",
    "the case @xmath6 was studied by kimura in the context of the evolution of an altruistic character @xcite , whereas we have recently considered the case @xmath77 ( and @xmath78 as well ) in a prebiotic evolution scenario for the coexistence of self - replicating molecules @xcite .",
    "the motivation behind prescription ( [ cx ] ) is to understand the effect of a weak nonlinearity , modeled here by the quadratic term @xmath79 , on the linear case studied by kimura .",
    "in addition , in section [ sec : heav ] we will consider briefly the effect of a strong nonlinearity where @xmath70 is given by a heaviside function .",

    "we note that in the deterministic limit @xmath86 the diffusion term of eq .",

    ", there are three potential phases at the steady state : a non - altruistic phase @xmath105 , an altruistic phase @xmath106 , and a coexistence phase @xmath99 where the two individual types cohabit a same group .    however , the linear combination ( [ com ] ) with two or three non - vanishing coefficients is a solution of eq .",
    "( [ eqeq ] ) in the case of isolated groups , @xmath107 @xcite .",
    "this situation is useful to elucidate the nature of the averages involved in the derivation of eq .",
    "( [ eqeq ] ) .",
    "in fact , because the number of groups is infinite , stochasticity occurs only in the processes that take place inside the groups .",
    "for example , in the absence of group selection ( i.e. , @xmath108 for @xmath109 $ ] ) , each group represents an independent realization of the wright - fisher process and since in this case the intragroup dynamics leads to the fixation of one of the individuals types in the group we can interpret @xmath103 in eq .",

    "hence the metapopulation , which is composed of @xmath103 purely egoistic and @xmath104 purely altruistic groups , is the ensemble of the realizations of the wright - fisher process .",
    "a similar interpretation holds in the presence of group selection @xmath110 , except that the groups are no longer independent in this case which results in a biased ensemble of the intragroup stochastic process .",

    "this is the case considered in the seminal paper of kimura @xcite and corresponds to the choice @xmath118 in eq .",
    "( [ cx ] ) so that @xmath119 with @xmath120 .",
    "a simplifying feature of the linear case is that the dynamical variable ( [ def_ct ] ) becomes @xmath121 and so eq .   ( [ eqphi ] ) exhibits only one non - local dynamical variable , namely , @xmath122 .",
    "here we offer a much simpler approach than that presented by kimura , which does not involve the numerical solution of the steady - state equation .",
    "kimura s approach was based on the presence of a small mutation rate between the alleles @xmath16 and @xmath17 which guarantees the existence of a regular solution for all values of the model parameters .",

    "here we consider the complete prescription ( [ cx ] ) for group survival , which is written in terms of the rescaled parameters as @xmath162 with @xmath163 . since for @xmath164",
