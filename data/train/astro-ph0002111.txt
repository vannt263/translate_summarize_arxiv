    "an understanding of the ultraviolet ( uv ) properties of local galaxies is essential for interpreting images of high  redshift systems and especially critical in searches for morphological evolution in the galaxy population . at redshifts of @xmath4 , the rest ",
    "frame uv light of galaxies is shifted into the optical ( 1500@xmath5 observed in @xmath6band at @xmath7 ) and near  infrared ( 1500@xmath5 observed in @xmath8band at @xmath9 ) regions of the spectrum that are easily observable from the ground .",
    "although one operational approach to overcoming this `` band  shifting '' problem is to observe in the infrared ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) , the rate of data acquisition for galaxy images is generally highest at optical wavelengths where detectors are larger and the sky background is lower than in the infrared . under these circumstances , the most direct method to compare present  day galaxies to those in the early universe is to build a large sample of local uv galaxy data .",
    "recent deep surveys suggest that galaxies with peculiar morphology are more prevalent at high redshift ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , it is difficult to quantify the influence of band  shifting on observed differences between the optical characteristics of nearby galaxies and the rest ",
    "frame uv appearance of distant ones because uv and optical morphology are not often well  coupled ( @xcite ; marcum et al .",
    "1997 , 2000 ) .",
    "restframe uv images of galaxies often suggest a later hubble type than the corresponding optical appearance : bulges are less prominent , galaxy light appears more patchy , and in extreme cases the different star ",
    "forming regions in a single galaxy may appear as separate systems in the uv ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "on the other hand , recent deep nicmos imaging of distant galaxies at longer rest wavelengths suggests that some of the morphological peculiarities are still visible in the optical and thus are intrinsic in the galaxies structure ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "although methods exist to estimate uv morphology by extrapolation from optical data ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , they rely on the use of global galaxy spectral energy distributions that may not accurately represent localized conditions , especially in dusty or starbursting regions .",
    "for example , donas , milliard , & laget ( 1995 ) find a variation among uv@xmath10 colors in galaxies with identical @xmath11 .",
    "the availability of fuv images for bright , well  resolved galaxies of a range of hubble types would facilitate a more direct comparison between local and distant galaxy populations .",
    "the appearance of galaxies in the uv is determined primarily by emission from hot stars and by the distribution of dust , with a contribution in the central regions from an agn if one is present and unobscured .",
    "light in the @xmath121500@xmath5 far  ultraviolet ( fuv ) band of the ultraviolet imaging telescope ( uit , @xcite ) originates in young objects of spectral types o and b ( fanelli et al . 1997 ) and , if old populations are present , in certain types of low  mass stars in late stages of evolution ( the `` uvx '' population , see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "thus this region of the spectrum can probe timescales of young stellar populations between that studied via @xmath13 emission ( only o stars , @xmath12 5 myr ) and that evident in the optical colors ( which trace the age of a stellar population on timescales of a few gyr ; oconnell 1997b ) .",
    "opacity due to dust in the fuv is a factor of @xmath122.5 higher than in the optical @xmath6 band , assuming a galactic extinction law ( @xcite ) , and even larger for small magellanic cloud  type dust ( @xcite ) .",
    "the young , massive stars that provide the bulk of the uv emission also tend to have small scale heights , less than or similar to that of the dust , while older stars that dominate at optical wavelengths and have scale heights greater than that of the dust layer ( @xcite ) .",
    "the degree to which dust extinguishes the uv light of highly inclined disk galaxies is unclear .",
    "it likely depends strongly on the relative geometry of star  forming regions and dust concentrations , a phenomenon recently noted in optical / nir studies of nearby galaxies as well as in theoretical studies of systems with a mixture of stars and dust ( @xcite ; gordon et al .",
    "1997 ; @xcite ) .",
    "for instance , ngc 4631 is quite bright in the fuv and blue in fuv ",
    "optical colors , and it does not show evidence for strong attenuation ( smith et al .",
    "1997 , 2000 ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , ngc 891 is only barely detected ( marcum et al 1997 , 2000 ) , a phenomenon that smith et al .",
    "suggest is due to extinction effects .",
    "uv morphology may also be dramatically influenced by specific features such as dust lanes , as noted in cen  a by oconnell ( 1997a ) .",
    "scattering by dust grains is quite efficient in the fuv ( @xcite ) and may contribute significantly to the emission near h ii regions and in spiral arms ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "prior to the space shuttle  borne uit _",
    "missions , uv imaging of galaxies was limited to low resolution and/or small fields of view ( see @xcite for a detailed review ) . uit  prototype rocket  borne experiments in the 1980 s provided images of five nearby galaxies with a resolution of @xmath1215@xmath14 and ten more with a resolution of 100@xmath14 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . the foca balloon experiment yielded images of similar resolution for six nearby galaxies ( @xcite ) . recently , higher resolution uv images of 110 galaxy nuclei ( @xcite ) and nine starburst galaxies ( @xcite ) have been obtained at 2200@xmath5 using the hubble space telescope s faint object camera with a very small ( 22 ) field of view .",
    "a fuv ( @xmath121500@xmath5 ) survey of galaxies at redshifts of @xmath12  0.10.2 is also underway using the space telescope imaging spectrograph , again with a small ( 25 ) field of view ( @xcite ) . with a 40@xmath15 field of view and @xmath123@xmath14 resolution ,",
    "uit was optimally suited to study the morphology of nearby galaxies with good resolution .",

    "2000 ) , we present the results of an uv  optical imaging survey of nearby bright galaxies .",
    "the uv images were obtained by the uit during the _ astro1 _ and _ astro2 _ spacelab missions in 1990 and 1995 respectively . ground  based optical ccd images of the sample galaxies were obtained with pixel scales and fields of view approximately comparable to those of the uit images .",
    "the _ astro1 _ data presented in marcum et al .",
    "include both fuv ( @xmath121500@xmath5 ) and nuv(@xmath122500@xmath5 ) data as well as optical images for 43 galaxies .",

    "our sample consists of 34 galaxies observed with uit during the _ astro2 _",
    "mission for which we have also obtained ground  based optical images .",
    "many of the galaxies were selected as part of a uit guest observer program specifically to investigate the uv morphology in prototypes of different hubble types .",

    "1997a ) , or individually for selected purposes .",
    "it is important to remember that while this sample does contain galaxies with a range of morphologies , it was not chosen to statistically represent the relative distribution of hubble types in the local population .",
    "the galaxies have types e to irr ( @xmath16 = 5.0  + 10.0 ) , and are located at distances of @xmath17 mpc ( @xmath18km / s / mpc ) . late  type systems in which star formation produces prominent morphological features in the fuv are emphasized .",

    "the sample galaxies were observed in the fuv with uit , a 38 cm .",
    "chretien telescope mounted on the _ astro _ payload .",
    "astro2 _ mission during which these data were obtained was flown on the space shuttle endeavour on 218 march 1995 .",
    "details of the telescope and instrumentation , as well as specific information about pipeline data processing of the uv images , can be found in stecher et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and will be briefly summarized here . only the fuv ( @xmath191500 ) camera was operational during the _",
    "astro2 _ mission .",
    "two fuv filters were used : the b1 filter with an effective wavelength of 1520@xmath20 and width 354@xmath20 , and the slightly narrower b5 filter with effective wavelength of 1615@xmath20 and width 225@xmath20 , which was used during daylight observations to exclude dayglow emission lines ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "based on observations of early  type galaxies ( @xcite ) , there is no evidence for a `` red leak '' in the system .",
    "the camera consisted of a two  stage image intensifier coupled to kodak iia0 film on which the images were recorded .",
    "the photographic film was digitized with a 20@xmath21 m square aperture and 10@xmath21 m sample spacing , then binned to a 20@xmath21 m spacing ( @xcite ) . in the pipeline data reductions ,",
    "background `` fog '' from the photographic film was subtracted , and the images were linearized , flatfielded , and calibrated .",
    "the final output images have a scale of 1.136/pixel and a typical point spread function of fwhm @xmath12 3@xmath14 in the central 16@xmath15 of the frame , in which nearly all of the galaxies studied here are imaged ( @xcite ) .",
    "uit images with enough stars to calculate astrometric solutions were corrected for distortion ( @xcite ; @xcite ) ; these data products were used where available .",
    "however , we note that even on uncorrected images , the uncertainty due to distortion in the central part of the frame ( where most of our galaxy images are located ) is less than or equal to the psf fwhm .",
    "after visual inspection of all available fuv images for each galaxy , we selected the ones with the best signal  to  noise and image quality for further analysis . in most cases",
    "this is the image with the longest exposure time , unless that image is noted in the uit log to suffer pointing problems or other defects . in such cases ,",
    "the longest exposure time image of good quality was used .",
    "the uv  bright center of ngc 4151 is saturated in the uit _",
    "astro2 _ images ; for photometry of this galaxy , see @xcite .",
    "we select a long  exposure uit image of this galaxy to show the faint spiral arms as well as the active nucleus .",
    "the uit exposure time of the image selected for each galaxy is given in table  [ galxd2 ] .",
    "many of the fuv images required no further processing beyond the uit pipeline , but some have a noticeable `` stripe '' artifact through the center of the frame ( @xcite ) . if the entire galaxy was located within the stripe , no correction was made and care was taken to determine the sky value within the stripe as well . for galaxies located partly within and partly outside the stripe ,",
    "a quadratic surface was fit to the frame after masking out the central region ( where the galaxy lies ) and the frame edges .",
    "this surface was then subtracted before the sky background and surface brightness profile were measured .",
    "the fuv sky background is typically low ( see @xcite for a discussion of the uv background ) , ranging from undetectable ( with a 1@xmath22 limit of @xmath1225  mag  arcsec@xmath23 ) up to 22  mag  arcsec@xmath23 for a few images acquired during daylight .",
    "broad  band optical images of the sample galaxies were obtained over the past several years with the las campanas observatory 2.5 m du pont telescope , the ctio 1.5 m telescope , and the palomar 1.5 m and 5 m telescopes .",
    "all of the galaxies presented here were imaged in at least one of the @xmath24 bands ; many have multi  color photometry .",
    "observations at las campanas were carried out using the 2048@xmath252048 tek 5 ccd with a scale of 0.26/pixel .",
    "the ctio observations utilized the tek 2048@xmath252048 ccd with a scale of 0.43/pixel .",
    "data from the palomar 1.5 m telescope were taken using the 2048@xmath252048 ccd13 or ccd16 with a scale of 0.37/pixel ; some of these were binned to 1024@xmath251024 with a scale of 0.74/pixel .",
    "observations with the palomar 5 m telescope used the cosmic camera with a 2048@xmath252048 ccd and a scale of 0.28/pixel ; again some images were binned to a scale of 0.55/pixel .",
    "table  [ galxd2 ] shows the telescope , filters , and exposure times for each galaxy .",
    "data reduction for the optical images was carried out using the iraf ( @xcite ) and vista ( @xcite ) packages .",
    "the images were bias  subtracted and flatfielded with twilight or dome flats for each filter .",
    "an apparent gradient in the background of some of the @xmath6 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 frames taken at palomar remained after these steps .",
    "a planar surface was fit to these frames after masking out the galaxy , then subtracted before further processing .",
    "cosmic rays were identified with the iraf `` cosmicrays '' package and were replaced with an average of surrounding pixel values . if more than one data frame was available for a galaxy in a specific filter , the frames were registered using the coordinates of several bright stars , scaled to the same exposure time , and a zeropoint offset was applied to match the background levels .",
    "the frames were then averaged ( for two ) or median combined ( for three or more ) .",
    "some of the images are saturated at the galaxy centers ; no correction is applied but the saturated pixels were flagged for future consideration .",
    "sky levels were determined in boxes away from the galaxy . in some cases ( flagged in table  [ galxd2 ] )",
    "the galaxy nearly fills the frame and thus the background level is somewhat uncertain . on images in which several regions of sky away from the galaxy can be measured , the typical r.m.s .",
    "scatter in sky levels across the frame is less than 2% of the sky value .",
    "calibrations were applied to each image to obtain the approximate relative alignment of the multicolor light profiles presented in section  3 .",
    "the uit data were calibrated using standard stars measured by the international ultraviolet explorer ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "the resulting flux calibration is estimated to be accurate to @xmath29 ( @xcite ) ; this value includes the uncertainty in the final @xmath28 calibration .",
    "magnitudes are on the monochromatic system : @xmath30 where the flux is in units of erg cm@xmath23s@xmath32 @xmath33 .",
    "calibration data for each image are stored in the image headers of the uit data products .    because many of the optical data were obtained under non ",
    "photometric conditions , the frames were calibrated via comparison to published aperture photometry for each galaxy .",
    "we used the catalog of @xcite , excluding any data whose zeropoint was found by these authors to be systematically offset by more than 0.05 mag . from that galaxy s curve of growth .",
    "we calculated the difference between a synthetic aperture magnitude measured on our galaxy image and the published value for each of the tabulated apertures that fit on our frame . after examining the residuals as a function of ( @xmath34 ) or ( @xmath35 ) color for those galaxies with",
    "sufficient published data over a range of colors , we found no strong evidence for color terms in the calibration .",
    "therefore , we simply used the mean difference between the measured and published magnitudes as a calibration constant . for images",
    "in which the galaxy center was saturated , we compared the observed and published magnitudes in annuli between the smallest published aperture that enclosed all the saturated pixels and subsequent apertures . the typical scatter around this mean difference ranges from 0.020.15 mag .",
    ", which is not unexpected for a mix of photometric and non  photometric data from several different instruments .",
    "the uncertainty in optical aperture magnitudes due to sky and instrument noise is typically @xmath36 .",
    "if no catalog data were available for a particular galaxy / filter , we substituted an average of the calibration constants determined in that filter for other galaxies observed during the same night .",
    "as all but one of these cases involved calibration of @xmath26 or @xmath27band data , airmass differences between the galaxies that were bootstrapped and those for which calibrations were determined from the literature are likely to contribute only small errors .",
    "galaxies for which this procedure was necessary are flagged in table  [ galxd2 ] ; their calibrations are correspondingly less certain than the others .",
    "overall , combining the noise and calibration errors , we estimate an uncertainty in the optical magnitudes of @xmath37 , with the exact value for each galaxy depending on the quality of the observations and the availability of published data .      in order to facilitate the direct comparison of galaxy morphology at uv and optical wavelengths , we transformed the coordinates of the optical data onto the system of the uit data and smoothed all data for a particular galaxy to the same resolution . because the fuv images contain few or no stars , the coordinates of uv  bright star ",
    "forming regions were used to determine a linear transformation ( rotation , scaling , and translation ) between the shortest wavelength optical image and the uit data .",
    "after the transformation was applied to that optical image , the centroids of several bright stars were used to align additional optical data . finally , we measured the fwhm of the point spread function ( psf ) on each optical image and smoothed the frame to the uit resolution of 3 .",
    "the psf fwhm for two galaxies , m51 and ngc 925 , were slightly larger than the uit fwhm ( 4@xmath14 and 4.5@xmath14 respectively ) ; in these cases the uit images were smoothed to the optical resolution .",
    "the final images have the uit scale of 1.136/pixel , implying physical scales ranging from @xmath38 pc / pixel for our sample galaxies .",
    "foreground stars and any remaining artifacts were masked out on the optical and fuv data before producing the images and surface brightness profiles presented in section 3 .",
    "for the optical data , we identified stars on the longest wavelength image and created a mask that was used to interpolate over those pixels on all of the optical images .",
    "most of the sample galaxies lie at high galactic latitude , so few foreground bright stars were present .",
    "however , in the case of ngc 2403 , badly saturated bright stars in the @xmath26 and @xmath27bands necessitated masking large areas of those images . for this galaxy",
    ", we created a separate mask for the @xmath39 images , which did not require such extensive corrections .",
    "in a few cases it was difficult to determine whether bright spots within the galaxy were foreground stars or hii regions ; here we carefully compared the optical and fuv images and masked only those spots that were not visible in the fuv .",
    "some galaxies also required a fuv mask to interpolate over small , bright point  like or streak artifacts ( mostly due to cosmic rays ) that remained after prior data processing .",
    "in figures  [ ims](@xmath40 ) , we present multiwavelength images for the sample galaxies .",
    "the sky backgrounds have been removed , foreground stars have been masked as described above . for display purposes",
    "only , image pixel values have been converted to `` calibrated '' flux units such that : @xmath41 the images for a given galaxy are displayed using the same range of calibrated brightness for each filter , so that pixels with the same brightness ( flux/@xmath5 ) have a constant gray level on each image .",
    "this mode of presentation shows the relative limiting surface brightnesses of the data at different wavelengths . to conserve space",
    ", we do not show every optical image , as those from adjacent optical filters often look nearly identical .",
    "it is quite difficult to simultaneously show structure in the bright centers of galaxies and faint outlying features , so we present additional images of some galaxies with different scales or normalizations in figures  [ vfigsf ] and [ vfigearly ] .",
    "the four fuv  bright galaxies shown in figure  [ vfigsf ] are displayed with a much larger scale to show the central regions . in figure  [ vfigearly ] , we show several galaxies with red fuv ",
    "optical colors , mainly early  type galaxies or those with a prominent optical bulge . here",
    "we show the optical images with a much larger stretch than the fuv data , so that the central structure of the optical image can be compared to the fuv .",
    "we also plan to make our images available to the community in digital form via the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) ; they can then be renormalized as appropriate for any application .",
    "we extract surface brightness profiles for each galaxy by azimuthally averaging around concentric ellipses .",
    "the ellipse center , ellipticity , and position angle ( p.a . ) for each galaxy were determined by running an ellipse  fitting package in vista ( based on the method of @xcite ) on the longest available wavelength image , usually @xmath26 or @xmath27 .",
    "the centroid was determined in a small box around the visual center of the galaxy , taking care to use an image in which the center was not saturated .",
    "the ellipticity and p.a . are determined from the outer ellipses , where their values were typically stable over a large range in radii .",
    "these ellipse parameters were used to obtain surface brightness profiles at all wavelengths , in order to avoid problems with determining centroids and fitting ellipses on the often asymmetric and irregular fuv images . for one galaxy ,",
    "ngc 3115 , we were unable to align the optical and fuv images due to a lack of bright features or foreground stars in the fuv .",
    "we determined a separate fuv ellipticity and p.a .",
    "for this galaxy using the ellipse fitting routine .",
    "the ellipticity and p.a . for each galaxy , which are given in table  [ galxdat ] , are quite similar to the @xmath42 ( @xcite ) values ( @xmath43 and @xmath44 ) .",
    "the surface brightness profiles derived for each sample galaxy are shown in figure  [ sbprofs](@xmath45 ) , with data from the various filters denoted by different symbols .",
    "images in which the galaxy center was saturated are identifiable by their flat profiles in the central regions ; this is the case for several optical images and the inner @xmath1210@xmath14 of the fuv data for ngc 4151 .",
    "profiles for a subset of our sample were compared to those extracted by fanelli et al .",
    "( 1997b ) from the same data ; no significant differences are noted .",
    "the profiles have not been corrected for foreground galactic extinction .",
    "however , the foreground @xmath46 values ( given in table  1 ) are generally small , so even fuv extinctions of @xmath47 amount to @xmath48mag and would have little effect on the plots of figure  [ sbprofs ]",
    ".    three systems in our sample are interacting pairs for which it is difficult to separate the light profiles of the two galaxies : ngc 4038/9 , ngc 3226/7 , and ngc 5194/5 ( m51a , b ) .",

    "many of the outer ellipses cut through the companion , creating a slight `` bump '' in the outer part of the optical surface brightness profiles .",
    "the outer ellipses for ngc 3227 encompass all of the fuv light and a significant fraction of the optical light of its companion ngc 3226 . within the available software packages ,",
    "it is impossible to avoid this situation without either severely truncating the ngc 3227 profile or changing the ellipticity so much that it no longer accurately reflects the shape of ngc 3227 .",
    "however , the ngc 3226 profile of the region with detectable fuv emission is relatively unaffected . the merger system ngc 4038/9 is treated as one galaxy , as the fuv image does not suggest a simple division into two separate disks .",
    "we created an image of this system consisting of only pixels with flux greater than 1.5@xmath49 above the background that also have at least 4 adjacent pixels above the threshold .",
    "( `` adjacent '' pixels are defined as those that share either an edge or corner with the pixel in question ; thus each pixel has 8 adjacent neighbors . )",
    "this image is approximately circular , so we defined an aperture center at the geometric center of the fuv image and used circular annuli to measure the light profiles .",
    "color profiles are produced by subtracting the surface brightness profiles ( in mag  arcsec@xmath23 ) of different filters .",
    "the use of a single set of ellipse parameters for all images of a particular galaxy ensures that the light profiles at each wavelength sample the same physical region and thus can be compared in this simple manner .",
    "color profiles for many of the sample galaxies will be presented and discussed in the next section .",
    "in this section we present a qualitative discussion of the differences in apparent morphology between fuv and optical images .",
    "the morphological types included in each subsection below are approximate , stemming in part from the fact that several galaxies have characteristics associated with more than one `` type '' .",
    "rather than discussing each galaxy individually ( as is done in marcum et al . 2000 ) , we summarize the changes in apparent morphology with wavelength for various hubble types .",
    "( interested readers can see the results for each individual galaxy from the data presented in figure  [ ims ] . ) throughout this section , we also consider implications of our analysis for the study of high  redshift galaxies that are observed in their rest ",

    "the fuv light profiles of these systems  ngc 3379 , ngc 3384 , ngc 4649 , ngc 3226 , and ngc 3115  drop off much more rapidly than the optical light , and the colors throughout are quite red ( fuv@xmath26 @xmath12 25 ) .",
    "light radii for these galaxies are @xmath122035% of their @xmath50band values tabulated in the @xmath42 ( we can not compare directly to our optical data because most of the e / so optical images suffer saturation in the center ) .",
    "the only exception to this pattern is ngc 1510 , the interacting companion of ngc 1512 .",
    "the fuv emission in this galaxy is comparable to the optical light in both brightness and physical extent and is likely due to tidally induced star formation rather than the evolved population .",

    "their fuv emission would be much more compact than the optical light , which would lead to difficulties in detection and confusion in estimating their typical size .",
    "galaxies of hubble type sa ",
    "sbc tend to appear as later  type spirals in the fuv than at optical wavelengths , primarily due to fading of the red bulge and bar in uv images .",
    "a significant fraction of the fuv light in these systems comes from star  forming regions in the spiral arms , which are visible in the images of figure  [ ims ] and appear as `` bumps '' in the fuv surface brightness profiles of figure  [ sbprofs ] ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "some early  type spirals , such as m63 and ngc 1672 , also appear more patchy or fragmented in the fuv because old stars in the underlying smooth disk do not produce much light at very short wavelengths .",
    "these results are in agreement with earlier work by oconnell ( 1997a ) and oconnell & marcum ( 1996 ) for smaller samples of galaxies .",
    "the dramatic fading of light in the central regions ( also noted by @xcite and @xcite ) produces a global pattern in which the central fuv ",
    "optical colors are much redder than the outer regions , as shown in figure  [ ecolpr ] for m  51 , ngc  1566 , and m  63 .",
    "two notable exceptions to this pattern are ngc 4151 , in which the seyfert 1 nucleus dominates the central fuv emission and is much brighter than the weak spiral arms , and ngc 1068 , in which the fuv  bright seyfert 2 nucleus and surrounding star  formation combine to produce a very blue center .",
    "the uv morphologies and luminosities of the agn and star  forming components in these two galaxies are discussed in more detail by @xcite .",
    "many early  type spirals also show evidence of star  forming inner rings or circumnuclear star formation , which often dominate the fuv images and light profiles .",
    "images of these features , which are present in ngc 1097 , ngc 1512 , ngc 1672 , ngc 3310 , ngc 3351 , and ngc 4736 , are shown in figure  [ sfring ] , and the associated color profiles are plotted in figure  [ ringcolpr ] . the star ",
    "forming rings appear as spikes of fuv brightness or very blue color in the radial profiles of figures  [ sbprofs ] and [ ringcolpr ] .",
    "inner and circumnuclear rings are thought to be orchestrated by dynamical resonances , which are often associated with central bars ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the fuv properties of some specific ringed galaxies are discussed by waller et al .",
    "( 1997c , 2000 ) for ngc 4736 , smith et al .",

    "galaxies classified from their optical images as early  type spirals may present a variety of different appearances when viewed at high redshift , in their rest ",
    "frame fuv . optically barred galaxies such as ngc 1097 and ngc 1365 will appear unbarred in the ultraviolet .",
    "isolated galaxies such as ngc 1672 that appear highly fragmented in the fuv may be mistaken for an ongoing merger .",
    "images of distant systems may recover only the fuv  bright star  forming rings or circumnuclear star formation , yielding little evidence of the underlying regular structure seen in the galaxy s optical light ( see also waller et al .",
    "on the other hand , galaxies such as ngc 4151 appear to have an earlier morphological type in the fuv due to the prominence of highly symmetric and strongly peaked emission from the active nucleus .",
    "finally , the appearance of a galaxy undergoing a global starburst , such as ngc 3310 , does not differ a great deal between the fuv and optical because the light at both wavelengths is dominated by young stars .",
    "we have found that all of these effects can vary in magnitude , such that some galaxies would be assigned nearly the same hubble type in the optical and fuv , while others would have very different classifications .",
    "overall , most optically  classified early  type spirals present the appearance of a later type in the fuv , but a small fraction may appear to have identical or earlier fuv types in the presence of starburst activity or an agn .",
    "galaxies that are optically classified as late  type spirals generally do not show as dramatic a difference between their fuv and optical morphologies as do early  type spirals .",
    "although they often appear somewhat more patchy in the fuv , there is no prominent optical bulge whose absence at short wavelengths is noticeable .",
    "star formation occurs over a large fraction of the galaxy , producing both fuv and optical light in the same physical regions .",
    "a number of these galaxies , including ngc 4449 , ngc 925 , ngc 1313 , and ic 2574 , show color profiles that have no definite trend with radius .",
    "these profiles , examples of which are displayed in figure  [ flatcolpr ] , are either flat or bumpy depending on the relative prominence of star  forming regions against the background disk .",
    "figure  [ bluecolpr ] shows color profiles for the central starburst galaxies m83 , ngc 4214 , and ngc 5253 , which are bluest in their centers .",
    "ngc 4214 and ngc 5253 have global color gradients in the opposite direction of that observed in early  type spirals due to the presence of a blue starburst superposed on a more extended old stellar distribution .",
    "this `` starburst core '' morphology has been previously noted in fuv  optical image comparisons of ngc 4214 ( fanelli et al .",
    "1997c ) and ngc 5253 ( kinney et al .",
    "1993 ) . a central starburst combined with bright star ",
    "forming regions in the outer disk can also produce a flat color profile , which is the case for ngc 2903 ( also shown in figure  [ bluecolpr ] ) .",
    "we find that the morphological @xmath3correction for late  type galaxies is expected to be highly dependent on whether or not they host starburst activity . as evident from their similar fuv and optical morphology , non  starbursting",
    "late  type galaxies ( dominated by ongoing disk star formation ) viewed at high redshift would not generally appear to have a very different type from their local counterparts .",
    "increased patchiness in the fuv ( if it were still detectable at large distances ) might suggest a slightly later type than the optical appearance .",
    "however , galaxies with central starbursts like those seen in ngc 4214 and ngc 5253 might present compact cores surrounded by diffuse light , similar to some objects seen on deep hst images ( giavalisco , steidel , & duccio macchetto 1996a ) . the symmetric central burst in ngc 5253 might even appear to be an e or s0 galaxy in the absence of the old stars . if starburst systems are more prevalent at high redshift , their strong influence on the rest ",
    "frame uv morphology must be considered when studying the evolution of the galaxy population .",
    "as might be expected , the morphological @xmath3correction for interacting galaxies depends strongly on the details of the interaction itself .",
    "three objects in our sample are currently undergoing interactions of various degrees : ngc 4038/9 ( the antennae ) , ngc 3226/7 , and ngc 5194/5 ( m51 ) .",
    "the merger of two disk galaxies in ngc 4038/9 has produced a significant amount of massive star formation , concentrated mainly between the two disks and around the edge of the ngc 4038 disk .",
    "thus the fuv image shows a partial outline of the merger system , and , without the corresponding optical data , suggests the appearance of a single , drastically perturbed galaxy .",
    "however , the old populations visible in long  wavelength optical images clearly delineate the inner disks and tidal tails that identify ngc 4038/9 as an ongoing disk  disk merger . in spite of the dramatic difference between its fuv and optical appearances , ngc",
    "4038/9 is clearly peculiar at both wavelengths and thus would not be misclassified as any sort of `` normal '' hubble type galaxy when viewed at high redshift .",
    "both galaxies in the ngc 3226/7 interacting pair present fuv morphologies consistent with what would be expected from their hubble types : the elliptical ngc 3226 appears highly concentrated and the sa ngc 3227 shows emission from the center and a few faint disk star  formation regions . in this case , the influence of the interaction in determining the fuv morphology is confined to its possible role in driving the seyfert nucleus and circumnuclear star formation in ngc 3227 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "ngc 5195 is not detected in the fuv , likely due to obscuration by dust from a foreground spiral arm in ngc 5194 as well as possible internal extinction ( see @xcite .",
    "@xcite also suspect that dust is responsible for their failure to detect ngc 5195 at 2200@xmath5 . )",
    "observed at high redshift in its rest  frame uv , the m51 double  galaxy system would appear to be an isolated spiral galaxy .",
    "although the examples discussed above demonstrate the difficulty of relating uv and optical morphology for interacting systems , interactions that are significant enough to severely distort the galaxies involved are often associated with enhanced star formation rates that may identify the system as `` abnormal '' in the fuv as well ( @xcite and references therein ) .      throughout this section",
    "we have discussed fuv morphology mainly in terms of the current star formation , but , as suggested by the example of m51 , one can not neglect the possibility that extinction also influences the uv appearance of galaxies .",
    "it is difficult to ascertain whether the `` patchiness '' or fragmented appearance of many galaxies in the fuv is due to internal extinction or to the pattern of massive star formation .",
    "two of the most highly inclined ( @xmath52 ) galaxies in our sample , ngc 2841 and ngc 2903 , have asymmetric fuv emission with the bright side corresponding to what appears to be the unobscured side of the optical disk .",
    "on the other hand , ngc 2403 and ic 2574 also have @xmath53 but do not appear to suffer heavy extinction on one side of the disk .",
    "these results provide further confirmation of the variations in fuv brightness of edge  on galaxies noted by smith et al .",
    "( 1997 , 2000 ) for ngc  4631 ( fuv  bright ) and ngc  891 ( undetected ) .",
    "an extreme case of extinction effects was discussed above for ngc 5195 ( m51b ) , which is completely obscured in the fuv by the foreground spiral arm of ngc 5194 ( m51a ) .",
    "as noted in the introduction , the role of dust in determining the observed fuv morphology depends strongly on the dust  star geometry of individual galaxies and is thus difficult to predict from optical images alone .",
    "we have presented fuv and optical images and surface brightness profiles for 34 galaxies observed with the uit and compared the apparent morphology at different wavelengths in the context of interpreting images of high  redshift objects .",
    "the uit data represent the most detailed set of fuv images obtained to date for large , nearby galaxies that are well  resolved .",
    "day elliptical and s0 galaxies appear smooth and symmetric in fuv as well as in optical images , but they are much more compact in the fuv and may be faint and/or unresolved at high redshift unless they are actively forming stars at that particular look  back time .",
    "the majority of spiral galaxies in our sample appear to have a later hubble type in the fuv than at optical wavelengths due to increased patchiness in combination with the fading of light from the bulge and/or bar populations .",
    "this effect is particularly dramatic for the early  type spirals , in which bulges and often bars are prominent optical features .",
    "the optical and fuv morphologies of late  type spirals and irregular galaxies do not differ as much as the earlier types because young stars dominate the light in both spectral regimes .",
    "some galaxies appear highly fragmented in the fuv images in spite of a regular optical morphology , making it hard to determine from uv data alone whether they are single systems or multiple mergers . even assuming their current rates and patterns of star formation",
    ", many spirals viewed at high redshift would be assigned later hubble types than their local counterparts due to the bandshifting effects .",
    "central or circumnuclear starbursts and star  forming rings , and bright spiral arms dominate the fuv light and fuv  optical color profiles of many galaxies . depending on the relative geometry of dust and young stars",
    ", extinction can play a varying role ( small to dominant ) in determining the apparent fuv morphology . from the galaxy sample presented here ,",
    "it is apparent that understanding the correlation between fuv and optical morphology depends on one s knowledge of not only the global optical hubble type but also of smaller scale features , mostly those due to recent star ",
    "formation patterns .    the fragmented appearance of many of the fuv images and the prominence of young stars in structures such as rings or fragments of spiral arms produces fuv morphologies that do not readily fit into the traditional bins of the hubble sequence .",
    "in order to characterize rest  frame uv galaxy populations at both low and high redshift , it will be necessary to find new ways of describing the morphology that do not by default cause the majority of galaxies to fall into the `` peculiar '' or other catch  all bins .",
    "it would also be desirable to have an objective classification scheme to express the similarities or differences between local and distant galaxies in quantitative terms .",
    "however , uv data pose problems for many automated classification schemes because galaxy centers are often ill  defined and the patchy nature complicates the selection of an aperture that encloses a single system",
    ". future work in this area will use uit data to identify new features or indices that better describe the uv morphology of galaxies .",
    "the dataset presented in this paper will be valuable for studying the morphological @xmath3correction that must be taken into account when interpreting deep optical images such as the _ hubble deep field _ ( hdf , @xcite ) .",
    "the dependence of fuv morphology on features that are considered minor or secondary details in the optical highlights the difficulty of studying evolution in the galaxy population by comparing rest  frame uv observations of high  redshift galaxies to the optical properties of local samples .",
    "the comparison between local and distant uv galaxy images is much more direct than relying on estimates of the uv morphology extrapolated from optical light and colors ( _ e.g. _ abraham et al .",
    "1997 ) . indeed , a small sample of uit galaxy images from the _ astro1 _ mission have been used to simulate the appearance of high  redshift counterparts of nearby bright galaxies ( giavalisco et al .",
    "in a subsequent paper ( @xcite ) , we simulate the cosmological distance effects of surface brightness dimming and loss of spatial resolution on the fuv images of our larger _ astro2 _ galaxy sample . these simulations provide examples of how local galaxies would appear in the hdf at redshifts of @xmath54 . in that paper",
    ", we also attempt to quantify the effects of bandshifting and distance on morphology using simple parameters such as the central concentration and asymmetry of galaxies .",
    "one of the primary goals of studying morphology is to infer the past or ongoing physical processes that have shaped galaxies . in combination with current knowledge about the dynamical states of nearby galaxies , our multi ",
    "wavelength dataset and future uv imaging data from the galex sky survey ( @xcite ) could be used to relate uv morphology to physical structures or properties .",
    "for example , waller et al .",
    "( 1997b , 2000 ) find that uv ",
    "bright starburst rings likely result from dynamical resonances with a bar component .",
    "thus ring features may predict the presence of an underlying disk and bar system even in uv images that appear to be fragmented or otherwise dynamically disorganized .",
    "it would also be of interest to further investigate the suggestion of waller et al .",
    "( 1997b ) that optical hubble type may be correlated with fuv@xmath6 color ( although rest  frame @xmath6band data will not necessarily be available for high  redshift galaxies ) .",

    "<S> this sample , which includes a range of classical hubble types from elliptical to irregular with emphasis on spirals at low inclination angle , provides a valuable database for comparison with images of high@xmath2 galaxies whose fuv light is redshifted into the optical and near  infrared bands . </S>",

    "<S> we present images and surface brightness profiles for each galaxy , and we discuss the wavelength  dependence of morphology for different hubble types in the context of understanding high@xmath2 objects . in general , the dominance of young stars in the fuv produces the patchy appearance of a morphological type later than that inferred from optical images . </S>",
    "<S> prominent rings and circumnuclear star formation regions are clearly evident in fuv images of spirals , while bulges , bars , and old , red stellar disks are faint to invisible at these short wavelengths . </S>",
    "<S> however , the magnitude of the change in apparent morphology ranges from dramatic in early  type spirals with prominent optical bulges to slight in late  type spirals and irregulars , in which young stars dominate both the uv and optical emission . </S>",
    "<S> starburst galaxies with centrally concentrated , symmetric bursts display an apparent `` e / s0 '' structure in the fuv , while starbursts associated with rings or mergers produce a peculiar morphology . </S>",
    "<S> we briefly discuss the inadequacy of the optically  defined hubble sequence to describe fuv galaxy images and estimate morphological @xmath3corrections , and we suggest some directions for future research with this dataset . </S>"
