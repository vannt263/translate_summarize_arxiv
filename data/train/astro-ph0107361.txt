    "the first hint of neptune s atmospheric complexity and variability came when @xcite observed significant changes in neptune s brightness at @xmath8 m over the course of approximately an earth year .",
    "@xcite interpreted this as the formation and slow dissipation of an extensive high - altitude cloud .",
    "the 1989 flyby of the voyager ii spacecraft revealed a host of time - varying atmospheric features @xcite . even before the voyager ii flyby , the development of the charge coupled device ( ccd ) allowed imaging of neptune at wavelengths up to @xmath91  @xmath0 m .",
    "several observers looking in the 0.62 and 0.89  @xmath0 m methane absorption bands regularly found mid - latitude features that were extremely bright relative to neptune s disk @xcite .",
    "these features are presumably clouds and may be storms or large upwellings of material from the troposphere .",
    "when present , the reflected sunlight from these features dominates images of neptune at methane - absorbing wavelengths between 0.6 and 2.5  @xmath0 m , as shown by many observers . hubble space telescope ( hst ) regularly observed such features at wavelengths less than 1  @xmath0 m @xcite , while ground based observers using conventional infrared techniques have seen these features at 1 to 2.5  @xmath0 m @xcite .",
    "more recently , high resolution techniques such as speckle imaging and adaptive optics ( ao ) have been used to observe neptune and these bright features at 1 - 2.5  @xmath0 m @xcite .",
    "speculation about the nature and origin of these phenomena has primarily focused on the idea of large upwellings punching through the tropopause resulting in a high column density of condensed methane particles .",
    "thus , these features could in part be responsible for transporting methane through the cold - trap of the tropopause and loading the stratosphere with methane gas , where it is then photolyzed and converted to a variety of heavier hydrocarbons , eventually forming hazes @xcite .",
    "it is crucial for our understanding of the dynamics and chemistry of neptune s atmosphere to know the altitude range to which these cloud features reach .",
    "@xcite estimated from their ccd photometry that the bright features they observed were due to increases in the number density of high stratospheric haze particles .",
    "@xcite observed neptune with adaptive optics techniques .",
    "they used two narrowband filters centered on 1.56 and 1.72  @xmath0 m , such that one filter is centered on a strong methane absorption feature while the other filter is outside the strong methane absorption .",
    "these authors estimated that the bright features are located near the tropopause at pressures on the order of 0.1  bar or , possibly , at even higher altitudes .",
    "more recently @xcite , using irtf photometry , found the altitudes of a number of discrete cloud features to be between 0.060 and 0.230  bar . in this paper",
    "we present spectra of two of these cloud features . through comparison with a simple radiative transfer model , we used these spectra to determine precisely the altitude of the cloud features .",
    "our best - fit model places the top of the bright southern cloud feature that we observed at a pressure level of 0.14  bar within an uncertainty range of 0.11 to 0.19  bar , while the best - fit for the dimmer northern feature puts it at 0.084@xmath50.026 bar .",
    "we observed neptune on 1999 june 2 ( ut ) using nirspec , the w.m .",
    "keck observatory s new near - infrared spectrometer , on the keck ii telescope during the commissioning of the nirspec instrument @xcite .",
    "this spectrometer operates over a wavelength range of 0.955.5  @xmath0 m in either a low - resolution ( r @xmath9 2000 ) mode or a cross - dispersed high - resolution ( r @xmath9 25,000 ) mode .",
    "nirspec is equipped with a 1024 @xmath10 1024 insb aladdin array for spectroscopy , and also a slit - viewing camera ( scam ) containing a 256 @xmath10 256 hgcdte picnic array with 0@xmath1118 pixels .",
    "the data presented here are from a single low - resolution setting using the nirspec-6 blocking filter , and they cover roughly 2.032.30  @xmath0 m . in low - resolution mode",
    "the pixel size in the spatial direction of the aladdin spectral array is 0.144/pixel .",
    "we acquired a series of slit - viewing camera ( scam ) images both before and during our spectral exposures , giving us images of neptune with the spectrometer s slit offset from the disk of neptune and overlapping the disk of neptune .",
    "scam images were taken in pairs , and after the first exposure of each pair the pointing of the telescope was offset by 10  . in the current work we did not attempt precise photometry , and",
    "therefore our processing of the scam images is simplistic : we subtracted one image of each pair from the other for background and bias subtraction .",
    "we then shifted and coadded the images using the gaussian centroids of triton and an unidentified star for offset determination . from",
    "triton ( apparent diameter 0@xmath11126 ) and the unidentified star the fwhm of the point spread function was 0@xmath1143@xmath50@xmath1107 .",
    "figure 1a shows a scam image of neptune taken simultaneously with the spectra presented in this work where the disk is bisected by the slit .",
    "figure 1b shows an unobstructed image taken 25 minutes earlier . the scam image shown in fig .",
    "1a was taken with the nirspec-6 filter , ( 1.56 - 2.32  @xmath0 m ) , while the unobstructed scam image in fig .",
    "1b was taken with the nirspec-7 filter ( 1.84 - 2.63  @xmath0 m ) .",
    "we did not take an unobstructed scam image in the nirspec-6 filter , and therefore we present the nirspec-7 filter image to show neptune unobstructed by the spectrometer slit .",
    "neptune s apparent diameter ( at 1  bar level ) was 2@xmath1130 , the earth s planetographic sub - latitude on neptune was -28@xmath108 , and the solar phase angle was 1@xmath154 .",
    "figure 1c shows the orientation and scale of neptune on the images in fig .",
    "neptune s brightness along the slit is shown in fig .",
    "comparison of neptune s brightness as a function of position on the slit with that of hd201941 ( fig .",
    "1d ) shows that the projected size of the storm is only marginally resolved .",
    "the local minimum between the features on neptune indicates that we can extract spectra of the two separate features relatively cleanly without much cross - contamination .",
    "-1.5 in -0.5 in -1 in    the spectra presented here come from two 60-second exposures taken with a 42@xmath11 @xmath10 0@xmath11380 slit starting at 14:06 ( ut ) on 1999 june 2 .",
    "the slit was aligned parallel with neptune s north - south axis and centered on the bright feature in the southern hemisphere .",
    "this feature was by far the brightest that we observed on neptune on 1999 june 2 ( ut ) .",
    "the slit also captured light from a dimmer feature in neptune s northern hemisphere . between the two exposures",
    "the pointing of the telescope was moved @xmath910  along the direction of the slit , so that neptune fit easily on the slit for both exposures . in order to correct for earth s atmospheric absorption",
    ", we observed an a2 spectral type star ( hd201941 ) in two 10 second exposures , with an offset of the telescope pointing between exposures in order to move the star along the slit .",
    "the reduction sequence consisted simply of subtraction of one star spectral frame from the other for bias and background subtraction . in these images",
    "the spatial and spectral coordinates are distorted with respect to the rows and columns of the detector array .",
    "the oh sky emission lines in unsubtracted frames trace out lines of constant wavelength and are well fit by straight lines @xmath12 where a@xmath13 and a@xmath14 are functions of wavelength .",
    "meanwhile , the arc of a stellar spectrum traces out a line of constant position along the slit and is well fit by the function @xmath15 where b@xmath13 , b@xmath14 , and b@xmath7 are all functions of slit position ( s ) .",
    "the ( x , y ) position on the array for a given slit - position and wavelength ( s,@xmath16 ) can then be found by : interpolating a@xmath13 and a@xmath14 for @xmath16 from the numerous oh lines that we fit , interpolating b@xmath13 , b@xmath14 , and b@xmath7 from the several stellar spectra fit , and finally finding the ( x , y ) intersection of eqns .  1 and 2 .",
    "by doing this for a grid of wavelengths and positions along the slit the data in a spectral image is interpolated from ( x , y ) to ( s,@xmath16 ) .",
    "the final step in this rectification process is to apply a jacobian correction for the geometric distortion .",
    "we extracted the stellar spectrum from the rectified spectral image using an optimal weighted extraction technique that includes a median filter rejection algorithm to remove the effects of bad pixels and cosmic ray hits .",
    "finally , we divided the extracted stellar spectrum by that of vega ( spectral type a0v ) @xcite to produce an estimate of the combined atmospheric and instrumental transfer function , shown in fig .  2a .",
    "-3.0 in -0.75 in -1.75 in    we processed the spectrum of neptune in a manner similar to that applied to the calibration star ; however , after rectification , but before extraction , we inserted the additional step of dividing by the transfer function determined from the star .",
    "the final rectified spectral image of neptune is shown in fig .",
    "we extracted the spectra of the cloud features in a similar manner as for the stellar spectrum , except that we limited the extractions to 0@xmath116 along the slit centered on each feature .",
    "the spectrum of the dimmer northern cloud feature is shown in fig .",
    "2c , and the spectrum of the brighter southern feature is shown in fig .",
    "2d . shown in fig .  2c and 2d",
    "are averages from the two separate exposures .",
    "having two separate exposures provides a check on our precision .",
    "the two spectra of the northern feature extracted from the two exposures appeared identical except for random noise .",
    "similarly , the two southern feature spectra were also very nearly identical .",
    "navigation on the images of neptune is difficult because light from the cloud so dominates over all other features , however the presence of triton in the slit - viewing camera images makes this problem significantly easier . by centroiding a gaussian on triton and using the offset from triton to neptune s center given by jpl s horizons ephemeris",
    ", we find the center of neptune .",
    "combining this with centroiding a gaussian on the cloud feature we estimate the cloud to be located 0@xmath1165@xmath50@xmath1125 from the center of neptune s disk at a neptune latitude of -48@xmath176@xmath1 .",
    "thus , the cloud lay at a viewing angle @xmath18 of 34@xmath1717@xmath1 , where @xmath18 is the angle between the normal on neptune s ` surface ' and our line of sight . by a similar procedure we estimate the observed northern feature to be at a latitude of 30@xmath1713@xmath1 and a viewing angle of 55@xmath19 .",
    "our aim in the work presented here is to measure the altitude or pressure level at the top of an infrared - bright cloud on neptune . towards this end",
    "we have taken spectra , presented in the previous section , over a wavelength range where the opacity in neptune s atmosphere varies significantly as a function of wavelength due to h@xmath7 collision induced absorption ( h@xmath7-cia ) and methane absorption . in our model",
    "we calculate the predicted spectrum as a function of the altitude of the top of the cloud and several other parameters described below .",
    "we judge the goodness - of - fit for each model spectrum using the metric @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is chosen in each case to minimize the overall sum .",
    "the introduction of the factor @xmath21 is necessary due to the lack of an absolute flux calibration for the observed spectrum , i@xmath22 .",
    "our model atmosphere consists of 120 layers evenly spaced in log@xmath23(p@xmath24 ) from 5.0 to @xmath25  bar .",
    "we interpolate the temperature and pressure for each layer from @xcite .",
    "the free parameters in our model are : the mole fraction of helium , f@xmath26 ; the mole fraction of methane in the stratosphere , f@xmath27 ; the mole fraction of methane in the troposphere , f@xmath28 ; the fraction of h@xmath7 in _ ortho / para _ thermodynamic equilibrium , f@xmath29 ; the viewing angle , @xmath18 ; and the pressure altitude of the top of the cloud in  bar , p@xmath24 . around the tropopause",
    "the fractional methane abundance follows the saturation vapor curve , so that the methane abundance is never super - saturated . wavelengths of 2.03 - 2.30 @xmath0 m do not probe significantly into the troposphere , and therefore our model fit is insensitive to changes in f@xmath28 . in each layer a fraction of the h@xmath7 , f@xmath29 , is distributed between _ ortho _ and _ para _ states according to thermodynamic equilibrium , with the remaining h@xmath7 distributed according to an _",
    "ortho_:_para _ ratio of 3:1 .",

    "accurate modeling of methane absorption across the near - infrared spectrum is extremely difficult due to the enormous number of individual lines and huge variation in line strength .",
    "we apply the correlated _ k _ distribution method as described in @xcite and on p.  230 of @xcite .",
    "we use the h@xmath7-broadened methane _",
    "k_-coefficients of @xcite since neptune s atmosphere is primarily h@xmath7 .",
    "these coefficients are for 5 @xmath38 wide bins and this places a limit on the spectral resolution of the model .",
    "we ignore all scattering processes , except reflection from the top of the cloud .",
    "although significant at shorter wavelengths , rayleigh scattering is negligible at wavelengths of 2.0 to 2.3  @xmath0 m .",
    "light reflected from the top of the cloud dominates all other sources which might contribute to our cloud spectrum , such as scattered light from stratospheric hydrocarbon hazes .",
    "therefore , the only scattering process that we include is reflection from the top of the cloud , which we model as a flat reflecting layer .",
    "the reflectivity of the top of the cloud , or alternatively , the combined optical depth , scattering phase function , and single scattering albedo , are irrelevant given that we fit the shape of the spectrum , not the absolute flux level .",
    "further , we assume that the optical depth , scattering phase function , and single scattering albedo do not vary significantly over the wavelength range of our spectrum ( 2.03 to 2.3  @xmath0 m ) . using the solar spectrum of @xcite , the model produces the estimated spectrum of the cloud as a function of the pressure level of the top of the cloud .",
    "the spectral resolution of the model described in the previous section is limited by the _ k_-coefficients of @xcite and is coarser than the spectral resolution of our observed spectra .",
    "therefore , we bin the observed spectra in wavelength to achieve a resolution as nearly identical as possible to the model spectra .",
    "we restrict the model fitting to the wavelength range 2.08 - 2.25  @xmath0 m in order to avoid a large telluric co@xmath7 band at @xmath39 m and a series of sharp methane features at @xmath40 m that are poorly represented by the methane coefficients in the model .    for the bright southern feature at a viewing angle of @xmath41 , we obtain our best - fit for a cloud top at 0.14  bar , f@xmath42 , f@xmath43 , and f@xmath44 . for the dimmer northern feature at a viewing angle of @xmath45 ,",
    "the best fit is for a cloud - top pressure of 0.084  bar , f@xmath42 , f@xmath43 , and f@xmath44 .",

    "3a ) , nor outside the range of 0.058 - 0.110  bar for the dimmer northern feature ( see spectra ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) of fig .",
    "3b ) . as shown in fig .  4",
    ", reasonable model fits to both the northern and southern spectra require f@xmath460.8 . we find that our data do not constrain significantly f@xmath26 and f@xmath27 .",
    "-1.0 in -0.75 in -0.5 in    due to the low spatial resolution of our data there is significant uncertainty in the viewing angle for both features , @xmath47 for the bright southern feature and @xmath48 for the dimmer northern feature .",
    "decreasing @xmath18 to @xmath49 for the bright southern feature pushes the best - fit cloud - top pressure to 0.16 bar , while increasing @xmath18 to 51@xmath1 changes the best - fit cloud - top pressure to 0.12  bar .",
    "similarly for the northern feature , decreasing @xmath18 to 51@xmath1 moves the best - fit cloud - top pressure to 0.092  bar , while increasing @xmath18 to 64@xmath1 shifts the best - fit cloud - top pressure to 0.076  bar .",
    "in all these cases the best - fit parameters include f@xmath50 and f@xmath51 .",
    "at this point it is worthwhile to make a brief discussion of how the errors and uncertainties in our observations and model fitting could affect our results with respect to cloud - top pressure and f@xmath29 .    on the observing side",
    ", we are much more concerned with systematic errors , for instance artificial slopes across the entire spectrum , than with random errors in the spectra of hd201941 and neptune .",
    "since we are fitting the model to 73 wavelength bins , random errors from bin to bin will tend to cancel out and not bias the model fit .",
    "there are several possible sources of systematic errors on the observing side ; the three of greatest concern relate to alignment on the slit and the method of atmospheric correction .",
    "misalignment of the slit on the star would redden the spectrum and possibly introduce a bias in the final model fitting . this is less of an issue on an extended source such as the clouds on neptune . by looking at multiple stellar spectra",
    "we estimate that this source of error introduces at most a one to two percent slope from 2.08 to 2.25  @xmath0 m .",
    "-2.0 in -1.5 in -1.5 in    in applying the atmospheric and instrumental transmission correction with hd201941 there are two more potential sources of systematic error .",
    "the first is that to find the atmospheric transmission function we divided hd201941 by a spectrum of vega , and the second is that hd201941 was not observed at exactly the same airmass and time as neptune . while vega is an a0v star , hd201941 is listed as an a2 star in the simbad database . in order to estimate the maximum slope bias that this stellar mis - match could introduce , we compared blackbody curves .",
    "@xcite give the t@xmath52 for an a0v star as 9790  k and for an a2v star as 9000  k. this difference suggests a slope error of 0.29 percent from 2.08 to 2.25  @xmath0 m .",
    "the spectra of hd201941 were taken at an airmass 1.05 , while the neptune spectra were taken at airmass 1.28 .",
    "in order to minimize the influence of this on the model fitting we excluded wavelengths shortward of 2.08  @xmath0 m to avoid a large co band . to investigate what biases and slopes this mismatch in airmass",
    "could introduce we used the atran @xcite model atmospheric transparency spectra available on the gemini observatory website . while we did not examine transparency spectra for our exact airmasses , the slope difference introduced by observing at airmass 1.0 versus 1.5 across our spectral range of interest would be 1.6 percent .",
    "each of these possible slope errors discussed above is less than 2 percent . to show that even a fortuitous addition of all these slope errors in one direction would not change our primary results we artificially introduced slope errors of @xmath510 percent to our final observed spectra and refit the model",
    "this had no effect on results concerning f@xmath29 and at most shifted the best - fit pressure level of the cloud top by one level in our model , to 0.12  bar in the @xmath53 case for the bright southern feature and to 0.09  bar in the @xmath54 case for the dimmer northern feature .    while there are numerous small ways in which the model may be inaccurate , for instance if the temperature - pressure curve is not exactly correct for the location of the cloud features , the two major sources of uncertainty in the model are the methane _ k_-coefficients of @xcite and the assumption of a flat reflecting cloud layer . for neptune s atmosphere",
    "we are forced to extrapolate the methane _",
    "k_-coefficients to much colder temperatures than the temperatures of the laboratory measurements on which they are based .",
    "while the accuracy or inaccuracy of this extrapolation is difficult to judge , the independence of best - fit cloud - top pressure and f@xmath29 from methane concentration f@xmath27 gives us confidence in our results .    for ease we assume in our model that the cloud top is a flat reflecting layer , however due to particle scattering properties the reflectivity of the cloud may vary with wavelength and the ` top ' of the cloud is almost certainly somewhat extended .",
    "our best - fit model for the bright southern feature ( see spectrum 1 of fig .",
    "3a ) is systematically slightly off from the observed spectrum .",
    "this is most easily seen at wavelengths shortward of @xmath92.16  @xmath0 m where h@xmath55 absorption dominates .",
    "this is suggestive that while a flat reflecting layer at 0.144  bar does not fit perfectly , a combination of reflectance from pressures slightly higher to slightly lower than 0.144  bar might result in a better fit , which is exactly what one would expect if the cloud - top were somewhat extended .",
    "in fact , a more detailed method of modeling would be to view the computed model spectra for all the pressure levels in the model as a basis set and to construct the best - fit model spectrum from a linear combination of all the spectra from different levels . however , one shortfall to that approach is that it implicitly assumes single scattering , ignoring multiple scattering between layers .",
    "a more complete modeling approach must include the multiple scattering between layers as well , which is beyond the scope of the current paper .",
    "variation in reflectivity as a function of wavelength may also play a role in these slight discrepancies between model and data .",
    "by comparing a near - infrared spectrum with the predictions of a simple transmission model we determined the pressure level at the top of an infrared - bright tropospheric cloud on neptune .",
    "we find a best - fit of model to data for a cloud - top pressure level of 0.14  bar within a maximum allowed range of 0.11 to 0.19  bar for the bright southern feature that we observed .",
    "we found the dimmer northern feature to sit slightly higher in the atmosphere at 0.084  bar within a maximum allowed range of 0.058 to 0.11  bar .",
    "our work places no limit on the pressure at the bottom of the cloud .",
    "our results further restrict the fraction of h@xmath7 in _ ortho / para _ equilibrium to greater than 0.8 , and our best - fits consistently put this fraction at 1.0 .",
    "this is in agreement with the work of @xcite who found the same results , but from a different technique , measuring the equivalent widths of the 4 - 0 s(0 ) and s(1 ) transitions between 0.6 and 0.7  @xmath0 m .",
    "our results do not constrain the fractional abundance of methane in the stratosphere , nor the fractional abundance of helium .",
    "our primary result is the tight constraint we place on the pressure at the top of the cloud . by constraining the cloud - top to pressures around the tropopause ,",
    "we show that the cloud , possibly a storm or upwelling , does not extend significantly into the stratosphere .",
    "if the cloud is made up of condensed methane particles brought up from below , then the mechanism by which this cloud was formed appears to be efficient at bringing methane to near the top of the troposphere , but , at least at the time we observed , the mechanism was not acting as an efficient method of transporting methane to the upper stratospheric levels where ultraviolet photolysis occurs ( p@xmath56  bar ) .    in the current paper",
    "we present a measurement of the altitude of two cloud features at a single time .",
    "we expect longer - term observations of multiple infrared - bright features will find that most reach only to approximately the tropopause , as in the case presented here , but occasional features may reach far into the stratosphere ( p@xmath57  bar ) and thus would provide an extremely efficient method of transporting methane to the upper stratosphere for photolysis .",

    "<S> we present 2.03 - 2.30  @xmath0 m near - infrared spectroscopy of neptune taken 1999 june 2 ( ut ) with the w.m .  </S>",
    "<S> keck observatory s near - infrared spectrometer ( nirspec ) during the commissioning of the instrument . </S>",
    "<S> the spectrum is dominated by a bright cloud feature , possibly a storm or upwelling , in the southern hemisphere at approximately 50@xmath1s latitude . </S>",
    "<S> the spectrum also includes light from a dimmer northern feature at approximately 30@xmath1n latitude . </S>",
    "<S> we compare our spectra ( @xmath22000 ) of these two features with a simple model of neptune s atmosphere . given our model assumption that the clouds are flat reflecting layers , we find that the top of the bright southern cloud feature sat at a pressure level of 0.14  @xmath3  bar , and thus this cloud did not extend into the stratosphere ( p@xmath40.1  bar ) . </S>",
    "<S> a similar analysis of the dimmer northern feature gives a cloud - top pressure of 0.084@xmath50.026 bar . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that the features we observed efficiently transport methane to the base of the stratosphere , but do not directly transport methane to the upper stratosphere ( p@xmath6  bar ) where photolysis occurs . </S>",
    "<S> our observations do not constrain how far these clouds penetrate down into the troposphere . </S>",
    "<S> we find that our model fits to the data restrict the fraction of h@xmath7 in _ ortho / para _ thermodynamic equilibrium to greater than 0.8 . </S>"
