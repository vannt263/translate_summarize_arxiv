    ", the rotation curves together with the egret data can be explained by existence of two rings of dark matter located at distances of about 4 kpc and 14 kpc from the galaxy center ( de boer et al .",
    "such toroidal structures can possess a significant mass , and thus gravitationally affect the matter motion .",
    "b. riemann devoted one of his last works to the gravitational potential of a homogeneous torus ( see collected papers , 1948 ) .",
    "this work remained unfinished however .",
    "for over a century , no attention has been paid to a torus gravitational potential .",
    "kondratyev ( 2003 ) has returned to this problem for the first time . in this work",
    "an exact expression for the potential of a homogeneous torus on the axis of symmetry was obtained . in ( kondratyev 2007 ) the integral expressions for a homogeneous torus potential",
    "were found using a disk as a primordial gravitating element .",
    "stacking up such disks will result in a torus with the potential equal to a sum of potentials of component disks .",
    "however , it is evident that any integral expressions are problematic to use both in analytic studies and in numerical integration of motion equations , and also in solving the problems of gravitational lensing .",
    "b.kondratyev et al .",
    "( 2009 , 2010 ) have obtained an expansion of torus potential in laplace series , but showed , however , that such an expansion is impossible inside some spherical shell .    in this paper",
    "we propose a new approach to investigation of the gravitational potential of a torus .",
    "special attention has been paid to finding approximate expressions for the potential , which would simplify investigation of astrophysical objects with gravitating tori as structural elements .",
    "in contrast to ( kondratyev 2007 ) , we used an infinitely thin ring as a torus component .",
    "such ring is actually a realization of a torus , with its minor radius tending to zero and the major one equaling the ring radius .",
    "using such an approach , we obtained an integral expression for the potential of a homogeneous circular torus ( section 2 ) and approximate expressions for the potential in the outer ( section 3 ) and inner ( section 4 ) regions . in section 5 , the method of determining a torus potential for the entire region is suggested .",

    "expression for the potential of the component ring is then @xmath25 where @xmath13 is determined by expressions ( [ eq_2.5 ] ) , ( [ eq_2.6 ] ) . due to additivity",

    "however , further analysis of this expression for the torus potential ( [ eq_2.8 ] ) allows us to obtain approximations that are physically understandable and enable solving practical astrophysical tasks which need multiple calculations of the gravitational potential of the torus .    for further analysis of the torus potential",
