    "they concluded that the low-@xmath3 component originating from the interstellar medium ( ism ) surrounds the high-@xmath3 component originating from the ejecta .",
    "in addition , they measured the metal abundances of the high-@xmath3 component and showed the metal distribution of the ejecta .",
    "the results indicate that the abundances are relatively high ( @xmath15 times solar ) and each element is nonuniformly distributed : si , s and fe are concentrated in the inner region while the other elements such as o , ne and mg are abundant in the outer region .",

    "the high-@xmath3 ejecta component is surrounded by the low-@xmath3 ism component .",
    "they found that the spectra from most regions of the cygnus loop consist of the two - component vnei model .",
    "thus we also employed two - component vnei model which has two different electron temperatures .",
    "we found that this model can not reach the physically meaningful results by setting all the parameters free .",

    "other parameters were set free such as @xmath3 , @xmath6 , and em . in the high-@xmath3 component , we set all parameters to those of the single-@xmath3 vnei model as explained in the above paragraph . as a result ,",
    "the values of the reduced @xmath12 remain almost unchanged : 6.9 to 6.5 and 3.6 to 3.4 in pos-8 and 9 , respectively .",
    "these large values are due to the fact that we took the spectra summed over the entire fov in which there is a lot of structure .",
    "therefore we divided our fov into several regions for the spectral analysis .",
    "although we employed the constant temperature , plane - parallel shock plasma model , * vpshock * instead of * vnei * , the best - fit parameters were almost unchanged and the values of the reduced @xmath12 were not significantly improved .      from fig .",

    "the value of em@xmath26 gradually decreases from the center to the outer region .",
    "this decrease can be easily explained by assuming that the emission comes from the ejecta component filling inside the cygnus loop .",

    "their main arguments are the difference of the radio morphology and the polarization intensity between the main part of the cygnus loop and the south `` blow - out '' region .",
    "however , based on the x - ray data , we found that there is no evidence of the extra snr within our fov . if these snrs are at the same distance as claimed by uyaniker et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and sun et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , the smaller radius of the extra snr , @xmath17pc ( @xmath19/@xmath10.7@xmath30)(@xmath31/540pc ) , than that of the cygnus loop , @xmath113pc ( @xmath19/@xmath11.4@xmath30)(@xmath31/540pc ) , strongly suggests that the extra snr is younger than the cygnus loop is .",

    "therefore , the temperature of the extra snr should be significantly higher than that of the cygnus loop . however , we found no sign of such high temperature plasma .",
    "the spectra from all regions are almost represented by a single-@xmath0 vnei model ( @xmath10.4kev ) .",
    "if we add an extra component , we found in section  [ sec : specana ] that the extra component shows low temperature rather than high temperature .",
    "furthermore , from fig . [",
    "fig : kte ] , the temperatures of each component are in good agreement with those obtained in other regions of the loop ( tknm07 ; katsuda et al .",
    "this result suggests that the x - ray emission from the sw region mainly comes from the cygnus loop .",
    "if the secondary snr exists in the sw at the same distance , the contribution of the x - ray emission to the spectra is much less than that of the cygnus loop .",

    "then , we can estimate the mass of the progenitor star of the cygnus loop from the ems of the high-@xmath0 component , assuming that all these emissions come from the loop .",

    "the type ia supernova yields more fe than our results but less ne . on the contrary ,",

    "<S> we observed the southwestern region of the cygnus loop in two pointings with _ xmm - newton_. the region observed is called the `` blow - out '' region that is extended further in the south . </S>",
    "<S> the origin of the `` blow - out '' is not well understood while it is suggested that there is another supernova remnant here in radio observation . to investigate the detail structure of this region in x - ray , we divided our fields of view into 33 box regions . </S>",
    "<S> the spectra are well fitted by a two - component nonequilibrium ionization model . </S>",
    "<S> the emission measure distributions of heavy elements decrease from the inner region to the outer region of the loop . </S>",
    "<S> then , we also divided our fields of view into 26 annular sectors to examine the radial plasma structure . </S>",
    "<S> judging from metal abundances obtained , it is consistent with that the x - ray emission is the cygnus loop origin and we concluded that high-@xmath0 component ( @xmath10.4kev ) originates from the ejecta while low-@xmath0 component ( @xmath10.2kev ) is derived from the swept - up interstellar medium . </S>",
    "<S> the flux of low-@xmath0 component is much less than that of high-@xmath0 component , suggesting the ism component is very thin . </S>",
    "<S> also , the relative abundances in the ejecta component shows similar values to those obtained from previous observations of the cygnus loop . </S>",
    "<S> we find no evidence in x - ray that the nature of the `` blow - out '' region originated from the extra supernova remnant . from the ejecta component </S>",
    "<S> , we calculated the masses for various metals and estimated the origin of the cygnus loop as the core - collapse explosion rather than the type ia supernova . </S>"
