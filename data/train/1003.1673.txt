    "the classical capillary instability , the breakup of a cylindrical liquid thread into a series of droplets , is perhaps one of the most ubiquitous fluid instabilities and appears in a host of daily phenomena @xcite from glass - wine tearing @xmath0 , and faucet dripping to ink - jet printing .",
    "the study of capillary instability has a long history . in 1849 ,",
    "plateau attributed the mechanism to surface tension : the breakup process reduces the surface energy @xcite .",
    "lord rayleigh pioneered the application of linear stability analysis to quantitatively characterize the growth rate at the onset of instability , and found that a small disturbance is magnified exponentially with time @xcite .",
    "subsequently , tomotika investigated the effect of viscosity of the surrounding fluid , showing that it acts as a deterrent to slow down the instability growth rate @xcite .",
    "many additional phenomena have been investigated , such as the cascade structure in a drop falling from a faucet @xcite , steady capillary jets of sub - micrometer diameters @xcite , and double - cone neck shapes in nanojets @xcite .",
    "capillary instability also offers a means of controlling and synthesizing diverse morphological configurations .",
    "examples include : a long chain of nanospheres generated from tens - of - nanometer diameter wires at the melt state @xcite ; polymer nanorods formed by annealing polymer nanotubes above the glass transition point @xcite ; and nanoparticle chains encapsulated in nanotubes generated by reduction of nanowires at a sufficiently high temperature @xcite .",
    "moreover , instabilities of fluid jets have numerous chemical and biological applications @xcite .",
    "( an entirely different instability mechanism has attracted recent interest in elastic or visco - elastic media , in which thin sheets under tension form wrinkles driven by elastic instabilities @xcite . )",
    "fiber drawing of cylindrical shells and other microstructured geometries clearly opens up rich new areas for fluid instabilities and other phenomena , and it is necessary to understand these phenomena in order to determine what structures are attainable in drawn fibers . although it is a striking example , the observed azimuthal breakup process appears to be a complicated matter  because surface tension does not produce azimuthal instability in cylinders @xcite or cylindrical shells @xcite , the azimuthal breakup must be driven by the fiber draw - down process and/or by additional physics such as visco - elastic effects or thermal gradients . simulating",
    "the entire draw - down process directly is very challenging , however , because the lengthscales vary by @xmath1 orders of magnitude from the preform ( @xmath2 ) to the drawn layers ( sub-@xmath3 ) .",
    "another potentially important breakup process , one that is amenable to study even in the simplified case of a cylindrical - shell geometry , is axial instability .",
    "not only does the possibility of axial breakup impose some limits on the practical materials for fiber drawing , but understanding such breakup is arguably a prerequisite to understanding the azimuthal breakup process , for two reasons .",
    "first , the azimuthal breakup process produces cylindrical filaments , and it is important to understand why these filaments do not exhibit further breakup into droplets ( or under what circumstances this should occur ) .",
    "second , it is possible that the draw - down process or other effects might couple fluctuations in the axial and azimuthal directions , so understanding the timescales of the axial breakup process is necessary as a first step in evaluating whether it plays any physical role in driving other instabilities .",
    "therefore , as a first step towards understanding the various instability phenomena in drawn microstructured ( cylindrical shell ) fibers , we investigate the impact of a single mechanism : cwhere there is not as yet a linear - theory analysis , between two limits that can be understood by dimensional analysis .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",

    "recent work , however , has generalized optical fiber manufacturing to include microstructured fibers that combine multiple distinct materials including metals , semiconductors , and insulators , which expand fiber - device functionalities while retaining the simplicity of the thermal - drawing fabrication approach .",
    "for example , a periodic cylindrical - shell multilayer structure has been incorporated into a fiber to guide light in a hollow core with significantly reduced loss for the fabrication process has four main steps to create this geometry .",

    "the discussion of the previous section  [ sub : discussion - of - continuous ] suggests a simple geometrical explanation for such a preference , regardless of the details of the breakup mechanism .",
    "the key point is that any instability will have some characteristic wavelength @xmath77 of maximum growth rate for small perturbations , and this @xmath77 must be proportional to the characteristic feature size of the system , in this case the film thickness @xmath146 . as the fiber is drawn , however ,",
    "the thickness @xmath146 and hence @xmath77 decreases .",
    "now , we consider what happens to an unstable perturbation that begins to grow at some wavelength @xmath147 when the thickness is @xmath148 .",
    "if this is a perturbation along the _ axial _ direction , then the fiber - draw process will _ stretch _ this perturbation to a _ longer _ wavelength , that will no longer correspond to the maximum - growth @xmath77 ( which is shrinking ) , and hence the growth will be damped .",

    "perturbation , the draw - down process will _ shrink _ @xmath147 along with the fiber cross - section at exactly the same rate that @xmath146 and @xmath77 shrink .",
    "therefore , azimuthal instabilities are _ not _ suppressed by the draw process .",
    "this simple geometrical argument immediately predicts that the first observed instabilities will be azimuthal ( although axial instabilities may still occur if the draw is sufficiently slow ) .",
    "in this paper , motivated by recent development in microstructured optical fibers , we have explored capillary instability due to radial fluctuations in a new geometry of concentric cylindrical shell by 2d numerical simulation , and applied its theoretical guidance to feature size and materials selections in the microstructured fibers during thermal drawing processes .",
    "our results suggest several directions for future work .",
    "first , it would be desirable to extend the analytical theory of capillary instability in shells , which is currently available for equal viscosity only , to the more general case of unequal viscosities  we have developed a very general theory in an appearing paper @xcite .",
    "second , we plan to extend our computation simulations to include 3d azimuthal fluctuations together with radial fluctuations ; as argued in section  [ sub : azimuthal - preference ] , we anticipate a general geometrical preference for azimuthal breakup over axial breakup once the draw process is included .",
    "third , there are many additional possible experiments that would be interesting to explore different aspects of these phenomena in more detail , such as employing different geometries ( _ e.g. _ , non - cylindrical ) , temperature - time profiles , or materials ( _ e.g. _ , sn  pei or se  pe ) .",

    "<S> recent experimental observations have demonstrated interesting instability phenomenon during thermal drawing of microstructured glass / polymer fibers , and these observations motivate us to examine surface - tension - driven instabilities in concentric cylindrical shells of viscous fluids . in this paper , we focus on a single instability mechanism : classical capillary instabilities in the form of radial fluctuations , solving the full navier  stokes equations numerically . in equal - viscosity cases where an analytical linear theory is available , we compare to the full numerical solution and delineate the regime in which the linear theory is valid . </S>",
    "<S> we also consider unequal - viscosity situations ( similar to experiments ) in which there is no published linear theory , and explain the numerical results with a simple asymptotic analysis . </S>",
    "<S> these results are then applied to experimental thermal drawing systems . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the observed instabilities are consistent with radial - fluctuation analysis , but can not be predicted by radial fluctuations alone  an additional mechanism is required . </S>",
    "<S> we show how radial fluctuations alone , however , can be used to analyze various candidate material systems for thermal drawing , clearly ruling out some possibilities while suggesting others that have not yet been considered in experiments . </S>"
