    "the discrete nonlinear schrdinger equation ( dnlse ) is one of the most investigated systems in dynamical nonlinear lattices .",
    "in particular the dnlse with cubic nonlinearity is an ubiquitous dynamical - lattice system which has been extensively studied because its direct physical applications , such as bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) in deep optical lattices or optical beams in waveguide arrays , among others . in particular , the transport properties of neutral atoms in bec arrays has gained interest in the last few years @xcite due , in principle , to the possible technological applications as matter - wave interferometry @xcite or quantum information processing @xcite .    of course ,",
    "solitary waves are promising candidates for the coherent matter wave transport in bec arrays .",
    "notice that , in the strict sense , solitons ( defined as solitary waves that maintain their shape and amplitude owing to a self - stabilization against diffraction through a nonlinear interaction ) do not exist in the dnlse .",
    "it is because the dnlse is a nonintegrable system .",
    "however , approximate moving solitary - wave solutions can be analytically calculated .",
    "one of the main characteristic of these waves is that they emit radiation when moving , and eventually become pinned by the lattice @xcite .",
    "this is a radiative deceleration which is extremely slow @xcite , and therefore do not play a role in the present analysis .    in the following",
    "we shall use a weak definition of soliton to refer to solitary wave solutions following from approximate integration of the dnlse .",
    "we note that diverse analytical approximations have been developed in the last two decades to obtain moving solitary wave solutions of the dnlse for bright solitons ( the theory of the perturbed ablowitz - ladik equation @xcite , iteration methods @xcite , semi - discrete approximation @xcite , variational approximation @xcite , or an explicit perturbation theory @xcite ) as well as for dark solitons ( quasicontinuum approximation @xcite , or by construction @xcite ) .",
    "of course , the dnlse in the continuum approximation leads to the standard nonlinear schrodinger equation ( nlse ) .",
    "notice , however , that the soliton solutions of the nlse do not move along the lattice , i.e. they behave as breathers in the dnlse system .    in the absence of dissipation and",
    "inhomogeneities @xcite and taking into account that radiative deceleration is very slow @xcite the main effect which reduces the life duration of these solitary waves is the instability of the system .",
    "the instability effect in moving solitons manifests itself as a distortion of exponential - like nature of the envelope during propagation @xcite .",
    "it is a common notion in discrete systems that solitons exist or can be excited in the region of parameters where modulation instability ( mi ) of planewaves appears @xcite .",
    "so , solitons by themselves can be considered as a signature of the mi . moreover , since the mi is a permanent feature of the discrete system , i.e. it does not disappear after the appearance of solitons , it is reasonable to _ conjecture _ that the continuous deformation of moving solitons and breathers after formation is a mi effect .",
    "the usual analytical procedure for studying mi effect on lattices is performing modulation stability analysis of planewaves @xcite . from this analysis",
    "usually qualitative conclusions are derived for solitons .",
    "recently the stability of narrow discrete modes in the dnlse was studied for the case @xmath0 in eq .",
    "( [ dnls1 ] ) @xcite .",
    "since solitons can be considered a signature of the mi effect in discrete systems @xcite , it is natural to conjecture that approximate analytical forms of the soliton solutions may contain already qualitative information of the mi ( e.g. strength and parameter region of existence ) . here",
    ", the mi strength refers to the grade of how during the time evolution the mi effect distorts the initial analytical soliton solution .    in the present study",
    "we are interested in studying anew the the stability of moving solitons in the dnlse with the help of approximate analytical soliton solutions . in order to find these analytical soliton solutions we use a _ self - contained",
    "_ quasicontinuum approximation ( scqca ) .",
    "our aim is to show that these approximate analytical soliton solutions can be used to derive qualitative conclusions of the soliton stability in the range of parameters where the solutions are valid . in this regard",
    "we show that the amplitudes of these soliton solutions define an analytical upper boundary for a `` self - defocusing '' instability not only for bright but also for the dark solitons . here",
    "the term `` self - defocusing '' instability refers to a decaying amplitude in moving solitons which also undergo width broadening .",
    "numerical results supporting the analysis are presented .",
    "the standard modulation stability analysis is also revisited for comparison issues .",
    "we want to comment that it may sound superfluous to propose another method for calculating solitary waves in the dnlse since other powerful methods as , e.g. those propose in refs .",
    "@xcite , have already captured in fine detail interesting aspects of this equation . however ,",
    "in contrast to those methods , the scqca can be straightforwardly extended to two @xcite and three spatial dimensions , where no other analytical methods for moving solitons have been proposed so far .",
    "therefore , understanding the effect of the modulation instability on the solutions presented here is important in order to proceed to higher dimensions .",
    "the dnlse with cubic nonlinearity , which is the basic model for the one - dimensional bec arrays in the tight binding limit @xcite , reads @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a complex amplitude of the bec mean field at the site @xmath3 , @xmath4 is proportional to the tunneling rate @xcite and the nonlinear coefficient @xmath5 , known also as the interaction strength .",

    "these parameters can be manipulated in experiments to obtain different desirable configurations of the system .",
    "in particular the interaction strength @xmath5 can be tuned through the @xmath6-wave scattering length , from positive values ( repulsive interactions ) to negative values ( attractive interactions ) by using either magnetic or laser fields .      in the following we outline the scqca for the dnlse in the spirit of ref .",

    ", the dnlse is a nonintegrable system , i.e. not exact soliton solutions exist",
    ". of course , the solitary solutions derived below are only approximations , since scqca is only an approximate integration of the dnlse .",
    "we note , to the best of our knowledge , that this scqca @xcite has not been applied to the dnlse .",
    "the importance of this method resides in the fact that it can be used without resorting to the knowledge of other nonlinear partial differential equations .",
    "therefore it is self - contained .    in order to proceed with the scqca we consider a travelling wave ansatz for an envelope complex function reading as @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",

    "so , in the present case , it is not appropriate to infer conclusions from one region based on the information of the other region by simply using this transformation .",

    "this dependence was obtained in ref .",
    "so far , the dependence of the soliton amplitudes on the function @xmath47 has not been analyzed in relation with their stability .",
    "it is also good to keep in mind that a single dark soliton , eq .",
    "( [ dark1 ] ) , corresponds to the case where the sites of the bec array are equally filled except in the region where the hole excitation is moving .",
    "however , one can construct pulse solitary waves in the dark region by subtracting two identical dark solitons separated some distance @xmath48 ( see figs .",

    "in this section we first present a conjecture about how to estimate the instability effect on the moving solitons . afterwards , with the help of numerical simulations we compare predictions from the well - known standard modulation stability analysis @xcite and from our conjecture .",

    "however , if one tries to extend this conclusion for solitons , one would wrongly conclude that dark solitons are stable .",
    "this wrong notion would imply that mi effect is negligible in the dark region , which contradicts the fact that approximate dark solitons can be systematically derived .",

    "notice that qualitative predictions from @xmath53 [ eq . ( [ eta1 ] ) ] are identical to the standard modulation analysis in the present case .",
    "now we consider the case of mi effect on solitons in the dark region ( @xmath98 ) , where eq .",
