    "spin - down luminosity @xmath20 erg s@xmath3 ( vs. 0.045 for the crab pwn ) .    first indication on the vela pwn variability was reported by helfand et al .",
    "( 2001 ) who analyzed two images obtained with the _ cxo _  high resolution camera on 2000 january 20 and february 21 .",
    "they noticed a @xmath21 brightening of the outer arc and suggested that it may be connected with the large pulsar glitch of 2000 january 16 ( dodson , mcculloch , & costa 2000 ) . in this letter",
    "we report new results on x - ray variability of the vela pwn obtained with the _ cxo _  advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ; garmire et al .",
    "two acis observations of the vela pulsar and its pwn were carried out on 2000 april 30 and november 30 with exposure times 10,577 s and 18,851 s , respectively . in both observations",
    "the target was imaged on the back - illuminated chip s3 . to image the whole pwn on one chip ,",
    "the pulsar was offset from the acis - s aimpoint by @xmath22 along the chip row . to reduce pile - up",
    ", we used 1/2 subarray , with a frame time of 1.5 s. for the analysis , we used the pipe - line processed level 2 data ( versions 13.2 and 12.1 for the first and second observations , respectively ) and the ciao software , v.2.0 . a detailed analysis of the pwn spectra and morphology will be presented elsewhere ( kargaltsev et al .",
    "herein we concentrate on comparison of the two observations .",
    "to compare the pwn structures , it is particularly important to co - align the images properly . since no x - ray point sources , other than the piled - up pulsar , are detected in the @xmath23 field of view , we have to rely upon the aspect reconstruction which translates the actual event positions on the chip into sky coordinates . for the processing software versions used , the rms aspect offset ( error of celestial location ) is smaller than @xmath24 , although in some cases the offset can be as large as @xmath25 . to estimate the errors in our case ,",
    "we found centroids of radial distributions of pulsar counts , which correspond to @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 , @xmath29 , for the first and second image , respectively . the difference of these positions , @xmath30 , is comparable with our estimated centroiding error , @xmath31 ( about one acis pixel ) .",
    "the images of the central part of the pwn are shown in the upper and lower panels of figure 1 for the first and second observation , respectively .",
    "the white contours in the upper panel enclose pwn regions chosen for the comparison with the second observation .",
    "the regions numbered 1 through 7 enclose well - defined bright features such as the _ outer arc _ ( 2a+2b ) with a brightened _ spot _ ( 1 ) at its apex , _ nw jet _ ( 3 ) , _ inner arc _",
    "( 4a+4b ) , _ se jet _ ( 5 ) , _ ne knot _ ( 6 ) , and _ sw knot _ ( 7 ) .",
    "in addition , to examine the variability in the _ diffuse emission _ , we define regions 8a and 8b .",
    "the white contours in the bottom panel are plotted at the same positions as those in the upper panel .",
    "a visual comparison of surface brightnesses within the white contours immediately shows substantial differences between the two images  e.g. , the sw jet is brighter , the spot is dimmer , and the ne knot is invisible in the second image .",
    "moreover , we see that some elements appear at different locations  the sw knot moved @xmath25 westward , and the outer arc shifted by , on average , @xmath25 north - west from the previous positions .",
    "therefore , we defined new positions of six pwn elements in the second image with blue contours which enclose the same areas as ( and are congruent to ) the corresponding white contours . to quantify the changes in the surface brightness , we measured the numbers of counts per unit area per unit time within the white and blue contours for the first and second observations , respectively ( see fig .",
    "2 ) , and found that the changes are indeed quite significant for some elements  e.g. , @xmath32 for the se jet , @xmath33 for the spot , and @xmath34 for the outer arc ( the uncertainties are @xmath35 statistical errors ) , while they are comparable with statistical fluctuations for the others ( e.g. , for the _ shifted _ inner arc ) . to visualize the spatial distribution of the brightness / morphology change , we scaled the images to the same exposure time ( 10,577 s ) , adaptively smoothed them with ciao task csmooth , and subtracted the first image from the second one . the difference image ( fig .",
    "3 ) clearly shows the displacements of the arcs and the sw knot , brightening of the se jet , and dimming the spot and the ne knot .",
    "it also shows some brightening ( dimming ) of the diffuse emission at the ne ( sw ) outskirts of the pwn and the large displacement , @xmath36 toward sw , and shape variation of the filamentary structure in the upper right corner of the image ( @xmath37 nw from the pulsar ) .    to evaluate systematic errors of the brightness changes",
    ", one should take into account that , although the pulsar was imaged at almost the same location on the chip in the two observations , the pwn regions are imaged on different sites because the roll angles were different ( @xmath38 and @xmath39 ) .",
    "since the ccd quantum efficiency varies over the chip , this may lead to artificial changes of brightness . to examine this effect , we employed two sets of on - orbit calibration exposures ( 28 ks and 35 ks , at dates close to those of our observations ) , during which the acis chips were illuminated by on - board radioactive x - ray sources .",
    "for each of the calibration datasets , we measured the surface brightnesses of eight domains on the chip where four pwn elements ( regions 1 , 2b , 4a and 5 ) were imaged in the first and second observations of the vela pwn .",
    "the differences of the brightnesses of the domains corresponding to the same pwn elements , both in the separate calibration datasets and between the two datasets , are about 2%3% , comparable to the statistical errors .",
    "this puts an upper limit of @xmath40 on both spatial and temporal variability of quantum efficiency within the chip area ( @xmath41 ) where the bright pwn elements were imaged . as an independent test , which additionally accounts for the effect of dither on the exposure times , we constructed exposure maps ( e.g. , davis 2001 ) for the two pwn observations , for an energy of 1 kev close to the maxima of the count rate spectra .",
    "inspection of these maps shows that the effective area varies by about 20% over the whole @xmath23 field - of - view , but these large variations are associated with the boundaries between the four chip nodes . since the pwn elements under investigation are all imaged within the same node 1 , the variations are much smaller , @xmath42 .",
    "thus , the large , @xmath4330% , brightness changes we detected is not an instrumental effect  they characterize real pwn variations .",
    "we have also measured the mean surface brightnesses in the two observations within a @xmath44 radius circle ( centered on the pulsar ) . to take into account the above - mentioned nonuniformity , we divided the original images over the exposure maps and found a change of @xmath45 .",
    "although this difference looks statistically significant , its magnitude is comparable with possible systematic errors ( e.g. , caused by inaccuracy of the monoenergetic exposure maps we used ) .",
    "comparison of the two observations allows one , in principle , to check whether the pulsar luminosity has changed in 7 months .",
    "a change of the luminosity could be caused by the strong glitch of 2000 january 16 because glitch effects can manifest themselves on time scales from weeks to years , depending on the depth where the energy release occurred .",
    "we measured the radial count distribution of the piled - up pulsar image and found that its very central part , within a @xmath46 radius , became brighter by @xmath47 , whereas the brightness did not change at larger radii .",
    "in obvious contradiction with this result , the difference in the pulsar countrates , @xmath48 , estimated from the `` trailed images '' ( one - dimensional images formed during the frame read - outs ) is statistically insignificant . since the trailed images do not suffer from the pile - up , we consider the latter result more reliable .",
    "the apparent variation of the central part of the pulsar image is likely caused by a small fluctuation of observing conditions ( e.g. , focal plane temperature ) , which may lead to a considerable change in the nonlinear regime associated with strong pile - up .",
    "it should also be mentioned that the piled - up images are very asymmetric .",
    "in particular , in both observations we see a `` blob '' of @xmath49 radius at a distance of @xmath50 from the center of the pulsar image ( see fig .",
    "3 ) , at an angle of about @xmath51 from the @xmath52 axis of the spacecraft .",
    "the blob is most likely due to a tilt between the telescope mirrors in the innermost shell ( jerius et al .",
    "it can hardly be seen when there is no pile - up because it is much fainter than the core of the point source image , but it appears quite bright in a strongly piled - up image because the pile - up reduces the core brightness .",
    "in addition to the shifts and brightness changes , we have examined the spectral changes of the pwn elements . to characterize the spectra , we use the hardness ratio @xmath53 , defined as the ratio of counts above and below @xmath54 kev corresponds to the most probable photon energy for a recorded pha . ] .",
    "for the comparative analysis , this empirical quantity is more convenient than spectral fitting parameters because it does not depend on the spectral model , and does not suffer from uncertainties of the detector spectral response .",
    "we see some evidence of hardness changes , up to @xmath55 in the se jet ( see fig .",
    "2 ) , but their statistical significance , @xmath56 , is not as high as that of the brightness changes .",
    "the comparison of the two acis observations taken 7 months apart shows that the vela pwn is by no means static  we have detected considerable brightness changes and/or shifts of some pwn elements , which are likely accompanied by spectral changes . with only two observations carried out , we can not trace these variations to establish their time scales and velocities .",
    "in particular , it is hard to conclude whether the apparent shifts of the arcs and the sw knot are associated with steady motion of matter during the 7 months or are manifestations of wave phenomena , or some instabilities , in the post - shock relativistic plasma .",
    "the fact that the ne knot has disappeared and the other pwn elements have changed their brightness implies that the changes are more complicated than simple motion of plasma inhomegeneities .",
    "the remarkable similarity of the vela and crab pwn morphologies suggests that their variabilities are driven by similar physical processes .",
    "the main distinction between the two pwne is in their sizes and energetics . in particular , the physical size of the vela pwn , @xmath57 pc at @xmath18 pc ,",
    "is an order of magnitude smaller than that of the crab pwn , in rough correspondence with the scaling , @xmath58 , for the shock radius in an ambient medium with a given pressure .",
    "this correspondence indicates that typical pressures , @xmath59 erg  @xmath60 , are of the same order of magnitude , which is in agreement with the close values of their equipartition magnetic fields , @xmath61 g ( kargaltsev et al .",
    "the similarity of physical parameters of the relativistic plasmas in the two pwne suggests that typical velocities of mhd waves , presumably responsible for some of the observed variabilities , are also similar . in a relativistic magnetized plasma",
    "these velocities depend on the mean energy density @xmath62 , magnetization parameter @xmath63 , and the angle @xmath64 between the wavevector and the magnetic field ( e.g. , gedalin 1993 ) . for the conditions expected in the crab and vela pwne",
    ", they vary from very low values , @xmath65 , for the alfven and slow magnetosonic waves at @xmath66 , to @xmath67@xmath68 for the fast magnetosonic wave at @xmath69 .",
    "the fastest speeds observed for the crab pwn wisps , about @xmath70 ( hester 1998 ) , are thus close to the upper end of the expected velocity range .",
    "if plasma perturbations can propagate with similar velocities in the vela pwn , the observable shifts @xmath71@xmath25 can occur in just few days , so that the 7 months between our observations may not be a representative time period to investigate the variations .",
    "the different behavior of the vela pwn elements suggests that various processes are responsible for the pwn variability  e.g. , the apparent motion of the arcs can be caused by wave processes , while the brightness variations of the jets can be associated with large - scale inhomogeneities of the polar outflows .",
    "a variety of mechanisms have been invoked to explain the crab pwn variability  e.g. , formation of mhd shock waves in slightly inhomogeneous wind streams ( lou 1998 ) , instabilities driven by synchrotron cooling in the flow ( hester 1995 ) , nonlinear kelvin - helmholtz instabilities in the equatorial plane of the shocked wind ( begelman 1999 ) , or cyclotron instabilities of ion rings ( spitkovsky & arons 2000 ) . to investigate the actual roles of such processes in the vela pwn",
    ", its behavior should be monitored with _ cxo _  ",
    "other x - ray missions do not have sufficient angular resolution , while observations outside the x - ray band are extremely difficult , if possible at all , because of the pwn faintness in the optical and radio .",
    "moreover , the vela pwn is more suitable for studying brightness and , particularly , spectral variabilities with the _ cxo_acis because it is not as bright as crab , and its acis images do not suffer from pile - up which strongly complicates the data analysis .",
    "thus , future _ cxo",
    "_  observations of the vela pwn will provide the unique opportunity to elucidate the physical properties of the relativistic plasmas in pwne .",
