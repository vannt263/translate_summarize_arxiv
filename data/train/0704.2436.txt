    "spectroscopic observations of solar chromospheric flares show that the line profiles emitted by the flaring plasma almost always exhibit asymmetries or shifts .",
    "these features are surely due to the chromospheric plasma motion and the resulting doppler - shifts effects .",
    "interpretation of the shape of line profiles allows us to understand the nature of plasma flows during solar flares .",
    "plasma flows in the chromosphere are important in the analysis of dynamics and energetics of solar flares as well as these phenomena supply matter to the coronal parts of flares in the process of chromospheric evaporation .",
    "understanding of the mechanisms which generate flows is necessary for complete description of solar flares .",
    "spectral line asymmetries arise only because of the line - of - sight component of plasma velocity which due to the doppler - shift is responsible for the modification of spectral line profiles . therefore , for the flares located on the solar disk center we are able to analyze flows oriented perpendicular to the solar surface . for simplicity , the theoretical analysis of line asymmetries often assume that the emitting region is located on the solar disk center and only vertical flows are present .    unfortunately , the interpretation of the shape of line profiles is not trivial and to determine the velocity field we must use advanced methods based on hydrodynamical and radiative transfer techniques .",
    "there are some rare cases when the interpretation of line asymmetries is relatively simple .",
    "when the flow of the whole flaring region is homogeneous then the shape of the line is not disturbed compared to the static symmetric line profile , but the whole line is just shifted towards longer or shorter wavelengths ( fig .  [ ab - fig : prof ]  left ) .",
    "we can measure this shift and using a simple doppler formula calculate specific value of the line - of - sight velocity .",
    "unfortunately , in most cases the line profiles of solar flares exhibit much more complicated structure ( fig .",
    "[ ab - fig : prof ]  right ) which suggests that the velocity field is not homogeneous and different parts of the flare move in different way .",
    "there are two main approaches to the modeling of chromospheric line asymmetries .",
    "one is based on the hydrodynamics calculations , where the time evolution of the solar flare atmosphere is calculated and the radiative transfer formulae are used to calculate the radiation from this evolving atmosphere .",
    "another approach is based on semiempirical models of solar flares .    in this paper",
    "i will present a short review on observation and interpretation of the chromospheric line asymmetries observed during solar flares .",
    "the term chromospheric lines is commonly used to describe all spectral lines formed in the solar chromosphere , where the temperature is around @xmath0k .",
    "these lines are formed in strong non - lte conditions and complicated radiative transfer calculations are necessary to describe the formation of these lines .",
    "strong chromospheric lines are usually optically thick what means that the optical thickness of the plasma in these lines is very large ( @xmath1 ) .     asymmetric line profiles .",
    "profiles 4 , 5 , and 6 correspond to the flare emission ( @xcite ) .",
    ", width=302 ]    there is a wide literature concerning this topic and i provide the readers some references contained the most important results .",
    "i will concentrate on chromospheric parts of solar flares where the emission comes from cool ( @xmath0k ) plasma .",
    "this emission is produced mostly in strong resonance lines of hydrogen , calcium or magnesium ( h@xmath2 , h@xmath3 , h@xmath4 , caiih , k , etc . ) since the most spectroscopic observations performed during past years concern h@xmath2 line , the interpretation of these results will take considerable part of this review .",
    "asymmetries of chromospheric lines emitted by the flaring plasma have been observed for more than half of the century .",
    "after the solar spectrographs were developed in order to produce the solar spectrum with sufficient spectral resolution , observers noticed that the line profiles emitted during solar flares are not symmetric ( fig .",
    "[ ab - fig : ellison - prof ] ) .",
    "it was clear from the beginning that these kinds of modifications of the spectral lines are due to the mass motion driven during solar flares .",
    "however , the mechanisms which could drive the plasma flows were not known yet at those days .",
    "the first analysis of the line asymmetries were concentrated on statistical description of the behaviour of lines .",
    "@xcite presented a qualitative analysis of 244 h@xmath2 and caiik spectra of 92 flares .",
    "they found that the blue asymmetry ( blue wing enhancement ) occurs mainly in the early phase of flares , before flare maximum .",
    "however , only 23% of flares contain at least one region with blue asymmetry .",
    "80% of flares exhibit the red asymmetry which dominates during and after the maximum of flare .",
    "it is worth to notice that only 5% of flares shows blue asymmetry exclusively .",
    "however , because not all flares were observed from their beginning , the occurrence of blue asymmetry may be missed for many flares . in fig .",
    "[ ab - fig : asymm - evol ] the time evolution of the asymmetry is presented .",
    "similar analysis was performed by @xcite . by inspection of off - band filtergrams of 60 flares obtained in @xmath51 and @xmath52  from the h@xmath2 line center he found that 92% of flares show red asymmetry and only 5% show blue asymmetry .",
    "line profiles as a function of time development of flares ( solid line ) .",
    "dashed curve takes positive and negative signs into account .",
    "time of flare maximum = 0 ( @xcite ) . , width=377 ]    early statistical analysis gave us an qualitative idea about the line asymmetry but the physical interpretation of the shape of line profiles is not considered .",
    "the asymmetric line profile contains an information about the velocity field in the region where the observed line is formed .",
    "therefore , the first problem which needs to be solved is to determine this velocity field using the observed line profile .",
    "secondly , we have to answer the question why do we observe such a flow of plasma , what can generate the flows ?",
    "determination of the velocity from the observed profiles of the chromospheric lines is not a trivial task due to the complicated processes of line formation and complex velocity field in the chromosphere .",
    "strong chromospheric lines are optically thick and the radiation observed at different parts of the line profile comes from different height @xmath6 across the chromosphere ( @xcite ) .",
    "the core of strong chromospheric lines ( hydrogen balmer lines , ca lines ) is formed much higher than the wings of these lines .",
    "therefore , the asymmetry of the specific line depends on the relation between the height @xmath6 of formation of given part of the line profile and the value of the velocity at this height .",
    "this means that if the function describing the velocity across the height in the chromosphere is complicated , the emergent line profile has also very complicated shape .    despite of all difficulties with determining correctly the velocity from the line profile shape , many authors tried to use h@xmath2 , caii and other lines to find the velocity in the flaring chromosphere .",
    "all these determinations were based on the measurements of doppler - shifts of the line cores or , more commonly , on the bisector technique .",
    "using the shift of the line core to obtain the velocity may be misleading and the determined velocity is not correct when the velocity gradient in the chromosphere is significant ( @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , the estimation of the doppler - shift obtained with the bisector technique can also give wrong results .",
    "the doppler - shift of the line profile correspond to the shift of the central point of the bisector connecting the two wings of the spectral line .",
    "since the different parts of the spectral line are formed at different height in the chromosphere , using bisectors connecting the wings observed at different frequency , we can estimate the line - of - sight velocity at different layers of the chromosphere . however , because the radiation of specific frequency within the spectral line does not come from one narrow layer of the chromosphere but rather from geometrically thick region , we can not say that the doppler velocity determined form given bisector correspond to plasma flow at given height in the chromosphere . moreover , if the velocity gradient in the chromosphere is large then the bisector method can not be used because the doppler - shift of any bisector results from a superposition of many shifts due to the motion of plasma with different velocity along line - of - sight . in spite of this",
    "the bisector technique was commonly used for many years until it was replaced by more advanced , complicated but much more precise non - lte radiative transfer techniques with velocity field included .",

    ", width=226 ]    contradictory results were published by @xcite who suggested that during the impulsive phase of solar flares the downflow of the cool chromospheric plasma is present .",
    "these results are based on the large red asymmetry of the h@xmath2 line observed during the impulsive phase of many solar flares ( fig .",
    "[ ab - fig : ichim - prof ] ) .",
    "the downward motion increases at the onset of a flare to its maximum velocity of shortly before the impulsive peak of microwave emission , and rapidly decreases before the h@xmath2 reaches its maximum ( fig .",
    "[ ab - fig : veloc - evol ] ) .",
    "the red asymmetry of the h@xmath2 line may be also explained by the attenuation of the blue wing by the rising plasma over the flare but the authors exclude this case because the optical thickness of a rising cloud is too small to explain the emission deficit of the blue wing of h@xmath2 line .",
    "also the high temporal resolution spectroscopic observations of h@xmath2 line performed by @xcite confirm the existence of red asymmetry during the impulsive phase of solar flares .",

    "the downflow of cool plasma in the form of chromospheric condensations observed during solar flares was predicted theoretically by @xcite .",
    "if a region of the chromosphere heated by non - thermal electrons is thick enough , then the rapid temperature increase produces an enhanced pressure in the heated region .",

    "@xcite suggested that the gentle chromospheric evaporation may also occur after the primary energy release , when the non - thermal electron flux is stopped .",
