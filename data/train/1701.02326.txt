    "the magellanic clouds ( mcs ) are the laboratories for studies in extragalactic h  ii regions at lower metallicities than in the milky way .",
    "deep optical spectra of h  ii regions in these galaxies would allow us to detect and measure relatively faint iron lines and thus , study the properties of dust in ionized nebulae through the analysis of the iron depletion factor . this factor is defined as the ratio between the expected abundance of iron and the one measured in the gas phase .",
    "the study of the dust in ionized nebulae of the mcs will provide clues on the processes responsible for the formation and evolution of the grains and the role played by metallicity in the efficiency of these processes .",
    "rodrguez & rubin ( 2005 ) and delgado - inglada et  al .",
    "( 2011 ) found that ionized nebulae with lower metallicities show lower depletions factors .",
    "we extend the sample for h  ii regions in the mcs in order to better understand this behavior .",
    "we obtained echelle spectra of 8 h  ii regions in the mcs , 4 in the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) and 4 in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) .",
    "the data were taken with the ultraviolet - visual echelle spectrograph ( uves ) in the very large telescope ( vlt ) in chile .",
    "the spectral range covered was from 3100 @xmath0 to 10400 @xmath0 with a spectral resolution of @xmath1 .",
    "the atmospheric dispersion corrector was used to keep the same observed region within the slit since the mcs are observed at relatively high airmass ( between 1.35 and 1.88 ) . the slit position for each object",
    "was chosen to have enough spectral resolution and high signal - to - noise .",
    "+   + the data reduction was performed using the public uves pipeline under the gasgano graphic user interface through the standard procedure of bias and aperture subtraction , flat fielding and wavelength calibration . for flux calibration we used the available tasks in the iraf software package using the standard stars hr718 , hr 3454 and hr9087 . figure  [ n81spec_fig1 ] shows part of the spectrum of n81 where we identify several iron emission lines .",
    "line intensities were measured by integrating the flux above the continuum defined by two points on each side of the emission lines .",
    "flux uncertainties were computed by adding quadratically line fluxes and flux calibration uncertainties .",
    "we finally include the uncertainty associated to the propagation in the reddening coefficient .",
    "the calculations of physical conditions and ionic and total abundances were carried out with pyneb ( luridiana et al .",
    "the uncertainties were obtained through monte carlo simulations .",
    "we determined four diagnostics for electron density using sulfur , oxygen , chlorine and argon lines .",
    "we decided to use the average electron density only from @xmath2([o  ii ] ) and @xmath2([s  ii ] ) diagnostics since @xmath2([cl  iii ] ) and @xmath2([ar  iv ] ) give higher densities owing to they are less sensitive at lower densities .",
    "we computed electron temperature from five different diagnostics : @xmath3([n  ii ] ) , @xmath3([o  ii ] ) , @xmath3([o  iii ] ) , @xmath3([s  iii ] ) and @xmath3([ar  iii ] ) .",
    "we decided to use @xmath3([n  ii ] ) as the representative temperature for the low ionization degree zone because the emission lines used to determine @xmath3([o  ii ] ) are affected by recombination and density variations . for high ionization degree zone we decided to use @xmath3([o  iii ] ) because some of the emission lines used to determine @xmath3([s  iii ] ) are affected by telluric absorption and @xmath3([ar  iii ] ) gives higher uncertainties than @xmath3([o  iii ] ) .",
    "+ once we determined the physical conditions , we computed the ionic abundances for all the available ions assuming the two - zone scheme . for oxygen we added directly o@xmath4/h@xmath4 and o@xmath5/h@xmath4 when he ii lines are not observed ; otherwise we used the ionization corrector factor ( icf ) given by delgado - inglada et al .",
    "( 2014 ) . for nitrogen we used the classical icf , n / o = n@xmath4/o@xmath4 , as suggested by delgado - inglada et al .",
    "( 2015 ) . for iron we used the icfs given by rodrguez & rubin ( 2005 ) .",
    "we used the two icfs they recommend because they give us extreme values of the total iron abundance and can be used to constrain the true values of the fe abundances in the gas . for the rest of elements we used the icfs given by delgado - inglada et al .",
    "the uncertainties due the icfs are not considered .",

    "we plot the total abundance for the other elements with respect to oxygen as a function of the ionization degree .",
    "the s and cl abundances are similar in both clouds within the uncertainties ; the same behavior is seen for the ne abundances . for n abundances it seems to be a separation between the two mcs due to differences in the chemical evolution of each galaxy . for ar abundances there",
    "is a problem with the icf since there is a trend with the ionization degree .",
