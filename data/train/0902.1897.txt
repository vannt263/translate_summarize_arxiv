    "we conclude that the bulk of cosmic hydrogen is ionised at present , yet there must have been a period early in the history of the universe when the bulk of hydrogen was neutral .",
    "this is supported by a range of observational data that provides strong and compelling evidence that the universe underwent an `` epoch of reionisation '' that was complete by @xmath9 , approximately 1 billion years after the big bang ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . during this period",
    "the cosmic abundance of neutral hydrogen declined dramatically , `` re - ionised '' by a background of ionising uv and x - ray radiation whose build - up was very likely linked to the formation of the first generations of stars and galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "understanding the precise nature of the sources of this ionising radiation background remains an important yet largely unsolved problem facing modellers of galaxy formation .",
    "it is important because reionisation is expected to have had a dramatic impact on galaxy formation .",
    "the presence of a photo - ionising background can inhibit the collapse of baryons onto low - mass dark matter haloes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) and suppress radiative cooling and subsequent star formation within dark matter haloes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "reionisation has been invoked to reconcile the apparent disparity between the observed abundance of satellite galaxies in the local group with the abundance inferred from simulations of galaxy halo formation within the favoured cold dark matter framework ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , there is good reason to believe that reionisation was also important in shaping the faint end of the luminosity function ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) , the clustering of galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) , the low - mass end of the hi mass function , and perhaps the spatial distribution of globular clusters ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "however , despite its importance for galaxy formation , reionisation remains a largely unsolved problem because very little is known about the sources of re - ionising radiation .",

    "however , there are many unanswered questions about the nature and origin of these ionising sources , and without direct observations of the galaxy population at @xmath1 any answers we have will be largely speculative .",
    "there are fossil records of galaxy formation in the high redshift universe in our own cosmic backyard . our galaxy and others in the local group have large populations of globular clusters , the bulk of which are metal poor and old ( @xmath11 billion years old ) .",
    "they appear to be relatively simple systems  their stellar populations appear to be generally coeval , forming in one or more bursts , and many aspects of their dynamical evolution have been studied in detail by direct @xmath12-body methods ( see , for example , * ? ? ?",

    ".    this apparent simplicity has led globular clusters to be used increasingly as probes of high redshift galaxy formation because they may , in principle , tell us about the conditions in which galaxy formation proceeded at early times .",
    "for example , the inferred ages of old metal poor globular clusters implies that these systems formed at a time when the universe was undergoing reionisation .",
    "reionisation is expected to quench star formation and therefore globular cluster formation , and so it has been suggested that present - day spatial distribution of metal poor globular clusters around galaxies can be used to measure the redshift of cosmological reionisation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    however , globular clusters themselves may be sources of ionising radiation and they could be potentially important for cosmological reionisation .",
    "@xcite ( hereafter r02 ) has pointed out that massive stars in primordial globular clusters at high redshifts are extremely luminous at uv wavelengths , which means that they could have been effective ionising sources of neutral hydrogen provided the radiation could escape freely from its source ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "globular clusters tend to reside on the outskirts of galaxies at the present epoch and if this was the case at early times then the fraction of emitted ionising uv photons that can escape without being scattered or absorbed would have been significant .",
    "r02 estimated that massive stars in a primordial globular cluster could emit uv photons sufficiently energetic to ionise atomic hydrogen ( @xmath13 ev ) at a rate of @xmath14 s@xmath15 over the first 4 million years ; this is equivalent to a mass of hydrogen of between @xmath16 and @xmath17 , depending on the local recombination rate ( cf .",
    "massive stars in the local universe tend to form with one or more companions , and this was likely to be the case in primordial globular clusters .",
    "massive binaries may evolve into high mass x - ray binaries ( hereafter hmxbs ) once the more massive star collapses to form a compact object , either a neutron star or a black hole .",
    "this compact object accretes material from its companion , either via a stellar wind or roche lobe overflow ( rlof ) , which results in x - ray emission .",
    "the hmxb phase is believed to occur soon after the first compact object is formed and its duration is limited by the main sequence lifetime of the secondary , typically @xmath18 years .",
    "hmxbs in our galaxy are observed to emit strongly in x - rays , with typical luminosities of @xmath19  erg  s@xmath15 , and there is good reason to believe that hmxbs in primordial globular clusters at high redshifts would have been as luminous , if not more so .",
    "this is very interesting because it suggests that massive stars in globular clusters could have been important as sources of both ionising uv radiation and x - rays during the epoch of cosmological radiation .",
    "certainly , primordial globular clusters would have formed an abundance of uv luminous massive stars that would have had a profound impact on cold star - forming gas in their immediate surroundings . however , could primordial globular clusters have formed sufficient numbers of hmxbs to make an interesting contribution to the ionising x - ray background during the epoch of reionisation ? whereas uv photons are readily absorbed by neutral hydrogen , x - rays are much more penetrating ( the photo - ionising absorption cross section of neutral hydrogen decreases with photon energy roughly as @xmath20 ) and can escape into the inter - galactic medium .",
    "in this paper we consider what fraction of massive stars in primordial globular clusters must evolve into hmxbs for these sources to make a significant contribution to the x - ray ionising background .",
    "we address this question using a monte carlo model of a primordial globular cluster of mass @xmath21 .",
    "we assume that all massive stars form in binaries and explore what fraction of these binaries must eventually form hmxbs to be an important source of reionising photons .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows ; in   [ sec : hmxbs ] , we discuss the factors that determine the fraction of massive binaries that survive to evolve into hmxbs ( @xmath22 ) and , provided they survive , their x - ray luminosities . in ",
    "[ sec : model ] and   [ sec : reion ] , we describe our cluster model in some detail and we compute the effective rate at which neutral hydrogen could be ionised by uv photons from main sequence stars and by x - ray photons from hmxbs",
    ". finally , in section  [ sec : discussion ] we discuss the implications of our results for modelling of high redshift galaxy formation and the use of globular clusters as probes of cosmological reionisation .",
    "in the following subsections , we consider the factors that regulate the formation of high mass x - ray binaries (   [ sec : hmxbs ] ) ; we present the details of our globular cluster model and estimate the total x - ray luminosity as a function of time (   [ sec : model ] ) ; and we determine what fraction of this luminosity is available to ionise neutral hydrogen (   [ sec : reion ] ) .",
    "not all massive binaries will evolve to become hmxbs .",
    "if a massive binary is to survive and become a hmxb , then the stars in the binary must not merge during the more massive stars main sequence ( ms ) and post - ms evolution , and the binary must survive the supernova of the more massive star . whether or not a massive binary merges during the ms lifetime of the more massive star",
    "is determined principally by the details of stellar evolution at low metallicities and the initial binary separation . if the binary survives without merging , then the issue of whether or not the binary survives the first supernova depends on a number of factors , including the precise mass of the more massive star , the fraction of mass lost during the supernova and the kick velocity imparted during the supernova .",
    "however , binary evolution in globular clusters at very low metallicities is not particularly well understood .",
    "examples of complicating factors include the fact that lower metallicity stars are expected to retain more of their mass because stellar winds are inefficient at low metallicities ; therefore these stars will be more massive at the end of their main sequence lives and will form black holes rather than neutron stars ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "this is consistent with the expectation that the ratio of black hole to neutron star remnants is much higher at low metallicities ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "also , less mass is lost during the supernova when the remnant is a black hole rather than a neutron star , and black holes may suffer less violent natal kicks .",
    "these arguments suggest that binaries that survive to become hmxbs in primordial globular clusters are more likely to contain black holes , which suggests in turn that they could be more x - ray luminous than typical hmxbs in the local universe , which are dominated by neutron star systems .    to avoid some of the uncertainty surrounding the stellar physics in primordial globular clusters we introduce a survival fraction @xmath22 which indicates the likelihood of an individual binary becoming an hmxb . for each primordial binary , we determine whether or not the binary will remain bound when the more massive star goes supernova by estimating the fraction of mass lost in the supernova explosion ; if the binary remains bound , then it has a probability of @xmath22 that it will evolve into a hmxb .",
    "we find that typically @xmath23 of high - mass binaries become unbound following the supernova of the more massive star , and so at most @xmath2 of the initial binary population will evolve to become hmxbs .",
    "we note that those that survive tend to host black holes rather than neutron stars .",
    "it is the fraction @xmath22 of this remaining @xmath2 of bound binaries which go on to become hmxbs .",
    "this approach allows us to investigate the potential effectiveness of hxmbs as sources of reionising radiation in a robust manner , even if the factors that determine the value of @xmath22 are not well understood , we can speculate on what the most important determinants of @xmath22 are likely to be .",
    "we wish to assess the potential importance of the hmxb population in globular clusters for the x - ray background at high redshifts , and so we require a model of the stellar population in a typical globular cluster .",
    "we use a monte carlo model of a globular cluster of @xmath24 stars and follow the evolution of its population of massive stars over its first 100 million years , through their main sequence lives and into the hmxb phase .",

    "we calculate revised binary parameters ( i.e. semi - major axis and period ) although there are additional factors which complicate matters ( e.g. velocity kick imparted by the supernova ) .",

    "we have argued that ionising radiation from the globular clusters could have been effective in ionising neutral hydrogen surrounding their host galaxy , but this radiation could also damage cold dense gas within the galaxy ( both neutral and molecular ) , thus affecting the star formation rate and potentially suppressing further star formation .",
    "this has particular implications for the use of globular clusters as probes of cosmological reionisation .",
    "the argument is that the spatial distribution of globular clusters around galaxies and in galaxy clusters can be used to measure the epoch of reionisation  the more centrally concentrated the distribution of globular clusters , the earlier the epoch of reionisation . yet",
    "if the star formation efficiency in a galaxy is high , and consequently the rate at which globular clusters form is high , then we might expect feedback from early - forming globular clusters to be extremely damaging for later - forming globular clusters ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    ". this would suppress the star formation and globular cluster formation efficiency .",
    "how could one separate this local effect from the effect of a globally driven period of reionisation ?",
    "this is a question we shall be pursuing in future work .",

    "<S> globular clusters are dense stellar systems that have typical ages of @xmath0 billion years , implying that they formed during the early epochs of galaxy formation at redshifts of @xmath1 </S>",
    "<S> . massive stars in newly formed or primordial globular clusters could have played an important role during the epoch of cosmological reionisation ( @xmath1 ) as sources of energetic , neutral hydrogen ionising uv photons . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate whether or not these stars could have been as important in death as sources of energetic x - ray photons as they were during their main sequence lives . </S>",
    "<S> most massive stars are expected to form in binaries , and an appreciable fraction of these ( as much as @xmath2 ) will evolve into x - ray luminous ( @xmath3 erg / s ) high - mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ) . these sources would have made a contribution to the x - ray background at @xmath1 .    using monte carlo models of a globular cluster , we estimate the total x - ray luminosity of a population of hmxbs . we compare and contrast this with the total uv luminosity of the massive stars during their main sequence lives . for reasonable estimates , we find that the bolometric luminosity of the cluster peaks at @xmath4 erg / s during the first few million years , but declines to @xmath5 erg / s after @xmath6 million years as the most massive stars evolve off the main sequence . from this time </S>",
    "<S> onwards , the total bolometric luminosity is dominated by hmxbs and falls gradually to @xmath7 erg / s after @xmath8 million years . assuming a power - law spectral energy distribution for the hmxbs </S>",
    "<S> , we calculate the effective number of neutral hydrogen ionisations per hmxb and show that hmxbs can be as important as sources of ionising radiation as massive stars . </S>",
    "<S> finally we discuss the implications of our results for modelling galaxy formation at high redshift and the prospects of using globular clusters as probes of reionisation .    </S>",
