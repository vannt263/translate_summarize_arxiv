    "basic properties of nuclear ground states , excitation energies of giant monopole resonances , the structure of neutron stars , the dynamics of heavy - ion collisions and of supernovae explosions , depend on the nuclear matter compressibility . the nuclear matter compression modulus @xmath3 is defined as @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the binding energy per nucleon , @xmath6 is the fermi momentum , and @xmath7 is the equilibrium fermi momentum .",
    "the value of @xmath3 can not be measured directly . in principle",
    "it can be extracted from the experimental energies of isoscalar monopole vibrations ( giant monopole resonances gmr ) in nuclei .",
    "semi - empirical macroscopic leptodermous expansions , as well as microscopic calculations , have been employed in the analysis of available data on isoscalar gmr .",
    "although macroscopic expansions , analogous to the liquid drop mass formula , in principle provide `` model independent '' estimates of @xmath3 , in reality they do not constrain its value to better than 50% .    a more reliable approach to the determination of @xmath3 is based on microscopic calculations of gmr excitation energies .",
    "self - consistent mean - field calculations of nuclear ground state properties are performed by using effective interactions with different values of @xmath3 .",
    "interactions that differ in their prediction of the nuclear matter compressibility , but otherwise reproduce experimental data on ground - state properties reasonably well , are then used to calculate gmr in the random phase approximation or the time - dependent framework .",
    "a fully self - consistent calculation of both ground - state properties and gmr excitation energies restricts the range of possible values for @xmath3 .",
    "the correct value of @xmath3 should then be given by that interaction which reproduces the excitation energies of gmr in finite nuclei .",
    "it has been pointed out , however , that , since @xmath3 determines bulk properties of nuclei and , on the other hand , the gmr excitation energies depend also on the surface compressibility , the determination of the nuclear matter compressibility relies more on a good measurement and microscopic calculations of gmr in a single heavy nucleus such as @xmath0pb , rather than on the systematics over the whole periodic table  @xcite .",
    "it has also been emphasized that the determination of a static quantity , @xmath3 , from dynamical properties , i.e. from gmr energies , is potentially ambiguous .",
    "various dynamical effects , as for instance the coupling of single particle and collective degrees of freedom , could modify , though not much , the deduced value of the nuclear matter compression modulus . on the other hand , it has been shown that @xmath3 can not be extracted from static properties , i.e. masses and charge distributions , alone  @xcite .    in this work",
    "we address a different source of ambiguity , which has become apparent only recently .",
    "modern non - relativistic hartree - fock plus random phase approximation ( rpa ) calculations , using both skyrme and gogny effective interactions , indicate that the value of @xmath3 should be in the range 210 - 220 mev  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite it has been shown that even generalized skyrme forces , with both density- and momentum - dependent terms , can only reproduce the measured breathing mode energies for values of @xmath3 in the interval @xmath8 mev .",

    "et al_.  @xcite , has put the value of @xmath3 at @xmath13 mev  @xcite . in relativistic mean - field ( rmf ) models on the other hand , results of both time - dependent and rpa calculations suggest that empirical gmr energies are best reproduced by an effective force with @xmath1 mev  @xcite",
    ". twenty percent , of course , represents a rather large difference .",
    "the origin of this discrepancy is at present not understood .",
    "it appears , however , that not all results of the relativistic models are in agreement either . by using the same type of non - linear rmf lagrangians with scalar self - interactions as in refs .",
    "@xcite , in a series of recent papers @xcite piekarewicz has performed fully consistent relativistic rpa calculations of nuclear compressional modes . basically the results can be summarized as follows .",
    "( 1 ) the best description of both compressional modes  isoscalar monopole and dipole  is obtained by using a  soft \" effective interaction with @xmath14 mev .",
    "( 2 ) effective interactions with compression moduli well above @xmath15 mev are not consistent with experimental data . ( 3 ) the compression modulus determined from the empirical excitation energies of the gmr depends on the nuclear matter symmetry energy , i.e. models with a lower symmetry energy at saturation density reproduce the gmr in @xmath0pb by using a lower value of @xmath3 .",
    "( 4 ) the variance between the values of @xmath3 determined from non - relativistic and relativistic mean - field plus rpa calculations of gmr excitation energies can be attributed in part to the differences in the nuclear matter symmetry energy predicted by non - relativistic and relativistic models . in particular , in ref .",
    "@xcite it has been pointed out that , when the symmetry energy of the rmf models is softened to simulate the symmetry energy of skyrme interactions , a lower value of @xmath3 , consistent with the ones used in non - relativistic models , is required to reproduce the energy of the gmr in @xmath0pb .",
    "our own results strongly disagree with most of the conclusions of refs .",
    "in addition to the results obtained in the rmf+rpa framework based on non - linear lagrangians with scalar self - interactions @xcite , in ref .",
    "@xcite we have carried out calculations of the isoscalar monopole , isovector dipole and isoscalar quadrupole response of @xmath0pb , in the fully self - consistent relativistic rpa framework based on effective interactions with a phenomenological density dependence adjusted to nuclear matter and ground - state properties of spherical nuclei .",
    "the analysis of the isoscalar monopole response with density dependent coupling constants has shown that only interactions with the nuclear matter compression modulus in the range @xmath16 mev , reproduce the experimental excitation energy of the gmr in @xmath0pb .",
    "in addition , the comparison with the experimental excitation energy of the isovector dipole resonance has constrained the volume asymmetry to the interval 34 mev @xmath17 36 mev .    even though we can not explain the difference between the nuclear matter compressibility predicted by non - relativistic and relativistic mean - field plus rpa calculations , at least we can clarify the apparent inconsistency of the results obtained in the relativistic framework .",
    "the purpose of this work is twofold . by using the rmf+rpa based on effective interactions with density - dependent meson - nucleon couplings",
    ", we will show : ( 1 ) contrary to the claims made in ref .",
    "@xcite , our knowledge of the symmetry energy at low density is not that poor , and the volume asymmetry can not be lowered to the range of values @xmath18 mev , for which relativistic models with @xmath19 mev would reproduce the excitation energy of the gmr in @xmath0pb and , ( 2 ) relativistic mean - field effective interactions adjusted to reproduce ground - state properties of spherical nuclei ( binding energies , charge radii , differences between neutron and proton radii ) , can not reproduce the excitation energies of gmr if @xmath20 mev .",
    "therefore , we will reinforce our result that @xmath21 mev is the lower bound for the nuclear matter compression modulus in nuclear structure models based on the relativistic mean - field approximation .",
    "the relativistic random phase approximation ( rrpa ) will be used to calculate the isoscalar monopole and isovector dipole strength distributions in @xmath0pb .",
    "the rrpa represents the small amplitude limit of the time - dependent relativistic mean - field theory .",
    "a self - consistent calculations ensures that the same correlations which define the ground - state properties , also determine the behavior of small deviations from the equilibrium .",
    "the same effective lagrangian generates the dirac - hartree single - particle spectrum and the residual particle - hole interaction . in ref .",
    "@xcite it has been shown that an rrpa calculation , consistent with the mean - field model in the @xmath22 approximation , necessitates configuration spaces that include both particle - hole pairs and pairs formed from occupied states and negative - energy states .",
    "the contributions from configurations built from occupied positive - energy states and negative - energy states are essential for current conservation and the decoupling of the spurious state .",
    "in addition , configurations which include negative - energy states give an important contribution to the collectivity of excited states .",
    "in two recent studies  @xcite we have shown that a fully consistent inclusion of the dirac sea of negative energy states in the rrpa is crucial for a quantitative comparison with the experimental excitation energies of isoscalar giant resonances .",
    "the second requisite for a successful application of the rrpa in the description of dynamical properties of nuclei is the use of effective lagrangians with non - linear meson self - interactions , or lagrangians characterized by density - dependent meson - nucleon vertex functions .",
    "even though several rrpa implementations have been available for almost twenty years , techniques which enable the inclusion of non - linear meson interaction terms in the rrpa have been developed only recently @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite the rrpa matrix equations have been derived for an effective lagrangian with density - dependent meson - nucleon couplings .    already in ref .",
    "@xcite we used lagrangians with non - linear meson self - interactions in time - dependent rmf calculations of monopole oscillations of spherical nuclei .",
    "the energies of the gmr were determined from the fourier power spectra of the time - dependent isoscalar monopole moments @xmath23 .",
    "it has been shown that the gmr in heavy nuclei , as well as the empirical excitation energy curve @xmath24 mev , are best reproduced by an effective force with @xmath1 mev .",
    "this result has been confirmed by the rrpa calculation of ref .",
    "in particular , the best results have been obtained with the nl3 effective interaction  @xcite ( @xmath25 mev ) .",
    "many calculations of ground - state properties and excited states , performed by different groups , have shown that nl3 is the best non - linear relativistic effective interaction so far , both for nuclei at and away from the line of @xmath26-stability .",
    "on the other hand , by using the same type of effective lagrangians with non - linear isoscalar - scalar interaction terms , in the recent rrpa analysis of nuclear compressional modes of refs .  @xcite it has been suggested that models of nuclear structure having @xmath3 well above @xmath27 mev are likely to be in conflict with experiment .",
    "even though models with isoscalar - scalar meson self - interactions have been used in most applications of rmf to nuclear structure in the last fifteen years , they present well known limitations . in the isovector channel , for instance , these interactions are characterized by large values of the symmetry energy at saturation ",
    "37.9 mev for nl3  as compared with the empirical value @xmath28 mev .",
    "this is because the isovector channel of these effective forces is parameterized by a single constant : the @xmath29-meson nucleon coupling @xmath30 . with a single parameter in the isovector channel ,",
    "it is not possible to reproduce simultaneously the empirical value of @xmath31 and the masses of @xmath32 nuclei . on the other hand , extensions of the rmf model that include additional interaction terms in the isoscalar and/or",
    "the isovector channels were not very successful , at least in nuclear structure applications .",
    "the reason is that the empirical data set of bulk and single - particle properties of finite nuclei can only constrain six or seven parameters in the general expansion of an effective lagrangian  @xcite . adding more interaction terms does not improve the description of finite nuclei .",
    "rather , their coupling parameters and even their forms can not be accurately determined .",
    "models based on an effective hadron field theory with medium dependent meson - nucleon vertices  @xcite present a very successful alternative to the use of nonlinear self - interactions .",
    "such an approach retains the basic structure of the relativistic mean - field framework , but could be more directly related to the underlying microscopic description of nuclear interactions . in ref .",
    "@xcite we have extended the relativistic hartree - bogoliubov ( rhb ) model  @xcite to include density dependent meson - nucleon couplings .",
    "the effective lagrangian is characterized by a phenomenological density dependence of the @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath29 meson - nucleon vertex functions , adjusted to properties of nuclear matter and finite nuclei .",
    "it has been shown that , in comparison with standard rmf effective interactions with nonlinear meson - exchange terms , the density - dependent meson - nucleon couplings significantly improve the description of symmetric and asymmetric nuclear matter , and of ground - state properties of @xmath35 nuclei .",
    "the rrpa with density - dependent meson - nucleon couplings has been derived in ref .",
    "just as in the static case the single - nucleon dirac equation includes the additional rearrangement self - energies that result from the variation of the vertex functionals with respect to the nucleon field operators , the explicit density dependence of the meson - nucleon couplings introduces rearrangement terms in the residual two - body interaction .",
    "their contribution is essential for a quantitative description of excited states . by constructing families of interactions with",
    "some given characteristic ( compressibility , symmetry energy , effective mass ) , it has been shown how the comparison of the rrpa results on multipole giant resonances with experimental data , can be used to constrain the parameters that characterize the isoscalar and isovector channel of the density - dependent effective interactions .",
    "in particular , the gmr in @xmath0pb requires the compression modulus to be in the range @xmath16 mev , and the isovector gdr in @xmath0pb is only reproduced with the volume asymmetry in the interval 34 mev @xmath2 36 mev .",
    "we have not , however , analyzed the influence of the symmetry energy on the range of allowed values of @xmath3 .",
    "we have also not tried to correlate the rrpa results for the isovector gdr with data on neutron radii , although it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that rhb calculations with the density - dependent effective interaction dd - me1 ( @xmath36 mev ) reproduce the available data on differences between neutron and proton radii for @xmath0pb and several sn isotopes .",
    "by performing fully consistent rmf plus rrpa calculations of nuclear ground - state properties and excitation energies of giant resonances , in this section we will try to correlate the nuclear matter symmetry energy and the nuclear matter compression modulus of relativistic mean - field effective interactions .    in ref .",
    "@xcite piekarewicz has used the standard rmf effective interactions with isoscalar - scalar meson self - interactions , and with compression moduli in the range @xmath37 mev , to compute the distribution of isoscalar monopole strength in @xmath0pb .",
    "the main result of his analysis is that , when the symmetry energy is artificially softened , in an attempt to simulate the symmetry energy of skyrme interactions , a lower value for the compression modulus is obtained , consistent with the predictions of non - relativistic hartree - fock plus rpa calculations .",
    "as we have already emphasized in the previous section , the rmf models with isoscalar - scalar meson self - interactions are characterized by large values of the symmetry energy at saturation volume asymmetry .",
    "when adjusting such an effective interaction to properties of nuclear matter and bulk ground - state properties of finite nuclei ( binding energy , charge radius ) it would be clearly desirable to bring down the value of @xmath31 to its empirical value @xmath28 mev .",
    "this , however , is not feasible .",
    "the simple reason is that , if @xmath31 is brought below @xmath38 mev by simply reducing the single coupling constant @xmath30 in the isovector channel , then it is no longer possible to reproduce the relative positions of the neutron and proton fermi levels in finite nuclei , i.e. the calculated masses of @xmath32 nuclei display large deviations from the experimental values .",
    "the binding energies are only reproduced if a density dependence is included in the @xmath29-meson coupling , or a non - linear @xmath29-meson self - interaction is included in the model .",
    "if the interaction , however , is adjusted to a single nucleus , as it was done in ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath0pb , then even the standard rmf interactions contain enough parameters to obtain almost any combination of symmetry energy and nuclear matter compressibility .    in the present analysis",
    "we have used effective interactions with density - dependent meson - nucleon vertex functions . for the density dependence of the meson - nucleon couplings we adopt the functionals used in refs.@xcite .",
    "the coupling of the @xmath33-meson and @xmath34-meson to the nucleon field reads @xmath39 where @xmath40 is a function of @xmath41 , and @xmath42 denotes the baryon density at saturation in symmetric nuclear matter .",
    "the eight real parameters in ( [ func ] ) are not independent .",
    "the five constraints @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 , reduce the number of independent parameters to three .",
    "three additional parameters in the isoscalar channel are : @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 - the mass of the phenomenological sigma - meson .",
    "for the @xmath29-meson coupling the functional form of the density dependence is suggested by dirac - brueckner calculations of asymmetric nuclear matter  @xcite @xmath49\\;. \\label{grho}\\ ] ] the isovector channel is parameterized by @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "usually the free values are used for the masses of the @xmath34 and @xmath29 mesons : @xmath52 mev and @xmath53 mev . in principle",
    "one could also consider the density dependence of the meson masses .",
    "however , since the effective meson - nucleon coupling in nuclear matter is determined by the ratio @xmath54 , the choice of a phenomenological density dependence of the couplings makes an explicit density dependence of the masses redundant .    obviously , the framework of density - dependent interactions is more general than the standard rmf models , and it encloses models with non - linear meson self - interactions in the isoscalar - scalar , isoscalar - vector , and isovector - vector channels .",
    "the eight independent parameters , seven coupling parameters and the mass of the @xmath33-meson , are adjusted to reproduce the properties of symmetric and asymmetric nuclear matter , binding energies and charge radii of spherical nuclei . for the open - shell nuclei pairing correlations",
    "are treated in the bcs approximation with empirical pairing gaps ( five - point formula ) .",
    "in order to investigate possible correlations between the nuclear matter symmetry energy and the compression modulus , we have constructed three families of interactions , with @xmath55 230 , 250 , and 270 mev , respectively . for each value of @xmath3",
    "we have adjusted five interactions with @xmath56 30 , 32 , 34 , 36 and 38 mev , respectively .",
    "these interactions have been fitted to properties of nuclear matter ( the binding energy @xmath57 mev ( 5% ) , the saturation density @xmath58 @xmath59 ( 5% ) , the compression modulus @xmath3 ( 0.1% ) , and the volume asymmetry @xmath31 ( 0.1% ) ) , and to the binding energies ( 0.1% ) and charge radii ( 0.2% ) of ten spherical nuclei : @xmath60o , @xmath61ca , @xmath10zr , @xmath62sn , and @xmath63pb , as well as to the differences between neutron and proton radii ( 10% ) for the nuclei @xmath11sn , @xmath64sn and @xmath0pb .",
    "the values in parentheses correspond to the error bars used in the fitting procedure .",
    "note that , in order to fix an interaction with particular values of @xmath3 and @xmath31 , a very small error bar of only 0.1% is used for these two quantities . for each family of interactions with a given @xmath3 and for each @xmath31 , in fig .",

    "it should be emphasized that , by using the standard rmf models with only isoscalar - scalar meson self - interactions , it is simply not possible to construct a set of interactions with this span of values of @xmath3 and @xmath31 and the same quality of deviations of masses and charge radii from experimental values .",

    "in finite nuclei , among other quantities , the symmetry energy directly determines the differences between the neutron and the proton radii . in a recent study of neutron radii in non - relativistic and covariant mean - field models  @xcite ,",
    "the linear correlation between the neutron skin and the symmetry energy has been analyzed .",
    "in particular , the analysis has shown that there is a very strong linear correlation between the neutron skin thickness in @xmath0pb and the individual parameters that determine the symmetry energy @xmath69 : @xmath31 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "the empirical value of @xmath70 in @xmath0pb ( @xmath71 fm from proton scattering data  @xcite , and @xmath72 fm from the alpha scattering excitation of the isovector giant dipole resonance  @xcite ) places the following constraints on the values of the parameters of the symmetry energy : @xmath73 mev , 2 mev/@xmath74 4 mev/@xmath75 , and @xmath76 mev @xmath77 mev .",
