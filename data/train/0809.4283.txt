    "the search for the higgs boson is of highest priority in the experimental programs at the tevatron and the lhc .",
    "a large effort is thus made to obtain precise theoretical predictions for the corresponding production cross sections . at hadron",
    "colliders the dominant production channel is the gluon fusion process through a top - quark loop .",
    "the total cross section has been calculated in the heavy top - quark limit up to next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) in qcd @xcite , and fully differential predictions are available at the same order for the decays of the higgs boson into two photons @xcite and four leptons @xcite .",
    "the exact dependence of the total cross section on the top - quark and higgs - boson masses is known at nlo @xcite .",
    "the perturbative corrections to the total cross section turn out to be surprisingly large : for a light higgs boson , the nnlo @xmath8-factor is around 2 , and a scale uncertainty of @xmath9 remains even at this order .",
    "the theoretical prediction has been refined using soft - gluon resummation , which has been implemented at nnll order @xcite and recently even at the n@xmath0ll level @xcite .",
    "the soft - gluon resummation reduces the scale dependence , but the large @xmath8-factor remains almost unchanged .",
    "indeed , it is not obvious why the cross section should be dominated by soft - gluon radiation : given the large center - of - mass energy of the lhc , there is plenty of phase space available for hard radiation .",
    "in a recent paper @xcite , we have shown that the large @xmath8-factor is mostly due to terms of the form @xmath1 in the perturbative series , which arise in the analytic continuation of ( double ) logarithmic terms in the gluon form factor from space - like to time - like kinematics , @xmath10 .",
    "being related to sudakov logarithms , these `` @xmath11-enhanced '' contributions can be resummed @xcite .",
    "effective field - theory methods provide a particularly simple framework for performing this resummation by implementing matching calculations at time - like momentum transfer and extending renormalization - group ( rg ) evolution into the complex momentum plane @xcite . at first sight",
    "it might appear unsystematic to resum @xmath11-enhanced perturbative corrections , which can not be separated from other numerical coefficients ( including @xmath11 terms not associated with analytic continuation ) in a parametric way .",
    "however , in our rg framework this resummation simply corresponds to the proper choice of a particular matching scale and as such is unambiguous and physically motivated .",
    "the final result for the rg - improved cross section follows straightforwardly by applying the usual rules of effective field theory at every matching step .",
    "our approach to the resummation of @xmath11-enhanced corrections is similar in spirit to the analysis of the @xmath5 cross section using a running coupling evaluated at time - like momentum transfer discussed a long time ago in @xcite , and to the `` contour - improved perturbation theory '' introduced in the analysis of hadronic @xmath12 decays in @xcite .",
    "it can be viewed as an extension of these methods to problems with sudakov double logarithms .    in the present paper ,",
    "we resum both threshold logarithms from soft - gluon emission and the @xmath11-enhanced terms using the momentum - space formalism developed in @xcite .",
    "our result is based on the factorization of the cross section near threshold into a hard and a soft function .",
    "the resummation is achieved by solving the rg equations for the different parts .",
    "in contrast to the standard treatment in mellin space , this approach yields simple analytic results for the resummed hard - scattering kernels in momentum space and is free of landau - pole ambiguities . with a phenomenological analysis",
    "we investigate to what extent the partonic threshold is enhanced due to the fall - off of the parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) .",
    "we find that at lhc energies and for the relevant values of the higgs - boson mass the scale of the soft emission is not much lower than @xmath13 , so that no numerically large logarithms arise from soft emissions .",
    "the main numerical effect of rg improvement is thus due to the resummation of the @xmath1 terms in the virtual corrections . in our rg framework , this resummation is accomplished by evaluating the hard matching corrections at a scale @xmath14 instead of the conventional choice @xmath15 .",
    "we begin our analysis with a brief review of the fixed - order results for the total cross section and study to which extent the cross section is dominated by the leading singular terms near the partonic threshold .",
    "we then discuss the factorization properties of the hard - scattering kernels in the threshold region and derive the formulas for the rg resummation of large perturbative corrections in momentum space . after determining the default values of the matching scales , we present a detailed phenomenological analysis and make predictions for the higgs - boson production cross sections at the tevatron and the lhc .",
    "compared with previous studies , we find significantly faster convergence and improved stability of the perturbative expansion .",
    "we finally comment on applications of rg - improved perturbation theory to other time - like processes , such as drell - yan production , the @xmath16 cross section , and the total hadronic higgs - boson decay rate .",
    "in particular , we explain why the latter two processes do not contain @xmath11-enhanced corrections of the type present in drell - yan or higgs - boson production .",
    "we consider the production of a higgs boson in hadron - hadron collisions at center - of - mass energy @xmath17 .",
    "the total cross section can be written as @xmath18 where @xmath19 , @xmath20 are the effective parton luminosities , and @xmath21 are hard - scattering kernels , which are known to nnlo in perturbation theory @xcite . the quantity @xmath22\\ ] ] with @xmath23 and @xmath24 \\displaystyle      - \\frac14 \\left [ \\ln\\frac{1+\\sqrt{1-x_q}}{1-\\sqrt{1-x_q } }      - i\\pi   \\right]^2 \\ , ; \\quad x_q<1      \\end{cases}\\ ] ] denotes the born - level cross section in units of the gluon - gluon luminosity @xmath25 .",
    "the function @xmath26 results from a quark loop connecting two gluons with the higgs boson .",
    "it approaches 1 for @xmath27 and vanishes proportional to @xmath28 for @xmath29 .",
    "it follows that higgs - boson production is predominantly mediated by a top - quark loop , while the contributions from lighter fermions are strongly suppressed .",
    "we include radiative corrections in the heavy top - quark limit , i.e. , we will only keep logarithmic top - mass dependence in the hard - scattering kernels @xmath30 . for not too heavy higgs - boson masses",
    "the terms suppressed by powers of the top - quark mass are numerically very small . leaving them out",
    "greatly simplifies the calculation , since one can then use an effective lagrangian obtained after integrating out the top quark .    because they are suppressed by @xmath28 ,",
    "the only numerically relevant correction due to lighter fermions is the bottom - quark loop contribution .",
    "its main effect is due to its interference with the top - quark loop , which is well approximated by writing @xmath31 with @xmath32 while using the pole mass is appropriate for the top quark , the virtual @xmath33-quarks in higgs - boson production are far off their mass shell , and one should thus use the @xmath34 quark mass at the higgs mass scale when evaluating the bottom - quark contribution . at @xmath4gev",
    "we take @xmath35gev , and the presence of the bottom - quark loop term in ( [ sigmazero ] ) reduces the cross section by @xmath36 . for comparison ,",
    "the above approximate treatment would yield @xmath37 .",
    "since the @xmath33-quark contribution scales like @xmath38 , it becomes smaller for higher higgs - boson masses .    to validate these approximations",
    "numerically we have used the computer code @xcite , which includes the exact quark - mass dependence at nlo @xcite . for the range @xmath39",
    "we find that the full nlo fixed - order result is about 1% lower than what is obtained with the above born - level treatment of finite top - mass effects .",
    "the difference is negligible compared to other uncertainties .",
    "also , using the same code we find that the inclusion of the @xmath33-quark loop decreases the nlo cross section by about @xmath40 at @xmath41 and about @xmath42 at @xmath43 , in good agreement with the approximate lowest - order treatment described above .",

    "since the cut only excludes hard radiation , the threshold region should not be affected by it . at first sight , these large corrections from hard radiation seem difficult to reconcile with our finding that roughly 90% of the nlo and nnlo total cross sections arise from the partonic threshold terms .    more formally , for a given value of @xmath72 we have @xmath338 , which shows that the radiation from the threshold region @xmath46 has small @xmath339 .",

    "it is difficult to draw any conclusions from the above discussion , other than the trivial statement that also processes involving hard radiation can receive large higher - order corrections . to understand whether there is a physics reason for the observed reduction of the @xmath8-factors in the presence of a jet veto , it would be interesting to analyze higgs production in association with a high-@xmath339 jet in the effective theory .",
    "this process is mediated by operators involving additional collinear fields for the partons inside the jet .",

    "the effects of choosing @xmath2 are small unless the characteristic momentum scale is quite low .      near the partonic threshold , the drell - yan cross section factors into a hard and a soft function , and threshold resummation proceeds in complete analogy to the higgs case @xcite . instead of the scalar two - gluon operator ( [ heff ] ) , drell - yan production",
