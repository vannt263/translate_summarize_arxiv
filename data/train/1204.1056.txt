    "jupiter and saturn analogs orbiting other sun - like main - sequence stars have evaded direct detection . with an effective temperature of @xmath9 , an extrasolar analogue of jupiter",
    "is fainter than a sun - like host by @xmath10 in near - ir @xcite , beyond the reach of instrument capabilities at present and in the near future .",
    "while `` hot jupiters '' ( jovian planets at @xmath11 ) have high temperatures and thus large planet / star flux ratios , they are too close to their hosts ( @xmath12 ) to be spatially resolved by @xmath13m - class telescopes . to date ,",
    "direct - imaging surveys have focused on searching for long - period massive gas giants around nearby young stars with ages @xmath14 , a strategy that has led to a number of discoveries ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in these systems , the planets are still `` hot ''  cooling down from presumably high temperatures at birth , which significantly enhances their flux ratios with host stars .    in this letter , we discuss the possibility of directly imaging a third class of `` hot '' gas giants ( besides close - in hot jupiters and young jupiters around young stars ) , consisting of a population of long - period , very luminous , tidally - powered planets undergoing orbital migration .",
    "it is commonly believed that progenitors of hot jupiters are formed with semi - major axis @xmath15 beyond the `` snow line '' at a few @xmath16 and then migrate inward to their current locations by shrinking @xmath15 by factor of @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "one class of proposed migration mechanisms involve exciting long - period jupiters to highly eccentric orbits , due to gravitational interactions with stellar or planetary perturbers , enabling them to lose orbital energy at successive close periastron passages through tidal interactions with their host stars .",
    "such `` high-@xmath2 '' mechanisms include kozai - lidov cycles plus tidal friction ( kctf ) ( @xcite ) , planet - planet scatter @xcite , `` secular chaos '' @xcite etc .",
    "recently high-@xmath2 mechanisms have gained observational support .",
    "a significant fraction of hot jupiters are found to be on misaligned orbits with respect to their host stars spin axes @xcite , which is a natural consequence of such mechanisms @xcite .",
    "one general expectation from all high-@xmath2 mechanisms is that there should exist a steady - state migrating population of long - period , highly eccentric gas giants `` feeding '' the hot jupiters @xcite .",
    "this results from the continuous generation of hot - jupiter progenitors due to constant formation of stars and their planetary systems over the age of the galaxy .",
    "the orbital angular momentum is approximately conserved during tidal dissipation , so the actively migrating jupiters have @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the semi - major axis of their final circularized orbit . according to @xcite , the frequency of this population is likely an increasing function of their period ( and the eccentricity ) , extending to that of their `` source '' ( possibly at @xmath20 ) .",
    "a possible archetype of the migrating population is hd 80606b @xcite , which is a @xmath21 planet at semi - major axis @xmath22 and @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) , accompanied by an solar - mass companion at @xmath25 .",
    "regardless of the specifics of the high-@xmath2 mechanisms , a gas giant that migrates from semi - major axis @xmath26 to @xmath15 over a time @xmath27 loses orbital energy due to tidal dissipation , which is converted to heat and radiated away .",
    "this leads to an averaged tidal luminosity , @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the mass of the host star , @xmath30 is the mass of the planet , @xmath31 . for comparison , @xmath32 is the luminosity of our jupiter .",
    "@xcite presents a possible migration path for hd 80606b due to kozai - lidov cycles plus tidal friction ( kctf ) , and in their simulation , over @xmath33 , the `` migration rate '' @xmath34 at @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 is @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 , corresponding to @xmath41 , respectively , which span @xmath42 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "if tidal dissipation occurs in a deep enough layer of the planet atmosphere , the thermal relaxation time @xmath43 can be much longer than the orbital time scale ( @xmath44 ) , the planet would constantly radiate at its tidal luminosity .",
    "the physics of tidal dissipation in giant planets is an unsolved theoretical problem , and there is no reliable method to calculate where the tidal dissipation happens in the planet atmosphere .",
    "the upper limit of @xmath43 is the kevin - helmholtz time scale @xmath45 , which is about @xmath46 for a jupiter with luminosity @xmath47 at hundreds of @xmath48 . for the jovian planets of interest",
    ", @xmath49 is at most factor of 100 smaller than that for the jupiter , and at this extreme , for @xmath50 , @xmath51 is still @xmath52 , much longer than the orbital time scale .",
    "the tidal forcing acts on the planet body as a whole , so it is reasonable to expect that significant tidal dissipation operates at a depth that is a considerable fraction of the planet radius and then @xmath43 is approximately @xmath53 , which is many orders of magnitude larger than the orbital time .",
    "we make the reasonable assumption @xmath54 throughout the paper .",
    "the luminosities of migrating jupiters can be tidally enhanced by @xmath55 orders of magnitude , comparable to young jupiters at @xmath1 @xcite , which are the prime targets for ongoing and planned direct - imaging surveys @xcite .",
    "these tidally powered jupiters could be located at @xmath56 , and their maximum separations at apastron are further enhanced by high eccentricity @xmath57 by a factor @xmath58 , making them promising targets for direct - imaging detections .",
    "tidally powered jupiters are not necessarily limited to those actively migrating at high eccentricity .",
    "for example , in the specific cases of kctf , while the planet visits the highly eccentric phase that enables tidal dissipation at periastron passages in each kozai - lidov cycle , it typically spends much longer ( factor of @xmath6 more , see @xcite ) time oscillating at low - eccentricity orbits .",
    "the oscillation amplitude in @xmath2 is generally larger when the planets are at longer period where relativistic precession is weaker .",
    "if the thermal time scale @xmath43 is longer than the kozai - lidov time scale ( @xmath59 for hd 80606b while migrating at @xmath60 ) , the planet radiates approximately at the averaged tidal luminosity @xmath61 during the whole kozai - lidov cycle .",
    "therefore , the tidally - powered jupiters include not only those at high @xmath2 ( i.e. , small pericenter ) but also a factor of @xmath6 more experiencing kozai - lidov oscillations at lower @xmath2 .",
    "the achievable sensitivity of high - contrast imaging instruments degrades substantially within the so - called inner working angle , which is often quoted to be @xmath62 times the diffraction limit , @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the observed wavelength and @xmath65 is telescope aperture . several high - contrast imaging instruments are and will be commissioned in the near future on a number of 8 - 10 m telescopes , such as gemini gpi @xcite , vlt sphere @xcite , and subaru scexao @xcite , lbti @xcite .",
    "the best contrast goals of these instruments are @xmath66 in near - ir beyond the inner working angle @xcite .",
    "see fig . 1 for",
    "their expected contrast ratio curves in near ir .    at a migration rate of @xmath67 ,",
    "tidal luminosities for @xmath68 planets are @xmath69 ( @xmath70 - @xmath71 ) , corresponding to blackbody effective temperatures @xmath72 for a planet radius @xmath73 .",
    "the peaks of the black body radiation at these temperatures are at @xmath74 .",
    "the black body contrast ratios at @xmath75 ( @xmath76-band ) of the planet to a sun - like star ( @xmath77 ) are @xmath78 . at bands further away from the peak ( e.g. , @xmath79 ) , black body radiation is exponentially suppressed , resulting in very low flux ratios . however , the near - ir spectral energy distribution is unlikely to be well described by black body emission .",
    "for example , jupiter has a spectral window allowing for probing deeper , warmer layers of the atmosphere that leads to orders of magnitude larger flux than that of a @xmath80 blackbody in near - ir @xcite .",
    "we note that according to @xcite s model , at effective temperatures @xmath81 and @xmath82 , with surface gravity @xmath83 , the contrast ratios in [ @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath76]-band with a sun - like star are approximately @xmath88 $ ] , @xmath89 $ ] , respectively .",
    "other models @xcite generally predict similar contrast ratios in @xmath76-band , but the predictions can vary by order of magnitude in @xmath84-band and @xmath85-band , possibly reflecting theoretical uncertainties in such calculations such as the treatment of clouds and planet luminosity evolution .",
    "@xcite estimate that the frequency of long - period ( hundreds of days ) , highly - eccentric jupiters is about @xmath90 that of hot jupiters , whose occurrence rate is estimated to be @xmath91 around fgk dwarfs @xcite .",
    "therefore , @xmath92 of solar - type stars may host this population .",
    "there are @xmath93 fgk dwarfs within @xmath94 of the sun , which amounts to @xmath6 potentially tidally - powered jupiters .",
    "the closest super - eccentric jupiter host is then at @xmath95 , and suppose it starts migration near the snow line at @xmath96 , its maximum angular separation is @xmath97 ( achieved at apastron for @xmath57 ) , which is marked as a shaded black line in fig.1 .    in fig.1 ,",
    "the expected ranges of @xmath85-band contrast ratio assuming migration rate varying from @xmath98 to @xmath99 for planets with @xmath100 are shown in shaded regions in green , blue and yellow , respectively .",
    "it is challenging for present and most of the upcoming high - contrast imaging instruments such as gemini / nici , gemini / gpi and vlt / sphere to detect the population of tidally - powered jupiters due to their relatively large inner working angles ( @xmath101 ) .",
    "the most promising instrument is scexao at subaru .",
    "the extreme ao system of scexao is expected to allow for significant sensitivity inside @xmath102 , which may potentially probe the tidal jupiters as close as @xmath103 at @xmath104 .",
    "one strategy to identify these tidally - powered jupiters is to follow up long - period , highly eccentric planets with known radial velocity ( rv ) orbits , which are likely to be actively migrating . for @xmath57 ,",
    "one obtains maximum projected separation very close to apastron at @xmath105 , where @xmath106 is the argument of periastron .",
    "there is one rv planet , with @xmath107 and @xmath108 , known as hd 20782b @xcite at @xmath109 , and the best - fit parameters are @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 ( note that the eccentricity needs to confirmed as the periastron passage was not sufficiently probed ) .",
    "it reaches maximum angular separation at @xmath114 at apocenter , which corresponds to @xmath115 at @xmath84-band , @xmath116 at @xmath85-band , @xmath117 at @xmath86-band and @xmath118 at @xmath76-band for a 10 m telescope .",
    "the target is difficult to image for most of the current and upcoming high - contrast imaging instruments but it is likely to be accessible by scexao at subaru given its small expected inner working angle allowed by its extreme ao system ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "the long baseline of lbti ( 22.8 m ) may be advantageous in terms of spatial resolution , but it is challenging given the inner working angle achievable for the current available instrument .",
    "it may be accessible when the lbti high contrast imaging system is refined ( private communication , philip hinz 2012 ) .",
    "as previously discussed , if kctf takes place , many long - period , low-@xmath2 jupiters can be tidally - powered by radiating heat accumulated from past high-@xmath2 visits , and their occurrence rate can be @xmath6 larger than that of the actively - migrating , high-@xmath2 population . a possible observation strategy would be to directly image all rv planets with sufficiently large maximum angular separations and probe this population ( as well as those that show a linear trend , which indicates the probable presence of long - period planets ) . planetary systems with known perturbers from rv residuals or imaging may receive preference since the planets in these system have a higher probability of kozai - lidov oscillation .",
    "advanced ao / coronagraphs and better post processing techniques ( e.g. , @xcite ) may help to increase the contrast and decrease the inner working angle",
    ".    it may also be possible to remove the speckle noise more efficiently and improve the detection sensitivity with information from the known orbital phase from rv , which will further boost the detectable contrast ratio and obtain smaller inner working angle .",
    "a large fraction of nearby main - sequence stars have not been monitored by rv sufficiently long to find long - period jupiters .",
    "the all - sky astrometric mission gaia is expected to be sensitive to planets more massive than jupiter between @xmath119 for all solar - type hosts within @xmath120 @xcite , so it will make a nearly complete census of tidally - powered jupiters in the solar neighborhood and provide an excellent sample for direct - imaging follow - ups .",
    "if the tidally - powered jupiters are directly imaged , their luminosities provide a direct measure of planet migration rate due to tidal dissipation and thus constrain high-@xmath2 migration mechanisms . combined with rv orbits",
    ", one can break the inclination degeneracy in rv to obtain the de - projected true mass and full orbital solution , making them an excellent laboratory to study planetary dynamics . with",
    "measured mass and luminosity , one may probe the spectral formation of gas giant atmosphere as well as the physics of tidal dissipation .",
    "it is interesting to note that , even though similar high-@xmath2 population may exist for binary stars @xcite , it is much more difficult to measure tidal luminosity directly due to nuclear burning .    as discussed in @xcite and @xcite , transit surveys such as _ kepler _ are ideal to find the eccentric migrating jupiters due to their enhanced transit probability .",
    "space - based transit surveys that target bright stars may potentially provide an excellent sample of tidally - powered planets hosted by nearby stars that are suitable for direct - imaging study . for transiting planets , high - precision ir light curves with secondary eclipse could in principle directly measure the tidal luminosity for these planets as well ( see @xcite ) .",
    "ground - based high - contrast imaging instruments are experiencing rapid development over the last few years , and the tidally powered jupiters may turn out to be the most luminous planets to image for nearby solar - type main - sequence stars .",
    "new instruments such as scexao should already be able to probe this population .",
    "future telescopes such as tmt , gmt and elt can conduct a thorough survey for this population around nearby stars due to their smaller diffraction limits ( see fig .",
