    "communication @xcite has recently attracted much attention due to it can achieve a larger rate region , compared with traditional networks .",
    "many cooperative protocols have been proposed in the literature .",
    "these protocols are usually classified into three categories : decode - and - forward ( df ) protocol , where the relay decodes and re - encodes the signals transmitted by the source ; amplify - and - forward ( af ) protocol , in which a relay simply amplifies its received signals ; compress - and - forward ( cf ) protocol , where the relay compresses the signals from the source , and forwards these compressed soft information to the destination .",
    "for df protocol , it has been widely researched based on ldpc codes @xcite , and suffers a loss of performance when the relay ca nt be guaranteed to recover the source information .",
    "the relay always can assist the source to convey information with amplified soft information when af protocol is employed , but the protocol is suboptimal .",
    "cf protocol , jointing source - channel coding , is a form of wyner - ziv ( wz ) coding @xcite in case of lossy compression and slepian - wolf coding @xcite in the lossless case .",
    "it takes advantages of the statistical dependence of the relay s and destination s channel output , and achieves higher rate than df and af .",
    "+ so far , most of the researches concerning cf remain at the theoretical level and the realization of cf is tackled in only a few papers , @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "these papers achieve slepian - wolf compression at the relay by taking the syndrome of an ldpc code @xcite , or by using an irregular repeat accumulator ( ira ) code @xcite that combines slepian - wolf coding with channel coding on the relay - to - destination channel .",
    "however these approaches are suitable only when the source - relay channel output is binary and the relay does lossless ( rather than lossy ) compression .",
    "otherwise , e.g. the gaussian relay channel is considered in @xcite , significant capacity losses will result .",
    "+ it is known that ldpc codes are good channel codes and recent work has also shown that ldgm codes are good source codes . some near - ideal encoding / decoding algorithms with ldgm codes",
    "have been proposed @xcite@xcite , furthermore nested ldgm - ldpc codes often are used to guarantee both channel coding and source coding performance . in @xcite ,",
    "such nested codes are used to approach capacity in dirty paper coding , where good channel coding ensures low error probability and good source coding guarantees good shaping of the transmitted signal .",
    "+ to focus on the effective compression of the received data at the relay , we consider a three terminal cooperative system where the source - destination and source - relay links are both binary erasure channel ( bec ) , and the relay - destination link is orthogonal to them .",
    "as the received signal by the relay through the bec is 3-ary , the aforementioned syndrome methods are insufficient , making the proposed nested codes necessary . + this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii gives a brief introduction to the system model involving a relay channel .",
    "section iii describes the compression and decoding algorithms based on nested ldgm - ldpc codes .",
    "section iv presents the degree distribution optimization method necessary for good performance .",
    "experiment results are given in section v to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms and optimization methods .",
    "finally , section vi concludes the paper .",
    "the full - duplex single relay system is shown in fig.1 .",
    "it comprises a source s , a destination d and a relay node r. the s - r and s - d links , both with erasure probability @xmath0 , form a binary erasure broadcast channel .",
    "the r - d link , with a capacity denoted by @xmath1 , is orthogonal to the s - d and s - r links . denoting an erased bit by @xmath2 ,",
    "the relay system is described by four random variables @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and one conditional probability distribution @xmath7,which is shown in table i.        .conditional probability distribution of @xmath8 , when @xmath9 , the variables value : 0 and 1 exchange [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     with optimized degree distribution of @xmath10 and @xmath11 , the simulation of encoding and decoding processes is executed .",
    "the experiment result shows that the iteration count of bp decoding the ldgm part in @xmath11 is about 200 , and ldpc decoding in destination is only about 150 .",
    "however , when erasure probability @xmath0 decreases , which denotes the channel capacity increases , the iteration count will decrease .",
    "with monte carlo simulation , the ber performance at destination node for relay system in bec under cf and df is shown in table v. simulation shows that under cf the ber is about @xmath12 in most blocks , and some blocks even recover source information correctly , which sees that cf is much better than df ( @xmath13 , by only optimizing the degree distribution of @xmath10 to realize df ) . besides , @xmath14 is close to cf theoretical limit 0.75 .",
    "+ some remarks on the design of @xmath10 and @xmath11 are in order .",
    "firstly , when the degree distribution of ldpc in @xmath10 and ldgm in @xmath11 is optimized , the degree of s - nodes and b - nodes should be chosen carefully . here",
    "reasonable choice of @xmath15 ranges from 16 to 20 and @xmath16 .",
    "secondly , we should leave a uniform gap between the exit curves of ldpc codes in @xmath10 and between ebp curves of the ldgm and ldpc parts in @xmath11 to make iterative decoding converge with a reasonable number of iterations rather than getting stuck . besides , in order not to cut down the designed rate , we need assure the gap @xmath17 and @xmath18 should not be larger than 0.01 in every iteration . e.g.",
    "this gap of the ebp curves of the nested ldgm - ldpc part in @xmath11 is designed with @xmath19 , which is shown in fig.4 .",
    "the decoding process of @xmath20 will not get stuck and with the flipped position known in the destination , @xmath20 could be decoded correctly .",
    "+ thirdly , there will inevitably be some incorrect decimation in the ldgm quantization process , which cause contradictions that must be corrected by flipping some bits in @xmath21 .",
    "this @xmath21 must also be transmitted to the destination using a fraction of @xmath1 , so that it can perform decoding correctly .",
    "we found that the number of flipped positions is about 600 , and @xmath22 is 1.2696bit / sym , so we require @xmath23 bit / sym ( here @xmath24 )",
    ". we could see that even with the flipped positions transmitted the required channel capacity @xmath1 of r - d link can still be lower than @xmath25 bit / sym . in our future work , we will study the lossy compression of @xmath20 , so that we can get lower @xmath1 .",
    "+ it is also observed that the performance of the proposed practical cf scheme improves as the block length increases at the cost of larger memory consumption and coding delay .",
    "in this paper , a first practical cf scheme for a type of relay system based on nested ldgm - ldpc has been proposed , and methods for optimizing the degree distributions have been described .",
    "simulation results show that the nested ldgm - ldpc codes can perform slepian - wolf compression of the relay s ternary received signals when the relay system is bec .",
    "the performance of our scheme approaches the cf theoretical cut - set bound , while previous schemes are either limited to binary signals or suboptimal .",
    "our work shows nested ldgm - ldpc codes for practical cf scheme is sufficient .",
    "+ it is apparently straightforward to extend the proposed scheme to realize lossy compression , which would offer better performance achieved at a lower relay - destination channel capacity .",
    "the design will be considered in our future work .",
    "we will also try to optimize the gap between the bep curves of the ldgm and ldpc parts of the nested code , so that its decoding can converge more quickly and reliably .",
