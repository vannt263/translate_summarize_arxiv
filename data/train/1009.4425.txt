    "type iip supernovae ( sne  iip ) are believed to originate from @xmath6 stars which end their life with the core collapse into neutron star and the subsequent envelope ejection via the neutrino - driven mechanism @xcite , or alternatively , via the magneto - rotational mechanism @xcite .",
    "in fact , limits for the mass range of sne  iip progenitors ( main - sequence stars ) are fuzzy , because the theory of both stellar evolution and sn  iip explosion is still in progress and can not predict reliably the outcome . on the other hand ,",
    "the observational constraints for the progenitor masses are rather ambiguous . indeed , the progenitors of sne  iip recovered from pre - explosion images turn out to be predominantly low - mass ( @xmath7 ) stars @xcite , while the hydrodynamic modelling of the handful of well - observed sne  iip indicates that sne  iip primarily originate from high - mass ( @xmath8 ) progenitors ( * ? ? ? * and references there ) .",
    "more massive ( @xmath9 ) stars end up with the black hole formation which may be accompanied with a very weak explosion @xcite ; they are associated with underluminous sne  iip @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the underluminous sne  iip might originate from the low - mass end of massive star range @xcite .",
    "a tiny fraction ( order of 1% ) of stars producing black holes is responsible for energetic sne ( hypernovae ) powered by the disk accretion onto black hole @xcite .",
    "it should be stressed that all the hypernovae so far observed are exploding wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars lacking any hydrogen in the outer layers .",
    "recently a distant ( @xmath10 ) type iip sn  2009kf has been discovered by the pan - starrs 1 survey @xcite which turns out to be unusually luminous for this class of sne . with the mid - plateau magnitude @xmath11 mag",
    "it is @xmath12 mag brighter compared to normal sne  iip . despite a large distance",
    "this sn became a subject of the detailed photometric and spectroscopic study @xcite .",
    "apart from the high optical luminosity the sn is unusually bright in the ultraviolet ( uv ) band of _ galex _ with the near uv absolute magnitude @xmath13 mag and has unusually large photospheric velocity @xmath14 kms@xmath15 on day 61 @xcite .",
    "authors suggest that the standard model of sn  iip is not applicable to sn  2009kf .",
    "they mention several possibilities to account for this unusual sn  iip : a huge explosion energy ( @xmath16 erg ) , a large pre - sn radius ( @xmath17 ) , a large @xmath3ni mass , and a strong interaction of ejecta with a dense circumstellar ( cs ) shell .    given unusual characteristics of sn  2009kf we present results of the hydrodynamic simulations of this object in a framework of the explosion of a red supergiant ( rsg ) .",
    "we recover basic parameters of the event and find that the required explosion energy is indeed tremendous , comparable with the explosion energy of hypernovae .",
    "we evaluate the role of alternative power sources , viz . radioactive @xmath3ni decay and cs interaction , and find them irrelevant .",
    "implications of our results for the pre - sn and the progenitor are discussed .",
    "the spherically - symmetric hydrodynamic code with one - group radiation transfer is employed to model sn  2009kf .",
    "the code was described in details earlier @xcite and was used to study several other well - observed sne  iip ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references there ) .",
    "the explosion energy is modelled by the supersonic piston applied at the mass - cut which presumably is a border between collapsing core and ejected mass . a non - evolutionary massive rsg in hydrostatic equilibrium",
    "is used as a pre - sn model .",
    "the helium core of pre - sn is presumably mixed with the hydrogen envelope and the density jump between the helium core and hydrogen envelope is essentially smoothed .",
    "arguments in favor of a non - evolutionary pre - sn for the hydrodynamic models of sne  iip were presented by @xcite .",
    "principal fitting parameters , which determine the light curve and the expansion velocity at the photosphere , are the explosion energy , ejecta mass , pre - sn radius , and amount of @xmath3ni .",
    "`` second order '' but also important ingredient of the model is a mixing between helium core and hydrogen envelope .",
    "the mixing determines the shape of the plateau at the final stage , and generally a high degree of mixing is needed to account for the light curve shape @xcite .",
    "a mixing of @xmath3ni also affects the light curve at the transition from the plateau to the radioactive tail .",
    "the issue of the dependence of the hydrodynamic model on parameters was explored in detail earlier @xcite .",
    "preliminary computations of sn  2009kf light curves and expansion velocities showed that the explosion energy in the optimal model should exceed @xmath18 erg . that enormous energy is beyond the capabilities of the explosion mechanisms usually associated with the core collapse into the neutron star and seems to indicate the same explosion mechanism as for hypernovae @xcite .",
    "we therefore consider below models with the large mass of collapsing core that forms presumably a black hole with the rest mass of @xmath19 .",
    "the latter is close to the minimal value which provides the required explosion energy by the accretion of @xmath20 for @xmath21 1% efficiency .",
    "the extensive study of a parameter space led us to the optimal model of sn  2009kf that can describe simultaneously the @xmath22 light curve ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , the early strong bolometric luminosity peak along with the end phase of the plateau ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) , and the expansion velocity at the photosphere ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "the observational @xmath22 light curve is taken from @xcite , and the bolometric light curve is constructed with a black - body fit to the @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 photometry and the nuv flux , only for the first three epochs , assuming a total extinction @xmath27 mag .",
    "the velocity at the photosphere of @xmath28 kms@xmath15 is recovered from the spectrum on day 61 @xcite using the modelling of the h@xmath29 and hei 5876  line profiles . in fitting the light curves we rely primarily on the @xmath22 band data rather than on the bolometric light curve in which the initial peak is mainly determined by the nuv flux which in turn is severely hampered by errors in the total extinction .",
    "the parameter set of the optimal model consists of the ejected mass @xmath30 , explosion energy @xmath31 erg , pre - sn radius @xmath32 , and the @xmath3ni mass of @xmath4 .",
    "the latter is the upper limit reported by @xcite . on the basis of the @xmath22 light curve and the velocity at the photosphere",
    "we determine the sn parameters with accuracy of @xmath21 10% .",
    "the ejecta mass combined with the adopted mass of the black hole of @xmath19 gives a pre - sn mass of @xmath33 , maximal among other pre - sne for previously modelled sne  iip ( cf .",
    "it should be emphasized that for the adopted value of the @xmath3ni mass the ejecta mass and the explosion energy of the model are minimal ; a decrease of the @xmath3ni mass would require a larger ejecta mass and explosion energy .",
    "the @xmath22 light curve for the model with the @xmath3ni mass of @xmath34 and the model without @xmath3ni illustrate this point ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) : with the lower @xmath3ni mass the plateau is shorter , so a larger ejecta mass and explosion energy are needed to account for the plateau duration for the same photospheric velocity .",
    "computations show that in order to produce sensible fit of the bolometric light curve with @xmath34 of @xmath3ni one needs to increase the ejected mass and explosion energy by a factor of @xmath35 .",
    "the light curve at the end of the plateau depends also on the extent of the @xmath3ni mixing .",
    "remarkably , in the model with the @xmath3ni mass of @xmath4 the @xmath3ni should be mixed homogeneously in the inner ejecta up to 7700 kms@xmath15 .",
    "the luminous broad initial peak of the bolometric light curve of sn  2009kf is related , as usually for sne  iip , with the large pre - sn radius .",
    "the recovered radius @xmath36 is larger than the radii of pre - sne of well - studied sne  iip , which lie in the range of @xmath37 ( table  [ tbl-1 ] ) . keeping in mind that the radius of massive rsg increases with the progenitor mass @xcite , the large pre - sn radius can be considered as an independent evidence in favor of the relatively large pre - sn mass compared to normal sne  iip .",
    "the primary uncertainty of the derived sn parameters is related with the poorly determined extinction in the host galaxy .",
    "we explore this uncertainty assuming a total extinction to be @xmath38 and @xmath39 mag . in the case of @xmath38 mag the upper limit of @xmath3ni mass",
    "is @xmath40 . with this amount of @xmath3ni",
    "the pre - sn radius should be smaller , @xmath41 , while the ejecta mass and the explosion energy of the model increase up to @xmath42 and @xmath43 erg , respectively .",
    "note that the @xmath44 ratio is to be invariant because the velocity at the photosphere on day 61 is fixed . for @xmath39 mag the upper limit of the @xmath3ni mass",
    "is @xmath45 .",
    "this amount of @xmath3ni permits us to obtain a satisfactory fit of the light curves to the observations with the same ejecta mass and the explosion energy as for the optimal model , but with the pre - sn radius increased by a factor of @xmath21 2 . however , if the adopted @xmath3ni mass is lower than the upper limit , then one needs to increase the ejecta mass and the explosion energy to reproduce the light curves together with the velocity at the photosphere on day 61 .",
    "we thus conclude that the ejecta mass and explosion energy can not be lower than the values for the optimal hydrodynamic model .",
    "the major result of the hydrodynamic modelling of sn  2009kf is the conclusion that the sn has been caused by the energetic explosion of a massive and extended rsg .",
    "parameters of hydrodynamic model for sn  2009kf are listed in table  [ tbl-1 ] together with parameters of other sne  iip studied earlier ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the columns in the order contain sn name , pre - sn radius , ejecta mass , explosion energy , @xmath3ni mass , maximal velocity of the @xmath3ni mixing zone , minimal velocity of the hydrogen matter , mass of the collapsed core , pre - sn mass , mass lost by the wind , and progenitor mass . in the case of sn",
    "2009kf progenitor we suggest a single star scenario , while the total mass lost through the wind outflow is adopted to be equal to that lost by the progenitor of sn  2004et .",
    "sn  2009kf stands out from the list of other sne  iip by its extremely large explosion energy which is 10 times greater than the explosion energy of sn  2004et , the most energetic event among previously studied sne  iip .",
    "an exceptional nature of sn  2009kf is emphasized by its position on diagrams of the explosion energy and the @xmath3ni mass vs. progenitor mass ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) . despite the fact that sn  2009kf does not deviate from the general trends on both plots the explosion physics of sn",
    "2009kf is likely essentially different from that of other sne  iip .    before the further discussion of implications of the results we should consider alternative explanations for the unusually high luminosity of sn  2009kf . given the rather confident upper limit for the @xmath3ni amount , the only remaining possibility for the power source is the cs interaction .",
    "this mechanism suggests that the kinetic luminosity , released in the radiative shock wave , is emitted by the cool dense shell ( cds ) at the ejecta / cs interface likewise it is the case for sne  iin .",
    "quick look at the spectra of sn  2009kf at the plateau stage shows that the strong cs interaction is unlikely in this case , because the spectra have little to do with the sn  iin spectra .",
    "indeed , the latter never show pronounced broad absorption lines ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; by contrast , the h@xmath29 line of sn  2009kf has the deep absorption component ( see * ? ? ? * ) , quite similar to other sne  iip . to strengthen further arguments against the cs interaction",
    "we note that the maximal velocity detected in the h@xmath29 absorption component of sn  2009kf on day 61 is @xmath46 kms@xmath15 .",
    "this means that the double - shock structure , formed by the forward and reverse shocks with the cds at the contact surface , expands with the velocity @xmath47 kms@xmath15 .",
    "meanwhile , the h@xmath29 absorption component indicates that the continuum source resides at velocities @xmath48 kms@xmath15 , which is in odd with the assumption that the bulk radiation originates from the high - velocity ejecta / cs interface .",
    "this evidence thus rules out the cs interaction as a major source of the sn  2009kf luminosity .",
    "regardless of the role of the cs interaction , the upper limit of the wind density could be valuable .",
    "the wind density can be estimated using the upper limit of the luminosity at the nebular stage @xmath49 mag on day 236 @xcite , which can be converted into the upper limit of the optical luminosity , @xmath50 ergs@xmath15 , assuming that the spectral energy distribution is similar to that at the end of the plateau stage . to recover the upper limit of the wind density",
    "we employ the interaction model based on the thin shell approximation @xcite for the ejecta mass and the explosion energy found for sn  2009kf . for the adopted @xmath3ni mass of @xmath4 the upper limit of the wind density parameter turns out to be @xmath51 gcm@xmath15 .",
    "this estimate refers to the epoch of 236 days and the radius of @xmath53 cm .",
    "assuming the wind velocity @xmath54 kms@xmath15 we conclude that the upper limit of the wind density corresponds to the mass - loss rate @xmath55yr@xmath15 at the stage @xmath56 yr before the sn explosion .",
    "the question arises on the nature of the central `` infernal machine '' responsible for the huge explosion energy @xmath57 erg , one order magnitude exceeding the energy of normal sne  iip .",
    "in fact , the explosion energy of sn  2009kf is comparable with the explosion energy of energetic sne  ic ( hypernovae ) , associated with gamma - ray bursts ( e.g. sn  1998bw ) . according to the recent compilation of @xcite ,",
    "the explosion energies of hypernovae lie in the range of @xmath58 erg ; sn  2009kf falls into this interval .",
    "the absence of alternative possibilities compels us to suggest that sn  2009kf is caused by the `` engine '' associated with the hypernova phenomenon .",
    "the possibility that the collapsar mechanism could operate in massive stars with retained hydrogen envelope and produce a very powerful sn was proposed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the widely shared view is that the hypernova explosion is powered by a rapid disk accretion into the black hole @xcite .",
    "two conceivable scenarios are proposed how the black hole and accretion disk system with the high accretion rate might arise : ( i ) a core collapse in a single rapidly rotating star ( collapsar model ) @xcite , or ( ii ) a black hole ( neutron star ) merger with the he - core of massive companion ( merger model ) @xcite .",
    "the merger scenario suggests that the neutron star , merged with he - core as a result of a super - eddington accretion , rapidly grows a black hole surrounded by the accretion disk .",
    "the presence of a massive hydrogen envelope in sn  2009kf imposes constraint on the single star scenario : the progenitor should be less massive than the critical mass @xmath59 above which wr stars form due to the complete removal of the hydrogen envelope .",
    "this boundary is not well known because of uncertainties in the mass - loss rate ; for the solar metallicity the currently preferred value is in the range of @xmath60 @xcite .",
    "thus , in the single star scenario the progenitor mass should be @xmath61 .",
    "the merger scenario includes two major stages : ( i ) conservative evolution of a close massive binary that ends up with the formation of the neutron star ( black hole ) in pair with the massive normal star , and ( ii ) spiral - in of the neutron star ( black hole ) in the massive star companion with subsequent merging with the helium core .",
    "the neutron star in the process of merging grows black hole @xcite so that the final stage of pre - sn is the central black hole surrounded with the dense helium accretion disk embedded in the massive hydrogen envelope .    as an example , the original close binary might consist of @xmath62 and @xmath63 stars . after the conservative mass transfer the primary ends up as @xmath64 he star in pair with the secondary @xmath65 star",
    "the subsequent evolution of the helium star leads to sn  ib / c or sn  iib explosion with the neutron star ( black hole ) left behind in pair with the massive star .",
    "this is the stage of massive x - ray binary . after the secondary forms a he core",
    ", the stellar radius grows , the roche lobe overflow begins and the common envelope forms .",
    "the common envelope stage ends up as a black hole surrounded with the helium accretion disk within the massive hydrogen envelope .",
    "the rapid disk accretion onto black hole eventually gives rise to the sn  2009kf event .",
    "the energetic sne  iip produced by the hypernova mechanism are extremely rare events .",
    "this is indicated by the large distance of the unique sn  2009kf . to a first approximation",
    "the rate ratio of sn  2009kf - like to sn  1998bw - like events can be estimated interpreting their distances ( @xmath66 mpc and @xmath67 mpc , respectively ) as the closest neighbor distances .",
    "the closest neighbor distance @xmath68 is defined by the obvious equation @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the solid angle of the survey , @xmath71 is the detection efficiency , @xmath72 is the sn rate per unit volume , and @xmath73 is the total observation time . assuming that @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath73 are comparable for the detection of both hypernovae and sn  2009kf - like events , we obtain the rough estimate of the rate ratio @xmath74 . note that malmquist bias can not change this ratio significantly because the absolute magnitudes of these phenomena are comparable .",
    "we conclude therefore that roughly 0.01% of all hypernovae can retain a massive hydrogen envelope and produce sn  2009kf - like events .",
