    "<S> to be more precise , this is the purely @xmath0-treatment , so formally this might also apply to isospin . however . </S>",
    "<S> it is rather hard to imagine realistic quasiclassical isospin problems .    </S>",
    "<S> theory of angular momentum is based on the group @xmath0 and its quotient @xmath2 . </S>",

    "<S> so , this shift of indices is here analytically a purely `` cosmetic '' procedure , however we use it to follow the standard convention .    </S>",
    "<S> we know that @xmath0 is the universal @xmath17 covering group of @xmath1 , the proper orthogonal group in @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> the projection epimorphism @xmath18 is given by @xmath19    with respect to the basis ( [ eq_3.3 ] ) the killing metric @xmath20 has the components @xmath21 obviously , the negative definiteness is due to the compactness of the simple algebra / group @xmath22 . for practical purposes </S>",
    "<S> one eliminates the factor @xmath23 and takes the metric @xmath24    in terms of the canonical coordinates of the first kind : @xmath25 where , obviously , @xmath26 denotes the euclidean length of the vector @xmath27 : @xmath28 its range is @xmath29 $ ] and the range of the unit vector ( versor ) @xmath30 is the total unit sphere @xmath31 . </S>",

    "<S> sometimes one denotes @xmath37 then ( [ eq_3.8 ] ) may be written down as follows : @xmath38 where the summation convention is meant over @xmath39 , @xmath40 and this formula together with the structure of parametrization ( [ eq_3.8 ] ) , ( [ eq_3.12 ] ) tells us that @xmath0 is the unit sphere @xmath41 in @xmath42 . roughly speaking </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath32 is the `` north pole '' and @xmath43 is the corresponding `` south pole '' .    </S>",
    "<S> this `` pseudo - relativistic '' notation is rather misleading . </S>",
    "<S> the point is that the matrices @xmath44 , @xmath45 above are used to represent linear mappings in @xmath46 , i.e. , mixed tensors in @xmath46 . in the relativistic theory of spinors , </S>",
    "<S> e.g. , in lagrangians for ( anti)neutrino fields , @xmath44 are used as matrices of sesqulinear hermitian forms , thus , twice covariant tensors on @xmath46 </S>",

    "<S> this is seen in the standard procedure of using @xmath47 as the universal covering of the restricted lorentz group @xmath48 , namely , @xmath49 describes the covering assignment @xmath50 the four - dimensional quantity @xmath51 in ( [ eq_3.12 ] ) , ( [ eq_3.13 ] ) may be also interpreted in terms of the group @xmath52 and its covering group , however , this interpretation is relatively complicated and must not be confused with the relativistic aspect of the quadruplet of @xmath44-matrices as analytical representants of sesquilinear forms .    </S>",
    "<S> the lie algebra of @xmath1 , @xmath53 , consists of @xmath54 skew - symmetric matrices with real entries . </S>",
    "<S> the standard choice of basis of @xmath53 , adapted to ( [ eq_3.3 ] ) and to the procedure ( [ eq_3.5 ] ) , is given by matrices @xmath55 , @xmath8 , with entries @xmath56 where again @xmath13 is the totally antisymmetric ricci symbol , and indices are `` cosmetically '' shifted with the help of the kronecker symbol . </S>",

    "<S> the main topological distinction is that @xmath0 is simply connected and @xmath1 is doubly connected .    </S>",
    "<S> using canonical coordinates of the first kind , we have in analogy to ( [ eq_3.8 ] ) the formula @xmath59    because of the obvious reasons , known from elementary geometry and mechanics , @xmath60 is referred to as the rotation vector , @xmath61 is the rotation angle , and the unit vector ( versor ) @xmath62 is the oriented rotation axis . </S>",
    "<S> we use the all standard concepts and symbols of the vector calculus in @xmath16 , in particular , scalar products @xmath63 and vector products @xmath64 . </S>",

    "<S> it is seen in this picture that @xmath1 is doubly connected , because any curve in the ball @xmath69 joining two antipodal points on the boundary @xmath70 is closed under this identification , i.e. , it is a loop , but it can not be continuously contracted into a single point .    obviously , formally , the values @xmath71 are admitted , however , they correspond to rotations by @xmath72 , taken earlier into account . by abuse of language , in @xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> the quantities @xmath60 , @xmath26 are also referred to as the rotation vector and rotation angle . </S>",
    "<S> but one must `` rotate '' by @xmath73 to go back to the same situation , not by @xmath74 . </S>",
    "<S> the matrix of @xmath75 is given by @xmath76 i.e. , @xmath77 or , symbolically , @xmath78    let us distinguish between two ways of viewing , representing geometry of @xmath0 and @xmath1 in terms of some subsets in @xmath16 as the space of rotation vectors @xmath60 or , alternatively , in terms of closed submanifolds and their quotients in @xmath42 .    </S>",
    "<S> as seen from ( [ eq_3.13 ] ) , @xmath0 is a unit sphere @xmath79 , @xmath1 is obtained by the antipodal identification . </S>",
    "<S> then @xmath1 is doubly connected because the curves on @xmath41 joining antipodal points project to the quotient manifold onto closed loops non - contractible to points in a continuous way . in @xmath16 </S>",
    "<S> the group @xmath0 is represented by the ball @xmath80 ; the whole shell @xmath81 represents the single point @xmath82 . </S>",
    "<S> then @xmath1 is pictured as the ball @xmath83 with the antipodal identification of points on the shell @xmath84 , cf . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq_3.19 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this exhibits the identification of @xmath1 with the projective space @xmath85 ; the antipodally identified points on @xmath84 represent the improper points at infinity in @xmath16 .    for certain reasons , both practical and deeply geometrical </S>",
    "<S> , it is convenient to use also another parametrization of @xmath1 , using so - called vector of final rotation : @xmath86 obviously , in the neighbourhood of group identity , when @xmath87 , @xmath88 differs from @xmath60 by higher - order quantity . </S>",
    "<S> the practical advantage of @xmath88 is that the composition rule and the action of rotations are described by very simple and purely algebraic expressions : @xmath89 where @xmath90 \\overline{x}&= & \\overline{x}+ \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{4}\\overline{\\varkappa}^{2 } \\right)^{-1 } \\overline{\\varkappa } \\times \\left(\\overline{x}+ \\frac{1}{2}\\overline{\\varkappa } \\times \\overline{x}\\right ) . </S>",
    "<S> \\label{eq_3.17d}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] an important property of this parametrization is that it describes the projective mapping of @xmath1 onto the projective space @xmath85 . </S>",
    "<S> the one - parameter subgroups and their cosets in @xmath1 are mapped onto straight - lines in @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> the manifold of @xmath91-rotations ( non - trivial square roots of identity ) is mapped onto the set of improper points in @xmath85 , i.e. , it `` blows up '' to infinity .    </S>",
    "<S> the homomorphism ( [ eq_3.5 ] ) of @xmath0 onto @xmath1 , @xmath92 , may be alternatively described in terms of inner automorphisms of @xmath0 and the rotation - vector parametrization : @xmath93 roughly speaking , inner automorphisms in @xmath0 result in rotation of the rotation vector . obviously , the same holds in @xmath1 : @xmath94    therefore , inner automorphisms preserve the length @xmath26 of the rotation vector @xmath60 , and the classes of conjugate elements are characterized by the fixed values of the rotation angle ( but all possible oriented rotation axes @xmath95 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this means that in the above description they are represented by spheres @xmath96 in the space of rotation vectors . </S>",
    "<S> there are two one - element singular equivalence classes in @xmath0 , namely @xmath97 , @xmath98 corresponding respectively to @xmath32 , @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> obviously , in @xmath1 there is only one singular class @xmath99 . </S>",
    "<S> more precisely , in @xmath1 the class @xmath100 is not the sphere , but rather its antipodal quotient , so - called elliptic space . </S>",
    "<S> the idempotents @xmath101/characters @xmath102 and all central functions of the group algebras of @xmath0 and @xmath1 are constant on the spheres @xmath103 , i.e. , depend on @xmath60 only through the rotation angle @xmath26 . in many problems </S>",
    "<S> it is convenient to parametrize @xmath0 and @xmath1 with the help of spherical variables @xmath26 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 in the space @xmath16 of the rotation vector @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> historically the most popular parametrization is that based on the euler angles @xmath106 . </S>",

    "<S> sometimes one uses @xmath110 , @xmath111 instead @xmath112 , @xmath113 in ( [ eq_3.25a ] ) , ( [ eq_3.25b ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the only thing which matters here is that one uses the product of three elements which belong to two one - parameter subgroups . </S>",
    "<S> the euler angles are practically important in gyroscopic problems . </S>",
    "<S> canonical parametrization of the second kind , @xmath114 are not very popular ; one must say , however , that many formulas have the same form in variables @xmath115 and @xmath116 .    it is well known that in @xmath0 irreducible unitary representations , or rather their equivalence classes , are labelled by non - negative integers and half - integers , @xmath117 i.e. , @xmath118 , where @xmath119 denotes the set of naturals ( positive integers ) . and </S>",
    "<S> , obviously , @xmath120    on </S>",
    "<S> @xmath1 one uses integers only , @xmath121 for any @xmath122 , there is only one irreducible representation of dimension @xmath123 ; obviously , only one up to equivalence . </S>",
    "<S> it is not the case for many practically important groups , e.g. , for @xmath124 or for the non - compact group @xmath47 .    </S>",
    "<S> historically , irreducible representations of @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 were found in two alternative ways :    * algebraic one , based on taking the tensor products of fundamental representation ( by itself ) , * differential one , based on solving differential equations like ( 97)(102 ) , ( 109 ) , ( 110 ) in @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the left and right generators @xmath125 , @xmath126 , i.e. , respectively the basic right- and left - invariant vector fields , are analytically given by @xmath127 and therefore @xmath128    in terms of explicitly written components @xmath129 obviously we mean here the shift of indices in the kronecker - delta sense .    </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding cartan one - forms are given by @xmath130 i.e. , in terms of the components , @xmath131    the central functions on @xmath0 and on @xmath1 , in particular the idempotents @xmath132/characters @xmath133 satisfy the obvious differential equations : @xmath134    obviously , the analytical formulas ( [ eq_3.30a])-([eq_3.34b ] ) are formally valid both on @xmath0 and @xmath135 , and in general the calculus on @xmath0 is simpler than that on @xmath135 . </S>",
    "<S> it is convenient to rewrite the formulas ( [ eq_3.30a])-([eq_3.34b ] ) so as to express them explicitly in terms of the angular and radial differential operations in the space of rotation vectors @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> after simple calculations one obtains @xmath136    using the @xmath16-vector notation , including also the vectors with operator components , we can denote briefly , without using indices and labels , @xmath137 where @xmath138 denotes the euclidean gradient operator .    </S>",
    "<S> let us note the following interesting and suggestive duality relations : @xmath139    obviously , in @xmath16 , considered as an abelian group under addition of vectors , the right - invariant fields coincide with the left - invariant ones , and when using spherical variables we have then @xmath140 this is in agreement with the formulas ( [ eq_3.37a])([eq_3.37e ] ) , namely , in a small neighbourhood of the group identity @xmath141 , i.e. , for @xmath142 , expressions ( [ eq_3.37a])([eq_3.37e ] ) up to higher - order terms in @xmath60 , one obtains @xmath143 obviously , the quantities @xmath95 , @xmath144 , @xmath145 are non - sensitive to the asymptotics @xmath146 , because they are purely angular @xmath147 variables , independent of @xmath26 .    </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0 is the sphere @xmath41 in @xmath42 . taking the sphere of radius @xmath148 , @xmath149 , and performing the limit transition @xmath150 , one obtains also the relationships ( [ eq_3.39a ] ) , ( [ eq_3.39b ] ) as an asymptotic limit .    </S>",
    "<S> the killing metric tensor with the modified normalization ( [ eq_3.7 ] ) is given by @xmath151 and its contravariant inverse by @xmath152 obviously , the corresponding metric element may be concisely written as @xmath153 or , in a more sophisticated way , @xmath154 and , similarly , for the inverse tensor , @xmath155    according to the standard procedure , the volume element on the riemannian manifold is given by @xmath156}d_{3}\\overline{k}. \\label{eq_3.46}\\ ] ]    it is easy to see that for our normalization of the metric tensor , @xmath157 where @xmath158 is the usual volume element in @xmath16 as the space of rotation vectors @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> this volume element is identical with that given by ( [ eq_3.47 ] ) , ( [ eq_3.48 ] ) , ( [ eq_3.49 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the reason is that all these expressions are translationally - invariant and the haar measure is unique . </S>",
    "<S> we assume here that @xmath159 is unimodular ; in fact , we mean only the compact semisimple groups and their products with abelian groups ( obviously in the latter case it is not the killing tensor that is meant in the abelian factor ) ; nevertheless , any metric meant there is also assumed translationally - invariant , and so the total riemann measure also coincides with ( [ eq_3.47 ] ) , ( [ eq_3.48 ] ) , ( [ eq_3.49 ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> let us mention that when the euler angles @xmath115 are used as a parametrization , then the riemann metric is given by @xmath160 the measure element is then expressed @xmath161 the metric element expression ( [ eq_3.48 ] ) may be diagonalized by introducing the new `` angles '' : @xmath162 however , this representation rather is not used practically .    </S>",

    "<S> when normalized in this way , it will be denoted as @xmath166 . </S>",
    "<S> the label `` ( 1 ) '' will be omitted when the normalization is clear from the context or when there is no danger of confusion .    </S>",
    "<S> after elementary integrations we find that on @xmath0 the element of normalized measure is given by @xmath167 if we used the normalization ( [ eq_3.47 ] ) , the `` volume '' of @xmath0 would be @xmath168 . with the same normalization </S>",
    "<S> , the volume of @xmath1 would be @xmath169 . </S>",
    "<S> it is intuitively clear : @xmath0 is `` twice larger '' than @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> so , we would have @xmath170 however , as mentioned , all formulas will be meant in the covering group sense @xmath0 .    </S>",
    "<S> the metric tensor ( [ eq_3.41 ] ) , ( [ eq_3.43 ] ) is conformally flat . </S>",
    "<S> it is seen when we introduce some new variables @xmath171 instead of @xmath60 , namely , @xmath172 where @xmath173 denotes some positive constant . </S>",
    "<S> then ( [ eq_3.43 ] ) becomes @xmath174 or , using again the `` sophisticated '' form ( [ eq_3.44 ] ) , @xmath175 obviously , ( [ eq_3.53 ] ) is a conformal mapping of @xmath0 onto @xmath16 with its usual euclidean metric . </S>",
    "<S> the ball @xmath176 `` blows up '' to the total @xmath16 and the sphere @xmath177 `` blows up '' to infinity . in other words , @xmath0 is identified with the one - point compactification of @xmath16 and the element @xmath178 becomes just the compactifying point . </S>",
    "<S> the ball @xmath179 corresponding to the manifold of @xmath1 and its boundary sphere @xmath180 ( non - trivial square - root of identity ) become respectively @xmath181 and @xmath182 . </S>",
    "<S> if we put @xmath183 , they are mapped onto themselves . from the conformal point of view </S>",
    "<S> the particular choice of the constant @xmath173 does not matter .    the projective mapping ( [ eq_3.17a ] ) of @xmath135 onto @xmath184 maps geodetics of ( [ eq_3.43 ] ) onto straight lines in @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is neither isometry nor the conformal transformation , instead we have that @xmath185    on @xmath0 the formulas ( 36 ) , ( 41 ) in @xcite take on the following form : @xmath186 where the dependence @xmath187 is given by ( [ eq_3.5 ] ) , ( [ eq_3.23 ] ) . </S>",

    "<S> namely , we take the subalgebra consisting of all ideals @xmath225 with @xmath417 for some fixed @xmath418 , @xmath419 as mentioned , for large values of @xmath219 , the generated units @xmath420 are essentially concentrated about @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath421 cf . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq_3.120 ] ) , ( [ eq_3.121 ] ) , ( [ eq_3.122 ] ) , ( [ eq_3.123 ] ) , and the following holds : @xmath422 the larger truncation threshold @xmath418 , the better the generated unit of @xmath423 : @xmath424 is approximated by @xmath425 where @xmath412 is given by ( [ eq_3.137 ] ) . of course , the convergence of series ( [ eq_3.141 ] ) and integral ( [ eq_3.142 ] ) is meant in the distribution sense .    </S>",
    "<S> projections of functions @xmath426 , @xmath427 on @xmath0 onto the truncated ideal @xmath423 will be denoted by @xmath428 the abbreviations @xmath429 , @xmath430 are used when there is no danger of confusion .    for physically relevant functions @xmath426 , @xmath427 , </S>",
    "<S> the peter - weyl series expansions of @xmath429 , @xmath430 may be reasonably approximated by continuous integral representations like ( [ eq_3.136 ] ) , ( [ eq_3.142 ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> let us go back to quantum states - densities represented in terms of non - redundant multipole expansions as follows : @xmath431 where the expansion coefficients @xmath432 may be roughly interpreted as magnetic multipole moments .    </S>",
    "<S> quasiclassical states are represented by expressions ( [ eq_3.144a ] ) , ( [ eq_3.144b ] ) , where :    * @xmath418 is `` large '' , * @xmath432 as functions of @xmath219 are concentrated in some ranges : @xmath433 , \\quad \\overline{j } \\gg \\delta j \\gg 1 , \\label{eq_3.145}\\ ] ] * within this range , @xmath432 are slowly varying functions of @xmath219 : @xmath434    algebraic operations of group algebra on @xmath0 attain some very peculiar representation in quasiclassical limit in the above sense . </S>",
    "<S> so , let us write down the convolution formula for `` truncated '' functions : @xmath435    the terms concentrated about @xmath33 , as it was seen , approximately cancel each other . </S>",
    "<S> one can assume that the integrated functions are essentially concentrated in a close neighbourhood of the unity in @xmath0 , i.e. , the null of @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> there , in the lowest order of approximation , we have @xmath436    performing the corresponding taylor expansions in our integral formulas and making use of the earlier mentioned relationship between the variables @xmath60 and @xmath400 , we finally obtain @xmath437 where the convolution symbols on the left- and right - hand sides are respectively meant in the non - commutative @xmath0-sense and commutative sense of @xmath438 . </S>",
    "<S> obviously , ( [ eq_3.149 ] ) is meant in the sense of lowest - order approximation ; the terms with higher - order derivatives are neglected .    </S>",
    "<S> similarly , for the quantum poisson bracket we obtain the familiar expression : @xmath439= \\frac{1}{i\\hbar}\\left(\\widetilde{a } \\ast_{{\\rm su}(2)}\\widetilde{b } - \\widetilde{b } \\ast_{{\\rm </S>",

    "<S> obviously , as usual , @xmath194 is the generator of inner automorphisms in @xmath0 , i.e. , equivalently , of killing rotations in @xmath440 , @xmath441    so , in terms of fourier representants @xmath442 , we have @xmath443 in particular , for the evolution of density @xmath444 we obtain @xmath445_{\\mathbb{r}^{3 } } , \\qquad \\frac{\\partial \\widehat{\\widetilde{\\varrho}}}{\\partial t } = \\left[\\widehat{\\widetilde{h}},\\widehat{\\widetilde{\\varrho}}\\right ] , \\label{eq_3.154}\\ ] ] where @xmath446 denotes the hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> taking appropriate hamiltonians one obtains classical asymptotics of various dynamical models of the evolution of quantum angular momentum , or rather systems of quantum angular momenta . </S>",
    "<S> this includes complicated interactions between magnetic multipoles as described above .    </S>",
    "<S> let finish with some comments concerning quasiclassical formulas which may be helpful when operating with some geometrically and physically important quantities .    </S>",
    "<S> first of all , let us observe that ( [ eq_3.149 ] ) is a merely zeroth - order approximation . </S>",
    "<S> the first - order approximation is given by @xmath447_{\\mathbb{r}^{3 } } , \\label{eq_3.155}\\ ] ] where , let us remind @xmath448_{\\mathbb{r}^{3}}$ ] is the extreme right - hand side of ( [ eq_3.150 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the second term is the lowest - order approximation to the @xmath0-convolution commutator . </S>",
    "<S> it is well known that the commutator , or more precisely quantum poisson bracket , describes infinitesimal transformations , in particular symmetries of quantum states ( as described by density operators ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is well known that the operator eigenequation for density operators , @xmath449 implies that the operators @xmath450 , @xmath451 do commute , thus , their quantum poisson bracket vanishes , @xmath452 obviously , it is assumed here that @xmath450 represents a physical quantity , thus , it is self - adjoint , @xmath453 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the concept of eigenstate , in particular that of pure state ( one satisfying a maximal possible system of compatible eigenconditions ) , unifies in a very peculiar way two logically distinct concepts : information and symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> information aspect is that the physical quantity @xmath450 has a sharply defined value on the state @xmath451 ; there is no statistical spread of measurement results . </S>",
    "<S> symmetry aspect is that @xmath451 is invariant under the one - parameter group of unitaries , i.e. , quantum automorphisms , generated by @xmath450 . on the quantum level , </S>",
    "<S> symmetry properties are implied by information properties , because the quantum poisson bracket is algebraically built of the associative product . </S>",
    "<S> this is no longer the case in quasiclassical limit and on the classical level , where the poisson bracket and ( commutative ) associative product are algebraically independent on each other . but </S>",
    "<S> information and symmetry are qualitatively different things , therefore , on the quasiclassical level , the two first terms of the expansion for the non - commutative associative product should be taken into account when discussing classical concepts corresponding to eigenequations . </S>",
    "<S> otherwise the physical interpretation of eigenconditions would be damaged .    </S>",
    "<S> let us remind , following ( [ eq_3.78a])([eq_3.78c ] ) , that differential equations satisfied by the functions @xmath253 may be written in the following form : @xmath454 with the known spectra of quantum numbers @xmath219 , @xmath262 , @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> rewriting these equations in terms of @xmath0-convolutions we obtain @xmath455 where , obviously , @xmath319 are given by ( [ eq_3.97 ] ) and @xmath456 denotes the convolution - squared vector @xmath319 , @xmath457    to obtain the quasiclassical counterparts of ( [ eq_3.159a])([eq_3.159c ] ) we must use the asymptotic formulas ( [ eq_3.155 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is more convenient to express them in terms of fourier transforms , which were defined as functions on the lie co - algebra @xmath458 . </S>",
    "<S> so , we shall use the coordinates @xmath459 introduced above and the functions @xmath460 such that @xmath461 the left - hand sides of ( [ eq_3.161 ] ) are functions on the lie algebra @xmath462 used to represent the approximate expressions for the elements of canonical basis ( matrix elements of irreducible unireps ) as functions on @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the system ( [ eq_3.159a])([eq_3.159c ] ) is expressed in terms of these fourier transforms as follows : @xmath463 the last two equations imply that @xmath464    it is convenient to use the polar angle @xmath105 in the plane @xmath465 of variables @xmath466 , @xmath467 in @xmath462 , @xmath468 instead of cylindrical variables @xmath469 , @xmath470 , @xmath105 in the lie co - algebra @xmath471 , we shall use the modified , spherically - cylindrical coordinates : @xmath472 they coincide with the canonical darboux coordinates in @xmath473 as a poisson manifold ; their poisson brackets have the following form : @xmath474 in particular , @xmath475 is the basic casimir invariant . </S>",
    "<S> its value surfaces @xmath476 are canonically two - dimensional symplectic manifolds ; the exceptional `` s - state '' value @xmath477 is the singular co - adjoint orbit of dimension zero , just the origin of coordinates .    in these coordinates the following holds : @xmath478 therefore , the system ( [ eq_3.162a])([eq_3.162c ] ) is solved as follows : @xmath479 where @xmath480 is a @xmath219-dependent normalization factor . </S>",
    "<S> it is defined by the demand that @xmath481    as already mentioned above , in quasiclassical situations the quantum - mysterious @xmath482 is not very essential and may be replaced by @xmath483 , or just by @xmath484 .    </S>",
    "<S> let us observe an interesting analogy with some formulas from the weyl - wigner - moyal formalism for quantum systems with classical analogy . </S>",
    "<S> the `` basis '' of the wave function space consisting of non - normalizable , or rather `` dirac-@xmath485-normalized '' , states @xmath486 of fixed linear momentum @xmath487 implies the following @xmath488-algebra `` basis '' in the space of phase - space functions ( including the moyal quasi - probability distributions ) : @xmath489 there is an obvious analogy with the term @xmath490 in ( [ eq_3.168 ] ) , if we put @xmath491 , @xmath492 . </S>",
    "<S> this analogy is not accidental ; however , there is no place here for more details .    equation ( [ eq_3.168 ] ) and normalization condition ( [ eq_3.169 ] ) imply finally that @xmath493 therefore , @xmath494 with the same as previously , asymptotic `` indifference '' concerning @xmath482 , @xmath495 , @xmath484 for large values of @xmath219 .    </S>",
    "<S> * warning : * it must be stressed that the above functions are not literally meant asymptotic expressions for @xmath496 , @xmath497 for `` large '' values of @xmath219 . they may be used instead of rigorous @xmath496 , @xmath497 when superposing them with coefficients `` slowly varying '' as functions of @xmath219 . and the very important point : the discrete quantum number @xmath219 may be then formally admitted to be a continuous variable and the summation with `` slowly - varying '' coefficients may be approximated by integration . in this way </S>",
    "<S> the compactness of @xmath0 is seemingly `` lost '' . </S>",
    "<S> this procedure is well known in practical applications of fourier analysis , where often fourier series may be approximated by fourier transforms . </S>"
