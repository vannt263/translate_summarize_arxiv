    "diffusive shock acceleration ( dsa ) is the most promising mechanism for converting the kinetic energy of a supernova explosion into energetic particles @xcite and plays an important role in nonthermal emission during the overall process , ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    in the framework of dsa , an",
    "individual charged particle experiences many collisions with background electromagnetic waves and gains energy by shock crossing .",

    "shock acceleration by dsa in snr shocks is associated with transport processes , and some of the highest energy crs eventually escape from their acceleration sites by a so - called diffusion process due to interactions with turbulent magnetic fields . to analyse the diffusion process we have to determine the effective diffusion coefficient @xmath3 , and the understanding of @xmath3 is necessary to interpret many astronomical observations .",
    "several studies of escaping crs have already been done and a strong spatial correlation between tev emission and the molecular gas distribution at the galactic center has been observed @xcite . the pion - decay signature in snrs is believed to be evidence for protons accelerated in middle - aged snrs interacting with molecular clouds , @xcite .",

    "x - ray observations show that electrons are accelerated to highly relativistic energies in snr shocks @xcite .",
    "therefore , in order to understand the acceleration sites of crs , it is crucial to distinguish gev - tev emission from inverse compton scattering by cr electrons and the decay of neutral pions produced by inelastic collisions between cr protons and ambient thermal nuclei .    in this paper , we investigate the diffusion of crs using a hydrodynamics simulation of a strong shock wave propagating in a realistic multiphase interstellar medium and a one - phase medium .",

    "as we mentioned in section 2.2 , the electric field in the comoving frame of the ism vanishes in the ideal mhd limit .",
    "the strength of the electric field in the computation frame is smaller than the magnetic field strength by a factor of @xmath124 ( see equation ( [ eq : e ] ) ) . therefore , the force due to the electric field is small in comparison to the force due to magnetic field . in this section ,",
