    "observers usually rely on fitting spectral energy distributions ( seds ) , or other distinctive spectral features , with theoretical models to probe the physical properties of young stellar objects ( ysos ) , and possibly learn about star formation processes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "likewise , the spatial distribution of ysos contains valuable information about star formation , in particular the imprint of gravitational fragmentation in molecular clouds @xcite , or the spatial segregation between sources of different mass @xcite or evolutionary stage @xcite .",
    "the analysis of clustering properties is in fact complementary to the spectral approach in the sense that it relates to an entire population of objects rather than individual sources .",
    "this however calls for a very large sample of ysos .",
    "in addition , to probe the initial spatial distribution of forming stars , or rather star clusters @xcite , it is best to observe the youngest population of ysos before they diffuse away from their stellar nursery while the gas evaporates from the disrupting cloud @xcite .",
    "we plan to use the _ herschel space observatory _ @xcite , operating in the far - infrared / sub - millimeter regime and covering the peak emission of the youngest ysos , to study their clustering properties and tentatively relate the observed spatial distribution with different mechanisms of star formation .",
    "we will also search for correlations between clustering and yso physical properties - such as mass , temperature , evolutionary stage - as well as ysos immediate environment - density , radiation field , hii region .",
    "herschel will observe over 270 square degrees of the inner galactic plane as part of the hi - gal survey @xcite . with its unprecedented angular resolution , sensitivity and spatial coverage",
    ", we expect hi - gal to detect tens of thousands of sources .",
    "this will constitute a very large data set that should enable us to reach high statistical significance for identifying yso clustering trends . in this article we present a pilot study of our project based on the two 2@xmath02  fields centered in the galactic plane at longitudes @xmath1  and @xmath2  obtained during the science demonstration phase ( sdp ) of the herschel mission .",
    "the scope of this article is therefore more modest than if using the entire survey due to the lower statistics available ( only 3% of the survey was covered during the herschel sdp ) , yet it presents the methodology and associated diagnostic tools we have developed in preparation to exploiting the entire survey .    in section  [ sec : obs ] , we present the observations of the two sdp fields and the catalog of extracted sources we use in our analysis . in section  [ sec : mst ] , we describe our approach to characterize the spatial distribution of hi - gal sources using a minimum spanning tree algorithm and exploiting the heliocentric distance information recently obtained by the hi - gal consortium @xcite we discuss our results in section  [ sec : results ] , in particular the wavelength dependence we find on the clustering properties of the ysos , as well as the relation between clustering and cloud fragmentation , or the presence of hii regions .",

    "@xcite observed two @xmath3 square degree fields as part of the science demonstration phase of the mission in november  2009 .",
    "these two target fields were chosen from the herschel infrared galactic plane survey ( hi - gal , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and are approximately located on the galactic plane at longitudes @xmath1  and @xmath2 .",
    "observations were carried out in the spire / pacs parallel mode @xcite at fast scan speed ( 60/s ) in two orthogonal directions .",
    "this observing strategy provides simultaneous imaging in five bands centered at 70 , 160 , 250 , 350 , and 500  @xmath4 m , and an angular resolution varying from @xmath510  to 40 .",
    "the cross - scanned observations are used to preserve the extended emission from the interstellar medium ( ism ) during the map - making process .",
    "maps are created with the romagal algorithm ( traficante et al . ,",
    "submitted ) , and three - color images are presented in figure  1 and  2 of @xcite .",
    "the morphology of the @xmath1  field in herschel bands is mostly shaped by two luminous massive star - forming complexes , namely the mini - starburst w43 @xcite located in the inner arm of our galaxy at @xmath55.8  kpc from the sun , and the ultra compact hii region g29.96 - 0.02 ( hereafter g29 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) located at @xmath58  kpc .",
    "@xcite find an additional 23  hii regions in this 4  square degree field .",
    "the @xmath2  field is dominated by the large ob  association vul  @xmath6ob1 @xcite , located in the sagittarius arm at a distance of 2.3  kpc .",
    "source detection at these wavelengths is a complex task due to the rich structured backgrounds present in the galactic plane . @xcite",
    "have developed a method , based on the second derivatives of the maps , that filters out low spatial frequencies along multiple directions and reveals compact sources that exhibit strong signal gradients in the image .",
    "the photometry is then measured by fitting multiple gaussians to the detected groups of pixels that have a second derivative value above a given threshold ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "the source extraction is carried out independently at the five wavelengths .",
    "sources detected at 70 , 160 , 250 , 350 and 500  @xmath4 m are then band - merged , following the method described in @xcite , to form the source catalog that we use as a starting point for the spatial distribution analysis presented in this article .",
    "note that we will use the term _ single - wavelength source catalogs _ in section  [ sec : results ] when referring to single columns of the complete band - merged catalog , i.e. all the sources detected from a single image at a particular wavelength .",
    "table  [ tab : entries ] gives the numbers of sources extracted in both fields and in each herschel band individually , as well as the total number of sources in the band - merged catalog .",
    "furthermore , there has been a significant effort within the hi - gal consortium to measure the distance to most sources detected in the sdp fields in order to derive physical parameters such as the mass or the luminosity from the measured fluxes .",
    "distances were estimated using a multi - wavelength approach , exploiting both spectral line emission ( kinematic distances ) as well as extinction maps , parallax measurements , and physical connection with objects at known distances .",
    "details of the methodology are described in @xcite . in total , over 2000 sources ( @xmath790% ) possesses a distance estimate .",

    "several mathematical tools are available to characterize the spatial distribution of a set of localized points , e.g. the two - point correlation function , the nearest - neighbor filtering , the minimum spanning tree , the mean surface density of companion , the voronoi tessellation , etc .",
    "all these methods have been successfully applied to astronomical data sets to detect yso clusters in star forming regions @xcite .",
    "the process of cluster identification always requires the determination of a threshold to isolate source overdensities from the underlying population of distributed objects .",
    "this threshold can take the form of a cutoff source surface density or a cutoff source separation , depending on the chosen approach , and it plays a crucial role in deriving cluster properties . here",
    "the term _ cluster _ is used to designate source overdensities that contrast against the distribution of field objects . in the following analysis , the assignment of cluster membership is solely based on morphological grounds , without any kinematic information . consequently , the detected clusters might be gravitationally bound entities as well as loose associations simply tracing regions of star formation as defined by @xcite",
    ".    in general the characterization of spatial distributions remains vague and imprecise .",
    "for instance , from a census of recent studies , @xcite point out that the fraction of sources in clusters can vary from 40  to 90% depending on the adopted definition of a cluster .",
    "furthermore , @xcite has conducted a quantitative comparison of 4  different algorithms to identify star clusters in a field , and they all exhibit variable efficiencies depending on the size and character of the investigated area and the purpose of the study .    in the present article ,",
    "we follow the methodology presented in @xcite to study the spatial distribution of the hi - gal data set .",
    "@xcite argue in favor of the minimum spanning tree ( mst ) algorithm for several reasons : ( 1 ) the ` overdensity ' threshold is derived in a systematic manner from the data itself , ( 2 ) it creates fully connected entities rather than islands of isolated groups with few sources as with the nearest - neighbor approach , and ( 3 ) there is no inherent smoothing associated with the mst analysis so that there is no bias with regard to the shapes of the clusters one can isolate .      throughout the remainder of our source clustering analysis , the spatial distribution of the observed sources",
    "is systematically compared to a control distribution that exhibits no clustering properties , apart from the confinement of sources within the galactic plane .",
    "this control distribution is used as a reference to help interpret our results .",
    "it has the same spatial coverage , and contains as many sources , as the observed fields .",
    "it is generated by drawing the galactic longitude coordinate from a constant probability distribution , i.e. source aggregates are solely of statistical origins , and the galactic latitude coordinate from a gaussian distribution in order to reproduce a representative source overdensity in the galactic plane @xcite .",
    "sources separated by less than 6  are removed from the control distribution to account for the limited spatial resolution of the herschel telescope at 70  @xmath4 m .",
    "this represents about 0.5% of the total number of sources and this has a minimal impact on the shape of the distribution .",
    "figure  [ fig : distrib ] presents the spatial distribution of the sources detected in the @xmath1  field at 70  @xmath4 m as well as the associated control distribution .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "we have characterized the spatial distribution of far - infrared sources in the 2  hi - gal sdp fields .",
    "we first derived reciprocal distance matrices , then we built minimum spanning trees including the heliocentric distance estimates necessary to separate clusters along the line of sight . following the formalism of @xcite we have identified and characterized 21  clusters across the 2  fields .",
    "the 3  largest associations have more than 100  members and contain over a third of all the detected sources .",
    "the clusters are mildly elongated , with radii in the range 1 to 20  pc , and a median density of 2 sources.arcmin@xmath8 .",
    "half of the clusters are likely associated with hii regions , and most irdcs in the sdp fields are associated with clustered sources .",
    "however we were unable to evidence the imprint of fragmentation in molecular clouds further than @xmath51  kpc due to the limited angular resolution and sensitivity of the survey .",
    "nevertheless our analysis revealed the existence of 2  populations of ysos with distinct clustering properties : short - wavelength sources tend to be clustered in dense and compact groups while long - wavelength sources are clustered in looser and larger groups , with a somewhat continuous evolution between these two clustering regimes as the wavelength increases .",
    "this remarkable result is based solely on monochromatic source density maps and minimum spanning trees , and any interpretation would be speculative at this point . we rather need to derive the physical properties of hi - gal sources , characterize the spatial distribution of the different classes of ysos according to their evolutionary stage for instance , and look for similar spatial segregation effects .",
    "however the task of fitting seds in such crowded fields is very difficult due to the larger beam at longer wavelengths .",
    "our team is now working on improving the reliability of sed fitting in dense clusters .",
    "we have exploited only 3% of the hi - gal survey in the present analysis . with the remaining 260  square degrees to be covered by hi - gal , and",
    "better tools for characterizing the physical properties of ysos , we expect to harvest an unprecedented wealth of information with high statistical significance .",
    "we will study the cluster mass function , as opposed to the individual source mass function , and look for correlations between clustering properties and mass , evolutionary stage , environment and the galactocentric distance .",
    "in addition , the proposal for a hi - gal  ii survey has recently been accepted .",
    "it will cover @xmath9  square degrees of the outer galactic plane ( spread by 60  of galactic longitude on either side of the galactic anticenter ) .",
    "this will increase the statistics and allow us to probe a more quiescent part of the galaxy where the star forming regime might be different than the one observed with hi - gal .",
