    "the threshold theorem  @xcite is the central result of the theory of fault - tolerant quantum computation .",
    "it states that , provided the error rate per gate or time step is below some constant threshold value , then arbitrarily long quantum computations are possible with only polylogarithmic overhead .",
    "the threshold theorem tells us that large quantum computers are possible in principle , provided experimentalists can achieve an error rate below the threshold value .    naturally , then",
    ", it is of great interest to determine the precise physical assumptions which are needed for a threshold error rate to exist .",
    "some assumptions made in the simplest versions of the threshold theorem can certainly be relaxed .",
    "for instance , a threshold exists when gates are restricted to nearest - neighbor interactions  @xcite , or when the noise is due to very general weak interactions with a non - markovian environment  @xcite .",
    "other assumptions are truly needed .",
    "for instance , it must be possible to perform gates in parallel , and the noise process must not cause many qubits to fail simultaneously in a correlated way .",
    "one assumption that has been traditionally classified as required is the need for fresh ancilla qubits in the course of the computation .",
    "in the course of quantum error correction , ancilla qubits are introduced and used to record the error syndrome .",
    "this can be viewed as a refrigeration process , where entropy which has been introduced into the data qubits by the noise gets pumped out into the ancilla qubits , cooling down the data qubits . in order for this to work ,",
    "the ancilla qubits used must be cold themselves , or they can not absorb the extra entropy from the data . since ancilla qubits created at the beginning of the computation are themselves subject to the noise process , we can expect them to heat up over time , eventually making them worthless for refrigeration .",
    "based on this intuition , we expect to need a continual stream of new , freshly cooled ancilla qubits to keep the error correction running .    at a rigorous mathematical level , this intuition is supported by the result of @xcite , which showed that for noise in the form of a depolarizing channel , it is impossible to compute for longer than @xmath0 time .",
    "we study more general channels and reach a different conclusion .",
    "in particular , we prove the following main theorem .",
    "the precise statements for what the upper and lower bounds mean in each case are deferred to the appropriate sections .",
    "let @xmath1 be any non - unitary channel close to the identity , and consider quantum computations which suffer from noise @xmath1 on each qubit at each time step .",
    "up to unitary equivalence , the limit of repeatedly applying @xmath1 can be either a point or a diameter in the bloch sphere .",
    "is a dephasing channel followed by a unitary rotation , the limit point of @xmath1 applied repeatedly may be the center of the bloch sphere , but we still consider it to be part of the 2nd class .",
    "therefore , we choose the largest set of fixed points of a channel unitarily equivalent to @xmath1 .",
    "see section  [ sec : classification ] for more details . ]    1 .",
    "if the limit is the center of the bloch sphere , it is possible to compute for @xmath2 time steps .",
    "this is tight up to @xmath3 factors .",
    "an example of this class is the depolarizing channel .",
    "2 .   if the limit is a diameter , than it is possible to compute on @xmath4 qubits for @xmath5 time steps provided @xmath6 , and impossible even to store a single ( unknown ) qubit for more than @xmath7 time steps .",
    "an example of this class is the dephasing channel .",
    "3 .   if the limit is a point which is not the center of the bloch sphere , it is possible to compute for an exponential number of time steps .",
    "an example of this class is the amplitude damping channel .    for the third case",
    ", we expect that it is not possible to compute for longer than exponential time , but we have not managed to prove this .",
    "the three classes of channels can also be characterized in terms of how they treat the entropy of a state .",
    "the depolarizing class causes entropy to increase for all states until it reaches the maximum for the completely mixed state . for the dephasing class of channels ,",
    "entropy is merely non - decreasing : for some states it increases , and for others it stays the same .",
    "for the amplitude damping class of channels , entropy can decrease under the channel .",
    "the result with the greatest practical significance is 3 , as it enables quantum computation without fresh qubits .",
    "this does nt really violate the intuition discussed above , it is just that for this class of channels , we can use the noise itself to cool the ancilla qubits .",
    "the rest of the paper is devoted to proving the main theorem .",
    "here we give some intuition to the proofs of 1 - 3 .",
    "* * limit(@xmath1 ) is the center of the bloch sphere : * the proof is just a slight generalization of @xcite , and uses the same techniques .",
    "* * limit(@xmath1 ) is a diameter : * the noise is equivalent to the phase damping channel .",
    "computing for @xmath5 time steps can be done by running the computation on @xmath8 qubits , leaving @xmath9 qubits in the state @xmath10 ( or some other pure state which is unaffected by the noise ) . at each stage of the computation it is possible to take fresh qubits which were unaffected by the noise . since at most @xmath11 qubits",
    "are needed every step , the computation can go for time @xmath12 ( theorem [ thm : dephasinglower ] ) .",
    "+ proving the other direction is a little tricky , as it is not clear how fast the entropy rises .",
    "we will show that it is impossible to store half of an epr pair for more than @xmath7 time . to do this ,",
    "we take advantage of the fact that the entropy can not decrease . therefore ,",
    "if the state is stored for a long time , there must be some time step during which the entropy rises very little .",
    "for the dephasing channel , this can only happen if the qubits are essentially unentangled and diagonal in the standard basis .",
    "in particular , further dephasing will have little effect on them .",
    "but a completely dephased state has no entanglement with the outside world at all , and therefore we have failed to maintain the epr pair .",
    "* * limit(@xmath1 ) is a point which is not the center of the sphere : * in this model we use @xmath13 qubits instead of @xmath14 qubits , and divide the system into three parts .",
    "+ the first part is just a standard compilation of the original circuit to a fault - tolerant computation , just as if fresh ancillas were available .",
    "denote by @xmath15 the number of qubits which the fault tolerant computation uses .",
    "we have that @xmath16 , and that at each step the fault tolerant circuit asks for at most @xmath15 fresh ancilla qubits .",
    "+ the second part of the computation is a storage house .",
    "this part holds @xmath17 chunks of data .",
    "the size of each chunk is @xmath18 , and at each stage of the computation @xmath15 chunks are passed to the refrigerator .",
    "+ the last part is the refrigerator , which is actually built of @xmath19 refrigeration units which work in parallel .",
    "each such unit takes a typical sequence of @xmath18 qubits ( where each qubit in the sequence is very similar to the limit of @xmath1 ) , and condenses the entropy to @xmath20 qubits and to a fresh qubit .",
    "then the refrigerator passes @xmath15 qubits to the computation , which uses as many as it needs .",
    "the dirty qubits left over from the refrigerator , the qubits used up by the computation , and any unused fresh qubits are recycled by being sent back to the storage house .",
    "+ the constant @xmath18 is chosen so that it will be possible to condense the entropy .",
    "@xmath21 is chosen such that after @xmath21 applications of @xmath1 the qubit will be close enough to the limit of @xmath1 .",
    "we take the noise to be weak enough so that not too many mistakes occur during the process in which the refrigerator condenses the entropy .",
    "we only state a few fundamental results in this field which are important for our constructions .",
    "the first and foremost important results are the threshold proofs . @xcite and @xcite",
    "prove that quantum computation is possible under any noisy channel if the channel is weak enough ( but still a constant ) , and if fresh qubits are introduced . @xcite and @xcite also proved the threshold theorem , but only for stochastic noise .",
    "there exists a constant _ threshold _ value @xmath22 with the following property : suppose a computation undergoes noise @xmath1 at each location ( each gate and each time step ) , with @xmath23 .",
    "then given any quantum circuit with depth @xmath24 acting on @xmath14 qubits , there exists a fault - tolerant simulation of the circuit whose output has statistical distance at most @xmath25 away from that of the ideal circuit .",
    "the fault - tolerant simulation uses @xmath26 qubits and has depth @xmath27 .",
    "an assumption of the threshold theorem is that fresh ancilla qubits can be supplied at each step . if those ancilla qubits are not available , the threshold theorem no longer directly applies .",
    "@xmath28 is the diamond norm  @xcite , equivalent in this case to the completely bounded operator norm .",
    "our paper can be viewed as a generalization of @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that for the depolarizing channel , computation is impossible for more than @xmath29 steps .",
    "razborov  @xcite used a similar argument to show that a very noisy channel is useless .",
    "these two results could create the false impression that quantum computation is impossible without the introduction of fresh qubits . to the best of our knowledge , phase damping , amplitude damping , or more complex kinds of noise did not receive a full treatment .",
    "we will work in a model in which gates are perfect , but after each time step , each qubit undergoes a single - qubit channel @xmath1 .",
    "thus , we alternate layers consisting of gates with layers consisting of noise .",
    "every qubit undergoes the same noise at each time step , and there is no memory or correlation between different qubits or different time steps .",
    "one could consider more complicated models in which qubits undergo different kinds of noise depending on the gates performed on them ( i.e. , allowing gate errors ) , or in which different qubits have different error models , but we believe this would simply add complication without fundamentally changing the results .",
    "the lower bounds ( showing that computation is possible for a certain amount of time ) are proven by allowing arbitrary single - qubit and two - qubit gates in parallel at each time step , as is usual for fault - tolerant constructions .",
    "the upper bounds ( showing that computation is impossible for more than a certain amount of time ) are more generous , and allow arbitrary many - qubit unitaries between the applications of noise at each time step .    because the only control available to us is via unitary gates , it is not possible to measure error syndromes and perform corrections based on classical processing of the outcome .",
    "however , @xcite showed that a threshold still exists when all control is via unitary gates and measurement in the middle of the computation is not possible .",
    "therefore , we will use this version of the threshold theorem throughout the paper .",
    "using the bloch sphere representation of a qubit , any density matrix @xmath30 can be written as @xmath31 where @xmath32 is a real vector with norm @xmath33",
    "( i.e. , inside the bloch sphere ) and @xmath34 is the vector of pauli matrices @xmath35 . in this representation",
    ", the action of any quantum channel @xmath1 can be written  @xcite as @xmath36 , with @xmath37 \\right ) = \\frac{1}{2 } [ i + ( \\mathbf{t } + t \\mathbf{w } ) \\cdot \\sigma],\\ ] ] such that @xmath21 is diagonal . @xmath38",
    "iff the channel @xmath1 is unital ( meaning @xmath39 ) .",
    "that is , up to unitaries @xmath40 and @xmath41 , we can regard the channel as shifting the bloch vector @xmath32 and rescaling it in the @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 coordinate axes . in order for the channel to be positive",
    ", the output vector @xmath45 must also have norm at most @xmath46 .    in the future",
    ", we will ignore the unitaries @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "this is because they are single - qubit unitaries and can be absorbed into the gate layers before and after the noise .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath47 and @xmath48 , @xmath1 is actually unitary and there is no noise .",
    "there are unital maps ( the @xmath47 case ) for which all three eigenvalues of @xmath21 are less than @xmath46 . in this case , all vectors @xmath32 shrink towards the origin , and the only fixed point of the map is the center of the bloch sphere , the maximally mixed state .",
    "this gives us the first class of maps , including the _ depolarizing channel _ @xmath49 in fact , a map in this class is always a _ pauli channel _ , with probabilities @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 of errors @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 : @xmath53 we can express @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 in terms of the eigenvalues @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 of @xmath21 , for instance @xmath57 by  @xcite , @xmath58 for a completely positive map , so @xmath59 .",
    "therefore any unital qubit channel corresponds to a sensible pauli channel , up to unitary rotations .",
    "next , we can consider unital channels for which @xmath21 has one or two eigenvalues equal to @xmath46 .",
    "we may assume without loss of generality ( again , up to unitary rotations ) that the @xmath44 direction is one that is not contracted , so the @xmath44 eigenvalue @xmath60 .",
    "then , by  @xcite , in order for @xmath1 to be completely positive , @xmath61 .",
    "therefore , only one eigenvalue can be @xmath46 and the other two directions must contract by the same amount .",
    "this can be achieved with the _ dephasing channel _ @xmath62",
    "these channels leave the @xmath44 axis fixed and all other points contract towards it .",
    "this is the second class of channels .",
    "finally , we have non - unital channels .",
    "this is the third class of channels .",
    "one such channel is the _ amplitude damping channel _ @xmath63",
    "a qubit non - unital channel always has a unique fixed point : since @xmath64 and the output vector @xmath45 must have norm at most @xmath46 for all @xmath32 , it follows that @xmath21 has all eigenvalues strictly less than @xmath46 , so the map is strictly contractive .",
    "therefore it has a unique fixed point , which we can identify as the vector @xmath65",
    "in this section we prove that @xmath14 qubits suffice for a circuit of depth @xmath66 .    for the lower bound , we invoke a result from @xcite :    * theorem 4 from @xcite . * _ if a boolean function @xmath67 can be computed by a quantum circuit of size @xmath68 and depth @xmath69 , then @xmath67 can be computed by a noisy quantum circuit of size @xmath70 and depth @xmath71 .",
    "_    the theorem is stated only for depolarizing noise , but their proof works for any weak pauli channel , which , as discussed in section  [ sec : classification ] , covers all unital channels . basically , the argument is to continually purify ancillas by comparing them to each other with majority gates .",
    "the number of reliable ancillas available drops exponentially with time , which produces the exponential factor in the size .",
    "the purified ancillas are used to run a regular fault - tolerant protocol .",
    "the consequence of this theorem is that using @xmath14 qubits , it is possible to run any computation of @xmath72 depth .    to show that we can compute for a time at most @xmath0 , we can use essentially the same proof as for theorem 3 of @xcite .",

    "therefore , the true protocol will be very close to the one with a black box storage house .",
    "how close ? to figure this out , we need to determine the total number @xmath144 of qubits that get put through the storage house .",
    "since @xmath133 for a single qubit , the full protocol will be a distance at most @xmath145 from the one with a black box storage house . when @xmath144 is not too large , even though there may be residual correlations between the ancilla qubits exiting the storage house , the correlations are too weak to have a big effect on the protocol .    at each time step , the computation component uses at most @xmath15 ancillas , each of which must be output by a refrigerator protocol which uses @xmath18 qubits from the storage house .",
    "therefore , we need at most @xmath146 qubits to come out of the storage house at each time step , and there are at most @xmath147 time steps in the full fault - tolerant protocol , so @xmath148 .",
    "the overall protocol thus has distance at most @xmath136 from the black box protocol , which in turn outputs a final state with distance at most @xmath129 from the ideal protocol .    by choosing @xmath149 for any constant @xmath25",
    ", we therefore get a fault - tolerant protocol which outputs a state within distance @xmath25 of the correct output state , as desired . at any time",
    ", the computation component uses @xmath15 qubits , the storage house contains at most @xmath150 qubits , and the refrigerator contains at most @xmath151 qubits .",
    "therefore the total number of qubits used is at most @xmath152 .",
    "the depth blow - up of the computation is the same as for the usual fault - tolerant protocol ; that is , the depth is @xmath153 .",
    "while this protocol works to simulate a circuit of any depth @xmath124 , there is an overhead cost that depends polylogarithmically on @xmath124 .",
    "therefore , if @xmath124 is superexponential , the number of qubits needed will be superpolynomial .",
    "probably it is impossible to compute for more than exponential time ; for instance , for the amplitude damping channel , there is a probability at least @xmath154 at each time step that all qubits will relax to @xmath10 , leaving no remaining information about the input to the computation .",
    "however , we have not yet been able to prove this for a general non - unital channel .",
    "it is worth noting that theorem  [ thm : nonunital ] still holds when quantum gates are restricted to nearest - neighbor interactions with a two - dimensional geometry , but we are not certain if it holds or not for a one - dimensional architecture . to implement the procedure in two dimensions",
    ", we lay out the `` computation '' component of the system along a line .",
    "it is possible to do this and still have a threshold error rate for fault tolerance  @xcite .",
    "the ancilla qubits needed for operations on each block of the quantum error - correcting code used in the protocol are prepared in a strip of constant width laid out orthogonal to the computation qubits , as in figure  [ fig : local ] .",
    "each strip contains a separate `` storage '' component and `` refrigerator '' component . in the context of a concatenated code ,",
    "only the ancillas needed for operations at the lowest - level blocks need to be reset  higher - level ancilla qubits are built up from individual physical qubits , and when the physical qubits are nearly pure , the higher - level ancillas can be made from them in the usual way .",
    "each strip is itself divided into two halves . in one half",
    ", qubits are moved away from the computation component by one place each time step . in the other half",
    ", qubits are moved one step closer to the computational component at each time step . at the end of the strip away from the computation component ,",
    "qubits are shifted from the half of the strip moving away to the half moving towards the computational component .",
    "thus , if there were no other operations going on , qubits would travel to the end of the strip and then come back . the part of the strip moving away , and perhaps part of the half returning to the computational component , is devoted to the storage component .",
    "qubits in it undergo no operations beyond moving along the strip .",
    "we make the strip sufficiently long so that qubits remain in the storage house for a long enough time @xmath21 to be close to the fixed point @xmath123 .",
    "the last part of the returning half of the strip implements the refrigerator component .",
    "the algorithmic cooling used in the refrigerator uses only a constant size circuit to prepare a constant number of ancillas ( which is all that is needed for a single time step for a single block of the quantum error - correcting code ) , so a strip of constant width is adequate for this purpose .",
    "once qubits in the strip have reached the computational component , they have been separated out into `` reset '' qubits , which are almost pure and can be used as ancillas in the computation , and `` waste '' qubits , which are returned to the storage house in the outgoing half of the strip .    in one dimension , this strategy does nt appear to work .",
    "we could attempt to intersperse level @xmath46 computational blocks with storage and fridge blocks , but as the error rate gets small , the storage house must get bigger and bigger since it takes longer for qubits to relax to the fixed point of the channel .",
    "this means the computational blocks get further and further apart , making it costly to do gates between them , which in turn means the error rate for logical gates is higher , offsetting the advantage of the fault - tolerant protocol .",
    "it is not clear if there is a cleverer approach which allows exponentially long computations in one dimension with non - unital noise .",
    "note also that in this design , we are assuming that the original circuit to be simulated is laid out using nearest - neighbor gates in one dimension , yet we are implementing it in two dimensions .",
    "if the ideal circuit is instead given to us in a two- or higher - dimensional layout , we have two choices .",
    "either we can use the approach above and add one dimension to the layout for the storage house and refrigerator components , or we can rewrite the ideal circuit into a one - dimensional one and then implement it in two dimensions .",
    "the latter choice potentially incurs an @xmath155 blow - up in the depth of the circuit .",
    "it may be that there is an alternative approach to simulate two - dimensional circuits without fresh ancillas without adding a dimension and with only polylog overhead .",
    "we have shown that the usual claim that a quantum computation needs fresh ancilla qubits supplied from the outside is not completely correct .",
    "rather , we have shown that if the noise in the system is non - unital , then we can co - opt the noise to create fresh ancilla qubits , allowing us to recycle qubits and perform computation even in an otherwise closed system .",
    "we can do this because non - unital noise provides some cooling , taking a maximally mixed state to a less mixed state . for instance , if the system is in thermal contact with a cold bath , qubits left in the storage house will tend to equilibrate to the temperature of the bath .",
    "viewed this way , of course the system is not truly closed , but it is open in only a single limited way .",
    "moreover , our protocol works for _ any _ fixed point of the non - unital map .",
    "therefore , even a very hot bath , provided it is at finite temperature , can provide enough cooling to leverage into a full - blown fault - tolerant computation .",
    "of course , the overhead is very high when the fixed point @xmath123 is close to maximally mixed , but it is perhaps surprising that it can still be done at all .",
    "one might instead have expected a threshold temperature above which the system is too hot to compute .",
    "there is a threshold _ error strength _ , but that is a constraint on the coupling to the bath rather than the temperature of the bath .    the dephasing class of channels is another interesting case , sitting on the borderline between the depolarizing class , for which long computations are impossible , and the amplitude damping class , for which computation is possible .",
    "a pure dephasing channel , with no other sources of noise at all , is physically improbable , but in many physical systems , dephasing is the dominant error source .",
    "this suggests that in early quantum computers , it might be sufficient to keep a stock of ancilla qubits from the start and use them up over the course of the computation  the polynomial overhead we derive for this case  and only resort to resetting ancilla qubits either via external control or internal refrigeration once larger quantum computers are built .",
    "indeed , this is the strategy already envisioned for many early quantum computers .",
    "the dephasing class is also subject to an interesting gap between the upper and lower bounds .",
    "certainly it is possible to store a single epr pair for @xmath156 time using a good qecc , but we have only been able to show that the upper bound on the storage time is @xmath7 .",
    "can this upper bound be improved , or is there some storage procedure that is better than the obvious one ?    finally , we have not considered channels for qudits of dimension greater than @xmath94 .",
    "we expect essentially the same classification to apply , based essentially on the `` best '' two - dimensional subspace for the channel .",
    "channels which have a single fixed point at the maximally mixed state should still make computation impossible , whereas non - unital channels should still provide some cooling and thus make it possible to run exponentially long quantum computations .",
    "unital channels which leave some pure states unchanged should act like the dephasing class , allowing polynomially - long quantum computations .",
    "however , qudit channels are more complicated than qubit channels , so we have not proven that these are all the possible behaviors .",
    "we would like to thank an anonymous referee for qip , who asked if the protocol still worked with local gates .",
