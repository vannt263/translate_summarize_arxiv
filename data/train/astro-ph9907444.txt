    "the origin of galaxy nuclear activity is of fundamental astrophysical importance .",
    "recent surveys suggest that a nonaxisymmetric component to the gravitational potential is necessary to start nuclear activity ( e.g. , moles , mrquez , & prez 1995 ) .",
    "evidence has mounted that galaxy interactions trigger activity in high - luminosity galaxies ( e.g. , sanders & mirabel 1996 ; bahcall et al . 1997 ; stockton 1998 ) .",
    "however , the evidence is less convincing in lower luminosity , interacting spiral galaxies .",
    "these are known to have higher star formation rates on the average than isolated galaxies ( e.g. , kennicutt & keel 1987 ; keel & van soest 1992 ) , but the role of galaxy interactions in triggering nuclear activity in seyfert galaxies is debated vigorously ( e.g. , dahari 1984 ; fuentes - williams & stocke 1988 ; dultzin - hacyan 1998 ; de  robertis , yee , & hayhoe 1998 ) .",
    "in low - luminosity active galaxies stellar bars may funnel gas down to the scale of the central engine .",
    "observations ( e.g. , quillen et al .",
    "1995 ; benedict , smith , & kenney 1996 ; regan , vogel , & teuben 1997 ) and numerical simulations ( e.g. , athanassoula 1992 ; friedli & benz 1993 , 1995 ; piner , stone , & teuben 1995 ) have shown that stellar bars can induce mass inflow at rates sufficient to fuel kpc - scale starbursts ( @xmath8 1 m@xmath9 yr@xmath10 ) . these results are consistent with the statistical excess of barred galaxies among starbursts ( hawarden et al . 1986 ; dressel 1988 ; arsenault 1989 ; martin 1995 ; ho 1996 ; huang et al .",
    "1996 ; see pompea & rieke 1990 and isobe & feigelson 1992 , however ) .",
    "it is unclear how these significant inflow rates can be sustained down to the nuclear scale to feed the agn , but simulations of `` bars within bars '' ( norman & silk 1983 ; shlosman , frank , & begelman 1989 ; wada & habe 1992 ; friedli & martinet 1993 ; heller & shlosman 1994 ; maciejewski & sparke 1997 ) and the detections of nested bars ( shaw et al .",

    "; regan & mulchaey 1999 ; martini & pogge 1999 ) are promising developments .    despite these efforts ,",
    "it is surprising to find little or no observational evidence for seyfert nuclei to occur preferentially in barred systems ( e.g. , mcleod & rieke 1995 ; heraudeau et al .",
    "1996 ; mulchaey & regan 1997 ) or for emission - line strengths of agns to depend on the presence of a bar ( ho , filippenko , & sargent 1997 ) . perhaps nuclear activity in unbarred galaxies was triggered by short - lived bars that have since disappeared .",
    "indeed , evolutionary models of disk galaxies suggest that stellar bars are transient features that form and dissolve over only a few orbital periods ( e.g. , hohl & zang 1979 ; miller & smith 1979 ; combes & sanders 1981 ; combes et al . 1990 ; pfenniger & friedli 1991 ; raha et al .",
    "1991 ; merritt & sellwood 1994 ; norman , sellwood , & hasan 1996 ) . in these scenarios ,",
    "a vertical instability in the bar kicks stars above the disk of the galaxy to produce boxy peanut - shaped bulges that eventually settle to become stellar spheroids .",
    "recent kinematic evidence for stellar bars in galaxies with boxy bulges has provided observational support for this scenario ( e.g. , bettoni & galletta 1994 ; kuijken & merrifield 1995 ; merrifield & kuijken 1999 ; bureau & freeman 1999 ) . secular dynamical evolution has also been invoked to explain correlations between disk and bulge properties ( e.g. , courteau , de jong , & broeils 1996 ) .",
    "however , these evolutionary scenarios remain virtually untested for active galaxies .",
    "_ morphological _ evidence for a barred seyfert galaxy with a boxy peanut - shaped bulge has recently been presented by quillen et al .",
    "the present paper will discuss the first unambiguous _",
    "evidence for a bar potential in two active galaxies with boxy bulges .",

    "a stellar bar in ngc  3079 has been posited ( e.g. , de vaucouleurs et al . 1991 ) , but such suggestions were often based on the morphology of the central region rather than on the kinematics . to date , the most detailed study of the stellar kinematics in the bulge indicates cylindrical rotation that can be explained without recourse to a non - axisymmetric distribution function ( shaw et al .",
    "however , merrifield & kuijken ( 1999 ) have recently argued for a bar based on the peculiar [ n  ii ] emission - line profiles along the major axis of ngc 3079 . the situation for ngc  4388 is equally ambiguous .",
    "recent k - band imaging by mcleod & rieke ( 1995 ) revealed a boxy bulge , but the nearly edge - on aspect of this galaxy prevented them from detecting the morphological signature of a bar .",
    "the two - dimensional velocity fields that we will present in this paper reveal unambiguously a bar potential in both ngc  3079 and ngc  4388 .",
    "contrary to previous work based on long - slit spectra ( e.g. , kuijken & merrifield 1995 ; merrifield & kuijken 1999 ; bureau & freeman 1999 ) , our detection of the bar potential in these two galaxies does not rely on an inner lindblad resonance ( @xmath11-like orbits ) or strong bar - induced shocks that split emission - line profiles when the bar is seen edge - on .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in  2 , we briefly describe the methods used to obtain and reduce the near - infrared images and optical fabry - perot observations .",
    "results on ngc  3079 and ngc  4388 are discussed in  3 and  4 , respectively . for each galaxy ,",
    "we first analyze the morphology of the stellar bulge and its degree of boxiness .",
    "next , we use the observed velocity field of the ionized gas to argue for a bar potential .",
    "self - consistent dynamical interpretation of the disk velocity field requires analysis of the surface photometry to constrain the mass distribution , a task beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "the models presented here are purely kinematical in nature , but they show the clear kinematic signature of bar streaming motions in both objects . in  5 , we discuss the implications of our results using the predictions of bar evolutionary models , and attempt to quantify how bars fuel the nuclear activity .",
    "we summarize our results in  6 along with future avenues of research .",

    "for the h@xmath13 + [ n  ii ] @xmath146548 , 6583 complex in ngc  3079 , an iterative fitting method was used whereby all parameters of the three gaussian profiles were first left unconstrained ( except for the [ n  ii ] @xmath126583/@xmath126548 ratio which was fixed to its quantum value , 2.98 ; osterbrock 1989 ) . the continuum levels and centroids of the h@xmath13 and [ n  ii ] profiles determined from this first iteration were then used as input parameters for a second iteration .",

    "the striking x - structure in the central region indicates a peanut - shaped bulge .",
    "although the boxiness of the bulge in this galaxy has been known for some time ( e.g. , shaw 1987 ; young , claussen , & scoville 1988 ; shaw et al .",
    "1993 ) , our infrared image emphasizes its importance by minimizing emission from the young stellar disk and the effects of dust .",
    "a detailed comparison of figure 1@xmath20 and figure 3 from vcb indicates that the lower portions of the x - shaped line - emitting filaments reported by vcb do _ not _ coincide spatially with the peanut - shaped residual observed at infrared wavelengths .",
    "the boxiness of the infrared isophotes is therefore unlikely to be due to hot dust or line emission from the x - shaped filaments .",
    "also visible in the residual image is a well - defined warp to the north - west .",
    "a southern warp may also be present , but broader spatial coverage is needed to see if it bends east ( `` integral sign '' warp ) or west ( warp with mirror symmetry with respect to the minor axis ) .",
    "the distributions of line - emitting ( vcb ) and h  i gas ( irwin & seaquist 1991 ) strongly favor the former orientation .",
    "finally , note the large residual nuclear core and disk in figure 1@xmath33 .",
    "this nuclear disk coincides roughly with the molecular disk and nuclear starburst in this galaxy ( lawrence et al .",

    "the uncertainty on these velocities is @xmath2 35 km s@xmath10 in the brighter disk h  ii regions , but may be 2 - 3 times larger in the fainter material outside of the disk .",
    "the h@xmath13 and [ n  ii ] @xmath126583 velocity fields shown in figures 2@xmath24 and 2@xmath23 generally agree within these errors .    in these figures",

    ". a systemic velocity of @xmath2 1150 @xmath22 25 km s@xmath10 is derived from this rotation curve .",
    "this value agrees well with estimates from other optical datasets ( e.g. , 1177 km s@xmath10 from humason et al .",
    "1956 ; 1150 km s@xmath10 from carozzi 1977 ) and co spectra ( e.g. , 1150 km s@xmath10 from sofue & irwin 1992 ) , but slightly exceeds the value derived from hi data ( e.g. , 1120 km s@xmath10 from rots 1980 ; 1125 km s@xmath10 from fisher & tully 1981 ; 1118 @xmath22 3 km s@xmath10 from staveley - smith & davies 1988 ; 1124 @xmath22 10 km s@xmath10 from irwin & seaquist 1991 ) .",
    "this apparent discrepancy is probably due to a slight asymmetry between the inner optical / co rotation curve ( @xmath36 8 kpc ) and the outer h  i rotation curve .",
    "first noted by sofue ( 1996 ) , this asymmetry may arise from a misaligned dark halo or tidal interaction with nearby companions such as ngc  3073 .",
    "the systemic velocity derived from optical spectra of the stellar bulge of ngc  3079 is closer to the hi value ( 1114 @xmath22 9 km s@xmath10 from shaw et al .",
    "1993 ) .",
    "well - defined ` tongues ' of highly redshifted ( blueshifted ) gas extend immediately south ( north ) of the nucleus .",
    "interestingly , these two ` tongues ' are slightly misaligned at the nucleus .",
    "the kinematic line of nodes also jumps 10@xmath3 clockwise on either side of the nucleus immediately outside the ` tongues ' ( @xmath37 2.5 kpc ; fig .",
    "2 ) , then twists slightly anti - clockwise .",
    "this complex behavior may arise from a combination of ( 1 ) a warp in the galactic disk , ( 2 ) patchy dust obscuration , ( 3 ) streaming motion along spiral arms , and ( 4 ) eccentric orbits aligned with a bar .",
    "although dust may contribute to the slight large - scale differences between the present optical data and the h  i data of irwin & seaquist ( 1991 ) , the near - perfect bisymmetry of the velocity field near the center of the galaxy strongly suggests that dust insignificantly affects the observed velocity field .",
    "similarly , the photometric warp detected on the outskirts of the galaxy at optical , infrared , and radio wavelengths , does not affect the kinematics of the gas inside a radius of @xmath2 8 kpc . finally , the coincidence between the clockwise shift in the kinematic line of nodes and the anti - clockwise `` spiral arms '' seen on the k@xmath17-band image of ngc 3079 ( fig .",
    "1@xmath20 ) in both the northern and southern sections of the disk is good evidence for elliptic streaming through the spiral arms .",
    "however , this type of streaming motion can not explain the peculiarities of the velocity field near the central region .    `",
    "twisting ' of the isovelocity contours in the central portion of galaxies often signals a bar potential ( e.g. , kalnajs 1978 ; roberts , huntley , & van albada 1979 ; sanders & tubbs 1980 ; schwarz 1981 ) .",
    "the nuclear offset between the two ` tongues ' in ngc  3079 can arise in this manner , as described next .",

    "kuijken & merrifield ( 1995 ) and , more recently , bureau & athanassoula ( 1999 ) have pointed out that the line - of - sight velocity distribution of both the gaseous and stellar components in barred potentials observed edge - on may be double - peaked and characterized by a `` figure - of - eight '' variation with radius out to roughly the end of the bar .",

    "the co - existence of stellar bars and boxy bulges in ngc  3079 and ngc  4388 brings additional observational support to evolutionary models which posit that box / peanut - shaped bulges of disk galaxies arise from a vertical instability in bars . given bars in both galaxies , there is no need to invoke accretion to explain the boxy bulges in these galaxies ( e.g. , may , van  albada , & norman 1985 ; binney & petrou 1985 ; rowley 1986 , 1988 ) .",
    "note , however , that we can not exclude the possibility that each bar was created by a galaxy interaction or merger and then evolved into a boxy bulge through the bar - buckling instability ( e.g. , noguchi 1987 ; gerin , combes , & athanassoula 1990 ; hernquist , heyl , & spergel 1993 ; mihos et al .",

    "the bulge may form even quicker if the bar is subject to bending or fire - hose instabilities ( raha et al .",

    "the boxy bulges in both ngc  3079 and ngc  4388 were therefore formed over @xmath4110@xmath53 yrs .",
    "the rate of bar heating / bulge formation is also a strong function of the central mass concentration in these galaxies ( e.g. , norman , may , & van albada 1985 ; hasan & norman 1990 ; friedli & pfenniger 1991 ; friedli & benz 1993 , 1995 ; hasan , pfenniger , & norman 1993 ; norman , sellwood , & hasan 1996 ; merritt & quinlan 1998 ; sellwood & moore 1999 ) .",

    "an estimate of the core mass can be derived assuming the nuclear activity is due to accretion around a black hole of mass comparable to that of the galaxy core .",
    "recent compilations of black hole masses ( kormendy et al .",

    "the very presence of agn in ngc  3079 and ngc  4388 may _",
    "require _ @xmath58 to be smaller than the critical value for rapid bar dissolution because destruction of the bar would end mass accretion onto the nucleus ( see merritt 1998 ) .",
    "the short time scales that we derive suggest that we are unlikely to have caught the bars in the act of forming boxy bulges .",
    "this is probably also the case for most barred spirals with boxy bulges , given the large fraction of disk galaxies with strong bars ( @xmath2 35% ; e.g. , shaw 1987 ; sellwood & wilkinson 1993 ; mulchaey & regan 1997 ) and box - peanut bulges ( 20  45% ; e.g. , jarvis 1986 ; shaw 1987 ; de souza & dos anjos 1987 ; dettmar & barteldrees 1988 , 1990 ; see dwek et al .",

    "1990 for a counterexample ) .",
    "it is also possible that bar formation , dissolution , and bulge building recurs in disk galaxies .",
    "open - box simulations of disk galaxies with nearby companions show that tidal encounters can repeatedly form a bar throughout the life of a disk galaxy ( e.g. , sellwood & moore 1999 ) .",
    "stellar bars in ngc  3079 and ngc  4388 do not necessarily assure efficient fueling of the nuclear starbursts / agn .",
    "our kinematic models neglect hydrodynamical effects and therefore can not constrain the bar - induced mass inflow rates in these galaxies .",
    "several factors are important in determining if these bar - induced mass inflow rates suffice to power the observed nuclear activity .",
    "possibly relevant parameters include the strength and length of the bar , the gas mass - fraction and morphological type of the host galaxy , the star formation efficiency , the age of the bar , and the existence of ilrs near the nucleus . in this section ,",
    "we review briefly each of these possibilities in the context of ngc  3079 and ngc  4388 .",
    "surveys of barred galaxies find that those currently displaying the highest star formation activity have both strong and long bars ( e.g. , martin 1995 ; martinet & friedli 1997 ) . here",
    ", we follow martinet & friedli and define strong and long bars as having deprojected bar axis ratios @xmath59 and relative lengths @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the deprojected bar length and @xmath62 is the galaxy diameter at 25 mag arcsec@xmath63 .",
    "the high inclinations of ngc  3079 and ngc  4388 prevent us from determining photometrically the lengths and axis ratios of these bars , but the results from our analysis of the velocity fields ( table 2 ) constrain these values .",
    "assuming @xmath64 and using @xmath62 = 40 kpc for ngc  3079 and 27 kpc for ngc  4388",
    "( de vaucouleurs et al .",
    "1991 ) , we get relative lengths of @xmath2 0.18 and @xmath2 0.11 for ngc  3079 and ngc  4388 , respectively .",
    "the bar in ngc  3079 therefore is a borderline case while that of ngc  4388 appears to be a short bar .",
    "the strengths of the bars may be estimated using the derived eccentricity (= @xmath1 ) of the gas orbits in the inner ( @xmath65 ) portion of the bars .",
    "the bar in ngc  4388 would therefore be considered a strong bar while that in ngc  3079 is weak .",
    "note , however , that using the eccentricity of the gas orbits rather than that of the stellar orbits probably overestimates the strength of the stellar bar by factors of 2  3 ( e.g. , friedli & benz 1993 ) , so that even the bar in ngc  4388 may be relatively weak . the modest size and weakness of the stellar bars in both galaxies",
    "may prevent efficient fueling of their active nuclei .      that not all galaxies with strong and long bars are forming stars furiously ( martinet & friedli 1997 ) indicates that other parameters also affect the star formation rate in barred galaxies .",
    "the numerical simulations of friedli & benz ( 1995 ) suggest that the overall rate of star formation increases with gas mass - fraction of the galaxy .",
    "these authors found that a larger gas mass - fraction pushes the threshold for star formation to larger radii in the disk , thereby increasing the overall star formation rate .",
    "however , feedback between star formation and the release of mechanical energy from supernovae keeps the rate of star formation in the central regions relatively constant .",
    "this may explain why the correlation between gas mass - fraction and _ nuclear _ star - formation is more evident in early - type barred spirals , where star formation rates and feedback from supernovae are more modest ( e.g. , hawarden et al .",
    "1986 ; devereux 1987 ; dressel 1988 ; arsenault 1989 ; huang et al .",
    "1996 ) .    for ngc  3079 , little can therefore be said on the importance of the gas mass - fraction in determining bar - induced fueling .",
    "however , it is clear that the nuclear starburst in this galaxy has the potential to be long - lived regardless of the mass inflow rate induced by the bar .",
    "indeed , given the current star formation rate in the nucleus ( @xmath2 10  @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the fraction of the bolometric luminosity of ngc  3079 radiated by stars ; vcbtfs ) and the total mass of atomic and molecular gas observed in the galaxy _ core _",
    "( irwin & seaquist 1991 ) , star formation will deplete gas in the nuclear region of ngc  3079 in @xmath68 @xmath69 10@xmath53 yrs .",
    "bar - induced inflow would increase this time .",
    "the situation in ngc  4388 is less clear because the nuclear activity appears to be powered by an agn rather than a starburst .",
    "we are unaware of numerical simulations that address the effects of gas mass - fraction or morphological type on the level of agn activity .",
    "self - consistent evolutionary models of barred galaxies by friedli & benz ( 1995 ) , martinet & friedli ( 1997 ) and martin & friedli ( 1997 ) suggest that both the total and nuclear star formation rates in galaxies with strong ( weak ) bars peak @xmath41 1 ( 2 ) gyr after the bar instability starts .",
    "the _ relative _ importance of nuclear star formation increases more than tenfold over that time span . according to strong ( weak ) bar simulations , young barred galaxies",
    "[ @xmath41 0.5 ( 1.0 ) gyrs ; type a in the nomenclature of martin & friedli 1997 ] are characterized by chains of bright hii regions near strong shocks along the bar with no star formation activity in the nucleus , while old barred galaxies [ @xmath8 0.8 ( 1.6 ) gyrs ; type c ] shows the opposite distribution .",
    "the discussion in  5.3.1 suggests that the time scales for the weak bar simulations are more likely to apply to the bars in ngc  3079 and ngc  4388 . in principle",
    ", the star formation distribution in these bars can therefore constrain the age of the bars and determine if the bar is old enough to fuel the observed nuclear activity . unfortunately , both ngc  3079 and ngc  4388 are highly inclined spirals and patchy dust obscuration affects the brightness of hii regions in these galaxies .",
    "qualitatively , we find that the bar region in ngc  3079 presents a larger number of bright hii regions than that of ngc  4388 , therefore suggesting that the stellar bar in ngc  3079 is less evolved than the one in ngc  4388 .",
    "perhaps it is more instructive to invert this argument and attempt to constrain the age of the bar by assuming that the nuclear activity in ngc  3079 and ngc  4388 is induced by the bar .",
    "then , the age of the bar should equal the sum of the starburst or agn lifetime and the delay between bar formation and the onset of nuclear activity .",
    "this situation may be particularly relevant to ngc  3079 , where a nuclear starburst seems to power the kpc - scale windblown superbubble ( vcbtfs ) .",
    "the dynamical time scale of the superbubble ( @xmath2 10@xmath70 yrs ; vcbtfs ) and starburst age ( 10@xmath71  10@xmath52 yrs ) determined from the optical spectrum of the nucleus ( vcbtfs ) are both considerably shorter than the predicted delay between bar formation and the onset of the starburst ( @xmath2 10@xmath53 yrs ) . if the starburst in ngc  3079 was triggered by the bar",
    ", this would imply that the bar is @xmath2 10@xmath53 yrs old .",
    "the age of the bar equals or exceeds the timescale that we derived in  5.2 for the formation of the boxy bulge in ngc  3079 .",
    "the situation is more complex in ngc  4388 , where the nuclear activity is almost certainly due to mass accretion onto a supermassive black hole rather than from a starburst .",
    "the ionized gas detected above the disk of ngc  4388 ( vbctm ) may be used to constrain the age of the agn in this galaxy .",
    "this extraplanar material appears to be outflowing from the nucleus with a characteristic dynamical time scale of @xmath2 2 @xmath18 10@xmath71 yrs .",
    "if no other outflows have occured in ngc  4388 , the dynamical time scale of the extraplanar material constrains the age of the agn to a few @xmath18 10@xmath71 yrs . once again , this is much shorter than the predicted delay between the epoch of bar formation and the onset of starburst activity predicted by numerical simulations .",
    "however , more relevant to ngc  4388 is the delay between the epoch of bar formation and the onset of agn activity .",
    "this delay depends critically on poorly constrained factors including star formation efficiency , the conversion efficiency of the kinetic energy injected from supernovae and stellar winds into gas motion ( if both these efficiencies are large , less material will be available to fuel the agn ) , and the time needed to transport material from the kpc - scale starburst down to the sub - pc scale of the agn accretion disk .",
    "simulations of agn fueling by bars ( e.g. , heller & shlosman 1994 ) suggest that intense starburst activity always precedes or coincides with agn activity .",
    "our data can therefore only place a lower limit of @xmath2 10@xmath53 yrs on the age of the bar in ngc  4388 .",
    "this is again consistent with the time scale that we derived for the formation of its boxy bulge .      in the self - consistent evolutionary models discussed in the previous section ,",
    "the ilrs appear at the end of the simulations once sufficient mass has inflowed .",
    "ilrs have important consequences on the fueling of the nuclear starburst and perhaps the agn .",
    "ilrs correspond to regions of orbit crowding associated with higher gas concentrations and sometimes accompanied by shocks ( e.g. , athanassoula 1992 ; piner et al .",
    "ilrs in barred galaxies often form a gas ring nearby ( e.g. , telesco , dressel , & wolstencroft 1993 ) .",
    "gas flows down the dust lane of the bar to the ilr , then most sprays back into the bar region at the point of contact of the nuclear ring and the dust lane ( e.g. , binney et al .",
    "1991 ; piner et al . 1995 ; regan et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "a galaxy can have zero , one , or two ilrs depending on its rotation curve and therefore on the detailed mass distribution . for a weak bar rotating with angular velocity @xmath72 in a galaxy",
    "in which stars at a galactocentric radius @xmath45 ( cylindrical coordinates ) orbit with angular velocity @xmath73 , an ilr at that radius for which the bar potential perturbs , or drives , the stars at a frequency equal to their natural ( or epicyclic ) frequency @xmath74 ; i.e. @xmath75 at ilr where ( e.g. , binney & tremaine 1987 ) : @xmath76 our discussion in  5.3.1 suggests that this weak bar approximation is realistic for both galaxies .",
    "unfortunately , we have no easy way to estimate @xmath72 in ngc  3079 and ngc  4388 .",
    "we assume that the corotation radius , @xmath77 where @xmath78 , coincides with the ends of the bar ( i.e. , @xmath79 ) , and derive @xmath72 @xmath51 60 km s@xmath10 kpc@xmath10 in ngc  3079 and @xmath72 @xmath51 105 km s@xmath10 kpc@xmath10 in ngc  4388 .",

    "instead we deprojected equation ( 3 ) using @xmath46 = 180 km s@xmath10 and @xmath13 = 0.1 arcsec@xmath10 .    the results of our calculations are shown in the lower panels of figures 9 and 10 . the adopted rotation curves are shown in the top panels of these figures .",
    "we find that neither galaxy has an ilr .",
    "this result is consistent with the presence of large amounts of gas in the cores ( @xmath41 1@xmath47 ) of these objects .",
    "the absence of an ilr may help the bar - induced mass inflows continue down to nuclear scales to fuel the agn and/or nuclear starburst .",
    "note , however , that the converse may be generally false : results from numerical simulations suggest that ilrs do not necessarily prevent transport of material toward the nucleus ( e.g. , friedli & benz 1993 ) .",
    "consequently , the absence of an ilr in galactic nuclei is probably not a necessary condition for efficient fueling of agn and nuclear starbursts .",
    "in this paper , we have presented the first direct kinematic evidence for bar potentials in two active galaxies with box / peanut - shaped bulges .",
    "the complete two - dimensional coverage of our fabry - perot spectra has allowed us to detect the kinematic signature of the bar potential without an ilr or strong bar shocks .",
    "our results provide observational support for bar evolutionary models where boxy bulges represent a critical transitional phase in the evolution of stellar bars into spheroidal bulges .",
    "we compared the predictions of these models with our data to determine that the boxy bulges in ngc  3079 and ngc  4388 probably formed over a time scale @xmath41 10@xmath53 yrs .",
    "this short time scale , if typical of all barred galaxies , is difficult to reconcile with the high frequency of bars and boxy bulges in galaxies unless ( 1 ) bars survive the epoch of boxy bulge formation , or ( 2 ) bar and boxy bulge formation recur in the life of disk galaxies .",
    "perhaps minor mergers reform a bar and feed new fuel to the host galaxy .",
    "stellar bars in ngc  3079 and ngc  4388 provide a mechanism for fueling the nuclear activity in these galaxies .",
    "however , we find no _ direct _ evidence that mass inflows induced by the bars suffice to power the nuclear activity in these objects .",
    "the bars in ngc  3079 and ngc  4388 are rather short and weak and may not be dynamically important enough to trigger the required mass inflows . using the velocity fields and bar kinematics derived from the fabry - perot data , we find that both galaxies lack inner lindblad resonances .",
    "this may explain the large quantities of gas found in the nuclei of these galaxies , and the fueling of these active galaxies down to a scale of 10 pc .",
    "however , our evaluation of the bar - induced fueling of the nuclear activity in these galaxies is severely limited by the current lack of simulations that attempt to relate the mass inflow rates outside @xmath2 10 pc with the processes affecting gas dynamics closer in .",
    "such simulations would be particularly relevant to ngc  4388 where the nuclear activity is probably due to an agn ( evidence for both a nuclear starburst and an agn exists in ngc  3079 ) .",

    "<S> the hawaii imaging fabry - perot interferometer was used on the canada - france - hawaii 3.6-m telescope and the university of hawaii 2.2-m telescope to derive the two - dimensional velocity field of the line - emitting gas in the disks of the sc galaxy ngc  3079 and the sb galaxy ngc  4388 . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to previous work based on long - slit data , the detection of the bar potential from the fabry - perot data does not rely on the existence of inner lindblad resonances or strong bar - induced shocks . </S>",
    "<S> simple kinematic models which approximate the intrinsic gas orbits as nonintersecting , inclined elliptical annuli that conserve angular momentum characterize the observed velocity fields . in ngc  3079 , bar streaming motions with moderately eccentric orbits ( @xmath0 = @xmath1 @xmath2 0.7 ) aligned along pa = 130@xmath3 intrinsic to the disk ( pa = 97@xmath3 on the sky ) are detected out to @xmath4 = 3.6 kpc . </S>",

    "<S> the observed `` spiral arms '' are produced by having the orbits become increasingly circular from the ends of the bar to the edge of the disk ( @xmath5 @xmath6 5 kpc ) , and the intrinsic bar pa shifting from 135@xmath3 to 90@xmath3 .    </S>",
