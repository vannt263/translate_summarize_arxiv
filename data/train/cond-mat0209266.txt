    "<S> we investigate critical wetting transitions for fluids adsorbed in wedge - like geometries where the substrate height varies as a power - law , @xmath0 , in one direction . </S>",
    "<S> as @xmath1 is increased from @xmath2 to @xmath3 the substrate shape is smoothly changed from a planar - wall to a linear wedge . </S>",
    "<S> the continuous wetting and filling transitions pertinent to these limiting geometries are known to have distinct phase boundaries and critical singularities . </S>",
    "<S> we predict that the intermediate critical wetting behaviour occurring for @xmath4 falls into one of _ three _ possible regimes depending on the values of @xmath5 and @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the unbinding behaviour is characterised by a high degree of non - universality , strongly anisotropic correlations and enhanced interfacial roughness . </S>",
    "<S> the shift in phase boundary and emergence of universal critical behaviour in the linear wedge limit is discussed in detail .    </S>",
    "<S> there is growing interest from theorists and experimentalists in fluid adsorption on micro - patterned and sculpted solid substrates @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> surface decoration and structure can substantially alter the character of fluid adsorption and lead to novel examples of interfacial phase transitions and enhanced fluctuation related effects . </S>",
    "<S> there is also strong evidence that there are fundamental connections between geometry - induced and fluctuation - induced interfacial phenomena at wedge filling transitions @xcite and also between wedge filling and unzipping transitions for doubled - stranded dna @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> + the purpose of the present article is to focus on interfacial adsorption in generalised 3d wedge shaped geometries , which are translationally invariant in one direction ( along the @xmath7 axis , say ) , but whose height above some reference plane varies as a power law @xmath0 , for large distances in the @xmath8 direction . we refer to this particular class of surface geometry as the gamma - wall which may be viewed as an example of deterministic roughness @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> note that by increasing the exponent @xmath1 the wall morphology can be changed smoothly from a planar substrate ( @xmath9 ) to a linear wedge ( @xmath10 ) and eventually to a parallel plate geometry ( @xmath11 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the adsorption properties and interfacial fluctuation effects in each of these geometries , corresponding to wetting @xcite , filling @xcite and capillary condensation @xcite , respectively , are very different to each other and have received considerable theoretical and experimental interest . </S>",
    "<S> the central question we ask here is , how do the wetting properties depend on the wall exponent @xmath1 ? for substrates that are completely wet by the fluid ( corresponding to vanishing contact angle @xmath12 ) , recent work @xcite has shown that the adsorption isotherms for the gamma wall show a sensitive dependence on @xmath1 , which facilitate the cross - over from continuous complete wetting ( @xmath9 ) to first - order capillary condensation ( @xmath11 ) phenomena , through a sequence of novel interfacial behaviours , which emerge at intermediate values of @xmath1 . here , we extend this study to the case where the ( planar ) substrate undergoes a continuous ( critical ) wetting transition at some temperature @xmath13 and ask how the phase boundary and critical exponents characteristic of the interfacial unbinding depend on @xmath1 . as we shall show this case is considerably more complex than the complete wetting scenario , due to the presence of large scale interfacial fluctuation effects , which gives rise to strongly non - universal critical behaviour and distinct fluctuation regimes </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the critical properties characteristic of these regimes are precisely those that allow us to understand the change in phase boundary and fluctuation - related properties , that occur as the wall morphology is changed from a planar substrate ( @xmath9 ) to a linear wedge ( @xmath10 ) . </S>",
    "<S> + consider the interface between a non - planar substrate modelled as an inert spectator phase , whose height is described by the a continuous function @xmath14 in the shape of a generalised wedge ( see figure [ fig : gammawall ] ) , with the power law behaviour described above . </S>",
    "<S> the substrate is in contact with a bulk vapour phase at temperature @xmath15 and pressure @xmath16 , which we will suppose is tuned to bulk two - phase coexistence @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> the _ planar _ wall - fluid interface ( corresponding to @xmath9 ) is taken to have a continuous wetting transition at temperature @xmath13 , at which the contact angle @xmath18 vanishes and the mean interfacial height @xmath19 diverges . </S>",
    "<S> the mean - field critical singularities occurring at the wetting transition are found by minimising the binding potential @xmath20 where @xmath21 , @xmath22 and the exponents @xmath16 , @xmath23 depend on the ranges of the intermolecular forces . </S>",
    "<S> the critical exponents describing the divergence of the mean interfacial height @xmath24 , roughness @xmath25 and parallel correlation length @xmath26 are given by the well known expressions @xmath27 and are not altered by thermal fluctuation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> note that the interfacial roughness @xmath28 is negligible compared to the wetting film thickness . also recall that the contact angle vanishes as @xmath29 , with @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> + elementary thermodynamic considerations , based on balancing bulk and surface tension contributions to the grand potential , show that the location of the surface phase boundary / wetting transition in the gamma - wall geometry depends qualitatively on the behaviour of @xmath31 , corresponding to the ratio of the total to planar ( projected ) area of the substrate . </S>",
    "<S> thus , for @xmath32 for which @xmath33 , the wetting phase boundary remains at @xmath34 , whilst for @xmath35 , for which @xmath36 , the wedge is completely filled by liquid ( gas ) at all temperatures such that @xmath18 is less ( greater ) than @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , for @xmath35 the wetting transition at bulk coexistence is superseded by a first - order capillary condensation - like phenomena . </S>",
    "<S> this is closely related to unbending phase transition occurring on corrugated surfaces @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> hereafter , we restrict our attention to the regime @xmath38 and focus on the fate of the planar wetting transition as @xmath1 is increased from @xmath2 to @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> + the critical behaviour occurring at the limit @xmath10 , corresponding to the filling of a linear wedge , is known in some detail @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> writing the wall - function @xmath39 , with @xmath40 the tilt angle , observe that the ratio @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> accordingly , the phase boundary for the wedge wetting ( filling ) is shifted and again thermodynamic arguments dictate that it occurs at a lower filling temperature @xmath42 , satisfying @xmath43 rather than @xmath44 @xcite . for planar substrates that undergo critical wetting transitions , </S>",
    "<S> the linear wedge filling transition is also continuous , but is characterised by critical exponents distinct to those at critical wetting @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> consider , for example , the divergence of the wedge mid - point interfacial height @xmath45 , mid - point roughness @xmath46 and correlation length @xmath47 , where the latter is measured along the wedge and @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> calculations based on effective interfacial models show that the criticality falls into two regimes @xcite . for @xmath49 </S>",
    "<S> the critical exponents belong to a filling mean - field ( fmf ) regime with critical exponents @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , in which the roughness is much smaller than the film thickness , @xmath53 . for @xmath54 , </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , there is a filling fluctuation ( ffl ) regime and the critical exponents take the universal values @xmath55 in this regime , @xmath56 and the interfacial fluctuations are controlled by an effective wedge wandering exponent , so that @xmath57 with @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> the universal value of @xmath59 implies that fluctuation effects , at the filling of a linear wedge , are always important and contrast sharply with those at planar wetting transition . </S>",
    "<S> + with these preliminaries aside , we can now precise the two central questions addressed in this paper . </S>",
    "<S> first , we introduce critical exponents for the mid - point height , roughness and correlation length as @xmath60 by the identifications @xmath61 where we have restricted ourselves to the ( unknown ) critical behaviour occurring in the range @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> then , in evaluating the full @xmath1 , @xmath16 and @xmath6 dependence of these critical exponents , we wish to understand two specific points ; * a * : how does the critical behaviour reflect the discontinuous shift of the phase boundary from @xmath12 to @xmath63 as @xmath64 ? * </S>",
    "<S> b * : how do the critical exponents change from their wetting to filling values ? </S>",
    "<S> in particular , are any combinations of critical exponents continuous in this limit and allow us to smoothly  </S>",
    "<S> turn on \" the fluctuation effects ? + the starting point for our calculations is the interfacial hamiltonian model @xmath65 </S>",
    "<S> \\,=\\,\\int \\int \\rmd x\\,\\rmd y \\left [ \\frac{\\sigma}{2 } \\left(\\nabla l \\right)^2 + w(l - z(x , y ) ) \\right ] , \\label{effham}\\ ] ] where @xmath66 is measured relative to the horizontal reference plane @xmath67 , @xmath68 denotes the stiffness ( surface tension ) of the unbinding liquid - vapour interface and @xmath69 is the binding potential ( [ binding ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the model is only valid for substrate height functions @xmath14 that have a shallow gradient @xmath70 and thus suffices to determine the critical behaviour in the regime of interest , @xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> the critical exponents are insensitive to the precise nature of the substrate shape near the @xmath72 line and the power - law shape may be cut off at some appropriate short - distance . + the results of our analytical and numerical studies show that the critical behaviour is strongly non - universal and depends sensitively on the values of @xmath5 and @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> we concentrate on the interpretation of these results , making brief mention of our calculational details @xcite at the end of our article . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig : phdiagr ] shows how the critical behaviour falls into three possible categories labelled the planar mean - field ( @xmath73mf ) , geometrical mean - field ( gmf ) and geometrical fluctuation ( gfl ) regimes , respectively . within the @xmath73mf regime , @xmath74 with @xmath75 the substrate shape does not alter the values of the wetting critical exponents and @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 are identical to @xmath79 , @xmath59 and @xmath80 shown in ( [ wetting ] ) . for @xmath81 , </S>",
    "<S> corresponding to the geometrical , gmf and gfl regimes , on the other hand , the wedge geometry alters the critical exponents from their planar values . in both these regimes </S>",
    "<S> the interfacial height diverges with a modified exponent @xmath82 note that the critical exponent @xmath83 , for @xmath81 , so that in the limit @xmath84 the mid - point height @xmath85 . in figure </S>",
    "<S> [ 5fig : logt - loglo-0.6 ] we show numerical results for the mid  point height for the case of non  retarded van der waals forces ( @xmath86 , @xmath87 ) and @xmath88 , for which we predict @xmath89 . </S>",
    "<S> notice that the initial divergence of the interfacial height is planar - like ( with critical exponent @xmath90 ) , but crosses over to the asymptotic geometrical result as @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> the boundary between the gmf and @xmath73mf regimes occurs when @xmath91 , so there is smooth cross  over in the critical behaviour for the interfacial height at the @xmath73mf / gmf separatrix . </S>",
    "<S> the gmf and gfl regimes are distinguished from each other by the behaviour of the correlation length critical exponents @xmath77 and @xmath78 . for @xmath49 </S>",
    "<S> the gmf regime extends from @xmath92 to the linear wedge limit @xmath93 . for @xmath54 , </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , the gmf regime terminates at @xmath94 , where @xmath95 within the gmf regime , the roughness is still small compared to the film thickness , but is larger than in the @xmath73mf regime and @xmath96 . </S>",
    "<S> there is pronounced non - universality in this regime with @xmath97 \\label{nuperp}\\ ] ] and @xmath98 there is a smooth change from the @xmath73mf to the gmf regime for the fluctuation critical exponents so that , at the separatrix , @xmath99 . for @xmath100 ( relevant for systems with @xmath54 only ) </S>",
    "<S> , corresponding to the gfl regime , on the other hand , the wedge wetting transition in the gamma wall is fluctuation dominated and we can identify @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the wedge wandering exponent for the gamma wall . </S>",
    "<S> thus , in the gfl regime one has simple scaling relations between the diverging lengthscales , @xmath103 . for systems with purely short - ranged forces </S>",
    "<S> , the gfl regime spans the entire range @xmath62 and @xmath104 . </S>",
    "<S> + returning to the more general case observe again there is smooth cross - over between the behaviour of the fluctuation critical exponents at the separatrix between the gmf and gfl regimes with , for example , @xmath105 . </S>",
    "<S> the geometrical regimes are also characterised by a strong degree of anisotropy , with the correlation length @xmath106 much greater than the lateral extent of the filled region @xmath107 . </S>",
    "<S> interfacial fluctuations within the gmf and gfl regimes are pseudo - one dimensional , in contrast with @xmath73mf regime . </S>",
    "<S> + at this point , a number of remarks are in order . </S>",
    "<S> + ( i ) the existence of three fluctuation regimes for critical wetting in the generalised wedge geometry contrasts with the case of complete wetting @xcite , for which there are only two and no significant enhancement of fluctuation effects . </S>",
    "<S> intriguingly , the number of regimes for critical and complete wetting in the gamma - wall wedge are the same as that induced by thermal ( or impurity induced ) fluctuation effects at planar critical and complete wetting transitions , respectively @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> + ( ii ) in the geometry affected regimes ( gmf and gfl ) , the equilibrium profile @xmath108 has a particularly simple structure which can be seen to directly lead to the critical exponent identification ( [ betagam ] ) . near the center of the wedge , the interface is flat and at near constant height @xmath109 . at some distance @xmath110 , </S>",
    "<S> the interface strikes the wall and thereafter closely follows its shape . </S>",
    "<S> the interfacial height at the wedge mid - point is determined by the simple condition that the local angle of incidence between the interface and wall is equal to the contact angle . </S>",
    "<S> observe that , as @xmath111 , the critical exponent for the interfacial height diverges . </S>",
    "<S> including amplitude factors , we find that the mid - point height diverges as @xmath112 , with @xmath113 a non - universal constant . as @xmath111 </S>",
    "<S> this implies that the height becomes macroscopic for all @xmath114 , which represents a shift of the phase boundary from @xmath115 to @xmath116 . </S>",
    "<S> this is equivalent to the shift of the phase boundary from @xmath12 to @xmath63 for linear wedge filling and answers our first question * a*. + ( iii ) some aspects of the interfacial fluctuations show a smooth change from wetting to filling - like behaviour , as @xmath1 is increased , and allow us to give a quantitative answer to question * b*. this is most simply seen in the wedge wandering exponent @xmath102 pertinent to the gfl regime , which generalises the linear wedge result @xmath58 . less obvious is the behaviour of the critical exponent ratio @xmath117 , which also recovers the linear wedge result , such that @xmath118 where the rhs is equal to @xmath119 and @xmath3 for @xmath49 and @xmath54 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> + for systems with non - retarded van der waals forces ( _ i.e. _ with binding potential exponents @xmath86 , @xmath87 ) we make the following predictions . </S>",
    "<S> the planar result pertinent to the standard critical wetting transition @xmath90 , @xmath120 and @xmath121 are unchanged within a @xmath73mf regime corresponding to @xmath122 . for @xmath123 </S>",
    "<S> the transition belongs to the gmf and the critical exponents are geometry sensitive . </S>",
    "<S> for example , at @xmath124 we predict @xmath125 the value of the roughness critical exponent @xmath126 is significant , since it is _ independent _ of the value of @xmath6 and is therefore also valid for tricritical wetting . </S>",
    "<S> this degree of universality is similar to the true universality of @xmath59 predicted for linear wedge filling . </S>",
    "<S> + to finish , we make brief mention of the methods used in our calculations . in both the @xmath73mf and gmf regimes </S>",
    "<S> the roughness is much smaller than the interfacial height and mean - field methods are appropriate . </S>",
    "<S> numerical results obtained by minimising ( [ effham ] ) are complemented by analytical approaches following approximate solution to the euler - lagrange equation , based on standard variational methods . </S>",
    "<S> this is straightforward in the gmf regime , since the profile has a particularly simple structure . </S>",
    "<S> the results for the correlation length critical exponent @xmath127 and roughness exponent @xmath59 were first obtained by solving the ornstein - zernike equation for the structure factor @xmath128 , corresponding to the fourier transform of the mid - point height - height correlation function @xmath129 with respect to wave - vectors along the wedge . </S>",
    "<S> the critical behaviour in the gmf and gfl regimes can also be described using an effective one - dimensional model hamiltonian @xmath130 $ ] , which describes the energy - cost of constrained interfacial configurations in terms of the mid - point height @xmath131 only . </S>",
    "<S> the model can be derived from the underlying interfacial model ( [ effham ] ) using standard methods , which have been previously applied to the linear wedge problem @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the dimensional reduction , explicit in this method , is justified by the extreme anisotropy of fluctuations in the gmf and gfl regimes as @xmath84 . </S>",
    "<S> + the reduced dimensional effective interfacial hamiltonian has the form @xmath132\\,=\\,\\int \\rmd y \\left [ \\sigma \\,l^{1/\\gamma } \\left(\\frac { \\rmd y } { \\rmd l } </S>",
    "<S> \\right)^2 + v_{\\gamma}(l ) \\right ] , \\label{effeone}\\ ] ] where @xmath133 is a non - universal constant ( proportional to @xmath68 ) and @xmath134 is the wedge binding potential . </S>",
    "<S> minimization of @xmath134 identically recovers the mean - field expression for @xmath135 in the @xmath73mf and gmf regimes . for large @xmath136 </S>",
    "<S> this has the expansion @xmath137 , \\label{last}\\ ] ] where @xmath138 and @xmath139 are non - universal constants . in the limit @xmath111 </S>",
    "<S> , we find @xmath140 and @xmath141 , so that both @xmath134 and ( [ effeone ] ) smoothly recover the linear wedge model considered in @xcite . from the one - dimensional model it is straightforward to derive all the critical exponents quoted earlier using standard methods . + in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have investigated the geometry dependence of critical wetting exponents for fluids adsorbed in power - law wedges . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that surface shape has both a stronger ( and subtler ) effect on critical wetting than complete wetting transitions , with criticality falling into three possible regimes which facilitate the crossover from planar wetting to linear wedge filling . </S>",
