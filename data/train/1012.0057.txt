    "recently topologically non - trivial superconductivity has been theoretically predicted to occur in two classes of systems with spin - orbit ( so ) coupling .",
    "they are : ( a ) so coupled semiconductors in which @xmath0-wave superconducting pair potential is induced by the proximity effect @xcite and ( b ) so coupled systems with superconductivity due to intrinsic @xmath0-wave pairing interaction @xcite .",
    "a third system - surface of a 3d strong topological insulator ( ti ) - can also support topological superconductivity when the latter is proximity induced @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will ignore the latter and concentrate only on ( a ) and ( b ) . in both classes ( a ) and ( b ) the so",
    "coupling is a consequence of the breakdown of the structural space inversion ( si ) symmetry .",
    "we will take the resultant so coupling to be of the rashba type .",
    "a system in class ( a ) can be artificially grown as a heterostructure consisting of a so coupled semiconductor in proximity contact with a @xmath0-wave superconductor @xcite .",
    "an example of class ( b ) is a non - centrosymmetric superconductor @xcite or an @xmath0-wave feshbach resonant system with an accompanying spin - orbit coupling and zeeman splitting both of which can be created in a cold fermion atomic system @xcite .",
    "there is also another class ( class ( c ) ) of topological superconductors with non - abelian statistics , which have been studied extensively in the recent literature . here",
    "the topological nature arises entirely from intrinsic chiral @xmath10-wave superconductivity without having any underlying @xmath0-wave superconductivity in the system .",
    "some examples of this class ( c ) are the even - denominator 5/2 fractional quantum hall effect @xcite , superconducting strontium ruthenate @xcite , a - phase of superfluid he-3 @xcite , and superfluid ultracold fermionic gases based directly on the @xmath10-wave feshbach resonance @xcite .",
    "these class ( c ) non - abelain superconductors are effectively equivalent to being spinless , i.e. completely spin - polarized , and are therefore immune to any zeeman splitting to the leading order .",
    "we do not discuss the class ( c ) systems in this paper since the main conceptual issue being addressed in this paper does not apply to these systems .",
    "the topologically non - trivial superconducting systems mentioned above are characterized by order parameter defects , such as a vortex and a sample edge , which carry a unique bound state at zero excitation energy @xcite .",
    "these bound zero energy modes , called majorana fermion modes after e. majorana @xcite , can actually be thought of as particles which are their own anti - particles @xcite . in other words , they are represented by second quantized operators @xmath11 which satisfy the hermiticity condition @xmath12 .",
    "this is strikingly different from the regular fermionic modes for which the second quantized operators @xmath13 . because of the existence of the zero - energy majorana modes , a 2d non - abelian topological superconductor with @xmath14 vortices each carrying a single majorana mode constitutes a system with a @xmath15-fold ground state degeneracy protected by an excitation gap @xcite .",
    "when a majorana fermion mode in a given order parameter defect is adiabatically moved ( braided ) around another majorana mode , the initial state transforms into another one which is a different linear combination in the same ground state manifold .",
    "these unitary transformations within the ground state manifold are manifestations of the non - abelian statistics of the majorana fermions .",
    "the non - abelian statistics of the majorana fermions has recently come under intense focus because of its potential application in fault tolerant topological quantum computation ( tqc ) @xcite .",
    "both 2d spin - orbit coupled superconducting films and its 1d version as quantum nanowires in a wire - network have been proposed as potential platforms for tqc @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will not discuss the majorana fermion modes or their potential application to tqc .",
    "instead we will focus on the bulk superconducting phases and the quantum phase transitions ( qpt ) by exploring the interplay of the spin - orbit coupling , zeeman splitting , and the @xmath0-wave pairing interactions .    both systems in classes ( a ) and ( b ) are in an ordinary ( non - topological ) superconducting phase in the absence of an externally imposed zeeman splitting .",
    "the zeeman splitting , which can be applied either by a parallel magnetic field @xcite or by the proximity effect of a nearby magnetic insulator @xcite , creates a gap between the two spin - orbit bands as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig0 ] . from mean field calculations",
    "@xcite it is clear that when such a zeeman splitting @xmath1 crosses a critical value , @xmath4 , where @xmath3 is the @xmath0-wave superconducting pair potential and @xmath16 is the chemical potential , the system makes a transition to a topological non - abelian superconducting phase .",
    "the critical zeeman splitting corresponds to the value at which the underlying fermi surface in the absence of superconductivity shifts from being at both so bands to occupying only the lower so band ( fig .",
    "[ fig0 ] ) .",
    "thus , at this value of the zeeman splitting , the underlying system changes from having two fermi surfaces ( one in each band ) to having just one .",
    "since @xmath16 usually far exceeds @xmath3 , the critical value of the zeeman splitting @xmath2 also far exceeds @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , in the absence of so coupling , @xmath2 far exceeds the zeeman splitting ( @xmath8 ) above which an @xmath0-wave pair potential should decay to zero .",
    "the loss of an @xmath0-wave pair potential due to a strong zeeman splitting is due to the fact that for @xmath17 forming a spin - singlet pair potential with zero net momentum is impossible ( for the discussion of topological phase transition induced by zeeman splitting we will ignore the states with non - zero values of the cooper pair momentum ) .",
    "now let us emphasize the fact that in both cases we consider in this paper ( superconducting pair potential proximity induced , and superconducting pair potential due to an intrinsic on - site pairing interaction ) , the pair potential is strictly @xmath0-wave in both the ordinary and the topologically non - trivial superconducting phases .",
    "the fact that the pair potential is @xmath0-wave when it is proximity induced from a @xmath0-wave superconductor is self - evident .",
    "that it remains @xmath0-wave ( and is not a mixture of @xmath0- and @xmath10-wave due to the so coupling ) even when the pair potential is due to an intrinsic on - site pairing interaction is not so obvious . in this case , the pure @xmath0-wave symmetry of the pair potential follows from the fact that the intrinsic pairing interaction we consider is spatially local , and thus forming a @xmath10-wave component of the pair potential is forbidden by the fermion anticommutation relation ( for a more detailed discussion see sec .",
    "since the pair potential is purely @xmath0-wave in both classes ( a ) and ( b ) and in both phases ( ordinary and topological ) in each , how an @xmath0-wave pair potential survives a strong zeeman splitting @xmath9 to realize the topologically non - trivial phase is the central conceptual question we address in this paper .    the basic conceptual issue being discussed here is the topic often alluded to as the chandrasekhar - clogston ( cc ) limit @xcite in ordinary @xmath0-wave superconductivity , which states , in effect , that an @xmath0-wave superconductor , where the cooper pairing is between spin - up and spin - down electrons near the fermi surface , can not withstand a zeeman splitting larger than the superconducting gap .",
    "this is because then spin splitting exceeds the superconducting gap energy , making it impossible for a superconducting ground state to develop . on first sight",
    ", it appears that the condition on the zeeman splitting needed for superconductivity in refs .",
    "[ 1 - 4 ] far exceeds this limit , thus destroying all superconductivity",
    "! this has caused some confusion about the very existence of the topological superconducting phase using either a heterostructure @xcite where @xmath0-wave superconductivity is induced by proximity effect or using so - coupled systems with intrinsic @xmath0-wave pairing interactions @xcite .",
    "the mean field calculations of ref .  [",
    "1 - 4 ] are not enough to resolve this question .",
    "this is because a mean field theory is not just a postulate to assume the existence of a mean field pair potential in the hamiltonian h as is done in these works ; one is also required to establish the finiteness of the pair potential by satisfying the self - consistent gap equation . in other words",
    ", we need to satisfy the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) self - consistent gap equation with a strong zeeman potential ( @xmath18 ) to check if a non - zero @xmath0-wave pair potential @xmath3 gives a consistent solution .",
    "this will ensure that the mean field h in refs .",
    "[ 1 - 4 ] is not flawed to begin with , and our bdg solution of the majorana fermion is not a spurious mathematical result with no physical connection . in this paper",
    "we perform this study by self - consistently solving the appropriate bcs gap equations in the presence of attractive @xmath0-wave pairing interaction , so coupling , and an externally applied zeeman splitting .",
    "_ note that satisfying such a gap equation is a requirement for superconducting pair potential when it is derived from the microscopic pairing interactions .",
    "however , when the pair potential is proximity induced on a spin - orbit coupled system by a nearby @xmath0-wave superconductor , the gap equation need not be satisfied . in this case ,",
    "the so coupled system simply ` inherits ' the pair potential of the nearby superconductor . _    for the case of intrinsic pairing interactions , we show that the @xmath0-wave pair potential indeed remains non - zero even beyond the zeeman splitting above which it would be lost in the absence of so coupling",
    ". in fact , in the non - abelian phase the non - zero value of the pair potential crucially depends on and _ increases _ with the so coupling constant , which is consistent with the fact that it is zero in the absence of the so coupling . a simple intuitive way to understand this starts by recalling how @xmath0-wave superconductivity is destroyed by a zeeman splitting . in the absence of so coupling ,",
    "the two spin bands are shifted by an energy gap proportional to the zeeman splitting @xmath1 . with increasing @xmath1 it becomes increasingly difficult for the system to create @xmath0-wave spin - singlet pairs with zero net momentum . finally , when @xmath1 crosses a value @xmath19 the @xmath0-wave pair potential vanishes .",
    "the critical zeeman splitting , @xmath4 , needed for the topological phase transition is thus squarely beyond the acceptable zeeman splitting the pair potential can sustain .",
    "it is now important to realize that , in the presence of the so coupling , the two spin - orbit bands can not simply be viewed as ` spin - up ' and ` spin - down ' bands . instead",
    ", they both have a non - zero minority spin amplitude coexisting with the majority spin component .",
    "therefore , even when the zeeman splitting is large enough to make the fermi surface lie only in the lower band , spin - singlet @xmath0-wave pairs can not be completely lost .",
    "if the superconductivity is due to an intrinsic pairing interaction the gap equation shows that the pair potential , though always non - zero , decays with increasing zeeman couplings .",
    "however , the magnitude of the pair potential in the non - abelian phase can be increased by increasing the magnitude of the spin - orbit coupling , which , therefore , enables a stable non - abelian phase in the phase diagram . on the other hand ,",
    "if the superconductivity is due to the proximity effect , there is no requirement of satisfying the self - consistent gap equation . in this case , which applies to the heterostructure geometry ,",
    "the superconducting pair potential is simply ` inherited ' from the adjacent @xmath0-wave superconductor ( sec .",
    "we assume that the quasi-2d electron system is described by the model hamiltonian @xmath20 where @xmath21 describes the bulk conduction electrons , @xmath22 is the spin - orbit interaction term , @xmath23 represents the zeeman coupling , and @xmath24 represents the electron - electron interaction .",
