    "the ground state of a gas of weakly attractively interacting fermions is a bcs state , in which most of the fermions behave ideally , but some of those near the fermi surface form something like a bose condensate of cooper pairs .",
    "as the extreme example of a gas of protons and electrons shows , however , stronger attractions instead produce a true condensate , of tightly bound composite bosons .",
    "current laboratory techniques exploit the atomic physics of collisional feshbach resonances @xcite to produce real ultracold gases in which attractions can be varied dramatically , admitting experimental study of the entire bcs - bec crossover @xcite .",
    "several labs can now produce molecular condensates from weakly interacting degenerate fermi gases , by adiabatically changing a control parameter ( typically a magnetic field ) .",
    "prospects for more precise and detailed measurements of this process and its products are good",
    ".    theoretical studies of this problem have so far focused mainly on equilibrium properties of systems with various fixed ( instantaneous ) values of the interaction parameter @xcite .",
    "up - to - date reviews can be found for example in @xcite . along with wide tunability of equilibrium parameters , however , controllable and observable non - equilibrium dynamics are a major advantage of cold quantum gases as experimental systems .",
    "the dynamics of cold , dilute quantum gases are of course comparatively simple . on the one hand",
    ", this dynamical simplicity may ultimately allow mesoscopic quantum gas systems to shed light on problems , such as the emergences of irreversibility and classicality , that are even more fundamental than the issue of which effective hamiltonian is correct .",
    "on the other hand , even for cold dilute gases , quantum many body theory can be difficult enough that understanding will require comparisons among experiments , phenomenological models , and first - principles calculations for simple cases .    in the present work we therefore develop a rigorous theory for weakly non - adiabatic evolution of a dilute quantum gas from bcs to bec regimes , via a time - dependent feshbach resonance , in the tractable limit of a narrow resonance .",
    "we show that for a finite effective resonance width ( e.g. created by a sufficiently large background scattering length ) , adiabaticity can in principle be maintained , as far as two - body dynamics are concerned , through the entire evolution .",
    "long - wavelength collective excitations will still be generated , as perfect many - body adiabaticity is not expected to be possible in an infinite system .",
    "our main result is a post - adiabatic hamiltonian that can describe the excitation of the ( andergoliubov modes : anderson - bogoliubov excitations on the bcs side and bogoliubov excitations on the bec side .",
    "excitation of these modes in a time - dependent bcs - bec crossover is an example of the general phenomenon of ( quasi-)particle production in a time - dependent background .",
    "similar situations can also be found in quite different contexts as , e.g.  in cosmology , where hawking radiation @xcite is produced in the classical space - time background of a star collapsing into a black hole .",
    "we will describe the former effect in our context with a post - adiabatic effective hamiltonian .",
    "post - adiabatic effective hamiltonians are also common in other physical contexts .",
    "perhaps the best known example describes the effect of ` geometric magnetism ' @xcite and its higher order corrections @xcite .",
    "the present paper may thus also be of value in expanding the application of post - adiabatic concepts to experimentally tractable many - body systems .",
    "this paper is organized as follows :    in section [ kap2 ] we introduce the bcs - bec crossover model and explain how we model the background scattering differently from the standard bcs theory approach . in order to simplify our analysis",
    "we introduce fermi units and work in momentum space .",
    "it is important to keep in mind that we will deliberately use path integral language in section [ molfer ] and section [ mapping ] , but only as a convenient tool to show the equivalence of two systems before we revert to operator language .",
    "in section [ molfer ] we consider molecules and atoms as interacting subsystems .",
    "the molecular subsystem is treated by a path integral approach whereas the atomic part is treated algebraically by means of a dilute gas approximation . in this context",
    ", the choice of initial and final conditions has to be adressed . after solving the atomic dynamics ,",
    "the results for the molecular dynamics are non - local in time and inconvenient for practical calculations .",
    "therefore , they are mapped onto a familiar quadratic bosonic system in section [ mapping ] .",
    "this is achieved by introducing new virtual bosons which mimic the fermionic subsystem .",
    "afterwards we can leave the path integral language for the molecular subsystem in favor of an effective hamiltonian operator .",
    "the newly obtained dummy hamiltonian is then diagonalized instantaneously in section [ inst ] by means of a bogoliubov transformation .",
    "we discuss the properties of mode functions and mode frequencies in general and especially in the case of low - energy excitations , and show some numerical results .    in section [ post ]",
    "we then use the mode functions and mode frequencies to rewrite the dummy hamiltonian in terms of instantaneous eigenmodes ( normal modes ) .",
    "the coupling between these eigenmodes is the leading post - adiabatic effect , and constitutes the main result of this paper .",
    "finally , we address the validity and consequences of our results in [ discussion ] .",
    "appendix [ classical ] contains a detailed derivation of the classical molecular background that populates the @xmath2 fourier mode in the adiabatic limit we assume for it .",
    "all our results explicitly depend on this classical molecular background .",
    "we use here a hamiltonian similar to those described in @xcite , which is based on a delta - like pseudopotential for a collisional interaction in which two fermionic atoms unite into a bosonic molecule ( or conversely , in which a molecule splits into two atoms ) .",
    "so our many - body hamiltonian appears in second - quantized notation as @xmath3\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is the fermion mass , @xmath5 is the external control parameter that is slowly ramped up in time ( usually linearly as @xmath6 for some slow rate @xmath7 ) , and @xmath8 is an interaction strength , determined by atomic collision physics , and indicating the width of the feshbach resonance .",
    "finally , @xmath9 is the strength of the scattering among the fermions , defining the bcs ground state as @xmath10 .",
    "it is important to state at this point that it is _ not _",
    "crucial for our calculations that @xmath8 and @xmath11 are time - independent or that @xmath12 has a linear behavior .",
    "instead , these could all be functions depending adiabatically slowly on time , as long as the first two can be approximated as constant , and the last as linearly time - dependent , within the period of significant non - adiabatic excitation .",
    "the annihilation and creation field operators @xmath13 and @xmath14 are bosonic , whereas @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the field operators of the fermions , with two spin states denoted by @xmath17 , @xmath18 .",
    "although the last term proportional to @xmath19 makes the hamiltonian look similar to a free energy , we still have the hamiltonian dynamics of a closed system .",
    "this term commutes with the rest of the hamiltonian at any time and does not affect the dynamics of the initial states considered here , apart from a trivial global phase .",
    "note that the hamiltonian is an example of an effective field theory and as such has to be understood as correctly renormalized .",
    "as always , the logic behind renormalization is the following : the hamiltonian is a model , anyway ; it must be tuned to yield the correct energy shifts .",
    "since these include higher order corrections , the bare hamiltonian parameters need counter terms .",
    "these sometimes ( as in our case ) turn out to be infinite . the only quantity which needs to be renormalized here in order to avoid an ultraviolet divergence is @xmath12 .",
    "we always assume that an extra counterterm @xmath20 has been added to @xmath12 , i.e.  the substitution @xmath21 has been done in order to maintain the physical meaning of @xmath22 as the fermionic energy shift compared to a free fermion .",
    "this is a standard procedure in field theories . in our calculations",
    ", we will usually transform the fermionic energy shift resulting from the counterterm into a purely bosonic energy shift by adding a term proportional to the conserved total number of particles to the hamiltonian .",
    "this is the same as replacing @xmath23 .    for large negative @xmath12 ,",
    "the ground state consists mainly of the standard bcs ground state ; for large positive @xmath12 , bosons dominate low energy states . for small @xmath12",
    ", however , the mediated interactions of either species alone formally diverge in strength .",
    "what this means is that the dynamics involves both species non - trivially ; if @xmath8 is small enough , no truly strong interactions are necessarily involved .",
    "we will therefore consider this small-@xmath8 limit , which is not typical for experiments so far conducted , but is also attainable with current techniques .",
    "( many different atomic species are trappable today , and each typically has several collisional feshbach resonances , some of which are very narrow . )",
    "the fermionic background scattering is the crucial ingredient in the conventional bcs theory , which is also the @xmath24 limit of our model . in derivations of the bcs theory , the dynamics",
    "is often described within a grassmann variables path integral . in this framework , the interaction among fermions is mimicked by the interaction with a hubbard ",
    "stratonovich field , introduced by the hubbard ",
    "stratonovich transformation .      rather than reviewing the hubbard ",
    "stratonovich approach , we emphasize that we take a somewhat different approach here which leads to the same kind of simplifications",
    ". we will mimic the fermionic background scattering with interaction with an off - resonant bosonic dummy field which can always be adiabatically eliminated .",
    "the fermion - fermion interaction term of the hamiltonian is then equivalent to : @xmath25    \\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this approach has an especially nice physical interpretation : the backgroud scattering originates from the interaction of the fermions with a second feshbach resonance that would create molecules in the @xmath26-modes .",
    "this second resonance , however , remains detuned during the whole bcs - bec crossover . for @xmath27 , the leading order effect of this interaction",
    "is just the fermion - fermion interaction in the hamiltonian .",
    "note that this leading order behavior mimicked by just one extra resonance could actually originate from a superposition of the leading order behavior of many different resonances , which would have the same effect .",
    "considering only the @xmath27 limit , the kinetic term and the finite energy shift @xmath28 in equation become so small compared to the detuning that they could be neglected completely in the following , making the whole procedure fully equivalent to the usual hubbard ",
    "stratonovich approach .",
    "however , it is useful to maintain the finite energy shift formally , since all terms proportional to @xmath29 reflect the gauge freedom due to the conservation of the total boson number plus one - half the fermion number .",
    "in contrast , keeping the kinetic term of the @xmath26-modes would lead to unnecessary complications , so we neglect it henceforth , as being small compared to the @xmath30 term .      the connection to the hubbard ",
    "stratonovich field is seen in the coherent state path integral representation for @xmath26 and @xmath31 : let us introduce new fields that are proportional to the c - number fields for @xmath26 and @xmath31 by a prefactor of order @xmath32 and let us perform the limit @xmath33 afterwards .",
    "the resulting action of the path integral would now show the familiar hubbard ",
    "stratonovich field terms of the bcs action , but written in terms of our newly defined fields .",
    "this rescaling is the reason why the operators @xmath26 and @xmath31 can be interpreted as physical bosonic modes whereas the hubbard  stratonovich field can not .",
    "the hubbard ",
    "stratonovich field thus corresponds to @xmath34 , up to a finite prefactor , as @xmath27 . in this limit",
    ", the expectation value of @xmath35 tends to @xmath36 , whereas that of @xmath37 remains finite .",
    "since we deal with fermions in the absence of an external spatial potential , it is very convenient to change into momentum space where the description of the fermions simplifies significantly .",
    "we transform to @xmath38-space using periodic boundary conditions in a symmetric cube of volume @xmath39 , @xmath40 with @xmath41 by replacing @xmath42 and by replacing @xmath26 following the same logic . the volume @xmath39 is assumed to tend to infinity .",
    "the resulting momentum space hamiltonian reads now @xmath43 we use the fermi momentum @xmath44 , the fermi energy @xmath45 as well as the fermi time @xmath46 in order to define @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 . in general",
    ", we consider here most of these quantities as time - independent .",
    "the conserved quantity @xmath52 is the total number of bosons , plus one - half the total number of fermions . in the case of a linear time dependence",
    "as described in the beginning , we have @xmath53 with @xmath54 .      the fermi momentum @xmath55 , the fermi energy @xmath56 and the corresponding fermi time @xmath57 are natural scales of the system . from now on",
    ", we will therefore use the dimensionless quantities @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 , and relabel them as @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 respectively .",
    "furthermore we will relabel again @xmath66 as @xmath67 , @xmath68 as @xmath69 , @xmath70 as @xmath71 , @xmath72 as @xmath73 , @xmath74 as @xmath75 and @xmath76 as @xmath77 .",
    "our hamiltonian involves two different interacting species , molecules and atoms .",
    "this suggests that we consider these as two subsystems , each of which can be treated with a different approach .",
    "this picture is especially useful since we can also adopt it in section [ mapping ] where the fermionic subsystem is replaced by a subsystem of virtual bosons .",
    "apart from their interaction , the molecular and the atomic subsystem both have quadratic hamiltonians .",
    "furthermore , even the interaction term would be quadratic as well , if the molecular operators were replaced with classical fields .",
    "since path integrals treat quantum fields as classical fields , this suggests a convenient hybrid approach to the problem , in which the molecule dynamics is described with a path integral over classical molecular fields , while the quadratic hamiltonian for the fermionic atoms is treated with canonical operator methods .",
    "we will formulate the time evolution of the molecules in terms of a coherent state path integral , which we will only begin to evaluate after solving the atomic problem with canonical operator methods .",
    "this will offer us an effective description of the molecular subsystem : @xmath78 \\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath79 we always denote the time evolution operator of the corresponding hamiltonian @xmath64 . the atomic initial and final states at @xmath80 and @xmath81 are denoted as @xmath82 and @xmath83 , respectively . the bar @xmath84 denotes complex conjugation .",
    "we use here _ unnormalized _ coherent states in a notation that highlights the property of the bra and ket states as eigenstates of the creation and annihilation operator , respectively : @xmath85 moreover , this notation makes it possible to read off the amplitudes for a creation and annihilation of excitations directly from an expansion of the transition matrix element in powers of @xmath86 and @xmath87 .      within the path integral",
    ", the hamiltonian @xmath64 contains the molecules merely as driving fields @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 , @xmath91 .",
    "the hamiltonian can then be split into two parts : the atomic part @xmath92 , which contains fermionic operators and the molecular part @xmath93 , which is a c - number whose non - trivial effect will be in the path integral : @xmath94 note that the fermionic operators make the construction of the path integral slightly more involved : unlike for the molecular mode path integration variables , for the fermionic operators the time ordering within the path integral really matters .",
    "this makes it necessary to calculate the time evolution operator @xmath95 as seen in equation .",
    "the atomic hamiltonian splits again into two parts of different character : the part @xmath96 , which describes atoms that couple just to @xmath97 molecular modes , and the part @xmath98 , which describes the coupling between atoms and all @xmath99 molecular modes : @xmath100 as the label @xmath101 suggests @xmath98 will turn out to be only a relatively small perturbation compared to other terms in @xmath64 .",
    "this is understandable if one considers slower and slower sweep rates : the small @xmath62 molecular modes will become more and more dominant , whereas the higher @xmath62-modes will become less and less populated .",
    "thus , the hamiltonian @xmath96 , containing the @xmath0 molecular modes , is the important part for slow sweep rates .",
    "this hamiltonian @xmath96 has a special feature : it can be decomposed into infinitely many two - level systems @xmath102 , as indicated by the label @xmath103 .",
    "the hamiltonians of these two - level systems are defined by @xmath104 and fullfil the commutation relation @xmath105}=0\\quad\\text{for}\\quad{{\\bf{q}}}\\neq{{\\bf{q ' } } }     \\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the latter is a sufficient condition for the dynamics to factorize and ensures that our decomposition is meaningful .      at this point",
    ", we have to address the choice of the initial and final bosonic and fermionic states in : we are interested in _ transition amplitudes _ of the full system between the _ ground state _ at @xmath106 and some _ arbitrary low energy state _ at @xmath107 . as @xmath108 the ground state tends to the purely fermionic bcs state as defined in appendix [ classical ] .",
    "note that despite @xmath109 as @xmath110 , the value of @xmath111 tends to its self consistent value proportional to the bcs order parameter .",
    "up to a global phase , the instantaneous ground state at @xmath112 follows from the bcs ground state with @xmath113 by an infinitely slow adiabatic @xmath69-sweep up to @xmath80 .",
    "therefore , it is sufficient to calculate the transition amplitude from @xmath114 with @xmath115 to some arbitrary low energy state at @xmath81 .    as @xmath116 , all low energy states turn into purely bosonic free molecules due to the high detuning of the fermions .",
    "this means a low energy state at @xmath81 can be evolved adiabatically by an infinitely slow adiabatic @xmath69-sweep into a state without fermions at @xmath117 . since the calculation of adiabatic time evolution is straightforward , we choose @xmath118 with @xmath119 for convenience , such that the low energy states are in fact bosonic .    note that the coherent states are an over - complete basis : the coherent states @xmath120 with _ fixed _ @xmath121 but arbitrary phase @xmath122 are sufficient to represent any number state @xmath123 by means of the identity @xmath124 it is therefore sufficient to choose an in principle arbitrary modulus @xmath125 for our final state .",
    "however , we make the choice @xmath126 since this is also the mean field value one would expect if all fermions have been converted into @xmath52 molecules",
    ". this choice will let the dominant transition amplitudes be given in a simple semiclassical approximation , rather than as high order corrections after many cancellations of detuned path integral paths .",
    "in summary we have @xmath127 and @xmath115 at @xmath114 as well as @xmath128 with @xmath126 and @xmath129 at @xmath118 .",
    "our strategy here is to solve the fermionic dynamics first , before we start to evaluate the bosonic path integral . to this end ,",
    "the atomic hamiltonians @xmath96 and @xmath98 deserve different treatments , as explained in the following paragraphs .      as mentioned",
    "before , the general time evolution of a balanced mixture of fermions evolving under @xmath130 factorizes into a commuting product of the evolution of two - level systems @xmath131 . if we had no terms involving @xmath99 molecules in the hamiltonian , we would have the same situation as described in @xcite apart from our current inclusion of background scattering .",
    "in this case the classical path for @xmath132 , @xmath133 and @xmath134 , @xmath135 shows a total conversion from the bcs state at @xmath114 , into molecules at @xmath136 as long as the sweep rate @xmath137 is small enough to avoid leaving fermionic excitations at @xmath136 .",
    "as we will see , this adiabaticity condition requires only that @xmath73 be small compared to the bcs gap ; it is the condition for adiabaticity of the two - body problem of resonant association into molecules .",
    "our focus in this paper , in contrast , is on non - adiabaticity of low - frequency collective excitations in the time - dependent many - body system .",
    "we will therefore assume that the two - body dynamics is indeed perfectly adiabatic , so that the final state contains no fermions .",
    "we denote the classical path of the scenario without @xmath99 molecular terms in the hamiltonian by @xmath138 , @xmath139 and @xmath140 , @xmath141 .",
    "since the @xmath97 molecular modes are the ones which will mainly be occupied even for the hamiltonian including the full @xmath99 molecular terms , we actually do not evaluate the path integral for them .",
    "instead we evaluate the integrand on @xmath138 , @xmath139 and @xmath140 , @xmath141 , as a kind of classical approximation .",
    "although @xmath138 , @xmath139 and @xmath140 , @xmath141 are not the exact saddlepoint paths of the full system ( including @xmath99 molecular terms ) , they are a good and self - consistent approximation to it , since the depletion into the other molecular modes turns out to be very small compared to this adiabatic classical background @xcite .",
    "note that , because of analytic continuation of the path integral variables , for the classical path the does not _ in general _ denote complex conjugation any more , but instead denotes independent functions ( see appendix [ classical ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , the classical paths we find in appendix [ classical ] for @xmath142 are indeed still complex conjugate pairs .",
    "this means , for the class of classical paths considered in this paper , we can still use the as complex conjugation .",
    "similar statements hold for all quantities which depend on the classical path .    hence , the time evolution of a general balanced fermionic state @xmath143 and of its dual @xmath144 under @xmath145 ( @xmath96 on the classical path ) are _ in general _ not the hermitian conjugate of each other any more  but they are for our class of classical paths . the general time - evolution along them can be written as @xmath146 where @xmath147 , @xmath148 and @xmath149 , @xmath150 are general solutions to the fermionic two - level problems @xmath151 ( @xmath102 on the classical path ) .",
    "the factors of the product in brackets are the @xmath152 ( @xmath131 on the classical path ) of the single two - level systems .",
    "the initial conditions at @xmath153 of the atomic two - level systems in our specific case follow immediately from the foregoing discussion in section [ boundary ] . in order to meet @xmath154 ,",
    "we need @xmath155 with the instantaneous eigenstate of the two - state system @xmath156 , @xmath157 and the phase @xmath158 of the molecular classical path .",
    "these quantities are defined in appendix [ classical ] .",
    "the fermionic ground state still holds for finite @xmath80 when imposing also the self - consistent molecular initial conditions @xmath159 with @xmath158 , @xmath160 and @xmath67 as defined in appendix [ classical ] and evaluated at @xmath80 .",
    "for @xmath161 the values @xmath162 and @xmath163 both tend to zero , while @xmath164 becomes proportional to the usual bcs order parameter as explained before .",
    "if one would turn off the interaction among the fermions , i.e.  @xmath165 , the state @xmath143 would asymptotically approach a non - interacting fermi gas .",
    "there is a non - arbitrary parameter @xmath158 appearing in the initial state @xmath143 , which is the initial phase of the specific classical path considered .",
    "this is due to the fact that in general , the number conserving ground state @xmath166 of the system would look like @xmath167 with @xmath158 , @xmath138 and @xmath140 as defined in appendix [ classical ] .",
    "thus , the phase of the fermionic state and the phase of the coherent state are necessarily related to insure number conservation .",
    "consequently , when the stationary phase approximation chooses the phase of the classical path giving the main contribution to the transition amplitude , it also chooses automatically the fermionic phases within the bcs state .    in appendix [ classical ]",
    "we compute the classical path for @xmath138 , @xmath139 and @xmath140 , @xmath141 as well as the adiabtic solution of the atomic two - level systems on the classical path . the reasoning why the general solutions @xmath147 , @xmath148 and @xmath149 , @xmath150 depend only on the modulus of @xmath168",
    "can also be found there .",
    "as explained before , we are interested here in the scenario that avoids fermionic excitations at @xmath136 .",
    "this means @xmath169 , because in the adiabatic solution under @xmath145 no fermions remain .",
    "to include the @xmath1 molecular modes , we have to include @xmath98 .",
    "however , it would be very hard to treat @xmath98 analytically exactly . to simplify our calculations",
    ", we will perform a dilute gas approximation ( dga ) .",
    "the idea behind the dga is the following : up to a prefactor ( irrelevant for the argumentation ) , the transition amplitude we calculate can be written as an exponential function .",
    "the function in the exponent is a power series in terms of molecular modes with @xmath1 .",
    "since the occupation of all @xmath1 molecular modes is expected to be small , we can stop this series at the leading order , which is the quadratic one in our case .",
    "it is thus the diluteness of the gas and the weak occupation of modes that makes the approximation good .",
    "after the approximation , the exponent is equivalent to the term one would obtain by a second order time - dependent perturbation theory .",
    "this is just because the powers of an expansion must naturally agree .",
    "however , the dilute gas approximation is by far better than the second order time - dependent perturbation theory , since there are no restrictions on the time interval in which it is valid .",
    "note that the dga is especially more than just putting the second order perturbation theory into the exponent : all the extra terms that the dga contains compared to the time - dependent perturbation theory are actually there  its just that some other terms have been neglected . in this sense",
    "the dga is the resummation of a perturbation series .",
    "one can also take another point of view in order to see why the dga works so well : at late times , the dyson series of the system s time evolution operator might actually involve large contributions from terms of high order in @xmath99 moleclular fields .",
    "but among these , by far the largest contributions are those in which many different modes are each occupied only slightly  because there are very many ways to distribute a few particles over many modes .",
    "including all of these large contributions , and neglecting all the ones that have the same order in occupation number , but are smaller by a factor of the order of the number of modes , we find we have written nothing but the exponential of the quadratic result . for the time evolution operator @xmath95 , the identity @xmath170}={\\left[}\\hat u_{tl , cl}^{\\dagger}\\ , \\hat h_{pt } \\,\\hat u_{tl , cl}^{\\phantom{-1}}{\\right]}{\\left[}\\hat u^{\\dagger}_{tl , cl } \\,\\hat u_{at}^{\\phantom{-1}}{\\right]}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] enables us to write a dyson series for @xmath171 .",

    "since equation is non - local in time , it needs to be simplified . the idea is to find a transition amplitude , calculated with a simple hamiltonian , but matching equation .",

    "the following section [ mapping ] is devoted to this subject : the form of influence functional in is in general equivalent to that induced by an array of harmonic oscillators , linearly coupled .",
    "we can therefore use this result to construct an effective _ bosonic _ _ quadratic _ hamiltonian , i.e.  a linear system that will reproduce the leading non - adiabatic effects of the slow feshbach sweep on the final molecular modes .",
    "in the previous section we have solved the fermionic subsystem : by perturbing around the non - trivially time - dependent mean field solution for @xmath2 , and applying the dilute gas approximation , we have obtained an effective action that describes the quantum dynamics of the molecular field under driving by the associating fermions .",

    "in general , we follow the same strategy as before : we consider the system to consist of two subsystems of which one is the molecular subsystem .    even though the strategy in this section is the same as in the previous one , the procedure is somewhat reversed : in continuation of equation we start out in section [ virbos ] within a path integral description for the molecular modes .",
    "we show that equation is the very same as calculating a transition amplitude for the virtual bosons under a certain hamiltonian .",
    "having represented our system with a tractable model of coupled oscillators , we will even abandon the path integral of the molecular subsystem in section [ leave ] .",

    "a new hamiltonian @xmath207 , creating the time evolution @xmath208 has been introduced here .",
    "its properties will be discussed in the following section .",
    "the new hamiltonian @xmath207 appearing in @xmath208 of when leaving the path integral for the @xmath99 molecular modes is defined as @xmath209 the hamiltonian for the full system reads now @xmath210    the hamiltonian @xmath211 simply restores to @xmath212 from , the self - energy terms of our two molecular modes : it includes the kinetic energy term of the @xmath183-modes ( the actual molecules forming the final condensate ) and the total detuning of the @xmath184-modes ( the ` dummy ' molecules that mediate the interactions among the fermions ) .",
    "previously these were absorbed in the path integral s @xmath93 , but with our return to the canonical operator formalism , they must be made explicit .",

    "in contrast , within the path integral ( see ) , the smallest system factorizing the dynamics was @xmath185 .",
    "the physical meaning of @xmath207 is that it describes the complete dynamics of a pair of molecular modes with momenta @xmath215 , in terms of _ time - dependent _ , linear couplings among _ three _ different types of bosonic fields .",
    "the fact that only opposite momentum molecular modes with @xmath215 need to be coupled in @xmath207 is due to our assumption that , to leading non - adiabatic order , only the @xmath97 molecular mode will be macroscopically populated in the bcs - bec crossover .",
    "this preserves translational symmetry for the post - adiabatic excitations .",
    "note that the symmetry offered by @xmath216 implies also the symmetry @xmath217 . due to these symmetries , a double counting in the product over @xmath38 in equation",
    "is avoided by restricting the third component of @xmath38 , @xmath218 to @xmath205 , assuming that the volume @xmath39 tends to infinity . a double counting in the sum over @xmath38 in equation",
    "is avoided in the same way .",
    "the post - adiabatic analysis of the effective hamiltonian @xmath211 in section [ post ] will be the main contribution of this paper . before proceeding with it ,",
    "however , we pause here to note that the mapping from the physical fermionic subsystem to the effective subsystem of virtual bosons is not only a mapping between formal hamiltonians .",
    "it also includes the mapping between initial and final quantum states of the physical and effective systems .",
    "this has been done in for the states at infinitely early and late times : the bcs state at @xmath106 and the fermion vacuum at @xmath219 are both mapped onto the vacuum of virtual bosons .",
    "beyond computing the final results of slow but non - adiabatic evolution over infinite times , however , we would like to be able to use our effective model to describe low - frequency excitations at arbitrary intermediate times as well .",
    "and indeed we can do this , but the sense in which we can do it is a bit subtle .",
    "the necessary technical steps have in principle already been laid out in section [ boundary ] and in the mapping of initial and final states .",
    "our construction of the virtual boson model , as reproducing the effective action from fermions in the molecule path integral , showed that the virtual boson model correctly yields all effects on the molecules , as long as all dynamics is slow compared to the bcs gap .",
    "the fact that we succeed in computing the molecular excitations at late times shows that we must be accurately computing the intermediate dynamics that yields them , and this is the full low frequency dynamics of the entire system .",
    "what we are really describing , therefore , are the low frequency collective modes of the entire system . since both the actual fermionic excitations and the effective excitations of our virtual bosons are separated from the low frequency collective modes by the bcs gap , in both cases the high frequency modes adiabatically dress the low frequency excitations .",
    "it is thus in principle a straightforward exercise in adiabatic theory , to explicitly determine exactly what virtual fermionic excitations are really dressing the slow molecular excitations at intermediate times , in terms of the virtual boson excitations that dress them in our effective model .",
    "we will not pursue that adiabatic exercise in this paper , but instead focus on the post - adiabatic collective excitations that arise when the bcs - bec crossover is effected at any finite speed .",
    "we will express the slow but possibly non - adiabatic evolution of the full system in the time - dependent basis of its instantaneous normal modes .",
    "and we will represent these instantaneous energy eigenstates within the effective model in which our virtual bosons have replaced the physical fermions .",
    "for many practical purposes , the expression in terms of instantaneous normal modes is sufficient in itself .",
    "spectroscopic measurements , for example , measure normal modes directly . in any case",
    ", it will only be adiabatic mappings that we leave implicit ; our theory will provide the leading post - adiabatic effects explicitly .",
    "as explained earlier , the path integral of the @xmath97 modes had been approximated by evaluating it along its classical path .",
    "there is still a further step necessary in order to obtain a mean field theory in the common sense which does not depend on specific molecular boundary conditions , i.e.  specific phases .",
    "looking at the transition amplitude , there appears the phase of the classical molecular background @xmath158 in @xmath220 as well as in @xmath208 ( through terms in @xmath207 , i.e.  @xmath185 which create and destroy molecular excitations ) .",
    "this is nothing but the particle number conservation : if we changed from coherent states to number states , the @xmath158 integration would define the allowed particle numbers .",
    "the approach we take here is to redefine the phases of the fermionic creation and annihilation operators such that they just cancel the phase terms within the hamiltonian @xmath211 .",
    "the latter depends now only on the mean field values @xmath160 and @xmath67 as defined in appendix [ classical ] .",
    "this finally makes @xmath211 a hamiltonian for perturbations around a classical mean field background .",
    "the hamiltonians @xmath207 defined in the previous section let the dynamics factorize .",
    "moreover , they are simply quadratic .",
    "as is well known , any quadratic hamiltonian can be diagonalized ( i.e.  , reduced to the standard @xmath221 form for some set of canonical quasiparticle destruction operators @xmath222 ) by means of a bogoliubov transformation . unfortunately , the diagonalization of the hamilton does not in general imply the diagonalization of the time evolution operator .",
    "the latter is only true for time - independent hamiltonians , for which the bogoliubov transformation identifies the fundamental excitations , which are constant for all times . in the time - dependent case",
    "we can still get the fundamental excitations of the system at any instant in time by diagonalizing the hamiltonian instantaneously .",
    "this will however make the diagonalizing bogoliubov transformation _ time - dependent_. this implies a _ post - adiabatic _ coupling between the instantaneous fundamental excitations in the system s dynamics .",
    "we will come back to this issue in section [ post ] .",
    "instantaneously diagonalizing @xmath211 is still the first step towards our goal of describing these post - adiabatic excitations . to zeroth post - adiabatic order",
    ", the system will simply remain in an instantaneous quasiparticle number eigenstate at all times . in this section",
    "we will therefore perform the instantaneous diagonalization of the hamiltonian @xmath207 in order to get the instantaneous fundamental excitations .",
    "the latter excitations are usually called bogoliubov excitations on the bec side and anderson - bogoliubov excitations on the bcs side . on the bcs side of the problem ,",
    "the lowest energy eigenmodes of the fundamental excitations are also called sound modes due to the nature of their dispersion relation .    along with the eigenmodes",
    ", we derive the equations for the eigenfrequencies of the fundamental excitations .",
    "it will turn out that the lowest energy eigenmodes of @xmath207 have eigenfrequencies within the gap of fermionic excitations .",
    "we focus especially on the low energy excitations in this section .",
    "since various sums are involved in the course of a bogoliubov transformation , it is notationally inefficient for this purpose to denote modes by using different characters .",
    "instead , we switch to the following notation involving just one basic character for all modes : @xmath223 the original modes are distinguished now by different subindices . consequently , the subindex can be either a vector , denoting the old @xmath178 , or a character , denoting the old @xmath183 and @xmath184 . as a joint notation which does not specify either of both possibilities",
    ", we will dedicate greek subindices like @xmath224 or @xmath225 .",
    "thus , an unspecified operator is given for example by @xmath226 .",
    "consequently , sums over greek indices are taken over all momenta as well as over @xmath227 and @xmath228 .      as mentioned before it is well known that a quadratic hamiltonian can be diagonalized by means of a bogoliubov transformation .",
    "we can thus assume that our hamiltonian @xmath207 can be rewritten as @xmath229 where the transformed operators are defined as @xmath230 and fulfill the canonical commutation relations . for small @xmath231 , we will numerically find real , positive low - frequency solutions for @xmath232 .",
    "we assume that no further , negative or even complex @xmath232 exist in the low - frequency regime .",
    "it is easily seen that the c - number term in the hamiltonian is necessary to compensate for an operator reordering : if we insert equations and into the hamiltonian and reorder the operators as in , we get extra terms due to the canonical commutation relations .",
    "no c - number additions to the hamiltonian will affect the probabilities , however , and so all of those may simply be ignored .",
    "the above definitions of the bogoliubov transformation need to imply compliance with the canonical commutation relations . as a consequence of this constraint ,",
    "the following conditions become part of the definition : @xmath233 is necessary in order to satisfy the commutation relation @xmath234=\\delta_{{{\\bf{k}}},{{\\bf{k'}}}}\\,\\delta_{\\xi , \\xi'}$ ] , whereas the commutation relation @xmath235=0 $ ] requires @xmath236 to hold .",
    "the commutation relation among the creation operators adds a further condition , which is the barred version of , written here for @xmath237 instead of @xmath38 : @xmath238      in view of a later requirement in section [ post ] , we introduce here also the inverse bogoliubov transformation defined by @xmath239 the validity of and is easily checked by inserting it into the definitions and and applying the identities , and .    in order for the @xmath226 to obey canonical commutation relations ,",
    "the necessary and sufficient conditions are a set of orthonormality relations among the @xmath240 , @xmath241 , similar to those obtained for the original transformation , , .",
    "it can be shown , however , that the conditions for the original and the inverse transformation imply each other @xcite , and so the normalization problem for the @xmath240 , @xmath241 is not overconstrained .",
    "we want the bogoliubov transformation , to instantaneously diagonalize the hamiltonian @xmath207 as . to this end",
    "we need the appropriate mode functions @xmath240 , @xmath241 of the eigenmodes and their eigenfrequencies @xmath232 , respectively .",

    "together with the completeness relation , this defines the mode functions .",
    "remember that the mode functions as well as the frequencies defined here are time - dependent via the time dependence of the classical background @xmath138 , @xmath139 and @xmath140 , @xmath141 which appears in @xmath156 , @xmath190 and @xmath157 , @xmath191 .",

    "for the following reasoning it is important that we always think of the system s volume as going to infinity .",

    "in this section we will derive the central result of this paper , namely a post - adiabatic hamiltonian @xmath334 for which the subscript indicates that it is expressed in terms of the instantaneous normal modes .",

    "our procedure was exactly the same as the familiar bogoliubov diagonalization of a quadratic hamiltonian , but since the hamiltonian in question was time - dependent , the resulting quasiparticle operators were also time - dependent , and not only in the trivial sense of having time - dependent phase pre - factors .",
    "our bogoliubov transformation was itself non - trivially time - dependent , with each of the instantaneously diagonalizing operators being _ time - dependent _ combination of _ time-**in**dependent _ creation and destruction operators .",
    "in this sense our time - dependent bogliubov transformation simply has not yet gone quite far enough . for _",
    "any given time _",
    "@xmath65 , we have a convenient set of instantaneously diagonalizing operators ; but this is still a _ different _ set of operators for every @xmath65 .",
    "we do not yet have a _ single _ set of operators that provides a simple description of excitations _ at all times_.    the easiest way to explain exactly what we still need to do is probably just to do it .",
    "we introduce a time - dependent change of basis in the many - body hilbert subspace of modes with fixed @xmath38 , such that for all states @xmath337 , the new - basis representation @xmath338 is given by @xmath339 where @xmath340 is the unitary operator that effects the time - dependent bogoliubov transformation which instantaneously diagonalizes @xmath207 : @xmath341 we usually omit the argument of @xmath340 whenever it is @xmath65 .",
    "in general @xmath336 is the exponential of a bilinear mapping in terms of the old creation and annihilation operators appearing in @xmath207 .",
    "the effect of this change of basis is simple , and very convenient : it re - labels states so that they count as the same , at different times , if they are the same modulo adiabatic time evolution .",
    "so , for example , the instantaneous ground state of the @xmath38-subspace at any time @xmath65 was defined in our original basis by @xmath342 this implies that , in the new basis , the ground state is determined by @xmath343 since all the operators @xmath244 are _ time - independent _ , the ground state @xmath344 is now also time - independent .",
    "a similar property holds for all instantaneous eigenstates of @xmath207 : their eigenvalues are time - dependent , but the states themselves are now time - independent , in this new time - dependent basis , because the adiabatic time evolution ( up to phases ) has been built into the basis itself",
    ".    exactly this change of many - body hilbert space basis is normally made implicitly at the same time as one diagonalizes a quadratic hamiltonian with a bogoliubov transformation . in the case of a time - independent bogoliubov transformation , diagonalizing a time - independent hamiltonian , the basis transformation is trivial enough that it needs no explicit attention . in the general case of a time - dependent transformation , however ,",
    "the basis change is time - dependent , and some non - trivial effects are involved . for where the time evolution in the original basis was given by @xmath345 now in the new basis the time evolution is @xmath346 with @xmath347 where we have also used the identity @xmath348 .",
    "the first term in @xmath349 represents strictly adiabatic evolution .",

    "it can be considered a second - quantized analog to first post - adiabatic correction terms in single - particle quantum mechanics , such as so - called geometric magnetism and other artificial gauge fields .",
    "we would also like this second term to be expressed in terms of the _ time - independent _ operators @xmath244 .",
    "as we will see , this term couples different eigenmodes of the instantaneous hamiltonian .",

    "would thus require an explicit representation of @xmath336 .",
    "we will take a simpler approach in the following section .",

    "figure [ d4 ] also shows the @xmath38-dependence of the matrix element @xmath383 for small @xmath231 .",
    "it is important to notice that the matrix element considered is bounded even in the limit @xmath384 .",

    "consequently , the latter peak becomes sharper with increasing @xmath231 .",

    "in this paper , we have addressed the post - adiabatic dynamics of a two - channel model , describing the transition from a bcs ground state of fermionic atoms through a feshbach resonance into a possibly excited state of bosonic molecules .      throughout this paper , we have mimicked the effect of background scattering by the adiabatic elimination of off - resonant bound states . in comparison with the standard hubbard ",
    "stratonovich approach , this offers an especially physical interpretation of the mathematical simplifications .",
    "the basic intermediate result continuously used in the calculations is the classical path for @xmath2 molecular modes as derived in appendix [ classical ] and shown in figure [ classicplot ] .",
    "it serves as a background field within all our calculations .",
    "in the course of this paper we have introduced virtual bosonic modes in order to mimic the effects derived before by a dilute gas approximation .",
    "the common idea of both descriptions is that the system can be interpreted as consisting of two subsystems .",
    "the order of solving them , one after another , or both at once , is the key step in simplifying the systems description .",
    "we have finally mimicked the leading effects of the subsystem of fermionic atoms by means of a subsystem of virtual bosons , while the subsystem of molecular bosons is treated in terms of a coherent state path integral . instead of solving the dynamics of one subsystem within the path integral , we left the path integral in order to solve the dynamics of both subsystems simultaneously .",
    "this led us to a purely bosonic , quadratic hamiltonian , which should be an excellent approximation to the original problem in the parameter range we are looking at .",
    "the latter hamiltonian @xmath207 is an important intermediate result of this paper since all our following main results are based on it .      as a main result",
    ", we have diagonalized the quadratic hamiltonian @xmath207 instantaneously and thus obtained equations for the spectrum of instantaneous eigenfrequencies @xmath397 as well as for the instantaneous mode functions @xmath240 and @xmath241 .",
    "the equations obtained can be used for a numerical analysis as shown in the figures [ d1 ] , [ d2 ] and [ d3 ] .",
    "thus , we have described the instantaneous ( andergoliubov excitations completely .",
    "the most important result of this paper is the post - adiabatic hamiltonian @xmath349 .",
    "it describes the hamiltonian @xmath207 in terms of its instantaneous , time - dependent normal modes . as an effect of the time dependence , there appear various coupling terms , quadratic in the normal mode s creation and annihilation operators with prefactors @xmath379 , @xmath380 and @xmath382 .",
    "these prefactors which introduce new couplings among the modes are the main post - adiabatic effect .",
    "the different prefactors can be obtained numerically as the examples in figures [ d4 ] , [ d5 ] and [ d6 ] show for various , significant cases .",
    "the main restriction on the validity of our result is the constraint on @xmath73 .",
    "the validity of almost all other assumptions are immediate self - consistent consequences of the latter one : the smaller @xmath73 is , the fewer modes are expected to become excited .",
    "thus , the total depletion out of the system s adiabatic ground state is expected to decrease . as the total depletion decreases ,",
    "the quality of the dilute gas approximation ( dga ) is expected to increase .",
    "furthermore , a small depletion justifies also the neglect of back - reaction on the classical background .",
    "there is another restriction on @xmath7 , originating from the derivation of the underlying classical background : the adiabaticity condition for the atomic two - level systems @xmath7 as well as the slow time - dependence of the molecular classical path are both self - consistent .",
    "both hold as long as @xmath7 is small compared to the energy gaps of all atomic two - level systems ( i.e.  the bcs gap on the bcs side ) .",
    "this condition ensures that we end up in a state without remaining fermionic excitations .",
    "small sweep rates @xmath137 also suggest low energy modes to be involved .",
    "focussing on the dynamics of low energy normal modes located at the lower end within the fermionic gap , we can neglect higher order adiabatic corrections to the time evolution of the fermions in the molecular background .",
    "apart from the restrictions on @xmath73 , the classical approximation for the @xmath2 molecular modes has to hold .",
    "this is ensured by the choice of a small @xmath71 ( see @xcite ) : as @xmath71 decreases , the coupling between the fermionic and the bosonic subsystem decreases and the eigenstates of the whole system approach product states out of either hilbert space more closely . since the classical approximation approximates the system s ground state by a product of an ( unnormalized ) coherent state and a fermionic squeezed state it improves as @xmath71 decreases .",
    "note that according to its definition , @xmath71 decreases with increasing @xmath52 .",
    "several assumptions have been made in the derivation of the classical path which turn out to be fulfilled self - consistently . despite this , these assumptions might in principle have ruled out some possible further classical paths .",
    "however , we consider this extremely unlikely , since the obtained classical path shows the expected bahaviour .      in comparison with real experiments ,",
    "our results have surely to be adapted in so far as all experiments are conducted in traps , whereas we deal with a potential - free hamiltonian .",
    "however , potentials with nice momentum space representations might be tractable within our calculations as well .",
    "numerical results which can be compared with experimental results at least qualitatively will be presented in a future publication @xcite .",
    "the basic implication of our analysis is that the leading post - adiabatic effect of a finitely slow bcs - bec crossover , through a narrow feshbach resonance , is the excitation of opposite - momenta squeezed states of the low - frequency collective modes of the molecular quantum gas .",
    "this is a typical form of non - adiabatic excitation in systems described by quantum fields in time - dependent backgrounds .",
    "it occurs , for example , in cosmology , where excitations of long - wavelength modes in cosmic fields during expansion of the universe have been considered as sources of non - uniformity in the spatial distribution of energy and matter .    as in cosmology",
    ", one may expect that subsequent nonlinear interactions will drive the non - adiabatically excited squeezed state into a more typical thermal distribution . in this sense",
    "the coherent non - adiabatic excitations are a source of thermal fluctuations , and represent an essential initial stage of entropy production . our results in this paper",
    "can thus be considered as an analysis of the first roots of entropy in chemical reactions , as they appear in molecule production under the most tightly controlled conditions of full quantum coherence .",
