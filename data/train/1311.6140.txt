    "ultra - high energy ( uhe ) photons are expected to be produced in the interactions of uhe cosmic rays with matter , e.g. with gas around a source , or with the extragalactic background radiation ( ebr ) . in particular ,",
    "photons can be created from the decay of neutral pions produced in the interaction of uhe nuclei with the ebr photons , for instance , because of the greisen - zatsepin - kuzmin ( gzk ) effect  @xcite .",
    "recent measurements of the uhecr energy spectrum  @xcite have confirmed a flux suppression above 50 eev ( 1eev=@xmath5  ev ) compatible with the expectation from gzk effect , although other alternatives ( e.g. , a physical limit to the maximum acceleration at the source ) can not be ruled out .",
    "hence , the observation of uhe photons would be an independent evidence for the existence of the gzk effect , providing hints on the nature of uhecrs , on astrophysical sources and on environmental conditions .",
    "a large fraction of uhe photons are also expected , from the decay or the annihilation of supermassive particles  @xcite , in some exotic ( top - down ) models for uhecr acceleration .",
    "no uhe photons have been observed so far and upper limits have been placed on their flux  @xcite , partly disfavoring exotic models .",
    "current experimental results on the chemical composition of uhe cosmic rays  @xcite suggest a mixed composition from light to heavier nuclei at the highest energies . as will be discussed in the next sections ,",
    "the expected flux of photons depends , among other parameters , on the chemical composition of crs at their crs sources .",
    "the observation , or non - observation , of photons would thus help to clarify the nature of the flux suppression observed at the highest energies and eventually provide additional hints to the understanding of the chemical composition of uhecrs .",
    "the estimate of the expected fluxes of photons is thus an important aspect to improve .",
    "this is particularly true if one takes into account the large variation of photon fluxes predicted at earth by different simulators .",
    "several predictions of photon fractions have been made in the past ( see for example  @xcite ) .",
    "most of the adopted simulators are based on the solution of transport equations , or on semi - analytical approaches , and only a few of them are publicly available .",
    "for instance , among the publicly available codes , the monte carlo approach is adopted in  @xcite where , however , double and triple pair productions are not included .",
    "we will show in the next section that the latter is dominant in the energy region above 10@xmath6  ev . on the other hand ,",
    "the solution of transport equations is the fundamental ingredient of the crpropa code  @xcite , allowing one to follow the propagation of photons at higher energies .    for these reasons",
    ", we present here a novel monte carlo simulation code to reproduce more realistically the propagation of extragalactic photons and their cascade development .",
    "this _ stand - alone _ code , named ` eleca`@xmath7(__el__ectromagnetic _ _ ca__scading ) , is based on a pure monte carlo approach and has been designed to propagate primary photons produced either by candidate sources or produced as secondary particles during the propagation of uhe nuclei and their interactions with relic photons of extragalactic background radiation .",
    "our code is written in c++ with a highly modular structure which simplifies the interface with existing codes developed to simulate the propagation of uhecrs .    in this paper",
    ", we describe the structure of ` eleca ` , showing its basic features and some applications relevant to the understanding of the propagation of photons and nuclei .",
    "we also estimate the source distances within which we expect to observe uhe photons with energy between @xmath1 and @xmath2  ev and we show some applications of astrophysical interest .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the details of the interaction processes and their implementation in ` eleca`@xmath7 are given in section  [ sect : physics ] .",
    "in the next section we discuss some physical results and applications , including ( i ) an estimate of the survival probability for photons inducing electromagnetic cascades as a function of their distance from the observer ( section  [ sect : maxdist ] ) , ( ii ) the prediction of the fluxes at earth for gzk photons ( section  [ sect : fluxes ] ) and ( iii ) the calculation of the corresponding horizons ( section  [ sect : horizons ] ) in some representative astrophysical scenarios using the most recent energy spectrum measurement  @xcite for normalization .",
    "ultra - high energy photons , with energy ranging from @xmath1  ev to @xmath5  ev , undergo interactions with the diffuse background radiation while travelling from their sources to the earth . in the energy range of interest in this work , the dominant energy - loss processes for uhe photons are pair production ( pp ) and double pair production ( dpp ) , responsible for the production of secondary electrons and positrons ( hereafter generally referred as electrons ) .",
    "electrons are cooled via inverse compton scattering ( ics ) , @xmath8 , or through triplet pair production ( tpp ) , @xmath9 . moreover",
    ", the development of electromagnetic cascades depends on the strength of the intervening extragalactic magnetic fields ( egmfs ) . for sufficiently intense egmfs",
    ", electrons in the cascade will lose most of their energy by synchrotron radiation and the cascade development will stop when the synchrotron cooling time scale becomes smaller than the ics interaction mean free path . here , it is worth noting that the influence of magnetic fields with strength of the order of @xmath10 g , occurring around the cosmic large - scale structure , is not accounted for because the production of secondary @xmath11 is supposed to occur far from sources .",
    "some models of ebr are shown in the top panel of fig.[fig : ebr ] , as a function of the relic photon energy @xmath12 in the laboratory frame .",
    "the red solid line indicates the ebr spectrum adopted in this work .",
    "in particular , the black - body model with temperature @xmath13  k is adopted for the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) while the semi - analytical `` model d '' in  @xcite is adopted for the infrared / optical background ( ciob ) . the model proposed in  @xcite",
    "is adopted for the universal radio background ( urb ) .",

    "the contribution of the whole ebr ( solid line ) , and of each ebr component separately ( dashed ) , are shown to emphasize the influence of each background radiation on the mean free path .",
    "as evident from the figure , photons with energy below tens of tev , can propagate without interacting for distances of hundreds of mpc , cooling down just because of adiabatic energy losses .",
    "on the other hand , the universe becomes opaque to photons with energy of a few hundreds or thousands of tev , getting more transparent at energies in the eev range , where the radio background is the main responsible for energy - loss processes .",
    "results assuming different ebl models , as in  @xcite , are also shown for comparison : the different models assumed for the irb and urb , are responsible for the observed differences at very low and high energies , respectively .",
    "in constrast to other types of interactions , the inverse compton scattering ( ics ) is a well known process occurring without threshold .",
    "it is worth noting that at low energy ( namely below @xmath271  tev ) @xmath28 is constant because , for @xmath29 , the cross section @xmath30 . above a few @xmath1  ev , the dominant process  @xcite is the tpp . given the production of 3 electrons , even in the lower energy region , the contribution of tpp may be especially important in the presence of strong magnetic fields , because of the synchrotron energy loss affecting charged particles .",

    "the energy of the secondary particles is derived according to the differential cross section  @xcite . for the tpp we used the approximation given in  @xcite for the leading electron , while the leftover energy is equally shared between the remaining pair .",
    "other sub - dominant processes ( e.g. muon pair production on background photons , pair production in magnetic fields or on atoms , ions and free electrons ) are thus neglected in this work .    finally , electron and",
    "photons adiabatically lose their energy because of the expansion of the universe , while electrons might additionally lose energy because of the emission of synchrotron radiation while traversing egmfs .",

    "we checked that the effect of applying such a maximum distance cut is negligible on the flux of secondary particles at earth .",
    "as expected , we found that the observed spectrum is affected by less than 1% , independently of the energy of particles at the observer .",
    "in this section we focus on one relevant mechanism responsible for the production of uhe photons , i.e. , the gzk effect .",
    "in fact , protons with energy above @xmath52  eev and heavier nuclei with lorentz factor larger than @xmath53 @xcite , while interacting with relic photons mainly experience baryonic resonances which produce neutral mesons , mainly pions , that in turn quickly decay to two @xmath37s .",
    "it is worth remarking that the number of uhe photons produced during nuclei propagation , as well as their production sites and their expected energy spectrum at earth , depends on the assumptions about the sources .",

    "this result shows that the observation of sources of uhe nuclei , by means of uhe photons , is limited to the nearby universe .",
    "it is worth mentioning that , the possibility of doing astronomy with uhe photons , in the case of future observations , is limited by factors altering the arrival directions of such photons , in particular by the intervening magnetic fields on the charged component of the electromagnetic cascade .",
