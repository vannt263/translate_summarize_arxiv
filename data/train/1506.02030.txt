    "* ) , which has the luminosity @xmath7 erg s@xmath3 and duration @xmath8 s. these components show a sharp drop in the light curve , which can not be produced by the afterglow and hence requires the activities of the central engine @xcite .",
    "the origin of the emissions is most likely a collimated relativistic jet .",
    "some short grbs show a long - lasting plateau component with the luminosity @xmath9 erg s@xmath3 and duration @xmath10 s in their light curves @xcite .",
    "thus the fluence of each of three components is of roughly the same order of magnitude @xcite .",
    "the plateau emission is considered to be produced by an activity of the central engine such as a relativistic jet from a bh with a typical ns magnetic field @xmath11 g @xcite or a pulsar wind from a highly magnetized ( @xmath12 g ) and rapidly rotating ( @xmath13 ms ) ns @xcite .",
    "nearly isotropic emissions from a merger event have been anticipated ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , hereafter kit15 ) because of the high probability of the simultaneous detection with gws .",
    "recently , numerical simulations suggest that significant mass is isotropically ejected by a ns binary merger ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the collimated outflow from the central engine due to the blandford - znajek process @xcite or the pulsar wind interacts with the isotropic ejecta and emits the isotropic radiation .    in this letter",
    ", we consider nearly isotropic emissions caused by the long - lasting activity , which produces a plateau emission , as electromagnetic counterparts of the ns binary merger .",
    "in particular , we focus on a scattering of plateau x - ray photons ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we also consider a macronova ( or kilonova ) powered by the plateau activity ( kit15 ) , without resort to the @xmath4-process radioactivity @xcite .",
    "these detections would significantly reduce the localization error of gw detectors ( @xmath14 deg@xmath15 ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the letter is organized as follows : in section 2 we estimate the luminosity of the scattered plateau emission , and compare it with the sensitivity of x - ray observations . in section 3 , we present the model of a macronova powered by the plateau activity , which explains the observations of grb 130603b . finally , we present discussions in section 4 .",

    "a significant fraction of photons which are emitted with angle @xmath17 relative to the jet axis could be scattered at a large angle by the surrounding ejecta if the optical depth for the thomson scattering is larger than unity , @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the electron number density , and @xmath20 is the thomson cross section . using the assumption of homologous expansion for the ejecta @xcite , the radius of the ejecta @xmath4 is described by the velocity @xmath21 and time since the merger @xmath22 as @xmath23 .",
    "the number density is described by @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the average mass number of the nuclei in the ejecta and @xmath26 is the proton mass .",
    "if the ejecta mainly consist of the @xmath4-process elements , we have @xmath27 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ". then a typical value of the optical depth is @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the speed of the light .",
    "therefore , the surrounding ejecta are optically thick to the thomson scattering during the plateau activity timescale ( @xmath30 s ) .",
    "another condition to scatter a significant fraction of the plateau emission is that the radius of the plateau emission region is smaller than that of the expanding ejecta ( figure [ figure : mn ] ) .",
    "since the typical velocity of the ejecta is @xmath31 , the radius of the ejecta is described by @xmath32 on the other hand , the radius of the plateau emission region is estimated as @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the bulk lorentz factor of the emitter and @xmath35 is the flux variability timescale .",
    "both @xmath34 and @xmath35 have some range for each event , so that the emission continues over @xmath36 cm in an approximately logarithmic way .",
    "since the lorentz factor is low @xmath37 inside the jet due to the cocoon confinement @xcite and thus the relativistic beaming angle is larger than the jet opening angle @xmath38 , most emission from the jet can reach the boundary between the jet and the ejecta as shown in figure [ figure : mn ] .",
    "in addition , the range of @xmath39 covers the sweet spot for the scattering , @xmath40 .",
    "therefore , the observers with large viewing angle ( @xmath17 ) with respect to the jet axis would detect the scattered x - ray photons of the plateau emission .",
    "we parameterize the scattered luminosity of the plateau emission @xmath41 using a parameter @xmath42 as @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the observed isotropic luminosity of the plateau emission .",

    "moreover , if the ejecta have a large velocity ( @xmath120 ) by such as the central engine activity , the scattered photons become more anisotropic .",
    "the anisotropy affects the event rate of the simultaneous detections of the gw and x - ray emission from ns binary mergers .",
    "the large velocity of the ejecta produces a macronova with short duration ( kit15 ) and the bright radio flare at late time ( @xmath121 yr ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "therefore , the simultaneous observations in gw , x - ray , optical / infrared and radio bands give the detail information about the structure of the ejecta and the activity of the central engine .",
    "the scattered x - ray is linearly polarized , so that it brings new information .",
    "first the polarization degree @xmath122 gives the scattering angle @xmath123 , which is approximately equal to the inclination angle of the binary @xmath124 as the jet is aligned with the rotational axis of the binary ( figure [ figure : x ] ) .",
    "since the intensity also depends on the angle , we expect an anticorrelation between the x - ray intensity and polarization degree .",
    "the estimate of inclination angle from polarization degree gives us a test of our model since it is also measurable from the ratio of gw polarizations @xmath125 with an accuracy of @xmath126 degrees for a ns - ns ( bh - ns ) system @xcite .",
    "second the x - ray polarization angle on the sky determines another jet direction besides @xmath123 .",
    "this angle is degenerate with binary orbital phase in the gravitational wave signal without higher harmonics @xcite .",
    "thus the x - ray polarization can improve the measurement of parameters .",
    "recently , @xcite reported the discovery of near - infrared bump with luminosity @xmath127 erg s@xmath3 that is significantly above the regular decaying afterglow in grb 060614 .",
    "the plateau emission with @xmath128 and @xmath129 s was detected in this event @xcite .",
