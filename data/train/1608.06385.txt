    "high - altitude balloon experiments operating in stratosphere provide us with a unique opportunity to observe the sky in mostly any wavelength band with low airmass .",
    "as we are operating above 99% of the atmosphere , these experiments allow diffraction - limited operations without the use of adaptive optics .",
    "balloon payloads also experience lower downwelling radiation by a factor of more than ten as compared to the ground@xcite .",
    "floating zero - pressure balloons provide continuous observations varying from a few hours to days , depending on the launch site .",
    "the lower cost and the flexibility in launch timings and flight duration make high - altitude balloon experiments a wonderful test bed for space technologies@xcite .",
    "telescopic platforms at high altitudes have significant advantages over operations from the ground enabling observations at wider wavelength range .",
    "the weather conditions at these altitudes are also ideal , where the absence of clouds , water vapour and dust provide virtually ideal atmospheric transmission .",
    "the wavefront distortion at heights above 36 km is also very small .",
    "wavelengths below 400 nm are difficult to observe from ground - based observatories , but at balloon floating altitudes observations above 280 nm , as well as between 200 and 220 nm , become possible , the latter due the narrowing of o@xmath1 and o@xmath0 absorption bands@xcite .",
    "thus , a uv telescope ( 200400 nm ) located at these altitudes with aperture of just 6-inch in diameter , with sufficient pointing stability / accuracy and a 1k@xmath2k ccd array , could provide wide - field images with fwhm better than @xmath3 , approaching the diffraction limit@xcite ; similar to that of space observatories but at a much lower cost . additionally , space - based observatories have strict constrains because of detector safety reasons .",
    "these constrains on sun / moon angles limit observations of solar system objects .",
    "a stratospheric balloon payload typically has three following main components : a zero - pressure hydrogen / helium balloon of the required volume , a long flight train containing the recovery parachute and flight termination systems , and the gondola consisting of scientific equipment with communication and associated electronics@xcite .",
    "one of our major goals is to observe astronomical targets of opportunity from balloons .",
    "these objects appear with little warning and , as a result , are often only observed in the visible from ground - based observatories . with our quick response time",
    "we can have a balloon launch within two weeks , being well placed to obtain uv observations of these transients . a prime candidate for such observations",
    "would be comets which suddenly appear , as did comet ison ( c/2012 s1 ) or siding spring ( c/2013 a1 ) .",
    "these were pristine comets whose evolution as traced by the emission in the molecular bands of different ices should have revealed much about their composition .",
    "we have developed pointing / stabilization systems suitable for balloon flights which will allow us to observe comets and other transients ( e.g. supernovae ) in bands not observable by any other ground - based system .",
    "other high risk targets could be mercury / venus , whose observations are difficult because of the proximity to the sun",
    ".    there are only a handful of uv observations of the moon ( surprisingly for such a prominent object in the sky ) , primarily because the moon is so bright that most spacecrafts have an avoidance zone around it .",
    "we propose to observe the moon both spectroscopically and with an imager to track changes in the albedo at different phases , where the phase angle of the solar illumination changes .",
    "there is an increased interest of the moon and it is important to understand the nature of the lunar surface@xcite .    the complete payload . ]      balloons can provide remote sensing and in - situ measurements of trace gases in upper troposphere and stratosphere@xcite .",
    "the uv window of 200400 nm includes the lines from several important species in atmospheric chemistry , such as s0@xmath0 , o@xmath1 , bro , hcho .",
    "spectroscopic observations at these wavelengths allow simultaneous measurement of multiple gas species , and thus avoid the need for separate electrochemical systems for each gas .",
    "balloon experiments are complementary to space - based instruments in that they are able to measure gas profiles with different observational geometries , while space - based instruments continuously monitor changes in the atmosphere over long periods of time .",
    "the widely accepted doas technique can be easily applied to spectroscopic observations of light in the atmosphere ( scattered or directly from the source ) in uv and visible wavelength regions to obtain the trace gas strengths@xcite .",
    "the overall structural payload design is shown in fig  [ fig : payload ]",
    ". the payload will include several scientific instruments for simultaneous observations in both daytime and nighttime .",
    "the major instrument for the payload is a spherical catadioptric telescope of 80 mm aperture together with the uv spectrograph .",
    "the control of the pointing of the system is achieved through inertial measurement sensors ( coarse pointing ) and star sensor ( fine pointing ) .",
    "we will be operating this payload in two different modes . for bright sources ,",
    "the telescope with a uv - sensitive ccd at the secondary focus will carry out imaging , while the spectrograph , with optical fiber connected to the light - collecting lens ( 20 mm aperture ) aligned with the telescope aperture , will conduct parallel spectroscopic observations of the same bright source .",
    "for faint sources observations , the optical fiber from the spectrograph will be placed at the secondary focus of the telescope enabling the spectroscopic observations .",
    "both modes can also be used for atmospheric observations . during day observations ,",
    "the system will operate with only the coarse pointing as the star sensor will have difficulty identifying stars .",
    "individual components of the payload are described in detail below .",
    "the float altitudes have extreme environment conditions of low pressure , and the temperature can go down to @xmath4c or so .",
    "the low humidity and pressure at these altitudes demand extra care of high - voltage power supplies and detectors to prevent arcing .",
    "however , in contrast to space missions , the payload will experience lower vibrations and shocks .",
    "the system consists of an 80 mm spherical catadioptric telescope mounted on the pointing platform@xcite .",
    "it has a rectangular field of view of @xmath5 .",
    "the optical design is a two spherical mirror configuration and a double - pass corrector lens system .",
    "the secondary focus can house either a uv ccd with a suitable filter or a slit , depending on the mode of observation .",
    "the ccd is a @xmath6 pixels detector which operates at 12 frames per second ( fps ) .",
    "the instrument is designed to withstand loads up to 25 g. one of the main objectives is to scan the sky looking for transients .",
    "the instrument will acquire the images at a fast frame rate and will analyze each frame looking for brightness variations over the frames .",
    "the transient events will be stored on - board or transmitted back to the ground station through a radio link .    .spectrograph technical specifications [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]",
    "we plan to fly the payload on a zero - pressure balloon capable of floating at @xmath7 km altitude for up to 5 hours with the national balloon facility station of tifr at hyderabad@xcite in november of 2016 .",
    "the duration of the float will enable us to observe in the night ( with the launch 34 hours before sunrise ) for astronomical objects , and at daylight for atmospheric studies .",
    "the reference spectrum for trace gas analysis will be obtained at float , and the measurements will continue during descent@xcite .    in this flight",
    "we also plan to supplement the observational instruments with the detachable pre - sterilized sampling chamber _ sample _ ( stratospheric altitude microbiology probe for life existence)@xcite designed to collect and contain the dust stratospheric samples and get them back without contamination .",
    "november is the peak time for the leonid meteor shower , and we plan to collect cometary dust particles , where further study will be conducted to establish the possibility of microbial life in the upper atmosphere .",
    "we have presented an overview of our ballooning program and the instruments that currently are developed for astronomical observations .",
    "these instruments can also be used for atmospheric observations such as measuring the limb scattered uv radiance and trace gas strengths .    in our earlier high - altitude flights ,",
    "the payloads experienced frequent oscillations preventing us from continuous observation for a long duration .",
    "we have developed a pointing and stabilization platform with two - fold coarse / fine pointing , which will enable stable observations of regions of interest .",
    "we are testing and verifying the operation of our payloads on balloon flights with the intention of placing them on small satellites , such as , e.g. cubesats . going into space has the obvious advantages of longer mission life and the ability to go further into the far - uv .",
    "there is an increasing number of opportunities for small missions although without the quick response times possible with balloons , and the development of instrumentation skills will benefit our future access to space .",
