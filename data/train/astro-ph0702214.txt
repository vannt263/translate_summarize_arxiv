    "recent galaxy surveys ( e.g. , the 2df galaxy redshift survey , colless et al .  2001 and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , york et al .  2000 ) have provided ample data for the study of the large - scale distribution of galaxies in the present - day universe .",
    "the clustering of galaxies , which are tracers of the underlying dark matter distribution , gives a powerful test of hierarchical structure formation theory , especially when compared with fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background .",
    "indeed , the results show excellent agreement with the now - standard flat @xmath25-dominated concordance cosmology ( e.g. , spergel et al.2003 , 2006 ; tegmark et al .",
    "2004 , 2006 ; eisenstein et al .  2005 ; percival et al .",
    "the galaxy two - point correlation function is well - fit by a power law : @xmath3 on scales @xmath26 @xmath27 mpc , with comoving correlation length @xmath28 @xmath27 mpc and slope @xmath29 ( totsuji & kihara 1969 ; groth & peebles 1977 ; davis & peebles 1983 ; hawkins et al .",

    "2004 , 2005 ) .    at high redshifts and earlier times",
    ", the dark matter clustering strength should be weaker , but the first clustering studies of high - redshift galaxies with the keck telescope ( cohen et al .",
    "1996 ; steidel et al .  1998 ; giavalisco et al .  1998 ; adelberger et al.1998 ) showed that galaxies at @xmath31 show a similar comoving correlation length to those of today , results that have since been confirmed with much larger samples ( e.g. , adelberger et al .",

    "2005 ; kashikawa et al .  2006 ; meneux et al .  2006 ; lee et al .  2006 ; quadri et al .",
    "this is indeed expected : high - redshift galaxies are thought to form at rare peaks in the density field , which will be strongly biased relative to the dark matter ( kaiser 1984 ; bardeen et al .",
    "1986 ) ; under gravitational instability , the bias of galaxies drops over time as a function of redshift ( tegmark & peebles 1998 ; blanton et al .",
    "2000 ; weinberg et al .  2004 ) .",
    "luminous quasars offer a different probe of the clustering of galaxies at high redshift .",
    "powered by gas accretion onto central super - massive black holes ( salpeter 1964 ; lynden - bell 1969 ) , quasars are believed to be the progenitors of local dormant super - massive black holes which are ubiquitous in the centers of nearby bulge - dominated galaxies ( e.g. , kormendy & richstone 1995 ; magorrian et al .  1998 ; yu & tremaine 2002 ) .",
    "studies of the clustering properties of quasars date back to osmer ( 1981 ) ; in general , quasars have a clustering strength similar to that of luminous galaxies at the same redshift ( shaver 1984 ; croom & shanks 1996 ; porciani , magliocchetti & norberg 2004 , hereafter pmn04 ; croom et al .",
    "if the triggering of quasar activity is not tied to the larger - scale environment in which their host galaxies reside , this is not a surprising result ; quasars are interpreted as a stochastic process through which every luminous galaxy passes , and therefore the clustering of quasars should be no different from that of luminous galaxies .",
    "studies of the clustering of galaxies around quasars similarly find that quasar environments are similar to those of luminous galaxies ( serber et al.2006 , and references therein ) , although evidence for an enhanced clustering of quasars on small scales ( djorgovski 1991 ; hennawi et al .",
    "2006a ; but see also myers et al .",
    "2006c ) suggests that tidal effects within 100 kpc may trigger quasar activity .",
    "a number of studies have examined the redshift evolution of quasar clustering , but the results have been controversial : some papers conclude that quasar clustering either decreases or weakly evolves with redshift ( e.g. , iovino & shaver 1988 ; croom & shanks 1996 ) , while others say that it increases with redshift ( e.g. , kundic 1997 ; la franca et al .  1998 ; pmn04 ;",
    "croom et al .  2005 ) .",
    "myers et al .",
    "( 2006a , b , c ) examined the clustering of quasar candidates with photometric redshifts from the sdss ; they find little evidence for evolution in clustering strength between @xmath32 and today",
    ". these studies also find little evidence for a strong luminosity dependence of the quasar correlation function ( e.g. , croom et al.2005 ; connolly et al .",
    ", in preparation ) , which is in accord with quasar models in which quasar luminosity is only weakly related to black hole mass ( lidz et al .",
    "2006 ) .    the vast majority of quasars in flux - limited samples like the sdss ( and especially uv - excess surveys like the 2df qso redshift survey ; croom et al .",
    "2004 ) are at relatively low redshift , @xmath33 .",
    "more distant quasars are intrinsically rarer ( e.g. , richards et al .",
    "2006 ) , and at a given luminosity are of course substantially fainter .",
    "however , we might expect high - redshift quasars to be appreciably more biased than their lower - redshift counterparts .",
    "the high - redshift quasars in flux - limited samples are intrinsically luminous , and by the eddington argument , are powered by massive ( @xmath34 ) black holes .",
    "if the relation between black hole mass and bulge mass ( tremaine et al.2002 and references therein ) , and by extension , black hole mass and dark matter halo mass ( ferrarese 2002 ) holds true at high redshift , then luminous quasars reside in very massive , and therefore very rare halos at high redshift .",
    "rare , many@xmath35 peaks in the density field are strongly biased ( bardeen et al.1986 ) .",
    "thus detection of particularly strong clustering at high redshift would allow tests both of the relationship between quasars and their host halos , and the predictions of biasing models .",
    "the rarity of the halos in which quasars reside is of course related to the observed number density of quasars and their duty cycle / lifetime , thus the quasar luminosity function and the quasar clustering properties can be used to constrain the average quasar lifetime @xmath36 ( haiman & hui 2001 ; martini & weinberg 2001 ) , or equivalently , the duty cycle : the fraction of time a supermassive black hole shines as a luminous quasar .",
    "studies to date of the clustering of high - redshift quasars have been hampered by small number statistics .",
    "stephens et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and kundic ( 1997 ) examined three @xmath37 quasar pairs with comoving separations @xmath38 @xmath27 mpc in the palomar transit grism survey of schneider et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , and estimated a comoving correlation length @xmath39 @xmath27 mpc , which is three times higher than that of lower redshift quasars .",
    "schneider et al .",
    "( 2000 ) found a pair of @xmath40 quasars in the sdss separated by less than @xmath41 mpc ; this single pair implies a lower limit to the correlation length of @xmath42 mpc . similarly , the quasar pair separated by a few mpc at @xmath43 found by djorgovski et al .",
    "( 2003 ) also implies strong clustering at high redshift .",
    "however , measuring a true correlation function requires large samples of quasars . at @xmath44 , the mean comoving distance between luminous ( @xmath45 )",
    "quasars is @xmath46 mpc ( fan et al .",
    "2001 ; richards et al .",
    "2006 ) , thus to build up statistics on smaller - scale clustering in such a sparse sample requires a very large volume .",
    "the sdss quasar sample is the first survey of high - redshift quasars that covers enough volume to allow this measurement to be made .",
    "this paper presents the correlation function of high redshift ( @xmath47 ) quasars using the fifth data release ( dr5 ; adelman - mccarthy et al .",
    "2007 ) of the sdss .",
    "dr5 contains @xmath48 quasars with redshift @xmath47 .",
    "we construct a homogeneous flux - limited sample for clustering analysis in   [ sec : sample ] , with special focus on redshift determination in appendix  [ app : redshift ] , and the angular mask of the sample in appendix  [ app : geometry ] .",
    "we present the correlation function itself in   [ sec : cf ] , together with a discussion of its implications for quasar duty cycles and lifetimes .",
    "we conclude in section [ sec : con ] . throughout the paper",
    "we use the third year wmap @xmath49 all parameters ( spergel et al .",

    "comoving units are used in distance measurements ; for comparison with previous results , we will often quote distances in units of @xmath27 mpc .",
    "the sdss uses a dedicated 2.5-m wide - field telescope ( gunn et al.2006 ) which uses a drift - scan camera with 30 @xmath56 ccds ( gunn et al .",
    "1998 ) to image the sky in five broad bands ( @xmath57 ; fukugita et al .  1996 ) .",
    "the imaging data are taken on dark photometric nights of good seeing ( hogg et al.2001 ) , are calibrated photometrically ( smith et al .",

    "quasar candidates ( richards et al .",
    "2002b ) for follow - up spectroscopy are selected from the imaging data using their colors , and are arranged in spectroscopic plates ( blanton et al .",

    "the quasars observed through the third data release ( abazajian et al .",

    "( 2006 ) extend this catalog to the dr5 . in this paper , we will use results from dr5 , for which spectroscopy has been carried out over 5740 deg@xmath1 .",
    "because of the diameter of the fiber cladding , two targets on the same plate can not be placed closer than @xmath58 ( corresponding to @xmath59 mpc at @xmath60 ) might be observed on overlapped plates . ]",
    "; the present paper therefore concentrates on clustering on larger scales , and we will present a discussion of the correlation function on small scales in a paper in preparation .",
    "the quasar target selection algorithm is in two parts : quasars with @xmath61 are outliers from the stellar locus in the @xmath62 color cube , while those with @xmath63 are selected as outliers in the @xmath64 color cube .",
    "the quasar candidate sample is flux - limited to @xmath65 ( after correction for galactic extinction following schlegel , finkbeiner , & davis 1998 ) , but because high - redshift quasars are quite rare , the magnitude limit for objects lying in those regions of color space corresponding to quasars at @xmath31 are targeted to @xmath66 .",
    "the quasar locus crosses the stellar locus in color space at @xmath67 ( fan 1999 ) , meaning that quasar target selection is quite incomplete there ( richards et al .",
    "for this reason , we have chosen to define high - redshift quasars as those with @xmath68 .",
    "we draw our parent sample from the sdss dr5 catalog .",
    "we have taken all quasars with listed redshift @xmath68 from the dr3 quasar catalog ( schneider et al .",
    "2005 ) ; the redshifts of these objects have all been checked by eye , and we rectify a small number of incorrect redshifts in the database .",
    "this sample contains 3,333 quasars .",
    "in addition , we have included all objects on plates taken since dr3 with listed redshift @xmath68 as determined either from the official spectroscopic pipeline which determines redshifts by measuring the position of emission lines ( subbarao et al .",
    "2002 ) or an independent pipeline which fits spectra to quasar templates ( schlegel et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "we examined by eye the spectra of all objects with discrepant redshifts between the two pipelines .",
    "there are 2,805 quasars added to our sample from plates taken since dr3 .",
    "quasar emission lines are broad , and tend to show systematic wavelength offsets from the true redshift of the object ( richards et al .",
    "2002a and references therein ) .",

    "not all the quasars in our sample are suitable for a clustering analysis . here",
    "we follow richards et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and select only those quasars that are selected from a uniform algorithm .",
    "in particular :    * the version of the quasar target selection algorithm used for the sdss early data release ( stoughton et al .  2002 ) and the first data release ( dr1 ; abazajian et al .  2003 ) did a poor job of selecting objects with @xmath70 .",
    "we use only those quasars targeted with the improved version of the algorithm , i.e. , those with target selection version no lower than v3_1_0 . * some quasars are found using algorithms other than the quasar target selection algorithm described by richards et al.(2002b ) , including special selection in the southern galactic cap ( see adelman - mccarthy et al .",
    "2006 ) and optical counterparts to rosat sources ( anderson et al .",
    "the completeness of these auxiliary algorithms is poor , and we only include quasars targeted by the main algorithm . * because quasars are selected by their optical colors , regions of sky in which the sdss photometry is poor are unlikely to have complete quasar targeting .",
    "we now describe how the regions with poor photometry are identified .",
    "the sdss images are processed in a series of @xmath71 _",
    "fields_. we follow richards et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and mark a given field has having bad photometry if any one of the following criteria is satisfied :    * the @xmath72-band seeing is greater than 2@xmath73.0 ; * the operational database quality flag for that field is bad , missing or hole ( only 0.15% of all dr5 fields have one of these flags set ) ; * the median difference between the psf and large - aperture photometry magnitudes of bright stars lies more than 3@xmath74 from the mean over the entire dr5 sample in any of the five bands ; * any of the four principal colors of the stellar locus ( ivezi et al .",
    "2004 ) deviates from the mean of the dr5 sample by more than 3@xmath74 ; * any of the four values of the rms scatter around the mean principal color deviates from the mean over dr5 by more than 5@xmath74 , or , deviates from the dr5 mean by more than 2@xmath74 , and also deviates from the mean of that _ run _ by more than 3@xmath74 .",
    "this criterion reflects the fact that the statistics of the rms widths of the principal color distributions per field vary significantly from run to run .",
    "all the information we need to identify bad fields in this way can be retrieved from the runqa table in the sdss catalogue archive server ( cas ) .",
    "a total of 13.24% of the net area of the clustering subsample is marked as bad .",
    "these bad fields will serve as a secondary mask in our geometry description .",
    "we will compute the correlation function both including and excluding the bad regions , to test our sensitivity to possible selection problems in the bad regions .",

    "we conclude that this approach can only constrain the quasar lifetime within a very broad range of @xmath390 yr , which is , of course , consistent with many other approaches ( e.g. , martini 2004 and references therein ) . on the other hand , our results",
    "do show , on average , a larger @xmath36 and duty cycle for the higher redshift bin .",
    "there are other assumptions in our model that we should consider .",
    "in particular , there is the possibility that quasars cluster more than their dark matter halos due to physical effects that modulate the formation of quasars on very large scales .",
    "for example , the process of reionization may show large spatial modulation , which might affect the number density of young galaxies and quasars on large scales ( e.g. , babich & loeb 2006 ) .",
    "we have also assumed that each halo hosts only one luminous quasar",
    ". however , hennawi et al .  ( 2006a ) show that quasars ( at lower redshift ) are very strongly clustered on small scales , with some close binaries clearly in a single halo .",
    "searches for multiple quasars at higher redshift have also been successful ( hennawi et al . , in preparation ) , suggesting that at high redshift as well , a single halo can host more than one quasar .",
    "table [ table : lf ] uses the fiducial values of @xmath36 we derived for the @xmath391 case to estimate the minimal halo mass and bias factors of high redshift quasars , but the values of @xmath209 and @xmath20 depend only weakly on @xmath36 , as one can see from table [ table : example ] .",
    "the values of @xmath209 and @xmath20 are tabulated in table [ table : lf ] , for each of the redshift bins .",
    "note that the change of @xmath209 within each redshift bin may not be real because we have assumed constant @xmath36 throughout the redshift bin . on the other hand ,",
    "the host halos for the higher redshift bin have , on average , a larger minimal halo mass of @xmath392 than that for the lower redshift bin of @xmath393 .",
    "this is expected , because quasars in the higher redshift bin have higher mean luminosity and hence should reside in more massive halos . from table [",
    "table : lf ] it is clear that high redshift quasars are strongly biased objects , and the effective bias factor increases with redshift .",
    "we have used @xmath394 high redshift sdss quasars to measure the quasar correlation function at @xmath47 .",
    "the clustering of these high redshift quasars is stronger than that of their low redshift counterparts . over the range of @xmath395 mpc , the real - space correlation function",
    "is fitted by a power - law form @xmath3 with @xmath396 mpc and @xmath397 .",
    "when we divide the clustering ample into two broad redshift bins , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , we find that the quasars in the higher redshift bin show substantially stronger clustering properties , with a comoving correlation length @xmath398 mpc assuming a fixed power - law index @xmath11 .",
    "the lower redshift bin has a comoving correlation length @xmath399 mpc , assuming the same power - law index .",
    "we followed martini & weinberg ( 2001 ) to relate this strong clustering signal to the quasar luminosity function ( richards et al .",
    "2006 ) , the quasar lifetime and duty cycle , and the mass function of massive halos .",
    "we find the minimum mass @xmath209 of halos in which luminous quasars in our sample reside , as well as the clustering bias factor for these halos .",
    "high redshift quasars are highly biased objects with respect to the underlying matter , while the minimal halo mass shows no strong evolution with redshift for our flux - limited sample .",
    "quasars with @xmath400 reside in halos with typical mass @xmath401 ; quasars with @xmath10 reside in halos with typical mass @xmath402 .",
    "the slight difference of @xmath209 in the two redshift bins is expected because quasars in the higher redshift bin have mean luminosity that is approximately two times that of quasars in the lower redshift bin , and should reside in more massive halos .",
    "we further estimated the quasar lifetime @xmath36 .",
    "we get a @xmath36 value of @xmath14 myr for the @xmath9 bin and @xmath15 myr for the @xmath10 bin ; which is broadly consistent with the quasar lifetime of @xmath390 yr estimated from other methods ( e.g. , martini 2004 and references therein ) .",
    "this corresponds to a duty cycle of @xmath16 for the lower redshift bin and @xmath17 for the higher redshift bin , where we take the average halo lifetime to be @xmath383 gyr . in general",
    "we find the average lifetime is higher for the higher redshift bin , which could either be due to the redshift evolution or an effect of the luminosity dependence of @xmath36 .",
    "however , we emphasize that our approach is subject to a variety of uncertainties , including errors in the clustering measurements themselves , uncertainties in @xmath388 and the halo mass function , and the validity of the assumptions we have adopted .",
    "it is interesting to note that recent _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ studies on the clustering of x - ray selected agn have revealed a larger correlation length than optical agn .",
    "in particular , hard x - ray agn have a correlation length @xmath403 mpc at @xmath404 ( e.g. , basilakos et al .",
    "2004 ; gilli et al .",
    "2005 ; puccetti et al .",
    "2006 ; plionis 2006 ) .",
    "given the fact that x - ray selected agn have considerably lower mean bolometric luminosity than do optically - selected agn ( e.g. , mushotzky 2004 ) , this implies , once again , that the instantaneous luminosity is not a reliable indicator of the host halo mass at the low luminosity end ( e.g. , hopkins et al .",
    "shen et al .  (",
    "2007 ) have suggested an evolutionary model of agn accretion in which an agn evolves from being dominant in the optical to dominant in x - rays when the accretion rate drops . hence those strongly clustering hard x - ray agn were probably once very luminous quasars in the past with high peak luminosities .",
    "when they dim and turn into hard x - ray sources , their spatial clustering strength remains .",
    "however , the current x - ray agn sample is still very limited compared with optically selected samples , hence the uncertainty in the x - ray agn correlation length is large .",
    "the work described in this paper can be extended in a variety of ways .",
    "our sample can not explore clustering below @xmath405 mpc because of fiber collisions ; we are extending the methods of hennawi et al .",
    "( 2006a ) to find close pairs of high - redshift quasars , to determine whether the excess clustering found at moderate redshift extends to @xmath31 .",
    "extending the clustering analysis to lower luminosities will be important , given theoretical predictions of a strong luminosity dependence to the clustering signal at high redshifts ( hopkins et al.2006 ) .",
    "the repeat scans of the southern equatorial stripe in sdss ( adelman - mccarthy et al .",
    "2007 ) will allow us to extend the luminosity range of our sample , and redshifts of the fainter quasars are already being obtained ( jiang et al .",
    "the massive halos that we predict host the luminous quasars must also contain a substantial number of ordinary galaxies , and we plan deep imaging surveys of high - redshift quasar fields to measure the quasar - galaxy crosss - correlation function ( see stiavelli et al .  2005 ; ajiki et al .",
    "finally , more work is needed on simulations of quasar clustering .",
    "our quasar lifetime / duty cycle calculation is frustratingly imprecise , and further explorations of the behavior of highly biased rare halos at high redshifts may yield ways to constrain duty cycles more directly from the data , and understand the uncertainties of the technique in more detail .",
    "finally , we need to make more detailed comparisons of high - redshift quasar clustering with that of luminous galaxies at the same redshift .",
    "the duty cycle of quasars at these redshifts is a few percent at most , thus there is a population of galaxies with quiescent central black holes that is just as strongly clustered .",
    "the correlation length of lyman - break galaxies at these redshifts is @xmath406mpc ( adelberger et al .",
    "2005a ) , but the clustering strength appears to increase ( albeit at @xmath407 ) with increasing observed k - band luminosity ( adelberger et al .",
    "2005b ; allen et al .",
    "2005 ) and/or color ( quadri et al.2006 ) .",
    "the duty cycle we have calculated should agree with the ratio of number densities of luminous quasars , and that of the parent host galaxy population .",
    "the challenge will be to identify this parent population unambigously .",

    "each of these tiling rectangles lies completely within a single targeting chunk so that the target selection version is unique throughout the rectangle .",
    "although tiling rectangles of the same tiling chunk never overlap , tiling rectangles from different tiling chunks can overlap ; for example , the upper - left blue rectangle and the middle main green rectangle in fig .",

    "our sample covers a solid angle of 4041 deg@xmath1 , of which roughly 30% is in overlap sectors . because quasars in the overlap regions are not subject to the restriction of not targeting pairs separated by less than @xmath58 , and because the tiling algorithm deliberately places the tile overlap in regions of higher target density",
    ", one concern is that the angular selection function needs to take into account a higher selection function in the overlap region .",
    "however , we found that the number density of quasar candidates ( here looking at all redshifts , not just the high - redshift candidates ) , and the number density of spectroscopically confirmed quasars , were essentially identical in the overlap and non - overlap sectors .",
    "in contrast , the number density of spectroscopic galaxies in the overlap sectors ( 93.1 deg@xmath444 ) is 23% higher than that in the non - overlap sectors ( 75.4 deg@xmath444 ) , due to the deliberate placing of the overlaps in regions of high target density ; galaxies dominate the sdss spectroscopic targets , and beyond a subtle effect due to gravitational lensing ( scranton et al .",
    "2005 ) , we expect no correlation between the background quasars and the foreground galaxies .",
    "all this means that the angular selection function of our sample can be assumed to be uniform within the mask defined by the sectors that make up our sample . for dr5 ,",
    "the overall spectroscopic completeness of quasar candidates is @xmath445 , and the fraction of quasar candidates that are indeed quasars is @xmath446 .",
    "the angular quasar number density is @xmath447 deg@xmath444 .",
    "the benefit of overlapping two or more tiles within the same tiling chunk is to remove the limit on fiber collision ( i.e. , two fibers in one plate can not be placed closer than @xmath58 , therefore only one object is picked for spectroscopy ) ; and the tiling algorithm implemented in sdss is to shuffle the tiles within a tiling chunk to overlap more where there are more targeted galaxies ( blanton et al .",
    "therefore the expected galaxy number density in all overlap sectors on average should be higher than that in all non - overlap sectors . since we are using quasar samples , it is interesting to know whether or not the overall number density of observed quasars is higher in the overlap sectors than in the non - overlap sectors .",
    "one more subtlety is that tiling rectangles of a certain tiling chunk may overlap one or more other rectangles of another tiling chunk ( as is usually the case ) , resulting in a secondary intersection of sectors within one tiling chunk and sectors within another tiling chunk ( note that both non - overlap and overlap sectors themselves never intersect with each other if they belong to the same tiling chunk ) .",
    "this is to reduce the area that is not covered by tiles near the edge of a certain tiling chunk .",
