    "as was already mentioned , at @xmath127 we observe an unexpected ( from the geometric standpoint ) overextension of the @xmath15 symmetry , see sec .",
    "in light of our geometric understanding , the mirror symmetry discussed in sec .",
    "3.2 , presents the equivalence of quantum mechanics obtained by the reduction from two perfectly different manifolds ( [ 46 ] ) , with distinct scale factors , see fig .",
    "so far it was assumed that the coordinate @xmath22 is noncompact .",
    "let us now compactify it , i.e. proceed to the toroidal topology .",
    "equation ( [ l9 ] ) implies then that the period @xmath128 of the function @xmath24 defined in eq .",
    "( [ lsix ] ) vanishes if we start from any well - defined two - dimensional khler manifold .",
    "however , for the existence of sqm@xmath21 it is sufficient to assume that ( i ) @xmath24 is single - valued on @xmath101 ; ( ii ) equation ( [ l9 ] ) is valid locally , i.e. the integral @xmath129 need not be single - valued .",
    "thus , if we take the @xmath22 space to be @xmath30 and the function @xmath130 with a nonvanishing period , we arrive at sqm@xmath21 which can not be globally obtained by reduction from any two - dimensional khler manifold .",
    "( at the moment we do not know whether this solution can be obtained by reduction from a higher - dimensional khler manifold . )",
    "we have constructed , via dynamical reduction , a rather strange looking @xmath131 centrally extended quantum mechanics with @xmath132 .",
    "our geometrical construction partially explains the properties of the system obtained . however , not everything is explained . in particular ,",
    "the origin of the mirror symmetry and the overextended @xmath15 symmetry are not understood .    as follows from our work ,",
    "the problem of the general classification of extended superalgebras ( with the standard or even overextended @xmath15 symmetries ) in the form ( [ cerepre ] ) is an open question .",
    "the solution of this problem may well lead to new interesting geometrical structures encoded in the coefficients @xmath133 , see eq .",
    "( [ cerepre ] ) , which could be considered as a generalization of the khler geometry .",
