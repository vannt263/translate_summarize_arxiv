    "in this paper is to prove the existence of solutions of @xmath0 that satisfy the following behaviour @xmath1 this equation has been deduced in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "it arises in a two dimensional model describing steady coating of a bumpy surface by a thin - film approximation .",
    "in particular ( [ s2e3 ] ) results in the particular case that the motion of the fluid is driven by a balance of capillarity and gravity effects .    in some regions",
    "the curvature of the substrate induces capillary forces of the same order of magnitude than the gravitational ones . in the steady regime",
    "the model describing such flows has the form ( cf .",
    "( @xcite ) ) : @xmath2 where we have neglected some non - relevant terms .",
    "the variable @xmath3 stands for the arc - length that parametrises the substrate , and @xmath4 is the height of the fluid over this surface .",
    "the parameter @xmath5 is the ratio of the characteristic height of the fluid and the characteristic radius of curvature of the substrate .",
    "the function @xmath6 describes the balance between gravitational and the capillary forces induced by the geometry of the substrate , it measures the tendency of the fluid to move in the tangential direction to the substrate as a result of the afore mentioned forces .",
    "if the function @xmath6 has a constant sign , the motion of the fluid takes place always in the same direction .",
    "in such case , ( [ a1 ] ) can be approximated by the leading order term of ( [ a1]):@xmath7 however , this approximation breaks down and it can not be uniformly valid for arbitrary values of @xmath3 if @xmath6 changes sign . in such cases ( [ a2 ] ) predicts the onset of regions , where @xmath6 is close to zero , with infinite height @xmath4 , i.e. the fluid accumulates in those regions . as a consequence",
    ", the approximation ( [ a2 ] ) must be replaced by the model ( [ a1 ] ) . in the particular case",
    "in which in most of the substrate @xmath6 is positive , but there exists a sufficiently small region ( of size @xmath8 to be precise ) , where @xmath9 , a boundary layer analysis shows that , under suitable non - degeneracy conditions , the height of the fluid can be approximated by means of ( [ s2e3 ] ) , the height of the fluid becoming of order @xmath10 .",
    "this asymptotic analysis shows also that the solutions of ( [ s2e3 ] ) describing the stationary flows in those regions must satisfy ( [ s2e7 ] ) .",
    "equations similar to ( [ a1 ] ) where the main driving terms are the gravity and the curvature of the substrate , have been obtained , in a slightly different context , in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this model can be obtained also as a particular case of the ones considered in @xcite for specific choices of the parameters .",
    "see also @xcite for a model that neglects gravity .",
    "similar problems have been investigated in relation with industrial applications , such as the drainage of ( metal ) foams ( e.g. @xcite ) , manufacture of lenses ( e.g. @xcite and @xcite , although in the later case the effect of gravity can be neglected .",
    "these works offer numerical as well as formal ( using perturbation methods ) results .",
    "it is our aim to study the solutions of ( [ s2e3])-([s2e7 ] ) rigorously .",
    "the main result of the paper is the following :    [ main ] for any @xmath11 there exists a solution of ( [ s2e3 ] ) satisfying ( [ s2e7 ] ) .",
    "we sketch the main ideas in the proof of theorem  [ main ] .",
    "we first observe that the terms @xmath12 and @xmath13 in ( [ s2e3 ] ) give the natural scaling @xmath14 with @xmath15 ( cf .",
    "( [ s2e7 ] ) ) , which gives the leading order behaviour of ( [ s2e3 ] ) , namely , @xmath16 as @xmath17 gives the dominant balance problem @xmath18 in such set of variables @xmath19 and @xmath20 ( [ s2e3 ] ) becomes an autonomous dynamical system of the form @xmath21 that we shall denote by @xmath22 , for the unknown @xmath23 $ ] . here",
    "@xmath24 is defined by @xmath25 and the function @xmath26 is a linear combination of @xmath19 and its derivatives with coefficients that depend only on @xmath24 and that vanish at @xmath27 .",
    "thus , this system has the property that the three dimensional subspaces @xmath28 are invariant and the flow on them is described by the ode @xmath29 the system associated to ( [ odetapas ] ) for the unknown @xmath30 was studied in @xcite .",
    "it has one single critical point , @xmath31 and therefore @xmath22 has two critical points , @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "then , the solutions of ( [ s2e3 ] ) satisfying the matching conditions ( [ s2e7 ] ) correspond to solutions of @xmath22 contained in the trajectories that connect the critical point @xmath34 as @xmath35 to @xmath36 as @xmath37 . or equivalently , they are contained in heteroclinic orbits connecting these two critical points .",
    "the existence of a heteroclinic orbit for @xmath22 is proved by means of a shooting argument in the direction of decreasing @xmath20 .",
    "the shooting starts close to the invariant manifold @xmath38 and the final argument will require information of the flow on the invariant manifold @xmath39 .",
    "for that reason we shall need the following information on ( [ odetapas ] ) .",
    "first , that the critical point @xmath40 is hyperbolic and has a one - dimensional stable manifold and a two - dimensional stable manifold . secondly , we proved in @xcite that the only possible asymptotic behaviour of solutions on the stable manifold correspond to either @xmath41 or to @xmath42 we shall also recall later that ( [ odetapas ] ) has a increasing lyapunov function , and that this in particular guarantees the non - existence of periodic orbits .    to start the shooting we first prove that there exists an invariant two - dimensional centre - stable manifold @xmath43 locally defined near the point @xmath36 .",
    "all the trajectories associated to @xmath22 whose starting initial data is contained in @xmath43 converge to @xmath36 as @xmath37 .",
    "we can parametrise the set of trajectories in @xmath43 by means of one real parameter @xmath44 taking values in some large interval .",
    "the behaviours ( [ b1 ] ) and ( [ b2 ] ) define two sets of values @xmath44 .",
    "we prove that for very large values of @xmath44 the corresponding trajectory satisfies ( [ b1 ] ) .",
    "on the contrary , if @xmath44 is very negative we show that there exists a @xmath45 such that ( [ b2 ] ) .",
    "it turns out that the sets of values @xmath44 such that the corresponding trajectories satisfy either ( [ b1 ] ) or ( [ b2 ] ) are disjoint open sets .",
    "this implies , the existence of @xmath44 s for which the corresponding trajectory does not satisfy neither ( [ b1 ] ) nor ( [ b2 ] ) .",
    "the final step is to show that the trajectories associated to such @xmath44 are globally defined in @xmath46 and that they satisfy @xmath47 for some @xmath48 , and that @xmath49 the idea is that if ( [ b3 ] ) and ( [ b4 ] ) are satisfied we can use the fact that the dynamics of @xmath22 become close to the ones associated to the trajectories contained in the unstable manifold of @xmath40 for the system associated to ( [ odetapas ] ) and the trajectories have no alternative but to approach @xmath34 as @xmath35 .",
    "the most technical part of the paper is the proofs of ( [ b3 ] ) and of ( [ b4 ] ) .",
    "these require to show that oscillatory behaviours with large amplitude for the solutions of @xmath22 as @xmath35 must have a decreasing amplitude for decreasing @xmath20 if neither ( [ b1 ] ) nor ( [ b2 ] ) take place .",
    "the key point is that the structure of oscillatory solutions can be identified by looking at the several asymptotic regimes of ( [ s2e3 ] ) .",
    "there are , in particular , two very distinctive ones .",
    "for instance , the balance @xmath50 for very negative @xmath51 will be relevant in our analysis . in this case",
    "the behaviour of solutions is described by @xmath52 this equation can be integrated giving that , in such regions , @xmath53 behaves like a fifth order polynomial .",
    "the solutions of ( [ ecuacionminima1 ] ) are in fact a two - parameter family of polynomials , as we shall see . on the other hand , if @xmath54 on bounded intervals , the dominant balance there is given by the equation @xmath55 the analysis of ( [ ecuacionminima2 ] ) plays a crucial role in our proofs and was already studied in @xcite .",
    "the possibility of alternating regions where either ( [ ecuacionminima1 ] ) or ( [ ecuacionminima2 ] ) dominates , builds up a scenario where solutions with large oscillations exist : the bouncing region of the oscillations are described by ( [ ecuacionminima2 ] ) and the maximum amplitude regions are close to solutions of ( [ ecuacionminima1 ] ) .",
    "this phenomenon has been already observed for ( [ odetapas ] ) in @xcite and explored rigorously in @xcite .    in order to prove ( [ b1 ] ) and ( [ b2 ] ) we exploit this mechanism of oscillation .",
    "we argue by contradiction and assume first that ( [ b3 ] ) does not hold .",
    "this gives ( after a number of technical lemmas ) that there exists a sequence @xmath56 with @xmath57 such that @xmath58 is a local maximum and @xmath59 .",
    "we use that the oscillatory solutions with very large amplitude for very negative values of @xmath20 can be approximated , after a suitable rescaling , by a sequence of functions @xmath60 where each @xmath61 solves ( [ ecuacionminima1 ] ) in intervals @xmath62 $ ] . the values @xmath63 being such that @xmath64 is the minimum in @xmath65",
    ". in particular , in such intervals @xmath66 are close to a fifth order polynomial solving ( [ ecuacionminima1 ] ) .",
    "the matching between two consecutive such functions is done into the inner region where @xmath19 and @xmath61 become close to @xmath67 , as it turns out , this inner regions lies around @xmath63 . as we have mentioned the dynamics in such bouncing region",
    "are dominated by ( [ ecuacionminima2 ] ) and the rigorous matching can be adapted from that performed for ( [ odetapas ] ) ( see @xcite ) : the study of ( [ ecuacionminima2 ] ) reduces to the one of a phase - plane analysis in which the bouncing can be encoded into the behaviour of a separatrix .",
    "this object attracts trajectories for increasing @xmath51 , implying that its behaviour is generic . reading off this behaviour into the functions @xmath61 implies that in the outer region they behave as a polynomial with a double zero near @xmath68 .",
    "this in particular reduces the family of polynomials that give the outer region around each @xmath69 to a one - parameter family .",
    "moreover , this analysis allows to get information on the relative size of consecutive maxima and minima , namely that the sequence of the maximum values decreases and that the sequence of minimum values increases ( as @xmath70 ) and these contradict the assumption that ( [ b3 ] ) does not hold .",
    "the paper is organised as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : preliminaries ] is divided in three preliminary parts .",
    "first in section  [ sec : summary ] we give some results concerning ( [ odetapas ] ) , most of which are proved in @xcite . in section  [ sec",
    ": ds ] we reformulate ( [ s2e3 ] ) as a four dimensional dynamical system and reformulate theorem  [ main ] in this setting .",
    "the third part is section  [ sec : loc - analysis ] where we prove the existence of the centre - unstable manifold around @xmath36 .",
    "section  [ sec:3 ] is devoted to the analysis of the behaviours ( [ b1 ] ) and ( [ b2 ] ) for @xmath22 ; in section  [ sec : stability ] we show stability under small perturbations of solutions that satisfy either of these properties , and in section  [ sec : classes ] we give necessary conditions on solutions of ( [ s2e3 ] ) to satisfy either ( [ b1 ] ) or ( [ b2 ] ) . with",
    "the analysis carried out up to here we can then prove in section  [ sec:4 ] that there exist solutions on @xmath43 that do not satisfy neither ( [ b1 ] ) nor ( [ b2 ] ) .",
    "we continue by proving that these trajectories of @xmath43 do satisfy ( [ b3 ] ) and ( [ b4 ] ) . in order to do that we first find in section  [ sec : dynamics ]",
    "that if ( [ b3 ] ) is not satisfied the sequences @xmath56 and @xmath71 , described above , are well defined .",
    "second , in section  [ sec : proof : osci ] we find the contradictory results that @xmath72 is decreasing and that @xmath73 is increasing .",
    "this part is very technical and needs by itself a few steps .",
    "thus , in section  [ sec : aux ] we identify the scales of the outer region and the approximating polynomials near local maxima .",
    "this is based on the analysis of the solutions of ( [ ecuacionminima1 ] ) that is carried out in appendix  [ sec : polynomials ] . in section",
    "[ sec : rescale : h ] we perform the right scaling of the solutions under consideration and identify the range in which they are approximated by the polynomials . in this section",
    "we also prove that the approximating polynomials must have a double zero .",
    "this step requires the analysis of ( [ ecuacionminima2 ] ) given in appendix  [ sec : summary : ii ] as well as the _ matching lemma _ given in appendix  [ sec : control ] ( a result that has been adapted from @xcite ) . in section  [ sec : formal ] , with detailed information of the matching regions , we derive an ( iterative ) expression that relates the elements of the sequence of local maxima and another that relates the local minima , and that contradict that ( [ b3 ] ) is not satisfied .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec:6 ] we finish the prove of theorem  [ main ] .    finally , we recall that equations similar to ( [ odetapas ] ) have been studied intensively , see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) , to mention a few , where similar equations arise in several related physical situations .",
    "rigorous results concerning such equations can be found also in @xcite and , concerning travelling wave solutions , in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that many of these models yield higher order odes describing oscillatory fluid interfaces .",
    "we refer to @xcite , where this aspect and related works are put into context .",
    "we now summarise some properties of ( [ odetapas ] ) , most of which have been proved in @xcite and will be used later in the proof of theorem  [ main ] .",
    "it is convenient to rewrite ( [ odetapas ] ) in the equivalent form@xmath74 we then have the following result .",
    "[ tapas1 ]    1 .",
    "there is a unique critical point for ( [ s3e1 ] ) in the domain @xmath75 given by:@xmath76 2 .",
    "the point @xmath40 is hyperbolic .",
    "the stable manifold of ( [ odetapas ] ) at the point @xmath40 is tangent to the vector : @xmath77{c}3^{-\\frac{2}{3}}\\\\ -3^{-\\frac{1}{3}}\\\\ 1 \\end{array } \\right)\\ ] ] and the corresponding eigenvalue is @xmath78 .",
    "3 .   at @xmath40",
    "there is a two - dimensional unstable manifold locally spanned by the eigenvectors @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "the eigenvalues associated to the plane spanned by @xmath81 are @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "4 .   the trajectories associated to ( [ s3e1 ] ) that are contained in the stable manifold and satisfy @xmath84 , behave in one of the two following ways for decreasing @xmath20 : either they are defined for all @xmath46 and satisfy @xmath85 or , alternatively , there exists a @xmath86 such that @xmath87 moreover , the points of the stable manifold associated to @xmath40 with @xmath88 satisfy ( [ p1 ] ) and those with @xmath89 satisfy ( [ p2 ] ) .",
    "suppose that there exist @xmath90 and @xmath91 such that @xmath92 for all @xmath93 , then @xmath94 and the corresponding trajectory is contained in the unstable manifold of @xmath40 .",
    "all the statements of this proposition have been already proved in @xcite except for _ ( v)_. in order to prove this , we use an argument similar to the one used to prove lemma  2.4 in @xcite .",
    "we first recall that there exists an increasing lyapunov functional @xmath95 associated to ( [ odetapas ] ) : @xmath96 this and the assumptions made imply that @xmath97 using ( [ s3e1 ] ) , it then follows that @xmath98 . indeed , arguing by contradiction",
    ", one can construct a sequence @xmath99 such that there exits a @xmath100 such that either @xmath101 or @xmath102 .",
    "then ( [ s3e1 ] ) implies that @xmath103 , so either @xmath104 for @xmath105 or @xmath106 for @xmath105 . but",
    "this contradicts ( [ finite : integral ] ) ) since either @xmath107 or @xmath108 for all @xmath109 .",
    "now the second equation in ( [ s3e1 ] ) implies that @xmath110 remains approximately constant as @xmath35 in any finite interval of arbitrary fixed length @xmath111 . therefore ,",
    "if there is a subsequence @xmath112 with @xmath113 satisfying @xmath114 , we obtain that @xmath115 } |w(\\tau)| \\geq\\varepsilon_{0}>0 $ ] for @xmath109 sufficiently large .",
    "it then follows from the first equation in ( [ s3e1 ] ) that the condition @xmath116 fails if @xmath111 is assumed to be sufficiently large ( integration on the interval @xmath117 for sufficiently large @xmath109 gives that @xmath118 , but @xmath119 for all @xmath109 and @xmath111 ) .",
    "therefore @xmath120 .    using the last equation in ( [ s3e1 ] ) as well as",
    "the fact that @xmath98 it then follows in a similar way that @xmath121 .",
    "this gives ( [ s3e3b ] ) and the result follows .    the next lemma gives the detailed asymptotic behaviour in both cases ( [ p1 ] ) and ( [ p2 ] ) :    [ tapas2 ] the trajectories associated to ( [ s3e1 ] ) that are contained in the stable manifold and satisfy @xmath122 satisfy that either they are defined for all @xmath46 and ( [ p1 ] ) holds with @xmath123 or , alternatively , there exists a @xmath86 such that ( [ p2 ] ) holds with @xmath124    that either ( [ p1 ] ) or ( [ p2 ] ) hold is just the statement _ ( iv ) _ of proposition  [ tapas1 ] .",
    "then , ( [ p1:prime ] ) follows from ( [ p1 ] ) and integrating the equation",
    ". indeed , for all @xmath125 there exist a @xmath126 with @xmath127 large enough so that for all @xmath128 , then @xmath129 thus @xmath130 and integrating this expression with @xmath131 we obtain @xmath132 for @xmath127 large enough . then dividing by @xmath133 and taking the limit @xmath35 implies ( [ p1:prime ] ) , since @xmath126 can be made arbitrarily negative and @xmath134 arbitrarily large .    in order to prove ( [ p2:prime ] ) we use the phase - plane analysis of the appendix  [ sec : summary : ii ] .",

    "the flow field of the phase plane of ( [ phi0system ] ) is also depicted in figure  [ phase - plane ] where , in particular , the direction of the field , the critical point @xmath138 and the attractive separatrix @xmath139 are shown . using lemma  [ tozero - bwds ] and the behaviour of trajectories of the system ( [ phi0system ] ) entering the only critical point @xmath138 as @xmath140 it is easy to show that if @xmath141 then , by a bootstrap argument , the trajectory @xmath142 remains close to @xmath138 , in particular the estimate ( [ w3e6e ] ) holds for @xmath143 large enough .",
    "that ( [ hyp1 ] ) and that @xmath144 are satisfied is a consequence of the proof of ( [ p2 ] ) in @xcite and the transformation ( [ sephi0-trans ] ) .    using the first equation in ( [ phi - z - system ] )",
    "one obtains that there exists positive constants @xmath145 and @xmath146 such that @xmath147 with @xmath148 , for all @xmath149 where @xmath150 and @xmath151 is sufficiently large . and",
    "this in particular implies that @xmath152 using now the last equation of ( [ sephi0-trans ] ) and ( [ phi:0:esti ] ) one can infer that , considering @xmath20 as a function of @xmath143 @xmath153 ( where we use @xmath154 to compute the explicit coefficient ) . finally , this and ( [ phi:0:limit ] ) imply ( [ p2:prime ] ) .",
