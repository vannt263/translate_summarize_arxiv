    "the last few years have seen rapid and exciting developments in light meson spectroscopy , largely as a result of the analysis of high - statistics experiments using hadron beams .",
    "the most notable discoveries have come from studies of @xmath2 annihilation at lear and @xmath3 at the ags ( bnl ) and ves ( serpukhov ) . in both processes",
    "we have seen that detailed amplitude analyses of high - statistics events samples ( ca.1 m events ) have made possible the identification of very interesting parent resonances in otherwise relatively mundane final states such as @xmath4 .",
    "this has led for example to the discovery of a glueball candidate in @xmath5 and an exotic hybrid candidate in @xmath6 .",
    "concurrently we have seen impressive progress in the study of conventional @xmath7 mesons ( which must be identified as a background to more unusual resonances ) , and at this meeting we have heard important new results from vepp which appear to confirm the predictions of close , isgur and kumano for a @xmath8-molecule assignment for the scalars @xmath9 and @xmath10 . in this case at least , progress has come from an @xmath11 facility rather than a hadronic one . in this introduction",
    "i will give a brief summary of the status of the various sectors of meson spectroscopy , and then discuss two areas in which dafne can make very important contributions , excited vectors and c=(+ ) mesons .",
    "the gluonic degree of freedom in qcd leads to more physical resonances than are predicted by the naive @xmath7 quark model .",
    "pure - glue  glueball \" states have been studied using many theoretical approaches , the most recent and ( presumably ) the most accurate of which is lattice gauge theory ( lgt ) . in recent years lgt",
    "has largely displaced other theoretical methods for treating these most unfamiliar of hadrons .",
    "a recent high - statistics lgt study of the glueball spectrum to ca.4  gev has been reported by morningstar and peardon@xcite(see fig.1 ) ; for other recent discussions of glueballs and lgt see teper@xcite and michael.@xcite the lattice predicts that the lightest ( assumed unmixed with @xmath7 ) glueball is a scalar , with a mass of about 1.7  gev .",
    "additional glueballs lie well above 2 gev , with a @xmath12 and a @xmath13 appearing at masses of @xmath14 gev .",
    "spin - parity exotic glueballs are expected at rather higher masses ; in the morningstar and peardon study the lightest exotic glueball was found to be a @xmath15 at just above 4  gev . for experimental studies of meson spectroscopy below ca.2.2  gev",
    ", the subject of glueballs thus reduces to the search for an extra scalar .",
    "scalars unfortunately comprise the most obscure part of the spectrum , and there are at least three states that might _ a priori _ be identified with a scalar glueball , the @xmath16 , the lear state @xmath17@xcite and the @xmath18 radiative candidate @xmath19.@xcite    there are outstanding problems with each of these assignments . in view of lgt mass predictions",
    "the @xmath17 and @xmath19 appear most plausible , but neither of these states shows the flavor - blind pattern of decay couplings naively expected for a flavor - singlet glueball .",
    "the @xmath17 as seen by crystal barrel in @xmath20 is shown in fig.2 .",
    "the results of some analyses , taken from the 1998 pdg , are shown in table  1 .",
    "although essentially all these numbers are controversial , it is clear that the @xmath21 branching ratios of the @xmath17 and @xmath19 are both far from the approximate equality expected for a flavor - singlet .",
    "we also note that the two lighter states have large @xmath22 modes , which have not been considered in glueball decay models .    0.1 in    .",
    "_ some two - pseudoscalar branching fractions of @xmath23 states quoted by the pdg.@xcite _ [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table4 ]    there are analogous states reported in the isosinglet sector , the @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "( the situation may be more complicated .",
    "see in particular the recent results on @xmath26 from vepp,@xcite which show a very low mass peak at about 1220  mev . ) in the @xmath27 sector we have evidence for only a single excitation , the @xmath28 .",
    "interest in the excited vectors has increased with the realization that the lightest hybrid meson multiplet includes a @xmath29 ( in both the flux - tube and bag models ) , and that these hybrid vectors are predicted to be rather narrow . indeed , in the hybrid meson decay calculations of close and page ( using the isgur - kokoski - paton flux - tube model ) the narrowest hybrid found was the @xmath30-flavor @xmath29 .",
    "( see table 3 for the predicted partial widths of this vector hybrid . )",
    "the close - page calculations assumed a mass of 2.0  gev for the @xmath31 and @xmath32 hybrid vectors , but given the reports of the @xmath33 and @xmath34 hybrid candidates , one should also consider the possibility that the lowest hybrid multiplet lies at about 1.5  gev .",
    "this would give us a third @xmath29 level roughly degenerate with the quark model 2s and d levels , and such light vector hybrids could be very narrow ( see table  3 ) ; a hypothetical @xmath35 is predicted to have a total width of only about 20  mev !",
    "if the @xmath29 hybrid states are not found at this low mass , one might question the reports of @xmath36 @xmath37 exotics near 1.5  gev .",
    "the topic of vector meson spectroscopy in this mass region was recently reviewed by donnachie and kalashnikova,@xcite who concluded that additional vectors beyond the expected @xmath7 states are indeed required to fit the data in both @xmath38 and @xmath39 channels . in @xmath39 in particular ,",
    "the weakness of @xmath40 relative to @xmath41 can not be explained by the expected @xmath42 decays alone .    in principle one",
    "should be able to separate the 2s , d and h ( hybrid ) states by studies of their relative decay branching fractions . in tables 2 - 4",
    "we show theoretical predictions for the different types of states , compared to 1998 pdg results for experimental branching fractions . the relative strength of the broad @xmath22 modes @xmath43 and @xmath44 is quite sensitive to the type of parent resonance , and could serve as a useful discriminator if the decay models are accurate .",
    "the theoretical expectation is that the d state should populate both modes , h should only populate @xmath44 , and the 2s state does not couple significantly to either of these modes .",
    "how well do these theoretical predictions agree with experiment ?",
    "the experimental branching fractions of excited vectors , as reported in the 1998 pdg , are also shown in tables 2 - 4 .",
    "it is clear at a glance that experiment is in a woeful state .",
    "almost nothing is known about the decays of excited @xmath30 and @xmath27 states .",
    "( note that excited @xmath27 vectors can be isolated by studying the @xmath45-filter mode @xmath46 , which was apparently not attempted previously . ) in the @xmath47 sector , there are promising indications that the @xmath42 may be observed in many of the expected channels , but there is almost no quantitative information about relative branching fractions which we require for tests of the decay models . in contrast , there are strong limits claimed for @xmath48 branching fractions , which appear to be very different from expectations for a simple 2s radial excitation . note especially the tight limit @xmath49 .",
    "taken literally , this result is very interesting in that it argues strongly against a 2s assignment for the @xmath48 .",
    "( compare the @xmath50 and @xmath48 entries in table  2 . )",
    "unfortunately it is difficult to reconcile this number with the reported _ dominance _ of @xmath51 ( table  3 ) , since that decay differs from @xmath52 only by a flavor factor of 3 ( favoring @xmath51 ) and minor changes in phase space .",
    "recently the crystal barrel collaboration attempted to separate the contributions of the @xmath48 and @xmath42 to the various @xmath22 final states .",
    "initially the results appeared consistent with the usual quark model assignments 2s and d,@xcite but the most recent work@xcite has found that essentially all broad @xmath22 modes ( @xmath53 and @xmath54 ) are important in the decays of both the @xmath48 and the @xmath42 ! unfortunately the statistical errors of this many - parameter fit are rather large , so each mode typically has a fitted branching fraction about @xmath55 from zero .",
    "the excited vectors would evidently benefit from a study at an @xmath11 facility such as dafne , where the complication of competing amplitudes in many other @xmath56 channels is not present .    in view of the poorly constrained and perhaps inconsistent branching fractions evident in the pdg , the most reasonable approach in future",
    "would probably be to study as many of the quasi - two - body decay modes in tables 2 - 4 as possible , determine numerical values for the relative branching fractions , and carry out a global fit of each flavor sector with an assumed two versus three parent resonances in each flavor .",
    "in the opinion of at least two lear experimentalists,@xcite using @xmath1 collisions to clarify the scalar sector is the most interesting contribution dafne could make to spectroscopy .",
    "two - photon couplings of resonances can be inferred by measurement of the cross section @xmath57 which is proportional to the two - photon width @xmath58 of the resonance @xmath59 , as discussed in sec.36.3 of the 1998 pdg.@xcite two - photon widths of @xmath60 resonances have been measured at several @xmath11 facilities in the past , most recently at lep.@xcite these are especially interesting quantities because they show considerable variation between @xmath7 and non-@xmath7 states , and if determined with sufficient accuracy they could be used for example to solve the problem of the assignments of the various light scalars .",
    "this subject attracted considerable interest and effort previously , but as @xmath61 is an @xmath62 process and the cross section falls rapidly with @xmath63 , it was not possible to obtain adequate statistics for a definitive analysis .",
    "the two - photon partial widths of @xmath7 states within a flavor multiplet in the su(3 ) limit are in the ratio @xmath64 so if a candidate @xmath7 state such as the @xmath13 @xmath65 is reported , one should also observe its flavor partners at about this relative strength .",
    "for example , the @xmath58 widths of the @xmath13 multiplet are @xmath66 ( moderate suppression of the @xmath45 coupling is expected theoretically due to the heavier strange quark mass . )",
    "scalars are predicted to have very characteristic two - photon couplings .",
    "the largest @xmath58 width expected for any @xmath7 meson is for the @xmath67p@xmath68 @xmath23 scalar ; in the nonrelativistic quark model it has a @xmath58 width 15/4 times that of the @xmath69 , and with relativistic corrections@xcite the ratio is reduced to @xmath70 .",
    "thus for a scalar @xmath71 partner of the @xmath65 we expect a two - photon width of about 5 kev .",
    "an @xmath72 scalar signal of about this strength was observed by the crystal ball collaboration in @xmath73 at desy,@xcite and may be the long - sought and still obscure @xmath71 scalar .",
    "in contrast , a pure scalar glueball should have a much smaller two - photon width , since it has no direct coupling to photons .",
    "the recent aleph results on @xmath1 couplings of resonances appear to support the @xmath17 as a glueball candidate , since their upper limit@xcite @xmath74 is far below the ca .",
    "5  kev expected for an @xmath71 scalar .",
    "the various @xmath75 mixing models in contrast would predict @xmath58 widths roughly proportional to each state s @xmath71 amplitude squared , and so could be tested by the relative strength of each scalar resonance in @xmath73 .",
    "finally , @xmath8 molecules@xcite and multiquark states@xcite are predicted to have much smaller @xmath58 widths than the corresponding @xmath71 states , which is in agreement with the sub - kev @xmath58 values reported for the @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "in contrast with the non - observation of the scalar glueball candidate @xmath17 in @xmath1 , we now have clear evidence for the pseudoscalar @xmath76 in @xmath77 , reported by the l3 collaboration.@xcite once a glueball candidate ( this assignment is now implausible due to the high mass predicted for the pseudoscalar glueball by lgt ) , this state appears most likely to be a radially - excited @xmath7 .",
    "similarly there is a possible observation of the scalar glueball candidate @xmath19 by l3 in @xmath78 , although this is preliminary .",
    "if the @xmath19 appears clearly in @xmath1 at the rate expected for a radially - excited @xmath79p@xmath68 @xmath71 state , we may be able to eliminate it as a glueball candidate in favor of the @xmath17 .",
    "clearly , accurate measurements of scalar @xmath58 couplings show great promise as a technique for solving the long standing problem of the nature of the various @xmath23 scalar resonances .",
    "it is a pleasure to acknowledge the kind invitation of the organizers of the dafne meeting to discuss the status of light meson spectroscopy .",
