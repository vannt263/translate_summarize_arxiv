    "ever since the experimental discovery of the electroweak vector bosons @xmath9 and @xmath10 ( generically denoted by @xmath11 henceforth , unless specified otherwise ) at the cern @xmath12 collider , studies on their production in collider experiments have provided important means to examine the electroweak standard model ( sm ) , and to explore new physics beyond the sm @xcite .",
    "the production of two gauge - bosons @xcite at hadron and @xmath13 colliders may provide a crucial test of the non - abelian three - gauge - boson interactions @xcite , because of intimate cancellation in the sm between the contributions of gauge - boson exchanges in the @xmath14-channel and fermion exchanges in the @xmath15- and @xmath16-channels .",
    "the production of three gauge - bosons @xcite involves four - gauge - boson interactions and should be sensitive to these quartic vertices @xcite .",
    "recent experimental studies of gauge - boson pair events at hadron colliders have set limits on anomalous couplings for the three - gauge - boson interactions from the direct production channels @xcite .",
    "further improvements on those studies are anticipated from future experiments with the tevatron main injector ( an annual integrated luminosity of 1 fb@xmath4 ) .",
    "a possible further upgrade of the tevatron ( a luminosity of order 10@xmath17@xmath18s@xmath4 @xcite or about 10 fb@xmath4/yr , and a possible energy upgrade to 4 tev @xcite ) , especially the lhc ( a luminosity of @xmath19 fb@xmath4 @xcite ) may also add to these studies @xcite .",
    "experiments at lep ii will study the process @xmath20 in great detail @xcite .",
    "the future @xmath13 linear colliders will explore not only the processes of pair gauge - boson production , but also the triple gauge - boson production @xcite .",
    "furthermore , since heavy particles often decay to gauge - bosons as a final state , it is important to examine the multi - gauge - boson production in searching for new physics .",
    "the most notable example is that the recent studies on @xmath21 + 2-jet and @xmath22 + 4-jet events at the fermilab tevatron have resulted in the discovery of the elusive top quark @xcite .",
    "other examples include a heavy higgs boson decay @xmath23 @xcite ; heavy chargino and neutralino decays and squark / gluino cascade decays in supersymmetric theories @xcite ; longitudinal gauge - boson strong scattering @xcite ; new heavy gauge - boson decays @xcite ; and other exotic heavy particles that may decay to electroweak gauge - bosons @xcite .    motivated by the great success of the fermilab tevatron experiments , we carry out the calculation for three electroweak - gauge - boson production in the sm for the energy range @xmath24 tev , relevant to future experiments at a tevatron upgrade for luminosity and center of mass energy @xcite .",
    "we have considered all combinations for the three electroweak - gauge - boson processes ( except for the pure qed process of three - photon production ) : @xmath25 since a top quark almost exclusively decays to a @xmath26 final state , there will be significant contribution to @xmath27 production from @xmath28 decays .",
    "we therefore also include the top - quark channels @xmath29 these processes of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : vgg][eq : ttv ] ) have rather small production cross sections at tevatron energies , typically being of order 10 fb , about 100 times smaller than the gauge - boson pair production .",
    "however , as we will see , it is possible to observe those processes at an upgraded tevatron .",
    "they must be quantified in order to explore the quartic gauge - boson self - interactions .",
    "moreover , they need to be reliably estimated in searching for new physics , such as in the multi - charged lepton channels in susy searches @xcite .    in sec .",
    "ii , we present the cross sections of the processes in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : vgg][eq : ttv ] ) . in sec .",
    "iii , we discuss the results with leptonic final states from the gauge - boson decays and some typical kinematical distributions .",
    "we finally summarize our results in sec .",
    "the processes listed in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : vgg][eq : ttv ] ) have been individually studied in the literature , but only in @xmath30 collisions at supercollider energies .",
    "the processes @xmath31 @xcite and @xmath32 @xcite in eq .",
    "( [ eq : vgg ] ) have been calculated as backgrounds to the intermediate higgs boson signal for @xmath33 .",
    "these in eq .",
    "( [ eq : vvg ] ) were first evaluated in ref . @xcite and those of eq .",
    "( [ eq : vvv ] ) in refs .",
    "@xcite . calculations for the @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 processes first appeared in refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "we have been able to reproduce the total cross sections in the literature whenever available to compare .    in this section , we present the total cross sections for all the production processes in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : vgg][eq : ttv ] ) in @xmath37 collisions at tevatron energies . in our numerical calculations",
    ", we have adopted the helicity amplitude techniques , following the schemes in refs . @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we have chosen the following input mass parameters @xcite : @xmath38 gev , @xmath39 gev , @xmath40 gev , and @xmath41 .",
    "we use the parton distribution functions set a of martin - roberts - stirling @xcite . for the processes of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : vgg][eq : vvv ] ) , the factorization scale is set at the parton c.  m.  energy @xmath42 ; while for the processes of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ttv ] ) , we set the renormalization scale in @xmath43 and the factorization scale both at twice of the top - quark mass @xmath44 .",
    "figure  [ fig : vgg ] shows the total cross sections for processes with one or two direct photons , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : vgg][eq : vvg ] ) . to avoid the infrared divergence for the final state photons in our tree - level calculation and to roughly simulate the experimental detector coverage ,",
    "we have imposed some minimal cutoff on the transverse momentum ( @xmath45 ) and the pseudorapidity ( @xmath46 ) as @xmath47 where @xmath48 , with @xmath49 the polar angle of the photon in the parton c.  m.  frame with respect to the proton direction .",
    "no cuts are applied to the @xmath9 and @xmath10 throughout this paper ; but we will comment in sec .",
    "ii on the effects if experimental acceptance cuts are imposed .",
    "we see that at @xmath50=2 tev , the total cross sections are about 7 fb for @xmath51 ( lowest ) and 44 fb for @xmath52 and @xmath53 ( highest ) . for comparison ,",
    "the cross sections for @xmath54 and @xmath55 production at 2 tev are about 16 pb and 17 pb , respectively . increasing the c.  m.  energy from 2 tev to 4 tev",
    "would enhance the production cross sections for the triple gauge - boson production by about a factor of 3 .",
    "naively , one would expect that the @xmath9-related cross sections should be larger than those of @xmath10 , like in the case of drell - yan production of @xmath9 and @xmath10 bosons , due to the weak charge - current coupling being stronger than the neutral - current coupling .",
    "it is therefore surprising to see that @xmath31 rate is even smaller than that of @xmath56 .",
    "in fact , this is due to some severe gauge cancellation in @xmath57 process , a phenomenon called radiation amplitude zero @xcite .",
    "the fact that the @xmath58 cross section tends to be somewhat smaller than naively expected ( compared to @xmath59 and @xmath60 cases ) may be also traced to a radiation amplitude zero for @xmath55 process @xcite and an approximate zero in @xmath61 process @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : vvv ] presents the total cross sections for processes with three massive bosons , eq .",
    "( [ eq : vvv ] ) .",
    "the cross sections are generally smaller by about an order of magnitude if we replace a photon [ with our choice of the cuts in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gcut ] ) ] by a @xmath10",
    ". the cross section rates at @xmath50=2 tev are about 0.5 fb for @xmath62 process ( lowest ) and 6 fb for @xmath5 process ( highest ) . again for comparison , the cross sections for @xmath63 , @xmath61 and @xmath64 production at 2 tev are about 1.1 pb , 2.5 pb and 9.2 pb , respectively . it is interesting to note that the higgs boson in the sm contribute to the processes of eq .",
    "( [ eq : vvv ] ) through @xmath65 . in the calculation for fig .",
    "[ fig : vvv ] , we have taken the higgs boson mass @xmath66 gev , for which there is no significant contribution from @xmath67 in @xmath68 production .",
    "if the higgs boson mass is just above the @xmath69 pair threshold , the enhancement to @xmath68 production could be sizeable .",
    "the higgs boson effects are demonstrated in fig .  [",
    "fig : higgs ] , where the total cross sections are plotted versus @xmath70 for @xmath0 tev .",
    "we see that the increase right above the threshold is as much as a factor of 4 for @xmath71 and @xmath62 channels through @xmath72 , and a factor of 6 for @xmath5 and @xmath73 through @xmath74 .    for the top - quark induced triple gauge - boson production ( via @xmath75 with a 100% branching fraction )",
    ", the @xmath76 production goes only through @xmath77-annihilation diagrams , in which one of the light quarks radiates a @xmath78 ; while @xmath79 and @xmath80 get contributions from both @xmath81-annihilation and @xmath82-fusion . at tevatron energies , the valence quark contributions dominate and",
    "the @xmath82-fusion only contributes a few percent .",
    "cross sections for those channels are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : ttv ] .",
    "formally , these processes are of order @xmath83 , compared to the electroweak triple gauge - boson cross section of order @xmath84 .",
    "however , due to phase space suppression from the large top - quark mass , the production cross sections in fig .",
    "[ fig : ttv ] are comparable to that of @xmath52 in fig .",
    "[ fig : vgg ] and those of @xmath85 and @xmath86 in fig .",
    "[ fig : vvv ] , although the rates for the @xmath87 processes increase more rapidly than those of @xmath68 for higher energies .",
    "since the heavy top quark often gives a hard @xmath88-jet as a decay product , one may be able to separate the electroweak @xmath89 process from @xmath90 by examining the additional jet activities , if desired .",
    "we have not included the processes resulting from @xmath91 , such as @xmath92 the decay branching fraction of @xmath91 is never larger than those of @xmath93 which we included in the calculations for eq .",
    "( [ eq : vvv ] ) . also , the cross sections of eq .",
    "( [ eq : vh ] ) would be large only if @xmath94 gev , where the total rate at tevatron energies must be very small due to the phase space suppression .",
    "the predicted cross sections for triple gauge - boson production in the sm , as shown in figs .  [ fig : vgg][fig : ttv ] , at tevatron energies may result in a sizeable number of events if the luminosity is sufficiently high . with the tevatron main injector , an annual integrated luminosity of order 1 fb@xmath4",
    "is envisioned .",
    "a further upgrade of the luminosity to reach 10 fb@xmath95year may become reality @xcite .",
    "however , in the hadron collider environment , the large qcd backgrounds may render the observation impossible for those events if one or more of the gauge bosons decay hadronically .",
    "individual channels with hadronic decays should be studied on a case by case basis . for simplicity ,",
    "we only discuss the cleanest channels with pure leptonic decays of the gauge bosons .",
    "taking the relevant branching fractions to be @xcite @xmath96 where @xmath97 and @xmath98 , we have @xmath99 and @xmath100 for the direct photons , we assume that they can be identified effectively as isolated showers in the electromagnetic calorimeter .    with these branching fractions , one can easily estimate the cross section rate for a given leptonic mode based on the total cross sections presented in figs .  [",
    "fig : vgg][fig : ttv ] .",
    "we summarize the cross section rates in units of fb for all channels in two tables for @xmath50=2 tev .",
    "table  [ t : one ] presents the processes with direct photons and table  [ t : two ] only those with massive @xmath11 s .",
    "entries in the first row list the total cross sections read off directly from the figures ; those in the second row give the cross section rates with the relevant leptonic branching fractions .",
    "the letter @xmath101 there denotes the missing neutrinos .",
    "we see that with an integrated luminosity of 10 fb@xmath4 , one would expect a few dozen of pure leptonic events for @xmath102 and @xmath3 , making the studies for anomalous quartic couplings at the upgraded tevatron possible .",
    "the other channels are of very small event rate , even though a higgs boson with @xmath103 could enhance the @xmath68 production rates by a factor 4  6 .",
    "the trilepton channels of @xmath104 and @xmath105 are of special interest since they are the backgrounds to the benchmark susy processes for gaugino signals . the total rate of about 0.1 fb shown in table  [ t : two ] would not seem to pose a severe problem for the trilepton susy signals @xcite .",
    "we have thus far simply imposed a minimal @xmath46-cutoff ( @xmath106 ) on the final state photons .",
    "it is informative to examine the photon pseudorapidity distribution . figure  [ fig : eta](a ) shows the @xmath107 distribution for @xmath108 and @xmath31 processes , and fig .",
    "[ fig : eta](b ) presents the @xmath109 ( the larger one of the two @xmath107 ) distribution for @xmath31 and @xmath32 processes , with a cut @xmath110 gev .",
    "we see that if we tighten up the @xmath46-cut to be 1 , the total rates would be reduced to 22 fb ( by 49% ) , 13 fb ( 73% ) and 5.4 fb ( 75% ) for @xmath108 and @xmath31 processes , respectively ( cf . table  [ t : one ] ) .",
    "it is important to note that in fig .",
    "[ fig : eta](a ) the cross section rate for @xmath31 in the central scattering region ( small pseudorapidity ) is much lower than that for @xmath56 and @xmath111 : a direct reflection of the radiation amplitude zeros in the @xmath112 processes .",
    "when the two photons are collinear , there would be an exact radiation amplitude zero @xcite in the parton c.  m.  frame . for the dominant process",
    "@xmath113 , it is located at @xmath114 which is at @xmath115 ; while the zero would be located at @xmath116 for @xmath117 .",
    "it is these zeros that make the @xmath112 cross section small in the central region .",
    "more importantly , the zeros are due to subtle gauge cancellation in the sm and thus sensitive to any anomalous couplings beyond the sm",
    ". we will examine this aspect in more detail in another publication .",
    "similar to fig .",
    "[ fig : eta ] , figure  [ fig : pt ] presents the transverse momentum distribution of the photon(s ) for these three processes , with a cut @xmath118 .",
    "as expected , the distributions fall off sharply .    finally , we present the maximum rapidity distribution @xmath119 for the massive gauge - bosons for two generic processes , @xmath120 and @xmath121 in fig .  [",
    "fig : yw ] .",
    "we see that the gauge - bosons are produced in the central region , with rapidities typically of @xmath122 .",
    "the charged leptons from the @xmath11 decays then should be mostly within a rapidity range less than 2.5 .",
    "also , the transverse momenta for the final state charged leptons will roughly peak around @xmath123 as the jacobian peak for the two - body @xmath11-decay .",
    "therefore , we would not expect to lose much rate after imposing realistic leptonic cuts .",
    "the triple gauge - boson production processes must be quantified for future experiments at an upgraded tevatron in order to explore physics beyond the sm , such as studying quartic gauge - boson self - interactions , and searching for new particles like gauginos , gluinos and squarks in susy theories with leptonic final states .",
    "we have calculated the cross sections for the triple gauge - boson production in the standard model ( sm ) at fermilab tevatron energies . at @xmath0 tev ,",
    "the cross sections are typically of order 10 fb .",
    "we have also estimated the production rates for multi - lepton final states from the gauge - boson decays .",
    "the cross sections for @xmath2 and @xmath3 processes to pure leptonic final states at @xmath0 tev are of order a few fb , resulting in a few dozen clean leptonic events for an integrated luminosity of 10 fb@xmath4 , with the minimal cuts of eq .",
    "( [ eq : gcut ] ) on the final state photons .",
    "the pure leptonic modes from other gauge - boson channels give significantly smaller rate .",
    "especially , the trilepton modes yield a cross section of order 0.1 fb at 2 tev if there is no significant higgs boson contribution . for @xmath124 ,",
    "the @xmath68 production rates could be enhanced by a factor of @xmath8 .",

    "<S> decays and with some minimal cuts on final state photons , the cross sections for @xmath2 and @xmath3 processes are of order a few fb , resulting in a few dozen clean leptonic events for an integrated luminosity of 10 fb@xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the pure leptonic modes from other gauge - boson channels give significantly smaller rate . </S>",
    "<S> especially , the trilepton modes from @xmath5 and @xmath6 yield a cross section of order 0.1 fb if there is no significant higgs boson contribution . for a higgs boson with @xmath7 , </S>",
    "<S> the triple massive - gauge - boson production rate could be enhanced by a factor of @xmath8 . </S>"
