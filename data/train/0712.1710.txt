    "a short probe pulse follows a short pump pulse at some specific delay .",

    "however , there is a strong interest in extending these techniques to x - ray wavelengths , where one could directly probe structural changes with atomic resolution .",
    "this goal will be achieved with the realization of x - ray free electron lasers ( xfels ) @xcite . in their initial configurations",
    ", xfels will produce radiation pulses with duration of about a hundred femtosecond , which will allow time - resolved studies of transient structures of matter on the time - scale of chemical reactions .",
    "one of the main technical problems for the realization of pump - probe experiments is the relative synchronization of radiation pulses from xfel and optical laser .",
    "both x - ray and optical pulses are subject to time - jitter . in an xfel",
    ", radiation is produced by an electron bunch travelling through an undulator .",
    "the budget for time jitter of the electron bunch starts to accumulate from the photo - injector laser system .",
    "extra source of jitter is constituted by fluctuations of the electron energy , which transform to time jitter in magnetic bunch - compressors .",
    "the pump - laser itself has an intrinsic time jitter caused e.g. by mechanical vibrations in the laser oscillator or electrical - noise in the stabilization electronics .",
    "there exists a tendency for straightforward solution of the problem by means of implementation of a precise synchronization system at xfels , aiming all clocks and triggers within the facility to be perfectly synchronized @xcite .",
    "once this is done , temporal resolution of pump - probe experiment will be defined by the synchronization system plus intrinsic time - jitter of the pump - laser system .",
    "however , precise synchronization on a kilometer - scale facility is a rather challenging task , and it is not clear , at the moment , what will be the overall practical accuracy limit for the synchronization of xfel pulses to pulses from external lasers .",
    "approaches based on generation of two coherent radiation pulses of different colors by the same electron bunch passing through two distinct insertion devices have been proposed in @xcite .",
    "intrinsic feature of these schemes is an ideal mutual synchronization of the radiation pulses . with careful design of the optical transport system from source to sample",
    "it is possible to reach femtosecond level of synchronization .",
    "one of the schemes , using far infrared and vuv radiation pulses is being experimentally realized at flash , the free - electron laser in hamburg @xcite .",
    "recently , an alternative concept has been proposed for realization of pump - probe experiments with xfel pulses and powerful optical pulses from external lasers @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is to shift the attention from the problem of absolute synchronization to the problem of measurement of relative jitter between x - ray and optical pulses .",
    "if a relative delay is known for each pump - probe event , a sorting of results according to measured delay times gives the required experimental outcome . in this paper",
    "we propose a concept of time - arrival monitor allowing measurement of a relative delay between xfel and optical pulses on a femtosecond time scale .",
    "our scheme makes use of the same electron bunch to produce both an xfel pulse and a powerful laser - like ( bandwidth - limited and diffraction - limited ) optical pulse .",
    "the latter is generated downstream of the x - ray undulator , and will be naturally synchronized to the xfel pulse .",
    "relative synchronization is preserved by using the same mechanical support for optical elements transporting x - ray pulse and optical pulse down to the experimental area . there , single - shot cross - correlation between the optical pulse and the pump - laser pulse can be performed yielding , effectively , the temporal delay between xfel pulse and pump - laser pulse .",
    "implementation of the proposed scheme for pump - probe experiments into the project of the european xfel @xcite is described in detail .",
    "we show that it naturally fits into the project .",
    "a modulation at optical frequency is imprinted onto the electron bunch using the optical replica synthesizer ( ors ) setup @xcite that will be installed after the final beam compression stage at the energy of 2 gev .",
    "subsequently , electrons travel through the main undulator and radiate the xfel pulse .",
    "finally , the presence of a long straight section and a separation magnet downstream of the main undulator serve as optical radiator , where the modulated electron bunch produces a powerful pulse of coherent edge - radiation .",
    "the proposed arrival - time monitor can be realized without the addition of specific hardware in the accelerator and undulator tunnels , and requires minimal efforts .",
    "the applicability of the present scheme is not restricted to the european xfel setup .",
    "other projects , e.g. the lcls or scss facility @xcite , may benefit from our proposal too .",

    "operation of the scheme is based on production by the electron bunch of an optical pulse naturally synchronized with the xfel pulse .",
    "relative synchronization is preserved by using the same radiation transport system to the experimental area .",
    "the optical pulse is then used to monitor the delay time between pump and probe by correlating it with the pump laser.,width=529 ]    a basic scheme of the timing system is shown in fig .",
    "[ setup ] .",
    "discussions in this paper focus on design and parameters ( see fig .",
    "[ realscheme ] ) of the sase 1 line of the european xfel , operating in the wavelength range around @xmath1 nm .",
    "main elements of the timing system are energy modulator ( constituted by seed laser and undulator modulator ) , dispersion section and radiator .    the energy modulator ( see fig .",
    "[ ors ] ) is located after the second bunch compressor ( bc2 ) , where the electron energy is about @xmath2 gev .",
    "a laser pulse at wavelength @xmath3 nm is used to modulate the electron energy at the same wavelength .",
    "the duration of the laser pulse is chosen to be about @xmath4 ps , much longer than the time - jitter of the electron pulse ( a fraction of a picosecond ) to avoid synchronization problems .",
    "the energy of the laser pulse is about @xmath5 mj .",
    "laser beam is focused onto the electron beam in a short modulator undulator , with a number of periods @xmath6 , resonant at the seed laser wavelength @xmath3 nm .",
    "energy modulation with an amplitude of about @xmath5 mev is achieved due to interaction with the electron bunch in the modulator undulator .",
    "subsequently , the electron bunch passes through the dispersion section with momentum compaction @xmath7 m , where the energy modulation induces a density modulation at the seed - laser wavelength . with parameters discussed above",
    ", the density modulation reaches an amplitude of about @xmath8 . following the dispersion section the bunch",
    "is accelerated up to the energy of @xmath9 gev in the main accelerator , it passes trough the collimator system and is directed to the sase 1 x - ray undulator .",
    "a high - current ( 5 ka ) electron beam is transported through the xfel linac , and it is therefore mandatory to include self - interaction effects in our analysis . during the passage of the bunch through the accelerator , the initial density modulation produces an energy modulation due to longitudinal impedance caused by space - charge fields .",
    "if the collimation system is properly tuned , such energy modulation can induce further modulation in density .",
    "calculations presented in section [ sec : modu ] show that exploitation of self - interaction mechanisms allow one to deliver , at the entrance of the sase 1 undulator , an electron bunch with a @xmath0 density modulation , and negligible energy modulation .",
    "the sase fel process in the baseline undulator is not perturbed by such level of density modulation : fluctuations of the electron current density serve as input signal for the radiation amplification process , which develops nearly in the same way as with an unmodulated electron bunch . as a result , at the exit of the sase 1 undulator the electron bunch produces the nominal x - ray pulse .    finally , after the sase 1 undulator , the modulated electron bunch passes through a long straight section followed by a separation magnet , which separates the electron bunch from the sase pulse .",
    "due to the presence of the combination of straight section and separation magnet , the electron bunch emits an optical pulse of coherent edge radiation at the wavelength of the bunch density modulation .",
    "such an optical pulse carries about @xmath10 photons ( order of a microjoule ) and is delivered in a bandwidth - limited and diffraction - limited pulse .    summing up , combination of an optical modulator after magnetic bunch compressor bc2 and optical radiator after",
    "the baseline undulator will allow to produce a powerful laser - like optical pulse at the entrance of the photon beamline .",
    "this laser - like pulse is naturally synchronized with the electron bunch and thereby with the x - ray pulse .",
    "thus , the problem of measuring the time - shift between a pump - laser pulse and a ( x - ray ) probe pulse is reduced to the problem of measuring the time delay between two ultrashort optical pulses , which may be solved with standard techniques .",
    "contrarily to the x - ray pulse , which is peaked on - axis , the edge - radiation pulse is peaked in the forward direction at an angle of a few tens of microradians .",
    "the distance from the separation magnet to the first ( x - ray ) mirror station is about @xmath11 m. according to calculations presented in section [ sec : rad ] , the diameter of the spatial distribution of edge radiation at this distance will be about @xmath12 cm , which fits with the aperture of the photon beamline .",
    "relative synchronization of x - ray and optical pulses must be preserved during propagation to the experimental area .",
    "the best way to do so is to use the same mechanical support for both optical elements transporting the x - ray pulse and optical elements transporting the optical pulse .",
    "for example , optical elements for the transportation of edge - radiation may be directly assembled on the x - ray mirrors . after passing through the transport system",
    ", the edge - radiation pulse will reach the experimental area , where a single - shot cross - correlation measurement with the pump - laser pulse can be performed . in reference",
    "@xcite the possibility of extracting the temporal shift between pulses from two ultrashort laser pulses was experimentally demonstrated .",
    "the method was based on sum - frequency generation in a non - linear crystal .",
    "the intrinsic accuracy of this technique was shown to be within the femtosecond range .",
    "successful measurements of the time - offset signal were performed even when one of the two pulses was very weak ( down to @xmath13 photons per pulse ) .",

    "it should be remarked that the virtual source @xmath160 is responsible for a field contribution known as transition undulator radiation .",

    "as it was shown in @xcite and @xcite these expressions have no physical meaning . in our study case , as we have just seen , the contribution from transition undulator radiation can be even neglected .",

    ". moreover , an extra photon stop might be installed at the exit of the main undulator , absorbing all but the sase pulse . as a result",
    ", one has to deal with the simple situation where the optical radiator is composed by a single straight section limited by bending magnets downstream of the main undulator .",
    "since @xmath164 is known , free - space propagation from the virtual source through the near zone and up to the far - zone can be performed with the help of the fresnel propagation as it is done for usual laser beams @xcite .",
    "the only difference is in the peculiar shape of @xmath164 , which reflects the particular trajectory followed by the filament beam .",
    "it is important to realize that the first optical element of the optical beamline will be placed at about @xmath11 m from the end of the straight section .",
    "such distance is comparable with the straight section length .",
    "thus , one needs to know how edge radiation propagates in the near zone in order to characterize the pulse at the optical element position . in this regard",
