    "it has been known that short distance contribution is small in the @xmath7 decay  @xcite and a naively factorized @xmath8 amplitude for the @xmath0 decays is much smaller than the observed one@xcite .",

    "the masses of four - quark mesons with the mixing have been predicted by using the bag model .",
    "the members of the heavier class have been expected to play an important role in charm decays@xcite since their predicted masses are close to the parent charm meson masses while four - quark meson contribution to @xmath96 decays will be small since their masses are considerably larger than the kaon mass @xmath97 . however , in the @xmath98 decay , their contributions are not necessarily negligible since the other contributions are suppressed because of the above @xmath90 rule in the asymptotic ground - state - meson matrix elements of @xmath69 , etc .",

    "in fact , for example , the bms model@xcite with @xmath369 which provides the best fit to the data on the form factor by na31@xcite predicts @xmath370 which is substantially larger than our results and the data from e799@xcite .",
    "the existing theoretical analyses@xcite involving the above bms model have been restricted by the argument in ref.@xcite which is based on the field algebra and therefore , in these theories , the @xmath6 pole amplitude has to vanish in the @xmath7 while it survives in the dalitz decays of @xmath1 . in this case , however , it will be hard@xcite to reproduce the observed @xmath324 in consistency with the @xmath16 decays if the usual @xmath10-@xmath11 mixing angle @xmath371 is taken .",
    "additionally , they involve implicitly serious problems mentioned before .",
    "as seen in table  iii , our three results on @xmath372 for the above three different values of @xmath198 are not very different from each other since the corresponding form factors are not very different in the three cases and are a little larger than the data from refs.@xcite but still consistent with the data from ref.@xcite .",
    "it is because our values of the form factor prefer to the data from the @xmath346 decay@xcite but are considerably larger , around the @xmath373 threshold , than the data by e799@xcite from the @xmath347 decay .",
    "we have investigated @xmath0 , @xmath18 , @xmath7 and the dalitz decays of @xmath1 systematically .",
    "our result has included many parameters .",
    "although their values have been estimated by using existing experimental data , three ( @xmath198 , @xmath122 and @xmath374 ) of them have still remained unknown .",
    "therefore , in the three cases , ( i ) @xmath316 in which @xmath375 is almost saturated by the short distance factorized contribution , ( ii ) @xmath317 and ( iii ) @xmath318 in which about half of the observed value of @xmath375 is occupied by the long distance non - factorizable contribution , we have searched for possible values of @xmath122 and @xmath374 which reproduce the existing _ data _ on @xmath375 and @xmath376 simultaneously . then , using the results , we have calculated the form factor for the dalitz decays of @xmath1 and their decay rates .",
    "the three results on the form factor have been not very different from each other . on the other hand , the existing data on the form factor from the @xmath377 decay@xcite and the @xmath367 decay@xcite are not consistent with each other near the @xmath373 threshold .",
    "our results on the form factor around the threshold of the @xmath367 decay seem to be consistent with the data from the @xmath343 final state but a little larger than the data from the @xmath344 final state .",
    "the rate for the dalitz decay is controlled dominantly by the value of its form factor near the threshold so that @xmath378 will be useful to distinguish different models in contrast with @xmath364 .",
    "however , more theoretical and experimental investigations of the dalitz decays of @xmath1 will be needed , since their ambiguities are still large .",
