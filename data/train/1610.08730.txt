    "how feasible is it to find a model for the coulomb interaction that is easier to evaluate but still reproduces key properties of the physical interaction ?",
    "a logical starting point is a system with _ no interaction _ , as in kohn - sham density functional theory ( dft)@xcite .",
    "the kohn - sham ( ks ) approximation starts from a non - interacting system , described as the sum of the individual electrons contributions to the energy : @xmath0    in order to ameliorate the effect of omitting the coulomb repulsion between the electrons , an extra term , the exchange - correlation functional @xmath1 $ ] , is introduced into the energy expression . for a given external potential @xmath2    @xmath3 = t_s[\\rho ] + j[\\rho ] + e_{xc}[\\rho ] + \\int v(r ) \\rho(r ) dr\\ ] ]    where @xmath4 $ ] is the kinetic energy functional of the non - interacting system , @xmath5 $ ] is the classical repulsion , and @xmath1 $ ] is the exchange - correlation functional , which must be approximated @xcite .",
    "the euler - lagrange equation associated with the stationary condition of @xmath6 $ ] can be transformed into a self - consistent set of equations :    @xmath7    @xmath8 @xmath9}{\\delta \\rho(r)}.\\ ] ]    in principle , the ks solutions are exact when @xmath10 is exact , and the ks orbitals yield the exact density of the system with @xmath11 electrons in the external potential @xmath2 .",
    "the accuracy of ks density functional approximations ( dfa ) depends on the approximation one uses for @xmath10.the simplest approximation is the local density approximation ( lda)@xcite . in lda it is assumed that the exchange - correlation functional is local , @xmath12 = \\int \\epsilon_{xc}(\\rho(r ) ) dr,\\ ] ] where the exchange - correlation energy density @xmath13 at @xmath14 is taken from the uniform electron gas with density @xmath15 .",
    "+ to accurately recover the effect of omitting the interaction between the electrons , one constructs an adiabatic connection that links the ks _ non - interacting _ system with the physical _ interacting _ system . traditionally , this adiabatic connection is written as a function of the strength of the interaction , using a simple multiplicative factor @xmath16 @xcite : @xmath17 computational studies of the adiabatic connection have been performed for few - electron atomic systems , and provide significant insight into the structure of the exact exchange - correlation density functional @xcite .",
    "an alternative to the traditional adiabatic connection is to write the coulomb interaction as the sum of a short - range piece and a long - range piece . the long - range piece of the potential is usually chosen to be smooth ( or at least nonsingular ) , so that it is relatively easy to approximate solutions to the schrdinger equations when only the long - range piece is included .",
    "so far we have reviewed traditional strategies that add density - functional corrections to an `` easy '' system to approximate the real system .",
    "can we use the real system to construct the model ?",
    "for example , is it possible to select an interaction potential , different from the coulomb one , that nonetheless reproduces a certain target property of the system ?",
    "for example , one might wish to select an interaction potential that preserves the energy spectrum of an atom .",
    "this strategy is not new .",
    "valance and bergeron @xcite show how to construct analytically solvable pseudopotentials and model potentials , in the framework of supersymmetric quantum mechanics , that reproduce experimental spectra . starting from a one - electron one - dimensional hamiltonian @xmath18 associated with the potential @xmath19 , they found a supersymmetric partner @xmath20 , characterized by a second potential @xmath21 , with almost the same spectrum as @xmath18 .",
    "@xmath20 is missing the ground - state of @xmath18 .",
    "a similar approach has been used by lepage@xcite in the field of elementary particle physics , where the hamiltonian is constructed to reproduce low - energy features of a particular physical system .    in the next section",
    "we define an expression for the model potential .",
    "we then explain two different model potentials that accurately reproduce the lowest - energy eigenvalues of the hydrogen atom . in section 4",
    ", we use the same models for the coulomb potential to replace the coulomb repulsion between the electrons in two - electron harmonium .",
    "finally , the exchange energy of the uniform electron gas that results from one of the models is compared to the standard approximation .",
    "analogous to the inverse problem of finding the kohn - sham potential from a given density , where oscillatory potentials and/or shifted potentials can reproduce the exact density numerically @xcite , finding the potential given the spectrum is not trivial because the solution is not unique .",
    "therefore , we restrict the analytical form of the potential by imposing some constraints .",
    "we would like to eliminate the singularity of the coulomb potential because solving the schrdinger equation for a singular operator is computationally demanding .",
    "we also wish to preserve the long - range asymptotic form of the potential , so that the long - range electrostatics is correct .",
    "an interaction potential that satisfies these constraints is : @xmath22 we prove in this article that despite the simplicity of this _ erfgau _ @xcite type of potential , it is flexible enough for our purposes .",
    "to determine the parameters in the model potential we consider what happens when we replace the coulomb interaction between the nucleus and the electron in the hydrogen atom by the model potential @xmath23 ( [ eq_pot ] ) .",
    "thus , we replace the hamiltonian of the hydrogen atom @xmath24 by a modified hamiltonian @xmath25 with @xmath23 defined in such a way that @xmath26 as we know , in the case of the long - range term @xmath27 thus , condition ( [ lim ] ) is fulfilled if @xmath28\\to 0 $ ] when @xmath29 .",
    "besides , we would like the spectrum of @xmath30 to be as close as possible to the spectrum of @xmath31 . this can be achieved by properly choosing @xmath32 and @xmath33 .    consider @xmath31 as the unperturbed operator , and @xmath34 as a perturbation .",
    "first , we notice that for the bound states of the hydrogen atom @xmath35 and @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the angular momentum quantum number , a necessary condition for the spectra of @xmath30 and @xmath31 to coincide is that these two expectation values have the same asymptotic form .",
    "( see appendix a for more details about the @xmath38-dependence of the wavefunction . )",
    "the simplest choice , adopted in this paper , is to take @xmath39 as a linear function of @xmath38 .",
    "this implies that @xmath40 also has to be linear in @xmath38 .",
    "thus , we can set @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are @xmath38-independent parameters .    according to eqs .",
    "( [ asymp1 ] ) , ( [ asymp2 ] ) and ( [ param ] ) , the asymptotic expansion of the expectation value of @xmath44 may be written as @xmath45 we select @xmath42 and @xmath43 so that the two leading terms in expansion ( [ pt1st ] ) vanish .",
    "the lowest order terms ( @xmath46 and @xmath47 ) correspond to @xmath48 states . for angular momenta @xmath49 the leading terms in eq .",
    "( [ pt1st ] ) are @xmath50 or smaller .",
    "then , the choice of @xmath51 and @xmath52 is dictated by the requirement that the eigenvalues of the @xmath53 states are as correct as possible for @xmath29 .",
    "the explicit form of expansion ( [ pt1st ] ) for @xmath48 states reads ( see appendix b ) @xmath54 solving equations @xmath55 for @xmath42 and @xmath43 , we obtain : @xmath56 in addition to the asymptotic behavior , for practical calculations we need the optimal parameters @xmath40 and @xmath39 at finite values of @xmath38 . taking the linear forms @xmath57 with the parameter @xmath42 and @xmath43 from the previous step we can use @xmath58 and @xmath59 to further optimize the spectrum .",
    "the condition for the elimination of @xmath60 term remains the same as before .",
    "the equations @xmath61 and @xmath62 are given in appendix b. the behavior of the spectrum of the model potential versus @xmath58 and @xmath59 is shown in figure  [ fig_ca ] , where for fixed @xmath63 energies of 1s , 2s and 2p states are displayed .",
    "as one can see , there is a range for which pairs of @xmath64 give reasonably small errors of the energy values .",
    "the dependence of the relative error on @xmath65 and @xmath37 is discussed in section  [ sec_eigenvalues ] .     and @xmath59 .",

    "we defined the best choice for the parameters as the minimax choice : the @xmath70 that minimized the maximum absolute deviation between the eigenvalues with the model potential and the exact result from the coulomb interaction , @xmath71     and @xmath52 of the simple fit in eq .",

    "the interaction does not vanish when @xmath79 , therefore the spectrum can not be exact for small values of @xmath38 , in contrast to the asymptotic form ( [ eq_as ] ) , in which both @xmath40 and @xmath39 are proportional to @xmath38 .",
    "the optimum parameters for a hydrogen - like atom with the nuclear charge @xmath80 may be obtained from the ones determined for the case of @xmath81 by a simple scaling procedure .",

    "one might suspect that adding an optimized gaussian term to @xmath86 would give a potential that mimics the effect of increasing @xmath38 in the long - range term .",
    "this is not the case for the potentials we consider in this paper . at first glance",
    "the potential @xmath89 ( dashed line ) seems similar to the asymptotic and to the fitted potentials .",
    "but the @xmath88 potential is _ always _ weaker than the coulomb potential , while the latter potentials , though in some intervals of @xmath14 they are also weaker , in other intervals they are stronger than the coulomb potential .",
    "this may explain why the asymptotic and fitted potentials reproduce the spectrum much better than the modified long - range potential : the effects of too strong and too weak regions of the model potentials cancel each other , leaving the eigenvalues relatively unchanged .",
    "the percentage errors in the eigenvalues of hydrogen with long - range , asymptotic , and fitted potentials are presented in figure  [ fig_h - percent ] . as the quantum number increases , the amplitude of the eigenfunctions near the nucleus decreases , the long - range part of the potential dominates , and the eigenvalues approach the exact ones .",
