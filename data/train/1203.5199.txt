    "up to now most of the hadrons observed experimetally can be interpreted as the @xmath2/@xmath3 states in the quark model  @xcite .",
    "however there has accumulated some evidence of the exotic state with @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "such a quantum number is not accessible for a conventional meson composed of a pair of quark and anti - quark in the non - relativistic quark model .",
    "sometimes these states are named as exotic states although all the @xmath5 quantum numbers are allowed in qcd .    for a neutral quark model @xmath6 state ,",
    "@xmath7 ensures @xmath8 hence @xmath9 .",
    "therefore , there exist two possible exotic states with @xmath10 and @xmath1 .",
    "it s also interesting to note that the @xmath5 quantum number of the local operators composed of a pair of the gluon field strength tensor is either @xmath11 or @xmath12 .    on the other hand",
    ", the tetraquark operators may carry the @xmath13 and @xmath1 quantum numbers .",
    "in fact , the @xmath13 state was investigated systematically using the tetraquark currents with the qcd sum rule method  @xcite . as a byproduct",
    ", it was noted that there does not exist any tetraquark interpolating current without derivative for the @xmath14 case .    with the similar formalism , one may construct the possible @xmath1 tetraquark current by introducing derivatives .",
    "there are two kinds of constructions either with the @xmath15 basis or with the @xmath16 basis : @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "however , they can be related to each other by the fierz transformation  @xcite . in this work",
    "we use the first set . with these independent @xmath1 currents ,",
    "we perform the qcd sum rule analysis and extract the masses of the corresponding currents .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : current ] , we construct the tetraquark currents with @xmath0 using the diquark ( @xmath15 ) and antidiquark ( @xmath19 ) fields . in sec .",
    "[ sec : ope ] , we calculate the correlation functions and spectral densities of the interpolating currents and collect them in the appendix  [ sec : rhos ] .",
    "we perform the numerical analysis and extract the masses in sec .",
    "[ sec : num ] for the light and heavy systems respectively .",
    "the last section is a brief summary .",
    "it was shown that the @xmath14 tetraquark interpolating currents without derivatives do not exist @xcite .",
    "so in this work we construct the @xmath1 currents with the derivatives following the similar steps as in ref .",
    "we first construct two independent tetraquark fields : @xmath20 where @xmath21 represents the flavor of quarks , and @xmath22 stands for the color indices , @xmath23 , @xmath24 .",
    "it is understood that the index @xmath25 is the color index of @xmath26 . in eqs.([no1 ] ) and ( [ equ : current ] ) we have used the shorthand notation to simply the expression .    to compose the color singlet tetraquark currents , the diquark and antidiquark should have the same color and spin symmetries .",
    "therefore the color structure of the tetraquark is either @xmath27 or @xmath28 , which is denoted by labels @xmath29 and @xmath30 respectively .",
    "details can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite . considering both the color and lorentz structures",
    ", we can obtain the currents with @xmath14 : @xmath31",
    "consider the two - point correlation function in the framework of qcd sum rule @xmath32 where @xmath33 is an interpolating current . at the hadron level",
    ", the correlation function @xmath34 is expressed via the dispersion relation : @xmath35 where @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the mass of the resonance @xmath38 and @xmath39 is the decay constant of the meson : @xmath40    the correlation function can also be calculated at the quark - gluon level using the qcd operator product expansion ( ope ) method .",
    "it is convenient to evaluate the wilson coefficient in the coordinate space for the light quark systems and in the momentum space for the heavy quark systems respectively . in our calculation",
    "we consider the first order perturbative and various condensates contributions . in order to calculate the gluonic condensate",
    ", it is convenient to work in the fixed - point gauge .",
    "the massive quark propagator @xmath41 in an external field in the fixed - point gauge is listed in appendix a. the quark lines attached with gluon contain terms proportional to @xmath42 , which we can ignore in the current without derivatives .",
    "we keep these terms throughout the evaluation and let @xmath42 go to zero only after finishing the derivatives .",
    "the @xmath43 can be written as : @xmath44 where the @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the mass of the quark @xmath47 and @xmath48 respectively . in order to suppress the higher state contributions , we perform the borel transformation to the correlation function , which improves the convergence of the ope series . with the quark - hadron duality ,",
    "we obtain : @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the threshold parameter and @xmath51 is the borel parameter .",
    "we can extract the meson mass @xmath37 : @xmath52    for all the tetraquark currents in  eq.([equ : current ] ) , we collect the spectral density @xmath53 in the appendix .",
    "the quark condensate @xmath54 vanishes due to the special lorenz structures of the currents . for the @xmath55 , we do the calculation in the chiral limit @xmath56 .",
    "since the contribution of the three gluon condensate @xmath57 is very small , we consider only the power corrections from the following condensates @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "we list several typical feynman diagrams in the fig .",
    "[ feyn1 ] .     +   +",
    "in the qcd sum rule analysis , we use the following values of the quark masses , coupling constant and various condensates  @xcite : @xmath62    the borel mass @xmath51 and the threshold value @xmath50 are two pivotal parameters .",
    "the working region of the borel mass is determined by the convergence of the ope and the pole contribution .",
    "the requirement of the convergence of the ope determines the lower bound @xmath63 of the borel mass , and the pole contribution determines the upper bound @xmath64 .    in this work ,",
    "there is no contribution from the quark condensate @xmath65 .",
    "the correction from the condensate @xmath66 is the most important numerically .",
    "its contribution is bigger than that from the gluon condensate @xmath67 , mixed condensate @xmath68 and the four quark condensate @xmath69 .",
    "the mixed condensate is also very important numerically for the currents @xmath70 .",
    "we require that the condensate @xmath71 be less than one ninth of the perturbative term to ensure the convergence of ope , which leads to the lower bound of the borel parameter working window .",
    "the pole contribution ( pc ) is defined as @xmath72 which depends on both the borel mass @xmath51 and the threshold value @xmath50 .",
    "@xmath50 is chosen around the region where the variation of @xmath37 with @xmath51 is minimum . requiring the pc",
