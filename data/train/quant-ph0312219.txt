    "the phenomenon of parametric resonance is related to the instability of open systems under the action of an external periodic force . in quantum field theory",
    ", we expect the resonant amplification of quantum fluctuations @xcite .",
    "the resonance enhancement of vacuum fluctuations is usually referred as the dynamical casimir effect .",
    "the standard model to investigate this effect is the system of electromagnetic fields confined inside a vibrating one - dimensional cavity @xcite .",
    "meplan and gignoux @xcite found the correspondence between the wave propagation in a vibrating cavity and the motion of massless particles in a two - dimensional space - time billiard .",
    "they used the generalized korringa - kohn - rostoker method .",
    "the method presented in this paper offers both a better insight in resonance mechanism and a more useful tool for detailed calculations .",
    "moreover , the brief discussion of the quantum version in @xcite does not trace properly the impact of conformal anomaly @xcite .    in this letter",
    ", we present a new approach to study resonance solutions .",
    "we show that the resonance amplification together with the formation of narrow packets in energy densities @xcite is a purely classical phenomenon .",
    "it can be explained as a consequence of a cumulative dppler effect @xcite . in this way",
    ", we are allowed to interpret a wave packet as a beam of massless and non - interacting particles .",
    "hence , we introduce the billiard function which contains full information about possible reflections from a cavity wall .",
    "this function is helpful to establish recursive formulas for physical quantities in a vibrating cavity .",
    "production of particles in quantum case is represented by conformal anomaly contribution in such formulas for energy densities .",
    "our technique is illustrated with solutions of several examples of vibrating cavity systems discussed in literature .",
    "before studying the field - theoretic models , we consider briefly the classical billiards .",
    "let us start with the simplest example , namely a head - on collision of two non - relativistic objects",
    ". a particle moves with velocities @xmath0 and @xmath1 before and after the collision , while respective velocities of a target are denoted by @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "this elementary physical problem is fully described by the reflection law in one dimension ( on a line ) , @xmath4 if we assume a target to be very heavy and skip its recoil , then the velocity of a particle after the collision is just @xmath5 .",
    "we see that if a particle were bounced with a regular frequency , then its energy would grow quadratically with time .",
    "let us look now at a head - on collision of relativistic objects .",
    "this two - body problem is described by the relativistic reflection law which says that the sums of rapidities are equal , @xmath6 in this case , if a particle bounces rhythmically on a heavy target , then its rapidity grows linearly with time .",
    "it follows that the energy grows exponentially with time . in particular",
    ", we can consider a left - moving massless particle ( photon ) hitting a target with a velocity of light .",
    "the exact formula for the change of the particle energy after a single collision yields : @xmath7 two consecutive factors on the right - hand side are obviously the dppler factor and the compton factor . for a large target mass @xmath8 ,",
    "the compton factor is neglected .",
    "therefore , during each head - on collision the energy of a massless particle increases ( or decreases if the target moves in the same direction ) by the dppler factor .    .",
    "it returns full information about possible reflections of a light - like particle from the mirror moving with a prescribed trajectory @xmath9 .",
    "the billiard function identifies the trajectory uniquely and its derivative is the retarded dppler factor . ]",
    "now , we insert a heavy target ( mirror ) which moves with some prescribed trajectory @xmath9 .",
    "let us then introduce the following _ billiard function_@xcite : @xmath10    we define the retarded time @xmath11 using the retardation relation @xmath12 and recognize that the derivative of the billiard function is just the retarded dppler factor : @xmath13 since the derivative is additive , the billiard function is increasing and its inverse is well defined . the dppler factor is greater than one ( amplifying ) if the mirror is moving left , i.e. towards an arriving test massless particle . for any physical trajectory of the mirror ,",
    "its corresponding billiard function is defined unambiguously . on the other hand ,",
    "any proper billiard function may be used to reconstruct its genuine mirror s trajectory .",
    "more information can be found in @xcite .",
    "although rather cumbersome in general , the billiard function is the most useful characteristic to analyze the parametric resonance within a particular cavity model .",
    "we can make use of the correspondence between waves and massless particles and relate the field theory problem with the analysis of trajectories in a space - time billiard @xcite .",
    "under the guidance of the above simple examples from classical billiards , we consider the case of field theory . as usual",
    ", we will discuss the ideal resonator model @xcite formed by two perfect mirrors .",
    "the electromagnetic potential @xmath14 obeys the one - dimensional wave equation and any classical solution is composed of left- and right - moving wave packets , @xmath15 for the sake of simplicity , we assume the left mirror to be fixed at @xmath16 , whereas the right mirror is vibrating according to a prescribed trajectory @xmath9 .",
    "then , the field @xmath14 is subject to dirichlet s boundary conditions , namely : @xmath17 we follow the solution of the cauchy problem with the help of the billiard function . from initial data for @xmath18 and @xmath19 at @xmath20",
    ", we read the function @xmath21 for arguments in the interval @xmath22 $ ] ( up to some irrelevant constant ) .",
    "the solution is obtained if we extend @xmath21 into the whole real domain .",
    "we can do it using eq .",
    "( [ dbc ] ) provided that the billiard function is known .",
    "usually , if we predetermine some trajectory of the mirror , then the corresponding billiard function is to be found only in the way of numerical iterations based on eq .",
    "( [ bf ] ) . on the other hand , to specify the mirror motion we can predetermine the billiard function instead .",
    "the energy density of the classical wave packet is given by : @xmath23 where @xmath24 .",
    "the formula for the total energy can be presented in the following form : @xmath25    the billiard function determines all possible trajectories of a massless particle or all classical optical paths inside the cavity .",
    "each trajectory can be represented by the sequence @xmath26 , where @xmath27 denotes here @xmath28-fold composition @xmath29 .",
    "a light - like particle starts at time @xmath30 moving right from @xmath16 and next elements of the sequence read next times of collisions with the static mirror .",
    "we define also retarded times @xmath31 by demanding @xmath32 .",
    "it is easy to find the relation @xmath33 .",
    "the appearance of the parametric resonance is related to the existence of periodic particle trajectories @xcite .",
    "such trajectories obey the following periodicity condition ( for any non - negative integer @xmath28 ) : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is a starting point in time and @xmath36 is a period .",
    "the retarded times are respectively @xmath37 . looking at fig.1 , we notice immediately that any periodic particle trajectory appears on condition that the trajectory of the mirror has _ return points _",
    "@xcite : @xmath38 it is usually assumed that the position of the mirror @xmath39 refers to the length of the static ( unperturbed ) cavity , so that @xmath40 in this paper .",
    "let us define the characteristic for particle trajectories which will play the most important role in our analysis .",
    "it is the cumulative dppler factor : @xmath41 we will call a trajectory to be _ positive _ ( stable , attractive ) if its cumulative dppler factor tends to infinity for large @xmath28 , and to be _ negative _ ( unstable , chaotic ) if its cumulative dppler factor goes to zero with increasing @xmath28 .",
    "the existence of periodic particle trajectories inside the cavity is equivalent to the existence of suitable return points in the trajectory of the cavity wall . in particular ,",
    "a periodic particle trajectory is positive ( negative ) if any return point of the mirror trajectory gives a dppler factor greater ( less ) than one .",
    "it happens if the right mirror is always moving toward ( outward ) the left mirror at all return points .",
    "denote by @xmath42 and @xmath43 starting points for positive and negative periodic trajectories respectively . for small perturbations @xmath44 ,",
    "it is straightforward to derive the following formulas : @xmath45 @xmath46    now , we can show how the existence of periodic particle trajectories inside the cavity triggers the resonance instability of the system .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , we assume that there are only two periodic particle trajectories , a positive one and a negative one , with starting points @xmath42 and @xmath43 lying in the initial interval @xmath22 $ ] .",
    "these simplifications are only for clarity , and the method can be adapted for more sophisticated examples . as it was said , to solve the cauchy problem we need to extend the function @xmath21 given in eq .",
    "( [ dbc ] ) from the initial interval to the whole real domain .",
    "if we are interested only in the evolution forward in time , then it is enough to obtain data only for arguments to the right of the initial interval @xmath47 . to build such extension of @xmath21 ,",
    "we pick points from the initial interval , run along particle trajectories and read extended values of @xmath21 from eq .",
    "( [ dbc ] ) . to analyze our solution obtained in this way ,",
    "let us look first at the profile function of the energy density .",
    "if we take the following iteration formula : @xmath48 together with eqs .",
    "( [ pert1],[pert2 ] ) , then it is straightforward to derive the following asymptotic formulas for large arguments ( @xmath49 ) : @xmath50 @xmath51 the above formulas explain the formation of travelling narrow packets in the energy density @xmath52 @xcite .",
    "the profile function @xmath53 is concentrated around spots of the positive periodic trajectory . from eqs .",
    "( [ edas1],[edas2 ] ) one can estimate easily the width and the height of peaks .",
    "the height grows like @xmath54 , and the width diminishes like @xmath55 .",
    "the values of the energy density far off the peaks decreases according to @xmath56 .",
    "the total energy can be analyzed using the following formula : @xmath57 we can calculate the evolution of the total accumulated energy using only initial data and the cumulative dppler factor .",
    "it is apparent that an initial shape of the classical field inside the cavity is of minor importance .",
    "let us test our method with an example of sinusoidal cavity wall motion : @xmath58 obviously , we are to assume that @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "the parametric resonance frequencies are @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the order of the resonance .",
    "it is easy to find periodic particle trajectories .",
    "first , we read all return points of the mirror from eq .",
    "( [ pc ] ) : @xmath63 .",
    "they correspond to the following starting points of positive and negative particle trajectories : @xmath64 where @xmath65 .",
    "the corresponding values of the cumulative dppler factors can be calculated : @xmath66 there are @xmath62 travelling peaks in the energy density .",
    "all the peaks have the same height and the same width .",
    "the corresponding time evolution of peaks agrees with the results of quantized version @xcite .",
    "the formation of peaks is basically a classical phenomenon .",
    "the resonance instability in the field theory appears not only for finely tuned frequencies .",
    "we obtain usually some band structure .",
    "our method enable us to get insight into off resonant behavior of the cavity system as well .",
    "therefore , we assume some perturbation of the resonant frequency : @xmath67 .",
    "the equation for return points is now : @xmath68 the solutions for return points exist provided that : @xmath69 this condition has been obtained numerically for quantized version in @xcite .",
    "it defines the band structure of the parametric resonance @xcite . for small perturbations , the structure defined by eq .",
    "( [ bs ] ) is typical and resembles those obtained in classical mechanics .",
    "the cumulative dppler factor at starting points yields : @xmath70 for off resonant vibrations of the cavity , the formation of narrow peaks and the energy growth take a longer time . let us conclude our classical analysis . within the framework of our method the calculations are straightforward for any type of cavity motion .",
    "the parametric resonance is related to the existence of periodic trajectories in a two - dimensional cavity billiard . as it was already noticed in @xcite",
    ", there is no need for periodicity of cavity motion .",
    "we need only periodic returns of the cavity to the unperturbed position . for typical cavity motions ,",
    "the growth of the total energy is exponential with time .",
    "the cumulative dppler factor describes all details of the formation of narrow wave packets and the energy growth . essentially , many details of the resonant enhancement of classical electromagnetic radiation inside a vibrating cavity match the results of quantum theory .    finally , we discuss vibrating optical cavities in the quantum field theory . apart from the interference effects which we have already demonstrated in the classical theory of the cavity ,",
    "we are to account for instability of the quantum vacuum and possibility for particle production . the vacuum expectation value of the energy density is given by @xcite : @xmath71 where @xmath72(\\tau ) \\ .\\ ] ] the second term is responsible for particle production .",

    "( [ crr ] ) , aside from the dppler factor there appears a new additive term on the right hand side .",
    "it represents the conformal anomaly of the theory .",
    "most of classical results , like the band structure around resonance frequencies , the formation and the shape of travelling packets in the energy density , the exponential growth of the total accumulated energy , can be reproduced in the quantum case as well .",
    "these features are to be calculated from the cumulative dppler factor .",
    "the novelty of the quantum description is the conformal anomaly .",
    "we show that for the lowest resonance channel , the anomalous mechanism of energy growth clashes with the resonance enhancement of the initial vacuum fluctuations .",
    "let us refer again to the sinusoidal motion of the cavity ( [ sin ] ) .",
    "we consider motions with resonance frequencies @xmath78 . at the beginning",
    ", the cavity is static and empty .",
    "it corresponds to the following condition : @xmath79 \\ .\\ ] ] the above value is just the static casimir energy density which is present even the cavity is at rest .",
    "we can compute the cumulated anomaly contribution at starting points of positive trajectories directly from eq .",

    "it explains why the lowest resonance ( called sometimes @xmath83 @xcite ) is suppressed .",
    "no particles are produced inside a cavity .",
    "for higher resonance frequencies @xmath84 , the anomalous mechanism surpasses resonant enhancement of the negative energy of the initial state .",
    "we obtain again the exponential growth of the total energy and the formation of travelling narrow wave packets .",
    "the first exact analytical solution corresponding to a vibrating cavity system was presented in @xcite for the resonance channel @xmath85 and generalized in @xcite for higher resonances .",

    "in summary , we have studied the resonance behavior of the electromagnetic field inside a vibrating one - dimensional ( linear ) cavity .",
    "our approach exploits fully the analogy with the classical billiard of massless particles .",

    "the resonant exponential enhancement and the concentration of energy into narrow wave packets is described in both classical and quantum field theories of cavities referring to the same aggregated dppler factor .",
    "it is enough to calculate this factor , even numerically , in some finite interval of the length related to the period of cavity oscillations .",
    "a purely quantum phenomenon of particle production from the vacuum is described by the anomalous contribution in recursive relations . for higher resonances , this contribution dominates and the evolution of the system is insensitive to the initial state of the quantum field inside a cavity . however , for higher resonances the band structure defined by eq .",
