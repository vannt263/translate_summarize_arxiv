    "the plethora of low column density , intervening ly@xmath0 absorption lines in the spectra of high redshift qso s ( the `` ly@xmath0 forest '' ) was first recognized by lynds ( 1971 ) and has been described in detail by sargent et al .",

    "a considerable amount has been learned about the nature of these systems at redshifts @xmath14 , the redshift above which ly@xmath0 is observable from the ground .",
    "these redshifts are generally too large to directly detect the absorbing objects in emission .",
    "however , more recently , a modest number of ly@xmath0 absorbers at low redshift have been detected in the uv ( morris et al .",
    "1991 ; bahcall et al .",
    "the proximity of these systems make them ideal targets for searches for h  i and optical emission from the vicinity of these clouds .",
    "one can also seek possible identifications of parent objects with which the clouds might be associated .",
    "the first low - redshift ly@xmath0 forest absorption lines were discovered in the iue spectrum of pks  2155 - 304 by maraschi et al .",
    "since then , the hst has revealed many low column density absorbers in the nearby universe ( bahcall et al .",

    "statistical studies have been made to determine the relative correlation between these ly@xmath0 absorbing clouds and optical galaxies ( morris et al .",
    "1991 ; salzer 1992 ; stocke et al . 1995 ; lanzetta et al . 1995 ; mo & morris 1994 ; morris et al . 1993 ; morris & van den bergh 1994 ) .",
    "the current consensus is that the systems do correlate weakly with bright galaxies , but less so than these galaxies with other galaxies ( stocke et al .",
    "lanzetta et al .",
    "( 1995 ) find good evidence that some of the stronger ly@xmath0 absorbers are physically close to galaxies , but there are also examples of clouds with no optical galaxy to within a few mpc ( stocke et al .",

    "morris et al .",
    "( 1991 ) find , in one instance , an anti - correlation between a region of very high galaxy density and ly@xmath0 forest absorbing clouds .",
    "stocke et al .",
    "( 1995 ) find more generally that : `` the higher equivalent width absorbers are distributed more like galaxies than the lower equivalent width absorbers , which are distributed in a manner statistically indistinguishable from clouds randomly placed with respect to galaxies . ''    in this paper , we present a search for h  i emission from the vicinity of seven nearby ly@xmath0 absorbers .",
    "h  i imaging surveys routinely find gas - rich , optically uncataloged galaxies , and as such our search is complementary to the optical surveys mentioned above .",
    "in addition to searching for a possible parent population of the ly@xmath0 absorbers , the h  i morphology of galaxies close to the line of sight might betray hints of unusually large gaseous extents .",
    "in the first study of this kind ( van gorkom et al .",
    "1993 ) a deep search for h  i emission was made around two ly@xmath0 clouds on the 3c  273 line of sight , which are located in the outskirts of the virgo cluster .",
    "no obvious associations between these two ly@xmath0 clouds and h  i emitting galaxies were found .",
    "the seven systems studied here are located in a wide range of cosmic environments .",
    "the absorbers seen along the sight line toward mrk  501 are located in a void and a very low density region , respectively , while the other five absorbers are located in regions of moderately high galaxy density , along the sight lines toward pks  2155 - 304 and mrk  335 .",
    "the results of the h  i search near the sight line toward mrk  501 have already been presented by stocke et al .",
    "( 1995 ) . here",
    ", those observations will be presented in somewhat more detail .",
    "we describe the systems and observations in   2 and   3 .",
    "we present the results in   4 , and in   5",
    "we briefly discuss their implications .    throughout this paper",
    "we adopt heliocentric velocities , using the optical definition , @xmath15 , where c is the speed of light and the redshift is defined as @xmath16 , where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the observed and rest wavelengths , respectively .",
    "the seven absorption - line systems have been discovered by different authors and their properties can be found in the literature . in table 1",
    "we summarize the sources against which they have been found , the heliocentric velocities of the lines , and the measured equivalent widths . in this table",
    "we also give the projected distance to our h  i detection closest to the line of sight and the difference between the velocity of the absorption line and the systemic velocity of the galaxy as derived from the h  i.    two of the systems are seen in absorption against the bl lac object mrk  501 , which is located in the `` great wall '' of galaxies at heliocentric velocity 10,300 km  s@xmath2 .",

    "the 7530 km  s@xmath2 system is located in the void between us and the great wall , it has no cataloged optical galaxies within @xmath19 mpc , where @xmath20 is the hubble constant in units of 100 km  s@xmath2  mpc@xmath2 .",
    "the 4670 km  s@xmath2 system has a sparse chain of galaxies located to the southwest , the closest of which is @xmath21 ( @xmath22 kpc ) off the line of sight to mrk  501 .",
    "the detections of five , and possibly six , local ly@xmath0 forest lines have been reported for the sight line toward the bl lac object pks  2155 - 304 ( bruhweiler et al .",
    "1993 ; maraschi et al . 1988 ; allen et al .",

    "the third sight line that we investigated is toward mrk  335 , which has four ly@xmath0 absorption lines ( stocke et al .",

    "the h  i column densities for the absorbing systems are all in the range of 10@xmath26 @xmath27 ( assuming a doppler parameter @xmath28 km  s@xmath2 ) , except for the complex absorption lines around 17,000 km  s@xmath2 . for these ,",
    "a large column density , @xmath29 @xmath27 , has been derived ( maraschi et al . 1988 ) , placing it in the lower column density range of heavy element quasar absorption line systems . thus far , no firm detections of metal lines have been made in this system , implying a metallicity @xmath30 0.1 solar ( bruhweiler et al . 1993 ) .",
    "one of the sight lines , the one toward mrk  501 , was observed with the westerbork synthesis radio telescope ( wsrt ) , while the other searches were done with the very large array ( vla ) .",

    "table 2 summarizes the observations .",
    "the two ly@xmath0 absorption systems towards mrk  501 were observed with the wsrt .",
    "two 12 hour synthesis observations were made centered at 4885 km  s@xmath2 with short spacings of 36 m and 54 m , and a single 12 hour synthesis observation , centered at 7740 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "the total velocity range covered in each case was 1000 km  s@xmath2 at a resolution of 17 km  s@xmath2 .",

    "mrk  501 is a radio continuum source , with an observed flux density at 1.4 ghz of 1.3 jy .",
    "the source is unresolved at 15@xmath31 resolution , with a position of 16@xmath32 52@xmath33 11.65@xmath34 , 39@xmath35 50@xmath23 27.1@xmath31 ( b1950 ) . for the high - velocity system ,",
    "the pointing center corresponded to the position of the continuum source , while the observations at 4675 km  s@xmath2 were made pointing 5@xmath23 to the southwest of mrk  501 in order to increase sensitivity at the sparse chain of galaxies to the southwest .",
    "subtraction of the continuum emission from the line data was performed in two ways .",
    "the first involved linear fits in frequency to the calibrated complex visibilities ( cornwell et al .",
    "the second involved linear fits in frequency to the multi - channel image cube .",
    "the results from the two methods were similar , although the residual artifacts towards the edges of the field were worse for the image - plane subtraction ( as expected ) , and the analysis presented herein relies on the uv - data continuum subtraction method .",
    "images of mrk  501 were made using `` natural '' weighting of the visibilities .",
    "the fwhm of the wsrt synthesized beam was @xmath36 .",
    "the image cubes were smoothed in velocity to 34 km  s@xmath2 resolution and visually inspected for 21  cm emission signal .",
    "no h  i signal is seen anywhere in the cube above five times the rms in a given channel .",
    "the image cube was then smoothed in both velocity and spatially to 68 km  s@xmath2 channel@xmath2 and to 38@xmath31 spatial resolution .",
    "again , no emission is seen anywhere in the cubes above five times the rms at any velocity or spatial resolution .",

    "pks  2155 - 304 was observed twice with the vla .",

    "the high velocity systems were observed for a total of 10 hours .",
    "these observations were centered at 17,400 km  s@xmath2 in an effort to also include a possible ly@xmath0 system at 17,700 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "however , more recent hst data , obtained with the faint object spectrograph and g130h grating do not confirm the reality of that system ( allen et al .",
    "the total velocity range covered was 620 km  s@xmath2 with a velocity resolution of 23 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "all those data suffered from rather serious interference .",
    "the high velocity system was reobserved with the vla in the 1 km ( d ) configuration to make up for the loss of data due to interference and to cover also the ly@xmath0 system at 16,488 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "the time on source was again 10 hours .",
    "the observations were centered at 16,880 km  s@xmath2 and covered 1280 km  s@xmath2 with a resolution of 46 km  s@xmath2 . unfortunately , these observations were made during daytime and the data suffered rather badly from solar interference .",
    "pks  2155 - 304 is a radio continuum source , with a variable flux density .",
    "we measured a flux density of 0.45 jy at 1.4 ghz .",
    "all observations were centered at the radio position of the bl lac object , 21@xmath32 55@xmath33 58.30@xmath34 , @xmath37 54.4@xmath31 ( b1950 ) , standard calibration procedures were followed , giving special care to the bandpass calibration .",
    "a bandpass calibrator was observed once every 2 hours , and for each data point we used the bandpass solution closest in time .",
    "initially , we subtracted the continuum by making a linear fit in frequency to the calibrated complex visibilities , using the inner 75@xmath38 of the band .",
    "after the continuum subtraction , the data were clipped to remove solar and man - made interference .",
    "images were made of each of the observing runs separately .",
    "after inspection of the cubes to locate the channels with h  i emission , the subtraction of the continuum was redone , making a fit to the line free channels only .    for the low velocity system , images were made using natural weighting , resulting in a fwhm of the synthesized beam of @xmath39 .",
    "for the high - velocity systems the data of the various observing runs were combined in the uv plane , after hanning smoothing the data of the first run down to the resolution of the second run .",
    "images were made using natural weighting , resulting in a synthesized beam of @xmath40 .",
    "several galaxies were detected in h  i , one in the low - velocity data and three in the high - velocity data .",
    "these results are described in   4 .",
    "we observed mrk  335 with the vla in the 1 km ( d ) array for 4 hours in total .",
    "the observations were centered at 2135 km  s@xmath2 in between the velocities of the two ly@xmath0 absorbers , covering a range of 1000 km  s@xmath2 with a velocity resolution of 25 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "the observations were centered at the optical position of the seyfert galaxy , at 00@xmath32 03@xmath33 45.2@xmath41 , 19@xmath35 55@xmath23 28.6@xmath31 ( b1950 ) .",
    "the seyfert galaxy itself is not a radio continuum source .",
    "we subtracted background continuum sources by making a linear fit to the calibrated complex visibilities .",
    "images were made using natural weighting , resulting in a synthesized beam of @xmath42 .",
    "one previously uncataloged galaxy was discovered in h  i. we describe this result in the next section .",
    "for the h  i detections , we made images of the total hydrogen emission by smoothing the data spatially and in velocity , using the smoothed cube as a mask for the full resolution data .",
    "only pixels above 2 @xmath3 in the smoothed cube were used in the sum . throughout this paper",
    "we use images of the digitized poss to show overlays of neutral hydrogen emission on optical images .",
    "although the more interesting result of this work is the detection of so many galaxies , the upper limits we can place on any h  i in emission close to the ly@xmath0 absorbers are important too . in table 3 we list the mass and column density limits for each of the systems .",
    "these are 5 @xmath3 limits at the field center .",
    "farther from the center , they need to be corrected for the change in primary beam response .",
    "the primary beam pattern is roughly gaussian with a fwhm of 36@xmath43 and 30@xmath43 for the wsrt and the vla respectively .",
    "for example , the vla limits are a factor of two worse at 15@xmath43 from the field center , and 10 times worse at 25@xmath23 . at the position of the sparse group to the sw of mrk  501 ,",
    "the mass and column density limits are a factor of five worse than at the field center .",
    "although these limits put serious constraints on the presence of small , gas - rich dwarf galaxies very close to each of the lines of sight , the small dwarf detected toward mrk 335 at 12@xmath23 from the line of sight could only have been detected in the observations toward mrk  335 and in the low - velocity system toward pks  2155 - 304 .",
    "interestingly , in both these observations ( and only those ) a small galaxy was found very close to the velocity of the absorber , but at rather large projected distance from the line of sight .",
    "it should also be noted that in the sight line toward mrk  501 , the one observation in which no galaxies were detected at all the surface brightness sensitivity is ten times worse than that of the other observations .",
    "in fact , some of the most gas - rich , but low h  i surface density galaxies such as malin 1 could have escaped detection in those data",
    ".        perhaps the most exciting result of these observations is the detection of the small dwarf near the sight line toward mrk  335 .",
    "contour images of the velocity channels are shown in fig .",
    "although the emission is not resolved in individual channels , the peak of the emission clearly shifts in position with velocity .",
    "the maximum displacement of the peaks gives us a lower limit to the h  i extent , which is @xmath44 or @xmath45 kpc . a position ",

    "3 an overlay of the total h  i emission onto an optical image , which includes mrk  335 as well .",
    "although the h  i is more extended than the optical emission of this tiny dwarf galaxy , there is a huge distance ( @xmath47 kpc ) between the lowest h  i contour ( at @xmath48 @xmath27 ) and the sight line toward mrk  335 .",
    "the h  i properties derived from this observation are summarized in table 4 .",
    "the systemic velocity as derived from the h  i differs by only 20 km s@xmath2 from that of the higher column density absorber at 1970 km s@xmath2 .      at low velocities",
    ", we detect h  i emission from eso  466-g032 , located @xmath49 kpc to the east of the line of sight to pks  2155 - 304 .",
    "this is the closest optically cataloged galaxy to the line of sight .",
    "the h  i is seen over the velocity range 5080 km  s@xmath2 to 5130 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "contour images of the velocity channels at 11.7 km  s@xmath2 resolution are shown in fig .",
    "crosses mark the optical position of the h  i emitting galaxy .",
    "the systemic velocity as derived from the h  i profile is 5100 km  s@xmath2 , significantly less than the reported optical value of 5187 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "optically , the galaxy looks rather disturbed , with a spiral arm ( or tidal feature ? ) extending to the southwest .",
    "the h  i emission is just barely above the noise .",
    "although it appears to be slightly extended in the direction of the extended optical feature , the synthesized beam is extended in the same direction .",
    "there is a hint of rotation along the optical major axis of the galaxy , with the receding side to the northeast ( fig .",
    "the angular resolution of the current data is not sufficient to say any more about the h  i morphology ; the signal is only barely resolved .",
    "the h  i parameters are summarized in table 4 .",
    "again , to put things in perspective we show in fig . 5 an h  i overlay on an optical image including both the galaxy and the bl lac object .",
    "the high - velocity data cube covers the velocity range from 16,240 km s@xmath2 to 17,720 km s@xmath2 , but the quality varies across the band . at velocities in excess of 17,500 km s@xmath2 , the data quality is poor .",
    "we detect h  i emission from three galaxies .",
    "the galaxy closest to the line of sight , 2155 - 3033 , is at a projected distance of @xmath24 kpc to the south .",
    "the h  i emission from this galaxy is barely above the noise .",
    "a weak signal is seen over velocities from 16,900 km  s@xmath2 to 17,300 km  s@xmath2 , with no detectable h  i in the two middle channels ( fig .",
    "the systemic velocity derived from the h  i is 17,100 km  s@xmath2 , the optical redshift gives a velocity of 17,300 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "a much stronger h  i emitter is found to the southeast at a projected distance of @xmath50 kpc .",
    "this is an iras source , f21569 - 330 , with a hitherto unknown redshift .",
    "the h  i emission can be seen over a velocity range from 16,650 km  s@xmath2 to 16,925 km@xmath2 ( fig . 7 ) .",
    "the kinematic major axis lies along the optical major axis at a pa of @xmath51 , with the north side receding . a position velocity profile along the major axis is shown in fig .",
    "8 .    almost due north of pks  2155 - 304 we detect an optically uncataloged galaxy at a projected distance of @xmath52 kpc from the line of sight .",

    "11 an overlay of the h  i emission of the three galaxies detected in the high velocity cube on an optical image , which shows , in addition to the galaxies , pks  2155 - 304 .",
    "our search for h  i emission from the vicinity of nearby ly@xmath0 absorbers has resulted in the detection of five galaxies , two of which were previously uncataloged .",
    "we shall first discuss whether this detection rate is unusual in any sense : does the presence of a ly@xmath0 absorber increase the chance of finding h  i in emission ? following that , we shall discuss what we have learned from the detections , and whether there is any indication that the h  i in emission is related to the ly@xmath0 absorption .",
    "finally we will discuss whether the present observations have illuminated the nature of the nearby ly@xmath0 absorbers .",
    "a variety of data is available to assess whether our detection rate of h  i - rich systems is unusual in any way .",
    "briggs ( 1990 ) summarized the results of all major unbiased h  i surveys , while the currently most accurate h  i luminosity function has been constructed by rao & briggs ( 1993 ) . more specific and directly comparable to our result",
    "is the work by weinberg et al .",
    "( 1991 ) and szomoru et al .",
    "( 1994 , 1996 ) , who used the vla to do unbiased h  i surveys in environments of differing galaxian density .",
    "szomoru et al .",
    "( 1994 ) probed voids as well as supercluster environments and compared fields centered on optically known galaxies and optically blank fields .    for simplicity sake , we take as the volume searched in our survey the region within a radius of 22@xmath23 from the pointing center .",
    "this is the 20@xmath38 point of the primary beam ; beyond that , the shape of the beam is highly uncertain .",
    "our search within that volume is complete to the 5 @xmath3 limits listed in table 3 , multiplied by five ( correcting for the primary beam response ) .",
    "the volume searched down to a mass limit of @xmath53 of h  i is @xmath54 mpc@xmath55 . in this volume , we detected three galaxies with h  i masses of a few times 10@xmath56 m@xmath57 of h  i , giving a density of 0.05 @xmath58 0.02 mpc@xmath59 .",
    "the volume searched down to @xmath60 of h  i is much smaller , @xmath61 mpc@xmath55 .",
    "two galaxies of even smaller masses were detected in that volume , bringing the galaxy density in the mass range of 10@xmath62 m@xmath57 to @xmath63 to @xmath64 mpc@xmath59 .",
    "these h  i mass densities are quite consistent with the results of briggs ( 1990 ) , who found a density of @xmath65 mpc@xmath59 and @xmath66 mpc@xmath59 for h  i masses of a few times 10@xmath56 m@xmath57 and 10@xmath67 m@xmath57 respectively .",
    "only a small fraction of the volume searched , @xmath68 mpc@xmath55 , is in a true void ; the remaining volume is more characteristic of supercluster densities .",
    "weinberg et al . ( 1991 ) found a cumulative space density of @xmath69 mpc@xmath59 for gas rich dwarfs above 10@xmath67 m@xmath57 of h  i in the perseus ",
    "pisces supercluster , a result similar to ours . in conclusion , although the statistics are small , it appears that the presence of nearby ly@xmath0 forest absorbers has not significantly altered the detection rate of h  i emitting objects in either the void or the high - density regions .",
    "nevertheless , the detections of two galaxies almost exactly at the velocity of their nearby ly@xmath0 absorbers , and the fact that these are the only detections in a 500 and 1000 km s@xmath2 range for pks  2155 - 304 and mrk  335 respectively , beg the question whether there is a possible association between the galaxies and the absorbers .",
    "the most tantalizing system is the uncataloged dwarf galaxy at a projected distance of @xmath47 kpc from the line of sight toward mrk  335 .",
    "the absolute magnitude of this dwarf has been estimated to be @xmath70 based upon a linear extrapolation of the calibration supplied by eight , nearby hst guide stars on the digitized version of the poss - e plate material .",
    "this approximate magnitude assumes that h@xmath71 = 100 km s@xmath2 mpc@xmath2 despite the location of this object within the bounds of the local supercluster .",
    "the proximity , spatially and in velocity , of the ly@xmath0 absorber and dwarf irregular could mean no more than that they originated in a common larger scale structure , e.g. , a filament ( cen et al . 1994 ; hernquist et al .",
    "1996 ; miralda - escud et al .",
    "1996 ; mcket et al .",
    "alternatively , it could imply that the ly@xmath0 cloud is gravitationally bound to the dwarf .",
    "perhaps , it is still falling in or has been ejected in a galactic wind .",
    "the kinematic structure does not help to choose between these various possibilities .",
    "the minimum dynamical mass in the ly@xmath0 cloud + dwarf galaxy system needed to make it a bound system can be derived by requiring that the total kinetic energy of the system is less or equal to the potential energy .",
    "thus ,    @xmath72 where g is the gravitational constant , @xmath73 the line - of - sight velocity difference and @xmath74 the projected distance between absorber and galaxy .",

    "thus , in order for the ly@xmath0 cloud to be bound to the galaxy , the dwarf needs to be embedded in a massive dark halo .",
    "an intriguing possibility is that the ly@xmath0 absorption arises from within a mostly ionized gas disk of the dwarf galaxy .",
    "maloney ( 1992 ) and stocke et al . ( 1995 ) discussed the possibility that nearby ly@xmath0 lines could be produced by gas at large radii in the disks of spiral and irregular galaxies .",
    "maloney concludes that the unexpectedly large number of low - redshift ly@xmath0 absorption lines seen with hst toward 3c  273 can be produced by extended ionized gas disks in the halos of spiral and irregular galaxies .",
    "the observed frequency of absorbers requires that either l@xmath77 galaxies have huge ( several hundred kpc ) halos or , more plausibly , that the decrease of absorption cross section with declining luminosity is slow enough for low - luminosity galaxies to dominate the integrated cross section .",
    "shull et al .",
    "( 1996 ) make the case that , for absorbers of mean radius @xmath78 , only dwarf galaxies have the comoving space densities , @xmath79 necessary to explain the frequency of low - redshift ly@xmath0 clouds . for reference ,",
    "this density is over 20 times that of @xmath80 galaxies , recently estimated as @xmath81 mpc@xmath59 ( marzke et al . 1994 ) .    a first hint that low - luminosity galaxies may indeed dominate the cross section comes from the discovery ( barcons et al . 1995 ) of possibly corotating ly@xmath0 absorption at large ( 50 kpc ) projected distance from two small , late - type spiral galaxies .",
    "contrary to the cases found by barcons et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , we have no evidence for corotation of the ionized gas with the galaxy , the ly@xmath0 absorption occurs too close to the minor axis of the galaxy .",
    "the small velocity difference between the absorber and the systemic velocity of the galaxy is of course not inconsistent with corotation , but at that large distance anything that is bound to the galaxy is expected to have a velocity close to the systemic velocity of the galaxy .    although stocke et al .",
    "( 1995 ) discussed the problems with huge ionized halos around a single bright spiral galaxy , it might be possible that the ly@xmath0 absorption at @xmath82 kpc from the dwarf arises in an ionized halo . using the model calculations of maloney ( 1992 ) and dove & shull ( 1994 ) , we find that an ionized 80100 kpc halo is not at all unlikely for a dwarf galaxy . for example ,",

    ", we express the metagalactic ionizing radiation field , @xmath97 , with @xmath98 at @xmath99 ev and adopt a spectral index @xmath100 . for a fully ionized gas with @xmath101 and @xmath102 ,",
    "we find @xmath103 and @xmath104 note that @xmath105 is proportional to @xmath106 , owing to the @xmath107 dependence of the recombinations that form h  i. in the inner portions of disks , where the gas layer is optically thick to external ionizing radiation , the h  i radial distribution , @xmath108 , closely tracks that of total hydrogen , @xmath109 .",
    "however , in the extended disk , beyond the radius at which the integrated column of h  i drops below several times @xmath110 @xmath27 , the disk becomes optically thin to ionizing radiation , and the above photoionization analysis applies . in this regime ,",
    "the radial h  i distribution falls off as @xmath106 , which in an exponential gaseous disk results in a very sharp falloff in h  i. however , in disks with power - law gaseous distributions , @xmath111 ( @xmath112 ) , the h  i decreases with radius as @xmath113 .",
    "let us now compare these expectations to the observed ly@xmath0 absorbers , which typically have columns n(h  i ) @xmath114 @xmath27 . from eq .",
    "( 8) , if the hst - observed ly@xmath0 cloud has h",
    "i column density @xmath115 at @xmath116 , the gaseous disk at that radius must have a total hydrogen column density @xmath117 assuming the optically - thin limit .",

    "the mass of the isothermal dark - matter halo required to confine the gas in equilibrium is given by , @xmath127 the ratio of halo mass to gas mass is therefore @xmath128 , not dissimilar from values in other galaxies .",
    "a possible physical association between the ly@xmath0 absorber at 5100 km  s@xmath2 seen toward pks  2155 - 304 and eso  466-g032 is even less clear cut .",

    "lanzetta et al .",
    "( 1995 ) find that only 1 out of 9 galaxies at projected distances larger than @xmath129 kpc from the line of sight toward hst spectroscopic target qso s gives rise to associated ly@xmath0 absorption , while 5 out of 5 galaxies at distances less than @xmath130 kpc give rise to associated ly@xmath0 absorption . however more recent data by bowen et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and le brun et al .",
    "( 1996 ) show that the covering factor of galaxies between 50 and @xmath131 kpc is roughly 0.5 for equivalent widths larger than 0.3  .",
    "thus , our discovery does not seem that unusual .",
    "the galaxy is a small sb spiral with @xmath132",
    ". it would be quite extraordinary if it had a gaseous halo extending out to 250 kpc or so .",
    "the long dynamic time scales at those distances make it unlikely that the gas has virialized or settled into a disk ( stocke et al .",
    "note , however , that zaritski & white ( 1994 ) find that isolated spirals have dark halos extending out to 200 or 300 kpc , thus even if the ly@xmath0 absorber is not part of a halo of ionized gas , it may still sit in the potential of the galaxy . as in the case of mrk  335 , the kinematics of the galaxy do not help to elucidate the situation , the ly@xmath0 absorber is at the systemic velocity of the galaxy .    in the high - velocity range toward pks  2155 - 304 , we see three galaxies at rather large projected distances from the line of sight .",
    "the three galaxies have a mean velocity of 17,021 km  s@xmath2 and a line of sight velocity dispersion of 138 km  s@xmath2 , typical of a loose group of galaxies .",
    "the ly@xmath0 absorption at 17,100 km  s@xmath2 occurs close to the mean velocity . in this case",
    ", it seems more plausible that the absorption arises in some general intergalactic gas within a small group , rather than from one galaxy in particular ( mulchaey et al .",
    "1993 , 1996 ) .",
    "the galaxy to the southwest is in projection closest to the line of sight toward the quasar at a distance of @xmath24 kpc .",
    "thus , if the absorption arises in the halo of the nearest galaxy , the halo would have to extend well beyond 300 kpc .",
    "the existence of such a huge ionized halo is problematic by itself ( stocke et al . 1995 ) , in a group environment it will definitely not survive .",
    "of course the intragroup gas may be just that , the remains of the shredded halos .",
    "it is interesting that the absorption at 17,100 km  s@xmath2 is one of the stronger absorption systems .",
    "the situation is reminiscent of the absorbers found toward 3c  273 in the outskirts of the virgo cluster ( bahcall et al .",
    "1991 ; morris et al .",
    "several galaxies are found at distances of 200 to 300 kpc from the sight line , but it is not possible to associate the absorbers with individual galaxies ( morris et al .",
    "1993 ; salpeter and hoffman 1995 ; rauch et al .",
    "1996 ) . as in the present case ,",
    "the absorbers toward 3c  273 have slightly higher column density .",
    "although the current data for the pks 2155 - 304 system , plagued as they are by interference , are not sensitive enough to detect small gas rich dwarfs , such as the one found toward mrk 335 , the 3c  273 data definitely rule out the existence of such dwarfs within 100 kpc from the line of sight toward 3c  273 ( van gorkom et al .",
    "1993 ) .",
    "the absorption at 16,488 km  s@xmath2 seems more difficult to explain .",
    "it is quite far off from the mean velocity of the group .",
    "the h  i emission from f21569 - 330 at a projected distance of @xmath50 kpc comes closest in velocity going down to 16,650 km  s@xmath2 , but not only is the distance to the sight line huge , the approaching side of the galaxy is on the far side from the sight line to the quasar . since for this group we have only sampled the upper end of the h  i mass function it is not unlikely that other galaxies are present which have h  i at the same velocity as the absorber . thus it seems plausible that this absorber is associated with the group as well .    in a recent paper lanzetta , webb and barcons ( 1996 ) report the identification of a group of galaxies at a redshift of 0.26 , that produce a complex of corresponding ly @xmath0 absorption lines . as in the present case one of the absorption systems",
    "has a slightly higher column density .",
    "thus it seems that ly @xmath0 absorption arising in intra group gas may be quite common and that the colomn densities in those environments may be somewhat higher than what is seen near more isolated galaxies .",
    "a search for h  i emission from the vicinity of nearby ly@xmath0 absorbers has resulted in the discovery of some low luminosity galaxies at the same redshift of some of the absorbers , but at large ( 70 to 250 kpc ) projected distances from the sight line . in addition a group of galaxies was found near two absorbers at a velocity of about 17000 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "this confirms previous suggestions that nearby ly@xmath0 absorbers are weakly correlated with galaxies .",
    "individual , more isolated , galaxies may have absorbers that are physically associated with them , either due to infall , galactic winds or tidal disturbances . in regions of higher galactic density",
    "this material may be stripped from individual galaxies and distributed more uniformly through the intergalactic medium .",
    "this project was undertaken in the hope of finding a possible parent population associated with nearby ly@xmath0 absorbers : either luminous galaxies with very extended gaseous envelopes or very low luminosity , but gas rich galaxies , which could have escaped optical detection .",
    "we did indeed find a few optically uncataloged galaxies , which turned out to be very close in velocity to , but at large projected distances from the ly@xmath0 absorbers .",
    "two of the absorbers appear associated with a group of galaxies .",
    "these results are very similar to searches for a possible parent population at optical wavelengths .",
    "most absorbers at low redshift appear to coincide with the large scale structure outlined by the more luminous galaxies ( rauch et al .",
    "1996 ; stocke et al . 1995 ) as was first suggested by oort ( 1981 ) .",
    "one of the outstanding questions is whether the nearby ly@xmath0 absorbers are actually connected to individual galaxies or simply coincide in redshift .",
    "our observations do to a certain extent strengthen the idea that at least some nearby ly@xmath0 absorbers may be arising in mostly ionized halos of individual galaxies .",
    "the discovery in our most sensitive observation of a very small galaxy at @xmath7 kpc from the line of sight toward mrk  335 , suggests that : ( 1 ) deeper surveys may turn up more such candidates ; and ( 2 ) the suggestion ( maloney 1992 ; shull et al .",
    "1996 ) that the ionized halos of smaller galaxies may contribute significantly to the total ly@xmath0 absorbing cross section in the nearby universe may be valid .",
    "the strongest evidence for a physical connection between nearby ly@xmath0 absorbers and galaxies comes from the statistical work by lanzetta et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , who showed that within @xmath130 kpc from a galaxy there is a 100% chance of detecting ly@xmath0 absorption .",
    "there are however also some ly@xmath0 clouds with no optical galaxy within a few mpc ( stocke et al .",
    "1995 ; shull et al . 1996 ) . in one case ,",
    "an anticorrelation between a region of high galaxy density and ly@xmath0 forest absorbing clouds has been found ( morris et al . 1991 ) .",
    "the difference between these results may primarily be due to a difference in cloud column densities .",
    "the lanzetta et al ( 1995 ) absorbers have significantly higher h  i column densities than those studied by morris et al .",
    "( 1991 ) , stocke et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and shull et al .",
    "( 1996 ) .",
    "even if a physical connection is apparent , it is not obvious what the nature of the extended gas is . while barcons et al .",
    "( 1995 ) find in two cases ly@xmath0 absorption that could possibly be interpreted as arising in a corotating halo , there are several examples of even higher column density absorbers and metal lines , where the gas , although clearly associated with galaxies , is not corotating , but instead arises in tidally disturbed gas ( e.g. , womble 1992 ; carilli & van gorkom 1992 ; bowen et al .",
    "thus the final verdict is not out yet .",
    "low column density gas is likely to be found near galaxies , and many possible scenarios can bring it there : retarded infall , outflow , corotating ionized disks , tidal disturbances .",
    "quite likely , all of these occur .",
    "perhaps most puzzling are the clouds that do nt have any galaxies within many mpcs .",
    "these may arise in the filamentary structures as produced in simulations of gravitational structure formation ( cen et al .",
    "1994 ; hernquist et al .",
    "1996 ; miralda - escud et al .",
    "1996 ; mcket et al .",
    "1996 ) , or they may be associated with as yet undetected dwarf galaxies .",
    "this brings us to the final question , what is the connection , if any , between the high redshift ly@xmath0 forest clouds and nearby ly@xmath0 absorbers ? as was pointed out by rauch et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , the size estimate for coherent ly@xmath0 absorption at large redshifts ( bechtold et al . 1994 ; dinshaw et al . 1994 ; fang et al .",
    "1996 ) is typically larger than the transverse separation between galaxies near low redshift ly@xmath0 absorbers .",
    "this not only argues against single extended galactic disks or halos as the main origin for the coherent absorption on large scales seen at high redshifts .",
    "it also argues against the low redshift absorbers being physically the same as the high redshift absorbers .",
    "however , it may well be that at low redshifts galaxies and absorption systems trace the general matter distribution on large scales , a hypothesis that can only be tested statistically using a large ensemble of nearby ly@xmath0 clouds .",
