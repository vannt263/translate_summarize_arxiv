    "hence , whenever @xmath11 equals an integer multiple of the incident wavelength , the transmitted beam constructively interferes and peaks in intensity , while constructive interference for reflected beams occurs when @xmath11 equals half an odd integer multiple .",
    "when a polychromatic source impinges on a sample , the reflectance and transmittance spectra will show fabry - prot interference as a function of wavelength .",
    "these undulations can then be used to deduce the sample s thickness as follows .",

    "this is consistent with optical modelling in reffit@xcite ( black dashed line in fig .  [",
    "fig : fftfig1]b ) , using the well documented complex refractive index of si@xcite , which also yields a value of @xmath32 @xmath1 m .",
    "it is clear that eq .",
    "[ eq : fpt ] is an effective tool for the thickness determination of crystalline wafers , or samples with minimal thickness inhomogeneity .",
    "however , when layered materials are cleaved prior to measurements , smooth surfaces are difficult to prepare .",
    "consequent beating between frequencies originating from sample regions of various thickness rule out the manual application of eq .",
    "[ eq : fpt ] .",
    "moreover , optical modelling of spectra that show beating is extremely challenging , while experimental parameters ( e.g. sample alignment , surface roughness , imperfect data normalization / referencing , etc . ) further complicate the analysis .",
    "for example , the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fftfig1]b shows the reflectance of si divided by its reflectance model . despite the ostensibly successful fit ,",
    "an additional long range undulation is observed , with a periodicity of @xmath4 that of the fabry - prot due to si .",
    "this undulation is caused by fabry - prot inside a polypropylene window in our setup ( as we show later ) , which did not divide out perfectly when the reflectance intensity of si was referenced with gold reflectance .    as a solution to this problem we propose the application of fourier analysis of optical spectra .",
    "a similar approach has previously been used in the context of integrated optics , where fourier analysis of optical transmission data through a waveguide with a microcavity was used to determine the cavity s mode numbers.@xcite starting with any wavenumber dependent spectrum @xmath33 ( e.g. reflectance , transmittance , or unreferenced intensity ) , apodized between wavenumbers @xmath34 and @xmath35 such that all visible fabry - prot interference fringes are included , a fast fourier transform@xcite @xmath36 yields a position ( @xmath37 ) dependent complex quantity @xmath38 . here",

    "we note that @xmath40 is the inverse of the average spacing between fringes of one frequency in @xmath33 and thus corresponds to the position of maxima in the amplitude of @xmath38 .",

    "[ fig : fftfig1 ] a ) . finally , the @xmath51 cm peak originates from a 75 @xmath1 m thick polypropylene window used in the experimental setup .",
    "with @xmath52,@xcite we find @xmath53 @xmath1 m , in good agreement with the manufacturer s specifications .",
    "we note that fabry - prot interference from windows can , in principle , be removed by a reference measurement .",
    "however , nonlinear detectors , optical misalignment , and various other effects can result in residual fabry - prot undulations even in corrected spectra .",
    "hence , to illustrate how our technique can also register and correct such effects , we analyzed the unreferenced reflectance spectrum of si .",
    "besides resolving the sample thickness ( or @xmath14 if @xmath12 is already known ) , a major utility of the fourier analysis approach is that the peaks in @xmath42 , associated with the sample thickness , can be easily removed , even without knowing @xmath14 or @xmath12 .",
    "a subsequent inverse fourier transform then yields the original optical spectrum , devoid of fabry - prot interference , as shown by the black line in fig .",
    "[ fig : fftfig1]c .",
    "this can greatly enhance the quality of optical fits , and reveals spectral features previously obscured by strong undulations .",
    "moreover , even systemic sources of fabry - prot fringes , such as windows , polarizers , or other optical elements , can be easily identified and removed , as illustrated in the si example .",
    "before applying this technique to cleaved van der waals bound materials , it is useful to discuss what can be expected .",
    "one of the underlying assumptions of the described approach is that absorption is minimal and @xmath14 is constant over the chosen spectral range . since @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the complex dielectric function",
    ", we have @xmath56 .",
    "hence , as long as @xmath57 ( i.e. minimal absorption ) and @xmath58 constant ( i.e. @xmath14 is constant ) , the fourier transform approach works very well .",
    "however , while this approximation generally gains validity as @xmath59 , the smallest resolvable spectral feature of the fourier transform is inversely proportional to @xmath60.@xcite a balance must thus be sought where a sufficiently large spectral range is chosen that includes all spacial frequencies associated with expected sample thicknesses . hence , the inevitable finite dispersion of @xmath61 across the selected spectral range will cause the peaks in @xmath42 to broaden .",
    "we note that peak broadening also occurs for samples with a smooth thickness gradient .",

    "[ fig : fftfig2 ] shows the optical spectra ( left panel ) of six different materials , where separate measurements on samples with identical stoichiometry are designated by a i or ii . with the exception of both bi@xmath63se@xmath64 samples and the bi@xmath63te@xmath63se ( ii ) sample ,",

    "real refractive index values for all other samples were measured in toronto,@xcite or reported in the literature.@xcite    most notably , all @xmath67 plots show a single dominant peak accompanied by various smaller peaks , where the dominant peak is associated with the most prominent sample thickness . to further confirm this interpretation , the thickness of both bisbse@xmath63te and bi@xmath72sb@xmath73te@xmath63s crystals were independently determined with a ( mechanical ) digital thickness gauge , and found to be @xmath74 @xmath1 m for both samples ( as predicted by our fourier analysis shown in fig.[fig : fftfig2 ] ) .",
    "the smaller peaks in @xmath67 either result from discrete sample thickness variations ( e.g. 14 @xmath1 m for cr@xmath63ge@xmath63te@xmath65 ) , or are due to harmonics as observed in si ( e.g. 100 @xmath1 m = @xmath75 @xmath1 m for bi@xmath72sb@xmath73te@xmath63s , or 9 @xmath1 m = @xmath76 @xmath1 m , and 13.5 @xmath1",
    "m = @xmath77 @xmath1 m for bi@xmath63se@xmath64 ( i ) ) .",
    "such discrete sample thickness variations ( i.e. inhomogeneity in the @xmath78-plane ) can be easily understood by inspecting the surface of ( poorly ) cleaved layered materials , such as bi@xmath63te@xmath64 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fftfig3]a .",
    "these samples can be modelled as an effective medium , where the total measured optical response @xmath79 is a sum of volume fractions multiplied by their respective optical response function .",
    "for example , the measured reflectance @xmath80 of a sample with two regions of different thickness ( as shown in the top half of fig .",
    "[ fig : fftfig3 ] b ) would be @xmath81 . here ,",
    "@xmath82 and @xmath83 are a function of volume fractions @xmath84 and @xmath85 , respectively , and @xmath86 are the squared magnitudes of the associated complex fresnel reflection coefficients .",
    "we note that inhomogeneity in the @xmath87-direction , such as voids inside a crystal ( as shown in the bottom half of fig .",
    "[ fig : fftfig3 ] b ) could also produce multiple peaks in @xmath67 .",
    "however , in such a scenario the total optical response would be given by the squared norm of the sum of fresnel coefficients ( e.g. @xmath88 where @xmath89 are reflection coefficients for each interface in the multilayered sample ) .",
    "in other words , for inhomogeneity along @xmath87 , the complex amplitudes are added , as opposed to intensities for @xmath78 inhomogeneities .",
    "therefore , cross terms in @xmath90 result in sums and differences of the various fabry - prot frequencies .",
    "although we see no obvious signatures of this effect in fig .",
    "[ fig : fftfig2 ] , it can be used as a discriminating technique in determining sample integrity .",
    "we note that detection of such additional thin layers may be difficult since the typical resolution of @xmath67 is @xmath91 m .",
    "hence , it is possible that the observed width of the peaks in @xmath67 , even when @xmath58 constant , is a result of unresolved peaks from inhomogeneities in the @xmath87 direction , symmetrically positioned below and above the dominant peak . regardless , from the many peaks in @xmath67 ( and fig .",
    "[ fig : fftfig3]a ) it is clear that none of the layered materials produce an optically flat surface across the full sample when cleaved .",
    "the observation of fabry - prot fringes , however , does imply high surface quality for all individual regions of constant thickness .    in principle ,",
    "all peaks can be fitted so that their center position , width and spectral weight can be used to replicate the measured fabry - prot fringes in an optical model .",
    "more convenient , however , is to remove the appropriate peaks from @xmath67 , and fit its inverse fourier transform spectrum with a model that ignores fabry - prot .",
    "the black lines in the left panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : fftfig2 ] show the result of such optical spectra , in which all fabry - prot fringes have been removed . to confirm that such filtering only removes the fabry - prot fringes , and preserves all other spectral information , the transmittance of bi@xmath72sb@xmath73te@xmath63s was fit with a model that captures the fabry - prot fringes reasonably well , as shown in fig .",

    "( b ) layered materials can show both step edges and/or partially detached flakes .",
    "samples with step edges can be optically described as an effective medium with various thickness ( e.g. @xmath94 and @xmath95 ) with associated volume fractions ( i.e. functions of areas @xmath96 and @xmath97 ) .",
    "( c ) transmittance spectrum and optical model of bi@xmath72sb@xmath73te@xmath63s .",
    "when optical coherence @xmath92 in the fit is set to 0 , the transmittance spectrum matches the filtered ifft of the bi@xmath72sb@xmath73te@xmath63s thickness distribution @xmath67 .",

    "this is particularly clear for rucl@xmath64 , where samples with @xmath102 @xmath1 m would produce fabry - prot fringes that are hard to distinguish from intrinsic electronic absorption .",
    "nevertheless , a major advantage of this fourier transform filter technique is that it addresses only specific frequencies associated with fabry - prot interference , while no knowledge of the refractive index is required .",
    "finally , we discuss the comparison of reflectance and transmittance spectra on the same sample , as measured for bi@xmath63se@xmath64 ( i ) and bisbse@xmath63te .",
    "the interference condition described in section  [ sec : fp ] predicts that for identical values for @xmath13 and @xmath15 , the fabry - prot fringes of reflectance and transmittance spectra should overlap , so that @xmath103 .",
    "however , from fig .  [",
    "fig : fftfig2 ] it is clear that this is not always the case . while we can not comment on the experimental conditions under which the bi@xmath63se@xmath64 ( i ) spectra were obtained,@xcite it is possible that the sample was cleaved between @xmath104 and @xmath105 measurements ( thus reducing the thickness ) , or the incident angle @xmath13 changed between measurements . for bisbse@xmath63te",

    "[ fig : fftfig3]b , and occasionally observed upon careful visual inspection of the sample s surface when the flake is sufficiently detached from the bulk crystal . while this can only be confirmed with alternative techniques ( e.g. x - ray diffraction or scanning electron microscopy ) , it would be of considerable relevance . in topological insulators , such as bisbse@xmath63te",
    ", multiple surfaces would result in a greater surface state contribution to optical / electronic properties ; a scenario that has been previously suggested.@xcite an alternative explanation for the mismatch between @xmath106 and @xmath107 , however , is the imperfect overlap of the probed sample regions between @xmath104 and @xmath105 , as a result of misalignment , beam clipping , or chromatic aberrations .",
    "in this letter , we have shown how fourier analysis of optical spectra offers some previously unexplored opportunities in the study of novel materials .",
    "when the real refractive index of a material is known , this technique provides a quick measure of the sample thickness and discrete thickness variations of semi - transparent samples , without the application of a physical ( potentially destructive ) probe . moreover , even without knowledge of the refractive index , the inverse fourier transform of a filtered thickness spectrum yields an optical spectrum devoid of fabry - prot fringes .",
    "such treatment can expose previously obscured features , and can also be used to remove the strong optical effects of sample substrates , windows , or other optical components that cause fabry - prot interference .",
    "we have shown how this technique is applicable not only to carefully manufactured semiconductors , such as si wafers , but also to a wide variety of cleavable materials , including topological insulators , thermoelectrics , and magnetic insulators . hence ,",
