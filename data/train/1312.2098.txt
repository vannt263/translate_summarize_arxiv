    "a filament is a one - dimensional , smooth , connected structure embedded in a multi - dimensional space .",
    "filaments arise in many applications . for example , matter in the universe tends to concentrate near filaments that comprise what is known as the cosmic - web  @xcite , and the structure of that web can serve as a tracer for estimating fundamental cosmological constants .",
    "other examples include neurofilaments and blood - vessel networks in neuroscience  @xcite , fault lines in seismology  @xcite , and landmark paths in computer vision  @xcite .",
    "consider point - cloud data @xmath0 in @xmath1 , drawn independently from a density @xmath2 with compact support .",
    "we define the filaments of the data distribution as the _ ridges _ of the probability density function @xmath2 .",
    "( see section [ sec::ridges ] for details . )",
    "there are several alternative ways to formally define filaments  @xcite , but the definition we use has several useful statistical properties @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : ex ] shows two simple examples of point cloud data sets and the filaments estimated by our method .",
    "the problem of estimating filaments has been studied in several fields and a variety of methods have been developed , including parametric  @xcite ; nonparametric  @xcite ; gradient based  @xcite ; and topological  @xcite .",
    "while all these methods provide filament estimates , none provide an assessment of the estimate s uncertainty .",
    "that filament estimates are random sets is a significant challenge in constructing valid uncertainty measures @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we introduce a local uncertainty measure for filament estimates .",
    "we characterize the asymptotic distribution of estimated filaments and use it to derive consistent estimates of the local uncertainty measure and to construct valid confidence sets for the filament based on bootstrap resampling .",
    "our main results are as follows :    * we show that if the data distribution is smooth , so are the estimated filaments ( theorem  [ s1 ] ) . *",
    "we find the asymptotic distribution for estimated local uncertainty and its convergence rate ( theorem  [ lu2 ] ,  [ lu4 ] ) .",
    "* we construct valid and consistent , bootstrap confidence sets for the local uncertainty , and thus pointwise confidence sets for the filament ( theorem  [ sb2 ] ) .",
    "we apply our methods to point cloud data from examples in astronomy and seismology and demonstrate that they yield useful confidence sets .",
    "let @xmath3 be random sample from a distribution with compact support in @xmath1 that has density @xmath2 .",
    "let @xmath4 and @xmath5 denote the gradient and hessian , respectively , of @xmath6 .",
    "we begin by defining the _ ridges _ of @xmath2 , as defined in  @xcite .",
    "while there are many possible definitions of ridges , this definition gives stability in the underlying density , estimability at a good rate of convergence , and fast reconstruction algorithms , as described in @xcite . in the rest of this paper ,",
    "the filaments to be estimated are just the one - dimensional ridges of @xmath2 .",
    "a mode of the density @xmath2  where the gradient @xmath7 is zero and all the eigenvalues of @xmath8 are negative  can be viewed as a zero - dimensional ridge .",
    "ridges of dimension @xmath9 generalize this to the zeros of a _ projected gradient _ where the @xmath10 smallest eigenvalues of @xmath8 are negative .",
    "in particular for @xmath11 , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the projected gradient . here , the matrix @xmath14 is defined as @xmath15 $ ] for eigenvectors @xmath16 of @xmath5 corresponding to eigenvalues @xmath17 because one - dimensional ridges are the primary concern of this paper , we will refer to @xmath18 in ( [ eq::ridge - def ] ) as the `` ridges '' of @xmath2 .",
    "intuitively , at points on the ridge , the gradient is the same as the largest eigenvector and the density curves downward sharply in directions orthogonal to that .",
    "when @xmath2 is smooth and the _ eigengap _ @xmath19 is positive , the ridges have the all essential properties of filaments .",
    "that is , @xmath18 decomposes into a set of smooth curve - like structures with high density and connectivity .",
    "@xmath18 can also be characterized through morse theory  @xcite as the collection of @xmath20-critical - points along with the local maxima , also known as the set of 1-ascending manifolds with their local - maxima limit points  @xcite .",
    "we estimate the ridge in three steps : density estimation , thresholding , and ascent .",
    "first , we estimate @xmath2 from from the data @xmath21 . here",
    ", we use the well - known kernel density estimator ( kde ) defined by @xmath22 where the kernel @xmath23 is a smooth , symmetric density function such as a gaussian and @xmath24 is the bandwidth which controls the smoothness of the estimator . because ridge estimation can tolerate a fair degree of oversmoothing ( as shown in @xcite ) , we select @xmath25 by a simple rule that tends to oversmooth somewhat , the multivariate silverman s rule  @xcite . under weak conditions ,",
    "this estimator is consistent ; specifically , @xmath26 as @xmath27 .",
    "( we say that @xmath28 converges in probability to @xmath29 , written @xmath30 if , for every @xmath31 , @xmath32 as @xmath33 . )",
    "second , we threshold the estimated density to eliminate low - probability regions and the spurious ridges produced in @xmath34 by random fluctuations . here , we remove points with estimated density less than @xmath35 for a user - chosen threshold @xmath36 .",
    "finally , for a set of points above the density threshold , we follow the ascent lines of the projected gradient to the ridge , which is the the subspace constrainted mean shift ( scms ) algorithm  @xcite .",
    "this procedure can be viewed as estimating the ridge by applying the ridge operator to @xmath34 : @xmath37 note that @xmath38 is a random set .",
    "the bootstrap  @xcite is a statistical method for assessing the variability of an estimator .",
    "let @xmath21 be a random sample from a distribution @xmath39 and let @xmath40 be some functional of @xmath39 to be estimated , such as the mean of the distribution or ( in our case ) the ridge set of its density .",
    "given some procedure @xmath41 for estimating @xmath42 we estimate the variability of @xmath43 by _ resampling _ from the original data .",
    "specifically , we draw a _ bootstrap sample _ @xmath44 independently and with replacement from the set of observed data points @xmath45 and compute the estimate @xmath46 using the bootstrap sample as if it were the data set .    this process is repeated @xmath47 times , yielding @xmath47 bootstrap samples and corresponding estimates @xmath48 .",
    "the variability in these estimates is then used to assess the variability in the original estimate @xmath49 .",
    "for instance , if @xmath50 is a scalar , the variance of @xmath43 is estimated by @xmath51 where @xmath52 . under suitable conditions",
    ", it can be shown that this bootstrap variance estimates  and confidence sets produced from it  are consistent .",
    "the _ smooth bootstrap _ is a variant of the bootstrap that can be useful in function estimation problems where the same procedure is used except the bootstrap sample is drawn from the estimated density @xmath53 instead of the original data .",
    "we use both variants below .",
    "we measure the _ local uncertainty _ in a filament ( ridge ) estimator @xmath54 by the expected distance between a specified point in the original filament @xmath18 and the estimated filament : @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the distance function : @xmath57 the local uncertainty measure can be understood as the expected dispersion for a given point in the original filament to the estimated filament based on sample with size @xmath58 .",
    "the theoretical analysis of @xmath59 is given in theorem  [ lu4 ] .",
    "because @xmath59 is defined in terms unknown distribution @xmath2 and the unknown filament set @xmath18 , it must be estimated .",
    "we use bootstrap resampling to do this , defining an estimate of local uncertainty _ on the estimated filaments_. for each of @xmath47 bootstrap samples , @xmath60 , we compute the kernel density estimator @xmath61 , the ridge estimate @xmath62 , and the divergence @xmath63 for all @xmath64 .",
    "we estimate @xmath59 by @xmath65 for each @xmath66 , where the expectation is from the ( known ) bootstrap distribution . algorithm 1 provides pseudo - code for this procedure , and theorem  [ sb2 ]",
