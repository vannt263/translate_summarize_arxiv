    "many experimental and theoretical papers have been seeking to the nature of high - temperature superconductivity ( htsc ) in cuprates .",
    "in contrast to the normal ( fermi - liquid ) metal , htsc compounds show many abnormal properties for temperatures above the superconducting transition@xcite .",
    "recently a generalized lda+dmft+@xmath4 computational scheme was proposed to describe the pseudogap state in strongly correlated systems , by accounting for nonlocal afm ( or cdw ) fluctuations with short - range order @xcite .",
    "its relation to other theoretical dmft - like@xcite approaches to the pseudogap state was discussed e.g. in ref .  .",
    "both model computations and those for real systems were done @xcite .",
    "this approach , for instance , allowed the experimentally observed partial fermi surface ( fs ) `` destruction''@xcite , which was theoretically studied for htsc prototype system bi@xmath5sr@xmath5cacu@xmath5o@xmath6 ( bi2212)@xcite and one nd@xmath7ce@xmath8cuo@xmath2 ( ncco)@xcite .",
    "two - particle properties can also be described this approach@xcite , e.g. calculated optical spectra in the pseudogap state well with experimental data for bi2212@xcite and ncco@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study the electron - doped pr@xmath0ce@xmath1cuo@xmath2 ( pcco ) in the pseudogap state ( @xmath9 ) using the generalized lda+dmft+@xmath4 computational scheme @xcite and arpes measurements@xcite .",
    "we present here both experimental and theoretical quasiparticle spectral functions and fermi surfaces .",
    "these are found to agree well with each other supporting competing order parameter fluctuations as origin of the pseudogap instead of superconducting scenario .",
    "the crystal structure@xcite of pr@xmath5cuo@xmath2 has tetragonal symmetry and the space group is i4/mmm .",
    "lattice constants@xcite are there are two crystallographic types of oxygen atoms in pr@xmath5cuo@xmath2 : the first one belongs to cuo@xmath5 layer and the second is located within the pr atoms .",
    "the atomic positions in the elementary cell are as follows : cu ",
    "2a(0,0,0 ) , o1 ",
    "4c(0,0.5,0 ) , pr ",

    "clearly visible quasi two - dimensional nature of these compound determines its physical properties .",
    "physically most interesting are the cuo@xmath5 layers .",
    "those layers provide antibonding cu-3@xmath10(@xmath11 ) partially filled orbital , whose dispersion crosses the fermi level .",
    "thus we are using this effective cu-3@xmath10(@xmath11 ) antibonding band as a `` bare '' band in dmft computations .",

    "the lda band structure calculation was performed . using crystal structure data ,",
    "the electronic band structure was obtained with the linearized muffin - tin orbitals ( lmto ) method@xcite . further hopping",
    "integral values were calculated for effective cu-3@xmath10(@xmath11 ) wannier function within the -th order lmto ( nmto ) framework.@xcite corresponding hopping integral values are @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 .",
    "the value of coulomb interaction on effective cu-3@xmath10(@xmath11 ) orbital @xmath15=1.1  ev was obtained via constrained lda computations@xcite .",
    "secondly , the dmft calculations @xcite , which take the hopping integrals and the coulomb interaction as input parameters , were performed .    to account for the afm spin fluctuations , two - dimensional model of pseudogap state",
    "is applied.@xcite corresponding * k*-dependent self - energy @xmath4@xcite describes nonlocal correlations induced by ( quasi ) static short - range collective heisenberg - like afm spin fluctuations .",
    "the quasi static approximation for afm fluctuations necessarily limits our approach to high - enough temperatures ( energies not so close to the fermi level)@xcite , so that in fact we are unable to judge e.g. on the nature of low temperature ( energy ) damping in our model .",
    "thus we avoid here possible discussion of whether the damping corresponds to marginal or regular fermi liquid .",
    "moreover as shown in ref .",
    "for the `` hot - spot '' corresponding self - energy has essentially non fermi liquid behavior .",
    "the @xmath4 definition contains two important parameters : the pseudogap energy scale ( amplitude ) @xmath16 , representing the energy scale of fluctuating , and the spatial correlation length @xmath17 .",
    "is usually determined from experiment .",
    "the @xmath16 value was calculated as described in ref . and found to be 0.275  ev .",

    "photoemission experiments were performed at ue112-pgm beamline at bessy using scienta ses100 analyzer .",
    "typical energy and angular resolution for the excitation energy ( @xmath19ev ) used in this study were 20mev and @xmath20 respectively .",
    "samples of pr@xmath7ce@xmath8cuo@xmath21 were grown using traveling solvent floating zone technique and annealed to achieve optimal @xmath22 of 25k with transition width of 1k ,    for the photoemission measurements the samples were mounted on a cryomanipulator and cleaved in situ in with a base pressure @xmath23 mbar . during the whole experiment , including the temperature cycling , when the sample was heated to room temperature and then cooled back again , no observable aging effects were detected .",
    "generally speaking , finite temperature and interaction lead to notable life - time effects .",
    "thus , instead of quasiparticle dispersions obtained in usual band structure calculations one has to deal with corresponding spectral function @xmath24 : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the retarded green s function obtained via lda+dmft+@xmath4 scheme@xcite .",
    "color plots , whose intensity encodes the function values became a traditional and convenient way of representing these multiple variable functions .",
    "such a color plot of lda+dmft+@xmath4 quasiparticle spectral function ( [ specf ] ) of copper 3@xmath10(@xmath11 ) orbital is presented in fig .",
    "[ contour_plot ] . of quasiparticle",
    "spectral function in the color plot is inversely proportional to the quasiparticle life time .",
    "the calculated quasiparticle band dispersion has minimum at @xmath27 point ( -1.52  ev ) and maximum at m point ( 2  ev ) .",
    "it crosses the fermi level along x - m as well as m-@xmath27 directions . because of afm pseudogap fluctuations there is well detectable ( quasi ) folding of the quasiparticle band , reflected in the formation of the so called `` shadow '' band , which has its maxima at @xmath27-point and minima at m - point .",
    "however , because of the short - range nature of the antiferromagnetic order , this does not result in a complete folding , as it would be the case for a long - range afm order .",
    "namely , quasiparticle band and the `` shadow '' band are not exactly the same .",
    "no real band gap opens at ( @xmath28 ) point .",
    "nevertheless , suppression of the spectral weight is clearly detectable in the vicinity of x @xmath29 point , thus signaling opening of the pseudogap , which in this case can be viewed as a precursor of the real band gap .",
    "splitting takes place between the quasiparticle band and the `` shadow '' band with the value about 2@xmath16 .",
    "( upper panels  theoretical data , lower panels  experimental photoemission intensity ) . to judge about",
    "the absolute intensities of the `` shadow '' ( 1 ) and main band ( 2 ) cut 1 contains an mdc curve integrated in an energy window 60 mev centered at the fermi level ( fl ) .",
    "similarly integral edc for cut 2 ( `` hot spot '' ) shows suppression of the intensity at the fl as compared to cut 3 , which is located further away from the `` hot spot '' .",
    "the fl is zero.[cuts ] ]    in fig .",
    "[ fermisurface ] an extended picture of pcco fermi surfaces is presented ( panel ( a )  lda+dmft+@xmath4 results , panel ( b )  experimental arpes data ) . strictly speaking fig .",
    "[ fermisurface ] is color map in reciprocal space of corresponding spectral function plotted fermi level .",
    "fs is clearly visible as reminiscence of non - interacting band close to the first brillouin zone border and around point ( so called fermi arc ) , where the quasiparticle band crosses the fermi level .",
    "there is interesting physical effect of partial `` destruction '' of the fs observed in the `` hot spots '' , points that are located at the intersection of the fs and its afm umklapp replica .",
    "this fs `` destruction '' occurs because of the strong electron scattering on the antiferromagnetic ( afm ) spin ( pseudogap ) fluctuations on the copper atoms .",
    "also the `` shadow '' fs is visible as it should be for afm folding .",
    "the `` shadow '' fs has weaker intensity with respect to fs .",
    "another evidence of presence of electron pockets can be seen in the experimental fs map shown in fig  [ fermisurface]b .",
    "one pocket is centered at point with coordinates ( 0,0.8@xmath30 ) and the other at ( 0.8@xmath30,0 ) .",
    "again , in agreement with the theoretical prediction , the pocket `` sides '' which coincide with originally unreconstructed fs have higher intensity , while the newly appearing `` replicas / shadows '' have weaker intensity .",
    "the pcco fs is very similar to that of nd@xmath0ce@xmath1cuo@xmath2 ( ncco ) , which belongs to the same family of supperconductors .",
    "the ncco was recently studied both theoretically@xcite and experimentally @xcite .",
    "let us compare theoretical ( upper line ) and experimental ( lower line ) energy quasiparticle dispersion for most characteristic cuts introduced in fig .",
    "[ fermisurface ] ( see fig .  [ cuts ] ) .",
    "theoretical data multiplied by the fermi function and convoluted with gaussian to simulate the effects of experimental resolution , with further artificial noise added .",
    "the cut 1 intersects quasiparticle and `` shadow '' fermi surfaces close to the border .",
    "one can find here a `` fork''-like structure formed by the damped `` shadow '' band ( -0.5 - 0 ) and better defined quasiparticle band ( 0.5 - 1 a.u . ) .",
    "this structure corresponds to preformation of fs cylinder around ( @xmath30,0 ) point .",
    "the cut 2 goes exactly through the `` hot spot '' . here",
    "we see strong suppression of the quasiparticle band around the fermi level as it is also shown in fig .",
    "[ contour_plot ] .",
    "the cut 3 crosses the fermi arc , where we can see a very well defined quasiparticle band .",
    "however intensity `` shadow '' band is also present . for the case of long range afm order and complete folding of electronic structure , fs and its `` shadow '' should form a closed fs sheet around ( @xmath31 , @xmath31 ) point , while in the current case the part of the pocket formed by the `` shadow '' band is not so well defined in momentum space .",
    "as can be seen there is good correspondence between the calculated and experimental data in terms of the above described behavior , which is also similar to the results reported for nd@xmath0ce@xmath1cuo@xmath2 ( ncco ) in our earlier work.@xcite",
    "in this work the lda+dmft+@xmath4 was performed for electron - doped pr@xmath0ce@xmath1cuo@xmath2 compound in the pseudogap regime .",
    "the lda+dmft+@xmath4 calculation shows that fermi - liquid behavior is still conserved far away from the `` hot - spots '' , while the destruction of the fermi surface observed in the vicinity of `` hot spots '' is due to strong scattering of correlated electrons on short - range antiferromagnetic ( pseudogap ) fluctuations .",
    "comparison between experimental arpes and lda+dmft+@xmath4 data reveals a good semiquantitative agreement .",
    "the experimental and theoretical results obtained once again support the afm scenario of pseudogap formation not only in hole doped htsc systems@xcite but also in electron doped ones  @xcite .",
