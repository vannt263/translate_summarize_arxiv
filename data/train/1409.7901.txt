    "ferroelectric ultrathin films and heterostructure have attracted great interest in recent years@xmath6 .",
    "the ferroelectricity , in particular , the critical thickness , was found depend strongly on the proper choice of the interface . by controlling the chemical bonding at the interface , both the enhanced and decreased ferroelectricity",
    "have been found in batio@xmath5 and pbtio@xmath5 ultrathin films .",
    "in fact , polar discontinuity at the heterointerface widely exists at oxide based heterostructures@xmath7 .",
    "generally , it will lead to carrier doping in formerly insulating component and consequently emergent electronic phase , e.g. , conducting two - dimensional electron gas in laalo@xmath5-srtio@xmath5 heterointerface . for ferroelectric materials , as studied in the batio@xmath5 bulk system@xmath8 , such a kind of carrier doping will strongly decrease the ferroelectricity , equally for the electron doping and the hole doping . in the heterostructures or ferroelectric ultrathin films , however , the situation is yet not clear . in all the previous studies of the ferroelectric ultrathin films@xmath9 ,",
    "metallic electrode either of srruo@xmath5 ( with alternating ( sro)@xmath3 and ( ruo@xmath1)@xmath3 layers ) or pt shows no polar features .",
    "generally , as demonstrated in fig .  1",
    ", the charge and potential diagrams in the metal - ferroelectrics superlattice can be simply described by a screening model .",
    "the charge distribution of symmetric metal - ferroelectrics interfaces with normal metal , such as pt and au , is illustrated in fig .",
    "1(a ) with corresponding potential energy in fig .",
    "however , if a positively charged layer ( e.g. the ( lao)@xmath4 layer ) is allowed at the interface , then , screening electrons will accumulate at adjacent ferroelectric layer ( see fig .",
    "1(b ) , here spontaneous polarization is set zero for clarity ) , and an inhomogeneous electron doping will take place in the ferroelectric component . taking the polarization into account , as illustrated in fig .",
    "1(e ) , the potential profile is the superposition of them .",
    "on the other hand , for a negatively charged layer , similarly asymmetric potential but with reversal sign is shown in fig .",
    "such a picture suggests that the ferroelectric performance in the thin film geometry should be the same for electron doping case and hole doping one , the situation of which is similar to the bulk system@xmath8 .    in order to check the validity of the above picture , we use lanio@xmath5 as electrode with alternating charged layers of ( lao)@xmath4 and ( nio@xmath1)@xmath2 . perovskite oxide lanio@xmath5 is structurally compatible with ferroelectric batio@xmath5 , and ferroelectric thin films with lanio@xmath5 electrodes",
    "were found to possess better fatigue properties compared with other metallic oxides@xmath10 . as shown in fig .  2 ,",
    "lanio@xmath5-batio@xmath5 superlattices are proposed .",
    "here , two types of polar discontinuities are clearly distinguished , namely ( lao)@xmath4/(tio@xmath1)@xmath3 with positive charge and ( nio@xmath1)@xmath2/(bao)@xmath3 negative one , which correspond to the situation described in fig .",
    "1(b ) and ( c ) , respectively . in the following",
    ", we will provide a systematic first - principles study of atomic and electronic structures in these lanio@xmath5-batio@xmath5 superlattices .",
    "our calculations provide solid evidence of contrast between electron doping and hole doping in nanoscale ferroelectrics .",
    "our @xmath11 @xmath12 calculations are performed using the full - potential projector - augmented wave ( paw ) method@xmath13 , as implemented in the vienna @xmath11 @xmath12 simulation package ( vasp)@xmath14 .",
    "they are based on local density - approximation , which can describe both ferroelectric batio@xmath5 and electrode lanio@xmath5 well@xmath15 .",
    "a plane - wave cutoff of 500 ev is used throughout , and atomic relaxations are converged using @xmath16 monkhorst - pack k - point sampling of brillouin zone until the maximum hellman - feynman force acting on each atom is less than 0.01 ev /  .",
    "paw potentials are used to describe the electron - ion interaction with 9 valence electrons for la ( @xmath17 ) , 16 for ni ( @xmath18 ) , 10 for ba ( @xmath19 ) , ti ( @xmath20 ) , and 6 for o ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "superlattice is ( 001 ) epitaxially grown on srtio@xmath5 substrate with the in - plane lattice constant of 3.866  .",
    "the superlattice structures we use are [ lao-(nio@xmath1-lao)@xmath22/(tio@xmath1-bao)@xmath23-tio@xmath1 ] and [ nio@xmath1-(lao - nio@xmath1)@xmath22/(bao - tio@xmath1)@xmath23-bao ] , as shown in fig .  2 for @xmath25 .",
    "the ( lao)@xmath4/(tio@xmath1)@xmath3 interface here is similar to ( lao)@xmath4/(tio@xmath1)@xmath3 in laalo@xmath5-srtio@xmath5 superlattice@xmath26 and ( nbo@xmath1)@xmath4/(sro)@xmath3 interface in knbo@xmath5-srtio@xmath5 superlattice@xmath27 . and the second type interface ( nio@xmath1)@xmath2/(bao)@xmath3 has not been reported in the literature .",
    "first , we study the inherent ferroelectric displacement and its evolution with the thickness of ferroelectric layer . in fig",
    ".  3(a)-(f ) and 3(g)-(l ) , the relative cation - anion displacements within both lanio@xmath5 and batio@xmath5 are plotted . in batio@xmath5 ,",
    "the spontaneous polarization is proportional to the relative cation - anion displacements@xmath28 . here",
    ", the existence of ferroelectricity in ferroelectric barrier is determined by the non - zero total polarization of the whole batio@xmath5 barrier@xmath29 .",
    "clearly , for ( lao)@xmath4/(tio@xmath1)@xmath3 interfaces , one can see that the batio@xmath5 film is paraelectric ( pe ) when the thickness of batio@xmath5 is smaller than six unit cells . on the other hand , for the case of ( nio@xmath1)@xmath2/(bao)@xmath3 interfaces",
    ", the ferroelectricity of batio@xmath5 film will be preserved down to the thickness of four unit cells .",
    "the above results differ greatly from the srruo@xmath5-batio@xmath5-srruo@xmath5 capacitor , where the critical thickness of batio@xmath5 film with sro / tio@xmath1 interfaces is thinner than that of batio@xmath5 film with ruo@xmath1/bao interfaces@xmath30 .",
    "the polarity - discontinuity at metal - ferroelectric interfaces is therefore dominating .",
    "in addition , the relative cation - anion displacements for @xmath31 approach the bulk value of batio@xmath5 .    to gain a deeper insight into the above differences , electronic structure of local density of state",
    "is plotted in fig . 4 for the superlattice ( lanio@xmath5)@xmath32-(batio@xmath5)@xmath33 , where the batio@xmath5 film stays on paraelectric(pe ) state as illustrated in fig .",
    "3 , thus , the effect of polar discontinuity on the dos of batio@xmath5 is investigated without consideration of the influence of spontaneous polarization at the first step .",
    "the layer - projected dos are centrosymmetric for both two types of interfaces . for ( lao)@xmath4/(tio@xmath1)@xmath3 interfaces in fig .",
    "4(a ) , the fermi energy is pushed into the bottom of conduction band , which is similar to the positively charged ( lao)@xmath4 doped in srruo@xmath5-batio@xmath5-srruo@xmath5 junctions@xmath34 .",
    "due to the discontinuity of polarity , electrons transfer from the metal to batio@xmath5 film to neutralize the polarity , and charge leakage will suppress polarization of fe film by producing a ferroelectrically dead layer . here",
    ", the doping is inhomogeneous among the interface and the interior of batio3 film .",
    "things will be different for ( nio@xmath1)@xmath2/(bao)@xmath3 polarity - discontinuity interfaces in fig .",
    "4(b ) , where fermi energy shifts to the top of valence band of batio@xmath5 , and the interfacial bao layer becomes obviously metallic , which is induced by the hole doping in the interfacial bao layer .",
    "if the dos of the interfacial batio@xmath5 layer is conductive , then we say the interface is metallic , i.e. , the contact between the electrode and batio@xmath5 barrier is ohmic contact@xmath35 .",
    "similarly , when the dos of the interfacial batio@xmath5 layer is insulative , then a tunneling barrier is formed at the interface , which has also been defined in ref .  13 for srruo@xmath5/_n_-batio@xmath5 interface .    with the presence of polarization in fig .  5 for the superlattice ( lanio@xmath5)@xmath32-(batio@xmath5)@xmath36 with the ferroelectric polarization pointing to the right",
    ", an asymmetric distribution of electronic states is found , with the valence band near the left interface upward and the conduction band near the right interface downward .",
    "for the superlattice with ( lao)@xmath4/(tio@xmath1)@xmath3 interfaces in fig .",
    "5(a ) , ferroelectric polarization controls the accumulation or depletion of electrons near the left and right interfaces , and it is found that the right interface is ohmic contact , while the left interface turns to schottky tunnel barrier with the development of ferroelectricity in the batio@xmath5 component .",
    "the left and right interfaces are both ohmic contact for pe state as shown in fig .",
    "for the case of ( nio@xmath1)@xmath2/(tio@xmath1)@xmath3 interfaces in fig .",
    "5(b ) , the left interface and right interface are always keeping as ohmic contact regardless of the appearance of spontaneous polarization .",
    "the number of accumulated charges , either the electrons of occupied ti @xmath37 orbital in tio@xmath1 layer or o @xmath38 orbital in bao layer for ( lanio@xmath5)@xmath32-(batio@xmath5)@xmath36 superlattice ,",
    "is integrated and shown in fig .  6 . for the superlattice with ( lao)@xmath4/(tio@xmath1)@xmath3 interfaces ,",
    "the polar layer of ( lao)@xmath4 leads to a four electron - doped batio@xmath5 layers at the right ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "for the superlattice with ( nio@xmath1)@xmath2/(tio@xmath1)@xmath3 interface , on the other hand , the holes are restricted at one unit cell ( @xmath40 ) and the magnitude at both sides is much larger than the electron doped cases .",
    "obviously , for the strong itinerant nature of ( nio@xmath1)@xmath2 layer , the holes are absorbed in fermi sea of the lanio@xmath5 electrodes .",
    "these findings are different from srtio@xmath5-laalo@xmath5 heterointerface , where the holes delocalize into srtio@xmath5 at p - type interface and electrons in n - type interface@xmath41 .",
    "in fact , the value @xmath42 and @xmath43 are found independent of the thickness of batio@xmath5 , i.e. , the occurrence of polarization in batio@xmath5 has little influence on the depth of hole - doping . with the above analysis ,",
    "the contrast between electron doping and hole doping is evident in nanoscale ferroelectrics .",
    "the electrostatic potential as demonstrated in fig .",
    "1(c ) is therefore improper for the lanio@xmath5-batio@xmath5 superlattice with ( nio@xmath1)@xmath2/(bao)@xmath3 interfaces , where a more symmetric situation is expected .",
    "the polar discontinuity can be neutralized via interface electronic reconstruction at oxide heterointerface , however , for the metal - ferroelectric heterostructure only electrons can penetrate into batio@xmath5 component .",
    "such differences also lead to variation of ferroelectric critical thickness , which is 4 for hole - doped case and 6 for electron - doped case .",
    "+ in summary , ferroelectricity in lanio@xmath5-batio@xmath5 superlattices with polar discontinuity at the interfaces are investigated from first - principles .",
    "it is found that the polar discontinuity in the ( nio@xmath1)@xmath2/(tio@xmath1)@xmath3 interface is neutralized within the interface , in contrast to the case of ( lao)@xmath4/(tio@xmath1)@xmath3 interface , where the screening electron can penetrate into the batio@xmath5 layer of four unit cells .",
    "such differences make the ferroelectricity in the ultrathin films with ( nio@xmath1)@xmath2/(bao)@xmath3 interface much stronger than that in the ultrathin films with ( lao)@xmath4/(tio@xmath1)@xmath3 interfaces , therefore , providing an avenue to realize the interface control of ferroelectricity as well as functionalities in ferroelectric nanodevices .",
