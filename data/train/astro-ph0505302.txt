    "a circumstellar ( cs ) disk around a young star evolves from a massive remnant of star formation ( a primordial disk , composed mostly of h@xmath1  gas ) to a relatively low mass , gas - free planetary system .",
    "but there are difficulties reconciling observations of cs disks with current theories of giant planet formation . in the traditional picture ,",
    "giant planets form by accretion of gas onto a massive solid core , which must form before the primordial gas in the disk dissipates .",
    "core formation takes at least a few  myr for solar - type stars , much longer for lower mass stars @xcite .",
    "observations suggest that the primordial gas dissipation timescale is shorter than about 10  myr , possibly as short as 1  myr in regions of high - mass star formation @xcite . with these short gas lifetimes",
    ", it would be fairly difficult to form giant planets with current core - accretion scenarios around most solar - type stars and extremely difficult around all low - mass stars .",
    "however , giant planets have been found around many g and k - type stars , and two m - type stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this has led some workers to suggest alternative theories for giant planet formation , i.e.  that they form rapidly by direct collapse in gravitationally unstable disks @xcite .",
    "but it is not clear that current core - accretion models must be rejected , due to the uncertain timescale for primordial gas dissipation around stars of various masses in different star - forming environments .",
    "comparison between the abundance of giant planets around m - stars and the typical h@xmath1  gas lifetime in their disks will be a powerful constraint on theories of giant planet formation .    the m1 star au  microscopii  ( gj  803 ) has long been studied as a nearby flare star ( @xmath5  pc ) .",
    "it is co - moving with the a5v star @xmath0  pictoris , indicating they formed in the same region and are the same age ( @xmath6  myr ; * ? ? ?",
    "the cs dust around au  mic  was imaged in reflected light and shown to lie in an edge - on disk @xcite .",
    "this disk is uniquely suited for comparison to the @xmath0  pic  debris disk and provides a valuable opportunity to examine the effect of stellar mass on disk evolution .",
    "the inclination of the au  mic  disk within 50  au of the star is less than @xmath7 @xcite , even more edge - on than the @xmath0  pic  disk ( @xmath8 ; * ? ? ?",
    "cs gas in the @xmath0  pic  disk has been observed with line - of - sight absorption spectroscopy ( e.g.  co ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and a low upper limit on the h@xmath1  abundance was set using far - uv absorption spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "this limit showed that the primordial gas has largely been dissipated . in this paper , we apply similar analysis to far - uv spectra of au  mic , to probe sensitively for traces of primordial h@xmath1  gas .",
    "we used two sets of archival far - uv spectra of au  mic , one each from the _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer _ ( _ fuse _ ) and the _ hubble space telescope _ space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) .",
    "detailed descriptions of the data and analyses of the stellar emission lines may be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "au  mic  was observed with",
    "_ fuse _  on 2000 august 26 and 2001 october 10 for 17.3  ksec and 26.5  ksec , respectively . these spectra cover with a resolution of about 15  km  s@xmath9  ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "the data were recalibrated with calfuse version 2.4.0 .",
    "the stis data were taken 1998 september 6 ( exposure time = 10.1  ksec ) . these spectra cover with a resolution of 4.4  km  s@xmath9  at 1350    ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "we recalibrated the data with calstis 2.17b .",
    "stellar flares occurred in both datasets .",
    "since emission line shapes and strengths can change during flares ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , data taken at these times were excluded from our analysis .",
    "the _ fuse _  bandpass is covered by 8 partially overlapping spectra , two of which have the same zero - point wavelength offset ( lif1a and lif1b ) .",
    "the bandpasses of the lif1b _ fuse _  spectrum and the stis spectrum overlap , so we set the absolute wavelength calibration of the lif1a and lif1b spectra by cross - correlating on the @xmath12 stellar emission line seen in both datasets .",
    "the zero - point offset of the _ fuse _  spectra was small ( @xmath13  km  s@xmath9 ) .",
    "some of the many strong far - uv electronic transitions of h@xmath1  overlap with commonly seen stellar emission lines , i.e.  the @xmath14 doublet originating in the stellar transition zone , and the chromospheric @xmath15 doublet .",
    "the portion of the _ fuse _  lif1a spectrum including these lines is shown in figure  [ fig : fuse ] .",
    "we have demonstrated that these emission lines can provide the background flux for absorption spectroscopy of h@xmath1   @xcite .      the first step in analyzing the _ fuse _",
    "spectra for molecular hydrogen absorption was to model the intrinsic flux in the emission lines .",
    "this is an emission model with infinite spectral resolution that will be multiplied by an intrinsic absorption model , then convolved with the instrumental line - spread function ( lsf ) to produce a model of the observed flux .",
    "the  @xmath16 line is little affected by h@xmath1  absorption , and the doublet lines are always in the optically thin ratio of 2:1 , unless the @xmath17 line is suppressed by h@xmath1 .",
    "the measured integrated flux ratio of the two  lines is @xmath18 , immediately indicating that there is little line - of - sight h@xmath1  absorption .",
    "we began by least - squares fitting the sum of a narrow and a broad gaussian to the @xmath16 line , since chromospheric and transition zone emission lines from an active star like au  mic  are not well fit with single gaussians ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the widths and peak intensities of the gaussians were adjusted to remove the effect of the gaussian _ fuse _  lsf .",
    "the parameters from the fit to the @xmath16 line were used to model the @xmath17 line , with the peak flux set by the optically thin ratio .",
    "the  @xmath15 lines provide a tighter constraint on h@xmath1  absorption , but were difficult to model , since both can be affected .",
    "therefore , we analyzed the  @xmath19 triplet in the stis data , shown in figure  [ fig : stis ] .",
    "examination of the line profiles shows that the blue wing of the @xmath20 emission line is cut off by ground - state  absorption , which was initially identified as interstellar ( is ) , but the @xmath21 emission line is not affected by excited - state  absorption .",
    "we found the parameters of the  emission by analysis of the @xmath21 line , which is blended with the weak @xmath22 line .",
    "the emission was modeled as the sum of a narrow and broad gaussian for each line , setting the line separation from the rest wavelengths .",
    "the relative line strengths were set using the products of the upper state multiplicities and einstein a - coefficients .",
    "we then performed @xmath23 minimization .",
    "the widths and peak intensities from this analysis were adjusted to remove the effect of the stis lsf , which is very small since the lines are well - resolved .",
    "the narrow component is at @xmath24  km  s@xmath9 , where the error bar is the @xmath25 accuracy of the stis wavelength calibration after a standard target acquisition @xcite . within the uncertainty ,",
    "the  emission is at the velocity of the star ( @xmath26  km  s@xmath9 ; * ? ? ?",
    "as is usually the case , the broad component is slightly redshifted ( @xmath27  km  s@xmath9 ) .",
    "the narrow component has @xmath28  km  s@xmath9  and the broad component has @xmath29  km  s@xmath9 .",
    "the parameters from the @xmath21 minimization were used to model the @xmath20 emission line , again setting the wavelength separation and relative line strength from the atomic data .",
    "we found that the @xmath21 line is not optically thin , since the peak intensities of the gaussians in the @xmath20 line had to be increased slightly to fit the blue wing of the line .",
    "the emission model of the triplet convolved with the stis lsf is shown with a dashed red line in figure  [ fig : stis ] .    to find the parameters of the  @xmath20 absorption",
    ", we used a voigt intrinsic line profile to create an absorption model .",
    "a total model was made by multiplying the triplet emission model by the absorption model , then convolving the result with the stis lsf .",
    "the absorption parameters from @xmath23 minimization of the total model are @xmath30  @xmath3  ( column density ) , @xmath31  km  s@xmath9  ( doppler broadening parameter ) , and @xmath32  km  s@xmath9 .",
    "the convolved final model for the  @xmath19 triplet is overplotted with a solid red line in figure  [ fig : stis ] .",
    "the  absorption is broad and blueshifted with respect to both the star and other absorption lines seen toward au  mic   ( e.g.   at @xmath33  km  s@xmath9 ; * ? ? ?",
    "this suggests that the line - of - sight absorption may not be primarily is .",
    "next , we modeled the  emission doublet in the _ fuse _  spectrum , using the velocities and widths of the narrow and broad gaussians and the ratio of their peak intensities from the stis analysis . the separation of the two lines and their relative strengths were calculated from the atomic data .",
    "the doublet emission model was multiplied by a  @xmath34 absorption line , using the parameters given in the previous paragraph .",
    "the remaining free parameter was a scaling factor on the peak intensity of the @xmath34 line , which was determined by matching the model to the blue wing of the line .",
    "we found that the ratio of the line strengths calculated from the atomic data had to be adjusted slightly to fit the blue wing of the @xmath35 line , again indicating it is not optically thin .",
    "the  and  models were added together to produce an infinite resolution emission model for the 1030  1040    region of the _ fuse _  spectrum .",
    "this model convolved with the _ fuse _  lsf is plotted in figure  [ fig : fuse ] with a solid blue line .",
    "one can immediately see that the  emission lines in the _ fuse _  data are slightly narrower than expected from the width of the stis  lines .",
    "there is no intrinsic reason for this , since we excluded flares from both data sets .",
    "self - absorption suppresses the peak flux of an emission line , but does not make it appear narrower .",
    "the emission lines are resolved , so the uncertainty in the spectral resolution of the _ fuse _  data has little effect on the model . other obvious _ fuse _",
    "instrumental or data artifacts tend to make emission lines appear broader than they really are , not narrower .",
    "it seems there are only two ways to make the _ fuse _  lines appear narrower than the stis lines .",
    "the first is a calibration error that artificially broadened the stis lines .",
    "there is such an error in stis far - uv time - tag data ( like ours ) retrieved from the archive before 2004 april 21 .",
    "however , we recalibrated our data with the corrected pipeline software .",
    "the other way is to remove some emission from the _ fuse _  lines with superimposed h@xmath1  absorption ( discussed further in  [ sub : detect ] ) .",
    "an h@xmath1  absorption model was created using voigt line profiles and molecular data from @xcite .",
    "the free parameters were @xmath36 , the column density in the @xmath37 level , @xmath38 , the column density in the @xmath39 level , and @xmath40 , the velocity of the gas .",
    "only the two lowest energy levels were included , since they contain more than @xmath41 of the molecules at the typical temperatures of debris disks ( @xmath42  k ) .",
    "the intrinsic width of any absorption is unknown , so we made the most conservative assumption ( unresolved lines ) and set the doppler broadening parameter to be very small ( @xmath43  km  s@xmath9 ) .",
    "the h@xmath1  model was multiplied by the _ fuse _  emission model , then convolved with the _ fuse _  lsf .",
    "the resulting total model was compared to the data between 1035.5    and 1037.7    ( the region most affected by h@xmath1  absorption ) . to ensure that all local minima were found ,",
    "@xmath23 minimization was performed using very large ranges of parameters ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "using our contours of @xmath23 , we set upper limits on the line - of - sight h@xmath1   column densities of @xmath45 and @xmath46 . these column densities are ruled out at the @xmath47 level for all @xmath40 . in figure",
    "[ fig : h2 ] , the convolved h@xmath1  absorption model with these values is shown , and the total model overplotted on the data near the  lines . at lower column densities",
    ", the contours of @xmath23 are complicated by the presence of a local minimum in addition to the absolute minimum , which is why we set the limits more conservatively from the @xmath48 contour rather than the typical @xmath49 contour .",
    "the upper limit on the total line - of - sight h@xmath1  column density toward au  mic  is @xmath50 ; we did not assume a gas temperature to get this limit . if one assumes that the h@xmath1  energy levels are thermally populated and fixes the gas temperature at any value below a few thousand k , the total upper limit decreases .    from sub - mm observations ,",
    "@xcite placed a @xmath49 upper limit on the co column density in the au  mic  disk of @xmath51  @xmath3 , assuming any gas was in thermal equilibrium with the observed dust ( @xmath52  k ) . using a  ratio of @xmath53 , this corresponded to a total h@xmath1   column density of @xmath54  @xmath3 .",
    "the  value is unusually low compared to the typical is value , since the authors tried to take into account the fact that the au  mic  disk is optically thin to is uv photons . to convert this column density from emission observations to a line - of - sight absorption column",
    ", we divided the sub - mm upper limit by 2 .",
    "this gives the lowest possible value , by assuming that the radial density distribution of the gas is extremely centrally peaked .",
    "our @xmath23 contours show that the sub - mm upper limit on the line - of - sight h@xmath1  column density is ruled out at the @xmath55 level for all @xmath40 .",
    "such a large column density would dramatically suppress the   @xmath17 emission line and completely obliterate both   emission lines ( see figure  [ fig : fuse ] ) .",
    "our upper limit in the previous paragraph is 18.5 times lower than the sub - mm upper limit , does not assume a gas temperature , and is free from the large uncertainties introduced by assuming a  ratio .      the fact that the _ fuse _   emission lines are narrower than the stis lines suggests there is a small amount of h@xmath1  absorption toward au  mic .",
    "the minimization with fixed @xmath56 described above showed a second minimum in the @xmath23 contours at h@xmath1  column densities about an order of magnitude below our @xmath48 upper limits .",
    "in addition , there have been claims of weak fluorescent h@xmath1  emission lines in the _ fuse _  and stis spectra @xcite ; however , these lines are only detected at the @xmath57 level .",
    "we attempted to detect line - of - sight h@xmath1  absorption by performing @xmath23 minimization with all parameters free , including @xmath56 .",
    "these contours showed a minimum at large @xmath56 and column densities a few orders of magnitude below the upper limits in ",
    "[ sub : upper ] .",
    "but as before , there were multiple minima in the @xmath23 contours , indicating there are multiple sets of parameters producing h@xmath1  models which fit the data about equally well . therefore , the model is overdetermined given the quality of the data .",
    "but taken at face value , our analysis indicates that the putative line - of - sight h@xmath1  absorption is broad and blueshifted with respect to the star , as was the line - of - sight absorption in the stis data .",
    "@xcite measured a sub - mm dust mass of @xmath58 within 70  au of au  mic .",
    "their upper limit on the h@xmath1  mass ( @xmath59 ) gives a limit on the h@xmath1-to - dust ratio of @xmath4  118:1 .",
    "our limit on the line - of - sight h@xmath1  column density reduces the possible gas mass by at least a factor of 18.5 , giving an upper limit on the h@xmath1-to - dust ratio of @xmath4  6:1 .",
    "the typical is ratio is 100:1 ; therefore , the h@xmath1  gas in the au  mic  disk has been depleted relative to the dust .",
    "the primordial gas is largely dissipated , and the gas lifetime was less than about 12  myr .",
    "@xcite showed that a core massive enough to gravitationally accrete a large gaseous envelope could not form within 10  myr around a @xmath60 star .",
    "the only way current core - accretion scenarios can form a giant planet around an m - star is if its primordial gas survives much longer than about 10  myr .",
    "therefore , it is unlikely that a giant planet could form around au  mic   through these scenarios .",
    "there is indirect evidence of a giant planet around au  mic , since the central region of the disk is cleared of dust grains @xcite and the disk appears slightly warped in the _",

    "this indicates that the primordial gas lifetimes in the two systems were both quite short , despite the very different stellar masses and luminosities ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "there is no o or b star in the @xmath0  pic  moving group , so the short lifetimes are not easily explained by external irradiation . given their spectral types ,",
    "photoevaporation by the central stars seems unlikely to produce short gas lifetimes in both systems .",
    "other possible dissipation mechanisms include stellar winds , magnetospheric accretion , and planet formation .",
    "our observation of broad , blueshifted line - of - sight  absorption ( and possibly h@xmath1 ) would lead one to suspect that there is outflowing , low - ionization gas near the star , possibly in a stellar or disk wind .",
