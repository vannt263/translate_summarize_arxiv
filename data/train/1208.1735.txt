    "with the discovery of high - temperature superconductivity in layered iron containing compounds ( iron pnictides ) @xcite , a new system of phases was added to the study of unconventional superconductivity . since the understanding of the phenomenon of high-@xmath0  superconductivity is still limited , the question of the differences and similarities towards other high-@xmath0  compounds such as the cuprates arises@xcite .",
    "the cuprates as well as many iron pnictides become superconducting by doping of a non - superconducting antiferromagnetic `` parent '' compound . whereas the superconductivity in the cuprates is believed to originate from the mott - insulator properties of the `` parent '' compound",
    ", the iron pnictides do not exhibit this electronic correlation .",
    "however , a common feature is the antiferromagnetic ordering , which has to be suppressed to achieve superconductivity and is thus considered significant .",
    "iron pnictides , such as @xmath1feaso , ( @xmath1 = rare - earth metal ) and @xmath2fe@xmath3as@xmath3 ( @xmath2 = ca , sr , ba , and eu ) , show antiferromagnetic transitions accompanied by structural distortions from tetragonal to orthorhombic symmetry upon cooling .",
    "while the structrual transition and the magnetic ordering occur simultaneously in @xmath2fe@xmath3as@xmath3@xcite , the structural transition in @xmath1feaso compounds is observed at slightly higher temperatures than the magnetic ordering@xcite .",
    "the @xmath1feaso room - temperature phases of zrcusias - type structure ( space - group type @xmath4 ) undergo a _ translationengleiche _ transition of index 2 to the low - temperature structure with space - group type @xmath5@xcite ( fig .",

    "@xmath6 ) .",
    "the displacement ellipsoids represent @xmath7% probability .",
    "solid lines between iron atoms indicate shortest fe - fe distance , dashed lines are slightly longer .",
    "@xmath8 is the height of gadolinium ions above the oxygen layer , @xmath9 is the height of the arsenic ions above the iron layer , and @xmath10 is the as - fe - as angle with the angle bisector parallel to the @xmath11-direction .",
    "[ fig : unitcell ] ]    a similar transition occurs in the @xmath2fe@xmath3as@xmath3 compounds ( @xmath12 to @xmath13 ) .",
    "et  al_.@xcite and blomberg _",
    "et  al_.@xcite studied the formation of lamellar transformation twins by single - crystal x - ray  diffraction of @xmath2fe@xmath3as@xmath3 and the influence of the domain structure on the anisotropy of the resistivity in directions of the basal plane . due to the analogous mechanism of the structural transition for @xmath1feaso ,",
    "the question arises , if the twin formation is similar to @xmath2fe@xmath3as@xmath3 .    here , we present the first single - crystal x - ray  diffraction study of the structural evolution and the twin formation of @xmath1feaso compounds with gdfeaso as representative .",
    "doped gdfeaso has one of the highest @xmath0  ( @xmath14k ) in this class of superconductors@xcite , which has been associated with the vanishing distortion of the feas@xmath15 tetrahedra@xcite .",
    "this concept has been the starting point of an ongoing investigation on the structural changes associated with the transition to the superconducting phase and its physical implications .",
    "preparation and characterization of the crystal used for single - crystal synchrotron x - ray  diffraction has been described elsewhere@xcite .",
    "diffraction data for this study were recorded with a @xmath16 mm mar - ccd detector mounted on a huber four - circle diffractometer at beamline d3 at desy .",
    "the measurements were performed in the temperature range of @xmath17@xmath18k using an open flow oxford diffraction helijet cryostat .",
    "@xmath19-scans were recorded with an increment of  @xmath20 , a detector distance of @xmath21 mm , and a wavelength of @xmath22 . the detector distance and the wavelength",
    "were refined by comparing the experimental lattice parameters of a standard corundum single - crystal to literature data .",
    "the raw frames from the mar - ccd detector were converted using the apexii suite@xcite .",
    "integration and corrections for oblique incidence and polarization were performed within saint+@xcite . for data reduction and absorption correction sadabs@xcite",
    "the structures were solved and refined with shelxs and shelxl@xcite .",
    "details concerning the structure analysis of gdfeaso at different temperatures can be obtained from the fachinformationszentrum karlsruhe@xcite .",
    "when cooling below the temperature of the structural transition , @xmath23k , splitting of reflections at high diffraction angles was observed in the synchrotron experiment . to assess the metric distortion during the structural transition , a program was written in matlab@xcite , that allows reconstruction of planes of the reciprocal space with high lateral resolution ( fig .",

    "plane in monoclinic indexing of gdfeaso at @xmath24k .",
    "_ inset _ : magnification of the @xmath25 reflections.[fig : splitting ] ]    the metric distortion of the structure is the only degree of freedom generated by the structural transition . a model has been developed , which allows to determine the metrical distortion from the observed splitting of reflections . for convinient comparison of the tetragonal ( indicated by subscript t ) and orthorhombic ( subscipt o ) structures ,",
    "the @xmath26-centered orthorhombic cell is transformed into a monoclinic ( subscript m ) primitive cell ( upper right panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : domains ] ) by @xmath27 the distortion of the structure is then defined by the angle @xmath28 ( i.e. @xmath29 in reciprocal space ) .",
    "+     the twin domains join in common planes that are indexed @xmath30 and @xmath31 in the c - centered cell , i.e. @xmath32 and @xmath33 in the primitive cell .",
    "thus four different orientations of the domains in the low - temperature phase result . in the diffraction pattern fourfold splitting of reflections in general positions can be observed , especially at higher diffraction angles ( inset in fig .",
    "[ fig : splitting ] ) .",
    "the position vectors @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 of the reflections belonging to the four domains can be derived from their common center @xmath38 and the distortion angle @xmath39 ( fig .  [",
    "fig : domains ] ) by @xmath40    blomberg _ et  al_.@xcite detwinned bafe@xmath3as@xmath3 crystals by tensile stress and showed that the relative positions of the reflections is dependent on the domain fractions . if , for example , the domain fraction of d4 in fig .",
    "[ fig : domains ] increases , the orientation of the two sets of domains changes towards each other . in the geometrical model described here ,",
    "the correlation of the reflection positions to their intensity is achieved by linear scaling of the transformations shown above .",
    "this approximation is acceptable due to the small differences of the intensities and the local fit of the reflections . in summary ,",
    "the positions of the reflections are constrained to their common center @xmath41 of all the four reflections , the monoclinic distortion angle @xmath39 , and the intensities of the reflections .",
    "this enables the parameter refinement of overlapping reflections .    to quantify the distortion , an algorithm was written in matlab to fit the splitted reflections by a linear combination of four elliptical 2d - lorentz ( cauchy ) functions ( concerning multivariate t - distributions see ref .",
    ", 2d - gaussian fit of neutron data see refs .  ) .",
    "a lorentzian type profile function was chosen empirically by investigating 1d - sections of the 2d - distribution ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : slice ] ) .",
    "reflection in @xmath42 plane .",
    "_ inset _ : 1d - section of the 2d - distribution as indicated by the black line in the contour plot.[fig : slice ] ]    the fitting parameters were the center of the splitted reflections @xmath43 , the distortion angle ( @xmath39 ) , the ellipticity of the reflections , the width of the 2d - lorentz distributions , and the individual intensities of the reflections .    for the structural investigation @xmath44 reflections of each measurement , exhibiting reflection splitting , were fitted to obtain an average distortion angle @xmath39 and a corresponding standard deviation .",
    "the reflection data were integrated with a tetragonal cell since splitting was not wide enough to perform multidomain integration . using the tetragonal lattice parameters , which correspond to @xmath45 , and the obtained distortion angle ,",
    "the orthorhombic lattice parameters were obtained by @xmath46    all reflections could be fitted with this model .",
    "no signs for a deviation from the low - temperature orthorhombic structure towards true monoclinic symmetry was observed .",
    "furthermore , no superstructure reflections could be identified in the reconstructed images of the reciprocal space .",
    "this confirms the tetragonal to orthorhombic transition established by powder diffraction@xcite .",
    "the order parameter of the tetragonal to orthorhombic transition is proportional to the spontaneous deformation @xmath47 and can be fitted by a power law ( upper panel in fig .",

    "et  al_.  explained the small critical exponent by an ordering following the two - dimensional ising model of the iron subsystem , which should yield a critical exponent of @xmath57 . in the case of gdfeaso",
    "the structural transition occurs at temperatures above the magnetic transition , which could be the reason for the even lower critical exponent determined , indicating that the structural transition of gdfeaso is close to first order ( concerning multiferroic transformation and the connection to first order phase transition see also refs .  ) .",
    "the structural transition temperature @xmath50k obtained from the fit is lower than determined by luo _",
    "et  al_.@xcite with powder x - raydiffraction and resistivity measurements .",
    "this deviation might be caused by a systematic temperature error from the open flow helium cryostat used for this single - crystal x - ray  diffraction study .",
    "the lattice parameters and the volume of the tetragonal phase ( middle and lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : plots ] ) decrease in the course of cooling . however , there are hints that there is an anomaly just above the structural transition ( e.g. different slope for @xmath11 below @xmath58k ) , as it was also observed for the thermal expansion of gdfeaso by klingeler _",
    "et  al_.@xcite and assigned to a competition of differently ordered phases .",
    "interestingly , the height of the gadolinium atom above the oxygen layer ( @xmath8 in fig .",
    "[ fig : unitcell ] ) remains almost constant over the whole temperature range , while the arsenic atom height over the iron layer ( @xmath9 ) diminishes with decreasing lattice parameter @xmath11 .",

    "note the relation @xmath60 .",
    "lines are guides for the eye , error bars represent @xmath61.[fig : angles ] ]    with its bisector parallel to the @xmath11-direction first increases upon cooling and then becomes almost constant already above the structural transition and does not change much upon further cooling .",
    "this indicates structural fluctuations by softening of the lattice or vibrational modes above the structural distortion which is also mirrored in other properties ( e.g. thermal expansion@xcite and x - rayreflection broadening@xcite ) . the angles with the angle bisector parallel @xmath62 and @xmath63 do not exhibit this anomaly and merely differentiate corresponding to the tetragonal to orthorhombic transition .    although , the overall structural changes upon cooling are subtle , they indicate a response of the structure already at temperatures above the onset of the metric distortion .",
    "it is clear that higher resolution of the structural investigations is needed to further study the interplay of structure and physical properties of both the `` parent '' and superconducting phases .",
    "a geometrical model was developed for single - crystal synchrotron x - ray  diffraction measurements to quantify the metric distortion and twin formation of gdfeaso induced by the tetragonal to orthorhombic structural transition .",
    "subtle changes in the structure are detectable .",
    "fitting the spontaneous deformation by a power law lead to a small critical exponent of @xmath64 , which is lower than expected for a two - dimensional ising model , pointing towards a transition close to first order .",
    "this may be caused by the separation of the magnetic and the structural transition in temperature .",
    "the lattice parameters decrease with decreasing temperature , and the @xmath65 and @xmath66 axes differentiate at temperatures below the structural transition .",
    "the deformation is abrupt and preceeded by a stagnation of the decrease of the cell parameters .",
    "this indicates long - range fluctuations of the lattice or softening of a vibrational mode at temperatures above the structural transition , which were also observed by other methods ( e.g.  ref .  ) .",
    "if this feature is linked to the superconductivity is not yet clear .",
    "although the presented structural information from single - crystal x - raydiffraction show the subtle structural changes around the tetragonal to orthorhombic phase transition , data with higher resolution is needed to unreavel more details of the interplay of the structure and properties of the `` parent '' compounds of iron - based superconductivity .",
