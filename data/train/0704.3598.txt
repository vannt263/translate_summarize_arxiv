    "a variety of new effects and novel devices have been reported during recent years in the context of the emerging field of spintronics.@xcite one of the most challenging milestones in this context is the development of a quantum computer , which would represent a great breakthrough in the processing time of certain mathematical and physical problems.@xcite in particular , the electron spin in quantum dots has been proposed as a building block for the implementation of quantum bits ( qubits ) for quantum computation.@xcite an important recent development is the possibility to coherently control electron states and electron spin in quantum dot systems with a precision up to a single - electron , thus demonstrating the feasibility of qubit implementation in a solid state system.@xcite specifically , these experimental realizations use high - speed voltage pulses to tune the system levels in a coherent cycle for electronic manipulation .",
    "ac - driven quantum dot systems and double barrier structures have also been studied in the context of quantum pumps,@xcite superlattices,@xcite kondo effect,@xcite and spin - polarized transport.@xcite in addition to this , time - dependent transport has received growing attention in a variety of mesoscopic systems that encompasses , to mention but a few , molecular electronics,@xcite dissipative driven mesoscopic ring,@xcite noisy qubits,@xcite and dynamical franz - keldysh effect.@xcite    in the context of spintronics a system of particular interest is composed of a quantum dot or a metallic island coupled via tunnel barriers to two ferromagnetic leads ( fm - qd - fm ) .",
    "for example , in the nonequilibrium regime the following effects have been discussed : a spin - split kondo resonance,@xcite a spin - current diode effect,@xcite zero - bias anomaly,@xcite tunnel magnetoresistance ( tmr ) oscillations,@xcite negative tmr , @xcite spin accumulation,@xcite and so on . in spite of all this activity , to the best of our knowledge , only very little work has been done on spin - polarized transport driven by ac - bias voltages.@xcite here we study transient spin - resolved currents , occupations and tmr generated by a voltage pulse applied in one of the ferromagnetic leads .",
    "we use two complementary approaches to study the problem : nonequilibrium green function ( negf ) and the master equation ( me ) .",
    "negf is used to give an exact solution in the noninteracting case , while the me , valid in the limit @xmath0 ( @xmath1 is the characteristic level width ) , is used to demonstrate that the results obtained via negf are modified only quantitatively , not qualitatively , when coulomb interaction is accounted in the sequential - tunneling limit .",
    "both parallel ( p ) and antiparallel ( ap ) magnetization alignments are considered . in the p case",
    "we find a magnitude and sign modulation of the spin accumulation in the dot , while in the ap alignment only the magnitude changes .",
    "for the current we observe a spike of spin polarized current in the emitter lead when the system operates in the p configuration .",
    "this effect gives rise to a _ dynamical negative - tmr _ just after the bias voltage is turned off .",
    "the paper is organized as follow . in sec .",
    "ii we describe the formulation based on negf , and give explicit formulas for the noninteracting case . in sec .",
    "iii(a)-(c ) we present numerical results based on sec .",
    "ii , and in sec .",
    "iii(d ) we apply the master equation technique to account coulomb interaction effects ( in the sequential tunneling limit ) . finally , in sec .",
    "iv we give some final remarks .",
    "to describe the system of a quantum dot coupled to two ferromagnetic leads , see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , we apply the following hamiltonian @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a time - dependent free - electron energy with wave vector @xmath4 and spin @xmath5 in lead @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) . this energy can also be written as @xmath8 , with @xmath9 being the time - independent energy and @xmath10 gives the time evolution of the external bias .",
    "the energy @xmath11 is the time - dependent spin - degenerate dot level , which can also be written as @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the time - independent level and @xmath14 follows the bias voltage .",
    "it should be noted that in a quantitative theory one should consider a level - shift @xmath15 , which depends on the level occupation , via some suitable self - consistent procedure .",
    "we shall address this issue in our future work , but for the present purpose the simple model suffices .",
    "the operator @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) is an annihilation ( creation ) operator for a single - particle momentum state @xmath4 and spin @xmath5 in lead @xmath6 ( @xmath18 ) , and @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) is an annihilation ( creation ) operator for the single - particle dot s state @xmath21 .",
    "the matrix element @xmath22 couples the leads with the dot , and we assume that the tunneling process is spin - independent . finally , the @xmath23-term describes the coulomb repulsion in the dot , with @xmath24 .    in order to calculate the current we use the definition @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the electron charge ( @xmath27 ) and @xmath28 is the total number of electrons with spin @xmath5 in lead @xmath6 . from this definition",
    "it is straightforward to show that@xcite @xmath29 where @xmath30,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath31 being the retarded ( lesser ) green function of the dot and @xmath32 is the time - independent fermi distribution function of lead @xmath6 . substituting eq .",
    "( [ glesser ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ iseta ] ) and following ref .",
    "[ ] we find @xmath33\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath34 .",
    "these results are exact , and they can in principle be used to study the intricate interplay between time - dependence , coherence and interactions .",
    "their use , however , requires the knowledge of @xmath35 and @xmath36 , which come from the solution of the nonequilibrium dyson and keldysh equations , respectively . for our main findings , though",
    ", it is sufficient to consider a non - interacting model , for which an exact solution can be obtained . next , in sec .",
    "3d , we show that our results change only slightly when coulomb interaction is included in a master equation based scheme .    in the wideband limit ( wbl),@xcite and for noninteracting electrons eq .",

    "( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , and assuming that this pulse is applied on the right ferromagnetic lead , with a linear bias drop along the junction , we have @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 .    with these definitions ,",
    "we find for @xmath48@xcite @xmath49 and for @xmath50 we obtain @xmath51 by substituting eqs .",
    "( [ a1 ] ) and ( [ a2 ] ) into eqs .",
    "( [ iseta3])-([nst ] ) yields the final result for the spin - resolved occupations and currents .",
    "numerical results are described in the next section .",
    "in our numerical calculations we assume that the voltage pulse is applied to the right electrode , so that @xmath52 while @xmath53 is kept constant equal zero . the dot s level is taken originally ( zero bias ) above the chemical potentials @xmath53 and @xmath54 , @xmath55 mev .",
    "the temperature is assumed to be @xmath56 @xmath57ev ) , thus allowing a small thermally excited occupation of the dot in equilibrium . to describe the ferromagnetism of the leads we choose the tunneling rates to be @xmath58 $ ] and @xmath59 $ ] , where @xmath1 is the leads - dot coupling strength and @xmath60 gives the polarization degree of the leads.@xcite here we assume a weak coupling with @xmath61 @xmath62ev,@xcite and a polarization degree @xmath63 .",
    "the @xmath64 and @xmath65 signs in @xmath66 give the parallel and antiparallel configurations , respectively .",
    "due to the ferromagnetism of the leads ( @xmath67 ) we have @xmath68 and @xmath69 in the parallel case and the opposite @xmath70 in the antiparallel alignment . for the bias voltage",
    "we adopt @xmath71 where @xmath72 mev and @xmath73 ns.@xcite the charging energy @xmath23 is set equal to zero in sec .",
    "iii(b)-(c ) and equal to 3 mev in sec .",
    "iii(d ) .      figure [ fig2 ] shows the spin - resolved occupations @xmath74 and @xmath75 and the spin accumulation @xmath76 as a function of time for both ( a ) parallel and ( b ) antiparallel configurations .",
    "before the bias is turned on the level @xmath21 is above the electrochemical potentials @xmath77 ( @xmath18 ) , and the dot is only slightly occupied due to thermal excitation .",
    "when the bias is turned on at @xmath78 the dot s level is brought into resonance ( @xmath79 ) , thus resulting in an enhancement of @xmath80 and @xmath81 . in the parallel case [ fig . [ fig2](a ) ] the spin up population increases faster than the spin down one , and both attain the same stationary value around 0.5 . the steeper enhancement of @xmath74 compared to @xmath75 is related to the inequality @xmath82 , that gives a faster response for the spin @xmath83 component . since @xmath84 in the p case , the in- and out - tunnel rates compensate each other , thus resulting in @xmath85 for asymptotic times .",
    "when the bias voltage is turned off , @xmath21 raises above @xmath53 and @xmath54 and the population of the dot begins to decay , with a faster discharge for the @xmath83 component .",
    "the spin accumulation reflects the dynamics of @xmath74 and @xmath75 . in the range @xmath48",
    ", @xmath81 reaches a local maximum due to the faster enhancement of @xmath74 compared to @xmath75 .",
    "in contrast , when the bias voltage is turned off ( @xmath50 ) , @xmath81 shows a local ( negative ) minimum due to the fast discharge of @xmath74 .    in figure [ fig2](b )",
    "we show the evolution of the occupations and the spin accumulation in the antiparallel alignment .",
    "we note that @xmath74 increases faster than @xmath75 as in the p case .",
    "in contrast , though , @xmath74 attains a higher value than @xmath75 in the stationary regime .",
    "this is related to the out - tunnel rates which are now inverted with respect to the parallel case : @xmath70 . when the bias is turned off both @xmath74 and @xmath75 decrease due to the transient discharge . in particular the spin up electron population discharges predominantly to the left lead while the spin down component discharges to the right , following their corresponding majority density of states ( or equivalently the majority tunnel rates ) .",
    "the way how spins @xmath83 and @xmath86 charge and discharge are more clearly seen in the spin - resolved current curves described in the next section .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows @xmath87 and @xmath88 for both leads and both ferromagnetic alignments . in the p configuration [ fig . [ fig3](a ) ] the left currents @xmath89 and @xmath90 show a transient suppression and then attain their respective stationary values with @xmath91 . in the right lead the currents @xmath92 and @xmath93 increase ( in modulus ) up to their respective stationary values .",
    "when the bias voltage is turned off @xmath94 becomes negative as @xmath95 .",
    "the negative sign of both @xmath94 and @xmath95 means that the electrons are flowing from the dot to the leads ( discharge ) .",
    "in particular the spin @xmath86 electrons discharge much slower than the @xmath83 ones , due to @xmath96 .    in the ap configuration [ fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) ] @xmath89 and @xmath90 show a suppression just after the bias voltage is turned on , then they attain a stationary value with @xmath97 . in the right lead the currents @xmath92 and @xmath93 are enhanced until they reach equal plateaus . when the bias voltage is turned off , @xmath89 and @xmath90 change sign ( discharge of the dot ) and a _ spike _ of spin @xmath83 current in seen in the left lead ( @xmath98 ) .",
    "this reflects the preferential discharge of spin up electrons to the left lead , according to @xmath99 .",
    "no spike is seen in the parallel configuration , where spin up electrons discharge equally to both leads .",
    "in contrast , in the ap alignment the spin down electrons discharge preferentially to the right lead due to the inverted inequality @xmath100 , while in the p case its discharge is equally to both sides ( @xmath101 ) .",
    "_ negative tmr_. in figure ( [ fig4 ] ) we show the total current in the left lead ( @xmath102 ) for both parallel and antiparallel configurations . due to the strong spin - polarized discharge ( @xmath103 ns ) in the left lead",
    "when the system is ap aligned , the total current obeys the unusual inequality @xmath104 , which results in _ time - dependent negative tunnel magnetoresistance _ ( see inset ) , defined as @xmath105 .",
    "as the time evolves the tmr keeps increasing , due to the longer spin - down lifetimes when the system is parallel aligned .",
    "more specifically , in the ap configuration both spin up and down discharge fast to the left and to the right leads , respectively , following their majority spin populations ( or equivalently the tunneling rates ) .",
    "in contrast , in the p alignment the majority populations occur for spin up in both leads ( @xmath106 ) .",
    "this turns into a fast discharge for spin up electrons and a slow discharge for the down component .",
    "this slow spin down discharge sustains the total current much longer than in the ap configuration , and eventually for long enough times we find @xmath107 .",
    "_ displacement current_. in the transient regime the left and the right currents are not in general the same ( @xmath108 ) , due to charge accumulation / depletion in the dot .",
    "the generalized conservation law is given by the continuity equation @xmath109 , where @xmath110 is the displacement current for spin @xmath5 , given by @xmath111 . in order to check the accuracy of our numerical calculation we have verified numerically the continuity equation .",
    "an exact treatment of the coulomb interaction represents a formidable problem , and in the context of the present hamiltonian only few results are known _ in equilibrium _ , and none in nonequilibrium , even less so under transient conditions . nevertheless , in certain limits",
    "approximate treatments may give a good qualitative understanding of the generic behavior .",
    "one such case is the sequential - tunneling limit ( @xmath112 ) , where the master equation ( me ) approach is known to work well . here",
    ", we use the me to estimate the effects of coulomb interaction in our results.@xcite the current expression is given by@xcite @xmath113,\\ ] ] where @xmath114 , @xmath115 and @xmath116 , are the probabilities to have no electron , one electron with spin @xmath5 and two electrons , respectively .",
    "the fermi functions @xmath117 and @xmath118 are evaluated at @xmath21 and @xmath119 , respectively .",
    "for the dot s occupation we write @xmath120,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and for the double occupancy probability we have @xmath121.\\ ] ]    for the noninteracting case ( @xmath122 ) the time - dependent results obtained from eq .",
    "( [ imastereq ] ) are identical to those seen in sec .",
    "iii(b)-(c ) . for the interacting case ( @xmath123 ) ,",
    "we find that for @xmath124 mev the results are indistinguishable from the @xmath122 case [ see fig . [ fig5 ] ] .",
    "this is so because for small enough @xmath23 both channels @xmath21 and @xmath119 attain resonance for @xmath125 mev .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath126 mev the channel @xmath119 remains above the emitter chemical potential when the bias voltage is applied , which turns into a suppression of the occupations and the currents . in particular in the ap configuration this suppression is stronger upon the spin down component , seen in both occupations [ panel ( b ) ] and currents [ panel ( d ) ] .",
    "this is due to the spin imbalance @xmath127 typically present in the antiparallel alignment .",
    "this spin - polarized suppression in the ap configuration gives rise to an enhancement of the spin imbalance [ see fig .",
    "[ fig5](b ) ] and to a spin polarized current @xmath128 in the stationary plateau .    in fig .",
    "( [ fig6 ] ) we see the effects of @xmath23 on the dynamical tmr . for @xmath124 mev the tmr is basically the same as before [ fig .",
    "[ fig4](inset ) ] . for @xmath126",
    "mev the tmr is enhanced ( in modulus ) for both on and off voltage regimes ( @xmath129 ns and @xmath103 ns , respectively ) .",
    "in particular the coulomb interaction turns the tmr even more negative after the bias voltage is turned off , which reaches @xmath130 % around @xmath131 ns for @xmath126 mev .",
    "we predict novel spin - dependent effects in a quantum dot coupled to two ferromagnetic leads driven by a rectangular bias voltage pulse . based on nonequilibrium green function and master equation techniques we calculated the spin - resolved occupations and currents , the spin accumulation and the tunnel magnetoresistance in the transient just after the bias voltage is turned on and off .",
    "our main findings are : ( i ) a sign change of the spin accumulation as the time evolves in the p configuration , ( ii ) a spike of spin @xmath83 current in the emitter lead when the system is antiparallel aligned , and ( iii ) a time - dependent tmr that attains negative values .",
    "this negative amount can be further enhanced due to intradot coulomb interaction .",
