    "in the classical domain physical observables commute with each other and they can all be jointly measured .",
    "in contrast , measurements of observables , which do not commute are usually declared to be _ incompatible _ in the quantum scenario .",
    "however , the notion of _ compatibility _ of measurements is captured entirely by _ commutativity _ of the observables if one restricts only to _",
    "sharp _ projective valued ( pv ) measurements . in an extended framework , which include measurements of _ unsharp _ generalized observables , comprised of positive operator valued measures ( povm ) , the concept of _ joint measurability _ gets delinked from that of commutativity  @xcite . though non - commuting observables do not admit simultaneous _ sharp _ values through their corresponding pv measurements , it is possible to assign _ unsharp _ values jointly to compatible positive operator valued ( pov ) observables .",
    "active research efforts are dedicated  @xcite to explore clear , operationally significant criteria of _ joint measurability _ for two or more povms and also to identify that incompatible measurements , which can not be implemented jointly , are necessary to bring out _ non - classical _ features . in this context , it has already been recognized  @xcite that if one merely confines to local compatible povms on parts of an entangled quantum system , it is not possible to witness non - local quantum features like steering ( the ability to non - locally alter the states of one part of a composite system by performing measurements on another spatially separated part  @xcite ) and violation of bell inequality . more specifically , incompatible measurements are instrumental in bringing to surface the violations of various no - go theorems in the quantum world .    in this work , we investigate the entropic uncertainty relation associated with alice s measurements of a pair of non - commuting discrete observables with @xmath0 outcomes , in the presence of bob s quantum memory  @xcite  by restricting to compatible ( jointly measurable ) povms at bob s end .",
    "we first establish that the sum of entropies of alice s measurement results , when conditioned by the outcomes of compatible _ unsharp _ povms recorded in bob s quantum memory , is constrained to _ obey _ an entropic steering inequality derived in ref .",
    "this essentially brings out the intrinsic equivalence between the violation of an entropic steering inequality and the possiblity of reducing the entropic uncertainty bound of a pair of non - commuting observables with the help of an entangled quantum memory . and",
    "as violation of a steering inequality requires  @xcite that ( i ) the parties share a steerable entangled state and also that ( ii ) the measurements by one of the parties ( bob )  @xcite is incompatible , it becomes evident that information stored in bob s entangled quantum memory is of no use in reducing the uncertainty of alice s pair of non - commuting observables , when bob can measure only compatible povms .",
    "consequently , we prove that the quantum advantage for the construction of security proofs in quantum key distribution ( qkd )  @xcite is lost in the joint measurability regime .",
    "the structure of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we give an overview of generalized pov observables and their joint measurability .",
    "entropic uncertainty relation for alice s pair of discrete observables in the presence of bob s quantum memory is discussed in sec .",

    "we begin by giving an outline of generalized measurement of observables in terms of povms .",
    "a povm is a set @xmath1 of positive self - adjoint operators @xmath2 , called _ effects _ , satisfying @xmath3 ; @xmath4 denotes the identity operator .",

    "if @xmath9 is a set of complete , orthogonal projectors , then the measurement reduces to the special case of pv measurement .",
    "let us consider a collection of pov observables @xmath10 .",

    "if the effects @xmath21 can be constructed in terms of @xmath22 as  @xcite , @xmath23 where @xmath24 are positive numbers satisfying @xmath25 , then the povms @xmath12 are jointly measurable  @xcite .",
    "for all jointly measurable povms , the probability @xmath26 of the outcome @xmath27 in the measurement of @xmath12 can be post processed based on the results of measurement of the grand pov observale @xmath13 : @xmath28=\\sum_\\lambda\\ , p(\\lambda)\\ , p(x_i\\vert i,\\lambda).\\ ] ] more specifically , measurements of compatible povms @xmath12 can be interpreted in terms of a single _ grand _ povm @xmath13 ( i.e. , given the positive numbers @xmath29 , one can construct the probabilities of measuring compatible povms @xmath12 solely based on the results of measurement of @xmath13 ) . an important feature that gets highlighted here",
    "is that the generalized pov observables are jointly measurable even if they do not commute with each other .    reconciling to joint measurability within quantum theory results in subsequent manifestation of classical features  @xcite . in particular , as measurement of a single _ grand _ povm can be used to construct results of measurements of all compatible povms , joint measurability entails a joint probability distribution for all compatible observables ( though for _ unsharp _ values of the observables ) in _ every _ quantum state .",
    "existence of joint probabilities in turn implies that the set of all bell inequalities are satisfied  @xcite , when only compatible measurements are employed .",
