    "an accurate knowledge of the mass distribution within our neighborhood is essential if we are to understand the dynamical evolution of the local group from kinematic studies ( e.g. , peebles et al .",
    "in addition , the discovery of previously unknown nearby galaxies will further efforts to understand the local velocity field ( see kraan - korteweg 1986 and karachentsev et al .",

    "kerr & henning ( 1987 ) demonstrated the power of single - dish h  i surveys in searching for hidden galaxies .",
    "such observations provide not only the two - dimensional location of galaxies on the plane of the sky , but also the redshift .",
    "furthermore , the width of the 21-cm line gives some indication of the mass .",
    " shallow \" surveys are now complete in both the north ( henning et al .",
    "1998 , rivers , henning , & kraan - korteweg 1999 , rivers 2000 ) and the south ( henning et al .",
    "2000 ) , with more sensitive searches in progress .",
    "although no massive local group galaxies have been found lurking behind the galactic disk , the northern survey did reveal a previously unknown spiral galaxy (  dwingeloo 1 \" ) at 3  mpc ( kraan - korteweg et al .",
    "1994 ) , a likely member of the ic  342/maffei group .    here",
    "we report on follow - up observations of a galaxy that is nearly half that distance . in their survey of h  i sources in the southern zoa , henning et al .",
    "( 2000 ) lists object hizss  3 as having a heliocentric radial velocity of only 299 km  s@xmath3 .",
    "improved data ( presented below ) yield a velocity of 280  km  s@xmath3 . given its location relative to the solar apex , this translates to a velocity with respect to the local group of 134 km  s@xmath3 ( following courteau & van den bergh 1999 ) implying a distance of only 1.8  mpc ( @xmath4=75 km  s@xmath3  mpc@xmath3 ) in the absence of any peculiar velocities .",
    "thus , this is one of the nearest galaxies known , similar in distance to the well - known sextans a , sextans b , and gr  8 galaxies , nearby but slightly beyond the zero - velocity envelope that defines the local group ( mateo 1998 , van den bergh 2000 ) .",
    "its location less than 0.1 degrees from the galactic plane has made prior optical identification unlikely ; nothing but foreground stars is seen on the palomar sky survey prints or in the 2mass images at this position .",

    "2000 ) of the 2mass survey .",
    "the properties of this object ( summarized in table  1 ) are strongly suggestive of a dwarf irregular ( dim ) galaxy . the h  i velocity width at 20% peak intensity determined by henning et al .",

    "the galaxy , at galactic coordinates @xmath10 , @xmath11 lies in a region of overlap between the two surveys .",
    "the basic h  i parameters were first published as part of the latter catalog , hence the hizss moniker .",
    "h  i synthesis data were obtained with the vla in 1999 as part of follow - up observations for the dwingeloo project ( rivers 2000 ) .",
    "a 30-minute observation was made in the compact d - array , and the maps were created using natural weighting of the visibilities .",

    "the h  i mass of this galaxy would be @xmath15 m@xmath16 .",
    "the flux recovered with the single - dish parkes survey was slightly higher : 32.1  jy  km  s@xmath3 ( henning et al .",
    "2000 ) , thus yielding a somewhat higher estimated h  i mass , @xmath17 m@xmath16 .",
    "( the slightly higher value is not unexpected , since the parkes measurement was not cut off at the 1 m@xmath16  pc@xmath14 column density level . )",

    "the velocity field , shown in fig .",

    "direct images were taken centered on the center of the vla map with lowell observatory s 1.1-m hall telescope using a site 2048@xmath122048 ccd on ut 8 and 9 april 2003 .",

    "broad - band _ bvri _ images obtained on the first night failed to show anything other than the expanded swarm of foreground galactic stars .",
    "however , an h@xmath1 exposure on the second night clearly showed an extended object about 70 arcsec from the peak of the h  i distribution . in fig .",
    "[ fig : images ] we compare the h@xmath1 image with an @xmath23-band exposure . the h@xmath1 image ( fig .",

    "[ fig : images]b ) is the sum of 15 1-minute exposures , taken in this way to minimize saturation .",
    "the seeing on each frame was approximately 3 arcsecs , due in large part to the high airmass ( @xmath0 ) of the observations .",
    "we also show in fig .",

    "the h@xmath1 source is extended principally nw to se , covering about 12 arcsecs . at a distance of 1.8  mpc",
    ", this corresponds to a diameter of @xmath26100  pc , typical of the ionization region ( strmgren sphere ) of a late o - type star ( spitzer 1968 , with n@xmath27=10 @xmath28 ) were it ionization - bounded .",
    "more likely the region is density bounded ( as is the case with an older , evolved h  ii region ) , and the size is consistent with the smallest first - ranked h  ii regions in irregular galaxies ( see table 2 of youngblood & hunter 1999 ) .",
    "thus it may contain a modest population of ob stars .",
    "the bulge in the h  i contours suggest a partially - resolved h  i cloud , and hence a likely home for star formation .",
    "we were able to calibrate the h@xmath1 image by observing several spectrophotometric standards and by knowing the filter characteristics .",
    "the h@xmath1 flux corresponds to @xmath29 ergs cm@xmath14 s@xmath3 .",
    "if @xmath21  mags , then @xmath31  mags ( savage & mathis 1979 ) , and at a distance of 1.8  mpc the h@xmath1 luminosity would be @xmath32  ergs  s@xmath3 . this value is quite reasonable for the luminosity of the brightest h  ii regions within dwarf irregular galaxies ( youngblood & hunter 1999 ) , and is 14 times the h@xmath1 luminosity of the orion nebula ( kennicutt 1984 ) .",
    "no other h@xmath1 sources were found , either by blinking the frames or by examining a continuum - subtracted version of the h@xmath1 image .    the location and size of the h@xmath1 source is certainly suggestive of being part of hizss  3 .",
    "however , we were concerned that this could instead be a foreground planetary nebula . to settle this matter , we obtained a spectrum of the h@xmath1 source using the kpno 2.1-m telescope and goldcam spectrometer on 17 april 2003 .",
    "we used a 600 line mm@xmath3 grating ( no .  35 ) centered at @xmath33 , giving us coverage from @xmath34 at 1.24  pixel@xmath3 .",
    "a gg400 filter was used to block out any second - order light .",
    "the slit of the spectrograph was rotated to a position angle of 45@xmath8 , near the parallactic angle , and perpendicular to the major extension .",
    "the slit width was set to 100@xmath35 m ( 1.3 arcsec ) and provided 3.3  resolution .",
    "the object was centered by a blind offset from a nearby star , and the exposure was hand - guided .",
    "conditions were marginal , and only one full 1200  s exposure was obtained before the cirrus thickened ; nevertheless , h@xmath1 emission was strongly present at the predicted location , with a signal level of 1500 e@xmath36 .",
    "( a second exposure , terminated by clouds , showed emission at the same place . ) a comparison he - ne - ar exposure was made both before and after the exposure .",
    "the spectrophotometric standard star feige 34 was observed ( through clouds ) to provide _ relative _ flux calibration .",
    "the nebular spectrum was extracted using an exposure of the offset star to serve as a reference for the 2-dimensional mapping of the spectrum on the chip .    the spectrum is shown in fig .  [ fig : spectrum ] .",
    "h@xmath1 is strong , and a weak feature may be [ oiii ] @xmath37 .",
    "the heliocentric radial velocity of h@xmath1 is measured to be 335@xmath38 15 km  s@xmath3 .",
    "this is in substantial agreement with the heliocentric 21-cm velocity map , which suggests a velocity of 300 km  s@xmath3 at that position ( cf .  figs .",
    "[ fig : totalhi ] and [ fig : hivel ] ) , and confirms that the object we ve identified in our h@xmath1 image is associated with hizss  3 .",
    "the fact that the values for the diameter and luminosities of the h  ii region are quite reasonable gives gives additional support to our interpretation .",
    "most recent discoveries of nearby galaxies have been of dwarf spheroid systems which are not presently active in forming stars .",
    "the presence of substantial gas in hizss  3 , as well as a modest - size h  ii region , suggests that this is a dwarf irregular ( dim ) . as such",
    ", it is possibly the nearest dim to be discovered in the past 25 years ; i.e. , since lgc  3 was found by kowal , lo , & sargent ( 1978 ) , and sagdig was found by cesarsky et al .",
    "( 1977 ) and longmore et al .",
    ". both of these are well - established to be local group members .",
    "( for more on the growth of our knowledge of the local group , see van den bergh 2000 . )    however , the properties of hizss  3 are most strongly reminiscent of those of another nearby dim , gr  8 .",
    "this galaxy was first cataloged by reaves ( 1956 ) in a survey of dwarf galaxies seen towards virgo , but hodge ( 1967 ) found it was a much nearer object , possibly even in the local group . gr8",
    "s optical appearance is dominated by a few bright h  ii regions , the largest of which has a diameter of 175  pc ( youngblood & hunter 1999 ) , somewhat greater than the 100  pc found for our h@xmath1 source .",
    "carignan , beaulieu , & freeman ( 1990 ) find an h  i diameter for gr  8 of about 2  kpc , about two - thirds of what we find for hizss  3 .",
    "( we have adjusted these value to the 2.2  mpc distance to gr  8 recommended by van den bergh 2000 , based upon newer distance measurements by tolstoy et al .",
    "1995 and dohm - palmer et al .",
    "1998 using a cepheid and the tip of the red giant branch , respectively . )    could hizss  3 be a member of the local group ?",
    "we have adopted a tentative distance to the galaxy of 1.8  mpc based upon its radial velocity with respect to the local group centroid ( lgc ) of 134  km  s@xmath3 , where we have adopted the solution for the solar apex and solar motion ( with respect to the lgc ) from courteau & van den bergh ( 1999 ) .",
    "this may be compared to sandage s ( 1986 ) solution using more limited data .",
    "sandage s solution is expressed in terms of the motion of the lsr , but transformed to the sun s motion corresponds to a velocity of 296 km s@xmath3 towards @xmath39 .",
    "thus @xmath40 . adopting his solution for hizss  3 would lead to a velocity relative to the lgc of 120 km s@xmath3 , and hence a distance of 1.6  mpc . ] and used a value for the hubble constant @xmath41  km  s@xmath3  mpc@xmath3 .",
    "such a distance would place it well beyond the zero - velocity boundary of the local group .",
    "however , this relies upon the assumption that the hizss  3 has no peculiar velocity . in general",
    ", the velocities of nearby galaxies will be affected by the presence of their neighbors .",
    "however , the galaxies of the local group do show only modest peculiar motions .",
    "yahil , tammann , & sandage ( 1977 ) , sandage ( 1986 ) , and courteau & van den bergh ( 1999 ) , among others , have all found similar solutions for the velocities of the sun with respect to the local group as a whole by minimizing the velocity residuals of well - established local group members . in fig .",
    "[ fig : sandage ] we show the heliocentric radial velocities of local group members ( filled circles ) and that of nearby non - members ( open circles ) as a function of @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the angle from the solar apex .",
    "the solution found by courteau & van den bergh ( 1999 ) is shown by the solid line , and corresponds to a motion of the sun of 306 km s@xmath3 towards @xmath44 .",
    "the 1@xmath45 scatter about this solution is 61 km s@xmath3 , shown by the dashed lines .",
    "hizss  3 lies 134  km  s@xmath3 above the solid line , i.e. , 2.1@xmath45 from the mean relationship .",
    "_ most _ of the galaxies above the @xmath46 ( 1@xmath45 ) dashed lines are non - members ( ngc 3109 , sex a , sex b , gr  8) , but not all : leo  i , in particular , is in a very similar location in this diagram .",
    "measurements of the tip of the red giant branch ( lee et al .",
    "1993 ) however firmly establish the distance of this galaxy as 270  kpc , about one - tenth one would infer from just its velocity .",
    "( the galaxy s peculiar velocity is due to its proximity to the milky way . )",
    "while we do nt expect that hizss  3 to be equally close , as that would be inconsistent with both the properties of the h  ii region and the 21-cm width relative to the h  i flux , its membership in the local group can not be ruled out on the basis of the current data .",
    "we conclude that hizss  3 is unlikely to be a member of the local group based upon its velocity , but emphasize the need for a better distance estimate .",
    "van den bergh ( 2000 ) discusses galaxies on the outer fringes of the local group , and argues that sextans a , sextans b , ngc 3109 , and antlia form the nearest external group of galaxies beyond the local group ( see also van den bergh 1999 ) .",
    "hizss  3 may be at a similar distance and does fall similarly above the lg relation in fig .",

    "we do not know very much about the characteristics of such small groups , and it seems conceivable , but unlikely , that hizss  3 is native to this group .",
    "the identification of other nearby galaxies in this region would be illuminating .",
    "followup observations of hizss  3 are planned for the next observing season . of key interest",
    "will be the detection of its resolved stellar population , identification of other h  ii regions ( if any ) , and the determination of nebular chemical abundances .",
    "( spectroscopy of the nebula potentially will lead to an improved reddening estimate . )",
    "measurements of an accurate distance would best be determined in the infrared from the tip of the red giant branch , as finding cepheids ( which vary most in the blue ) will be greatly hindered by foreground extinction .",
