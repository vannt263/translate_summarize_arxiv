    "quantum channel discrimination is a natural extension of a basic problem in quantum hypothesis testing , that of distinguishing between the possible states of a quantum system . in the case of binary state discrimination",
    ", it is given _ a priori _ that a quantum system is in one of two states @xmath1 or  @xmath2 , and the goal is to identify in which state it is by performing a quantum measurement .",
    "we say that @xmath1 is the null hypothesis and @xmath2 is the alternative hypothesis .",
    "a natural extension of this problem occurs in the independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . ) setting . here",
    ", the discriminator is provided with @xmath3 quantum systems in the state @xmath4 or @xmath5 , and the task is to apply a binary measurement @xmath6 on these @xmath3 systems , with @xmath7 , to determine which state he possesses .",
    "one is then concerned with two kinds of error probabilities:@xmath8 the probability of incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis , the type  i error , and@xmath9 the probability of incorrectly rejecting the alternative hypothesis , the type  ii error . of course , it is generally impossible to find a quantum measurement such that both of these errors are equal to zero simultaneously , so one instead studies the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath10 and @xmath11 as @xmath12 , expecting there to be a trade - off between minimising @xmath10 and minimising @xmath13 .",
    "in asymmetric hypothesis testing , one fixes a constraint on the type  i error , say , and then seeks to minimise the type  ii error .",
    "when a constant threshold @xmath14 is imposed on the type  i error , the optimal type  ii error is given by @xmath15 the central result in the asymptotic setting is the quantum stein s lemma , due to hiai and petz @xcite and ogawa and nagaoka @xcite . the direct part of the lemma states that for any constant bound on the type  i error , there exists a sequence of measurements @xmath6 that meets this constraint and is such that the type  ii error decreases to zero exponentially fast with a decay exponent given by the quantum relative entropy @xmath16 , defined as @xcite @xmath17{cc}\\text{tr}\\left\\ {   \\rho\\left [   \\log\\rho-\\log\\sigma\\right ]   \\right\\ }   & \\text{if supp}\\left (   \\rho\\right )   \\subseteq\\text{supp}\\left (   \\sigma\\right ) \\\\",

    "\\label{eq : vn - rel - ent}\\ ] ] in the above and throughout the paper , we take the logarithm to be base two .",
    "furthermore , the strong converse part of the lemma states that any attempt to make the type  ii error decay to zero with a decay exponent larger than the relative entropy will result in the type  i error converging to one in the large  @xmath3 limit @xcite .",
    "the direct and the strong converse parts can be succinctly written as @xmath18 that is , for any threshold value @xmath19 , the optimal type  ii error decays exponentially fast in the number of copies , and the decay rate is equal to the relative entropy .",
    "it is easy to see that the negative logarithm of the optimal type  ii error , @xmath20 is non - negative and monotonic non - increasing under completely positive trace - preserving maps .",
    "thus , it can be considered as a generalized divergence or generalized relative entropy and it was named hypothesis testing relative entropy  in @xcite . with this notation , stein s lemma can be reformulated as @xmath21    as a refinement of the quantum stein s lemma , one can study the optimal type  i error given that the type  ii error decays with a given exponential speed .",
    "one is then interested in the asymptotics of the optimal type  i error @xmath22 with @xmath23 a constant . in the direct domain ,",
    "when @xmath24 , @xmath25 also decays with an exponential speed , as was shown in @xcite .",
    "the exact decay rate is determined by the quantum hoeffding bound theorem @xcite as @xmath26 where @xmath27 is a quantum rnyi relative entropy , to be defined later , and @xmath28 is the hoeffding divergence of @xmath1 and @xmath2 . on the other hand , in the strong converse domain ,  when @xmath29 , @xmath25 goes to @xmath30 exponentially fast @xcite .",
    "the rate of this convergence has been determined in @xcite in terms of the limit of post - measurement rnyi relative entropies .",
    "a `` single - letter '' expression has been obtained recently in @xcite as @xmath31 where @xmath32 is an alternative version of the quantum rnyi relative entropy @xcite , and @xmath33 is the hoeffding anti - divergence .",
    "note that it is unique to the quantum case that one requires a rnyi relative entropy for the strong converse domain which is different from that used in the direct domain ( however , these rnyi relative entropies coincide when @xmath1 and @xmath2 commute , i.e. , the classical case ) .    the results in and give a complete understanding of the trade - off between the two error probabilities in the asymptotics .",
    "note that the quantum stein s lemma can also be recovered from and in the limit @xmath34 .",
    "we remark that there are other ways of refining our understanding of the quantum stein s lemma , as established recently in @xcite .",
    "the objectives of channel discrimination are very similar to those of state discrimination ; what makes the problem different is the complexity of the available discrimination strategies . in the general setup",
    "we have a quantum channel with input system @xmath35 and output system @xmath36 , and we know that the channel is described by either @xmath37 or @xmath38 , where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are completely positive trace - preserving ( cptp ) maps .",
    "we assume that we can use the channel several times , consecutive uses are independent , and the properties of the channel do not change with time .",
    "thus , @xmath3 uses of the channel are described by either @xmath39 or @xmath40 . a non - adaptive discrimination strategy for @xmath3 uses of the channel",
    "consists of feeding an input state @xmath41 into the @xmath3-fold tensor - product channel , and then performing a binary measurement @xmath42 on the output , which is either @xmath43 or @xmath44 . here",
    ", @xmath45 is an ancilla system on which the channel acts trivially as the identity map @xmath46 .",
    "when an adaptive strategy is used , the output of the first @xmath47 uses of the channel can be used to prepare the input for the @xmath48-th use ; see figure [ figurechanneldiscrim1 ] for a pictorial explanation and section [ sec : channel stein ] for a precise definition .    for any discrimination strategy @xmath49 ,",
    "let @xmath50 and @xmath51 denote the output of the @xmath3-fold product channel depending on whether the channel is equal to @xmath37 or @xmath38 . in analogy with - , one can define the type  i and the type  ii errors as @xmath52 where @xmath42 is the measurement part of the strategy .",
    "it is then natural to consider the optimal error probabilities @xmath53 where @xmath54 denotes the set of allowed discrimination strategies and the optimisations are over all strategies in the class @xmath54 . here",
    ", we will consider @xmath55 for adaptive and @xmath56 for product strategies .",
    "the latter are all non - adaptive strategies with an input state @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is an arbitrary state on @xmath35 and some ancilla @xmath59 . obviously , if only product strategies are allowed ( @xmath60 ) , then the optimal rates of these error probabilities are given by the corresponding channel divergences as @xmath61 according to the previously explained results on state discrimination .",
    "note that in an infimum is taken ; the reason is that , in the strong converse domain , the goal is to minimise the exponent of the success probability .",
    "the hoeffding ( anti-)divergences can also be expressed as @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath64 are the channel rnyi relative entropies : @xmath65 the optimizations in  and  are taken over all possible bipartite states @xmath58 with an arbitrary ancilla system @xmath59 .    for adaptive strategies ,",
    "the relations - are not expected to hold for arbitrary channels .",
    "for instance , the results of @xcite provide some evidence in this direction .",
    "( see  @xcite as well for related results and more general conclusions . )",
    "there are various classes of channels , however , for which - hold ; for these channels , adaptive strategies do not offer any benefit over product strategies .",
    "for instance , hayashi showed - with @xmath55 for any pair of classical channels @xcite .",
    "another extreme case is when both @xmath37 and @xmath38 are replacer channels , i.e. , there exist states @xmath66 such that @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "obviously , in this case all the channel divergences are equal to the corresponding divergences of the two states ; e.g. , @xmath69 , etc .",
    "it is also heuristically clear that adaptive strategies do not offer any benefit over product strategies , and the channel discrimination problem reduces to the state discrimination problem between @xmath1 and @xmath2 , described before .",
    "two of our main results , theorems [ stein ] and [ scrtheorem ] yield as a special case a mathematically precise argument for these heuristics in the case of and .",
    "a natural intermediate step towards determining the error exponents of the general quantum channel discrimination problem is to allow one of the channels to be arbitrary , while keeping the other channel a replacer channel .",
    "this setup interpolates between the fully understood case of state discrimination and the still open problem of general quantum channel discrimination .",
    "here we consider the setup in which the first channel is arbitrary and the second channel is a replacer channel .",
    "we prove ( stein s lemma ) in section [ sec : stein proof ] , and show in section [ sec : sc proof ] that the strong converse exponent is given as in for adaptive strategies ( @xmath55 ) . as for now , we leave the optimality part of open for @xmath55 .    as a consequence of these results , in section [ sec : ea sc proof ]",
    "we can establish a strong converse theorem for the quantum - feedback - assisted capacity of a channel , which is the capacity of a quantum channel for transmitting classical information with the assistance of a noiseless quantum feedback from receiver to sender .",
    "our result here strengthens that of bowen s @xcite .",
    "we also make a connection between our results and quantum illumination @xcite in section [ sec : quantum - illum ] . finally , in section  [ sec : extension ] , we discuss how to combine the recent results in @xcite with ours to obtain a quantum stein s lemma in a setting more general than that considered in either paper .",
    "this gives a novel operational interpretation of the mutual information of a quantum channel , different from that already found in entanglement- and quantum - feedback - assisted communication @xcite .",
    "we also discuss an open question regarding the characterization of the strong converse exponent in this more general setting .",
    "our first result is a generalization of the quantum stein s lemma in ( [ eq : steins - htre ] ) to the setting of adaptive quantum channel discrimination . in particular",
    ", we study the difficulty of discriminating between an arbitrary quantum channel @xmath70 and a replacer  channel @xmath71 that discards its input and replaces it with a fixed state @xmath2 .",
    "an important physical realization of this problem is in quantum illumination @xcite ( discussed more in section  [ sec : quantum - illum ] ) .",
    "we show that a tensor - power strategy is optimal in this case , so that there is no need to consider the most general adaptive strategy ( at least in the asymptotic regime ) .",
    "this can be seen as a quantum stein s lemma for this task ; if one optimises the type  ii error under the constraint that the type  i error is less than some fixed constant @xmath19 , then the optimal type  ii error probability can not decrease to zero exponentially faster than a rate determined by the relative entropy .",
    "otherwise , the type  i error necessarily converges to one .",
    "it is straightforward to employ the direct part of the established quantum stein s lemma from @xcite in order to establish the direct part for our setting .",
    ".,width=576 ]    .,width=576 ]    in more detail , the most general adaptive discrimination strategy is depicted in figures  [ figurechanneldiscrim1 ] and  [ figurechanneldiscrim2 ] .",
    "it consists of a choice of input state @xmath72 , a sequence @xmath73 of adaptive quantum channels , and finally a quantum measurement @xmath74 to decide which channel was applied",
    ". let @xmath75 denote the output state at the end of the adaptive discrimination strategy ( before the final measurement @xmath74 is performed ) when the channel being applied is @xmath71 , and let @xmath76 denote the output state at the end of the adaptive discrimination strategy when the channel being applied is @xmath70 .",
    "let @xmath77 denote the adaptive hypothesis testing relative entropy ,  which generalizes by allowing for an optimization over all possible adaptive strategies used to discriminate between @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "we define it formally as follows:@xmath80 where the infimum is over all measurement operators @xmath81 subject to @xmath82 and@xmath83 all preparation states @xmath72 subject to @xmath84 and tr@xmath85 , and all adaptive quantum channels @xmath86    we can now state our first main result :    [ stein ] let @xmath87 be a fixed constant .",
    "let @xmath88 be an arbitrary quantum channel and let @xmath89 be the replacer quantum channel @xmath90 , for some fixed density operator @xmath91",
    ". then the channel version of stein s lemma , holds , i.e. , @xmath92 for any @xmath19 .",
    "it suffices to take system @xmath59 isomorphic to system @xmath35 in the above optimization .",
    "this theorem clearly generalizes the quantum stein s lemma in ( [ eq : steins - htre ] ) .",
    "it implies that a tensor - power discrimination strategy is optimal  allowing for an adaptive strategy yields no asymptotic improvement .",
    "that is , one should simply prepare @xmath3 copies of the bipartite state @xmath58 optimizing ( [ eq : adaptive - steins ] ) , send each @xmath35 system through each channel use  ( creating the state @xmath93   ^{\\otimes n}$ ] or @xmath94   ^{\\otimes n}$ ] ) , and finally perform a collective measurement on all systems @xmath95 to decide which channel was applied .",
    "next , we refine our analysis by identifying the strong converse exponent for the task of discriminating between an arbitrary quantum channel @xmath70 and a replacer channel @xmath71 .",
    "it is easy to see ( by considering @xmath96 ) that theorem [ stein ] implies that for any rate @xmath97 , there exists a sequence of non - adaptive strategies , along which the type i error goes to zero , and the type ii error vanishes exponentially fast , with a rate at least @xmath98 .",
    "this is usually referred to as the direct part of stein s lemma .",
    "moreover , it also implies that the strong converse property holds , i.e. , for any sequence of adaptive srategies , if the type ii error vanishes exponentially with a rate @xmath99 , then the type i error goes to @xmath30 ( this can be seen by taking @xmath100 ) .",
    "our aim is to determine the speed of convergence of the type i error to @xmath30 in the strong converse domain , for any decay rate @xmath99 of the type ii errors . as it turns out , this convergence is also exponential , and hence our aim is to determine the exact values of the strong converse exponents : @xmath101 where the infimum is over all sequences of adaptive measurement strategies , specified by measurement operators @xmath81 subject to @xmath82 , preparation states @xmath72 , and adaptive quantum channels @xmath102}\\equiv\\left\\ {   \\mathcal{a}_{r_{i}b_{i}\\rightarrow r_{i+1}a_{i+1}}^{\\left (   i\\right )   } \\right\\ }   _ { i\\in\\left\\ {   1,\\ldots , n-1\\right\\ }   } .\\ ] ]    we establish the following theorem :    [ scrtheorem ] let @xmath88 be an arbitrary quantum channel , and let @xmath103 be the replacer quantum channel @xmath104 , for some fixed density operator @xmath91 .",

    "moreover , the same identities hold when the infima are restricted to pure states @xmath58 with @xmath59 being a fixed copy of @xmath35 .",
    "when @xmath107 , the above statement is empty . on the other hand ,",
    "when @xmath108 is finite , then theorem 2 also holds for @xmath109 in a trivial way .",
    "indeed , by theorem [ stein ] , if @xmath110 then the operational quantities in are equal to @xmath111 , and so is , since @xmath112 for every @xmath113 , according to lemma [ mi limits ] .",
    "our results have implications for the theory of quantum illumination , which we discuss briefly here .",
    "building on prior work in @xcite , lloyd _ et al_.  show how the use of entangled photons can provide a significant improvement over unentangled light when detecting the presence of an object @xcite .",
    "the goal in quantum illumination is to determine whether a distant object is present or not by employing quantum light along with a quantum detection strategy .",
    "it is sensible and traditional @xcite  to take the object not being present as the null hypothesis and the object being present as the alternative hypothesis .    in the usual scenario ,",
    "the transmitter and receiver are in the same location .",
    "the protocol begins with the transmitter sending a signal mode that is entangled with an idler mode still in the possession of the transmitter .",
    "let @xmath114 denote the state of the signal and idler mode .",
    "if the object is not present ( the null hypothesis ) , then the signal mode is lost and is replaced by a thermal state  @xmath115 , so that the joint state becomes @xmath116 . clearly , this is an instance of the replacer channel .",
    "if the object is present ( the alternative hypothesis ) , then the signal beam is reflected off the object and returns to the transmitter .",
    "the resulting state is described by @xmath117 , where @xmath118 describes the noise characteristics of the reflection channel .",
    "this protocol is performed @xmath3 times with the receiver storing either the state @xmath119",
    "^{\\otimes n}$ ] or @xmath120 ^{\\otimes n}$ ] .",
    "the receiver finally performs a collective measurement on all of the systems in order to decide whether the object is present .",
    "thus , we have a quantum channel discrimination problem in which one seeks to distinguish between a replacer channel and a noisy channel .",
    "however , our results do not apply to this setting if one takes the null and alternative hypotheses in the natural way suggested above .",
    "an alternative scenario is that in which the transmitter and receiver are in different locations .",
    "it is technologically more challenging to take advantage of quantum illumination in this setting , due to the fact that the transmitter and receiver need to share and store entanglement over a potentially large distance .",
    "nevertheless , this is the setting to which our results apply . given that the null hypothesis in this setting corresponds to the object not being present , the channel applied to the transmitted mode will be @xmath0 , which characterizes the optical loss in the transmission .",
    "since the alternative hypothesis in this setting corresponds to the object being present and such an object will reflect the light incident on it , the signal beam does not make it to the receiving end and the receiver instead detects thermal noise , so that the channel applied to the transmitted mode is the replacer channel @xmath121 .",
    "thus , the type  i and type  ii errors for this setting correspond to our setting described in the previous sections .",
    "implicit in prior analyses on quantum illumination is the assumption that a tensor - power , non - adaptive strategy is optimal .",
    "our results support this assumption ( at least in the particular setting of asymmetric hypothesis testing described above ) by showing that no asymptotic advantage is provided by instead using an adaptive strategy for quantum channel discrimination .",
    "it remains an open question to determine if a tensor - power , non - adaptive strategy is optimal in the symmetric hypothesis testing setting considered in @xcite .",
    "there is a well - known connection between hypothesis testing and channel coding , first recognized by blahut @xcite , and this connection also holds for quantum channels .",
    "the direct part of the channel coding theorem ( i.e. , the holevo - schumacher - westmoreland theorem ) @xcite can be obtained from the direct part of stein s lemma , as shown in @xcite .",
    "one consequence of theorem  [ stein ] is a strong converse theorem for the quantum - feedback - assisted classical capacity of a quantum channel . in prior work",
    ", bowen proved that a noiseless quantum feedback channel does not increase the entanglement - assisted capacity @xcite of a noisy channel , by proving a weak converse for its quantum - feedback - assisted capacity @xcite .",
    "that is , bowen proved that the quantum - feedback - assisted capacity of a channel @xmath0 is equal to its entanglement - assisted capacity , denoted by@xmath122 however , bowen s result did not exclude the possibility of a trade - off between the communication rate and the error probability ; our strong converse theorem shows that no such trade - off is possible in the asymptotic limit of many channel uses .",
    "a strong converse theorem in this context states that for any coding scheme , which seeks to transmit at a rate strictly higher than the capacity of the channel , the probability of successful decoding decays to zero exponentially fast in the number of channel uses .",
    "so our result sharpens bowen s @xcite , strengthens the main result of @xcite , and generalizes ( * ? ? ? * theorem  7 ) to the quantum case .",
    "the approach taken is inspired by that used by nagaoka @xcite , who derived the strong converse theorem for any memoryless quantum channel from the monotonicity of the rnyi relative entropies .",
    "polyanskiy and verd @xcite later generalised this approach to show how a bound on the success probability could be derived from any relative - entropy - like quantity that satisfies certain natural properties .",
    "this approach has already been used to prove several strong converse theorems for quantum channels @xcite ; here we shall use the sandwiched rnyi relative entropy @xcite .    with the proof of theorem  [ stein ] in hand",
    ", it requires only a little extra effort to prove a strong converse for the quantum - feedback - assisted capacity of a quantum channel ( the capacity when unlimited use of a noiseless quantum feedback channel from receiver to sender is allowed ) .",
