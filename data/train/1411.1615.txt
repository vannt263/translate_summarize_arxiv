    "the ir luminosity of galaxies combined with the fuv luminosity provides a reliable measure of dust attenuation which is key to obtaining stellar population parameters such as star formation rate and stellar mass .",
    "however , at high redshift , because of the limited sensitivities of existing ir telescopes , luminosities have been measured only for relatively luminous galaxies ( @xmath17@xmath18 at @xmath19 , see , e.g. , @xcite ) except for a small number of less luminous , lensed galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "however , previous studies have failed to individually detect dust emission from laes except for rare objects with ( u)lirg - like luminosities @xcite .",

    "although , usually , sed fitting has thus been used to derive @xmath24 for laes , @xmath24 values from sed fitting are sensitively dependent on the attenuation curve assumed .",
    "all of the previous studies of laes have assumed the calzetti curve @xcite and obtained a relatively wide range of @xmath24@xmath25 magnitude ( see table 2 of @xcite ) .",
    "however , recent observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , we obtain a large sample of 213 laes down to @xmath39 magnitude ( 5@xmath40 , 2@xmath41 diameter aperture ) with average @xmath42 magnitude and @xmath43 magnitude .",
    "since none of the 213 laes has a counterpart in either the mips or pacs catalog @xcite within 1@xmath41 radius , we perform the stacking analysis at the position of the laes in the mips/@xmath44 m , pacs/70@xmath32 m , 100@xmath32 m , and 160@xmath32 m bands . for mips/@xmath44 m , before stacking , we remove sources listed in the mips catalog with a similar method to @xcite and subtract a large - scale residual background following the procedure given in @xcite . for each band ,",
    "50@xmath41  @xmath45  50@xmath41 cut - out images are median stacked .",
    "we then perform aperture photometry at the center of each stacked image on a radius of @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 for mips/24@xmath32 m , pacs/70@xmath32 m , 100@xmath32 m , and 160@xmath32 m , respectively . no significant signal is detected in any of the four stacked images , where the sky noise for each band is estimated from 1000 realizations generated by bootstrap resampling of the 213 objects as done by @xcite .",
    "thus , we derive the @xmath3 upper limit of the total flux density for each band by multiplying the @xmath3 sky noise by an aperture correction factor of 2.87 , 2.45 , 1.96 , and 1.92 for mips/24@xmath32 m , pacs/70@xmath32 m , 100@xmath32 m , and 160@xmath32 m , respectively .",

    "we calculate the upper limit of the infrared ( @xmath50 m ) luminosity , @xmath17 , of the stacked lae using the mips and pacs @xmath3 data separately , by scaling the dust sed templates of local galaxies binned over various properties provided by @xcite . for the mips data , we scale the lowest - metallicity template to the @xmath44 m limit to obtain @xmath4@xmath5.we adopt this template because it gives the highest ( i.e. , most conservative ) @xmath4  among all . for the pacs data",
    ", we fit the templates to a combination of the three data points to obtain @xmath4@xmath51 as the most conservative limit .",
    "we adopt the mips - based @xmath4  as the upper limit of our laes and use it in the following section .",

    "indeed , this template has a relatively high ir8 ( = @xmath58 of 6.7 , being close to those of @xmath59 uv - selected galaxies , @xmath60 @xcite , and significantly higher than the typical value of @xmath61 star - forming galaxies ( ir8  =  4 ; * ? ? ?",

    "starburst galaxies with high ir surface densities can also have high ir8 @xcite .",

    "a 1 kpc half - light radius is assumed here ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "thus , it appears to be unlikely that the mips - based @xmath4  is significantly underestimating the true value .",
    "note that the pacs - based @xmath4 divided by the @xmath62 of the lowest - metallicity template scaled to the mips photometry , gives @xmath67 .",
    "however , we should keep in mind that the derivation of the mips - based @xmath4 is based on two important assumptions that the local calibration between the 8  @xmath0 m emission and the dust sed shape and metallicity applies at high redshifts and that our laes have indeed low metallicities as suggested by previous studies .",
    "forty - four percent of our laes are within the coverage of deep hst images from the goods and candels surveys . among them",
    ", we use 52 objects with uncontaminated irac images to obtain an hst f606w - centered , median image - stacked sed from optical to mir wavelengths , which we assume to represent the entire sample and use for sed fitting .",
    "the images used for stacking are : the wfi @xmath34 @xcite , the hst / acs f606w , f775w , f850lp @xcite , the hst / wfc3 f125w , f140w , f160w @xcite , and the spitzer / irac 3.6  @xmath0 m , 4.5  @xmath0 m , 5.8  @xmath0 m , 8.0  @xmath0 m @xcite . in photometry ,",
    "the aperture radius and the aperture correction for the @xmath34 and irac images are determined following the procedure of @xcite .",
    "the aperture radius for the acs / wfc images is set to @xmath68 with an aperture correction factor of 1.07 @xcite .",
    "table 1 shows the total flux densities of the stacked sed , where the errors are a quadratic sum of the photometric error and error in zero point .",
    "the @xmath3 luminosity obtained in section 3.1 , @xmath4  @xmath5 , is 200 times lower than the knee luminosity of the ir luminosity function at @xmath59 @xcite , implying that the majority of @xmath14 laes have very faint dust emission .",
    "the unobscured sfr derived from the ultraviolet luminosity of the stacked sed , @xmath12  @xmath71 , using the formula devised by @xcite , is @xmath72@xmath73 .",
    "thus , the ratio of obscured to unobscured sfrs is @xmath69  /  @xmath72  @xmath74 .",
    "this constraint is comparable or stronger than those for @xmath75 laes obtained by @xcite , @xmath69  /  @xmath72@xmath76@xmath77 .",

    "[ eq : sfrtot ]      the relation between the ir to uv luminosity ratio , @xmath82  @xmath17  /  @xmath12 , and the slope of the uv continuum , @xmath83 , is useful for constraining the attenuation curve of galaxies .",
    "our stacked lae has @xmath84 and @xmath85 using the mips/24 @xmath32m - based @xmath4 .",
    "this irx corresponds to @xmath24  @xmath86  magnitude with the conversion formula by @xcite .",

    "as found in figure [ irx - beta ] , these irx and @xmath83 are inconsistent with the relation for local starburst galaxies @xcite ( m99 , almost the same as the calzetti curve ) while consistent with an updated m99 given in @xcite and the smc curve @xcite .",
    "the original m99 gives a 3.8 times higher irx at the observed @xmath83 .",
    "all three attenuation curves assume an intrinsic slope @xmath87 , while our best - fit sed model spectrum has @xmath88 and @xmath89 with the m99 and smc curves , respectively ( see sec 4.3 )",
    ". adopting these bluer @xmath90 instead of @xmath91 increases the inconsistency of the m99 in the irx@xmath83 plot while the smc curve is still consistent .",
    "the pacs - based @xmath4  gives a high @xmath92 falling well above the m99 .",
    "indeed , the m99 is allowed in the case of @xmath93 .",
    "this happens if the mips - based @xmath4  is a factor of @xmath94 underestimate , i.e. the true ir8 is higher than @xmath95 .",
    "however , as discussed in section 3.1 , such a high ir8 appears to be unlikely in our laes .",
    "we perform sed fitting on the stacked sed given in table 1 to derive stellar population parameters with the procedure given in @xcite , in which nebular emission is taken into account .",
    "we assume constant star formation history following previous sed studies of laes and examine the cases of the calzetti and smc curves .",
    "although a stacked sed is not necessarily a good representation of individual objects @xcite , stacking is still useful for our faint objects to obtain an sed covering rest - frame @xmath96 m and to consistently compare it with the stacked fir sed .",
    "table [ tbl : sed_para ] summarizes the best - fit parameters and figure [ sed_plot ] compares the best - fit seds with the observed one .",
    "as expected from the results on the irx@xmath83 plot , the fit using the calzetti curve gives a 2 magnitude higher @xmath24 and 10 times higher sfr than those calculated from the mips - based @xmath4 , while the results with the smc curve are roughly consistent .",
    "the sfr from the sed fit with the calzetti curve is significantly larger than even the maximum @xmath79@xmath97 yr@xmath29 from the pacs - based @xmath4 .",
    "both curves give nearly the same stellar mass , because it is determined essentially from longer wavelengths ( @xmath981  @xmath0 m ) .",
    "the calzetti curve gives an age less than 10 myr , which is much shorter than dynamical times of laes , @xmath99@xmath100 myr @xcite .",
    "we also note that the calzetti curve gives too high an escape fraction of ionizing photons @xmath101 compared with observed values for laes , @xmath102@xmath103 @xcite .",
    "these results suggest that the smc curve is more appropriate than calzetti for the majority of laes at @xmath104 . with the smc curve ,",
    "our stacked lae has an relatively old age of 200 myr .",
    "@xcite have provided a stacked sed of @xmath53 laes in the subaru / xmm - newton deep field for which a less dust - sensitive sfr estimate from narrow - band h@xmath105 imaging is available .",
    "sed fitting to this stacked data finds that the e(b - v ) derived assuming the calzetti curve gives an @xmath106 ( @xmath107 ) which is two times higher than the h@xmath105-based one ( @xmath108@xmath109 ) , while adopting the smc curve gives a consistent result ( @xmath106@xmath110 , @xmath108@xmath111 ) .",
    "notice that @xmath112 is assumed for modest dust - correction of the h@xmath105 luminosity .",
    "thus we find here that the smc curve is preferred .",
    "a relatively tight correlation is seen between sfr and m@xmath113 at every redshift @xcite .",
    "galaxies on this star formation main sequence ( sfms ) are thought to form stars steadily , perhaps being in an equilibrium between gas consumption and accretion , while those above the sfms are forming stars burstly .",
    "as found in figure  [ ms ] , our laes lie on a lower - mass extrapolation of the sfms defined by massive galaxies ( @xmath114 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this suggests that the majority of @xmath1 laes are in the normal star - formation mode and that the sfms appears to continue down to below @xmath115 .",
    "note that adopting the calzetti curve leads us to conclude that they are undergoing starburst . on the other hand ,",
    "most of the extremely luminous , individually detected laes at @xmath14 by @xcite are burst - like galaxies .",
    "the individually detected laes by @xcite also tend to be bursty .",
    "both authors have used the calzetti curve .",
    "one possibility is that the star formation modes of laes studied in these papers and our laes are different .",
    "the other is that some of their laes also have an smc - like attenuation curve and hence their sfrs are predicted to shift towards the sfms .",
    "recent deep alma observations have revealed an abundant population of faint ( down to @xmath116jy at @xmath117 mm ) smgs @xcite .",
    "optical counterparts to them remain to be identified and laes are on a list of potential candidates @xcite . we find that galaxies with @xmath4 have relatively constant 1.2-mm flux densities of @xmath118  10  @xmath0jy over a wide redshift range of @xmath119 due to the so - called negative @xmath120 correction .",
    "therefore , typical laes are unlikely to be major counterparts to the faint smgs unless they significantly evolve in @xmath17 with redshift .",
    "this is not to rule out the possibility that rare , luminous ( @xmath12@xmath121 ) laes are detectable with alma , although a luminous ly@xmath105 blob at @xmath122 , himiko , is undetected with alma at 1.2 mm and its strong upper limit ,  52  @xmath0jy @xcite , is consistent with our value .",
    "deep alma observations of luminous laes can also be useful , even with non detection , for discriminating between attenuation curves combined with @xmath83 measurements .",
    "the escape fractions of @xmath2 and uv continuum photons are robustly constrained from @xmath4 . by stacking the 52 laes in the nb387 band ,",
    "we obtain @xmath123 erg s@xmath29 , which is converted into @xmath124 @xcite . here",
    "we have assumed that the nb387 photometry recovers the total @xmath2 luminosity . since the intrinsic @xmath2 luminosity can be calculated from the total sfr , the escape fraction of @xmath2 is constrained as : @xmath125 this constraint on @xmath126",
    "is roughly consistent with that based on the h@xmath105 luminosity @xcite as well as the lower limits obtained by @xcite from fir stacking .",
    "the escape fraction of uv continuum photons is constrained to be : @xmath127 these @xmath126 and @xmath128 values are significantly higher than the cosmic averages at @xmath14 , @xmath126@xmath129 @xcite and @xmath128@xmath130 @xcite , but comparable to those at @xmath131 . a number of mechanisms ( e.g. , outflow and clumpy ism distribution ) have been proposed that make the escape of @xmath2 photons easy in laes .",
