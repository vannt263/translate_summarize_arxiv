    "dalitz plot analysis of three - body decays of neutral @xmath1 mesons is a useful tool in various measurements where coherent admixtures of @xmath5and @xmath6are observed .",
    "this technique was initially proposed for the measurement of the unitarity triangle angle @xmath0 in @xmath2decays @xcite .",
    "later it was applied to the measurement of charm mixing  @xcite and to the resolution of the quadratic ambiguity in the measurement of the angle @xmath7 using a time - dependent analysis of the decay @xmath8",
    "most of these measurements are based on the @xmath9decay which offers the best precision among three - body @xmath5 decays .",
    "the technique is model - dependent  it depends on the complex amplitude of the @xmath5decay which is obtained from the @xmath10sample using model assumptions .",
    "the result of the measurement contains therefore model uncertainties . in the case of @xmath0 measurement , this uncertainty ( @xmath11 ) is already comparable to the statistical accuracy  @xcite .    however , a modification of the analysis is possible that allows to perform a completely model - independent measurement  @xcite .",
    "it requires the phase space of the three - body @xmath1 decay to be divided into bins .",
    "information about the complex phase in each bin can be extracted from the quantum - correlated @xmath5 decays from @xmath12 process .",
    "the measurement of the strong phase in bins of the @xmath9phase space was recently performed by the cleo collaboration  @xcite .",
    "this measurement should allow to reduce the error of @xmath0 related to the uncertainty in the @xmath9amplitude to @xmath13 .",
    "recently , charm mixing was observed by the belle and babar experiments  @xcite . with degree - level precision ,",
    "the effect of charm mixing can become significant in the measurement of @xmath0 .",
    "it was shown that mixing contributes only of second order in the @xmath14 and @xmath15 parameters to the ads , glw and model - dependent dalitz plot analysis methods , and thus can be safely neglected  @xcite .",
    "but the effect of mixing on the binned analysis with the phase terms extracted from quantum - correlated @xmath5 decays is of separate interest .    in this paper , we investigate the impact of the charm mixing on the model - independent @xmath0 measurement , and show that ignoring the mixing at all stages of the analysis is safe up to a sub - degree level of precision .",
    "we also find that in the coherent production of @xmath3 system in @xmath4 collisions , the effect of charm mixing is enhanced compared to the case of @xmath16 production , and propose a model - independent method to measure charm mixing parameters in time - integrated dalitz analysis at charm factories .",
    "the method is sensitive to both mixing parameters , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , as well as to @xmath17violation parameters @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the sensitivity of the proposed method can be improved by adding doubly cabibbo - suppressed three - body modes such as @xmath20 .",
    "we estimate the sensitivity of the proposed method using monte - carlo ( mc ) simulation .",
    "to introduce the notation we briefly recap the technique of model - independent binned dalitz plot analysis of @xmath2 , @xmath9decays used to extract the angle @xmath0 . as usually presented",
    ", this does not take charm mixing effects into account .    the amplitude of the @xmath2",
    ", @xmath9decay can be written as @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the amplitude of the @xmath24decay , @xmath25 is the amplitude of the @xmath26decay ( @xmath27 in the case of @xmath17conservation in @xmath1 decay ) , @xmath28 is the ratio of the absolute values of the interfering @xmath29 and @xmath30 amplitudes , and @xmath31 is the strong phase difference between these amplitudes .",
    "the density of the @xmath1 decay dalitz plot from @xmath2  decay is given by the absolute value squared of the amplitude @xmath32 where @xmath33 the functions @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the cosine and sine of the strong phase difference @xmath36 between the @xmath24and @xmath26 amplitudes decay amplitudes introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite . ] : @xmath37 the equations for the charge - conjugate mode @xmath38 are obtained with the substitution @xmath39 .",
    "using both @xmath40 charges , one can obtain @xmath0 and @xmath31 separately .    in the binned model - independent approach , the dalitz plot is divided into @xmath41 bins symmetrically to the exchange @xmath42 .",
    "the expected number of events in the bin `` @xmath43 '' of the dalitz plot of @xmath1 from @xmath2  is @xmath44 \\ , ,     \\label{n_b}\\ ] ] where @xmath45 is the number of events in the corresponding bin of the dalitz plot of the @xmath1 meson in a flavor eigenstate ( obtained using @xmath46 samples ) and @xmath47 is a normalization constant .",
    "the bin index `` @xmath43 '' ranges from @xmath48 to @xmath49 ( excluding 0 ) ; the exchange @xmath50 corresponds to the exchange @xmath51 .",
    "the terms @xmath52 and @xmath53 include information about the cosine and sine of the phase difference averaged over the bin region : @xmath54 here @xmath55 represents the dalitz plot phase space and @xmath56 is the bin region over which the integration is performed .",
    "the terms @xmath53 are defined similarly with cosine substituted by sine .    the expected number of events in each dalitz plot bin ( [ n_b ] ) is trivially obtained from the probability density ( [ p_b ] ) by integrating over the bin area , which leads to the substitutions @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 . in what follows ,",
    "we only quote the number of events to save space .",
    "normalization constants ( such as @xmath60 in ( [ n_b ] ) ) are also omitted .",
    "the symmetry under @xmath61 requires @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "the values of @xmath52 and @xmath53 terms can be provided by charm - factory experiments operated at the threshold of @xmath64 pair production  @xcite .",
    "the wave function of the two mesons is antisymmetric , thus the four - dimensional density of two correlated @xmath9dalitz plots is @xmath65 where the indices `` 1 '' and `` 2 '' correspond to the two decaying @xmath1 mesons . in the case of a binned analysis , the number of events in the region of the @xmath66 phase space described by the indices `` @xmath43 '' and `` @xmath67 '' is @xmath68 once the values of the terms @xmath52 and @xmath53 are known from charm - factory data , the system of equations ( [ n_b ] ) contains only three free parameters ( @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath60 ) for each @xmath40 charge , and can be solved using maximum likelihood method to extract the value of @xmath0 .    note that technically the system ( [ n_b ] ) can be solved without external constraints on @xmath52 and @xmath53 for @xmath71 . however , due to the small value of @xmath28 , there is very little sensitivity to the @xmath52 and @xmath53 parameters in @xmath2decays , which results in a reduction in the precision on @xmath0 that can be obtained  @xcite .",
    "in the case of @xmath17conservation , the mass eigenstates of the neutral @xmath1 system are given by @xmath73    charm mixing is described by two parameters , @xmath74 and @xmath75 , which are defined as @xmath76 where @xmath77 and @xmath78 are the mass and decay widths of the mass eigenstates .",
    "we use notations @xmath74 and @xmath75 instead of the more common @xmath14 and @xmath15 in order not to confuse them with the @xmath17-violating parameters @xmath69 and @xmath70 introduced before .",
    "the current world average values are : @xmath79 , @xmath80  @xcite .",
    "@xmath17violation modifies the expression  ( [ d_cpcons ] ) to @xmath81 where @xmath82 and @xmath83 satisfy @xmath84 .",
    "@xmath17-violating mixing is thus described by two additional parameters @xmath18 and @xmath19 : @xmath85    below we present all the quantities that enter the model - independent analysis including the contribution of the @xmath17-conserving charm mixing ( the corresponding quantities are denoted with the prime mark ) .",
    "the full formalism including @xmath17violation in mixing is given in appendix  [ full_formalism ] .",
    "the amplitude for the correlated @xmath88 decay , assuming that the particle denoted with the index `` 1 '' decayed first , equals @xmath89 before the particle `` 1 '' decays , the amplitude stays antisymmetric and the mixing does not affect it .",
    "we can therefore assume that the particle `` 1 '' decays at the time @xmath90 and count time from the moment of its decay .",
    "after the integration over time and taking the absolute value squared of the amplitude  ( [ a_corr ] ) , we obtain the number of events @xmath91 in the bin `` @xmath92 '' of the phase space for the pair of @xmath1 mesons ( still assuming that the particle `` 1 '' denoted here with the index `` @xmath43 '' decayed first ) : @xmath93 however , measurement of the decay time in an experiment with symmetric beams is difficult . therefore one has to average over the decay order , which leads to the cancellation of all terms linear in mixing parameters : @xmath94    the real analysis performed at cleo uses the values @xmath91 ( which , as we have seen , are unaffected by mixing at first order ) , and values of @xmath45 obtained from correlated @xmath64 decays where one of the @xmath1 mesons serves as a flavor tag .",
    "the @xmath45 values extracted this way are also unaffected by mixing . therefore , the values of @xmath52 and @xmath53 extracted in this analysis contain no linear mixing contribution .",
    "as far as processes observed at @xmath40 factories are concerned , both the @xmath9decay from @xmath2and the flavor - tagged @xmath9decay contain mixing contributions , and therefore the observable numbers of events in the dalitz plot bins are @xmath95 and @xmath96 , respectively . clearly , if one uses the values @xmath45 , obtained from a charm factory , in the fit to obtain @xmath0 from @xmath95 described by eq .",
    "[ n_mix ] , the resulting value contains contribution in first order in @xmath74 , @xmath75 .",
    "if the values @xmath96 are used , eq .  [ n_mix ] can be rewritten as @xmath97 _ i. e. _ it has the same form as eq .",
    "[ n_b ] , without mixing contributions up to second - order in @xmath98 , but the phase terms @xmath99 contain first - order mixing corrections : @xmath100    thus , if the terms @xmath101 are left as free parameters in the fit to @xmath40 decay data , the mixing correction is only of second order ( the effective parameters @xmath102 , @xmath103 are measured in this case @xcite ) , but if these terms are obtained from correlated @xmath1 decays , first order mixing corrections to @xmath0 appear .",
    "however , these corrections are additionally suppressed by factor @xmath104 , and the residual contribution of charm mixing to @xmath69 and @xmath70 is at a percent level .      1 .   using @xmath45 ( unaffected by mixing ) from the coherent @xmath64 production , 2",

    "[ n_mix ] ( assuming that @xmath74 , @xmath75 are known ) .",
    "the effect of mixing on the fitted value of @xmath0 depends on the value @xmath105 , the ratio @xmath106 , and the @xmath31 and @xmath0 values . in our study",
    ", we use @xmath107 ( all biases are proportional to this quantity ) and scan over the other parameters . the results are shown in table  [ tab : gamma_bias ] . clearly ,",

    "the maximum @xmath0 biases for varying @xmath108 , @xmath31 and @xmath0 , as well as the values of these parameters at which the maximum is reached , are shown .",
    "the estimation assumes @xmath107 . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the observed numbers of events @xmath109 are obtained using the exact formulas with mixing ( see appendix  [ full_formalism ] ) .",
    "when the systematic effect of charm mixing on the @xmath0 measurement is studied , the values of @xmath109 are fixed ( which corresponds to infinite statistics ) , while in the study of the statistical sensitivity of the mixing measurement in sections [ mixing_tint ] and [ other_modes ] , we sample the @xmath109 values according to the poisson distribution .",
    "the expected numbers of events @xmath110 include the free parameters of interest ( @xmath69 and @xmath70 in section  [ gamma_mixing ] or mixing parameters in sections [ mixing_tint ] and [ other_modes ] ) and are expressed via the numbers of events in flavor - specific @xmath5 state @xmath45 and the phase terms @xmath52 , @xmath53 .",
