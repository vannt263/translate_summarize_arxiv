    "turbulent bubbly flow has important industrial applications such as in chemical industries and steel plants  @xcite .",
    "a fundamental understanding of the influence of bubbles on turbulence is crucial for better designs and optimal utilization of resources  @xcite .",
    "the fundamental question we study in this work is : how do bubbles modify the turbulence ? -",
    "i.e. what is their effect on the turbulent energy spectrum and liquid velocity fluctuations .",
    "the source of energy input in turbulent bubbly flows can have a contribution from both bubbles and some other external forcing ( which affect the liquid fluctuations ) . depending on this source of energy input , we can have various regimes in turbulent bubbly flows .",
    "the bubblance parameter `` b '' was introduced  ( @xcite ) to distinguish between the regimes of pseudo - turbulence ( i.e. turbulence driven solely by bubbles rising in a quiescent fluid ) and turbulence induced by liquid fluctuations alone .",
    "the bubblance parameter is defined as a ratio of the bubble - induced kinetic energy to the kinetic energy induced by the turbulent liquid alone without bubbles :    @xmath13    where , @xmath7 is the bubble concentration ( void fraction ) , @xmath14 is the bubble rise velocity in still water , and @xmath15 is the typical turbulent liquid fluctuation in the absence of bubbles .",
    "the extreme cases are b = 0 for single - phase turbulent flow ( i.e. bubbles being absent in the flow ) and b = @xmath16 for pseudo - turbulence .    pioneering measurements by  @xcite used hot - wire and laser doppler anemometry ( lda ) in a turbulent bubbly flow to show that the classical _ -5/3 _ kolmogorov energy spectrum exponent is progressively substituted by a _ -8/3 _ exponent with increasing gas fraction @xmath7 .",
    "they proposed that the steeper spectrum originates from the immediate dissipation of bubble wakes .",
    "they also put forward arguments based on dimensional analysis that the energy spectrum exponent is _",
    "-3 _ for pseudo - turbulence .",
    "from the definition of the bubblance parameter , one would expect different spectral scaling behaviour depending on the energy input that is more dominant .",
    "for @xmath17 the active - grid - induced turbulent fluctuations would be more dominant and hence the spectrum exponent would be close to _ -5/3 _ ( kolmogorov ) . when @xmath18 , the bubble - induced fluctuations would be important and",
    "the exponent would be closer to _ -3 _ ( see  @xcite for a review ) .",
    "recent experiments  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have conclusively found that the energy spectrum exponent is close to _",
    "-3 _ for the pseudo - turbulent case ( b = @xmath16 ) .",
    "other experiments in the wake of a swarm of rising bubbles ( b = @xmath16 ) also found a spectral exponent @xmath19 _ -3 _  @xcite .",
    "although a few early studies  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have reported a spectrum scaling of _",
    "_ for b = @xmath16 , recent work have clearly established that the pseudo - turbulence spectrum scaling is close to _",
    "the _ -3 _ spectrum scaling is found to be robust even if the bubble size is changed , or if higher viscosity liquids are used instead of water .",
    "the recent study by @xcite suggests that the specific details of the hydrodynamic interactions among bubbles do not influence the way in which the pseudo - turbulent fluctuations are produced .",
    "the current understanding is that the bubble - induced turbulence mainly results from the bubble wakes .",
    "the importance of the bubble wakes on the _ -3 _ spectrum scaling has also been established using numerical simulations by comparing the spectrum scalings between point - like bubble simulations  @xcite and fully - resolved simulations of freely rising deformable bubbles  @xcite , with the former one giving _",
    "-5/3 _ due to the absence of wakes , and the latter fully - resolved simulations giving _ -3 _ as the spectral scaling exponent .",
    "a new approach proposed by  @xcite is to decompose the total liquid fluctuations into two contributions : spatial and temporal parts .",
    "experiments with rising bubbles can only measure the sum of the spatial and the temporal fluctuations ; and the two contributions can not be easily distinguished .",
    "however , experiments with a fixed array of spheres distributed randomly in a uniform flow have been able to separately study the two contributions  @xcite .",
    "these experiments have suggested that the spatial contribution is dominant over the temporal part upto bubble reynolds numbers @xmath19 1000 .",
    "recent numerical simulations have found that the spectra of both the spatial and temporal contributions result in a _",
    "-3 _ scaling  @xcite . in the present work ,",
    "we add external turbulence using an active - grid to the system of rising bubbles by varying the @xmath8 parameter .",
    "previous work has mainly been concerned with the extreme values of the @xmath8 parameter , i.e. either pseudo - turbulence ( @xmath0 ) or single - phase turbulence ( b = 0 ) .",
    "our focus in this paper is to study what happens _ in between these extremes _ @xmath0 and @xmath1 as the energy spectrum scaling and the liquid velocity fluctuation statistics are not well known for large ranges of intermediate @xmath8 . in this paper , we thus want to systematically analyse the flow as a function of the @xmath8 parameter between the cases of single - phase turbulence ( @xmath1 ) , turbulence with some bubbles ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "the @xmath8 parameter is varied over 2 - 3 orders of magnitude , namely from @xmath21 to @xmath6 , and the pseudo turbulent case @xmath0 is also included .",
    "in the next section , we describe the experimental setup , tools and methods used .",
    "this is followed by the results section where we describe our findings for the liquid velocity fluctuations and energy spectra .",
    "we provide an interpretation of our results in the discussion section and summarise our work .",
    "the experiments are carried out in the twente water tunnel ( twt ) facility , which is an @xmath22-high vertical water tunnel ( see figure  [ fig : expt_schem ] ) .",
    "the measurement section of the twt ( dimensions : @xmath23 ) is made of transparent glass to provide optical access for flow visualization and measurements .",
    "we place the phase - sensitive cta ( hot - film ) probe in the centre of this measurement section , more details on this technique are discussed in the next section .",

    "a photron - pci 1024 high - speed camera was focused on a vertical plane at the centre of the measurement section .",

    "the @xmath34 experiments are shown in figure  [ fig : exp_snapshot](a ) and ( b ) where the gas void fractions are @xmath7 = 2@xmath29 and 1@xmath29 , respectively .",
    "the dense nature of the flow at such void fractions is evident : the flow is opaque and the phase - sensitive cta probe is barely visible . as we proceed to look at the other cases in figure  [ fig : exp_snapshot](c)-(f ) , @xmath7 decreases , and the liquid mean flow speeds ( @xmath28 ) increase , corresponding to a decrease in the @xmath8 parameter from @xmath16 to @xmath35 . in our experiments , the bubbles must pass through the active - grid , which consists of randomly oscillating steel flaps ( @xmath36 few rotations per second ) to generate the required turbulence . at",
    "any given instant of time , the active grid is @xmath37 transparent ( open ) to the flow .",
    "hence , the bubbles face a slight obstruction and sometimes interact with the steel flaps .",
    "the obstruction has a local effect which is negligible when considering the overall flow , and the cta probe is located sufficiently far away ( @xmath38 ) from the active - grid .",
    "the bubble - flap interaction , however , causes fragmentation of the bubbles and results in a decrease of the diameter of the bubbles .",
    "this bubble diameter decrease becomes apparent at higher liquid mean flow speeds ( @xmath28 ) , as seen in figure  [ fig : exp_snapshot](c)-(f ) .    ) at different conditions .",
    ", width=529 ]    we obtain a quantitative measurement of the bubble diameter using the images acquired ( figure  [ fig : exp_snapshot ] ) from the individual experiments .",
    "the bubbles highly deform over time , and given the dense nature ( high @xmath7 ) of the flows , there is currently no reliable automated image processing algorithm available to accurately determine the bubble diameter .",
    "hence , we had to resort to a manual procedure - where individual bubble boundaries are marked using mouse - clicks in the open - source imagej software .",
    "an ellipse is fitted to the deformed bubble boundaries , and the equivalent bubble diameter is calculated as : @xmath39{d_{l}^2d_{s}}$ ] , where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the long and short axes of the ellipsoidal bubble . in each experiment , we measure the diameters of @xmath42 bubble samples , and then take the mean value of the distribution to be the equivalent diameter of the bubble . in figure",
    "[ fig : sizevsb ] we observe that the bubble diameter decreases with a decrease in the @xmath8 parameter ( increasing liquid mean flow speeds ) .",
    "the decrease in the bubble diameters at higher liquid mean flow speeds is mainly due to the fragmentation of the bubbles ( as described above ) ( also see  @xcite ) . here",
    ", the error bars represent the standard deviation of the measured distribution of bubble diameters .",
    "the error bars are estimated based on the standard deviations.,width=453 ]    at high mean flow speeds , air is entrained from an open vent at the top of the twt because of oscillations of the free - surface exposed to the atmosphere .",
    "the entrained air unavoidably results in micro - bubbles which are fed back into the measurement section and contaminate the flow .",
    "these entrained micro - bubbles pose a problem at mean flow speeds higher than @xmath43 cm s@xmath26 , and are visible ( as very small bubbles ) in figure  [ fig : exp_snapshot](e ) and ( f ) .",
    "it is necessary to account for these micro - bubbles in the data analysis , and this issue will be discussed further below .",
    "the present experiments in the pseudo - turbulence regime ( @xmath34 ) for set 1 , are essentially the same as the measurements carried out in  @xcite , and serve as a reference case for the data analysis and results . for this case of freely rising bubbles in a quiescent liquid , the bubble - based reynolds number @xmath44  @xcite , where @xmath45 is the kinematic viscosity of water ( @xmath46 m@xmath47 s@xmath26 ) .",
    "hot - film anemometry is a preferred technique in single - phase turbulent flows , but its application in bubbly flows is not straightforward . since it is an intrusive technique , bubble - probe interactions result in disturbances in the hot - film time series voltage signal .",
    "various methods have been developed in the past to remove these ` bubbly spikes '  ( @xcite ) , so as to exclusively analyse only the liquid fluctuation segments measured by the hot - film probe .",
    "for example , a threshold method was used by  @xcite and @xcite and a pattern - recognition method was used by  @xcite .",
    "these methods essentially come up with an indicator function that labels the gas and liquid phase separately .",
    "however , a much better approach to eliminate the bubbly spikes from the cta signal is to measure the indicator function _ in - situ _ during the experiments .",
    "this can be done by attaching optic fibres with a diameter of @xmath19 100 @xmath27 m close to the hot - film probe ( at a distance @xmath191 mm ) to detect the gas phase .",
    "light is continuously passed through the optic fibre , and when a bubble collides with the probe , the change in refractive index of the gas phase results in a signal change .",
    "this technique , called the phase - sensitive constant temperature anemometry ( cta ) was developed by  @xcite and is used in  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "this method can be used to directly detect and remove the bubbly spikes in the hot - film signal .    in this work ,",
    "we follow almost the same experimental procedure and analysis as in  @xcite , but the important difference here is that we vary the @xmath8 parameter over a wide range to cover the regimes between pseudo - turbulence ( @xmath34 ) and single - phase turbulent flow ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "the phase indicator function obtained using information from the optic fibre signal labels the liquid fluctuations and bubble collisions separately .",
    "this is used to remove the bubbly spikes and separate the segments containing only liquid fluctuations from the time series signal for further analysis .",
    "the power spectrum was calculated for each segment of liquid fluctuation and averaged to obtain the spectrum for a particular case of @xmath8 .",
    "the phase - sensitive cta probe is calibrated by simultaneous measurement of absolute velocities of the single - phase using a dantec laser doppler anemometry ( lda ) setup ( as in  @xcite ) .",
    "the standard king s law fit is used for the voltage - velocity data .",
    "the acquisition rate was 10 khz and the measurements were carried out for a duration of 1 hour in each case .",
    "the phase - sensitive cta technique works very well for pseudo - turbulent bubbly flows where the bubble diameters are in the range @xmath19 2 - 5 mm .",
    "however , when micro - bubbles collide with the cta probe , the optic fibres will not be able to register the collision .",
    "the reasons for this are two - fold : ( i ) the micro - bubbles are small in size ( @xmath49 @xmath27 m diameter ) , and ( ii ) the separation distance between the cta probe and the optical fibres is larger ( @xmath50 mm ) than the micro - bubble size . as we mentioned before , micro - bubbles cause a contamination in the present experiments when the mean flow speeds exceed @xmath43 cm s@xmath26 . in these experiments , we inevitably use a threshold method to remove the micro - bubble collisions , in addition to the phase information obtained from the optic fibres .",
    "further , to keep the data analysis consistent , the combination of the optical fibres and the threshold method is also used in all the experiments except pseudo - turbulence , where only the optical fibres are used .",

    "these pseudo - turbulence cases , @xmath0 , @xmath7 = 2@xmath29 and 1.17@xmath29 nicely follow the _ -3 _ scaling , with a clear deviation from the single - phase spectrum , confirming previous results  ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it is believed that the _ -3 _ spectrum sub - range at intermediate length scales originates from the wakes of the rising bubbles .",
    "we mark the characteristic frequency of the freely rising bubbles ( set 1 ) : @xmath75 hz , where , @xmath76 cm s@xmath26  @xcite is the bubble rise velocity in still water , and @xmath77 = 5 - 3 mm is the range of bubble diameters ( see figure  [ fig : sizevsb ] ) .",
    "this frequency @xmath78 represents a transition ( or cut - off ) frequency where the bubbly spectra change slope from _ -5/3 _ ( kolmogorov ) to _ -3 _ ( pseudo - turbulence ) .",
    "the bubbly spectra follow the _ -5/3 _ ( kolmogorov ) scaling till the transition frequency @xmath78 , beyond which they follow the _ -3 _ pseudo - turbulence scaling . in figure",
    "[ fig : spectrum](b ) , we compare these pseudo - turbulence results ( set 1 experiments ) to a different size distribution ( set 2 experiments ) of the bubbles ( see table  [ tab : kd ] ) .",
    "all of the @xmath0 cases in the set 2 experiments with @xmath79 , nicely follow the _ -3 _ spectrum scaling beyond the transition frequency @xmath80 ( also see the _ -3 _ compensated plot - figure  [ fig : spectrum_compensated](d ) ) . here , the characteristic bubble frequency is @xmath81 hz , where , @xmath76 cm s@xmath26  @xcite is the bubble rise velocity in still water , and @xmath82 is the bubble diameter for the set 2 experiments ( see figure  [ fig : sizevsb ] ) .",
    "these results once again confirm the typical pseudo - turbulence _ -3 _ energy spectrum scaling for freely rising bubbles .",
    "hence , for length scales smaller than the bubble size ( @xmath83 ) , the turbulence induced by the bubble wakes results in a _",
    "-3 _ scaling and for larger length scales ( @xmath84 ) , the classical kolmogorov _ -5/3 _ scaling seems to hold .",
    "we now depart from the pseudo - turbulent case and get into mixed regimes which are in between pseudo - turbulence and single - phase . for @xmath8 parameter values in the order of 1 ,",
    "i.e. for @xmath11 , the net fluctuations did not show a change when the @xmath8 parameter changes from pseudo - turbulence ( @xmath0 ) to @xmath67 ( figure  [ fig : stat1 ] ) , then the question is whether there is a change in the spectra ?",
    "the spectrum results for the set 1 experiments ( @xmath85 ) and set 2 experiments ( @xmath85 ) are shown in figure  [ fig : spectrum](c ) and ( d ) respectively .",
    "we observe that the spectra do not change significantly as compared to the pseudo - turbulent case .",
    "although there is a very slight energy decrease at frequencies around @xmath86 hz compared the pseudo - turbulent cases , the _ -3 _ scaling still holds .    at @xmath8 parameter values less than 1 ( @xmath62 ) , we have previously seen ( in figure  [",
    "fig : stat1 ] ) that the net liquid velocity fluctuations show a weak decrease with decreasing @xmath8 parameter value . in this regime , the surrounding liquid turbulence starts to have a dominant contribution .",
    "hence , it is interesting to study how the spectra eventually approach the single - phase scaling behaviour .",
    "we now look at the spectral results for @xmath8 parameter values in the order of @xmath19o(0.1,0.01 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : spectrum](e ) shows the spectrum results for the set 1 experiments with @xmath8 parameter values @xmath87 .",
    "surprisingly , we observe that the _ -3 _ scaling is still followed in all the cases beyond the transition frequency @xmath78",
    ". we can also observe a very slight increase in energy at the intermediate scales ( around frequencies @xmath88 hz ) as the @xmath8 parameter decreases from @xmath89 to @xmath90 , but the _ -3 _ scaling does not change much . in the set 2 experiments ( figure  [ fig : spectrum](f ) ) , we cover more cases of the @xmath8 parameter , @xmath91 , and find that the results are very similar to the set 1 experiments ( figure  [ fig : spectrum](e ) ) .",
    "once again , there is a gradual energy increase at the intermediate scales as @xmath8 parameter decreases from @xmath89 to @xmath92 , but the _ -3 _ scaling is followed nicely . in the cases at low @xmath93 , the active - grid - induced turbulence dominates the flow , but remarkably the spectra still show a reasonable _ -3 _ subrange scaling .",
    "this finding suggests that even a small ` contribution ' of turbulent flow by bubble wakes is sufficient to modify the spectral properties , due to the long lifetime of the bubble wakes . the two experimental sets with different bubble diameters ( set 1 and set 2 ) have revealed essentially similar results and trends .",
    "we have systematically varied the bubblance parameter from @xmath0 to @xmath90 , and studied in detail the liquid velocity pdfs and energy spectra .",
    "the liquid velocity pdfs for the bubbly cases ( @xmath9 ) show asymmetry , and more upward fluctuations compared to a gaussian profile . when @xmath10 , the net liquid fluctuations reveal a weak dependence with the @xmath8 parameter ; a slight decrease in the fluctuations with decrease in @xmath8 .",
    "we then looked at the effect of varying the bubblance parameter on the energy spectrum scaling .",
    "we have seen in figure  [ fig : spectrum ] that the energy spectra for all the cases ( both set 1 and set 2 ) with bubblance parameter @xmath61 follow the _ -5/3 _ kolmogorov spectrum scaling at the large length - scales ( see figure  [ fig : spectrum_compensated](a),(b ) ) . beyond the transition frequency , all the bubbly spectra roughly exhibit the _ -3 _",
    "subrange scaling ( see figure  [ fig : spectrum_compensated](c),(d ) ) , which has been associated with the bubble wakes . in our experiments",
    ", we have added active - grid - induced turbulence to the configuration of rising bubbles to change the @xmath8 parameter .",
    "the active - grid - induced turbulence has a weak influence on the velocity fluctuations , but why does nt it have an influence on the turbulent energy spectra ?",
    "we will look for clues to answer this question by probing deeper into the physics of bubbly flows .",
    "risso and co - workers proposed that multi - body wake - interaction mechanisms can be studied by decomposing the velocity fluctuations into spatial and temporal contributions  @xcite .",
    "denoting the spatial averaging by brackets , and time averaging by an overbar , the total variance of the velocity can be decomposed into two contributions : @xmath94 the first contribution @xmath95 is associated with the spatial variations of the time averaged velocity .",
    "this spatial contribution is characterised by the random spatial distribution of the bubbles , and is not influenced by turbulence .",
    "the second contribution @xmath96 is related to temporal fluctuations , and changes with the turbulence intensity .",
    "it is evident that the spatial and temporal contributions correspond to different physical mechanisms .",
    "although it would be beneficial to decompose their separate contributions , this is currently not possible in the present experiments because the bubbles do not rise at constant velocity and move relative to each other .",
    "however , such a decomposition was accomplished using experimental investigations of an array of fixed spheres  @xcite .",
    "they found that the spatial contribution is more dominant than the temporal one in the vertical direction ( see figure 5 in  @xcite ) up to reynolds numbers @xmath19 1000 .",
    "it was deduced that the spatial contributions are mainly responsible for the enhancement of the wake decay , in other words , the _",
    "subrange scaling .",
    "@xcite theoretically showed that the superposition of independent random bubble disturbances may generate a continuous spectrum with a _",
    "-3 _ subrange .",
    "recently @xcite numerically found that both the spatial and temporal contributions exhibited the _",
    "subrange , which might be an explanation for why it is always observed in experiments . in our experiments , we vary the active - grid - induced turbulence intensity ( and @xmath8 parameter ) by changing the mean flow speed .",
    "according to the discussion above , this means that we mainly change the temporal contributions , while the spatial contribution dominates in the explored parameter regime ( at bubble reynolds numbers @xmath19 1000 ) . in our experiments , it is not possible to control ( or vary ) the dominant spatial contribution .",
    "this is probably why we see the robust _ -3 _ subrange for turbulent bubbly flow in a wide variety of conditions ( @xmath9 ) over 2 - 3 orders magnitude change in the @xmath8 parameter .",
    "hence , the _ -3",
    "_ spectrum scaling seems to be a generic feature in turbulent bubbly flow .",
    "remarkably , the _ -3 _ spectrum scaling is followed even at very small @xmath8 parameter values ( @xmath97 ) ; i.e. when the void fraction is as low as 0.1@xmath29 . hence , the bubbles are able to modify the spectra very efficiently , even though they are present in small numbers , due to the long lifetime of their wakes . however , at extremely small bubble concentrations @xmath98 0.1@xmath29 and @xmath99 the kolmogorov - like single - phase spectrum should be recovered , but we have no hint when this will happen .",
    "it would be relevant to find this transition in future work .",
    "the bubble concentration of the transition regime may be so small that optical methods like laser doppler anemometry ( lda ) or particle image velocimetry ( piv ) may become applicable , and even numerical approaches with fully - resolved wakes might be suitable for this purpose . in any case , it will be interesting to test until what limit of the @xmath8 parameter the _ -3 _ scaling still holds .",
