    "the discovery of the high temperature superconductivity ( htsc ) in layered perovskites has stimulated many theoretical studies that range from phenomenological approaches to microscopic models .",
    "some of them follow the traditional fermi liquid picture with a bcs @xcite or eliashberg @xcite formulations , while others , often focusing on the new electronic fluids , use to follow the so called marginal @xcite and nearly antiferromagnetic fermi liquids @xcite .",
    "however , up to date a fully consistent interpretation of the large amount of existing experimental data is not found in the literature and further efforts are needed for the understanding of the pairing mechanism in cuprate perovskites . in this context , it is important to compare the thermodynamic functions of these new compounds and the old layered superconductors with low critical temperatures , looking for similarities and differences between them .    the cuprate perovskites are layered materials with highly anisotropic properties which show an almost dispersionless electronic bands with flat sections in the vicinity of the fermi level ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "this leads to the appearance of the so called van hove singularities ( vhs ) in the electronic density of states ( edos ) @xcite . on the other hand , in these compounds the possibility of gap symmetries different from the s - wave one",
    "is a matter of debate up to now @xcite .",
    "one of the first attempts to explain the great variety of behaviors experimentally observed was the bcs model within the vhs scenario using the s - wave symmetry for the order parameter @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , several experiments , such as tricrystal corner junction tunnelling in @xmath4 @xcite show strong evidence that the gap symmetry was dominated by a @xmath5 component . following these ideas and in the framework of the bcs model , in refs.@xcite ,",
    "the temperature dependence of the gap , the ratio @xmath6 and the specific heat @xmath0 as a function of temperature were calculated . while this approach seems to yield results more close to the observed experimental behavior of those magnitudes , several reports ( see @xcite and references therein ) are very hard to explain in terms of purely symmetry states . in this sense , recent experiments on c axis tunneling in the @xmath7 system @xcite ( and references therein ) reveals that the superconducting order parameter should have a small s wave contribution in addition to the d wave one . with that aim , in refs .",
    "@xcite the phase diagram for the @xmath8 and @xmath9 gaps as a function of the filling factor and the driving parameter @xmath10 were studied in the framework of the bcs model .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to study the effects of the symmetry mixing of the gap on the thermodynamic functions as the electronic specific heat @xmath0 and the critical magnetic field @xmath1 within the weak coupling van hove bcs ( v - bcs ) model .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "2 the theoretical background and gap symmetries are introduced within the van hove singularity scenario . in sec .",
    "3 the thermodynamic functions of the superconducting material as a function of temperature are obtained . finally , in sec .",
    "4 the main conclusions of the paper will be given .",
    "in agreement with the layered structure of the new superconducting materials we start from a tight binding formulation of the band structure with the following dispersion law : @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the coupling parameter between the cu and o atoms , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the components of the wavevector , and @xmath15 is the lattice constant .",
    "this band model leads to a density of states similar to that obtained in ref.@xcite .",
    "furthermore , we have considered the weak coupling limit of the bcs theory including gap symmetries different from the often used s- or d- waves as well as its possible mixing .",
    "we are discussing mainly the mixed @xmath8 and @xmath9 cases which seem to be closest to experimental results .",
    "the tetragonal lattice symmetry assumed in the band structure will impose restrictions on the possible forms of @xmath16 and for the gap the following expression are assumed @xcite : @xmath17 with @xmath18 the term @xmath19 in eq.([gap ] ) enables one to fix the relative phase between the s and d symmetries .",
    "for @xmath20 we are dealing with the @xmath8 mixing for which the order parameter is a real quantity , while for @xmath21 the @xmath9 mixing a complex order parameter is presented . on the other hand , two different critical temperatures , @xmath22 and @xmath23 should appear in agreement with the respective symmetries of the gap , so that the critical temperature of the whole superconductor will be the maximum among these two values @xmath24 . which of the two symmetries is responsible for the critical temperature depends on many factors @xcite as for example , at higher filling values the @xmath25 gap",
    "is favored , while for lower filling factor we have a pure s - gap @xcite .",
    "irrespective of the conditions favoring one or another gap symmetry mixing we are interested on the influence of this on the thermodynamic functions . with this purpose and to simulate how the material evolves from s to d - wave , the following equations for @xmath26 are used : @xmath27 + 1 } , \\\\",

    "@xmath29 and @xmath30 correspond to the nearly s- and d - wave gaps , respectively .",
    "this model is consistent with results obtained in refs.@xcite where three regions are well defined .",
    "two of them have a dominant gap symmetry , s or d and the third one a mixture of these two symmetries . on the other hand , and",
    "irrespective of the gap symmetry assumed , we denote by @xmath31 the temperature dependence of the gap which with a good accuracy can be represented by the following relation @xcite : @xmath32 . \\label{gaptemp}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is worth noticing that the function @xmath31 differs slightly from the correct bcs dependence and the slope at @xmath26 is about 1.6 times the true one .",
    "since the thermodynamics of any superconductor is governed by the concrete topology of the quasiparticle excitation energy , in fig.1 the contour lines generated by the surface @xmath33 are plotted for the s - wave ( upper left ) and d - wave ( upper right ) pure symmetry cases as well as the @xmath8-wave ( bottom left ) and @xmath9-wave ( bottom right ) mixing at zero temperature .",
    "the contour lines of the symmetry mixing cases are plotted considering the d - wave component as the dominant one and assuming @xmath34 . in all cases , @xmath35 is expressed in units of @xmath36 as a function of the dimensionless wave vectors components @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "as can be seen from these pictures , the function @xmath35 does not have zeros in the pure s - wave case while for the d - symmetry isolated zeros at ( @xmath39 ) are present .",
    "these zeros lead to qualitatively different results in the behavior of thermodynamic quantities at low temperatures . while for a s - wave gap an exponential attenuation in @xmath0 is expected in agreement with the activation character of the quasiparticle spectrum , for the d - wave case a power law follows , due to the absence of any threshold . concerning the mixing of symmetries",
    ", it is clear that the @xmath8 and @xmath9 gaps should lead to a different character form of the thermodynamic functions .",
    "since the symmetry of the contours associated with the @xmath8 mixing is lower than the tetragonal one this kind of mixture is more suitable for lattice with a small ortorhombic distortion , as for example in the @xmath40 system .",
    "from experimental point of view a double peak transition in the specific heat ( @xmath0)has been observed for ybco @xcite . in ref.@xcite",
    "a double step at 88 k and 92 k were reported by adiabatic continuum method . moreover , in refs.@xcite a review of the experimental evidences about the double transition in @xmath0 for @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) system has been presented .",
    "these experimental facts are in correspondence with the mixed gap scenario . starting from the above motivation in this section we are dealing with the specific heat in the superconducting state and the thermodynamic critical magnetic field taking into account the gap symmetry mixing .",

    "hence , in order to observe the @xmath8 symmetry the critical temperatures for the both components ( @xmath53 and @xmath54 ) must be the same .",
    "it is important to remark that this result have nothing to do with the edos or any criteria of stability for the phase under certain crystalline symmetry . for the @xmath9 mixing the square root singularity does not appear , because the relative phase between the two components of the gap is equal to @xmath55 and the cosine function in eq.([dergap ] )",
    "further we shall deal with the influence of the @xmath9 mixing on @xmath2 and @xmath56 .    transforming the sum into integrals over the first brillouin zone and applying similar methods as in ref .",

    "the integration limits over @xmath63 ( lower @xmath64 and upper @xmath65 ) are defined as follows : for @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 , while for @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 . for numerical evaluation",
    ", the values @xmath72 ( @xmath73 ) and @xmath74 ( @xmath75 ) have been used .",
    "the function @xmath76 is a measure of the edos for the respective symmetries of the gap as it can be seen by the following integrals @xcite : @xmath77",
    "@xmath78 coincides with the exact edos of the tight binding model on the square lattice , given by a complete elliptic integral of the first kind ( see ref.@xcite ) and @xmath79 could be regarded as an effective edos for the d - wave pairing .",
    "the dependence of @xmath80 ( @xmath81 is the specific heat in the normal state ) on the reduced temperature @xmath52 is presented in fig.2 for @xmath29 and @xmath82 .",
    "the first case corresponds to a nearly pure s - wave while the second has a d - wave character .",
    "as can be seen from this picture the jump due to the s - wave gap at @xmath26 is smaller than that of the d - wave one .",
    "this is in contrast with the conventional anisotropic superconductors , where the specific heat jump in the isotropic case is larger than that for the anisotropic one @xcite .",
    "the above fact is explained as follows .",
    "taking into account eqs.([gap - s ] ) , ( [ gap - d ] ) , and ( [ gaptemp ] ) the specific heat jump can be written as : @xmath83\\ \\ \\   & ; \\ \\ \\ \\mbox{d - wave } \\\\   &",

    "n_{s}(\\xi ) \\ f(|\\xi |)\\ [ 1-f(|\\xi |)]\\ \\ \\   &   ; \\ \\ \\ \\mbox{s - wave } \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] we note that the term @xmath84 is the same for both symmetries .",
    "the square of the cosine difference appearing in the edos @xmath79 for the d - wave case plays a key role for the understanding of the difference of @xmath85 between the two symmetries .",
    "it is important to note that @xmath86 function has a stronger singularity than that coming from the s - wave gap explaining why the @xmath87 value for d - waves is larger than the corresponding to the s - symmetry . in the inset",
    "a comparison between the s- and d - wave specific heats at low temperature is shown .    the evolution in term of the driven parameter @xmath28 for the temperature dependence of @xmath88 is shown in fig.3 .",
    "for @xmath89 the s - wave gap is dominant ( see fig.3(a ) ) , while for @xmath90 the @xmath26 is ruled out by the d - wave ( see fig.3(b ) ) .",
    "the double peak transition is better seen for @xmath91 . in fig.3(a ) ( fig.3(b ) ) the peaks numbered by 1 to 4 ( 1 to 3 ) correspond to the d - wave ( s - wave ) contribution .",
    "the results depicted in figs.3(a ) and ( b ) constitute a direct consequence of the difference in the jump @xmath87 for the mixed symmetries .",
    "these results are qualitatively in good agreement with those reported in @xcite where a double peak transition has been observed .",
    "it is worth noticing that in recent measurements on @xmath92 @xcite this structure apparently seems to be absent .",
    "nevertheless , these data show , for certain values of oxygen concentration , a small feature that could be interpreted in the framework of the mixed waves scenario .",
    "the behavior of @xmath88 at very low temperatures is depicted in fig.4 for values of @xmath93 , where the d - wave contribution is dominant .",
    "the quadratic behavior observed in a wide range of temperatures for the d - wave case is in contrast with the linear dependence obtained in ref .",
    "this quadratic law is consistent with the experimental measurements of ref.@xcite and the phenomenological approach which assumes a linear dependence on energy for the edos in the superconducting state .",
    "as soon as @xmath28 reaches the values 0.52 , in the low temperature region @xmath88 goes through a small and broad shoulder around @xmath94 superposed onto the quadratic behavior law .",
    "this anomaly seems to be related with the concrete topology of the gap directly reflected in the lines of constant quasiparticle energy @xmath35 of the d - wave superconductor .",
    "it appears only when the van hove and the d - wave gap are simultaneously present , otherwise they can not appear .    the thermodynamic critical magnetic field as a function of temperature can be obtained from the usual bcs expression @xcite . in fig.5 the dependence of the reduced critical magnetic field @xmath95 on the reduced temperature @xmath52",
    "is shown for different values of @xmath28 parameter .",
    "as can be seen see in fig.5(a ) , for @xmath96 the s - wave component is dominant and the phase transition to a single symmetry state is clearly observed . here ,",
    "the slope at @xmath26 associated with the s - wave gap is lower than that coming from the conventional bcs . moreover , when the d - wave component is dominant the phase transition is almost unobservable and the temperature dependence in this case shows an small departure from the old parabolic law ( compare figs.5(a ) and ( b ) ) .",
    "this quasi - parabolic law in the d - wave case is a direct consequence of the zeros in the quasiparticle excitation energy , which also provides a power law in the low temperature regime of the specific heat ( see inset in fig.2 ) .",
    "a toy model within a van hove bcs scenario which takes into account the existence of mixing of gap symmetries has been developed . within this framework the specific heat dependence on the temperature was computed resulting in a double peak transition whose resolution is very sensitive to the amount of the d - wave component present in the gap . for a pure d - wave gap , a quadratic law at low temperatures with a superposed shoulder at @xmath94 is obtained . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath97 jump at @xmath98 of the pure d - wave component is larger than that coming from an s - wave one .",
    "these features are due to the joint effect of the gap anisotropy and van hove singularity .",
    "it is expected that the influence of anisotropy will be reinforced in those directions where it is allocated .",
    "our calculations show that the critical magnetic field follows a quasi - parabolic law with temperature which results from the isolated zeros in the quasiparticle excitation energy . the anisotropy effect along with the van hove singularity establish a qualitative difference with respect to old conventional superconductors where a constant edos is considered .",
    "moreover , it seems that a model with a dominant d - wave contribution plus an small s - wave component may show a closes fitting with the reported experimental measurements .",
