    "in this section we present the parameterization used for the hopping amplitudes between the @xmath79 and @xmath80orbitals in the presence of octahedral rotation and tilting with respect to the @xmath37-axis .",
    "furthermore , we provide extra details about the methodology adopted for determining the phase diagram of the @xmath0 orbitally degenerate double - exchange model including the case with interorbital coulomb interaction .    in order to analyze the role played by octahedral distortions",
    ", we have determined the modification of the hopping amplitudes between the orbitals involved on a distorted bond by means of the slater - koster rules @xcite .",
    "since the integrals that appear in the hopping term rapidly decrease as a function of the distance between the two selected atoms , one can restrict the analysis to nearest neighbor sites .",
    "let us then consider a single two - center tm@xmath81-o ( transition metal - oxygen ) bond with tm@xmath81 located at @xmath82 and o at @xmath83 , respectively . following ref .",
    "@xcite , we take wannier orbitals with respect to a set of rectangular axes along the undistorted tm@xmath81-o bonds",
    ". then , the integrals between @xmath84 @xmath85 and d@xmath86 orbitals are parameterized in terms of the overlap amplitudes between the @xmath87 and @xmath88 ones and the distance between the pairs of sites is taken into account with respect to the tm1-o angle .",
    "for the latter , the direction cosines of the vector @xmath89 , pointing from one atom to the other , are given by @xmath90 with respect to the symmetry axes .",
    "the values of the needed matrix elements can be taken directly from the table in ref .",
    "for instance , the integrals between two representatives cases of @xmath91- and @xmath92-orbitals which are of interest for the model considered here can be expressed as @xmath93 with @xmath94 [ @xmath95 being the overlap integral between the @xmath96 and @xmath97 [ @xmath98 and @xmath99 orbitals .",
    "these integrals generally depend on the distance between the two considered atoms .",
    "similar expressions can be obtained for all the @xmath84 @xmath85 and @xmath100 orbitals @xcite .      using these amplitudes",
    ", we can determine for the undistorted bond the effective hopping between neighboring transition metal ions .",
    "as in the manuscript , we employ @xmath21 to indicate the @xmath22 orbitals which are perpendicular to the corresponding bond direction with @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 being the unit vectors along the lattice symmetry directions . then , the effective hopping between the @xmath14 orbitals along the @xmath23 axis is given by @xmath101 and the same is for @xmath102 . in the absence of distortions",
    "it is immediate to verify that @xmath103 . for the computational analysis",
    ", we assume the ratio of the overlap integrals to be @xmath104 that is of an order of magnitude that is common to layered oxides .",
    "then , for the undistorted case we set @xmath33 for the in - plane hopping with @xmath34 being our unit of energy . for the @xmath4-@xmath105 orbitals a similar calculation gives a tetragonal hopping equal to @xmath106 .",
    "let us consider the expression of the effective hopping when the octahedra has a tilting @xmath53 with respect to the @xmath37-axis . in this configuration ,",
    "the m1-o - m2 bond angle is different from @xmath107 and thus more than one cosine direction enters in the effective hopping calculation .",
    "the result for the in - plane hopping can be expressed as @xmath108 where @xmath109 and @xmath110 are proportional to @xmath111 and @xmath112 , respectively .",
    "similar expressions can be obtained for the rotation of the octahedra and for the effective hoppings along the other m - o bond directions . in fig .",
    "[ fig : hop ] we have reported the evolution of the hopping amplitudes along the various symmetry directions involving the @xmath13 and @xmath14 orbitals scaled to the undistorted unit @xmath34 .",
    "as one can note , the tilting of the octahedra mainly affects the off - diagonal hopping along the @xmath37-axis , i.e. t@xmath113 , which grows from zero up to about @xmath114 at @xmath115 . with respect to the undistorted configuration",
    "the diagonal hopping matrix elements exhibit a reduction of 40@xmath116 when , for instance , @xmath53 varies between 0 and 20@xmath117 .",
    "the tilt considered in this paper is staggered and has a four - sublattice structure differing by the sign of the tilt angle or the tilt axis being either @xmath118 or @xmath119 .",
    "this does not affect the absulute values of the hopping amplitudes on different bonds but induces alternating signs .",
    "in this case however the alternation is such that it can be easily canceled by a proper gauge transformation of the fermion operators on a chosen sublattice .",
    "-space of the ( a ) z3 phase and ( b ) c3 phase , respectively .",
    "different colors of the small squares denote sites with up and down spin polarization .",
    "the elementary cells are marked with thick lines with bright blue color .",
    "all the unit cells contain a second layer for the bilayered structure having either the same or an opposite spin polarization .",
    "[ zc_cells ] ]    since there are no qualitative differences with the results presented in the main text , we report here for completeness the modification of the phase diagram at @xmath47 in the presence of another channel of electronic itinerancy that is isotropic in the @xmath120 plane .",
    "this type of process can mimic the valence fluctuation at the site of the transition metal atom , for instance induced by substitutional doping , by adding an e@xmath121-@xmath105 orbital to the de model .",
    "the selection of the e@xmath121-@xmath105 orbital would be dictated by the octahedral distortions .",
    "due to the possibility of @xmath105 electrons to propagate along the whole zigzag path , there is a gain in kinetic energy that removes the degeneracy between the @xmath7 and @xmath10 configurations with a dominance of the zigzag state in the doping range of about @xmath122 $ ] ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] ) .",
    "the @xmath8 phase region almost disappears and checkerboard states with large domain sizes can get stabilized in the low and high doping region of the diagram . the af energy scale is modified here as it reflects the difference in the amplitude of the @xmath123 and @xmath87 hybridizations      let us discuss the methodology applied for the determination of the one dimensional ( 1d ) and two dimensional ( 2d ) phase diagram of the @xmath0 double - exchange model ( eq.1 in the main text ) .",
    "we start from the noninteracting case at @xmath47 . for the diagonalization of the matrix hamiltonian in the reciprocal @xmath124-space",
    "we have used appropriate unit cells to reproduce the zig - zag and checkerboard patterns ( fig . [",
    "zc_cells ] ) .",
    "the simulation has been performed for a finite size system by having @xmath125 elements in the direction of the basis vector @xmath126 and @xmath127 along @xmath128 .",
    "these cells are always selected in such a way that the whole lattice is approximately a square of the size @xmath129 where @xmath130 , for the computation , is typically taken to be equal to @xmath131 sites for the case of periodic boundary conditions .",
    "a special case is the one of the undistorted lattice where due to special symmetry of the matrix hamiltonian a simulation with @xmath130 up to @xmath132 sites can be easily achieved . in order to test the dependence of the results on the size of the lattice ,",
    "clusters with up to @xmath133 sites have been employed .",
    "the diagonalization of the hamiltonian within a single unit cell at given @xmath126 and @xmath128 is done by a canonical transformation and then the ground state energy is obtained by filling the energy levels up to the fermi level according to the doping concentration @xmath38 .",
    "for the undistorted case the canonical transformation involves only sites lying along one line .",
    "thus , it is possible to study checkerboard phases with very large unit cells since the matrices that have to be diagonalized are of the order of @xmath134 where @xmath42 is the size of a single fm domain .",
    "concerning the case in the presence of distortion , such transformation involves a matrix of size @xmath135 which significantly limits the maximal @xmath42 that can be computed . in the case of the 1d patterns when only the @xmath48 and the @xmath8 phases are considered",
    ", we use a very similar unit cell as the one shown in fig . [",
    "zc_cells ] ( a ) , but with only one zig - zag segment inside the cell corresponding to a specific spin polarization .",
    "for such circumstance , the simulation is performed with number of cells @xmath127 along the @xmath128 direction in such a way that the total length of the chain is not smaller than @xmath136 .    finally , we provide further technical details about the methodology and the approach employed to determine the ground state diagram when the interorbital coulomb interaction is added .",
    "we use an exact diagonalization study based on the lanczos algorithm and we simulate zigzag and checkerboard patterns with different size length . concerning the zigzag patterns , we take advantage of the conservation of charge within one segment that follows from the density - density nature of the interaction and the absence of the interorbital hopping in the undistorted system .",
    "one segment of the z@xmath42 phase contains @xmath42 @xmath137-orbital sites connected by the hopping @xmath34 and @xmath138 @xmath139-orbital sites that contribute only through the occupation energy ( and interlayer hopping if we deal with the bilayer system ) .",
    "thus , the problem of a z@xmath42-chain maps into that of interacting molecules containing @xmath140 pseudospins with @xmath141 where the total @xmath142 is conserved in each molecule . for the presented calculations we take the following total numbers of segments @xmath143 for a given unit length @xmath42 , i.e. , the pairs of @xmath144 : @xmath145 , @xmath146 , @xmath147 , @xmath148 , @xmath149 , @xmath150 and @xmath151 . for the straight chain",
    "the number of @xmath13 and @xmath14-orbital sites is the same and equal to the chain length @xmath130 that we assume to be @xmath152 .",
    "the magnetizations in the zigzag segments and the occupations of the non - active orbitals are good quantum numbers in the problem .",
    "hence , for each system we can directly determine the lowest energies in all the subspaces identified by the previous mentioned quantities .",
    "all the systems are solved with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we use the translation invariance to reduce the total number of configurations . in case of the checkerboard phases the approach is similar ; checkerboard cell of the size @xmath66 consists of @xmath153 molecules of @xmath42 pseudospins @xmath141 interacting by a density - density interaction that conserves the total @xmath142 .",
    "both orbitals are itinerant in the basic unit cell , thus the orbital occupations are not conserved quantities .",
    "the uniform fm phase is simulated by the largest checkerboard cell considered here , which is @xmath154 assuming periodic boundary conditions .",
    "such methodology is particularly beneficial for obtaining the ground state of a given quantum problem without any specific bias in dealing with the interacting term .",
    "furthermore , we expect that the finiteness of the system does not affect qualitatively the results because the noninteracting zigzag and checkerboard states are insulating and the gap in the energy spectrum leads to short - range quantum correlations that limit the size effects . still , for the checkerboard configurations the approach is particularly suited because we consider the charge as confined in each spin - polarized island due to the large hund coupling and only virtual processes can occur between neighbor blocks .",
    "on the other hand , the symmetry of the zigzag problem limits the hilbert space for the computational analysis as even in the presence of the coulomb interaction the total charge is conserved within each zigzag unit .",
    "we focus the analysis on the monolayer system with tetragonal symmetry because it allows to simulate zigzag and checkerboard with larger size and it is more appropriate to capture the competition between short zigzag and the checkerboard states in the regime of doping close to x=0 where the effects of the interorbital interaction are more relevant .",
    "this regime is indeed the case of dense interorbital occupation as the number of minority spins for site is close to one .",

    "<S> fm and af - fmc denote fm / af layers with fm @xmath37-axis alignment . </S>",
    "<S> unlabeled regions are z@xmath42 and c@xmath42 phases with @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> the parameters used are at @xmath57 : @xmath58 and @xmath59=0.8 @xmath34 ( for @xmath55 see ref . ) . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig4 ] ]    in order to address the role of dimensionality we consider a double - layered system for a representative value of tetragonal anisotropy , i.e. @xmath59=0.8 @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> the results are obtained assuming the hund coupling as the dominant energy scale , i.e. @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> smaller values of @xmath35 ( i.e. @xmath61 and @xmath62 ) have also been considered and modify the diagram by reducing the area of stability of large size z@xmath42 and c@xmath42 patterns , slightly shifting the boundaries of the @xmath7 and @xmath10 phases . </S>",
    "<S> search for spin patterns has been also performed in representative points of the diagram by means of montecarlo simulations employing the metropolis algorithm . </S>",
    "<S> this analysis confirms the zigzag and checkerboard phases as the dominant ones . as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig4 ] , fm and af - fmc states occur at small and large @xmath36 amplitudes . </S>",
    "<S> the af - fmc is made of af layers coupled ferromagnetically . </S>",
    "<S> the high doping regime , i.e. @xmath63 , exhibits a major tendency towards @xmath8 phase ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig1](b ) ) , which may be relevant for layered systems with hole doped mn@xmath64 manganites or vanadates  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> since the @xmath29 band does not hybridize along the @xmath37-direction , the effective af coupling is vanishing and the interlayer ferromagnetism is always favored , except close to @xmath65 due to the pauli principle . as expected from the 1d study , the @xmath7 zigzag states ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig1](a ) ) , are energetically favorable . </S>",
    "<S> however , they are quasi degenerate with checkerboard states ( c@xmath42 ) , made of @xmath66 fm clusters that are coupled antiferromagnetically ( fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : fig1](c ) for the @xmath10 configuration ) . </S>",
    "<S> this result primarily arises from the fact the @xmath7 and @xmath10 electronic spectra are identical in the unit block due to the @xmath0 orbital directionality . </S>",
    "<S> the coupling between af spin domains brings corrections of the order of @xmath67 in the dispersion and is responsible for the degeneracy removal and the cascade of doping induced transitions between @xmath7 and @xmath10 .     ( a ) and @xmath68 ( b ) . ]    rotation and tilting of the octahedra with respect to the @xmath37-axis are the main processes that break the orbital directionality of the @xmath6 orbitals . to study their consequences we have employed a general approach based on the slater - koster rules  @xcite the rotation does not modify the phase diagram boundaries because the hopping matrix transformation for the @xmath6 can be gauged away in the kinetic term . </S>",
    "<S> then , it can only lead to transitions via a renormalization of @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> the tilting mixes @xmath6 orbitals @xcite and thus breaks the directional disconnection resulting in the removal of the quasi - degeneracy between the zigzag and checkerboard states ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig4 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the effects are more evident close to @xmath69 where tilting favors the @xmath10 state . moreover , by reducing the interlayer diagonal hopping it makes @xmath7 appearing at a lower doping down to @xmath70 as in the 1d case .    </S>",
    "<S> we now discuss the role played by the @xmath15 interorbital coulomb interaction  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we notice that @xmath15 is manifestly distinct for the zigzag and checkerboard patterns as due to the interplay of the pattern configuration and @xmath0 directionality . in the checkerboards @xmath15 frustrates the confined @xmath6 charge motion in the spin - polarized blocks . on the contrary , in the zigzag </S>",
    "<S> there is an explicit difference for @xmath15 at the inner and the corner sites ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig1 ] ) . to deepen such comparison </S>",
    "<S> we focus on the tetragonal monolayer system . inside the zigzag units one of the two orbitals </S>",
    "<S> is localized and the charge degree of freedom behaves like a classical variable . then , the intra - segment interacting problem maps into the 1d falicov - kimball model @xcite whose itinerant spinless electrons in the active @xmath6 orbitals locally couple to a classical variable describing the density of the inactive ones . at the corner sites , </S>",
    "<S> it is not possible to have a classical behavior and @xmath15 is fully quantum as the orbital electron density varies between zero and one depending on the intra - segment electronic configuration . </S>",
    "<S> the emerging low energy scenario is particularly clear for the z2 state . </S>",
    "<S> one can show that the interacting problem can be exactly mapped into an ising model in a transverse field . </S>",
    "<S> then , the gs is made of domain walls that propagate along the zigzag path controlled by the ratio @xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> such modes generally allow for a kinetic energy gain . for larger zigzag patterns the inner - corner electronic separation leads to enhanced electron - hole correlations at the corner to avoid @xmath15 and </S>",
    "<S> the gs exhibits a tendency to an asymmetric charge distribution inside the zigzag block .    in order to quantitatively account for the role of @xmath15 we employ an exact diagonalization study based on the lanczos algorithm , simulating both zigzag and checkerboard patterns with different cluster size @xcite . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig5 ] we report the phase diagram for the 2d monolayer tetragonal system at @xmath15=0 ( a ) and @xmath68 ( b ) . </S>",
    "<S> a general outcome is that the intrablock kinetic energy is reduced by @xmath15 and increases its competition with the af exchange . </S>",
    "<S> such aspect is particularly relevant for the stability of the checkerboard states as the af energy contribution cancels out for all the zigzag states while , except for c2 , it is detrimental for the checkerboard configurations </S>",
    "<S> . then , the window of stability of the zigzag and checkerboard states shrinks in terms of the @xmath72 ratio . at low doping </S>",
    "<S> the competition is purely of electronic origin as the af exchange is equivalent for the z2 and c2 states . </S>",
    "<S> it is worth pointing out how @xmath15 drives the stability of the z2 state . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath15 tends to kinetically frustrate the electron propagation for both z2 and c2 and this effect is quite strong at low doping . </S>",
    "<S> however , for z2 such constraint can be released by the propagation of the interorbital defects along the zigzag path . </S>",
    "<S> such collective behavior is absent in the checkerboard c2 configuration . </S>",
    "<S> approaching the range of doping where in the noninteracting limit longer zigzag and checkerboard states compete ( e.g. z3 , z4 and c3 ) , we observe that @xmath15 favors the zigzag phases . </S>",
    "<S> this result is a cooperative effect between @xmath15 and @xmath36 because the interaction renormalizes the kinetic energy and then the af exchange can easily overcome the difference in the electronic contribution that makes the checkerboard patterns more favorable in the range of doping close x=0.5 . above half - filling , </S>",
    "<S> the density of minority spins is quite dilute and the coulomb interaction is not much influent . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the coulomb interaction confirms the occurrence of a doping induced mit moving from a very dilute metallic stripe ( @xmath73 ) to intermediate long zigzag ( @xmath74 ) and dense short zigzag patterns ( @xmath75 ) that is akin to an electronic gas - to - liquid - to - crystal changeover . </S>",
    "<S> a distinct feature occurs when considering the charge profile of the zigzag gs . </S>",
    "<S> we find that , among all the zigzags , z3 state exhibits a gs with a charge density wave with nonuniform electron density . </S>",
    "<S> the correlated z3 phase has a charge and orbital ordering that remarkably can yield a nonvanishing electric dipole in each zizag unit making the single zigzag chain prone to a ferroelectric instability .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have determined the spin - charge - orbital modulated patterns that naturally emerge in orbitally directional @xmath0 de systems for an extended range of doping and couplings . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that these results can be of high relevance for understanding the phase diagram of mn - doped layered sr - ruthenates or other oxides where tm substitutions can lead to @xmath76-@xmath77 or @xmath78-@xmath76 charge doping in the @xmath0 sector with a partial localization of one orbital degree of freedom .    </S>",
