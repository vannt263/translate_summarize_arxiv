    "dielectronic recombination ( burgess 1964 ) is the dominant electron  ion recombination process in both photoionized and collisional plasmas .",
    "extensive theoretical data is available for all k- and l - shell ions of all elements up to zn , and selected heavy elements beyond , following the work of badnell ( 2003 ) , and is available online .",
    "these data , including radiative recombination ( rr ) , have been used to provide new ionization balances for both electron collisional ( bryans 2006 ) and photoionized plasmas ( ferland 2006 ) .",
    "extensive benchmarking has taken place against experiment for both low-@xmath8 ( c , n , o ) and higher-@xmath8 elements ( fe , ni )  see e.g. fogle ( 2005 ) and savin ( 2006 ) , and references therein .",
    "work on the m - shell is sparse ( beyond the simple na - like sequence , linkemann 1995 , fogle 2003 ) . yet , m - shell fe ions are ubiquitous in astrophysics .",
    "it has become clear recently that dielectronic recombination ( dr ) rate coefficients for fe @xmath9 ions ( fe@xmath6  fe@xmath7 ) are highly questionable at temperatures where these ions form in photoionized plasmas ( @xmath5  k , say , kallman and bautista 2001 ) .",
    "this stems from the inability of photoionized plasma modelling codes such as ion ( netzer 2004 ) and cloudy ( kraemer 2004 ) to model the iron m - shell unresolved - transition - array absorption feature observed in the x - ray spectrum of many active galactic nuclei .",
    "the situation can be improved by changing the ionization balance for these fe ions at such temperatures , as first suggested by netzer ( 2003 ) , and which is achieved by increasing the dielectronic recombination rate coefficients by large factors ( e.g. , 2  4 ) . that this is a plausible approach",
    "has been verified experimentally for fe@xmath0 by schmidt ( 2006 ) who carried - out high - energy resolution dr measurements at the heidelberg test storage ring ( tsr ) .",
    "they deduced a maxwellian recombination rate coefficient which is up to an order of magnitude larger than that recommended by arnaud & raymond ( 1992 ) and mazzotta ( 1998 ) at photoionized plasma temperatures , and which is currently used to determine the ionization balance of iron in ion and cloudy , and other photoionized plasma modelling codes such as xstar ( kallman and bautista 2001 ) .",
    "the reason for this difference is that the existing theoretical dielectronic recombination contribution ( jacobs 1977 ) to the total recombination rate coefficient falls - off exponentially below @xmath10  ev and the total is dominated by direct radiative recombination .",
    "a similar problem was noted by mller ( 1999 ) for fe@xmath11 and it is prevelant also for l - shell ions , following the pioneering work of savin ( 1997 ) .",
    "the approach of jacobs ( 1977 ) is based upon the ` no - coupling ' scheme , allows only for dipole core - excitations in the dielectronic capture process and pays no detailed attention to the positioning of near - threshold resonances .",
    "it should be noted that the work of jacobs ( 1977 ) was motivated by applications to high - temperature electron collision dominated plasmas and , for such , their approach is quite reasonable .",
    "it is clear , however , that the dr of fe@xmath0 needs to be re - examined for application to photoionized plasmas .",
    "such a re - examination , including a comparison with the results of the measurements by schmidt ( 2006 ) , will provide a benchmark for other fe @xmath9 ions , and the m - shell more generally .",
    "the outline of the rest of this paper is as follows : in section 2 we describe our theoretical approach ; in section 3 we make a detailed study of the structure of fe@xmath0 ; in section 4 we compare our velocity - convoluted dr cross sections with those from the experiment by schmidt ( 2006 ) ; and in section 5 we compare various maxwellian recombination rate coefficients .",
    "we have used autostructure ( badnell 1987 , 1997 ) to carry - out a series of multi - configuration breit ",
    "pauli calculations of dielectronic recombination cross sections and rate coefficients .",
    "the method implemented within autostructure is the independent processes , isolated resonances using distorted waves ( ipirdw ) approach to dr .",
    "a detailed discussion of the validity of this approach is given by pindzola 1992 ) while its advantages from a ( collisional  radiative ) modelling perspective is discussed by badnell ( 2003 ) .",
    "let @xmath12 denote the partial dielectronic recombination cross section , as a function of center - of - mass energy @xmath13 , from an initial metastable state @xmath14 of an ion @xmath15 , through an autoionizing state @xmath16 , into a resolved final state @xmath17 of an ion @xmath18 , then @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the lorentzian line shape of the resonance ( energy - normalized to unity ) . here",
    ", @xmath21 denotes the integrated ( partial ) dielectronic recombination cross section , which is given by @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the statistical weight of the @xmath24-electron doubly - excited resonance state @xmath16 , @xmath25 is the statistical weight of the @xmath26-electron target state ( so , @xmath27 , where @xmath8 is the nuclear charge ) and the autoionization ( @xmath28 ) and radiative ( @xmath29 ) rates are in inverse seconds . here",
    ", @xmath30 is the energy of the continuum electron ( with orbital angular momentum @xmath31 ) , which is fixed by the position of the resonance @xmath16 relative to the continuum @xmath14 , @xmath32 is the ionization potential energy of the hydrogen atom ( both in the same units of energy ) and @xmath33 @xmath34s .",
    "a powerful aspect of the ipirdw approach is that the use of equation ( [ lor ] ) enables an analytic integration over the resonance profiles to be carried - out .",
    "this is in contrast to an @xmath35-matrix calculation which must map - out the detailed resonance structure numerically .",
    "this in itself is more demanding for dr than for electron - impact excitation since a much finer energy mesh is needed to map - out all resonances which contribute significantly to the cross section  see gorczyca ( 2002 ) for a detailed study and discussion of the issue .",
    "so , let @xmath36 denote the corresponding energy - averaged ( partial ) dielectronic recombination cross section , then @xmath37 here , @xmath38 denotes the bin width energy , which is chosen so as to be large compared to the lorentzian width and small compared to the characteristic width of any subsequent convolution ; otherwise , the choice of @xmath38 is arbitrary and it is usually taken to be a constant .",
    "then , @xmath39 thus , for a fixed @xmath16 and @xmath14 , the energy - averaged partial dr cross section takes - on a non - zero value at a single energy , @xmath40 , including when summed - over final states @xmath17 .",
    "most applications involve a sum over resonance levels @xmath16 and it is convenient to ` bin ' the cross section via @xmath41 where @xmath42 .",
    "the sum over @xmath17 is over all final states which lie below the ionization limit and which may include cascade through autoionizing levels , although a single cascade ( i.e. a two - step radiative stabilization ) is usually more than sufficient . for total rate coefficients , applicable low - density plasmas , the sums over @xmath17 and @xmath16 are taken to convergence but for application to laboratory measurements the sum over @xmath17 ( and hence , in practice , @xmath16 ) is truncated .",
    "merged - beams measurements utilizing an electron - cooler determine a rate coefficient for the dielectronic recombination process . to compare with a measurement at an electron  ion centre - of - mass energy @xmath43",
    ", we determine a corresponding theoretical rate coefficient , @xmath44 , formally given by @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the merged - beams electron velocity distribution in the center - of - mass frame of the ions and @xmath47 , since the electrons are moving non - relativistically with mass @xmath48 , the mass of the ion @xmath49 .",
    "the experimental velocity distribution , @xmath46 , is a ` flattened maxwellian ' ( dittner 1986 ) which is characterized by two parameters , a ` parallel ' temperature @xmath50 and ` perpendicular ' temperature @xmath51 , with @xmath52 : @xmath53 % \\\\",

    "note , at high energies , @xmath57 , @xmath46 reduces to an effective gaussian distribution with a full - width at half - maximum of @xmath58 .    for a bin width that is much smaller than the energy resolution of the experiment , and on using the distribution given by equation ( [ exp2 ] )",
    ", we can write equation ( [ exp1 ] ) in terms of the energy - averaged cross sections and bin energies , @xmath59 : @xmath60\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath61^{1/2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath62^{1/2}\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] recall , @xmath63 has units of @xmath34 .",
    "writing @xmath64 , we have that @xmath65 cm s@xmath66 is the relevant remaining constant which defines the rate coefficient .    in measurements carried - out at storage rings ,",
    "the ions are circulated long enough , and the densities are low enough , for the ion population to be concentrated in the ground state , normally . in single - pass measurements",
    "it is necessary to calculate dr cross sections for metastable levels as well and then to combine them using experimental metastable fractions , if possible , or , typically , to use fractions for which the resulting cross section best matches the measured .",
    "recombined ions with high principal quantum numbers are re - ionized by the strong electric field present in the charge - state analyzer which is used to separate the recombined ions from the original ion beam , and so are not counted as recombined ions .",
    "a ` hard ' cut - off at @xmath67 , given by the hydrogenic expression ( bethe and salpeter 1957 ) @xmath68 where @xmath69 ( v / cm ) is the field strength , often suffices .",
    "sometimes , however , recombined ions with @xmath70 have time to radiatively stabilize to @xmath71 during the time - of - flight ( @xmath72 ) from the cooler to the analyzer and so survive to be counted .",
    "this is modelled theoretically through the use of a ` soft ' or ` delayed ' cut - off ( zong 1998 , schippers 2001 ) .",
    "a soft cut - off simply imposes a higher effective @xmath67 based - upon the lifetime of the rydberg states .",
    "the delayed cut - off approach determines , for @xmath70 , the lifetime of each rydberg state ( usually hydrogenic ) , @xmath73 , and multiplies each @xmath74 partial dr cross section by a survival probability , given by @xmath75\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath76 is the time - of - flight for the passage through the merged - beams section of the cooler .",
    "it is often the case that @xmath77 for the contributing @xmath74 and so , to a good approximation , @xmath78 i.e. , independent of the cooler time - of - flight .",
    "the shortest lifetimes are for the lowest @xmath70 and lowest @xmath31 since the latter can radiate @xmath79 to the lowest possible @xmath80-states .",
    "thus , the final result is relatively insensitive to the range of @xmath70 considered , provided that there no other magnets resulting - in significant cut - offs .",
    "a more elaborate , experimental set - up dependent , approach is described by schippers ( 2001 ) which takes account of the cooler geometry and the position of the various magnets and their fields as they impinge upon the recombined ions along their path to ultimate survival to be counted as recombined , or not . in addition , field ionization rates , due to damburg and kolosov ( 1979 ) , are calculated explicitly .",
    "the usual expression for the maxwellian partial dr rate coefficient ( e.g. badnell 2003 ) can be obtained simply from the corresponding integrated dr cross section , given by equation ( [ pdri ] ) : @xmath81 where @xmath82 @xmath83 .",
    "trivially , it can also be determined from the energy - averaged dr cross section , @xmath84 , for @xmath85 , on substituting for @xmath21 in equation ( [ maxe ] ) from equation ( [ bine ] ) .",
    "total dr - plus - rr rate coefficients are required for plasma modelling .",
    "we determine the rr contribution also using autostructure , following badnell and seaton ( 2003 ) and badnell ( 2006 ) .",
    "it is convenient often for modelling purposes to fit the total ( maxwellian ) dr rate coefficient , @xmath86 , to the following functional form : @xmath87 where the @xmath88 are in the units of temperature , @xmath89 , ( ev or k ) and the units of @xmath90 are then @xmath91[ev or k]@xmath92 .",
    "the same is also true for rr , for which we use the usual ( verner and ferland 1996 ) functional form : @xmath93^{-1}\\ , , \\label{rrfit}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath94 , @xmath95 are in the units of temperature ( ev or k ) and the units of @xmath96 are @xmath91 , while @xmath97 is dimensionless .",
    "a more accurate representation ( gu 2003 ) , especially for low - charge ions , replaces @xmath97 as    @xmath98    where , again , @xmath99 is dimensionless and @xmath100 has the units of temperature .",
    "the dr reactions which we take account of are defined by the @xmath26-electron target configuration interaction expansion which we use .",
    "all possible @xmath24-electron configurations are then constructed by adding a continuum or bound orbital to them .",
    "all possible autoionization and ( electric dipole ) radiative rates are determined from these configurations , and are applied subsequently so as to determine partial and total dr cross sections , following the theory of section [ thy ] .",
    "it is still the case , for fe@xmath0 at least , that it is convenient and meaningful to consider separately the @xmath101 and @xmath102 core - excitation contributions to dr since , as we shall see , our highest @xmath103 target level lies below our lowest @xmath104 level . indeed",
    ", ` @xmath101 ' dr completely dominates over @xmath102 at photoionized plasma temperatures , and can be expected to be the largest contribution too at collisional plasma temperatures , at least where fe@xmath0 is normally abundant ( mazzotta 1998 , bryans 2006 ) .",
    "this separation enables us to restrict the sum over rydberg states to @xmath105 , @xmath106 and to @xmath107 , @xmath108 , for @xmath101 and @xmath102 , respectively .",
    "we consider two different target configuration interaction expansions because carrying - out two dr calculations enables us to contrast the level of accuracy / difference in the @xmath26-electron targets with that of differences between theory and experiment for cross sections and assess the accuracy of total rate coefficients , i.e. quantify the uncertainty in the @xmath24-electron problem .",
    "we define a basis a consisting of the following configurations ( assuming a closed ne - like core ) : @xmath109 and a basis b , which consists of basis a plus @xmath110 thus , @xmath111 is the only configuration from the @xmath103 complex which is omitted , by basis b. configurations 1  3 , plus 5 , form the minimal set which allows for all ( @xmath101 ) one - electron promotions during the dielectronic capture process from the ground configuration .",
    "configuration 4 mixes strongly with 5 , whilst 6 and 7 ( which are strongly mixed themselves ) provide the leading even parity configuration interaction .",
    "configuration 8 ( basis b ) provides a check on that for the odd parity .",
    "basis a gives rise to 37 target terms whilst basis b gives rise to 56 terms . in both cases the radial functions were determined using the slater - type - orbital model potential of burgess ( 1989 ) .",
    "the ( 3s , 3p , 3d ) radial scaling parameters , @xmath112 , were determined by minimizing the equally weighted sum of eigenenergies of the 18 lowest terms , which correspond to all of those which arise from the first 5 configurations of the basis expansions . for basis",

    "b : @xmath116 , @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",

    "the effect of the two - body fine - structure operators representing interactions between valence electrons ( including spin - spin now ) is small  of the order @xmath119 ry  and since they are time consuming to determine in the dr calculation we omit them , along with the two - body non - fine - structure operators which are of the same order effect .    rrrrrrrrr level & config . &",

    "in order to make a comparison between our theoretical dr cross sections and those measured by schmidt ( 2006 ) at tsr , we convolute them according to equation ( [ exp1 ] ) using the experimentally determined @xmath186  ev and @xmath187  ev , and apply initially a hard cut - off ( see equation [ ncut ] ) at @xmath188 .",

    "this opens - up at @xmath189 and falls - off rapidly in @xmath184 , as radiative stabilization takes place via an outer - electron transition @xmath190 , for @xmath191 , and which is dominated by @xmath192 .",

    "we compare the results from basis a and basis b for excitation of the parent @xmath203 configuration 4 , summed - over all 5 parent levels .",

    "so , just a few @xmath184-values contribute strongly , but they are spread out in energy because of the 25  ev spread of levels of configuration 5 .    in figures [ fig - cf-6 ] to [ fig - cf-8 ] we present results for core - excitations to parent configurations 68 , which are only accessible via configuration mixing .",
    "again , there is an allowed core - radiative stabilization pathway for limited @xmath184-values .",

    "the main difference now between the results of basis a and basis b , see figures [ fig - cf-6 ] and [ fig - cf-7 ] , is an energy shift , due to the fact that we only adjusted to the lowest 40 observed level energies .",
    "we conclude that the use of observed energies mitigates against differences in the dr cross section due to the different level energies of basis a and basis b while differences in the radiative rates either occur for transitions which do not contribute strongly to the dr , or the rates themselves are simple redistributed amongst near - by levels .",
    "we consider the @xmath101 and @xmath102 core - excitations separately .",
    "( low - lying resonances which arise from @xmath211 capture to @xmath104 do overlap the @xmath101 energy range but the peaks are so small as to be ` lost in the noise ' when comparing with experiment . )      in figure [ fig - cf-9 ] we compare our theoretical dr results , obtained using basis a and basis b , with the experimental measurements of schmidt ( 2006 ) .",

    "schmidt ( 2006 ) note a relatively small anomalous enhancement below @xmath213  ev and so estimate the ` true ' dr - plus - rr contribution to tend towards @xmath214  @xmath215  s@xmath66 at @xmath119  ev .",
    "the two sets of theoretical results are in accordance above @xmath216  ev while at lower energies the results of basis b are in somewhat better agreement with experiment , down to @xmath217  ev . below the dip at about 0.04  ev , schmidt show fits to 5 dr resonances .",
    "we find 14 resonances , of the form @xmath218 , @xmath219 , and @xmath220 .",
    "of course , our convoluted cross sections only exhibit 3 ( basis a ) or 4 ( basis b ) obvious peaks in this energy region .",
    "we have looked at the bound states just below threshold but they are well below the apparent uncertainties in resonance energy positioning seen in figure [ fig - cf-9 ] . there is substantial disagreement between theory and experiment between about 0.03 and 0.35  ev .",
    "resonances in this region are higher members of those just series mentioned , as well as those attached to parent configurations 6 and 7 . however , the differences below 0.2  ev have negligible effect on any differences in the maxwellian rate coefficient at 2  ev . only the differences up to 0.35",
    "ev start to impact upon the maxwellian rate coefficient at 2  ev .",
    "we also illustrate the rr contribution in this energy region , having applied a hard cut - off at @xmath188 again .    in figure [ fig - cf-10 ]",
    "we compare the results of theory and experiment near threshold again , this time using a linear plot .",
    "we see more clearly now that the theoretical results from basis a and basis b are in close agreement over @xmath221  ev , but differ substantially from the measured .",
    "overall , in this energy range , the differences between the two sets of theoretical results are not large enough to suggest an uncertainty which could account for the difference with the measured .",
    "although , where there are more noticeable differences , the results from basis b are perhaps somewhat of an improvement over basis a. the dr cross section drops substantially ( by a factor of 10 , or so ) above 2.34  ev because autoionization into the excited fine - structure level 2 becomes energetically allowed .",
    "this means that resonances below 2.34  ev contribute ` disproportionately ' at higher temperatures  see , e.g. , figure 4 of schmidt ( 2006 ) .",
    "if we sum - up the resonance strengths over 0.35 to 2.5  ev we find that the result for basis a is 3% smaller than for basis b but the measured is 33% larger .    in figure [ fig - cf-11 ]",
    "we compare the results of theory and experiment over @xmath222  ev . although this is the typical temperature range of peak abundance for fe@xmath0 in a photoionized plasma , only above a temperature corresponding to about 5  ev is the maxwellian rate coefficient dominated by the resonances above 2  ev .",
    "again , the differences between the results of basis a and basis b are not too significant , but the agreement with the measured is rather poor . if we sum - up the resonance strengths over 2.5 to 10.5  ev we find that the result for basis a is 8% smaller than for basis b but the measured is 40% larger . thus , over @xmath222  ev we expect the experimentally deduced maxwellian rate coefficient to be roughly 40% larger than the theoretical one .    in figure [ fig - cf-12 ]",
    "we compare results over @xmath223  ev .",
    "as we move up in energy we start to see more of a convergence between the theoretical results and the measured ; the summed resonance strengths from basis a and basis b differ by less than 1% whilst the measured is 21% larger . however , if we now look at the energy range @xmath224  ev ( figure [ fig - cf-13 ] ) we see that the measured rate coefficient appears to be sitting on a much larger ` background ' over @xmath225  ev  the theoretical results drop much closer to zero between the main resonance peaks , i.e. , there is little ` fill - in ' due to other small resonance contributions . over @xmath226  ev ( figure [ fig - cf-14 ] )",
    "the much better agreement between theory and experiment is resumed , except over @xmath227  ev . here",
    ", there is a noticeable contribution from capture to high-@xmath184 states and the comparison with experiment is dependent on ( the modelling of ) their survival to be detected .",
    "we illustrate with the results from two models ( both for basis a ) and discuss them in detail next .    in figures",
    "[ fig - cf-15 ] and [ fig - cf-16 ] we compare results over @xmath228  ev and @xmath229  ev , respectively .",
    "the resonances arise from @xmath193 and @xmath230 core - excitations for the former , but the second only for the latter  see figures [ fig - cf-2 ] and [ fig - cf-3 ] .",
    "the results of basis a and basis b are indistinguishable on this scale , and so only basis a results are shown and considered further .",
    "in these two energy regions we address the issue of the survival of the recombined states as the ions travel from the cooler to the charge - state - analyzer .",
    "recall figure [ fig - cf-2 ] , there are high-@xmath184 dr contributions from parent levels @xmath231 of configuration 2 which span @xmath232  ev .",
    "( those attached to parent level 6 affect the @xmath227  ev range . )",
    "the situation , as illustrated by figure [ fig - cf-3 ] , is simpler for the peak at 58  ev .",
    "it is in these two energy ranges for which a hard cut - off at @xmath188 results - in large discrepancies between theory and experiment .",
    "the discrepancy is reduced on implementing a delayed cut - off ( equation [ prob ] ) utilizing the appropriate time - of - flight for this experiment of 166.5  ns and imposing a hard cut - off at @xmath233 due to the correction magnet close to the cooler ( schippers , private communication ) .",
    "further improvement in agreement is obtained on utilizing the survival probabilities of schippers ( 2001 ) , but for the dr of fe@xmath0 .",
    "these latter two sets of results are only shown at energies where they differ from the ` hard cut - off ' results . clearly , the final agreement between theory and experiment is sensitive to the precise contribution , i.e. survival , of recombined states with @xmath234 .",
    "while this largely accounts for the discrepancies over @xmath232  ev between experiment and theory utilizing only a hard cut - off , as well as the mis - match in the final position of the rydberg peak at 58.5  ev , it has no effect on the puzzling discrepancy between about 56 and 58ev . here",
    ", the experimental result actually lies at a fairly uniform @xmath235  @xmath83s@xmath66 below ( all of ) the theoretical one(s ) .",
    "we close the discussion of the @xmath101 results with a small observation : the noticeable drop in the dr cross section just below 56.5  ev ( in figure [ fig - cf-16 ] ) is due to the final - state of the @xmath236 core - radiative stabilization pathway infact opening - up at this point ( @xmath189 ) to autoionization to the @xmath237 continuum .",
    "( we obtain 0.220 for the ratio of the @xmath236 to @xmath238 radiative rates compared to 0.225 obtained by storey ( 2000 )  see also table [ tab2 ] . )",
    "thus , there appears to be close qualitative agreement between theory and experiment for this effect .",
    "this is in stark contrast to the poor quantitative agreement for the absolute cross section .      in figure [ fig - cf-17 ]",
    "we present an overview of the different contributions to the complete @xmath150 ` spectrum ' .",
    "the first point to note is that the resonance strengths are now a factor 10 , or more , smaller than those we have seen associated with the @xmath101 core - excitations .",
    "only the @xmath239 core - excitations exhibit the classic dr spectrum .",
    "the dipole core - excitations dominate , along with @xmath240 .",
    "we see that the final total spectrum is complex , which makes it difficult to identify individual peaks in the measured spectrum .    in figures [ fig - cf-18][fig - cf-21 ]",
    "we make comparisons between the results of our calculations with those of the experimental measurements by schmidt ( 2006 ) for dr in the energy region in which the @xmath150 core - excitations contribute .    in figure",
    "[ fig - cf-18 ] it is capture to @xmath104 which dominates , and we did not make a separate calculation using basis d since the orbitals were based on the thomas  fermi potential optimized for the al - like core . in the case of basis c , although we used the same scaling parameters for capture to @xmath104 as for @xmath241 , the slater - type - orbital model potential depends on configuration ( actually , the complex ) and so is inherently ` optimized ' differently for capture to @xmath104 and @xmath241 ( see burgess 1989 for specific details ) .",
    "hence , we added the basis c @xmath104 results to those of basis d. in the @xmath242  ev range the theoretical cross sections are much weaker than the measured .",
    "in contrast , in figures [ fig - cf-19 ] and [ fig - cf-20 ] we see that the theoretical dr cross sections are more strongly peaked than the measured , especially so for basis d which has the larger @xmath243 radiative rates . despite basis c apparently giving rise to a worse structure for fe@xmath0 than basis d , based upon the agreement between the length and velocity forms for the relevant oscillator strengths ( see table [ tab4 ] ) , it does appear that basis c gives rise to distinctly better agreement with experiment for the dr cross sections than basis d. although the agreement is worse than for @xmath101 core - excitations , the sensitivity of the atomic structure to the overlap of the @xmath103 and @xmath104 orbitals means that the differences are ` less serious ' , i.e. , there is still enough uncertainty in the atomic structure so that the agreement might be improved upon .",
    "we note that there is no simple identification of the various peaks in these figures as many different core - excitations contribute in this energy region , but they are dominated by a few low-@xmath184 resonances because @xmath101 autoionization of the final states opens - up at @xmath244 for all parents , except @xmath2 .",
    "in addition , the @xmath245 series rydberg accumulation contributes to the peak at 175  ev .    in figure [ fig - cf-21 ]",
    "we can unambiguously identify the peaks around 210 and 220  ev as being associated with the limit of the @xmath246 and @xmath247 core - excitations , but the theoretical cross sections are much smaller than measured for these peaks , especially so for the latter .",
    "the sum over @xmath184 is fairly well converged by @xmath248 and even applying no cut - off ( or infinite time - of - flight ) does not increase the size of the theoretical peaks by much .",
    "we do see the ` overshoot ' of the basis d results here  as expected from the use of the unadjusted energies of table [ tab3 ] .    summing over all dr resonance strengths for the @xmath150 core - excitations we find the basis d result to be 50% larger than that for basis c , which is comparable with the excess of the @xmath249 oscillator strength seen in table [ tab4 ] .",
    "the sum of the measured dr resonance strengths in the @xmath250  ev range is 21% larger than that from basis c. of course , we have noted significant disagreements between the calculated and measured dr resonances , both over- and under - estimates .",
    "finally , in figure [ fig - cf-22 ] we present our results for the @xmath149 core - excitations .",
    "these resonances lie above the highest energy considered by schmidt ( 2006 ) .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the sum of dr resonance strengths associated with this @xmath149 core - excitation is a factor of 2.5 larger than that associated with the @xmath150 .",
    "thus , apart from contributing at a higher temperature , this core - excitation is likely to be more important than the @xmath150 for application to collisional plasmas .",
    "in figure [ fig - cf-23 ] we present our theoretical results for maxwellian rate coefficients : rr - plus - dr from @xmath251 , @xmath150 and @xmath149 core - excitations , and compare the sum total of these with the one determined by schmidt ( 2006 ) , based primarily upon their measured dr ( cooler ) rate coefficients . over @xmath5",
    "k , a typical temperature range for photoionized plasmas where fe@xmath0 is abundant , the experimentally based total is between a factor @xmath252 larger than our theoretical total  this is inline with what we expect following our earlier detailed comparison of the dr resonances contributing at these temperatures .",
    "nevertheless , it is clear that the total recombination rate coefficient of fe@xmath0 in photoionized plasmas is an order of magnitude larger than has been used to - date , as first pointed - out by schmidt ( 2006 ) on the basis of their measurements for this ion .",
    "we show also only the low temperature fall - off of the recommended dr rate coefficient of arnaud and raymond ( 1992 ) and not any of the _ ad hoc _ changes proposed by netzer ( 2004 ) and by kraemer ( 2004 ) .    at temperatures of a few times",
    "@xmath253  k , typical of electron collision dominated plasmas where fe@xmath0 is abundant , the experimentally based total is only 5% smaller than our calculated one , while the recommended data of arnaud and raymond ( 1992 ) lies only about 10% higher .",
    "( the data of arnaud and raymond ( 1992 ) is based principally upon the results of jacobs ( 1977 ) , but includes an estimate of the contribution from @xmath254 inner - shell transitions as well and which were not included by jacobs . )",
    "we see also that both @xmath102 contributions contribute only modestly to the total , both equally about 6% at @xmath255  k. far off equilibrium , this rises to about 20% at @xmath256  k with three - quarters coming from the @xmath149 core - excitation .",
    "given the modest contribution from @xmath102 core - excitations , then , since such calculations are more demanding than for @xmath101 , the use of @xmath257-coupling may suffice , even with the 30% difference from intermediate coupling which we note ( not shown ) .",
    "these rate coefficients are for the @xmath258 ground level of fe@xmath0 . in photoionized plasmas",
    ", the ion population may not be concentrated in the ground level , while in electron collisional plasmas there may be signification population of levels of the @xmath259 term .",
    "the rate coefficients for the various metastable levels can be quite different . in figure [ fig - cf-24 ]",
    "we compare and contrast total dr ( i.e. , summed - over all core - excitations ) and rr rate coefficients from the ground and metastable levels .",
    "we index the target metastable levels by @xmath260 , where @xmath261 for the ( @xmath262 ) ground level , @xmath263 for the other ( @xmath146 ) fine - structure level and @xmath264 for the ( @xmath265 ) levels of the metastable term , as per table [ tab1 ] .    at photoionized plasma temperatures we see that the @xmath263 metastable dr rate coefficient is an order of magnitude smaller than for the ( @xmath261 ) ground level  this is due primarily , of course , to the absence of the fine structure dr pathway . the dr rate coefficients for higher metastables exhibit irregular behaviour ( at low temperatures ) due to the positioning close to threshold of the lowest autoionizing states , relative to these excited fe@xmath0 thresholds , although the @xmath266 and 4 metastable levels again have fine - structure dielectronic capture pathways and the enhancement for @xmath266 appears to be quite noticeable . at collisional plasma temperatures the dr rate coefficients split primarily into two groups which are based upon term , not level , as the influence of fine - structure dr and threshold effects is diminished .",
    "the difference in rr rate coefficients is much less pronounced , at all temperatures . at low temperatures the stability against autoionization for all",
    "@xmath184 distinguishes rr of the ground level .",
    "there is little difference for metastables levels of the excited term because the highest stable recombined @xmath184 is ( almost ) independent of the fine - structure parent .",
