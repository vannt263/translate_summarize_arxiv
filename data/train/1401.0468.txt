    "sphere packing and sphere covering problems have been a popular area of study in discrete mathematics over many years .",
    "a sphere packing usually refers to the arrangement of non - overlapping imensional spheres .",
    "a typical sphere packing problem is to find a maximal density arrangement , i.e. ,  an arrangement in which the spheres fill as much of the space as possible . on the other hand ,",
    "sphere covering refers to an arrangement of spheres that cover the whole space .",
    "overlap is not only allowed in these arrangements , but inevitable . in this case , the aim is to find an arrangement that minimizes the density ( i.e. ,  the total volume of the spheres divided by the volume of the space ) .    in dimension 2 , the densest circle packing and the thinnest circle covering",
    "are both attained by the hexagonal lattice  @xcite . in dimension 3 ,",
    "hales  @xcite has recently given a computer - assisted proof showing that the face - centered cubic ( fcc ) lattice achieves the densest packing even when the sphere centers are not constrained to lie on a lattice .",
    "the thinnest covering in dimension 3 is achieved by the body - centered cubic ( bcc ) lattice  @xcite , but it is not known yet if one can improve the covering by allowing non - lattice arrangements . in dimension 4 and higher , the situation is more complicated and even less is known ; see  @xcite for a comprehensive summary .",
    "although sphere packing and sphere covering problems have attracted a lot of attention by mathematicians , the arrangements of spheres encountered for example in modeling in the biological sciences usually fall between sphere packing and sphere covering : models consist of overlapping spheres , which do not fill the whole space , and one is often interested in maximal density configurations of spheres where we allow a certain amount of overlap .",
    "examples are the spatial organization of chromosomes in the cell nucleus  @xcite , the spatial organization of neurons  @xcite , or the arrangement of ganglion cell receptive fields on the retinal surface  @xcite .",
    "the wide applicability is also based on the fact that soft spheres can be modeled as hard spheres with limited overlap . in all these applications one would like to understand the optimal packing configuration of spheres when allowing a certain amount of overlap .    in this paper",
    ", we study this problem between sphere packing and sphere covering for the special case when the sphere centers lie on a particular family of lattices obtained by diagonally distorting the integer grid : let @xmath0 be a distortion parameter",
    ". then the lattice @xmath1 is defined by mapping each unit vector @xmath2 , @xmath3 , to @xmath4 this family of lattices has been defined and studied in @xcite .",
    "it is particularly interesting , since it contains the optimal packing lattices in dimensions 2 and 3 and the optimal covering lattices in dimensions 2 - 5 . at the same time",
    ", it is simple enough ( defined by one parameter only ) allowing us to give a complete analysis of the density of sphere arrangements with limited overlap as a function of @xmath5 . in this paper",
    ", we prove that for dimension 2 and 3 , the optimal packing and covering lattices are robust : even when allowing a certain overlap , either the optimal sphere packing lattice or the optimal sphere covering lattice attain the maximum density , depending on the amount of allowed overlap and how overlap is measured .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in section [ measures ] we discuss two different measures of overlaps in sphere arrangements .",
    "the first one , called _ distance - based overlap _",
    ", is simply a linear function of the distance between two sphere centers and has been used for the analysis in @xcite .",
    "the second one , called _ volume - based overlap _ is based on the intersection volume of spheres . in section [ dist_overlap ] we give a complete description of the density of sphere arrangements with limited overlap for the distance - based overlap . in particular , we show that the fcc lattice results in the densest arrangement in the considered family of lattices , regardless of the amount of allowed overlap . in section [ vol_overlap ]",
    "we analyze the more complicated volume - based overlap measure : we derive an exact formula for the packing density for each lattice in the family and each overlap threshold by analyzing the voronoi polytope of a lattice point . for planar lattices ,",
    "we prove that the hexagonal lattice remains optimal for any overlap . in dimension 3",
    ", we show that the best choice depends on the allowed overlap and we provide numerical evidence that the optimal lattice is always either the fcc or the bcc lattice .",
    "we end with a short discussion in section [ discussion ] .",
    "we let @xmath6 denote the closed ball of radius @xmath7 and center @xmath8 .",
    "we fix a lattice @xmath9 and let @xmath10 denote the voronoi cell of the origin consisting of all points that are closer to the origin than to any other lattice point .",
    "observe that the voronoi cells of other lattice points are just translations of @xmath10 and that the voronoi cells tessellate @xmath11 .",
    "a first measure of a sphere arrangement is the _ density_. it is defined as the number of spheres that contain an average point and can be rephrased as @xmath12    second , we define the _ union _ of a sphere arrangement to be @xmath13    the @xmath14 denotes what fraction of the voronoi cell is covered by the ball of radius @xmath7 .",
    "looking at the whole space , it also denotes what fraction of @xmath15 is covered by the union of all balls of radius @xmath7 .",
    "this follows because the voronoi cells tessellate @xmath15 and from the following statement :    let @xmath8 be a point that belongs to the voronoi cell of @xmath16 . if @xmath8 is covered by a ball @xmath17 , then @xmath8 is also covered by @xmath18 .",
    "a third measure of a sphere arrangement is the _",
    "overlap_. we define two measures of overlap .",
    "the _ distance - based overlap _ was used to model the spatial organization of chromosomes in @xcite and is defined as the diameter of the largest sphere that can be inscribed into the intersection of two spheres , i.e. : @xmath19 a less simplified measure of overlap is the _ volume - based overlap _ , which we define as the fraction of a sphere that expands outside its voronoi cell : @xmath20 this value is equivalent to the fraction of all other spheres expanding into a voronoi cell ( i.e. ,  the overlap with multiplicity inside a voronoi cell ) .",
    "we observe that @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 ( describing both overlap measures ) are non - negative , monotonously increasing functions with @xmath22 upper bounded by  1 .",
    "the upper bound for @xmath14 is reached exactly at the covering radius , the maximal distance of the origin to the boundary of @xmath10 .",
    "the lower bound for @xmath24 is reached exactly at the packing radius , the minimal distance of the origin to the boundary of @xmath10 .",
    "also , it holds that @xmath25    building upon these measures of sphere arrangements we can now define a relaxed packing and covering quality when allowing overlap and uncovered space , respectively . by fixing a threshold @xmath26",
    ", we define the _ relaxed packing quality _ of a lattice as @xmath27    the goal is to find the lattice that maximizes @xmath28 .",
    "note that for @xmath29 , this is equivalent to the classical sphere packing problem : we want to cover as much space as possible by balls without overlap .",
    "it is known that in dimension 3 the fcc lattice is the optimal solution to this problem .    [ lemma_packing ]",
    "the fcc lattice is not optimal with respect to @xmath28 for all values of @xmath30 when measuring overlap by @xmath31 .",
    "let @xmath32 be the overlap of the bcc lattice when choosing the radius to be its covering radius .",
    "note that the density of this covering is @xmath33 by  .",
    "assume that the fcc lattice attains the same density for @xmath32 .",
    "then , again by  , the union must be @xmath34 , so the fcc lattice yields a sphere covering with the same density as the bcc lattice .",
    "but this is a contradiction to the well - known fact that the fcc covering density is strictly larger than the bcc covering density .",
    "interestingly , we will prove in section [ dist_overlap ] that the fcc lattice is in fact optimal for all values of @xmath30 when measuring overlap by @xmath35 .",
    "similarly , we can define a _",
    "relaxed covering quality _ as @xmath36    in words , we want as little overlap as possible while allowing only a certain amount of uncovered space .",
    "note that for @xmath29 , this is equivalent to the classical covering problem : we want to cover the whole space by balls minimizing the density .",
    "similarly as in lemma [ lemma_packing ] we can prove that the bcc lattice is not optimal with respect to @xmath37 for all values of @xmath30 when measuring overlap by @xmath31 .",
    "however , the bcc lattice is optimal for all values of @xmath30 when measuring overlap by @xmath35 as we will see in section [ dist_overlap ] .    since for the applications we described in the introduction the relevant quality measure seems to be @xmath28",
    ", we will mainly concentrate on this measure .",
    "however , the analysis could easily be extended to @xmath37 .    from now on , we focus on the lattices given by a diagonal distortion of the integer lattice in @xmath15 as defined in  .",
    "the parameter @xmath5 defines the amount of distortion , with @xmath38 denoting no distortion . for @xmath5 from @xmath34 to @xmath39 , every point of the integer lattice undergoes a continuous motion towards its projection onto the plane with normal vector @xmath40 . for @xmath41 ,",
    "each lattice point moves continuously in the opposite direction . for @xmath42",
    ", the hexagonal lattice corresponds to @xmath43 and @xmath44 , and for @xmath45 , the fcc lattice corresponds to @xmath46 and the bcc lattice to @xmath47 ; see  @xcite for more details .    to simplify notation",
    ", we write e.g.  @xmath48 instead of @xmath49 . fixing a threshold @xmath30 for the overlap",
    ", we would like to find the best lattice in the family such that @xmath50 is maximized .",
    "the approach we take is to compute @xmath28 for a given @xmath5 in two steps :    1 .   compute the largest ball radius @xmath51 such that @xmath52 .",
    "2 .   compute @xmath53 .",
    "in @xcite , an algorithm was developed for finding minimum overlap configurations of @xmath54 spheres ( or more generally ellipsoids ) packed into an ellipsoidal container . in order to get an efficient algorithm ,",
    "the simplified distance - based overlap measure was used , which could be computed as a convex optimization problem .",
    "one can easily check that the problem of finding minimal overlap configurations of spheres with a certain density is equivalent to finding maximal density configurations of spheres with a certain overlap , the problem we study in this paper .",
    "it was observed in a few examples ( see example 3.4 in @xcite ) that the optimal configuration of the spheres is invariant to scaling of the radii .",
    "this is in fact an important property for the application to chromosome packing , since the exact chromatin packing density is not known and one would hope that the positioning is robust to different scalings of the chromosomes . in the following , we prove that this scaling - invariance holds in infinite space when the sphere centers are restricted to lie on the 1-parameter distortion family of the integer grid .    for the 1-parameter family of diagonal distortions defined in ( [ dist_family ] ) , the density simplifies to    @xmath55    where @xmath56 denotes the ( n - dimensional ) volume of the n - dimensional unit ball , i.e.    @xmath57    here @xmath58 denotes the double factorial . half the minimal distance between two lattice points , @xmath59 ,",
    "has been computed in @xcite ( it corresponds to the packing radius ) :    @xmath60    using these formulas we now prove that the maximum density configuration does not depend on the amount of allowed overlap and is always attained by @xmath61 , which corresponds to the optimal packing lattice in the family for all @xmath62 and over all lattices in dimension 2 and 3 .",

    ", we can solve for @xmath66 . then plugging @xmath67 into the formula for the density given in ( [ density ] ) we get @xmath68 the function @xmath69 for @xmath45 and @xmath70 is shown in figure [ fig_overlap_dual_plot ] ( left ) . since @xmath71 ,",
    "the constants in the function @xmath69 in ( [ eq_density ] ) are positive . by taking derivatives with respect to @xmath5",
    "we find that for @xmath72 the density is strictly increasing for all values of @xmath32 .",
    "similarly , for the branch @xmath73 the density is strictly decreasing for @xmath74 , achieves a minimum at @xmath75 , and is strictly increasing for @xmath76 , independent of the value of @xmath32 .",
    "finally , for @xmath77 the density is strictly decreasing for all values of @xmath32 . as a consequence , @xmath78 since @xmath79 for all @xmath62 with equality if and only if @xmath42 , the maximum is attained by @xmath61 with equality if and only if @xmath42 , where both lattices correspond to the hexagonal lattice .",

    "we next briefly analyze the relaxed covering quality and show that in this case the optimum is always attained by the optimal covering configuration .",
    "similarly as for @xmath35 , we use a linearized measure of the uncovered space @xmath80 .",

    "in this section we analyze @xmath28 for the volume - based overlap measure in dimension 2 and 3 . as we have already pointed out in lemma  [ lemma_packing ]",
    ", we can not expect the same behavior as for the distance - based overlap measure discussed in the previous section .",
    "however , the lemma only states that the fcc lattice , which is optimal for @xmath29 is worse than the bcc lattice for some value of @xmath30 .",
    "this does not rule out the possibility of other lattices being optimal .",
    "this section will perform a deeper investigation of the optimal lattice configurations , starting with the two - dimensional case .",
    "first of all , note that in dimension 2 , the lattice for @xmath5 is a scaled version of the lattice for @xmath88 . because of this symmetry , it suffices to study all lattices with @xmath89 .    for analyzing the volume - based overlap measure",

    "this requires the investigation of the voronoi cell @xmath91 in some detail .",
    "@xmath91 is bounded by six bisectors : four of them with the lattice points @xmath92 , and two with the lattice points @xmath93 .",

    "note that all lattice points neighboring the origin lie on a common circle around the origin.,title=\"fig:\",width=151 ]    with this data we can derive a formula for the volume of @xmath90 : if @xmath102 , @xmath103 is completely contained in @xmath91 and the volume equals the volume of @xmath103 .",
    "if @xmath104 , @xmath103 contains all boundary vertices of @xmath91 and thus all of @xmath91 ( of volume @xmath5 ) , by convexity . in the last case where @xmath105 , the part of @xmath103 that is not in @xmath91 is the union of up to six circular segments .",
    "their area is given by @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the angle at the origin induced by the chord .",
    "this angle can be expressed as @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the smallest distance of the chord to the origin .    in our case ,",
    "the chord is given by a bisector .",
    "depending on the type of the bisector , @xmath109 is either equal to @xmath95 or equal to @xmath96 .",
    "so we define @xmath110 since the circular segments do not intersect for any @xmath111 ( because an intersection would imply that a boundary vertex of @xmath91 is part of @xmath103 ) and there are four bisectors of type @xmath34 and two bisectors of type @xmath94 , it follows that    @xmath112 using this formula , we can now prove the following theorem :    in dimension 2 , the lattice @xmath63 which maximizes the relaxed packing quality w.r.t .",

    "this results in the packing density , which is maximized by the hexagonal lattice . moreover , if @xmath30 is sufficiently large to allow a covering , i.e. @xmath121 , the maximal density is attained at the best covering .",
    "this is known to be the hexagonal lattice .",
    "so we can concentrate on the case @xmath122 where @xmath123 meaning that @xmath124    consider the function @xmath125 , which is defined for @xmath126 in the limits of interest given in . by definition",
    ", @xmath127 satisfies @xmath128 .",
    "the density is given by @xmath129 which we want to maximize w.r.t .",
    "this requires computing the derivative of @xmath130 w.r.t .",
    "we do this by using the implicit function theorem @xmath131 after some calculations we find @xmath132    one can easily check that the first derivative is non - negative for any @xmath5 , except if @xmath7 equals the packing radius @xmath96 corresponding to @xmath29 , and we know the optimal packing for this case .",
    "similarly , the second derivative is non - positive except if @xmath7 equals the packing radius @xmath95 .",
    "the third derivative is zero either if @xmath133 or if @xmath7 equals the covering radius @xmath134 corresponding to @xmath135 , in which case the hexagonal lattice is optimal as we argued above .",
    "moreover , for @xmath111 , the derivative is increasing for @xmath136 and decreasing for @xmath137 .",
    "this concludes the proof .      in three dimensions ,",
    "the symmetry between @xmath5 and @xmath88 is lost , and we need to analyze both branches .",
    "we first discuss the case @xmath138 : imagine that @xmath7 increases from 0 to @xmath139 .",
    "initially , the volume of the intersection @xmath90 equals the volume of the ball .",
    "when increasing the ball radius @xmath7 , there are three possibilities :    1 .",
    "we hit a bisector plane .",
    "from now on we have to subtract a spherical cap from the volume .",
    "there are a total of 14 bisector planes of three different types .",
    "their distance to the origin and number of occurrences are : + @xmath140 2 .",
    "we hit a boundary edge of @xmath91 , where two bisector planes are meeting .",
    "from now on , we have to add to the volume the intersection of the two spherical caps involved ( because they are counted twice )",
    ". there are a total of 36 trisector edges of two different types .",
    "their distance to the origin , number of occurrences , and types of bisector planes between the 3 involved spheres are : @xmath141 however , note that the volume of the cap intersection depends on the type of the bisector plane between the two spheres that are not centered at the origin .",
    "we get @xmath142 different subtypes , four of them appearing @xmath143 times , and one appearing @xmath144 times in the polytope .",
    "we hit a boundary vertex of @xmath91 .",
    "all 24 boundary vertices have the same distance to the origin , namely the covering radius @xmath145 when @xmath7 exceeds @xmath146 the whole voronoi cell @xmath91 is covered , so the intersection has volume @xmath5 .",
    "depending on the value of @xmath5 we have the following ordering of the critical radii : @xmath147    so @xmath148 seen as a function in @xmath5 has @xmath149 branches . in every branch , the interval which @xmath7 falls into determines how many and which types of cap intersections have to be taken into account to compute the volume - based overlap .    for @xmath76 , a similar analysis can be performed .",
    "however , there is one remarkable difference : the vertices of @xmath91 are no longer arranged in the same distance around the origin . more precisely , there are @xmath94 vertices at distance @xmath150 and @xmath143 vertices at distance @xmath151 with @xmath152 note that @xmath153 and @xmath151 is the covering radius .",

    "a 3-dimensional plot of the function @xmath156 is shown in figure  [ fig:3d ] ( left ) . in figure  [ fig:3d ] ( middle and right ) we highlight specific slices through the 3-dimensional plot to better explain the behavior .",
    "figure  [ fig:3d ] ( middle ) shows @xmath156 for three different values of @xmath30 .",
    "we can observe that the fcc lattice ( @xmath46 ) is indeed optimal for small values of allowed overlap @xmath30 .",

    "interestingly , for larger values of @xmath30 the bcc lattice attains the maximal density and surpasses the fcc lattice .",
    "also observe that both lattices always achieve a better relaxed packing quality than the integer lattice ( @xmath75 ) .",
    "looking at the density of the fcc and the bcc lattice depending on @xmath30 in figure  [ fig:3d ] ( right ) , we can note that there is indeed only one switch of optimality ( at @xmath160 ) .",
    "our analysis indicates that the @xmath161 and the @xmath162 lattice are always locally optimal configurations , and no other lattice from the family yields a better packing , independent of the allowed overlap .",
    "the natural next step would be to prove our observation .",
    "this problem can in theory be tackled with the same approach that we used in section  [ sec_dim_2 ] in the @xmath163 case by relating the derivative of @xmath50 to the partial derivatives of @xmath31 using the implicit function theorem . for small values of @xmath30 , we were able to verify the claim , that is , prove monotonicity of the function in all branches with a substantial amount of symbolic computations .",
    "however , as soon as the expression for @xmath31 involves intersections of @xmath94 and @xmath164 spherical caps , the derivatives seem to become too complicated to be handled analytically .",
    "this work has analyzed the problem of densest sphere packings while allowing some overlap among the spheres .",
    "we see our contributions as a first step towards an interesting and important research direction , given the numerous applications of spheres with overlap in the natural sciences . for example , our analysis of the distance - based overlap measure showing that the fcc lattice is optimal independent of the amount of overlap , and hence independent of the scaling of the spheres , lays the theoretical foundations for @xcite , i.e. ,  for analyzing the spatial organization of chromosomes in the cell nucleus as a sphere arrangement .",
