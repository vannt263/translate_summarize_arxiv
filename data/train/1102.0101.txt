    "bosonization is one of the most powerful techniques for describing the properties of one - dimensional ( 1d ) interacting electron systems . in 1d systems ,",
    "even a slight interaction between electrons strongly affects the quantum nature , resulting in the occurrence of tomonaga  luttinger liquid ( tll ) states.@xcite tll states exhibit power - law anomalies in physical quantities , as predicted by the bosonization theory.@xcite a prominent example is the power - law singularity of the single - particle density of states @xmath0 near the fermi energy , @xmath1 , represented by @xmath2 and @xmath3 , with @xmath4 and @xmath5 being the energy and the temperature , respectively .",
    "the value of @xmath6 , called the tll exponent , is dependent on the interaction strength@xcite and other parameters characterizing the 1d system.@xcite recently , it has been suggested that a continuous variation in @xmath6 can be produced by an external field;@xcite this implies artificial control of the transport properties of quasi-1d conductors , since @xmath6 governs the power - law behaviors of the differential tunneling conductance@xcite @xmath7 at high bias voltages @xmath8 and the temperature - dependent conductance @xmath9 at low voltages @xmath10 .",
    "experimental realizations of tll states encompass various systems showing highly anisotropic conductivity : metallic,@xcite semiconducting,@xcite and organic nanowires,@xcite and carbon nanotubes@xcite are a few examples .",
    "these actual quasi-1d conductors possess a finite cross - section , thus exhibiting a finite number of transmission channels in the transverse direction ( except for a limited case in which @xmath1 is small enough for only the lowest subband to be involved ) .",
    "the presence of multiple channels at @xmath1 causes inter - subband scatterings .",
    "furthermore , different channels can have different fermi velocities , i.e. , the slope of the dispersion curve at @xmath1 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : band ] ) , and thus contributions from each channel to the tll exponent differ from each other .",
    "theories of multichannel tll have been developed for the hubbard model in the presence of an external magnetic field,@xcite , where the discrepancies in the fermi velocity between up- and down - spins are taken into account .",
    "a similar issue was also discussed in the study of quasi-1d bose gases.@xcite the effect of inter - subband scattering on the tll exponent has been investigated in connection with the tll behavior of multiwall carbon nanotubes.@xcite however , to the best of our knowledge , singular behavior in the density of states @xmath11 remains unresolved for multichannel tll systems with the coexistence of inter - subband scatterings and fermi - velocity variations .",
    "hence , the rigorous expression of @xmath11 in multichannel tll systems is desirable for describing the transport properties and photo - emission spectra those will be experimentally observed in actual quasi-1d conductors .    in this paper",
    ", we reformulate the multichannel tll theory in order to derive the anomalous energy- and temperature - dependences of the local density of states of quasi-1d fermion systems .",
    "cases of locations both far from the boundary and close to it , which correspond to bulk contact and end contact of the transport properties , respectively , are discussed .",
    "we demonstrate clearly how the tll exponents of multichannel systems depend on mutual interaction and fermi velocities . the resulting formula for the exponents , as well as the theoretical framework we have established , will provide clues to exploiting the effects of subband couplings and fermi velocity variations on the nature of tlls in real 1d systems .",

    "in section iv , the case of spinless fermions is discussed and the @xmath12-dependences of the exponents are obtained for long - range interaction limits . the paper closes with a summary in section v. in the following , the unit @xmath13 is used , unless explicitly stated otherwise .",

    "<S> we reformulate the tomonaga  luttinger liquid theory for quasi - one - dimensional fermion systems with many subbands across the fermi energy . </S>",
    "<S> our theory enables us to obtain a rigorous expression of the local density of states ( ldos ) for general multichannel quantum wires , describing how the power - law anomalies of ldos depend on inter- and intra - subbands couplings as well as the fermi velocity of each band . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting formula for the exponents is valid in the case of both bulk contact and edge contact , and thus plays a fundamental role in the physical properties of multicomponent tomonaga  luttinger liquid systems . </S>"
