    "the number of citations an article receives can be considered a proxy for the attention or popularity the article achieved in the scientific community .",
    "citations play a crucial role both in the evolution of science @xcite as well as in the bibliometric evaluation of scientists and institutions , in which case the number of citations is often tacitly taken as a measure of quality . understanding which factors in a paper contribute or",
    "correlate with citations has been the subject of a number of investigations ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for reviews ) .",
    "diversity in the affiliation of authors , multinationality , multidisciplinarity , and number of references , figures or tables have all been identified as factors that positively correlate with citations .    here",
    "we perform a more systematic investigation of how different textual properties of scientific papers affect the number of citations they acquire ( see appendix [ methods : data ] for data description ) . a classical result , which motivates our more general analysis , is the negative correlation between title length and citations ( i.e. , shorter the titles more citations )  @xcite . in our analysis",
    "we consider additionally the complexity and the sentiment of the text both at the title and the abstract , see table  [ tab : factors ] .",
    "lexical complexity is usually considered as proportional to the effort needed ( by non - experts ) to understand the texts .",
    "the three measures of text complexity we use ( see table  [ tab : factors ] ) take into account the number of different words in the text ( normalized by the length ) and the length of these words in syllables ( see appendix [ methods : text ] for details ) . in several previous studies",
    "authors used the concept of the sentiment analysis ( i.e. , emotional content ) of the examined text / messages .",
    "in general , psychologists are able to specify several dimensions of emotions , reaching as far as 12  @xcite .",
    "however two of them  _ valence _ and _ arousal _  are probably the best recognized and the most frequently used .",
    "valence reflects the emotional sign of the message ( negative , neutral , positive ) while arousal is used to describe the level of activation ( low , medium , high ) .",
    "pairs of valence and arousal can indicate the specific emotion type  @xcite , e.g. , fear ( negative and aroused ) , sad ( negative and not aroused ) etc .",
    ", however they can be also utilized as independent variables .",
    "for example valence as a standalone dimension has successfully been used to detect collective states of online users  @xcite , to indicate the end of online discussions  @xcite or to predict the dynamics of twitter users during olympic games in london  @xcite . lately",
    "this kind of analysis has also been introduced to judge upon the role of negative citations  @xcite , citation bias  @xcite , and to check what boosts the diffusion of scientific content  @xcite . here",
    "we quantify arousal and valence through dictionary classifier , see appendix [ methods : sent ] .",
    ".list of textual factors whose relation to citations we investigate in our paper .",
    "whenever possible , factors are obtained on the title and abstract of a paper .",
    "see appendices [ methods : text ] and [ methods : sent ] for exact definitions .",
    "additionally , we consider the number of authors ( motivated by previous studies e.g. ,  @xcite ) . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in this paper we investigate the _ importance _ of factors of scientific papers on the popularity they acquire . as factors we consider the number of authors of the paper and also text - related properties that quantify the length of title and abstract , the complexity of the vocabulary , and sentiment based on the used words .",
    "these factors capture different stylistic dimensions of scientific writing and were selected also based on previous works that indicated a correlation to the number of citations .",
    "we found that the factors with a stronger ( positive ) effect on citations are the number of authors and the length of the abstract .",
    "text complexity is positive correlated with citation at the level of the abstract , while we could not detect a strong effect within the title .",
    "the agreement of two factors designed to quantify text complexity ",
    "the @xmath1-index and gunning fog index  support this conclusion ( the opposite result is obtained if herdan s c measure is used , but we attribute this to the negative correlation of this measure with text length ) . in terms of the sentiment factors ,",
    "the level of arousal a title or abstract invokes is poorly correlated with citations .",
    "this result should be examined more carefully as there are controversies as to the relation between text polarity and information contained therein ( see @xcite and the following discussion ) .",
    "also the vocabulary on which we rely in this study @xcite has been obtained by evaluating the common reception of words .",
    "this fact can strongly affect the value of valence , e.g. , a highly negative word `` cancer '' in medical papers .",
    "the discussion above , and the fact that a statistically significant effect is present for most factors , should not hide that the effect is typically weak ( @xmath2 for most factors , quantiles @xmath3 , and journals ) and that there are strong fluctuations across papers and journals . for instance , a positive correlation between number of characters and citations for _ all _ the quantiles is measured in the _ new england journal of medicine _ , while a negative correlation is observed in the overwhelming majority of other journals .",
    "one of the main findings of our paper is that the factors vary also strongly depending whether the analysis uses all or only the most cited papers .",
    "we quantified this effect by the dependence of @xmath4 on the quantile @xmath3 in a quantile regression analysis .",
    "one example in which this effect is particularly strong is the role of title length in figure [ fig : qr ] . in the public media  @xcite ,",
    "the message behind the finding  @xcite of negative correlation between text length and citations was that authors should write shorter titles to achieve more citations .",
    "while this simple message is appealing and agrees with some stylistic recommendations , our results show that for most journals this is wrong ( even if one assumes that there is a causal relation behind the correlations ) .",
    "the negative correlation is found only in the most cited journals , for typical journals the correlation is positive ( longer titles are better ) .",
    "this suggests that papers with short titles show a larger variation on the number of citations and can be very well cited or very poorly cited .",
    "a similar behavior is observed in other factors , and a significant dependence on @xmath3 is seen on average in @xmath5 of the journals .",
    "altogether , our results indicate that textual properties of title and abstract have non - trivial effects in the processes leading to the attribution of citations . in particular",
    ", the effect varies significantly between papers with usual number of citations and with large number of citations .",
    "this finding is even more important considering that the number of citations across papers varies dramatically .",
    "the weak signal we detect can be considered also a sign that the quantities we measure have limited information , e.g. , expressing the impact of publications by single number ( the number of citations ) can be misleading and lacking information ( a point that has been previously raised , e.g. , in ref .",
    "the overall estimates ( calculated over a set of journals or categories ) may dim the clear picture one receives while observing a specific journal .",
    "for authors interested in how to write the title and abstract of their paper , we recommend looking at the values of @xmath6 and @xmath7 of the different factors for the specific journals of interest .",
    "we thank margit palzenberger and the max - planck - digital - library for providing access to the dataset used in this paper .",
    "we obtained data from the _ web of science _",
    "service about the papers marked as `` articles '' published in the period of 1995  2004 that fulfil the following two conditions : ( i ) the journal where the article has been published had to be active in all the mentioned years and ( ii ) there had to be at least @xmath8 articles published in total in this journal in the given period . by applying this filtering we obtained over @xmath9 articles from over @xmath10 different journals containing information about the title of the paper ,",
    "the number of its authors , full abstract contents and oecd category it had been classified to .",
    "additionally , for each of the record we also recorded the number of citations it acquired between being published and 31st december 2014 . data processing , plots and statistical analysis have been performed using language @xcite .",
    "the most obvious candidates for quantitative factors that could be used to describe the paper are the number of words or the number of characters . in the case of the title",
    "the second option has been used while in the case of abstract  the first one .",
    "additionally the number of authors has also been used as in a previous study it had been shown to be an important factor @xcite . as it concerns the complexity of the vocabulary a way to account for that is to measure a so - called herdan s c index ( see e.g. , @xcite p. 72 ) , defined for each paper @xmath11 as @xmath12 where @xmath13 stands for the text length ( number of words ) and @xmath14 is the vocabulary size ( i.e. , the number of unique words ) of paper @xmath11 . to overcome methodological shortcomings of this traditional approach ( e.g. , no fluctuations effect included ) it",
    "has recently been proposed @xcite to use a @xmath1-score that shows how much the obtained pair ( @xmath14 , @xmath13 ) is different form the expected value @xmath15 in units of standard deviations @xmath16 @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 were obtained empirically using all papers in our database .",
    "finally one might also take into account the complexity of the used words . a classical quantity",
    "to measure this effect is so - called `` gunning fog index '' @xmath20 @xcite , defined for each paper @xmath11 as @xmath21 where a complex a word is a one that has more than two syllables @xcite .",
    "fog index is widely used as its value can be connected to the number of formal years of education needed to understand the text at first reading .",
    "because of the absence of sentences fog index has not been calculated in case of title ( i.e. , a typical title contains only one sentence therefore @xmath20 is highly correlated with the number of words ) .",
    "in study the idea of a _ dictionary emotional classifier _ has been used : in this approach one takes the dictionary of words that had been tagged for valence and arousal and calculates the mean arithmetic value of all the recognized words .",
    "thus in case of each paper we have separately valence ( and arousal ) values for title and abstract .",
    "we have used a very recent study @xcite which contains norms for almost 14.000 english words , where valence ( @xmath22 ) and arousal ( @xmath23 ) are given as real numbers in the scale @xmath24 $ ] ( i.e. , @xmath22 below 5 is negative , while @xmath25 means positive words , low @xmath23 values indicate low arousal , while high @xmath23 is high arousal ) .",
    "the total valence and arousal were obtained as the average of all words in the title or abstract .",
    "in order to make comparison among different factors each factor @xmath26 has been separately standardized with respect to journal , i.e. for each @xmath11 @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are , respectively , sample mean and variance over factor @xmath26 in a journal @xmath30 it belongs to .",
    "in the approach of quantile regression @xcite , having @xmath31 factors ( variables ) @xmath32 and an observable @xmath33 , we are able to obtain a regression line defined by coefficients @xmath34 @xmath35 for a given quantile @xmath3 by solving the minimization problem @xmath36 where @xmath37 is called loss function ( @xmath38 is indicator variable ) . in this study we restrict ourselves to case where @xmath39 i.e. , we examine the influence of each of the factors separately . as",
    "the logarithm is an increasing function , the logarithm of the @xmath40-th quantile is equal to the @xmath40-th quantile of the log - transformed citation counts . for computational purposes we used s _",
    "quantreg _ package @xcite .",
    "we test if the number of positive values of @xmath41 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 is significantly different from the one obtained by chance ( i.e. , by randomly choosing `` + '' or `` - '' signs with equal probability @xmath42 ) .",
    "this statistics follows a binomial distribution .",
    "however , as the number of samples ( journals ) @xmath43 is large ( @xmath44 ) we simply use normal distribution @xmath45 , with @xmath46 and @xmath47 with @xmath48 .",
    "we consider the observation to be statistical significant at if the measured number of positive @xmath4 differs from @xmath49 by more than @xmath50 ( i.e. , p - value is less than @xmath51 ) .",
