    "graphene subject to a perpendicular magnetic field exhibits a quantum hall ( qh ) state at @xmath0 .",
    "while such a state can exist in the noninteracting model with a zeeman coupling , the @xmath0 state in experimental samples is believed to be driven by electron - electron interactions @xcite .",
    "in such a hypothetical interacting state the bulk gap in the half - filled zero landau level would be associated with the formation of a broken - symmetry many - body state .",
    "the variety of different ways to spontaneously break the @xmath1 symmetry in spin and valley space suggests an enormous number of potential ground states @xcite .",
    "recent experiments seem to see two such @xmath0 states@xcite , with a phase transition between them tuned by changing the zeeman coupling strength . in these experiments ,",
    "the perpendicular field @xmath2 is kept fixed while the zeeman coupling is tuned by changing the parallel field @xmath3 .",
    "being at @xmath0 , both states naturally show @xmath4 . at low zeeman coupling ,",
    "the sample has a vanishing two - terminal conductance , indicating that its state is a `` vanilla '' insulator , whereas beyond a certain critical zeeman coupling , the sample has an almost perfect two - terminal conductance of @xmath5 , suggesting that it is in a quantum spin hall state with protected edge states .",
    "the most plausible interpretation of these experiments is in view of a theoretical work of kharitonov @xcite , which predicted a @xmath6 quantum phase transition from a canted antiferromagnetic ( caf ) ( the `` vanilla '' insulator ) to a spin - polarized ferromagnetic ( fm ) quantum hall - like state tuned by increasing the zeeman energy @xmath7 to appreciable values .",
    "the behavior of the two - terminal conductance is explained by the nature of the edge modes@xcite of the two zero - temperature phases .",
    "previous investigations have shown that the fm state has a fully gapped bulk , but supports gapless , helical , charged excitations at its edge @xcite . in analogy with the quantum spin hall ( qsh ) state in two - dimensional topological insulators @xcite , the gapless edge states of the fm state are immune to backscattering by spin - conserving impurities due to their helical nature : right and left movers have opposite spin flavors .    while kharitonov s proposal is consistent with the transport experiments ,",
    "there has been no direct experimental confirmation of the nature of the two phases . in particlar ,",
    "alternatives , such as a kekule - distorted phase@xcite , are potential ground states for the low - zeeman `` vanilla '' insulator .",
    "one of our motivations in this study is to find physically measurable quantities in both phases , both at the edge and in the bulk , that provide characteristic signatures of each phase . in a previous paper@xcite",
    ", the present authors studied an extension of kharitonov s model ( to include spin - stiffness ) in the hartree - fock ( hf ) approximation .",
    "we showed , using a simple model of the edge , that a domain wall is formed near the edge .",
    "this domain wall entangles the spin and valley degrees of freedom , and leads to a single - particle spectrum which is gapped everywhere . in the bulk of the fm state ,",
    "the spins in both valleys are polarized along the total field , which we will call @xmath8 for convenience . deep into the edge",
    ", the state must have vacuum quantum numbers , and so must be a singlet .",
    "the domain wall is the region where the spin rotates continuously from being fully polarized to being a singlet , thus acquiring an @xmath9-component in spin space . at the level of hf",
    ", this appears as a spontaneous broken symmetry and an order parameter .",
    "fluctuations about hf will restore the symmetry in accordance with the mermin - wagner theorem .    in the fm phase ,",
    "the low - energy charged excitations of the system are gapless collective modes associated with a @xmath10 twist of the ground - state spin configuration in the @xmath9-plane@xcite .",
    "this spin twist is imposed upon the position - dependent @xmath11 associated with the dw , thus creating a spin _ texture _ , with an associated charge that is inherent to qh ferromagnets @xcite .",
    "gapless 1d modes associated with fluctuations of the dw ( which can be modeled as a helical luttinger liquid @xcite ) carry charge and contribute to electric conduction . in contrast",
    ", the caf phase is characterized by a gap to charged excitations on the edge @xcite , and a broken @xmath12 symmetry in the bulk ( associated with @xmath9-like order parameter ) implying a neutral , gapless bulk goldstone mode . as we have shown in our earlier work @xcite , a proper description of",
    "the lowest energy charged excitations of this state involves a coupling between topological structures at the edge and in the bulk , associated with the broken @xmath12 symmetry .    in this paper we will carry forward our previous analysis , and focus on the behavior of the collective particle - hole excitations in both phases , which we compute in the time - dependent hartree - fock ( tdhf ) approximation .",
    "our goal is three - fold : firstly , we want to verify that the charged edge modes we proposed in previous work can be seen in particle - hole excitations as well .",
    "secondly , we will find experimental signatures of the two different phases in the bulk as well as at the edge .",
    "thirdly , we want to compute a set of parameters that we can use to build an effective theory of the edge .",
