    "typically , during the course of the gravitational collapse of a massive body , a black hole event horizon forms , after which the imploding body collapses into a singularity which is hidden behind the event horizon .",
    "however , in certain models the order of horizon and singularity formation is reversed and the singularity is free to communicate with the external universe .",
    "such naked singularities are generally considered to be an undesirable feature of gravitational collapse , as they effectively destroy the classical predictability of a spacetime . in particular ,",
    "associated with the naked singularity is a cauchy horizon which represents a barrier past which the physical evolution of matter is not predictable . on a physical level naked singularities",
    "could potentially emit unlimited amounts of matter and energy .    in response to the presence of naked singularities in certain collapse models , penrose hypothesised that nature should always censor the singularity associated with gravitational collapse .",
    "in other words , this cosmic censorship hypothesis ( cch ) loosely states that physically realistic gravitational collapse will not result in naked singularity formation @xcite .",
    "although mathematically rigorous versions of the cch exist , it has not been proven .",
    "it is generally expected that some form of the cch will hold for physically reasonable spacetimes .",
    "nonetheless , studies of naked singularity spacetimes are useful , as they provide a means of examining the nature of the putative cosmic censor .",
    "furthermore , they have resulted in more precise formulations of the cch and may provide insight into how it might be proven .",
    "one manner in which a naked singularity spacetime may not be a serious counterexample to the cch is if the cauchy horizon associated with the naked singularity is not stable . in this case ,",
    "perturbations which begin their evolution as regular functions on some initial surface would diverge on the cauchy horizon .",
    "the naked singularity would then be regarded as a single ( non - typical ) member of a whole class of spacetimes , in which the cauchy horizon is replaced with a null singularity",
    ".    should perturbations of a given naked singularity spacetime behave in a finite manner at the cauchy horizon , one can in some cases still rule out this spacetime as a serious counter - example to the cch due to other defects .",
    "in particular , certain naked singularity spacetimes arise from unrealistic matter models which can form singularities even in flat spacetime ( for example , the vaidya spacetime displays this property ) .",
    "other naked singularity spacetimes display sensitivity to the choice of initial conditions , in that if the initial conditions are slightly perturbed , the naked singularity fails to form .",
    "we can neglect such spacetimes as serious counter - examples to the cch .",
    "we consider here the self - similar lematre - tolman - bondi spacetime .",
    "this is a spherically symmetric spacetime in which a pressure - free perfect fluid collapses inhomogeneously into a singularity .",
    "a spacetime displays self - similarity if it admits a homothetic killing vector field , that is , a vector field @xmath0 such that @xmath1 where @xmath2 indicates the lie derivative .",
    "the choice of non - zero constant on the right hand side is arbitrary , and can be fixed by rescaling @xmath0 . imposing the existence of a homothetic killing vector field on a spherically symmetric spacetime results in considerable simplification .",
    "the metric of a spherically symmetric spacetime can always be written in the form    @xmath3    where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are arbitrary functions of @xmath6 and @xmath7 and @xmath8 is the usual metric on a two - sphere . imposing condition ( [ selfsim ] ) results in the scalings @xmath9 where @xmath10 .",
    "see @xcite for a discussion of the role of self - similarity in general relativity .",
    "see @xcite and @xcite for a discussion of spacetimes with homothetic killing vector fields .",
    "we note that the self - similar ltb spacetime can not be taken as a serious counter - example to the cch , as the first of the abovementioned defects is present in this spacetime .",
    "the matter model used is dust , which ignores pressure ( and pressure gradients ) , and therefore can not be expected to provide a realistic description of gravitational collapse .",
    "one could also reasonably expect that this matter model would break down during the collapse to the singularity , as the curvature of the spacetime becomes extreme .",
    "nonetheless , the simplicity of this spacetime makes it a very useful toy model of gravitational collapse resulting in naked singularity formation .",
    "we also note that a natural application of this work would be the study of odd parity perturbations of the self - similar perfect fluid spacetime .",
    "this spacetime has been considered by @xcite .",
    "we also note the work of harada and maeda @xcite which discusses the role of the self - similar solution in the general spherically symmetric collapse of a perfect fluid .",
    "indeed this paper in part motivates the current work .",
    "harada and maeda have found numerical evidence of a stable naked singularity in soft fluid collapse . in this paper , we develop techniques that we hope will allow us to study the linear stability of harada and maeda s naked singularity spacetime in a rigorous mathematical fashion .    in this paper , we consider linear odd parity perturbations of the self - similar ltb spacetime .",
    "we choose to study the odd parity perturbations first as the even parity perturbations obey a far more complex system of equations which presents extra technical difficulties .",
    "we find that the odd parity perturbations remain bounded up to and on the cauchy horizon with respect to certain energy norms defined on natural spacelike hypersurfaces .",
    "one may be tempted to interpret this result as evidence against the cosmic censorship hypothesis ; however , a full treatment of the perturbations of this spacetime would have to include the linear even parity perturbations , and indeed , non - linear perturbations as far as possible .",
    "we therefore can not interpret our result concerning the behaviour of odd parity perturbations only as providing evidence against cosmic censorship .",
    "we are currently considering the behaviour of even parity perturbations of this spacetime using methods broadly similar to those of this paper , and these results will be discussed in a future paper .",
    "even parity perturbations of this spacetime have been studied both numerically @xcite and analytically @xcite .",
    "harada et al found numerical evidence of instability in the @xmath11 perturbation . in @xcite ,",
    "both a harmonic decomposition and a fourier mode decomposition of the gauge invariant perturbation variables and equations were used , and the individual fourier modes @xmath12 were analysed .",
    "it was found that modes which are finite on the past null cone remain finite on the cauchy horizon",
    ". however , the question of how to resum these modes on the cauchy horizon was not fully addressed , and so the problem of getting a complete analytic understanding the even parity linear perturbations remains unresolved .",
    "we note also that should linear perturbations turn out to grow without bound as the cauchy horizon is approached , the perturbative framework would not be valid and a full non - linear analysis would be required .    in the next section ,",
    "we describe the structure of the self - similar ltb spacetime and examine the conditions necessary for this spacetime to contain a naked singularity . in section 3",
    ", we discuss a gauge invariant perturbation formalism for spherically symmetric spacetimes due to gerlach and sengupta .",
    "we specialise this formalism to the odd partity case , and show that the matter perturbation can be entirely determined by a choice of an initial data function . in the odd parity case , the metric perturbation can be described by a single gauge - invariant scalar whose evolution is determined by the linearised einstein equations .",
    "these equations reduce to a single inhomogeneous wave equation in the gauge invariant scalar , sourced by an initial data function . in section 4",
    ", we first present an existence and uniqueness result for solutions to this equation before showing that this scalar remains finite on the cauchy horizon , subject to a specification of initial data .",
    "finiteness is measured in terms of naturally occuring energy norms evaluated on suitable hypersurfaces which are generated by the homothetic killing vector field @xmath0 .",
    "this result also applies to the first derivatives of the perturbation scalar .",
    "this indicates that there is no instability present at the level of the metric or matter perturbation . in section 5",
    "we provide a physical interpretation of our results in terms of the perturbed weyl scalars .",
    "in section 6 we make some concluding remarks .",

    "we will initially use comoving coordinates @xmath14 , in which the dust is stationary so that the dust velocity has a time component only . in these coordinates , the radius @xmath7 labels each successive shell in the collapsing dust .",
    "the line element for such a spacetime can be written in comoving coordinates as    @xmath15    where @xmath16 and @xmath17 is the physical radius of the dust .",

    "the function @xmath25 is known as the misner - sharp mass and is a suitable mass measure for spherically symmetric spacetimes .",
    "the last equation in ( [ bgnd ] ) has the form of a specific energy equation , which indicates that the function @xmath26 can be interpreted as the total energy per unit mass of the dust .",
    "the background dynamics of the dust cloud can be determined by a choice of @xmath25 ( or a specification of the initial profile of @xmath27 ) and a choice of @xmath26 .",
    "recall that a shell focusing singularity is a singularity which occurs when the physical radius @xmath17 of the dust cloud vanishes , so that all the matter shells have been `` focused '' onto a single point . in this spacetime ,",

    "this result indicates that @xmath155 remains finite up to and on the cauchy horizon , barring a possible divergence at @xmath524 ; whether or not this divergence occurs depends on the choice of the initial velocity perturbation @xmath507 .",

    "this scalar acts as a potential for the metric perturbation , the matter perturbation having been fully determined by a specification of initial data .",

    "finiteness refers to certain natural integral energy measures ( as well as pointwise values thereof ) which arise in this spacetime , whose value bounds the growth of this scalar . for the analysis of the cauchy horizon behaviour",

    "a disadvantage of this choice of foliation is that these hypersurfaces intersect the singular scaling origin of the spacetime , rather than meeting the regular centre @xmath526 .",
    "this forced us to begin our analysis by considering initial data taken from the space @xmath527 which were compactly supported away from the singular point .",

    "this extension is crucial , as it shows that a perturbation which interacts with the naked singularity still remains bounded at the cauchy horizon .    using the perturbed weyl scalars",
    ", one can give a physical interpretation of these results ; the gauge invariant scalar @xmath155 enters into the definition of the perturbed weyl scalars , which in turn represent ingoing and outgoing gravitational radiation and the perturbation of the coulomb part of the gravitational field .",
    "now since @xmath155 remains finite up to and on the cauchy horizon , this indicates that this radiation will also remain finite on the cauchy horizon ( with the exception of a possible divergence at the past endpoint of the naked singularity ) .",

    "the results already proven then show that this data remains finite on the cauchy horizon .",
    "we are currently considering this problem .",
    "the results in this paper do not support the hypothesis of cosmic censorship , which might have encouraged an expectation that such perturbations would diverge on the cauchy horizon associated with the naked singularity .",
    "the finiteness of the perturbation also suggests that it may be possible to continue the spacetime evolution past the cauchy horizon .",
    "however , we note that a full study of the behaviour of linear perturbations of this spacetime would include the even parity perturbations , which were set to zero here .",
    "the question of stability of the cauchy horizon to linear perturbations therefore can not be fully answered here .",
