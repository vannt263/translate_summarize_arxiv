    "since the reconstruction is not unique , we need to quantify the uncertainty introduced by using a template that does not exactly describe the distribution of baryons . to speed up the calculation we degraded all our templates to a resolution of @xmath70 , corresponding to healpix @xmath71 . at this resolution , at separation of @xmath72",

    "our results are not fully comparable and consistency between both methods will increase the statistical significance of any detection .",
    "planck , with its large frequency coverage and high resolution is a more adequate instrument than wmap to search for the whim contribution .",

    "alternatively , the reconstructed density field allows to select filaments aligned with the line of sight , where the optical depth of the whim would be larger .",

    "<S> the measured value is close to @xmath1k , compatible with random alignments between structure in the template and in the temperature anisotropy data . using the w1 differencing assembly to remove this systematic gives a residual correlation dominated by galactic foregrounds . _ </S>",
