    "as soon as measurements of internal velocity dispersions of high-@xmath0 galaxies became available , several authors ( e.g. @xcite ) reported that implied dynamical masses ( @xmath1 ) were lower than stellar masses ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "this is unphysical , as dynamical masses weigh stars plus dark matter and gas , while stellar masses measure stars only .",
    "stellar masses are derived from stellar population fitting , while dynamical masses are estimated assuming virial equilibrium and homology .",
    "these mass estimators are the only ones available for high-@xmath0 galaxies .",
    "we summarize some features of both mass estimators in the next subsections .",
    "this method consists in fitting spectra from stellar population synthesis models to a galaxy spectral energy distribution .",
    "this method is powerful because it can be applied to broadband photometric data .",
    "its main uncertainties come from incomplete knowledge of the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) , the star formation history and the dust attenuation .",
    "in addition , late phases of stellar evolution such as the asymptotic giant branch are difficult to model , and introduce important uncertainties in the stellar mass .",
    "the virial theorem connects the kinetic and potential energies and , hence , links internal velocities , galaxy size and dynamical mass . assuming that early - type galaxies ( etgs ) are homologous systems , i.e. they have similar dynamical structures ( they share similar density , kinematic and luminosity profiles ) , one can use this theorem to estimate dynamical masses .",
    "in particular , the above two hypotheses lead to @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a constant for all etg , @xmath5 the effective radius , @xmath6 the velocity dispersion within the effective radius and @xmath7 the gravitational constant .",
    "the validity of both hypotheses was tested in normal - sized etgs in the local universe as part of the sauron project @xcite .",
    "their galaxies were compatible with the assumption virial equilibrium and homology , and gave a calibration for the previous equation ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "dynamical masses require velocity dispersion measurements , which are costly in telescope time , and , hence , have only become available in recent years .",
    "in this section we explain the characterization of the discrepancy performed by @xcite .",
    "specifically , we describe the data of this work and we explain briefly its results .",
    "all the galaxies used by @xcite satisfy the next points :    * they are early - type , i.e. they have srsic indices @xmath9 . *",
    "they are massive , i.e. they satisfy @xmath10 . *",
    "their redshift range is @xmath11 .",
    "* they come from several data sources , including a sample of @xmath1254000 at @xmath13 from sdss nyu ( @xcite ) .       @xmath14 ratio versus redshift .",
    "figure from @xcite.,width=283 ]    figure  [ fig1 ] shows that there is not a clear trend between the @xmath14 ratio and redshift .",
    "however , we can check that @xmath15 is detected more often at high redshift .",
    "this suggests that the discrepancy could be connected with galaxy compactness , and then the strong size evolution of massive galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) would explain why the discrepancy is reported more often at high redshift .",
    "this possibility will be addressed in the next subsection .",
    "left panel shows @xmath14 ratio versus the compactness indicator @xmath16 .",
    "the hatched region of left panel indicates the area where the discrepancy can be solved tuning the imf .",
    "right panel is a schematic illustration which shows the geometrical interpretation of the compactness indicator @xmath16 : it is the distance of a galaxy to the nearby scaling relationship for etgs determined by @xcite . left panel from @xcite.,title=\"fig:\",width=283 ]    left panel shows @xmath14 ratio versus the compactness indicator @xmath16 .",

    "[ fig2 ] shows that there is a clear trend between the @xmath14 ratio and the compactness indicator @xmath16 .",
    "the compactness indicator @xmath16 of a galaxy is defined as the ratio between its radius and the radius that it would have if it followed the nearby scaling relationship for etgs determined by @xcite .",
    "the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] illustrates the geometric interpretation of this compactness indicator : it is the distance of a galaxy to the nearby scaling relationship for etgs .",
    "as the imf is the main uncertainty in the estimation of stellar mass , one could think that tuning this parameter the discrepancy perhaps could be solved .",
    "the hatched region of left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] indicates the area where the discrepancy , @xmath15 , can be solved by tuning the imf .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows that many galaxies lie in the forbidden region of the diagram even after tuning the imf .",

    "dashed line is the the nearby scaling relationship for etgs determined by @xcite .",
    "figure from @xcite . ]",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] shows that the trend between @xmath14 ratio and the compactness indicator @xmath16 is also present in the nearby universe .",
    "in this section we explain a possible solution to the discrepancy between masses proposed by @xcite .    recalling the description of both mass estimators in sect .",
    "[ subsec : stellar_mass ] and [ subsec : dyn_mass ] , and given that changing the imf does not solve the discrepancy ( see sect .",
    "[ subsec : compactness ] ) , we investigate whether relaxing the homology assumption can bring stellar and dynamical masses to be consistent with each other .    assuming that homology is not satisfied on any etg , a solution to the discrepancy between stellar and dynamical masses is to make the @xmath4 parameter from eq .",
    "( [ eq : virial ] ) depend on galaxy compactness .",
    "doing this it is found that @xmath4 should satisfy the next equation : @xmath17     variation of @xmath4 to solve mass discrepancies depending on the stellar mass  size plane position .",
    "dashed line is the nearby scaling relationship for etgs determined by @xcite .",
    "figure from @xcite . ]",
    "figure  [ fig4 ] shows the results of applying the eq .",
    "( [ eq : k ] ) .",
    "it is worth noting that this equation implies @xmath4 values which are often an order of magnitude higher than the value measured on the massive , nearby , normal - sized ellipticals .",
    "( [ eq : k ] ) also implies the next non - virial scaling of dynamical mass with effective radius and velocity dispersion : @xmath18",
    "the takeaway messages of the work by @xcite are :    * there is a discrepancy between dynamical and stellar masses : + several authors ( e.g. @xcite ) have reported that they find stellar masses greater than virial masses at low and high redshift .",
    "* this discrepancy scales with galaxy compactness : + the discrepancy between dynamical and stellar masses increases as galaxies depart from the nearby scaling relationship between stellar mass and size for ellipticals . * non - homology can solve the discrepancy : + as the validity of the homology assumption has been only tested in the nearby scaling relationship between stellar mass and size , the most likely solution seems that the dynamical structure of ellipticals depends on galaxy compactness .",
