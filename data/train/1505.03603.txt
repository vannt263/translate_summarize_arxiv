    "the ads / cft correspondence has been proved as a unique approach to study the strongly coupled field theories @xcite . recently , there appeared a new direction in applying this correspondence to shed some lights in condensed matter physics , with the hope that the strongly coupled systems can be computationally tractable and conceptually more transparent ( for a review , see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the simplest example of the duality between the superconductor and gravity theory was first formulated in @xcite . in the gravity side",
    "one has einstein - maxwell - charged scalar theory with negative cosmological constant , which usually has static reissner - nordstrom - ads ( rn - ads ) black hole solutions with vanishing scalar hair .",
    "however in the low temperature , because of the coupling between the maxwell field and the charged scalar field , the rn - ads black hole is expected to become unstable and finally the black hole will have the scalar hair breaking the @xmath2-gauge symmetry spontaneously .",
    "the rn - ads and hairy black holes are remarkably identified as the normal and superconducting phases of a superconductor realized in the dual field theory on the ads boundary .",
    "this striking connection between condensed matter and gravitational physics is expected to be a hopeful approach to disclose the properties of strongly correlated electron systems .",
    "most available studies on this topic were concentrated on the static ads black hole backgrounds dual to the superconductors reflected by the dual operators on the ads boundary with equilibrium or nearly equilibrium dynamics @xcite-@xcite .    as gravitational theorists ,",
    "one of our motivations of seeking a dual description of superconductivity , which is below our usual energy bandwidth , is to understand more on the black hole physics , for example how the scalar hair attaches to the bald ads black hole to make the black hole become hairy step by step , what conditions stimulate or prevent the condensation of the scalar hair onto the ads black hole , what characteristics of the transformation between the ads bald black hole and the hairy one are , what spacetime properties are for the developed hairy ads black holes , etc . to answer these questions",
    ", we can not just look at the dual operator on the ads boundary in an equilibrium system , we need to concentrate on the non - equilibrium dynamics in the bulk gravitational configurations to disclose the process of addressing the scalar hair onto the bald ads black hole . in @xcite ,",
    "the non - equilibrium process in the bulk einstein - maxwell - scalar background has been studied .",
    "it was observed that during the time evolution , the initial scalar perturbation in the bulk spacetime first moves towards the ads boundary , it is then bounced back by the ads wall , grows and moves towards the bald black hole .",
    "subsequently this perturbation falls onto the bald black hole and accumulates there and finally makes the bald black hole become hairy .",
    "the time evolutions of the event and apparent horizons of the bulk black hole in the ads bulk were disclosed in @xcite .",
    "employing the ads / cft duality , the authors related the observed properties in the ads bulk to the boundary cft , and further they displayed the time dependence of the superconducting order parameter in the holographic superconductor .",
    "the attempt in the non - equilibrium approach has been generalized to the study of the dynamical phase diagram corresponding to quantum quenches of source field where the bulk black hole perturbation spectrum has been investigated in relating to the distinct behaviors on the boundary cft @xcite .",
    "more extensions of the non - equilibrium physics in describing the transformation of an unstable anisotropic black hole without scalar hair into a stable hairy black hole , which relates to the holographic superconductor with anisotropy , have been done in @xcite .",
    "further works on the far - from - equilibrium dynamics of holographic superconductor including periodic driven system @xcite , quantum quench of a superconducting ads soliton @xcite , holographic thermalization @xcite and the formation of topological defects @xcite have also been extensively studied .    motivated by the application of the mermin - wagner theorem to the holographic superconductors ,",
    "there have been a lot of interest in generalizing the einstein gravity background in the holographic superconductor to the gravity including the curvature correction . by examining the charged scalar field together with a maxwell field in the gauss - bonnet - ads black hole background @xcite , it has been observed that the higher curvature correction makes the holographic superconductor harder to form . besides the curvature correction to the gravity ,",
    "it is also interesting to investigate the high - order correction related to the gauge field . in the study of the ratio of shear viscosity to entropy density",
    ", it was found that the higher derivative correction to the gravity has different effect from that of the higher derivative correction to the gauge field @xcite .",
    "this motivates people to study the effect of higher order corrected maxwell field on the scalar condensation and compare with the effect brought by the correction in the gravity @xcite .",
    "since heisenberg and euler @xcite noted that quantum electrodynamics predicts that the electromagnetic field behaves nonlinearly through the presence of virtual charged particles , the nonlinear electrodynamics has been studied a lot for many years @xcite . in the low - energy limit of heterotic string theory",
    ", the higher - order correction term appears also in the maxwell gauge field @xcite .",
    "born - infeld electrodynamics @xcite is the only possible nonlinear version of electrodynamics which is invariant under electromagnetic duality transformations @xcite .",
    "the nonlinear electromagnetic fields in logarithmic form appears in the description of vacuum polarization effects .",
    "the form was obtained as exact 1-loop corrections for electrons in an uniform electromagnetic field background by euler and heisenberg @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the author discussed a simple example of a born - infeld - like lagrangian with a logarithmic term which can be added as a correction to the original born - infeld one . replacing the maxwell field with the nonlinear electromagnetic field , it was disclosed from the behavior of the boundary operator in the cft that the nonlinearity in born - infeld and the logarithmic form fields can make holographic superconductor difficult to form @xcite .",
    "in the corresponding bulk spacetime , it was observed that the nonlinearity of the electromagnetic field can hinder the growing mode to appear in the scalar perturbation @xcite , which is consistent with the phenomenon on the boundary cft .",
    "other works on holographic dual models in the presence of nonlinear corrections to the maxwell electrodynamics can also be found in @xcite .",
    "these discussions were concentrated on the equilibrium state both in the bulk and boundary . to understand more on how these two kinds of nonlinear corrections in the electromagnetic fields influence the scalar condensation in the holographic superconductor , we can not only concentrate on the equilibrium state but also study the non - equilibrium condensation process in holographic superconductor with nonlinear electrodynamics .",
    "this can help us see closely how the nonlinearity in the electrodynamics influences the condensation of the scalar hair in the process of the black hole evolution and transformation , it also can aid us to see how the nonlinearity affect the phase transition in the boundary system .    in this paper we will concentrate more on the non - equilibrium bulk spacetime .",

    "we will give equations of motion and the initial and boundary conditions to solve them . in section iii",
    ", we will show the numerical results in the non - equilibrium bulk system .",

    "we will describe the time evolution of the event and apparent horizons of the black hole in the bulk .",
    "furthermore , we will display the time evolution of the holographic entanglement entropy and its dependence on the nonlinearity of the electromagnetic field .",

    "we see that below the critical temperature when the scalar field starts to condensate , the entanglement entropy becomes smaller in the non - equilibrium process .",
    "this is consistent with the expectation that in the condensation of the scalar field , certain kind of `` paring mechanics '' triggers the decrease of degrees of freedom due to the formation of ",

    "when the nonlinearity of the electromagnetic field becomes stronger , the non - equilibrium process is longer and the entanglement entropy takes longer time to decrease to a constant value .",

    "fixing @xmath123 , the final value of the entanglement entropy for stronger nonlinearity in the electromagnetic field is lower , which shows that for the stronger nonlinear electromagnetic field there is a larger reduction in the number of degrees of freedom .    figs .",
    "[ bineheetc ] and [ lneheetc ] depict the normalized holographic entanglement entropy as a function of the boundary time @xmath119 . in the left plots , the curves with various @xmath8 do nt intersect with each other .",
    "this is mainly because increasing parameter @xmath8 the critical temperature of the system is lowered , as those shown in table .",
    "i , thus the impact is that the curves with larger @xmath8 move upward much more than those with smaller @xmath8 . in the right plots we plot the net change @xmath124 . from figs .",
    "[ bineheetc ] and [ lneheetc ] , we also reach the conclusion that , fixing @xmath125 , in a gravitational system with higher nonlinear electromagnetic field , it needs longer period for the system to complete the condensate , and for superconducting phase more degrees of freedom have condensed .",
    "in this paper , we have investigated the non - equilibrium condensation process in the holographic superconductor with nonlinear electromagnetic fields .",
    "we have solved the time evolutions of the gravitational system in the bulk configurations .",
    "following @xcite , we started with small scalar perturbations in the asymptotic ads black hole , which was a static bald ads black hole at the beginning . when the temperature is lowered below the critical value @xmath1 , the initial scalar perturbations grow exponentially and the original bald ads black hole spacetime gives way to a hairy black hole step by step .",
    "finally the condensation of the scalar hair forces the formation of a new hairy black hole .    in this non - equilibrium process , we have observed the formation of the scalar hair step by step . especially in the evolutions of the bulk dynamics",
    "we have found the clues why the nonlinearity in the electromagnetic fields hinders the formation of the hairy black hole .",
    "the final configuration of the gravitational system indicates that to be stable the black hole needs developing more scalar hair in the model with higher nonlinearity electromagnetic field .",
    "we also observed that , fixing @xmath122 , the nonlinearity makes the condensation process of the scalar field onto black hole longer . in the gravity side",
    "we also have examined the evolution of horizons in the non - equilibrium transformation process from the bald ads black hole to the ads hairy one .",
    "fixing @xmath122 , both the evolutions of the apparent and event horizons showed that with the nonlinear corrections in the electromagnetic field , the original ads black hole configurations require more time to finish the transformation to become hairy black hole .",
    "as for the superconducting order parameter in the boundary theory , we clarified for the model with stronger nonlinearity in the electromagnetic field , it costs more time for the order parameter to approach a bigger saturation value , which means the boundary system is harder to arrive at the superconducting phase . as we know , for the holographic superconductor the superconducting phase of the boundary system corresponds to a stable hairy black hole in bulk .",
    "the results obtained in both the bulk and boundary sides are consistent .    considering the intriguing physical meaning of the holographic entanglement entropy in studying the quantum system and its effectiveness in describing the degrees of freedom in a system , we have generalized our non - equilibrium study of the problem by examining the holographic entanglement entropy .",
    "for the stronger nonlinearity of the electromagnetic field , fixing @xmath122 , the non - equilibrium process is longer and the entanglement entropy takes longer time to decrease to a constant value which means it needs longer period for the boundary system to form the `` cooper pairs '' to complete the condensate .",
