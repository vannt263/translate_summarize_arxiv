    "the electronic transport in quantum dot structures is of great interest and has been the subject of active research in recent years .",

    "many interesting phenomena which appear in real atoms and molecules can be well manifested in these nanostructures .",
    "tunability provides much more opportunities for exploring richer physics which is hard to access in real atoms / molecules .",
    "it also leads to various applications .",
    "for instance , novel quantum logical gates and elementary qubits in quantum computers@xcite could be realized based on these systems .    in these nanostructures , quantum coherence and interference",
    "is one of the most important issues and leads to a lot of interesting phenomena such as aharonov - bohm ( ab ) oscillations@xcite , kondo effect@xcite , coherent trapping@xcite , fano resonance@xcite and so on . in recent years",
    ", double and triple quantum dots have attracted much attention due to their rich electric structure and physical phenomena .",
    "an ab interferometer containing two qds has been realized@xcite .",
    "some experimental groups have been able to fabricate triple quantum dots with hight quality @xcite , and many relevant theoretical studies have been conducted on these systems@xcite . in spite of many studies on the multiple quantum dots ,",
    "relatively little attention has been paid to the photon - assistant transport in multiple quantum dots driven by a time - period electric field . moreover , periodic driven triple quantum dots with the relevant three - level structure may have some interesting interference phenomena , such as coherent trapping , like those in quantum optics . in this paper",
    "we study the photon - assistant transport in mcqds ( see fig.1 ) paying special attention to the consequences of those interesting interference phenomena .        in previous theoretical work on mcqds ,",
    "the quantum levels , which depend on the structures of the system , are often assumed as parameters@xcite , and the quantum properties of mcqds can not be presented quantitatively .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to reveal the quantum behavior of mcqds based on more realistic model . in our approach ,",
    "we first design dqds and stqds ( with @xmath0-type three - level structure ) using a two - dimensional confining model in the effective mass frame . based on the obtained level structure and with the help of floquet theory@xcite",
    ", we study the transport properties of the dqds and stqds .",
    "it is found for both symmetrical and asymmetrical configurations of coupled dqds , there is photon - assisted fano resonances in parallel dqds , and a symmetric resonance in serial dqds .",
    "the electronic transport is * very * different from that in stqds with @xmath0-type energy level : the photon - assistant tunneling leads to the symmetric breit - wigner@xcite resonance when the system is asymmetric ( between left and right quantum dots ) .",
    "when the system is in a symmetric ( between left and right quantum dots ) configuration , the formation of  trapping dark state \" results in the interesting asymmetric fano resonance under resonant condition ( photon energy equals to the energy difference between left / right quantum dot and the middle dot . )",

    "this formulism is valid for general n serially coulped qds system . @xcite        in our numerical calculations , we assume @xmath90 and set the energy independent dots - lead hopping rate @xmath91 , the applied voltage @xmath92 , and the ac field magnitude @xmath93 .",
    "first we study the transport properties of an asymmetric system by applying different confining potentials to the left and right dots .",
    "the average current - frequency curves of serially and parallel dqds with @xmath94 are shown in fig.3 ( a ) and ( b ) respectively .",
    "we find that the current curve has a symmetric breit - wigner line shape when the two dots are serial , and the current has an asymmetric fano line shape when the dots are parallel . here",
    "the breit - wigner line shape is a consequence of photon - assistant resonant , i.e. , @xmath95 .",
    "the new photon - assistant fano lineshape comes from the interference between photon - modified bound - antibound channels .",
    "then we apply the same confining potentials to the two dots and research the electron transport of a symmetric system .",
    "the results with @xmath96 are displayed in fig.3 ( c ) and ( d ) .",
    "similarly , we find that a breit - wigner resonance appears in the serially dqds and a fano resonance occurs in the parallel dqds . from above discussion , we conclude that the ac electric field can induce the photon - assisted fano resonances for both symmetrical and asymmetrical parallel configurations of dqds , but can not induce fano resonance in the serially dqds , whether the system is symmetric or not , which means that the energy level of dqds does not have remarkable impact on the transport properties .      as one observes in the last section that there is no fano effect in a serially coupled dqd due the lack of apparent interference channels .",
    "one may expect that there is also no fano resonance in a stqd . however , our studies shows the transport in stqd is quite different from that in a dqd , and we will give a quite different story in this section .",
    "based on the results of electronic structure in section ii , we study the transport properties through the system with @xmath0-type three - level structure ( fig.2 ) under the action of an ac driving field with a frequency @xmath97 . in our numerical calculations , we set the applied voltage @xmath98 , and the other parameters we have chosen are the same as the ones for dqds .",
    "we first study the transport properties of an asymmetric system by applying different confining potentials to the left and right dots .",
    "the average current @xmath88 as a function of the driving frequency @xmath97 with @xmath94 is presented in fig.4 ( a ) .",
    "we find the current curve has a symmetric breit - wigner line shape around @xmath99 , suggesting that there is a resonance for electrons in the system in this case ( @xmath100 ) .",
    "the time evolution of the probabilities for an electron in left , middle , right dot are shown in fig.4 ( b ) .",
    "here we have performed our calculation in a closed system ( i.e.,without interaction with the leads ) and have used the initial condition @xmath101 and the resonant condition @xmath99 .",
    "4(c ) shows the time average of the probability distribution of floquet states , @xmath102 .",
    "it is clear that there is a photon assistant mixing between left and middle dot .",
    "this photon assistant charge transfer leads to the occurrence of the current resonance phenomenon .",
    "then we consider the case that the system is symmetric by applying the same confining potential to the two side dots .",
    "the average current @xmath88 as a function of the driving frequency @xmath97 with @xmath6 is displayed in fig.4 ( d ) .",
    "we find that the current curve has an asymmetric fano line shape around @xmath103 and the current amplitude is much larger than that in the asymmetric case . in order to understand the intriguing phenomenon , we did similar calculation of the time evolution of the occupation probabilities for an electron in left , middle , right dot and the time average of probability distribution of floquet states .",
    "as shown in fig.4 ( e ) and ( f ) , we find that two delocalized floquet states ( which is related to bonding and antibonding states ) are formed and another floquet state is still localized in the middle dot in this case , indicating that the middle dot mediates the super - exchange interaction between the left and right dots .",
    "the states @xmath104 behave like  trapping dark state \" in atomic system .",
    "though state @xmath32 has a very small occupation probability in the left and right dots , it plays an important role in the occurrence of the fano - type resonance , which can be presented in the following discussion .    as seen from eq .",
    "( 19 ) , three floquet states form three conducting channels . due to the interaction with leads , the three states may have different width . in the symmetric situation ,",
    "the bonding and antibonding floquet states @xmath105 , @xmath106 have large occupation probability in left and right dots , thus are strongly coupled to the leads .",
    "they have wide width and can be viewed as continuous channels .",
    "the localized floquet state @xmath107 has small occupation probability in left and right dots and is weakly coupled to the leads .",
    "it has very narrow width and can be viewed as resonant discrete channel .",
    "the interference between strongly coupled channels and weakly coupled channel leads to the observed fano resonance@xcite . while in the asymmetric situation ,",
    "the floquet state @xmath107 is also effectively coupled to the leads via a photon - assistant mixing between left and middle dot .",
    "thus all three states form strongly coupled channels , so no fano effect is observed .",
    "here we discuss in detail the interference between different channels . from eq .",
    "( 19 ) , one can see that the average current @xmath88 is mainly decided by @xmath108 .",
    "the interference effects can be seen from following calculation ( here we show term with @xmath109 , @xmath110 as an example ) @xmath111 in fig.5 , we show the phases @xmath112 as the functions of the driving frequency @xmath97 . here , the phases @xmath113 and @xmath114 are phases of two strongly coupled states @xmath105 and @xmath106 , and @xmath115 is the phase of the weakly coupled state @xmath107 . from fig.4 , we find that @xmath115 has a phase shift that varies from 0 to @xmath116 as the field frequency @xmath97 is moved through the resonance frequency , which provides resonant channel for electrons to transport the system .",
    "@xmath113 , @xmath114 are nearly constant and can be assumed to be independent of the driving frequency , which can be considered as background or nonresonant channels .",
    "therefore , the interference between the strongly coupled channels and weakly coupled channel results in the fano - type resonance .",
    "finally , we would like to point out that the above picture also explains why there is no fano resonance in a serially coupled double dot . as a matter of fact , in that situation ,",
    "there are only strongly coupled bonding and antibonding states .",
    "therefore , there is no apparent fano effect .    in summary",
    ", we have studied the transport properties of dqds and stqds under the action of an ac electric field . using a two - dimensional confining potential model in the effective mass frame , the two - level structure and @xmath0-type three - level structure",
    "are obtained through solving the generalized eigenvalue of the system .",
    "based on the level structure and floquet theory , we investigate the dependence of the ac current on the electronic structure of the system .",
    "it is found that the two - level structure does not influence the transport properties of dqds remarkably .",
    "for both symmetric and asymmetric configurations , there is fano resonance in parallel dqds and no fano resonance in serial dqds .",
    "however , it is a different case for stqds .",
    "the @xmath0-type three - level structure has great impact on electron transport : when the system is asymmetric , the symmetric breit - wigner resonance appears due to phonon assistant tunneling ; when the system is symmetric , the interesting asymmetric fano resonance occurs under resonant condition . in this case , quantum interference results in the formation of trapping dark states .",
    "these trapping dark states are the delocalized bonding and antibonding states which serve as the continuous channels . here",
    "the middle dot plays a dual role : ( 1 ) it mediates the super - exchange interaction between the left and the right dots ; ( 2 ) the localized state within it serves as the resonant discrete channel .",
    "our work presents the unique quantum interference features of the multiple quantum dots system and is useful for the design of novel nanodevices . in short , for transport in a system with n quantum dots , the situation with n=1 , is different from that with n=2 and the case with n=2 is different from that with n=3 .",
