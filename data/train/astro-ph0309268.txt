    "data from the 2dfgrs ( lewis et al . 2002 ) and the sdss ( gomez et al . 2003 , hogg et al . 2003 ) indicate that there is a deficit of star - forming galaxies in dense regions .",
    "direct evidence of star - formation suppression in regions less extreme than rich clusters remains , however , controversial ( carlberg et al .",
    "2001 , bower & balogh 2003 ) . to explore",
    "whether the suppression of star - forming activity and the local number of neighbours are related , we analyse the environment of star - forming and passive galaxies in the 2dfgrs ( type 3 + 4 and type 1 respectively as in madgwick et al . 2002 ) .",
    "the sample includes all 10695 galaxies in the redshift range [ 0.0005 - 0.25 ] with @xmath2 between 17 and 17.5 . for each galaxy",
    "we have automatically identified neighbours , i.e. galaxies lying within an area of 1@xmath3mpc radius ( computed at the redshift of the galaxy ) and @xmath4cz@xmath51000kms@xmath6 . because the 2dfgrs is complete for b@xmath7@xmath8[17 - 19.5 ]",
    "we identify all neighbours from equally - luminous to @xmath92-mag - fainter .",
    "the average number of neighbours of 2df galaxies , averaged in bins of absolute magnitude , is shown in fig.1 .",
    "the average for all galaxies ( empty circles ) and for passive ( squares ) and star - forming ( triangles ) subsamples are plotted . the left panel shows the average when counting neighbours whose luminosity is @xmath10equal ( @xmath11@xmath4b@xmath7@xmath11@xmath120.5 ) to the one of the galaxy itself while the right one shows the average when counting much fainter neighbours ( 1.5@xmath12@xmath4b@xmath7@xmath122.5 ) .",
    "1 shows that star - forming galaxies inhabit regions which are less dense than passive galaxies .",
    "however , while fainter galaxies segregate in both panels , bright galaxies only segregate when faint neighbours are counted .",
    "the right panel indicates that among the brightest galaxies ( mag@xmath12 - 20 ) , only passive galaxies display an increasingly excess of faint neighbours .",
    "the difference in the number of faint neighbours might trace a difference in the mass of the halos hosting bright passive and bright star - forming galaxies ( magliocchetti & porciani 2003 ) .",
    "star - forming galaxies might be in a small mass halos where the cooling gas is channeled to one or two galaxies , while passive galaxies might be in more massive halos ( m@xmath1310@xmath0m@xmath1 ) which are accreating smaller ones , and whose pre - existing galaxies survive as distinct entities(berlind et al .",
    "2003 ) . to assess that the lack of faint neighbours around bright star - forming galaxies indicates that they reside in smaller mass systems also matches observations indicating that diffuse x - emission is restricted to groups with a dominant e - s0 ( mulchaey et al .",
    "2003 , helsdon et al .",
    "observations are thus supporting the hyphothesis that star - formation is suppressed in bright galaxies residing in any group more massive than 10@xmath0m@xmath1 , rather than in clusters only .",
