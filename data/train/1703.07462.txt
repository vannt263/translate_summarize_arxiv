    "recently , rapid development of wireless networks has led to a great concern about their energy consumption and motivated a trend to establish a new branch of communications called  green communications \" @xcite .",
    "the main goal of the green communications is to consume the least energy and at the same time satisfy the required quality of service ( qos ) .",
    "energy efficiency ( ee ) is a popular metric for the green communications which is defined as the ratio of the total sum - rate of the network to the total consumed energy @xcite .    in the wireless networks ,",
    "the capability and lifetime of battery powered devices are limited by their battery capacities . in recent years",
    ", different energy harvesting ( eh ) techniques are introduced to address the problem of battery limitation in wireless devices by harvesting energy from surrounding environment@xcite .",
    "recently , some other methods have been introduced for simultaneous wireless information and power transfer ( swipt ) that can harvest energy from the received signals @xcite , @xcite . in swipt",
    ", the receiver in each node can simultaneously be an information decoder and an energy receiver @xcite . to implement swipt",
    ", receivers apply time switching ( ts ) or power splitting ( ps ) mechanisms @xcite .",
    "the ts receiver periodically switches between information decoding and energy harvesting , whereas the ps receiver splits the received power into decoding power and harvesting power .",
    "one of the schemes that can be used to improve ee of the wireless networks is multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) technique .",
    "thanks to the diversity gain achieved by the mimo , much less power is required to get the same performance as a single - antenna system , which leads to higher energy efficiencies @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "another method for increasing ee in the wireless networks is cooperative communications based on relaying schemes @xcite .",
    "two - way relay network ( twrn ) which allows bidirectional communications between two end nodes provides a high ee @xcite .",
    "the ee of the twrn can also be improved by combining with mimo techniques @xcite .",
    "the authors in @xcite maximized the ee of a mimo twrn with the optimal power allocation . in @xcite , an energy efficient antenna - selection algorithm for a mimo twrn",
    "was proposed .",
    "the authors in @xcite , considered an energy efficient beamforming design for a mimo twrn in which the beamforming in the relay node is designed based on zero - forcing ( zf ) criterion and just the beamforming vectors of the transceivers are optimized based on ee maximization . in @xcite , the authors studied an energy efficient beamforming design in a mimo twrn .    on the other hand , by combining the eh methods with the above mentioned energy efficient techniques , it is possible to considerably compensate the energy shortage issues in the wireless networks .",
    "the energy harvesting techniques in multiple - antenna twrns were studied in @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "a relay beamforming design for swipt in a multiple - antenna twrn was examined which maximizes the sum - rate under a constraint on the harvested energy .",
    "the authors in @xcite considered the same problem with the objective of secrecy rate maximization .",
    "a beamforming design for a multiple - antenna twrn based on minimizing the relay transmit power was introduced in @xcite , where the transceivers are capable of eh .",
    "the authors in @xcite designed a relay precoder and a source decoder in a swipt mimo twrn based on minimum mean - square - error ( mmse ) criterion . to the best of our knowledge , an ee based precoding",
    "design in mimo relay networks for swipt has not been studied in the literature before .    in this paper",
    ", we deal with the ee maximization precoding design and energy harvesting approach in a mimo twrn .",
    "the network comprises two transceivers and one amplify - and - forward ( af ) relay node which provides bidirectional communications between these transceivers .",
    "we assume that one of the transceivers is battery limited and harvests energy from the received signals with the ps mechanism .",
    "this extra energy achieved by the swipt helps the battery limited transceiver in performing advanced processing like mimo functions . on the other hand",
    ", an existence of multiple antennas on that node can improve the swipt performance@xcite .    in this study , we design the precoders at the transceivers and the relay based on the ee maximization approach .",
    "another remarkable point is that the proposed swipt structure is adaptive , which provides the optimal ps factor while designing the precoders . to optimize the ee",
    ", we apply constraints on the transmit power of all nodes , the amount of harvested energy and also on the qos of two transceivers in terms of the minimum acceptable data - rate .",
    "to solve the resulting optimization problem , we adopt an eigenvalue decomposition approach , which leads to a closed - form solution for the transmit directions of the nodes .",
    "then , the ee function is decomposed into three sub - functions : two of them are pseudo - concave in terms of the transceivers and relay power vectors and the third one on the ps factor is concave . then , an efficient algorithm is proposed to solve these sub - problems in alternation by using conventional convex optimization tools .",
    "the optimality and complexity of the proposed algorithm are investigated , and sufficient conditions for the optimality are derived . finally , we present the simulation results for evaluating the proposed scheme .",
    "our numerical results show the efficiency of the proposed precoding method in improving the ee of the swipt mimo twrn .    the rest of this paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec:2 ] , the system model is presented and then , the ee problem is formulated in section [ sec:3 ] . in section [ sec:4 ] , an alternating algorithm is introduced for solving the ee maximization problem and its optimality and complexity are analyzed .",

    "as shown in fig . [ fig:1 ] , we consider a twrn which comprises two transceiver nodes @xmath9 and @xmath10 and a single half - duplex relay node @xmath11 equipped with @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 antennas , respectively . the direct link between @xmath9 and @xmath10 is assumed to be negligible and transmission occurs only via the relay node .",

    "[ fig:1 ] , data communications between @xmath9 and @xmath10 occur in two consecutive time - slots . during the first time - slot or so - called the multiple access ( mac ) phase , two transceivers transmit their signals to the relay node . in this phase ,",

    ", we assume that the channels are quasi - static and hence the channel matrices @xmath33 and @xmath34 remain the same at two time - slots . by substituting @xmath35 and @xmath36 in ( [ eq:2 ] )",
    ", we have @xmath37    the power splitter at @xmath9 divides the received signal into an information decoder and an energy harvester .",
    "accordingly , the harvested power at @xmath9 can be expressed as @xmath38 where @xmath39 and the efficiency of the energy harvester is assumed @xmath40 .    according to ( [ eq:3 ] ) ,",
    "the received signals at @xmath9 and @xmath10 contain a desired signal term and also a self - interference term which is looped back from the relay node .",
    "we assume that a central processor exists in the network that has access to all channel state information ( csi ) and other required information for designing the precoding matrices .",
    "then , this processor feeds back the calculated data to all the network nodes .",
    "hence , the transceivers receive the precoding matrices and can easily remove the self - interference term @xmath41 in ( [ eq:3 ] ) .",

    "then , defining the variables @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 , ( [ eq:12 ] ) can be expressed as @xmath93    due to the property 1 expressed in appendix , the denominator of the ee in ( [ eq:13 ] ) can be minimized such that @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "in addition , by exploiting property 2 proved in appendix , the numerator is maximized when @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "therefore , the solutions achieved from property 1 and property 2 lead to the maximization of the numerator and minimization of denominator of the objective function , simultaneously .",
    "then , we have @xmath99 and @xmath100 . accordingly",
    ", we can see that in order to have @xmath101 , the relation @xmath102 is required .",

    "similarly , for @xmath106 and @xmath107 we have @xmath108 and @xmath109 @xmath110 .",
    "thus , in order to derive the above equations , the relay unitary precoding matrices should be @xmath111 .",

    "hence , it is a pseudo - concave function with respect to @xmath124 .",
    "moreover , the ee is concave in @xmath16 and thus the related optimization problem has a closed - form solution with respect to it . to prove these properties",
    ", we define the @xmath22th summation term in ( [ eq:15 ] ) as @xmath130 and calculate the hessian of it which is represented as @xmath131    as the eigenvalues are non - negative , we have @xmath132 and hence , the numerator of the ee is concave with respect to @xmath133 .",
    "moreover , a sum of concave functions is also concave and the denominator is affine @xcite .",
    "hence , the ee function is pseudo - concave with respect to @xmath134 .",
    "similarly , the ee is concave with respect to @xmath16 .",
    "as expressed in the previous section , the ee maximization problem is determined over four variables @xmath16 , @xmath135 and @xmath124 , and thus it is quite difficult to solve this problem efficiently . in this section",
    ", first we find the optimal value for @xmath16 while fixing other variables .",
    "then , we apply a convex optimization method to optimize the pseudo - concave functions with respect to each variable and introduce an alternating optimization algorithm to solve them .",
    "first , considering that all the variables except @xmath16 are given , the resulting ee problem is monotonically increasing and hence the optimal value of the ps factor can be expressed as @xmath136    then with a fixed @xmath16 , we should find the eigenvalues for the relay and transceivers . in order to tackle this problem , we employ dinkelbach s algorithm which guarantees convergence to the global solution of concave - convex fractional programming @xcite . here",
    "we have a pseudo - concave function @xmath137 , where @xmath138 is concave and @xmath139 is linear .",
    "defining the function @xmath140 as @xmath141 with continuous and positive @xmath142 and @xmath143 and compact @xmath144 , @xmath140 is convex , strictly decreasing and has a unique root @xmath145 .",
    "the problem of finding @xmath140 can be solved with convex optimization approaches and it is shown that the problem of maximizing @xmath137 is equivalent to determining @xmath145 @xcite .",
    "the ee function is not jointly pseudo - concave in @xmath146 and hence the ee maximization problem should be solved in alternation . for each @xmath147 ,",
    "the dinkelbach s algorithm can be summarized as algorithm 1 below . here",
    ", the superscript @xmath148 denotes the iteration number .",
    "1.2        [ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      the proposed algorithm generates an increasing objective function at each iteration and it is upper - bounded and hence , convergence is guaranteed . it should be noted that since the ee function is not jointly pseudo - concave in all variables , the achievement of the global optimum is not guaranteed .",
    "however , in the following , we analyze the optimality of the problem and derive some conditions in order to obtain the global optimum .    in order to simplify the optimality proof of the proposed algorithm",
    ", we consider the optimization of the eigenvalues of the relay and transceivers as one step . therefore , for a given @xmath149 , the optimized eigenvalue vectors @xmath150 are obtained .",
    "then , @xmath151 is updated as ( [ eq:17 ] ) by using these vectors . we assume a high snr condition and",
    "eliminate the term  1 \" in the objective function of ( [ eq:15 ] ) .",
    "then , the numerator of the objective function can be rewritten as @xmath152 which is jointly concave in @xmath153 with a fixed @xmath16 .",
    "note that some constraints are still coupled which results in a non - convex feasible set .",
    "it is proved that this non - convex feasible set can be approximated by an inner convex approximation which guarantees the convergence to a karush - kuhn - tucker ( kkt ) point @xcite , @xcite .",
    "in addition , the proposed alternating algorithm can be viewed as a mapping @xmath154 from @xmath149 to @xmath151 which can be written as @xmath155 given by @xmath156    it is shown in @xcite and @xcite that a mapping @xmath154 converges to a global optimum when the initial point is feasible and the following properties are met :    * @xmath157 * if @xmath158 , then @xmath159 , * for any @xmath160 , @xmath161 .    in our mapping , the first condition holds . for the second condition , with a feasible @xmath16 , in order to maintain the problem feasible for @xmath158 , we have @xmath162    according to ( [ eq:17 ] ) , it can be seen that @xmath159 . it should be noticed that for the optimality proof , we have assumed that the optimal values are inside the feasible set ( not the boundaries ) . in other words ,",
    "this is another implication of the high snr condition noted in this paper .    in order to inspect the third condition , since @xmath163 for @xmath164 ,",
    "the rate constraints are not influenced and only the energy harvesting constraint should be noticed to maintain the problem feasible . in this regard , the eigenvalues should be calculated as @xmath165 by updating @xmath166 and @xmath167 and considering @xmath168 , @xmath169 and the second property of mapping , @xmath170 can be written as @xmath171 thus , we have the third property .",
    "although the optimality of the proposed algorithm is guaranteed in high snrs , in the next section , by following a similar numerical experiment as in @xcite , we will show that also in the low snr regime , the proposed algorithm results in the ees which are very close to the optimal values .",
    "now we address the computational complexity of the proposed algorithm which employs dinkelbach s algorithm . one important feature of dinkelbach s algorithm is its super linear convergence which makes its convergence rate independent of the complexity of finding @xmath172 . as the problems of finding @xmath172 in algorithm 2 are convex , their complexity can be modeled in polynomial form in terms of the number of variables and constraints @xcite .",
    "assuming @xmath173 , the complexity of step 1 and 2 of algorithm 2 are @xmath174 and @xmath175 , respectively .",
    "also , the computational complexity of step 3 is obtained as @xmath176 .",
    "thus , the total complexity of one iteration of algorithm 2 is @xmath177 , where @xmath178 and @xmath179 are the required number of iterations for step 1 and step 2 , respectively .",
    "this section represents an ee maximization based precoding design for swipt in a mimo twrn with @xmath180 .",
    "the same noise power is assumed at the transceivers and the relay node as @xmath181 and @xmath182 .",
    "the total circuit power is set to be @xmath183 .",
    "we adopt the block fading channels modeled as complex gaussian zero - mean unit - variance random variables .",
    "all the numerical results have been averaged over 1000 independent realizations of block fading channels .",
    "we compare the results of the proposed algorithm with the no eh constraint and the no relay beamforming schemes . in the no eh scheme",
    ", we design a precoder at the relay node as well as two transceivers while the first transceiver does not have battery limitation .",
    "therefore , all the received power at this node is utilized for the information decoding process . in the no relay beamforming scheme ,",
