    "an holographic model of some of the key phenomenological attributes of superconductivity in 2 + 1 dimensions was proposed in ref.@xcite .",
    "it works roughly as follows ( a more detailed review will follow in the next section ) .",
    "the dual is a simple model of gravity in four dimensions ( with negative cosmological constant ) coupled to a @xmath1 gauge field and a minimally coupled charged complex scalar @xmath2 .",
    "asymptotic values of the scalar on the boundary correspond to the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of a charged operator in the 2 + 1 dimensional theory . for high temperatures ( relative to a scale set by non ",
    "zero charge density in the model ) the system is in a normal phase represented by a charged black hole solution in the gravitational dual with the scalar set to zero . at a critical temperature",
    "the system undergoes a phase transition , the @xmath1 getting spontaneously broken by a non  zero vev of the charged operator that is broken is global on the boundary , but it can be gauged in a number of ways without affecting the conclusions . see _",
    "e.g. _ ref.@xcite .",
    "note that a global @xmath1 does not restrict us to a spatially independent magnetic field . ] .",
    "the gravitational description of this is a charged black hole with a non  trivial scalar profile that gives the vev on the boundary .",
    "this means that the black hole has `` scalar hair '' in this regime .",
    "( for a discussion of violations of no  hair theorems in this context , see ref.@xcite .",
    "there , it was shown that it is possible in this context , for large enough charges , equivalent to the low temperature regime here . )",
    "the authors of ref.@xcite showed using linear response theory that the dc conductivity of this new phase diverges in a manner consistent with the expectation that the system is in a superconducting phase .",
    "the authors carried out further study of the system in ref.@xcite .",
    "our focus in this paper is the system in an external magnetic field , continuing the work we began in ref.@xcite .",
    "generically , for non  zero magnetic field @xmath3 filling the two spatial dimensions , it is inconsistent to have non  trivial spatially independent solutions on the boundary , and we present and study two classes of localized solutions in some detail .",
    "the first is a `` droplet '' solution , the prototype of which was found in our earlier work@xcite as a strip in 2d ( straightforwardly generalized to circular symmetry in ref.@xcite ) , and the second is a vortex solution , with integer winding number @xmath4 , which is entirely new .",
    "we obtain these as full solutions of the maxwell  scalar sector in a limit , and determine a number of their properties .",
    "our analysis in various connected limits shows where these solutions can exist in the @xmath5 plane .",
    "there is a critical line below which droplets are not found , while vortices can be found there .",
    "our interpretation is that this region is the superconducting phase , and that for non ",
    "zero @xmath3 , the vortices develop , trapping the magnetic flux into filaments , as is familiar in type  ii superconductors . above the critical line , the system leaves the superconducting phase , and either forms droplets of condensate or simply reverts to the normal phase ( dual to a dyonic black hole with zero scalar everywhere , which may well yield lower action than the droplets if we had back  reacting solutions to work with ) . in section  2 we review the model , and discuss the two limits in which most of our studies will be carried out .",
    "section  3 reviews the spatially independent solution corresponding to the prototype superconducting solution .",
    "we briefly discuss our numerical approach to finding the solution as a warmup for the more difficult problems in the sequel .",
    "section  4 presents our search for and construction of the non  trivial spatially dependent solutions corresponding to condensate droplets and to vortices .",
    "we discuss the numerical methods we used to find them , and then examine a number of their properties .",
    "section  5 examines aspects of the solutions stability .",
    "we conclude in section  6 , and we also present two appendices .",
    "one appendix establishes the normalisation of our gauge / gravity dual dictionary , while the other discusses the flux quantization in our vortices .",
    "the holographic model of superconductivity in 2 + 1 dimensions proposed in ref.@xcite is a model of gravity in four dimensions coupled to a @xmath1 gauge field and a minimally coupled charged complex scalar @xmath2 with potential @xmath6 .",
    "there is a negative cosmological constant that defines a scale @xmath7 _ via _ @xmath8 .",
    "the action is : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the gravitational coupling and our signature is @xmath11 .",
    "we will use coordinates @xmath12 for much of our discussion , with @xmath13 time , @xmath14 forming a plane , and @xmath15 a `` radial '' coordinate for our asymptotically ads@xmath16 spacetimes such that @xmath17 is the boundary at infinity .",

    "we will write the scalar as : @xmath21 near the boundary @xmath17 we have : @xmath22 where @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) sets the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of an operator @xmath25 with dimension @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "only one of these vevs can be non  zero at a time , and we will choose to study the case of @xmath27 , for much of the paper .",
    "our charged operator will be the order parameter for the spontaneous breaking of the @xmath1 symmetry .",
    "a gauge field of the form @xmath28 does not give an electric field in the dual theory on @xmath14 , but defines instead@xcite a @xmath1 charge density , @xmath29 and its conjugate chemical potential @xmath30 , as we will recall below .",
    "black holes in this study will be planar , _",
    "i.e. , _ their horizons are an @xmath14 plane at some finite @xmath31 . in the familiar manner , their hawking temperature @xmath32 and mass per unit horizon area @xmath33 , corresponds to the dual 2 + 1 dimensional system at temperature @xmath32 and with energy density  @xmath34 .",
    "generically , the black hole will couple to the gauge sector , having some profile for the field @xmath35 .",
    "the temperature @xmath32 will have dependence on the charge density parameter  @xmath29 .",
    "this is quite natural since without the charge density there is no other scale in the theory , and there would be no meaning to a high or low temperature phase , and hence no possibility of a phase transition .",
    "the high @xmath32 phase of the theory is simply the charged black hole ( reissner  nordstrm ( ads  rn ) ) with the scalar @xmath2 vanishing .",
    "this corresponds to the non  superconducting or `` normal '' phase of the theory , where the order parameter vanishes .",
    "the mass of the scalar @xmath2 is set not just by @xmath36 but by the density @xmath29 through the coupling to the gauge field .",
    "in fact @xmath37 decreases with @xmath32 until at  @xmath38 it goes below @xmath39 , becoming tachyonic .",
    "the theory seeks a new solution , in which the black hole is no longer ads  rn , but one that has a non  trivial profile for  @xmath2 .    in studying the system in a magnetic field background ,",
    "there are some generic expectations to consider .",
    "the magnetic field @xmath3 ( which fills the two dimensions of the superconducting theory ) , also contributes to @xmath40 , _ via _ its square , but contributes with _ opposite sign _ to the electric contribution of the background .",
    "it therefore lowers the temperature @xmath38 at which @xmath37 falls below @xmath41 , triggering the phase transition . on these grounds alone",
    "one then ( naively ) expects a critical line in the @xmath5 plane connecting @xmath42 to some @xmath43 , but it is important to determine exactly what physics lies on either side of the line .",
    "our solutions and our study of their properties help in establishing some of this .",
    "the solutions can be found by solving equations of motion in certain limits and we remind the reader of them in the next two subsections .      after a field redefinition : @xmath44 our action  ( [ eqt : em_action ] ) becomes : @xmath45 if we consider the limit @xmath46 , then the maxwell  scalar sector decouples from gravity .",
    "this allows us to work with a fixed uncharged background , which we take to be the ads@xmath16schwarzschild ( ads  sch ) black hole , given by : @xmath47 where @xmath48 .",
    "the coordinate @xmath15 is a dimensionless parameter scaled such that the event horizon is at @xmath49 .",
    "the hawking temperature is given by the usual gibbons  hawking calculus @xcite : @xmath50 note that @xmath51 is related to the mass of the black hole : @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the volume of the @xmath14 plane .",

    "see text for discussion.,width=240 ]    we can also check whether the phase diagrams coincide .",
    "this is presented in figure [ fig : pd_unite ]",
    ".     case .",
    "@xmath166.,width=268 ]    as we see , the dyonic black hole results very quickly approach our results for the @xmath46 case for a range of @xmath141 near one .",
    "we are now in a position to answer what happens when @xmath145 for the @xmath46 limit .",
    "the zero temperature limit requires us to take : @xmath167 as @xmath46 , we find that regularity of any solution at zero temperature requires us to take : @xmath168 therefore , the gaussian profile in equation ( [ eqt : dyonic_gaussian ] ) vanishes in the limit of zero temperature and @xmath46 ( note that this does not happen at finite @xmath64 ) .",
    "therefore , the droplet no longer exists in that limit . another way to see",
    "this is that in this limit , the dimensionless quantity @xmath169 as used in figure [ fig : pd_unite ] diverges .",
    "we now consider solutions for the scalar that asymptote to a constant non ",
    "zero value .",
    "these are the vortex solutions .",
    "the numerical procedure for the vortex is almost identical to that of the droplet ( see section [ sec : np ] ) .",
    "we found it much more difficult to solve for the initial functions on the horizon using a shooting method , and so we inserted an initial guess function for an approximation to the scalar field @xmath170 at the event horizon , parameteriszed by two constants @xmath171 and @xmath172 .",
    "we then use that function to solve for the field @xmath173 , however it turns that for a given @xmath130 and @xmath171 , there is a specific @xmath172 that leads to a regular solution ; we again use a shooting method to determine this constant .",
    "the constant @xmath131 is determined in the same way . with both @xmath174 and @xmath173 determined ,",
    "we have fully fixed @xmath175 .",
    "the bulk shooting problem is tackled as before .",
    "note that the leading term in the expansion of @xmath176 is the constant already determined in the spatially independent problem using equations  ( [ eq : conditions ] ) , since our vortices asymptote to that case .",
    "here , we illustrate the case of @xmath177 and @xmath178 and again use @xmath124 as our order parameter .",
    "we again consider the equations of motion given in equations ( [ eqt : eom_xi ] ) and ( [ eqt : eom_horizon_xi ] ) . for simplicity ,",
    "we focus on the case of @xmath179 .",
    "we note that as the solutions approach a constant value , they should asymptote to the spatially  independent solutions we have presented earlier .",
    "this in turn allows us to define the temperature at which a given solution exists .",
    "we present examples of such solutions in figures [ fig : vortex_solution1 ] and [ fig : vortex_solution2 ] .    in figure",
    "[ fig : vortex_solution1 ] , we see that very far away from the origin , the scalar field has a constant vev , but as it approaches the core of the vortex , it decreases to zero value .",
    "the behavior at the origin is of course determined by the choice of @xmath103 .",
    "the choice of @xmath103 also influences how the gauge field @xmath101 behaves . in figures [ fig : vortex_linear_aphi ] and [ fig :",
    "vortex_quad_aphi ] , we see that the value of @xmath101 asymptotes to the value of @xmath103 .",
    "this is exactly the behavior required for the magnetic flux penetrating the vortex to be quantized with value @xmath180 .",
    "we review this briefly in appendix  [ sec : flux_quantization ] .",
    "indeed , @xmath103 defines a non  trivial topological winding number : the scalar @xmath56 becomes constant at infinity , breaking the @xmath1 .",
    "therefore the gauge symmetry of equation  ( [ eq : gauge ] ) can not be used to unwind @xmath57 .",
    "gauge symmetry is unbroken at infinity for the droplets , so @xmath103 is not a winding number for them .",
    "the current density @xmath181 ( figures [ fig : vortex_linear_current ] and [ fig : vortex_quad_current ] ) is zero asymptotically and peaks in a ring around the core , supporting the magnetic field , as expected for a vortex .    in figure",
    "[ fig : vortex_quad_charge ] , we find that the charge density near the origin begins to oscillate as the density drifts downwards .",
    "it is difficult to say whether or not this is a physical attribute of the solutions or whether it is an artifact of our scheme to find the appropriate shooting functions that satisfy the @xmath17 boundary condition .",
    "if they are physical , they may be caused by screening effects being strong in the core of the vortex .",
    "it is interesting to note that this behavior appears to be absent for the @xmath182 vortex ( see figure [ fig : vortex_linear_charge ] ) , although we do see that there is a transition from the charge density increasing in the core to decreasing in the core as the temperature is lowered .",
    "another curiosity for the @xmath182 vortex is the behavior of the magnetic field near the origin ( see figure [ fig : vortex_linear_magnetic ] . instead of flattening out as is the case for the @xmath183 solutions , it dips slightly downwards .",
    "we expect this also to be a numerical artifact , since the @xmath182 case is more numerically sensitive because of its sharper profile near @xmath112 .",
    "in this section we consider the stability of our solutions to fluctuations in the fields .",
    "we work in the decoupling limit and proceed by considering fluctuations about our classical solutions : @xmath184 where the fields with superscripts  @xmath185 are the background fields and the fields with superscipts  @xmath186 are the fluctuation fields .",
    "note in particular that because we are working in the @xmath46 limit , we do not consider fluctuations of the metric since those come at @xmath187 .",
    "the action to quadratic order in the fluctuations is given by : @xmath188 \\right .",
    "\\nonumber \\\\ & & \\left .",
    "+ \\frac{1}{l^2 } \\left(\\tilde{\\rho}^{(1)}\\right)^2 - \\frac{l^2}{4 } f^{(1)}_{\\mu \\nu } f^{\\mu \\nu}_{(1 ) } \\right ) \\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the resulting equations of motion are given by : @xmath189      we can consider the ansatz : @xmath190 the equation of motion for the fluctuation field is given by : @xmath191 near the event horizon , the field satisfies an equation of the form : @xmath192 this has solutions given by ingoing ( negative ) and outgoing ( positive ) waves : @xmath193 the appropriate condition to have at the event horizon is of ingoing waves , and therefore , we make the following field redefinition : @xmath194 the equation of motion is now given by : @xmath195 expanding near the event horizon , we get the following restrictions on the initial conditions : @xmath196_{z=1 } \\ .\\ ] ] by requiring that @xmath197 , we find that this condition is only satisfied for discrete values of @xmath198 .",
    "we present some of the values in table [ table : complex_omega1 ] .",
    "in particular , since the imaginary part of @xmath198 is negative , this corresponds to having fluctuations that decay away .",
    "therefore , the constant solutions are stable under fluctuations",
    ".    .values of @xmath198 that give regularizable solutions at @xmath199 . [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     using these values , we try to find normalizable solutions for the droplet scalar field solutions",
    ". what is interesting is that we can only find solutions for @xmath200 ( note that this does not mean that solutions for smaller @xmath201 do not exist , just that our extensive numerical search could not find them ) .",
    "we present an example of this solution in figure [ fig : fluctuations ] .",
    "therefore , these results suggest ( note that this result is not conclusive since we have not solved for the field @xmath202 ) that the droplet solutions are stable under quadratic fluctuations .",
    "the situation for the vortex solutions is very similar , except that now , the @xmath198 values we use are those of the spatially independent solutions described earlier . once again , we find that solutions can be easily found above the lower lying modes , although we find them to be much higher above as illustrated by the example shown in figure [ fig : vortex_fluctuation ] .",
    "we have constructed two broad families of localized solution to the equations of motion for ref.@xcite s holographic model of a superconductor , and considered several of their key properties .",
    "the vortices , with winding number @xmath103 , contain @xmath203 units of magnetic flux , and are candidates to fill out the superconducting part of the phase diagram in the presence of an external magnetic field .",
    "this is because a lattice of them in the @xmath14 plane can trap flux lines of an applied external @xmath3field into filaments as it passes through the two dimensional sample .",
    "vortices presumably repel each other , and so such a lattice will cost energy .",
    "therefore at some critical @xmath204 the system will seek a lower energy phase , possibly returning to the normal phase .",
    "we have not constructed such a lattice , and further study to understand such a configuration is a very interesting avenue of research to pursue .",
    "forming such a lattice is a method by which , at a given @xmath205 , the superconducting phase can be made to persist in some constant background @xmath3 , even though the system can not eject the magnetic field entirely _  la _ the meissner effect ( there is a nice energetic argument in ref.@xcite as to why the meissner effect is not possible in this two dimensional case ) .",
    "this vortex phase is of course the same method by which a standard type  ii superconductor can persist beyond the ( lower ) critical line at which the meissner effect disappears , and we expect that it applies here .",
    "the study of multi  vortex solutions needed to establish this is left for further study .",
    "crucially , we ve established that the droplets do not exist below a certain critical value of @xmath3 , dropping to zero height on a family of lines that we were able to compute explicitly . for this and a variety of other stated reasons , and",
    "also considering the fact that they are of finite size and hence a lattice or gas of them would not give a connected superconducting path for charge transport , we believe that they do not represent a superconducting phase .",
    "( hence , we disagree with the statements made about the phase diagram in ref.@xcite .",
    "the authors find the critical line , but state ( similarly to our ref.@xcite ) that the droplets exist _ below _ the line , and are superconducting . as they did not have the full droplet solutions , nor the vortex solutions , their analyses are not sufficient to make these determinations .",
    "they seem to represent a non  superconducting phase that is inhomogeneous .",
    "whether or not the droplets are the favoured solution for arbitrarily large @xmath3 is an interesting question .",
    "there is the possibility that the system may prefer to return to the normal phase represented by a dyonic black hole with zero scalar .",
    "our partial stability analysis showed that the droplets we studied are stable against fluctuations of the fields , but there is the possibility that other fluctuation modes may be undamped .",
    "we mention here that we also noticed the curious fact that the droplet solution at higher magnetic field ( that we presented earlier ) contains regions where the local value of the squared scalar mass is below the breitenlohner ",
    "freedman bound .",
    "it would also be of interest to establish whether the critical line where the vortex phase would disappear coincides with the limiting line where the droplets existence begins .",
    "we conjecture this to be likely on the grounds that we have found no other candidate solutions to fill an intermediate region .",
    "while this is the simplest possibility , further study is needed to establish it firmly .",
    "we would like to thank arnab kundu and rob myers for conversations .",
    "cvj thanks the aspen center for physics for a stimulating working atmosphere while this manuscript was prepared .",
    "we recall the ads dictionary ( working in euclidean metric ) : @xmath206   \\right ) = \\mathcal{z } \\ .\\ ] ] taking derivatives on both sides with respect to the boundary source @xmath207 gives us our ads dictionary : @xmath208 we define the the free energy density of the dual theory to be given : @xmath209 where @xmath210 is the inverse temperature and @xmath53 is the `` spatial volume '' of the dual theory .",
    "if we use the notation that we are working in ads@xmath211 , then @xmath53 has mass dimension @xmath212 . for us ,",
    "@xmath213 . in the euclidean language ,",
    "our action is given by : @xmath214 where we emphasize that although the metric is now purely positive , we are still using @xmath35 and now a wick rotated version of it . in the dual theory , the charge density is given by : @xmath215 where @xmath30 is the chemical potential and @xmath216 represents the space  time coordinates in the dual field theory . using the ads / cft dictionary , we can write : @xmath217 using the action given in equation ( [ eqt : action ] ) , we find : @xmath218 where we have used that : @xmath219 and we have dropped the contribution coming from the event horizon . therefore , the end result is given by : @xmath220 a similar procedure allows us to calculate the vev of the azimuthal current as well : @xmath221 note that here we are using the vector field that has been rescaled by @xmath64 , hence why the factor of @xmath64 appears at the beginning of our definition .",
    "next , we can calculate the form of the vevs of the @xmath83 and @xmath84 operators .",
    "to proceed , we take the @xmath83 operator to be the source of the @xmath222 operator @xcite .",
    "therefore , we write : @xmath223 where we are using the notation that : @xmath224 to proceed , we calculate the variation of the bulk action ( keeping only divergent and finite terms ) : @xmath225 the first term in parentheses is divergent , but it is removed by an appropriate counterterm : @xmath226 which leaves us with : @xmath227 therefore , we find : @xmath228 to calculate the vev of the @xmath83 operator , we need to perform a legendre transform on @xmath229 @xcite : @xmath230 and we now have : @xmath231 therefore , in order to satisfy the conditions : @xmath232 we choose : @xmath233",
    "let us review the flux quantization condition .",
    "deep in the superconductor , away from the vortex , our results indicate that we have @xmath234 .",
    "this can be written as : @xmath235 it is useful at this point to realize that @xmath236 transforms exactly as the vector @xmath237 .",
    "therefore , it is convenient to write equation ( [ eqt : sc_cond ] ) as : @xmath238 consider drawing a circle around the vortex , deep in the superconductor . we can choose to integrate equation ( [ eqt : sc_cond ] ) along the circle : @xmath239 where @xmath60 is the corresponding 1form .",
    "the left hand side gives @xmath240 , and using stokes theorem on the rhs , we have : @xmath241 note that the quantity in brackets on the right is exactly the magnetic field , so we find that the flux of a single vortex is quantized to @xmath180 .",
