    "the statistical properties of the temperature anisotropies of cmb radiation and of the large - scale structure of the universe offer a powerful probe of the physics of the early universe  @xcite .",
    "thus , for example , although a convincing detection of a significant level of primordial non - gaussianity of local type ( @xmath1 ) in cmb data would not rule out all inflationary models , it would exclude the entire class of single scalar field models regardless of the form of kinetic term , potential , or initial vacuum state  @xcite .",
    "such a detection , however , would be consistent with some alternative models of the physics of the early universe , and also with other nonstandard inflationary scenarios . on the other hand , a convincing null detection of primordial non - gaussianity of local type ( @xmath2 ) would rule out the current alternative models of the primordial universe ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "thus , a detection or null detection of primordial non - gaussianity of local type in the cmb data is crucial not only to discriminate or even exclude classes of inflationary models , but also to test alternative scenarios , offering therefore an important window into the physics of the early universe .    however , there are various effects that can produce non - gaussianity . among them ,",
    "the most significant are possibly unsubtracted diffuse foreground emission @xcite , unresolved point sources  @xcite , possible systematic errors  @xcite , and secondary anisotropies such as gravitational weak lensing and the sunyaev - zeldovich effect ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) . in this way ,",
    "the accurate extraction of a possible primordial non - gaussianity is a challenging observational and statistical enterprise .    in the search for non - gaussianity in cmb data , different statistical tools can , in principle , provide information about distinct forms of non - gaussianity . on the other hand",
    ", one does not expect that a single statistical estimator can be sensitive to all possible forms of non - gaussianity that may be present in cmb data .",
    "it is therefore important to test cmb data for deviations from gaussianity by using different statistical tools in order to quantify or constrain the amount of any non - gaussian signals in the data , and extract information on their possible origins .",
    "this has motivated a great deal of effort that has recently gone into the search for non - gaussianity in cmb maps by employing several statistical estimators ( an incomplete list of references is given the recent reviews  @xcite , and also in refs .",
    "@xcite ) in recent papers  @xcite we have proposed two new large - angle non - gaussianity estimators , which are based upon the skewness and kurtosis of the patches ( spherical caps ) of the cmb sky sphere . by scanning the cmb sphere with",
    "evenly distributed spherical caps , and calculating the skewness @xmath3 and kurtosis @xmath4 for each cap , one can have measures of the departure from gaussianity on large angular scales . using this procedure",
    "we have carried out analyses of large - angle deviation from gaussianity in both band and foreground - reduced maps with and without the _ kq75 _ mask recommended by the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) team for gaussianity studies of cmb data  @xcite .",
    "thus , we have found , for example , significant departure from gaussianity in all full - sky band maps , while for the q , v , w maps with the _ kq75 _ mask , the cmb data are consistent with gaussianity .",
    "the k and ka maps , however , show an important deviation from gaussianity even with a _",
    "kq75 _ mask . for the full - sky foreground - reduced  @xcite",
    "we have found a significant deviation from gaussianity which varies with the cleaning processes , as measured by our indicators  @xcite .",
    "simulated cmb maps equipped with assigned primordial non - gaussianity are essential tools to test the sensitivity and effectiveness of non - gaussian indicators .",
    "they can also be used to study , e.g. , the effects of foregrounds and other non - gaussian contaminants , and also to disclose potential systematics . in a recent paper a new algorithm for generating non - gaussian cmb temperature maps with non - gaussianity of the local type has been devised  @xcite . in the simulated maps",
    "the level of non - gaussianity is adjusted by the dimensionless parameter @xmath0 .",
    "a set of @xmath5 cmb temperature simulated maps with the resolution of planck mission  @xcite for open ( unfixed ) values of @xmath0 was made available  @xcite .",
    "a pertinent question that arises is whether the indicators proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , and used in refs .",
    "@xcite to detect non - gaussianity in cmb data , have sufficient sensitivity to detect deviation from non - gaussianity of local type with an amplitude @xmath0 within the bounds determined by the wmap team in their latest data release  @xcite .",
    "our primary aim in this paper is to address this question by extending the results , and by complementing the analyses of refs .",
    "@xcite in three different ways .",
    "first , instead of using cmb data , we use our statistical indicators to carry out an analysis of gaussianity of _ simulated _ maps equipped with non - gaussianity of local type .",
    "second , by using simulated maps with different amplitudes @xmath0 , we make a quantitative analysis of the degree of sensitivity of our skewness and kurtosis indicators to detect primordial non - gaussianity of local type .",
    "third , we make a comparative study of the degrees of non - gaussianity of simulated maps with different @xmath0 s and the full - sky foreground - reduced 7 yr wmap internal linear combination ( ilc-7 yr ) map  @xcite .",
    "an interesting outcome of this comparative analysis is that the level of non - gaussianity of the ilc-7 yr is considerably higher than that of the simulated maps for @xmath0 within observational bounds  @xcite .",
    "this renders information about the suitability of the ilc-7 yr foreground - reduced map as gaussian reconstruction of the cmb full - sky .",
    "the first important ingredient in the study of non - gaussianity is the primordial gravitational curvature perturbations @xmath6 , which were seeded by quantum fluctuations in the very early universe . in the linear order ,",
    "the primordial curvature perturbation is related to bardeen s curvature perturbation @xmath7  @xcite in the matter dominated era by @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "the relation with cmb observations is given in the sachs - wolfe limit , where @xmath9 holds  @xcite .",
    "the lower order statistics able to distinguish non - gaussian from gaussian distributions is the three - point correlation function .",
    "primordial non - gaussianity can then be described in terms of the three - point correlation function of the curvature perturbations @xmath10 or of its fourier transform @xmath11 by using the ensemble average .",
    "thus , the three - point correlation function counterpart in fourier space the so - called bispectrum takes the form @xmath12 where @xmath13 enforces that the wavevectors in fourier space have to close to form a triangle , i.e. , @xmath14 .",
    "thus , the bispectrum is a function of the triplet defined by the magnitude of the wave numbers @xmath15 .    in the examination of primordial non - gaussianity",
    ", the bispectrum of curvature is rewritten in the form @xmath16 where @xmath17 is an overall amplitude ( dimensionless ) parameter , can be written as a nonlinear transformation of a gaussian field ( see below for more details ) . ] which can be constrained by the cmb data , and where @xmath18 is the so - called shape of the bispectrum and encodes the functional dependence of the bispectrum on the triangular configurations .",
    "the bispectrum shape is used to specify the configuration of the wave vectors of curvature perturbations that give the highest contributions to the amplitude of the bispectrum . in this way",
    ", the bispectra are usually classified according to shapes of the triangles that give rise to the highest non - gaussian signal .",
    "the most studied shapes are * ( i ) * _ local _ , where the bispectrum is maximum on the squeeze triangle configuration , @xmath19 ; * ( ii ) * _ equilateral _ , with the bispectrum maximized on the equilateral limit @xmath20 ; and * ( iii ) * _ orthogonal _ , where the bispectrum has a positive peak at the equilateral configuration and a negative valley along the flattened ( elongated ) triangular configuration @xmath21  @xcite .",
    "predictions for both the amplitude @xmath17 and the shape of @xmath22 depend on the early universe models , which makes apparent the power of the bispectrum as a tool to probe models of the primordial universe .    in this paper",
    "we shall deal with non - gaussianity of local type , which is the most studied type of deviation from gaussianity . for this type of primordial non - gaussianity the curvature perturbation in the real space",
    "can be split into two components : the linear term @xmath23 ( representing the gaussian component ) plus a non - gaussian second term , namely @xmath24 where both sides are evaluated at the same spatial location @xmath25 .",
    "finally , we recall that the latest wmap constraints reported on @xmath26 at the @xmath27 confidence level are given by @xmath28  @xcite . these bounds will be used in our analyses in one of the following sections .",
    "the first simulated cmb temperature maps endowed with primordial non - gaussianity introduced through a non - gaussian parameter @xmath29 were generated by the wmap team and reported in ref .",
    "the wmap algorithm was generalized so as to improve computational speed and accuracy , and also to include polarization maps in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also ref .",
    "more recently , elsner and wandelt  @xcite presented a new algorithm and generated @xmath5 high - angular resolution simulated non - gaussian cmb temperature and polarization maps with non - gaussianities of the local type , for which the level of non - gaussianity is determined by the parameter @xmath0 . in their algorithm a simulated map with a desired level of non - gaussianity @xmath0 is such that the spherical harmonic coefficients are given by @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are , respectively , the linear and nonlinear spherical harmonic coefficients of the simulated cmb temperature maps .    in the next sections we shall use the set of @xmath33",
    "cmb temperature simulated linear and nonlinear component maps , generated for an arbitrary ( unfixed ) value of @xmath0 , which was made available in ref .",
    "@xcite with the resolution of the planck mission  @xcite .",
    "to make our paper clear and self - contained , in this section we describe the two statistical non - gaussianity indicators and their associated maps , which can be calculated from either simulated or real cmb temperature ( input ) maps .",
    "the procedure delineated here will be used in the following sections to investigate large - angle deviation from gaussianity .    the most important underlying idea in the construction of our non - gaussianity indicators and the associated maps ,",
    "is that one can access the deviation from gaussianity of the cmb temperature fluctuations by calculating the skewness @xmath3 and the kurtosis @xmath4 , which measure , respectively , the symmetry about the mean temperature , and the non - gaussian degree of peakness of the temperature distribution .    clearly",
    "the calculation of @xmath3 and @xmath4 from the whole cmb sky sphere of temperature fluctuations data would be a crude approach to measure the complexity of the non - gaussianity of the cmb map .",
    "however , instead of having just two dimensionless numbers , one can go further by taking a discrete set of points @xmath34 homogeneously distributed on the cmb sky sphere @xmath35 as the center of _ spherical caps _ of aperture @xmath36 ( say ) , and calculate @xmath37 and @xmath38 for each cap @xmath39 of the cmb temperature sky sphere .",
    "the values @xmath37 and @xmath38 can then be taken as measures of the non - gaussianity in the direction @xmath40 of the center of the spherical cap @xmath39 .",
    "such calculations for the individual caps thus provide quantitative information ( @xmath41 values ) about non - gaussianity of the cmb data .",
    "the above procedure is a constructive way of defining on @xmath35 two discrete functions @xmath42 and @xmath43 that measure departure from gaussianity of a cmb temperature ( input ) map . in other words , these functions can be constructed from an input cmb map through the following steps  @xcite :    1 .",
    "take a discrete finite set of points @xmath44 homogeneously distributed on the sky sphere of a cmb input map as the centers of spherical caps of a chosen aperture @xmath36 ; and calculate for each cap @xmath45 the skewness and kurtosis given , respectively , by @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the temperature at the @xmath48 pixel , @xmath49 is the cmb mean temperature of the @xmath50 spherical cap , @xmath51 is the number of pixels in the cap @xmath39 , and @xmath52 is the standard deviation .",
    "+ clearly , the whole set of values @xmath37 and @xmath38 ( for all @xmath45 ) obtained through this discrete _ scanning _ calculation process , along with the angular coordinate of the center of the caps @xmath40 can be taken as measures of non - gaussianity in the directions of the center of spherical caps @xmath39 .",
    "patching together the @xmath37 and @xmath38 values for all spherical caps @xmath45 , one has two discrete functions @xmath53 and @xmath54 defined over a two - sphere @xmath35 .",
    "these functions provide measurements of the non - gaussianity as a function of @xmath55 .",
    "the mollweide projections of the functions @xmath53 and @xmath54 are nothing but skewness and kurtosis maps ( hereafter denoted by @xmath3 map and @xmath4 map ) .    clearly , the functions @xmath53 and @xmath54 can be expanded into their spherical harmonics .",
    "thus , for example , for @xmath53 one has @xmath56 and the corresponding angular power spectrum @xmath57 which can be used to quantify the amplitude ( level ) and angular scale of the deviation from gaussianity . in this paper",
    "we shall use the power spectra @xmath58 and @xmath59 to estimate the departure from gaussianity and calculate the statistical significance of such a deviation by comparison with the corresponding power spectra calculated from @xmath3 and @xmath4 maps obtained from input gaussian maps ( @xmath60 ) .    in the next section",
    "we will use these statistical indicators to carry out analyses of gaussianity of _ simulated _ maps endowed with non - gaussianity of local type of different levels to test the sensitivity of @xmath3 and @xmath4 indicators to detect primordial non - gaussianity of local type .",
    "furthermore , we will make a comparative study of the degrees of non - gaussianity of different simulated maps and the ilc-7 yr wmap map .",
    "it is clear from the previous section that in order to study the sensitivity of the non - gaussianity indicators @xmath3 and @xmath4 , that is , to construct the functions @xmath53 and @xmath54 and the associated @xmath3 and @xmath4 maps , we need cmb input maps .",
    "the input maps used in our analyses in this section are high - angular resolution - simulated cmb temperature maps endowed with non - gaussianities of the local type introduced through different values of the dimensionless amplitude parameter @xmath61 .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows two examples of such simulated cmb maps .",
    "the left panel gives a gaussian map @xmath62 , while the right panel shows a non - gaussian map for @xmath63 .",
    "we have taken these values for @xmath0 as an illustrative example that makes the non - gaussian effects visible to the naked eye through the comparison of these simulated maps .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] gives an illustration of typical skewness @xmath3 ( left panel ) and kurtosis @xmath4 ( right panel ) maps , generated from input cmb simulated maps for @xmath64 ( first row ) and @xmath60 ( second row ) .",
    "the non - gaussian maps show spots with higher and lower values of @xmath65 and @xmath66 , which suggest _ large - angle _ dominant multipole components ( low @xmath67 ) in these maps .. these maps , however , provide only qualitative information , and to avoid repetition we only depict maps of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] for illustrative purpose . ] in our calculations of all @xmath3 maps and @xmath4 maps , to minimize the statistical noise , we have scanned the cmb sphere with @xmath68 spherical caps of aperture @xmath69 , centered at points homogeneously distributed on the two - sphere . to obtain _ quantitative _ large - angle - scale information , as a first test of the sensitivity of @xmath3 and @xmath4 indicators , for each of the following values of the nonlinear parameter @xmath70 we have generated @xmath5 simulated cmb maps , totalizing @xmath71 simulated maps . from each set of @xmath5 simulated input cmb maps ( fixed @xmath61 for each set ) we have calculated @xmath5 @xmath3 maps and @xmath5 @xmath4 maps , from which we computed the associated power spectra , namely , @xmath72 and @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is an enumeration index , and @xmath75 is the range of multipoles we have focused on in this paper . for @xmath76 and @xmath77",
