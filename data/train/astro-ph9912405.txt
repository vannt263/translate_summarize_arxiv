    "two of the outstanding questions on cluster of galaxies are : what causes the density morphology relation and how dynamically relaxed are clusters . for the density morphology relation",
    "the question is : are all galaxies formed by the same process and do they evolve differently in different environments ? or does the environment play a dominant role at the time of formation ? on a larger scale",
    "the question is whether clusters at low redshift are dynamically relaxed or whether they are still accreting significant amounts of mass .",
    "the answer to this question may contain a clue to the density of the universe ( thomas et al .",
    "observations of clusters at intermediate redshift suggest that clusters evolve rapidly . already at intermediate redshifts",
    "they differ markedly from clusters at low redshifts .",
    "many clusters at redshifts larger than z@xmath40.3 are known to contain a large population of blue galaxies , indicative of enhanced star formation , which is not found in similar clusters at z @xmath9 0.1 ( butcher & oemler 1978 , 1984 ; dressler & gunn 1992 , poggianti et al .  1999 , dressler et al .",
    "secondly these clusters often contain galaxies which have recently undergone a starburst , but which are not currently forming stars , displaying spectra with strong balmer absorption lines but no emission lines at all .",
    "these galaxies are commonly referred to as `` post - starburst '' ( psb ) galaxies .",
    "we address both questions with hi  imaging studies of nearby clusters , which are directly comparable to more distant ones .",
    "detailed hi  imaging of the nearest cluster of galaxies , virgo , has shown that the neutral gas component gets affected dramatically by the hot intergalactic medium ( igm ) ( van gorkom et al .  1984 , warmels 1988 , and cayatte et al .  1990 , 1994 ) .",
    "in the center of virgo the hi  disks are much smaller than the optical disks . the actual hi  removal mechanisms at work in the center of virgo could be identified by a detailed comparison of the hi  surface density distribution of the cluster galaxies with their counterparts in the field ( cayatte et al .",
    "thus , the hi  distribution of individual galaxies reflects the effect of the cluster environment , while the location and velocities of gas - rich versus gas - poor galaxies can help identify possible substructure in the clusters ( valluri et al .",
    "gas can also be used to probe the orbital history of the galaxies .",
    "more recently other clusters have been imaged in hi  with the vla and wsrt : hydra ( mcmahon 1993 ) , ursa majoris ( verheijen 1996 ) , a  2670 ( van gorkom  1996 ) , a  262 ( bravo  alfaro et al .",
    "1997 ) , and hercules ( dickey 1997 ) .",
    "preliminary results on coma were obtained by sullivan ( 1989 ) in the early days of the vla . in spite of poor sensitivity and interference problems in the data , he observed disturbed hi  disks for a few galaxies in the center .",
    "in this paper we present a more complete and much more sensitive study of the coma cluster .",
    "we expect the environmental effects in coma to be stronger than in virgo , because coma is a much richer cluster and because its central x  ray emission is almost six times more luminous than in virgo .",
    "indeed , single dish observations have shown that coma is one of the most hi  deficient clusters ; extremely hi   deficient galaxies are seen out to 1.5  r@xmath10 ( the abell radius , r@xmath10=1.7@xmath3/z , where z is the redshift ) , while in other clusters strongly hi  deficient galaxies are generally not seen beyond 0.75  r@xmath10 ( bothun et al .  1985 ; giovanelli and haynes 1985 ; gavazzi 1987 ; 1989 ) .",
    "the coma cluster is in fact the richest of the nearby clusters ( richness class 2 , and z  =  0.023 , and h@xmath11  =  100 km  s@xmath12  mpc@xmath12 throughout this paper . ] ) , and represents the closest equivalent to what is seen at intermediate redshifts , as it has blue disk galaxies ( bothun & dressler 1986 , and references therein ) and psb galaxies ( caldwell , rose , & dendy  1999 , and references therein ) , which are commonly seen in distant clusters .",
    "this makes coma the perfect link between nearby and more distant clusters .    in the present paper",
    "we discuss the global properties of coma , on the basis of our hi  results , combined with recent observations on different wavelengths and numerical work . a detailed analysis of individual galaxies and more specific regions of coma , will be the subject of a forthcoming paper ( bravo  alfaro et al .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows : observations and data reduction are described in section 2 .",
    "observational results are given in section 3 .",
    "in section 4 we discuss what the observations have taught us about coma at large .",
    "conclusions are summarized in section 5 .",
    "a description of hi  properties of individual galaxies is given in appendix a.",
    "we selected the 25 brightest spiral galaxies in coma with morphological type later than s0 .",
    "all those galaxies have b  magnitude smaller than 15.7  mag and optical diameters larger than 0.5@xmath3 . fig .",
    "1 shows the location of the 12 fields observed with the vla , up to 1.2@xmath0 ( 1  r@xmath10 ) from the center of coma ( we take the position of ngc  4874 as the coma center ) .",
    "three fields ( 1 , 2 , and 9 ) are centered around the core , covering most of the coma velocity range .",
    "field 8 was pointed south of the elliptical ngc  4839 , which is the dominant galaxy of the sw group .",
    "five other fields ( 3 , 4 , 6 , 7 , and 10 ) contain the blue disk galaxies reported by bothun & dressler ( 1986 ) and most of the psbs reported by caldwell et al .",
    "( 1993 ) and caldwell & rose ( 1997 ) . the remaining three fields ( 5 , 11 , and 12 ) were centered in the outer regions of the cluster , where no strong environmental effects are expected , providing a comparison sample .",
    "the vla survey of coma was carried out in c and d array , during three runs , in march 1995 , april 1996 , and march 1999 . in march 1995 , an exploratory observation was done of fields 2 , 4 and 5 , in d array .",
    "twelve fields were observed in c array in april 1996 .",
    "fields 1 and 10 were reobserved , march 1999 , to get very sensitive observations of the psb galaxies in these fields . for the fields observed in both , c and d configurations ( fields 1 , 2 , 4 , 5 , and 10 )",
    ", the data were combined to improve sensitivity .",
    "the combined data provide the higher spatial resolution and a lower velocity resolution . in the d array observations of 1995",
    "online hanning smoothing was used , after which every other channel was discarded .",
    "this leaves a set of 31 independent channels with a velocity spacing of 43 km / s . in c array",
    "no online hanning smoothing was used , providing a set of 63 channels with a velocity resolution of 21.7 km / s .",
    "most of these observations were afterwards hanning smoothed to the same velocity resolution as the d array data .",
    "the c array data were tapered to an angular resolution of 30 arcsec , and , in most cases , we obtained a resolution of 35 arcsec for the combined c+d data .",
    "standard vla calibration and imaging procedures were applied , using the nrao s astronomical image processing system ( aips ) .",
    "data cubes were made using nearly pure natural weighting to obtain a higher sensitivity .",
    "a set of eight line  free channels on either side of the band was used ( four channels in the case of c+d combined data ) to define a mean continuum image .",
    "this image was then subtracted from the channel maps forming an hi  line emission cube .",
    "we used this cube to search for 21  cm line emission and to determine the spatial position and velocity range for each signal .",
    "finally , a new continuum image was made using only line ",
    "free channels .",
    "the channels containing line emission were cleaned ( for more details on data reduction see bravo  alfaro 1997 ) .",
    "the rms in the final cubes is typically 0.37 mjy / beam per channel .",
    "the observations have on average an hi  mass detection threshold of 10@xmath13 m@xmath14 , corresponding to 6@xmath1521.7 km  sec@xmath12 ( the channel width ) and a typical surface brightness sensitivity of 2 to 4@xmath710@xmath16 @xmath17 ( corresponding to 2.5  rms )",
    ". fields 1 and 10 , were reobserved in 1999 for 20 and 15 hours respectively ; there our detection thresholds are lower : the rms per channel is around 0.20  mjy / beam , and the hi  mass detection threshold is 2.4@xmath710@xmath18 m@xmath14 in the center of the field .",

    "twelve galaxies from the original observed sample ( morphological type later than s0 and m@xmath2015.7 ) were not detected ( table  4 ) .",

    "ngc  4907 and cgcg  160106 , were not detected in previous single  dish hi  surveys probably because of their low total hi  flux ( see table  3 ) .",

    "four of the galaxies detected in the present survey ( ngc  4907 , cgcg  160106 , mrk  058 , and ic  4040 ) , were not detected in the most recent survey carried out with the arecibo telescope ( haynes et al .",
    "1997 ) , either because of low hi  flux , or because several objects were found inside the beam .    in fig .",
    "3 we show a comparison between single dish and vla measurements .",
    "there is in general a good agreement , showing that the vla has not missed any extended flux .",
    "two discrepant cases are seen in fig .  3 , ngc  4848 and ic  842 .",
    "we obtained for the former , systematicly a lower total hi  flux than the values previously reported ( chincarini et al .",
    "1983 , giovanelli & haynes 1985 , gavazzi 1989 and haynes et al .",
    "we confirm the asymmetric distribution found by gavazzi ( 1989 ) but we probably miss some extended hi  emission .",
    "we obtained for ic  842 a slightly higher hi  flux ( @xmath430% ) than previous single dish observations ( chincarini et al .",
    "1983 , bothun et al .",
    "1985 , gavazzi 1989 , and haynes et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "we do not confirm two detections previously reported , mrk  056 and ngc  4944 , which were only marginally detected by gavazzi ( 1987 ) .",
    "our hi  flux upper limit for mrk  056 ( cgcg  160064 ) is well below the flux measured by gavazzi .",
    "this galaxy is very close to the detected hi  rich galaxy kug  1255 + 275 , both spatially ( 4.6@xmath3 ) and in velocity , thus this result may be due to confusion inside the arecibo beam .",
    "on the other hand , the detection of ngc  4944 is reported by gavazzi ( 1987 ) as a marginal one , and it was not confirmed in later surveys ( e.g. gavazzi 1989 ) .      to quantify the hi  content of the spirals as compared to so called field spirals we use the hi  deficiency parameter ( def@xmath1 ) , following the definition by giovanelli & haynes ( 1985 , and references therein ) ,",
    "where the deficiency parameter is the log of the ratio of the average hi  mass of isolated spirals of the same morphological type and the observed hi  mass . for our sample , we use the morphological types from dressler ( 1980 ) , or from huchra et al .",
    "( 1990 ) when the first is not available .",
    "we should remark that the hi  deficiencies in coma are less well defined than for more nearby clusters due to considerable uncertainty in the morphological classification .    a diagram of the hi  deficiency versus projected distance to the cluster center is shown in fig .  4 , where all detected galaxies are shown with black circles and lower limits for non detections ( only galaxies from table  4",
    "are included in this figure ) with triangles .",
    "the merging system ngc  4922 is not plotted in this figure because of its peculiarity ( see appendix a ) . clearly the most hi  deficient galaxies are closer to the cluster core .",
    "all strongly hi  deficient detected galaxies ( def@xmath20.4 ) are inside a projected radius of 30@xmath3  ( 0.4r@xmath10 ) from the center of coma . for the non detected galaxies",
    "the trend of deficiency with the projected distance to the center is not as clear as it is for the detected ones , but 7 of the non - detections are projected inside or very close to the x  ray emission ( ugc  8071 , ngc  4851 , ic  3943 , ngc  4858 , ic  3955 , kug  1258 + 277 , and cgcg  160261 ) , as shown in fig .",
    "5 .    for the non detected galaxies we used 6 times the r.m.s . multiplied by the velocity channel width to calculate both , the deficiency and the hi  mass upper limit shown in table  4 .",
    "this value is estimated on the basis of our detection threshold .",
    "another method to estimate the hi  mass upper limit for non detected galaxies could consider the expected velocity width for a big spiral , e.g. 300  km  s@xmath12 , rather than the observed channel width .",
    "in this fashion the total flux upper limit would be obtained as r.m.s.@xmath72.5@xmath7300  km  s@xmath12 .",
    "but as these galaxies are not in a typical environment we do not know at all what the hi  velocity width could be after a stripping process .",
    "using this different limit does not substantially change the plot in fig .",
    "although a possible correlation with distance to cluster center can be considerably weakened by projection effects ( chamaraux et al .",
    "1980 ) , the fact that the most deficient galaxies are almost all situated within the central and southwestern x  ray emission suggests that an interaction with the igm is at work .",
    "more convincing evidence for this can be obtained by looking at the relative sizes of the hi  disks .",
    "no other mechanism would cause the hi  disks to be smaller than the optical ones .",
    "we will address these issues in a following paper .",
    "5 shows the position of the detections with crosses , and the 12 non detected galaxies with triangles .",
    "we consider here as non detections those galaxies brighter than a magnitude of 15.7 , with morphological type later than s0 ( table  4 ) .",
    "we also show in fig .  5 the contours of the x  ray emission ( rosat ) centered on coma , as reported by vikhlinin et al .",
    "the central region of coma contains most of the strongly hi  deficient galaxies in the cluster , including the very bright early spirals ngc  4911 , ngc  4921 , and ngc  4907 , all of them very hi  deficient .",
    "the giant spiral ngc  4911 , detected in x - ray , is thought to be the dominant galaxy of a group crossing the main coma body .",
    "ngc  4921 ( classified as `` anemic '' by van den bergh , 1976 ) and ngc",
    "4907 show very perturbed hi  maps ; they have large velocities relative to the mean cluster velocity ( 1179 and 1521  km  s@xmath12  respectively ) .",
    "four other galaxies were detected inside a radius of 30@xmath3  ( @xmath40.60 mpc ) which is roughly the area defined by the x  ray emission shown in fig .",
    "5 . with no exception",
    "these galaxies show deeply perturbed hi  distributions , some of them smaller than the corresponding optical disks ( see fig .  2 ) .",
    "the presence of a group in the sw of coma , associated with the giant elliptical galaxy ngc  4839 , has been well established through optical and x  ray studies ( e.g. briel et al .",
    "1992 , white et al .",
    "1993 , colles & dunn 1996 , biviano et al .  1996 ) .",
    "the group sits 40@xmath3  sw of the cluster core , and coincides with the second most intense x ",
    "this group represents 6% of the total x  ray emission , and contains about 10% of the mass of the cluster .",
    "the question whether this group is falling into the center of coma ( colles & dunn 1996 ) , or has already passed following a straight path ( burns et al .",
    "1994 ) , is still a matter of debate .",
    "recently , caldwell & rose ( 1997 ) concluded that the sw group has already passed through the main body of coma , based on the velocity structure of the group and the presence of psb galaxies in that zone .",
    "our field number 8 , which includes ngc  4839 , and field number 10 in the zone between this galaxy and the cluster center , try to clarify this controversy .    of the 18 galaxies surrounding ngc  4839 and belonging to the group ( biviano 1998 ) ,",
    "four were observed and none were detected .",
    "this is perhaps not too surprising since all of them are classified as s0 .",
    "we did however detect three late type galaxies just south of the ngc  4839 group ( ic  3913 , kug  1255 + 275 and mrk  057 ) , just outside the x  ray emission ( figs .  [ fig2 ] and  [ fig5 ] ) .",
    "their radial velocities are close to the systemic velocity of the group ( 7339@xmath21329  km  s@xmath12 , colless & dunn 1996 ) , thus they are likely to be group members .",
    "these galaxies have undisturbed morphologies and a normal hi  content , which makes it extremely unlikely that they have crossed the cluster core .",
    "our hi  results are inconclusive .",
    "the non detections in the close vicinity of ngc  4839 , and the presence of several sb and psb galaxies in that zone with a very low hi  content ( see sect .",
    "3.4.2 and table  5 ) , support the hypothesis that the group has gone through .",
    "the 3 gas rich galaxies pose a problem .",
    "if they are members of the group , the group can not have passed through the main cluster .",
    "alternatively they may be new members of the group , only recently accreted after the group has gone through the cluster center .",
    "as mentioned before coma contains blue disk and post  starburst galaxies , similar to those seen at intermediate redshifts .",
    "bothun & dressler ( 1986 ) obtained spectroscopy for seven blue galaxies in coma , and showed that they had not only experienced a star burst , but were still forming stars at a high rate . considering various mechanisms to produce the starburst phenomena these authors conclude with a mild preference for ram pressure induced star formation .",
    "the main reason for rejecting galaxy  galaxy induced star formation is that the blue disks do not appear to be interacting ( except the non detected ngc  4858 , possibly interacting with ngc  4860 and member of an _ aggregate _ , conselice and gallagher 1998 ) .",
    "all seven blue disk galaxies were observed in this survey and six of them were detected : ngc  4848 , mrk  058 , cgcg  160086 , ic  4040 , cgcg  160098 and ngc  4926-a .",
    "the first four are projected inside the x  ray emission ( fig .",
    "6 ) and are hi  deficient ( def@xmath1@xmath2 0.5 ) .",
    "they display very perturbed hi  distributions .",
    "the hi  deficiencies and gas distribution strongly suggest that these galaxies are being ram pressure swept by the igm .",
    "the locations of the hi  detected blue disk galaxies are indicated with crosses in fig .  6 .",
    "most of them are in an annular region between 20@xmath3  and 30@xmath3  from the cluster center , which coincides with the outermost contour of the x  ray emission ( corresponding to a gas density of @xmath43@xmath710@xmath22  @xmath23 ) .",
    "this is similar to what has been seen in butcher  oemler clusters , where blue galaxies seem preferentially located in an annular region outside the cluster core ( e.g. butcher and oemler 1984 ; mellier et al .",
    "dressler & gunn ( 1990 ) reported that star forming galaxies seem to avoid the cluster core , appearing first at a radius of @xmath40.5 mpc ( 0.5 mpc=25@xmath3  in coma ) . furthermore , the uv survey of coma by donas et al .",
    "( 1995 ) revealed that 38% of the uv flux is produced in a ring lying between 20@xmath3  and 30@xmath3  of the cluster center .",
    "this suggests that this effect must be related to the global properties of the cluster , perhaps igm induced star formation can best explain the shell of blue starburst seen in coma and similarly in high redshift clusters ( oemler 1992 ) .",
    "we also show in fig .  6 , with triangles , the non - detected blue disk galaxy ( ngc  4858 ) and three starburst like objects reported by caldwell et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , which were also not detected in this survey ( table  5 ) .",
    "the blue disk is projected well inside the x  ray emission and star formation followed by ram pressure stripping may have exhausted their hi  reservoir .",
    "the other three galaxies show abnormal spectra with strong emission lines ( caldwell et al .",
    "these objects are also near the edge of x  ray emission , in the sw direction .",
    "their non detection suggests that in this zone , between the center and the sw group , the gas is more easily removed . note that starbursting galaxies in other directions ( e.g. ngc  4848 , ic  4040 , and cgcg  160086 ) , at similar distances from the center ,",
    "are detected in hi .",
    "caldwell et al .  ( 1993 ) and caldwell & rose ( 1997 ) reported a total of 22 abnormal spectrum galaxies in coma .",

    "the position of those galaxies are shown in fig .  6 with dotted circles .",
    "the x - ray contours ( vikhlinin et al .  1997 ) are also drawn .",
    "the ngc  4839 group has an average velocity close to the peak in the psbs velocity distribution ( biviano et al .",
    "this suggests that the psbs could be part of the group and they have been stripped of their gas when they passed through the coma core .",
    "the few psbs in the center and ne of coma could be old members of the sw group , previously pulled out from the group when it passed through the cluster center ( caldwell et al .",
    "1993 ) .",
    "our results suggest an evolutionary sequence , where galaxies first become blue because of igm induced star formation .",
    "star formation and further ram pressure stripping makes them hi  deficient .",
    "the displaced and shrunken hi  disks of the blue disk galaxies indicate that some interaction with the igm is indeed going on .",
    "the next step in this evolutionary sequence is the psb phase , where galaxies have lost most of the hi  gas , and as consequence , star formation stops on a relatively short time scale . in this picture",
    "all the psbs would be in an advanced stage of gas stripping .",
    "although gas is needed for star formation it is not obvious that only the atomic gas content is related to star formation activity ( donas et al .",
    "molecular clouds are denser and more centrally located in the galaxies , making it less likely that this component will be affected by the cluster environment . for example kenney &",
    "young 1989 ( and references therein ) showed in virgo , and casoli et al .",
    "( 1991 ) in the coma supercluster , that there is no evidence for a lower molecular content than in the field , even for the hi  deficient galaxies .",
    "for instance , the starburst ngc  4858 , which is not detected in hi  in the present survey ( def@xmath1  @xmath20.93 ) , shows normal co emission .",
    "the same is true for the detected , yet hi  deficient galaxies such as ngc  4848 , ngc  4911 , and ngc  4921 . on the basis of new co data for galaxies in coma , boselli et al .",
    "1997 conclude that no correlation is observed between h@xmath24 content and the hi  deficiency parameter , and that molecular gas is not perturbed by the interaction with the igm .",
    "more recent co observations for galaxies in coma , by lavezzi et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , give additional support to that conclusion .",
    "while co and hi  do not correlate , we show in fig .  7",
    "that in coma star formation does appear to correlate with hi  deficiency .",
    "in that figure we display the hi  deficiency versus the muv ",
    "b color , a very good tracer of star formation .",

    "points in the bottom right corner of fig .  7",
    "correspond to the three central early spirals ( ngc  4907 , ngc  4911 , and ngc  4921 ) .",
    "this trend , where galaxies with red muv  b colors are the most hi  deficient , has also been found in virgo by giovanelli and haynes ( 1983 ) . thus apparently colors become redder if the interaction with the igm is effectively stripping the hi  gas . as a comparison ,",
    "we show in fig .",
    "8 a plot muv - b vs. the m@xmath25  surface density ( drawn by the ratio between m@xmath25  and the optical disk area ) for seven of the most hi  deficient galaxies in coma .",
    "this figure shows a weak correlation between the muv - b color and the molecular content , a high dispersion is seen ( the correlation coefficient is only 0.47 ) .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the clear correlation shown in fig .",
    "7 is not due to a color  morphology trend , as hi  deficiency occurs both in early and late spirals .",
    "we tested for a possible correlation between the hi  deficiency and the morphological type , and the result is that no trend is found ( see column  7 in table  2 and column  9 in table  3 ) .",
    "these results suggest that in coma as in virgo ( giovanelli and haynes 1983 ) stripping has affected the star formation history of the galaxies .",
    "three fields were observed in the coma periphery .",
    "the eastern field ( field 11 ) was centered on the early type spiral ngc  4944 , for which we do not confirm gavazzi s ( 1987 ) detection .",
    "quite surprisingly two other non detections are in this region .",
    "biviano et al .",
    "( 1996 ) propose that ngc  4944 is the center of one of the groups in the coma structure .",
    "the general hi  deficiency of this group suggests that it already passed through the cluster center .    in the northern region , the hi  data confirm the presence of two other groups .",
    "the first of them , observed in field 6 , is possibly associated with the blue disk galaxy cgcg  160098 .",
    "we detected 3 hi  rich galaxies in that zone ( cgcg  160098 , foca  195 , and kug  1258 + 287 ) .",
    "they are separated from each other by distances around 13@xmath3  ( @xmath4260 kpc ) , and their velocities range from 8426  km  s@xmath12  to 8884  km  s@xmath12 .",
    "ours is the first redshift determination of foca  195 .",
    "we also see hi  emission , still to be confirmed , 1.4@xmath3  w of kug  1258 + 287 , which does not seem to have an optical counterpart on the dss .",
    "the total hi  mass is 2.2@xmath710@xmath5  m@xmath14 , a typical value for a dwarf galaxy .",
    "the last field ( field 5 ) was pointed @xmath41.2@xmath0  ne of the coma center . in this field",
    "we detected two hi  rich galaxies , ic  842 , and ic  4088 , and the interacting system ngc  4922 , located 84@xmath3  away from the cluster center . the pair ngc  4922 is the brightest ir object in coma ( mirabel & sanders 1988 ) , composed of a brighter spiral component in the north , and a fainter lenticular in the south .",
    "in addition , the spiral has a central radio continuum source , 5c4.130 , with a flux of 60 mjy ( wilson 1970 ) .",
    "we detect weak hi  emission and confirm the strong absorption feature reported by gavazzi ( 1987 ) .",
    "we confirm that the hi  absorption and emission features are centered on the northern spiral component .",
    "three hi  rich dwarf systems were detected in field 5 , associated with the spiral ic  4088 .",
    "their hi  maps look quite regular .",
    "the dwarf galaxies are previously uncatalogued in hi , except [ gmp83 ]  1866 , which was reported by sullivan ( 1989 ) .",
    "this object shows a total hi  mass of @xmath42.1@xmath710@xmath26  m@xmath14 , and a velocity width of 173  km  s@xmath12 .",
    "the two other dwarfs have hi  masses in the range 2.26.1@xmath710@xmath13  m@xmath14 , and velocity widths of 43  km  s@xmath12  and 130  km  s@xmath12 .",
    "the position of these galaxies and the absence of hi  rich dwarfs close to the center of coma , suggests that these systems tend to be present only in the outskirts of the cluster , associated with luminous galaxies .",
    "this is supported by the fact that we devoted only two fields to observe regions far from the x - ray source of coma , and it is there where hi  rich dwarfs appear , while in the remaining more central ten fields ( a 5 times larger observed volume ) , we detected none of these objects .",
    "the goal of our hi  imaging studies of clusters of galaxies is twofold : to investigate the interaction between individual galaxies and the cluster environment and to probe the dynamical state of the cluster .",
    "physical mechanisms affecting individual galaxies will be discussed in a second paper ( bravo - alfaro et al .",
    "1999 ) , here we place the observational results in the larger context of the cluster evolution .",
    "several recent papers have discussed the dynamical state of coma based on the optical mass distribution ( girardi et al .",
    "1994 , biviano et al .",
    "1996 , colles and dunn 1996 ) , the surface brightness distribution of the x  ray emission ( vikhlinin et al .",
    "1997 and references therein ) and the temperature structure of the x ray gas ( donnelly et al .",
    "1999 and references therein ) . the cluster hi  distribution shown in figures  2 , 5 and 6 , strengthens some of the arguments used by those authors .",
    "these figures show gas rich galaxies associated with the cgcg  160098 and ic  4088 in the north , a lack of hi  in the groups associated with ngc  4944 in the east , ngc  4911 in the center and ngc  4839 in the south .",
    "the hi  deficient galaxies are east of the center , while the non detection are mostly west of the center .",
    "this result is consistent with the recent analysis by donnelly et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , who find that there is cooler gas just south and south east of the center , while there is a hot spot in the x  ray gas just north of the center .",
    "these authors argue that most likely the ngc  4874 group is a recent arrival in coma , leaving behind a cool trail of gas , the hot spot would then be the bow shock generated as the group moves through the igm .",
    "interestingly numerical simulations show ( roettiger et al .",
    "1996 ) that in minor mergers the infalling object will first develop a protective bow shock , which will shelter the galaxies from being ram pressure stripped .",
    "close to core passage the infalling object s ism encounters a rapidly increasing density , leading to a burst of ram pressure stripping .",
    "this may explain that we do detect galaxies east and south east of the center , though they are hi  deficient , while our non detections are mostly west of the center and those galaxies have probably already passed the core .",
    "note that several of the small hi  disks in coma are very asymmetric , indicative of current stripping , since any asymmetry would be smeared out in roughly one rotation period ( @xmath410@xmath5 years ) .",
    "a question that remains is what triggered and stopped the starburst in the blue disk galaxies and psbs respectively .",
    "several mechanisms have been suggested , galaxy  galaxy interactions ( combes et al .",
    "1988 ) , galaxy harassment ( moore et al .  1996 , 1999 ) , potential of a group  cluster interaction ( bekki 1999 ) , and ism  igm interactions ( poggianti et al .",
    "1999 and references therein ) .",
    "least likely of those is the galaxy  galaxy interaction scenario .",
    "the blue disks are located close to the center , in the outskirts of the x ray source and show no optical signs of being disturbed .",
    "our hi  observations showed that it is the galaxies in the outer parts of the cluster that have gas rich companions , while most of the center galaxies appear more isolated .",
    "we investigated this further by counting the number of galaxies inside a 5  arcmin circle around each of the galaxies in tables  2 and 3 .",
    "five arcmin corresponds to 100 kpc at the distance of coma , encounters at larger distances are unlikely to be effective ( moore et al .",
    "1999 suggest that an encounter with an impact parameter of 60 kpc is typical in a rich cluster of galaxies ) .",
    "the number of neighbours was taken from ned , which unfortunately has rather incomplete velocity information . in figure  9",
    "we plot muv - b color versus number of close neighbours .",
    "clearly no correlation is seen in this plot , and blue galaxies do not show an excess of close neighbours ( if the weak trend in the opposite direction was real , it would mean that red objects have a slightly larger number of neighbours ) .    the location of the blue disk galaxies and the observation that the uv radiation peaks in an annulus 20  arcmin from center ( donas et al .",
    "1995 ) , something which has also been found in more distant clusters ( butcher and oemler 1984 , mellier et al .",
    "1988 , dressler & gunn 1990 , dressler et al .",
    "1999 ) , makes it more likely that the starbursts are caused by gas  gas interaction or an interaction with the global cluster potential .",
    "the fact that the blue disk galaxies are hi  deficient and have lost their gas in the outer parts , makes an ism ",
    "igm interaction slightly more plausible than the interaction with a tidal field ( bekki 1999 ) .",
    "tidal interactions tend to move gas toward the center and outward ( barnes,1998 ) , thus even if it is the tidal interaction that causes the burst , the gas in the outer parts must still have been removed some other way",
    ". numerical work by stevens et al .",
    "( 1999 ) shows that interaction between galaxies and the igm may produce mass loss and features like bow  shocks and stripped tails ( observed in x  ray ) , that should be present in cluster with different degrees of richness .",
    "these effects are well known to prelude star formation activity .",
    "observationally , most of the detected blue disks in the present survey are projected inside or at the edge of the x - ray emission and they seem to have lost their hi  in the outer parts , while the non detected blue disk ( ngc  4858 ) sits even deeper within the x  ray source .",
    "it is especially the loss of hi  in the outer parts of galaxies that is suggestive . of the psb galaxies",
    "none is detected in hi , and most of them are located within the x - ray source .",
    "thus it seems plausible that in coma at least the starburst gets triggered by an interaction with the igm and the starburst is likely to stop because most of the remaining gas gets swept out of the galaxies .",
    "we carried out a 21  cm survey of the coma cluster with the vla .",
    "high resolution images were obtained for 19 spiral galaxies inside 1r@xmath10  ( 1.2@xmath0 ) .",
    "five of the galaxies in the present survey are new detections in 21  cm .",
    " we find gas rich and gas poor groups of galaxies in coma that can be isolated in space and velocity .",
    "the groups north of the cluster are gas rich while groups associated with ngc  4944 to the east and ngc  4939 to the southwest are hi  poor . even in the cluster center asymmetries",
    "occur , the galaxies west of the center are very hi deficient with small hi  disks , while the galaxies east of the center are not detected at all in hi .",
    "we suggest that the most hi  poor groups have gone through the center , while the deficient galaxies east of the center are currently falling and being stripped .     as expected , the environmental effects on the hi  properties of spirals in coma are stronger than those previously reported in virgo , where the igm is less dense than in coma .",
    " we confirm the tendency of hi  deficient galaxies to be closer to the cluster core : seven of the detected galaxies are very hi  deficient ( def@xmath1@xmath20.4 ) , and they lie inside a radius of 30@xmath3  from the cluster center .",
    "this zone roughly coincides with the x  ray emission . with no exception",
    "these galaxies show very perturbed hi  distributions . for most of them",
    "ram pressure by the dense igm is a likely explanation of their abnormal hi  properties , but also other mechanisms , such as viscous stripping and conversion of hi  to molecular gas , are probably present .     six blue disk galaxies are detected in coma in hi .",
    "four of them are hi  deficient and they are projected inside an annular zone between 20@xmath3  ( 0.4 mpc ) and 30@xmath3  ( 0.6 mpc ) from the cluster center .",
    "this has been observed in high redshift clusters where star forming galaxies seem to avoid the cluster core , appearing first at a radius of @xmath40.5 mpc .",
    "this annulus roughly coincides in coma with the outer region of the x  ray emission as well as the peak of uv emission .",
    "this confirms a close correlation between the location of star forming galaxies and global properties of the cluster .    ",
    "eleven psbs were observed in this survey but none was detected ; hi  mass upper limit as low as 3@xmath710@xmath18  m@xmath14  are found .",
    "most of these galaxies are projected onto the hot igm medium outlined by the x - ray emission .",
    " we find a correlation between hi  deficiency and uv - b color , in the sense that the most deficient galaxies are reddest .",
    "this suggests that the loss of atomic gas reduces the star formation rate , despite the fact that the molecular gas seems hardly affected .",
