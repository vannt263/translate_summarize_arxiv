    "the heavy fermion systems have fascinated the condensed matter physicists with the exciting physics in the vicinity of quantum critical point .",
    "most of the known heavy fermion systems belong to ce- , yb- or u - based intermetallic compounds .",
    "recently discovered pr - based heavy fermion superconductor pros@xmath4sb@xmath5 @xcite presents many unusual phenomena , such as , two distinct superconducting phases , time reversal symmetry breaking , and point nodes at fermi surface etc . @xcite",
    "in contrast to the numerous ce - based magnetically mediated heavy fermion superconductors , pros@xmath4sb@xmath5 is the only known pr - based heavy fermion superconductor .",
    "further , in contrast to the case of ce - compounds where spin kondo effect leads to the heavy fermion behaviour , in pr - compounds like prinag@xmath0 and prfe@xmath4p@xmath5 it is the quadrupolar kondo effect which is suggested to be responsible for heavy fermion behaviour .",
    "another important mechanism for mass enhancement in pr - compounds is the inelastic scattering of conduction electrons by the angular momentum associated with the crystal electric field ( cef ) levels , referred as excitonic mass enhancement .",
    "the theory of excitonic mass enhancement was proposed by white and fulde @xcite to explain the mass enhancement in elemental pr itself and subsequently extended to rare earth systems with a cef - split nonmagnetic singlet ground state .",
    "@xcite the true realization of heavy fermion behaviour due to crystal field excitatons was found in pros@xmath4sb@xmath5 with a sommerfeld coefficient @xmath1 @xmath2 350 mj / mole  k@xmath3 .",

    "@xcite we present further evidence for excitonic mass enahancement in prrh@xmath0b@xmath0c in this paper .",
    "in addition to providing one more example of pr - based heavy fermion compound through our analysis of specific heat data we attempt to provide a qualitative explanation of the unusual route to the heavy fermion state in this compound .",
    "prrh@xmath0b@xmath0c is a new member of the quaternary borocarbide family that gives rise to the hope to provide a new route to high temperature superconductivity in boron based compounds which provided a unique playground to investigate the interplay between superconductivity and magnetism .",

    "heat capacity was measured by relaxation method in a physical property measurement system ( ppms , quantum design ) , and electrical resistivity was measured by the standard ac four probe techniques using the ac - transport option of ppms .",
    "electrical resistivity measurements under hydrostatic pressure were carried out in a double - layer piston - cylinder type pressure cell for pressures up to 23 kbar .",
    "silicone fluid served as pressure transmitting medium .",

    "it is observed that below 0.5 k @xmath19 increases with decreasing temperature ( inset of fig .",

    "the resistivity decreases almost linearly with decreasing temperature .",
    "we attribute the anomaly around 10 k to be due to crystal field effect which is consistent with the specific heat data .",
    "the electrical resistivity of larh@xmath0b@xmath0c which we measured down to 0.5 k also shows metallic behaviour .",
    "a rapid drop is observed in resistivity of the la - based compound below 3 k possibly due to incipient superconductivity .",

    "4 plotted as @xmath21 _ vs. _ @xmath22 below 5 k. a @xmath22 temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity is a characteristic of non - fermi liquid behaviour as predicted by the spin fluctuation theory for a three dimensional system near an antiferromagnetic quantum critical point ( af - qcp ) .",
    "however in our compound because of the singlet ground state the departure from the fermi liquid behaviour is more likely to be due to the presence of low - lying cef levels .",
    "further on , the residual resistivity is rather high which makes the power law exponent not so reliable .",
    "therefore , we refrain from putting too much stress on the resistivity exponent and the associated non - fermi liquid nature and proximity of prrh@xmath0b@xmath0c to an af - qcp .",
    "we also calculated the value of wilson ratio using the value of @xmath30 = 0.25 emu / mole at 2 k and @xmath13 = 3.59 @xmath14 together with @xmath1 @xmath2 250 mj / mole  k@xmath3 and obtained r@xmath31 = 17 which is quite large .",
    "the high value of electronic specific heat coefficient @xmath1 together with the enhanced value of r@xmath31 is a clear indication of strong correlations and heavy fermion behaviour in this compound .",
    "since no kondo - like behaviour is observed in @xmath32 , the mechanism for the heavy fermion behaviour may be rooted in the low lying cef splitting similar to that in the heavy fermion superconductor pros@xmath4sb@xmath5 .",
    "@xcite it was suggested by fulde and jensen @xcite that for a system with cef - split singlet ground state and low cef splitting energy the inelastic scattering of conduction electrons with the excited levels of angular momentum of the 4__f _ _ electrons can result in an enhanced mass of the conduction electrons .",
    "after a rigorous theoretical analysis they have shown that the enhanced mass due to the inelastic transition between two levels _",
    "i _ and _ j _ can be found by the expression @xcite ,    @xmath33    where _",
    "j@xmath34 _ is the exchange integral coupling between the conduction electrons and the _ f _ electrons , and n(0 ) conduction electron density of states at the fermi level . the matrix element between _",
    "i _ and _ j _ can be calculated using the cef parameters .",
    "an inelastic neutron scattering experiment on prrh@xmath0b@xmath0c is highly desired to know the exact cef level scheme and evaluate the matrix elements .",
    "the cef analysis of specific heat data clearly suggests a cef - split singlet ground state with another singlet excited state at about 14 k and therefore an excitonic mass enhancement by the crystal field excitations leading to the heavy fermion behaviour in prrh@xmath0b@xmath0c .    using similar cef analysis of magnetic specific heat data",
    "we have seen that prpd@xmath0b@xmath0c also has a singlet ground state lying below the first excited singlet at 50 k and a doublet at 80 k. @xcite however , the value of sommerfeld coefficient @xmath1 @xmath2 16 mj / mole  k@xmath3 is much lower than that of prrh@xmath0b@xmath0c , consistent with the theory of white and fulde @xcite , the @xmath1-value being inversely proportional to the separation between the ground state and the excited state . for a better insight of excitonic mass enhancement in pr - compounds with nonmagnetic singlet ground state we present the values of sommerfeld coefficient @xmath35 , crystal field splitting energy @xmath36 and low temperature saturation value of magnetic susceptibility @xmath30 in table i.",
    "a comparison of @xmath35 and @xmath36 in these systems clearly reflect a systematic variation in their value , a smaller @xmath36 results in an increased @xmath35 and vice - versa .",
    "all these results establish the more general nature of the mechanism of excitonic mass enhancement in pr - compouds , and the mass enhancement due to low lying crystal field excitations can even lead to the development of heavy fermion state as in our system prrh@xmath0b@xmath0c .",

    "inset shows the extended view of low temperature resistivity.,width=321 ]    the application of pressure is expected to change the cef level splitting energy and therefore to influence the physical properties .",
    "we therefore made an effort to achieve a stable ordered phase in prrh@xmath0b@xmath0c by applying external pressure . in the resistivity studies shown in fig .",
    "5 no significant effect ( except a slight increase in magnitude of resistivity ) of pressure was observed up to 23 kbar .",
    "especially , the position of the anomaly around 10 k attributed to the cef effect is independent of pressure ( the inflection point in @xmath37 characterizing the position of anomaly changes almost negligibly for the pressures of 0 , 1.33 and 2.24 gpa ) indicating that the applied pressure of up to 23 kbar has no considerable effect on the cef level splitting scheme .",
    "furthermore , this pressure is not sufficient to stabilize any superconducting or magnetically ordered phase in prrh@xmath0b@xmath0c .",
    "the insensitivity to external pressure can be explained in the very rigid framework of the rni@xmath0b@xmath0c structure as evidenced from a very high value of bulk modulus ( e.g. yni@xmath0b@xmath0c @xcite ) .",
    "we present clear evidence of heavy fermion behaviour in the new quaternary borocarbide prrh@xmath0b@xmath0c .",
    "the mechanism for the electronic mass enhancement in this case is not the usual kondo effect but it is due to the low - lying crystal field excitations . in this compound",
    "the ground state is a singlet separated from the first excited state only by about 10 k. our effort to induce magnetism or superconductivity using hydrostatic pressure did not succeed .",
    "this is attributed to extremely rigid frame of the borocarbide structure as evidenced from high bulk modulus of yni@xmath38b@xmath38c .",
