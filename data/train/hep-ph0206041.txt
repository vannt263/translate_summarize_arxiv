    "the value of the @xmath0 sigma term @xmath1 is given in terms of the @xmath2amplitude ( bar indicates that the pseudovector born term is subtracted ) at the chang - dashen ( cd ) point @xmath3:@xmath4 where @xmath5=92.4 mev is the pion decay constant . for details concerning the @xmath0 kinematics we refer to reference@xcite .",
    "generally , there are two kinds of methods used to calculate the @xmath6amplitude at the cd point .",
    "the first method uses dispersion relations to calculate @xmath7 directly .",
    "the second method determines the coefficients in the subthreshold expansion of the @xmath6 amplitude:@xmath8 where @xmath9 denotes contributions from the first two terms , and @xmath10 is so called curvature term that includes contributions of quadratic and higher terms . obtained values for @xmath1 range from  60 @xmath11 to 93 @xmath12    it is of interest to understand which partial waves give important contributions to @xmath6 in each of the above mentioned methods .",
    "it is clear that the leading contributions come from the input s and p waves , but earlier evaluations(see reference@xcite and references therein ) show that contributions from d and higher partial waves must not be neglected .",
    "in order to demonstrate the importance of the higher partial waves  in determination of the @xmath1 term , let s briefly describe two methods that have produced dramatically different results in the past few years .",
    "gasser , leutwyler , locher , and sainio(_glls_)@xcite proposed a method to improve results for @xmath9 previously derived from the kh80@xcite solution by taking into account newer , mutually consistent meson factory data below pion lab .",

    "the method is based on  six forward dispersion relations for the invariant amplitudes _",
    "_ d__@xmath15 , @xmath16  d waves and higher partial waves are needed as a part of the input below a cutoff momentum _ _",
    "k__@xmath17  above _ _ k__@xmath18 results from one of the existing pw solutions are used . as a result ,",
    "_ glls _ machinery predicts coefficients @xmath19 and @xmath20 in the subthreshold expansion .",
    "the curvature term @xmath10 was determined using another method@xcite .",
    "several further updates were made by sainio . in reference@xcite a value @xmath21",
    "@xmath11 was reported .",
    "higher partial waves below cutoff momentum _ _ k__@xmath22 were taken from ka85 solution@xcite .",
    "it was pointed out that results are rather insensitive to the choice of pw solution _ above _ the cutoff momentum .",

    "[ p ]    fig1.ps    starting from the fixed-_t _ dispersion relations for @xmath24 , olsson@xcite derived a sum rule in which the value of the @xmath6 amplitude at the cd point is expressed in terms of the s , p , d and higher partial waves threshold parameters .",
    "using kochs@xcite values for the d and higher partial wave scattering lengths , olsson obtained value @xmath25 using _ d - and higher partial wave scattering lengths from vpi / gw solution sm01@xcite _ , olsson and kaufmann@xcite recently obtained significantly higher values ranging from 80 @xmath11 to 88 @xmath11 .",
    "common to both of these high evaluations of the sigma term was the use of the higher partial waves at low energy from the latest vpi / gw solutions .",
    "the dependence of the sigma term on the higher partial waves can be easily seen when applying olsson sum rule .",
    "d - wave scattering lengths from the vpi / gw solution sp00 lead to the sigma term value that is roughly 19 mev higher than value in reference@xcite where d waves from ka84 solution have been used .",
    "the vpi / gw group recently made  some progress toward the lower values of the sigma term .",
    "d waves in their solutions sm01 and sm02  are smaller but still much higher than those from ka84 solution . in olsson sum rule  contribution of the sm02 d waves to the @xmath6 amplitude at cd point",
    "is 0.13 mev@xmath26 compared to @xmath27 from ka84@xmath28 that makes the sigma term roughly 11 mev higher than in reference@xcite .",
    "[ p ]    fig2.ps    it is important to point out that below the _ glls _ cutoff momentum @xmath29 @xmath14 reliable values for d and higher partial waves can not be obtained from experimental data only . in another words ,",
    "increase of the value of the sigma term due to contributions of d waves has no firm experimental foundation .",
    "d waves from vpi / gw solutions should be checked .",
    "one has to start from the first principle in @xmath0 physics - mandelstam analyticity and the analytic structure of the @xmath0 partial waves .",
    "consistency  of a given partial wave with analyticity can be tested using one of the methods developed in the past ( see reference@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "in the hyperbolic partial wave relations ( _ hpwr_)@xcite , a given @xmath30-channel partial wave is expressed in terms of other @xmath30-channel partial waves and the @xmath31-channel partial waves , multiplied by corresponding @xmath30-channel and @xmath31-channel kernels .",
    "explicitly known kernels in the hpwr reproduce the analytic structure of the @xmath0 partial waves .",
    "in addition , there is also a contribution from a nucleon exchange term that is explicitly known as well .",
    "the method is superior compared to other methods when predicting higher partial waves ( d waves and higher ) in the low energy region ( @xmath32 @xmath33 in that case , there are two leading contributions , the nucleon exchange and the _ t_-channel contribution@xcite .",
    "[ p ]    fig3.ps    due to behavior of the _",
    "t_-channel kernels , contributions from higher values of @xmath31 are strongly suppressed so that input available today makes it possible to obtain reliable predictions for the higher @xmath0 partial waves .",
    "for example , the main contributions to the isospin even combinations of d waves , @xmath34 come from the kinematical region _ _",
    "t__@xmath35  recent calculation@xcite shows that our input from the _ t_-channel in that kinematical region is fairly well known .",
    "results from _ hpwr _ for the isospin even combinations of reduced d waves @xmath36 , see ref.@xcite@xmath37 are shown in fig . 1 and fig",
    "it is evident that d waves from vpi / gw solutions sp00 and sm02 are not consistent with analyticity at low energies .",
    "for instance , the isospin even combination f@xmath38 ( shown in fig .",
    "1 ) has the wrong sign .",
    "d waves from sm02 solution are smaller but still far from being consistent with analyticity .",
    "d waves from the sm02 solution are compared to hpwr calculations in figures 3 and 4 .    _ _ it is hard to understand the fact that vpi / gw group@xcite constraints their p waves to the approximate chew low theory@xcite(lowering their value of the sigma term for 6 mev ) , completely ignoring at the same time results for d waves in ka84 that are constrained by exact pwdr .",
    "[ p ]    fig4.ps",
    "d waves in the vpi / gw sp00 and sm02 partial wave solutions are not consistent with analyticity in the low energy region and are evidently wrong . methods sensitive to the input d waves produce high values of the pion nucleon sigma term because of the low energy d waves from vpi / gw solutions .",
    "a high experimental value  of the sigma term could be accepted  as reliable only if partial waves from the  input partial wave solution are consistent with analyticity ."
