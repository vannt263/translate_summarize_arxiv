    "since the early davis experiment using the geochemical method to detect solar neutrinos via the + @xmath3cl @xmath4ar + @xmath5 reaction at homestake  @xcite , solar neutrino research has gone a long way to become now a mature field .",
    "the subsequent gallex  @xcite , sage  @xcite and gno  @xcite experiments have not only confirmed the consistency of the basic elements of solar energy generation , but also established that the deficit seen in the chlorine experiment also exists in the reaction + @xmath6ga @xmath7ge + @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "direct detection with cerenkov techniques using @xmath8 scattering on water at super - k @xcite , and heavy water at sno @xcite has given a robust confirmation that the number of solar neutrinos detected in these underground experiments is less than expected from theories of energy generation in the sun @xcite .",
    "especially relevant is the sensitivity of the sno experiment to the neutral current ( nc ) .",
    "altogether these experiments provide a solid evidence for solar neutrino conversions and , therefore , for physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "current data indicate that the mixing angle is large  @xcite , the best description being given by the lma - msw solution  @xcite , already hinted previously from the flat super - k recoil electron spectra  @xcite .",
    "we will briefly describe the results of the analysis of solar neutrino data and the resulting parameters in sec .",

    "atmospheric neutrinos are produced in hadronic showers initiated by cosmic - ray collisions with air in the upper atmosphere  .",
    "they have been observed in several experiments @xcite . although individual @xmath9 or @xmath10 fluxes are only known to within @xmath11 accuracy , their ratio is predicted to within @xmath12 over energies varying from 0.1  gev to tens of  gev  @xcite .",
    "the long - standing discrepancy between the predicted and measured @xmath13 ratio of the muon - type ( @xmath14 ) over the e - type ( @xmath15 ) atmospheric neutrino fluxes , has shown up both in water cerenkov experiments ( kamiokande , super - k and imb ) as well as in the iron calorimeter soudan2 experiment . in addition , a strong zenith - angle dependence has been found both in the sub - gev and multi - gev energy range , but only for @xmath16like events , the zenith - angle distributions for the @xmath17like being consistent with expectation .",
    "such zenith - angle distributions have also been recorded for upward - going muon events in super - k and macro , which are also consistent with the oscillation hypothesis .",
    "the atmospheric neutrino data analysis is summarized in sec .",
    "[ sec : atmosph - neutr ] .    on the other hand , one has information on neutrino oscillations from reactor and accelerator data , discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : react - accel - neutr ] .",
    "except for the lsnd experiment  @xcite , which claims evidence for @xmath18 appearance in a @xmath19 beam , all of these report no evidence for oscillations .",
    "these experiments include the short baseline disappearance experiments bugey  @xcite and cdhs  @xcite , as well as the karmen neutrino experiment  @xcite .",
    "particularly relevant is the non - observation of oscillations at chooz and palo verde reactors  @xcite , which provides an important restriction on the parameters @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "turning now to the new generation of long baseline neutrino oscillation searches , in a recent paper  @xcite kamland has found for the first time strong evidence for the disappearance of neutrinos travelling from a power reactor to a far detector , located at the kamiokande site .",
    "most of the @xmath18 flux incident at kamland comes from plants located between @xmath22 km from the detector , making the average baseline of about 180 kilometers , long enough to provide a sensitive probe of the lma - msw solution of the solar neutrino problem  @xcite .",
    "therefore these results of the kamland collaboration constitute the first test of the solar neutrino oscillation hypothesis with terrestrial experiments and man - produced neutrinos .",
    "kamland also finds the parameters describing this disappearance in terms of the oscillations to be consistent with what is required to account for the solar neutrino problem . as we will comment in sec .",
    "[ sec : impact - kamland - other ] this implies that non - standard solutions can not be leading explanation to the solar neutrino anomaly . on the other hand",
    "the k2k experiment has recently observed positive indications of neutrino oscillation in a 250 km long - baseline setup  @xcite .",
    "the collaboration observes a reduction of @xmath9 flux together with a distortion of the energy spectrum .",
    "the probability that the observed flux at super - k is a statistical fluctuation without neutrino oscillation is less than 1% .",
    "current neutrino data require three light neutrinos participating in the oscillations .",
    "correspondingly , the simplest structure of the neutrino sector involves the following parameters :    * the solar angle @xmath23 ( large , but substantially non - maximal ) and the solar splitting @xmath24 * the atmospheric angle @xmath25 ( nearly maximal ) and the atmospheric splitting @xmath26 * the reactor angle @xmath27 ( small )    since in the standard model neutrinos are massless , their masses must arise from some new physics .",
    "an attractive possibility is the seesaw mechanism  @xcite .",
    "however nothing is presently known about whether this is the mechanism producing neutrinos masses and , if so , what is the magnitude of the corresponding mass scale .",
    "in fact a more general view is that neutrino masses come from some unknown dimension - five operator @xcite .",
    "in contrast , neutrino masses could well be generated at the weak scale .",
    "one possibility is to have them induced by radiative corrections  @xcite . alternatively",
    ", neutrino masses may have a supersymmetric origin , resulting from the spontaneous violation of r parity  @xcite . in this case one",
    "is left with a hybrid scheme where only the atmospheric scale comes from a ( weak - scale ) seesaw , while the solar scale is calculable from radiative corrections  @xcite  .    out of the three neutrino masses ,",
    "only two splittings are fixed by oscillation data . as will be seen in secs .",
    "[ sec : solar - neutr ] and [ sec : atmosph - neutr ] , the neutrino of mass splittings needed to fit the observed solar and atmospheric neutrino anomalies are somewhat hierarchical . depending on the sign of @xmath28 there are three types of neutrino mass spectra which fit current observation : quasi - degenerate  @xcite , normal , such as typical of seesaw models and bilinear r - parity violation , and inverse - hierarchical neutrino masses .    turning to the three mixing angles , they are a natural feature of gauge theories and follow simply as a result of the fact that in general i=1/2 ( up - type ) and i=-1/2 ( down - type ) yukawa couplings ( mass matrices ) are not simultaneously diagonal . typically mixing angles",
    "are not predicted from first principles , as we lack a basic theory of flavor .",
    "however there has been a flood of recent activity in trying to ` post - dict ` neutrino mixing angles  @xcite .",
    "finally , the simplest structure of the lepton mixing matrix implied by a gauge theory of the weak interaction contains , in addition , three @xmath29 violating phases  @xcite .",
    "* one kobayashi - maskawa - like @xmath29 phase * two majorana - type @xmath29 phases    the majorana - type phases drop out from @xmath30 processes , such as standard oscillations  @xcite . as for the `` dirac '' @xmath29 phase , it does appear in such lepton - number conserving oscillations .",
    "however , the corresponding @xmath29 violation disappears as two neutrinos become degenerate and/or as one of the angles , e.  g.  @xmath27 , is set to zero  @xcite .",
    "given the hierarchical nature of neutrino mass splittings , and the smallness of the mixing angle @xmath27 indicated by reactor experiments ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : chooz ] ) it follows that probing @xmath29 violation effects in oscillation experiments will be a very demanding challenge . therefore all such phases will be neglected in our discussion of solar and atmospheric neutrino oscillations .",
    "in addition to the majorana phases , the theoretically expected structure of leptonic weak interactions is substantially more complex in theories where neutrino masses arise from the so - called mechanism  @xcite .",
    "this follows from the fact that such models contain 1 singlet leptons , so that the full charged current ( cc ) mixing matrix is rectangular , and the corresponding neutral current ( nc ) is non - trivial  @xcite . in other words , the weak cc and nc interactions of neutrinos becomes non - standard .",
    "this implies yet additional angles and phases , which may lead to lepton flavor violation , and leptonic @xmath29 violation ` even in the limit where neutrino masses would vanish `  @xcite .",
    "this has the important implication that such processes are unrestricted by the smallness of neutrino mass .",
    "given the many possible variants of the see - saw schemes  @xcite , one finds that in some of such models the iso - singlet leptons need not be super - heavy  @xcite , their masses lying at the weak scale or so .",
    "this leads to sizeable rates for lepton flavor and leptonic @xmath29 violating processes , unrelated to the magnitude of neutrino masses  @xcite .",
    "insofar as neutrino propagation is concerned , we note that in this class of models the ` effective ` cc neutrino mixing matrix is not unitary , with a non - trivial neutrino mixing even in the massless limit  @xcite .",
    "this brings in the possibility of resonant oscillations of massless neutrinos in matter , first noted in  @xcite .",
    "effectively , neutrino propagation in matter is non - standard , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : non - stand - inter ] . for the time",
    "being we neglect all these subtle features in the description of neutrino oscillations we give in sec .",
    "[ sec : neutr - oscill ] .",
    "it may also happen that some of the 1 singlet leptons are forced , e.  g.  by a protecting symmetry , to remain light enough to participate in the oscillations as ` sterile neutrinos `  @xcite .",
    "indeed , while the simplest three - neutrino picture is consistent with all other oscillation searches , it fails to account for the lsnd hint  @xcite .",
    "inclusion of the latter requires , in the framework of the oscillation hypothesis , the existence of a fourth light sterile neutrino taking part in the oscillations  @xcite .",
    "the presence of sterile neutrinos in the oscillations adds another mass parameter , and also increases the number of mixing parameters to six , in addition to @xmath29 phases .",
    "a detailed parametrization was first given in ref .",
    "a simple factorization convenient for use in a global analysis of oscillation data is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : diagram ] .",
    "we will adopt this generalized framework in the description of solar and atmospheric oscillations  @xcite presented in secs .",
    "[ sec : solar - neutr ] and [ sec : atmosph - neutr ] where we describe , in particular , the constraints implied by both solar and atmospheric data samples on the sterile admixture , @xmath31 . on the other hand this parametrization will also be employed in the global analysis  @xcite of all current oscillation data presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : combining - lsnd - with ] .",
    "neutrino oscillations are sensitive only to mass splittings , not to the absolute scale of neutrino mass .",
    "probing the latter requires either direct kinematical tests , using tritium beta spectrometers  @xcite , or observations of the cosmic microwave background and large scale structure , sensitive to a sub - leading hot dark matter component  @xcite .",
    "the present limits come from a long list of painstaking efforts to study neutrino mass effects in beta decays , which culminated with the mainz and troitsk results ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for the corresponding references ) . given the smallness of the solar and atmospheric mass splittings , the resulting ( conservative ) bounds on the sum of all neutrino masses  @xcite",
    "are illustrated in the ordinate of fig .",
    "[ fig : bbmass ] .    to decide whether neutrinos are dirac or majorana particles requires",
    "the investigation of @xmath32 ( l denoting lepton - number ) processes , of which decay provides the most classic example @xcite .",
    "indeed , there is a ` black - box theorem `  @xcite stating that , in a `` natural '' gauge theory , the observation of this process would signify the discovery that neutrinos are , as expected by theory  @xcite , majorana fermions .",
    "this connection is illustrated by fig .",
    "[ fig : bbox ] .",
    "the importance of this simple argument lies in its generalality : it holds irrespective of how is engendered .",
    "however , in order to quantify its implications , one needs to specify the particular model .    in the neutrino - exchange - induced mechanism ,",
    "is characterized by an `` effective '' neutrino mass parameter @xmath33 whose value is sensitive to possible cancellations among individual neutrino amplitudes .",
    "these may arise either as a result of symmetries  @xcite or due to the majorana - type @xmath29 phases  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless one can show that  @xcite , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : bbmass ] , there is a direct correlation between @xmath33 and the neutrino mass scales probed in tritium beta decays  @xcite and cosmology  @xcite .",
    "it is therefore important to probe in a more sensitive experiment  @xcite .",
    "although the three - active neutrino oscillation scheme gives a good description of both solar and atmospheric data , we will follow the approach given in ref .",
    "@xcite in which they are analysed in terms of mixed active - sterile neutrino oscillations .",
    "such generalized scheme has as advantages that it allows one to systematically combine solar and atmospheric data with the current short baseline neutrino oscillation data samples including the lsnd evidence for oscillations  @xcite , as done in sec .",
    "[ sec : combining - lsnd - with ] .",
    "this is justified , since current reactor bounds on @xmath27 ( sec .",

    "[ sec : solar - neutr ] and [ sec : atmosph - neutr ] ) describing the fraction of sterile neutrinos taking part in the solar oscillations . by taking such simplified analysis with @xmath35",
    ", we completely decouple the solar and atmospheric oscillations from each other , and comply trivially with the strong constraints from reactor experiments . for a complementary earlier analysis with @xmath36 effects , but no sterile neutrinos , see ref .",
    "@xcite . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : diagram ] , mixed active - sterile neutrino oscillations are characterized by a total of six mixing angles  @xcite .      the solar neutrino data include the solar neutrino rates of the chlorine experiment homestake  @xcite ( @xmath37  snu ) , the most recent result of the gallium experiments sage  @xcite  ( @xmath38  snu ) and gallex / gno  @xcite ( @xmath39  snu ) , as well as the 1496-days super - kamiokande data sample  @xcite .",

    "the solar neutrino data are fit with three parameters @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath31 .",
    "the parameter @xmath31 with @xmath34 describes the fraction of sterile neutrinos taking part in the solar oscillations , so that when @xmath47 one recovers the conventional active oscillation case .",

    "there is one caveat in deducing these bounds .",
    "namely , the form factors c and d are evaluated at @xmath206 in the decay matrix elements whereas in the scattering from which the bounds are derived , they are evaluated at @xmath207 .",
    "thus , some extrapolation is necessary .",
    "it can be argued that , barring some bizarre behaviour , this is justified  @xcite .",
    "a decay mode with essentially invisible final states which does not involve any new particles is the three - body neutrino decay mode , @xmath208 . in seesaw - type extensions of the standard electroweak theory",

    "although it can be enhanced in variant seesaw type models  @xcite where the isosinglet heavy leptons are at the weak scale instead or possibly even lighter , this decay is still likely to be negligible .",
    "another way to induce this decay is through radiative corrections .",
    "indeed , the @xmath208 decay , like the radiative mode , can occur at one  loop level in sm . with a mass pattern @xmath202",

    "although the current experimental bound on @xmath219 is quite poor : @xmath221 , it is still strong enough to make this mode phenomenologically uninteresting , at least in vacuo .",
    "there is a wide variety of models where neutrinos get masses due to the spontaneous violation of global lepton number symmetry , leading to a physical nambu - goldstone boson , called majoron .",
    "this leads to the most well - motivated candidate for invisible two - body neutrino decays  @xcite @xmath222 all couplings of the majoron vanish with the neutrino masses .",

    "@xcite is no longer phenomenologically viable , but it is possible to arrange many variants ) .",
    "an alternative way to generate fast invisible two - body neutrino decays is in models with horizontal symmetries , spontaneously broken at a scale @xmath223 , instead of lepton number  @xcite . in this case",
    "there can be several goldstone bosons ( familons ) , characterized by i=0 , l=0 , j=0 . even if there is only one familon , its coupling is typically not subject to the kind of cancellation characteristic of majoron schemes , so that the new decay mode in eq .",

    "[ ref : zp ] we briefly summarize the results obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite for the case for the proposed lama experiment , with a large nai(tl ) detector located at the gran sasso underground laboratory .     model , plotted versus the systematic error per bin .",
    "the results correspond to the cases of a 400 kg ( solid line ) and 1-ton detector ( dashed line).,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0%,height=188 ]   model , plotted versus the systematic error per bin .",
    "the results correspond to the cases of a 400 kg ( solid line ) and 1-ton detector ( dashed line).,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0%,height=188 ]    one sees that , for a low enough background , the sensitivity to the @xmath361 boson mass would reach 600 gev for one year running of the experiment .",
    "these values are reasonably competitive , and in any case complementary , to the sensitivity from direct searches at the tevatron  @xcite , or through precision electroweak tests  @xcite .",
    "the primary goal of neutrino factories is to probe the lepton mixing angle @xmath27 with much better sensitivity than possible at present and , hopefully , also the possibility of leptonic @xmath29 violation  @xcite .",
    "we have already discussed both the hierarchical nature of neutrino of mass splittings indicated by the observed solar and atmospheric neutrino anomalies , as well as the stringent bound on @xmath27 that follows from reactor experiments chooz and palo verde .",
    "we also mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec : neutr - oscill - param ] that the leptonic @xmath29 violation associated to the standard dirac phase present in the simplest three - neutrino system ( charcterized by a unitary cc mixing matrix ) disappears as two neutrinos become degenerate and/or as @xmath362  @xcite . as a result , although the large mixing indicated by current solar neutrino data certainly helps , direct leptonic @xmath29 violation tests in oscillation experiments will be a very demanding task for neutrino factories .",
    "here we emphasise on the role of neutrino factories in probing non - standard interactions .",
    "it has been shown  @xcite that nsi in the -channel can be studied with substantially improved sensitivity in the case of flavor changing nsi , especially at energies higher than approximately 50 gev , as illustrated in fig .  [",
    "fig : sensmtlow ] .",
    "for example , a 100 gev ` nufact ` can probe fc - nsi interactions at the level of @xmath363 at 99 % c.l .",
    "note also that in such hybrid solution to the neutrino anomalies , with fc - nsi explaining the solar data , and oscillations accounting for the atmospheric data , the two sectors are connected not only by the neutrino mixing angle @xmath27 , but also by the -flavor changing nsi parameters . as a result nsi and oscillations may be confused , as shown in  @xcite .",
    "this implies that information on @xmath27 can only be obtained if bounds on nsi are available .",
    "taking into account the existing bounds on fc interactions , one finds a drastic loss in ` nufact ` sensitivities on @xmath27 , of at least two orders of magnitude , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : conf ]     @xmath364 for different input values , as indicated by the points , at a baseline of @xmath365 .",
    "lines of constant event rates are displayed in grey .",
    "details in ref .",
    "@xcite , scaledwidth=35.0% ]    a near  detector offers the possibility to obtain stringent bounds on some nsi parameters and therefore constitutes a crucial necessary step towards the determination of @xmath27 and subsequent study of leptonic @xmath29 violation .",
    "these are exciting times for neutrino physics , driven mainly by experiment .",
    "we have given a brief overview on the status of neutrino oscillation physics , including the determination of mass splittings and mixings from current data .",
    "recent results bring substantial expectation on the potential of future data both of kamland and k2k which provide independent tests of the solar and atmospheric neutrino anomalies from terrestrial , man - controlled neutrino sources .",
    "the solar neutrino @xmath45 will be better determined after 3 years of kamland running , especially if the solar data also improve in the meantime .",
    "unfortunately progress in the determination of the solar angle will be less impressive .",
    "in contrast to the cabibbo angle , the mixing between the first two generations of leptons has been shown to be large , though significantly non - maximal .",
    "this opens new ways to probe the solar interior as well as supernovae .",
    "kamland has brought a turning point to the possibility of non - oscillation descriptions of the solar neutrino data , such as those invoking spin - flavor precession or non - standard neutrino interactions .",
    "although such descriptions currently provide an excellent fit of the solar data , they are now globally disfavored by about 3  @xmath101 and can only play a sub - leading role in the solar neutrino anomaly .",
    "analysing in further detail the resulting constraints is beyond the scope of this short review , which was commissioned well - before these results were available .    accepting the lma - msw solution ,",
    "we have nevertheless illustrated how current and future neutrino data can place important restrictions on non - standard neutrino properties , such as magnetic moments .",
    "we have also discussed the potential in constraining non - standard neutrino properties of future data from experiments such as kamland , borexino and the upcoming neutrino factories .",
    "we have also considered how solar and atmospheric neutrino data can be used to place constraints on neutrino instability , as well as @xmath0 and lorentz violation .",
    "let us stress that interest still persists in the investigation of non - standard neutrino properties , to the extent that , at least some , are well - motivated by theory .",
    "last , but not least , non - oscillation phenomena such as neutrinoless double beta decay would , if discovered , probe the absolute scale of neutrino mass and also reveal their majorana nature . with the era of neutrino properties entering a new age , we can only hope that the underlying mechanism for generating neutrino mass will start revealing its nature , a formidable task indeed .",

    "<S> we review neutrino oscillation physics , including the determination of mass splittings and mixings from current solar , atmospheric , reactor and accelerator neutrino data . a brief discussion is given of cosmological and astrophysical implications . non - oscillation phenomena such as neutrinoless double beta decay would , if discovered , probe the absolute scale of neutrino mass and also reveal their majorana nature . </S>",
    "<S> non - oscillation descriptions in terms of spin - flavor precession ( sfp ) and non - standard neutrino interactions ( nsi ) currently provide an excellent fit of the solar data . </S>",
    "<S> however they are at odds with the first results from the kamland experiment which imply that , despite their theoretical interest , non - standard mechanisms can only play a sub - leading role in the solar neutrino anomaly . accepting the lma - msw solution </S>",
    "<S> , one can use the current solar neutrino data to place important restrictions on non - standard neutrino properties , such as neutrino magnetic moments . </S>",
    "<S> both solar and atmospheric neutrino data can also be used to place constraints on neutrino instability as well as the more exotic possibility of @xmath0 and lorentz violation . </S>",
    "<S> we illustrate the potential of future data from experiments such as kamland , borexino and the upcoming neutrino factories in constraining non - standard neutrino properties .    </S>",
