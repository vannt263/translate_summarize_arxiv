    "the low - temperature physics of lattices of interacting quantum spins is typically very complex .",
    "the computational cost of even _ approximating _ basic properties , such as the ground - state energy eigenvalue , of these systems is prohibitive .",
    "indeed , for 2d lattices of interacting spins , the task of computing an approximation to the ground - state energy eigenvalue correct to within some polynomial confidence interval is fantastically difficult  this problem is complete for the complexity class qma , which is the quantum version of the complexity class np @xcite .",
    "it might therefore seem that the computational task of approximating the low - temperature behaviour of interacting quantum spins is entirely hopeless .",
    "however , for physically realistic models , this is not the case in practice .",
    "many algorithms have been developed which appear to provide efficient approximations to a wide variety of local properties of physically realistic systems , such as correlators , at low temperature .",
    "perhaps the most successful of these methods has been the family of algorithms based on the density matrix renormalisation group ( dmrg ) ( see @xcite and references therein for a review of the dmrg and description of extensions . )",
    "the dmrg is a remarkably flexible and adaptable algorithm , admitting a slew of generalisations .",
    "applications include : simulating dynamics @xcite , dissipative systems @xcite , disordered systems @xcite , and higher dimensional lattices @xcite .",
    "at least part of the flexibility of the dmrg is due to the fact that it is equivalent to a variational minimisation over the space of _ finitely correlated states _ ( fcs ) @xcite .",
    "hence , the methodology of the dmrg can be adapted to any situation where the principle object of study , be it an eigenstate or propagator , can be approximated using a fcs vector on hilbert space .",
    "an alternative to methods based on variations over fcs has been recently proposed which appears to offer spectacular computational speedups over the dmrg and relatives @xcite .    in practice",
    "it appears that the dmrg and related algorithms can efficiently obtain arbitrarily accurate approximations to the local ground - state properties of a @xmath2d collection of interacting quantum spins .",
    "however , at the current time , there is no satisfactory understanding of the _ correctness _",
    "( i.e.  will the dmrg _ always _ return a faithful approximation to the ground state and not some other eigenstate ) and the _ complexity _",
    "( i.e. , assuming correctness , how much computational resources are required to obtain a good approximation to a ground state ) of the dmrg .",
    "the correctness of the dmrg is far from obvious .",
    "this is because the ground - state approximation obtained by the dmrg _ can not _ be certified ; the dmrg only returns an approximate ground - state eigenvector and can not guarantee that this vector is close to the true ground state .",
    "it is therefore extremely desirable to determine _ a priori _ the class of systems for which the dmrg and relatives provably return faithful approximations to the ground state .",
    "the complexity @xcite of the dmrg is also difficult to ascertain .",
    "assuming we could prove correctness of the dmrg for a class of realistic physical systems , the actual complexity of the dmrg depends subtly on many detailed properties of the system , such as geometric entropy of the ground state , and nonconvexity of the objective function which is minimised .",
    "recently this situation is changing @xcite . in @xcite",
    "an analysis of the resource scaling of a dmrg - like algorithm to obtain approximations to the ground states of @xmath2d gapped local models was undertaken .",
    "this paper provides the first general subexponential estimate for the time and space resource requirements of any _ provably correct _ method to compute approximations to the ground states of gapped models ; it was found that if the model is gapped then resources scaling as @xmath3 , with @xmath4 some constant , are sufficient to obtain and store a computational representation of the ground state of a gapped local model @xcite . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that the ground state of some @xcite _ critical _ @xmath2d spin models can be _ stored _ efficiently .",
    "unfortunately , there is currently no theoretical argument which implies that these approximations to the ground states can be obtained efficiently .",
    "indeed , the results of this paper imply that if such approximations are obtained via adiabatic continuation then _ exponential _ computational resources may be required to obtain them .",
    "( note , however , that we can say nothing about the other methods to obtain such fcs approximations . ) finally , in @xcite it was shown that an approximation to the propagator for a @xmath2d lattice of quantum spins can be obtained and stored ( as a fcs vector ) using polynomial resources in @xmath1 and the error @xmath5 and exponential resources in the time @xmath6 .",
    "( it is straightforward to extend the argument of @xcite to show an analogous result in @xmath7d . )",
    "there is at least one solid reason why we believe that dmrg - like methods ought to provide a computationally efficient recipe to compute approximations to the ground states of gapped systems .",
    "namely , we know that the ground - state correlation functions for any gapped system are _ clustering _ or rapidly decaying with separation @xcite .",
    "this result , which is the natural analogue of fredenhagen s proof @xcite of clustering for relativistic quantum field theories , is especially impressive given that it applies to an extremely wide class of quantum lattice systems in low dimensions . as a consequence of clustering results we conclude that gapped spin systems are essentially free  an intuition which is persuasively backed up by classical renormalisation - group style argumentation  and thus can be modelled as noninteracting _ effective _ spins , which can be simulated easily .    another way of arriving at this conclusion is to think of correlations as roughly `` measuring '' the degree of _ quantum _ correlations in the ground state .",
    "since the amount of quantum correlations in a quantum state limits the extent to which a state can be approximated by a fcs @xcite , we are strongly encouraged to think that the clustering results may actually imply that dmrg - like algorithms may converge rapidly for at least some realistic gapped systems .    unfortunately , knowing that the correlations decay is not enough information to infer that the eigenstates are finitely correlated .",
    "to understand this simply consider a _",
    "generic quantum state _",
    "@xcite which is a quantum state chosen uniformly from haar measure induced on state - space . a generic quantum state exhibits rapidly decaying correlations ( indeed , all @xmath8-point correlation functions are essentially zero for @xmath9 ) yet",
    "such a state is extremely entangled and can not be efficiently represented as a finitely correlated state .",
    "nevertheless , it might be argued that the results of @xcite avoid this counterexample because they prove something stronger , namely _ exponential clustering _ , which says that the reduced density operator @xmath10 of the ground state for two arbitrarily large separated regions @xmath11 and @xmath12 is indistinguishable from a product @xmath13 when it is used to compute expectations for _ product _ observables @xmath14 .",
    "interestingly , a naive attempt to exploit this exponential clustering runs into problems .",
    "the reason is that there exist highly entangled states @xmath15 , called _ data - hiding states _ , which exhibit precisely these properties @xcite .",
    "thus , to prove that the ground state of a gapped local hamiltonian is well - approximated by finitely correlated state with polynomial resources we appear to need more information than that given by correlation functions .    despite some recent progress a solution to the fundamental problem , namely , to prove correctness of _ any _ algorithm which obtains approximations to local ground - state properties for gapped @xmath2d models and to further provide a _",
    "polynomial _ theoretical worst - case estimate on the resource requirements such an algorithm , still seems far away .",
    "let us summarise the various approaches to finding approximations to the ground state of a spin model and the theoretical obstructions encountered in each of these approaches .",
    "there are at least four ways to obtain an approximation to the ground state of a quantum system : ( i ) variation over a class of ansatz ground states ; ( ii ) simulation of the thermalisation process via imaginary time evolution or similar ; ( iii ) approximation of the convex set of reduced density operators of translation - invariant quantum states ; and ( iv ) adiabatic continuation from the ground states of classical spin models .",
    "the dmrg is an example of the first method , namely it is a variation over the class of fcs with fixed auxiliary dimension .",
    "unfortunately this variation is , in general , nonconvex and it has been recently discovered @xcite that hard instances for a closely related variation problem can be constructed .",
    "thus it seems likely that the dmrg is not correct in general .",
    "the second approach , namely imaginary time evolution , suffers from the shortcoming that an initial guess @xmath16 for the ground state @xmath17 which has nontrivial overlap with the actual ground state is required .",
    "if such an initial guess is unavailable then the storage requirements of the imaginary time evolution approach could be , in the worst case , exponential @xcite .",
    "it seems plausible that obtaining such a guess could be as hard as solving the original problem .",
    "the third method requires an exponentially good characterisation of the convex set of reduced density operators of translation - invariant quantum states in order to obtain @xmath18 estimates for local operators .",
    "the final method , which is the focus of this paper , suffers from the limitation that it is not known if the ground state of an arbitrary gapped spin model can be obtained via adiabatic continuation from a classical model without encountering a quantum phase transition .",
    "however , it has been recently proved @xcite that in the _ neighbourhood _ of a classical spin model adiabatic continuation _ will _ work .",
    "thus , using this approach , we are able to provide the first polynomial estimates on the resource requirements of a correct method to obtain a representation of the ground state of at least a subclass of gapped models .",
    "there is an intimate connection between simulating adiabatic continuation for quantum lattice models and simulating quantum computations @xcite .",
    "namely , if adiabatic evolution for an arbitrary 2d lattice model with a gap that scales as an inverse polynomial of the system size could be simulated efficiently on a classical computer then @xcite bqp@xmath19p , thus obviating the need to design and engineer a quantum computer in the first place ! naturally , our results are nowhere near strong enough to show the complexity class inclusion bqp@xmath19p , but they do have implications for error correction methods for adiabatic quantum algorithms .    a complete theory of quantum error correction for adiabatic quantum algorithms @xcite is still being developed .",
    "for example , for general thermalisation decoherence , we really have no idea how to calculate a fault - tolerance threshold for adiabatic quantum algorithms ( see @xcite and @xcite for a discussion of quantum error correction and fault tolerance . ) .",
    "presumably a general quantum error - correcting code for a quantum adiabatic algorithm would involve encoding the adiabatic evolution in a larger system such that the minimum spectral gap encountered along the evolution was larger @xcite .",
    "this would mean it would cost the environment more energy / unit time to induce a transition from the ground state during the evolution ( an `` error '' ) .",
    "it is natural to assume that the gap could be boosted to a large constant , independent of the number @xmath1 of spins , with a polynomial increase in size .",
    "our results show that if this were possible then we could simulate adiabatic quantum algorithms efficiently on a classical computer !",
    "thus , conditioned on the strict complexity class containment p @xmath20 bqp , we obtain a bound on how large the gap could be boosted by encoding for adiabatic quantum algorithms .",
    "the method we develop in this paper is very closely related to the method studied in @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the authors investigate the evolution of local operators under a quasi - adiabatic change in a local hamiltonian .",
    "as long as the hamiltonian has a spectral gap throughout the evolution , it was found that local operators remained local and thus it was possible to say that local gauge invariance remains when two hamiltonians are in the same phase .",
    "our task is similar : we wish to understand the expectation values of local operators in the ground state of a system that has _",
    "adiabatic evolution .",
    "we wish to show that the computation of such expectation values can be done efficiently on a classical computer as long as the smallest gap encountered during the adiabatic evolution is @xmath18 .",
    "while this calculation can be treated using quasi - adiabatic evolution and the methods developed in @xcite to study such evolutions , we prefer to study _ exact _ adiabatic evolution .",
    "we do this primarily in anticipation of the application of these results to studying entropy - area laws for systems in the same phase .",
    "we provide an efficient computational method to compute the expectation values of local operators in the ground states of hamiltonians undergoing exact adiabatic evolution , a method which works equally well for hamiltonians with spatially varying interactions .",
    "our method does not make use of the fcs formalism .",
    "rather , we develop our simulation method in the _ heisenberg picture _ , where locality is manifest . indeed ,",
    "if we were to make use of state representations in the schrdinger picture , i.e.  the 2d fcs formalism ( peps ) , we would be unable to apply our results because even if we could construct peps approximations to the adiabatically continued ground state it is currently unknown how to efficiently extract expectation values of local operators from the peps representation .",
    "we sidestep this issue by providing a ground - state _ certificate _ in the form of a specification of a local hamiltonian which can be efficiently numerically simulated in the heisenberg picture to extract local expectation values .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows .",
    "we begin in  [ sec : form ] by introducing the class of local hamiltonians we consider and stating the problem we wish to solve . in  [ sec : efflocal ] we then show how adiabatic evolution for quantum lattices of spins can be described by unitary dynamics of an _ effective _ local hamiltonian .",
    "we use this effective dynamics in  [ sec : effsim ] to construct an approximate local dynamics which can then be used to efficiently extract local properties of the adiabatically continued ground state .",
    "we conclude with some discussion of our results in  [ sec : disc ] .",
    "we detail some simple properties of compactly supported @xmath21 functions in appendix  [ app : cutoff ] .",
    "in this section we introduce the hilbert space and operator algebras for the systems we consider .",
    "we define what we mean by strictly local and approximately local hamiltonians .",
    "finally , we specify the computational task that will occupy us for the rest of this paper .",
    "we consider quantum systems defined on a set of vertices @xmath22 with a finite dimensional hilbert space @xmath23 attached to each vertex @xmath24 .",
    "we always assume that @xmath22 is finite .",
    "( there are some minor theoretical obstructions which currently preclude a simple extension of our results to infinite lattices ; we ll discuss this in a further paper . ) for @xmath25 , the hilbert space associated to @xmath26 is the tensor product @xmath27 , and the algebra of observables on @xmath26 is denoted by @xmath28 , where @xmath29 denotes the @xmath30-algebra of bounded operators on @xmath31 with norm @xmath32 and @xmath33 is the state space for @xmath31 .",
    "we assume that @xmath22 is equipped with a metric @xmath34 . in the most common cases",
    "@xmath22 is the vertex set of a graph , and the metric is given by the graph distance , @xmath35 , which is the length of the shortest path of edges connecting @xmath36 and @xmath37 in the graph . finally , by tensoring with the unit operators on @xmath38 , we consider @xmath39 as a subalgebra of @xmath40 , whenever @xmath41",
    ".    we will , for the sake of clarity , introduce and describe our results for a collection of @xmath1 distinguishable spin-@xmath42 particles .",
    "thus , the hilbert space @xmath43 for our system is given by @xmath44 .",
    "we now fix the metric for our vertex set @xmath22 to be that of a low - dimensional periodic lattice @xmath45 of @xmath46 vertices , where @xmath47 and @xmath48 is the dimension . because the case @xmath49 is the only really nontrivial case that interests us , we fix @xmath49 from now on .",
    "we refer to vertices as _ sites _ and identify each site @xmath50 with its coordinates @xmath51 .",
    "because the lattice is periodic we identify coordinates : @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "it is entirely straightforward to generalise our results to higher - dimensional lattices , higher dimensional spins , and to more general lattices .",
    "we consider a distinguished basis , the _ standard product basis _",
    ", for @xmath54 given by @xmath55 .",
    "we ll also have occasion to refer to a certain orthonormal basis for @xmath56 : we denote by @xmath57 , @xmath58 , the _ standard operator basis _ , where @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 , are the pauli sigma matrices .",
    "we define the _ support _ @xmath63 of an operator @xmath64 to be the smallest subset @xmath65 such that @xmath66 , i.e. , the smallest subset upon which @xmath67 acts nontrivially .",
    "let @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "we define the _ sumset _ @xmath70 of @xmath67 and @xmath71 by @xmath72 where the addition operation @xmath73 is inherited from the standard addition on @xmath74 .",
    "this operation is the natural generalisation of the convolution operation on the real numbers to the finite group @xmath45 .",
    "( it is fairly straightforward to generalise these operations to more general graphs . )",
    "we now introduce the family @xmath75 of parameter - dependent hamiltonians we are going to focus on . to define our family we ll initially fix some parameter - dependent interaction term @xmath76 which has bounded norm @xcite : @xmath77 .",
    "we think of @xmath78 as being `` centred '' on site @xmath79 , i.e.  we demand that @xmath80 . our family @xmath75 of quantum systems is then defined by @xmath81 where @xmath82 ( respectively , @xmath83 ) is the unit translation operator which translates the subsystems one site across in the @xmath36 ( respectively , @xmath37 ) direction , eg . , @xmath84 and @xmath85 . while the hamiltonian @xmath75 generated by this construction is translation - invariant ,",
    "none of our subsequent calculations depend on this fact in any serious way .",
    "hence the results of this paper apply equally to hamiltonians with spatially varying interactions .",
    "we are going to make three simplifying assumptions about our hamiltonian @xmath75 .",
    "the first is that @xmath75 is assumed to be _ strictly local _ which means that @xmath86 is an @xmath18 constant .",
    "the second assumption we make is that the interaction @xmath78 that generates @xmath75 can be written as @xmath87 , where @xmath88 and @xmath89 are two operators with @xmath18 norm .",
    "the final assumption is that the ground state is unique and the spectral gap @xmath90 between the ground- and first - excited states for @xmath75 satisfies the inequality @xmath91 , @xmath92 $ ] , where @xmath90 is an @xmath18 constant .",
    "note that the first two assumptions can be lifted with a little extra work , however , the assumption that the gap @xmath90 is an @xmath18 constant can not be relaxed : the simulation algorithm we present scales exponentially with @xmath90 .",
    "we will also have occasion to discuss _ approximately local _ hamiltonians .",
    "such hamiltonians are obtained in the same way as in ( [ eq : tihamdef ] ) , that is , we fix some initial interaction term @xmath93 which we then average over translates to generate our hamiltonian @xmath94 . in this case , however , the initial interaction term is allowed to have support equal to all of @xmath22 .",
    "the only constraint we make is that @xmath93 must _ decay rapidly _ which means that @xmath93 can be written as a sum : @xmath95 where @xmath96 , and @xmath97 consists of all the sites within a distance @xmath98 of site @xmath99 , i.e. , @xmath100 . as a result",
    ", @xmath101 is an operator with a support ( or `` radius '' ) consisting of @xmath98 sites centred on site @xmath99 .",
    "the rapid decay condition is then that @xmath102 where @xmath103 is some rapidly decreasing function of @xmath98 .",
    "we say that a hamiltonian @xmath94 constructed from the interaction @xmath93 has _",
    "rapid decay_. we write the final hamiltonian resulting from this construction as @xmath104 where @xmath105 .",
    "finally , we set out the problem we aim to solve .",
    "we suppose @xmath75 is a strictly local parameter - dependent hamiltonian for a @xmath7d lattice of the form ( [ eq : tihamdef ] ) , with interaction @xmath78 having @xmath18 norm and @xmath18 support .",
    "we assume that the ground state @xmath106 is unique and , further , that the spectral gap @xmath90 between the ground state and first excited state satisfies @xmath91 , @xmath107 $ ] , where @xmath108 is a constant independent of @xmath1 .",
    "finally , we suppose that expectation values of arbitrary local operators @xmath109 , with @xmath18 support , in the initial ground state @xmath110 can be computed efficiently , i.e. , @xmath111 can be computed efficiently for all @xmath109",

    "( when @xmath75 has spatially varying interactions we must require that the ground state of @xmath112 is a _ known _ product state .",
    "we need to do this in order to avoid the constructions of @xcite , which show that computing the ground state of a disordered classical systems is at least np - hard . )",
    "our approximation problem is therefore the following .",
    "first fix some error @xmath5 .",
    "then our problem is to find an efficient computational method to compute , for any local operator @xmath11 with bounded support @xcite , uniform approximants @xmath115 to the exact expectation values @xmath116 .",
    "that is , our problem is to efficiently compute @xmath115 so that @xmath117 for all @xmath118 $ ] and for all bounded local operators @xmath11 with bounded support .",
    "the constraint that the observables whose expectation values are to be simulated must have bounded support stems from the condition that in the large-@xmath1 limit such operators should be elements of the quasi - local algebra @xmath119 .",
    "we lose no generality in this assumption when applying it to the simulation of quantum algorithms because the answer that the algorithm computes should be encoded in the ground state in such a way that it can be read out from the expectation value of a local operator .",
    "it is also worth noting that any correlation function involving a bounded number of subsystems satisfies our definition of having bounded support .",
    "before we end this section we introduce some notation for approximations . because we have occasion to refer to functions for which only _ bounds _ on growth , derivatives , etc .",
    "are known it is convenient to adopt the following notation . if we have two quantities @xmath11 and @xmath12 then we use the notation @xmath120 to denote the estimate @xmath121 for some constant @xmath122 which only depends on unimportant quantities . in almost all the cases",
    "we consider the only important quantity is @xmath1 , the total number of spins .",
    "thus , unless we indicate otherwise , @xmath120 means that @xmath121 for some @xmath122 independent of @xmath1 . because we ll be interested in the consequences of allowing the minimum gap @xmath108 to depend on @xmath1 we ll explicitly retain any dependence on @xmath108 in our calculations",
    "in this section we study exact adiabatic evolution for quantum spin systems .",
    "we show that if there is a gap throughout the evolution then the exact adiabatic evolution is equivalent to unitary dynamics generated by an approximately local hamiltonian .",

    "@xmath240 we need to show that @xmath239 can be approximated by an operator with support only on a constant number of sites around @xmath241 .",
    "the way we do this is to show that @xmath239 is operator - norm close to @xmath242 where @xmath243 satisfies the differential equation @xmath244 and @xmath245 with @xmath246 .    to show that @xmath247 is close to @xmath200 we first exploit the general inequality @xmath248 which is proved , for example , by exploiting the lie - trotter expansion , and then upper - bound the right - hand side using the triangle inequality by @xmath249 where @xmath250 .",
    "we can upper - bound the integral on the right - hand side by using an argument identical to the one used to show ( [ eq : kbound1 ] ) .",
    "we thus obtain @xmath251 where @xmath216 is any power , and we ve used the fact that the number of sites in @xmath97 is given by @xmath252 . by choosing @xmath253",
    "we find that @xmath254 can be made as close as desired to @xmath255 .",
    "to obtain closeness of our final approximation @xmath247 to @xmath193 we use the triangle inequality @xmath256 where we ve used the upper bound ( [ eq : adecay1 ] ) with an adjusted value of @xmath216 and we ve also used ( [ eq : aalphadecay ] ) with an appropriate choice of power @xmath257 .",
    "we therefore find that it is sufficient , for a given constant @xmath5 to choose large ( but @xmath18 ) @xmath98 and @xmath258 so that @xmath259    the actual values of @xmath98 and @xmath258 required to reduce the error ( [ eq : finalaestimate ] ) to below @xmath5 scales better than linearly with @xmath260 , where @xmath220 is a constant multiplied by the minimum energy @xmath0 encountered along the adiabatic path .",
    "thus the support of the final approximation @xmath247 is given , in the worst case , by @xmath261 .",
    "note that @xmath262 depends , via @xmath227 , exponentially on @xmath263 , i.e. , the inverse energy gap .    because the final approximation @xmath247 can be computed via integrating ( [ eq : alphabetav ] ) , and by noticing that this integration can be performed by restricting our attention to the finite - dimensional subalgebra @xmath264 , where @xmath265 , we see that @xmath247 can be computed using resources which scale as @xmath266 , with @xmath4 some constant .",
    "in this paper we have shown how to efficiently calculate the ground - state expectation values of local operators with constant support for gapped adiabatically evolving spin systems . in order to provide our simulation method we reduced the problem to showing that under exact adiabatic evolution the expectation value of a local operator can be computed from the expectation value of an approximately local operator in the unevolved ground state .",
    "given this observation we then argued that if it is easy to compute expectation values of local operators in the original ground state then one could approximate the desired expectation values arbitrarily well by using time and space resources that scale with the inverse gap .",
    "our approach has several shortcomings .",
    "the first is that the scaling of the simulation resources with the error @xmath5 scales faster than @xmath267 .",
    "this means that if the expectation value of an operator which is a sum of many local operators is desired then our simulation method may require superpolynomial resources .",
    "for example , if the expectation value of the _ total _",
    "magnetisation @xmath268 ( as opposed to the more traditional _",
    "magnetisation @xmath269 ) is required to some accuracy @xmath5 then our simulation method will require superpolynomial resources .",
    "this is not entirely unexpected , after all , in the thermodynamic limit such operators are unbounded and can not be approximated at all .",
    "another manifestation of this shortcoming is that if the expectation values of the local operators are required to an accuracy which scales as @xmath270 then our method may require superpolynomial resources .",
    "these problems do not manifest themselves for the applications we have in mind .",
    "namely , when applied to the calculation of average properties of two states in the same quantum phase we only require accuracy to some small constant @xmath5 which does nt scale with the system size , and when applied to simulating adiabatic quantum algorithms we only need @xmath5 to scale as a constant in order to read out the answer of the algorithm .",
    "the second shortcoming of our method is that , by the current method , we are unable to directly approximate the scaling of the geometric entropy @xcite @xmath271 with @xmath272 .",
    "the reason for this is that our current method approximates @xmath273 by calculating approximations to all the expectation values of a basis of operators for @xmath274 . because we are computing _ approximations",
    "_ to expectation values we end up computing only an _ approximation _",
    "@xmath275 to @xmath273 .",
    "the best continuity result available for the von neumann entropy is fannes inequality ( see , for example , @xcite ) for a derivation ) which implies that the error in the approximation @xmath276 calculated from @xmath275 grows larger as @xmath272 increases .",
    "we ll describe an approach to this problem using exact adiabatic evolution in a future paper .",
    "the principle characteristic of our approach is that approximations are made in the _ heisenberg picture_.",
    "what we mean here is that instead of approximating the evolved quantum state of the spin system in operator norm we instead compute approximations to the evolved local operators .",
    "we should expect this strategy to be successful because the locality of the interactions in the hamiltonian does nt manifest itself in the schrdinger picture but , thanks to the lieb - robinson bound , it is precisely clear what locality implies for local operators in the heisenberg picture .",
    "because in the thermodynamic limit we are only able to physically access local operators ( such as average magnetisation and correlators ) this approach does nt lead to any loss of generality over computations carried out in the schrdinger picture .",
    "it is possible that our analysis acutally applies to all gapped spin models .",
    "this is because it is possible that any gapped spin model is adiabatically connected @xcite to a classical spin model with trivial ground state .",
    "classical renormalisation - group style argumentation certainly seems to back this statement up : after all , we know that the rg fixed points are either trivial ( classical ) or quantum critical points . however , there is as yet no rigourous general proof of this statement for quantum spin systems .",
    "we would like to suggest that the following description of the space of local ( translation - invariant ) spin models is correct .",
    "firstly , in this space there are many distinguished points , classical spin systems , where the ground state can be calculated trivially . around each of these points",
    "is a small region in hamiltonian space of hamiltonians which are provably adiabatically connected to the classical spin model points @xcite . in these regions",
    "we have shown that the local ground - state properties can be determined efficiently . outside these small regions",
    "there are other regions which may or may not be adiabatically connected to the classical spin model points where the hamiltonians are gapped . in these regions",
    "it is known that the local ground - state properties can be calculated using subexponential resources @xcite . on the boundaries between the quantum phases",
    "there are quantum critical walls . for these points , in @xmath2d , it is known that an approximation to the ground state as a finitely correlated state can be stored using polynomial space @xcite .",
    "it is not known if these approximations can be obtained efficiently .",
    "this picture is summarised in figure  [ fig : phases ] .",

    "compactly supported @xmath21 bump functions_. these functions are defined so that their fourier transform @xmath277 is compactly supported on the interval @xmath139 $ ] , and equal to @xmath2 on the middle third of the interval .",
    "such functions satisfy the following derivative bounds @xmath278 for all @xmath279 with the implicit constant depending on @xmath279 .",
    "this is just about the best estimate possible given taylor s theorem with remainder and the constraints that @xmath277 is equal to @xmath2 at @xmath280 and @xmath277 is compactly supported .",
    "the function @xmath148 has support throughout @xmath281 but it is decaying rapidly . to see this",
