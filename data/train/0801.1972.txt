    "interest in these operators arises from the special case @xmath25 , whereupon @xmath26 is the forward shift on @xmath20 , whose invariant subspaces are described by the famous theorem of beurling ( see ( * ? ? ?",

    "the goal of this section is to examine what our previous results say about the extended eigenvalues of analytic toeplitz operators @xmath26 , where , as always , @xmath24 is a bounded analytic function on @xmath21 . note that if @xmath24 is a constant function whose value is nonzero then @xmath491 , and if the constant value of @xmath24 is zero , then @xmath492 .",
