    "comet 103p / hartley ( hereafter `` 103p '' ) was discovered in 1984 and is a jupiter family comet ( jfc ) with an orbital period of 6.4  yr .",
    "a succession of encounters with jupiter in 1875 reduced the comet s perihelion distance ( from 2.9  au to 1  au ) and aphelion distance ( from 8  au to 6  au ) @xcite .",
    "thus , 103p appears to be a relative newcomer to the inner solar system and is one of the few comets to become an earth crosser in the recent past .    during its 2010 apparition ,",
    "103p was only 0.12  au from the earth on october  21 and was generally well placed for remote observations for several months near the time of its perihelion on october  28 when the sun ",
    "comet distance was 1.08  au .",
    "in addition , the _ epoxi _  spacecraft passed within 700  km of the nucleus of 103p on 2010 november  4 @xcite . for these reasons",
    ", we proposed a systematic ultraviolet ( uv ) spectroscopic investigation of 103p with the _ hubble space telescope ( hst)_. our team was allocated a total of 15 orbits of _ hst  _ time to observe 103p during the fall of 2010 , which we divided into three 5orbit observing runs : on september  25 , on november  4 , and on november  28 .",
    "here we report on our detection of carbon monoxide ( co ) gas in the coma of 103p near the time of the _ epoxi _  flyby on november  4 .",
    "we used two different _ hst  _ instruments : the cosmic origins spectrograph ( cos ) and the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) different gratings were selected to target different species ( table  1 ) .",
    "a 25 diameter aperture , which projected to 285  km at the comet on november  4 , was used for all cos observations , and a slit was used for the stis observation .",
    "the _ hst  _ observations of comet 103p / hartley were very challenging owing to the comet s relatively uncertain ephemeris and its fast apparent motion , relative to the background star field .",
    "a pointing offset maneuver of 77 was uplinked and executed prior to each orbit on 2010 november  4 to correct for the improvement in the comet s ephemeris between the times when the observations were planned and when they executed , several weeks later .",
    "_ hst s _ pointing control system was programmed to follow the comet s apparent motion . during each orbit an onboard target acquisition procedure",
    "located the comet s center of brightness , presumed to be centered on the nucleus , and then commanded the telescope to center the nucleus in the selected aperture .",
    "analysis of the acquisition images showed that the autonomous process worked as designed and centered the nucleus in the aperture to an accuracy of @xmath1005 for all observations .",
    "no cometary molecular or atomic emissions were detected in the stis spectra , which will not be discussed further here .",
    "for the cos data , we used extracted spectra from the `` x1dsum '' files produced by the cos calibration pipeline processing system ( `` calcos '' ) .",
    "we also examined the flat - fielded spectral images ( the `` flt '' files ) to search for potential artifacts associated with the spectral extractions .",
    "further details on cos , its operations , its performance , and its data products can be found in the cos instrument handbook and in the cos data handbook .    a spectrum of 103p taken with the cos / fuv configuration is displayed in figure  1 and shows the detection of co emission in the fourth positive group ( 4pg ; @xmath2 @xmath3 ) near 1500   .",
    "this is the first measurement of co in 103p and is the main result presented in this paper .",
    "a spectrum of 103p taken with the cos / nuv configuration is displayed in figure  2 and was used to search for co emission in the dipole - forbidden cameron system near 1900    , which is a tracer for @xmath4  in the comet .",
    "given the importance of @xmath4  for 103p @xcite , we first briefly discuss our @xmath4  result .",
    "although the _ hst  _ measurements can not detect @xmath4  directly , forbidden ( _ prompt _ ) emission in the co cameron system is produced during the photodissociative excitation of @xmath4  in the coma and can be used infer the rate of @xmath4   sublimation from the nucleus @xcite . from our upper limit on emission in the ( 1,0 ) band ( figure  2 ) , we place a 5@xmath5 upper limit on the @xmath4  production rate of ( assuming an outflow velocity of 0.78  km  s@xmath6 ) , which implies ( the @xmath0  production rate is discussed below ) .",
    "this upper limit is well above the @xmath4/@xmath0   abundance ratio of @xmath17% determined from _ hst  _ observations of co cameron emission in 1991 @xcite and @xmath18% determined from direct measurements of @xmath4  emission at infrared wavelengths in 1998 by the _ infrared space observatory _ @xcite .",
    "the _ epoxi _",
    "team directly observed infrared emission from both @xmath4  and @xmath0  during the 2010 apparition @xcite . for observations",
    "55  hr prior to closest approach ( ca ) of the _ epoxi _  spacecraft to the nucleus , they derive a @xmath4/@xmath0   ratio of 20% near a time of `` maximum '' activity . from observations",
    "@xmath12  days after ca , the _ epoxi _  data showed that the @xmath4/@xmath0   ratio increased by a factor of @xmath12 as the activity level changed from a minimum to a maximum , implying that near times of minimum activity .",
    "this latter value is only marginally larger than the @xmath4/@xmath0   ratios measured during the remote ( non-_epoxi _ ) observations of 103p during the 1991 and 1998 apparitions .",
    "thus , it is not clear whether the @xmath4/@xmath0   ratio in 103p has significantly changed during the past two decades .",
    "uv fluorescence of sunlight in the co 4pg system was discovered during a sounding rocket observation of comet in 1976 @xcite and has been used to measure the co abundance in approximately a dozen comets since then ( cf .",
    "we had previously searched unsuccessfully for co 4pg emission from 103p during _",
    "hst  _ observations in september 1991 ( using the faint object spectrograph ) and in january 1998 ( using stis ) . the more constrained upper limit from these measurements was 1% ( 3@xmath5 ) for the co/@xmath0  abundance in 1991 @xcite . with the higher sensitivity of cos",
    ", we were able to detect several bands of the co 4pg system from 103p on november  4 ( figure  1 ) , even though the @xmath0  production rate was @xmath15 times lower in 2010 compared to 1991 .",
    "table  2 lists the detected co 4pg bands with their wavelengths and integrated brightnesses .",
    "the co production rate appears to have increased by @xmath130% between visits  6 and 9 , which were separated in time by @xmath114.5  hr . the atomic emissions from c and s showed a similar change , suggesting there was a global increase in cometary activity for visit  9 compared to visit  6 .",
    "strong temporal variability correlated with the rotation of the nucleus was measured from multiple ground and space observatories .",
    "the rotational period of 103p was estimated to be @xmath116.64  hr based on observations taken during 2009 @xcite .",
    "however , the rotational period increased to @xmath11819  hr and the rotation became complex ( _ i.e. ,  _ not about a single axis ) near the time of the _ epoxi _  flyby @xcite .",
    "we used the extensive ground- and _ epoxi_-based monitoring of 103p to assess the comet s level of activity during the _ hst  _ observations ( figure  3 ) .",
    "the temporal changes recorded during the _ hst  _ observations seem to be consistent with the observed periodic variation in other species , which is apparently associated with the small end of the nucleus rotating in and out of sunlight @xcite .",
    "we employed a radiative transfer model for cometary co 4pg emission @xcite to convert the observed aperture - averaged brightness to a co column density .",
    "the model assumes the co emission is produced by the fluorescence of co molecules stimulated by sunlight ( _ i.e. ,  _ solar fluorescence ) .",
    "we used a solar ultraviolet spectrum appropriate for the current level of solar activity , and performed line - by - line calculations , assuming a rotational temperature of 75  k and accounting for solar spectral features .",
    "our best model match to the observed average 103p spectrum yields a co column density of    we used a standard radial outflow model ( cf .",
    "* ) to convert the column density to a gas production rate at the nucleus , assuming spherically symmetric outflow with constant speed . for the high spatial resolution observations discussed here ( 1  projects to 114  km at the comet ) , the finite lifetime of the co molecule can be ignored , and the gas production rate can be calculated from @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the gas production rate @xmath9 is the gas outflow velocity @xmath10 is the diameter of the circular aperture ( in cm at the comet ; for the cos aperture on november  4 ) , and @xmath11 is the aperture - averaged gas column density ( see above ) .",
    "we adopt which is an appropriate value for this moderately active comet ( cf .",
    "thus , the average co production rate from our observation on november  4 is the value during visit  6 was @xmath115% smaller and the value during visit  9 was @xmath115% larger    the statistical uncertainty in @xmath12 , based on the measured signal - to - noise ratio in the average spectrum , is @xmath120% ( 1@xmath5 ) .",
    "however , there are several sources of systematic error .",
    "the absolute calibration uncertainty is @xmath115% .",
    "based on previous results on similarly active comets , the estimated uncertainty in the outflow velocity is @xmath125% .",
    "another source of error is the mismatch between our fluorescence model and the observed co band intensities .",
    "for example , the model predicts that the ( 2,0 ) band is slightly brighter than the ( 1,0 ) band whereas the observations indicate the opposite .",
    "however , this discrepancy can be attributed to a detector artifact , which has @xmath13@xmath13 larger dark current than the surrounding region , near the location of the ( 1,0 ) band .",
    "there are other discrepancies , of varying magnitudes ( figure  1 , table  2 ) , between the measured and predicted co band intensities . taking all of these issues into account",
    ", we conclude that the true value of @xmath12  could be up to 50% different from our adopted value .",
    "the relative abundance of co in 103p is the ratio @xmath12/q@xmath14 , where q@xmath14  is the water production rate .",
    "although q@xmath14  was not measured during our _ hst  _ observations , an excellent record was obtained during ground - based infrared ( ir ) observations on november  4 @xcite .",
    "q@xmath14   increased by a factor of @xmath15 from the first ir observation to the last one but q@xmath14   appeared to be leveling off during the final 2.5  hr of the ir observations our first co observation was 5.5  hr before the first ir observation , and our second co observation was 4.0  hr after the last ir observation . by comparing when the _",
    "hst  _ and ir measurements were made relative to the periodic changes in the comet s overall level of activity ( figure  3 ) , we find that _",
    "hst  _ visit  6 was near the minimum activity level , and visit  9 was near the average activity level .",
    "the ir measurements were made during the rising portion of the activity phase curve , starting near the average level and ending at approximately the maximum . assuming a peak - to - valley activity ratio of 2 for @xmath0  @xcite , we therefore conclude that q@xmath14  was during visit  6 and during visit  9 , yielding co abundances of @xmath10.31% and @xmath10.29% , respectively . given the large uncertainties discussed above , we estimate that the co abundance was 0.150.45% .",
    "the co abundance in 103p is apparently the lowest ever measured in a comet .",
    "comets display a huge variation in the co abundance , ranging from @xmath10.4% to @xmath130% @xcite , but the reason why is unknown .",
    "although the most co ",
    "rich comets are long - period oort cloud objects , some long period comets have very low co abundances ( @xmath10.4% for c/2001 wm1 [ linear ] ) .",
    "there is not much information available on the co abundance in jupiter family comets ( jfcs ) , the dynamical class to which 103p belongs , owing to their low activity levels .",
    "infrared co emission was detected from jfc 21p / giacobini - zinner in october 1999 , implying a co abundance as high as @xmath115% @xcite .",
    "but ir co emission was not detected from 21p several weeks later , when the comet was brighter , giving a 5@xmath5 co abundance upper limit of @xmath13% @xcite .",
    "ir observations of jfc 73p / schwassmann - wachmann  3-c gave a co abundance of @xcite , comparable to the highest values allowed for 103p .",
    "a co abundance of @xmath146% was measured from jfc 9p / tempel , both before and after the outburst associated with the _ deep impact _",
    "event @xcite .",
    "a radio detection of co emission from jfc 17p / holmes yielded a co abundance of @xmath124% @xcite , but the observations were made shortly after the spectacular outburst of the nucleus in october 2008 and at a relatively large heliocentric distance , both of which are rather unusual circumstances .",
    "similarly , it is difficult to assess the compositional implications of the detection of radio co emission from 29p / schwassmann - wachmann  1 @xcite , whose orbit never brings it within 5.7  au of the sun .",
    "we assume here that all the observed co is coming directly from the nucleus . in some comets ,",
    "a significant fraction of the co observed in the coma is from `` extended sources '' ( _ e.g. ,  _",
    "@xmath16 , @xmath4 ; however , our high spatial resolution _",
    "hst  _ observations strongly favor the `` native '' source sublimating directly from the nucleus .",
    "we calculate that the photodissociation of @xmath4  and @xmath16  would contribute @xmath1710% of the observed co , assuming their relative abundances are 20% and 1% , respectively .",
    "similarly , the @xmath0  production rates quoted here assume all the @xmath0  is coming from sublimation at the nucleus .",
    "the results from the _ epoxi _  mission suggest that a substantial fraction of the @xmath0  in the coma is produced by the sublimation of icy grains ejected in @xmath4  jets @xcite .",
    "ground - based ir observations show that the @xmath0  spatial profile is more extended than expected for a parent species @xcite , suggesting at least one - third of the observed @xmath0  could be coming from an extended source ( dello russo , priv .",
    "comm . ) . if the icy grains presumed to be the source of the extended @xmath0  emission have a different co/@xmath0  ratio than is present in the bulk nucleus , the co/@xmath0  abundance reported here might not reflect the true composition of the nucleus .",
    "co is predicted to be the dominant c - bearing gas in the outer parts of the solar nebula where comets formed ( cf .",
    "however , co is extremely volatile with a sublimation temperature of @xmath120  k under solar nebula conditions @xcite .",
    "thus , the co content of ices incorporated into comets may have been very sensitive to the local conditions where the nucleus formed , or where the coldest part of the nucleus formed assuming there was significant radial mixing of material within the nebula , as suggested by the results from the _ stardust _  mission @xcite .",
    "the capture of co might have been enhanced by incorporation into a water ice clathrate @xcite or by trapping in amorphous water ice @xcite .",
    "but even if they were formed with significant amounts of co , jfcs can subsequently lose most of their original co by solar heating during multiple passes through the inner solar system .",
    "this may not explain the co depletion in 103p , which only recently had its perihelion distance substantially reduced .",
    "another possible explanation is that any co remaining in the nucleus is now buried below the regions that contribute significantly to the coma . in any case ,",
    "our _ hst  _ result suggests that co is probably a minor player in the comet s current activity and is not responsible for ejecting icy grains into the coma .",
    "based on observations made with the nasa / esa _ hubble space telescope , _ with data obtained from the archive at the space telescope science institute ( stsci ) .",
