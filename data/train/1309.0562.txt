    "the last two decades have seen the emergence and explosion of global research activities in quantum information science that promise to deliver quantum technologies , a class of technologies that rely on and exploit the laws of quantum mechanics , which can beat the best known capabilities of current technological systems in sensing , communication and computation .",
    "most of the envisioned quantum technologies are quantum information processing systems that process quantum information @xcite .",
    "typical proposals are realized as quantum networks : linear quantum optical computing @xcite , the quantum internet @xcite , and quantum error correction @xcite .",
    "quantum networks have also been experimentally realized in proof - of - principle demonstrations of quantum information processing , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "besides quantum information processing , quantum networks have also been proposed for new ultra low power photonic devices that perform classical information processing . in particular , photonic devices that act as photonic analogues of classical electronic circuits and logic devices , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "even relatively simple quantum networks may be difficult to simulate due to the large number of variables that need to be propagated .",
    "it is therefore necessary to look at model reduction .",
    "for instance , this has been used to obtain a tractable network model of a coherent - feedback system implementing a quantum error correction scheme for quantum memory @xcite .",
    "in particular , this involved reduced qsde models for several components that make up the nodes of the network .",
    "in fact , the process led to a simple and intuitive quantum master equation that describes the evolution of the composite state of the three qubits of the quantum memory and the two atom - based optical switches which jointly act as a coherent - feedback controller .",
    "the idea for this coherent - feedback realization of a three qubit bit(phase)-flip quantum error correction code , which can correct only for single qubit bit(phase)-flip errors , was subsequently extended to a coherent - feedback realization of a nine qubit bacon - shor subsystem code that can correct for arbitrary single qubit errors @xcite , see figure [ fig : qec3 ] .",
    "again , here qsde model reduction played a crucial role in justifying the intuitive quantum master equation that describes the operation of the coherent - feedback qec circuit .",
    "this paper considers a class of dynamical quantum networks with open markov quantum systems as nodes and in which nodes are interconnected by bosonic optical fields ( such as coherent laser beams ) . here",
    "the optical fields serve as quantum links or `` wires '' between nodes in the network .",
    "time delays in the propagation of the optical fields mean that the network as a whole is no longer markov , but fortunately , an _ effective markov model _ may be recovered in the zero time delay limit @xcite .",
    "the effective markov model can then be viewed as a large single node network , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : qec3 ] .",
    "this kind of limit will be referred to as an _ instantaneous feedback limit_.    another commonly employed approximation is _",
    "adiabatic elimination _",
    "( or _ singular perturbation _ ) of quantum systems that have fast and slow sub - dynamics with well - separated time scales @xcite . besides model simplification",
    ", adiabatic elimination has also proved to be a powerful tool for the approximate engineering of `` exotic '' two or more body couplings , see , e.g. , @xcite .    in @xcite",
    "it was established , for a special class of quantum networks containing fast oscillating quantum harmonic oscillators , that the instantaneous feedback and adiabatic elimination limits are interchangeable .",
    "the main contribution of the present paper is to extend the results of @xcite to general classes of quantum networks with markovian components .",
    "we work in the category of the hudson and parthasarathy ( bosonic ) quantum stochastic models @xcite . here",
    "we fix a separable hilbert space @xmath0 , called the _ initial _ or _ system _ ( hilbert ) space , describing the joint state space of the systems at the nodes of the network , and a finite - dimensional multiplicity space @xmath1 labelling the input fields . the open quantum system and the quantum boson fields jointly evolve in a unitary manner according to the solution of a right hudson - parthasarathy quantum stochastic differential equation ( qsde ) , using the einstein summation convention , @xmath2 with @xmath3 ( @xmath4 denotes the dimension of @xmath1 ) and @xmath5 $ ] is a _",
    "right _ it generator matrix in the set @xmath6 of all right it generator matrices on systems with initial space @xmath0 and multiplicity space @xmath1 ; see @xcite for conventions and notation . here",
    "right ( left ) qsde means that the generator @xmath7 appears to the right ( left ) of the unitary @xmath8 .",
    "following @xcite , we work with right unitary processes for technical reasons . the solution @xmath8 of the qsdes , when they exist , are adapted quantum stochastic processes .",
    "the right it generator matrix is written as @xmath9\\ ] ] with respect to the standard decomposition of the coefficient space @xmath10 , that is , as @xmath11 .",

    "throughout this paper we shall assume that all the components of @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 have a common invariant domain @xmath24 in @xmath0 ( here @xmath25 denotes the adjoint of a hilbert space operator ) .",
    "we further require that the hudson - parthasarathy conditions are satisfied : @xmath22 is unitary , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 .",
    "note that if the coefficients are bounded then these conditions are necessary and sufficient for @xmath8 to be a unitary co - cycle ( if they are unbounded then the solution may not extend to a unitary co - cycle ) . in the general case ,",
    "if @xmath8 is a well - defined unitary and @xmath28 is the initial pure state of the composite system consisting of the system and the fields at time 0 , then this state vector evolves in time in the schrdinger picture as @xmath29 . we assume throughout that the operator coefficients of the qsde satisfy sufficient conditions that guarantee a unique solution which extends to a unitary co - cycle on @xmath30 ( in particular this will always be the case when the coefficients are bounded )",
    "; see , e.g. , @xcite for the unbounded case .    note that @xmath31 is simply the adjoint of the corresponding _ left _ it generator matrices introduced for _ left _ qsdes in @xcite , and plays a similar role to the latter for right qsdes .",
    "since we will be working exclusively with right qsdes , from this point on when we say it generator matrix we will mean the right it generator matrix .",
    "we use the notation @xmath32 for a generalized inverse of an operator @xmath33 , that is , @xmath34 . throughout",
    ", we require that @xmath35 have @xmath24 as invariant domain .",
    "note then that @xmath36 .    given a non - trivial decomposition of the coefficient space @xmath37",
    ", we define the generalized schur complement operation of it matrices as @xmath38 where @xmath39 $ ] is the partition of @xmath31 with respect to the decomposition .",
    "the domain of @xmath40 is the set of @xmath41 for which we have the image and kernel space inclusions @xmath42im@xmath43 and @xmath44 ( this ensures that the choice of generalized inverse is unimportant ; see @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "@xmath45 maps into the reduced space @xmath46 .",
    "we shall often use the shorthand @xmath47 for the generalized schur complement .",
    "of course , if @xmath48 is invertible then the generalized schur complement reduces to the ordinary schur complement with the generalized inverse @xmath49 replaced by @xmath50 .",
    "the total multiplicity space @xmath1 may be decomposed into external and internal elements as follows @xmath51 leading to decomposition @xmath52 where @xmath53 .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that in the instantaneous feedback limit for the internal connections , the reduced it generator matrix is the schur complement of the pre - interconnection network it generator matrix , @xmath54 .",
    "with respect to the decomposition @xmath55 , we have , with @xmath56 $ ] , @xmath57 $ ] , @xmath58 /\\left ( n_{\\mathsf{ii}}-i\\right ) \\\\ & = & \\left [   \\begin{array}{cc } k & l_{\\mathsf{e } } \\\\",

    "we denote the operation @xmath60 of instantaneous feedback reduction by @xmath61 whenever the context is clear , and for well - posed connections it maps between the categories of it generator matrices in @xmath62 to @xmath63 @xcite .",
