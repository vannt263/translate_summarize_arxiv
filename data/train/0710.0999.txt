    "the phenomenon of particle production in an expanding universe is due , essentially , to the fact that in curved space - time the vacuum is not unique @xcite .",
    "as the universe evolves , and the curvature changes , the vacuum state also changes : the initial vacuum state , representing the state with no particle , becomes later a multiparticle state .",
    "the particle production is directly connected with the curvature of the universe .",
    "if the universe is spatially flat , the cosmic evolution leads asymptotically to a minkowski space - time , where the phenomenon of particle production does not occur anymore .",
    "however , this is true only if the strong energy condition is verified : the energy density @xmath3 and the pressure @xmath4 must satisfy the relation @xmath5 . if the strong energy condition is violated the particle production should be zero initially , increasing as the universe evolves , in connection with the increase of the four - dimensional curvature with time when @xmath6 .    in order to compute the particle production in a given cosmological model ,",
    "it is necessary to fix an initial vacuum state .",
    "if the universe is always decelerating , there is no natural and unique choice for this , since all modes are initially outside the hubble radius feeling strongly the curvature of the space - time .",
    "however , a natural choice for the initial vacuum state can be done for the case of an accelerating universe , since all physical modes are initially well inside the hubble radius , and they behave as in a minkowski space - time .",
    "this is one of the reasons why the primordial inflationary scenario is so successful theoretically : it encodes naturally a mechanism for quantum fluctuations , which will be later the seeds for the large scale structure of the universe @xcite .",
    "observations indicate that we live today in an inflationary phase , since the universe is accelerating @xcite .",
    "hence , the mechanism of particle production may play again a very important role today .",
    "suppose we define a quantum state for a given field today .",
    "the question we want to address concerns the rate of particle production .",
    "in particular , we would like to know if such particle production is so important that it can alters , by back - reaction , the later evolution of the universe . the back - reaction due to quantum effects",
    "has already studied in the case of the cosmological constant @xcite .",
    "the back - reaction may be particularly relevant for the case the universe is dominated by a phantom fluid since , classically , in such a situation the universe will inevitably evolve towards a new singular state , called the big rip .",
    "we remember that the observational data favors somehow a phantom scenario today @xcite .",
    "a phantom fluid has many special features .",
    "local configurations of a phantom fluid leads to regular black holes @xcite .",
    "in cosmology , a universe dominated by a phantom fluid implies a future singularity that will occur in a future finite proper time @xcite .    we will solve the rate of the particle production when the universe is flat and dominated by an equation of state @xmath7 , for an arbitrary value of @xmath1 .",
    "a simplified scenario , not considering the different phase transitions that occur in the real universe , will be adopted .",
    "the calculations will be performed for a massless scalar field , for which the corresponding klein - gordon equation is solved . through the quantization of the field",
    ", the rate of particle may be determined using the technique of bogolioubov s coefficients . the general solution for this problem",
    "is expressed in terms of bessel functions .",
    "the rate of particle production is determined exactly for any value of @xmath1 .",
    "the connection of this rate with the strong energy condition is established .",
    "it is shown that for a phantom fluid the rate of particle production diverges as the big rip is approached .",
    "this may lead to a back - reaction effect changing the effective equation of state of the universe , implying perhaps the avoidance of the big rip itself : the particle produced does not necessarily obeys the phantom equation of state and may become the dominant component of the universe if @xmath8 .",
    "hence , the back - reaction of the particle production may be an ineluctable mechanism to the avoidance of the big rip if the pressure is not excessively negative .",
    "the limiting case , @xmath9 , has already been found before in a complete different context , that is , in the evolution of classical scalar perturbations in phantom cosmological models @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section we review the formalism of particle creation in a curved space - time . in section",
    "@xmath10 we apply the formalism to a perfect fluid cosmological model , and we determine the rate of particle creation for any value of @xmath1 . in section @xmath11 we present our conclusions .",
    "even if many steps of the formalism used and of the calculation performed are quite well known , we will present them with some details in order to trace the main features of the final results .",
    "in the minkowski spacetime , the lorentz invariance allows to identify a unique vacuum state .",
    "however , in a curved space - time generally the lorentz symmetries are not present . as a consequence",
    ", there is no unique vacuum state , and the particle concept ( as excitation of a vacuum state ) becomes ambiguous .",
    "the nonuncity of the vacuum state is responsible for the mechanism of `` particle production '' , which is due , in some sense , to the fact that different observers define different states as the `` vacuum state '' .",
    "the way this mechanism operates is quite model dependent .",
    "a general way to analyse the problem is to consider a quantum field `` living '' in a given space - time , and to obtain the particle production via the bogolioubov transformation that connects different vacuum states in a given model . in the present work we will consider a free",
    ", massless scalar field `` living '' in a flat friedmann - robertson - walker space - time whose dynamics is determined by a barotropic fluid such that @xmath0 .",

    "the so - called minimal - coupling is obtained when @xmath16 , while the conformal coupling requires @xmath17 .",
    "we work in natural unities such that @xmath18 .",
    "this lagrangian density implies the following equation of motion : @xmath19 the scalar product of a pair of solutions of the klein - gordon equation ( [ em ] ) is defined by : @xmath20^{\\frac{1}{2}}d\\sigma^{\\,\\mu}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 with @xmath22 being the volume element of the spatial - type hypersurface @xmath23 , and where @xmath24 is a timelike unitary vector normal to that hypersurface .",
    "this scalar product is independent of the choice of the hypersurface .",
    "we proceed by quantizing the scalar field in the canonical way .",
    "the conjugate momentum is defined by @xmath25 where the dot means derivation with respect to time .",
    "the field variable and its conjugate momentum satisfy the usual commutation relations : @xmath26&= & 0 \\quad , \\nonumber\\\\ \\label{cr2 } \\left[\\pi(t , x),\\pi(t , x^{\\prime})\\right]&= & 0 \\quad , \\\\",

    "in general the choice of @xmath27 is not unique , and as consequence the notion of a vacuum state is not unique either .",
    "this means that it is not possible to have a universal state describing the absence of particle ; the notion of particle itself becomes ambiguous .",
    "let us consider an asymptotically flat space - time in the past infinity and in the future infinity , but not in the intermediate region .",
    "the positive frequency solutions in the past infinity are denoted by @xmath36 , while the positive frequency solution in the future infinity are denoted by @xmath37 .",
    "these solutions obey the following conditions : @xmath38 the field @xmath12 may be expressed , at same time , in terms of the functions @xmath27 or in terms of the function @xmath39 , since both basis are complete .",
    "hence , @xmath40 the annhilation and creation operators in the past infinity are given by @xmath30 and @xmath31 , while @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the corresponding operators in the future infinity .",

    "using the heisenberg representation , @xmath52 is the state system at each moment . the number operator counting",
    "the number of particles in the future infinity is @xmath53 .",
    "so , the number of particles in the future infinity is given by : @xmath54 a non null @xmath49 implies particle creation .",

    "it has the following asymptotic behaviours : @xmath126    for @xmath60 , @xmath64 implies @xmath127 , while for @xmath62 , @xmath64 implies @xmath128 .",
    "the asymptotic behavior above just show that , for @xmath129 , there is no natural initial vacuum state , except for the radiative case @xmath130 : the initial state is fixed arbitrarily by hand .",
    "that is , an decelerating universe requires a previous accelerated phase in order to establishes a natural vacuum initial state . for @xmath62",
    "there is , in opposition , a natural initial vacuum state , and the particle production is initially zero , becoming infinite asymptotically .    in general , the hubble radius is given by @xmath131 .",
    "the hubble radius increase with time for @xmath132 , remaining constant for @xmath133 , and it decreases for @xmath134 .",
    "hence , in the phantom case , all modes are well inside the hubble radius if we go back far enough in the past , and it is quite reasonable to assume that the initial state is the vacuum state . in figure @xmath135 the behavior of the scale factor , of the hubble radius and of an arbitrary physical model are displayed for a phantom cosmological model , illustrating the situation we have just described .        for the phantom scenario",
    "the future asymptotic occurs in a finite proper time .",
    "hence , the particle production may change the final state ; in particular , it may lead to the avoidance of the big rip .",
    "this may happens since the equation of state of the particles created , for a massless scalar field , is given by @xmath136 , and we can expect that the phantom fluid will not become the dominant component anymore .",
    "in fact , the energy density of perfect fluid scales as @xmath137 .",
    "if we suppose the energy density of the scalar particle created scales according to the rate evaluated above , we have @xmath138 .",
    "so the ratio @xmath139 goes to zero if @xmath140 and to infinity if @xmath141 : the back - reaction can be effective if the equation of state of the phantom fluid is not deeply negative .    the particular case @xmath142 must be studied separately . in terms of the conformal time",

    "note that , in this case , a mode that is initially inside the hubble radius remains always inside it .",
    "we have evaluate the rate of creation of massless scalar particle in a universe dominated by a perfect fluid whose equation of state is given by @xmath0 .",
    "an analytic expression has been found in terms of hankel s functions .",
    "since we have not considered a complete cosmological scenario , with a sequence of different phases , with an initial inflationary phase ( as in standard cosmological model ) , the calculation performed here makes sense , strictly speaking , only when the strong energy condition is violated , that is , @xmath62 .",
    "for such a case , there is a natural initial vacuum state , from which the particle occupation number can be determined .",
    "however , we formally extended the calculation for any value of @xmath1 .",
    "it has been found that for those `` dark energy '' scenarios the rate of particle creation diverges as @xmath153 , that is , in the future infinity .",
    "we have payed special attention to the phantom scenario .",
    "the reason is that a universe dominated by a phantom fluid may develop a singularity in a finite future time , the so - called big rip . in this case",
    ", we have found that it is possible that the energy density associated to the particles created ( which obey in present case an equation of state of the type @xmath154 ) becomes dominant over the phantom fluid if @xmath155 .",
    "hence , the big rip can be avoided if the pressure is not deeply negative .",
    "it is interesting to remark that a similar critical point , @xmath156 , has been found in the case of classical scalar perturbation @xcite . in that case , however , the evolution of scalar perturbation may destroy the conditions of homogeneity ( necessary for the big rip ) if @xmath141 , that is , if the pressure is negative enough .",
    "the result found here is exactly the opposite : quantum effects can be operative in the sense of destroying the conditions for the big rip if the pressure is not negative enough .",
    "it must be stressed , however , that the evaluation made in the present work must be complemented by a study of more general quantum fields and by a deeper thermodynamical analysis of the energy balance between the phantom fluid and the created particles as the big rip is approached .",
