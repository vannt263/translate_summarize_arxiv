    "= 2.5 in    most bright x - ray transients lasting days or weeks come from two kinds of systems : black hole binaries with a low - mass companion ( x - ray novae ) and neutron star binaries with a high - mass , be - type companion ( be / ns ) . in the latter systems ,",
    "the neutron star is in a relatively wide , often eccentric orbit , and the outburst occurs at the orbital phase when the neutron star passes through the dense equatorial wind of the be star , accreting wind material .",
    "these systems can be distinguished from each other and from rarer kinds of transients by neutron star pulsations ( if present ) , by optical observations of the companion ( if available ) , by regularity of recurrence ( which indicates a be / ns binary ) , by a weak secondary outburst peak ( which is a signature of an x - ray nova ) , or by their x - ray spectra ( see sections 5 and 6 ) .",
    "we report a new x - ray transient in the galactic center region .",
    "this source , , was discovered in an observation of the black hole candidate  with the proportional counter array ( pca ) on the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) .",
    "the transient was initially reported in an iau circular ( smith et al .",
    "1997a ) , with a corrected position reported later ( smith 1997 ) , unfortunately after radio observations of the original field ( hjellming 1997 ) .",
    "_    = 3.0 in    on 12 august 1997 at 16:58 ut , the pca scanned its 1  fwhm field of toward a weekly observing position near , approaching almost exactly along a line of constant right ascension .",
    "the count rate , instead of rising smoothly from the background level as  entered the field of view , instead rose much higher just before the end of the scan , came back down , and leveled off at a rate over twice that expected for  after background subtraction ( figure 1 ) .",
    "this indicated a bright source positioned just before  in the scan direction , but still within the field of view of the pca once it came to rest .",
    "= 5.5 in    two days later , on 14 august 1997 , another scan passed within 0.55of , but no peak was seen .",
    "this sets a 3@xmath3 flux upper limit of about 4% of the flux on 12 august at 16:58 ut .",
    "the limit for 3 august can be derived from figure 1 : the rms variation from week to week in the observed flux from  ( not counting the 12 august data point ) is 8 counts / s .",
    "since the 3 august observation is , in fact , lower than average , the upper limit for  on this day is even stricter than the 3@xmath3 variation of 24 c / s , or 14% of the 12 august flux of .",
    "data from the wide field camera on _ beppo sax show no detection of the source on 6 september , with an upper limit of 20 mcrab from 2 to 10 kev , roughly 30% of the outburst flux .",
    "a single scan allows good determination of source position along the scan direction , but not in the perpendicular direction .",
    "fortunately , another _ rxte investigation ( by f. marshall and collaborators ) had scanned along the galactic plane at a galactic latitude of 0.25  earlier the same day ( 14:25 ut ) .",
    "figure 2 shows the two scans , the positions of some well - known x - ray sources , and the position we eventually fit for the new source .",
    "figure 3 shows the count rates during each scan .",
    "together , the two scans provide a good localization",
    ". _    to find the position , we set up a grid of candidate positions spaced 0.01  apart .",
    "for each candidate position , we used the standard pca data analysis tool `` pcaclrsp '' to find the collimator response versus time for each scan . the same tool was used to find the response to .",
    "since the galactic plane emission is more complicated , we used a different approximation for each scan . for the scan along right ascension , we modeled the galactic plane emission as decaying exponentially in galactic latitude with an adjustable scale height ( yamasaki et al .",
    "1996 ) . for the scan along galactic longitude",
    ", we are only concerned with the excess at the galactic center compared to the rest of the plane emission ( yamauchi et al .",
    "we modeled this as a gaussian with an adjustable fwhm .    for each scan",
    ", we fit the data with the sum of a constant background ( a good approximation ) and multiples of the model lightcurves for , the galactic emission , and the new source .",
    "this gave four normalization parameters for each scan . by fitting these",
    "separately , we allowed the sources to vary in intensity between the two scans without affecting the final result .",
    "although the galactic diffuse emission is not variable , it also had to be fit separately because it was treated differently for the two scan directions . repeating this process for each point on the grid of candidate positions , we found the best - fit position for the new source to be right ascension @xmath4 , declination @xmath5  16.2 ( j2000 ) .",
    "the 99% statistical confidence interval for this fit is an oval with radii 1.5 arcmin in right ascension and 2.2 arcmin in declination ( both in true minutes of arc , and calculated assuming two parameters of interest ) .",
    "there are , however , two sources of systematic error : the modeling of the diffuse emission , and intensity fluctuations in the source .",
    "= 2.5 in    as modeled , the fwhm of the galactic center gaussian was 1  and the scale height of the galactic plane exponential was 3 .",
    "the best - fit position of  is very insensitive to these parameters , and varies by less than 1 arcmin even as the gaussian width varies from 0  to 2  and the exponential scale height varies from 1  to 5 .    because the source shows low - frequency noise ( see below ) , a fluctuation of the same timescale as the scan across the source could distort its apparent position . to estimate the size of this effect",
    ", we used the relatively long ( 1300 s ) stretch of data after the scan to  had reached its observing position ( see figure 4 ) to represent the likely `` population '' of fluctuations .",
    "this lightcurve was smoothed to eliminate the high - frequency ( mostly statistical ) noise , and sampled at random positions to provide percentage fluctuations which could be introduced to each of the two short stretches of scan data .",
    "this process was repeated many times to get a distribution of best fit positions .",
    "the contour which encloses 99% of these trials has radii 4.5 arcmin in right ascension and 4.2 arcmin in declination , showing that this is the dominant source of uncertainty .",
    "adding in quadrature the three contributions from statistics , modeling , and fluctuations , we find an overall 99% confidence contour which is almost perfectly circular , with a radius of 4.8 arcmin .",
    "the luminosity of  is also obtained from the fits for each scan . for the scan at 16:58 ut",
    ", the counting rate at the peak of the collimator response to  is 600 c / s using three of the five detectors of the pca ( the other two were not turned on until the scan ended ) . for the best fit position , this represents a collimator response of 91% , thus the pca count rate for all five detectors pointed directly at the source",
    "would have been 1100 c / s . during the galactic plane scan only 2.55 hours earlier ,",
    "the flux was only 56% of this value .",
    "we can not know if we caught the source turning on or if it had large - amplitude variations during a longer active period .    assuming a thermal bremsstrahlung spectrum ( see below ) , the x - ray flux from 2.5 to 25 kev is @xmath0 ergs @xmath1s@xmath2 . removing the effect of the absorption column ,",
    "this becomes @xmath6ergs @xmath1s@xmath2 , or @xmath7ergs @xmath1s@xmath2 from 2 to 10 kev and @xmath8ergs @xmath1s@xmath2 from 2 to 100 kev .",
    "both the position and absorption column ( see below ) support a location near the galactic center , so assuming a distance of 8.5 kpc , the 2 to 100 kev luminosity is @xmath9ergs s@xmath2 .",
    "= 3.0 in    figure 4 shows the lightcurve of the 12 august  observation once the scan ended , with the 20 august observation shown for comparison .",
    "it is apparent that the source contributing the additional flux has significant low - frequency noise .",
    "figure 5 shows the 12 august power spectrum along with a fit to the power spectrum from a long observation of  alone ( smith et al .",
    "the total rms variability of , removing the effects of poisson statistics and the usual variability of , is 13% , integrated from 0.003 to 10 hz .",
    "we have examined the power spectrum with fine frequency resolution from 0.01 to 1000 hz and find no statistically significant periodicities or qpos .",
    "we can exclude with at least 99% confidence pulsations with an amplitude above 2% for any period shorter than 300 s.",
    "= 3.3 in    we were able to remove the spectral contributions from galactic diffuse emission and  with high confidence by subtracting a spectrum constructed from six of the pointings shown in figure 1 , three before and three after the 12 august event .",
    "both the intensity and spectral shape of  have been quite stable over the last two years .    despite the lack of pulsation , the energy spectrum of  is well fit by the models which have been historically used for x - ray pulsars .",
    "the one most commonly used ( e.g. white , swank & holt 1983 ) has been a power law with energy index @xmath10 and an exponential cutoff ( i.e. @xmath11 $ ] ph @xmath1 s @xmath2 above @xmath12 and just the power law below @xmath12 ) .",
    "we find @xmath13 ( i.e. a photon index of @xmath14 ) , @xmath15 kev , and @xmath16 kev . the very low reduced @xmath17 ( 0.78 ) indicates that five parameters may not be needed .",
    "figure 6 shows the count spectrum from 2.5 to 25 kev and an optically thin thermal bremsstrahlung ( ottb ) model from xspec ( arnaud 1996 ) which has only three parameters ( temperature , normalization , and absorption column ) .",
    "the xspec model is taken from kellogg , baldwin & koch ( 1975 ) .",
    "the fit is very good ( @xmath18 = 1.075 for 49 degrees of freedom ) .",
    "the fit temperature is ( 21.6 @xmath19 0.8 ) kev .",
    "a common approximation to a bremsstrahlung spectrum at high energies is @xmath20 $ ] .",
    "this also fits well ( @xmath18 = 1.054 ) , giving @xmath21(12.4 @xmath19 0.3 ) kev .",
    "each model included an absorption column ; the values were ( 5.3 @xmath19 0.7 ) , ( 6.2 @xmath19 0.2 ) and ( 5.1 @xmath19 0.2 ) @xmath22 , respectively , consistent with the position near the galactic center .",
    "other spectral forms can be excluded .",
    "a power law is a poor fit ( @xmath18 = 2.347 ) , as is a multicolored disk model ( @xmath18 = 3.072 ) .",
    "we also tried the sum of these two , as representative of a typical black hole spectrum .",
    "the fit is good ( @xmath18 = 0.674 ) , but this is to be expected when using a five - parameter model for a spectrum which was fit well by a three - parameter model ( ottb ) .",
    "the resulting parameters are not typical of black hole candidates : the power law photon index ( 1.0 ) and disk blackbody temperature ( 3.3 kev ) are both harder than any ever seen .",
    "we therefore do not consider this fit physically meaningful .",
    "most bright galactic x - ray transients are either black hole candidates or binaries consisting of a be star and a neutron star ( be / ns ) .",
    "we tentatively identify  as a be / ns binary because its spectral shape is similar to that of these systems : a gradual steepening over the 2 to 25 kev range . in this energy range ,",
    "the black hole candidates show either two distinct components ( a very soft thermal component and a power law ) or else a single , very hard power law . our parameters for the cutoff - power - law model of the  spectrum fall within the ranges of the x - ray pulsars listed in white et al .",
    "( 1983 ) , which include be / ns binaries .",
    "our temperature for the exponential approximation to a bremsstrahlung spectrum ( 12.4 kev ) is near the low end of the ranges of gs  0834 - 430 ( 12 - 18 kev ; wilson et al .",
    "1997 ) and a0525 + 262 ( 14 to 22 kev ; finger , wilson & harmon 1996 ) measured with batse . as noted above",
    ", spectral forms typical of black hole candidates were either poor fits or gave parameters far from the usual range .    with the ottb model used in section 5 ,",
    "the luminosity from 20 to 50 kev @xmath23ergs s@xmath2 , about 1/4 of the 2 to 100 kev luminosity ) is at the high end of the expected range for a `` giant '' outburst of a be / ns binary ( bildsten et al .",
    "the short duration ( @xmath24 11 days ) would be not be typical for a giant outburst ( bildsten et al .",
    "1997 ) , although one giant outburst of a0535 + 262 was only 18 days long ( sembay et al .",
    "1990 ) . with no detected pulsations and such a short sample of data",
    ", we ca nt distinguish between a normal and giant outburst by spin - up rate .",
    "if we caught the source turning on , then at @xmath25 days it is not similar to any common class of transient , although the lightcurve is consistent with that recently observed from xte j0421 + 560 = ci cam ( smith et al .",
    "1998 ) . that bright transient showed a fast rise over hours followed by an exponential decay with a time constant on the order of a day ( quick - look results provided by the asm/_rxte team )",
    "otherwise , it behaved very differently from , showing a bright fe - k line and no time variability besides its smooth decay ( belloni et al . 1998 ) .",
    "what the events have in common is that they underscore the need for very frequent monitoring and very fast response in the study of galactic x - ray transients . _",
    "if we are correct in the spectral identification of  as a be / ns binary , the pulse period may simply have been too long ( @xmath26 300 s ) to be seen in our short ( 1300 s ) stretch of data , but the lack of detection could also be due to a very low pulsed fraction .",
    "a pulsed fraction of only 4 to 6% rms was seen in x0331 + 53 (= v0332 + 53 = bq cam ) along with flat - topped noise with a total rms of 25% from 0.01 to 1 hz ( makishima et al . 1990 ) .",
    "our power spectrum is similar to that of the a0535 + 262 outburst of 1980 october with its pulsed component removed ( frontera et al .",
    "although that power spectrum had a broad peak around 0.05 hz detected with more significance than the similar feature in our spectrum ( see figure 5 ) , the authors interpreted it as due to imperfect subtraction of the pulsation , so the coincidence should be viewed cautiously . like ours , their power spectrum showed significant low - frequency noise below 0.02 hz and little power above 0.1 hz .",
    "our best hope to learn more about this object is to catch a subsequent outburst with a longer exposure and multiple instruments .",
    "if it is a be / ns binary , its unusually brief and luminous outburst makes particularly interesting .",
    "we encourage anyone with access to appropriate archival data to look for the august 1997 outburst and any earlier ones , particularly to search for pulsar periods longer than 300 s. we also encourage anyone with new galactic center data to look at it promptly and call for target of opportunity observations from the various high - energy observatories during any subsequent outburst of this object .",
    "the authors would like to thank the _ rxte guest observer facility for their continuing assistance , and r. hjellming for his prompt response in scheduling radio observations of the originally reported position .",
