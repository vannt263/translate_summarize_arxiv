    "in the domain of wave or quantum chaos @xcite , open systems are currently actively investigated both from experimental and theoretical points of view ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for recent reviews ) .",
    "openness may be due to various physical mechanisms such as bulk absorption , coupling to the environment through physical channels as well as dissipative or radiative boundary conditions . whatever the mechanism , openness results in spectral broadening ranging from the perturbative regime of non - overlapping ( isolated ) resonances to the so - called ericsson regime of strong overlap .",
    "these mechanisms and their related spectral effects have been experimentally studied in various context : in microwave cavities @xcite , in optical microcavities @xcite , and in elastodynamics @xcite .",
    "the most salient feature of open systems is the set of resonances which are quasibound states embedded in the continuum .",
    "a natural way to address them analytically is via the energy - dependent scattering matrix , @xmath0 .",
    "following the heidelberg approach @xcite , the poles ( i.e. , resonances ) of the @xmath1 matrix turn out to be the complex eigenvalues of an effective non - hermitian hamiltonian @xmath2 , whereas the bi - orthogonal eigenvectors of the latter determine the corresponding resonance states ( quasimodes ) .",
    "universal properties of resonance scattering in the chaotic regime can then be analyzed by applying random matrix theory ( rmt ) that amounts to replacing the actual non - hermitian hamiltonian with an rmt ensemble of the appropriate symmetry class @xcite .",
    "the main advantage of such an approach is that it treats on equal footing both the spectral and scattering characteristics of open chaotic systems as well as that it is flexible enough to incorporate other imperfections of the system , e.g. , disorder and losses @xcite .    by now , complex eigenvalues of such non - hermitian random matrices",
    "have been studied quite systematically @xcite . however , the statistical properties of the corresponding ( left and right ) eigenvectors are less understood .",
    "quite a substantial progress in this direction has been achieved by schomerus _",
    "@xcite , who studied mainly the systems with broken time - reversal symmetry .",
    "other analytical results for a few physically interesting particular cases have also been reported in the literature recently @xcite .",
    "components of eigenvectors appear as residues of the @xmath1 matrix at resonance positions and the understanding of their properties is thus important for many applications .",
    "for example , nonorthogonality of resonance eigenstates yields the enhancement ( the so - called petermann factor ) of the line width of a lasing mode in open resonators @xcite and influences branching ratios of nuclear cross - sections @xcite .",
    "it features also in the particle escape from the scattering region @xcite as well as in dissipative quantum chaotic maps @xcite .",
    "this paper focuses on spectral and eigenvector statistics of such non - hermitian random matrices describing effective hamiltonians of open chaotic wave systems whose closed limit displays time - reversal symmetry ( trs ) . in this case",
    ", the quasimodes correspond to the complex - valued eigenvectors of @xmath2 . to characterize this complexness ,",
    "it is convenient to introduce @xcite the ratio of the variances of the imaginary and real parts of the eigenvector as a single statistical parameter , hereafter called the complexness parameter @xcite .",
    "one should note that this parameter is characteristic of the degree of non - orthogonality of the complex modes and , therefore , is closely connected to the petermann factor mentioned above @xcite .",
    "other studies have considered the phase rigidity , another related parameter , introduced to characterize the degree to which a general scattering wave function is complex @xcite .",
    "both parameters are straightforwardly deduced from one another when the phase rigidity is calculated for a single eigenvector .",
    "the main advantage of considering the complexness parameter is to reveal a physical connection between spatial and spectral statistics @xcite .",
    "in what follows , we study the probability distribution of the complexness parameter for a generic weakly open chaotic system and its connection with the distribution of resonance widths within the rmt approach . at the first stage",
    ", we derive an expression for the complexness parameter in the weak coupling regime and establish a general relation between its average and width fluctuations . then accounting for the essential statistical feature of spectra in chaotic systems , namely , spectral rigidity",
    ", we investigate the case of a system whose closed limit is described by a pure picket - fence spectrum .",
    "an exact analytic prediction for the probability distribution of the complexness parameter is derived , depending on only two parameters : the number of open scattering channels and the mean resonance width . finally , we consider the more realistic case of systems modeled by the gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) .",
    "we derive an analytic expression for the probability distribution of the complexness parameter in this case and discuss the effect of spectral fluctuations .",
    "open wave systems are commonly described using the so - called projection formalism @xcite . the exterior coupling is modeled by @xmath3 scattering channels connected to @xmath4 levels of a closed system .",
    "the coupling to the environment turns modes , with a infinite life time , into resonances , with a finite life time .",
    "being initially introduced in nuclear physics , this formalism has been later applied successfully to wave billiards @xcite for which antennas and absorption can be described by scattering channels @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "the resonance part of the @xmath1-matrix is given by : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the coupling matrix of size @xmath7 , the elements @xmath8 of this matrix couple the @xmath9-th level to the @xmath10-th scattering channel .",
    "the poles of @xmath1 are given by the eigenvalues of @xmath2 .",
    "assuming an independence of the coupling elements from the energy and neglecting direct processes @xcite , the effective hamiltonian of the open systems is represented as follows : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the hamiltonian of the closed system and the anti - hermitian part @xmath13 describes coupling to the channels . in the case of the systems with preserved trs",
    "considered below , @xmath12 is a real symmetric matrix of size @xmath14 and @xmath6 is also real . as usual",
    ", the limit @xmath15 is to be finally taken .",
    "since @xmath2 is a non - hermitian operator , the eigenvalue problems @xmath16 and @xmath17 define two sets of a priori independent eigenvectors , called right @xmath18 and left @xmath19 eigenvectors associated to the same set of eigenvalues @xmath20 .",
    "these eigenvectors form a bi - orthogonal set which satisfies conditions of orthogonality , @xmath21 , and completeness , @xmath22 . making use of the right eigenvectors ,",
    "the diagonalization of @xmath2 then reads : @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are , respectively , the energy and the width of the @xmath9-th resonance . due to trs present , @xmath2 is a complex symmetric matrix ; hence , the left and right eigenvectors are related by the transpose , @xmath26 @xcite .    the coupling to continuum , as described by the imaginary part of @xmath2 , turns real eigenfunctions of the closed system into complex quasimodes of its open counterpart .",
    "in order to measure their complexness , we define the complexness parameter @xmath27 as follows : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the @xmath30-th component of the eigenvector ( we note that the complexness parameter can be equivalently defined by means of the left eigenvectors ) .",
    "it is worth noting here that in contrast to the related petermann factor @xcite , which is defined for a fixed value of the given resonance width , no additional constraints are imposed on ( [ qdef ] ) . in chaotic systems",
    ", @xmath27 reveals strong mode - to - mode fluctuations , which we describe through its probability distribution function to be derived below .      within the rmt approach , the universal statistical properties of closed",
    "chaotic systems with preserved trs are described by goe @xcite . in this ensemble the joint probability distribution , @xmath31 , of the levels ( the eigenvalues of @xmath12 ) is induced by a gaussian distribution of the random real symmetric @xmath12 with zero mean .",
    "the exact expression for @xmath31 is well known to have the following form : @xmath32 here , we have chosen the variance of @xmath12 such that it yields the mean level spacing @xmath33 at the spectrum center , @xmath34 .    the energy levels , as defined by eq .",
    "( [ jpd ] ) , exhibit a linear level repulsion . as a result",
    ", the energy spectrum displays spectral rigidity which restrains the spectral fluctuations around the mean .",
    "this important feature can approximately be taken into account within the so - called picket - fence model of equidistantly spaced levels @xcite .",
    "the usefulness of this model is in its simplicity that allows one to treat various resonance phenomena analytically , see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite . here",
    ", we employ this model to single out a contribution to @xmath27 due to fluctuations of the resonance widths .    as concerns the coupling amplitudes ,",
    "the results are known to be model independent on statistical assumptions on @xmath8 as long as the number of open channels is small compared to that of the levels @xcite .",
    "the coupling amplitudes may be equivalently chosen as fixed @xcite or random @xcite . in order to preserve orthogonal invariance of @xmath2 under ( complex ) orthogonal transformations @xcite",
    ", we consider the @xmath8 s as real gaussian random variables with zero mean and @xmath35 henceforth , @xmath36 stands for the statistical averaging over the ensembles .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath37 determines a transmission coefficient @xmath38 of the channels ( assumed to be statistically equivalent ) .",
    "the cases of @xmath39 or @xmath40 correspond , respectively , to weak or perfect coupling . in the weak coupling regime",
    "considered below , @xmath41 , all the resonances are almost isolated and @xmath42 .",
    "we now derive an expression for the complexness parameter of the eigenvectors for weakly overlapping resonances .",
    "the matrix representation of @xmath2 in an arbitrary basis @xmath43 of the hilbert space spanned by eigenvectors of @xmath12 reads : @xmath44 as we focus on the weak coupling regime , the imaginary part may be viewed as a perturbation of the hamiltonian of the closed system .",
    "the repulsion of the energy levels exhibited by the systems under investigation allows us to consider the eigenenergies of @xmath12 as nondegenerate .",
    "one can therefore apply first - order perturbation theory to obtain from ( [ eig ] ) the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors of @xmath2 straightforwardly .",
    "the eigenvalues read @xmath45 , where the @xmath24 s are the eigenvalues of @xmath12 and the widths @xmath25 are given by : @xmath46 the perturbed eigenvectors of @xmath2 written in the eigenbasis @xmath47 of @xmath12 are easily found as follows : @xmath48 splitting then the real and imaginary parts of @xmath49 , the complexness parameter ( [ qdef ] ) of a given eigenvector reads @xmath50 where we have introduced @xmath51 .",
    "these quantities are responsible for the coupling and interference of the resonance states due to the common decay channels @xcite .",
    "in what follows , we study the statistical properties of the complexness parameter ( [ q2def ] ) for @xmath12 being described by a picket - fence or belonging to goe .",
    "it is worth noting here that expression ( [ q2def ] ) is a sum of correlated random variables which , therefore , does not obey the standard central limit theorem .",
    "statistics of a similar kind of objects appears , e.g. , in the study of the parametric level dynamics ( `` curvature '' ) @xcite and in the context of interference effects in neutron scattering from compound nucleus @xcite .",
    "the complexness factor ( [ q2def ] ) contains two contributions of distinct types , one is due to the internal levels and the other is due to the coupling matrix elements @xmath52 . from a statistical point of view , these two are statistically independent of one another .",
    "we note , however , that the levels @xmath24 are mutually correlated .",
    "the quantities @xmath52 s , unlike the original amplitudes @xmath8 , are also not statistically independent .",
    "although their joint distribution can be found from ( [ v ] ) , the resulting expression is quite complicated @xcite , being of little practical use for actual calculations in the present context .    to overcome the difficulty of averaging over the coupling amplitudes , we follow sokolov and zelevinsky @xcite and treat an arbitrary matrix element @xmath52 as a scalar products between @xmath3-dimensional vectors @xmath53 and @xmath54 of the coupling amplitudes @xmath55 associated with the levels @xmath56 and @xmath57",
    "this suggests a natural parametrization for @xmath52 in terms of the angles @xmath58 between the pairs of these @xmath4 vectors , @xmath59 the main advantage of this representation is that the angles @xmath58 are mutually independent and also independent of @xmath25 .",
    "the probability distribution of any angle ( for @xmath60 ) can be easily found to be given by the expression for a solid angle in an @xmath3-dimensional space @xcite : @xmath61 note that @xmath62 at @xmath63 . as concerns the lengths of these vectors , i.e. , the widths ( [ gam ] ) , these are well - known to be independent and @xmath64 distributed according to @xmath65 henceforth @xmath66 stands for the dimensionless widths .",
    "this distribution function has the mean value @xmath67 and the variance @xmath68 thus the widths cease to fluctuate as the number of open channels grows , with the average width being kept fixed .",
    "it is now convenient to express all the quantities in their natural units and to consider a rescaled complexness parameter @xmath69 defined as follows : @xmath70 where we have introduced the following quantities @xmath71 @xmath72 may be given a geometrical interpretation as ( a square of ) the projection of the vector @xmath73 along the direction given by the vector @xmath53 .",
    "these projections are statistically independent , as is obvious from the above discussion .",
    "the probability distribution of any projection follows readily from eqs .",
    "( [ pt ] ) and ( [ pg ] ) . performing an integration first over @xmath74 and then over @xmath75 in the definition @xmath76",
    ", one finds @xmath77 thus , surprisingly , the distribution of @xmath72 is independent of @xmath3 , being given by the porter - thomas law at any @xmath78 .",
    "a general expression of the average value of the complexness parameter @xmath79 can be readily found from eq .",
    "( [ x ] ) by making use of the mutual statistical independence between the widths @xmath80 , the projections @xmath81 and the levels @xmath82 .",
    "noting that @xmath67 and @xmath83 , one obtains @xmath84 where the factor @xmath85 depends on the statistical properties of the energies of the closed system only , @xmath86    it is important to note that , generally , the nonzero values of the complexness parameter are solely due to fluctuations of the resonance widths .",
    "indeed , in the extreme case of all the widths being equal , the anti - hermitian part of @xmath2 gets proportional to the unit matrix and , as a result , the complex ( biorthogonal ) eigenvectors become essentially real @xcite .",
    "it is , therefore , instructive to take this explicitly into account and , in view of relation ( [ gmg2 m ] ) , bring eq .",
    "( [ xav ] ) to the form : @xmath87 this expression relates the average complexness parameter to the natural measure of the width fluctuations , its variance .",
    "strong correlations between the complexness parameter and the spectral widths are already known .",
    "the proportionality between @xmath88 and the average value of the fluctuating part of damping was recently found experimentally in a chaotic microwave billiard at room temperature , where this was also explained heuristically using a ray picture based on the ergodic character of the wave system @xcite .",
    "then this proportionality was established in @xcite using a two - level rmt model and considering @xmath89 that was relevant for this experiment . expression ( [ xvar ] ) readily provides this feature , in view of @xmath90 , at any @xmath4 and @xmath3 . on the other side , it captures fluctuation properties of the widths properly , e.g. , yielding the vanishing @xmath91 in the absorptive limit of many weakly coupled channels with the average total width kept fixed , due to the vanishing variance ( [ gmg2 m ] ) .",
    "therefore , we believe that relation ( [ xvar ] ) is a general feature of weakly open chaotic systems with non - degenerate spectrum in the perturbative regime .",
