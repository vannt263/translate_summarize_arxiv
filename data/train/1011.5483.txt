    "due to their remarkable properties @xcite , rydberg atoms emerge as a versatile tool in ultra - cold atomic physics .",
    "they can be used for diverse topics , such as quantum information , atomic aggregates @xcite , the study of conical intersections @xcite , digital quantum simulations @xcite , electro - magnetically induced transparency @xcite , coherent population trapping @xcite , giant kerr non - linearities @xcite and ultra - long range molecules @xcite , since their long range interactions can be tuned over many orders of magnitude .",
    "however excited atoms in rydberg orbitals are more vulnerable to ionisation @xcite or spontaneous decay and more difficult to trap @xcite .",
    "recently , several groups proposed to combine the advantages of both , ground - state and rydberg atoms , through `` rydberg - dressing '' schemes @xcite .",
    "the core idea is to use off - resonant laser coupling between ground- and rydberg states to create eigenstates of the laser - coupled system in which a small rydberg component is admixed to the ground - state .",
    "these resulting _ dressed _ states inherit some of the extreme properties of the rydberg states , while preserving favourable properties of the ground state .",
    "moreover , the additional degrees of freedom provided by laser rabi - frequency and detuning increase flexibility and promise potential shaping as well as dynamical control .",
    "dressing has been extensively studied for van der waals ( vdw ) interactions , generated when virtual transitions between levels of a two - atom system yield a distance dependent energy shift .",
    "several articles have proposed rydberg dressing techniques to induce this kind of interactions for ground - state atoms @xcite . in this context",
    "it was shown that dressing ground - state atoms with rydberg levels allows the large rydberg vdw interaction energies to be reduced until comparable to typical energy scales of cold - atom traps , while simultaneously increasing ensemble life - times to those required for thermal equilibration effects @xcite .",
    "these are helpful features e.g. , for realising a supersolid phase in rydberg - dressed bose - einstein condensates @xcite .    here",
    ", we demonstrate that the ideas behind dressing rydberg vdw interactions can also be applied to resonant dipole - dipole interactions of neutral atoms .",
    "they occur when transitions between different states of the two - atom system are energetically resonant . in this case",
    ", the existence of an interaction potential is linked to electronic state transfer between atoms @xcite .",
    "dressing dipole - dipole interactions requires the use of two laser couplings and four electronic states ( two ground- and two rydberg - states ) , in contrast to one coupling and two states that suffice for vdw dressing . hence , the scheme is more involved but also more flexible , offering a larger number of dressed states .",
    "it ultimately allows coherent quantum state transport between atoms in different long - lived ground - states over distances of @xmath0-@xmath1 @xmath2 m and for durations of many milli - seconds .",
    "similar ideas have previously been applied to trapped rydberg _",
    "ions _ @xcite . however , we are motivated by the possibility to generate potentials in an atomic many - body system that induce different kinds of ( coupled ) electronic and atomic _ motion _ dependent on the overall quantum state of the system . useful applications of such potentials can be found in @xcite . in many systems",
    "this goal is easier to achieve with neutral atoms than with ions , since the motion of the latter is typically dominated by their coulomb repulsion or the indispensable trap .",
    "furthermore the mapping of state - transfer interactions to normally non - interacting ground states by the laser dressing can be presented more clearly in the atomic case , where complications by trapping , mixing of internal and external dynamics and additional laser induced interactions can be ignored at least for free atoms .",
    "finally , see ref .",
    "@xcite for dressing techniques targeting the control of atomic motion without linked excitation transport .",
    "our results provide an additional handle on the time - scale of excitation transport and life - times , enable time - dependent control over hopping - strengths and can be used to vary the order of magnitude of dipole - dipole forces . within some constraints @xcite",
    ", the dressing also enables the use of well established trapping methods .",
    "as recently shown , dressed dipole - dipole interactions are an important tool for the realisation of atomic ring trimers @xcite . in particular , the confinement of long - range interacting atoms on a ring , as required in ref .",
    "@xcite , is greatly facilitated by the techniques presented here .",
    "atomic ring trimers allow the detailed study of wave - function dynamics near and across conical - intersections .",
    "dressed dipole - dipole interactions may also prove useful for the study of exciton dynamics in rydberg chains @xcite .    to demonstrate dressed dipole - dipole interactions , we employ numerical simulations of a model with four essential states per atom . in this case",
    "there are several dressed state manifolds , distinguished by the number of excited rydberg atoms which they contain in the limit of vanishing dressing .",
    "we apply van - vleck perturbation theory to obtain analytical expressions for the induced effective interaction and to determine the parameter range within which the scheme can function .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in we present the atomic states considered , describe the resulting hamiltonian and outline the basic principles of the dressing scheme .",
    "in we consider an atomic dimer in detail , providing analytical expressions for the effective dressed interactions , diagonalising the full hamiltonian and discussing different available dressing manifolds . in",
    "we present two exemplary applications of our results , dressed ring trimers and exciton migration .",
    "we conclude in and discuss technical details of our calculations and the underlying atomic physics in the subsequent appendices .",
    "we consider a collection of @xmath3 alkali atoms , where the @xmath4th atom is located at the position @xmath5 .",
    "the distances between the atoms , @xmath6 , shall be so large that interaction between two atoms can be neglected unless _ both _ of them are in a rydberg state . in this case",
    "they experience strong dipole - dipole interactions .",
    "as discussed in @xcite the dipole - dipole interaction leads to exciton dynamics similar to that of molecular dye aggregates , molecular crystals or light harvesting systems @xcite .    for practical reasons we restrict ourselves to situations where",
    "the dynamics can be adequately described using only two `` ground '' states and two rydberg states per atom . with the term `` ground - states ''",
    "we refer e.g. , to two different hyperfine levels of the actual alkali - atom ground state .",
    "we shall denote the ground states by @xmath7 and @xmath8 and the rydberg states by @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the latter correspond to the @xmath11 and @xmath12 angular momentum components of a rydberg level with large principal quantum number  @xmath13 .",
    "schematically , the resonant dipole - dipole interaction @xmath14 leads to a coupling between states @xmath15 and @xmath16 , whose matrix elements in the hamiltonian take the form @xmath17 .",
    "the transition strength is @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the inter - atomic distance and @xmath2 quantifies the transition dipole moment between the states @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "we assume that all atoms are prepared in the @xmath20 azimuthal quantum states and never acquire @xmath21 . with atoms constrained in a two - dimensional ( 2d ) plane , orthogonal to the quantisation axis",
    ", this ensures that there is no angular dependence of @xmath14  @xcite .",
    "such a geometry covers both scenarios described later in this article .",
    "the interaction between atoms @xmath22 and @xmath23 reads @xmath24 to map the strong interactions @xmath25 to the ground states , the atoms are irradiated with far - detuned dressing laser - fields that couple the ground - states and our two selected rydberg states coherently .",
    "the relevant level diagram is sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : sketch ]  ( a ) .",
    "in practice such a coupling is commonly achieved by two ( or multi)-photon transitions @xcite , so that the rabi - frequencies @xmath26 and detunings @xmath27 in the diagram have to be regarded as effective quantities . from the laser transition parameters , we assemble the effective dimensionless dressing parameters @xmath28 they are a measure of how `` far - detuned '' the laser coupling is , and will emerge as crucial quantities controlling the dressing , as it is the case for dressed vdw interactions @xcite .",
    "it is important that the state @xmath7 is directly coupled only to @xmath9 and @xmath8 only to @xmath10 . in order for this simple picture with four relevant states per atom to be valid ,",
    "the detunings of both laser couplings have to be chosen such that all other transitions , coupling to further rydberg states or ground state levels , are so far detuned that they can be safely neglected and @xmath29 with uniquely assigned states @xmath30 .",

    "[ fig : sketch ]  ( b ) , van der waals interactions of all four states , spontaneous decay and loss in the excited states .",
    "the latter arises as atoms in rydberg states are lost due to auto - ionization or blackbody radiation @xcite .",
    "importantly , parameter regimes can be found where these corrections are minor and suffices , for example for the states and parameters shown in fig .",

    "if we ignore dipole - dipole interactions for the moment , an adiabatic ramp - up of the dressing strengths @xmath26 will change this eigenstate into one with some admixture of rydberg population . allowing",

    "we consider @xmath31li atoms , whose @xmath55 ground - state has a hyperfine - splitting of @xmath56 mhz @xcite .",
    "for the rydberg state @xmath9 we pick a principal quantum number @xmath57 and angular momentum @xmath11 state . for @xmath10",
    "we choose @xmath57 and @xmath12 .",
    "the energy difference between the two rydberg states is @xmath58 ghz .",
    "we will assume detunings @xmath59 mhz and dressing parameters @xmath60 unless indicated otherwise .",
    "we will occasionally refer to @xmath61 ( without index ) , which implies @xmath62 . for the above values of @xmath61 and @xmath63 , our rabi - frequencies are @xmath64 mhz .",
    "for the most part , we illustrate the dressing scheme through an atomic dimer with @xmath65 @xmath2 m inter - particle separation . for this distance ,",
    "the strength of the bare dipole - dipole interaction is @xmath66  mhz , just less than the doubly excited state detuning @xmath67 mhz .",
    "the reason for this choice will become clear later .    we stress that we have chosen these parameters to be specific , while our findings are more general .",
    "the constraints under which the parameters can be varied without invalidating the dressing scheme have been discussed in .",
    "all following results are expected to hold for any alkali species if these constraints are met .",
    "for the principal demonstration of excitation transport through rydberg dressing , we first treat the simplest possible case , the atomic dimer .      in this section ,",
    "we show dynamics from the initial state @xmath68 .",
    "we consider two different ramps of the dressing couplings @xmath26 in the hamiltonian : ( i ) a sudden jump from zero to their final value and , ( ii ) an adiabatic ramp over a small finite time @xmath69 ms , effectively changing the initial state to @xmath70)/{\\cal n}$ ] , where @xmath71 is a normalisation factor ( see also ) .. , the ramp ought to be slow on the time - scale of the laser - coupling but fast on that of effective dipole - dipole transport .",

    "the suppression of excited state population by a factor @xmath80 is well known from vdw dressing techniques @xcite and a basic feature of off - resonant rabi - coupling . as can be seen in",
    ", there will be many ground state population oscillations up to the expected spontaneous life - time of the dressed @xmath81-atom state , which we estimate to about @xmath82s as described in . due to the dressing ,",
    "the time - scale on which the interaction transports the excitation has been massively increased compared to the `` bare '' population oscillation period between rydberg states @xmath83 , which would be @xmath84ns .",

    "the population of states with a single rydberg excitation never exceeds @xmath80 .",
    "doubly excited states are further suppressed .",
    "however , this careful initial state creation is not actually required in order to observe dressed population oscillations , as we have just seen .",
    "the results of the preceding section already unambiguously demonstrate excitation transport through full numerical solutions of the problem . to further understand the population - oscillations more intuitively",
    ", we now consider the ground - state manifold spanned by @xmath85 , @xmath86 as the _ system _ of interest and its hilbert - space complement as _",
    "environment_. the coupling between the two is treated as a perturbation .",
    "we use van vleck perturbation theory @xcite , as outlined by shavitt _",
    "@xcite to derive an effective hamiltonian in terms of the `` system '' only .",
    "this scheme conveniently takes care of degeneracies and generates an effective hamiltonian well suited to describe excitation transport .",

    "in contrast the perturbative results for @xmath87 are intuitive and generalise straightforwardly to cases with more atoms .",
    "they are also valid over large ranges of parameter space as we shall show below .",
    "the aim of van vleck perturbation theory is to find a basis that block - diagonalises the hamiltonian ( [ hamil_dressed ] ) to a given order in the perturbation @xmath45 . for @xmath88",
    "this is achieved by the basis @xmath32 introduced in , since @xmath44 is already fully diagonal .",
    "the relative importance of @xmath45 and @xmath44 is governed by the dressing parameters @xmath89 . as the @xmath89 increase , the basis that block - diagonalises @xmath43 becomes more complicated .",

    "we shall only be interested in the block of the effective hamiltonian that governs the dynamics of the effective ground - state manifold @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",

    "the light shifts @xmath103 ( @xmath104 ) , corresponding to second ( fourth ) order in @xmath45 , are given by    [ eshifts ] @xmath105 @xmath106    where we have used the dressing parameters defined in . these light shifts could allow optical trapping using the same fields that provide the dressing coupling .",
    "the position dependent part of the hamiltonian , @xmath102 , can be written as @xmath107 with    [ potentials ] @xmath108 @xmath109    where we have defined @xmath110 . as expected the states",

    "@xmath114 is a normalisation factor .",
    "let us briefly mention some special cases : for large inter - atomic separations , such that @xmath115 , we can expand the expressions ( [ potentials ] ) and obtain @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "the shift @xmath118 , which is independent of @xmath19 , can then be merged with @xmath104 . for shorter distances ,",
    "the factors @xmath119 become relevant and diverge at @xmath120 , or equivalently at @xmath121 .",
    "we will see in the next section that this divergence can be traced to avoided crossings between the perturbed energy eigenvalues .",
    "we show in that ( [ potentials ] ) fails only in a fairly narrow region around this avoided crossing .",
    "an interesting special case is @xmath122 . here",
    ", the equations predict that the dressing effect on the ground - state manifold vanishes , which is confirmed by full simulations",
    ". we will however show in that this case has special appeal for dressing within the single excited state manifold .",
    "we also derive the contribution to @xmath123 of @xmath124th order in @xmath45 in [ sixth_order ] .",
    "we will make use of it in , to illustrate the rate of improvement that can be achieved through higher - order terms of perturbation theory .      to get an overview of the consequences of dressing radiation beyond the ground state manifold , we now consider the full energy spectrum of the dimer as a function of inter - atomic separation .",
    "as we outline in [ multi_exc ] , the dimer hamiltonian can be brought into block - diagonal form , with three blocks describing exciton numbers of @xmath125 . of these ,",
    "only the single exciton block is non - trivial , hence we only show the eigenspectrum of its corresponding sub - matrix @xmath126 ( [ hamiltonian_mainblock ] ) here .",
    "explicitly we solve @xmath127 besides providing information on the possibilities of dressed excitation transport , the energy eigenvalues as a function of separation can also be viewed as adiabatic ( born - oppenheimer ) potential surfaces for motion of the atoms , as long as this motion is sufficiently slow @xcite .    the @xmath19-dependent energy eigenvalues are shown in for @xmath128  mhz and @xmath129  mhz , with other parameters as described in .",
    "the slight offset between @xmath130 and @xmath131 makes it easier to grasp the structure of the resulting spectrum . at large distances",
    "@xmath19 and for moderate dressing strength @xmath61 , the eigenstates are essentially superpositions of two basis states , and have odd or even symmetry under exchange of atoms @xmath132 and @xmath81 .",
    "these superpositions are listed in the caption of fig .",
    "[ spectrum_deltaeq ]  ( a ) , disregarding normalisation .",
    "their energies are then mostly determined by the total detuning of the two superimposed basis states .",
    "as the distance @xmath19 is reduced , the dipole - dipole interaction energy of the states consisting mainly of two rydberg atoms ( blue dotted- and red solid lines ) becomes more prominent and eventually leads to avoided crossings between these and the other states of the spectrum . on the large energy scale of fig .",
    "[ spectrum_deltaeq ]  ( a ) , @xmath133 , the dipole - dipole shift of the @xmath134 states is most prominent .",
    "however also the other states with only a small doubly excited state component acquire a space dependent dipole - dipole potential , as can be seen in the close - ups , panels ( b)-(d ) .",
    "the energy splitting of the states within the ground - state manifold , panel ( b ) , is of order @xmath135 while that in the singly excited state manifolds , panels ( c - d ) , is of order @xmath136 .",
    "in panel ( b ) we additionally display the energy eigenvalues obtained from the effective hamiltonian ( [ h_eff ] ) .",
    "the shape of the potential is well reproduced .",
    "the dressed potentials shown in ( b)-(d ) have at least two interesting features : ( i ) their overall strength scales like @xmath137 or @xmath138 , it can thus easily be adjusted by choice of laser parameters and even manipulated time - dependently .",
    "( ii ) the shape of the potentials can be modified beyond a simple attractive or repulsive form @xmath139 , due to the appearance of avoided crossings .",
    "for example the attractive branch of potentials in the ground - state manifold , shown in fig .",
    "[ spectrum_deltaeq ]  ( b ) , approaches a finite value for small separations @xmath19 as can be seen from its continuation in fig .",
    "[ spectrum_deltaeq ]  ( a ) .",
    "this could avoid acceleration to high velocities during atomic collisions on the attractive potential , maybe reducing the probability of collisional ionisation @xcite .",
    "light induced modifications of potentials that would be strongly attractive in the absence of dressing have already been discussed for the case with a single ground state in ref .",
    "@xcite , and proposed as collisional shield for cold polar molecules in ref .",
    "however , in our case , once the separation of the atoms is much smaller than the minimal value included in , which is @xmath140 , we have to keep in mind that the simplified four - state model breaks down : the dipole - dipole shift of the dressed states then may become so large that they couple strongly to two - atom states that are not included in our model .",
    "let us briefly discuss the case when the detunings have equal magnitudes . as @xmath130 approaches @xmath131 , the asymptotic @xmath141 energy curve ( violet line ) in fig .",
    "[ spectrum_deltaeq ]  ( a ) is squeezed between the neighbouring ones until the states become degenerate .",
    "if we change the sign of one of the detunings and consider the special case @xmath142 , we obtain a particularly symmetric energy spectrum , shown in .",
    "as predicted by , the dressing - induced state transfer interaction vanishes between the states @xmath143 and @xmath144 .",
    "however symmetrical induced potentials can now be found in the singly - excited state manifold .",
    "the strength of these potentials scales as @xmath80 , different from those previously obtained in the ground - state manifold .",
    "we will discuss this further in .      in this section",
    "we revisit dressed dimer dynamics first presented in , to apply the results of .",
    "figure [ comparison_pt_fullh ] shows a comparison of the evolution governed by the effective perturbative hamiltonian with that following from the full hamiltonian .",
    "already fourth order perturbation theory describes the effective induced hopping period fairly well , as can be seen in panel ( b ) .",
    "when we move to the sixth order expressions , which can be found in [ vanvleck ] , the agreement becomes even better : the deviation never exceeds @xmath145 in the time - interval shown . in other simulations we found that perturbation theory agrees better with full calculations if @xmath61 is small , as is expected . even for parameters with poorer agreement between full- and perturbative dynamics ( for example larger @xmath61 or closer to an avoided crossing ) , we typically still obtain the primary features which make these induced potentials interesting : ( i ) we have persistent dressed hopping , ( ii ) the excited state occupancy is suppressed .",
    "since we have included the dipole - dipole interaction in the _ unperturbed _ part of the hamiltonian ( [ hunpert ] ) , we do not a priori require it to be small compared to the detuning for the perturbation theory in to be valid . in practice",
    "we find that expression ( [ h_eff ] ) works well even for @xmath146 , as long as one stays clear of the avoided crossings at @xmath147 .",
    "the large splitting of the eigenstates in the ground state manifold in the vicinity of the avoided crossing , see fig .",
    "[ spectrum_deltaeq ]  ( b ) , results in comparably fast population - oscillations .",
    "the regime where we can find dressed excitation transport on time scales shorter than the life - time of the multi atom state hence is typically entered when @xmath148 approaches @xmath149 , but has not quite reached it yet . the effective population - oscillation - period in is @xmath150ms .",
    "here @xmath151 , and the correction factor is @xmath152 due to the vicinity of an avoided crossing .",
    "let us reconsider the doubly excited state populations in . for atomic distances where the system is far from all avoided crossings shown in ,",
    "the doubly excited states would be suppressed by @xmath153 .",
    "this gets modified near these avoided crossings . for the distance @xmath65 @xmath2 m as",
    ", the system is fairly close to an avoided crossing , thus the doubly excited states are more strongly populated .    to conclude this section",
    ", we would like to remark on the position degree of freedom of the atoms carrying the interaction . in this article",
    "we treat it classically , assuming atoms with a precisely defined separation @xmath19 . in practice",
    ", each atom will have a position uncertainty , for example due to the zero - point motion in a harmonic well .",
    "the resulting distribution of interatomic distances @xmath19 can lead to a fast de - phasing of population oscillations such as shown in .",
    "for the example shown , if we would assume a separation uncertainty of @xmath154 the oscillations de - phase after @xmath155 cycles .",
    "we however do not study de - phasing here , since it is not specific to the _ dressed _ interactions . if we considered direct dipole - dipole excitation transport , between the states @xmath15 and @xmath16 only , it would also de - phase after @xmath155 cycles , which however would take place on a timescale of @xmath156 ns due to the by @xmath157 stronger interaction .",
    "thus , whether or not de - phasing due to disorder poses a problem depends on the intended application of excitation transport and not on whether or not the interactions arise due to dressing .    in particular ref .",
    "@xcite discusses an exemplary application where it poses no problem , simulations presented in ref .",
    "@xcite _ fully include atomic positioning uncertainties_. also in references @xcite we study systems with interesting combined excitation transport and atomic motion , with interactions that could be interpreted as arising via the techniques considered here .",
    "again , de - phasing effects do not pose a problem .",
    "the use of chains of rydberg atoms for random walks and other aggregate physics @xcite is limited by spontaneous decay and other incoherent loss processes from the rydberg states . when using a dressing scheme ,",
    "these decay processes are reduced by construction since the atomic population in rydberg states is kept small . throughout the paper , _ except _ , we thus do not explicitly include loss in the presented dynamical calculations , but instead estimate the life - time of dressed rydberg - aggregates based on their content of actual rydberg population .",
    "for example the state @xmath111 will be assigned a total effective decay - rate @xmath158 for two atoms .",
