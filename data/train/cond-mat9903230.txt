    "neutron and x - ray critical scattering experiments in different systems  @xcite revealed an unexpected feature : the two length scales coexistence . in the theory of critical phenomena",
    "it is expected that the vector dependence of the scattering intensity corresponds to a lorentzian function with a width proportional to the inverse of the correlation length .",
    "nevertheless it was found  @xcite more reasonable to understand the experimental measures supposing the superposition of a broad lorentzian ( which width closely behaves as it is theorically expected for these materials ) and a sharper function , which behaviour is similar to a simple or a squared lorentzian function . in ref .  @xcite it is proposed that this new component of the scattering intensity has an defect related origin , in particular due to the presence of dislocations near the sample surface .",
    "so there is a crossover between the bulk critical behaviour ( broad component ) and the _ disorder _",
    "critical behaviour . as the defects are not randomly placed points but randomly oriented lines , the quenched disorder is long - range correlated .",
    "a gaussian disorder with correlations decaying like a power law was studied in ref .",
    "@xcite for the vector spin models by analytical means , in particular using renormalization group expansion in @xmath1 and @xmath2 , up to first order , where @xmath3 is the power of the potential decay of the spatial correlation function and @xmath4 is the ordinary spatial dimension . for example , straight dislocation lines with random orientation can be represented with @xmath5 .",
    "in addition to the gaussian fixed point , the pure ising point and the short - ranged disordered one it appears another fixed point . this new point has a pair of complex eigenvalues that lead to oscillating scaling corrections .",
    "the critical exponents of the long - range correlated disorder fixed point are @xmath6 being , as usual , @xmath0 the thermal critical exponent , associated to the correlation length and @xmath7 , the anomalous dimension of the field . through the scaling relations it is possible to obtain the other critical exponents of the system .",
    "the first of the relations in eq .",
    "( [ expotheory ] ) should be valid at all order in perturbation theory and it should be an exact relation .",
    "the more interesting case of non - gaussian disorder has never been studied in detail , although it is possible that the results for non - gaussian disorder are the same of the gaussian case .",
    "it should be noted that the previous relation is valid only if the disorder decays in a sufficiently slow manner .",
    "a useful criterion due to harris  @xcite tells us whether the disorder is an irrelevant perturbation in the pure system , in terms of the pure critical behaviour .",
    "the criterion states that the short - ranged disorder is not relevant when @xmath8 . in ref .",
    "@xcite the harris criterion is extended to the long - range correlated case .",
    "this kind of disorder is an irrelevant perturbation if the condition @xmath9 holds , i.e. when the exponent @xmath0 given by the relation ( [ expotheory ] ) is larger than the exponent @xmath10 of the model without disorder .",
    "a line of defects corresponds to a correlation decay with a @xmath11 power , but with a non - gaussian distribution of the disorder .",
    "in this case , using the data from the pure ising case , @xmath12  @xcite , the extended criterion tell us that the disorder is a relevant perturbation . neglecting the non - gaussian effects and applying the results of the eq .",
    "( [ expotheory ] ) to this case , in ref .",
    "@xcite , is found a @xmath0 exponent close with the experimental data for different materials  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it was computed the local fluctuation on the critical temperature due to the line defects concentration finding also an acceptable agreement .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the same authors have studied the influence of the long - range correlated disorder in the line shape of the narrow component of the scattering intensity function , finding that it can be steeper than a lorentzian one , also in agreement with the experimental data .",
    "they were assuming the gaussian disordered model and the line defects one , where the disorder is non - gaussian at large scale , do belong to the same universality class .    in this study",
    "we will compute by monte carlo means the critical exponents of the site - diluted ising model with long - range correlated disorder , in the @xmath11 case , in order to numerically check the analytical predictions that seem compatible with some experimental results . in order to do this",
    "we will use the finite - size scaling techniques that are recently applied to the study of random site - diluted ising systems  @xcite .",
    "we will study both gaussian and non - gaussian disorder and we will find similar results for the critical exponents supporting the correctness of the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the layout of the paper is the following . in section 2 we will define the model we have simulated in the lattice and the two different ways used to introduce the long - range correlated disorder in the system . in section 3 we will show the finite - size techniques we used .",
    "the technical details of the simulation will be reported in section 4 .",
    "the numerical results will be shown in section 5 . finally , in section 6 , we will report the conclusions of this study .",
    "we have considered the following hamiltonian defined in a cubic lattice of linear size @xmath13 with periodic boundary conditions : @xmath14 where the sum is extended to the nearest neighbours , @xmath15 are the usual z@xmath16 spin variables and the @xmath17 s are quenched random variables , with long - range spatial correlation .",
    "an actual @xmath18 set will be called a _ sample _ from now on .",
    "we have studied two different ways to introduce the correlation between the @xmath18 variables .",
    "the first one is to obtain a set of @xmath19 correlated gaussian random variables , @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the position vector in the lattice , with these properties : @xmath22 where @xmath23 . in order to do this",
    "we have used the fourier filtering ( ff ) method  @xcite .",
    "let @xmath24 be the fourier transform of the function @xmath25 in momentum space .",
    "let us define the set @xmath26 as @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a gaussian set of random numbers in the complex plane with the following properties : @xmath29    at this point we construct @xmath20 as the inverse fourier transform of the @xmath26 set .",
    "in order to assure that the @xmath20 set is real we have to introduce the condition : @xmath30 the zero mode divergence in a lattice treatment is eliminated by using the condition @xmath31 .",
    "this choice agrees with the property @xmath32 .    with these definitions @xmath20",
    "becomes a gaussian random variable , as it is a sum of a large number of random variables , and it is easy to prove that the relations given by eq .",
    "( [ randomcorrel ] ) are satisfied .",
    "furthermore , it is also possible to calculate the variance of this gaussian distribution , as the zero momentum inverse fourier transform of @xmath24 .    with the @xmath33 set",
    "we proceed to choose , with a given probability @xmath34 , that we will call the mean concentration of the system , when each site is occupied ( @xmath35 ) or not ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "we compute the area below the corresponding gaussian distribution for the @xmath7 random variable up to its actual value @xmath20 .",
    "we compare this quantity with @xmath34 and we consider that the site is occupied if the area is smaller than @xmath34 .    in this work we will study the case @xmath11 corresponding to linear defects . with this value",
    "we have checked that the correlation obtained for the @xmath33 set with the ff method , performed in double precision , is in good agreement with the expected correlation function .",
    "although it is evident that the @xmath37 are not gaussian variables , their connected correlation functions at all different points are equal to zero and therefore this model corresponds to a gaussian model at large scale ( non - gaussian effects are restricted at short scale and are likely irrelevant ) .",
    "this model is what we referred to as gaussian distributed noise in the introduction .",
    "a second way to obtain samples with long - range correlated disorder with a decay with the inverse of the square of the distance is to remove lines of a given configuration .",
    "we start with a filled cubic lattice and remove lines until we get the fixed concentration @xmath34 . the last line considered in this procedure",
    "is removed or not with a given probability in order to get as the mean concentration the @xmath34 value .",
    "we also want that the probability of removal for all the lattice points to be the same , and the lattice symmetries to be preserved . we can do that by only removing lines along the axes .",
    "it is clear that the connected correlation functions with this method are definitely different from zero also at long distances .",
    "the noise is very far from being gaussian and this model is referred to as the non - gaussian distributed noise in the introduction .    in both cases",
    ", we will consider the quenched disorder , that is , we first calculate the average of a given observable on the @xmath38 variables with the boltzmann weight given by the hamiltonian of the eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonian ] ) , the results on the different samples being _ later _ averaged .",
    "the quenched approximation is due to the fact that the defect dynamics is slower that the associated to the magnetic interaction .",
    "we will denote by brackets the thermal average and by overlines the sample average .",
    "the observables will be denoted with calligraphic letters , i.e. @xmath39 , and we will use the italics for the double average @xmath40 .",
    "thus , we can define the nearest - neighbours energy as @xmath41 this quantity is extensively used for extrapolating the results for a given observable , @xmath42 , obtained at coupling @xmath43 to a nearby coupling @xmath44  @xcite as well as for calculating @xmath43-derivatives through its connected correlation with the observable . for instance , one can define the specific - heat as @xmath45    the order parameter of the phase transition is the usual normalized magnetization @xmath46    as in a finite lattice , its mean value , @xmath47 , is zero , we are restricted to work with even powers of the magnetization .",
    "the second power is related to the susceptibility of the system : @xmath48    with the fourth power we can construct another interesting quantity , the cumulant @xmath49 , defined as @xmath50 in the finite - size scaling method we use it is very convenient to have a well behaved estimate of the correlation length in a finite lattice .",
    "we have used the second - momentum definition , that reads  @xcite @xmath51 where @xmath52 is defined in terms of the fourier transform of the spin distribution @xmath53 as @xmath54",
    "in the scaling region , the mean value of a given observable , @xmath42 , measured at a coupling ( @xmath55 ) pair can be written as @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the critical exponent of the operator @xmath42 , @xmath58 is a smooth scaling function depending on the observable and @xmath59 corresponds to the eigenvalue of the first irrelevant operator of the theory from the renormalization group point of view .    the principal feature of eq .",
    "( [ fsseq ] ) is that all the quantities are measurable in a finite lattice . in order to obtain the critical exponents we need to remove the unknown scaling function @xmath58 .",
    "let us define the quotient of a given observable @xmath42 at two different lattice sizes and at the same coupling pair as @xmath60 and let us compute this quotient at the coupling where the correlation length in units of the lattice size is the same for both lattices .",
    "thus we get : @xmath61 where @xmath62 is a constant which depends on the observable and the spin concentration @xmath34 and the dots stand for higher - order scaling corrections . from this equation",
    "we can extract the critical exponent associated to a given observable .",
    "the observables used to obtain the different critical exponents are : the @xmath43-derivative of the correlation length in order to calculate @xmath0 ( @xmath63 ) and the susceptibility , @xmath64 , to get the magnetic @xmath7 exponent , ( @xmath65 ) .    in order to compute the infinite volume critical coupling",
    "we will use the crossing points of the observables with @xmath66 , as @xmath49 or @xmath67 , when measured at two different lattice sizes , @xmath13 and @xmath68 .",
    "the shift of these points from the critical coupling behaves as  @xcite : @xmath69",
    "the best update method for an ising model simulation is a cluster algorithm  @xcite . in particular ,",
    "the most efficient one in the pure case is the single - cluster wolff method  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , in a diluted system small groups of isolated spins appear , which are scarcely visited with this algorithm .",
    "furthermore in the non - gaussian case also appear isolated occupied lines . in order to update all - sized spin clusters , after a fixed number of single - cluster updates we perform a swendsen - wang sweep .",
    "we call this ensemble our mc step ( mcs )",
    ". we have discarded 100 mcs for thermalization and then we have measured the different observables for every single mcs .",
    "we have checked the correct thermalization of the system by starting from hot and cold configurations .",
    "we have chosen the single - cluster updates number in such a way that the autocorrelation times for all the observables are nearly one mcs .",
    "the simulations are carried out in the rtnn machine at zaragoza university .",
    "other interesting parameters are the number of measures to perform in a given disorder realization , @xmath70 , using the ising hamiltonian , eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonian ] ) , and the number of different samples , @xmath71 .",
    "we refer to  @xcite for a discussion of the optimal choice of these parameters . in our case",
    ", we have performed @xmath72 measures in @xmath73 different samples for @xmath74 and in @xmath75 samples for @xmath76 .",
    "we have used in this study the usual @xmath43-extrapolation  @xcite .",
    "thus we restrict to not too strong dilutions .    in order to work with large dilutions",
    "it is convenient to perform a @xmath34 extrapolation as we will see later from the phase diagram of the systems . in the random site - diluted ising model case",
    "this is possible because the density distribution probability of the actual configurations ( a binomial one ) is known . in the gaussian model , due to the correlation between the different sites , this distribution it is not known . neither in the non - gaussian case , as it is presented here .",
    "nevertheless it is possible to perform a slight variation of this latter model allowing to perform a dilution extrapolation .",
    "it is enough to choose with a given probability when a line it is empty or filled , but this variation will be not considered in this study .",
    "we recall  @xcite that a bias of order @xmath77 is present in the @xmath43-extrapolation , where @xmath78 is the correlation time between the energy and the observable we consider .",
    "this fact is not relevant in the usual mc calculations , because the statistical errors are of order @xmath79 .",
    "but in diluted system investigations , when @xmath80 , this bias could be not negligible .",
    "we have performed a proper extrapolation procedure  @xcite in order to obtain unbiased estimates of the @xmath43-derivatives and the values of the different observables in the neighbourhood of the simulated couplings .",
    "the mcs is chosen in such a way that @xmath78 is nearly one measure .",
    "for the largest lattice we have considered , @xmath76 , in the non - gaussian case , the single cluster update number for every swendsen - wang sweep is 1200 and for the gaussian case it is 400 . for the statistical error computation",
    "we have used the jack - knife method with 50 blocks , that allows us to obtain a 10% of accuracy in the error bars .",
    "we have studied the gaussian case at two different dilutions , @xmath81 and @xmath82 , performing simulations in lattice sizes @xmath83 and 128 . in the non - gaussian case",
    "we have only considered @xmath81 in the same lattice sizes .    in figure",
    "[ diagram ] we show the phase diagram for the gaussian model .",
    "the percolation critical point , @xmath84 , was obtained by studying the behaviour of the @xmath49 function in a @xmath76 lattice . in the thermodynamical limit ,",
    "@xmath85 in the disordered phase and @xmath86 in a ferromagnetic ordered one .",
    "the corresponding phase diagram for the non - gaussian case is qualitatively the same , with a ferromagnetic ordered phase for large @xmath43 , when @xmath34 is larger that the percolation threshold for this case .      in table",

    "as we see , there are visible scaling corrections in all the cases .",

    ", we have to perform an infinite volume extrapolation procedure .",
    "it is possible that corrections - to - scaling that we observe are complicated by the presence of oscillatory terms , as is suggested by the first order of the @xmath17-expansion , but we are unable to confirm or discard this possibility .",
    "strong corrections to simple scaling are present as we will see , so it is rather difficult ( although we study lattices ranging from @xmath91 to @xmath92 ) to get conclusive statements on the nature of finite volume corrections .",

    "( [ quomega ] ) only with the first term .",
    "we have used the data from the two different dilutions of the gaussian case performing a joint fit assuming a single value for @xmath59 and @xmath0 exponents , following the picture of a single universality class along the critical line . using @xmath93 data and the full covariance matrix to compute the statistical function @xmath94",
    ", we find a very large value of @xmath95 . nevertheless ,",

    "if we do so , we obtain for @xmath81 , @xmath101 with @xmath102 and for @xmath82 , @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "so , the presence of second - order corrections for the thermal exponent data seems reasonable .",
    "furthermore we have found that the @xmath0 value is not affected by the presence of these terms .    in the non - gaussian case",
    "large finite volume corrections are also present .",

    "an infinite volume extrapolation procedure is therefore needed in order to get an @xmath7 estimate .    assuming only the presence of first - order corrections with our previously calculated @xmath59 value we do not find reasonable fits to our data .",

    "so we have found compatible results with the picture of a single @xmath7 value , scaling corrections parameterized by @xmath106 , but with non - negligible higher - order correction effects . nevertheless , this estimate has two different sources of systematic error : the first one is due to the possible evolution of the @xmath7 value with the minimum lattice size considered in the fits , and the second , to the uncertainty on the fitted functional form",
    ".    we can compare this result with those from the random site - diluted ising model , @xmath110  @xcite , and with those from the ising case , @xmath111  @xcite , finding that they are similar to our estimate for @xmath7 .      in table",
