    "-5 mm    the purpose of this paper is to review the recent developments in a formal framework to extract topological information from nonlinear elliptic operators .",
    "we also explain some applications of the idea to 4-dimensional topology by using the seiberg - witten theory .",
    "a prototype is the notion of index for linear elliptic operators . in this introduction",
    "we explain this linear case .",
    "later we mainly explain the seiberg - witten case .",
    "let @xmath1 be an linear elliptic operator on a close manifold @xmath2 .",
    "the index @xmath3 is defined to be @xmath4 we can extend this definition as follows .",
    "take any decomposition @xmath5 .",
    "such that @xmath6 is a linear map between two finite dimensional vector spaces and that @xmath7 is an isomorphism between infinite dimensional vector spaces .",
    "then we have @xmath8 it is easy to check that the right - hand - side is independent of the choice of the decomposition .",
    "for example we have decomposition satisfying @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , which gives the former definition of the index .",
    "an important property of @xmath3 is its invariance under continuous variation of @xmath12 .",
    "this property is closely related to the above well - definedness .    another way to understand",
    "this property is to consider the whole space of fredholm maps",
    ". then the given map @xmath12 sits in the space and the @xmath3 is nothing but the label of the connected component containing @xmath12 .    in other words , there are presumably three possible attitudes :    1 .   the essential data is  supported \" on @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "2 .   it is convenient to look at  some \" finite dimensional approximation .",
    "the essential data is the whole map @xmath15 .",
    "when one considers a family of elliptic operators and tries to define the index of the family , it is not enough to look at their kernels and cokernels .",
    "it is tempting to regard the finite dimensional approximation as a topological version of the notion of  low energy effective theory \" in physics . in this story ,",
    "the whole map @xmath12 would be regarded as a given original theory .    in this paper",
    "we explain a nonlinear version of the notion of index which is formulated by using finite dimensional approximations .",
    "-5 mm    while every elliptic operator on a closed manifold has its index as topological invariant , it is quite rare that a nonlinear elliptic operator gives some topological invariant .",
    "we have three examples of this type of invariants : the donaldson invariant , the gromov - ruan - witten invariant and the seiberg - witten invariant .",
    "moreover , the casson invariant is regarded a variant of the donaldson invariant .",
    "some other finite type invariants for @xmath16-manifolds are also supposed to be related to these kinds of invariant @xcite .    even for these cases , however , it is not obvious how to proceed to obtain nonlinear version of index in full generality .",
    "let us first give several examples of finite dimensional approximations .    1 .",
    "c. conley and e. zehnder solved the arnold conjecture for torus by reducing a certain variational problem to a finite dimensional morse theory @xcite .",
    "casson s definition of the casson invariant .",
    "taubes gave an interpretation of the casson invariant via gauge theory @xcite .",
    "in other words , casson s construction gave a finite dimensional approximation of the gauge theoretical setting by taubes .",
    "( the statement of the atiyah - floer conjecture could be regarded as a _ partial _ finite dimensional approximation along fibers . )",
    "seiberg - witten equation .",
    "the moduli space of seiberg - witten equation is known to be compact for closed @xmath0-manifolds .",
    "this enables us to globalize the kuranishi construction to obtain finite dimensional approximations @xcite , @xcite .",
    "seiberg - witten - floer theory c. manolescu and p.b .",
    "kronheimer defined floer homotopy type for seiberg - witten theory , which is formulated as spectrum @xcite @xcite .",
    "kontsevish explained an idea to define invariants of @xmath16-manifolds by using configuration spaces .",
    "this idea was realized by fukaya @xcite , bott - cattaneo @xcite @xcite , and kuperberg - thurston @xcite .",
    "formally the configuration spaces appear as finite approximations of certain path spaces .",
    "-5 mm    while the index is regarded as the infinitesimal information of a nonlinear elliptic operator , its local information is given by the kuranishi map , which has been used to describe local structure in various moduli problems @xcite .",
    "a few years ago the arnold conjecture was solved in a fairly general setting and the gromov - ruan - witten invariant was defined for general symplectic manifolds .",
    "these works were done by several groups independently @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "a key of their arguments was to construct virtual moduli cycle over @xmath17 .    in their case ,",
    "the point is to glue local structure to obtain some global data to define invariants .",
    "since their invariants are defined by evaluating cohomology classes , it was enough to have the virtual moduli cycle .",
    "-5 mm    the notion of fukaya - ono s kuranishi structure or ruan s virtual neighborhood is defined as equivalence class of collections of maps , which define the moduli space .",
    "the collection of maps is necessary because the moduli space as topological space is not enough to recover the nature of the singularity on it .",
    "the data depend on the choice of various choice of auxiliary data .",
    "when we change the data , the change of the moduli space is supposed to be given by a cobordism , even with the extra structure we have to look at .",
    "suppose we would like to regard this structure itself as an invariant .",
    "then we have to identify the place where the invariant lives .",
    "since cobordism classes are identified by pontrjagin - thom construction , what we need would be a certain stable version of pontrjagin - thom construction .",
    "in the case of symplectic geometry or donaldson s theory , this construction has not been done .",
    "a main problem seems to describe a finite dimensional approximation of the ambient space where the compactification of the moduli space lies .",
    "( the same problem occurs for kotschick - morgan conjecture . )",
    "since the compactification is fairly complicated , it is not straightforward to identify the finite dimensional approximation .",
    "however in the seiberg - witten case , the moduli spaces are known to be compact for closed @xmath0-manifolds and it is not necessary to take any further compactifications .",
    "let us briefly recall the seiberg - witten equation for a closed spin@xmath18 manifold @xmath2 . for simplicity",
    "we assume @xmath19 .",
    "let @xmath20 be the spinor bundle and @xmath21 be the space of connections on @xmath22 .",
    "then the seiberg - witten equation is given by a map @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the self - dual @xmath25-forms for a fixed riemannian metric .",
    "this is an @xmath26-equivariant map .",
    "the inverse image of @xmath27 divided by @xmath28 is the moduli space , which is known to be compact .",
    "a finite approximation of the above map is defined by global version of the kuranishi construction .",
    "the approximation is a _ proper _ @xmath26-equivariant map @xmath29 for some natural numbers @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "the differences @xmath32 and @xmath33 depends only on the topology of @xmath2 and its spin@xmath18-structure .",
    "the invariant we have is the stable homotopy class of the above @xmath26-equivariant proper map , or equivalently , the @xmath26-equivariant map from the sphere @xmath34 to the sphere @xmath35 .",
    "s. bauer and the author pointed out that the invariant constructed above is a refinement of the usual seiberg - witten invariant @xcite .",
    "-5 mm    we explain some applications of the finite dimensional approximation to @xmath0-dimensional topology .",
    "\\(1 ) bauer s connected sum formula @xcite    suppose @xmath2 is the connected sum of @xmath36 and @xmath37 . if the neck of the connected sum is long enough , it is known that the moduli space of the solution of the seiberg - witten equation ( or anti - self - dual equation ) for @xmath2 is identified with the product of the moduli spaces for @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "when @xmath38 , then this gives the blowing - up formula .",
    "when @xmath39 , this gives vanishing of the seiberg - witten ( or the donaldson ) invariant of @xmath40 .",
    "bauer essentially showed that the product formula holds true for the virtual neighborhood of the moduli spaces , if we use ruan s terminology . in the language of stable maps between spheres ,  product \"",
    "becomes  join \" .",
    "in particular bauer s formula gives the blowing - up formula for the refined invariant .",
    "when @xmath41 , the join is torsion .",
    "it is , however , not necessary zero . in this way bauer gave many new examples of @xmath0-manifolds which are homeomorphic but not diffeomorphic to each other .",
    "ishida - lebrun @xcite @xcite obtained some applications of the connected sum formula to riemannian geometry .",
    "\\(2 ) intersection form of spin @xmath0-manifolds    when @xmath0-manifold is spin , we have certain extra symmetry , and the place where the invariant lives is a set of @xmath42-equivariant stable maps @xcite .",

    "-5 mm    the idea of finite dimensional approximation is closely related to the notion of  low energy effective theory \" in physics . actually the approximation should be regarded just as a part of the vast notion which we can deal with rigorously or mathematically .    since witten s realization of donaldson theory as a tqft",
    ", the formal relation between mathematically regorous definition of invariants and their formal path integral expressions has suggested many things .",
    "for instance , the well - definedness of the donaldson invariant is based on the fact that the formal dimension of the moduli space increases when the instanton number goes up .",
    "this fact seems equivalent to the other fact that the pure yang - mills theory is asymptitotically free ( for n=2 susy theory ) and its renormalized theory does exists .    in the case of the finite dimensional approximations of seiberg - witten theory ,",

    "this topological setting is very limitted .",
