    "then @xmath92 and @xmath93    corollary  [ ypc ] , which should be seen as the natural generalization of  , is particularly interesting as it identifies exactly the values of @xmath94 for which the twisted moments @xmath95 are very large .",
    "indeed these large moments ( e.g. satisfying @xmath96 ) correspond to the values of @xmath94 for which the continued fraction expansion of @xmath79 contains a large coefficient ( e.g. @xmath97 $ ] with some @xmath98 ) and thus to the @xmath79 which are `` very close '' to a rational number with `` small '' denominator .",
    "corollary  [ ypc ] can also be used to investigate the second moment of dirichlet l - functions with two twists : @xmath99 the problem of finding an asymptotic for @xmath100 was first considered by selberg  @xcite , who obtained the asymptotic formula @xmath101 in the case @xmath102 ( and @xmath1 prime ) .",

    "[ c3 t ] let @xmath112 be different primes and let @xmath108 . then @xmath113    corollary  [ c3 t ] indicates clearly that the condition @xmath114 is necessary for the asymptotic formula   to hold .",

    "we remark also that periodic functions @xmath120 which admit simple expressions in terms of the continued fraction expansion of @xmath79 ( such as @xmath95 , by corollary  [ ypc ] ) are strictly related to additive functions of @xmath121 , modulo the parabolic elements . in recent years , there have been several works studying the distribution of functions of this kind , see , for example ,  @xcite .",
    "it is possible that a similar approach might work also in the study of the distribution of @xmath6 .",
    "( anyway , in a forthcoming work we choose a different route , computing all the moments for @xmath6 by using classical methods of moments of @xmath3-functions ) .",
    "this would be especially interesting because it would also give a new approach to the @xmath122-th moment of dirichlet @xmath3-functions at the central point .",

    "for example ,",
    "when combined with burgess bound ( or with estimates for kloosterman sums , such as those in  @xcite ) , corollary  [ ypc ] gives non - trivial bounds for the average value of @xmath129 as @xmath94 varies in short intervals .",
    "our approach in proving the reciprocity formula for @xmath95 is different from that of conrey and young .",
    "indeed our first step consists in relating @xmath6 to the estermann function at the central point ( for @xmath1 prime ) .",

    "the estermann function is an extremely useful tool when studying moments of the riemann zeta - function and of dirichlet @xmath3-functions ( see , for example ,  @xcite ) .",
    "this is mainly because it satisfies a functional equation , which is essentially equivalent to voronoi s summation formula .",

    "satisfy reciprocity relations , in proposition  [ cfd ] below we highlight yet another symmetry of @xmath149 , obtained by using methods similar to those of  @xcite . we will then use this result to deduce theorems  [ mt ] and  [ mtc ] via the following relation between twisted moments of dirichlet @xmath3-function and the estermann function .",

    "we remark that an approximate version of   in the special case @xmath52 appeared in  @xcite and that   has been recently proved by louboutin  @xcite and djankovic  @xcite , with a different method . in recent years",
