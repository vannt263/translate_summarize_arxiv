    "a domino in @xmath0 is a @xmath1-translate of either of the two sets @xmath2\\times[0,2]$ ] or @xmath3\\times[0,1]$ ] .",
    "if @xmath4 is a region comprised of a union of @xmath1-translates of @xmath2 ^ 2 $ ] , a of @xmath5 is a representation of @xmath5 as a union of dominoes with pairwise disjoint interiors .",
    "domino tilings , or equivalently the dimer model on a square lattice , are an extensively studied and well - understood lattice model in statistical physics and combinatorics .",
    "their rigorous analysis dates back to kasteleyn @xcite and temperley - fisher @xcite , who independently derived the formula @xmath6 for the number of domino tilings of an @xmath7 rectangular region .",
    "about thirty years later , a different family of regions was found to have a much simpler formula for the number of its domino tilings : if we define the of order @xmath8 to be the set @xmath9\\times[j , j+1]\\ ] ] ( see figure [ fig - aztecdiamond ] ) , then elkies , kuperberg , larsen and propp @xcite proved that @xmath10 has exactly @xmath11 domino tilings .",
    "this can be proved by induction in several ways , but is perhaps best understood via a connection to .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     another important fact concerns the beautiful connection , discovered by elkies , kuperberg , larsen and propp @xcite , between height functions of domino tilings of @xmath10 and height matrices of asm s : each normalized height function @xmath12 on @xmath13 is essentially comprised of the superposition of two ( symmetrized ) height matrices @xmath14 where @xmath15 is an asm of order @xmath8 and @xmath16 is an asm of order @xmath17 .",
    "more precisely , @xmath18 and @xmath19 can be recovered from @xmath12 by @xmath20 ( note the slight difference from the formulas in @xcite due to a difference in the center of the coordinate system used ) .",
    "this correspondence defines a one - to - one mapping from the set of domino tilings of @xmath10 to the set of pairs @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the pairs @xmath21 which are obtained via this mapping are exactly the so - called pairs defined by robbins and rumsey @xcite : @xmath15 and @xmath16 are called compatible if the ( non - symmetrized ) height matrices @xmath24 satisfy the conditions @xmath25 it was also shown in @xcite that for a given asm @xmath26 , the number of @xmath27 that are compatible with @xmath15 is equal to @xmath28 .",
    "combined with the formula for the number of domino tilings of @xmath10 , this implies that if @xmath29 is a uniformly random domino tiling of @xmath10 , and @xmath21 is the associated pair of compatible asm s , then the random asm @xmath15 is distributed according to the domino measure @xmath30 ( of course , this provides the explanation for our choice of name for this measure ) .",
    "we now combine theorem  [ thm - limitshape - asm - sym ] with the above discussion to easily obtain the following result , originally proved in @xcite .",
    "[ thm - limitshape - dom ] for each @xmath31 , let @xmath32 be a uniformly random domino tiling of @xmath10 , and let @xmath33 be its associated height function .",
    "then as @xmath34 we have the convergence in probability @xmath35{{\\mathbb{p } } } 0,\\ ] ] where @xmath36 and @xmath37 is defined in theorem  [ thm - limitshape - asm - sym ] .    for pairs @xmath38",
    "for which @xmath39 is odd , the proximity of @xmath40 to @xmath41 follows from . for other pairs @xmath42 ,",
    "apply the previous observation to an pair @xmath43 adjacent to @xmath42 and use the facts that @xmath44 and that @xmath45 is a continuous function .",
    "theorem  [ thm - limitshape - dom ] implies a weak form of the arctic circle theorem ( theorem  [ thm - arcticcircle ] ) : first , since inside the arctic circle the limit shape function @xmath46 is not a linear function , it follows that the frozen region can not extend in the limit into the arctic circle , which is `` half '' of the theorem . in the other direction",
    ", we get only a weaker statement that outside the arctic circle we can have in the limit at most @xmath47 `` non - frozen '' dominoes , since that is what the linearity of the limiting height function in that region implies .",
    "it is interesting to contrast this with the square young tableaux problem .",
    "there , too , the large deviation approach gave only a bound in one direction on the behavior of the square young tableau along the boundary of the square .",
    "however , pittel and romik managed to prove the other direction using an additional combinatorial argument ( inspired by a method of vershik and kerov @xcite ) .",
    "it would be interesting to see whether one can emulate this approach in the present case to get a new proof of the arctic circle theorem .",
    "a similar question applies to the problem of random boxed plane partitions studied by cohn , larsen and propp @xcite , where again the limit shape theorem for the height function does not imply an arctic circle result in its strong form .      in this paper",
    "we have shown that two so - called arctic circle phenomena , namely those appearing in the contexts of random domino tilings of the aztec diamond and of random square young tableaux , are closely related , in the sense that the limit shape results underlying them can be given a more or less unified treatment using the techniques of large deviation theory and the calculus of variations , and that the derivations in both cases result in nearly identical computations and formulas .",
    "note that these are not the only combinatorial models in which arctic circles appear .",
    "other examples known to the author include the shape of a uniformly random boxed plane partition derived by cohn , larsen and propp @xcite and the arctic circle theorem for random groves , due to petersen and speyer @xcite .",
    "one might therefore wish to extend the insights of the present paper to these other models .",
    "the treatment of boxed plane partitions in @xcite is already based on a large deviations analysis , and in fact the variational problem studied there seems to be quite closely related to the variational problems studied here and in @xcite .",
    "therefore , it should be relatively straightforward to use the techniques presented here to give a new derivation of the solution to the variational problem from @xcite ( which in particular would provide a fully satisfactory answer to open question  6.3 from that paper ) .",
    "one reason why the methods and ideas presented in this paper may be considered worthy of attention is somewhat speculative in nature .",
    "it pertains to the potential future applicability of these methods and ideas to a well - known open problem on alternating sign matrices : that is , the problem of finding the limiting shape of a _ uniformly _ random asm of high order . here , ``",
    "limit shape '' is usually taken to refer to the shape of the region in which the non - zero entries cluster ( the `` temperate region '' ) , although one could also ask ( as we have done here in the case of @xmath30-random asm s ) about the limiting shape of the height matrix , which also contains useful information about the behavior of the asm inside the temperate region .",
    "important progress on this question was made recently by colomo and pronko @xcite , who conjectured the explicit formula @xmath48 for the limit shape of the boundary of the temperate region in a uniformly random asm ( fig .",
    "[ fig - colomopronko ] ) , and provided a heuristic derivation of this conjectured formula based on certain natural , but still conjectural , analytic assumptions .    in view of this state of affairs",
    ", it is worth noting that the ideas presented in this paper seem to be rather suitable for attacking this challenging open problem .",
    "there is only one main `` missing piece '' ( albeit possibly a very substantial one ) in our understanding .",
    "the idea is to replace theorem  [ thm - mostimportant ] , which is the combinatorial observation which lies at the heart of the large deviations analysis , with an analogous statement that holds for the uniform measure on the set @xmath49 of asm s of order @xmath8 .",
    "this statement is given in the following theorem , whose proof follows similar lines to the proof of theorem  [ thm - mostimportant ] and is omitted .",
    "let @xmath50 denote the uniform measure on the set of asm s of order @xmath8 .",
    "for a positive integer @xmath51 and integers @xmath52 , denote by @xmath53 the number of monotone triangles of order @xmath51 with bottom row @xmath54 .",
    "then , in the notation of theorem  [ thm - mostimportant ] , we have @xmath55 \\\\",
    "= \\frac{1}{|{{\\cal a}}_n| } \\alpha_k(x_1,\\ldots , x_k)\\ , \\alpha_{n - k}(y_1,\\ldots , y_{n - k } ) \\qquad\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] [ thm - mostimportant - analogue ]    unfortunately , while a formula for @xmath56 is known ( see @xcite ) , the function @xmath57 seems much more difficult to understand ( and in particular , to derive asymptotics for ) than the vandermonde function @xmath58 , and this is the piece that is missing when one tries to duplicate our analysis to the setting of uniformly random asm s .",
    "nevertheless , the function @xmath57 has recently been the subject of several very fruitful studies .",
    "fischer @xcite derived the following beautiful `` operator formula '' for @xmath57 : @xmath59 \\frac{\\delta(x_1,\\ldots , x_k)}{\\delta(1,\\ldots , k)}.\\ ] ] here , @xmath58 is the vandermonde function as before , and @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 are operators acting on the ring of polynomials @xmath63 $ ] : @xmath60 is the identity operator , @xmath61 is the shift operator in the variable @xmath64 ( that substitutes @xmath65 for each occurrence @xmath64 in a polynomial ) , and @xmath66 is the operator in the variable @xmath67 .",
    "fischer then showed in several subsequent papers that it is possible to use to get highly non - trivial information on the enumeration of alternating sign matrices : in @xcite she obtained a new proof of the celebrated refined alternating sign matrix theorem ( see @xcite for the statement and fascinating history of this result ) ; in @xcite she and the author obtained additional results concerning a `` doubly - refined '' enumeration of asm s ; and in @xcite she proved a conjecture from @xcite , extending these results further to a `` multiply - refined '' enumeration .",
    "thus , it seems quite conceivable that additional study of @xmath57 may eventually lead to a deeper understanding of this function , that , in combination with theorem  [ thm - mostimportant - analogue ] and the techniques of this paper , could provide a basis for a successful attack on the limit shape problem for uniformly random asm s ."
