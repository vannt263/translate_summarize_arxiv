    "evolution of a quantum system , if governed by a time - independent hamiltonian , is fully described by relative phase shifts acquired by its energy eigenstates . these phase shifts which we refer to as dynamical phases are equal to the energy differences of the levels integrated over time . on the other hand , for a general time - dependent system",
    "hamiltonian fully analytical treatment is usually impossible , or at least hardly tractable .",
    "there is also an intermediate regime in which adiabatic variation of the system parameters leaves the population of the instantaneous energy levels unchanged . in this case , however , apart from the dynamical phases the levels acquire geometric phase factors @xcite or , in the case of degeneracy , undergo a nontrivial transformation ( within the degenerate subspace ) , also geometric in its nature @xcite .",
    "a separate class of phenomena utilizes only the process of adiabatic following ( independently of the phases acquired ) , which can result in a coherent population transfer between levels that are not directly coupled [ this process has been extensively studied in quantum optical systems , where is known as the stimulated raman adiabatic passage ( stirap)@xcite ] .",
    "the peculiar property of the latter is that the entire transformation takes place within a single , non - degenerate level , and the resulting transformation is not simply just a phase shift .",
    "this seems to contradict the predictions made by berry @xcite .",
    "however , more detailed study shows that such transfer is possible because of the level crossings at the initial and final times of the process .",
    "the theory of adiabatic phenomena is well - established for systems with exactly distinguishable or exactly degenerate levels .",
    "the vicinity of the crossing points seems to be a troublesome , intermediate regime : when the energy difference between the energy levels tends to zero there is apparently no time scale defining the adiabaticity .",
    "recently , @xcite discussed the adiabatic theorem in dissipative systems . in this scenario the energy gap , which is present in isolated systems , disappears . nevertheless ,",
    "as the authors show , the adiabaticity still can be defined .",
    "here we consider an isolated quantum system in which the levels cross as the externally controlled parameters are varied .",
    "an analysis of adiabatic phenomena in isolated systems with nearly crossing levels has been performed in ref .",
    "@xcite ; however , the time dependence of the system parameters has been assumed to be arbitrary .",
    "similarly , in ref .",
    "@xcite the nonadiabatic corrections due to level crossing in three - level processes ( stirap ) has been evaluated , again assuming that the time dependence of the parameters is fixed for a given realization . in our work",
    "we perform an analysis of an evolution in which only the path in the parameter space is arbitrary .",
    "it is indeed very often the most important characteristic in experiments probing adiabatic phenomena , such as detection of geometric phases or population transfer ( stirap , coherent charge pumping @xcite ) , and the time dependence does not influence the results of the measurements any further ( it needs only to be adiabatic ) .    to summarize the most important of our results , let us suppose that we have given a path in the parameter space that passes through some degeneracy point and we want to determine whether it is possible to satisfy the adiabaticity condition .",
    "in what follows , we show that the answer is uniquely determined by the geometry of the path . for the cases when it is possible ,",
    "we derive a differential equation whose solution gives the _ time _ variation of the parameters ( along the path ) , for which transitions between distinct energy levels can be neglected .",
    "moreover , we show that at the level crossing the energy eigenstates are discontinuous , which can result in nontrivial transformations .",
    "the points of crossing correspond themselves to geometric phenomena , in which the geometry is determined only by the direction in the parameter space from which such points are approached . for closed paths which can be passed adiabatically our results together with the wilczek - zee connection @xcite give a method of calculating geometric transformations in a system with many level crossings and degenerate levels .",
    "finally we comment on the system behavior while passing through the crossing points . to give a physical picture of the analyzed problem we apply our results to the process of the three - level raman adiabatic passage .",
    "consider a quantum system in which we choose a fixed ( parameter - independent ) basis of states @xmath0",
    "( @xmath1 is the set of parameters of the system and @xmath2 the parameter space , also referred to as the control manifold ) contains terms that couple different states in this basis , and after diagonalization we obtain the parameter - dependent basis of instantaneous energy eigenstates @xmath3 here @xmath4 is a unitary matrix that rotates the fixed basis into the basis of energy eigenstates . without any loss of generality we can assume that for some @xmath5 the matrix @xmath6 is diagonal , so that at this point the bases are identical . for @xmath7 also the hamiltonian written in both bases is diagonal , @xmath8 $ ] ( the subscript @xmath9 denotes here the parameter - dependent basis of the energy eigenstates ) . for any other point we can write then @xmath10 where @xmath11 is ( by definition ) for any @xmath12 a diagonal matrix . by this construction",
    "we see that the information about the energies is contained only in @xmath11 , while the information about the states @xmath13 only in @xmath14 ( we shall use this property also later in our discussion ) . in the regions of @xmath12 without any level crossing the states @xmath13 are _ continuous _ functions of @xmath12 . indeed , suppose that the system adiabatically follows @xmath15\\rangle$ ] , and while passing through some @xmath16 , the state changes discontinuously . since the states @xmath13 form a complete basis , @xmath17\\rangle$ ] is transformed into @xmath18\\rangle = \\sum_{m ' } b_{m ' } |\\bar{m'}[\\mathbf{r}(t_0 - \\delta t)]\\rangle $ ] .",
    "but then this process is equivalent to a discontinuous transition between different energy levels , which is excluded if the parameters are varied adiabatically . on the other hand",
    ", this observation tells us that if a level crossing occurs , such discontinuity can be encountered .",
    "another problem while approaching the level crossing seems to be the adiabaticity condition which is hard to satisfy there ( and for the energy separation close to zero implies infinitely slow variation of the parameters ) . to analyze this",
    "let us first consider two levels that cross at a point @xmath19 , which for convenience we will shift to the origin ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "the subspace of these two states can be characterized by a hamiltonian of spin-@xmath21 particle in external magnetic field , for which the energy eigenstates @xmath22 ( where @xmath23 are the spherical angles ) are separated by the energy difference @xmath24 , the strength of the magnetic field .",
    "the level crossing in this geometry corresponds to the point of zero field .",
    "we can now easily find the adiabaticity condition by going to a frame that rotates together with the direction of the magnetic field .",
    "the operator that rotates the frame is @xmath14 [ as defined in eq.([eq : tva ] ) ] , which in this case has the form @xmath25 the rotated hamiltonian @xmath26 for the two - level system reads @xmath27 the adiabatic theorem states that if the time variation of the parameters is slow enough , the off - diagonal elements of @xmath28 are negligible , and so the states precess around the instantaneous field direction with the frequency @xmath29 ( the second term gives rise to the berry phase ) .",
    "it should be also emphasized ( and usually is not ) that the fourier - transformed off - diagonal terms , @xmath30 can not have at @xmath31 too large amplitudes as compared to the inverse duration of the process @xmath32 ( this is the reason why in the stirap experiments , the pulses are usually chosen to be wide gaussians ) . for the purpose of evaluation , this condition can be written in the form    @xmath33    which together with @xmath34 gives the adiabatic theorem .",
    "a few comments should be made at this point .",
    "first of all , the estimate eq .",
    "( [ eq : bva ] ) is by no means less important than eq .",
    "( [ eq : cva ] ) .",
    "indeed , the rotated hamiltonian @xmath28 generates evolution in which the perturbative , off - diagonal terms may induce transitions between the states parallel and antiparallel to the direction of the magnetic field .",
    "this effect for different realizations of the field variation , but with the same order of magnitude of the off - diagonal terms in @xmath28 is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ evol ] . the only difference there is the dominant frequency in the fourier transform of these terms .",
    "in other words , all the realizations satisfy well the condition ( [ eq : cva ] ) , but only two of them the condition ( [ eq : bva ] ) , and only in these cases the spin really follows the field direction .",
    "+    moreover , in eq .",
    "( [ eq : cva ] ) the lhs is either dominated by @xmath24 or @xmath35 is too large to allow the condition to hold at all , and we can omit the term @xmath36 . to verify",
    "now whether for a given path ( which crosses a degeneracy point ) the adiabatic condition can be satisfied let us require the time dependence of the parameter variation to be constrained by @xmath37 where @xmath38 is a constant , i.e. we want the adiabatic theorem to be satisfied at each point of the path to the same extent .",
    "the path can be parametrized as @xmath39 we have the freedom to choose a reference point @xmath40 at the level crossing .",
    "the parametrization in eq .",
    "( [ eq : kva ] ) gives us all the information about the path along which the parameters vary , and our goal is to determine the time dependence of @xmath41 . equation ( [ eq : jva ] ) can be thus rewritten in the form @xmath42 the solution to this differential equation gives the unique answer to our question : if @xmath43 for finite @xmath44 , the adiabatic theorem can be satisfied at each point of the path ( down to the crossing point ) , otherwise it can not .    to illustrate the possible application of this result let us consider a special class of paths along which the magnetic field in the spin-@xmath21 scenario is varied .",
    "we define @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is some relevant time scale in the experiment ( e.g. its duration ) .",
    "this guarantees also that @xmath47 .",
    "the class of paths we consider is parametrized by a non - negative , real @xmath48 by defining @xmath49 ( the degeneracy is approached from the direction @xmath50 ) and constant @xmath51 .",
    "equation ( [ eq : mva ] ) then has the following solutions depending on the value of @xmath48 : @xmath52 clearly in the first case the states are time - independent and no mixing is possible . in the second case , in order to satisfy the adiabaticity condition we would have to approach the degeneracy infinitely long .",
    "@xmath53 is a critical value , above which the adiabaticity can indeed be satisfied by choosing the calculated time dependence of @xmath41 .",
    "the paths for various realizations are shown in fig .",
    "[ goodpath ] .",
    "one could ask now whether the results are applicable to higher - dimensional systems , in which some state can cross a degenerate level , two ( or more ) degenerate levels cross , or many levels cross at the same point . our reasoning is correct in all imaginable cases",
    ": we can consider all pairs of crossing states separately and verify whether transitions can be prevented within all of the pairs . at the same time",
    "well - known phenomena hold . for instance , transitions between states that remain degenerate during such `` insertion '' are still possible , and given by the wilczek - zee connection @xcite .",
    "more systematic explanation makes use of the property eq .",
    "( [ rotatedha ] ) .",
    "we can define the set of parameters @xmath54 which has a subset of parameters characterizing the matrix @xmath55 , i.e. , the energy differences between the levels .",
    "the second subset contains the angles parametrizing rotations in the hilbert space . using this property we rewrite eq .",
    "( [ rotatedha ] ) in a more general form as @xmath56 let us now consider two levels , @xmath13 and @xmath57 that cross at an isolated point @xmath20 ( i.e. for all points in the vicinity of @xmath19 the parameter @xmath58 is finite ) . in this setting @xmath58",
    "coincides with the radial component for @xmath59 .",
    "this parameter is crucial , as it defines the level crossing point , but we need to find all the other relevant parameters that could give rise to the mixing between the states . to do this let us consider a point @xmath60 which belongs to the path and is shifted by an infinitesimal vector @xmath61 from @xmath62 ( @xmath61 specifies the direction from which the degeneracy is approached ) . to evaluate the mixing term @xmath63 , and in the vicinity of @xmath64",
    "the other states can be simply ignored  indirect mixing , mediated by the other states is possible as the second ( and higher ) order process .",
    "the mixing term is , however , proportional to the first derivative of the states over the parameters and for sufficiently small ( in our case infinitesimal ) variations of the parameters the indirect mixing is irrelevant .",
    "furthermore , the two states can be conventionally ( and conveniently ) parametrized by two spherical angles @xmath65 , which together with @xmath58 are the only relevant parameters in our problem . by selecting only three parameters from the set",
    "@xmath66 we reduced the problem again to the two - state subspace behavior .",
    "now the angles parametrizing the states are perpendicular to ( independent of ) the radial component of the parameter space @xmath58 , and we arrive again at the adiabatic theorem in the form of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : bva ] ) and ( [ eq : cva ] )",
    ".    it might also happen that due to some symmetries the domain of degeneracy of the levels @xmath13 and @xmath57 has a finite dimensionality . in other words , @xmath67 can define a subspace @xmath68 , where @xmath69 .",
    "then our simple picture , in which we identify @xmath58 to be the radial component clearly fails .",
    "however , the path which we traverse is a one - dimensional subspace od @xmath2 , which close to @xmath19 can be embedded in a subspace @xmath70 tangential to @xmath71 at @xmath19 ( see fig .  [",
    "fi : manifold ] ) .",
    "the symmetry that is present in @xmath72 disappears in @xmath73 .",
    "furthermore we can treat @xmath73 as the actual control manifold ",
    "we formally put only one additional constraint on the system parameters , which reduces the number of degrees of freedom by one , but since the path is physically unchanged the physics of the process is not altered as well .",
    "thus the property ( [ rotatedha ] ) is still valid and our discussion for the isolated crossing point is again applicable .",
    "let us summarize shortly the observations that we have made up to now .",

    "the result in eq .",
    "( [ result ] ) is general , and for distinct levels is expressed simply by the product of dynamical and geometric contributions . in such cases the ordinary adiabaticity condition holds .",
    "if the path begins ( ends ) at crossing points we need to examine whether for a given path the adiabaticity condition can be satisfied , and if it can , evaluate the connections between ( but not exactly at ) the initial and the final point ( due to discontinuity of the states ) . as shown above , if the path is `` adiabatic , '' the adiabatic connections [ eq .  ( [ eq : bwa ] ) ] are valid arbitrarily close to the crossing points .",

    "for arbitrary adiabatically traversed path in the parameters space the resulting transformation can be obtained by dividing the path into pieces that begin and end at crossing points , evaluating the partial transformations according to eq .",
    "( [ result ] ) , and eventually multiplying the obtained transformations .    to conclude our analysis",
    "let us discuss briefly the nature of aforementioned discontinuity at the level crossing .",
    "it follows clearly from the degeneracy of the states involved , which gives the freedom to choose an orthogonal energy eigenbasis .",
    "however , if discussed in a basis of a different observable , its spectrum does not need to be degenerate at this point . if , in particular , the basis which we introduced at the beginning ",
    "the parameter - independent basis @xmath86  is an eigenbasis of an operator that has all eigenvalues different at the level crossing , amplitudes at the states @xmath87 can not change abruptly .",
    "moreover , the process under discussion is instantaneous ( we already know what happens before and after we reach the crossing point ) .",
    "probably the most practical indication of how the system should evolve while passing through the crossing points give then the conservation laws .",
    "so , unless there is some abrupt disturbance of the system parameters , during this infinitesimal time interval quantities that are conserved define the `` good '' bases in which amplitudes are continuous .",
    "to illustrate how our results apply to real physical systems , let us consider a three - level atom with internal energy levels @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and @xmath90 [ see fig .",

    "[ fi : stirap](b ) ] .",
    "certainly , since the laser frequency is very close to the level separation , the process is not adiabatic in the laboratory frame , but after going over to the rotating frame ( in which the amplitudes absorb the phases resulting from the internal level separation ) . in this frame",
