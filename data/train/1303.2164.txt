    "cesium telluride ( cs@xmath0te ) has been known since the 1950-s as an exceptionally high quantum efficiency photoemissive material @xcite , it can turn as much as @xmath220% of the incident ultraviolet photons into emitted electrons @xcite .",
    "cesium telluride also has the advantage of relatively long operational lifetime , 20 - 30 times longer than that of competing multi - alkali antimonide photocathodes , such as k@xmath0cssb and ( cs)na@xmath3ksb . while k@xmath0cssb and",
    "( cs)na@xmath3ksb require ultrahigh vacuum for operation , cs@xmath0te can operate in orders of magnitudes lower levels of vacuum @xcite . in order to further enhance the photoemissive properties of cs@xmath0te for certain applications",
    ", modifications are required that decrease its workfunction from the @xmath23.0 ev down to the visible light spectrum ( 1.5 - 3.0 ev ) while preserving its high quantum efficiency .",
    "such modifications can lead to , for example , for high brightness electron guns @xcite , better pulse shaping of the incident photons in the visible spectrum and eliminating the need for wavelength down - conversion .",
    "wavelength down - conversion is used to convert the typically near - infrared photons of the laser source to ultraviolet wavelength which causes a great loss of the intensity of the initial laser - beam .",
    "one possible way to an improved photoemissive material that we recently proposed @xcite is the acetylation of cs@xmath0te leading to cs@xmath0tec@xmath0 , a new member of the existing family of ternary acetylide @xcite compounds .",
    "electronic structure calculations predict that the new cs@xmath0tec@xmath0 and other , existing ternary acetylides , such as cs@xmath0pdc@xmath0 would have similarly high quantum efficiencies as cs@xmath0te , but significantly lower , 2.0 - 2.4 ev workfunctions .",
    "an alternative route to the acetylation in developing improved photoemissive analogues / derivatives of cs@xmath0te might be in the exploration of photoemissive properties of other cs - te phases .",
    "a comprehensive review of alkali tellurides by d. m. smith and j. a. ibers @xcite called our attention to cs@xmath0te@xmath1 , an existing @xcite crystalline phase of cs and te .",
    "remarkably , the te@xmath4 polytelluride anions in cs@xmath0te@xmath1 self organize to @xmath2 4  wide wavy ribbons of te with continuous covalent te - te networks , which are embedded into a cs matrix , such as shown in fig .",
    "[ cs2tec5unitcell ] . in the wavy te - ribbons , six - membered rings of te in chair - conformation",
    "are connected via common vortices into quasi 1d chains , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ te - ribbon ] .",
    "these quasi 1d substructures of cs@xmath0te@xmath1 resemble the rod - like polymeric [ -te - c@xmath5c-]@xmath6 substructures that are responsible for the improved photoemissive properties of cs@xmath0tec@xmath0 .",
    "this structural analogy directed our attention towards the computational analysis of cs@xmath0te@xmath1 to check whether it can potentially serve as an improvement to cs@xmath0te and ternary acetylides .",
    "the electronic structure calculations in the present study have been carried out using the quantum espresso program package @xcite .",
    "the pbe exchange - correlation potential @xcite has been used with norm - conserving cs and te pseudopotentials identical to those in our study for cs@xmath0tec@xmath0 in ref . .",
    "the wavefunction - cutoff was @xmath7 rydbergs .",
    "the k - space grids were at least 6@xmath86@xmath86 large for optimizations , the residual forces on fractional coordinates were less than @xmath9 ry / au , residual pressure on the unit cell less than 1 kbar .",
    "the application of these pseudopotentials has been validated on known properties ( structure and workfunction ) of crystalline cs , te and cs@xmath0te .",
    "this method provides a=9.719 , b=12.178 and c=10.407  for the calculated lattice parameters of cs@xmath0te@xmath1 , while the experimental ones @xcite are a=9.373 , b=12.288 and c=10.140  , an agreement within 3.5% .",
    "there are two different te - te bond lengths in cs@xmath0te@xmath1 : the calculated values are 2.845 and 3.090  , the experimental ones are 2.765 and 3.049  , respectively , an agreement within 3% .",
    "experimental and calculated lattice angles are all 90@xmath10 .",
    "optical absorption spectra have been calculated in the random phase approximation ( rpa ) as implemented in the yambo @xcite code , the spectra were calculated using a gradually increased number of planewaves and interaction block - size until convergence at 20000 plane waves and an interaction block size of 403 . for comparison ,",
    "data for cs@xmath0te and cs@xmath0tec@xmath0 have been taken from ref . .",
    "the workfunction calculations were based on slabs of at least 30  width separated by vacuum layers up to 30  following the methodology of ref . .",
    "only the top and bottom two layers were relaxed while middle layers were kept at the bulk optimum structures .",
    "the two most important crystal surfaces of cs@xmath0te@xmath1 that do not cleave the polytelluride anions and have miller indices of ( 010 ) and ( 110 ) have been considered .",
    "the cleavage of polytelluride anions is energetically unfavored and would lead to a plethora of possible surface reconstructions . to estimate the strength of the simplest such cleavage , properties of the ( 001 ) surface have also been calculated .",
    "for the ( 010 ) surfaces , two different cleavages have been modeled , ( 010)-c1 and ( 010)-c2 . the ( 110 ) and ( 010)-c1 surface slabs have identical top and bottom surfaces , while the ( 010)-c2 surfaces are not identical",

    "it indicates a band gap of 0.19 ev , i.e. a small bandgap semiconductor material .",

    "[ cs2te5optabs ] and are compared to those of cs@xmath0te and cs@xmath0tec@xmath0 . the small gap value and the strong absorption at low photon energies appears to be consistent with the experimentally observed `` metallic grey '' color @xcite of cs@xmath0te@xmath1 .",
    "the workfunction values for several important crystallographic surfaces of cs@xmath0te@xmath1 are listed in table [ workfunctions ] .",
    "it is apparent that the lowest workfunction belongs to the cs@xmath0te@xmath1(010)-c2 surface with fully cs - covered polytelluride ribbons .",
    "the other surfaces have much greater workfunctions , in the 3.2 - 3.5 ev range or even above for the cs@xmath0te@xmath1(001 ) cleavage . also note that cleaving the polytelluride ribbons results in a relatively large surface energy , i.e. it is energetically very unfavorable as compared to the other cleavages .    comparing the workfunction value of @xmath2 1.90 ev for the cs - rich one of the cs@xmath0te@xmath1(010)-c2 surfaces to the optical absorption spectra in fig .",
    "[ cs2te5optabs ] one can see a very strong absorption at 1.9 ev .",
    "this means that if this surface can be realized , it will have not only a significantly ( by more than 1 ev ) reduced workfunction , but also an even higher optical absorption than cs@xmath0te , and as a consequence its quantum yield may be higher than that of cs@xmath0te . at the same time , cs@xmath0te@xmath1 is just a two - component material and its synthesis is readily available from the literature @xcite .",
    "it is however also to be noted that the surface energy differences between the ( 010 ) and ( 110 ) surfaces are very small , making it difficult to realize the cs - covered cs@xmath0te@xmath1(010)-c2 cleavage without coexisting presence of other surfaces . since large single crystals can be grown of cs@xmath0te@xmath1 as reported in ref .",
    ", the suitable cleavage of them could deliver the required surface .",
    "since the cs@xmath0te@xmath1 material is relatively soft due to the weak interaction between te - ribbons and the small cleavage energy between cs - covered te - ribbons , it may also be deposited along these easy - to - cleave surfaces by rubbing larger crystals of cs@xmath0te@xmath1 to the substrate surface , similarly to deposition of graphite .",
    "bandgaps of the surface slabs at the @xmath15-point differ somewhat from the bulk - value ( 0.19 ev ) in the range of @xmath2 0.037 - 0.360 ev , being smallest for the lowest workfunction cs@xmath0te@xmath1(010)-c2 slab .",
    "while the acetylated cs@xmath0te , i.e. cs@xmath0tec@xmath0 , shows very anisotropic workfunction values , surface energies and optical absorptions ( a factor of 9 optical absorption differences @xcite ) , the degree of anisotropy is somewhat smaller for cs@xmath0te@xmath1 , where optical absorptions may differ by a factor of two in the visible spectral range .",
    "in the present study we have computationally analyzed bulk and surface properties of cs@xmath0te@xmath1 , an existing @xcite crystalline phase of the cs - te system , in order to search for alternatives of cs@xmath0te in the cs - te system with reduced workfunctions and high quantum efficiency . we have found that the fully cs - covered cs@xmath0te@xmath1(010)-c2 surface has a workfunction of @xmath2 1.9 ev and a quantum efficiency that is higher than that of cs@xmath0te , both at the respective workfunction values . since large single crystals of cs@xmath0te@xmath1 can be produced as described in ref .",
    ", this prediction can be validated experimentally , and cs@xmath0te@xmath1 can become a practical alternative to cs@xmath0te for photophysical applications .",
