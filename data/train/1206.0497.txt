    "the white - light continuum of a solar flare ( wlf ) was the first manifestation of a flare ever detected @xcite .",
    "nevertheless its origin has remained enigmatic over the intervening centuries .",
    "this continuum contains a large fraction of the total luminous energy of a flare ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and so its identification has always posed an important problem for solar and stellar physics . although the most obvious flare effects appear in the chromosphere and corona , the physics of the lower solar atmosphere has great significance for the reasons described by neidig .",
    "the association of white - light continuum with the impulsive phase of a solar flare has long been known , and cited as an indication that high - energy nonthermal particles have penetrated deep into the lower solar atmosphere @xcite .",
    "such an association would link the acceleration of `` solar cosmic rays , '' as they were then known , with the intense energy release of the impulsive phase , and this association has proven to be crucial to our understanding of flare physics @xcite . because the continuum appears in the emission spectrum , and because this nominally originates in an optically - thick source , this energy release may drastically distort the structure of the lower solar atmosphere during a flare . accordingly the usual methods for modeling the atmosphere ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which assume hydrostatic equilibrium , may be too simple .",
    "the association with hard x - ray bremsstrahlung has always suggested @xmath710  kev electrons in particular @xcite . according to the standard thick - target model the primary particle acceleration occurs in the corona above the flare sources .",
    "the presence of fast electrons automatically implicates the chromosphere as well , rather than the photosphere , because of the relatively short collisional ranges of such particles .",
    "nevertheless the indirect nature of the bremsstrahlung emission mechanism ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) has made it difficult to rule out other processes , such as energy transport by protons @xcite .",
    "the bremsstrahlung signature may also result from acceleration directly in the lower atmosphere , rather than in the corona @xcite .",
    "finally radiative backwarming could also provide a mechanism for explaining for the observed tight correlation of hard x - rays and white - light continuum @xcite .",
    "this mechanism involves irradiation and heating of the photosphere , rather than the chromosphere , as would correspond to the shorter stopping distance of energetic electrons in a thick - target model @xcite .    in the modern era we are seeing a rapid increase in our understanding of these processes , thanks to the excellent new data from various spacecraft and ground - based observatories .",
    "this paper reports on a first good example of a flare near the limb , observed at high resolution both in hard x - rays by _ rhessi _ , and at 6173    in the visible continuum by the _ solar dynamics observatory ( sdo ) _ spacecraft via its helioseismic magnetic imager ( hmi ) instrument @xcite .",
    "this event , sol2011 - 02 - 24t07:35 ( m3.5 ) , occurred just inside the limb ( noaa coordinates n14e87 ) , so that source heights could be compared by simple projection .",
    "we analyze data from _ rhessi _ , hmi , and the extreme ultraviolet imager ( euvi ) on _ stereo - b)_. have already studied this flare , using the same data but without reference to the _ stereo - b _ observations .",
    "the flare we study here ( figure  [ fig : footpoints ] ) occurred close to the geocentric east limb .",
    "both hard x - rays and white - light emission come clearly from the visible hemisphere , as we establish below via the use of stereo - b / euvi images .",
    "figure  [ fig : footpoints ] shows the hmi intensity continuum difference image at 07:31:13.40  ut , with the reference image constructed as the average of hmi data from 07:25 - 07:28  ut . the white - light contrast and area for this m3.5 flare are consistent with the trends found in surveys based on _ yohkoh _ , _ trace _ , and _ hinode _ observations , respectively .    the emission time series ( figure  [ fig : ts ] ) shows the timing behavior of hard x - ray and soft x - ray emissions typical of white - light flares ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and ( again typically ) we find a close match between the hard x - ray and white - light variations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the time series show white - light differences relative to a pre - flare reference interval ( 07:25 - 07:28  ut ) .",
    "the gradually increasing disagreement between the two footpoint light curves is the behavior expected for base - difference images in the presence of normal photospheric variability , which has time scales of minutes due to p - modes and granulation .",
    "we determined the locations of the hard x - ray ( hxr ) sources by using the rhessi visibilities - based forward fitting procedure , using data for the same 45-s time interval as observed by hmi .",
    "we used a single 30 - 80  kev energy interval for simplicity and assumed a circular gaussian model for each of the two bright sources .",
    "the application of least - squares fitting then yielded the best - fit centroid coordinates of the two footpoints with statistical errors .",
    "these positions have statistical errors @xmath8  0.16@xmath1 .",
    "systematic errors in these positions come only from the rhessi telescope metrology , which we believe to be substantially better than the statistical errors @xcite .",
    "since the uncertainty of the centroid position of the forward - fit model is smaller than its fitted size , there is the possibility of systematic error if the true source shape is not well - approximated by a circular gaussian .",
    "thus , in addition to the forward - fit image locations , we have separately characterized the source positions via the distribution of clean component sources , which does not require the assumption of a specific model .",
    "this check shows excellent consistency for the source centroids .    for the position of the white - light continuum sources , we have used the full - disk hmi image as a reference , fitting its limb via a standard inflection - point method .",
    "since the flare occurred near the limb , this greatly reduces the error in radial position due to any uncertainty in the hmi image properties , such as platescale .",
    "we adopt the limb correction described by @xcite to relate this measurement to the height of the photosphere ( r@xmath9 ) ; the mean of their two methods gives 498  km for the altitude separation , and we adopt 18  km to represent the uncertainty of this number . at the time of the observation described here , sdo was near its antisolar point , and we have made the correction to geocentric perspective .",
    "the images in figure  [ fig : footpoints ] show good agreement in the radial coordinates of the source centroids in hard x - rays and white light .",
    "we have made a small _ ad hoc _ roll adjustment for the hmi observations , which has no effect on the source heights because of the foreshortening .",
    "table  [ tab : big ] summarizes the data from the three spacecraft and our estimates of uncertainties .",
    "the stereo entries characterize the heliographic ( stonyhurst ) coordinates of the two footpoint sources , and serve to locate the projected position of the sub - flare photosphere on the hmi and rhessi images .",
    "the rhessi positions include an estimate of the apparent source displacement due to scattering albedo , based on the monte carlo simulations of . in our observations , the primary and albedo sources would merge together , with a centroid slightly lower ( closer to disk center ) than the position of the primary source ( see figure  4 in * ? ? ?",
    "* for an example ) .",
    "the anisotropy of the primary emission is likely to be small ; in principle large anisotropies could lead to larger albedo corrections . at the extreme limb these simulations",
    "are not complete , since they do not incorporate photospheric rough structure ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this co - alignment analysis differs from that in fig .",
    "2 of , as the result of a different interpretation of the image metadata , and the overlay shown here is correct ( m. battaglia & e. kontar , personal communication 2011 ) .",
    ".source positions [ cols=\"<,<,<,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : big ]    @xmath10 sun center [ 1035.77 , 1051.13 ] px ( measured )    @xmath11 y pixel range 1205 - 1208    @xmath12 y pixel range 1196 - 1201",
    "the proximity of the flare to the limb means that we can compare its central distance ( the root - sum - square of its angular position coordinates ) to the projected position of the photosphere , at the flare s heliographic location , to estimate the absolute source height .",
    "we were fortunate in that this flare was observed near disk center by _ stereo - b _",
    ", then at a spacecraft heliolongitude of @xmath1394.5@xmath14 .",
    "the heliographic coordinates of the flare footpoints can not be well determined from a geocentric perspective ( _ rhessi , sdo _ ) because of the extreme foreshortening , but this is minimal for the _ stereo - b _ view .",
    "one euv ( 195   ) image ( figure  [ fig : stereo_b ] ) was taken during the integration time of the wl image shown in figure  [ fig : footpoints ] .",
    "this 8-s euvi image was saturated in about 16 of the columns of the ccd containing the flare itself .",
    "the bright hard x - ray sources correspond to the southern two of the saturation regions , and a fainter hxr source , not detected in white light , lies to the north of these footpoint sources .    on each column of the ccd that is saturated",
    ", the excess charge should spread equally in both directions ( m. waltham , personal communication 2011 ) .",
    "thus , to a first approximation , the mean row on each column ( horizontal in the raw image ) give the centroid of the image brightness on that column .",
    "for the set of columns associated with each of the footpoints , we therefore estimate the heliographic coordinates and their uncertainties ( table  [ tab : big ] ) from the scatter of the data .",
    "these coordinates agree , to within a few arcsec , with the positions of the wl and hxr sources ( see figure  [ fig : footpoints ] ) .",
    "the component of the uncertainty in the radial direction is small , as described below in the height measurement , because of the foreshortening .",
    "the geometrical assumption here is that the heliographic coordinates of the euv and hard x - ray sources coincide , as they do in the impulsive phase of a flare ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we also implicitly assume that the euv source is at zero height ; we checked the uncertainty resulting from this systematic term and incorporate it in the height measurements .",
    "the result of these calculations give us a height for the northern and southern hxr sources of @xmath15 and @xmath16  km respectively with an uncertainty of @xmath17  km in both cases .",
    "the height of the intensity continuum sources was of @xmath18 and @xmath19  km for the northern and southern sources , with uncertainties of @xmath20  km for both measurements .",
    "these results are shown schematically in figure  [ fig : arrows ] .",
    "we note several other unknowns present in this procedure : the euv and hxr sources may not actually have coincided in heliographic position ; the images are not exactly cotemporal , since the euv image has only an 8-s exposure time , so source variability could contribute to misalignment ; finally , although impulsive - phase euv and hxr sources can coincide precisely , some do not ( see references in * ? ? ?",
    "we mention these items for completeness but note that the extreme foreshortening minimizes their significance in this analysis .",
    "kev ) , and black points the white - light sources .",
    "the horizontal solid line with error bar is the zero point of the height measurement , set at the projected position of the corresponding stereo sources .",
    "the two dashed lines show the @xmath5 points for compton scattering opacity ( red ) and a scaled optical opacity ( black ) .",
    "the heights and their uncertainties for the ( n , s ) footpoints are @xmath21  km for hxr , and @xmath22  km for wl .",
    ", scaledwidth=47.0% ]    figure  [ fig : arrows ] shows the computed height of unit optical depth to compton scattering at about 350  km .",
    "we estimated this from the 1d semi - empirical models of @xcite , taking the compton cross - section at 40  kev , a slightly higher energy than the 30  kev threshold for our hxr imaging .",
    "in such a simple model atmosphere , we would not expect appreciable hxr emission to be detectable .",
    "note that this consideration would not affect the albedo source expected from a higher - altitude source , such as that implied by the thick - target model .",
    "figure  [ fig : arrows ] also shows an estimate of the height of unit optical depth for the white - light continuum , derived here just as a scaling from the quantities at the limb .",
    "in this study we have compared hard x - ray and white - light observations of a limb flare , sol201 - 02 - 24t07:35:00 .",
    "the relative positions of the sources agree well , for each of the double - footpoint sources ; since the local vertical maps almost exactly onto the solar radial coordinate , this means that the source heights match well .",
    "our uncertainties on this centroid matching are of order 0.2@xmath1 .",
    "this result strongly associates the white - light continuum with the collisional losses of the non - thermal electrons observed via bremsstrahlung hard x - rays in the impulsive phase of the flare .",
    "we have also used the euvi data in the 195    band from _ stereo - b _ to determine the heliographic coordinates of the flare footpoints , from a near - vertical vantage point . to our knowledge , this enables the first direct determination of the absolute height of a white - light flare and its associated hard x - ray sources .",
    "surprisingly , our estimates lie close to ( if not below ) the projected heights of optical depth unity for both 40  kev hard x - rays and for optical continuum at 6173   .",
    "they also lie well below the expected penetration depth of the @xmath650-kev electrons needed to produce the hard x - rays ( about 800  km for the fontenla et al .",
    "quiet - sun atmosphere , vs. 200 - 400  km as observed ) . at present",
    "we have no explanation for this striking result and do not speculate about it , because it depends upon only a single flare event .",
    "we are sure that there are other comparable events in the existing data and hope to see a generalization of these results based on similar analyses .",
