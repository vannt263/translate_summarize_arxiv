    ", the existence of a genuine steady state is very promising to build a thermodynamic - like theoretical description of the system .",
    "in that context , it is crucial to determine whether the steady state is independent on the history of the process , or in other words , whether it is a real _ state _ in a thermodynamic sense @xcite .",
    "it is well known that when drainage and imbibition occur successively , the relative permeabilities become history dependent and the pressure - saturation curves display an hysteresis @xcite , the underlying pore - scale mechanisms of which are known .",
    "besides in the well - known magnetic and elastic systems , such history dependence and hysteresis has also been observed in different flow processes like hydrodynamic heat flow @xcite and particle flow through random media @xcite .",
    "however , in the case of two - phase flow through porous media , it is not trivial to predict whether such an hysteresis will come into play in the steady - state situation when drainage and imbibition occur simultaneously .",
    "it was proposed that a thermodynamic - like description for simultaneous two - phase flow in porous media can be sketched @xcite if the flow was history independent .    here , we present an extensive experimental and numerical study in order to investigate the history - independence of the steady state .",

    "the latter is dyed in black with 0.1% negrosine to obtain a good contrast on the experimental images ( see figure [ flowimage ] ) . as pointed out by tallakstad _",
    "_ , the use of air as one of the phases introduces more complexity in the two - phase flow problem for two reasons : first , it yields a high viscosity contrast with the glycerol solution , and second , its compressibility gives rise to rapid bursts or avalanches @xcite .",

    "each of these phases gives rise to a peak on the gray - scale image histogram ( see figure [ flowimage](c ) ) .",

    "immediately after we change the flow rate to the value @xmath56 , both pressure drops display a very rapid increase , and a new steady - state ( @xmath42 ) , characterized by higher values of @xmath55 , is quickly established . when we change the flow rate back to @xmath39 , we observe again a rapid variation of the pressure drops towards a third plateau defining steady - state 3 ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "because experiments are performed at slow flow rates , and to obtain enough statistics on the measurements , they must typically run for several days .",
    "indeed , the quality of the statistics is determined by the ratio @xmath57 of the total volume of fluids injected into the system to the total pore volume of the porous matrix , namely :    @xmath58    where @xmath9 denotes the total flow rate , @xmath32 denotes time and @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath51 and @xmath5 are the width , length , thickness and porosity of the porous matrix , respectively .",

    "it is necessary to refill the syringes one or several times in the course of an experiment .",
    "this is systematically performed using the following protocol : the outlet and inlets of the model are closed and the syringe pump is stopped immediately .",
    "the refilling process takes approximately 20 minutes . because the vents used to close the model are not perfectly air - proof , the pressure in the system relaxes towards atmospheric pressure during this process , explaining the sudden drop of @xmath55 observed on figure [ pressresults](c )",
    "however , by looking at the pictures recorded throughout the process , we have checked that this does not affect the flow structure , which remains immobile over the duration of the refilling procedure .",
    "furthermore , we observe that once the syringe pump is restarted , @xmath55 retrieves its initial value after a delay originating from the compressibility of air .",
    "thus this refilling procedure does not affect the results of the experiments . in the following ,",
    "when necessary , we distinguish steady states obtained before and after refiling using the subscripts a and b , respectively ( see figure [ pressresults](c ) ) .",
    "figure [ pressuredrops ] shows the temporal evolution of the pressure drops @xmath62 and @xmath63 for the 6 experiments listed in table [ expparams ] . in all cases ,",
    "we observe a behavior similar to what has been described in the previous section , namely rapid variations of @xmath55 upon changes of flow rate between plateaus characterizing steady states .",
    "most importantly , we observe that whatever the value and sign of @xmath64 , the pressure drops are similar in @xmath40 and @xmath43 .",
    "this suggests that the steady - state pressure drop @xmath65 only depends on the imposed flow rate , and not on the history of the system .",
    "note also that for a given flow rate , @xmath66 values are reproducible from one experiment to the next , regardless of how steady state has been reached .",
    ".,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    to obtain a quantitative indication of this history - independence , we compute average steady - state pressure drop values @xmath67 over the duration of each steady - state , thus over periods of time corresponding to the injection of 0.3 to 1.4 pore volumes in the system , as already indicated earlier . for each experiment",
    ", we compare the variation of @xmath68 between @xmath40 and @xmath43 to the fluctuations of @xmath65 within these two states .",
    "for this we compute the ratio :    @xmath69    where @xmath70 represents a temporal average over the duration of a steady - state and @xmath71 are the standard deviations of @xmath65 in @xmath40 and @xmath43 .",
    "the values of @xmath72 computed from the inlet and middle pressure drops for the different experiments are reported in table [ expparams ] . as can be observed ,",
    "almost all of these values are smaller than one .",
    "slightly higher values are observed in exp.3 and exp.4 .",
    "however , our experimental temperature data suggests that temperature - induced viscosity fluctuations most likely explain this fact .",
    "indeed , the largest temperature variations both between @xmath40 and @xmath43 and within @xmath40 or @xmath43 occur for these two experiments .",
    "therefore , we find that within the precision of our measurements , the steady - state pressure drop values are history - independent .",
    "pressure measurements suggest that the observed steady - state only depends on the imposed flow rate .",
    "however , these measurements do not give us detailed spatial information .",
    "thus , we now analyze the images of steady - state flow patterns .",
    "as explained earlier ( see figure [ flowimage ] ) , the flow structure consists of clusters of the non - wetting phase , air , surrounded by the wetting viscous water - glycerol solution . as air clusters are transported through the porous medium , they are fragmented or merged , giving many different realizations of the flow pattern .",
    "however , within steady - state , the saturation and the size distribution of air clusters remain constant on average @xcite .",
    "thus , similarly to what we have done for pressure drops , we compute average steady - state saturations and cluster size distributions and compare their properties in @xmath40 and @xmath43 . to obtain a good statistics on these quantities , we have chosen the frame rates so that successive images sample different realizations of the flow pattern .",
    "all averages are computed over series of images , typically 100 , spanning a time range corresponding to the injection of @xmath73 of the pore volume at the minimum .    .",
    "note that no image processing has been applied before obtaining these histograms .",
    "data for steady - states @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 are represented in black , blue and red , respectively .",

    ", scaledwidth=50.0% ]    as explained in section [ section - setup ] , the gray - scale histograms of the raw images give us a direct indication of the proportion of the two phases in the system , thus of saturation ( see figure [ flowimage ] ) .",
    "figure [ rawhistos ] shows average steady state histograms for the 6 experiments listed in table [ expparams ] .",
    "it is clear on all these graphs that the histograms corresponding to @xmath40 and @xmath43 can be distinguished from those corresponding to @xmath42 : indeed , as expected , the saturation depends on the flow rate , as reflected by different air and liquid `` peak '' heights on the histograms .",
    "however , histograms are similar in @xmath40 and @xmath43 , suggesting that the steady - state saturation is also history - independent .",
    "it is important to note that histograms are directly obtained from raw images without prior processing , which excludes eventual artifacts due to image processing .",
    "however , they do not give us any information about the spatial repartition of the two phases in the system .    to obtain this information , we process the images to identify air clusters and compute their size distributions . image processing is performed using imagej  @xcite .",
    "raw images are thresholded to obtain binary ( black and white ) images on which we run a standard particle analysis algorithm to identify air clusters and measure their sizes @xmath92 . from steady - state images ,",
    "we compute the normalized probability density functions of @xmath92 , _ i.e",
    ", _ non - wetting cluster size distributions @xmath93 , where @xmath94 represents an average over a series of @xmath95 images .     computed from steady - state images .",

    "these distributions typically display a power - law - like behavior with a cutoff at large cluster sizes @xcite . as mentioned by tallakstad _",
    "@xcite , the obtained distribution is affected by threshold values , which must thus be carefully chosen using visual inspection . here , we focus on the variations of the distribution with the history of the system .",
    "therefore , the most important requirement is that the image processing procedure is used consistently throughout one experiment . to avoid possible bias due to variations of illumination in the room ,",
    "the experimental setup is isolated behind a dark curtain .",
    "the camera exposure time and aperture are the same for all experiments , and we use the same thresholding parameters , carefully chosen by visual inspection , for all experiments .",
    "this allows us to compare images obtained in @xmath40 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 for a given experiment and from one experiment to the other in a meaningful way .",
    "similarly to what we observed for the histograms , it is possible to distinguish the @xmath40 and @xmath43 distributions from those corresponding to @xmath42 ( see figure [ distribs ] ) .",
    "this is coherent with the results of previous studies indicating that distributions are shifting towards higher clusters sizes when increasing the flow rate @xcite .",
    "however , the @xmath40 and @xmath96 distributions are similar , meaning that the steady - state non - wetting cluster size distributions are history - independent . we have checked that whereas varying the threshold values affects the distributions , typically by shifting then towards lower or higher cluster sizes , it does not modify the results in terms of history independence .",

    "the simulation can go forever , regardless of whether one fluid percolates or not .",
    "however , in order to keep the flow going , the global pressure gradient is maintained by considering an invisible cut through the system in terms of the pressure .",
    "since the system is closed with this boundary condition , the individual fluid volumes remain constant throughout the simulation .",
    "the non - wetting saturation @xmath22 is therefore an independent parameter here , along with the total flow rate @xmath9 , whereas the non wetting fractional flow @xmath117 fluctuates over time .",

    "@xmath173 is averaged over different configurations in the steady state and different samples of the network . in figures",
    "[ cd_bp ] and [ cd_ob ] , @xmath93 is plotted in log - log scale for bp and ob respectively , for different simulations .",
    "for all the simulations , we find that the cluster size distributions are identical for @xmath137 and @xmath139 whereas they are different from @xmath138 .",
    "distributions for the same @xmath29 for different simulations are also the same , showing that the steady - state cluster size distributions are history independent .",
    "in this article we have considered the question of history dependence in the steady - state two - phase flow in porous media and presented detailed experimental and numerical investigations in this context .",
    "experimentally , a quasi two - dimensional laboratory model consisting a hele - shaw cell filled with glass beads is considered , through which two phases , a gas - liquid pair with a viscosity ratio @xmath17 flows at constant flow rate .",
    "the system is allowed to evolve to a steady - state where the global pressure drop fluctuates around a constant average value .",
    "steady - states corresponding to the same control parameters ( e.g. capillary number ) are attained from different initial conditions . in order to characterize the complex flow patterns in the steady - state , the gray - scale histogram of snapshots and the non - wetting cluster size distributions are analyzed . the system is then modeled numerically by a network of disordered pores transporting two immiscible fluids .",
    "steady - state situation in the network model is attained implementing two different boundary conditions , the toroidal one with constant saturation and the open boundary with constant fractional flow , similar to the experiments .",
    "the global pressure drop , distribution of non - wetting pore saturation over the network and the cluster size distributions are computed .",
    "both the experimental and numerical results show that when both the fluids are flowing in the steady state , different measurements corresponding to the same control parameters are identical , no matter how the steady - state has been reached .",
    "thus , unlike the transients , the steady - states only depend on the external parameters , but do not depend on the initial preparation of the system or the history of the process .",
    "we therefore conclude that , within the range of parameters explored in this study , the steady states in simultaneous flow of two phases through porous medium are history independent .",
