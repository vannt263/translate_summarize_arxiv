    "in the preceding article @xcite we have calculated the probability of the tube fission in one and many points . here",
    "we apply the obtained expressions to the calculation of the inclusive spectra ( is ) of primary hadrons produced in soft processes .",
    "our approach to the tube fragmentation into hadrons is close to artru- menessier model @xcite ( as well as other models @xcite-@xcite based on artru - menessier approach ) . in our model @xcite-@xcite at each stage of hadronization process the tube splits into pieces with arbitrary masses until the distance between the @xmath1 and @xmath2 walls of piece becomes of the order of thickness of the wall .",
    "this causes growth of the kink mass and rapid decrease of the probability of the tube fission and therefore the hadronization process stops .",
    "the produced pieces are of the length @xmath3 , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the kink mass and tube tension respectively .",
    "the piece is are proportional to the probability of the tube breaking in two ( and more ) points that forms the piece with the light cone momentum @xmath6 and @xmath7 , mass @xmath8 and transverse momentum @xmath9 .",
    "the usual mass shell condition @xmath10 eliminates @xmath7 and we must calculate probability of the tube breaking in two or / and more points with the conditions for the light cone coordinates of piece edges @xmath11 etc .",
    "the obtained probabilities depend on @xmath6 as well as on the piece transverse mass squared , i.e. the breaking mechanism fully describes the is of pieces ( see the ref .",
    "@xcite-@xcite ) .    since far we are interested only in the @xmath6 -dependence of",
    "is the @xmath12 dependence must be integrated and we obtain the condition @xmath13 thatgreately simplifies the calculations .",
    "usually the rhs of this condition is taken equal to zero , neglecting all mass corrections .",
    "however , the mass of the piece plays an important role having influence on the value of the corresponding probability .",
    "we shell return to the mass corrections later .",
    "when the mass corrections are neglected , the piece mass is not well defined that the pieces can be attributed to stable hadrons ( pions and kaons ) as well as hadron resonances .",
    "in other words , the piece with the flavor quantum numbers @xmath14 and @xmath15 of a kink and antikink has the probability @xmath16 to be in state @xmath17 , which is the stable hadron or resonance .",
    "the advantage of this concept is that all corrections necessary for including an additional resonances and final state interactions , can be implemented quite naturally ( see for example refs .",
    "@xcite-@xcite ) .",
    "we assume that the primary mesons are pseudoscalar and vector particles , neglecting temporarily the diquark and other type of @xmath18 production that can be introduced in the same way ( for a more complete discussion we refer to ref.@xcite -@xcite )    the article is organized as follows .",
    "first , we calculate the is of the pieces that have fixed quark quantum numbers on the edges .",
    "the primary hadron is then are built from the is of pieces , using the quark flavor composition of hadrons .",
    "we take into account only @xmath19 and @xmath20 quarks .",
    "the probabilities @xmath21 and @xmath22 of the @xmath23 and @xmath24 quark production are taken the same @xmath25 and the ( rare ) strange quark creation probability @xmath26 is assumed to be sufficiently smal .",
    "we have @xmath27 . in the next section",
    "we calculate the one particle inclusive spectra ( opis ) of pieces .",
    "the two particle inclusive spectra ( tpis ) of pieces and corresponding correlation functions ( cf ) are considered in sec.3 .",
    "the pseudoscalar and vector meson primary is are calculated in sec.4.in conclusion we summarize and discuss the obtained results .",
    "here we calculate inclusive spectra of primary hadrons created by fission of a tube with small surface oscillations . we limit ourselves with particles with @xmath6 small in comparison with the momentum of initial tube @xmath28 ( but @xmath29 ) .",
    "we restrict ourselves with is integrated over transverse momenta and neglect mass corrections .",
    "first we consider the one - particle is ( opis ) .",
    "let us begin with the case of one type of @xmath30 , that is , where we detect the primary hadrons of any quantum numbers .",
    "the procedure of one - particle is calculation is the following",
    ". we must integrate over the probability @xmath31 of two adjacent fission at @xmath32 and @xmath33 , that form the piece with @xmath6 , over all positions of fission the space - time points . from eq .",
    "( 70 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite we have @xmath34 \\vartheta ( u_1 - u_2 ) \\vartheta(v_2 - v_1 ) \\delta ( u_1 - u_2 - \\tilde{p})\\label{prob8}\\ ] ] where the integration region @xmath35 is the rectangle area defined by lines @xmath36 .",
    "the @xmath37 - functions in expression ( [ prob8 ] ) reflect the ordering of fission points and @xmath38 - function accounts for the difference condition ( [ dif ] ) .",
    "now the opis is given by @xmath39 where the integration is over the range @xmath40 for each variable .",
    "as we have seen above the small - mass oscillations produce corrections to the fission probability of long tube that are proportional to the oscillation amplitude squared ( see ref.@xcite ) , namely @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the fission probability without oscillations , @xmath43 depends on the initial shape of the color tube , @xmath44 is the ( dimensionless ) mass of the small mass surface oscillations , @xmath45 .",
    "it is important that @xmath46 depends only on the product @xmath47 and not on @xmath23 and @xmath48 separately .",
    "since we consider small oscillations with @xmath49 we expand all expressions in a power series in @xmath50 end keep terms up to @xmath50 order . after some calculations we have @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 @xmath54 are the coefficients of power expansion of function @xmath55 .",
    "we see that small oscillations do not affect the spectrum but change the height of the plateau @xcite .",
    "obviously this change depends on the probability the of tube fission .    to proceed to the case of many type of kinks",
    "we note that the probability of the tube breaking at the point @xmath56 due to the creation of the @xmath30 pair of type @xmath57 , can be written in the form @xmath58 and @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the partial fission probability without oscillations and @xmath61 are the coefficients of the power expansion of function @xmath62 .    repeating the procedure of opis calculation we obtain for particle with @xmath1 oftype @xmath15 and @xmath2 of type @xmath57 on the edges the expression @xcite @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the relative weight of the kink of flavor @xmath14 and @xmath60 and @xmath65 are the partial and total breaking probabilities without oscillations respectively and @xmath66\\ ] ]    as in the previous case the momentum spectrum is not affected .",
    "however the height of the plateau is defined by now the product @xmath67 ( with small corrections @xmath68 ) and is @xmath69 dependent . in the case",
    "when on both edges of the piece are dominated kinks ( i.e. the kinks of small mass with large creation probability @xmath70 ) we obtain the plateau height close to unity as in the case of one type kink . the ( strange ) kinks with @xmath71 contribute only into @xmath68 corrections .",
    "when one ( or both ) kink is strange the height of the plateau is small .",
    "however the @xmath50 - order corrections contain contributions of dominant as well as strange kinks .",
    "now we pass to the two particle inclusive spectra ( tpis ) and particle correlations . for tpis",
    "we have two distinct contributions .",
    "the first one @xmath72 is from the two pieces produced in three adjacent fission points @xmath73 and @xmath74 ( @xmath75 and @xmath76 ) , having one of the edges created in the same fission at point @xmath77 while there are no fission between points @xmath78 and @xmath77 as well as between @xmath77 and @xmath76 .",
    "these pieces are the primary particles of adjacent ranges in field - feynman terminology @xcite .",
    "the second contribution @xmath79 is from two by two adjacent fission @xmath80 $ ] and @xmath81 $ ] and there is no fission between the points @xmath78 and @xmath77 as well as between @xmath76 and @xmath82 .",
    "again first consider the one flavor case @xcite .",
    "the first contribution has the form @xcite .",
    "@xmath83 \\exp[-w(u_1,v_2)-w(u_2 , v_3 ) + w(u_2,v_2)]\\vartheta ( u_1-u_2)\\\\ & & \\vartheta ( u_2-u_3)\\vartheta ( u_3)\\vartheta ( v_2-v_1 ) \\vartheta ( v_3-v_2)\\vartheta(v_1 )   \\delta ( u_1-u_2-\\tilde{p}_1)\\delta ( u_2-u_3-\\tilde{p}_2)\\nonumber \\\\ & & + ( \\tilde{p}_1 \\leftrightarrow \\tilde{p}_2)\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have denoted by @xmath84 the @xmath85 defined by expression ( [ prob6 ] ) for the rectangle area limited by lines @xmath86 and @xmath87 is the @xmath88 and @xmath89 interchanged term .",
    "the first term describes the case when tube @xmath90 has @xmath91 and tube @xmath92 has @xmath93 and the second term describes the situation when @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "the calculation is straightforward but somewhat cumbersome and we obtain @xmath96[1-a^2 f(q ) ]   + \\frac{a^2}{\\tilde{p}_1 \\tilde{p}_2 } \\varphi_1 ( \\tilde{p}_1/\\tilde{p}_2 ,    q),\\ ] ] where @xmath97 $ ] is the spectrum of the two pieces produced in the adjacent fission without oscillations and @xmath98 the function @xmath99 depends only on rapidity difference @xmath100 and his explicit form is closely related to the form of @xmath101 .",

    "the cf @xmath110 is expressed by the same function @xmath112 that @xmath113 is . at @xmath114 @xmath115 $ ] and at large @xmath116",
    "it vanishes exponentially @xmath117\\ ] ] below we shall show that this correlation can be seen as small correlation between resonances .",
    "now we proceed to the multiflavor tpis of particles @xmath118 and @xmath119 which internal quantum numbers defined by flavors of @xmath1 and @xmath2 on the piece edges .",
    "there are two different kinds of tpis .",
    "the first one @xmath120 is symmetric in @xmath88 and @xmath89 as well as in @xmath118and @xmath119 pairs .",
    "the second type @xmath121 is symmetric only with respect to simultaneous transposition of @xmath122 .",
    "let us consider first the @xmath123 .",
    "we begin with the three breaking point contribution @xmath124 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath124 vanishes unless one of the @xmath125 or /and @xmath126 pairs is the @xmath30 of same flavor .",
    "therefore we have @xmath127\\label{efone}\\ ] ] where the terms proportional to @xmath128 and @xmath129 are the contributions when at a middle breaking point are created the @xmath130 or @xmath131 kink - antikink pairs respectively , and function @xmath132 describes the influence of tube surface oscillations .",
    "the four breaking point contribution @xmath133 has a more simple form @xmath134\\ ] ] where again the function @xmath135 describes the influence of small oscillations of tube surface .",
    "thus @xmath123 has the form @xmath136 \\label{fsym}\\ ] ] where @xmath137    from expression ( [ fsym ] ) it follows that in the multiflavor case the two particle correlations are dependent on the internal quantum numbers of particles .",
    "let us consider the ( symmetric ) cf @xmath138 when all four @xmath139 are the same and dominant the cf has the form @xmath140 the first term evidently describes the correlations without oscillations , the last term ( @xmath68 ) describes the influence of the surface oscillations .",
    "it is clear that only at @xmath141 all correlations are produced by the tube surface oscillations .",
    "even if @xmath142 is very close to 1 it must the great influence of of first term must be expected .",
    "the oscillation role can be checked if we examine the @xmath108 dependence of @xmath143 .",
    "then the difference @xmath144 gives the measure of the influence of the oscillation term .",
    "let us consider now the case when there are @xmath145 types of dominant kinks with equal @xmath146 and one type of kink with @xmath147 ( for instance the kinks that correspond to the @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath20 quarks respectively ) .",
    "then @xmath148 and in order to obtain any information on the tube surface oscillations we must sum over all types of kinks ( sum over full multiplet of quarks ) , i.e. to study correlations irrespective to the internal quantum numbers of pieces . from ( [ fsym ] ) and ( [ csym ] )",
    "it easy to see that in this case @xmath149 just as in the one flavor case .",
    "otherwise the @xmath143 is strongly dominated by the nonoscillation term . for correlation between particles with fixed quantum numbers",
    "the influence of tube surface oscillations is very small .",
    "however , in contrast to the one flavor case now we have strong rapidity correlations . when only one pair of kinks is present ( for definiteness @xmath9 and @xmath57 )",
    "we have @xmath150 the correlation become much more stronger for the rare ( @xmath151 ) pair ( @xmath152 quarks ) creation in the middle point of three breaking point term . in this case",
    "@xmath153 is small and tpis is dominated by the three breaking point contribution because the four breaking point term has an additional small @xmath153 factor .",
    "the same holds also for the case of two different pairs with flavors @xmath131 and @xmath154 flavors where one pair of kinks is rare .",
    "the only difference from previous case is that we must observe the correlations between @xmath155 and @xmath156 or @xmath157 and @xmath158 ( or corresponding resonances ) .",
    "let us assume now that we detect only charged primary hadrons with same charges .",
    "such particles can not be created as primaries of adjacent ranges and none of the @xmath159 and @xmath126 pair may be of the same flavor . then the contribution @xmath160 vanishes",
    ". therefore @xmath123 has only a four breaking point contribution and we have @xmath161 it must be noted that here the sign of cf is opposite to the sign of the previous case .    finally we consider the @xmath162 tpis .",
    "the @xmath163 symmetry influences only on the three breaking point term and instead of @xmath124 we now have @xmath164 \\nonumber\\\\       & & - o(a^2 ) \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath165 - \\frac{y}{x + y}\\ ] ] and @xmath166 denotes the term proportional to @xmath50 . respectively for @xmath167 we obtain the expression @xmath168 and all conclusions of preceding discussion remain unchanged also for @xmath167 with obvious substitution @xmath169 in formulas ( [ fsym])-([citwo ] )    the above consideration of is and cf of pieces is sufficiently general and can be used also for pieces with barion quantum numbers .",
    "the only change is the substitution `` rare quarks '' @xmath170 `` diquarks '' with corresponding @xmath171 .",
    "the primary hadron is can be constructed from is of pieces in accordance with hadron quark flavor composition and spin state .",
    "here we restrict ourselves by two nonets of mesons that are the pseudoscalar ( @xmath172 , @xmath173 ) and the vector @xmath174 mesons .",
    "the other words we shell consider @xmath175 and @xmath176 meson nonets built from @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath20 quarks and antiquarks and have similar flavor structure . the oktet - nonet mixing for physical mesons is taken into account for @xmath177 and @xmath173 and @xmath178 and @xmath179 mesons according to @xcite-@xcite .",
    "let us denote by @xmath180 the probability for piece @xmath181 to form hadron @xmath182 .",
    "then we have @xmath183 where @xmath184 is the probability for piece @xmath181 to form hadron with quark flavor structure of hadron @xmath182 and @xmath185 is the probability for piece to form the @xmath175 @xmath186 or @xmath176 @xmath187 meson state . in our case @xmath188 . then using the standard recipe of the quark model",
    "@xcite-@xcite we obtain for the opis of primary hadrons @xmath189 where the plateau height @xmath190 now depends on the flavor composition and spin of the meson @xmath191 the plateau heights of primary mesons are given in table 1 .    from ( [ gl ] ) the relation between plateau heights becomes @xmath192    thus to fix all plateau heights we need only two adjustable parameters @xmath193 and @xmath194 .",
    "the first one may be fixed from relation of heights of @xmath195 and @xmath196 plateau since the @xmath175 meson plateau heights are badly disguised by resonance decay .",
    "if we choose one of the most frequently used set of parameters @xcite-@xcite @xmath197 and @xmath198 ( @xmath199 ) we obtain for rhs of eq.([rel ] ) @xmath200 therefore the measurement of heights of the vector meson plateau is of considerable interest for checking of hadronization mechanism .    the tpis and cf of primary hadrons can be calculated the same way and for symmetric tpis we obtain @xmath201 \\nonumber \\\\   & & + [ g(l_1,l_2 ) - 2g(l_1)g(l_2)]\\frac{\\varphi(\\tilde{p}_1 , \\tilde{p}_2 ) } { \\tilde{p}_1 \\tilde{p}_2 } - \\frac{a^2}{\\tilde{p}_1   \\tilde{p}_2}\\phi(l_1,l_2;\\tilde{p}_1 , \\tilde{p}_2)\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath202 and @xmath203    thus from ( [ f2s ] ) we obtain for cf of primary particles the expression @xmath204\\ ] ] where @xmath205    apart from the oscillation contribution term all primary particle correlations are governed by the same function of particle rapidity difference , i.e. up to @xmath68 corrections the all primary two particle cf have the same form and all dependence of cf on the type of particles is factorized in the scaling factor @xmath206 .",
    "it is quite obvious that the tube oscillation term is significant only when we detect whole nonet of particles .",
    "this is just the above considered case of detection of pieces irrespective to its flavor quantum numbers .",
    "this means that the role of tube surface oscillations may be studied in full nonet of vector particle correlations ( since the hadron resonance decay badly disguise the pseudoscalar particle cf ) .    for individual particles the cf",
    "are strongly dominated by nonoscillation term .",
    "next we consider this dominant part of cf for @xmath175 and @xmath176 particles .",
    "we have @xmath207 ( the factors @xmath208 are given in table 2 ) .",
    "let us begin with cf that are independent of the particle spin .",
    "the first example is that both particles belong to the highest or lowest @xmath209 in isomultiplet ( @xmath210 etc).this is just the same situation as we have seen above for correlation of two pieces with same charges .",
    "the @xmath211 and the function @xmath212 can be measured directly using @xmath213 cf .",
    "it is slightly more difficult to measure the function @xmath214 using the @xmath215 or @xmath216 cf because the of distortion rising from resonance decay .    for nonstrange particles with opposite charges we have @xmath217",
    "i.e. in this case the cf coincide with cf of oppositely charged pieces",
    ". then the measure of the relations @xmath218 and @xmath219 or @xmath220 defines the parameters @xmath142 and @xmath221 respectively .",
    "thus the measurement of the cf of the vector hadrons especially the cf of @xmath195 and @xmath222 mesons is highly desirable despite of difficulties of data processing and necessity to take into account the corrections due the resonance decay .",
    "we have seen above that the opis of primary hadrons for small rapidities have the universal plateau form @xmath223 where @xmath190 is the plateau height and @xmath224 is the light - cone momentum of hadron , where @xmath190 depends on the flavor composition as well as on the spin of the hadron.the tube surface oscillations contribute only small correction term into @xmath225 proportional to oscillation amplitude squared .",
    "the tpis and cf depend on the particle detection mode . when the whole multiplet of hadrons is detected irrespective of particle inner quantum numbers the cf contains only the tube oscillation contribution term .",
    "otherwise the oscillations give only a small correction term .",
    "the main ( nonoscillation ) term of cf of fixed particles has the form @xmath226 where all dependence on the particle type factorizes in @xmath17 and @xmath214 is a function of the difference of particle rapidities only .",
    "thus all primary cf have the same rapidity dependence that is scaled by @xmath208 factor .",
    "the parameters of the model can be unambiguously fixed by measuring the one and two particle is of vector mesons .",
    "such experimental investigations are highly desirable because of large disguise of is of pseudoscalar particles ( pions and kaons ) by decay of hadron resonances .",
    "we consider the influence of the resonance decay on is of pions and kaons in the next paper .",
