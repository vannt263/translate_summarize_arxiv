    "dielectric spectroscopy has been successfully used in the past to characterize the biological matter.@xcite these type of measurements probe the collective dielectric response of many live cells in suspensions or in tissues , but by using more or less elaborated models , useful information about the state of the individual cell can be also extracted.@xcite the main advantage of this technique is that it is non - invasive , thus the state of the individual cells can be monitored without disrupting their natural cycle .",
    "the dielectric response of live cells is fundamentally different from that of dead cells.@xcite from the dielectric point of view , the main difference between the two cases is the existence of the membrane potential in live cells .",
    "the effect of the membrane potential is the accumulation of free electric charges at the membrane surfaces .",
    "when the live cells are placed in time oscillating electric fields , these charges move on the surface of the membrane , giving rise to extremely high polarizations .",
    "since the mobility of these surface charges is relatively small , this effect appears only at low frequencies , typically below 10 khz . in this range",
    ", the relative dielectric permittivity of live cell suspensions can be as high as 10@xmath2.@xcite this phenomenon is known as the @xmath0-relaxation effect . at higher frequencies , the @xmath0 effect disappear and a second interesting dielectric spectroscopic region appear , which is the @xmath1 plateau . in this region ,",
    "the dielectric function of a cell suspension is tremendously enhanced by the presence of cell s membrane alone .    in a previous paper,@xcite",
    "we proposed a model for dielectric response of live cells in suspension , which could account for both @xmath0- and @xmath1-effects .",
    "our focus in that work was to give a semi - analytic expression for the dielectric function of suspended live cells of arbitrary shape . because of the complexity of such problem",
    ", we adopted the powerful , but somewhat complicated , spectral method introduced by bergman.@xcite in the present work , we work out a fully analytic solution of the model proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , for the case of spherically shaped cells .",
    "we hope that this analytic solution will provide a new useful tool for the scientific community working in this field .",
    "the independent input parameters for our model are : the outer and inner radius of the cell s membrane , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , the dielectric constant and conductivity of the medium ( @xmath5,@xmath6 ) , of the membrane ( @xmath7,@xmath8 ) and of the inner cell region ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 ) , the diffusion constants of surface charges accumulated at the outer and inner surfaces of the membrane , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , and the membrane potential @xmath13 .",
    "excepting @xmath9 and @xmath12 , all these parameters have a very specific effect on the dielectric dispersion curves of live cells in suspension , leading us to conclude that a fitting of an experimental dispersion curve with the present model could provide extremely accurate values for all these parameters .",
    "there is a tremendous amount of theoretical work on @xmath0-relaxation in colloids . ref .",
    "@xcite is one of the earliest work that pointed out the fact that the macroscopic dielectric function of colloidal suspensions is highly dependent , in the low frequency range , on the electrical phenomena taking place near the surface of colloidal particles .",
    "@xcite gave a first semi - quantitative treatment of these effects .",
    "@xcite developed the theoretical foundations for the second - layer polarization effect , and the work in the field culminated with ref .",
    "@xcite , which gave what was thought to be a complete theory of electrophoretic mobility of charged colloidal particles .",
    "this theory computes the net drag force on charged colloidal particles in electrolytes and takes into account the deformation of the screening cloud via liniarized hydrodynamic equations .",
    "however , from early comparisons with the experiment,@xcite it was soon realized that , besides the electrophoretic effect , there is another effect , the @xmath0-relaxation , which dwarfs the first one in most of the cases . the early theory of electrophoretic mobilty considered a rigid stern layer .",
    "a complete theory will have to relax this assumption .",
    "notable efforts in this direction are contained in a string of papers,@xcite which resulted in a fairly complicated theory of the polarization of the second layer .",
    "a discussion of latest developments in the field can be found in refs .  @xcite .",
    "our model complements these works and we could argue that it gives an effective picture of the @xmath0-polarization of the second layer .",
    "the dielectric behavior of live cells in suspension at low frequencies and low applied electric fields is predominantly determined by the @xmath0-relaxation .",
    "the theoretical model presented here targets specifically @xmath0-relaxation process , thus allowing us to keep the complexity and number of model parameters to a minimum .",
    "other theoretical works specifically addressing the dielectric response of live cells suspensions is contained in refs .",
    "notably , a simple theory of @xmath0- and @xmath1-effects for spherically symmetric cells,@xcite and an early attempt for quantifying the @xmath1-effect for arbitrary geometry.@xcite some later works@xcite give alternative approaches to the @xmath1-effect .",

    "live cells contain a large number of negatively charged molecules .",
    "the inside negative charge attracts positive charges from the outside , mainly potassium and sodium positive ions .",
    "the cells allow most of the potassium ions to enter inside , still maintaining an overall negative charge , and it keeps most of the sodium ions outside .",
    "this gives raise to a sharp potential difference across the membrane , called the resting membrane potential .",
    "its value can be anywhere in a range from 60 mv to a few tens over 100 mv .",
    "the electric field due to such potential differences is enormous .",
    "for example , 100 mv over a membrane of 10 nm gives an electric field of 10 million v / m .",
    "the charge distribution near the cell s membrane is schematically represented in fig .",
    "as discussed above , we have a positive ion distribution outside the membrane and a negative ion distribution inside the membrane .",
    "the exact radial profile of the charge distribution can be computed by solving the coupled equations describing the electrostatics and diffusion of ions near the membrane .",
    "however , the exact profile is not relevant for the present study .",
    "what is important is that the distribution is confined to within a few nano - meters from the surface of the membrane .",
    "when an electric field is applied , the charge distribution is deformed as schematically shown in fig .",
    "this redistribution generates a large dipole moment , which is at the origin of the @xmath0-relaxation process [ cite like a mad man ] . if the field is time oscillating , the ions will try to follow the electric field and dynamically redistribute themselves .",
    "as we shall see , there is a sharp frequency above which the ions can no longer follow the electric field . above this frequency",
    ", the polarizability of the cells drastically decreases and the @xmath0-effect disappear .",
    "our goal is to propose and then solve analytically a model for the dielectric response of live cells in suspensions in the frequency range from 1 hz to 100 mhz . in this range",
    ", the electromagnetic field can not distinguish the very fine structure of the cell , but it rather sees an effective image of it .",
    "it is now generally accepted@xcite that this effective image is well described by a composite dielectric body made of a dielectric shell representing the cell membrane [ described here by ( @xmath7,@xmath8 ) ] and a homogeneous dielectric core [ described here by ( @xmath9,@xmath10 ) ] .",
    "of course , the inside of a cell is very non - homogeneous , but this is irrelevant since the field penetrates very little inside the cell .",
    "this simple picture of the cell is the starting point for most of the theoretical work in the field .",
    "the early work by maxwell and wagner,@xcite who studied the dielectric behavior of spherical dielectric particles in suspensions , is probably the most widely used theory to describe the dielectric response of cell suspensions.@xcite    on top of this static picture , our model assumes that the charge distributions near a cell s membrane can be described by effective superficial charge distributions @xmath14 and @xmath15 at the outer and inner faces of the membrane .",
    "these superficial distributions of charges are described by the following properties :    \\1 .",

    "the thickness of the membrane also has a very specific effect on the @xmath1 plateau . from fig .",

    "note that the height of the @xmath0 plateau also changes in fig .",

    "we point out that the membrane potential @xmath13 of live cells in suspension can be modified by changing the potassium ion concentration@xcite or by actively blocking or activating the ion channels.@xcite as one can see in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] , changes in the membrane potential have very specific and dramatic effects in the alpha region : the larger the membrane potential , the higher the alpha plateau .",
    "for the variations in the membrane potential mentioned above , the model predicts variations of the alpha plateau of about 8@xmath12910@xmath130 .    at last , we discuss the effect of the mobility of surface charges .",
    "changes in the surface charges mobility also have a very specific and dramatic effect in the alpha region , as shown in fig",
    ". the larger the mobility , the larger the wider the alpha plateau .",
    "the first goal of our paper was to propose a model which can account in a unified way for the dielectric response of live cells in suspensions in both alpha and beta regions .",
    "the second goal of the paper was to give an analytic solution to the model for the simple spherical geometry , solution that could be useful for many people working in the field .",
    "based on this model , we have analyzed the effect of different physical parameters on the dielectric dispersion curves of live cells in suspension .",
    "we found that the conductivities of the medium and of the intracellular fluid control the length of the beta plateau , while the membrane thickness controls the height of the beta plateau . in the alpha region , we found that the membrane potential controls the height of the alpha plateau while the mobility of the surface charges accumulated at the cell s membrane controls the length of the alpha plateau .",
    "all the parameters of the model have distinct influences on the dispersion curves , fact that lead us to conclude that all the parameters can be accurately obtained by fitting experimental data with our model .",
    "thus , the combination of experimental dielectroscopy data and our model could lead to a methodology for live cell monitoring .",
    "our results show that , for a given cell concentration and geometry , the low - frequency alpha dielectric response correlates with the magnitude of the cellular membrane potential .",
    "this is potentially very important because it enables dielectric spectroscopy to become perhaps the only method for monitoring membrane potential that is both label free and non - invasive .",
    "for example , the use of voltage - sensitive dyes is problematic if one wishes to simultaneously monitor other physiological processes , such as atp / adp ratio , that require different fluorescent assays . as a result , if one wishes to study the effects of membrane potential on other parameters with conventional methods , it is often necessary to use fluorescent assays on two separate cell populations and then to correlate the results with the hope that the two populations are identical .",
    "a major advantage of dielectric spectroscopy , if further developed , is that one could use dielectric response to monitor membrane potential while using a fluorescent assay to simulanously monitor another parameter on the same cell population .",
    "moreover , dielectric response appears well suited to flow - cytometry and can be readily scaled into multi - electrode ( plate reader ) systems and large scale microfluidic devices .",
    "therefore , we believe the method has potential for numerous applications , including fundamental research in cell biology and biochemistry , pharmaceutical development , and diagnostic methods in medicine",
