    "compelling evidence indicates that dark matter ( dm ) plays a significant role in many gravitational phenomena such as the galactic rotation curves , the galaxy cluster dynamics , and the cosmic microwave background @xcite .",
    "the latest measurements suggest that dm constitutes 84.3% of the matter density in the current universe @xcite .",
    "abundant as dm is , its particle physics nature remains unknown .",
    "various well - motivated dm candidates have been proposed in the literature and the leading candidate is the weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) @xcite .",
    "wimps may annihilate or decay and finally produce stable high - energy particle pairs , including for example electrons / positrons , protons / anti - protons , neutrinos / anti - neutrinos and gamma - rays .",
    "these stable particles contribute to the cosmic radiation .",
    "the identification of these dm - originated particles in the gamma - ray and cosmic ray data is the prime goal of dark matter indirect detection .",
    "dm induced @xmath0 raysare either from the decay or hadronization of the final state particles ( i.e. prompt radiation ) , or from the final state particles interacting with interstellar medium or interstellar radiation field ( i.e. secondary radiation ) . unlike the charged particles that are deflected by the magnetic fields , gamma - rays travel straightforwardly and their morphology trace the distribution of the emitting sources directly .",
    "therefore the searches for dm signal in the gamma - ray data , benefited from the spatial correlation with the dm distribution , have attracted wide attention .",
    "this is in particular the case after the successful launch of _ fermi gamma - ray space telescope _ in june 2008 @xcite .",
    "great efforts have been made to analyze the _ fermi_-lat(large area telescope ) data , but no reliable dm signal has been identified so far ( see @xcite for a recent review ) .    among various targets ,",
    "the milky way dwarf spheroidal galaxies ( dsphs ) , dominated by dm and in short of high energy astrophysical processes , are promising regions to identify the dm signal indirectly .",
    "the identification of dsphs in optical however is rather challenging due to their low luminosities .",
    "until recently , only 25 dsphs were found by the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) @xcite and the observations prior to it ( see @xcite and the references therein ) . over the past two years , 23 more dsphs ( including candidates ) have been discovered due to new optical image surveys @xcite such as the dark energy survey ( des ) @xcite and the pan - starrs1 3@xmath3 survey @xcite , or due to the reanalysis of the sdss data .",
    "although many analyses have been conducted in search for the @xmath0-rayemission from these dsph sources and candidates @xcite , none of them displays a statistically - significant signal ( tentative gamma - ray emission signals were reported in ret ii @xcite and tuc iii @xcite ) .",
    "dm subhalos are also promising targets for dm indirect detection . in the standard hierarchical structure formation theory ,",
    "dark matter particles accumulate to become small halos , and then merge repeatedly to form larger halos .",
    "some of the halos , if survived from the tidal stripping and virialization , become subhalos of the main halo @xcite .",
    "n - body simulations at the scale of milky way show much more subhalos than satellites observed at optical wavelength @xcite , indicating the majority of them contain little stars or gas .",
    "dm subhalos , either massive enough or close enough to the earth , could be visible in the gamma - ray band @xcite . more specifically , if 40 gev dm particles annihilate with a cross section near the latest upper limit , _",
    "fermi_-latmight have recorded @xmath4 dm subhalos @xcite . due to the short of stars and gas",
    ", dm subhalos may be only detectable in gamma - rays and hence are members of the unidentified gamma - ray sources .",
    "dedicated efforts have been made to search for such objects @xcite .",
    "for instance , by fitting spectral energy distribution ( sed ) with dm spectra , bright high latitude point sources are investigated in @xcite .",
    "candidates are selected from the spectrally hard sources and their multi - wavelength counterparts are examined in @xcite .",
    "independent source candidates created with looser assumptions on the spectrum are studied in @xcite .",
    "machine learning algorithms are also used to classify un - associated sources , and outliers , which are probably dm subhalos , are selected @xcite .",
    "one very attractive finding is the identification of a spatially - extended source , 3fgl j2212.5 + 0703 , among the unidentified sources @xcite in the _",
    "fermi_-latthird source catalog ( 3fgl ) .",
    "in astrophysical scenarios it is rather hard to give rise to a spatially - extended steady source without any association in other wavelength .",
    "therefore 3fgl j2212.5 + 0703is an interesting dm subhalo candidate , as stressed in @xcite .",
    "independent analysis is thus necessary to check whether it is indeed the case .",
    "for such a purpose , in this work we re - analyze the spatial , temporal and spectral characters of 3fgl j2212.5 + 0703 . the difference between this work and @xcite",
    "are the following : ( 1 ) in order to effectively suppress the possible contamination from two nearby extremely - bright blazars ( 3fgl j2254.0 + 1608 and 3fgl j2232.5 + 1143 ) , we just take into account the front - converting gamma - rays that have angular resolutions better than the back - converting photons ; ( 2 ) we have extended the spectrum analysis down to the energy @xmath1 mev and special attention has been given to the possible improvement in the fit by introducing a phenomenological shape in comparison to the @xmath2 model . note that if significant improvement is found , the astrophysical origin will be favored ; ( 3 ) the variability of the emission in the past 8 years rather than just the first four years has been thoroughly examined to better test the stability",

    "<S> in order to suppress the possible contamination from two nearby very - bright blazars , we just take into account the front - converting gamma - rays which have better angular resolutions than that of the back - converting photons . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the spatial distribution analysis , we have extended the spectrum analysis down to the energies of @xmath1 mev , and thoroughly examined the variability of the emission during the past 8 years . </S>",
    "<S> we confirm that 3fgl j2212.5 + 0703 is a steady and spatially - extended gamma - ray emitter at a high confidence level . </S>",
    "<S> the spectrum is well consistent with that expected from dm annihilation into @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the introduction of a phenomenological logparabola spectrum just improves the fit slightly . </S>",
