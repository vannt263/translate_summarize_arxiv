    "binary pulsar systems are important laboratories for gravitational physics @xcite , in part because the strong self - gravity of neutron stars ( @xmath0 ) raises the possibility of deviations as large as order unity in some alternate gravity theories  even theories that agree with general relativity ( gr ) in weak - field tests @xcite . immediately after the discovery of the first binary pulsar , psr  b1913 + 16 @xcite",
    ", it was realized that geodetic precession could lead to variations in the path of the observer s line of sight across the pulsar s magnetic pole , and hence changes in the radiation pattern at earth @xcite .",
    "recently , the anticipated pulse - profile variations have been observed , in good qualitative agreement with predictions @xcite , but uncertainties in the intrinsic beam shape prevent a quantitative measurement of the precession rate .",
    "here we describe observations of the double - neutron - star system psr b1534 + 12 , in which precession is changing the observed pulsar profile by about 1% per year @xcite .",
    "we outline a new , general technique for combining measurements of long - term quasisecular variations caused by geodetic precession with those of periodic variations induced by special relativistic aberration modulated by orbital motion .",
    "together , the observations allow a quantitative estimate of the precession rate , independent of the unknown pulsar beam shape .",
    "although the precision is still low , we show that this model - independent precession rate is consistent with the predicted rate in gr .",
    "the polarization properties of the pulsar signal are also changing : with the additional assumption that the magnetic field structure is dipolar , we can determine the angles between the spin and orbital angular momenta and the line of sight to the pulsar .",

    "the data are consistent with a roughly orthogonal rotator model , with @xmath32 and the line of sight passing between the magnetic pole and the stellar equator , within a few degrees of the magnetic pole .",
    "we also consider the time evolution of @xmath10 and the impact parameter of the line of sight on the magnetic pole @xmath25 , using cumulative profiles from each campaign , one especially strong biweekly observation , and an earlier coherently - dedispersed profile from observations with the `` mark  iii '' data acquisition system @xcite .",

    "secular changes in the profile were first noticed at 1400mhz @xcite , but evolution of the 430-mhz emission only became apparent with coherently dedispersed observations @xcite .",
    "shape variations are more difficult to connect directly to the precession rate than polarization changes .",
    "it can be done with an assumed model of the beam shape , as has been attempted for psr  b1913 + 16 @xcite , but in that case the true beam shape is still debated and the results are therefore less than satisfactory .    here",
    "we note that it is possible to make a model - independent precession estimate by also measuring the orbital modulation of the profile shape caused by aberration  a special - relativistic effect independent of strong - field gravity .",

    "profiles with unusually low signal - to - noise ratios or suspect calibrations were discarded .",
    "we used standard principal component ( pc ) analysis techniques @xcite to derive orthogonal `` reference '' ( @xmath24 ) and `` difference '' ( @xmath26 ) profiles that completely described the profile evolution ; @xmath26 and a single - epoch profile very similar to @xmath24 are shown in fig .",

    "the pc analysis provided estimates of @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and their uncertainties , which we independently checked through a frequency - domain cross - correlation technique in which a linear combination of the two profiles was fit in an iterative manner . finally , we simulated the cross - correlation analysis to assess its sensitivity to systematic errors induced by imperfect calibration or polarization cross - coupling , finding that such problems should be negligible in our dataset .",
    "the secular trend in @xmath48 is evident in fig .",
    "[ fig : fit ] .",
    "this corresponds to a decrease in the intensity of the core region of the profile relative to the lower level emission in the wings , consistent with early indications from 1400mhz data , and as expected if precession is moving our line of sight away from the magnetic pole , as indicated by the polarization analysis above .",
    "the residuals after removing the best fit line are shown as a function of orbital phase .",
    "a simultaneous linear fit of @xmath48 as a function of date and of @xmath58 and @xmath59 gives the constraints @xmath60/yr and @xmath61/yr ( 68% confidence ) , where we have used @xmath62 .",
    "a fit of @xmath48 only as a function of date yields a @xmath52 value that is 15% higher than that for the full fit .",
    "we have observed both long- and short - term variations in the pulse shape of psr b1534 + 12 , as expected from geodetic precession and aberration . assuming a dipolar field geometry and gr , the impact parameter change @xmath63yr yields a measurement of the previously unknown angle @xmath64 . using the pulse timing value @xmath65 @xcite but making no assumptions about the validity of the rvm , our measured pulse profile variations yield , using equations  4  and  5 , the consistent result @xmath66 .",
    "moreover , we may now solve for the precession rate , @xmath67/yr ( 68% confidence ) or @xmath68/yr ( 95% confidence ) .",
    "this value compares well with the gr - predicted rate of @xmath69/yr .",
    "the misalignment angle @xmath7 between the spin and orbital angular momenta can also be constrained .",
    "the angle @xmath70 is known from the polarization studies .",
    "only the absolute values of @xmath71 and @xmath72 are known , but our profile fit requires that @xmath73 .",
    "therefore there are two possible geometries : @xmath74 and @xmath75 , which gives @xmath76 , or @xmath77 and @xmath78 , which gives @xmath79 .",
    "both give identical results for precession in gr .",
    "as the angular momenta were almost certainly aligned before the second supernova , the smaller misalignment value is favored on astrophysical grounds @xcite .",
    "the preferred geometry then has @xmath74 , @xmath80 , and @xmath76 ( fig  [ fig : geom ] ) .",
    "the misalignment angle can be used to constrain mass loss and asymmetry in the second supernova .",
    "a full analysis will be published elsewhere , along with a study of the two - dimensional beam geometry of psr  b1534 + 12 .",
    "although the precision is , as yet , limited , this is the first beam - model - independent measurement of the precession rate of a binary pulsar and reconstruction of the full three dimensional geometry of a binary pulsar system , including the misalignment angle .",
    "future prospects for improvement include direct estimation of the angle @xmath12 by combining scintillation studies @xcite with polarimetry @xcite .",
    "the derived geometry also allows us to predict the effects of aberration on the pulse timing @xcite ; this will in principle allow more precise timing tests of gr in future .",
    "we emphasize that the general technique of combining observations on the orbital and precessional timescales to make model independent precession rate estimates is potentially far more general than the particular example given here .",
    "an especially interesting prospect is the recently discovered highly relativistic system psr  j0737@xmath813039 @xcite ; with @xmath82 nearly twice as large as that of b1534 + 12 , and a predicted precession timescale for the recycled pulsar of only 75 years , both effects will be quickly measured for this new system .",
