    "the high leakage current density in undoped bfo is attributed to the highly volatile nature of bi with its corresponding off - stoichiometric phases and oxygen vacancies @xcite . on the other hand , bfo possesses g - type antiferromagnetic spiral modulated spin structure ( smss ) with a period of  62 nm which continues through the crystal and thereby cancel out macroscopic magnetization in bulk .",

    "<S> improvement in magnetic and electrical properties of multiferroic bifeo@xmath0 in conjunction with their dependence on particle size is crucial due to its potential applications in multifunctional miniaturized devices . in this investigation </S>",
    "<S> , we report a study on particle size dependent structural , magnetic and electrical properties of sol - gel derived bi@xmath1ba@xmath2feo@xmath0 nanoparticles of different sizes ranging from @xmath3 12 to 49 nm . </S>",
    "<S> the substitution of bi by ba significantly suppresses oxygen vacancies , reduces leakage current density and fe@xmath4 state . </S>",
    "<S> an improvement in both magnetic and electrical properties is observed for 10 % ba - doped bifeo@xmath0 nanoparticles compared to its undoped counterpart . </S>",
    "<S> the saturation magnetization of bi@xmath1ba@xmath2feo@xmath0 nanoparticles increase with reducing particle size in contrast with a decreasing trend of ferroelectric polarization . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , a first order metamagnetic transition is noticed for @xmath3 49 nm bi@xmath1ba@xmath2feo@xmath0 nanoparticles which disappeared with decreasing particle size . </S>",
    "<S> the observed strong size dependent multiferroic properties are attributed to the complex interaction between vacancy induced crystallographic defects , multiple valence states of fe , uncompensated surface spins , crystallographic distortion and suppression of spiral spin cycloid of bifeo@xmath0 . </S>"
