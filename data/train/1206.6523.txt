    "in the past two decades , several correlations have been observed between various properties of galaxies and the masses of their central supermassive black holes ( bhs ) .",
    "two of the best - studied correlations , in both active and quiescent galaxies , are the relations between the mass of the central black hole ( @xmath1 ) and the stellar velocity dispersion of the host bulge , commonly known as the @xmath1@xmath2  relation ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , and the relation between @xmath1  and the luminosity of the host bulge , also referred to as the @xmath1@xmath3  relation ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the existence of these correlations suggests that there is a connection between supermassive bh growth and galaxy evolution .",
    "if this connection exists , simulations or theories of galaxy and bh growth must naturally produce these observed correlations .",
    "explanations for the observed @xmath1galaxy correlations have ranged from hierarchical mergers and quasar feedback to self - regulated bh growth ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , although there are also arguments that it is simply a consequence of random mergers ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "a large sample of accurate direct @xmath1  measurements is crucial to understanding this bh  galaxy connection .",
    "because the bh sphere of influence is much too small to be resolvable in any but the nearest galaxies , the only direct method of measuring @xmath1  in distant galaxies is reverberation mapping ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , which is applicable to type 1 , or broad - line , active galactic nuclei ( agns ) .",
    "reverberation mapping relies on the correlation between variations of the agn continuum emission and the subsequent response of the broad emission lines . by monitoring agn spectra over a period of time",
    ", one can measure the radius of the broad line region by observing the time delay , or `` lag '' , between fluctuations in the continuum and emission - line fluxes , which is due to light travel time between the continuum source and the blr . assuming the gas is in virial motion",
    ", this blr radius , @xmath4 , can be combined with some measure of the blr gas velocity from the doppler - broadened emission - line widths to obtain an estimate of @xmath1 . to date , this method has been applied to measure blr radii and @xmath1  in nearly 50 agns ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "see @xcite for a recent review on using the blr to measure @xmath1  .",
    "these measurements have confirmed the existence of a correlation predicted by photoionization theory between the radius of the blr and the agn continuum luminosity , known as the @xmath5@xmath6  relation ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this correlation allows one to obtain both velocity and @xmath5  estimates from a single calibrated spectrum , and has been used to calculate @xmath1  in large samples of agns ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this can be used to investigate the evolution of the bh mass function ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , the growth of bhs compared to their hosts , the eddington ratios of quasars ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) , and even the dependence of accretion disk sizes on bh mass ( @xcite ) .",
    "the existence of local correlations between host properties and @xmath1  provides another means of exploring bh populations , where bh masses can be inferred from the properties of their hosts .",
    "however , there has recently been some discussion on the nature of these correlations , especially the @xmath1@xmath2  relation . in these applications ,",
    "the @xmath1@xmath2  relation is assumed to be similar in quiescent and active galaxies , but there are claims that many agns lie below or above the @xmath1@xmath2  relation at both the high and low - luminosity ends ( see , for example , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . whether or not @xmath1  estimates based on these relationships are reliable is openly debated . continuing to make new and improved @xmath1  measurements using reverberation mapping",
    "is one way to investigate this .",
    "light curve quality , in terms of sampling density , duration , and precision flux measurements , is a very important factor in reverberation measurements . in particular , light curves that are too short in duration or inadequately sampled can result in incorrect lag measurements",
    "( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . since the 1990s",
    ", our view of what constitutes `` adequately - sampled '' has changed dramatically , and we now know that some of the early measurements need to be redone , as their sampling rates are low enough that we have serious doubts about their suitibility in recovering blr radii . in a continuing effort to improve the database of reverberation - mapped objects",
    ", we carried out a massive reverberation mapping program at multiple institutions beginning in 2010 august and running until 2011 january .",
    "the main goals of our program were ( 1 ) to re - observe old objects lacking well - sampled light curves , ( 2 ) to expand the reverberation - mapped sample by observing new objects , ( 3 ) to obtain velocity - delay maps for several of the targets , and ( 4 ) if possible , to measure a reverberation lag in the high - ionization ii4686 heii@xmath7  emission line in a narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxy ( mrk 335 in this case , with results published in @xcite ) .",
    "we limited our target list to galaxies with expected time lags that were short enough to allow successful measurements during our four - month long campaign .",
    "our final target list included eight objects , and we succeeded in measuring lags for six .",
    "two objects , ngc4151 and ngc 7603 , were dropped due to weather - related time losses . here",
    "we present lag measurements for five of the six remaining objects , while the sixth object , ngc7469 , presents us with a number of interesting challenges and will be discussed in a future work .",
    "these five targets and their basic properties are listed in table [ table : obj_info ] .",
    "we will discuss velocity - delay maps in a forthcoming study .",
    "in general , we follow the observational and data reduction practices of @xcite for the spectroscopic observations .",
    "our data analysis methods follow those of @xcite . a brief summary and",
    "any deviations from these methodologies are discussed below .",
    "when needed , we adopt a cosmological model with @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 km sec@xmath11 mpc@xmath11 .",
    "the majority of the spectra were obtained using the mdm observatory 1.3 m mcgraw - hill telescope on kitt peak .",
    "we used the boller and chivens ccd spectrograph to obtain spectra over the course of 120 nights from 2010 august 31 to december 28 .",
    "we used the 350 mm@xmath11 grating to obtain a dispersion of 1.33pixel@xmath11 .",
    "we set the grating for a central wavelength of 5150 , which resulted in spectral coverage from roughly 4400  to 5850 .",
    "the slit was oriented north - south ( position angle=0 ) and set to a width of @xmath12 , which resulted in a spectral resolution of 7.9  .",
    "we used an extraction window of @xmath13 along the slit .",
    "we also obtained spectra during this time period using the 2.6 m shajn telescope at the crimean astrophysical observatory ( crao ) .",
    "these data were acquired with the nasmith spectrograph and spec-10 ccd .",
    "a @xmath14 slit was used at a position angle of 90@xmath15 , and we used an extraction window of @xmath16 . because of the large slit size used , there should be no effect on the agn light due to the change in position angle between the mdm and crao spectra .",
    "however , this will affect the amount of host galaxy light received through the slit .",
    "the spectral coverage in the crao data was from approximately 3900   to 6100  , with a dispersion of 1.0pixel@xmath11 .",
    "table [ table : specobs ] lists the number of spectroscopic observations and time coverage at each telescope for our sample .",
    "the reduced spectra were calibrated onto an absolute flux scale by assuming that the [ oiii]@xmath17 narrow - line flux is constant .",
    "the reference spectra for this calibration were created by averaging spectra taken on photometric nights for each source .",
    "we scaled these reference spectra to the absolute flux of the [ oiii]@xmath17 line for each object ( listed in column 3 of table [ table : static ] ) to create an absolute flux - calibrated reference spectrum for each object .",
    "we confirmed that the [ oiii]@xmath17 fluxes in these reference spectra agreed with previous measurements , where available .",
    "our new measurement of @xmath18([oiii]@xmath17 )  =   3.67  @xmath19  10@xmath20  ergs  s@xmath11  @xmath21 for 3c120 was larger than that of @xcite , who measured @xmath18([oiii]@xmath17 ) = 3.02 @xmath19 10@xmath20 ergs s@xmath11 @xmath21 .",
    "since our spectra have improved greatly in quality since then , we adopt our new [ oiii]@xmath17 flux .",
    "we did not find a published absolute [ oiii]@xmath17 flux measurement for mrk 1501 , so for that source we adopt the flux measured in our average spectrum of the photometric data as the absolute [ oiii ] flux . using a @xmath22 goodness - of - fit estimator method to minimize the flux differences between the spectra ( @xcite )",
    ", we then scaled each individual spectrum to the reference spectrum .",
    "these procedures yield an absolute flux - calibrated data set for each object from which to measure the mean agn luminosity . in some spectra",
    ", we were unable to obtain a good fit due to changes in spectrograph focus , so we manually scaled these spectra instead . figure [ fig : f1 ] shows the calibrated mean and root mean square residual ( rms ) spectra of our five objects based on the calibrated mdm spectra .      to supplement our spectra , we obtained @xmath23-band imaging observations using the 70-cm telescope at crao and the 46-cm centurion telescope at wise observatory of tel - aviv university .",
    "the crao observations used the ap7p ccd , which has 512 @xmath19 512 pixels with a 15@xmath1915  field of view when mounted at prime focus .",
    "the wise observatory used an stl-6303e ccd with 3072 @xmath19 2048 pixels , with a field of view of 75@xmath1950  for our setup .",
    "a summary of the photometric observations can be found in table [ table : specobs ] , including the number of observations of each object at each telescope and their span in heliocentric julian date ( hjd ) .",
    "emission - line light curves were created for both the mdm and crao data sets by fitting a linear continuum underneath the h@xmath0  line in each spectrum and integrating the flux above it .",
    "the continuum was defined by two regions adjacent to the emission line , which is defined by regions given in table [ table : int_regions ] . for the mdm data ,",
    "the 5100  continuum light curves were created by taking the average flux measured in the wavelength regions listed in table [ table : int_regions ] .",
    "initial crao continuum and h@xmath0light curves were created the same way  however , the crao spectra were on a different flux scale than the mdm spectra because different amounts of [ oiii ] and host galaxy light enter their slits due to changes in seeing , slit orientation , and aperture size .",
    "we assumed there is no real variability on timescales of less than 0.5 days , so we calibrated the crao light curves to the mdm light curves by multiplying the fluxes by a constant calculated by taking the average flux ratios between pairs of observations from the crao and mdm light curves that are separated by less than 0.5 days , putting both light curves on the same flux scale .",
    "for the wise imaging data , we used image subtraction to produce the light curves using isis ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we generally follow the procedures of @xcite .",
    "the images are first aligned using a program called sexterp ( siverd 2012 , in prep ) .",
    "sexterp is a replacement for isis default interp.csh that relies on sextractor ( @xcite ) for source identification .",
    "sextractor source lists are significantly more robust and improve registration accuracy .",
    "we additionally use an upgraded interpolation utility provided with sexterp .",
    "this routine implements the publicly available bspline interpolation code of @xcite and produced better results with our images .",
    "we then used isis to create a reference image for each field using the 2030 images with the best seeing and lowest background counts .",
    "when creating the reference image , isis convolves the images with a spatially variable convolution kernel to transform all images to the same point - spread function ( psf ) and background level .",
    "the resulting images are then stacked using a 3@xmath24 rejection limit from the median .",
    "we then used isis to convolve the reference image with a kernel to match it to each individual image in the data set and subtract each individual frame from its corresponding convolved reference image .",
    "we then extract light curves for the nucleus of each galaxy using isis to place a psf - weighted aperture over the nucleus and measure the residual flux .",
    "we used varying extraction apertures for the different objects , choosing apertures large enough to account for all agn light but minimizing the host galaxy light included . for the crao images",
    ", we used photometric fluxes based on standard aperture photometry , which were measured within an aperture of @xmath25 .",
    "this includes all of the host galaxy flux for most of our objects , and was chosen to minimize slit losses due to variable seeing .",
    "see @xcite for more details on obtaining the crao photometric fluxes .",
    "the spectroscopic continuum light curves were merged with the photometric light curves as follows .",
    "we applied a multiplicative scale factor as well as an additive flux adjustment to each photometric light curve to put them all on the same scale and correct for the differences in host galaxy starlight that enters the apertures ( see @xcite ) . the final continuum and emission - line light curves , scaled to our mdm light curves , are shown in figure [ fig : f2 ] .",
    "the continuum and h@xmath0  fluxes are given in tables [ table : phot ] and [ table : spec ] and labeled according to the observatory at which they were obtained .",
    "final light curve statistics are given in table [ table : lcstats ] .",
    "previous reverberation studies have relied on fairly simple cross - correlation methods to measure the time delay between the continuum and emission - line variations , @xmath26 .",
    "recently , however , @xcite introduced an alternative method of measuring reverberation time lags called stochastic process estimation for agn reverberation ( spear ) , and demonstrated its ability to recover accurate time lags .",
    "we utilize this method here . as with cross correlation , we assume all emission - line light curves are scaled and shifted versions of the continuum light curve .",
    "spear differs from simple cross correlation methods in two basic respects .",
    "first , spear explicitly builds a model of the light curve and transfer function and fits it to both the continuum and the line data , maximizing the likelihood @xmath27 of the model and then computing uncertainties using the ( bayesian ) markov chain monte carlo method .",
    "second , as part of this process it models the continuum light curve as an autoregressive process using a damped random walk ( drw ) model .",
    "it has long been known that agn continuum variability can be modeled as an autoregressive process ( @xcite ) and a drw model has been demonstrated to be a good statistical model of quasar variability using large ( @xmath28 ) samples of quasar light curves ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the parameters of the drw model are included in the fits and their uncertainties , as is a simple top - hat model of the transfer function and the light curve means ( or trends if desired ) .",
    "the key physical advantage of spear is that it automatically includes a self - consistent , physical model of how to interpolate in time . for any given drw model parameters",
    ", the stochastic process model gives a mathematical estimate for the light curve at any time along with its uncertainties that naturally includes all the information in both the continuum and line light curves and their uncertainties .",
    "since the drw parameters also have to be estimated from the data , we allow them to vary as part of the overall model as well .",
    "in essence , this leads to a lag estimate that naturally includes the uncertainties in how to interpolate between data points , constrained by the physical properties of the variability in the target . because it is then a statistical fit to the data with a set of parameters and a standard likelihood function",
    ", it also allows the use of powerful statistical methods like markov chain monte carlo methods to produce uncertainties that correctly incorporate the effects of the model uncertainties on the lag estimate .",
    "we used spear on our light curves using the code described by @xcite and successfully measured time lags ( @xmath29 ) for all five objects .",
    "we list these in table [ table : lags ] . the mean and variance of the light curve models calculated by spear that are consistent with the data",
    "are shown in figure [ fig : f3 ] .",
    "we also show the log - likelihood functions ( log ( @xmath27/@xmath30 as a function of @xmath26 ) for these light curves in figure [ fig : f4 ] .",
    "the likelihood @xmath27 is defined in equation ( 17 ) in @xcite , and is proportional to @xmath31 .",
    "the best model , corresponding to @xmath32 , is associated with the minimum @xmath33 , @xmath34 .",
    "thus , @xmath27/@xmath32 @xmath35 @xmath36 and @xmath37 ln@xmath38",
    ". therefore , figure [ fig : f4 ] effectively shows @xmath39 between models using each lag and the best model .    for comparison with previous results , we also include in table [ table : lags ] the lag measurements made using the interpolation method originally described by @xcite and @xcite which was later modified by @xcite and peterson et al.(1998 , 2004 ) .",
    "we cross - correlate the continuum with the emission - line light curve , calculating the value of the cross correlation coefficient @xmath40 at each each of many potential time lags .",
    "we show the ccfs for our light curves in figure [ fig : f4 ] .",
    "uncertainties in these lags are calculated using monte carlo simulations that employ the flux randomization and random subset selection methods of @xcite , as refined by @xcite .",
    "for each realization , we measure the lag ( @xmath41 ) that results in the peak value of the cross correlation coefficient , @xmath42 .",
    "we also measure the lag at the centroid of the ccf ( @xmath43 ) , calculated using points surrounding the peak with values greater than 0.8@xmath44 .",
    "we adopt the mean of the distribution of delay measurements from our monte carlo realizations , and the standard deviations of the same distributions are adopted as our formal 1@xmath24 uncertainties . in the cases of mrk 335 , mrk 6 , and pg2130 + 099 , we subtracted linear trends before performing the ccf analysis , as there are clear secular trends in these light curves .",
    "this did not significantly affect the measured lag values , as can sometimes be the case . however , the resulting ccfs were cleaner , with much more narrow and well - defined peaks when the trends were subtracted .      assuming that the motion of the h@xmath0-emitting gas is dominated by gravity , the relation between @xmath1 , line width , and time delay is @xmath45 where @xmath26 is the measured emission - line time delay , @xmath46 is the velocity dispersion of the blr , and @xmath47 is a dimensionless factor that depends on the geometry , kinematics , and orientation of the blr .",
    "the blr velocity dispersion can be estimated using the observed h@xmath0  line width .",
    "this line width can be characterized by either the fwhm or the line dispersion , @xmath48 . to determine the best value of the line width and its uncertainty , we use monte carlo simulations similar to those used when determining the lag from the ccf .",
    "we run 100 simulations in which we create a mean and rms residual spectrum from a randomly chosen subset of the spectra , obtaining a distribution of resolution - corrected line widths .",
    "we take the mean value of @xmath48 or fwhm from these realizations and use their standard deviation as our uncertainty .",
    "we measure @xmath49 and fwhm in both the mean and rms residual spectra for completeness , and report these in table [ table : mbh ] .",
    "we use the rms residual spectrum line widths to estimate @xmath1 , as this eliminates contamination from constant narrow line components and isolates the broad emission components that are actually responding to the continuum variations .",
    "we adopt @xmath50 = 5.5 .",
    "this estimate is based on the assumption that agns follow the same @xmath1@xmath2  relationship as quiescent galaxies ( @xcite ) , and is consistent with @xcite .",
    "this factor allows for easy comparison with previous results , but is about a factor of two larger than the value of @xmath50 computed by @xcite .",
    "we use @xmath49(rms ) in our @xmath1  computation because there is at least some evidence that it produces less biased @xmath1  measurements than using the fwhm ( @xcite ) . using @xmath29 for the average time lag ,",
    "we compute the virial product @xmath51 = @xmath52/g ) and @xmath1  for all five galaxies .",
    "the measurements are reported in table [ table : mbh ] .",
    "we compute the average 5100  luminosities of our sources , correcting for host galaxy contamination following @xcite .",
    "we measure the observed - frame host - galaxy flux in our aperture for each source using hst images ( table [ table : static ] ) . with these measurements ,",
    "we calculate the host - subtracted , rest - frame 5100agn luminosity for placement on the radius - luminosity relationship .",
    "the final host - subtracted agn luminosities are given in table [ table : mbh ] .",
    "note that we do not currently have hst images from which to measure the host luminosity for two of our objects , mrk 6 and mrk 1501 . as a consequence ,",
    "the luminosities listed for these objects are the total 5100  luminosities rather than just that of the agn , and we expect them to fall to the right of the @xmath5@xmath6  relationship .    figure [ fig : f5 ] shows the @xcite @xmath5@xmath6  relationship and the placement of our new measurements .",
    "previous measurements from @xcite are represented as open shapes , while our new measurements are represented by filled shapes , varying in shape and color by object .",
    "we have not re - fit the best - fit trend including our new data ; we leave this to a future work .",
    "mrk 335 and 3c120 both fall very close to their positions from the @xcite , but we have increased the precision of their @xmath5 measurements . pg2130 + 099 continues to lie somewhat to the right of the relation .",
    "both mrk 6 and mrk 1501 also lie noticeably below the relationship , as is expected since we were unable to subtract the host galaxy starlight  we therefore show these luminosity measurements as upper limits . host measurements for these galaxies will shift both of them to lower luminosities and hence closer to the existing @xmath5@xmath6  relation .",
    "to see where we expect mrk 1501 and mrk 6 to lie on the relation after host subtraction , we examined the host galaxy light fraction in galaxies with similar blr sizes ( i.e. similar lags ) as these two objects . using measurements from @xcite , we calculated the average fraction of host galaxy light among galaxies with similar lags , and used this fraction to calculate the expected host galaxy fluxes , and hence the expected host - subtracted luminosities , in mrk 1501 and mrk 6 .",
    "host galaxies in objects with lags similar to mrk 1501 contributed on average 34% of the total luminosity , so we expect mrk 1501 to change from log @xmath53 = 44.32 @xmath54 0.05 to around 44.10 .",
    "host galaxies in objects with lags similar to mrk 6 contributed on average 56% of the total luminosity .",
    "if we applied this to mrk 6 , the host - subtracted luminosity would then be log @xmath53 = 43.40 .",
    "both of these objects will likely continue to lie below the current @xmath5@xmath6  relation , but within the normal range of scatter currently observed .",
    "however , it is important to note that there is a very large scatter in the fraction of the luminosity contributed by the host galaxies in general , so these numbers are used for very rough estimations only .",
    "previous reverberation measurements of mrk 335 were made by @xcite and @xcite and reanalyzed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "previous h@xmath0  measurements for this object are quite good , and it was included in this study mainly for the potential to measure the size of the high ionization component of the blr . details from our study have been reported by @xcite , and the data have been included in this study for completeness .",
    "our new measurement of @xmath5  = 14.1@xmath55 days is consistent with the previous measurement of @xmath5  = 15.3@xmath56 ( @xcite ) when taking into account the luminosity change of mrk 335 between these two campaigns . in other words ,",
    "the position of mrk 335 on the @xmath5@xmath6  relationship changed predictably given the expected photoionization slope of @xmath57 ( i.e. , @xmath58 ) .",
    "no previous reverberation mapping measurements exist for mrk 1501 .",
    "we measure @xmath26  =  15.5@xmath59 days and a resulting black hole mass of @xmath1  =  ( 1.84  @xmath54  0.27 )  @xmath19  10@xmath60  _ m@xmath61 .",
    "as noted above , this object lies noticeably to the right of the @xmath5@xmath6  relation , which is expected since we have not yet subtracted the host galaxy contribution to the 5100  luminosity due to the lack of hst imaging data .",
    "as mentioned above , once we have corrected for host subtraction we expect the object to lie below the relation , but still within the normal scatter .",
    "3c120 was observed by @xcite and reanalyzed by @xcite .",
    "the latter study reported @xmath62  =   39.4@xmath63  days , corresponding to @xmath1  =   5.55@xmath64  @xmath19  10@xmath65  _ m@xmath61 .",
    "we included 3c120 in our campaign in an effort to reduce the large uncertainties in @xmath4 .",
    "our new measurement of @xmath26  =  27.2@xmath66 days leads to @xmath1  =  ( 6.7  @xmath54  0.6 )  @xmath19  10@xmath65  _ m@xmath61 , which is consistent with the previous measurements , but has much smaller uncertainties due to both better - sampled light curves and the improved techniques of measuring lags using spear .",
    "our new measurements place this object slightly below the @xmath5@xmath6  relation , consistent with its previously - measured position .",
    "mrk 6 was observed in reverberation studies by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , who measured h@xmath0time lags using cross correlation .",
    "@xcite report @xmath62 = 21.1  @xmath54  1.9  days .",
    "this measurement was used to calculate @xmath1  =  ( 1.8  @xmath54  0.2 )  @xmath67 _ m@xmath61 .",
    "this study used light curves that cover a very long time period with more sparse sampling than our campaign .",
    "because of our dense time sampling , our light curves are sensitive to lags as small as a day or two .",
    "we measure a h@xmath0  time lag of 9.2  @xmath54  0.8  days and @xmath1  =  ( 1.36  @xmath54  0.13 )  @xmath68  _ m@xmath61 .",
    "our new @xmath26 measurement is substantially lower than the previous measurement  however , varying blr sizes are expected if the luminosity of the object changes , in accordance with the @xmath5@xmath6  relation . in this case , the previous study reports lower agn luminosity measurements than we find , and by the @xmath5@xmath6  relation we would also expect a smaller @xmath26 measurement in their data .",
    "however , they measure a lag on order of twice the length of ours , so this difference can not be explained by a change in luminosity state .",
    "to investigate , we ran the light curves from @xcite through both the ccf and spear analysis software , and obtain results that are generally consistent with theirs to within errors when using cross correlation .",
    "however , we do note that the lags we measure using spear are noticeably lower than the lags they report when we confine our attention to their more well - sampled light curves .",
    "for example , with their best - sampled light curves that cover the end of their observing period , we measure @xmath26  =  11.5@xmath69 days , where they report @xmath26 = 20.4@xmath70 days for the same light curves .",
    "the median spacing between observations in the @xcite light curves is always above 10 days , which we suspect renders their light curves insensitive to lags shorter than this .",
    "we are confident that our measurement of @xmath26  =  9.2 days is accurate for our data set , as the lag signal is clearly visible in our light curves and the sampling rate is very high in both the continuum and h@xmath0  light curves .",
    "mrk 6 has a very interesting h@xmath0  profile ( see figure [ fig : f1 ] ) that has been observed to change dramatically both in flux and shape ( @xcite , @xcite ) . the rms line profile from our study is clearly double - peaked and shows significant blending of the heii  emission with the h@xmath0emission . to verify that our line width measurement is not affected by the heii  component ,",
    "we fit a second - order polynomial to the heiifeature in the rms spectrum and subtracted it from the total rms spectrum .",
    "we then re - measured the line width from this new spectrum and obtained a measurement consistent with that taken from the entire rms spectrum .",
    "this suggests that the heii  blending did not affect our measurement of @xmath48 , so we adopted our original measurement for use in the @xmath1  calculations .",
    "there are a variety of physical models that can produce this double - peaked profile , many of which we expect would show clear velocity - resolved signatures in our data .",
    "this analysis is beyond the scope of this paper and will be explored in detail in a future work .",
    "initial reverberation results for pg2130 + 099 were first published by @xcite , who measured a value of @xmath26 on the order of 200 days and thus inferred a black hole mass of 1.4  @xmath19  10@xmath71  _ m@xmath61 .",
    "it was a significant outlier on both the @xmath1@xmath2  and @xmath5@xmath6  relations . however , pg2130 + 099 was later re - observed and measured to have @xmath4  =  22.9@xmath72  days and @xmath1  =  ( 3.8  @xmath54  1.5 )  @xmath19  @xmath73  _",
    "m@xmath61  ( @xcite ) , both of which are about an order of magnitude smaller than the original measurements .",
    "the discrepancy was attributed to undersampled light curves in the first measurements , as well as long - term secular changes in the h@xmath0  equivalent width .",
    "while the 2008 data showed a clear reverberation signal , the amplitude of the variability in the study was quite low and the campaign was short in duration , rendering it insensitive to lags above 50 days , which made the light curves less than ideal .",
    "we included this object in our study in hopes of obtaining a better - sampled light curve sensitive to a wide range of time lags that would yield a more definitive result .",
    "our new measurements of @xmath26  =  @xmath74  days and @xmath1  =  ( 4.6  @xmath54  0.4 )  @xmath19  @xmath73  _",
    "m@xmath61  are consistent with those of @xcite , but with higher precision .",
    "note that pg2130 + 099 is in a noticeably different position on the @xmath5@xmath6  relation  it has moved nearly parallel to the relation from its previous location , since its luminosity has also changed . like mrk 335 ,",
    "this is consistent with the expectations from photoionization models of the blr .",
    "we have presented reverberation measurements for five objects studied in our 2010 observational campaign .",
    "we successfully measured the average size of the h@xmath0-emitting region in all five objects .",
    "four of these measurements constitute significant improvements in precision compared to previous measurements , and the fifth was the first reverberation measurement for the object .",
    "we also measured the line widths in these objects and used these to measure black hole masses , @xmath1 , for the sample . in all cases ,",
    "our new measurements are consistent with previous measurements , but with reduced uncertainties .",
    "we placed our objects on the most current @xmath5@xmath6  relationship and find that our new measurements place our objects in locations consistent with previous measurements when taking into account the poorer precision of past measurements and observed mean luminosity changes .",
    "this is consistent with the location of the blr being regulated by photoionization physics .",
    "we do not have host galaxy luminosity measurements for two of our objects , and these objects lie below the relation , as expected for objects with significant uncorrected host galaxy contamination in their luminosities ( @xcite ) .",
    "our work also demonstrates the utility of highly - sampled light curves in reducing uncertainties in blr radius measurements .",
    "a large sample of high - precision @xmath5  and @xmath1  measurements , such as the measurements presented here , is crucial in understanding the intrinsic scatter in the @xmath5@xmath6  relation as well as understanding the nature of other observed relations such as the @xmath1@xmath2  and @xmath1@xmath3  relationships .",
