    "hot x - ray emitting gas constitutes the dominant baryonic component in groups and clusters of galaxies .",
    "the metals in this intracluster medium ( icm ) are believed to originate mainly in material ejected from group and cluster galaxies by supernovae @xcite , with a smaller portion driven out by galaxies through galaxy  galaxy and galaxy  icm interactions ( @xcite , but see also @xcite ) . besides galactic stellar winds ,",
    "other non - gravitational processes have also played a role in redistributing the enriched gas , and more generally , in shaping the thermodynamic properties of the icm .",
    "these processes include radiative cooling @xcite , and heating and mixing of gas by active galactic nuclei @xcite .",
    "the spatial distribution of metals , and to some extent the temperature structure of the icm , reflect the action of such processes , thus offering insight into the importance and nature of the mechanisms , other than gravity , that have established the properties of the icm at the present epoch .",
    "groups of galaxies are particularly interesting in this context because such processes are expected to be relatively more important in low - mass systems due to their shallower gravitational potentials .",
    "iron and silicon comprise the major diagnostic elements for studies of the icm abundance distribution , as these elements give rise to the most prominent lines in the soft x - ray spectrum of thermal plasmas , and are among the elements for which there is a distinctively different yield in type  ia and type  ii supernova explosions according to standard supernova ( sn ) models ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) . whilst iron is predominantly produced by sn  ia",
    ", silicon is more evenly mixed between the two sn types .",
    "the ratio of si to fe abundance therefore provides valuable information on the relative importance of sn  ia vs.  sn  ii in enriching the icm .",
    "abundance and temperature profiles of massive clusters have received considerable attention ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it is now well established that clusters with cool central regions typically exhibit high central fe abundances ( e.g. , @xcite ) which can be attributed predominantly to sn  ia enrichment by the stellar population of the central bright cluster galaxy @xcite .",
    "clusters with no evidence for strong central cooling tend to display a more uniform fe distribution .    at large radii ( @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the radius enclosing a mean density of 200  times the critical density )",
    ", @xmath5 typically drops to a value @xmath6  z@xmath1 @xcite . as suggested by , for example ,",
    "@xcite , this could result from sn  ii  dominated enrichment at an early stage in the cluster formation via energetic starburst winds .",
    "such a picture receives support from the observation that a substantial fraction of the icm metals were already in place by @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the situation in lower - mass systems is much less clear , despite their relatively larger importance for the cosmic baryon and metal budgets .",
    "historically , this has reflected the difficulty in assembling large samples of groups bright enough to allow detailed , spatially resolved x - ray spectroscopy .",
    "earlier works based on _ rosat _ and _ asca _ data typically featured only a handful of @xmath8  kev groups , often included as part of larger cluster - dominated samples ( e.g.@xcite ; @xcite ) . such studies suggested a @xmath9 ratio roughly solar in groups @xcite , about half the value found in early cluster studies @xcite , with an indication that si / fe rises above the solar ratio outside group cores ( e.g.@xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , the sensitivity and spatial resolution of _ rosat _ and _ asca _ imposed natural limits to the amount of detail one could obtain on the spatial variation of fe and si and hence the relative importance of the two supernova types at different group radii @xcite . for the same reasons , it is possible that the so - called fe and si biases @xcite may have affected some of these earlier results , at least for groups with thermally complex core regions .    with the current generation of x - ray telescopes ,",
    "the situation has improved dramatically .",
    "recent _ xmm _ observations have shown that temperature profiles of cool - core groups display a striking similarity and typically peak at a radius @xmath10 @xcite , which corresponds to @xmath11 for the mass profiles derived for these groups .",
    "another recent study , also based on _ xmm _ observations , is the work of @xcite , who investigated the distribution of temperature , density , metal abundance , and derived quantities using 2-d spectral mapping of a sample of 14 groups .",
    "this work showed that , as for clusters , central metal excesses are present in groups with a cool core , a result already hinted at in earlier _ asca _ studies @xcite .    while _ chandra _ lacks the sensitivity of _ xmm - newton _ , it has a superior spatial resolution , enabling a more robust removal of point sources , and also experiences a lower and more stable instrumental background .",
    "_ chandra _ data can therefore complement _ xmm _ observations of groups , particularly in the group cores , but can also serve as an important validity check on _ xmm _ results for the x - ray faint outskirts of groups due to the lower background . here",
    "we utilize this to derive radial profiles of temperature and the abundance of fe and si from _ chandra _ observations of a sample of 15 groups .",
    "particular emphasis is given to combining the results obtained for individual groups to explore statistical trends within the sample .",
    "one purpose of doing so is to obtain a clearer picture of the content and behaviour of metals in group outskirts , where most of the intragroup gas resides but where the low x - ray surface brightness often prohibits robust constraints for individual systems .",
    "in addition , this approach allows an investigation into the signatures of feedback in group gas , including the origin of metals in sn and the redistribution of gas by active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , in more detail than is possible on a group - by - group basis .",
    "furthermore , many numerical simulations of groups and clusters now include chemical evolution of the icm through the actions of galactic starburst winds ( e.g. , @xcite ) , agn outflows @xcite , and galaxy  icm interactions @xcite .",
    "therefore , it also seems timely to provide a firm observational baseline against which to test the input physics in such simulations , from the perspective of their predictions for the chemical ( and thermal ) properties of the icm in the group regime .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section  [ sec , sample ]",
    "we describe the group sample and data analysis procedure , and section  [ sec , results ] presents the main results for each group .",
    "section  [ sec , syst ] discusses the impact of systematic errors on our results . in section  [ sec ,",
    "combine ] we stack the results for individual groups , to investigate and quantify systematic trends across the sample .",
    "section  [ sec , conclude ] summarizes the results and presents our conclusions . in a companion paper ( rasmussen & ponman , in prep . ; hereafter paper  ii ) , we discuss the implications of these results for the history and nature of galactic feedback and chemical enrichment within the sample .",
    "@xmath12  km  s@xmath13  mpc@xmath13 is assumed throughout , and all errors are given at the 68  per  cent confidence level unless otherwise stated .",
    "our sample is predominantly based on the 25  gems groups from the ` g'-sample of @xcite .",
    "this subsample comprises those gems groups that display group - scale x - ray emission ( spatial extent of @xmath14  kpc ) , distinguished this way from systems that remain x - ray undetected and those in which the diffuse emission can be associated with the central galaxy rather than with the group as a whole . from these 25 groups , we effectively imposed a flux limit on the sample by only selecting systems with available _ chandra _ archival data containing more than 6,000 acis net counts from diffuse emission .",
    "this was done in order to enable robust , spatially resolved spectroscopy in a number of regions for each group . in addition , only groups more distant than 20  mpc were included , to ensure that data extended well outside the central group galaxy . as one of our aims is to investigate signatures of galactic feedback in group gas , and since we wish to study the radial distributions of gas properties , this study requires systems which appear reasonably undisturbed by recent merger activity and associated gas mixing .",
    "we therefore also excluded ngc  5171 from the sample , an obviously unrelaxed system already studied in detail by @xcite .",
    "this left 11 groups , to which we have added a further four groups with data in the _ chandra _ archive that conform to the same criteria .",
    "the resulting sample includes two hickson compact groups ( hcg  42 and 62 ) and a fossil group ( ngc  741 ) according to the definition of @xcite , and spans a temperature range @xmath152.1  kev , with a median temperature of @xmath16  kev and median redshift of @xmath17 .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that the selected groups are all reasonably x - ray bright and that the sample is by no means statistically representative .",
    "in fact , the invoked net counts criterion alone eliminated 13 of the 25 gems systems from which our sample was largely drawn , resulting in a sample lower limit of @xmath18  erg  s@xmath13 .",
    "three of our 15 groups are also included in the _ xmm _ sample of @xcite , with a further 6 included in the _ xmm _ sample of @xcite , enabling cross - comparison of the results obtained from the two instruments .    for all our data sets , calibrated event lists",
    "were regenerated using ciao v3.3 .",
    "for very faint mode observations , the standard additional background screening was carried out .",
    "bad pixels were screened out using the bad pixel map provided by the pipeline , and remaining events were grade filtered , excluding _ asca _",
    "grades 1 , 5 , and 7 . periods of high background were filtered using 3@xmath19 clipping of full  chip lightcurves , binned in time bins of length 259.8-s and extracted in off - source regions in the 2.57  kev band for back - illuminated chips and 0.312  kev for front - illuminated chips .",
    "blank - sky background data from the calibration database were screened and filtered as for source data , and reprojected to match the aspect solution of the latter .",
    "point source searches were carried out with the ciao task ` wavdetect ' using a range of scales and detection thresholds , and results were combined .",
    "source extents were quantified using the @xmath20 detection ellipses from ` wavdetect ' , and these regions were masked out in all subsequent analysis .",
    "diffuse emission from individual group galaxies other than the central early - type present in all groups was also masked out .    to provide a rough idea about the spatial distribution of x - ray emission in each system ,",
    "images of all groups are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig , mosaic ] , showing the adaptively smoothed , background - subtracted and exposure - corrected 0.72.5  kev emission on the relevant central ccd ( the acis - i array for ngc  6338 and ngc  7619 , acis - s2 for ngc  2300 , and s3 for all others ) .",
    "these images were generated following the procedure outlined in @xcite .",
    "although small - scale substructure is visible in some of the systems , with the second brightest group galaxy also seen in x - rays in a few cases , most of the groups are evidently reasonably dynamically relaxed , supporting the use of one - dimensional radial profiles to describe the spatial variation in hot gas properties of the systems .",
    "all regions used for spectral extraction were centred on the peak of the diffuse x - ray emission , which in most cases coincided to within 12  arcsec ( and always within 5  arcsec ) with the optical position of the brightest group galaxy as listed in the hyperleda database . for each ccd in each data set , the appropriate blank - sky data were scaled to match off - source count rates in the 1012  kev band and then used to generate background spectra .",
    "all spectra were fitted in xspec v11.3 in the 0.75  kev band , with the low - energy cut - off chosen such as to reduce contamination from residual galactic soft x - ray emission not accounted for by our blank - sky background subtraction ( see section  [ sec , syst ] for details ) .",
    "indeed , no systematic soft residuals between source and background spectra were seen within this energy band for any of the groups .    to put all groups on an equal footing ,",
    "all radii were normalized to @xmath2 , using @xmath21 which is an empirical relation based on data outside the cluster core for a sample of 39 groups and clusters , including eight systems with @xmath22  kev @xcite . in order to obtain a representative mean temperature @xmath23 for use with equation  ( [ eq , r500 ] ) , as well as a corresponding mean abundance @xmath24 , and to create spectral weights for subsequent fits in individual annuli ,",
    "a source spectrum was first extracted within the radial range 0.10.3  @xmath2 .",
    "this range was chosen because it extends to the maximum radius covered by acis for the more nearby systems , while in all cases being well outside the optical extent of the central galaxy .",
    "the latter was quantified as @xmath25 , the ellipse outlining a @xmath26-band isophotal level of 25  mag  arcsec@xmath27 .",
    "the associated fit results should therefore remain largely uncontaminated by x - ray emission from the interstellar medium and any unresolved point sources in the central galaxy .",
    "as we will see , this choice of radial range also excludes any cool core , in accord with our usage of equation  ( [ eq , r500 ] ) .",
    "the fits to these spectra all adopted an absorbed thermal apec model in xspec , assuming the abundance table from @xcite . using the derived value of @xmath23 with equation  ( [ eq , r500 ] ) ,",
    "@xmath2 was then re - evaluated iteratively , until the resulting values of @xmath23 varied by less than 1  per  cent . throughout",
    ", we will refer to the values of @xmath23 and @xmath24 obtained in this way as the mean temperature and abundance of each group .",
    "spectra were then extracted in concentric annuli containing at least 2000  net counts in the 0.71.5  kev band , and accumulated in bins of at least 25  net counts .",
    "spectral response products were weighted by a model of the ` mean ' spectrum extracted above .",
    "again , an absorbed apec model was first fitted to the data , yielding a mean temperature and abundance for the relevant annulus .",
    "a second fit was then performed using an absorbed vapec model , with all element abundances tied together except for fe and si .",
    "for spectra extracted inside the region covered by the central early - type galaxy , a power - law of fixed index @xmath28 was added to the spectral model , to account for any unresolved contribution from low - mass x - ray binaries .    to investigate the presence of multiple thermal components and address the importance of systematic errors associated with the fe bias @xcite",
    ", we also fitted a 2-@xmath29 plasma model to all bins inside the optical extent of the central galaxy , with both the fe and si abundance tied for the two thermal components .",
    "where either the resulting fe or si abundance was significantly different from the 1-@xmath29 result ( at 90  per  cent confidence ) , we adopted the best - fitting 2-@xmath29 values for both metals , confirming that a 2-@xmath29 model provided a better fit in all cases .",
    "as discussed in more detail in section  [ sec , syst ] , this was relevant for only five groups .",
    "we note that the adoption of the 2-@xmath29 results for the abundance in these five cases does not affect @xmath30 significantly , as this quantity has been derived within 0.10.3  @xmath2 , which is generally well outside the region for which 2-@xmath29 models provide superior fits in the relevant groups .",
    "owing to the layout of the acis chips , we do not have full azimuthal coverage of the groups at large angular distances from the group centres .",
    "our results at large radii could therefore be sensitive to azimuthal variations in fitted parameters . in an attempt to accommodate the systematic uncertainties",
    "associated with this , we used azimuthal variations at smaller radii to gauge the variations further out . for each group , a number of spectra were extracted from an annulus outside @xmath25 extending to the maximum radius of full coverage . to mimic the situation at large radii , only data within a narrow strip across this annulus",
    "were used , masking out the remaining regions to achieve , if possible , 2000  net  counts within the strip , as for the full - coverage annuli .",
    "this was repeated a number of times with varying strip position angles .",
    "the resulting spectra were then each fitted with a vapec model as described above , and the resulting standard variations on relevant parameters ( @xmath29 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 ) adopted as the systematic uncertainties at large radii .",
    "the mean uncertainties resulting from this approach were 8 , 34 , and 58  per  cent on @xmath29 , @xmath31 , and @xmath33 , respectively .",
    "these errors have been added in quadrature to the statistical errors obtained for all annuli with less than 75  per  cent azimuthal coverage ( for most groups just one or two radial bins ) .",
    "table  [ tab , groups ] records the position of the x - ray peak of each group , group distance @xmath34 corrected for virgocentric infall , the useful acis exposure time @xmath35 , @xmath23 and @xmath30 from the ` mean ' spectrum , @xmath2 from equation  ( [ eq , r500 ] ) , and the galactic value of the absorbing column density @xmath36 from @xcite as adopted in the fits .",
    "note that the statistical uncertainty on @xmath2 based on that of @xmath23 alone is typically on the order of just a few per  cent .",
    "the actual uncertainties on @xmath2 are therefore likely to be dominated by systematics associated with the use of equation  ( [ eq , r500 ] ) , but a quantification of this is beyond the scope of this paper .    [",

    "in this section we present the results for the projected radial profiles of temperature , fe and si abundance , and the ratio @xmath37 .",
    "as one of our aims is a statistical investigation of radial trends across the sample , the profiles have not been deprojected , since this would remove the statistical independence of the individual radial bins .",
    "however , we discuss the impact of deprojecting the data in section  [ sec , syst ] , showing that this would not compromise our general conclusions .    in order to compare observed abundances and their ratios to those expected from sn  ia and sn  ii enrichment , we adopted sn model yields taken from the literature . for sn  ia",
    ", the currently favoured delayed - detonation wdd2 scenario is assumed @xcite , while for core - collapse supernovae ( including types ib and ic ) , we have used the recent yields of @xcite .",
    "the latter were mass - averaged using a salpeter initial mass function ( imf ) for the progenitors over the range 1050  m@xmath1 ( see @xcite and @xcite for a justification of this choice of imf ) , so that @xmath38 is the mass of the @xmath39-th element produced in a star of mass @xmath40 , with @xmath41 .",
    "we have assumed a fractional metal mass of the sn  ii progenitors of @xmath42 ( i.e.  @xmath43  z@xmath1 ) , but the exact choice has no strong bearing on the resulting fe and si yields ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the resulting average stellar yields are @xmath44  m@xmath1 and @xmath45  m@xmath1 for fe and si from sn  ia , and @xmath46  m@xmath1 and @xmath47  m@xmath1 for core - collapse supernovae including sn  ii .",
    "we note that the yield uncertainties for sn  ii are substantial , a factor @xmath48 for fe and @xmath49  per  cent for si ; the yields adopted here are bracketed by the results of the different models considered by , for example , @xcite , and so can be viewed as representative of typical values in the literature . with the adopted abundance table ,",
    "the nominal abundance ratios expected for pure sn  ia and sn  ii enrichment are @xmath50  z@xmath51/z@xmath52 ( sn  ia ) and 2.62  z@xmath51/z@xmath53 ( sn  ii ) .",
    "note that this implies sn  ii dominance ( in absolute numbers ) for @xmath54 , and that a solar abundance ratio requires 3.4  sn  ii per sn  ia .    by adopting the sn  ia yields of @xcite , we restrict ourselves to the ` standard ' picture of a reasonably homogeneous population of sn  ia for simplicity .",
    "we note , however , that recent developments indicate that the situation could be more complex , with evidence for a diversity in sn  ia yields in cluster cores @xcite and for two distinct populations of sn  ia @xcite .",
    "radial temperature profiles for all groups derived from single - temperature models are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig , t ] , with the radii of all annuli normalized to @xmath2 .",
    "it is worth noting that emission is detected to fairly large radii in most of the groups , with the midpoint of our outermost radial bin corresponding to roughly 75  per  cent of @xmath2 .",
    "this can be ascribed to the relatively low and stable _ chandra _ background .",
    "in general , the temperature profiles appear remarkably similar , with all but one system ( ngc  4125 ) showing evidence for cooler gas in the central regions .",
    "the temperature profiles typically peak around @xmath55 and decline at large radii .",
    "there is also an indication that the profiles flatten in the central regions , in general agremeent with the group results of @xcite .",
    "compared to analogous profiles for relaxed clusters , this contrasts with the projected _ chandra _ temperature profiles of @xcite , the deprojected ones of @xcite , and the deprojected _ xmm _ profiles of @xcite , for which there is no clear evidence for a flattening at small radii . defining the gas entropy as @xmath56 , the deprojected cluster entropy profiles of @xcite _",
    "do _ show a central flattening , but this was attributed to a central core in the density distribution rather than a flattening of the temperature profile .",
    "the typical location of the temperature peaks in our sample is in excellent agreement with the _ xmm _ results of @xcite , who also found temperature peaks at @xmath57 for their cool - core groups and poor clusters .",
    "their sample has four groups in common with ours ( ngc  533 , mkw  4 , ngc  4325 , and ngc  5044 ) , and has @xmath2 evaluated directly from the mass profiles derived for each group .",
    "the good agreement with our results therefore also suggests that our estimates of @xmath2 are generally not seriously biased . as also noted by @xcite for their sample , the temperatures peak at larger overdensity than in clusters , where the profiles turn over at @xmath58 @xcite .",
    "it is clear , however , even when normalized to @xmath2 , that the exact radius @xmath59 at which the peak occurs ( in other words , the radial extent of the cool core ) varies slightly from group to group .",
    "naturally , this result will to some extent depend on the spatial resolution resulting from our binning criterion and thus the surface brightness of the group emission , but we note that the adopted spatial resolution does not depend systematically on , for example , group temperature .",
    "we discuss the location of the temperature peak in more detail in section  [ sec , temp2 ] .",
    "the abundance profiles of fe and si are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig , abund ] . in all systems except ngc  2300 , and possibly the non  cool core group ngc  4125",
    ", there is clear evidence for a central excess of iron , as also seen for cool - core clusters .",
    "this central excess often extends well beyond the optical extent of the central galaxy , and in some cases shows an off - centre peak inside @xmath25 , with a decline in abundance in the very centre .",
    "ngc  533 is perhaps the clearest example of this , but the majority of groups with a well - resolved core ( roughly 8/11 ) shows some evidence of this feature .",
    "this fe peak is typically accompanied by a similar feature in the si distribution , most clearly in hcg  42 , mkw  4 , and hcg  62 , with a hint of similar behaviour in a few more groups .",
    "potentially , the peak could be ascribed to fe / si bias inside the central galaxy , lowering the derived abundance in the very core , but as discussed below , we find little evidence that this effect is important for our analysis in general .",
    "in addition , such a peak is commonly seen also in well - resolved cluster cores where the fe bias is generally expected to be less important , e.g. , centaurus @xcite , perseus @xcite , a1795 @xcite , and a2199 @xcite .",
    "alternative explanations for the peak include agn redistribution of enriched gas ( e.g. , @xcite ) , resonant scattering of emission line photons in group cores @xcite , or gravitational sedimentation of helium nuclei in the core @xcite .",
    "we will discuss these possibilities in detail in paper  ii .    at large radii ,",
    "a common feature of the fe distributions is a drop in @xmath31 to a value of @xmath60  z@xmath1 . in some groups ,",
    "a rise in @xmath33 is also seen , largely independent of the behaviour of the fe profile .",
    "we note that there is no indication that derived profiles for the two hickson groups or the fossil group ngc  741 differ significantly from those of the rest of the sample in this context .    the silicon - to - iron ratio @xmath9 is plotted for all groups in fig .  [ fig , ratio ] .",
    "in many cases the ratio in the central bin is seen to be consistent with the solar ratio , with a contribution from sn  ii formally required for about half the groups . for the other half ,",
    "there is clear evidence for subsolar abundance ratios , consistent with enrichment by sn  ia alone .",
    "we do not believe there is any fundamental difference between the two subsamples if split according to this , as @xmath9 in the central bin clearly spans a continuous range of values rather than showing a bimodal distribution .",
    "given the variation in spatial resolution among the groups and the uncertainties on @xmath9 , we caution further against such an interpretation at this stage .",
    "for example , we find no evidence that the two subsamples cluster differently in the parameter space spanned by @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath61-band luminosity of the central galaxy .",
    "nevertheless , we will revisit this issue in paper  ii on the basis of integrated fe and si masses inside @xmath25 .",
    "as discussed by @xcite , there is observational evidence for diversity in sn  ia yields in the cool cores of more massive clusters , with solar si / fe ratios arising entirely from sn  ia .",
    "while our results allow for this possibility , we can not easily confirm that this result extends down into the group regime , as it is based on the abundances of additional elements such as s , ca , and ar . at the lower temperatures prevalent in groups , the abundances of these elements , with prominent emission lines in the range @xmath62  kev , are not in general robustly constrained . in the outer regions ,",
    "the interpretation of our data remains unaffected by this ; here a contribution from sn  ii is universally required within our sample , and the abundance ratios , given the typical uncertainties in sn  ii yields of a factor @xmath48 ( e.g.  @xcite ) , are consistent with pure sn  ii enrichment in all cases .",
    "many of the groups exhibit properties which warrant some additional comments .",
    "below , we briefly discuss each group in the sample in turn , with emphasis on the derived abundances .",
    "where relevant , we have also attempted a comparison of the derived fe profile to existing measurements , in particular the 2-@xmath34 _ xmm _ results of @xcite ( f06 and f07 in the following ) , while correcting for differences in adopted abundance tables .",
    "it should be noted , however , that due to our incomplete azimuthal coverage at large radii , direct comparison is not always straightforward for sources with some degree of asymmetry in the fe distribution . + * ngc  383 * : the central galaxy hosts the bright radio source 3c  31 , representing one of the few examples of a central group galaxy showing a clearly identified large - scale radio jet with a well - constrained jet power @xcite . despite this , the @xmath29 and @xmath63-profiles of this group do not exhibit any clear distinguishing features compared to the rest of our sample .",
    "for the temperature profile , this result is in accord with the group results of @xcite , which show that the slope of @xmath64 inside the cool core does not show any strong dependence on the radio power of the central radio source . +",
    "* ngc  507 * : an example of a group in which radio lobes are present around the central galaxy @xcite and in which the highest - metallicity gas is displaced from the group core , perhaps as a consequence of radio outbursts lifting enriched gas out of the core .",
    "if so , one might expect to see some degree of asymmetry in the fe distribution in the core .",
    "the 2-@xmath34 fe map of f07 does reveal some asymmetry inside @xmath65 , showing a high - metallicity blob south - west of the group core , but it is not immediately obvious that this is necessarily associated with an agn outflow . to achieve a satisfactory fit in the outermost radial bin in our data , it was necessary to exclude the second brightest group galaxy , ngc  499 , out to 6  arcmin ( @xmath66  kpc ) .",
    "comparison to the single-@xmath29 fe profile of f07 shows good overall agreement , including the off - centre fe peak at @xmath67 and the decline to @xmath68  z@xmath1 at @xmath69 .",

    "1.4-ghz nvss data @xcite reveal a central radio source .",
    "inside @xmath70 our fe results are consistent with the f07 value of @xmath71  z@xmath1 , as is our detection of the supersolar fe peak at @xmath72 .",
    "the clear decline to 0.1  z@xmath1 at large @xmath73 is not obvious from the f07 results , however , which show considerable scatter outside @xmath74 .",
    "we speculate that this relates to our assumption of circular symmetry and our incomplete azimuthal coverage at large radii .",
    "the 2-@xmath34 fe map of f07 suggests an elongated abundance structure on large scales , with the acis - s array in our _ chandra _ data running very nearly perpendicular to the major axis of this structure .",
    "this implies that our result includes low - metallicity gas at the largest radii , beyond those included in the f07 analysis , and that we are inevitably missing some of the higher - metallicity gas seen by f07 . +",

    "another possibility , potentially induced by the very low central temperature , is that high-@xmath63 gas has cooled out in the group core .",
    "based on the measured x - ray flux , the fitted spectral parameters , and the gas density profile of @xcite , we estimate a central cooling time of only @xmath79  yr . this would render such cool - out a viable scenario , in particular in light of the absence of any strong radio source in the central early - type ( 1.4  ghz radio power @xmath80  w  hz@xmath13 based on the nvss flux ) which could indicate ongoing agn heating activity . in order to remove any fe excess and explain the ` suppressed ' fe level in the core , a total fe mass of @xmath81  m@xmath1 must have cooled out inside the typical radial extent of the fe excess of @xmath82 , assuming an initial fe abundance of @xmath71  z@xmath1 ( see section  [ sec , combine ] for this choice of parameters ) .",
    "this is equivalent to a total gas mass of @xmath83  m@xmath1 , which does not seem an unreasonably large amount .",

    "however , although a radio source is present in nvss data inside @xmath25 , this source is displaced from the optical and x - ray centre by 0.8  arcmin ( 4  kpc ) . to investigate the nature of the central x - ray source ,",

    "an alternative explanation for the central temperature rise could be sought in the fact that the central elliptical is ` dynamically young ' @xcite , so a merger event within the past few gyr could have disturbed the central regions and mixed in hotter gas from larger radii .",
    "the derived central cooling time is very short , however , @xmath96  yr as for ngc  2300 , but increasing to more than 3  gyr at @xmath25 as a consequence of the sharply peaked surface brightness , and hence density , profile @xcite . as this is a factor of three above the sound crossing time within that region",

    "before proceeding to discuss the results in more detail , we address a number of analysis issues which could be affecting our results .",
    "these include the presence of fe and si biases in the group core , and the reliability of our background estimates .",
    "an immediate , although indirect , indication that such issues are not having a major impact on our results , is the fact , discussed below , that we detect the same overall radial trend in @xmath29 and @xmath63 for all systems , despite considerable variations in both source and background flux across the sample .",
    "for the temperature profiles , the agreement with the _ xmm _  result of @xcite for the mean position of the temperature peak is encouraging . moreover , there is good overall agreement with derived fe profiles for the six groups overlapping with the _ xmm _ sample of @xcite , even at large radii where systematic uncertainties related to background subtraction could be important .",
    "one issue which could call the robustness of our results into question is the fact that our profiles are projected ones , so all bins contain some contribution from emission further out . to test the importance of this effect , we deprojected the profiles for a few groups using the projct model in xspec . for simplicity",
    ", a 1-@xmath29 apec model was fitted to the data .",
    "the result for ngc  4325 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig , projct ] .",
    "this group is typical of our sample in terms of the number of radial bins and the value of @xmath108 ; it also shows a near - solar si / fe ratio throughout , so the measurements should not be biased strongly by fixing the relative abundances .",
    "the figure demonstrates reasonable overall agreement between projected and deprojected results .",
    "as can be seen , projection tends to slightly reduce the temperature gradient in the core , as would be expected .",
    "while the deprojected abundance profile recovers the increased fe level in the region inside @xmath109 , significant fluctuations between adjacent bins are evident in this region in disagreement with the projected profile .",
    "these are most likely artefacts related to issues of fit stability , a problem commonly arising for spectral deprojections involving a large number of bins ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "results for less well - resolved systems support this suspicion and confirm the lack of systematic variations between projected and deprojected results .",
    "we therefore conclude that our results are reasonably reliable representations of the three - dimensional profiles .",
    "another issue is the fact that we have incomplete azimuthal coverage at large radii .",
    "this could potentially play a role for individual groups in which a simple radial description of the abundance profile breaks down in the outskirts .",
    "as mentioned , however , we have attempted to select systems with a reasonably regular x - ray morphology , and we have also tried to accommodate any remaining uncertainties related to this in our error analysis .",
    "the good overall agreement with _",
    "results at large radii indicates that this effect is not important , at least for the groups where a comparison is possible .",
    "in addition , any bias would be strongly suppressed when averaging the results across the group sample , which is the approach taken in the next section .",
    "we therefore believe our conclusions to be robust against this effect .",
    "it is well known that high - quality observations of groups in many cases reveal disturbed central structures , showing that group cores can be thermally complex ( e.g.  @xcite ) and require multi - component thermal models to properly fit their spectra . to investigate this",
    ", we plotted the distribution of reduced @xmath110 values for all our fits , but found no clear trend with radius and no indication that multi - temperature models are generally _ required _ to describe the central regions .",
    "nevertheless , particularly for systems such as ngc  383 , where the central cool regions are not well resolved because of our binning criterion , the presence of multi - phase gas could lead to artificially low abundance estimates in the innermost bin @xcite , and metallicities derived from 1-@xmath29 fits should here be regarded with some caution .",
    "we tested for this effect by first radially subdividing the central radial bin and fitting spectra extracted within each of these two sub - bins .",
    "eight of the 15 groups show evidence for @xmath29 variations between those two sub - bins . for all systems , the abundance values within the two sub - bins",
    "were consistent with the full - bin value , and only one group displays evidence for @xmath63 variation between the two sub - bins ( ngc  383 , with the innermost sub - bin showing a lower value ) .",
    "however , this does not in itself rule out the presence of multi - phase gas within each of these two sub - bins .",
    "a further test therefore involved fitting two - temperature models to all bins within @xmath25 , as already described in section  [ sec , specfit ] . only for five groups",
    "do we find evidence that 2-@xmath29 models yield significantly higher abundances _ and _ provide superior fits , in some of the innermost radial bins ( fig .",
    "[ fig , abund ] ) . for these , the 2-@xmath29 results for the abundances have been adopted , as plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig , abund ] .",
    "an example is ngc  507 , for which only the 2-@xmath29 fit recovers the high fe abundance of 23  z@xmath1 reported inside @xmath25 by @xcite on the basis of _ xmm _ data .",
    "while 2-@xmath29 models certainly provide better fits in some cases , it is perhaps slightly surprising that they only yield significantly different abundances in a few of these , given the presence of central temperature variations in most of our groups .",
    "a possible explanation is that we are typically sampling the core regions with rather finely spaced annuli .",
    "the limited radial extent of each annulus may imply that mixing of temperature components may not be important within each bin .",
    "for example , for the very core of mkw  4 , @xcite also find from the same _ chandra _ data that 2@xmath29 models do not produce significantly improved fits or higher @xmath31 , in agreement with our results .",
    "a different conclusion was reached by @xcite based on _ xmm _ data , which @xcite attribute to the much larger spectral extraction region used by the latter authors .",
    "support for this interpretation is provided by the work of @xcite , which shows that _ chandra _ spectra of elliptical galaxies can generally be described by 1-@xmath29 models , and that the multi-@xmath29 fits required to describe earlier _ asca _ spectra of the same objects were an artefact of sampling strong temperature gradients with poorer spatial resolution . the fact that we generally find 2@xmath29 models to yield better fits and higher abundances only for groups where our innermost bin covers a large fraction of @xmath25 , would seem to add support for this interpretation . indeed , as discussed in paper  ii , for spectra covering the full region inside @xmath74 ( a region much larger than that covered by the central bin in all groups ) , we find that two - phase models are in most cases statistically required .",
    "in addition , we note that the introduction of a @xmath111 power - law to account for unresolved x - ray binaries in the central early - type also mitigates the need for a 2-@xmath29 model in some cases .",
    "it is finally worth noting that any remaining fe bias would only strengthen the result that an fe excess is present in the cores of most of our groups . qualitatively , therefore , the only significant feature potentially induced by the fe bias would be the off - centre fe peak seen in some systems .",
    "however , some of our groups for which 2@xmath29 models provide better fits and significantly enhanced abundances in the central regions , such as ngc  507 , still show evidence for such fe and si peaks , suggesting this feature is reasonably robust to such a bias .",
    "another important issue is the accuracy of our background subtraction .",
    "this is mainly relevant at large radii , where the emission at all energies is typically dominated by the background .",
    "as mentioned , we use blank - sky data to extract background spectra , scaled to match the 1012  kev count rates of our source data for each ccd . the resulting medium - to - hard background above @xmath112",
    "kev seems properly accounted for in all cases , as there is no statistically significant residual emission above this energy within the spectral extraction regions employed for _ any _ data set . of potentially more concern",
    "is the soft x - ray background below @xmath113  kev , whose intensity varies considerably across the sky . for 10 out of our 15 groups , the _ rosat _ all - sky survey @xmath114 ( 0.50.9  kev ) background count rates are within @xmath115 ( @xmath116  per  cent deviation ) of the analogous value for the relevant blank - sky background data , lending support to our use of the latter for background estimation .",
    "while most of our groups are thus not projected onto regions of significantly enhanced or depleted soft x - ray background , there are a few exceptions which all show enhanced background , most notably ngc  5044 and ngc  5846 which both lie close to the north polar spur .    for most of our systems ,",
    "intragroup emission covers the field of view ( @xmath2 is outside the field of view in most cases ) , so we can not in general use the outer portions of the observed fields to reliably assess the level of any residual soft background . instead , two independent tests were performed to assess the impact of varying the assumed background : we either simply rescaled the blank - sky background , or added a separate background model component in the fits to the group emission .    in the first test , we repeated all fits for the three outermost radial bins of each group , with the blank - sky background normalization shifted by @xmath117  per  cent .",
    "the fits were performed in the 0.72.0  kev band only , to prevent the obvious mismatch resulting at higher energies from affecting the results .",
    "we found that this in general induced negligible changes in the best - fitting temperature , which remained consistent with the value derived for the ` unperturbed ' background in all but two cases ( when increasing the background for ngc  4125 and ngc  6338 ) , for which the resulting fits were statistically unacceptable anyway . if anything , the best - fitting value of @xmath29 is slightly lower in all cases , so there is no indication that the temperature decline observed in all groups at large radii can be ascribed to inaccurate background subtraction .",
    "we therefore conclude that the large - scale behaviour of the temperature profiles in fig .",
    "[ fig , t ] is a robust result .",
    "the resulting abundances are more sensitive to variations in the assumed background level .",
    "for three of the groups ( hcg  42 , ngc  1407 , and ngc  2300 ) rescaling the background produced higher abundances in the outermost bin , inconsistent with the result obtained using our standard background level .",
    "none of these cases yielded unacceptable fits , so we conclude that significantly higher values of @xmath63 in the outermost region probed for these systems are allowed , though not favoured , by the data . however , at least in the case of hcg  42 , there is good reason to believe that the existing abundance measurement is fairly reliable , as it compares well to the result derived independently from _ xmm _ data @xcite .",
    "similar agreement is found for ngc  2300 when compared to earlier _ rosat _ and _ asca _ results ( see @xcite ) . as an additional test",
    ", we also tried varying the background normalization by @xmath118  per  cent for all groups . in the four cases where",
    "the resulting fits did not become either significantly worse or statistically unacceptable , the derived @xmath29 and @xmath63 were consistent with the results obtained using the unperturbed background .    as a second test , carried out for the five groups with significantly enhanced soft background , we included a spectral model to account for this excess background , and repeated all fits outside the cool core with this model added to that used to describe the group emission . following @xcite and @xcite , a fixed @xmath119  kev , @xmath120  z@xmath1 mekal background model was assumed , with only its normalization allowed to vary . only for ngc  5846 , which  along with ngc  5044  shows the highest background excess ,",
    "did we find significant changes in fitted parameters , with this ( improved ) fit yielding lower fe and si abundances , which we have consequently adopted . for ngc  5044 , no changes were seen , possibly because of the relatively high signal - to - noise ratio in the outermost bins for this group .",
    "we confirmed that soft background excess is not an issue for the remainder of the sample .",
    "for example , for relatively compact low  surface - brightness sources such as hcg  42 and ngc  4125 , there is no statistically significant residual emission in the 0.72  kev band in a 2  arcmin wide annulus extending to the edge of the field of view . for the adopted soft background model , only 15  per  cent of the total 0.50.9  kev flux ( used to determine the presence of a soft excess ) falls at energies above 0.7  kev .",
    "the fact that energies below 0.7  kev are excluded in spectral fitting should therefore also reduce the problem .",
    "finally , we do not see any systematic low - energy ( @xmath1211  kev ) residuals for any of the spectra .",
    "this suggests that systematic uncertainties in our background subtraction is not a major issue at low energies either .",
    "a radial profile of some quantity may not always provide a useful description for an individual system due to departures from spherical symmetry .",
    "the average of many such profiles derived for different groups should be much less affected though . since our radial measurements for individual groups are statistically independent ( as they are based on projected profiles ) , it is possible to explore general trends in the radial distributions of @xmath29 and @xmath63 by superposing and averaging the profiles derived for individual groups . with the robustness of our results well established",
    ", we can therefore proceed to discuss these in a statistical framework on the basis of correlation tests and orthogonal regression analyses @xcite performed on the combined measurements . throughout the section",
    ", we have used the kendall rank - order correlation coefficient @xmath122 ( in the range @xmath123 $ ] , with @xmath124 for a strong , positive correlation ) , and the associated significance @xmath125 of @xmath122 being non - zero , to quantify the strength and nature of any linear relationship between various quantities .      in order to examine the overall radial behaviour of @xmath29 for our sample , we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig , tnorm ] all temperature measurements , normalized to the mean temperature @xmath126 of each group . in the plot ,",

    "for ngc  4125 , which has a monotonically decreasing @xmath64 , we have grouped the data points inside @xmath25 with those at @xmath128 .",
    "as discussed , temperature variations clearly exhibit a very similar overall behaviour .",
    "similar to the case for clusters ( e.g.@xcite ) , and as discussed quantitatively below , there is a clear indication that the intrinsic scatter in @xmath129 is larger in the central regions , inwards of the temperature peak .",
    "this is not surprising , as non - gravitational processes other than radiative cooling could be important in this region , thus helping to break any self - similarity otherwise induced by gravity .    at first glance ,",
    "figure  [ fig , tnorm ] appears to be suggestive of a bimodality in @xmath64 in the core regions , but this could be largely driven by ngc  5044 , which is better sampled than the other groups and displays lower central values of @xmath130 than the majority . to investigate this in more detail",
    ", we tested for any evidence of bimodality in @xmath130 by extracting the value for each group around a specific overdensity radius inside the cool core , excluding the non - cool core system ngc4125 . for @xmath131 , the smallest radius shown in fig .",
    "[ fig , tnorm ] , a kolmogorov - smirnov test indicates a 65  per  cent probability that the resulting values have been drawn from a single gaussian distribution with the given mean and variance . at @xmath132 , however , there is some evidence for bimodality ( see inset in fig .",
    "[ fig , tnorm ] ) , with the corresponding probability being only 12  per  cent , but increasing again to 45 and 91  per  cent at 0.05 and @xmath133 , respectively .",

    "there is also no strong indications of bimodality at significantly smaller or larger radii .    in order to investigate the potential role of agn feedback in establishing this tentative bimodality",
    ", we searched for a central radio source in the brightest group galaxy following the procedure outlined in @xcite .",
    "such a source was clearly identified in 11 of the groups ( with the off - centre source in ngc4125 as an additional candidate ) , and with hcg42 , mkw4 , and ngc4325 as the only clear exceptions .",
    "for these 11 groups , testing for a linear correlation between @xmath130 at @xmath134 and the 1.4  ghz power of this central radio source yields a value of kendall s @xmath135 and an associated significance of @xmath136 .",
    "thus , there is marginal statistical evidence for a correlation , but this is largely driven by the two most powerful sources ( in ngc383 and ngc741 ) , without which any correlation is absent ( @xmath137 ) . in conclusion , there appears to be no clear connection between this potential @xmath64 bimodality and the current radio output of a central agn .",
    "a larger sample would be useful for a more decisive test of the presence of a bimodality , and for addressing its possible origin .",
