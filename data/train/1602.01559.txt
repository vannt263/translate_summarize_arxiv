    "many creative ways to simulate quantum systems with superconducting circuits have been proposed or implemented .",

    "one class of simulators can be built with an array of superconducting circuit elements usually fabricated on a chip  @xcite .",
    "the quanta of the excitations on those circuit elements simulate an ensemble of quantum particles .",
    "for example , coupled superconducting qubits as an analogue of a spin array can be a simulator of the ising model  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , photonic excitations in a circuit - qed array may serve as an analogue of lattice bosons  @xcite , and effective photon interactions could be created by utilizing strong light - matter couplings between superconducting resonators and qubits  @xcite . by fabricating circuit qed elements in desired patterns , various lattice structures can be explored and local controls over coherent or dissipative dynamics can also be studied  @xcite .",

    "the bhm has been an important paradigm in many - body theories  @xcite , in particular the mott insulator - superfluid ( mi - sf ) phase transition it describes . the mott insulator is a localized state occurring at integer fillings when interaction energy dominates , while the superfluid is a delocalized state where kinetic energy dominates . in superlattices or other complex geometries",
    ", the bhm can exhibit many interesting phases and phenomena  @xcite . in certain geometries with multiple sites per unit cell ,",
    "some of the bands known as flat bands can become non - dispersive .",
    "particles in a flat band form degenerate localized eigenstates , and this particular feature may lead to interesting phases including supersolid  @xcite or topological insulator  @xcite .",

    ", it is difficult to approach the @xmath7 point from finite-@xmath41 because @xmath41 depends monotonically on the detuning @xmath40 .",
