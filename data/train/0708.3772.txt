    "z@xmath0 models , as the simplest statistical mechanics models with discrete global symmetries , have been studied for many years .",
    "they are interesting , both as lattice models and in the continuum limit as quantum field theories , because they exhibit semi - locality properties , such as fractional spin @xcite , which arise in various other domains of physics .",
    "the simplest examples of these models are the well - known ising model ( @xmath1 ) , three - state potts model ( @xmath2 ) , and ashkin - teller model ( @xmath3 ) , all exactly solvable to some extent .",
    "the phase diagram of the nearest neighbour z@xmath0 model in two dimensions for @xmath4 was elucidated in @xcite , but in the general case it is still not known .",
    "although these lattice models for @xmath5 have complicated phase diagrams with several critical surfaces , fateev and zamolodchikov @xcite showed that there are some points ( hereinafter referred to as fz points ) in the critical surface at which these models are solvable , in the sense that they satisfy generalised star - triangle relations .",
    "moreover there is strong evidence that the scaling limit at these points corresponds to zamolodchikov and fateev s parafermionic conformal field theory @xcite . in this article",
    "we give further evidence for this connection .",
    "in particular we find lattice candidates for the holomorphic parafermions of the continuum model , and show that these satisfy a discrete version of the cauchy - riemann equations .",
    "we also extend this result to models with anisotropic interactions .",
    "we show that as long as the lattice is correctly embedded in the plane , we can again construct discretely holomorphic parafermions .",
    "we may use this to conjecture the location of the fz critical surface of these anisotropic z@xmath0 lattice models .",
    "in fact , our methods can be extended to any non - uniform lattice of the baxter type @xcite , thanks to a result of kenyon and schlenker @xcite about embedding such lattices in the plane .",
    "identifying discretely holomorphic objects in lattice models is an important step in showing that the scaling limit of suitably defined curves in these models is described by schramm - loewner evolution ( sle ) @xcite .",
    "suitable candidates for sle curves in z@xmath0 models have been suggested by santachiara @xcite ( see also gamsa and cardy @xcite for the case @xmath2 ) .",
    "we expect that our results will be the first step in showing that this is indeed the case .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in the second section we briefly review some related properties of z@xmath0 models , and the corresponding parafermionic conformal field theories .",
    "we define the disorder variables on the isotropic square lattice , similarly to the case of the z@xmath0 clock models @xcite and the potts model @xcite .",
    "we then define lattice parafermions as products of neighbouring order and disorder variables , with a suitable phase factor . using the boltzmann weights of the model at the fz point ,",
    "we then show that there are local linear relations between parafermions , which are equivalent to discrete holomorphicity .",
    "this is our first main result .    in the third section we consider lattices with anisotropic interactions and",
    "show that there are special points , which we identify with anisotropic fz points , at which there is a certain embedding of the lattice on the plane for which discrete holomorphicity is again recovered .",
    "we further extend this to the case of baxter lattices @xcite , where we show that the existence of a rhombic embedding @xcite for such lattices allows us simply to generalise our results .",
    "it should be mentioned that the importance of rhombic embeddings ( and the related isoradial embeddings ) was central to the work of duffin @xcite , mercat @xcite and bobenko _",
    "et al._@xcite in the general theory of discrete holomorphy .",
    "similar ideas have been used in other lattice models by kenyon @xcite and bazhanov _ et al .",
    "the general z@xmath0 model on an arbitrary graph can be defined by associating to every node of the graph a variable @xmath6 which takes values in the set @xmath7 , @xmath8 , where @xmath9 .",
    "each configuration occurs with probability @xmath10 where the product is over all the edges @xmath11 of the graph , and @xmath12 is the partition function .",
    "the weights @xmath13 take the general form @xmath14 where @xmath15 denotes complex conjugation . assuming @xmath16 , we can always set it equal to unity .",
    "reality of the weights implies that @xmath17 , which means that one can describe them by just @xmath18 $ ] real parameters .",
    "the weights are invariant under the global group z@xmath19 , @xmath20 , as well as charge conjugation @xmath21 .    in",
    "what follows , except for the last section , we consider the graph to be a regular lattice , with translationally invariant couplings @xmath22 , which may however depend on the lattice orientation of the edge @xmath11 .    for @xmath1 and @xmath23",
    "it is easy to see that the model is equivalent to the ising model and three state potts model respectively , whose critical points correspond to well understood minimal conformal field theories with @xmath24 .",
    "the higher values of @xmath25 are related to more complicated theories with rich phase diagrams@xcite .",
    "nearest - neighbour z@xmath0 models exhibit kramers - wannier duality symmetry , which is important in understanding their phase diagrams .",
    "if all of the @xmath26 with @xmath27 have the same value , we have the well - known @xmath25-state potts model , which has a single first - order transition for @xmath5 . in general for @xmath28 the theory has a critical surface on which the exponents may vary continuously .",
    "it has been conjectured that there are @xmath29 points in the phase diagram which correspond to special kind of conformal field theories called fateev - zamolodchikov ( fz ) parafermionic models of the first kind @xcite .",
    "this has been verified by numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "our lattice holomorphic operators , described below , are another evidence for this conjecture .",
    "these conformal field theories have the central charge @xmath30 the cases @xmath31 coinciding with the central charge of @xmath32 minimal cfts .",
    "kramers - wannier symmetry manifests itself in @xmath33 order parameter fields @xmath34 and @xmath33 dual disorder fields @xmath35 , which are conjectured to be the continuum version of the order and disorder variables on the original lattice .",
    "zamolodchikov and fateev , using only the z@xmath19 symmetry , showed that there also exist holomorphic operators ( that is , operators whose correlation functions are analytic functions except at coincident points ) with the following dimensions ( equal to their conformal spin ) @xmath36    we now give our construction of the lattice analogs of these objects .",
    "we first consider the homogenous isotropic z@xmath0 model on the square lattice .    in the first step let define the disorder operators @xmath37 on the sites of dual lattice , which , in this case , is again another square lattice whose vertices are at the centers @xmath38 of the faces of the original lattice .",
    "the insertion of a disorder operator @xmath39 corresponds to modifying the weights so that the order operator @xmath6 has monodromy @xmath40 on taking the point @xmath41 in a closed circuit around @xmath38 .",
    "this is equivalent to introducing a path , or string , on the sites of the dual lattice from @xmath38 to infinity ( or some other point on the boundary ) , such that the weights on edges @xmath11 intersected by the string are modified by the substitution @xmath42 .",
    "thus the disorder operator has the following form for the general z@xmath0 model @xmath43    it is not difficult to see that the disorder variables have the same @xmath44-symmetry similar to the spin variables , @xmath45 , and that , up to a gauge transformation , the definition ( [ disorder operator ] ) is path - independent .",
    "an elementary square of the covering lattice ( solid lines  rotated by 45@xmath46 to correspond to the conventions in the text . ) the opposite pairs of vertices are associated with order ( @xmath47 ) and disorder ( @xmath48 ) operators respectively .",
    "the parafermions @xmath49 are associated with the edges .",
    "discrete holomorphicity at the fz points means that the contour sum of the parafermions around each face vanishes .",
    "also shown is part of the original square lattice ( dashed lines ) and the string ( dotted line ) attached to the disorder operators .",
    ", width=226 ]    consider the square which the vertices are made by the two neighbouring spin variables @xmath50 and the two neighbouring disorder variables @xmath51 ( fig1 .  [ fig1 ] ) . by taking the string from @xmath52 to run along the dual edge @xmath53 , from ( [ disorder operator ] )",
    "we can write the following relation @xmath54 we will need the exact value of the @xmath26 at the fz point , which for the isotropic square lattice have the following compact form @xcite @xmath55    for clarity , let us first focus on the simplest case @xmath1 . by multiplying both side of ( [ relation between disorder operators ] ) by the denominator and then by multiplying the result by @xmath56 we find the following equation @xmath57 a similar equation can be found by exchanging @xmath58 . by combining these two equations ( multiplying the second equation by @xmath59 and adding this to the first )",
    "one finds @xmath60 note that for this to happen it is crucial that we use the critical value @xmath61 .",
    "( for the special case of the ising model , when @xmath62 the right hand side of ( [ holomorphic equation ising ] ) is proportional to the antiholomorphic fermion @xcite . )",
    "( [ holomorphic equation ising ] ) has the form of a discrete contour integral around each elementary square of the covering lattice ( the union of the dual lattice with the original lattice ) @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the angle that the directed segment @xmath65 makes with the @xmath66-axes , with the convention @xmath67 , in this case these angles are just @xmath68 but in the next section we will see more general cases .",
    "by changing @xmath69 one can find the similar equation for the discrete antiholomorphic fermions .",
    "these two linear equations are a lattice discretised form of the cauchy - riemann equations .",
    "the calculation for @xmath2 is very similar . multiplying both sides of equation ( [ relation between disorder operators ] ) by the denominator , and then by @xmath56 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 we can find three linear equations in the six variables @xmath72 . by eliminating @xmath73 one again finds a discretely holomorphic equation of the form ( [ holomorphic equation ] ) with now @xmath74 once again , this works only at the fz point given by ( [ fzpoint ] ) .",
    "the case @xmath3 is very similar and we will discuss the results later .",
    "@xmath75 is more interesting .",
    "this model has two fz points @xmath76 and @xmath77 corresponding to the transformation @xmath78 which exchanges @xmath79 and @xmath80 . for this case the equation ( [ relation between disorder operators ] ) has the following form @xmath81 for the @xmath82 case by multiplying the above equation by @xmath83 one finds the following equation @xmath84 and four other equations by permuting the terms @xmath85 .",
    "the next step is to eliminate the terms involving @xmath86 from the above five equations .",
    "the calculation is rather cumbersome , so we resorted to using mathematica .",
    "the result is as follows : for @xmath82 it is possible to eliminate the above terms only at the first fz point @xmath87 , in which case we obtain the holomorphic equation ( [ holomorphic equation ] ) with the holomorphic variable @xmath88 .    for @xmath89",
    "we first multiply the equation ( [ n=5 ] ) by @xmath90 to find @xmath91 and four other equations by permuting the different terms .",
    "again we should eliminate the terms in involving variables @xmath92 . in this case",
    "we can find a holomorphic equation only at the second fz point @xmath93 with the holomorphic variable @xmath94 .",
    "the calculation for @xmath95 and @xmath96 is similar and gives the antiholomorphic parafermions .",
    "the generalization to higher values of @xmath25 is straightforward . by simplifying equation ( [ relation between disorder operators ] ) at the fz points we conjecture that the following variables will be discretely holomorphic : @xmath97 for @xmath98 $ ] .",
    "the same expression with the argument of the exponential having the opposite sign is discretely antiholomorphic for @xmath99\\leq m\\leq n-1 $ ] .",
    "( this is just the complex conjugate of @xmath100 . )",
    "we checked the conjecture for @xmath101 . in this case",
    "we find all of the holomorphic operators at the one fz point @xmath102 .",
    "these discretely holomorphic quantities are the candidates for the holomorphic parafermions of fz parafermionic cft in the continuum limit .",
    "we should emphasise that these operators are holomorphic only at the fz points and not elsewhere on the critical self -dual surfaces .",
    "for example , for @xmath3 , @xmath103 is not holomorphic at the critical point of the four - state potts model .",
    "however @xmath104 , which has conformal spin 1 , is holomorphic all the way along the critical line @xmath105 .",
    "we should also note another curious feature , which is most simply illustrated for the ising case .",
    "although we have shown that the linear relation ( [ holomorphic equation ising ] ) implies the discrete holomorphicity relation ( [ holomorphic equation ] ) for the parafermion @xmath106 , if we define another quantity @xmath107 , then ( [ holomorphic equation ising ] ) also implies that @xmath108 , that is @xmath109 is discretely antiholomorphic .",
    "this is quite general , and holds for other values of @xmath25 and the more general lattices discussed in the next section : if @xmath110 is discretely holomorphic , then @xmath111 is discretely antiholomorphic .",
    "in the previous section we found additional evidence that the zamolodchikov - fateev parafermionic cft is a good candidate for the continuum limit of the fz point of z@xmath0 models on the square lattice , by identifying discretely holomorphic parafermions on the lattice . note this construction was possible only at the fz points .",
    "one may therefore try to invert the argument and locate the fz point by requiring discrete holomorphicity .",
    "since , by universality , the same conformal field theory should describe the continuum limit of suitable z@xmath0 models on other lattices , one would expect to be able to identify discretely holomorphic objects in this case , and thereby deduce the location of the fz points .",
    "in fact we will show that this is possible in many cases , and that the critical weights of the models are just related to the geometry of the covering lattice when it is suitably embedded in the plane .",
    "note that the notion of holomorphicity is not invariant under a general diffeomorphism of the plane , only under conformal transformations .",
    "therefore we expect that the identification of discretely holomorphic objects will depend on choosing a particular embedding of the lattice into the plane , modulo conformal mappings . in what follows we study this problem for the anisotropic square , honeycomb and triangular lattices , and then the more general case of a ` baxter lattice ' .",
    "let first investigate the square lattice with unequal weights @xmath112 , @xmath113 in the @xmath66 and @xmath114 directions respectively . in this case",
    "it is clear that in order to maintain invariance under lattice translations and reflection symmetry about the @xmath66 and @xmath114 axes the only transformations allowed are relative scalings of the @xmath66 and @xmath114 coordinates @xcite . in this case",
    "each elementary square of the covering lattice is deformed into a rhombus ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "embedding of the anisotropic square lattice ( dashed lines ) in the plane .",
    "the faces of the covering lattice form rhombi with opening angles @xmath115 ( shown ) and @xmath116 . , width=226 ]    defining the parafermions by ( [ holomorphic spinors ] ) , we can try to demand that the discrete contour integral around each elementary rhombus vanish as before . as an example we show the case of the ising model in detail .",
    "taking an arbitrary linear combination of ( [ s equation ] ) and its counterpart with @xmath117 we have @xmath118 on the other hand , for the rhombus in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] the contour sum is @xmath119 where @xmath120 , @xmath121 , @xmath122 and @xmath123 . comparing ( [ rhomb1 ] ) and ( [ rhomb2 ] ) we find that they are consistent only at a particular value of @xmath124 and for @xmath125 .",
    "similarly we find the contour sums around the rhombi aligned in the other direction can vanish only if @xmath126 .",
    "note that the comparison of ( [ rhomb1],[rhomb2 ] ) implies 3 complex equations .",
    "if instead of choosing the elementary face of the covering lattice to be a rhombus we take an arbitrary quadrilateral with edges @xmath127 , where @xmath128 , this would introduce 2 further complex unknowns ( ratios of the @xmath127 ) into ( [ rhomb2 ] ) , besides the unknown @xmath124 .",
    "given @xmath129 , the 3 complex equations therefore determine @xmath124 and the shape of the quadrilateral . we have already shown that a rhombus with a suitable opening angle satisfies all the equations",
    ". therefore one would expect that they can not be satisfied for any other quadrilateral with unequal edge lengths .",
    "this can be checked explicitly .    for higher values of @xmath25",
    "we find that the contour sum around the rhombi vanish as long as the weights satisfy @xmath130 the result agrees with that found by fateev and zamolodchikov @xcite by imposing the the star - triangle relations .",
    "next we consider the isotropic honeycomb and triangular lattices , which are mutually dual with the vertices of the honeycomb lattice at the centers of the faces of the triangular lattice and _ vice versa__. the elementary cells of the covering lattice give a regular rhombus tiling of the plane , with @xmath131 for the honeycomb lattice and @xmath132 for the triangular lattice .",
    "the mathematics then proceeds just as for the anisotropic square lattice above , with the result that one can find discretely holomorphic parafermions as long as the weights satisfy ( [ fzpoint anisotropic case ] ) with the appropriate values of @xmath115 .",

    "_ _     embedding of one face of an regular anisotropic triangular lattice ( dashed lines ) in the plane .",

    "consider a ( proper ) embedding of the regular triangular lattice into the plane by some general linear transformation of the coordinates .",
    "this gives a regular tiling of the plane by triangles .",
    "for each triangular face with z@xmath0 spins at the vertices , locate the dual vertex at the _ circumcenter _ , that is the point at which the three perpendicular bisectors of the edges meet , equidistant from the three vertices .",
    "this construction guarantees that adjacent pairs of vertices and dual vertices always form a rhombus .",
    "each triangle is associated with three different rhombi with angles @xmath133 , @xmath134 , and @xmath135 , see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . if now we choose the weights so that @xmath139 it follows from our general analysis that we then can identify discretely holomorphic parafermions . transforming back to the orginal regular triangular lattice with unequal weights",

    "note that it is possible for one of the @xmath140 to be negative , if the largest angle of the deformed triangle is obtuse , corresponding to the interactions in one of the lattice directions being ( weakly ) antiferromagnetic .",

    "it can be seen that in both cases the three rhombuses fit together to form a hexagon with opposite sides parallel , and that they simply correspond to two different tilings of the hexagon by the same three rhombi .",
    "the condition that the contour sum of the parafermions around each rhombus should vanish implies that the couplings should satisfy @xmath157 , which are the critical star - triangle relations .",
    "in this paper we considered the nearest neighbour z@xmath0 model on some fairly general lattices .",
    "we identified the dual disorder operators , and used these to define parafermionic operators which reside on the edges of the covering lattice .",
    "for the isotropic square , triangular and honeycomb lattices we showed that , at the fateev - zamolodchikov critical points , these parafermions obey the discrete version of the cauchy - riemann relations , that is their contour sum around each elementary face of the covering lattice vanishes .",
    "we then extended this idea to regular lattices with anisotropic couplings , and showed that , if they are correctly embedded in the plane , it is possible once again to identify discretely holomorphic parafermions at particular values of the couplings .",
    "these we conjecture to correspond to the fz points on these anisotropic lattice , which agrees with previously known cases .",
    "a crucial feature of these embeddings is that the faces of the covering lattice should be rhombi .",
    "this enabled us to extend our results to more general inhomogeneous lattices of the baxter type , thanks to a theorem @xcite which guarantees the existence of a rhombic embedding in such cases . in this picture , the relation between discrete holomorphicity and the yang - baxter , or star - triangle , relations becomes particularly clear .",
    "we expect that the discretely holomorphic lattice parafermions become the holomorphic parafermions of the conformal field theory , but this requires further assumptions . as pointed out in refs .",
    "@xcite , if we regard the discrete cauchy - riemann equations as a linear system , there are in general twice as many unknowns as equations ( only in the ising case , when the phases of the parafermions are not free , are there the correct number ) . morera s theorem , which allows one to deduce that a function @xmath158 defined on @xmath159 is analytic if its contour integral around every closed contour vanishes , applies only if @xmath158 is also assumed to be continuous .",
    "if we could prove that all correlators of our discrete parafermions become continuous functions in the scaling limit , this would be sufficient to show complex analyticity , at least with sufficiently smooth boundaries .",
    "however this step is highly non - trivial , as evidenced by the ambiguity in the interpretation of the linear relations discussed at the end of sec .",
    "there we showed that they lead to the identification of discrete parafermions @xmath160 and also @xmath161 .",
    "if they corresponded to conformal fields in the scaling limit , they would have conformal spins @xmath162 and @xmath163 . however , if the correlators of @xmath49 become continuous functions in the scaling limit , this can not be true of those of @xmath164 , and vice versa .",
    "if this problem can be overcome , we believe that our identification of suitable discretely holomorphic quantities should be the first step in showing that suitable defined curves in the z@xmath0 have sle as their scaling limit , as has been recently conjectured @xcite . in order to do this , following the ideas of smirnov @xcite ,",
    "however , it is necessary to identify these quantities with observables of these curves which are martingales of some discrete exploration process . since the domain walls ( or , equivalently , high - temperature graphs ) of the z@xmath0 model do not correspond directly to simple lattice curves ( except for @xmath1 )",
