    "the kondo insulators ( ki ) belong to the class of strongly correlated materials forming a group of either nonmagnetic semiconductors ( i.e. fesb@xmath3 ) with the narrowest energy gap ( @xmath10 in the kelvin range ) or of semimetals ( e.g. cenisn , ce@xmath11bi@xmath12pt@xmath11 , smb@xmath13 and ybb@xmath14 ) , both with a heavy - fermion metallic state setting in at elevated temperature @xmath15  @xcite .",
    "the gaps inferred from optical , magnetic , transport and thermodynamics properties are almost an order of magnitude smaller than those obtained by band structure calculations , which is due to the presence of strong electronic correlations  @xcite . as a consequence of a strong @xmath16 hybridization and the formation of a kondo singlet ground state the kondo insulating ground state",

    "very recently the metal@xmath17insulator transition and a surprisingly high magnetic phase transition in the orthorhombic ce based cage type materials cet@xmath3al@xmath1 ( t = os and ru ) have attracted considerable attention both experimentally and theoretically  @xcite .",
    "antiferromagnetic ( afm ) ordering of these ce compounds is found at higher temperatures than in the isostructural gadolinium compound which rules out that the magnetic order is triggered by simple ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yosida ( rkky ) type interactions .",
    "this suggests that a novel mechanism has to be formulated for the afm order exists in cet@xmath3al@xmath1 .",
    "the recently discovered heavy - fermion compound ceru@xmath3al@xmath1 exhibits an unusual magnetic phase transition at 27 k , which is discerned in the temperature dependence of several physical quantities  @xcite .",
    "resistivity , heat capacity , and the thermal conductivity measurements suggest that the phase transition may be accounted for by the formation of a charge - density wave ( cdw ) or spin - density wave ( sdw ) , which opens an energy gap over a portion of the fermi surface  @xcite .",
    "furthermore the spin gap formation in ceru@xmath3al@xmath1 has been confirmed through inelastic neutron scattering ( gap = 8mev )  @xcite , optical study ( gap @xmath18 40 mev )  @xcite and x - ray photoelectron spectroscopy ( gap @xmath18 58 mev )  @xcite . for ceru@xmath3al@xmath1 the magnetic structure reported by khalyavin _ et.al . _ with a propagation vector of * k * = ( 1,0,0 ) involves a collinear antiferromagnetic alignment of the ce moments along the @xmath19 axis of the orthorhombic cmcm space group with a reduced moment of 0.39(3)@xmath6  @xcite .",
    "the moment direction is not governed by the single ion crystal field anisotropy , which would align the moment along the easy @xmath20-axis , having the highest susceptibility  @xcite , but instead by the anisotropic hybridization  @xcite .",
    "this is a very unusual characteristic of the magnetic ordering in ceru@xmath3al@xmath1 , because in local - moment rare earth magnetism the single - ion model is a standard and well - proven approach in the quantitative treatment of crystal electric fields and magnetocrystalline anisotropy prevailing in these materials . in non - cubic kondo insulators , the fascinating ground states emerging from extreme anisotropic hybridization",

    "the origin of the transition most probably is due to a long range magnetic ordering of the ce moments as observed in the undoped ceru@xmath3al@xmath1 compound .",
    "this conclusion is supported by the fact that the additional reflections are only clearly visible at low - momentum transfer , indicating that they follow the squares of the magnetic form factor @xmath70 ( here it is ce@xmath39 form factor ) .",
    "another important feature is the reduction in the background observed at low @xmath71 and concomitant with the appearance of the magnetic peaks below 23 k. once again , this is consistent with the existence of a magnetic transition below which the intensity contained in the paramagnetic scattering is suppressed and transferred to magnetic bragg scattering .",

    "a unique solution associated with the @xmath79 representation was found to provide an excellent refinement quality of the magnetic intensity ( fig . 5 ( middle ) ) .",

    "thus , there are two important differences to be noted compared with parent ceru@xmath3al@xmath1 , ( 1 ) the ordered moments value is almost half in the present sample compare to undoped one and ( 2 ) the direction of the moments is along the @xmath7axis and not along the @xmath8axis as in undoped ceru@xmath3al@xmath1 and also in ceos@xmath23re@xmath22al@xmath1  @xcite see fig .",

    "results of these , we have seen well defined spin gap excitations in both the system having small moment that does not follow cef anisotropy . our preliminary measurements of inelastic neutron scattering on electron doped ( i.e. 10% rh ) in ceru@xmath3al@xmath1 reveals that spin gap value is reduced to 5 mev with considerable reduction in the intensity with broaden linewdith , which make it difficult to detect the spin gap clearly  @xcite .",
    "the study of @xmath2sr on ce(ru@xmath72rh@xmath73)@xmath3al@xmath1 clearly indicates that the internal fields are higher in the rh - doped samples  @xcite , which directly implies larger moment value .",
    "a very similar increase in the moment value , 1@xmath6 , with direction of moment along @xmath75axis has been observed in ce(os@xmath72ir@xmath73)@xmath3al@xmath1 and inelastic study in this case does not reveal any sign of spin gap down to 2 k and also down to 0.6 mev  @xcite .",
    "these observations indicate that when the ordered state moment value is larger that destabilizes the spin gap formation .",
    "this implies that when the ordered moment value is small , and moreover not aligned with the cef easy axis , then the @xmath16 hybridization is active and stabilizes the spin gap , while when moment value is larger ( and follows cef anisotropy ) the spin gap becomes unstable .",
    "our results provide compelling evidence that the ceru@xmath23re@xmath22al@xmath1 exhibits a phase transition at 23 k associated with long - range magnetic ordering of the ce sublattice .",
    "the propagation vector of the ordered state is @xmath5 = ( 1,0,0 ) and does not change with temperature .",
    "the magnetic structure at @xmath32 = 1.5 k involves a collinear antiferromagnetic orientation of the ce moments along the @xmath7axis of the cmcm space group with a magnitude of 0.20(1)@xmath6 .",
    "further inelastic neutron scattering study reveals a clear sign of spin gap type excitation with energy scale of 8 mev in the hole doped system , which is same as that observed in the undoped ceru@xmath3al@xmath1 .",
    "our present hole doping study along with other investigations on the doped systems of cet@xmath3al@xmath1 ( t = ru and os ) indicate that the smaller value of the ordered state moment ( also direction not governed by cef anisotropy ) stabilizes the spin gap formation . on the other hand the larger value ( @xmath181 @xmath6 ) of the ordered state moment ( governed by cef anisotropy ) destabilizes the spin gap ground state .",
    "it has been reported through magnetization study that the ordered state moment is along the @xmath7axis in ce@xmath72la@xmath73ru@xmath3al@xmath1 ( @xmath74 = 0.1 ) at ambient pressure .",
    "this has been attributed to a negative chemical pressure effect  @xcite . however , in the present hole - doped study the volume contracts by 0.1% , concomitant with a positive chemical pressure .",
    "considering these two observations we propose that change in the moment direction in the hole doped ceru@xmath3al@xmath1 is due to electronic effect .",
    "it is expected that our findings in this work will generate new theoretical interest that might help to understand the real mechanism of spin gap formation and higher magnetic ordering temperature of this family of compounds .",

    "<S> we present a detailed investigation of the hole ( 3% re ) doping effect on the polycrystalline ceru@xmath0al@xmath1 sample by magnetization , heat capacity , resistivity , muon spin rotation ( @xmath2sr ) , and neutron scattering ( both elastic and inelastic ) measurements . </S>",
    "<S> ceru@xmath3al@xmath1 is an exceptional cerium compound with an unusually high neel temperature of 27 k. here we study the stability of the unusual magnetic order by means of controlled doping , and we uncover further surprising attributes of this phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> the heat capacity , resistivity and @xmath2sr measurements reveal an onset of magnetic ordering below 23 k , while a broad peak at 31 k ( i.e. above @xmath4 ) , has been observed in the temperature dependent susceptibility , indicating an opening of a spin gap above @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> our important finding , from the neutron diffraction , is that the compound orders antiferromagnetically with a propagation vector @xmath5 = ( 1 0 0 ) and the ordered state moment is 0.20(1)@xmath6 along the @xmath7axis . </S>",
    "<S> this is in sharp contrast to the undoped compound , which shows afm ordering at 27 k with the ordered moment of 0.39(3)@xmath6 along the @xmath8axis . </S>",
    "<S> similar to ceru@xmath3al@xmath1 our inelastic neutron scattering study on the re doped shows a sharp spin gap - type excitation near 8 mev at 5 k , but with slightly reduced intensity compared to the undoped compound . further the excitation broadens and shifts to lower energy ( @xmath9 4 mev ) near 35 k. </S>",
    "<S> these results suggest that the low temperature magnetic properties of the hole doped sample is governed by the competition between the anisotropic hybridization effect and crystal field anisotropy as observed in hole - doped ceos@xmath3al@xmath1 . </S>"
