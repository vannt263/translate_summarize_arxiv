    "experimental measurements of @xmath0 decays , with @xmath1 a light vector meson such as @xmath2 , have continued to improve and will become more precise at the end of the @xmath3-factories and at lhc - b . given their rich ckm phenomenology and potential to constrain new physics models , having reliable theory predictions for these decays",
    "is increasingly relevant . in this talk",
    "i briefly review the status of this area .",
    "the starting point is the effective weak hamiltonian , which for @xmath0 decays is  @xcite : @xmath4 ,   \\label{eq : heff}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 .",
    "the operators with the largest wilson coefficients are the four - quark operators @xmath6 and @xmath7 , which read @xmath8 and the electromagnetic and chromomagnetic penguin operators @xmath9 and @xmath10 , which are @xmath11 \\ , b    f_{\\mu\\nu } \\ , , \\nonumber \\\\    q_8 & = & -\\frac{g \\ , \\overline m_b(\\mu)}{8\\pi^2}\\ , \\bar q \\,\\sigma^{\\mu\\nu } \\ , [ 1 + \\gamma_5 ] \\ , t^a \\ , b    g^a_{\\mu\\nu } .",
    "\\label{eq : penguin - operators } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath12 or  @xmath13 , and the convention for the sign of the couplings corresponds to the covariant derivative @xmath14 , with  @xmath15 and  @xmath16 representing the photon and gluon fields respectively , and @xmath17 etc .",
    "the factor @xmath18 is the @xmath19 mass of the @xmath20 quark .",
    "the main theoretical challenge is to evaluate the hadronic matrix elements of the operators in the effective weak hamiltonian .",
    "common ways of doing this include the qcd factorization @xcite and pqcd @xcite approaches .",
    "both of these rely on the fact that @xmath21 and @xmath22 can be considered as small expansion parameters . in this talk",
    "i will focus exclusively on qcd factorization methods , including in this category also strategies which supply additional information on @xmath23-suppressed contributions from qcd sum rules @xcite , or apply a form of renormalization - group ( rg ) improved perturbation theory based on soft - collinear effective theory ( scet ) @xcite .",
    "the remainder of the talk is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : qcdf ] introduces the qcd factorization formalism , section [ sec : applications ] gives two sample applications , and section [ sec : nnlo ] reviews recent results in higher - order perturbative corrections to the hard - scattering kernels .",
    "this is followed by a short discussion of @xmath23 power corrections and endpoint divergences in section [ sec : isospin ] , using isospin violation in @xmath24 decays as an example , and a summary in section [ sec : summary ] .",
    "qcd factorization is the statement that in the heavy - quark limit the hadronic matrix element of each operator in the effective weak hamiltonian can be written in the form @xmath25 where the @xmath26 stand for convolution integrals .",
    "( sometimes this same formula is written in a different but equivalent form , using the tensor qcd form factor @xmath27 instead of the scet soft function @xmath28 . )",
    "the soft function @xmath28 , the meson decay constants @xmath29 , and the light - cone distribution amplitudes ( lcdas ) @xmath30 are non - perturbative but universal objects . at present , numerical values for these objects are taken from light - cone sum rules .",
    "the hard - scattering kernels @xmath31 can be calculated as a perturbative series in @xmath32 .",
    "the @xmath33 are referred to as `` vertex corrections '' , and the @xmath34 are referred to as `` spectator corrections '' .",
    "only the hard - scattering @xmath35 is non - vanishing at zeroth order in @xmath32 .",
    "corrections from this and the other operators appear at order @xmath32 , and have been known completely for some time @xcite .",
    "i shall refer to these @xmath32 corrections as next - to - leading order ( nlo ) , even though the hard - spectator kernels @xmath34 first start at this order . in section [ sec : nnlo ]",
    "i describe some recent results for the nnlo kernels .    an all orders proof of the qcd factorization formula ( [ eq : ff ] )",
    "was performed in @xcite , using the technology of scet . in the effective - theory approach",
    "the hard - scattering kernels are short distance wilson coefficients of operators whose hadronic matrix elements define the @xmath28 and the lcdas . for the vertex term",
    "this makes little practical difference , but for the hard - spectator term one can show that the hard - scattering kernels @xmath34 can be further factorized into the form @xmath36\\otimes   j_\\perp(\\mu_i)\\,.\\ ] ] the hard coefficients @xmath37 contain physics at the scale @xmath38 , while the jet function @xmath39 is independent of the operator and contains physics at the intermediate scale @xmath40 .",
    "the evolution factor @xmath41 is derived by solving the rg - equations in the effective theory .",
    "because these equations are non - local , the evolution factor appears in a convolution with the wilson coefficient @xmath37 . in the limit where @xmath42 , this evolution matrix resums perturbative logs in the ratio @xmath22 , and allows one to evaluate the hard coefficients and the jet function at their natural scales @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "if one does not wish to do this , then making the choice @xmath45 sets the evolution factor @xmath41 to unity , and one recovers the original qcd factorization formula ( [ eq : ff ] ) .",
    "so for these decays , the `` scet approach '' is just qcd factorization , plus the added opportunity to perform a further scale separation in the hard scattering kernels @xmath46 .",
    "it is necessary to keep in mind that the factorization formula ( [ eq : ff ] ) is valid only up to @xmath47 power corrections .",
    "since scet is an effective theory which sets up a systematic expansion in @xmath32 and @xmath22 , it has the potential to provide a complete classification of the subleading terms in @xmath23 .",
    "however , there has been no serious attempt to do this , because the generalization of the leading - order factorization formula to corrections in @xmath23 presumably contains many more non - perturbative objects .",
    "even more troublesome is the fact that , in the cases where power corrections been calculated , the convolution integrals over momentum fractions do not always converge .",
    "these `` endpoint divergences '' are at present a principle limitation on the entire formalism .    in the absence of a comprehensive theoretical framework to deal with the @xmath23 suppressed corrections , it has become common practice to focus on the contributions which are believed to be large , or which play an especially important role for phenomenology . in this talk",
    "i will discuss the power corrections which are important for the calculation of isospin violation in @xmath24 decays as performed in @xcite .",
    "this is sufficient to describe the problem of endpoint divergences .",
    "other power corrections , due to long - distance photon emission and soft - gluon emission from quark loops , were calculated within the context of light - cone sum rules in @xcite .",
    "the formalism above can be used to calculate many different observables , see for instance @xcite . in this section",
    "i briefly touch on two examples , taking results from the recent studies @xcite for simplicity .",
    "the first is the determination of the ratio of ckm matrix elements @xmath48 from the ratio of branching fractions in @xmath49 and @xmath50 decays .",
    "this is an independent check on the measurements from @xmath51 oscillations @xcite .",
    "the most recent theory results are @xcite @xmath52 which combined with february 2007 hfag data leads to @xmath53 .",
    "this central value is compatible with that from @xmath51 oscillations , although the experimental errors are significantly larger and the theory errors about twice as large .",
    "the dominant theory error is in the form factor ratio @xmath54 , and according to the recent review @xcite this should go down by about a factor of two with improved lattice results for the tensor decay constants .",
    "it should be mentioned that the experimental measurements of the ratio in ( [ eq : r ] ) combine data from @xmath55 and @xmath56 decays under the assumption of exact isospin asymmetry , while the theory calculations can actually predict the magnitude of isospin breaking . improved experimental measurements such as those in @xcite",
    "will make this isospin averaging unnecessary .    as a second application i quote results for the isospin asymmetry in @xmath24 decays .",
    "this asymmetry was calculated in the context of qcd factorization in @xcite and the numbers updated in @xcite , which gives the result @xmath57 the current result by hfag in @xcite is @xmath58 .",
    "results from @xcite showed that this asymmetry is particularly sensitive to the penguin operator @xmath59 .",
    "improved experimental measurements of this asymmetry can thus provide constraints on new physics .",
    "the theory prediction above , however , does not include any @xmath32 corrections to the perturbative hard - scattering kernels , even though some of these were calculated in @xcite .",
    "the reason for this is the presence of endpoint divergences , a topic discussed in more detail in section [ sec : isospin ] .",
    "recently , a set of the nnlo corrections to the vertex and spectator kernels were obtained in @xcite . in this section",
    "i summarize the new results from that work and also what remains to be done to complete the nnlo calculation .",
    "consider first the vertex corrections and the hard - scattering kernel @xmath60 .",
    "this hard - scattering kernel is most easily obtained as a matching coefficient in scet ; details were given in @xcite .",
    "the only technical point i mention here is that the matching coefficients are independent of the external states used in the calculation , and it is possible to use the partonic matrix element @xmath61 in the matching . the scet calculation is trivial for on - shell quarks , because the loop corrections are given by scaleless integrals which vanish in dimensional regularization , so the main challenge is to calculate the partonic matrix elements in full qcd .",
    "however , these are just virtual corrections to the @xmath62 process needed also for inclusive @xmath63 decay , and are currently known very accurately due to the efforts of many people ( see @xcite for a complete list of references ) . using those multi - loop calculations",
    ", @xmath64 can be obtained completely to nnlo .",
    "for the four - quark operators @xmath65 , on the other hand , results to nnlo are known only in the large-@xmath66 limit , obtained by calculating the @xmath67 terms and replacing @xmath68 , where @xmath69 in qcd .",
    "the remaining terms require to calculate a large number of three - loop graphs depending on the ratio @xmath70 and containing imaginary parts . given that this is also a missing piece in the @xmath63 calculation , it is likely that this will be done in the near future .",
    "i now turn to the spectator corrections and the hard scattering kernels @xmath34 . again in this case their calculation is most conveniently formulated as a matching calculation in scet .",
    "in contrast to the vertex corrections , however , the feynman diagrams needed in the matching calculation have no analog in inclusive decay , where interactions with the spectator quarks do not contribute at leading power in @xmath23 .",
    "therefore , results for the @xmath34 can not simply be extracted from existing calculations and must be obtained from scratch .",
    "the one exception is the @xmath71 contribution to @xmath72 , which can be taken from studies of heavy - to - light form factors carried out in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath71 contribution to @xmath73 was calculated in @xcite .",
    "the most important missing pieces are from @xmath65 , but these are also the hardest to calculate , since they involve two - loop graphs depending on @xmath70 in addition to the momentum fraction @xmath74 of the quark in the @xmath1-meson .",
    "a natural place to explore the numerical impact of the nnlo corrections is on branching fractions in @xmath24 decays , since for these decays the annihilation topology is ckm suppressed .",
    "the branching fraction is @xmath75 where the @xmath76 ( @xmath77 ) are the amplitudes for the vertex ( hard spectator ) corrections .",
    "these are separately rg - invariant and so can be studied individually . for the vertex corrections ,",
    "the ratio of the nnlo amplitude to lo amplitude for the default set of parameters in @xcite is @xmath78 \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\left(-0.007 + 0.030 i\\right)\\left[\\alpha_s^2\\right ] , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the first term in parentheses is the nlo ( @xmath79 correction and the second term the nnlo @xmath80 correction .",
    "one sees that the real part of the nnlo correction is extremely small .",
    "it is instructive to further split the above amplitude into the pieces originating from the various operators @xmath81 . in that case",
    "the result reads @xmath82 -.18 \\,[q_7 ]   + ( .02+.02i ) \\ , [ q_8 ] \\bigg)\\,[\\alpha_s ] \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\bigg((.07+.02i)\\ , [ q_1 ] -.08 \\,[q_7 ]   + ( .002+.01i ) \\ , [ q_8 ] \\bigg)\\,[\\alpha_s^2 ] \\nonumber \\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from this one sees that the nnlo contributions are so small because of a large cancellation between the @xmath83 and @xmath9 contributions .",
    "it is an open question whether this cancellation will persist when results for @xmath83 are obtained beyond the large-@xmath66 approximation used above .",
    "this will be discussed in more detail below , where results for branching fractions are given .",
    "for the hard spectator amplitude , one finds @xmath84 + \\big(0.03 + 0.01 i\\big)\\,[\\alpha_s^2 ] .\\ ] ] unlike the case of the vertex corrections , the individual contributions from the different operators are rather small at nlo and especially nnlo .",
    "the exact numbers , including a split into components at the jet and hard scales in ( [ eq : cj ] ) , can be found in @xcite .",
    "putting the amplitudes together , one can find the branching fractions and their uncertainties . including isospin and su(3 ) breaking from meson masses , lifetimes , and @xmath1-meson distribution amplitudes ,",
    "@xcite estimated @xmath85 the magnitude of various sources of uncertainty can be found in @xcite .",
    "most significant is about a 25% uncertainty due to the soft functions @xmath28 , which is expected .",
    "somewhat surprising is that the @xmath71 corrections from @xmath83 can make a large impact , and since they are taken only in the large-@xmath66 limit the true result is still rather uncertain .",
    "for instance , assigning a @xmath86 uncertainty to the @xmath71 piece from @xmath83 in ( [ eq : split ] ) , one finds an uncertainty of about @xmath87 in the branching fractions . also , because the @xmath88 terms do not fix the perturbative definition of the charm - quark mass in the @xmath32 contribution in ( [ eq : split ] ) , one can formally use values ranging from a low @xmath19 mass to a high pole mass , which can make a large numerical difference , about @xmath89 in the range used in @xcite . the message to be gained from this",
    "is that the full nnlo corrections from the set @xmath65 also need to be calculated , in order to get the reduced perturbative uncertainty expected from a higher - order calculation .",
    "decays.,width=302 ]    calculations of interesting observables such as isospin violation in @xmath50 decays require to include @xmath23 suppressed contributions to the factorization formula .",
    "particularly important corrections come from topologies such as those in figure [ fig : ann ] , which i have taken from @xcite .",
    "the square vertex indicates an insertion of @xmath90 for the graph on the left , an insertion of @xmath91 for the graph in the center , and an insertion of @xmath65 for the graph on the right .",
    "the crosses denote alternate attachments of the photon line .",
    "note that the center and right graphs are @xmath32 corrections compared to the graphs on the left .",
    "the contributions from the graphs in the figure , as well as some @xmath32 terms linked to the graph on the left by rg - invariance , were calculated in @xcite .",
    "to finish the calculation to this order would require to calculate the @xmath32 corrections to the graphs on the left .",
    "this calculation is in progress @xcite .",
    "however , once completed , the calculation will still face the problem that a straightforward application of the qcd factorization formalism leads to endpoint divergences in the convolution integrals .",
    "for example , the center graph in figure [ fig : ann ] was shown in @xcite to contain the integral @xmath92 which is equal to infinity under the conventional assumption that the lcda vanishes as @xmath93 in the endpoint .",
    "the quantity @xmath94 is multiplied by the wilson coefficient @xmath95 and was estimated by introducing an ir cutoff in @xcite and found to be small , but clearly this is a conceptual problem .",
    "moreover , there is no guarantee that similar endpoint divergences will not appear for the other operators in the weak hamiltonian , once the full set of one - loop corrections to the graphs on the left in figure [ fig : ann ] are included .",
    "therefore , it is fair to say that a better understanding of power corrections is needed , in order to achieve a consistent framework for the calculation of quantities such as isospin violation .",
    "rare radiative @xmath0 decays are of increasing interest as experimental measurements become more precise .",
    "qcd factorization and scet have provided a theoretical framework which can be used to calculate observables for these decays to leading order in @xmath23 .",
    "the perturbative hard - scattering kernels have been known at nlo in @xmath32 for some time , and recently a set of nnlo results have been obtained for the operators @xmath83 , @xmath9 , and @xmath91 , although results for the four - quark operators @xmath83 and @xmath96 are not yet complete .",
    "the interesting observables such as isospin asymmetries and branching fractions in the @xmath97 modes are sensitive to power corrections in @xmath23 .",
    "some of these have been estimated in the framework of light - cone sum rules , but a systematic treatment in scet or qcd factorization is still missing due to the presence of endpoint divergences ; a solution to this problem would be a much desired advance in this field .",
