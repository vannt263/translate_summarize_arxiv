    ", one should keep in mind that the vast majority of the laboratory data available to address each of these bands has been measured in absorption , not emission . in the astrophysical case , where pah spectra are measured in emission instead of absorption",

    "the interstellar spectrum arises from the combined emission of a complex mixture of vibrationally excited pahs . in emission",
    ", each individual line should have an approximately 30 @xmath2 fwhm , consistent with the natural linewidth expected from each emitting molecule @xcite .",
    "this natural linewidth arises from intramolecular vibrational energy redistribution , not the blending of individual rotational lines in the emitting molecules which remain rotationally cool throughout the excitation / emission process ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "due to the high internal energy content of the emitting molecules , a 10 to as much as 40 @xmath2 peak position redshift is intrinsic to the emission process depending on the internal excitation and the emitting feature wavelength @xcite .      as with all fundamental vibrational frequencies , the precise position of the 3.3 band depends on many factors including charge state , molecular size , structure , molecular heterogeneity , and so on .",

    "large variations are found in profiles of the features in the 69 region while smaller ones are found in those of the 3.3 and 11.2 features .",
    "furthermore , the 3.3 feature is very invariant under highly variant physical conditions .",
    "the different profile classes are linked with each other and with object type ; this correlation , however , is more apparent in the 69 region than in the 3.3 and 11.2 regions .",
    "@xcite recognized two types of 3.3 @xmath0 m features based on spectra taken with a @xmath25 aperture .",
    "the profile , peak position and width of their type 1 agree well with class @xmath11 defined here .",
    "their type 2 has a similar peak wavelength compared to our classes @xmath14 , but is much narrower , with a fwhm of @xmath10.020 @xmath0 m .",
    "most sources of their sample belong to type 1 while type 2 is associated with only 3 sources ( hd  44179 , elias  1 , wl  16 ) .",
    "the 3.3 pah band in the iso - sws spectra ( obtained through an aperture of @xmath26x@xmath27 ) of their type 1 sources belongs to class @xmath11 while those of hd  44179 and elias  1 belongs to class @xmath14 ( see table  [ chvscc_tab : sample ] and @xcite for elias  1 ) . @xcite and @xcite showed , in a detailed spatial study of hd  44179 , that the 3.3 @xmath0 m profile varies , going from type 2 to type 1 with distance from the central star . hence , the observed profile will depend on the sampled area on the sky . in particular , the 3.3 @xmath0 m profile of hd  44179 in our sample",
    "is observed through an aperture @xmath26x@xmath27 and thus has an averaged profile of both type 1 and 2 profiles , thereby explaining its large fwhm compared to the profile found by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in addition , the type 1 / class a@xmath24 profile is not unique to certain object types . whether the type 2 profile only occurs in specific sources is currently unknown .",
    "however , few sources are found that show a type 2 or class b@xmath24 profile .",
    "all except one are post - agb stars ( 3 ) , isolated haebe stars ( 3 ) and an emission line star ( @xcite classifies mwc  922 as disk - like based upon the spectral energy distribution and its mm continuum flux ) . apparently , a circumstellar environment where dust formation is on - going or a protostellar / protoplanetary environment is an essential but not sufficient condition to have type 2 or class b@xmath24 profiles .",
    "indeed , some post - agb stars or haebe stars show a type 1 / class a@xmath24 profile .",
    "the fact that the 3.3  @xmath0 m feature varies considerably less than the other main features and mostly exhibits the a@xmath24 / type 1 profile indicates that the conditions that give rise to the b@xmath24 and/or type 2 profiles are more easily lost than those that give rise to the b ( and c ) types for the other bands .",
    "* in prep . ) and @xcite also reported a varying 8.6 and 11.2 profile in hd44179 , with a peak position going to shorter wavelengths with distance from the star and hence going from class b to class a. note that also the 3.3 feature also shifts bluewards with distance from the star indicating that these three pah feature are correlated in this source . similar as for the 3.3 feature , the observed profile will depend on the sampled area on the sky .",
    "in addition , class a profile is not unique to certain object types .",
    "@xcite noted that the central stars of the few sources showing a type 2 profile , all had relatively low effective temperatures ( @xmath28 k ) , suggesting a correlation between stellar effective temperature and pah feature profiles .",
    "however , both profile types are found within hd  44179 @xcite . at the same time , some objects in our sample have a relatively low stellar temperature , e.g. iras 03260 + 3111 ( jaschek et al .",
    "1964 ) , but still show an a@xmath24 class profile .",
    "this demonstrates that the effective temperature can not be the sole cause of the variations in the 3.3  @xmath0 m feature profile .",
    "van kerckhoven ( 2002 ) and phv02 have reached similar conclusions for the longer wavelength features .",
    "since variations are seen within objects , it may be that the local radiation field , @xmath29 , influences the profiles of the feature .",
    "however , no link between @xmath29 and the different classes of the 3.3 and 11.2 features is found . indeed , for both features individually , the range in @xmath30 of the sample sources classified as class @xmath19 straddles that of class @xmath18 and class @xmath17 sources .",
    "analogously , phv02 found no relation between @xmath29 and profiles of the 69 pah emission features .",
    "hence , we can conclude that g@xmath31 alone can not be the factor determining the observed variation in the main pah emission features from source to source ( observed through a large aperture ) .      in the framework of the pah hypothesis",
    ", the profiles and thus also the variations in the profiles reflect the present molecular ensemble and the excitation conditions . in the following ,",
    "we examine if we can isolate any effect which is clearly reflected in the observed variations of the profiles .",
    "the profiles are very characteristic for anharmonic broadening in highly vibrationally excited molecules @xcite . due to cross - coupling between different modes ,",
    "the peak position of an ir band will shift towards lower frequencies .",
    "integration over the energy cascade , leads then to a red shaded profile .",
    "the red wing can be further enhanced due to emission from vibrationally excited levels ( e.g. vibrational hot bands , @xmath32 ) which are generally shifted towards the red due to the anharmonicity of the vibrational potential of the mode .",
    "these anharmonicities can be quite different for different modes .",
    "anharmonicity parameters for a few small pahs have been estimated from laboratory studies on the temperature dependence of the peak wavelength and width of the absorption bands @xcite and from the difference between low temperature absorption measurements and infrared multi - photon dissociation studies of trapped pah ions @xcite .",
    "the effects of anharmonicity have been studied theoretically @xcite .",
    "these studies show that the general characteristics of the interstellar 3.3 , 6.2 and 11.2  @xmath0 m bands are well understood in the framework of highly excited pahs .",
    "however , these models can not explain the large shift observed in the 6.2 @xmath0 m band between classes @xmath19 , @xmath18 , and @xmath33 .",
    "such a shift can only reflect a chemical / structural modification of the emitting pahs , for example due to the incorporation of n ( phv02 ; hudgins , bauschlicher , & allamandola , in prep . ) .",
    "the calculated 3.3 profiles of @xcite show that an increase in excitation  either through a decreased size or an increase in internal energy ",
    "shifts the peak position towards the red and simultaneously increases the fhwm ( note that the calculated 3.3 profile has a larger asymmetry factor than observed in space ) .",
    "our class @xmath14 profiles and the type 2 profiles peak at longer wavelengths but have smaller fwhm compared to class @xmath11 / type 1 profiles . thus , the variation in profiles between classes @xmath11 / type 1 and either @xmath14 or type 2 can not be due to anharmonicity .",
    "perusing the @xcite 11.2 model profiles , we notice that an increase in excitation  either through a decreased size or an increase in internal energy  does increase the strength of the red wing but can not shift the peak position or change the blue rise . in their study of the 11.2  @xmath0 m band , @xcite focused on iras 21282 + 5050 , a class a(b)@xmath34 source and indeed the a(b)@xmath34 profile can be interpreted as originating from the same pah population that gives rise to the a@xmath34 profile excited to higher internal energy . in contrast , the difference between a@xmath34 and b@xmath34 , with the band as a whole displaced , are not readily explained within the anharmonicity model .      the 3.3 and 11.2 ch bands are likely due to the presence of a family of pah molecules and hence , the variation in peak position and profile of the ch modes likely represents a small but significant difference in the population of emitting species .",
    "the variation in the peak position of the 3.3 and 11.2 @xmath0 m band , measured in the laboratory or quantum - chemically calculated , is much larger ( 0.02 @xmath0 m ; 20 @xmath2 and 0.3 @xmath0 m ; 20 @xmath2 respectively ) than observed in space ( @xmath1 0.007 ; 6 @xmath2 and @xmath1 0.05 @xmath0 m ; 4 @xmath2 respectively ) .",
    "although the convolution of the size distribution with the excitation conditions can lead to a different dispersion for the peak positions ( compared to absorption bands measured in the lab ) , it is likely that only a _ small subset _ of the pahs studied by these means contribute to the observed emission from space .",
    "[ [ the-3.3-feature ] ] the 3.3 feature : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    if we assume that the variation in the fwhm of the 3.3 feature between class a@xmath24 / type 1 and either b@xmath24 or type 2 is mainly influenced by the molecular edge structure , this observed variation in fwhm ( and hence in class ) implies that the pah family present in class b@xmath24 and type 2 sources are dominated by more compact pah molecules compared to the pah family present in class a@xmath24 / type 1 sources ( sect .  [ chvscc_spectroscopy_ch ] and table  [ chvscc_tab : classprop ] ) .",
    "since the molecular structure of the pah molecules can be deduced based on the relative strengths of the ch out - of - plane bending modes ( hvp01 ) and assuming that the pahs responsible for the 3.3 band have similar molecular structure as those for the 11.2 band ( although these features arise from the emission of a different subset of pahs ) , we can test the dependence of the fwhm of the 3.3 feature on molecular structure .",
    "let s consider the following sources : hd  44179 belonging to @xmath14 and @xmath16 ; ngc  7027 , member of @xmath11 and @xmath16 and the iras  18317 representing classes @xmath11 and @xmath15 .",
    "hvp01 found that ngc  7027 is dominated by large , compact pahs with straight edges and iras  18317 by smaller or irregular pahs .",
    "although these two sources represent the extremes in the observed intensity ratio in their sample and hence the extremes in molecular structure , they both belong to @xmath11 .",
    "in addition , the relative strengths of the ch out - of - plane bending modes of hd  44179 are comparable to ngc  7027 and hence their molecular structure is similar ( hvp01 ) . however",
    ", their 3.3 features belong to different classes .",
    "therefore , we can conclude that the molecular edge structure is likely not the main cause of the variation in the fwhm of the 3.3 feature .",
    "[ [ the-11.2-feature ] ] the 11.2 feature : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the little variance of the ch out - of - plane bending modes may be an inherent property of interstellar pahs . within the subset of pahs studied in the laboratory or quantum chemically , the peak position of the solo modes in neutral and cation pahs falls very closely to the observed interstellar peak position of 11.2 @xmath0 m , with the neutral pahs dominating the emission ( see fig . 8 in hvp01 ) .",
    "now , possibly , any molecular structure variations , which lead to shifts in the 69 @xmath0 m cc bands , may be inherently accompanied by modification of the ch peripheral structure which turn ch solo s into duo s or trio s .",
    "duet ch s of compact pah cations may contribute to the red wing of the 11.2 band ( sect .",
    "[ chvscc_spectroscopy_ch ] * ? ? ? * hvp01 ) .",
    "hence , it is possible that the observed variation in the 11.2 band reflects variation in the contribution of these cationic duet modes .",
    "this would imply that @xmath16 and @xmath17 objects have more compact pah cations with duets .",
    "analysis of the pattern of emission features in the ch out - of - plane bending modes region ( i.e. 1015 , hvp01 ) reveals that evolved stars are dominated by large compact structures while regions are dominated by irregular structures and hence is consistent with this conclusion .",
    "+      based upon laboratory studies , shifts in the peak positions of the interstellar ir emission features have been attirbuted to @xmath35c isotope substitution @xcite .",
    "we note that , while this might be important in some extreme circumstellar environments ( such as the red rectangle ) , this can not be a general explanation for the observed shifts .",
    "first , not all the features shift in the same way at all times .",
    "second , we see pronounced variations in material which is interstellar in origin and where isotope subsitution should be minimal . the observed variations within a single region or reflection nebula present , of course , a case in point ( joblin et al . in prep .",
    "to summarise , the variation in peak position is likely due to the presence of a mixture of pah molecules whose composition changes .",
    "both anharmonicity and molecular structure can explain variation in the fwhm of the 11.2 feature .",
    "in contrast , the variation in the fwhm of the 3.3 feature between class a@xmath24 / type 1 and type 2 remains an enigma although it might be the result of a change in composition of the pah family .",
    "the larger fwhm of our class b@xmath24 likely originates from the average ( through a large aperture ) of type 2 and type 1 / class a@xmath24 profiles with a dominating type 2 contribution .",
    "perusing the spectra , it is striking that the variations in the 69 @xmath0 m region are much more pronounced than those of the 3.3 or 11.2 @xmath0 m features ( cf . ,",
    "fig  [ chvscc_fig : var ] ; table [ chvscc_tab : classprop ] ) .",
    "this implies that variations in the features assigned to cc modes are significantly larger than those assigned to ch modes .",
    "here we discuss what could be the root of this dichotomy .      experimentally and",
    "quantum chemically , it is well established that the 69 @xmath0 m cc modes are dominated by cations while the 3.3 @xmath0 m ch stretching mode can be due to neutrals and anions ( fig.[lab33 ] sect.[chvscc_spectroscopy_ch ] , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* mattioda et  al . , in preparation ) .",
    "there is some observational support that this dichotomy between the cc and ch stretching modes , also extends to the 11.2 @xmath0 m ch out - of - plane bending mode ( hvp01 ) .",
    "specifically , the strength of the astronomical 11.2 @xmath0 m mode correlates well with the 3.3 @xmath0 m ch stretching band and not with the 6.2 @xmath0 m cc stretching band .",
    "the difference in spectral variations between ch and cc modes may merely reflect that they probe different parts of the interstellar pah population .",
    "for example , the chemical modification process might be mainly operative on cations and not on neutrals . in that respect , because ionisation and neutralisation of interstellar pahs occurs on a very rapid timescale , this would imply a similar fast chemical exchange .",
    "such a fast process would also allow for spatial variations within a source .",
    "it should be noted that it is unlikely that this rapid behaviour is connected with the incorporation on n in pah rings .",
    "however , functionalized pahs , pah clusters or pah - metal complexes may be formed and broken on a similar timescale @xcite .",
    "substitution of nitrogen in the ring can explain variation in the 6.2 @xmath0 m band position .",
    "however , it does not influence the peak position of the ch modes nor does it influence the peak positions of the 7.7 complex in a systematic way . however , as mentioned above , it is unlikely that n - incorporation deep within a pah can occur on such a rapid timescale as to explain the spatial variations within a source .",
    "complexes of pahs with each other or with metal atoms might also cause the spectral variation in the 69 range .",
    "however , the influence of complexation on the ch modes still has to be investigated in the laboratory .",
    "the very small variation of the 3.3 feature with respect to the cc modes and to the ch out - of - plane bending modes , is likely also related to distinct _",
    "subsets _ of emitting pah molecules . indeed , the 3.3 feature originates from the smallest members of the emitting pah population while the pah features in the 612 region originates from somewhat larger pahs in the population @xcite .",
    "this would indicate that photo - chemistry is not the driving force behind the observed spectral variation since smaller pahs will be much more susceptible to unimolecular dissociation following photon absorption and hence larger variations would be expected for the 3.3 feature than for higher wavelength features , in contradiction to what is observed .",
    "in addition , this might suggest that while the larger pahs are modified , the smaller ones are destroyed .",
    "this would leave only the most stable small pahs to emit the 3.3 feature , while a mixture of modified larger pahs survive to give rise to the higher wavelength features .",
    "as already mentioned , any molecular structure variations , which lead to shifts in the 69 @xmath0 m cc bands , may be inherently accompanied by modification of the ch peripheral structure which turn ch solo s into duo s or trio s .    to summarise , several parameters can cause the difference in the amount of variation between the ch and cc modes .",
    "however , further laboratory studies are required to determine which of these parameters(s ) controls the spectral characteristics of pahs in space . based on the rough correlation of most of the band profiles one can stipulate that the appearance of the uir emission features is determined by a few physical parameters alone",
    "however , there are several sources which do not follow these correlations .",
    "this implies that the behavior can not be understood in terms of a single parameter .",
    "based on iso - sws observations , we have studied the profiles of the 3.3 and 11.2 pah features of a wide variety of sources and found that clear variations are present . both features shift in peak position and show different profiles from source to source . comparing the 3.3 , 69 and 11.2 @xmath0 m classifications , we recognise a correlation between them . in general , an @xmath19 classification in 69 @xmath0",
    "m region also implies an @xmath11 and @xmath15 .",
    "however , this seems not true for the @xmath18 and @xmath33 classifications ; @xmath14 and @xmath16 do not necessarily correlate with each other or with @xmath6 or @xmath8 .",
    "in addition , these variations depend on the type of object considered . apparently , a circumstellar environment where dust formation is on - going or a protostellar / protoplanetary environment is an essential but not sufficient condition to have peculiar 3.3 or 11.2 profiles .",
    "noteworthy is the fact that the three galaxies in our sample show the same profile as the hii regions , except for the 11.2 profile which ressembles that of some evolved stars .",
    "spatial variations of the profiles within a source indicate that specific profiles are not unique to certain object types and that the observed profile depends on the aperture .",
    "nevertheless , the average ( or predominant ) profile ( as observed with iso - sws which has an aperture of @xmath26x@xmath27 ) present within a source does depend on object type .",
    "however , the most striking aspect of the features in the 312 regions is the pronounced contrast in the profile variations between the ch modes and the cc modes .",
    "specifically , the peak position in wavenumber space varies by about 20 , 80 and 15 @xmath2 for the 6.2 , 7.7 and 8.6 @xmath0 m features , respectively , and only by about 6.5 and 4.0 @xmath2 for the features at 3.3 and 11.2 @xmath0 m , respectively .    we summarise existing laboratory data and theoretical calculations of the modes emitting in the 312 region of pah molecules .",
    "in contrast to the 69 region which arise from pah cations , the 3.3 band appears to originate mainly in neutral and/or negatively charged pahs .",
    "we attribute the variations in peak position of the 3.3 and 11.2 feature to the presence of a mixture of pah molecules , whose composition changes .",
    "the variations in fwhm of the 3.3 feature remains an enigma  although might result from the change in composition of the pah family  while those of the 11.2 can be explained by anharmonicity and molecular structure .",
    "the possible origin of the observed contrast in profile variations between the ch modes and the cc modes is highlighted .",
    "the overall good agreement that can be achieved between the is spectra and the spectral characeristics of free pahs strongly supports the pah model and allows these spectra to become a probe of local conditions .",
    "however , it is clear that some features of the major band profiles and the minor bands can not be accounted for by `` classical '' pahs . other pah related species such as pah clusters , heteroatom pahs and pah - metal complexes",
