    "it is well known that in type ii superconductors the abrikosov vortex state can be formed under a magnetic field . in most cases",
    "the destruction of superconductivity happens due to the orbital effect .",
    "however there can be a situation when paramagnetic effect plays an important role in destruction of superconductivity ( magnetic field acting only on electron spins ) . in this case the non - uniform fulde - ferrell - larkin - ovchinnikov ( fflo ) state @xcite appears in superconductors , which is characterized by the modulation of the order parameter .",
    "the structure of the fflo phase in the real compounds may be very rich @xcite .",
    "interplay of orbital and paramagnetic effects has been described in the isotropic model by gruenberg and gunther in @xcite , where they calculated critical field and structure of the order parameter .",
    "it was found in gruenberggunther that the orbital effect is detrimental to the fflo state , but still such a state can exist if the ratio of pure orbital effect @xmath0 and pure paramagnetic limit @xmath1 is larger than 1.28 , i.e. the maki parameter @xmath2 must be larger 1.8",
    ". pure paramagnetic limit at @xmath3 can be estimated as @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is bcs gap at @xmath6 and @xmath7 is the bohr magneton . in @xcite",
    "the modulation was studied using a zero landau level function , which holds true only for moderate maki parameter @xmath8 .",
    "it was found in buzdinbrison that for large values of maki parameter @xmath9 the higher landau level solutions become relevant . in this case the critical field @xmath10 consists of several curves each corresponding to a different landau level solution .",
    "the analysis of the orbital effect in the fflo state @xcite were performed for the isotropic metals with @xmath11-wave type of pairing .",
    "however in @xcite it was demonstrated that it readily generalized for the case of the metals with elliptic fermi surface .",
    "in such a case the maki parameter becomes angular dependent .",
    "for example for the case of the quasi-2d or anisotropic 3d superconductors @xmath12 increases dramatically for the in - plane field orientation .",
    "therefore we may expect the transitions between the usual fflo state with zero landau levels @xcite to the state with higher landau levels @xcite when the magnetic field is tilted from the perpendicular orientation to the parallel one .",
    "also crossover from the pure fflo state to the vortex states with higher landau levels indexes in the model of quasi-2d system has been predicted in @xcite . in real compounds",
    "the deviation of the fermi surface from the elliptic form is crucial for the adequate description of the fflo state as well as the type of the superconductivity pairing ( e.g. @xmath11- or @xmath13-wave ) @xcite .",
    "this circumstance is related with a fact that the description of the fflo state in the framework of ginzburg - landau approach needs the consideration of the higher - order derivatives of the order parameter in addition to the usual gradient terms .",
    "for example , in the case of pure paramagnetic effect the critical field and modulation vector @xmath14 strongly depend on anisotropy or nesting properties of the fermi surface @xcite . in this article",
    "we consider a realistic case with a non - elliptic fermi surface and for the definiteness we restrict ourself to the tetragonal symmetry .",
    "for example quasi - two - dimensional superconductor cecoin@xmath15matsudashimahara07 provides favorable conditions for the formation of the fflo state and it has a tetragonal symmetry .    a characteristic feature of the fflo state is the existence of a tricritical point ( tcp ) in the field - temperature phase diagram saintjamessarma .",
    "tcp is the meeting point of three transition lines separating the normal metal , the uniform superconductivity and the fflo state .",
    "formation of the fflo state near the tcp may be described by modified ginzburg - landau functional ( mgl ) @xcite .",
    "appearance of the non - uniform state is related with a change of the sign of the coefficient @xmath16 at the gradient term @xmath17 in the free energy density . in the standard ginzburg - landau theory",
    "the coefficient @xmath16 is positive .",
    "here it vanishes at the tcp ( @xmath18 ) , and then becomes negative for @xmath19 .",
    "the absolute value of @xmath16 grows as we move further from the tcp , for example with increasing of the magnetic field or lowering temperature .",
    "a negative @xmath16 means that the modulated state has a lower free energy than the uniform one . in order to obtain",
    "the modulation vector one needs to include the term with higher order derivatives in the mgl functional @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study the effects of crystal ( or pairing ) anisotropy on the fflo phase . using mgl approach",
    "we introduce free energy density @xmath20 describing tetragonal system .",
    "we examine the case of the fermi surface close to elliptic one .",
    "therefore @xmath20 can be divided into isotropic and perturbative parts .",
    "we demonstrate that the higher landau level solutions may be realized for arbitrary values of maki parameter in contrast with isotropic model .",
    "this is a special mechanism of the higher landau level phase formation in 3d system .",
    "moreover depending on various type of deviation of the fermi surface from isotropic form three possible solutions for the fflo state can be realized : ( a ) maximum modulation occurs along the magnetic field with zero landau level state , ( b ) both modulation and higher landau level state , ( c ) highest possible landau level and no modulation along the field ( or modulation with very small wave - vector ) .",
    "moreover due to the specific form of the fermi surface the variation of magnetic field orientation may provoke transitions between the states with different landau levels .",
    "the main goal of the present paper is to demonstrate that in the presence of the orbital effect and for the realistic fermi surface the very different types of the fflo state could be realized . in particular ,",
    "if the preferred modulation direction is perpendicular to the magnetic field this can results in the formation of the higher landau levels mixed state with no modulation along the field at all .",
    "our approach is fully justified near the tcp  and for superconductors with large maki parameters .",
    "however qualitatively it provides the understanding of the fflo  state at all temperatures and for arbitrary strength of the orbital effect .",
    "here we calculate the line of the second order transition from the normal to the superconducting state . for this purpose",
    "we use the quadratic over the superconducting order parameter mgl functional . to describe the properties of the fflo state it is needed to retain the higher order terms over the superconducting order parameter",
    "the situation is completely analogous with that of the abrikosov vortex lattice . from the symmetry reasons it is clear that the transitions between the mixed states describing by the different landau levels will be the first order transitions .",
    "however the appearance of the modulation along the magnetic field may occur through a continuous transition .",
    "all these interesting questions deserve further studies but they are well beyond the scope of the present article .",
    "the most general form of the mgl functional quadratic over @xmath21 is@xmath22where @xmath23 @xmath24 is transition temperature into the uniform superconducting state , @xmath25 are momentum operators and @xmath26 are the components of the vector potential , further we put @xmath27 . assuming the tetragonal symmetry in the case of the pure elliptic fermi surface we have following relation for the effective  mass @xmath28 .",
    "the elliptical fermi surface could be transformed into isotropic one by the following scaling transformation @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "components of the magnetic field also transform as @xmath30 .",
    "further we suppose that actual fermi surface deviation from the elliptical form is small and after corresponding scaling transformation the functional ( [ eq : fgeneral ] ) for the tetragonal symmetry is written as    @xmath31    coefficients @xmath32 depend on structure of the fermi surface , but for the fflo  appearance @xmath16 must be positive .",
    "the terms @xmath33 describe the elliptic form of the fermi surface ( for @xmath11-wave superconductivity ) and terms with coefficients @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are considered as perturbation .    without orbital effect",
    "the momentum operators are simplified to @xmath37 and the solution for the order parameter could be presented as @xmath38 . in the case of elliptic fermi surface",
    "we have a degeneracy over direction of the fflo modulation @xmath14 .",
    "the crystal structure effects are expressed via the terms with @xmath34 , @xmath39,@xmath40 and they lift this degeneracy and determine the direction of the fflo modulation .",
    "the free energy density is written as@xmath41where we have used spherical system for @xmath42 : @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 . due to the tetragonal symmetry",
    "the modulation in @xmath46-plane is either parallel to @xmath47 or @xmath48 axis ( @xmath49 ) or along the bisector ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "for definiteness we may suppose that @xmath51 .",
    "note that in the case @xmath50 the rotation of the @xmath46 axis by @xmath52 provides us the same functional ( [ eq : fnoorb ] ) with renormalized coefficients @xmath53 and @xmath54 but with @xmath49 .",

    "the higher landau level solutions has been predicted for the fflo  phase in 2d superconductors in tilted magnetic field @xcite , in 3d @xmath13-wave and quasi-2d @xmath11- and @xmath13-wave superconductors @xcite , and in 3d isotropic superconductors at low temperature provided the maki parameter is large @xcite .",
    "here we have demonstrated that for certain field orientations such states naturally appear in real 3d compounds in a whole region of the fflo phase existence ( without any restriction to the value of maki parameter ) .",
    "this behavior is related with crystal structure and/or pairing symmetry effects .",
    "the isotropic models used so far to describe fflo state fail to predict these different types of the scenarios of the fflo transitions . indeed following the isotropic ( or quasi - isotropic ) model",
    "the transition to the fflo state with the increase of the magnetic field always occurs via the modulation appearance along the field direction . on the contrary in the present paper",
    "we predict the fflo transition as a formation of the higher landau level states .",
    "the vortex state that corresponds to these higher landau level solutions have a rather complicated structure due to the competition between two length scales , the average distance between vortices and the fflo period @xcite .",
    "recently in @xcite the very special vortex phases with spatial line nodes forming a variety of 3d spatial configurations has been predicted .",
    "therefore we may expect that the mixed state in the fflo superconductor may be very different from the usual abrikosov lattice , provided that the higher landau level solutions are realized .",
    "the experimentally verified consequences of these scenario of the fflo transition are the first order transitions between the states with different landau level solutions ( namely between @xmath100 and @xmath211 ) , accompanying by the strong change of the vortex lattice structure .",
    "the standard experimental techniques of the vortex lattice observation ( including the neutron scattering ) could be used to detect these transformations .",
    "it is commonly believed that the fflo state in cecoin@xmath15corresponds to the state with the modulation along the magnetic field for both field orientations : along the tetragonal axis and in the basal plane . however , comparing the ( @xmath180 ) diagrams ( figs .",
    "[ fig : z ] and [ fig : hx ] ) we see that the situation when we have a zero landau level solution for this two field orientations is improbable . in cecoin@xmath15the crystal structure effects",
    "are rather important  for example in @xcite the vortex lattice reorientation transitionhave been reported as well as in - plane anisotropy of the upper critical field @xcite . in such a case",
    "we can expect that for one of these field orientations the landau level solution with @xmath212 may be realized .",
    "note that such a possibility in connection with the fflo state in cecoin@xmath213has been discussed in @xcite . if the crystal structure effects are large enough for the landau level solutions with @xmath212 the modulation along the field may be absent .",
    "very recently @xcite the modulated antiferromagnetic ordering has been reported in the low temperature superconducting phase of cecoin@xmath15at the magnetic field in the basal plane .",
    "the antiferromagnetic ordering plays for the fflo state the role of the crystal structure effect favoring the orientation of the fflo modulation wavevector along the antiferromagnetic one brison95 .",
    "the texture in the superconducting order parameter revealed by nmr  experiments looks different for different field orientations matsudashimahara07 as well as the anomaly in the local magnetic inductor measurements @xcite .",
    "this may indicate on the different types of the fflo state for different field orientations .",
    "presumably for the field orientation in the basal plane there are no fflo modulation along the field .",
