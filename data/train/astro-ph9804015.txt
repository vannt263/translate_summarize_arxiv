    "rich clusters can be used to constrain cosmological models of large - scale structure formation .",
    "rich clusters are the largest virialized objects in the universe and , hence , their abundance and evolution can be simply related to the linear mass power spectrum , @xmath9 .",
    "their x - ray temperature can be used to infer the cluster mass .",
    "then , press - schechter ( 1974 ) theory can be used to relate the observed cluster abundance as a function of mass to the @xmath2 fluctuation on 8  @xmath3  mpc scales , @xmath1 .",
    "the result is a constraint on a combination of parameters , @xmath10 , where @xmath5 is a function of model parameters .    in this paper",
    ", we obtain a general expression for @xmath5 which applies to a wide range of models including the standard cold dark matter ( scdm ) model , models with a mixture of cosmological constant ( @xmath11 ) and cold dark matter ( @xmath11cdm ) , and qcdm models with a mixture of cold dark matter and quintessence , a dynamical , time - evolving , spatially inhomogeneous component with negative pressure .",
    "an example of quintessence would be a scalar field ( @xmath12 ) rolling down a potential @xmath13 .",
    "it has been shown that a spectrum of @xmath11cdm and qcdm models satisfy all current observational constraints ( wang et al .",
    "our expression for @xmath5 includes dependence on the spectral index @xmath6 , the hubble constant @xmath7 ( in units of 100 km sec@xmath14 mpc@xmath14 ) , and the equation - of - state of the quintessence component @xmath8 .    in section 2",
    ", we discuss our derivation of the cluster abundance constraint , which follows earlier derivations to some degree but includes some new features when applied to quintessence . some may wish to proceed directly to the resulting constraint , given in section 3 .",
    "our result appears to differ slightly from some earlier works , but we explain in this section the reasons for those differences . our purpose in determining @xmath5 is to transform observations into a powerful constraint on models . in section 4 , we discuss the further constraint derived from studying the evolution of cluster abundance from redshift @xmath15 to @xmath16 . in section 5 ,",
    "we conclude by applying the cluster abundance constraint on @xmath1 in combination with the constraint on cobe normalization of @xmath9 to pick out a spectrum of best - fitting @xmath11cdm and qcdm models .",
    "in this section , we present the derivation of the cluster abundance constraint on @xmath1 for qcdm models . we take a pedagogical approach in which we first discuss each step for a @xmath11cdm model and then point out the differences that arise in qcdm models . the final result can be found in section 3 .",
    "press - schechter theory relates the number density of clusters to their mass .",
    "observations determine directly the temperature instead of the mass of clusters .",
    "therefore , the mass - temperature relation derived from the virial theorem ( lahav et al . 1991 ; lilje 1992 ) is used to apply the press - schechter relation .",
    "first , let s consider a universe with vacuum energy density @xmath17 .",
    "for a spherical overdensity , we have @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the kinetic energy , @xmath20 is the potential energy associated with the spherical mass overdensity , and @xmath21 is the potential energy associated with @xmath11 .",
    "the kinetic energy is @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the mass of the cluster and @xmath24 is the mean square velocity of particles in the cluster .",
    "the gravitational potential is @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the gravitational constant and @xmath27 is the radius of the cluster . the potential due to vacuum energy is @xmath28 .",
    "re - expressing the background matter energy density at redshift @xmath29 as @xmath30 where @xmath31 the is the hubble parameter , @xmath32 is the ratio of the matter density to the critical density , and @xmath29 is the redshift , the virial relation ( [ virial ] ) becomes : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the ratio of the cluster to background density , and @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the density parameters for vacuum energy and matter at redshift @xmath29 , respectively . the observed temperature of the gas is @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the mean mass of particles ; @xmath39 is the line - of - sight velocity dispersion ; @xmath40 is the ratio of the kinetic energy to the temperature and @xmath41 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "the mass of the cluster is then : @xmath42^{-1/2 } \\left[1-\\frac{2}{\\delta_c } \\frac{\\omega_{\\lambda}(z)}{\\omega_{m}(z)}\\right]^{-3/2 }   h^{-1}10^{15 } m_{\\odot}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 where @xmath44 is a fudge factor of order unity that allows deviation from the simplistic spherical model . using this relation , the mass - temperature relation of a virialized cluster",
    "can be computed at any @xmath29 . however ,",
    "if we evaluate at redshift @xmath45 , twice the turn - around time ( that is , @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the redshift at which the cluster turns around , @xmath48 ) , then @xmath49 becomes a function of @xmath4 only ( for @xmath11 and open universes ) .",
    "note that @xmath50 is the redshift at which the cluster formally collapses to @xmath51 according to an unperturbed spherical solution .    in quintessence models ,",
    "the principal difference is that the energy density in @xmath12 decreases with time , whereas vacuum energy remains constant .",
    "the @xmath12-component does not cluster on scales less than 100  mpc ( caldwell , dave , & steinhardt 1998 ) .",
    "consequently , the only effect of @xmath12 on the abundance of rich clusters with size less than 100 mpc is through its modification of the background evolution",
    ". we will restrict ourselves to cases where the equation - of - state @xmath8 is constant or slowly varying . in this case , the ratio @xmath52 above can be replaced by @xmath53 .    for quintessence models ,",
    "the ratio of cluster to background density , @xmath54 , is a function of two variables : @xmath55 where @xmath56 ; @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the radius of the cluster at @xmath59 and at virialization , respectively .",
    "( the second equality utilizes the standard assumption that the cluster has virialized at @xmath45 . ) the factor @xmath60 has been computed by solving for the evolution of a spherical overdensity in a cosmological model with constant @xmath8 ( see appendix a ) .",
    "we find that @xmath61 is weakly model - dependent : @xmath62 for @xmath63 .",

    ", we have : @xmath64 this leads to an approximate solution @xmath65 where @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "the fact that @xmath68 is time - dependent if @xmath69 is because the energy within the cluster is not exactly conserved and the temperature is shifting after virialization due to the change in the @xmath12-energy , @xmath70 , within the cluster . however , since the matter density @xmath71 is much larger than @xmath70 in a collapsed cluster , this correction is negligible .",
    "the dispersion of the density field on a given comoving scale @xmath27 is @xmath72 where @xmath73 and @xmath74 @xmath75 is the power spectrum and @xmath76 is the fourier transform of the fractional density perturbation @xmath77 @xmath78 for constant or slowly varying @xmath79 , the bbks approximation to the power spectrum ( bardeen et al . 1986 ) is reliable . however , if @xmath80 or if @xmath8 is rapidly varying , we find no general fitting formula ; instead , @xmath9 must be obtained numerically .",
    "the @xmath2 mass fluctuation @xmath81 can be expressed as @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is the growth factor .",
    "the growth factor is proportional to the linear density perturbation @xmath84 and normalized to @xmath85 .",

    "\\(1 ) as we argued , an integration ( with merger correction ) of eq .",
    "( [ dps ] ) is necessary since the mass - temperature relation is redshift dependent .",
    "most groups only applied eqs .",
    "( [ m_vir ] ) and ( [ ps ] ) at redshift @xmath15 to obtain their main results , which leads to an overestimate of @xmath1 by as much as @xmath114 .",

    "( [ m_vir ] ) .",
    "in so doing , they effectively incorporated the integration correction into the coefficient @xmath98 for the cases that were numerically tested .",

    "( [ m_vir ] ) .",
    "we shall call their corresponding coefficient @xmath116 to emphasize that the physical meaning of this coefficient has been modified to include intregration over redshift .",

    "\\(2 ) the shape of the theoretical cluster temperature function , eq .",
    "( [ dps ] ) , does not agree equally well with observations for all parameters .",
    "the fit is particularly poor for models with large @xmath117 and positive tilt ( @xmath118 ) . to handle this problem",
    ", some groups ( wef ; pen ; vl ) only fit the observed number density at one particular temperature ; this introduces some arbitrariness and leads to much larger uncertainties depending on which temperature is chosen . in our analysis , we fit the theoretical temperature function to all the data points provided by ha .",
    "\\(3 ) the recent correction to the ha data results in a correction to the vl results of 20% .",

    "( [ m_vir ] ) due to the uncertainties of the numerical simulations .",
    "we found that the most extensive simulation results , those of ecf and pen , agree very well with each other . by normalizing our theoretical calculations to their simulations",
    ", we found @xmath123 .",
    "notice that their reported values for the coefficient are @xmath124 and @xmath125 , respectively .",
    "this discrepancy is due to rolling into @xmath116 the integration effect described under ( 1 ) .",
    "recent simulations by bryan and norman ( 1997 ) also indicate a similar result , once one corrects for their slightly higher value of @xmath97 .",
    "\\(5 ) some groups ( vl ) used the differential temperature function ( the cluster abundance within unit temperature interval around a center value @xmath126 ) while others ( wef ; ecf ; penn ; ks ) used cumulative temperature function ( the cluster abundance with temperature above a critical temperature @xmath127 ) .",
    "these two approaches give similar results because the cluster abundance drops exponentially with temperature and the cumulative cluster abundance is well approximated by counting the cluster abundance around @xmath127 .",
    "we compared the results obtained by using the differential temperature function given by ha and that obtained by using the cumulative temperature function provided by ecf and found them to be in good agreement .",
    "however , the error bar of the latter is much smaller : most models were excluded by 95% confidence level by the temperature function fitting . to be conservative",

    "by applying the same theoretical tools , we can also study the evolution of the cluster abundance to obtain further constraints on @xmath1 and @xmath4 .",
    "the current redshift survey results were converted to number densities of clusters with their comoving-1.5 mass ( the mass within comoving radius @xmath128 ) greater than a given mass threshold @xmath129 ( carlberg et al .",

    "the log - abundance as a function of @xmath29 , @xmath135 , is roughly linear as a function of @xmath29 for @xmath136 for the models of interest .",
    "a useful parameter to characterize the evolution of cluster abundance at redshift @xmath137 is @xmath138 , defined by @xmath139 where @xmath140 is the number density of clusters with comoving-1.5 mass greater than @xmath129 observed at redshift @xmath29 .",
    "the smaller @xmath138 is , the stronger the evolution is . by applying this analysis to models , we found + ( 1 ) cluster abundance evolution strongly depends on @xmath1 : low @xmath1 leads to strong evolution .",
    "this agrees with what bahcall , fan , & cen ( 1997 ) have found .",
    "this is a general feature of gaussian - distributed random density peaks .",
    "+ ( 2 ) cluster abundance is also sensitive to the equation - of - state of quintessence @xmath8 : low @xmath8 leads to strong evolution . with the same @xmath32 , the growth of density perturbations",
    "gets suppressed earlier in high @xmath8 models , therefore , they have a weaker evolution in recent epochs ( @xmath137 ) .",
    "+ in figure  1 , we show @xmath141 as a function of @xmath1 for some sample models which have been chosen because they all fit current observations well ( see discussion in following section ) .",
    "we allow @xmath1 to vary from 0.5 to 1.0 with the cobe normalized @xmath1 shown as opaque circles .",
    "the current redshift survey data ( bahcall & fan 1998 ) indicate @xmath142 at the 3@xmath143 level ( with mean equal to -1.7 ) , which is consistent with all six cobe normalized models .",
    "the cluster abundance and evolution constraints , when combined with future measurements of the cosmic microwave background , may be an effective means of discriminating quintessence and @xmath11 models .    the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy provides a constraint on the mass power spectrum on the horizon scale . for a given model , this constraint from large - scale anisotropy as measured by the cobe - dmr satellite ( smoot et al .",
    "1992 ; bennett et al .",
    "1996 ) can be extrapolated to obtain a limit on @xmath1 that is completely independent of the cluster abundance constraint . in figure  2 , we plot the dependence of @xmath1 on @xmath144 . for each @xmath8 ,",
    "a different curve is shown . along each curve",
    "is highlighted the range of @xmath145 consistent with the cluster abundance constraint derived in this paper .",
    "hence , the best - fit models are those near the middle of the highlighted regions .",
    "these are the same models used as examples in figure  1",
    ".    near future satellite experiments , such as the nasa microwave anisotropy probe ( map ) and the esa planck mission , will greatly improve upon cobe by determining the temperature anisotropy power spectrum to extremely high precision from large to small angular scales .",
    "even a full - sky , cosmic variance limited measurement of the cmb anisotropy , though , may not be sufficient to discriminate @xmath11cdm from qcdm models .",
    "there is a degeneracy in parameter space such that , for any given @xmath11cdm models , there is a continuous family of qcdm models which predicts the same cmb power spectrum ( huey et al .",
    "1998 ; white 1998 ) it is possible that the data points to a qcdm model , say , which lies outside this degenerate set of models , _",
    "e.g. _ , a model with rapidly varying @xmath8 .",
    "however , if the data points to the degenerate set of models , then it is critically important to find a method of discriminating models further .",
    "not only does degeneracy mean that @xmath11 can not be distinguished from quintessence , but also that large uncertainty in @xmath4 and @xmath7 . here",
    "we wish to illustrate how cluster abundance may play an important role .",
    "an example of a  degeneracy curve \" is shown in figure  3 . given a value of @xmath7 for any one point along the curve , values of @xmath7",
    "can be chosen for other points along the curve such that the models are all indistinguishable from cmb measurements .",
    "the near - future satellites are capable of limiting parameter space to a single degeneracy curve .",
    "the cmb anisotropy also narrowly constrains @xmath109 , @xmath146 , and @xmath147 . however , even when combined with the cluster abundance constraint and other cosmological constraints from the age , hubble constant , baryon fraction , lyman-@xmath148 opacity , deceleration parameter and mass power spectrum , a substantial degeneracy can remain .",
    "figure  3 includes a shaded region which exemplifies the range which these models might allow , based on current measurements ( wang et al .",
    "1998 ; huey et al . 1998 ) .",
    "because of the uncertainty in cluster abundance at @xmath15 and other cosmic parameters , the overlap between the degeneracy curve and the shaded region allows a wide range of @xmath4 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "cluster evolution offers a promising approach for breaking the degeneracy .",
    "figure  4 illustrates the variation of @xmath138 as a function of @xmath8 for models along the degeneracy curve and inside the shaded region of figure  3 .",
    "the variation in @xmath138 is nearly 2 , corresponding to nearly two orders of magnitude variation in abundance at redshift @xmath149 .",
    "the range of @xmath138 is between -3.5 and -5.5 in this case , but this could be shifted upward or downward by adjusting cosmic parameters .",
    "the point is that models which are degenerate in terms of cmb anisotropy are spread out in @xmath138 .",
    "if the measurements can be refined so that @xmath138 is know to better than @xmath150 , then cluster evolution may play an important role in discriminating between quintessence and vacuum density and , thereby , determining @xmath4 and @xmath7 .",
