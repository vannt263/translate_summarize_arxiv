    "exotic species , commonly referred to as  invasive \" species , are defined as any species , capable of propagating into a nonnative environment .",
    "if established , they can be extremely difficult to eradicate , or even manage @xcite .",
    "there are numerous cases of environmental , economic and ecological losses attributed to invasive species @xcite .",
    "some well - known examples of these species include the burmese python in the united states and the cane toad in australia , both of which have been wreaking havoc on indigenous ecosystems @xcite . despite the magnitude of threats posed by invasive species ,",
    "there have been very few conclusive results to eradicate or contain these species in real scenarios , in the wild .",
    "biological control is an adopted strategy to limit invasive populations @xcite .",
    "it works on the so called  enemy release hypothesis \" , in which natural enemies of the target species / pest , are released against it in a controlled fashion",
    ". these can be in the form of predators , parasitoids , pathogens or combinations thereof @xcite .",
    "it is a controversial yet fascinating area , with much debate and regulation .",
    "an interesting problem in the field , is the  biological control paradox \" @xcite .",
    "this has attracted much research attention , see @xcite and the references within .",
    "the essential paradox here is that if one models a predator - pest system , via the holling type ii functional response , we can not obtain a stable coexistence equilibrium , where the pest density is low .",
    "however , in reality many predators introduced for biological control purposes , are able to keep pest densities down to low levels .",
    "yet another interesting conundrum , also of a paradoxical nature , pertains to the effectiveness of generalist predators as biological controls . in theory , generalist predators ,",
    "are considered poor agents for biological control @xcite .",
    "this is due to many factors , such as lack of specific prey targets , highly frequent interference amongst themselves , and their interference in the search of other specialist predators @xcite .",
    "however , there is a large body of growing field evidence , showing that generalist predators , are actually quite effective in regulating pest densities @xcite .",
    "thus there is an apparent discrepancy between what theory predicts , and what is actually seen in empirical observations .",
    "the primary objective of the current manuscript , is to corroborate these empirical observations , by proposing an alternate theory to understand the effect of generalist predator interferences , as it effects their efficiency as biological controls .",
    "biological control is  risky business \" .",
    "for example , the introduced species might attack a variety of species , other than those it was released to control .",
    "this phenomena is referred to as a _ non - target effect _",
    "@xcite , and is common in natural enemies that are generalist predators .",
    "some well known example of this are the cane toad ( _ bufo marinus _ ) and the nile perch ( _ lates niloticus _ ) @xcite .",
    "the secondary objective of the current manuscript , is to use our proposed theory to explain why certain species such as the cane toad , that were originally introduced as a biological control , have had an explosive increase in population .",
    "before we delve further into these aspects we briefly survey some of the relevant literature on mutual interference .",
    "mutual interference @xcite is defined as the behavioral interactions among feeding organisms , that reduce the time that each individual spends obtaining food , or the amount of food each individual consumes .",
    "it occurs most commonly where the amount of food is scarce , or when the population of feeding organisms is large @xcite .",
    "food chain models incorporating mutual interference have a long history , and were first proposed by hassell @xcite , and roger and hassell @xcite , to model insect parasites and predator searching behaviour .",
    "three species food chain models with mutual interference , and time delays , were proposed by freedman and his group and they studied the trade - off between mutual interference among predators , and time delays due to gestation @xcite .",
    "they observed that mutual interference is acting as a stabilizing factor and time delay does not necessarily destabilize the system , but increasing delay may cause a bifurcation into periodic solutions . for a delayed predator - prey model with mutual interference parameter",
    "wang and zu @xcite have obtained some sufficient conditions for the permanence and global attractively . comparing this with empirical / statistical evidences from 19 predator - prey systems ,",
    "skalski and gilliam @xcite pointed out that the predator dependent functional responses ( hassell - varley type @xcite , beddington - deangelis type @xcite and crowley - martin type @xcite ) could provide a better description of predator feeding , over a range of predator - prey abundances , and in some cases the beddington - deangelis ( bd ) type functional response performed even better @xcite .",
    "upadhyay and iyengar @xcite have pointed out that if predators do not waste time , interacting with one another , or if the attacks are always successful and instantaneous , then the response changes into holling type ii functional response , and the predators benefit from co - feeding .    in light of our objectives",
    "we ask the following questions :    * how does mutual interference amongst generalist predators effect their efficiency as biological controls ? * specifically , can the interference delay or exacerbate controlling the target species ? * can interference cause a population explosion in certain generalist predator biological agent populations ?    to answer these we investigate the three species model proposed in @xcite , where the interaction between the intermediate predator and the top predator is modeled according to the beddington - deangelis type functional response .",
    "this response models predator interference in the top predator @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "we first introduce a concept central to our investigations .",
    "we introduce the dynamic of finite time blow - up to address our question on interference , via the following connected definitions :    given a mathematical model for a nonlinear process , say through a partial differential equation ( pde ) , one says finite time blow - up occurs if @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a certain function space with a norm @xmath3 , @xmath0 is the solution to the pde in question , and @xmath4 is the blow - up time . in the case of an ordinary differential equation ( ode ) model the function space @xmath2 is simply the real numbers @xmath5 .",
    "if blow - up does not occur , that is @xmath6 , we say there is global existence , that is a solution exists for all time .    consider a mathematical model ( pde or ode ) for the population dynamics of a certain species @xmath0 , introduced as a biological control .",
    "if the model blows - up in finite time , that is @xmath7 then we say the @xmath0 population has reached an `` excessive '' level . in these excessive numbers it is able to wipe out the target pest almost with certainty .",
    "there is a rich history of blow - up problems in pde theory and its interpretations in physical phenomenon .",
    "for example , blow - up may be interpreted as the failure of certain constitutive materials leading to gradient catastrophe or fracture , it may be interpreted as an uncontrolled feedback loop such as in thermal runaway , leading to explosion .",
    "it might also be interpreted as a sudden change in physical quantities such as pressure or temperature such as during a shock or in the ignition process .",
    "the interested reader is referred to @xcite .",
    "blow - up in population dynamics is usually interpreted as excessively high concentrations in small regions of space , such as seen in chemotaxis problems @xcite . in the current manuscript , blow - up in a population of a population of bio - control agents ,",
    "is interpreted as the population becoming excessive , which then enables it to easily control the target pest , given that it has excessive numbers .",
    "this leads us to equate    @xmath8    however , there might also be various negative effects associated with this @xcite .",
    "for example the following chain of events might occur    @xmath9    via this formulation , it is conceivable to see how this is what might have occurred with the cane toad in australia . the cane toad was introduced in australia in 1935 to control the cane beetle . however , the toad being a generalist predator , attacked various other species @xcite .",
    "in addition , the toad is highly poisonous and therefore other predators shy away from eating it .",
    "this has enabled the toad population to grow virtually unchecked , and it is today considered one of australia s worst invasive species @xcite .",
    "the contributions of the current manuscript are :    * we introduce a new concept to measure the success of a biological control by equating @xmath10 * we show the three species model proposed in @xcite , and its spatially explicit version , can blow - up in finite time , for sufficiently large initial data via theorem [ t1 ] and corollary [ ct1 ] . * we show predator interference _ is the sole factor _ in inducing blow - up , when there is global existence in the no interference case .",
    "this is demonstrated via theorem [ t2 ] and corollary [ ct2 ] .",
    "* the spatially explicit form of the three species model proposed in @xcite , possesses spatio - temporal chaos .",
    "also time delays in the temporal model , affect both the blow - up dynamics as well as the chaotic dynamics .",
    "* based on the above results , we propose that generalist predator interference _ might be a cause of their success _ , in controlling target pests .",
    "however , predator interference may also be a cause of the population explosion of certain species , introduced originally for biological control purposes , such as the cane toad in australia .",
    "we provide details of the model formulation next .",
    "we consider an ecosystem where a specialist predator / pest @xmath11 , invasive or otherwise , is depredating on a prey species @xmath12 . in order to control @xmath11 , a generalist predator @xmath0",
    "is released into the same ecosystem .",
    "the goal is that @xmath0 will hunt and depredate on @xmath11 , its favorite food , thus lowering the population of @xmath11 .",
    "the dynamical interaction between @xmath11 and @xmath12 is modeled via standard rosenzweig - mcarthur scheme @xcite , while the dynamics between @xmath0 and @xmath11 is modeled via a leslie - gower formulation , where interference in the top predator @xmath0 is assumed , and this is modeled via a beddington deangelis functional response @xcite .",
    "upadhyay et al .",
    "@xcite have proposed a tri - trophic hybrid food chain model to study such a system . here",
    "the prey population density @xmath12 serves as the only food for the intermediate specialist predator population of density @xmath11 .",
    "this population @xmath11 serves as a favorite food for the generalist top predator population of density r.    @xmath13    now , we present a brief sketch of the construction of the model which is biologically motivated .    *",
    "behavior of the entire community is assumed to arise from the coupling of these interacting species where population @xmath11 prey on @xmath12 and only on @xmath12 and the top predator preys on favorite food @xmath11 but it has other options for food in case of scarcity or short supply . *",
    "the rate of change of population size for prey and intermediate predator has been written according to the rosenzweig - mcarthur scheme i.e. predator population dies out exponentially in the absence of its prey and prey population density grows according to the famous logistic growth rate . *",
    "the top predator is a sexually reproducing species .",
    "the interaction between the intermediate predator @xmath11 and the top predator @xmath0 is according to the beddingto - deangelis type functional response @xcite .",
    "this response models predator interference in the top predator @xmath0 .",
    "we impose different assumptions from the ones assumed in @xcite to formulate the spatially explicit form of the differential equations which describe the model .",
    "the detailed meaning of the different parameters is given in @xcite .",
    "further , we also assume that all the three populations perform active movements in space .",
    "random movement of animals occurs because of various requirements and necessities like , search for better food , better opportunity for social interactions such as finding mates @xcite .",
    "food availability and living conditions demand that these animals migrate to other spatial locations . in the proposed model , we have included diffusion terms assuming that the animal movements are uniformly distributed in all directions .",
    "the model is described by the following set of partial differential equations . with suitable initial conditions and neumann boundary conditions ,",
    "@xmath14    the physical domain for the problem is some bounded set @xmath15 , which is a subset of @xmath16 . for numerical simulations ,",
    "we restrict ourselves to @xmath17 , here we take @xmath18 $ ] .",
    "@xmath19represent the diffusion coefficients of prey , intermediate predator and top predator respectively .",
    "@xmath20 is the laplacian operator which describes the random movement .",
    "note we always restrict @xmath21 .",
    "violation of this condition , will _ always _ cause finite time blow - up @xcite , and as a rule must be avoided in such models @xcite .",
    "@xmath22 is the outward unit normal vector of the boundary .",
    "the main reason for choosing such boundary conditions is that we are interested in the self - organization of patterns , and zero - flux boundary conditions imply that no external input is imposed @xcite .",
    "a pest only free equilibrium @xmath23 does not exist in the ode or pde case .",
    "this is due to the assumption that @xmath21 . in the event that @xmath24 , the equation for the top predator , has only a decay term @xmath25 , hence @xmath0 will also be driven to zero . however , in the event that @xmath0 blows - up ( gets excessively large ) , the @xmath11 equation will reduce to    @xmath26    in this case @xmath11 can be driven to extinction if @xmath27    note , one could also consider the addition of @xmath28 , in the equation for @xmath0 . this would represents additional dispersive force due to local overcrowding .",
    "this is interpreted as movement from high towards low concentrations of @xmath0 , directly proportional to @xmath0 .",
    "hence , @xmath0 attempts to disperses toward lower concentrations , due to the excessive intraspecific competition from interference . there is a fair amount of literature that in high prey density areas intraspecific competition in predator species is heightened @xcite . in such a setting the predators",
    "should have greater dispersal in order to better assimilate available resources and avoid crowding .",
    "furthermore @xmath29 can be set to 0 so that we recover @xmath30 .",
    "in this section we show improvements to theorem [ thm : u ] from @xcite .",
    "we first recap the result from @xcite    [ thm : u ] assume that the following conditions hold    @xmath31    and let @xmath32 be defined by the set    @xmath33\\ ] ]    where @xmath34}$ ] and @xmath35 and @xmath36 and @xmath37 then ( i ) @xmath32 is positively invariant ( ii ) all non negative solutions of system are uniformly bounded and they eventually enter the attracting set @xmath32 ( iii ) the model system is dissipative    the primary issue with theorem [ thm : u ] is that an attracting set is invariant , but an invariant set * may not * be attracting .",
    "although the set @xmath32 is invariant , that is if we start in @xmath32 we remain in @xmath32 for all time , we will show it is not attracting for large initial conditions . in particular for large enough initial conditions , system can actually blow - up in finite time .",
    "next we demonstrate finite time blow - up in .",
    "[ t1 ] consider the three species food chain model given by , for any choice of parameters , including the ones satisfying theorem [ thm : u ] , and a @xmath38 , such that @xmath39 . given any initial data @xmath40 , there exists initial data @xmath41 , such that if this data meets the largeness condition    @xmath42    then will blow - up in finite time , that is    @xmath43    here the blow - up time @xmath44    consider the equation for the top predator    @xmath45    in the event that @xmath46 , blow - up is obvious . if @xmath47 , where @xmath48 or @xmath49 , blow - up is far from obvious .",
    "however still possible for large data . to see this note , if    @xmath50    then @xmath0 will blow - up in finite time in comparison with    @xmath51    the tricky part here is that @xmath52 can switch sign , and this is dependent on the dynamics of the middle predator @xmath11 , which changes in time . in order to guarantee blow - up , we must have that @xmath53 or equivalently we must guarantee that    @xmath54    to this end we will work with the equation for @xmath11    @xmath55    here the interference term @xmath56 will come to our aid .",
    "note    @xmath57    as trivially one has    @xmath58    thus using the above we obtain    @xmath59    multiplying the above through by @xmath60 , and integrating in the time interval @xmath61 $ ] yields the estimate    @xmath62    we now use this in to yield    @xmath63    equivalently ,    @xmath64    now note    @xmath51    blows - up at time @xmath65 , thus if we choose data such that    @xmath66    then the above guarantees that @xmath11 will remain above the critical level @xmath67 , for sufficiently long enough time , for @xmath0 to blow - up .",
    "this yields that as long as the following holds    @xmath68    @xmath0 will blow up in finite time , independent of the choice of the parameters of theorem [ thm : u ] .",
    "this proves the theorem .",
    "note that here we have an _ explicit _ sufficient condition on the largeness of the initial data to cause blow - up .",

    "the presence of blow - up is not affected via the overcrowding term , if we maintain neumann boundary conditions at the boundaries .",

    "the goal of this section is to investigate spatio - temporal chaos in the model .",

    "there is a large literature on the effect of delay on both two and three species predator - prey models .",
    "upadhyay and agrawal @xcite investigated the effect of mutual interference on the dynamics of delay induced predator prey system , and determined the conditions under which the model becomes globally asymptotically stable around the nonzero equilibria .",
    "recently , jana et al .",
    "@xcite have made an attempt to understand the role of top predator interference and gestation delay on the dynamics of a three species food chain model .",
    "interaction between the prey and the middle predator follows volterra scheme , while that between the top predator and its prey depends on the beddington - deangelis type functional response .",
    "upadhyay et al .",
    "@xcite studied the three species food chain model with generalist type top predator and obtained that increasing the top predator interference stabilizes the system , while increasing the normalization of the residual reduction in the top predator population destabilizes the system . in our current investigations",
    "we choose a constant time delay , in various forms .",
    "these are demonstrated next .",
    "we perform all our simulations using the standard matlab routine dde23 , for delay differential equations @xcite .      in this section",
    "we attempt to numerically investigate the effect of a constant time delay @xmath185 on the chaotic dynamics the system possesses @xcite . for this",
    "we choose to place the time delay in different parts of the functional response , of the top predator equation only .",
    "the first delayed model we consider is the following ; @xmath186 the equations for @xmath187 remain the same .",
    "for the investigations we have chosen @xmath188 in figure [ 1de ] and @xmath189 in fig [ 2de ] .     takes a chaotic state ( with no delay ) into a stable focus.,title=\"fig : \" ]   takes a chaotic state ( with no delay ) into a stable focus.,title=\"fig : \" ]     maintains a similar structure.,title=\"fig : \" ]   maintains a similar structure.,title=\"fig : \" ]    therefore via fig.[1de ] , fig.[2de ] we see that for a small time delay , the dynamics remain the same , but with an increase in the delay we can observe a radical change in the dynamics .",
    "next we aim to observe the effect of delay on the blow - up dynamics in the model . here",
    "we incorporated delay in its growth term @xmath190 .",
    "this seems plausible due to gestation effect , as well as because this is the term that causes finite time blow - up .",
    "after the introduction of delay into the model we have ; @xmath191     in takes a chaotic state ( no delay ) into a limit cycle.,title=\"fig : \" ]   in takes a chaotic state ( no delay ) into a limit cycle.,title=\"fig : \" ]    we have chosen a parameter set for which we have the blow up in the ode model without delay . upon introducing the delay ( @xmath192 ) , in we found that the system does not exhibit blow - up . +",
    "the chosen parameter set for all of our simulations is @xmath193",
    "in the current manuscript we propose an alternate theory that provides a partial answer to the paradox of the generalist predator .",
    "generalist predators are considered poor for biological control purposes , primarily due to mutual interference and their interference in the search of other specialist predators .",
    "how then might they be effective in controlling pest densities , as suggested by real field data ?",
    "we suggest that the interference , might actually be a cause in their population explosion , enabling them in these excessive numbers to control the target pest . from a biological point of view",
    ", i think the crucial point is that by interfering in the search of specialist predators , they _ indirectly keep the pest density high enough _ , for themselves to excessively harvest the pest , resulting in a sharp growth of their own population , described mathematically by finite time blow - up .",
    "thus there seems to be an underlying feedback mechanism , between this indirect interference and their own harvesting .",
    "this is a subtle point that warrants further investigation .",
    "our work also opens an alternate approach to understanding the population explosion of species such as the cane toad , introduced originally for biological control .",
    "maybe the toad due to its excessive interference with other predators , was able to keep the population of its food source high enough , so that it could feed enough and grow unchecked .",
    "this explosive growth was also helped by the fact that the toad being poisonous , was not easily predated upon .",
    "finite time blow - up here should be viewed as a mathematical construct , that is a conduit to understanding population explosions .",
    "one should not consider it in the literal sense , as a population can not become infinite in finite time .",
    "however , an equation describing populations , with such emergent behavior , can be a tool to understand excessive increases in population , such as precisely the situation with the cane toad .",
    "all in all we hope that the alternate approach we provide , will help reconcile the conflict between theory and data , as concerns the effectiveness of the generalist predator as a biological control .",
