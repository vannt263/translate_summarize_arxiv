    "with the discovery of the higgs - like scalar at the cern lhc  @xcite , the higgs mechanism  @xcite for spontaneous breaking of the gauge symmetry in the standard model ( sm ) appears to be a correct description of nature .",
    "it opens a new era of direct probes of electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "it was observed by kirzhnits and linde  @xcite that spontaneously broken symmetries are usually restored at the high temperature .",
    "thus the broken electroweak symmetry is expected to be restored in the early universe .",
    "a transition occurred about @xmath2 second after the big bang .",
    "the dynamics of the electroweak phase transition ( ewpt ) , which are still open questions , are important in the attempts to explain the observed matter - antimatter asymmetry of the universe in terms of baryon number violation in the electroweak theory and cosmological models of baryogenesis  @xcite . in particular , the condition that the baryon excess generated at the ewpt will not be washed out requires a strong enough first order phase transition , which translates into an upper bound on the higgs boson mass .",
    "the @xmath3 higgs boson will be too heavy to give rise to a first order ewpt .",
    "theoretically , dynamics of the ewpt are determined by the effective higgs potential at the finite temperature , which are tightly connected with the higgs interactions at the zero temperature .",
    "a strongly fist - order ewpt requires new higgs interactions with particles beyond the sm .",
    "ewpt is one of the necessary conditions for a workable electroweak baryogenesis mechanism of generating the matter - antimatter asymmetry , which results in the visible part of our universe .",
    "for the invisible part of our universe , precisely cosmological observations have confirmed the existence of the non - baryonic cold dark matter @xmath4",
    "@xcite , which provides another evidence of the new physics beyond the sm .",
    "much effort has been employed to interpret the dark matter signals . among various possible dark matter candidates that have been explored in the literature , the weakly interacting massive particle(wimp )",
    "@xcite stands out as the most interesting scenario .",
    "however the nature of the dark matter and the way that the dark matter interacts with the ordinary matter are still mysteries .",
    "the discovery of the higgs boson opens up new ways of probing the dark matter .",
    "it is natural to consider the higgs portal dark matter model  @xcite , in which dark matter couples to the sm higgs in the form @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the higgs bilinear , @xmath7 , which is one of the lowest mass dimension and gauge invariant operators in the sm .",
    "@xmath8 is the dark matter bilinear and can be written as @xmath9 for the scalar dark matter , @xmath10 for the fermonic dark matter , where @xmath11 is roughly the mass scale of the mediators for a @xmath12 coupling between the dark matter and the sm higgs , @xmath13 for the vector dark matter .    in this paper",
    "we study the possibility of getting a strongly first order ewpt in the framework of the higgs portal vector dark matter model  @xcite , which extends the sm with a spontaneously broken @xmath0 gauge symmetry and a @xmath1 discrete flavor symmetry , that stabilizes the new vector field as a dark matter candidate .",
    "a complex scalar singlet is needed to break the @xmath0 gauge symmetry and gives the mass to the vector dark matter .",
    "the scalar singlet is mixed with the sm higgs via the quartic interaction .",
    "the strongly first order ewpt is triggered by the same interaction in our model .",
    "for the effect of scalar singlets on the ewpt , see  @xcite .",
    "our study is new in the following two aspects :    * we treat the effective potential in a gauge invariant way .",
    "the critical temperature @xmath14 and the energy scale @xmath15 is gauge invariant ; * ewpt is closely related to the phenomenology of the vector dark matter in our model .",
    "our study shows that even though there are strong constraints on the model from the exclusion limits of the dark matter direct detection experiments such as lux  @xcite , one can still find the parameter space , where all the dark matter constraints can be satisfied and a strongly first order ewpt can be generated .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii we give a brief introduction to the model .",
    "section iii is the study of the dark matter phenomenology .",
    "we investigate the ewpt and its correlation with the higgs portal vector dark matter in section iv .",
    "the last part is the concluding remarks .",
    "we assume the dark matter is a vector boson , @xmath16 , which can be the gauge field of a @xmath17 gauge symmetry that is spontaneously broken .",
    "sm fields carry no @xmath0 charge .",

    "the model has a @xmath18 discrete flavor symmetry , under which @xmath16 is odd and all the other fields are even , which makes @xmath16 a stable dark matter candidate .",

    "<S> we investigate an extension of the standard model ( sm ) with a @xmath0 gauge symmetry , which is spontaneously broken by a complex scalar singlet and where the new gauge boson is a stable dark matter candidate via a @xmath1 flavor symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> the possibility of generating a strongly first order electroweak phase transition ( ewpt ) needed for the electroweak baryogenesis mechanism in this model is studied using a gauge independent method . </S>",
    "<S> our result shows a considerable parameter space where both successful dark matter phenomenologies and a strongly first order ewpt can be achieved . </S>"
