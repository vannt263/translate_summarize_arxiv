    "for the description of multivalent nanoparticles binding to cells , the model first presented by martinez - veracoecha and frenkel in ref.@xcite is used , generalized here to allow for the presence of different receptor types .",
    "this model has been shown to reproduce experimental data and monte carlo simulations for both ligand - functionalized nanoparticles and polymers @xcite .",
    "details can be found in the original papers , but its main assumptions will also be reported here .",
    "+ this model considers a solution of particles functionalized with ligands that can bind reversibly to receptors displayed on a cell surface ( see fig.[fig : cases ] ) .",
    "for each nanoparticle , it is assumed that only the @xmath1 ligands facing the surface can bind to it .",
    "since nanoparticles can not overlap and thus occupy different positions , ligands compete for the same receptors only if coated on the same nanoparticle , but not otherwise .",
    "this is accounted for by dividing the cell surface into @xmath2 adsorption sites , each of which contains a set @xmath3 of different receptors , whose number per site @xmath4 follows a poisson distribution . from here on , subscripts indicate receptor types .",
    "every ligand can bind to a receptor of type @xmath5 with scaled bond energy @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the thermal energy at temperature @xmath8 and @xmath9 is boltzmann s constant ( scaled energies will be indicated by a tilde `` @xmath10  ' ' ) . as typical for ligand - receptor mediated interactions , it is further assumed that each receptor can bind at most one ligand , and the other way round too ( but `` multimeric '' ligand - receptor clusters can also be accounted for @xcite ) . generalizing the martinez - veracoecha and frenkel model , the simplest yet representative realization of the system describing the effects of non - specific interactions",
    "is considered , where adsorption sites can display two types of receptors , `` targeted '' and `` untargeted '' ones , with bond energies @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively .",
    "although in general many different types of receptors can be present , more complex cases do not add any qualitatively different behaviour , and can be treated quantitatively with the same techniques described here .",
    "+ under the previous assumptions , the fraction of sites @xmath13 on the cell surface occupied by a bound construct , used as a defintion of the adsorption probability , can be written as @xcite :    @xmath14    in eq .",
    "[ eq : adsorption ] @xmath15 indicates an average over two poisson distributions , one for the number of targeted ( @xmath8 ) , and one for the number of untargeted ( @xmath16 ) receptors .",
    "furthermore , @xmath17 is the ratio between the partition function of the nanoparticle in the bound vs unbound state and @xmath18 is the activity of the nanoparticles in the bulk solution , proportional to nanoparticles number density and binding volume .",
    "eq.[eq : adsorption ] has the form of the typical langmuir adsorption isotherm .",
    "all multivalent effects enter via @xmath17 , related to the free - energy due to bond formation by : @xmath19 where @xmath20 indicates the free - energy due to bond formation , and @xmath21 , @xmath22 are its values when the nanoparticle is either adsorbed on the cell surface or in the bulk solution , respectively .",
    "a formal mathematical definition of @xmath20 , which is always negative or at most zero when no bonds can form , is given in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath23 term in eq.[eq : fads ] takes into account the constraint that a particle must have at least one bond with the surface to be bound .",
    "given eqs .",
    "[ eq : adsorption],[eq : fads ] , the adsorption probability @xmath13 can be calculated once @xmath20 is known for the system of ligand - receptor pairs considered .",
    "this is provided by the formula @xcite :    @xmath24    where @xmath25 is an index running over all possible binders , i.e. ligands _ or _ receptors , and @xmath26 is the probability that such binder is unbound , given by the solution of a set of non - linear coupled equations :    @xmath27    where @xmath28 . in eq.[eq : ste2 ] , @xmath29 is the strength of a bond for a specific ligand - receptor pair @xmath30 and @xmath31 is the corresponding single - bond energy .",
    "the index @xmath32 runs over all possible binding partners of @xmath25 , and there are @xmath33 coupled equations , one for each binder in the system .",
    "eqs.[eq : ste1]-[eq : ste2 ] quantitatively reproduce results from monte carlo simulations @xcite and describe systems with an arbitrary number and types of competing ligands and receptors .",
    "the resulting set of equations must be solved numerically @xcite , but analytical expressions from a mean - field model providing a qualitative picture will also be discussed ( details in the si ) .",
    "two quantities are reported to illustrate the results of the theoretical model .",
    "the first is the adsorption probability @xmath13 , given by eq.[eq : adsorption ] .",
    "the second is the so - called selectivity parameter @xmath34 @xcite , defined as :    @xmath35    which gauges nanoparticles ability to tell apart binding sites with different numbers of targeted receptors @xmath36 .",
    "more precisely , for @xmath37 the adsorption probability raises super - linearly , approaching an ideal on - off behaviour where particles bind exclusively if receptors concentration is higher than a certain threshold . on the opposite side",
    ", @xmath38 indicates appreciable adsorption for a broad range of receptors , @xmath39 being indiscriminate adsorption .",
    "fig[fig : real - binding ] illustrates the effect of non - specific interactions for nanoparticles differing in either the number of targeting ligands @xmath1 or the bond strength with untargeted receptors .",
    "the rightmost panels in @xmath40 represent the `` ideal '' behaviour one would observe when ligands do not interact at all with untargeted receptors ( see also fig.[fig : cases ] @xmath40 ) . in this case , appreciable adsorption is observed only above a certain number of targeted receptors .",
    "when the strength of untargeted bonds increases , the effect of non - specific interactions rapidly increases with it and particles also adsorb where this is not expected .",
    "in fact , above a certain number of untargeted receptors appreciable adsorption will occur even when the targeted receptors are not present at all , completly losing any selectivity . as can be inferred by comparing nanoparticles with different number of ligands to the monovalent case ( top row ) ,",
    "this problem becomes more prominent as their valency increases .",
    "the observed behaviours can be qualitatively captured within a mean - field description of adsorption .",
    "such description provides the simple expression : @xmath41 where the susbcript @xmath42 indicates targeted ( @xmath8 ) and untargeted ( @xmath16 ) receptors , respectively . given the dependence of @xmath13 on @xmath17 ( eq .  [ eq : adsorption ] ) appreciable adsorption",
    "is expected whenever @xmath43 . from eq .",
    "[ eq : mean - field - classic ] , @xmath17 increases exponentially with both the strength of untargeted bonds and the number of ligands @xmath44 .",
    "moreover , it also increases super - linearly with respect to the number of untargeted receptors whenever the valency is higher than one , predicting that selectivity will rapidly deteriorate for multivalent nanoparticles once interactions with untargeted receptors are accounted for .",
    "the same expression also shows that there is an upper limit for the number of untargeted receptor , dependent on their binding strength , above which adsorption would occur even in the complete absence of any targeted receptor ( details in the si ) .",
    "+ the observed behaviour is not unexpected , but the extent to which it affects selectivity has not received much attention .",
    "multivalency have been typically exploited to increase the binding strength to a specific target using singularly weak - bonds . in this case",
    ", the binding strength enhancement has the positive effect to decrease the detection level of the target .",
    "however , it is exactly this same feature that can provide enough binding strength to drive non - specfic adsorption due to the formation of many bonds weak with untargeted receptors .",
    "hence , when considering targeting applications , care must be taken with multivalent architectures since these effects would lead in practice to off - target binding .",
    "+ the analysis of the selectivty parameter @xmath34 , reported in fig[fig : real - binding ] @xmath45 , provides further insights into the extent of the problem .",
    "when only targeted receptors are present , it was shown @xcite that multivalent nanoparticles can achieve almost optimal on - off behaviour , i.e. @xmath37 around some value of @xmath46 .",
    "this so - dubbed `` super - selectivity '' is a specific feature of multivalent particles that , importantly , monovalent ones can never achieve @xcite .",
    "it is this advantage that suggest the use of multivalent nanoparticles for selective targeting , considering that in various diseases cells simply over - regulate the expression of certain receptors rather than expressing a mutated form that could be distinguished using an optimized ligand .",
    "considering the effect of untargeted receptors , however , the picture changes .",
    "as shown in fig[fig : real - binding ] @xmath45 , the super - selective regime can completely disappear , and indeed under broad conditions multivalent particles will perform worse then monovalent ones . as for the case of @xmath13 , the observed trends are a decrease in selectivity with increasing valency and increasing strength of the bonds to untargeted receptors , as should be expected . + given the problems previously discussed and the trends observed , a question arises : can we simply optimize ligands so as to reduce non - specific interactions ?",
    "the answer to this question is indeed positive , but one must solve a complex optimization problem .",
    "ligands optimization is usually run to find the one with the highest possible binding strength for a given receptor @xcite .",
    "this is a perfectly valid strategy if the aim is to decrease their detection threshold .",
    "this strategy , however , does not necessarily improve the ability of ligands to discern between different receptor types , which requires increasing the gap in the strength between the targeted receptor and _ every other possible receptor type _",
    ", a harder problem since in this case optimization is against various receptors and not just one .",
    "additionally , although increasing the strength of the bond with targeted receptors improve their detection , it also negatively impacts the possibility to tell apart targets with different expression levels , since stronger bonds lead to appreciable adsorption for a broader range of receptors densities , as proved in @xcite . in practice , ligands optimization is complicated by these contrasting requirements , and a different route to minimize non - specific interactions could provide an additional , if not better , solution .",
    "the problems previously described arise from the very nature of multivalent interactions , and thus will affect multivalent constructs regardless of their exact specifics . here , a general , system independent solution is proposed , exploiting so - called `` self - protected '' interactions @xcite . more precisely , the functionalization scheme proposed in ref.@xcite ( there exploited to enhance self - assembly kinetics ) is shown to lead to binding properties where the effects of untargeted receptors are strongly reduced . + in the `` self - protected '' scheme , multivalent particles are functionalized with both ligands _ and _ with receptors that can bind to them ( see fig.[fig : cases ] @xmath0 ) . from here on , the latter will be called `` protecting '' receptors .",
    "the effects of such design , reported in fig.[fig : myarchitecture ] , are evident comparing with the previous results for normal nanoparticles ( fig.[fig : real - binding ] ) .",
    "first , the amount of untargeted receptors that protected particles can bear without affecting adsorption is greatly increased , and in fact ideal behaviour is observed for almost all receptors concentrations and binding strengths . moreover , super - selective adsorption ( @xmath47 ) is recovered in scenarios where the typical multivalent architecture shows sub - optimal behaviour even compared to monovalent particles .",
    "furthermore , no strong deterioration of selectivity with increasing valency is observed for the protected design , whose properties are almost independent on valency .",
    "+    * a ) * b ) c ) d ) + e ) f ) g )    in order to shed some light on the mechanism behind this enhanced performance , it is interesting to study the effect of two important design parameters , the number of protecting receptors @xmath48 and their bond energy @xmath49 . in fig.[fig : tuning ] , panels @xmath50 , @xmath13 is reported for varying values of the ratio @xmath51 . for @xmath52",
    "one has a typical nanoparticle , and a strong deviation from the ideal behaviour is observed .",
    "such deviations progressively diminish as @xmath51 increases until this ratio equals one , at which point ideal behaviour is obtained and persists , with adsorption simply shifting to higher values of targeted receptors but remaining independent from the amount of untargeted ones ( a similar behaviour occurs for @xmath34 , not shown ) . in fig.[fig : tuning ] , panels @xmath53 , the strength of the protecting bond rather than the number of protecting ligands is varied , but similar trends are recovered . as their bond energy moves from that of an untargeted bond to lower values , the adsorption probability gradually approaches the ideal profile .",
    "moreover , as previously observed for varying @xmath51 , after the behaviour becomes basically ideal the only effect of increasing strength is to shift adsorption to higher @xmath46 values .",
    "+ quantifying these effects requires a statistical mechanical description to properly account for the relative weight of all possible binding configurations , but they can be qualitatively understood using a simple microscopic picture .",
    "ligands bound to a protecting receptor can not concurrently bind those on the surface and contribute to binding .",
    "however , the system is in a dynamic equilibrium where bonds continuously break and form , and on average bonds with surface receptors will occur if their formation is thermodynamically favourable compared to that of bonds with protecting receptors .",
    "this equilibrium depends on the relative energies of these bonds , @xmath54 and @xmath55 ( subscripts @xmath8 and @xmath16 referring to targeted and untargeted receptors , respectively ) , and on the number of ligands , protecting , and surface receptors , which determine the relative entropy of binding .",
    "this microscopic picture easily rationalizes the trends observed in figs.[fig : myarchitecture ] and [ fig : tuning ] . since protecting bonds shifts",
    "the _ effective _ bond energy without reducing the difference between targeted and untargeted receptors , it provides a way to reduce the effects of non - specific interactions while also boosting selectivity ( which increases with decreasing bond strength ) . at the same time ,",
    "when ratios of protecting receptors to targeting ligands lower than one are considered , not all ligands can be protected at the same time , and some of them remain available to bind to surface receptors irregardless of the strength of the protecting bonds , explaining the increase of non - specific adsorption with fewer protecting ligands . finally , a similar increase in deviations from ideal behaviour is expected when lowering the strength of bonds with protecting receptors because this raises the effective strengths of both targeted and untargeted bonds .",
    "the previous discussion is summarized into two simple design rules to minimize non - specific binding :    1 .   * use protecting receptors with bonds of comparable strength to those between ligands and targeted receptors",
    ", @xmath56*. effectively , the protection mechanism works as long as @xmath49 is low enough enough to cancel contributions from untargeted bonds , which as a rule of thumb ( see si ) requires @xmath57 .",
    "once this is true , decreasing @xmath49 simply increases the number of targeted receptors at which adsorption occurs @xmath58 .",
    "2 .   * use a number of protecting receptors at least equal to the number of ligands , @xmath59*. in this way all ligands can be prevented to easily form bonds with untargeted receptors .",
    "increasing @xmath48 above @xmath1 then tunes @xmath58 to higher values .      before concluding ,",
    "a realisation of the proposed design will be discussed .",
    "`` self - protected '' particles in the context of self assembly have already been experimentally implemented using single - stranded dna coated on colloids @xcite .",
    "such a system , where dna acts both as ligand and receptor , represents in itself a very interesting and powerful solution : not only dna - coated colloids are already under intense investigation as drug- and gene - delivery agents @xcite , as well as biomarkers , but even more importantly dna can bind to a large variety of molecules .",
    "in fact , short dna strands , typically referred to as `` aptamers '' , are widely used as targeting ligands for proteins , and a wide literature exists regarding their optimization @xcite . such knowledge combined with extensively validated thermodynamic models to calculate dna - dna binding energies @xcite",
    "can be combined into a general and powerful platform for the design of self - protected targeting constructs .",
    "one simple way to implement the proposed scheme would thus be to functionalize nanoparticles with both the targeting aptamer and its complementary dna sequence , which would act as its protecting receptor .",
    "dna would also provide an easy way to tune the strength of the protecting bond , by simply changing the protecing strand nucleotide sequence .",
    "+ dna - based constructs provide a highly flexible system to implement the self - protected scheme , but this design principle is general and targeting systems based on other types of tunable ligands , e.g. peptides , can also be envisaged .",
    "in this paper the influence of non - specific interactions on selective targeting using multivalent nanoparticles is addressed , using a statistical mechanical model to quantify the interaction arising from ligands binding to receptors other than those explicitely targeted .",
    "this model shows that multivalent particles are more sensitive to non - specific binding compared to monovalent ones , and their selectivity rapidly deteriorates in presence of different receptors types , introducing potential problems in their practical application as drug - delivery agents and biomarkers . to solve this problem ,",
    "a design principle is proposed , termed `` self - protection '' : beside the targeting ligands , nanoparticles should also be coated with protecting receptors able to bind them , shielding their interactions with untargeted receptors .",
    "this mechanism is shown to reduce non - specific adsorption , and to increase selectivity under broad conditions where typical nanoparticles would not work .",
    "+ the problem and the solution proposed here do not apply only to nanoparticles , or to targeting of cells .",
    "indeed , they naturally emerge in all scenarios where multivalent constructs are used , e.g. in ligand - functionalized polymers or surfaces that recognize specific biomarkers via multiple binding sites .                                                            the specialization of eqs.[eq : ste1],[eq : ste2 ] for the type of scenario presented in the main text is provided here .",
    "each binding site has @xmath46 targeted receptors and @xmath60 untargeted ones .",
    "ligands on a nanoparticle compete with each other to form a bond with the receptors , and vice - versa . since in the presented case",
    "ligands on a nanoparticle are equivalent , one can drop the subscript identifying them in eq.[eq : ste2 ] , e.g. @xmath61 . thus , the values of the single - bond energy are @xmath11 and @xmath12 for targeted and untargeted receptors , corresponding to bond strengths of @xmath62 and @xmath63 . in this case ,",
    "eq.[eq : ste1],[eq : ste2 ] for a typical nanoparticle ( i.e. one without protecting receptors coated on its surface ) with @xmath1 ligands adsorbed on a binding site is :      note that in the ideal case @xmath65 ( or @xmath66=0 ) . for a particle in the bulk",
    "no ligand or receptor has any partner to bind with , hence @xmath67 ( remember that @xmath68 is the probability that ligand / receptor @xmath69 is _",
    "un_bound ) , and @xmath70 . + for the `` protected '' architecture instead , considering nanoparticles with @xmath48 protecting receptors , with binding energy and bond strength @xmath49 and @xmath71 , respectively , the two sets of equations for the adsorbed and bulk case are :          respectively .",
    "note that in this latter case one has @xmath74 , but @xmath75 , giving @xmath76 .",
    "[ eq : specialized],[eq : specialized - mine],[eq : specialized - mine - bulk ] describe a set of non - linear , coupled equations which require a numerical solution .",
    "they can be shown to have a unique physical solution , which can be found by either a self - consistent procedure or as the solution of a minimization problem , see ref.@xcite for details .",
    "for all cases presented above , once the solution for @xmath77 and @xmath78 are obtained , eq.[eq : ste1 ] providing the free - energy due to bond formation ( see also eq.[eq : fads ] ) specializes to the expression :          it is useful to derive closed analytical expression for the partition function of the system ( and hence the adsorption free - energy ) within a mean - field description . in this case , each ligand _ independently _ see the receptors on the binding sites , and do not compete with each other for binding .",
    "note that in this way the mean - field model always over - estimate the contribution of the binding - free energy , since correlation effects limiting the combinatorial entropy of binding will not be captured .",
    "again , two cases will be dealt with , that of a typical architecture and the `` protected '' one proposed in this paper . for the first case ,",
    "one has :    @xmath82 - 1 = \\nonumber \\\\ & = ( 1 + { \\ensuremath{n_\\mathrm{t } } } { \\ensuremath{\\chi_\\mathrm{t}}}+ { \\ensuremath{n_\\mathrm{u } } } { \\ensuremath{\\chi_\\mathrm{u}}})^{{\\ensuremath{n_\\mathrm{l } } } } - 1 \\nonumber \\\\ &",
    "= ( 1 + { \\ensuremath{\\gamma_\\mathrm{t}}}+ { \\ensuremath{\\gamma_\\mathrm{u}}})^{{\\ensuremath{n_\\mathrm{l } } } } - 1 , \\label{eq : meanfield}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]        where @xmath84 is basically a compounded measure of the strength of the contribution by each receptor type @xcite .",
    "+ eqs  [ eq : meanfield ] and [ eq : mine - mean ] well explain some of the observed trends arising from the more complex description . the adsorption probability < @xmath13 > is a monotonically increasing function of @xmath17 , which exponentially increases with the number of ligands .",
    "moreover , compared to monovalent nanoparticles where the effect of untargeted receptor is linear in both their number and the bond strength , for multivalent particles the dipendence is super - linear , with an exponent equal to the number of interacting ligands .",
    "these features explain the higher sensitivity to untargeted receptors of multivalent nanoparticles compared to monovalent ones , hence the more rapid deterioration of the adsorption behaviour from the ideal one .",
    "+ comparing eq .",
    "[ eq : meanfield ] to [ eq : mine - mean ] can also help understand the working principle of the self - protected architecture .",
    "the denominator in eq .",
    "[ eq : mine - mean ] , the unbound partition function , is exactly what one obtains when only bonds between ligands and protecting receptors are present . in the self - protected architecture , all contributions to binding are simply rescaled by this number ,",
    "contrary to the typical nanoparticle case described by eq .",
    "[ eq : meanfield ] where the rescaling factor is simply one .",
    "this means that contributions from both targeted and untargeted receptors will be important only if they are large compared to those from protecting receptors .",
    "hence , as long as protecting bonds are stronger than those with untargeted receptors , but still weaker or comparable to the targeted ones , only presence of the latter will produce a valuable contribution to binding .",
    "clearly , this also depends on their number and not only on the bond strength , as evident by the definition of @xmath85 above .",
    "+ this mean - field model also clarifies another key difference between the classical and protected architecture . due to its langmuir form",
    ", appreciable adsorption is achieved under the condition @xmath86 .",
    "inverting this equation , one can find the number of targeted receptors @xmath87around which maximum super - selective targeting can be achieved : @xmath88 \\label{eq : nswitch1}\\ ] ] for the classical architecture and @xmath89 \\label{eq : nswitch2}\\ ] ] for the self - protected one .",
    "a couple of important features can be explained in this way .",
    "first , eq.[eq : nswitch1 ] shows that for a typical architecture with no protecting receptors one can obtain appreciable adsorption even when no targeted receptors are present ( i.e. @xmath90 ) . in practice , nanoparticles would not distinguish between their intended target and a completely different one to which they should not adsorb .",
    "for the protected architecture instead , one can always tune @xmath71 , to obtain highly selective adsorption only above a specific value of @xmath91 , which can be set to correspond to the specific value required for applications ."
