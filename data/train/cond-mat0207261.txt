    "the discovery of bose - einstein condensation in trapped alkali - metal gases at ultra - low temperature @xcite has developed a huge amount of experimental and theoretical investigations .",
    "the experimental conditions are such that the atomic gas is at very low density and that the interactions can be parametrized in terms of a scattering length @xmath2 .",
    "in this situation a mean - field description through the gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) @xcite is able to give , at least at low temperature , a precise description of the atomic condensates and their dynamics @xcite .",
    "one important question concerns the superfluid character of the bose condensates . among other properties ,",
    "the existence of quantum vortices is a signal of the superfluidity .",
    "the possibility of trapped quantized vortices was one of the primary motivations of the gp theory @xcite and some amount of theoretical work about this topic has been developed during the last years @xcite .",
    "the experimental evidence of such quantized vortices has recently been verified @xcite .    since the number @xmath3 of atoms involved in the condensate is generally large , it is natural to think that the thomas - fermi ( tf ) approach can be applied extensively in some aspects of the bose - einstein condensation in traps .",
    "this tf limit is usually identified with the limit of number of atoms @xmath3 going to infinity rather than to be interpreted as the @xmath0 limit as it happens in the case of fermi statistics .",
    "recently , the tf approximation for the ground state of bose - einstein condensates of magnetically trapped atoms has been discussed as the @xmath0 limit @xcite . from this point of view the tf kinetic energy , which is dropped in the @xmath1 limit of the ground - state calculation ,",
    "can be obtained for any number of particles . in this @xmath0 limit , a good agreement between the gp and tf kinetic energies is found even for low and intermediate number of particles . with the interpretation of the tf approach as the @xmath0 limit , it is also possible to perform semiclassical tf calculations for the ground state of bose - einstein condensates of atoms with negative scattering length ( @xmath4li atoms ) and to compute the excitation energy of collective monopole and quadrupole oscillations where the kinetic energy of the ground state of the condensate plays a crucial role @xcite .",
    "the tf limit considered as @xmath1 limit has also been applied to the description of vortex states @xcite . in this case",
    "it is assumed that the radial and axial kinetic energies can be neglected , and only the rotational kinetic energy is retained @xcite .",
    "this approximation , however , gives a bad description of the vortex - core region .",
    "a better description of this region in the limit of large @xmath3 can be achieved by splitting the condensate wave function into a product of a slowly - varying envelope , which is obtained by completely neglecting the kinetic energy , times the solution of the gpe describing a vortex in homogenous matter @xcite .",
    "in contrast to these large-@xmath3 methods , in this paper , we will again consider the tf approximation as the @xmath0 limit in order to describe the vortex state semiclassically .",
    "in addition to the formal aspects , this approach has the practical advantages mentioned above , i.e. , that one can calculate the kinetic energy , that it can therefore be used also in the attractive case , and that it works well also in the case of relatively few particles .    the experimental and theoretical achievements in bose - einstein condensation have also triggered the investigation of trapped fermi gases at very low temperatures @xcite .",
    "one of the most important goals of the experiments is to reach the bcs transition to the superfluid phase , associated with the appearance of a macroscopic order parameter of strongly correlated cooper pairs in dilute gases of trapped fermionic atoms .",
    "several theoretical studies about this topic have recently been developed @xcite . in the case where the critical temperature is much higher than the spacing between the levels in the trap",
    ", the macroscopic order parameter can be obtained through the ginzburg - landau equation ( gle ) @xcite , which is formally equivalent to the gpe . in a recent publication @xcite",
    "also vortex states were discussed within the framework of the gle . as a second application of our tf approach",
    "we will briefly discuss vortex states in a superfluid gas of trapped fermionic atoms . due to the analogy between the gpe and the gle our semiclassical approach",
    "can immediately be transferred to this problem .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the second section we establish the tf theory projected on states of defined @xmath5 component of the angular momentum and apply it to describe vortex states of a non - interacting bose condensate . in the third section we include the interaction among the atoms in the trap and compare our semiclassical prediction with the results obtained from the quantal solution of the gpe for several typical examples .",
    "the fourth section is devoted to the discussion of vortex states in superfluid trapped fermi systems .",
    "our conclusions are laid out in the last section .",
    "we start by considering states having a vortex line along the @xmath5 axis and all the atoms flowing around it with quantized circulation .",
    "the order parameter can be written in the form @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath5 are the radial and axial coordinates , @xmath8 is the angle around the @xmath5-axis , @xmath9 is an integer , and @xmath10 , @xmath11 being the density .",

    "it should be remembered that the tf densities must be considered in the sense of distributions @xcite [ see e.g. the step function in eq .",
    "( [ rhokappa ] ) ] and , therefore , they only make sense when used under integrals to calculate expectation values of `` slowly varying '' operators .",
    "in fact , the @xmath32 corrections to the density ( not considered here ) still deviate much more strongly from the true quantal densities , since they contain a square - root singularity at the classical turning point .",

    "it is easy to see that with the ho potential the argument of the bessel function entering in the density can not become large : @xmath58 for example , in the case @xmath51 the argument becomes at most @xmath59 , and already the first four terms of the expansion ( [ besselseries ] ) give an accuracy better than @xmath60 . in the case",

    "the first one , known as the tf limit in the literature and discussed , e.g. , in refs .",
    "@xcite , is obtained by dropping the kinetic energy part @xmath83 coming from the radial and axial motion and retaining only the rotational part @xmath84 of the total kinetic energy , i.e. , only derivatives with respect to @xmath8 in eq .",

    "the chemical potential @xmath43 is obtained through the particle - number condition .",
    "the formula ( [ rhorokhsar ] ) has the advantage that it represents an analytic expression for @xmath88 , but it is clear that the result @xmath89 inside a vortex core with radius @xmath86 is not realistic . we will call hitherto formula ( [ rhorokhsar ] ) the @xmath1 tf limit .",
    "the second approximation method , known as the `` method of matched asymptotics '' ( ma ) , was introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite to describe the dynamics of vortices , and used in ref .",
    "@xcite to calculate the energy of a static vortex .",
    "we will follow here the simplified derivation for the case of a straight vortex given in ref .",
    "first let us briefly review the description of a vortex state in a system with @xmath90 . in this case",

    "( [ rhorokhsar ] ) is not valid for @xmath107 , i.e. , inside the vortex core .",
    "another difference between eq .",
    "( [ philocal ] ) and eq .",

    "a detailed comparison shows that the ( @xmath0 ) tf theory systematically overestimates the rotational part and underestimates the axial and radial parts of the kinetic energy , the latter even becoming negative for very large numbers of particles , although the total kinetic energy remains always positive .",

    "it should be mentioned that within the improved ( matched asymptotics ) @xmath1 approximation [ eq .",

    "however , this method has nothing to do with the semiclassical asymptotic @xmath32 expansion considered here .",
    "finally it should also be pointed out that our tf limit is able to deal with vortices in the attractive case ( negative scattering length ) . in this case",
    "the kinetic energy is crucial and the large-@xmath3 limit is not well - defined .",
    "the same is true for the description of the ground state ( i.e. , no vortex ) , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite . there",
    "the @xmath0 approach has been used in the repulsive as well as in the attractive case , whereas the @xmath1 approximations ( the so - called @xmath1 tf limit as well as the method of matched asymptotics ) can be applied only in the repulsive case .",
    "in this section we will describe how our tf approach can also be used for the description of vortices in superfluid fermionic systems .",
    "this is possible since at least for a certain range of temperatures , the so - called ginzburg - landau regime , the order parameter @xmath134 is described by an equation which has exactly the same form as the gpe ( [ gpe ] ) . as derived in ref .",
    "@xcite , for temperatures @xmath135 near the critical temperature @xmath136 and for low trapping frequencies @xmath17 ( @xmath137 ) the ginzburg - landau equation ( gle ) reads @xmath138\\delta(\\vec{r})\\\\   + \\frac{7\\zeta(3)}{8\\pi^2}\\left|\\frac{\\delta(\\vec{r})}{k_b t}\\right|^2     \\delta(\\vec{r } ) = 0\\ , , \\label{gle}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] with the definitions @xmath139 , @xmath140 , and @xmath141 , where @xmath142 denotes the local fermi momentum at the center of the trap .",

    "however , there is one important difference between the gpe describing the bose - einstein condensate and the gle describing the order parameter @xmath134 of a superfluid fermi system . in a bose - einstein condensate , the particle number @xmath3 , i.e. , the norm of @xmath152 , is fixed , and the chemical potential @xmath153 has to be determined from the gpe ( [ gpehounits ] ) . for the gle",
    "the situation is reversed : the chemical potential @xmath153 is fixed by the temperature @xmath135 and other parameters [ eq . ( [ defmutilde ] ) ] , whereas the normalization of @xmath152 , i.e. , the magnitude of the gap @xmath154 , has to be determined from eq .",

    "however , as in our discussion of vortex states in bose - einstein condensates , we will consider the spherical case , in which the maximum temperature for the existence of vortex states is determined by @xmath159 .    since the gle is identical with the gpe , it is obvious that our tf approach described in the previous sections",
    "can immediately be applied also to the gle .",
    "only the iteration procedure for the self - consistent solution is somewhat different , since now @xmath153 is given instead of @xmath3 .",

    "this is the reason for the rather small normalizations of the order parameter and results in a shape of the order parameter as a function of @xmath191 which resembles very much the shape of a non - interacting ho wave function . under these conditions",
    "it is clear that the @xmath1 limit can not be used as an approximate solution of the gle , as has also been noted in ref .",
    "using the semiclassical thomas - fermi approximation understood as @xmath0 limit rather than @xmath1 limit , we have studied the vortex states of a bose condensate of atoms confined in a spherical magnetic trap .",

    "the small thomas - fermi kinetic energy , obtained in our approach , is smaller than the quantal kinetic energy , which , for large number of particles , is also dominated by quantal corrections as it happens for the ground state @xcite .",
    "the vortex state density profiles obtained in our thomas - fermi approximation reproduce quite well the quantal ones , especially for a very large number of particles . however , inside the vortex core our thomas - fermi densities are too high . also near the classical turning point",
    "our tf densities locally fail because at this point the density is completely dominated by quantal contributions which are non - analytical in @xmath32 and which can not be reproduced by semiclassical approximations of the tf type .",
    "however , it shall be kept in mind that the semiclassical density has to be understood as distribution very efficient for describing expectation values rather than local quantities such as the density profile . in this sense",
    "we see that the quantities presented in table [ table1 ] are much more accurate than one would expect from an inspection of the local densities shown in figs .",
    "[ figphirb2]-[figphirb6 ] .",
    "the approach is also well suited for the description of vortex states of superfluid trapped fermionic systems in the gl regime , where the various approximations developed for large @xmath3 can not be used at all .",

    "however , the kinetic energy has also another contribution @xmath200 due to the finite size of the trapped system .",
    "since outside the vortex core the shape of the condensate is almost not changed , we assume that for this contribution the relation derived in ref .",
