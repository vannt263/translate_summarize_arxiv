    "it has been suggested many years ago @xcite , that baryons and mesons contain fractionally charged fermions - constituent quarks . according to dirac equation , magnetic moment of charged particles with spin @xmath7 is @xmath8=@xmath9 , and therefore , constituent quarks should have magnetic moments . for baryons",
    "this concept works surprisingly well , and measured magnetic moments of hyperons @xmath10 , proton and neutron , can be understood as originating from the magnetic moments @xmath11=1.85@xmath12 , @xmath13=-0.97@xmath12 , @xmath14=-0.61@xmath12 of quarks with constituent masses @xmath15@xmath16 330mev and @xmath17=510mev .    consequently , open - flavor vector mesons should also have magnetic moments .",
    "for example , @xmath18 meson ( bound state of @xmath19 quarks with parallel spins ) may be expected to have magnetic moment @xmath20 ( here @xmath12=3.1@xmath2110@xmath22mev / t ) .",
    "the response of pseudoscalar mesons and scalar diquarks to external magnetic fields can be understood using the analogy of @xmath23 bound states with muonium ( @xmath24 ) and positronium ( @xmath25 ) . similarly to singlet ( @xmath1=0 ) ground state of positronium or muonium , mesons @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 should have zero magnetic moment @xcite . in the magnetic field however , due to magnetic polarizability of pseudoscalar mesons , induced magnetic moment @xmath33 $ ] is expected to appear @xcite , due to partial polarization of @xmath34 pair in @xmath1=0 quantum state . if the analogy with positronium behavior @xcite is indeed correct , wave function @xmath35 of ( @xmath36=0 ) substate of vector mesons can acquire the admixture of pseudoscalar state @xmath37 in the magnetic field , and quenching @xcite of @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 meson decays may occur @xcite in static external fields @xmath41 t",
    ".    internal spin structure of scalar diquarks @xcite in @xmath0-type baryons resembles quantum state of pseudoscalar mesons : @xmath37 . in strong magnetic field , a superposition of ( @xmath1=0 ) diquark with its excited state ( @xmath1=1 , @xmath36=0 ) can take place . in this contribution",
    "we discuss the magnetic polarizability of diquarks in baryons due to fields @xmath42-@xmath43 t .",
    "r55 mm     internal spin structure of @xmath44 baryon differs from that of proton , neutron and other spin 1/2 hyperons@xcite .",
    "typical @xmath7 baryon contains two quarks ( diquark ) in ( @xmath1=1 ) triplet state accompanied with the third quark , as described by naive @xmath45 function @xmath46 in eq.(1 ) .",
    "one may directly guess that ground state wave function of proton ( @xmath47 ) is similar to @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) , since both they contain quarks ( @xmath50 ) accompanied by third @xmath51 or @xmath52 quark .",
    "almost equal masses of @xmath53 hyperons then suggest , that their constituent quantum spin structure is similar , ( given by @xmath46 ) as in the case of proton and neutron .",
    "@xmath54    however , constituent quarks ( @xmath55 ) of @xmath56 hyperon can enter a lower - energy quantum state @xmath57 , with different configuration of quark spins .",
    "such state is observed experimentally as @xmath58(1116 ) .",
    "mass difference ( @xmath59=77mev ) between @xmath60 and @xmath61 baryon comes from different interaction energy of constituent quark color - magnetic moments .",
    "quantum structure of @xmath61 hyperon thus contains scalar ( @xmath1=0 ) diquark accompanied with the third quark , which is then responsible for the spin of such baryon .",
    "a question , which quarks enter the scalar ( @xmath1=0 ) diquark state in flavor - degenerate baryons of type @xmath62 , @xmath63 or @xmath64 has been discussed already by franklin et al . @xcite .",
    "the conclusion was that two quarks with similar masses form a scalar diquark state , with small admixture of other diquark flavor configurations . for @xmath65",
    "this means that scalar diquark ( @xmath2 ) is accompanied with heavier @xmath52 , @xmath66 or @xmath67 quark .",
    "if all three constituent quark spins are oriented in parallel , baryon has spin @xmath52=3/2 , which corresponds to experimentally observed @xmath68 hyperon and @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 resonances .",
    "spin wave function @xmath72 of such baryons is shown eq.([eq1 ] ) .",
    "within the framework of mit bag model @xcite , constituent quarks are bound together in a small ( @xmath73fm ) volume , which contains strong gluon fields and also virtual partons .",
    "constituent quarks are the source of magnetic dipole and electric fields , which are not screened by the external vacuum . in a simplified picture of @xmath61 hyperon as purely ( @xmath2)-@xmath52 state , the measured magnetic moment @xmath74 is to be generated by @xmath52-quark : @xmath75 , because diquarks in quantum state @xmath76 ( as well as pseudoscalar mesons ) should have zero magnetic moment .",
    "however , the above said is not completely true . magnetic dipole field lines , which constitute the dipole field of @xmath61 hyperon are contained in ( penetrating ) the `` bag '' volume of baryon ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "therefore , scalar ( @xmath2 ) diquark state , described by the spin wave function @xmath77 can be altered in the magnetic field , and achieve ( due to its magnetic polarizability ) an induced magnetic moment @xmath33 $ ] , as discussed for the @xmath78-meson case in @xcite . in such picture",
    ", virtual quark - antiquark pairs and scalar diquarks are swimming in a deconfined qcd medium ( the `` bag '' ) containing also gluons and strong magnetic field .",
    "let us estimate the strength of hyperfine magnetic field inside baryons : since the source of the magnetic dipole field is localized inside the hadronic `` bag '' volume , we shall assume , that dipole magnetic moment @xmath8=@xmath79 of baryon comes from the fictious current loop of radius @xmath80=@xmath81[@xmath82 m ] ( for proton @xmath83=2.79 , for @xmath0 hyperon @xmath83=@xmath840.61 ) .",
    "one has @xmath85 using @xmath86 j / t .",
    "magnetic field @xmath87 at the center of such current loop is @xmath88 if magnetic permeability @xmath89na@xmath90 of vacuum is used . for @xmath61 hyperon",
    "we then obtain internal magnetic field @xmath91 t ( assuming @xmath81=0.67 [ fm ] ) , and for proton @xmath92 tesla , assuming fictious current loop radius @xmath93 [ fm ] .",
    "external and intrinsic magnetic field of baryons can influence quantum state of scalar diquarks via interaction term : @xmath94=@xmath95 . similarly to the case of positronium and muonium , spin - singlet state @xmath96 $ ] becomes a quantum superposition of triplet and singlet states @xcite , and induced magnetic moment @xcite of scalar ( @xmath2 ) diquark appears @xmath97 = \\frac{c_\\alpha - s_\\alpha}{\\sqrt{2 } } | \\uparrow \\downarrow \\rangle   -   \\frac{c_\\alpha+s_\\alpha}{\\sqrt{2}}| \\downarrow\\uparrow \\rangle ; \\qquad \\langle \\tilde \\varpsi^s |\\hat{\\mu } |\\,\\tilde\\varpsi^s \\rangle =   ( |\\mu_{u}|\\!+\\!|\\mu_{d}| ) \\sin(2\\alpha ) = \\delta\\mu \\label{eq4}\\ ] ] where @xmath98 , @xmath99 , and @xmath100 depends on magnetic field @xmath32 via parameter @xmath101 .",
    "hyperfine splitting @xmath102 is @xmath103 = 77mev for @xmath61 hyperon , and 166mev and 194mev for @xmath104 and @xmath105 hyperons . in the limit @xmath106 , @xmath107 , and scalar",
    "diquark becomes fully polarized @xmath108=@xmath109 in its ( @xmath1=0 ) state : quark magnetic moments become oriented along field @xmath110 direction , while their spins are anti - parallel . in such extreme case ,",
    "polarized quark distribution functions @xmath3 and @xmath4 of @xmath61 baryon are substantially affected .",
    "induced magnetic moment @xmath111 of scalar diquark should contribute to the magnetic moment of @xmath61 hyperon , as pointed out already by franklin et al.@xcite . in the limitting case @xmath112 .",
    "for our intrinsic magnetic field @xmath113 t in @xmath61 hyperon : @xmath114+@xmath115 and @xmath116 , which is 4% of @xmath117 . here , we did not take into account the full wave function @xmath46 of @xmath118 baryon ( see eq.[eq1 ] ) , which contains term @xmath119 with probability @xmath120 .",
    "magnetic polarizability of scalar ( @xmath121 ) and ( @xmath122 ) diquarks in @xmath123 hyperons originates from the same mechanism : the superposition of @xmath77 with @xmath124 triplet state of @xmath125 hyperons ( they correspond to @xmath126 ) . due to different quark magnetic moment orientation relative",
    "to quark spin in ( @xmath121 ) and ( @xmath122 ) diquarks , magnetic polarizability @xmath127 of ( @xmath122 ) diquark is expected to be much smaller compared to ( @xmath121 ) and ( @xmath2 ) diquarks ( see eq.10 and eq.11 in @xcite ) .",
    "the interaction of color - magnetic dipole moments of quarks induces additional hyperfine mixing @xcite of wave functions @xmath124 and @xmath77 , which is independent from purely electromagnetic effects we study here .",
    "similarly to virtual @xmath128 pairs , which contribute to anomalous magnetic moments of electron and muon , virtual ( @xmath5 ) pairs can influence nucleon properties .",

    "let us assume here , that intrinsic magnetic field @xmath130 t in nucleon affects quantum state of virtual ( @xmath5 ) pairs . inside the hadronic bag , without any external fields , virtual @xmath5 pairs would appear in pure @xmath1=@xmath131 singlet state @xmath132 , or in @xmath1=@xmath133 triplet state . due to its smaller energy , pseudoscalar configuration @xmath134",
    "should be more probable . if internal magnetic field @xmath135 t in nucleon modifies the wave function @xmath136 $ ] of scalar @xmath5 pairs as described by eq.([eq4 ] ) , induced magnetic moment of @xmath1=0 ( @xmath5 ) pairs appears : @xmath137 , which may contribute to the nucleon magnetic moment . at the same time , net polarization of virtual @xmath52 quarks occurs .",

    "our estimate of the intrinsic ( hyperfine ) magnetic field for @xmath61 hyperon is @xmath138 t .",
    "we suggest , that polarized quark distribution functions @xmath139 of @xmath61- type hyperons can be modified due to polarization of scalar ( @xmath2 ) diquark in strong electromagnetic field , which may be remotely related to emc effect .",
    "we also suggest , that virtual @xmath5 pairs in nucleon are effectively polarized due to the intrinsic magnetic field of nucleon @xmath130 t .",
