    "molecular aggregates are coupled clusters of small molecules with intermolecular separations typically close to individual molecule size , for example , the biological photosynthetic light harvesting system , the organic semiconductor crystal or the solute dissolved in solvents .",
    "moreover , the ability of converting solar light into electrical or chemical energy in these systems through photosynthesis or photoelectric conversions motivates the study of the electronic excited states of molecular aggregates .",
    "however , the theoretical characterization of these properties is often challenging to unravel due to their relatively large scales and complicated environments . among the current popular quantum chemical methods for calculating electronic excited states , time - dependent density functional theory ( tddft )",
    "is mostly widely used due to the good balance between the accuracy and computational cost @xcite .",
    "it is well known that standard approximate exchange - correlation functionals used in dft or tddft will underestimate the excitation energies for rydberg states and charge - transfer states as well as extended @xmath0-conjugated systems and weakly interacting molecular aggregates .",
    "such drawbacks are due to the fact that those functionals do not exhibit the correct @xmath1 asymptotic behavior and can not capture long - range correlation effects .",
    "recent efforts have offered possibilities to account for long - range corrections and dispersion effects by the newly developed exchange - correlation functionals with long - range corrections @xcite and/or dispersion corrections @xcite .",
    "however , the applicable system size for excited state quantum chemistry calculation is still limited to a few hundred atoms at the most . since the @xmath2 scaling ( n is the size of system ) of the tddft @xcite , the application of tddft to very large systems is still challenging .    in order to reduce the computational scaling in tddft ,",
    "many theoretical approaches @xcite based on the local correlation approximation have been suggested .",
    "chen and co - workers @xcite developed a linear - scaling time - dependent density functional theory ( tddft ) algorithm using the localized density matrix ( ldm ) and in an orthogonal atomic orbital ( oao ) representation .",
    "yang and co - workers @xcite extended this formalism and suggested reformulating tddft based on the non - orthogonal localized molecular orbitals ( nolmos ) @xcite .",
    "casida and wesolowski proposed the tddft within the frozen - density embedding ( fde ) framework @xcite , and neugebauer and co - workers extended this approach with coupled electronic transtions @xcite and made applications of this approach to many interesting systems @xcite like light - harvesting complexes in biomolecular assemblies @xcite .",
    "recently , based on the fragment lmos that derived from capped fragments , liu and co - workers @xcite suggested a new linear - scaling tddft method and successfully applied it to several large conjugated systems .    considering the weak interactions between the molecular units , using a  divide and conquer \" idea to treat the excited states of the aggregated systems may be a worthwhile attempt @xcite . in the fragment",
    "molecular orbital ( fmo ) method proposed by kitaura and fedorov @xcite , the whole system can be divided into small fragments , and the total properties can be well estimated by the corresponding monomers , dimers , etc .",
    "recently , using the fmo scheme , fmox - tddft @xcite ( x means n - body expansion ) with analytic gradients have been developed and can give good descriptions for solvated and bio - chemical systems .",
    "mata and stoll @xcite also developed an improved incremental correlation approach for describing the excitation energies , with the inclusion of a dominant natural transition orbitals into selected excited fragment .",
    "however , these methods may lose efficiency when dealing with general systems which have multiple or uncertain excited regions .    for general systems",
    ", the frenkel exciton model @xcite may be used as an alternative subsystem strategy and this model has been first applied to molecular crystals and subsequently extended to aggregates @xcite . in its original form ,",
    "the frenkel exciton hamiltonian describes a weakly interacting ensemble of two - level systems by @xmath3 where indices _ i _ and _ j _ label  blocks \" ( molecules ) , @xmath4 @xmath5 are the creation ( annihilation ) operators of an excitation on block @xmath6 , @xmath7 is the excited - state transition energy of block @xmath6 , and @xmath8 is the interaction , or coupling , between blocks @xmath6 and @xmath9 . the direct product of eigenstates of isolated blocks forms a convenient basis set for the global excited states .",
    "however , the non - diagonal couplings ( @xmath8 ) between different blocks , if calculated within the truncated hilbert space directly , involve only the electrostatic interactions , and the description of excited states with such an approximation will fail for the systems in which the quantum dispersions dominate the inter - molecular interactions .",
    "improvements have also been proposed through empirical corrections or exchange - correlation potentials @xcite .    in the recent years , the contractor renormalization group ( core )",
    "method @xcite and also the real - space renormalization group with effective interactions ( rsrg - ei ) @xcite provided a novel kind of subsystem methods for describing excited states of large systems , in which the general excited state is assumed to be an assembly of various block excitations ( both single block excitations and multiple block excitations ) , and the interactions between adjoined blocks are taken into account through bloch s effective hamiltonian theory @xcite .",
    "the basis set used in core or rsrg - ei is similar to that of frenkel exciton model , but the non - diagonal coupling terms in core or rsrg - ei include not only the electrostatic interactions but also the quantum exchange contributions through the super - block calculation and the followed projection of the super - block wave - function onto the blocks direct product basis , in contrast with those in traditional frenkel exciton models which involve only the electrostatic interactions . in 2005 ,",
    "malrieu and co - workers @xcite made the further simplification , approximating the excited states of the whole system as only the linear combination of various single block excitations , and proposed it as the renormalized excitonic method ( rem ) .",
    "recently , we and our co - workers @xcite applied the rem into _ ab initio _ quantum chemistry and successfully combined it with various _ ab initio _ methods like full configuration interaction ( fci ) , configuration interaction singlet ( cis ) , and symmetry adapted cluster configuration interaction ( sac - ci ) .",
    "good descriptions for excited states and ionized states of hydrogen chains and polyenes as well as polysilenes with economic computational costs have been achieved with both orthogonal localized molecular orbitals ( olmos ) and block canonical molecular orbitals ( bcmos ) @xcite .    in this paper , we combine rem with tddft and extend the rem calculated systems from the linear molecule to various molecular aggregates .",
    "testing systems include hydrogen - bonded h@xmath10o molecular chains , ring crystals like vdw interacted h@xmath10o rings and @xmath0-@xmath0 stacked c@xmath10h@xmath11 rings , 2-d benzene aggregates , as well as aqueous systems with polar and non - polar solutes .",
    "the rem - tddft wavefunction as well as the basis set and functional factors are also discussed .",
    "the structure of this paper is designed as : in sec .",
    "ii , technical details of the method are introduced ; in sec iii , we present calculated results of various molecular aggregates using rem - tddft and make comparisons with standard tddft calculations ; and finally , we summarize and conclude our results in sec .",
    "the rem method is a type of fragment - based method . in rem",

    ", we gave a detailed description of constructing rem hamiltonian with bcmos .",
    "under bcmos , the orthogonality only exists in the intra - blocks orbitals but not in the inter - blocks orbitals , and we used an approximate projector ( _ p_@xmath12 ) to unravel the non - orthogonality situation @xcite .",
    "since this strategy is universal , we can use the subsystems kohn - sham molecular orbitals ( ks - mos ) instead of the bcmos , and here we briefly introduce our rem - tddft strategy as below ( up to 2-body interactions ) . for more details about the method , we refer the readers to our previous work @xcite .",
    "\\1 ) calculate each block - monomer by tddft to get ks - mos , as well as the eigenstates for ground state ( @xmath13 ) and an excited state ( @xmath14 ) . in our rem - tddft strategy",
    ", we assume the @xmath13 state is closed - shell ground state , and @xmath14 state is constructed by the excitation components in tddft .",
    "then the basis functions ( @xmath15 ) of the model space are formed by @xmath16 is the total number of block monomers and the @xmath17 , @xmath18 means the @xmath17-th , @xmath18-th block - monomer , respectively . the corresponding projector ( _ p_@xmath12 ) by @xmath19 ( s_m^{-1})_{ii ' } \\sum_{i'=1}^{n } [ \\langle\\psi_{i'}^{*}|\\prod_{j'\\neq i'}\\langle\\psi_{j'}^{0}| ]   \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is the overlap matrix between model space basis functions .",
    "here we should mention that the antisymmetric property is satisfied in this product basis ( eq .  [ m8 ] ) .",
    "although the mos ( or the electron density ) of each monomer is totally localized on its own , quantum mechanics ( qm ) calculations of the dimers ( or trimer , etc . ) can redistribute the electron density @xcite , which is crucial to discribe the charge transfer type excitation . owing to the multi - mer s contribution",

    "[ fig - hij ] .",
    "it could be found that the construction of @xmath34 is under the whole rem bases while only two lowest excited states energies @xmath35 and @xmath36 are used , then the @xmath34 will be a @xmath37 matrix . when turn to @xmath38 ) , the @xmath39 and @xmath40 are used instead of @xmath35 and @xmath36 , and the dimension is also @xmath37 .    ]",

    "additional step should be applied to subtract the ground state energy with 2-body expansion ( @xmath45 ) , where @xmath46 since the dimension of the @xmath47 is equivalent to the number of rem basis , which is usually less than one thousand , the jacobi method can be used to diagonalize the @xmath47 of the whole system .",
    "we use our own code to implement the rem strategy .",
    "the preliminary tddft calculations on various blocks are implemented by gaussian@xcite or gamess@xcite . in the 1-d h@xmath10o chains systems",
    ", we use gaussian09 to do the subsystem tddft calculations on the monomers and dimers . in this test , both of the adjacent and",
    "the separate dimers are considered . in the other systems , if no extra illustration , the modified fmo subroutine in the gamess package is used to automatically select dimers and do the subsystem calculations . in our calculations the electrostatic potential ( esp ) terms @xcite and other correction terms are currently not considered , meaning only the original tddft calculations are implemented .",

    "in this paper , we extend the _ ab initio _ rem method to tddft theory and use this approach to calculate electronic excitation energies of various molecular aggregates .",

    "such achievements provide a new promising sub - system methodology for future quantitative studies of large complicated systems such as supramolecules , condensed phase matters .",
    "test calculations for the one dimensional water molecule chains show that rem - tddft method is effective in reproducing the electronic excitation energies of low - lying excited states : the typical deviation is only about 0.030 ev in @xmath49 or @xmath50 states , and slight larger for higher excited states .",
    "the wave function analysis of rem - tddft also gives correct pictures of the excitation behavior in these systems .",
    "furthermore , we test the rem - tddft with different basis sets and also various exchange - correlation functionals .",
    "we find that the larger basis sets will only slightly affect the final results , but the dft functionals would significantly influence the stability and accuracy . here the long - range corrected functionals with appropriate basis sets are recommended for dealing with large molecular aggregates .",
    "the trial test on the 2-d structure like benzene aggregates are also implemented and satisfactory excitation energy accuracies are also observed for them . at last , we turn to two types of aqueous systems to examine our rem - tddft s performances for the solutions . with",
    "lc - blyp functional and 6 - 31+g * basis sets , our rem - tddft method can reproduce the standard tddft values quite well , for both of the aqueous systems with polar and non - polar solutes .",

    "<S> in this paper , we apply the recently developed _ ab initio _ renormalized excitonic method ( rem ) to the excitation energy calculations of various molecular aggregates , through the extension of rem to the time - dependent density functional theory ( tddft ) . tested molecular aggregate systems include one - dimensional hydrogen - bonded water chains , ring crystals with @xmath0-@xmath0 stacking or van - der waals interactions and the general aqueous systems with polar and non - polar solutes . </S>",
    "<S> the basis set factor as well as the effect of the exchange - correlation functionals are also investigated . </S>",
    "<S> the results indicate that the rem - tddft method with suitable basis set and exchange - correlation functionals can give good descriptions of excitation energies and excitation area for lowest electronic excitations in the molecular aggregate systems with economic computational costs . </S>",
    "<S> it s shown that the deviations of rem - tddft excitation energies from those by standard tddft are much less than 0.1 ev and the computational time can be reduced by one order .    </S>",
