    "in high energy physics , @xmath0 dimensional massless quantum electro - dynamics ( qed3 ) was studied as an interesting theoretical toy model to gain insight into dynamical symmetry breaking of @xmath3 dimension qed @xcite . in condensed matter systems , qed3 may appear as an effective low energy theory describing doped mott insulators @xcite .",
    "the connection of dynamical mass generation in qed3 with anti - ferromagnets was also discussed in @xcite .",
    "qed3 with possible chern - simon term may also describe fractional quantum hall ( fqh ) transitions @xcite .    in the two component notations",
    "suitable for describing fqh transitions @xcite , the standard @xmath0 dimensional massless quantum electro - dynamics ( qed3 ) lagrangian in euclidean space is : @xmath4 where the dirac matrices in three dimensions are @xmath5 with @xmath6 being three pauli matrices @xcite and @xmath7 are @xmath1 species of dirac fermion .",
    "the conventional green function in qed3 is defined as : @xmath8    in momentum and real space , the fully - interacting green function in eqn.[non ] takes the form : @xmath9 where the convention we chose for the sign of the anomalous dimension @xmath10 is that a positive @xmath10 slows down the algebraic decay of the green function in real space , @xmath10 can be calculated by standard renormalization group ( rg ) by extracting uv divergences .",
    "unfortunately , this green function is not gauge invariant , @xmath10 depends on the fixed gauge in which the calculation is done .    the gauge invariant schwinger green function which is the focus of this paper is @xmath11 where the inserted dirac string makes the schwinger green function gauge invariant .",
    "@xmath12 depends on the the integral path @xmath13 from @xmath14 to @xmath15 . for simplicity reason ,",
    "we take @xmath16 to be a straight line .",
    "as far as i know , the importance of gauge - invariant green function in condensed matter system was first realized in fqh system @xcite . by a singular gauge transformation which attaches two flux quantums to each electron",
    ", an electron in an external magnetic field was mapped to a composite fermion in a reduced magnetic field . although transport properties which are directly related to two particle green functions can be directly studied in the composite fermion language , the tunneling density of states which is directly related to the single particle electron green function is much more difficult to study .",
    "in fact , the single particle electron green function is equal to the gauge - invariant green function of the composite fermion which was evaluated for non - relativistic fermions by phenomelogical arguments in ref.@xcite .",
    "most recently , the importance of gauge - invariant green function of fermion to angle resolved photo - emission ( arpes ) data in high temperature superconductors was discovered independently by rantner and wen ( rw ) @xcite and the author @xcite in different contexts . starting from @xmath17 gauge theory of doped mott insulators @xcite , rw discussed the relevance of this gauge - invariant green function to arpes data .",
    "they also pointed out that in temporal gauge , the equal - space gauge - invariant green function in eqn.[inv ] is equal to that of the conventional gauge dependent one in eqn.[non ] .",
    "furthermore , they calculated the anomalous dimension of the conventional green function in temporal gauge by large @xmath1 expansion .",
    "however , both the sign and magnitude of their result differs from that achieved in this paper . starting from a complementary ( or dual ) approach pioneered by balents _",
    "et al _ @xcite , the author studied how quantum @xcite or thermal @xcite fluctuations generated @xmath18 vortices can destroy @xmath19-wave superconductivity and evolve the system into underdoped regime at @xmath20 or pseudo - gap regime at finite @xmath21 .",
    "the author found that only in weakly type ii @xmath19-wave superconductors where the interaction between vortices is short - ranged , the effective low energy theory is described by qed3 . for underdoped cuprates which are between quantum anti - ferromagnet and strongly type ii @xmath19 wave superconductors ,",
    "the correct @xmath20 theory is still unknown .",
    "however , in the vortex plasma regime around the _ finite _ temperature kosterlize - thouless transition @xcite , the vortices can be treated by classical hydrodynamics . by anderson singular gauge transformation which attaches the flux from the classical vortex to the quasi - particles of @xmath19-wave superconductors @xcite , the quasi - particles ( spinons )",
    "are found to move in a random magnetic field generated by the classical vortex plasma @xcite .",
    "the electron spectral function @xmath22 is the product of the classical vortex correlation function and the _ gauge invariant _ green function of the spinon in the random magnetic field . obviously , this static gauge invariant green function is different from that calculated in this paper and will be investigated by completely different methods in separate publication @xcite .    in this paper , for _ pure _ theoretical interests , but with _ no _ application to high temperature superconductors in mind , we study the gauge - invariant fermion green functions eqn.[inv ] in large @xmath1 limit . by applying the methods developed to study clean @xcite and disordered @xcite fqh transitions and superconductors to insulator transitions",
    "@xcite , we study the gauge - dependent green function both in temporal gauge and in coulomb gauge . in both gauges ,",
    "we regularize the uv divergences in two different cut - offs . in both gauges ,",
    "we also run into expected ir singularities .",
    "we also make detailed comparisons between the natures of the ir singularities in these two gauges . in temporal gauge ,",
    "the infrared divergence is in the middle of the contour integral along the real axis . from physical prescription",
    ", it can be regularized by deforming the contour into complex plane , the anomalous dimension is found to be @xmath2 . from rw",
    "s observation that equal - space gauge invariant green function is the same as the equal space gauge dependent one in temporal gauge , we expect this anomalous dimension to be the same as that of gauge - invariant green function .",
    "however , in coulomb gauge , the infra - red divergence is at the two ends of the contour integral along the real axis , therefore un - regulariable , anomalous dimension is even not defined .",
    "this should not cause too much concern , because the anomalous dimension in coulomb gauge does not corresponds to any physical gauge - invariant quantity .",
    "this infra - red divergence can be shown to be canceled in any physical gauge invariant quantities such as @xmath23 function and correlation length exponent @xmath24 as observed in refs.@xcite .",
    "we also study the gauge - invariant green function directly by lorentz covariant calculation with different gauge - fixing parameters and find that the exponent is independent of the gauge fixing parameters and is exactly the same as that found in temporal gauge .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    ", we briefly review the previous work on gauge dependent green function in lorentz covariant landau gauge @xcite . in section iii , we calculate the gauge dependent green function in temporal gauge with two different cut - offs . in section iv",
    ", we discuss the gauge dependent green function in coulomb gauge also with two different cut - offs .",
    "we make detailed comparisons with the calculations done in temporal gauge . in section",
    "v , we calculate directly the gauge invariant green function in lorentz covariant gauge with different gauge fixing parameters .",
    "finally , we reach conclusions .",
    "in this section , we will briefly review the previous work on the gauge - dependent green eqn.[non ] in qed3 .",
    "there is nothing new in this section .",
    "but it is constructive to compare the calculations done in lorentz covariant gauge in this section with those done in temporal gauge in section iii and in coulomb gauge in section iv .",
    "it is also a useful first step for the lorentz covariant calculation of gauge - invariant green function eqn.[inv ] to be presented in sec .",
    "v.    integrating out @xmath1 pieces of fermions generates an additional dynamic quadratic term for the gauge field : @xmath25    to one - loop order : @xmath26    adding the non - local gauge fixing term and combining the original maxwell term in eqn.[qed ] with the generated dynamic gauge field terms in eq , [ gen ] , the propagator of the gauge field is @xcite :    @xmath27    in general , the ultra - violet ( uv ) @xmath28 behavior of this propagator is controlled by the original maxwell term @xmath29 , the infra - red ( ir ) one @xmath30 is dictated by the generated term @xmath31 . in this paper , we consider large @xmath1 limit , such that @xmath32 , so we neglect the original maxwell term .",
    "the above propagator becomes : @xmath33    in landau gauge @xmath34 , the one - loop fermion self - energy feymann diagram of the green function eqn.[non ] is given by :     the fermion self - energy diagram in landau gauge    the corresponding expression is @xmath35    by extracting uv divergence , we find the anomalous exponent @xmath36 .",
    "if we choose different gauge fixing parameter @xmath37 , we would get @xmath38 .",
    "@xmath10 is clearly gauge - dependent quantity and its physical meaning in any lorentz covariant gauges which includes landau gauge is not evident . in the following section",
    ", we will calculate @xmath10 in two lorentz non - covariant gauges : temporal gauge and coulomb gauge .",
    "as stated in the introduction , the main focus of this paper is the gauge - invariant green function eqn.[inv ] . in temporal gauge ,",
    "the equal - space gauge invariant green function is the same as the gauge dependent one @xcite .",
    "this can be seen easily as follows .    at equal space ,",
    "eqn.[inv ] becomes : @xmath39    in temporal gauge @xmath40 @xcite , the dirac string drops out , the equal - space gauge - invariant green function coincides with the equal - space conventional one : @xmath41    the strategy is to calculate the conventional green function in temporal gauge @xmath42 and then see what we can say about the gauge invariant green function . as shown in the last section , in lorentz covariant gauge eqn.[alpha ] , there is no ir divergences to worry about , we need only to regularize the uv divergence .",
    "however , in temporal gauge and coulomb gauge which break lorentz invariance , we run into both uv and ir divergences as expected .",
    "care is needed to regularize these plaguey ir divergences in a physical way .    with the notation @xmath43 ( namely @xmath44 is along @xmath45 direction ) , in @xmath40 gauge , we can invert eqn.[gen ] to find the propagator : @xmath46 where @xmath47 .",
    "the one - loop fermion self - energy feymann diagram is     the fermion self - energy diagram in temporal gauge    the corresponding expression is @xmath48    by using standard @xmath49 matrices algebra and suppressing the prefactor @xmath50 , we can simplify the above equation to : @xmath51    in the following , we will try to evaluate @xmath52 by two different cut - offs .",
    "we choose the external momentum @xmath54 to be along @xmath45 axis , namely @xmath55 , then in spherical coordinate system , the components of integral vector @xmath56 are : @xmath57 , the second term in eqn.[sim ] vanishes due to the @xmath58 integral .",
    "the logarithmic divergence of the first term becomes : @xmath59 where @xmath60 .",
    "the integral can be rewritten as : @xmath61    as expected , we run into ir divergence at @xmath62 @xcite which is in the middle point of the contour integral on the real axis from @xmath63 to @xmath64 .",
    "fortunately , by physical prescription , we can avoid the ir singularity at @xmath62 by deforming the contour as shown in fig.3     the contour path @xmath65 to bypass the ir singularity in temporal gauge    the divergent part in eqn.[div ] becomes :    @xmath66    putting back the prefactor @xmath50 , we get the final answer : @xmath67    we can identify the anomalous dimension as @xcite @xmath68    we expect this is the correct anomalous dimension of the gauge - invariant green function eqn.[inv ] . note that it has the _ same _ sign as that calculated in landau gauge .      in last subsection , we choose a cut - off @xmath70 in @xmath56 , in this subsection , we introduce a alternate cut - off @xmath71 only in momentum space @xmath72 , but integrate the frequency @xmath73 freely from @xmath74 to @xmath75 . the motivation to choose different cut - off ( or different renormalization scheme )",
    "is to check if the exponent eqn.[exp2 ] is universal .    by setting @xmath76 and extracting the logarithmic uv divergences",
    ", we find : @xmath77    it can be shown that the two coefficients in front of @xmath78 and @xmath79 are exactly the same as expected from lorentz invariance .",
    "regularizing the integral as depicted in fig.3 , we find that both are equal to :    @xmath80    putting back the prefactor @xmath50 , we get exactly the same anomalous dimension in eqn .",
    "this demonstrates that it is indeed a universal constant independent of renormalization scheme .",
    "in this section , we will first evaluate the conventional green function eqn.[non ] in coulomb gauge @xmath81 and speculate how to calculate the gauge invariant one eqn.[inv ] in this gauge . in fqh transitions as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , because the coulomb interaction between the fermions breaks lorentz invariance , lorentz invariant gauges are not convenient , coulomb gauge has to be employed to perform rg calculations . as in temporal gauge",
    ", we also run into ir divergence .",
    "however , in contrast to the green function in temporal gauge , the green function in coulomb gauge does not correspond to any gauge invariant quantity , the ir divergence may not be regulariable .",
    "this is indeed the case as stressed in ref.@xcite in fqh transitions contexts and as demonstrated in the following in qed3 context .    with the notations @xmath82 , in coulomb gauge , the propagators are @xmath83    the two fermion self - energy diagrams corresponding to the two propagators are     the fermion self - energy diagrams in coulomb gauge",
    "the expression for fig.4a is : @xmath84    the expression for fig.4b is : @xmath85    in the following , we will try to evaluate @xmath86 by two different cut - offs .",
    "we choose the external momentum @xmath54 along @xmath45 axis . adding the logarithmic divergences from eqn .",
    "[ coul1 ] and [ coul2 ] , we find : @xmath87    again , we run into ir divergences at @xmath88 which are at the two end points of the contour integral on the real axis from @xmath63 to @xmath64 .",
    "unfortunately , from physical perscription , we are unable to avoid the ir singularities at the two end points @xmath89 by deforming the contour .",
    "therefore , we are unable to identify the anomalous exponent .      in this subsection , we introduce cut - off @xmath90 only in momentum space @xmath72 , but integrate the frequency @xmath73 freely from @xmath74 to @xmath75 .",
    "extracting the logarithmic uv divergences , we find : @xmath91    it can be shown that the two coefficients in front of @xmath78 and @xmath79 are exactly the same as expected from lorentz invariance .",
    "however , in contrast to temporal gauge , the two coefficients differ from that in eqn.[ccut1 ] .",
    "this causes no disturbance , because the green function eqn.[non ] in coulomb gauge does not correspond to any physical quantities . as shown in the context of fqh transitions in ref .",
    "@xcite , this ir divergence disappears in physical quantities like @xmath23 function and critical exponents . by using the same method developed in ref.@xcite ,",
    "it is straightforward to show that the same phenomenum happens here in the context of qed3 @xcite .    in order to calculate the gauge - invariant green function eqn.[inv ] in coulomb gauge",
    ", we could extend the method developed in the following section for lorentz covariant gauge to coulomb gauge .",
    "we expect the ir divergencies in eqns .",
    "[ ccut1 ] , [ ccc ] to be cancelled by the inserted dirac string in the gauge - invariant green function .",
    "in this section , we will calculate the gauge invariant green function directly in lorentz covariant gauge eqn.[alpha ] without resorting to the gauge dependent green function .",
    "we will also compare with the result achieved in temporal gauge .",

    "we choose landau gauge @xmath102 in eqn.[alpha ] .",
    "extension to any gauge fixing parameter is straightforward and results will be given at the end of the section .",
    "integrating out @xmath101 in landau gauge leads to @xmath103    after we expand the total current in terms of the fermion current and the source current , the last integrand becomes @xmath104    the first term in eqn.[three ] is just the conventional long - range four - fermion interaction mediated by the gauge field , it leads to the anomalous exponent in landau gauge given in section ii : @xmath105    the second term is equal to : @xmath106 where @xmath107 and @xmath49 is the euler constant .",
    "the linear divergence is a arti - fact of the momentum cut - off and should be ignored in lorentz invariant regularization .",
    "the @xmath108 is a fast oscillating factor and averages to zero @xcite .",
    "the logarithmic factor leads to the anomalous exponent : @xmath109 which has the _ same _ sign as , but three times larger than @xmath110 .    we can write the third term as @xmath111    eqn .",
    "[ third ] is essentially quadratic in the fermions . combining it with the free fermion action leads to : @xmath112    in principal , the propagator of fermion @xmath113 can be calculated by inverting the quadratic form in the above equation , but it is not easy to carry out in practice .",
    "instead we can construct perturbative expansion in _ real space _ by the following feymann diagrams in fig.5     the perturbative expansion series of eq.[third ]    the corresponding expression is : @xmath114    being just quadratic , there is no loops in the above feymann series .",
    "but there may still be potential divergences .",
    "the explicit expression for fig.5b is @xmath115 where @xmath116 .    suppressing the prefactor @xmath117 , we can write eqn.[fx ] as the sum of two parts @xmath118 with @xmath119 and @xmath120    the logarithmic divergence in the first term in eqn.[fx1 ] cancels exactly that of eqn.[fx2 ] .",
    "the second term in eqn.[fx1 ] is convergent .",
    "so the only possible divergence may come from the third term in eqn.[fx1 ] : @xmath121    it is easy to find the uv divergences in the first term and second term in eqn.[x ] exactly cancel each other as follows : @xmath122    we conclude that there is no extra divergence from @xmath123 in eqn.[fx ] . to order @xmath124 , we have @xmath125    in all , the final anomalous exponent is @xmath126    this is exactly the same as that calculated in the temporal gauge .",
    "it is straightforward to repeat the above calculation by using different gauge fixing parameter @xmath37 in eqn.[alpha ] , then @xmath127 all depend on @xmath37 separately in the following way : @xmath128 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath129 disappears in the final answer @xmath130 .",
    "there are many @xmath131 corrections .",
    "@xmath110 has the standard correction , @xmath132 has the correction from the propagator in eqn.[alpha ] , @xmath133 has the correction from fig.5c and the new anomalous exponent @xmath134 has the correction from fig.6 which is the lowest order mixing diagram between the first term and the third term in eqn .",
    "[ three ] .",
    "the lowest order mixing between the first and the third term    although evaluating all these @xmath131 corrections is beyond the scope of this paper , we have established firmly our results eqn.[final ] to order @xmath124 .",
    "in this paper , we calculated the gauge - invariant fermion green function in @xmath0 dimensional qed by different methods .",
    "the calculations in temporal gauge with different cut - offs in section iii and lorentz covariant calculation with different gauge fixing parameters @xmath37 in section v all lead to the same answer .",
    "these facts strongly suggest eqn .",
    "[ exp2 ] is the correct exponent in the leading order of @xmath135 .",
    "these methods have been applied to many very different physical systems @xcite .",
    "finally , we would like to comment on the possible application of the results of this paper on high temperature superconductors . as explicitly demonstrated in refs .",
    "@xcite , in the vortex plasma regime in the neighborhood of the finite temperature phase transition boundary , the relevant gauge - invariant fermion green function is that of fermions moving in classical random magnetic field generated by the vortex plasma .",
    "obviously , this static gauge - invariant green function is expected to show rather different behaviors than the dynamic one calculated in this paper . for technical and simplicity reason",
    ", the dynamic gauge - invariant one was used in ref.@xcite to present the energy distribution curve ( edc ) and momentum distribution curve ( mdc ) of arpes data .",
    "we used the anomalous exponent calculated by rw which differs from our result eqn .",
    "[ exp2 ] both in sign and in magnitude .",
    "however , if correct anomalous exponent is used in the calculation in ref.@xcite is irrelevant anyway , because as cautioned at the end of ref.@xcite , the static gauge - invariant green function should be used to compare with experimental arpes data @xcite .",
    "note added in proof . after we achieved the results of this paper , we got to know the preprint cond - mat/0112202 by khveshchenko .",
    "he used very different methods and got the same anomalous exponent as mine eqn.[exp2 ] upto a factor of 2 .",
    "i suspect that the factor of 2 discrepancy may be due to he used 4 component spinors in contrast to the two component spinors used in this paper .",
    "four component spinor representation has the advantage to investigate dynamical parity - conserving mass generation as discussed in refs.@xcite .",
