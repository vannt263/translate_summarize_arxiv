    "the ability to manipulate small quantum systems individually is a necessary requirement for quantum computing and quantum communication .",
    "for example , in order to perform single - qubit operations on a particular ion in an ion trap quantum computer @xcite one has to focus a laser beam to the position of that ion with a sufficiently high spatial resolution @xcite .",
    "similarly , quantum communication protocols using atoms trapped inside optical cavities @xcite require single - bit and two - bit operations on specific atoms .",
    "one question that arises is whether strong focusing has an undesired side effect , namely , that the scattered light contains information about the state of the qubit .",
    "the fear would be that the laser intensity would have to be turned down so much , that the absence of a photon from the laser beam becomes _ in principle _ detectable .",
    "conversely , if an atom in free space would indeed be able to modify appreciably the state of a light field , then this effect could be used to our advantage : a single atom could be used to perform quantum - logic operations on single photons in free space @xcite .",
    "an atom inside an optical cavity strongly coupled to a cavity mode is known to be able to perform such tasks @xcite , but such an experiment would be more straightforward to conduct in free space .    at first sight",
    "the prospects of such an experiment seem good : the scattering cross section of a two - level atom is @xmath0 for light of wavelength @xmath1 @xcite , and thus focusing light down to an area @xmath2 should be sufficient to induce a strong coupling . however , this picture is too simplistic .",
    "light beams are transversely polarized , which implies that only part of the light entering the interaction region will carry the polarization that the atom is sensitive to . using a different picture , since the atom would emit a dipole pattern ( in a given @xmath3 transition ) , it would be most efficiently excited by a field matching an `` incoming '' dipole field , as follows from time - reversal symmetry . since a focused laser beam does not have a large overlap with such a dipole pattern , the effective absorption cross section is smaller than indicated by @xmath4 .",
    "early experiments @xcite on the detection of single atom fluorescence did not reach the strong focusing limit of @xmath5 .",
    "recently , however , impressive progress has been made in experiments on single molecules in condensed matter and efficient detection of the fluorescence light has become possible @xcite .",
    "experiments on single atoms aiming at the strong focusing limit are underway as well@xcite .    in a recent paper @xcite we gave the results of explicit calculations on the behavior of single atoms in free space irradiated by",
    "tightly focused light beams .",
    "we were particularly interested in the quantum aspects of the scattered light , and in evaluating how much a single atom is able to modify the intensity and phase properties of the incident light . here",
    "we present all the details of that calculation and discuss possible extensions .",
    "these results will be compared with similar calculations using ( i ) paraxial gaussian beams @xcite and ( ii ) a well - known quantum - optical input - output formalism that was used in refs .",
    "@xcite to study photon statistics and intensity correlations of the field emitted by an atom in free space .",
    "the latter model is basically a quasi one - dimensional model , with one spatial variable describing the propagation of the light beam , and with one additional parameter describing the solid angle subtended by the laser beam at the atom s position ( coinciding with the focal point of the light beam ) .",
    "as we will demonstrate , however , neither this model nor , as expected , paraxial beams accurately represent the case of a strongly focused light beam .",
    "here we wish to calculate the field that one obtains by focusing a monochromatic gaussian ( paraxial ) beam by an ideal strong lens .",
    "we do that by expanding the outgoing field ( i.e. the field after the lens ) in a complete set of modes . in principle",
    "one can use any complete set of modes to describe exact solutions of maxwell s equations . in view of the cylindrical symmetry of the problem we are interested in ,",
    "the most convenient is to choose a set that takes a simple form in cylindrical coordinates . in particular",
    ", we will use a set of eigenmodes of 4 commuting operators corresponding to the following 4 physical quantities : energy [ with eigenvalue @xmath6 per photon @xcite ] , angular momentum in the @xmath7 direction [ @xmath8 , momentum in the @xmath7 direction [ @xmath9 , and helicity [ @xmath10 . the modes are thus characterized by the 4 numbers @xmath11 , which , once the field has been quantized , play the role of quantum numbers .",
    "these modes were constructed in @xcite to clarify the meaning of orbital angular momentum of light @xcite , and thus by construction possess simple properties under rotations around the propagation ( @xmath7 ) direction .",
    "the complete orthogonal set of modes @xmath12 is defined such that the free electric field ( i.e. the solution of the source - free maxwell equations ) can be expanded in this set as @xmath13,\\ ] ] with arbitrary complex amplitudes @xmath14 .",
    "this requires the mode functions to be transverse , i.e. @xmath15 . the summation over @xmath16 is a short - hand notation for @xmath17 the dimensionless mode functions @xmath18 in cylindrical coordinates @xmath19 are defined by@xcite @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the transverse part of the wave vector , @xmath22 are the two circular polarization vectors , and @xmath23 with @xmath24 the @xmath25-th order bessel function .",
    "the mode functions satisfy the orthogonality relations @xmath26 where the integration extends over all space .",
    "this follows directly from the fact that the mode functions are eigenfunctions of commuting hermitian operators .    for the remainder of this section",
    ", we will consider only monochromatic beams with a fixed value of @xmath27 .",
    "for convenience we take @xmath28 as a mode number instead of @xmath29 and we denote the reduced set of mode numbers by @xmath30 , and introduce the notation @xmath31 for fixed @xmath32 the modes @xmath33 are orthogonal in planes @xmath34constant : @xmath35 which is a useful relation for defining the action on light beams of an ideal lens positioned in a plane @xmath7=constant .",
    "the action of the lens is modeled here by assuming that the field distribution of the incoming field is multiplied by a local phase factor @xmath36 with @xmath37 the focal length of the lens @xcite .",
    "an ideal parabolic lens would be represented by a phase factor @xmath38 . in the paraxial limit @xmath39",
    "this factor becomes equivalent to @xmath40 .",
    "it may be that the simple lens factor used here , @xmath40 , does not give rise to the strongest possible focusing , and that @xmath41 would improve on this . moreover , actual lens systems designed to focus light down to @xmath42 consist of _ multiple _ lenses ( for instance , 12 in ongoing experiments @xcite ) , partly to accommodate for the finite size , finite thickness and other imperfections of real lenses as compared to ideal lenses .",
    "we nevertheless for convenience chose a single lens factor @xmath40 : it allows for analytical evaluations and the class of light beams thus constructed does reach the focusing limit of @xmath43 ( for instance , see the plots corresponding to @xmath44 ) .",
    "this is sufficient for our purposes of showing that even focusing down to an area of the size of the atomic cross section does not quite ( by about a factor of @xmath45 ) lead to the strong effects one may have expected or hoped for .",
    "if in the plane of the lens , say @xmath46 , the incoming beam is given by @xmath47 then the output field is given by @xmath48 with @xmath49 this definition is such that the limit of @xmath50 corresponds to free - space propagation , as follows from the orthogonality relation ( [ plane ] ) .",
    "note that the field distribution ( [ out ] ) is an exact solution of maxwell s equations , irrespective of the choice for @xmath51 ( in particular , we can take the incoming beam to be paraxial ) .",
    "if we approximate the incoming beam by a circularly polarized ( lowest - order ) gaussian beam with rayleigh range @xmath52 with @xmath53 by its dimensionless amplitude @xmath54 then @xmath55 is given by @xmath56 this integral can be evaluated using @xmath57 and gives the result @xmath58 with @xmath59 the delta function @xmath60 expresses the fact that a lens can not absorb angular momentum from a cylindrically symmetric light beam upon normal incidence @xcite : the index @xmath25 of the outgoing beam is 1 , because the incoming beam has one unit of `` spin '' angular momentum .",
    "when the paraxial limit is valid for the _ outgoing _ beam , i.e. , when @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 correspond , as we will show , to the rayleigh range and the position of the focal plane of the outgoing beam , respectively . but also outside the paraxial limit , the focused light beam is characterized by the two parameters @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "the largest component of the output field ( [ out ] ) is the @xmath64 component , which is given by @xmath65 with @xmath66 .",
    "note here the similarity between ( [ exact ] ) and the expression given in @xcite for a class of light beams generalizing laguerre - gaussian ( lg ) beams @xcite .",
    "the @xmath67 and @xmath68 components of the output field are proportional to higher - order bessel functions , @xmath69 and @xmath70 , respectively , and will therefore vanish on the @xmath7 axis . as we will be interested in the interaction of an atom on axis with the focused light beams , we will not consider these components here , but they may be important in other circumstances .",
    "note as an aside that these two components represent beams with 1 and 2 units of orbital angular momentum , and 0 and @xmath71 units of spin angular momentum , respectively , so that the total angular momentum of the outgoing beam is indeed @xmath72 per photon .",
    "see @xcite for a discussion how these different forms of angular momentum are transferred to the internal and external angular momenta of an atom",
    ".    returning to the @xmath73 component , when the paraxial approximation is valid for the outgoing beam , we may take out a factor @xmath74 , use @xmath75 , and extend the integration limit in ( [ exact ] ) to infinity . defining @xmath76 these approximations lead to @xmath77 which , as announced , represents a gaussian beam with rayleigh range @xmath62 and its focal plane located at @xmath78 .",

    "furthermore , unlike in the paraxial approximation , the shape of the field is not just determined by the value of @xmath62 , but depends on @xmath63 as well .",
    "[ f2 ]    the plots of the transverse mode profiles show that beyond a certain point the width of the field no longer decreases with stronger focusing .",
    "one can not focus down a laser field to below a certain limit , roughly about half a wavelength , with the ideal lens with lens factor ( [ lens ] ) , no matter how small @xmath62 becomes .",
    "moreover , one notes the asymmetry of the outgoing beam around the focal plane , in contrast to a paraxial beam which is symmetric in its focal plane .",
    "since there is no a priori symmetry under reflections in the focal plane , this fact should not be surprising .",
    "[ f5 ]    let us note here that strongly focused light beams in general will display phase singularities ( rings in space where certain components of @xmath82 vanish ) , of the kind investigated ( both theoretically and experimentally ) in refs .  @xcite . for gaussian illumination of a spherical lens ,",
    "however , no such singularities appear @xcite .",
    "finally , it may also be interesting to consider tightly focused donut beams , i.e. , beams of light produced by focusing an incoming higher - order lg beam @xcite . in the case of an incoming first - order lg beam",
    ", the incoming field distribution @xmath51 can be written as ( again assuming its focal plane coincides with the plane of the lens ) @xmath83 for the coefficients @xmath84 we find then @xmath85 where @xmath86 indicates that for the @xmath87 sign in ( [ pm ] ) we get @xmath88 and for the @xmath89 sign @xmath90 .",
    "these delta functions again express conservation of angular momentum : the outgoing beam possesses the same angular momentum as the incoming beam @xcite , which has one unit of `` spin '' angular momentum and @xmath91 units of `` orbital '' angular momentum .",
    "the integral can be evaluated using @xmath92 and gives the result @xmath93 for @xmath94 there is a nonzero field on axis of a different polarization than the incoming field : the @xmath7 component , which would be neglected in the paraxial limit is in fact the only nonvanishing component on axis . in this case",
    ", however , the field on axis will be sensitive both to deviations of the lens from an ideal spherical lens , and to deviations of the incoming beam from a pure donut beam , even in the paraxial limit .",
    "for some explicit examples of this sensitivity see , for instance , refs .",
    "in this section we will investigate the response of an atom located in the focal region of a strongly focused laser beam of the form ( [ exact ] ) at @xmath95 .",
    "we consider a @xmath96 transition in the atom , as it is the simplest case where all three polarization components of the light in principle play a role . for simplicity we will assume the atom to be located on the @xmath7 axis , so that it in fact interacts only with a single ( @xmath73 ) polarization component ;",
    "as mentioned above , the other two polarization components vanish on axis .",
    "we are mostly interested in calculating the second - order correlation function for the light field as a function of position and time . for that purpose ,",
    "the heisenberg picture is the most convenient . in the heisenberg picture ,",
    "the electric field operator can be written as the sum of a `` free '' part and a `` source '' part @xcite , @xmath97 where the free part is given by @xmath98 here we separated the field in positive- and negative - frequency parts and used the spatial mode functions @xmath99 from eq .",

    "expressions containing the electric field in time - ordered and normal - ordered form ( as measured using standard photon detectors ) , such as the intensity and the second - order intensity correlation function , can be transformed into what ref .",
    "@xcite denotes as @xmath112-ordered form , where @xmath113 is placed to the left of @xmath114 , @xmath115 to the left of @xmath116 , and where the source parts are time - ordered .",
    "for instance , if we assume the initial state of the light field to be a coherent state then the normally ordered intensity can be written as @xmath117,\\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath118 determines the amplitude of the coherent state , such that @xmath119 . in eq .",
    "( [ int ] ) we introduced the retarded time @xmath120 , and @xmath121 and @xmath122 are expectation values of the corresponding atomic operators .",
    "the three terms in ( [ int ] ) correspond to the intensity @xmath123 of the dipole field , @xmath124 of the incoming laser beam , and the interference term .",
    "similarly , the second - order correlation function ( where we now suppress the dependence of the fields on @xmath125 ) @xmath126 consists of 16 terms . for @xmath127 ,",
    "7 of those vanish identically , and the remaining ones are @xmath128 for the evaluation of the atomic quantities we assume the atom reaches a steady state .",
    "define @xmath129 and the matrices @xmath130 and @xmath131 by @xmath132 with @xmath133 the decay rate of the excited states @xcite , @xmath134 and @xmath135 the detuning of the laser field from atomic resonance . in the steady state",
    "we have then @xmath136 we are mainly interested in finding the maximum effect the atom may have on the outgoing beam .",
    "we therefore consider the case of weak on - resonance excitation , i.e. , @xmath137 and @xmath138 .",
    "we then calculate @xmath139 at @xmath127there is no dependence on @xmath140 in the steady state and for simplicity we leave the argument @xmath140 out as a function of position in the far field .",
    "results are shown in figures  34 .",
    "the distance to the atom is fixed at @xmath141 for numerical reasons .",
    "note that the angular spectrum does depend on the precise value of @xmath142 . only in the forward direction",
    "do the dipole field and a laser field display the same asymptotic behavior . in the forward direction ,",
    "i.e. on the @xmath7 axis , the laser field turns out to overwhelm the scattered field , irrespective of how strongly the light is focused onto the atom .",
    "this may be compared to a similar result for classical scattering from spherical dielectrics with light focused down to spot sizes larger than 5 times the size of the spheres @xcite .",
    "hence we find that @xmath143 for forward scattering , which is in sharp contrast with the result from @xcite which predicts a large bunching effect ( i.e. , @xmath144 ) for tight focusing .",
    "the figure also shows that in a perpendicular direction the dipole field dominates , so that @xmath145 for @xmath146 ( i.e. , there the light is almost purely fluorescence light , which is anti - bunched @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath147 reaches a maximum around angles where the scattered and laser fields are comparable in magnitude .",
    "the oscillations indicate that @xmath148 is very sensitive to the relative phase between the dipole and the laser field .",
    "in fact , maxima in @xmath147 appear when the free field and the dipole field interfere destructively .",
    "indeed , this implies that the total field is smaller than the laser field , which implies a photon has just been absorbed by the atom .",
    "the atom is therefore in its excited state , and hence one can expect a fluorescent photon to appear soon , thus leading to a strong bunching effect .",
    "going from fig .  3 to 4 corresponds to tighter focusing ( @xmath62 decreases by a factor of 2 ) and we see that    1 .   in the forward direction the ratio of the amounts of laser and scattered light decreases ( but it s still much larger than 1 ) .",
    "the region where @xmath147 reaches its maximum moves outward to larger angles @xmath149 .",
    "3 .   the ratio of the amounts of laser and scattered light at @xmath150 increases by a large amount .",
    "[ fig3 ]    [ f5c ]    we can compare these results with those for a gaussian beam with the same beam parameters .",
    "figures  5 and 6 show that the 3 conclusions still hold .",
    "however , a gaussian beam exaggerates the amount of light in the forward direction ( small @xmath149 ) at the cost of greatly underestimating it for larger angles .",
    "this implies that the region where @xmath147 reaches its maximum is moved to smaller angles @xmath149 for a paraxial beam .",
    "[ f5p ]    [ f5p2 ]    we now focus on forward scattering , and plot in figure  7 the ratio of the intensities of the laser field and the dipole field , i.e. , @xmath151 , in the forward direction ( @xmath152 ) as a function of the normalized ( dimensionless ) beam width @xmath153 , defined as @xmath154 the laser field intensity is seen to be much larger than the dipole field intensity , by at least a factor of @xmath155 . for a gaussian beam , on the other hand , the ratio becomes arbitrarily small for small @xmath153 .",
    "this has immediate consequences for the value of @xmath148 ( see figure  8) .    [ ratio ]    for a gaussian beam , the intensity in the focal region is not bounded .",
    "in fact , for decreasing values of @xmath153 , more and more energy is concentrated in the focal region , so much so that the dipole field will eventually dominate the field in the forward direction . in that case , the forward direction will display anti - bunching ( for @xmath153 smaller than approximately 0.07 ) . before that , however , @xmath147 reaches a large maximum at about @xmath156 , namely when the dipole and laser fields are comparable in magnitude . for larger values of @xmath153 ,",
    "the scattered field will be negligible , and @xmath157 , but only after reaching a minimum close to zero around @xmath158 .",
    "the latter characteristics were also found in ref .",
    "@xcite . for the exact solutions , however , none of these effects is present , and the laser field always dominates the dipole field , so that @xmath159 for all values of the beam width .",
    "[ g2 ]    let us finally quantify the effects of focused light on atoms in a different way by considering the following .",
    "if the atomic dipole is @xmath160 , then the relevant quantity determining the excitation probability of an atom is @xmath161 evaluated at the atom s position @xmath162 , while the total incoming energy flux is given by @xmath163 .",
    "in contrast to the naive expectation @xmath164 , the actual ratio @xmath165 that determines the fraction of the energy incident on the atom which will be scattered is given by @xmath166 this ratio is plotted in fig .",
    "9 as a function of the width @xmath167 for several values of the focal parameter @xmath37 . for smaller @xmath37",
    "the best achievable ratio increases , as expected , but for realistic lens parameters , the optimum @xmath165 is about 20% . even for small values of @xmath37 , the maximum scattering ratio does not go beyond 1/2 . this can be understood by noting that the optimum shape of the illuminating field would be a dipole field . here with light coming only from one direction , one may expect @xmath168 to be at most 1/2 .",
    "obviously , with one mirror behind the atom , one can improve the scattering ratio @xmath168 by a factor of 2 .",
    "and of course , by building an optical cavity around the atom the atom - light interaction can be enhanced by many orders of magnitude , but that s a different story @xcite .",
    "we constructed propagating wave solutions of maxwell s equations describing tightly focused laser beams .",
    "the method we used consisted of expanding the outgoing beam in a complete set of solutions and matching it at the plane of a lens to a given incoming beam . the lens was assumed ideal ( infinitely thin ) and the incoming beam was chosen to be gaussian .",
    "we then investigated quantum - statistical properties of the light emitted by an atom in free space , when it is illuminated by such a beam .",
    "light detected in the forward direction does not display any bunching , nor anti - bunching effects : the field is dominated by the laser light , and the normalized second - order intensity correlation function is practically unity .",
    "this may not be surprising but is in contrast to results obtained by using gaussian beams and by a standard quantum - optical input - output model .",
    "gaussian beams are no longer valid approximate solutions under strong focusing conditions , and in particular exaggerate the focal intensity by a large amount . on the other hand",
    ", the input - output formalism implicitly assumes that the scattered field propagates in the same manner as the incident light beam : in free space this would correspond to illumination with a laser field whose profile mimics the dipole pattern . inside a cavity , however , the model is expected to apply , as the situation there is to a good approximation one - dimensional .",
    "indeed , the equations ultimately assume the same form as those for an atom coupled to a cavity mode in the bad - cavity limit @xcite .",
    "although the model of a single ideal lens with a simple lens factor of eq .",
    "( [ lens ] ) may not lead to the strongest possible focusing @xcite , the amount of focusing reached is sufficiently strong ( focusing areas @xmath169 less than or equal to the absorption cross section @xmath0 of an atom ) to conclude that the interaction a focused light beam with an atom is not as strong as might be expected on the basis of the ratio @xmath170 ( see fig .",
    "its consequence for quantum information processing may be phrased as : in free space it is easier and more efficient to use light to process quantum information carried by an atom , than to use an atom to process quantum information carried by photons .",
    "sjve thanks ph .  grangier for illuminating discussions on focusing light beams .",
    "we thank r.  legere for helpful comments and discussions .",
    "this work was funded by darpa through the quic ( quantum information and computing ) program administered by the us army research office , the national science foundation , and the office of naval research .",
    "of course , at this point the electromagnetic field is just a classical solution of the maxwell equations and reference to photons and @xmath72 is not necessary : we could have defined energy density , momentum density etc .  instead ."
