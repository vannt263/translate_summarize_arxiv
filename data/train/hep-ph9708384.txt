    "thus , the final estimate of the t - violating rotation angle @xmath204 is    @xmath247    in real situation the polarizabelity of a grating @xmath248 may exceed the unity .",
    "however , our analysis has been performed under the assumption @xmath249 . if , for example , we take @xmath250 , @xmath251 then @xmath252 rad/@xmath253l@xmath254 and , consequently , for l= 1 cm we will have the amplification by a factor of @xmath255 .",
    "as it is seen , we have obtained the t - violating rotation angle @xmath204 of the same order of @xmath256 .",
    "it makes possible experimental observation of the phenomenon of the t - violating polarization plane rotation .",
    "it should be noted that the manufacturing of diffraction gratings for the range being more longwave than the visible light one may be simpler .",
    "that is why we would like to attract attention to the possibility of studying of the t - violating polarization plane rotation in the vicinity of frequencies of atomic ( molecular ) hiperfine transitions ; for example , for ce ( the transition wavelength is @xmath257 cm ) and tl ( @xmath258 cm ) .",
    "thus , we have shown that the phenomenon of the t - violating polarization plane rotation appears while the photon is scattered by a volume diffraction grating .",
    "the phenomenon grows sharply in the vicinity of the resonance transmission condition . an experimental scheme based on a plane waveguide with a diffraction grating as",
    "a mirror and gas filling has been proposed which enables real experiments on observation of the t - violating polarization plane rotation to be performed .",
    "the rotation angle has been shown to be @xmath259 rad/@xmath241l@xmath254 , where l is the waveguide length ( thickness of the equivalent volume diffracting grating ) .",
