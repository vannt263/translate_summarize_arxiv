    "the exclusive semileptonic decay @xmath10 would become an important process to determine the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix element @xmath11 , when high statistics experimental data becomes available by future @xmath5 factories , since the lattice qcd simulation enables us to compute the relevant form factors from the first principle .",
    "there was , however , a difficulty in treating a heavy quark with mass @xmath12 on the lattice , because possible systematic errors of order @xmath13 could become unacceptably large for a typical lattice spacing @xmath14 accessible in present simulations .",
    "thus the previous lattice calculations of the @xmath5 meson semileptonic decay form factors @xcite involved an extrapolation in the heavy quark mass from the charm quark mass regime to the @xmath15-quark mass assuming a heavy quark mass scaling law , which could introduce a potential systematic error .",

    "are summarized .",
    "we describe the details of our numerical simulation in section [ sec : simulation_details ] , where we point out the subtleties in extracting the form factors : the definition of the heavy meson energy , the choice of the two independent matrix elements to determine @xmath19 and @xmath20 , and the procedure of chiral extrapolation .",

    "the @xmath4 dependence is not affected by the one - loop correction , while their amplitudes decrease by at most 30% .",
    "first we study for which @xmath6 region our present statistics allow us to compute the form factors with reasonable statistical errors .",
    "the @xmath6 dependence of the form factors @xmath19 and @xmath20 are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : ff_02 ] and [ fig : ff_04 ] at @xmath12=2.6 and 1.5 , respectively .",
    "we find that for @xmath116(@xmath187 ) , the range of @xmath6 in which the form factors have good signal covers almost the entire kinematic region for @xmath173 meson and one third of the kinematic region for @xmath5 meson . for @xmath188 ( @xmath189 ) ,",
    "the signal becomes much noisier , but still the form factors have marginally good signal for half and one fourth of the kinematic region for @xmath173 meson and @xmath5 meson , respectively .",
    "although our present results are very noisy after the chiral extrapolation , this will be improved by future high statistics studies .",
    "this is encouraging in view of the fact that the future @xmath5 factories can produce @xmath190 @xmath5-@xmath191 pairs and the branching fraction of @xmath192 from cleo is @xmath193 @xcite .",
    "it is reasonable to expect that there is a possibility of observing @xmath192 events in the @xmath6 regime which the present lattice calculation can cope with .",
    "secondly we study the @xmath194 dependence to see whether the contribution from the @xmath124 resonance to the form factor can actually be observed in the simulation data . at the chiral limit ,",
    "unfortunately , the results are too noisy to discuss their @xmath6 dependence , therefore we use the finite mass results only in the following analysis of the @xmath6 dependence . as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : ff_02 ] and [ fig : ff_04 ] , the lattice results are available only in the large @xmath6 region , at which the recoil momentum of pion is small enough .",
    "therefore it is justified to express the functional form of the form factors by an expansion around the zero recoil limit . for this purpose",
    "we use the inverse form factors @xmath195 and @xmath196 : @xmath197 figure [ fig : ffr_02 ] shows the inverse form factors at @xmath103 as well as their fitted functions with this form .",
    "the numerical results of the fit with and without the condition @xmath198 are given in table [ tab : ff_fit ] for @xmath103 , @xmath199 , and @xmath104 .",
    "the pole dominance model corresponds to a special case @xmath198 , which seems to describe the data very well as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ffr_02 ] .",
    "the mass of the intermediate state is given by @xmath200 , which corresponds to the vector ( @xmath124 ) meson mass in the pole dominance model .",
    "precisely speaking , the more consistent analysis is to impose the condition @xmath201 for the fit by eq .",
    "( [ eq : ffit ] ) .",
    "this constrained fit is shown with the long dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : ffr_02 ] . it is found that now the fit do not quite agree with the data , but the deviation is about 10 % .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : pole_mass ] we also compare @xmath202 and the measured vector meson mass as a function of @xmath127 .",
    "again we find that there is a discrepancy between @xmath202 from the unconstrained fit and the measured @xmath203 , which is around few hundred mev .",
    "nevertheless , it is remarkable that the deviation remains the same order and the mass dependence of @xmath202 has the same trend with @xmath203 .",
    "we have not yet understood whether the above discrepancies can be explained from the remaining systematic errors such as the discretization error .",
    "but at least qualitatively judging from the size of the uncertainty in our calculation , our data is not inconsistent with the picture that there is a sizable contribution from the @xmath124 pole to the form factor @xmath204 near @xmath205 .",
    "so far the discussion have been based on the tree level study .",
    "let us now study how one - loop renormalization changes the form factors . because the one - loop correction is different for @xmath178 and @xmath186 , the shape of the form factors may change significantly .",
    "figure [ fig : ff02renorm ] shows the form factors for @xmath103 and @xmath116 with renormalization factors .",
    "the leading logarithmic factor eq.([eq : theta ] ) is not multiplied in the present case .",
    "we find that the renormalized @xmath19 has stronger @xmath6 dependence than that of at the tree level , while @xmath20 receives only a small change .",
    "the renormalization makes the @xmath124 pole fit even worse .",
    "in fact , the deviation of the constrained fit from our renormalized @xmath19 data is as large as 25 % near @xmath205 .",
    "this is still within the typical size of @xmath74 errors .",
    "it is very important to perform the analysis with larger @xmath93 .      applying the soft pion theorem to the @xmath0 matrix element",
    ", @xmath206 is related to the @xmath5 meson decay constant @xcite @xmath207 in the massless pion limit .",
    "this relation is examined in fig . [",
    "fig : spt ] . for the values of @xmath165",
    ", we refer our work on @xmath165@xcite , which is obtained with an evolution equation of a slightly different form from that of the present work .",
    "we observe a large discrepancy between @xmath20 and the decay constant both for the @xmath4 dependence and for the value itself .",
    "@xmath165 increases rapidly toward heavier heavy quark masses , while @xmath208 almost stays constant .",
    "the discrepancy still remains significant when the renormalization effect is incorporated . in evaluating the renormalized values of @xmath165",
    ", we use one - loop perturbative coefficient obtained in the same manner as in section  [ subsec : pcorr ] @xcite .",
    "the leading logarithmic factor eq.([eq : theta ] ) is multiplied to both @xmath208 and @xmath165 .",
    "one may argue that the observed discrepancy can be explained by the uncertainty in the extrapolation procedure . to study this possibility",
    ", we compare @xmath208 and @xmath209 also in finite light quark mass cases , in the light of the heavy meson effective theory which implies the relation ( [ eq : hmet ] ) .",
    "they are compared in fig .",
    "[ fig : spt_ext ] as a function of @xmath210 .",
    "the difference between them are remarkable even for finite light quark mass cases .",
    "the reason why these differences occur is not clear .",
    "since our present results suffer from various systematic uncertainties , as described in the next section , further study with better control of systematic errors is necessary to clarify the origin of the problem .",
    "in this section , we qualitatively discuss on the systematic uncertainties associated with the lattice regularization .",
    "the following is a list of the main sources of systematic errors :    * @xmath74 errors : the characteristic size of @xmath211 error arising from the unimproved wilson quark action at @xmath2 is 2030% .",
    "this effect is large enough to explain the discrepancy between @xmath212 and @xmath136 , mentioned in section [ sec : simulation_details ] .",
    "use of the @xmath74-improved clover action for the light quark will reduce this error to the level of 5 % .",
    "* @xmath213 error : the systems with finite momentum may suffer from the discretization errors more seriously than that at the zero recoil point . the analytic estimate of the momentum dependent error @xcite shows that the effect is about 20 % at @xmath214 gev even one uses the @xmath74-improved current . *",
    "perturbative corrections : the one - loop correction could become significant especially for small @xmath93 values . strictly speaking ,",
    "our calculation does not treat the one - loop effects correctly , because the stabilizing parameter @xmath37 does not have correct values .",
    "this problem must be removed in the future studies . in estimating the one - loop corrections",
    ", we did not include the effect of the operator mixing , which was reported to be significant in the case of @xmath165 @xcite .",
    "this effect also should be included to obtain reliable results . *",
    "@xmath215 effects : we described the heavy quark with the nrqcd action including the order @xmath16 terms .",
    "further precise calculations may need to include @xmath215 corrections , although the effect was shown to be small@xcite for @xmath165",
    ".    the finite volume effect may also be important .",
    "since the all above systematic errors can be large , there is no advantage of giving quantitative estimates of each error at this stage .",
    "the use of the @xmath74-improved ( clover ) action for light quark , as well as the simulation at higher @xmath93 values will reduce most of the above systematic errors . the simulation with dynamical",
    "quarks is also of great importance for reliable predictions of the weak matrix elements .",
    "in this paper , we present the results of the study of @xmath0 form factors using nrqcd to describe the heavy quark with the wilson light quark .",
    "clear signal is observed for the matrix element in a wide range of heavy quark mass containing the physical @xmath15-quark mass .",
    "they are extrapolated to the chiral limit , although the result is so noisy for quantitative conclusion .",
    "the @xmath4 dependence of the matrix elements are studied and it is clarified that the temporal component and the part of the spatial component proportional to the pion momentum have fairly small dependencies on @xmath12 . on the other hand ,",
    "the part of the spatial component proportional to the @xmath5 momentum has a significant @xmath216 correction .",
    "the @xmath6 dependence of the form factors in the finite light quark masses are studied .",
    "we find that the @xmath6 dependence of the form factor @xmath7 near @xmath8 becomes much stronger for larger heavy quark mass .",
    "model independent fit of @xmath217 near @xmath8 shows that the tree level results are consistent with the pole behavior for large @xmath6 range , and the difference of fitted pole mass and the measured @xmath218 is around few hundred mev for all the heavy quark masses .",
    "the values of @xmath20 at the zero recoil point are compared with the prediction of the soft pion theorem , and the significant discrepancy is observed .",
    "the size of the renormalization corrections are estimated by the one - loop perturbative calculation .",
    "they almost does not affect their @xmath16 dependence , but decrease @xmath186 much more than @xmath178 , which drastically change the shape of @xmath19 .",
    "our present result suffers from large systematic uncertainties , and the most important one is @xmath74 error .",
