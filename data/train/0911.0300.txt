    "the study of hadron properties in baryonic matter has been pursued via several experiments in the last two decades .",
    "the systematic investigation of @xmath6 sub - threshold production yields , phase space distributions and flow observables in relativistic heavy - ion collisions at various beam energies ( 1 - 2 agev ) and for various system sizes ( from c+c to au+au ) and centralities has attracted much attention , related to distinct in - medium properties of @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons @xcite .",
    "corresponding experiments have been the focus of previous studies by the kaos @xcite and fopi @xcite collaborations at gsi . from the analysis of the out - of - plane @xcite and sideward flow @xcite the @xmath0-nucleon potential",
    "is expected to be repulsive and the @xmath0 measured production yields are in agreement with the scenario of a soft nuclear equation of state ( @xmath7 ) @xcite . + recently published kaos data @xcite gave an important contribution towards understanding the production mechanism of @xmath8 mesons .",
    "indeed , the combined analysis of @xmath0 and @xmath1 yielded the interpretation that a substantial part of the observed @xmath1 mesons is due to a strangeness exchange mechanism @xcite .",
    "+ on the other hand , attention has been drawn to the study of @xmath3 and @xmath4 production in heavy collision for the mentioned energy range .",
    "the study of the neutral strange particles could deliver information on the in - medium potential without the contribution of the coulomb interaction @xcite .",
    "the spectrometer hades @xcite , primarily designed to measure di - electrons @xcite , has been recently employed for the identification of strange mesons as well , showing high purity and efficiency for particle identification and excellent reconstruction capability of secondary decay vertices @xcite . for the first time , a combined and exclusive identification of @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 mesons was carried out at sub - threshold beam energy for the reaction ar + kcl at 1.76 agev @xcite .",
    "( `` sub - threshold '' refers to free nucleon - nucleon collisions and is related here to @xmath1 and @xmath2 channels . )",
    "our measurement allows firm conclusions on the fraction of @xmath1 mesons stemming from @xmath2 decay @xcite .",
    "+ at the same time the reconstruction of the @xmath3 and @xmath4 particles was carried out .",
    "the high statistics collected for these particles in the phase space region of mid - rapidity render these data particularly interesting for further comparisons with transport models .",
    "the experiment was performed with the * h*igh * a*cceptance * d*i-*e*lectron * s*pectrometer hades at the heavy - ion synchrotron sis ( schwerionensynchrotron ) at gsi ( gesellschaft fr schwerionenforschung ) in darmstadt , germany . a detailed description of the spectrometer is presented in @xcite .",
    "hades consists of a 6-coil toroidal magnet centered on the beam axis and six identical detection sections located between the coils and covering polar angles between @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the sectors were composed of a gaseous ring - imaging cherenkov ( rich ) detector , four planes of multi - wire drift chambers ( mdcs ) for track reconstruction , and two time - of - flight walls ( tof / tofino ) supplemented at forward polar angles with pre - shower chambers . + an argon beam of @xmath11 particles / s was incident on a four - fold segmented kcl target with a total thickness corresponding to @xmath12 interaction length .",
    "a fast diamond start detector located upstream of the target was used to determine the interaction time .",
    "the data readout was started by a first - level trigger ( lvl1 ) decision , requiring a charged - particle multiplicity , @xmath13 , in the tof / tofino detectors , accepting approximately 35% of the nuclear reaction cross section .",
    "hadrons have been identified using the time - of - flight walls tof and tofino(+pre - shower ) and the mdcs .",
    "the particles can be distinguished by their velocity and by their energy loss ( @xmath14 ) in one of these detectors as a function of their momentum . for the hadron identification",
    "graphical cuts were applied around these distributions @xcite .",
    "+ for the @xmath8 identification only the tof data are considered , because of rather large background in the tofino due to its limited granularity and time resolution . in order to drastically reduce the background of protons and pions , graphical cuts according to the calculation of the tof @xmath14 and the mdc @xmath14 distributions have been applied .",
    "figure [ kaon_mass ] ( top left ) shows the polarity times mass over charge number distributions for particle tracks measured in the tof detector without any de / dx cut and when the tof and tof+mdc @xmath14 cuts for @xmath0 and @xmath1 are applied .",
    "one can see how the kaon peaks stick out of the background . +",
    "the @xmath0 and @xmath1 yields are extracted applying a gaussian fit of the signal after the background subtraction and the integration over the whole phase space @xcite . in order to reconstruct @xmath2 mesons , @xmath0 and @xmath1 ,",
    "are combined to pairs .",
    "+ the resulting invariant mass distributions for @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 pairs are shown in figure  [ kaon_mass ] where @xmath2 , @xmath4 and @xmath18 peaks are clearly visible .",
    "the combinatorial background was described using the mixed event technique .",
    "the geometrical acceptance for the particles has been determined as a function of the emission rapidity and transverse mass .",
    "a full - scale simulation of the hades spectrometer was performed with the geant3 package @xcite .",
    "the reconstruction efficiency for the particles has been determined using simulations , exploiting the embedded tracks method @xcite .",
    "+    the efficiency corrected transverse mass spectra for @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath4 , @xmath19 and @xmath2 for different laboratory rapidity bins are exhibited in figure  [ mtkaons ] .",
    "if a boltzmann fit according to @xmath20 is applied , a good description of the experimental data is achieved .",
    "+ the so obtained inverse slope parameters @xmath21 for each rapidity bin @xmath22 are used to extract an effective inverse slope parameter of all particle species .",
    "this is done by assuming a thermal emission source and fitting the @xmath21 distribution @xcite according to @xmath23 .",
    "the obtained parameter @xmath24 represents the inverse slope at cm rapidity and can be considered as an effective temperature of the kinetic freeze - out of the respective particle .",
    "the @xmath24 values obtained for the particles are shown in table [ tempmulti ] .",
    "+ one can see that @xmath24 is lower for @xmath1 than for @xmath0 .",
    "this can be understood as different freeze - out conditions for the two meson species @xcite .",
    "+ if we consider the @xmath24 obtained for the @xmath2 meson , one can see that this value is much higher than the one obtained for @xmath1 and slightly smaller than the @xmath0 value . since the event statistics is not sufficient to tag the fraction of kaons which are produced in the @xmath2 decay , it is difficult to draw conclusions .",
    "one might interpret this difference in the temperature again as a signature of the different freeze - out conditions between @xmath2 and @xmath1 .",
    "if a considerable fraction of the @xmath1 is generated in secondary processes , the effective temperature might be lower .",
    "following these considerations it would be very interesting to enlarge the event statistics and select exclusively on the @xmath1 produced in the @xmath2 decay .",
    "+ one can see that the low - momentum component of the @xmath19 spectrum has been measured with high statistics in the whole phase space , even in the mid - rapidity region .",
    "since the mesons with lower momenta are supposed to experience more strongly the effect of the interaction potential with the nuclear medium , these data are very well suited to study in - medium effects .",
    "the high capability of the hades spectrometer to be employed in the analysis of strange baryon and mesons has been demonstrated .",
    "the good quality of the extracted signals for @xmath0 and @xmath1 has been shown via the mass , transverse mass and rapidity distributions .",
    "a total of @xmath25 counts has been collected for the @xmath2 meson in the reaction ar + kcl at kinetic beam energy of 1.756 agev .",
    "+ high event statistics and high quality data for the @xmath19 and @xmath4 signals have been reconstructed over a large fraction of the phase space , including also the mid - rapidity region .",
    "these data are well suited for the comparison with model calculations . in particular",
    ", the low momentum component of the @xmath19 spectra should be sensible to in - medium properties of the interaction potential .",
