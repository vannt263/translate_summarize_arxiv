    "the seniority quantum number was introduced by racah for the classification of electrons in an atomic @xmath1 configuration  @xcite .",
    "he assumed a spin - independent interaction @xmath2 between the electrons with the property @xmath3 that is , there is no interaction unless the two electrons orbital angular momenta @xmath4 are coupled to a combined angular momentum of @xmath5 .",
    "racah was able to derive a closed formula for the interaction energy among @xmath6 electrons and to prove that any eigenstate of the interaction  ( [ e_pairl1 ] ) is characterized by a ` seniority number ' @xmath7 , a quantum number additional to the total orbital angular momentum @xmath8 , the total spin @xmath9 and the number of electrons @xmath6 .",
    "he also showed that @xmath7 corresponds to the number of electrons that are not in pairs coupled to @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "racah s original definition of seniority made use of coefficients of fractional parentage .",
    "he later noted that simplifications arose through the use of group theory  @xcite .",

    "the number of states available to a single electron in an @xmath4 orbit is @xmath12 .",
    "all states of the @xmath1 configuration therefore belong to the totally antisymmetric irreducible representation ( ir ) @xmath13 $ ] of @xmath14 .",
    "furthermore , the natural scheme for electrons in an atom is @xmath15 coupling which corresponds to the reduction @xmath16 , where the orbital degrees of freedom are contained in @xmath17 and the spin degrees of freedom in @xmath18 . for any value of @xmath4",
    "the unitary algebra @xmath17 contains the orthogonal subalgebra @xmath10 which in turn contains so(3 ) , associated with the total orbital angular momentum @xmath8 .    the group - theoretical classification  ( [ e_clasl ] ) allowed racah to derive a number of important results in the theory of complex atomic spectra .",
    "the pairing force  ( [ e_pairl1 ] ) , however , is a poor approximation to the coulomb interaction between electrons and for a more physically relevant application of seniority we have to turn to nuclei .",
    "the discussion of seniority in atoms and in nuclei differs in two aspects : ( i ) @xmath15 coupling is a good first - order approximation in atoms while in nuclei it is rather @xmath19 coupling and ( ii ) electrons are identical particles while nucleons come in two kinds , neutrons and protons .",
    "let us postpone the discussion of the second complication until sect .",
    "[ s_isospin ] and concentrate in this section on the case of identical nucleons ( either all neutrons or all protons ) .",
    "we impose the additional restriction that the identical nucleons are confined to a single-@xmath0 shell , deferring the discussion of the many-@xmath0 case to sect .",

    "since the nucleons are identical , all states of the @xmath24 configuration belong to the totally antisymmetric ir @xmath13 $ ] of @xmath25 .",
    "the irs of @xmath23 therefore must be totally antisymmetric of the type @xmath26 $ ] .",
    "the allowed values of seniority are @xmath27 or 0 .",
    "the angular momentum content for a given seniority @xmath7 can also be worked out  @xcite but no simple general rule is available .",
    "an alternative , simpler definition of seniority can be given which relies on the existence of an su(2 ) symmetry of the pairing hamiltonian  @xcite . in second quantization",
    "the pairing interaction  ( [ e_pairj1me ] ) is written as @xmath28 with @xmath29 where @xmath30 creates a nucleon in the shell @xmath0 with projection @xmath31 .",
    "the commutator of @xmath32 and @xmath33 leads to the operator @xmath34=(2\\hat n_j-2j-1)/2\\equiv2\\hat s^j_z$ ] , which thus equals , up to a constant , the number operator @xmath35 .",
    "since the three operators @xmath36 close under commutation , @xmath37=\\pm \\hat s^j_\\pm$ ] and @xmath34=2\\hat s^j_z$ ] , they form an su(2 ) algebra , referred to as the quasi - spin algebra .",
    "this algebraic structure allows an analytical solution of the pairing hamiltonian . from the commutation relations it follows that @xmath38 , which shows that the pairing hamiltonian can be written as a combination of casimir operators belonging to su(2 ) and @xmath39 .",
    "the associated eigenvalue problem can be solved instantly , yielding the energy expression @xmath40 $ ] .",
    "the quantum numbers @xmath9 and @xmath41 can be put in relation to the seniority @xmath7 and the nucleon number @xmath6 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 , leading to the energy expression @xmath44 .",

    "while this analysis shows that the eigenstates of a pairing interaction carry good seniority , it does not answer the question what are the necessary and sufficient conditions for a general interaction to conserve seniority .",
    "let us specify a rotationally invariant two - body interaction @xmath2 by the matrix elements @xmath46 with @xmath47 .",
    "the necessary and sufficient conditions for the conservation of seniority can then be written as @xmath48 with @xmath49 , and where the symbol between curly brackets is a racah coefficient .",
    "these conditions have been derived previously in a variety of ways  @xcite .",
    "although ( [ e_condi ] ) determines all constraints on the matrix elements @xmath50 by varying @xmath49 , it does not tell us how many of those are independent .",
    "this number turns out to be @xmath51 , the number of independent seniority @xmath52 states  @xcite .",
    "no condition on the matrix elements @xmath50 is obtained for @xmath53 , 5/2 and 7/2 , one condition for @xmath54 , 11/2 and 13/2 , and so on . as a result ,",
    "identical nucleons in a single shell with @xmath55 conserve seniority for _ any _ interaction  @xcite .",
    "clearly , the conditions  ( [ e_condi ] ) are much weaker than the requirement that the interaction be of pairing character but still many of the results of the quasi - spin formalism remain valid . for instance , the ground state of an even  even nucleus still can be written in the form  ( [ e_cond1 ] ) . the main restriction of the concept of seniority as defined so far , concerns the fact that the nucleons are confined to a single-@xmath0 shell . to lift this restriction",
    ", we turn to the generalization presented in the next section .",
    "the quasi - spin algebra can be generalized to the case of several degenerate shells ( which we assume to be @xmath56 in number ) by making the substitutions @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "therefore , if a semi - magic nucleus can be approximated as a system of identical nucleons interacting through a pairing force and distributed over several degenerate shells , the formulas of the quasi - spin formalism should apply .",
    "in particular , the ground states of even  even semi - magic nuclei will have a ` superfluid ' structure of the form @xmath59 where @xmath60 represents the vacuum ( _ i.e. _ , the doubly - magic core nucleus ) .",
    "the su(2 ) quasi - spin solution of the pairing hamiltonian  ( [ e_pairj1 ] ) leads to several characteristic predictions : a constant excitation energy ( independent of @xmath6 ) of the first - excited @xmath61 state in even  even isotopes , the linear variation of two - nucleon separation energies as a function of @xmath6 , the odd  even staggering in nuclear binding energies , the enhancement of two - nucleon transfer .",
    "a more generally valid model is obtained if one imposes the following condition on the hamiltonian : @xmath62,\\hat s_+]= \\delta\\left(\\hat s_+\\right)^2 , \\label{e_gsen}\\ ] ] where @xmath63 creates the lowest two - nucleon eigenstate of @xmath64 and @xmath65 is a constant .",
    "this condition of generalized seniority , which was proposed by talmi  @xcite , is much weaker than the assumption of a pairing interaction and , in particular , it does not require the commutator @xmath66 $ ] to yield ( up to a constant ) the number operator  a property which is central to the quasi - spin formalism . in spite of the absence of a closed algebraic structure , it is still possible to compute the exact ground - state eigenvalue but hamiltonians satisfying  ( [ e_gsen ] )",
    "are no longer necessarily completely solvable .",
    "an exact method to solve the problem of identical nucleons distributed over non - degenerate levels interacting through a pairing force was proposed a long time ago by richardson  @xcite based on the bethe _ ansatz _  @xcite . as an illustration of richardson s",
    "approach , we supplement the pairing interaction with a one - body term , to obtain the following hamiltonian : @xmath67 where @xmath68 are single - particle energies .",
    "the solvability of the hamiltonian  ( [ e_pairjm1 ] ) arises as a result of the symmetry @xmath69 where each su(2 ) algebra pertains to a specific @xmath0 .",
    "whether the solution of  ( [ e_pairjm1 ] ) can be called superfluid depends on the differences @xmath70 in relation to the strength @xmath71 . in all cases",
    "the solution is known in closed form for all possible choices of @xmath68 .",
    "it is instructive to analyze first the case of @xmath72 nucleons because it gives insight into the structure of the general problem .",
    "the two - nucleon , @xmath73 eigenstates can be written as @xmath74 with @xmath75 coefficients that are determined from the eigenequation @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the unknown eigenenergy . with some elementary manipulations",
    "this can be converted into the secular equation @xmath78 , with @xmath79 , from where @xmath75 can be obtained up to a normalization constant , @xmath80 .",
    "the eigenenergy @xmath77 can be found by substituting the solution for @xmath75 into the secular equation , leading to @xmath81 this equation can be solved graphically which is done in fig .",
    "[ f_rich2 ] for a particular choice of single - particle energies @xmath68 and degeneracies @xmath82 , appropriate for the tin isotopes with @xmath83 protons and neutrons distributed over the 5082 shell .",
    "fermions distributed over @xmath84 single - particle orbits .",
    "the sum @xmath85 is plotted as a function of @xmath77 ; the intersections of this curve with the line @xmath86 ( dots ) then correspond to the solutions of the richardson equation.,width=529 ]    in the limit @xmath87 of weak pairing , the solutions @xmath88 are obtained , as should be .",
    "of more interest is the limit of strong pairing , @xmath89 . from the graphical solution",
    "we see that in this limit there is one eigenstate of the pairing hamiltonian which lies well below the other eigenstates with approximately constant amplitudes @xmath75 since for that eigenstate @xmath90 .",
    "hence , in the limit of strong pairing one finds a @xmath73 ground state which can be approximated as @xmath91 where @xmath92 . because of this property this state is often referred to as the collective @xmath9 state , in the sense that all single - particle orbits contribute to its structure .",
    "this result can be generalized to @xmath6 particles , albeit that the general solution is more complex .",
    "on the basis of the two - particle problem one may propose , for an even number of particles @xmath6 , a ground state of the hamiltonian  ( [ e_pairjm1 ] ) of the form ( up to a normalization constant ) @xmath93 which is known as the bethe _ ansatz _  @xcite .",
    "each pair in the product is defined through coefficients @xmath94 in terms of an energy @xmath95 depending on @xmath96 which labels the @xmath97 pairs .",
    "this product indeed turns out to be the ground state provided the @xmath95 are solutions of @xmath97 coupled , non - linear equations @xmath98 known as the richardson equations  @xcite .",
    "note the presence of a second term on the left - hand side with differences of the unknowns @xmath99 in the denominator , which is absent in the two - particle case .",
    "in addition , the energy of the state  ( [ e_gsrich ] ) is given by @xmath100 .",
    "a characteristic feature of the bethe _ ansatz _ is that it no longer consists of a superposition of _ identical _ pairs since the coefficients @xmath101 vary as @xmath96 runs from 1 to @xmath97 .",
    "richardson s model thus provides a solution that covers all possible hamiltonians  ( [ e_pairjm1 ] ) , ranging from those with superfluid character to those with little or no pairing correlations  @xcite .",
    "an important remaining restriction on the form of the pairing hamiltonian  ( [ e_pairjm1 ] ) is that it contains a single strength parameter @xmath71 whereas , in general , the interaction might depend on @xmath0 and @xmath102 , leading to @xmath103 strengths @xmath104 . in nuclei , often the assumption of a separable interaction is made which , in the case of pairing , leads to strengths @xmath105 in terms of @xmath56 parameters @xmath106 .",
    "this restriction leads to the following pairing hamiltonian : @xmath107 as yet , no closed solution of the general hamiltonian  ( [ e_pairjm2 ] ) is known but three solvable cases have been worked out :    1 .",
    "the strengths @xmath106 are constant ( independent of @xmath0 ) .",
    "this case was discussed above .",

    "about ten years after its introduction by racah , seniority was adopted in nuclear physics for the @xmath19-coupling classification of nucleons in a single-@xmath0 shell  @xcite .",
    "the main additional difficulty in nuclei is that one deals with a system of neutrons and protons , and hence the isospin @xmath108 of the nucleons should be taken into account .",
    "the generalization of the classification  ( [ e_clasj1 ] ) for identical nucleons toward neutrons and protons reads as follows : @xmath109 [ 1^n]&&[h]&&[\\sigma]&&&&j&&t \\end{array } , \\label{e_clasj2}\\ ] ] where @xmath110 $ ] and @xmath111 $ ] are young tableaux associated with @xmath25 and @xmath23 . in general , @xmath45 labels are needed to characterize an ir of @xmath25 , @xmath110=[h_1,h_2,\\dots , h_{2j+1}]$ ] , and @xmath112 labels are needed for an ir of @xmath23 , @xmath111=[\\sigma_1,\\sigma_2,\\dots,\\sigma_{j+1/2}]$ ] . to ensure overall antisymmetry under @xmath113 , the young tableaux of @xmath25 and @xmath114",

    "the former has the same interpretation as in the like - nucleon case while the latter corresponds to the isospin of the nucleons which are not in pairs coupled to @xmath73 .",
    "the group - theoretical analysis is considerably more complex here than in the case of identical nucleons and , in addition , for each value of @xmath0 one is faced with a different reduction problem associated with @xmath120 .",
    "it is therefore advantageous to go over to a quasi - spin formulation of the problem and , as was shown by helmers  @xcite , this is possible for whatever value of the intrinsic quantum number of the particles ( which is @xmath121 for nucleons ) . if the pairing interaction is assumed to be isospin invariant , it is the same in the three @xmath122 channels , neutron  neutron , neutron  proton and proton  proton , and eq .",

    "the hamiltonian  ( [ e_pairl2 ] ) contains two parameters @xmath71 and @xmath140 , the strengths of the isovector and isoscalar components of the pairing interaction .",
    "while in the previous case the single strength parameter @xmath71 just defines an overall scale , this is no longer true for a generalized pairing interaction and different solutions are obtained for different ratios @xmath141 .",

    "depends on a single interaction parameter . with the technique explained above , the phase diagram for atoms with spin @xmath165 can also be derived .",
    "the results are exact and valid for arbitrary @xmath6 .",
    "the entire spectrum is determined by the eigenvalue expression together with the necessary branching rules .",
    "in particular , the allowed values of total spin @xmath196 for a given seniority @xmath7 are derived from the @xmath203 branching rule given by @xmath204 with @xmath205 and @xmath206 .",
    "it is now possible to determine all possible ground - state configurations of the condensate and their quantum numbers @xmath207 and @xmath208  @xcite .",
    "the character of the ground state does not depend on the coefficients @xmath209 since the first two terms in the expression  ( [ e_hamsol ] ) give a constant contribution to the energy of all states .",
    "although this contribution is dominant , the spectrum - generating perturbation of the hamiltonian is confined to the last two terms and depends solely on the coefficients @xmath191 and @xmath192 which are related to the original interactions @xmath184 according to @xmath210 and @xmath211 .",
    "the phase diagram displays a richer structure than in the @xmath193 case .",
    "there is an aligned phase where the seniority is maximal , @xmath212 , and all spins are aligned , @xmath213 .",
    "secondly , there is a low - seniority ( paired ) and consequently low - spin phase . for even @xmath6 ,",
    "this corresponds to @xmath214 .",
    "the aligned and paired phases are also encountered for interacting @xmath193 atoms . for @xmath165 a third phase occurs characterized by high seniority ( _ i.e. _ , unpaired ) and low total spin , @xmath215 with @xmath216 or 1 .",
    "since the hamiltonian  ( [ e_hamsol ] ) is solvable for @xmath165 , all eigenstates , and in particular the three different ground states , can be determined analytically .",
    "the general expressions given by chacn _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite reduce to @xmath217 where the @xmath165 atoms are denoted as @xmath218 bosons . in the second of these expressions",
    "it is assumed that @xmath6 is even and in the third that @xmath219 ; other cases are obtained by adding a single boson @xmath220 or a @xmath221 pair .",
    "the @xmath222 are the so - called traceless boson operators  @xcite which are defined as @xmath223 ( see also chapt .  8 of ref .",
    "the wave functions  ( [ e_wave ] ) are the _ exact _ finite-@xmath6 expressions for the eigenstates of the hamiltonian  ( [ e_hamsol ] ) .",
    "since in the large-@xmath6 limit the traceless boson operators @xmath224 become identical to @xmath225 , one arrives at a simple interpretation of the three types of configurations : ( i ) spin - aligned , ( ii ) condensed into _",
    "pairs of atoms _ coupled to @xmath202 , and ( iii ) condensed into _ triplets of atoms _ coupled to @xmath202 .    in conclusion ,",
    "the consideration of seniority is crucial in obtaining results concerning bose ",
    "einstein condensates consisting of atoms with spin . since all eigenstates of interacting atoms with spin @xmath199",
    "are known analytically , this opens up the possibility to study the relaxation properties of such condensates using their exact , macroscopic wave functions .",
    "in addition , preliminary studies indicate that seniority can be exploited even when @xmath200 .",
    "these problems are currently under investigation  @xcite .",
    "this paper is dedicated to the memory of marcos moshinsky .",
    "the two years i have spent in mexico as a visitor and the many hours with marcos as a teacher , were crucial to my formation as a physicist . without him i never could have written this paper ."
