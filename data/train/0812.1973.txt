    "it is by now well known that the problem of solving vector and tensor wave equations in curved spacetime , motivated by physical problems such as those occurring in gravitational wave theory and relativistic astrophysics , is in general a challenge even for the modern computational resources . within this framework , a striking problem is the coupled nature of the set of hyperbolic equations one arrives at .",
    "for example , on using the maxwell action functional @xmath0 jointly with the lorenz @xcite gauge condition @xmath1 one gets , in vacuum , the coupled equations for the electromagnetic potential @xmath2 it was necessary to wait until the mid - seventies to obtain a major breakthrough in the solution of coupled hyperbolic equations such as ( 3 ) , thanks to the work of cohen and kegeles @xcite , who reduced the problem to the task of finding solutions of a complex scalar equation . even on considering specific backgrounds such as de sitter spacetime",
    ", only the green functions of the wave operator have been obtained explicitly so far @xcite , to the best of our knowledge .",
    "thus , in a recent paper @xcite , we have studied the vector and tensor wave equations in de sitter space - time with static spherical coordinates , so that the line element reads as @xmath3 where @xmath4 , and @xmath5 is the hubble constant related to the cosmological constant @xmath6 by @xmath7 .",
