    "blazars , including bl lacertae objects ( bl lacs ) and flat spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs ) , are extragalactic radio sources with relativistic jets aligned nearly ( @xmath5 10@xmath6 ) with the line of sight ( e.g. , urry & padovani 1995 ) .",
    "blazar emission extends across the entire electromagnetic ( em ) spectrum , is predominantly nonthermal , and shows significant polarization in the radio and visible bands where it can be measured .",
    "blazars show detectable flux variations on diverse timescales ranging from a few minutes through days and months to decades through all em bands .",
    "blazar variability timescales have often been somewhat arbitrarily divided into three classes : timescales from minutes to less than a day are called intra - day variability ( idv ) ; those from several days to a few months are known as short timescale variability ( stv ) ; while long term variability ( ltv ) covers changes from several months to many years ( e.g. , gupta et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "short and intra - day x - ray variability has been investigated in various classes of agns ( e.g. , edelson & nandra 1999 ; uttley et al .",

    "2008 ; lachowicz et al.2009 ; and references therein ) .",
    "the great majority of these studies have been done for the brighter sources , which are typically nearby seyfert galaxies , and were reviewed recently by uttley ( 2007 ) .",
    "there were claims of the detection of qpos in a few agns on the short and idv timescales in early x - ray observations ( fiore et al .",
    "1989 ; papadakis & lawrence 1993 ; iwasawa et al .",
    "1998 ) . but",
    "all of these claimed qpo detections were later found to be not statistically significant ( tagliaferri et al .",
    "1996 ; benlloch et al .  2001 ; vaughan 2005 ; vaughan & uttley 2006 ) .",
    "there have , however , been few stronger claims of qpo detection recently in x - ray data of various classes of agns .",
    "the first significant detection of a short x - ray qpo of @xmath7 1 hour timescale has been reported for re j1034@xmath1396 , which is a narrow line seyfert 1 galaxy ( gierliski et al .",
    "espaillat et al .",
    "( 2008 ) have reported an x - ray qpo on the timescale of 3.3 ks in 3c 273 , a fsrq .",
    "very recently , lachowicz et al .  ( 2009 ) have reported a detection of a x - ray qpo in the bl lac pks 2155@xmath0304 on a timescale of @xmath7 4.6 hours .",
    "all three of these qpo detections on idv timescales were based on observations made with xmm - newton . by using all sky monitor data from the rossi x - ray timing explorer , rani et al .",
    "( 2009 ) have reported a probable qpo from the bl lac ao 0235@xmath1164 on a stv timescale of @xmath7 18 days .",
    "such qpos may shed new light on the physical processes at the source and associated x - ray emission and so the search for their presence in the light curves ( lcs ) of agn is important .",
    "the full spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of blazars have double humped structures with each large spectral feature having comparable total powers . in these double humped seds , the first ( lower energy )",
    "component of the sed is quite clearly dominated by synchrotron radiation from the relativistic jet and the second component is probably due to inverse - compton ( ic ) radiation . on the basis of their seds",
    ", blazars can be classified into two subclasses known as lbls ( low - energy peaked blazars ) and hbls ( high energy peaked blazars ) , though those with intermediate peaks are certainly found ( nieppola et al .",
    "2006 ) . in lbls , the synchrotron component peaks at near - ir , optical or near - uv frequencies and the high energy component usually peaks at gev energies . in hbls",
    ", the synchrotron component peaks somewhere in the x - ray band and the high energy component is seen to peak ( or is extrapolated to do so ) at tev energies .    here , we study four hbls which are designated as tev blazars because of their significant detections in that extreme energy band .",
    "just six years ago only six tev blazars were known ( see krawczynski et al .",
    "2004 for a summary of their properties ) .",
    "thanks to the development of new tev facilities such as hess ( high energy stereoscopic system ; hofmann et al .  2003 ; funk et al .",

    "2006 ) , magic ( major atmospheric gamma - ray imaging cerenkov ; ( baixeras et al .  2004",

    "; maier  2007 , maier et al .",
    "2008 ) there has been a complete revolution in tev gamma - ray astronomy .",
    "these groups have detected about a dozen new tev emitting blazars ( hbls ) ( albert et al .  2006b , 2007 , 2008 , 2009 ; acciari et al .",
    "2008 , 2009a , 2009b ; aharonian et al .",

    "the enlarged sample of tev blazars will be very useful for our understanding of the emission mechanism of these extreme blazars through the study of their variability properties across the range of em bands . here , we report our search for x - ray variability on idv timescales in four hbls from the xmm - newton satellite public archive .",
    "we plan to perform extensive variability studies of hbls in other em bands using ground based observations .",
    "the motivation of this work is to examine the nature of idv in a sample of four high energy peaked blazars , namely , pks 0548@xmath0322 , on 231 , 1es 1426@xmath1428 and pks 2155@xmath0304 , in which synchrotron emission from the jets dominates up through the x - ray component .",
    "we will use idv data to search for qpos ( quasi - periodic oscillations ) and variability timescales in the light curves ( lcs ) of these hbls , recalling that the shortest timescales can give upper limits to the sizes of the emitting regions .",
    "when a blazar is in a low flux state it is possible that an accretion disk related component of the x - ray emission is dominant and then any idv timescale could give an estimate of the mass of the black hole presumed to reside at the center of the galaxy ( e.g. , gupta et al .",
    "2008 , 2009 ) .",
    "this possibility arises from the fact that some blazars show evidence of the `` big blue bump '' that is almost certainly indicative of accretion disk emission ( e.g. , raiteri et al .",
    "2007 ) while in their low states , when the jets are weak or even absent . under these circumstances",
    "the x - ray corona expected above such disks and observed in radio - quiet agn should be visible .",
    "a break in the power spectral density ( psd ) plot from intra - day lcs can also yield the black hole mass of the blazar ( e.g. , uttley 2007 ) .",
    "xmm - newton idv lcs also may possibly be used to make independent estimations of the doppler factors of the blazars ( fan , xie & bacon 1999 ) .",

    "observations in the uv by the international ultraviolet explorer of pks 2155@xmath0304 seemed to show a short - lived quasi - period of @xmath70.7 day , but only a few cycles were present , so it was not a firm detection ( urry et al .",
    "recently , we have shown nominally very strong evidence for a @xmath74.6 hour qpo in this source in xmm - newton observations made on 1 may 2006 ; but again , as only @xmath74 cycles of this fluctuation were seen during about 18 hours of the observation , the qpo indication is not iron - clad ( lachowicz et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "the blazar pks 2155@xmath0304 was continuously monitored by xmm - newton for 57.2 , 44.5 , 29.8 , 49.8 , 28.8 , and 60.6 ks on 19 november 2000 , 30 november 2001 , 24 may 2002 , 30 november 2005 , 07 november 2006 , and 12 may 2008 , respectively .",
    "there was no evidence for timescales on those days .",
    "these lcs and their sfs are plotted in figs .",
    "as the sf plots of all these light curves show continuous rising trends , any variability timescale for these lcs are longer than the lengths of their data trains .",
    "this source also was continuously monitored for 37.9 ks on 30 may 2000 , 59.2 ks on 31 may 2000 , 58.1 ks on 20 november 2000 , 31.7 ks on 24 may 2002 , 56.7 ks on 29 november 2002 , 39.8 ks on 23 november 2004 , and 48.0 ks on 22 april 2007 and during these observations indications of timescales were found .",
    "these lcs and their sfs are also plotted in figs .  1 and 2 .",
    "each of these sf plots show a continuous rising trend followed by a dip .",
    "these dips indicate possible variability time scales of 24.2 ks , 41.2 ks , 16.0 ks , 24.2 ks , 26.8 ks , 15.7 ks and 41.4 ks , respectively .    during the second observation made of pks 2155@xmath0304 on 24 may 2002 )",
    ", we detected four dips in the sf that might indicate a weak qpo signal ( see the fourth row of fig .",
    "3 ) . for this data set",
    "the sf remains quite flat for the first @xmath7 5.3 ks , indicative of white noise domination at short lags or high frequencies ( e.g. , paltani et al .",
    "the sf then rises to a peak at 8.8 ks , indicating a timescale of 3.5 ks , where we follow paltani et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and subtract the 5.3 ks before the sf started its rise . the first dip in the sf is at @xmath712.2 ks , providing a hint of a period at 6.9 ks ( @xmath51 ks ) . the timescales for the subsequent rises to peaks following minima are 2.6 ks , 2.5 ks and 3.0 ks , while the three subsequent dips yield `` periods '' of 4.8 ks , 4.6 ks and 7.0 ks , as measured from the previous dips .",
    "although these times between dips are clearly not the same , and therefore do not give a clear indication of a single period , if one averages the four `` periods '' obtained from the dip intervals them one obtains a broad `` quasi - period '' of @xmath52 ks , although two separate timescales of @xmath53 ks and @xmath54 ks are an alternative possibility . for the same observation ,",
    "the psd analysis provides us with a possible indication of a weak ( @xmath55 ) peak centered around @xmath56  hz ( see fig .  3 ) .",
    "that would also suggest a qpo period of @xmath57  ks , which is , coincidentally , a value close to that we noted for a possible qpo in on  231 .",
    "a quantitative analysis of all 14 psds of pks 2155@xmath0304 allowed us to find its broad - band x - ray variability to be very well described for most observations by a single power - law component denoting red - noise at lower frequencies with white noise present at high frequencies . as seen from figs .",
    "24 , for about half of these data sets this power - law extended over the great majority of the frequency band we could measure , while for the other half the white noise dominated a significant portion of it .",
    "the results of the best fit slope values over the red - noise dominated portions are given in table 2 and range from @xmath58 . in the data discussed here the only hint of quasi - periodic variability detected in the x - ray psds of this was the observation on 24 may 2002 mentioned in the previous paragraph .",
    "the generally accepted models for the strong variability in blazars on ltv timescales ( months to decades ) involve shocks propagating down relativistic jets pointing close to the direction from which we observe them ( e.g.  scheuer & readhead 1979 ; marsher & gear 1985 ; wagner & witzel 1995 ) .",
    "these shocks moving through jets almost certainly dominate the fluctuations in bl lacs at essentially all phases and in fsrqs when they are in high flux states .",
    "the shorter stv and idv variations can be most simply explained in terms of irregularities in the jet flows and any possible periodic variability has been suggested to arise from shocks passing through nearly helical structures in a jet ( e.g. , camenzind & krockenberger 1992 ) , by jets whose orientation with respect to us changes ( e.g. , gopal - krishna & wiita 1992 ) or by turbulence behind a shock ( marscher , gear & travis 1992 ) .",
    "instabilities on or above accretion disks also should play a role in luminosity fluctuations for fsrqs , particularly in lower luminosity states , and they presumably dominate in non - blazar agns such as seyfert galaxies ( e.g. , abramowicz et al .  1991 ; mangalam & wiita 1993 ; wagner & witzel 1995 ) .    the x - ray emission we are concerned with here , however , is unlikely to arise from the disk itself and is usually attributed to coronal flares above the disk in non - blazar agn ( e.g.  di matteo 1998 ) and to jet emission in blazars ( e.g.  bttcher 2007 ) .",
    "some recent work has argued that the nuclear emission in low luminosity radio - loud agns indicates that the accretion disk is radiatively inefficient ( e.g. , balmaverde et al .  2006 ; balmaverde & capetti 2006 ) . if this is correct , the emission in even the low luminosity radio - loud agns that are likely the parent population of bl lacs is dominated by non - thermal emission from the base of the jet .",
    "now x - ray flares not far above the inner part of a disk might well have fluctuations closely related to the disk s orbital period .",
    "as most of the quasi - thermal radiation from an accretion disk emerges from its innermost portion , the relevant orbital period and/or size of the emitting region is most likely to be at , or at least close to , that of the last stable circular orbit around the central supermassive black hole ( smbh ) that is allowed by general relativity .",
    "if the variability does arise in this way , then one can compute a rough estimate of the mass , @xmath59 , of the smbh which is proportional to the period ( e.g , gupta et al .",
    "2009 ) : @xmath60^{-1 } ( 1+z)^{-1}\\ ] ] where @xmath61 is a period of some fluctuations ( in seconds ) , @xmath62 is the radius of the emitting region within the disk in units of @xmath63 and @xmath64 is the dimensionless bh angular momentum parameter . for the possible periods of @xmath65 ks seen in one pks 2155@xmath0304 data set and in the single on 231 data set",
    "this corresponds to @xmath66 m@xmath4 for a non - rotating smbh ( with @xmath67 , the last stable circular orbit for a disk around a schwarzschild bh with @xmath68 ) and @xmath69 m@xmath4 for a rapidly rotating smbh ( with @xmath70 , the last stable circular orbit for a co - rotating disk around an physically maximally spinning bh with @xmath71 ; e.g. , thorne 1974 ) .",
    "we again wish to stress that neither of those qpo signals are statistically significant , as their peaks in the psd plots do not reach the usually adopted @xmath21 threshold ( vaughan 2005 ) for significance of a qpo with respect to the underlying red - noise source variability defined by a single power - law model .    still , because most blazar emission is expected to arise from jets that are launched from the immediate vicinity of the smbh rather than the disk or its corona , ( e.g.  marscher et al .",
    "2008 ) , the observed timescale , @xmath72 , of any fluctuation is likely to be reduced with respect to the rest - frame timescale , @xmath73 , by the doppler factor , @xmath74 , as well as increased by a factor of @xmath75 . as usual , the doppler factor , @xmath74 , is defined in terms of the velocity of the jet ( and/or the shock propagating down the jet ) , @xmath76 , and the angle between the jet and the observer s line - of - sight , @xmath77 , as @xmath78^{-1}$ ] ; we have adopted the standard notation , @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "hence , @xmath81 . from very high energy gamma - ray observations of pks 0548@xmath0322 ,",
    "@xmath82 was estimated ( superina et al .",
    "radio observations indicate that on 231 has @xmath83 ( wu et al .  2007 ; hovatta et al .  2009 ) . from integral observations at 150 kev ,",
    "@xmath84 27.3 was proposed for 1es 1426@xmath1428 ( wolter et al .",
    "finally , from high to very high energy gamma@xmath0ray observations @xmath8530 was obtained for pks 2155@xmath0304 ( urry et al .",
    "1997 ; ghisellini & tavecchio 2008 ) .",
    "the fluctuations could be induced by the disk rotation and then advected into the jet where they could become responsible for variations in the jet density , velocity or magnetic field ( e.g. , wiita 2006 ) . in that case",
    "the amplitude of the variation would be greatly enhanced by doppler boosting ( roughly as @xmath86 ) while time - compressed by @xmath87 ( e.g. , gopal - krishna et al .",
    "this boosting could possibly make even weak disk variations detectable once amplified by the jets . in that case",
    "the smbh mass estimates would rise by a factor of @xmath74 .",
    "taking the average of the @xmath74 values quoted for on 231 ( 3.2 ) , the nominal smbh mass estimates would rise to @xmath88 m@xmath4 for the non - rotating case and @xmath89 m@xmath4 for the rapidly spinning case .",
    "if @xmath90 for pks 2155@xmath0304 then the estimates for the smbh mass would be between @xmath91 m@xmath4 and @xmath92 m@xmath4 , with the bounds corresponding to non- and rapidly- rotating situations .",
    "such higher values are in better agreement with most estimates for the masses of smbhs , ( @xmath93 m@xmath4 ) in powerful radio loud agn ( e.g. , dunlop et al .",
    "2003 ) , but those masses may not be directly applicable to hbls . because the galaxies surrounding the agn in most hbls , including on 231 and pks 2155@xmath0304 , are barely detected and the optical spectra of the agn are essentially featureless , no other techniques usually can be applied to provide alternative smbh mass estimates for these hbls .",
    "however , to give an indicative mass for an hbl , we note that stellar velocity dispersions have been measured for a number of low-@xmath94 bl lacs , including 0548@xmath0322 , for which a smbh mass of @xmath95m@xmath4 has been estimated ( barth , ho & sargent 2003 ) .",
    "from our structure function analysis of high quality archival x - ray light curves of four hbls taken by the xmm - newton epic / pn detector between may 2000 to may 2008 , we found only one apparently significant possible detection of a qpo which we have presented in detail elsewhere ( lachowicz et al .",
    "this was discovered using the sf method for pks 2155@xmath0304 at a timescale of @xmath9616.7 ks .",
    "this estimated qpo was confirmed by three other essentially independent methods , viz , a periodogram analysis , a wavelet analysis and a careful power spectrum density analysis along the lines of vaughan ( 2005 ) that gave a probability of @xmath97 that a real signal had been seen ; however , the short length of the data train compared to the nominal period still means that we can not make a firm claim for the presence of a qpo ( lachowicz et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "here we have presented the remaining 23 lcs , none of which showed any significant detections of qpos .",
    "one out of these 14 observations of pks 2155@xmath0304 showed four dips in the sf , which might conceivably indicate a a broad qpo around 5.8 ks but a psd analysis of the same observation gave a only a very weak hint of one at 5.9 ks .",
    "the one data set available for on 231 showed three dips in the sf that did not provide any significant period while the psd analysis gave a weak signal corresponding to a possible qpo around 5.9 ks .",
    "we stress that no significant signal was seen in the psd plots for any of these 23 observations .",
    "we did find evidence for time scales ranging from 15.7 ks to 46.8 ks in eight additional lcs using sf analyses ; one of these was for 1es 1426@xmath1428 and the other seven for pks 2155@xmath0304 .",
    "combining our new results for pks 2155@xmath0304 along with those of urry et al .",
    "( 1993 ) and lachowicz et al .",
    "( 2009 ) it is clear that this blazar is well worth continued observations to search for timescales and possible qpos . for the remaining 13 lcs ,",
    "any variability timescale that may be present seems to be longer than the length of the x - ray data sets , which ranged from 29 to 68 ks . for none of these data sets",
    "were the individual measurements long enough to clearly see a break in the psd at low frequencies that could also provide a handle on smbh masses ( e.g. , marshall , ryle & miller 2007 ) .",
