    "flat rotation curves in spiral galaxies ( @xcite ) , dynamics and gravitational lensing in early - type galaxies ( etgs ; ellipticals and lenticulars ) , and in clusters of galaxies ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) are usually modelled using the classical newtonian theory of gravity . in this context",
    ", vast amounts of dark matter ( dm ) are inferred , in consonance with the standard cosmology ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and with the modern understanding of galaxy evolution as seeded by the collapse of dm haloes ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , the nature of dm is still not clear , with no direct experimental detection of dm particles . in this context",
    ", it should be recalled that newtonian dynamics has never been experimentally tested in the extremely weak - field limit as in the outskirts of galaxies .",
    "an alternative phenomenological framework was proposed by @xcite , in which newton s second law of dynamics becomes @xmath1 , where the acceleration @xmath2 is related to the newtonian one  by @xmath3 . here , 0  @xmath4 is an universal constant and @xmath5 is an arbitrary function with the limiting behaviours @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "this model , referred to as modified newtonian dynamics ( mond ) , reproduces the flat rotation curves of spiral galaxies without recourse to undetectable dm , and provides a natural explanation for the observed relation between galaxy rotation and luminosity @xcite or baryonic mass ( @xcite ) .",
    "thirty years after its introduction , mond remains remarkably successful on galaxy scales , but the conclusions to date have been largely based on late - type galaxies .",
    "only a few analyses have been carried out on etgs ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , and it is not clear if they can be integrated consistently into the mond framework .",
    "the difficulty with etgs has been the lack of a large , homogeneous sample with high - quality dynamical analysis .",
    "these criteria are not yet met for the ideal case where kinematical data extend to large radii , but the advent of the 3d  survey @xcite entails a remarkable opportunity to test mond in the centers of etgs .",
    "3d  provides a sample of 260 local etgs with central masses estimated both by dynamics and by stellar population synthesis ( sps ) .",
    "the latter aspect is critical since the stars comprise the dominant component of the central mass , even in models with dm included .",
    "however , standard sps modelling is hindered by the uncertain stellar initial mass function ( imf ) , and the 3dteam have taken a purely dynamical approach , where the total mass is decomposed into stars and dm , assuming newtonian gravity and standard dm halo models .",
    "the resulting stellar masses imply strong variations in the imf , in agreement with many recent studies ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "our aim in this paper is to revisit the 3d  results in the context of mond .",
    "can the central dynamics of etgs be reproduced with mond and a standard , fixed imf ?",
    "alternatively , is mond consistent with current claims for a variable imf ?",
    "the dynamical approach we adopt provides an estimate for the imf `` normalization '' , which we can not unambiguously relate to the slope of the bottom- or top - end of the imf . throughout the present paper and in agreement with other works",
    "we will interpret our results in terms of variations in the fraction of low - mass stars .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "[ sec : data ] we describe our dynamical methods and the data to be analyzed . in sect .",
    "[ sec : results ] we discuss the results of the paper , which are the constraints on the acceleration scale and on the imf .",
    "conclusions are made in sect .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "we perform our analysis on a sample of local etgs from the 3d  survey ( @xcite ) .",
    "about 15% of the full sample have significant gradients of the stellar mass - to - light ratio ( ) implied by their young stellar populations ( h@xmath8 equivalent width greater than 2.3   ) , so we omit these cases and retain a sample of 224 galaxies .",
    "the relevant data for each galaxy include a ) the effective radius , , b ) the projected stellar velocity dispersion , , within a circularized aperture of radius , the @xmath9-band c ) total luminosity @xmath10 and d ) stellar  ( @xmath11 ) derived by sps fitting of the spectra with @xcite models and a @xcite imf .",
    "the @xcite imf yields stellar masses that are @xmath12 dex smaller .",
    "it is important to note that the published @xmath10 and  values are not self - consistent .",
    "the former correspond to detailed multi - gaussian expansion ( mge ) fits that extend to typically @xmath13  4  .",
    "the latter are the mge - based values renormalized by a factor of 1.35 to correspond to more conventional estimates from the literature . here",
    "we will use these  values , but adjust each @xmath10 value such that the projected luminosity inside for our adopted de vaucouleurs model is the same as in the original mge model .",
    "this extrapolation means @xmath10 is typically increased by a factor of @xmath14 .",
    "the basic assumptions of mond are as follows .    1 .",
    "standard dynamics is not valid in the limit of low accelerations , such that the gravitational acceleration @xmath15 differs from the newtonian one @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the total mass involved ( dm + stars ) .",
    "the mondian @xmath15 reduces to the newtonian one at high accelerations .",
    "2 .   in the low - acceleration limit",
    ", the acceleration is given by @xmath18 , where 0 is the mond acceleration constant .",
    "thanks to this limit the rotation curves are flat and it is possible to recover the @xcite relation .",
    "the transition from the newtonian regime to the low acceleration regime occurs around a characteristic acceleration scale 0  ( @xcite ) .",
    "unless otherwise stated , we adopt the standard value of @xmath19  m  s@xmath20 , as calibrated from spiral galaxy dynamics ( @xcite ) .    to connect the low- and high - acceleration regimes , a general formula is needed , which reduces to the low - acceleration limit as in ( ii ) .",

    "one recovers the newtonian theory when @xmath22 and the deep mond regime when @xmath23 .",
    "we adopt the following expressions : a ) our reference choice @xmath24 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and b ) @xmath25 , which was the first one successfully tested ( @xcite ) .",
    "our dynamical approach is based on the spherical jeans equations , relating the acceleration @xmath2 to the mass as follows : @xmath26}{dr } + \\frac{2 \\beta(r)}{r } j(r ) \\sigma_{r}^{2}(r)=-\\rho(r ) g ( r ) , \\label{eq : jeans}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is the deprojected luminosity profile , @xmath28 is the radial velocity dispersion and @xmath29 is the velocity dispersion anisotropy ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we adopt isotropic models ( i.e. @xmath30 ) as our default , but we will also examine the impact of anisotropy .",
    "we assume no dm , thus @xmath31 ( from sps ) and @xmath32 .",
    "we approximate the deprojected de vaucouleurs profile with an analytic expression from @xcite . assuming that  is constant with radius , the mass density profile is @xmath33 and the mass profile @xmath34 is easily derived ( see @xcite ) .",
    "thus , in eq .",
    "( [ eq : jeans ] ) , @xmath27 , @xmath5 and @xmath35 and @xmath15 are given and @xmath36 can be derived by simple integration . finally , to match the",
    "observed aperture averaged velocity dispersion , we project @xmath36 along the line of sight and within a circular aperture ( see @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we begin with vanilla mond - modelling assumptions of fixed 0  and imf , and investigate how well a critical observable is reproduced : the relation between stellar mass and velocity dispersion ( @xcite ) .",
    "we compare the 3d  observations with predictions from jeans equations , where we have adopted the median ",
    "relation from the observations , fixed 0  to the standard value and assumed a varying imf , parameterized in terms of the `` imf mismatch parameter '' @xmath37 .",
    "the latter relates the dynamical  to the  values from sps modelling with a fixed milky - way type imf , @xmath38 , assumed as a chabrier imf @xcite .",
    "we see in fig .",
    "[ fig : fj ] that at low masses the data are less scattered and mond with a chabrier imf ( @xmath39 line ) predicts  values that agree on average with the 3d  observations . at higher masses ,",
    "the  are underpredicted by a factor of @xmath13  1.5 on average , and require a bottom - heavier imf for a good match .",
    "our initial impression from this simple check is that mond is discordant with a universal imf .",
    "however , there are additional correlations with  to consider which would require a thorough analysis of the fundamental plane ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . we will instead turn from the space of observables to model space , where we adjust the input parameters in order to better fit the data .",
    "we also notice that the imf variation is mild if considered in terms of stellar mass , while in the following we will discuss the variable imf scenario in terms of ( @xcite ) .",
    "our first exercise in model fitting is to consider an alternative value of the universal constant 0 , thus allowing for relative systematics between late - type and early - type galaxy modelling .",
    "we treat 0  as a free parameter for each of the 3d  galaxies , where the goal is to see if the ensemble of 0  estimates scatters around a single consensus value .",
    "[ fig : a0 ] shows the results , where the galaxies have been placed in some bins of . assuming a chabrier imf ( top panel )",
    ", we find that on average , the galaxies are fitted with @xmath40 , larger than the standard value of @xmath41 .",
    "this is too large a difference to attribute to errors , and we conclude that mond requires more mass in the central parts of etgs .",
    "smaller 0values are found if we assume a @xcite imf ( middle panel ) .",
    "if we instead adopt a salpeter imf ( bottom panel ) , we indeed find that , on average , @xmath42 is found . for a large fraction of galaxies the inferred 0  values are very small , departing from the standard value by several orders of magnitudes and approaching newtonian gravity .",
    "however , this is not the whole story , as there is a residual trend for 0  to increase with  ( for both choices of @xmath5 ) . since again",
    ", 0  is meant to be a universal constant , we conclude that mond is incompatible with a universal imf , and we next examine imf variations .",
    "we now return to fixing 0  to its standard value , and instead allow @xmath11 to vary on a galaxy - by - galaxy basis in order for mond to fit the data .",
    "the results are discussed in terms of the imf mismatch , , and plotted as a function of  in fig .",
    "[ fig : imf ] . assuming @xmath43",
    ", there is a striking systematic variation from @xmath44 ( chabrier - like ) for the lowest-  galaxies , to @xmath45 ( near - salpeter ) at the highest . with an alternative interpolating formula , @xmath46 , the mondian effects are weaker and the implied @xmath47 values are slightly higher , but the trend with  remains .",
    "the results are also unchanged if the high quality data are adopted ( see red line in fig .  [",
    "fig : imf ] for @xmath43 ) .",
    "another piece of information is given by comparison with the results from a constant-  model with no dm within a newtonian scenario ( see purple line in the left panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : imf ] ) .",
    "the only difference with the mond models is the change of the gravity theory .",
    "this model gives  values which are , on average , @xmath48 dex larger than the mond results using @xmath49 , and quite similar to the ones using @xmath50 , suggesting that @xmath50 gives a very tiny modification of the gravity .",
    "we conclude that _ mond requires a strong imf variation _ in order to be consistent with the 3ddata .",
    "our dynamical models are limited in their assumptions of sphericity and isotropy .",
    "we explore radially anisotropic models with values of @xmath51 , which produce elevated  values but only enough to reduce  by @xmath13  10% .",
    "the general effect of galaxy flattening would be for a spherical model to over- and under - estimate the mass when a galaxy is edge - on and face - on , respectively .",
    "we have analyzed a relatively face - on subsample by selecting only the roundest galaxies ( ellipticity at  of @xmath52 ) .",
    "the ensuing reduction in is very weak , and does not negate the trend with .    as a final check ,",
    "we make use of the self - consistent `` jam '' dynamical modelling results , @xmath53 , from @xcite , which assume that mass follows the light and include flattening , anisotropy and more detailed luminosity profiles .",
    "although these models were constructed using newtonian dynamics , we exploit the general insensitivity of the inferred circular velocities to the details of the mass profile shapes ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and use the results as a fair approximation for what mond predictions would be in a fully self - consistent dynamical model . given a stellar mass",
    "as estimated from sps , and the associated newtonian acceleration @xmath54 , the corresponding acceleration predicted by mond for our default interpolating function is @xmath55 ( @xcite ) .",
    "after algebraic manipulation , we find @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the apparent dynamical  for an observer who interprets observations with newtonian dynamics , and @xmath58 is the stellar  for a fixed milky - way ( chabrier ) imf .",
    "given the standard value for 0 , setting @xmath59 , @xmath60 and calculating all the quantities at @xmath61 , we estimate @xmath62 on a galaxy - by - galaxy basis . as shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : imf ] , the results are very similar to ours using direct , spherical isotropic mond models .",
    "we conclude that the mondian imf variation is robust to the details of the dynamical models .",
    "it is now interesting to compare our mond - based results with those we obtain within a standard newtonian scenario .",
    "following @xcite we adopt an alternative model accounting for a dm halo .",
    "it is based on a @xcite profile for the dm distribution plus a @xcite profile for the stars . for the virial mass and concentration ( @xmath64 , @xmath65 )",
    ", we adopt mean trends for a wmap5 cosmology @xcite , while for the ",
    "relation we used @xcite .",
    "interestingly , our result for @xmath66 is fully consistent with the nfw+stars model and thus with the @xmath63cdm expectations ( short - dashed line in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : imf ] ) .",
    "this suggests that @xmath63cdm and mond are functionally equivalent .    finally , to illustrate the level of systematic uncertainties for a method , we have also plotted in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : imf ] the medians for the dm case ( almost similar to our nfw+stars model ) from the results obtained by the jeans anisotropic models in @xcite ( see their table 1 ) .",
    "the agreement is very good .",
    "we have analyzed the dynamical properties of a sample of @xmath67 etgs from the 3d  survey within a mondian framework . we have performed a jeans analysis of the observed velocity dispersions and discussed the results in terms of the mond recipe details and imf .    as a preliminary analysis ,",
    "we have discussed how the observed @xcite relation can be reproduced by mond , for fixed 0  and imf ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fj ] ) . although not conclusive , we find hints of non - universality of 0  or imf .",
    "thus , we determined 0  for different choices of the imf , finding a trend with  ( fig .",
    "[ fig : a0 ] ) , but since 0  is meant to be a universal constant of the theory , we conclude that mond is incompatible with a universal imf . to quantify this result",
    "we have fixed 0  to its standard value and allowed  to vary .    following previous literature",
    "we focus on the  mismatch relative to a chabrier imf , . consistently with analysis involving spectral features",
    "( @xcite ; @xcite ) or dynamical and lensing analysis within a newtonian scenario ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) _ we demonstrate that within a mond framework a strong imf variation is required _ ( fig .",
    "[ fig : imf ] ) .",
    "we find a bottom - lighter imf at low - and bottom - heavier at large .",
    "some differences are found in terms of the interpolating function : @xmath68 gives values which are fully consistent with @xmath63cdm predictions , while assuming @xmath69 the gravity is only weakly modified , such that the  values are consistent with what is found assuming a constant-  profile with no dm .",
    "further investigations involving combined dynamical / lensing or extended kinematical data in etgs are necessary to probe the galactic dynamics to their outskirts , where the stellar mass density is low and the dynamics modification is more important . probing different regions of the gravitational potential , we can provide clearer constraints on the velocity dispersion anisotropy , the interpolating function and the imf within a newtonian scenario as well as in mond or different modified gravity theories ( @xcite ) .",
    "further analysis will investigate a more general interpolating function , @xmath70 , and test whether any combination of @xmath71 parameters can remove the imf trends . finally , to have a fully consistent mondian picture , one can test whether the varying imf scenario can ease mond tensions in the centers of clusters ( @xcite ) and in gravitational lenses ( @xcite ) with the help of a bottom - heavier imf , and in the very low mass dsph galaxies in the local group ( @xcite ) , by the adoption of a top - heavier imf .",
