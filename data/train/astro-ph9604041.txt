    "davis and peebles ( 1983 , hereafter dp83 ) calculated the velocity dispersion of galaxies , @xmath1 , on scales of @xmath3 for the cfa1 redshift survey , a survey containing 1840 redshifts covering 1.83 steradians in the north galactic hemisphere ( huchra et al .",
    "their result , @xmath4 km / s on scales of @xmath5 mpc , became the standard by which n - body simulations were judged for perhaps ten years , and a primary argument against the cold dark matter scenario for structure formation with the assumption that galaxies trace the mass fluctuations in an unbiased way , which yields much higher velocities on this scale ( e.g. , davis et al .",
    "1985 , gelb & bertschinger 1994 ) .",
    "the same calculation was done on the southern sky redshift survey ( ssrs1 , da costa et al .",
    "1991 ) , with results of @xmath6 km / s ( davis 1988 ) , in apparent agreement with the cfa1 result .",
    "it is only recently that there have been attempts to reproduce the results of dp83 ( mo , jing , & borner 1993 , zurek et al . 1994 ) , and to perform this analysis on new , larger redshift surveys ( fisher et al .",
    "1994a , 1994b , marzke et al .",
    "1995 , guzzo et al .",
    "it is now apparent that there is a large variation in @xmath2 between different surveys ( see table 1 ) .",
    "in addition , different workers ( mo et al .",
    "1993 , zurek et al .",
    "1994 ) obtain very different results ( from dp83 and from each other ) when they analyze the cfa1 survey . in this paper",
    "we clarify some details of the original calculation of dp83 which were not spelled out in the original paper , and present a reanalysis which shows why the results are so unstable .",
    "we also reproduce the earlier results for ssrs1 ( davis 1988 ) , and investigate how removing clusters affects @xmath2 .",
    "in this section we briefly describe the method used to extract the pairwise velocity dispersion @xmath2 from the redshift - space correlation function @xmath7 .",
    "readers should refer to dp83 and fisher et al .",
    "( 1994a , b ) for more details .",
    "the correlation function in redshift space , @xmath8 , is estimated by counting the number of pairs in a bin in @xmath9 ( separation perpendicular to the line of sight ) and @xmath10 ( separation parallel to the line of sight ) .",
    "it is normalized by constructing a catalog of poisson distributed points with the same selection function and angular limits as the data , and counting pairs between the data and the poisson catalog . @xmath11 where dd is the number of pairs between data and data , and dr is number of pairs between the data catalog and a poisson catalog .",
    "the quantities @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the minimum variance weighted densities ( see davis & huchra 1982 ) of the poisson and data catalogs , respectively .",
    "let @xmath14 be the distribution function of velocity differences @xmath15 for pairs of galaxies with vector separation @xmath16 , and @xmath17 the velocity distribution function averaged over the directions perpendicular to the line of sight .",
    "the first moment of @xmath14 , @xmath18 , is the mean streaming velocity relative to the hubble flow , and from isotropy it must be a function only of the magnitude of @xmath16 .",
    "correspondingly , the first moment of @xmath17 is @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the component of @xmath16 along the line of sight .",
    "a reasonable form for the distribution function @xmath21 , parameterized by its moments , is @xmath22^{n}\\right)\\ ] ] it has been found emperically from studying observations and n - body simulations ( peebles 1976 , fisher et al .",
    "1994b , zurek et al .",
    "1994 , marzke et al . 1995 ) that on small scales an exponential form ( n=1 ) fits the data better than a gaussian ( n=2 ) or any higher power of the argument .",
    "adopting this form for @xmath23 , and using @xmath24 and @xmath25 we have : @xmath26 \\exp \\left[\\frac{-\\sqrt{2}}{\\sigma_{12}(r ) }   \\left| \\pi- h_0 y \\left[1 - \\frac{\\overline{v_{12}}(r)}{h_{0}r } \\right ] \\right| \\right ]    \\label{eq : modelxi}\\ ] ] an approximation based on self - similar solutions of the bbgky hierarachy suggests a form for @xmath18 ( davis & peebles 1977 ) : @xmath27 }   \\label{eq : infall}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 is an adjustable parameter of the model .",
    "the assumption of stable clustering ( that the collapse of the cluster is exactly balanced by the hubble flow ) leads to f = 1 .",
    "dp83 investigated different values of f but the usually quoted result is for f=1 .",
    "the velocity dispersion @xmath1 is obtained by fitting the model of equation  ( [ eq : modelxi ] ) to @xmath29 as estimated from equation  ( [ eq : xi ] ) .",
    "in the cfa1 survey , the virgo cluster dominates the foreground of the sample . at the time when the analysis of dp83 was done , an accepted approach to correcting for the infall of our galaxy and",
    "other galaxies into virgo was to assume a spherical infall model . in this model the infall velocity of any galaxy was taken to be inversely proportional to the galaxy s distance from virgo and the model was scaled so that the infall of the local group had the then - favored value of 440 km / s ( currently favored values are 200 - 300 km / s ) . therefore in dp83 the redshift of each galaxy was corrected both for the infall of the local group , and for its own infall into virgo .",
    "each redshift was also corrected for galactic rotation using a rotation velocity of 220 km / s .",
    "we will subsequently refer to the correction to each galaxy s distance due to the infall of the local group towards virgo , plus the galactic rotation correction , as the `` dipole '' correction , and the correction due to each galaxy s own infall into virgo ( plus galactic rotation and the dipole correction ) as the `` inverse - virgo - distance '' or @xmath30 correction .",
    "there are two stages of the procedure in which these corrections may be applied .",
    "first , there is the distance used in calculating an absolute magnitude , used to create a semi - volume limited catalog by eliminatating all galaxies with absolute magnitude @xmath31 .",
    "second , there is the velocity used in calculating the correlation function @xmath32 .",
    "the choice of which corrections are to be used in each of these quantities is important , as we shall see .",
    "it could be argued that infall corrections should only be applied to the velocities used as distances for the volume limiting .",
    "the method we use here to extract @xmath2 relies on measuring the distortion of @xmath32 due to peculiar velocities , so in general one would not want to use corrected velocities in the pair counting to compute @xmath32 .",
    "however , in the cfa1 sample the shear due to the presence of the virgo cluster in the foreground is so large that it could be argued that some correction is needed even in the velocities used in pair - counting .    because the inverse - virgo - distance model is singular near virgo ,",
    "dp83 applied the infall corrections differently depending on which region of the survey a galaxy was in .",
    "define the `` inner virgo core '' as all galaxies with @xmath33 and @xmath34 km / s , where @xmath35 is the angle with respect to the center of the virgo cluster ( @xmath36 , @xmath37 ) and @xmath38 is the redshift , the `` outer core '' as galaxies with @xmath39 and @xmath34 , and the `` field '' as all the remaining galaxies .",
    "note that the determination of whether a galaxy is assigned to the virgo core depends on which of the velocities ( uncorrected , dipole corrected or inverse - virgo - distance corrected ) is used for the velocity condition .",
    "dp83 used the inverse - virgo - corrected velocity .",
    "table 2 defines various permutations of `` cuts '' , or ways of applying the different corrections in the different regions of the survey .",
    "the entry cut  1 shows the choices necessary to reproduce the original results of dp83 .",
    "this reflects our discovery , in the course of this reanalysis , that the inner core of virgo was inadvertantly deleted in the original analysis due to a typographical error in the computer program used to obtain the results presented in dp83 .",
    "the entry cut  2 is what dp83 intended to do : the mean velocity of the virgo cluster ( @xmath40 = 1460 km / s ) is assigned to all galaxies in the inner core for the volume limiting , the dipole corrected velocities are used in pair counting in the inner core , and in both the volume limiting and pair counting in the outer core , and the inverse - virgo - distance corrected velocities are used in the field .",
    "note that this value of @xmath40 is the measured mean redshift of virgo , 1020 km / s , plus the dipole correction for the infall of the local group , 440 km / s . cut  3 is the same as cut  2 except that the inverse - virgo - distance correction is not used in the pair counting .",
    "cut  4 uses the mean virgo redshift for the volume limiting in the inner core , but uses only the dipole correction in all the other regions .",
    "this is to enable us to disentangle the effect of using the mean virgo velocity in the inner core from the effect of the inverse - virgo - distance correction .",
    "we now know that a simple spherical infall model is not a very good model for the flow field around the virgo cluster . even in the relatively low mass virgo cluster favored by the faber - burstein great attractor flow model ,",
    "the redshift - distance relation is triple valued within @xmath41 of virgo ( nolthenius 1993 ) . in order to study",
    "the effects of using of the spherical infall model , cut  5 and cut  6 include only the dipole correction in all the regions of the survey .",
    "cut  5 includes the correction in the pair counting whereas cut  6 does not .",
    "finally , we show the result obtained if no corrections at all are applied to the redshifts at any stage in the procedure .",
    "we also show the result where no corrections are applied but all clusters with internal velocity dispersion greater than 500 km / s have been removed using an automated cluster - removing program ( see somerville , primack , & nolthenius 1996 ) .    figure  [ fig : dp83 ] shows the results for @xmath1 for each of the cuts .",
    "as can be seen the results are very sensitive to the way in which the cuts are applied .",
    "note that the scale dependence of @xmath2 with @xmath42 also changes significantly depending on the way the corrections are applied . in all cases",
    "the slope is steeper than the original result of dp83 .",
    "one can understand these results qualitatively as follows .",
    "in cut  6 , the dipole correction assigns larger distances to all the galaxies , especially those in the virgo core .",
    "this makes the galaxies seem more luminous and more of them make it into the volume - limited catalog . in cut  6 ,",
    "42 galaxies from the virgo core are included in the volume - limited catalog , as compared to 29 when no corrections are used .",
    "the galaxies in the virgo core have large pairwise velocities , and @xmath2 is pair - weighted , so this increases @xmath2 considerably",
    ". cut  5 consists of the same galaxies as cut  6 , but using the dipole corrected velocities to calculate @xmath32 reduces the velocity dispersion of the virgo cluster and hence the measured @xmath2 for the sample .",
    "the differences in @xmath2 for cut  3 , cut  4 , and cut  5 are not significant - the correlation functions appear very similar , and it is only because the correlation functions are very noisy at large @xmath10 that different values of @xmath2 are obtained .",
    "the values are within the ( large ) formal errors on the fit .",
    "this implies that using the mean virgo redshift for the galaxies in the inner core of virgo did not have a large effect on the results . in cut  2 ,",
    "galaxies with @xmath43 km / s , the cutoff for the virgo core , are assigned larger velocities due to the @xmath30 correction .",
    "this whole band of galaxies is therefore moved farther away from the virgo core , reducing the number of pairs containing virgo galaxies which fall in the 1 @xmath44 bin , and reducing @xmath45 .",
    "finally , not surprisingly , removing the virgo core altogether reduces @xmath2 significantly , as can be seen in cut  1 .",
    "our analysis of the ssrs1 survey yields @xmath46 km / s ( ssrs1 ) , which is in agreement with previous results ( davis 1988 , mo et al .",
    "the ssrs1 survey does not contain any rich foreground clusters , and therefore the original analysis was not complicated by any infall corrections .",
    "unlike cfa1 , when we remove the clusters from ssrs1 using the cluster - removal routine , the value of @xmath45 does not change significantly ( see figure  [ fig : sigdata ] ) .",
    "this suggests that @xmath2 for cfa1 is dominated by the virgo cluster and that the ssrs1 value is more typical of the field .",
    "however , the analysis of existing redshift surveys does not yet allow a definite conclusion .",
    "removing clusters appears to reduce sample - to - sample variation in @xmath2 ( see table 3 ) but work on simulations ( somerville et al .",
    "1996 ) suggests that this will also reduce the ability of the statistic to discriminate between different cosmological models .",
    "we hope that this paper has removed the confusion regarding the value of the velocity dispersion in the cfa1 survey .",
    "we have shown that the value of the velocity dispersion is extremely sensitive to the way in which corrections for infall into the virgo cluster are applied .",
    "this is because the virgo cluster is in the foreground of the cfa1 survey and contains many intrinsically faint galaxies in a thermally hot region .",
    "increasing the distance to these galaxies by a small amount results in inclusion of fewer of these galaxies in the volume limited sample . because @xmath2 is pair weighted , including or leaving out even @xmath47 galaxies from the virgo cluster can change @xmath2 by @xmath48 km / s .",
    "in addition , including corrections for cluster infall in the calculation of the correlation function in redshift space , @xmath7 , effectively removes part of the `` finger of god '' and reduces the velocity dispersion of the cluster .",
    "once again the pair - weighted nature of the statistic means that this will result in a significant reduction in the overall value of @xmath2 for the sample .",
    "however , no infall corrections were used in recent calculations of @xmath2 for other redshift surveys and yet a wide range of values for @xmath2 is obtained for different surveys .",
    "we have argued that this is because @xmath2 is extremely sensitive to clusters , and existing redshift surveys do not sample a large enough volume of space to represent a fair sample of these relatively rare objects .",
    "one approach to solving this problem is to remove the clusters from the sample before calculating @xmath2 ; however , this reduces the ability of the statistic to discriminate between cosmological models .",
    "in addition , our work suggests that the results are likely to be sensitive to the details of how the clusters are identified and removed .",
    "analysis of larger volume redshift surveys will be necessary in order to obtain a robust value of @xmath2 which is useful in discriminating between cosmological models or for estimating @xmath49 .",
    "in the meantime , modified velocity statistics such as the galaxy - weighted velocity dispersion ( miller et al .",
    "1996 ) , a density dependent version of the pairwise velocity dispersion ( strauss 1996 ) , or the median velocity of groups ( nolthenius , klypin & primack 1996 ) have been designed to be less sensitive to clusters and may be promising alternatives ."
