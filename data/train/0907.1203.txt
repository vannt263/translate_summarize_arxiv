    "although the down pull by the earth was realized even before human civilization , such a phenomena did not arose any curiosity .",
    "after galileo and kepler found that planets move in a certain particular way described by a mathematical formula , people started to wonder : why planets move in such a peculiar and precise way .",
    "this motivated newton to develop his theory of gravity .",
    "newton s theory not only explains the planets motion , it also explains the down - pull that we feel on earth .",
    "it unifies the two seemingly unrelated phenomena .",
    "later we discovered that two other seemingly unrelated phenomena , electricity and magnetism , can generate each other .",
    "our curiosity about the electricity and magnetism leads to another giant leap in science , which is summarized by maxwell equations .",
    "maxwell theory unifies electricity and magnetism and reveals that light is merely an electromagnetic wave .",
    "we gain a much deeper understanding of light , which is so familiar and yet so unexpectedly rich and complex in its internal structure .",
    "newton s theory of gravity and maxwell s theory of light illustrate how science develops : it develops through the cycles of discovery , unification , more discovery , more unification .",
    "modern science has made many more discoveries and has also unified many seemingly unrelated discoveries into a few simple structures .",
    "those simple structures are so beautiful and we regard them as wonders of our universe .",
    "they are also very mysteries since we do not understand where do they come from and why do they have to be the way they are . at moment , the most fundamental mysteries and/or wonders in our universe can be summarized by the following short list : + ( 1 ) locality .",
    "+ ( 2 ) identical particles . +",
    "( 3 ) gauge interactions.@xcite + ( 4 ) fermi statistics.@xcite + ( 5 ) chiral fermions.@xcite + ( 6 ) lorentz invariance.@xcite + ( 7 ) gravity.@xcite    in the current physical theory of nature , we take the above properties for granted and do not ask where do they come from .",
    "we put those wonderful properties into our theory by hand , for example , by introducing one field for each kind of interactions or elementary particles .    here",
    ", we would like to question where those wonderful and mysterious properties come from .",
    "following the trend of science history , we wish to have a single unified understanding of all of the above mysteries . or more precisely , we wish that we can start from a single structure to obtain all of the above wonderful properties .",
    "historically , the first attempt to unify different forces is motivated by einstein general relativity which view gravity as an distortion of space.@xcite in 1918 , weyl proposed that the unit that we used to measure physical quantities is relative and is defined only locally .",
    "a distortion of the unit system can be described by a vector field which is called gauge field .",
    "weyl proposed that such a vector field ( the gauge field ) is the vector potential that describes the electromagnetism .",
    "although the above particular proposal turns out to be incorrect , the weyl s idea is correct . in 1925 , the complex quantum amplitude was discovered .",
    "if we assume the complex phase is relative , then a distortion of unit system that measure local complex phase can also be described by a vector field .",
    "such a vector field is indeed the vector potential that describes the electromagnetism .",
    "this leads to a unified way to understand gravity and electromagnetism : gravity arises from the relativity of spacial directions at different spatial points , while electromagnetism arises from the relativity of complex quantum phases at different spatial points .",
    "nordstrm , mglichkeit , kaluza , and klein further showed that both gravity and electromagnetism can be understood as a distortion of space provided that we think the space as five dimensional with one dimension compactified into a small circle.@xcite since that time , the geometric understanding of gravity and electromagnetism have dominated theoretical physics .    in this paper,@xcite we will take a position that the geometric understanding is not good enough and will try to advocate a very different non - geometric understanding of gravity and electromagnetism .",
    "why the geometric understanding is not good enough ?",
    "first the geometric understanding is not self - consistent .",
    "the consideration based quantum mechanics and einstein gravity indicates that two points separated by a distance less than the planck length can not exist as a physical reality .",
    "thus the foundation of the geometric approach  manifold  simply does not exist in our universe .",
    "this suggests that geometry is an emergent phenomenon that appears only at long distances .",
    "so we can not use geometry and manifold as a foundation to understand fundamental physical problems .",
    "maxwell theory of light and einstein theory of gravity are built on top of geometry .",
    "they fail to answer what is the origin geometry . in other words ,",
    "maxwell theory and einstein theory predict light waves and gravitational waves .",
    "but the theories fail to tell us what is waving ? also , maxwell theory and einstein theory fail to answer what is the origin of the other wonders of our universe , such as fermi statistics .",
    "in this paper we try to address the above question by trying to find a single microscopic origin for both light and gravity .",
    "we hope the microscopic origin will allow us to gain a deeper and a unified understanding of gravity and light .",
    "we also hope that a deeper and unified understanding of gravity and light will lead to a unified understanding of other deep mysteries of the universe , such as the origin of all elementary particles .    at first sight",
    ", it appears that such a goal is too ambitious to be practical .",
    "however , recent progresses suggest that such an ambitious goal may be achievable .",
    "it was shown that , starting from a single origin  a local bosonic model ( which is also called a quantum spin model , or more precisely a qubit model ) , the first four of the seven wonders can emerge naturally at low energies ,",
    "if the ground state of the spin model is described by string - net condensation.@xcite thus we may say that the string - net condensation in a qubit model provides a unified origin for the four wonders : identical particles , gauge interactions , fermi statistics and near masslessness of the fermions .",
    "two seemingly unrelated properties , gauge interaction and fermi statistics , are unified under the string - net picture .",
    "it is amazing to see that using emergence and the string - net picture to understand the origin of light leads to a understanding of the origin of fermi statistics .    knowing the above result , the goal of this paper can be stated more precisely : in addition to the four emergent properties mentioned above , we want to understand merely one more emergent property  the emergence of gravity , from a local qubit model . in this paper , we want to construct a local qubit model where gravitational waves and gravitons emerge as the low energy excitations of the model .",
    "if successful , such a local qubit model will actually represent a quantum theory of gravity .",
    "so constructing such a local qubit model solves a long standing problem of putting quantum mechanics and gravity together .",
    "we hope in the future , we can construct a local qubit model where light , gravity , and nearly massless fermions emerge at low energies .",
    "such a local qubit model will unify five of the seven deep mysteries in our list .",
    "the belief that all the wonderful phenomena of our universe ( such as gauge interaction , fermi statistics , gravitons , or even superstring theory ) emerge from a lowly qubit model is called locality principle.@xcite using a local qubit model as a underlying structure to understand the deep mysteries of our universe@xcite represents a departure from the traditional approach to understand our world by dividing things into smaller parts ( which will be called division approach ) .",
    "it also represents a departure from the geometric way to understand gravity and gauge interactions .      in the division approach",
    ", we try to understand various things by divide them into smaller and smaller parts .",
    "if we assume the division has to end at a certain level , then we conclude that all things are formed by the parts that can not be divided further . the indivisible parts are call the elementary particles .",
    "so in the division approach , we view everything in our world as made of some simple beautiful building blocks , the elementary particles .",
    "a deeper understanding is gained if we find some elementary particles are not actually elementary and are formed by even smaller objects .",
    "a large part of science is devoted in finding those smaller and smaller objects , as represented by the discoveries of atoms , electrons and protons , and then quarks .    however , the division approach that we followed in last 150 years may not represent a right direction . for example , phonons in a solid is as particle - like as any other elementary particles at low energies .",
    "but if we look at phonons closely , we do not see smaller parts that form a phonon .",
    "we see the atoms that fill the entire space .",
    "the phonons are not formed by those atoms , the phonons are simply collective motions of those atoms .",
    "this leads us to wonder that maybe photons , electrons , gravitons , _ etc  _ , are also collective motions of a certain underlying structure that fill the entire space .",
    "they may not have smaller parts .",
    "looking for the smaller parts of photons , electrons , and gravitons to gain a deeper understanding of those elementary particles may not be a right approach .    in this paper , we will use a different approach , emergence approach , to gain a deeper understanding of elementary particles . in the emergence approach used in this paper",
    ", we view space as a collection of qubits . the empty space ( the vacuum )",
    "corresponds to the ground state of the qubits , and the elementary particles ( the matter formed by them ) correspond to the excitations of the qubits .",
    "we know that elementary particles in our would can have quite different properties . can excitations of qubits have those rich properties ? due to the particle - wave duality in quantum theory , particles and waves are the same thing . in the emergence approach",
    "we will try to understand the nature of waves in order to understand the nature of elementary particles .      to see how the emergence approach leads to a deeper understanding of elementary particles ,",
    "let us start with euler equation @xmath8 that describe waves in a liquid .",
    "we want to ask what is the microscopic origin of euler equation ?",
    "the answer is obtained only after the discovery of atoms .",
    "we find that the waves in a liquid are collective motions of the atoms and euler equation describes the dynamics of the those collective motions .",
    "however , how atoms are organized in the ground state plays an important role here . only when the atoms are organized into a liquid state ( or more precisely , a boson condensed state for the bosonic atoms ) , are the collective motions of those bosonic atoms described by euler equation .",
    "if the bosons organize into a crystal , then their collective motions will be described by a different wave equation , navier equation : @xmath9 .    due to the particle - wave duality",
    ", our understanding of euler equation and navier equation leads to an understanding of phonons in liquids and solids .",
    "we see that it is the _ organization _ of bosons that becomes the microscopic origin of phonons .",
    "different organizations lead to different wave equations and different types of phonons .    from this point of view , to find a microscopic origin of light and gravity is to find a particular organization of bosons ( or qubits ) , such that the collective motions of such organized bosons ( qubits ) are described by maxwell equation and einstein equation ( instead of euler equation or navier equation ) .",
    "we like to point out that , in such an emergence approach , we do not look for the building blocks of everything .",
    "the building block is known : it is a qubit .",
    "even the detail form of the qubit model and the precise values of various coupling constants are not important .",
    "the important issue is how the bosons ( qubits ) are organized in the ground state .",
    "different organizations lead to different collective excitations , or in other words , different sets of `` elementary '' particles .",
    "it was shown that if bosons ( qubits ) organize into network of strings and if the string - nets form a quantum liquid ( called string - net condensed state ) , then photons , electrons and quarks can emerge naturally as collective motions of such organized bosons ( qubits).@xcite in this paper , we will try to find an organization of bosons ( qubits ) such that the collective motions of bosons ( qubits ) also lead to gravitons .",
    "in contrast , in the traditional approach , we choose a particular field for each kind of elementary particle .",
    "the particular properties of elementary particles are encoded in our particular choice of the field .",
    "for example , to get a fermion ( such as electron ) , we choose an anti - commuting grassmann field , while to get a photon , we choose a vector field .",
    "we like to point out that this paper uses a particular emergence approach : we try to obtain everything from a local qubit model another emergence approach was developed in superstring theory@xcite in last 10 years , as demonstrated by the duality relations among various superstring models and matrix models.@xcite the anti - de sitter - space / conformal - field - theory duality even shows how space - time and gravity emerge from a gauge theory.@xcite it would be interesting find out if the gravity from the superstring theory can produce helicity @xmath3 modes ( gravitons ) _ as the only gapless excitation_. it is also interesting to find a relation between all those ideas of emergence .",
    "there are many different approaches to quantum gravity@xcite based on different principles .",
    "some approaches , such as loop quantum gravity,@xcite stress the gauge structure from the diffeomorphism of the space - time and try to build a quantum theory where the whole space - time is emergent .",
    "( this is called background independence.@xcite ) other approaches , such as superstring theory,@xcite stress the renormalizability of the theory and try to construct a renormalizable theory that contain gravitons . in this paper , we will stress different things , namely finiteness and locality , and follow a different rule of game .",
    "our rule of game is encoded in the following working definition of quantum gravity .",
    "quantum gravity is + ( a ) a quantum theory described by a hamiltonian in a hilbert space .",
    "+ ( b ) its hilbert space has a finite dimension .",
    "+ ( c ) the hamiltonian is a sum of local operators .",
    "+ ( d ) a single gapless helicity @xmath0 mode is the only type of low energy excitations .",
    "+ ( e ) the helicity @xmath0 excitations have a linear dispersion .",
    "+ ( f ) the gravitons excitations . ] interact in the way consistent with experimental observations .",
    "+ we like to remark that different people may have different understandings / definitions of quantum gravity . we hope the above definition that will be used in this paper will help to avoid some possible confusions .",
    "is the above definition of quantum gravity a proper definition ?",
    "the first problem that we face when we consider quantum gravity is that `` is quantum gravity a quantum theory ? '' ] the answer to the above question appears to be no , since einstein theory tells us that time is dynamical while quantum mechanics assume an absolute time .",
    "the second problem is that `` is quantum gravity a theory based real and complex numbers ? '' as mention above , the consideration of quantum theory and einstein gravity suggests that the notion of manifold is not a physical reality .",
    "similarly , one may wonder , maybe even real numbers and complex numbers can not exist as a physical reality . in this case , we wonder : should we avoid using real and complex numbers when we formulate a theory of quantum gravity ?",
    "the above two considerations may serve as a long term goal .",
    "but they are not so useful as a guide for research .",
    "this is why we proposed a _ working _ definition of quantum gravity to guide our research at this stage .",
    "when we understand quantum gravity better , we expect that our working definition will be modified .",
    "let us discuss each item in our working definition in more detail .",
    "since the time is absolute in quantum mechanics , the condition ( a ) implies that the time is not emergent . so the quantum gravity considered here is not background independent . in order for the time to be emergent",
    ", one has to go beyond quantum mechanics , that we will not do in this paper .",
    "the condition ( b ) implies that the quantum gravity considered here has a finite cut - off .",
    "so the renormalizability is not an issue .",
    "a condensed matter system always has a finite cut - off and can only simulates a system with a finite cut - off .",
    "so the conditions ( a  b ) makes it possible to use condensed matter system to simulate the quantum gravity ( as defined here ) .",
    "also , from a mathematical point of view , only theories with finite cut - off are really well defined .",
    "the condition ( c ) is a locality condition .",
    "it implies two additional things : ( 1 ) the total hilbert space is a direct product of local hilbert spaces @xmath10 .",
    "( 2 ) the local operators are defined as operators that act within each local hilbert space @xmath11 or finite products of local operators .",
    "the conditions ( a  c ) actually define a local bosonic model ( or a local qubit model).@xcite certainly , any quantum spin models satisfy ( a  c ) .",
    "it is the condition ( d  f ) that makes a theory to look like gravity .",
    "but why do we require gapless gravitons to be the only low energy excitations in the condition ( d ) ? to answer this question ,",
    "let us consider the theory of electromagnetism where gapless photons ( excitations with helicity @xmath12 ) are the only low energy excitations",
    ". if a system also has helicity @xmath13 gapless excitations , then we are no longer sure if the gapless helicity @xmath12 excitations are photons .",
    "this is because phonons in solid have helicity @xmath13 and @xmath12 .",
    "thus a theory with gapless helicity @xmath13 and helicity @xmath12 excitations may not be a theory of photons , it may be a theory of phonons .",
    "but a theory with helicity @xmath12 excitations as the only low energy excitations must be a theory of electromagnetism .",
    "so here we require our theory to have helicity @xmath0 excitations as the only low energy excitations , to make sure the theory is a theory of quantum gravity ( at least at linearized level ) .",
    "the condition ( d ) is a very important condition .",
    "it is very easy to construct a quantum model that contain helicity @xmath0 gapless excitations , such as the theory described by the following lagrangian for symmetric tensor field @xmath14 such a theory also contain helicity @xmath13 and @xmath12 gapless excitations and is certainly not a theory of gravity .",
    "so here we impose the condition ( d ) rule out the above example .",
    "it is highly non - trivial to construct a quantum model that contains helicity @xmath0 excitations as the only gapless excitations .",
    "many theories of quantum gravity fail this test .",
    "we would like to mention that , according to our definition , only when helicity @xmath0 modes are the only low lying excitations , can the theory be a theory of quantum gravity .",
    "such a condition may be too strict .",
    "we may want to relax the condition ( d ) to condition ( d ) : the helicity @xmath12 and @xmath0 excitations are the only low energy excitations . in this case the helicity @xmath12 excitations are photons and the helicity @xmath0 excitations are gravitons , which reflects the situation in our universe",
    ".    the emergent gravitons from local qubit models naturally interact with each other .",
    "however , they in general interact in a different way from that described by the higher order non - linear terms in einstein gravity .",
    "since those higher order terms in einstein gravity are irrelevant at low energies and not universal when viewed from the perspective of local qubit models , therefore it may be possible to generate those higher order terms by fine tuning the lattice model [ such as modifying the hamiltonian ( @xmath15 and @xmath16 ) , the constraints ( @xmath17 ) , as well as the berry s phase term in eqn .",
    "( [ lthphi ] ) ] .",
    "so it may be possible that local qubit models can generate proper non - linear terms to satisfy ( f ) .    to summarize , the goal of our approach to quantum gravity is to construct an hamiltonian operator that act on a hilbert space .",
    "we require that the hilbert space is a directly product of local hilbert spaces which each has a finite dimension : @xmath18 .",
    "respect to such a locality structure of the hilbert space , we require that the hamiltonian operator is a sum of local operators .",
    "( the local operators are defined as operators that act within each local hilbert space @xmath11 or finite products of local operators . ) in order for the hamiltonian operator to describe a quantum theory of gravity , we also require that all the low energy excitations above the ground state of the hamiltonian are described by a single mode of helicity @xmath0 excitations ( gravitons ) .",
    "last , those gravitons should interact in way that is required by the equivalence principle of einstein gravity .",
    "we first start with a field theory of a symmetric tensor @xmath19 described by the following phase space lagrangian : @xmath20 we then put the theory on the lattice to have a finite cut - off .",
    "the key issue is that , as a quantum theory , does the lattice model has helicity @xmath0 modes as the only gapless excitation ?",
    "it turns out that it is very hard to have helicity @xmath0 modes as the only gapless excitation .",
    "in general , one either has all helicity @xmath0 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 modes as gapless excitations or have no gapless excitation at all . in this paper , we show that if we compactify and descretize @xmath19 and its canonical conjugate @xmath21 , we can actually have a lattice model that has helicity @xmath0 modes as the only gapless excitation .",
    "such helicity @xmath0 modes correspond to the emergent gravitons from the lattice model .",
    "we also find that the low energy effective theory for such a lattice model has an emergent linearized diffeomorphism gauge symmetry @xmath22 , which is an implied consequence of having helicity @xmath0 modes as the only gapless excitation .      in this section",
    ", we will discuss some previous approaches in terms of our practical definition of quantum gravity .",
    "superstring theory@xcite satisfies the conditions ( a ) , ( e ) and ( f ) , but in general not ( d ) due to the presence of dilatons ( massless scaler particles ) .",
    "the superstring theory ( or more precisely , the superstring field theory ) also does not satisfy the condition ( b ) since the cut - off is not explicitly implemented .",
    "many approaches to quantum gravity are based on quantizing the classical einstein action .",
    "the lattice gravity approach based regge calculus on 4d space - time lattice@xcite belong to this type of approach where a finite space - time cut - off is introduced .",
    "such an approach may not satisfy the conditions ( a - c ) since it may not produce a local hamiltonian and local hilbert space .",
    "such an approach eventually failed due to the doubling phenomenon of the gravitational modes , _",
    "ie  _ it does not satisfies the condition ( d ) .    in ref .",
    ", quantum gravity is studied in terms of lattice hamiltonians with a continuous time ( just like this paper ) .",
    "however , those hamiltonians obtained by quantizing the classical einstein action are non - local ( _ ie  _ they do not satisfy the condition ( b , c ) ) . also , the low energy excitations of the those lattice hamiltonians were not discussed .",
    "we do not know if those lattice hamiltonians have gapless excitation or not . as a result , we do not know if those lattice hamiltonians give rise to emergent diffeomorphism gauge symmetry at low energies",
    ". the spin network@xcite or the quantum computing@xcite approach to quantum gravity satisfies the condition ( a , b ) or ( a  c ) . but again , the properties ( d  f ) remain to be shown .",
    "the induced gravity from superfluid @xmath23he discussed in ref .",
    "does not satisfy the condition ( d ) due to the presence of gapless superfluid mode . in ref .  , it is proposed that gravitons may emerge as edge excitations of a quantum hall state in 4 spatial dimensions . again",
    "the condition ( d ) is not satisfied due to the presence of helicity @xmath24 modes where @xmath25 is unbounded .",
    "in fact , there are infinite many gapless modes with various helicities .    in ref .",
    ", a very interesting spin model is constructed .",
    "the model satisfies the condition ( a  c ) and + ( d  ) the gapless helicity @xmath13 and helicity @xmath0 modes are the only low energy excitations ; + ( e  ) the helicity @xmath0 modes have a quadratic dispersion .",
    "+ the model is interesting since its ground state is a new state of matter ",
    "an algebraic spin liquid .",
    "such a state is beyond the landau s symmetry breaking description .",
    "despite the emergence of gapless helicity @xmath0 modes , due to the properties ( d  ) and ( e  ) , the low energy properties of the model are not very close to those of einstein gravity .    in this paper , we will try to fix the two problems and try to construct a qubit model that satisfies the condition ( a  d ) , and hopeful ( f ) through fine tuning .",
    "we only partially achieve our goal .",
    "we studied two quantum spin models ( or qubit models ) . in the first quantum spin model ( called the l - type model ) , the helicity @xmath0 gapless excitations are reliably shown to appear as the only type of low energy excitations ( _ ie  _ the conditions ( a  d ) are satisfied ) . within a perturbative calculation , the dispersion of the gapless helicity @xmath0 is found to be @xmath2 .",
    "so the condition ( e ) is not satisfied .",
    "the appearance of the gapless helicity @xmath3 modes suggests that the ground state of the quantum spin model is a new state of matter . in the second model ( called the n - type model)@xcite the collective modes are strongly interacting and there is no reliable approach to understand its low energy dynamics . using a spin - wave / quantum - freeze approach ( which is shown to reproduce the correct emergent @xmath4 gauge theory in a quantum rotor model ) , we argue that the second model may contain helicity @xmath0 gapless excitations as the only type of low energy excitations with a linear dispersion @xmath5 . more reliably numerical calculations are needed to confirm that the type - n model really has @xmath5 helicity @xmath0 excitations as the only low energy excitations .",
    "we believe that the gaplessness of the helicity @xmath0 excitations in both models is topologically robust : any translation invariant perturbations can not generate a gap for those helicity @xmath0 excitations .",

    "we will show that by imposing some `` constraints '' through certain spin interaction terms , we can obtain a theory where the helicity @xmath0 excitations are the only low energy excitations . since the constraints that we will impose are similar to the gauss constraint in @xmath4 gauge theory , here we will first give a brief review of quantum @xmath4 gauge theory , to introduce the physical ideas behind our construction in a more familiar setting .    to obtain a @xmath4 gauge theory",

    "the above theory is not a theory of electromagnetism due to the presence of gapless helicity @xmath13 mode .",
    "so the key to obtain a theory of electromagnetism is to gap the helicity @xmath13 mode .      the standard way to remove",

    "since discreteness of @xmath314 is of order @xmath328 , the gap of the helicity @xmath13 and @xmath12 modes is of order @xmath329 .",
    "the strong fluctuations @xmath392 lead to gauge transformations @xmath393 and the weak fluctuations @xmath332 lead to constraints @xmath394    the second helicity @xmath13 mode is described by @xmath334 which correspond to the following fluctuations : @xmath335 and @xmath395 .",
    "its frequency is again @xmath324 .",
    "the hamiltonian for such a mode contains only @xmath337 .",
    "so the quantum fluctuations satisfies @xmath338 and @xmath339 . the second helicity @xmath13 mode is also gapped with a gap of order @xmath222 .",
    "the strong fluctuations @xmath340 lead to a gauge transformation @xmath396 and the weak fluctuations @xmath397 lead to a constraint @xmath398    the lagrangian ( [ lagthphin ] ) equipped with the gauge transformations ( [ g1n],[g2n ] ) and the constraints ( [ c1n],[c2n ] ) is nothing but the linearized einstein lagrangian of gravity , where @xmath149 represents the fluctuations of the metric tenor @xmath399 around the flat space .",
    "so the linearized einstein gravity may emerge from the quantum model ( [ hujg ] ) in the large @xmath200 limit .",
    "the qubit model ( [ hujg ] ) may be quantum theory of gravity at the linear order .",
    "the key in our argument is the gapping of helicity @xmath13 and @xmath12 modes .",
    "clearly , in the n - type lattice model ( [ hujg ] ) , those modes are strongly fluctuating and strongly interacting modes .",
    "those modes also have a very narrow band width and arise from compact degree freedom on lattice .",
    "the strongly interacting modes with flat bands are in general gapped .",
    "the gapless helicity @xmath0 modes are very classical in the large @xmath200 limit .",
    "they should survive the gapping of the helicity @xmath13 and @xmath12 modes .",
    "we have seen that the helicity @xmath0 modes are very classical with small quantum fluctuations while the helicity @xmath13 and @xmath12 modes have strong quantum fluctuations .",
    "this is why the helicity @xmath0 modes remain gapless while the helicity @xmath13 and @xmath12 modes are gapped .",
    "also , at quadratic level , the helicity @xmath0 modes and the helicity @xmath400 modes decouple .",
    "the strong quantum fluctuations in the @xmath400 modes will not affect the dynamics of the @xmath0 modes at the quadratic level .",

    "the helicity @xmath0 modes and the helicity @xmath400 modes are coupled in the n - type lattice model . in this case , the strong quantum fluctuations in the @xmath400 modes may change the dynamics of the @xmath0 modes beyond the quadratic level .",
    "this is why we can not obtain the low energy dynamics of the n - type lattice model reliably and the @xmath401 dispersion for the helicity @xmath0 modes in the n - type lattice model is not a reliable result .",
    "however , such problem does not appear in the l - type lattice model .",

    "in section [ lowspace ] , we have constructed the low energy hilbert space of our lattice model in the large @xmath404 limit .",
    "we can also construct high energy states that do not satisfy the scaler or vector constraints ( [ constr1 ] ) but remain to be eigenstates of @xmath227 and @xmath405 .",

    "the operator @xmath410s({\\boldsymbol{i}})^n\\right)$ ] and @xmath411 can be viewed as scalar and vector defects creating operators .",
    "the quantum number @xmath412 divide the hilbert space into different sectors , our low energy hilbert space is defined as @xmath413 .",
    "the existence of ( quantized ) scalar and vector defects have very deep relationship with the existence of helicity @xmath0 modes in low energy hilbert space . in the continuum limit ,",
    "it is easy to see these defects are all topological defects and could not be removed by local operations and protected by energy scale @xmath221 and @xmath222 .",
    "meanwhile , this energy scales `` freeze '' the low energy quantum fluctuations of helicity @xmath13 and @xmath12 modes . at this stage , we may conclude the helicity @xmath0 modes in our lattice model is topologically stable and the existence of scalar and vector defects reflects the special quantum order in such a system .",
    "in this paper , we studied two qubit models , the l - type model and the n - type model .",
    "the low energy dynamics of the l - type model can be calculated reliably and we find that the helicity @xmath0 modes are the only gapless excitations with @xmath403 dispersion .",
    "the low energy dynamics of the n - type lattice model can not be calculated reliably .",
    "however , the spin - wave / quantum freeze approach suggest that the helicity @xmath0 modes may be the only gapless excitations with @xmath401 dispersion in the n - type model .",
    "those gapless helicity @xmath0 excitations can be viewed as emergent gravitons .",
    "both qubit models are constructed by putting a symmetric tensor field on lattice , and by discretizing and compactifying each component of the tensor field . to understand the low energy dynamics of the two model",
    ", we have used a semiclassical approach , where we treat the tensor field as continuous and uncompactified .",
    "we then expand the lattice lagrangian of the two models to quadratic order .",
    "the resulting free theories can be analyzed easily .",
    "we find that both models contain gapless helicity @xmath0 modes .",
    "the analysis of the quantum fluctuations for such modes indicates that the helicity @xmath6 modes are very classical and the semiclassical approach is self consistent .",
    "we also find that both models contain gapless helicity @xmath414 modes .",
    "the analysis of the quantum fluctuations for those modes indicates that the helicity @xmath414 modes are extremely quantum and the semiclassical approach is not self consistent .",
    "the non - linear effects of the helicity @xmath414 modes need to be considered .    however , the non - linear effects of the helicity @xmath414 modes have very different forms in the l - type and the n - type model . in the l - type model ,",
    "the strong fluctuating helicity @xmath414 modes decouple from the semiclassical helicity @xmath0 modes even at non - linear level . after taking into account the discreteness and the compactness of the tensor field",
    ", we can show that non - linear effect gaps the helicity @xmath414 modes .",
    "such a gapping process does not affect the helicity @xmath0 modes .",
    "so helicity @xmath0 modes remain gapless with @xmath269 dispersion .    in the n - type model ,",
    "the strong fluctuating helicity @xmath414 modes start to couple to the semiclassical helicity @xmath0 modes at non - linear level . after taking into account the discreteness and the compactness of the tensor field",
    ", we can argue that non - linear effect gaps the helicity @xmath414 modes .",
    "but such a gapping process may affect the low energy dynamics of the helicity @xmath0 modes .",
    "this is the reason why our result for the n - type model is not reliable .",
    "the situation for the emergence of the @xmath415 gravity from the n - type model is very similar to the emergence of chern - simons theory from local qubit models in 1 + 2d .",
    "although we have no reliable analytic calculation to show that the chern - simons theory can emerge from qubit models , numerical calculations have convincingly established the emergence of chern - simons theory from certain qubit models .",
    "so similarly , it is possible that the n - type model can produce the linearized einstein gravity , even though we can not show it reliably .",
    "numerical calculations are needed to show it convincingly .",
    "we have seen that the gapping of the helicity @xmath13 mode in the rotor model ( [ lattlc ] ) leads to an emergence of @xmath4 gauge structure at low energies .",
    "the emergence of a gauge structure also represents a new kind of order  quantum order@xcite  in the ground state . in ref .",
    ", it was shown that the emergent @xmath4 gauge invariance , and hence the quantum order , is robust against any local perturbations of the rotor model .",
    "thus the gaplessness of the emergent photon is protected by the quantum order.@xcite    similarly , the gapping of the two helicity @xmath13 modes and the helicity @xmath12 modes in the bosonic model ( or qubit model ) ( [ hujgl ] ) and/or ( [ hujg ] ) leads to an emergent gauge invariance of the linearized coordinate transformation .",
    "this indicates that the ground state of the qubit models contain a new kind of quantum order ( which is similar but different from those associated with emergent ordinary gauge invariance of internal degrees of freedom ) .",
    "we expect such an emergent linearized diffeomorphism invariance to be robust against any local perturbations of the bosonic model .",
    "thus the gaplessness of the emergent helicity @xmath0 modes are protected by the quantum order and are robust against any local perturbations .",
    "let us discuss the robustness of the @xmath416 dispersion of the l - type model in more detail . as stressed",
    "before , @xmath417 dispersion is the direct result of the local gauge invariance under eqn .",
    "( [ t2 ] ) and eqn .",
    "( [ t11 ] ) . to be more precise , we know that the l - type model is described by the following effective lagrangian @xmath418 its hamiltonian density",
    "is given by @xmath419 , where @xmath420 represent higher order and/or non - quadratic terms .",
    "such an effective hamiltonian density for the l - type model is directly invariant under the gauge transformations ( [ t2 ] ) and ( [ t11 ] ) , which leads to the @xmath416 dispersion .",
    "now , we would like to ask , if we integrate out high energy fluctuations in the l - type model , can we generate to following form of hamiltonian density @xmath421 + \\frac{g'}{2 } a_{ij}r^{ij } \\nonumber\\\\ & = \\frac{j'}{2}[{(\\mathcal{e}^{ij})}^2 -\\frac{1}{2}{(\\mathcal{e}^{ii})}^2 ] + \\frac{g'}{2 } d^l_k d^k_l\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] that appears in the n - type model ? here @xmath422 .",
    "if such hamiltonian density is generated , it will modify the low energy dispersion from @xmath269 to @xmath423 .    here",
    "we would like to stress that although @xmath424 is invariant under the gauge transformations ( [ t2 ] ) and ( [ t11 ] ) ( with the constraints ( [ t1 ] ) and ( [ t9 ] ) ) , the hamiltonian density @xmath425 is not invariant under the gauge transformations .",
    "@xmath425 changes by a total derivative .",
    "since @xmath426 is locally gauge invariant , within a perturbative calculation , it can not generate @xmath425 that is only gauge invariant up to a surface term .",
    "so the @xmath416 dispersion of the l - type model is robust against all perturbative corrections . at the moment",
    ", we do not know any non - perturbative effects that can generate the @xmath425 term within the l - type model .",
    "we further find the existence of scalar and vector defects to have intrinsic relationship with the gapping of @xmath13 and @xmath12 modes . at this stage",
    ", we may interpret the scalar defect as mass and vector defects as momentum .",
    "they are all _ quantized _ topological defects .",
    "however , there s no direct evidence for mass quantization experimentally , we attribute this fact to two possible reasons : a ) the mass quanta is too small to be detect experimentally ; ( of order @xmath427 in the large @xmath200 limit ) b ) the appearance of @xmath401 gravitons may remove the mass quantization for low lying excitations .",
    "to solve these problems demands much deeper understanding of the origin of the linear dispersion relations and will be our future efforts .",
    "this research is supported by the foundational questions institute ( fqxi ) and nsf grant dmr-0706078 .",
    "in this section , we will use a different approach ",
    "equation - of - motion approach to study the low energy modes of the l - type spin model ( [ hujgl ] ) .",
    "the idea behind the equation - of - motion approach is to choose operator that act within the low energy constrained subspace , and find the equation of motion for the averages of those operators .",
    "the derived equation of motion will describe the classical motion of the low energy collective modes , provided that the operators are chosen properly . for our case",
    "we will choose the gauge invariant operator @xmath264 and @xmath428 to construct the equation of the motion .",
    "in the large @xmath200 limit , we can express @xmath429 as @xmath430 and the commutating relation becomes @xmath431 notice @xmath432 and @xmath264 commute with the @xmath17 term , so the equation
