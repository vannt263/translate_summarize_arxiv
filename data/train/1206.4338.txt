    "<S> the amplitude of this noise is modulated by a subsequent rf switch that is turned on and off at the same ( acoustic ) frequency used for the square wave voltage bias we applied in excess noise measurement . </S>",
    "<S> part of the white noise will be reflected at the boundary between the gold junction and the transmission line to the bias tee . </S>",

    "<S> this measurement gives a picture of the relation between ensemble averaged reflections and the conductance of the junction . </S>",
    "<S> while the reflection measurement can not provide all the information about the junction s rf properties , at least it provides a rough check that nothing dramatic happens in terms of the ensemble - averaged impedance mismatch over the conductance range . </S>",

    "<S> there is some systematic variation with conductance , but this is small , less than 2% over 10  @xmath29 .    </S>",
    "<S> since the impedance mismatch between the junction and the measurement circuit does not vary dramatically on average over the range of junction configurations , there should be a scale factor ( approximately constant across the conductance range ) between the measured power and the true current noise across the junction . </S>",
    "<S> we attempt to find this factor by using the knowledge that the fano factor in the tunneling regime @xmath32 approaches one in the limit that a single poorly transmitting channel dominates the conductance , as apparent from eq .  </S>",

    "<S> all the data shown in this figure were taken continuously in one day to ensure an identical experimental environment ( lab temperature , any stray rf background ) . in our system </S>",
    "<S> no clear excess noise can be detected at bias voltages below about 25  mv , corresponding to @xmath22 at @xmath33  k. noise suppression at conductances corresponding to the first three peaks in the conductance histograms are very clear , and the magnitude of the detected noise power is monotonously increasing with bias as expected . note that the suppressions are not complete . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that at least some of the junction configurations corresponding to peak conductance values result from a mixture of multiple , partially transmitting quantum channels .        </S>",

    "<S> 5a , we plot data for three closely spaced values of conductance , all below @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> the figure shows that the noise is in fact linear when plotted as a function of @xmath38 , and the fano factor is decreasing as the conductance approaches 1  @xmath28 . </S>",

    "<S> we now consider the situation at higher conductances , when the number of channels involved in transport is large compared to one . </S>",
    "<S> as discussed above , we assume that the fano factor in the low conductance regime is close to one , as expected if transport is dominated by a single poorly transmitting channel . </S>",
    "<S> we perform a linear fit to the noise vs. @xmath38 data at @xmath39 , and assume that corresponds to a true fano factor close to one ( though a true single channel device would have @xmath40 near that conductance ) . in the particular data set shown in fig .  5a </S>",
    "<S> , the lowest conductance data around @xmath41 are still well described by a similar fano factor , as shown by the blue line . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that , when looked over the full ensemble average , the conductance in this regime results from several poorly transmitting channels , rather than being dominated by a single channel with a transmittance of 0.45 . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that a large contribution to the conductance histogram results from junctions with comparatively blunt tips . </S>",
    "<S> figure 5b shows , on the same plot as that low conductance data , the noise data vs. @xmath38 at around 4,5 and 6@xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> identically scaled linear fits show slopes of 0.39 , 0.34 , and 0.31 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> these relative slopes are comparatively insensitive to the choice of the low conductance fits used to find the scaling factor , provided @xmath42 . at even higher conductance values not shown in the figure , the inferred fano factors also do not vary by much , decreasing to around 0.25 near 10  @xmath28 .    </S>",
    "<S> these observations are roughly consistent with expectations for a crossover toward diffusive conduction . in diffusive conductors that are small </S>",
    "<S> compared to the inelastic scattering length for both electron - electron ( @xmath43 ) and electron - phonon ( @xmath44 ) interactions , theoretical calculations@xcite and experiments on different samples at helium temperature@xcite agree that @xmath45 in this regime . in the limit that the constriction length @xmath46 exceeds @xmath43 , the expected reduction factor is predicted@xcite to be @xmath47 . since both longitudinal and transverse dimensions in our junctions are comparable to the atomic scale , it seems likely that @xmath48 , and our data show consistency with the prediction of 1/3 . </S>",
    "<S> this consistency with a diffusive picture is a bit surprising , given that the length and transverse dimensions of the point contact should still be around 1 nm even when @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> experiments involving pb junctions@xcite have shown a similar transition to the diffusive regime even at relatively low conductances , though in that work this is ascribed to the importance of multiple orbitals per atom contributing to the conductance , leading to enhanced channel mixing . while this multiorbital mechanism should not apply for au junctions , the lack of clear peaks in the conductance histograms ( and corresponding suppressions in the noise ) above 3  @xmath28 are consistent with enhanced channel mixing in our structures relative to that seen in other au experiments@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is further supported by the observation mentioned in the previous paragraph that conduction in the tunneling regime in this data set appears to involve multiple poorly transmitting channels . </S>",
    "<S> it has been pointed out before@xcite that the prediction of a suppression factor of about 1/3 is surprisingly robust . </S>",
