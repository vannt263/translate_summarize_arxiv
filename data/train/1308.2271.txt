    "the idea of categorification the jones polynomial is known by khovanov homology for links which is a new link invariant introduced by khovanov @xcite , @xcite . for each link @xmath0 in @xmath1 he defined a graded chain complex , with grading preserving differentials , whose graded euler characteristic is equal to the jones polynomial of the link @xmath0 .",
    "the idea of khovanov homology for graphs arises from the same idea of khovanov homology for links by the categorifications the chromatic polynomial of graphs .",
    "this was done by l. helme - guizon and y. rong @xcite , for each graph g , they defined a graded chain complex whose graded euler characteristic is equal to the chromatic polynomial of g. in our work we try to recall , the khovanov homology for links .",
    "+ we discuss the question of extending khovanov homology from links to embedded graphs .",
    "this is based on a result of kauffman that constructs a topological invariant of embedded graphs in the 3-sphere by associating to such a graph a family of links and knots obtained using some local replacements at each vertex in the graph .",
    "he showed that it is a topological invariant by showing that the resulting knot and link types in the family thus constructed are invariant under a set of reidemeister moves for embedded graphs that determine the ambient isotopy class of the embedded graphs .",
    "we build on this idea and simply define the khovanov homology of an embedded graph to be the sum of the khovanov homologies of all the links and knots in the kauffman invariant associated to this graph .",
    "since this family of links and knots is a topologically invariant , so is the khovanov - kauffman homology of embedded graphs defined in this manner .",
    "we close this paper by giving an example of computation of khovanov - kauffman homology for an embedded graph using this definition .",
    "+   + * * the author would like to express his deeply grateful to prof.matilde marcolli for her advices and numerous fruitful discussions .",
    "he is also thankful to louis h. kauffman and mikhail khovanov for their support words and advices .",
    "some parts of this paper done in max - planck institut fr mathematik ( mpim ) , bonn , germany , the author is kindly would like to thank mpim for their hosting and subsidy during his study there .",
    "in the following we recall a homology theory for knots and links embedded in the 3-sphere .",
    "we discuss later how to extend it to the case of embedded graphs .",
    "+      in recent years , many papers have appeared that discuss properties of khovanov homology theory , which was introduced in @xcite . for each link @xmath2 ,",
    "khovanov constructed a bi - graded chain complex associated with the diagram @xmath3 for this link @xmath0 and applied homology to get a group @xmath4 , whose euler characteristic is the normalized jones polynomial .",
    "@xmath5 he also proved that , given two diagrams @xmath3 and @xmath6 for the same link , the corresponding chain complexes are chain equivalent , hence , their homology groups are isomorphic .",
    "thus , khovanov homology is a link invariant .",
    "let @xmath0 be a link with @xmath7 crossings . at any small neighborhood of a crossing",
    "we can replace the crossing by a pair of parallel arcs and this operation is called a resolution .",
    "there are two types of these resolutions called @xmath8-resolution ( horizontal resolution ) and @xmath9-resolution ( vertical resolution ) as illustrated in figure ( [ fig11 ] ) .",
    "+         + we can construct a @xmath7-dimensional cube by applying the @xmath8 and @xmath9-resolutions @xmath7 times to each crossing to get @xmath10 pictures called smoothings ( which are one dimensional manifolds ) @xmath11 .",
    "each of these can be indexed by a word @xmath12 of @xmath7 zeros and ones , _",
    "i.e. _  @xmath13 .",
    "let @xmath14 be an edge of the cube between two smoothings @xmath15 and @xmath16 , where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are identical smoothings except for a small neighborhood around the crossing that changes from @xmath8 to @xmath9-resolution . to each edge",
    "@xmath14 we can assign a cobordism @xmath17 ( orientable surface whose boundary is the union of the circles in the smoothing at either end)@xmath18 this @xmath17 is a product cobordism except in the neighborhood of the crossing , where it is the obvious saddle cobordism between the @xmath8 and @xmath9-resolutions .",
    "khovanov constructed a complex by applying a @xmath19-dimensional tqft ( topological quantum field theory ) which is a monoidal functor , by replacing each vertex @xmath11 by a graded vector space @xmath20 and each edge ( cobordism ) @xmath17 by a linear map @xmath21 , and we set the group @xmath22 to be the direct sum of the graded vector spaces for all the vertices and the differential on the summand @xmath22 is a sum of the maps @xmath21 for all edges @xmath14 such that tail(@xmath14)@xmath23 _",

    "@xcite , @xcite here we give some properties of khovanov homology .    [ 1234 ]    1 .",
    "if @xmath6 is a diagram obtained from @xmath3 by the application of a reidemeister moves then the complexes @xmath39 and @xmath40 are homotopy equivalent .",

    "then the chain complex @xmath56 is isomorphic to the dual of @xmath22 and @xmath57",
    "we give now a survey of the kauffman theory and show how to associate to an embedded graph in @xmath58 a family of knots and links .",
    "we then use these results to give our definition of khovanov homology for embedded graphs . in @xcite kauffman",
    "introduced a method for producing topological invariants of graphs embedded in @xmath58 .",
    "the idea is to associate a collection of knots and links to a graph @xmath59 so that this family is an invariant under the expanded reidemeister moves defined by kauffman and reported here in figure ( [ fig21 ] ) . +         + he defined in his work an ambient isotopy for non - rigid ( topological ) vertices .",
    "( physically , the rigid vertex concept corresponds to a network of rigid disks each with ( four ) flexible tubes or strings emanating from it . )",
    "kauffman proved that piecewise linear ambient isotopies of embedded graphs in @xmath58 correspond to a sequence of generalized reidemeister moves for planar diagrams of the embedded graphs .",
    "@xcite piecewise linear ( pl ) ambient isotopy of embedded graphs is generated by the moves of figure ( [ fig21 ] ) , that is , if two embedded graphs are ambient isotopic , then any two diagrams of them are related by a finite sequence of the moves of figure ( [ fig21 ] ) .",
    "let @xmath59 be a graph embedded in @xmath58 .",
    "the procedure described by kauffman of how to associate to @xmath59 a family of knots and links prescribes that we should make a local replacement as in figure ( [ fig18 ] ) to each vertex in @xmath59 .",
    "such a replacement at a vertex @xmath60 connects two edges and isolates all other edges at that vertex , leaving them as free ends .",
    "let @xmath61 denote the link formed by the closed curves formed by this process at a vertex @xmath60 .",
    "one retains the link @xmath61 , while eliminating all the remaining unknotted arcs .",
    "define then @xmath62 to be the family of the links @xmath61 for all possible replacement choices , @xmath63 for example see figure ( [ fig19 ] ) .",
    "now we are ready to speak about a new concept of khovanov - kauffman homology for embedded graphs by using khovanov homology for the links ( knots ) and kauffman theory of associate a family of links to an embedded graph @xmath59 , as described above .",
