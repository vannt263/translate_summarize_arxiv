    "hot cores are dense condensations of gas found in the vicinity of ultracompact hii  ( uchii ) regions . their hot compact nature was first revealed by ammonia observations ( e.g. @xcite ) , which also provided the first clues to the different chemistry occurring in hot cores ( @xcite ) . compared with dark clouds ,",
    "the abundances of several species showed orders of magnitude enhancements which led to the proposition that evaporation of grain mantles was important ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the inclusion of freeze - out onto dust grains in chemical models yielded good agreement and gave the first clues to the formation process of massive stars , namely that they must go through a cold collapse phase of evolution ( @xcite ) .",
    "most studies of hot cores to date have been limited either spatially or spectrally .",
    "single - dish studies of the rich chemistry of hot cores can yield valuable information on the species present and allow column densities to be estimated ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) . however in order to derive spatial information , high resolution observations must be made .",
    "the vla has led the field here with subarcsecond imaging of ammonia ( @xcite ) which permits temperature and density information to be derived on scales of a few thousand au .",
    "however , it is millimetre / submillimetre interferometry which hold the key to simultaneously probing the structure and chemistry of hot cores .",
    "furthermore , it is in the 1.3-mm window that current instruments can make substantial gains with the wide variety of molecular lines that are accessible and the fact that the continuum emission will be dominated by emission from dust rather than free - free emission from ionized gas in an hii  region . to date 1.3-mm observations",
    "have been made towards the orion hot core ( @xcite ) and w3(oh ) ( @xcite , 1999 ) , as well as two of our targets ( g29.96 and g31.41 ) , albeit with lower resolution ( @xcite ) .",
    "the proximity of hot cores to hii  regions led early studies to suspect that hot cores may be heated by radiation from the newly - formed ob stars within the hii  region .",
    "however , there is now mounting evidence that at least some hot cores mark the sites of massive star formation ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) . in the next section ,",
    "results are presented of a new 1.4-mm bima study toward uchii / hot core regions , with the aim of separating hii  regions and hot dust from the molecular cores . on the whole ,",
    "our data support the notion that our target hot cores contain embedded sources .",
    "the observations were made with the 9 elements of the bima array at hat creek , california , equipped with 1.3-mm receivers .",
    "a sample of four hot cores near ultracompact hii  regions ( g9.62 + 0.19 , g10.470.03 , g29.960.02 , g31.41 + 0.31 ) was observed with angular resolution varying from 0.4 ( g10.47 ) to 2.8 arcsec ( g9.62 ) .",
    "the correlator windows were set to cover a continuous bandwidth of 800 mhz centred at 216.4 and 219.9 ghz with spectral resolution of 4.3 kms@xmath1 .",
    "in addition , c@xmath2o and h@xmath0s were observed with higher spectral resolution ( 1.1 kms@xmath1 ) .",
    "the 1.4-mm continuum images were made by summing the line - free channels in each band .",
    "all four regions were classified as ` line - rich ' by @xcite .",
    "in each case continuum emission was detected towards the hot core positions at 1.4 mm , clearly resolved from the respective uchii   regions . comparing our 1.4-mm images with vla and our own bima 3-mm data",
    "shows that the 1.4-mm emission is due to warm dust grains . only in g10.47",
    "is the peak 1.4-mm continuum coincident with a uchii   region . in g9.62 and g29.96 continuum emission",
    "is also detected towards the uchii  region(s ) , which appears to be free - free emission from the ionized gas , although in g29.96 there does appear to be some warm dust within the shell of the uchii  region .",
    "the water masers ( @xcite ) in each region are associated with the dust continuum emission .",
    "images comparing the dust continuum with the free - free emission are given in @xcite .",
    "the peak continuum flux ranges from 0.2 to 0.7 jy per beam , equivalent to brightness temperatures of up to 98 k ( in a beam of 0.5 arcsec towards g10.47 ) .",
    "thus the dust emission is warm .",
    "masses of a few hundred to a thousand solar masses are inferred from these data , which translate to molecular hydrogen column densities of @xmath3@xmath4 towards the cores .",
    "volume densities as high as @xmath5@xmath6 are derived for g10.47 and g31.41 .",
    "the high angular resolution data enables us for the first time to study the structure of the dust cores on scales of 0.1  pc and below .",
    "previous , single dish studies were limited in the modelling to larger scales , hence probing only the outer envelope ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we have used the infrared radiative transfer models of @xcite to model the inner structure of the cores .",
    "results of spherical dust models containing embedded heating sources with luminosity of @xmath7l@xmath8 were ` reobserved ' with the spatial - frequency coverage of the bima observations and then compared to the observations directly in fourier space .",
    "density power laws ( with indices ranging from 1.5 to 2.0 ) can be fit to the data , but they break down on scales of approximately 2000 au .",
    "it is not yet clear what happens within this radius .",
    "currently , we can not distinguish between , e.g. , optically thick embedded disks ( cf @xcite ) or , on the other extreme , a dust free inner bubble .",
    "emission was detected from 38 transitions from 18 species , although not all lines and species were detected in each source .",
    "g9.62 showed the fewest lines ( @xmath912 for e , 15 for the hot core source g9.62f ) and the least number of high excitation transitions .",
    "in contrast , g10.47 displayed 38 lines within the 1.6 ghz passband , a line density of 25 lines per ghz . by way of comparison ,",
    "single - dish studies of hot cores have detected only half this quantity ( @xcite ) , demonstrating not only the richness the spectrum of hot cores but also how much potential information millimetre interferometry is capable of yielding .",
    "the lowest energy line detected was the 2@xmath101 line of c@xmath2o ; the highest energy is the 25(3)@xmath1024(4 ) @xmath11 transition of ch@xmath12oh which lies 986 k above the ground state .",
    "note too that this methanol line is a high-@xmath13 line and thus is probably collisionally excited in hot gas , rather than pumped by infrared radiation from the warm dust .    in figure  [ linedata ]",
    "we present images of h@xmath0s 2(2,0)@xmath102(1,1 ) , ch@xmath12oh 7(1)@xmath108(0)@xmath11 and hnco 10(0,10)@xmath109(0,9 ) superimposed on the 1.4-mm continuum emission .",
    "g9.62 contains up to 9 hii  regions ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , a to i. figure  [ linedata ] marks the location of hii  regions d to g. the hot core is g9.62f , while g9.62e also appears to be a deeply embedded massive young stellar object .",
    "all the lines detected towards g9.62 peak at the position of f although most are also detected towards e. so and h@xmath0s are the brightest lines towards both e and f. the linewidths are consistently higher towards the hot core source ( typically 8 kms@xmath1  for f compared with 5 kms@xmath1  for e ) , possibly due to the presence of the outflow from f ( @xcite ) .",
    "g10.47 may be the most evolved of the sources here since there does appear to be two uchii  regions embedded within the hot core .",
    "the uchii  region marked b in figure  [ linedata ] splits into two ( b1 and b2 ) at higher resolution ( @xcite ) .",
    "g10.47 has the brightest and broadest emission lines in our sample .",
    "since the continuum brightness temperature is of order 100 k ( see above ) the presence of 4050 k lines indicates gas temperatures in excess of 150 k. the typical linewidth is @xmath913 kms@xmath1 .",
    "the brightest line in the passband is the 9(1,8)@xmath109(1,9 ) transition of h@xmath0co ( 59 k ) .",
    "surprisingly the second brightest is the 24(4,20)@xmath1023(4,19 ) transition of ethyl cyanide ( 52 k ) .",
    "two very high excitation lines of methanol ( with upper energy levels exceeding 950 k above ground ) were detected towards g10.47 .    as shown in figure  [ linedata ] , the emission from h@xmath0s and methanol is extended .",
    "although no clear outflow is seen , the extension of the emission is asymmetric and could be part of a bipolar outflow . the ethyl cyanide ( not shown )",
    "distribution resembles that of a shell , supporting the outflow interpretation . on the whole ,",
    "the nitrogen - bearing species have a more compact distribution than oxygen - bearing species .",
    "in particular , the hnco lines show a more compact appearance with increasing energy .",
    "g29.96 is a spectacular cometary hii  region ( @xcite ) . like g34.26 + 0.15 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) ,",
    "the hot core lies close to the tip of the cometary bow shape and is thus a prime candidate for testing whether hot cores are internally heated by an embedded source or externally heated by radiation from ob stars in the nearby hii   region . in our observations all line emission originates from the hot core .",
    "no line emission is detected towards the uchii  region .",
    "furthermore , all the line emission peaks on the hot core itself with no evidence for stratification of species by type or excitation .",
    "most notably , the hnco lines ( believed to be pumped by mid- and far - infared radiation ) all peak on the dust core , as do optically thinner species such as h@xmath14co .",
    "thus in g29.96 all evidence points towards the hot core being internally heated , presumably by a luminous embedded protostar .",
    "the lack of line emission towards the uchii  region and the presence of line emission to the west of the hot core further supports the hypothesis that the cometary hii  region is a champagne flow .",
    "g31.41 is the second richest source in our sample with 37 detected lines .",
    "the two high - energy lines of methanol were detected towards g31.41 as well .",
    "the lines are slightly narrower than those of g10.47 ( @xmath9 10 kms@xmath1 ) , although our spectral resolution is not sufficient to distinguish such differences to high accuracy .",
    "the continuum emission is slightly elongated in the same direction as the ammonia ( 4,4 ) core detected by @xcite suggesting they are tracing the same structure .    intriguingly , and more clearly than in g10.47 ,",
    "the methanol and h@xmath0s shown in figure  [ linedata ] appear to trace a shell of emission perhaps indicative of an outflow .",
    "alternatively , the emission south of the hot core ( seen in the methanol image ) may be a separate source since it is evident in several other lines .",
    "the hnco peaks on the hot core , presumably at the position of the strongest infrared radiation field .      the higher - spectral resolution observations of h@xmath0s revealed non - gaussian line wings towards all four targets .",
    "it is known that g9.62f houses an embedded source which drives an outflow seen in hco@xmath15 ( @xcite ) , although our h@xmath0s does not show a clear bipolar distribution .",
    "the most striking result is for g29.96 ( shown in figure 2 ) in which spatially - bipolar red- and blue - shifted line wings are seen centred on the hot core .",
    "the so 6(5)@xmath105(4 ) emission is also extended in the direction of the h@xmath0s lobes .",
    "furthermore , the methanol masers of @xcite are aligned with this flow .",
    "this result provides further evidence for the presence of luminous protostellar sources embedded within hot cores .",
    "in g10.47 and g31.41 , three lines of methanol and four transitions of hnco were detected .",
    "three transitions of hnco were detected in g29.96 .",
    "we have constructed rotation diagrams ( e.g. @xcite ) which are shown in figure  [ rotdiag ] .",
    "these confirm the expectation from the above results that g10.47 and g31.41 contain hotter cores than the other sources in our sample with g10.47 being the hottest .",
    "clearly more data points are desirable , especially of methanol , in order to constrain these fits further .",
    "the temperature of 505 k in g10.47 is the highest yet determined from molecular line observations of hot cores .",
    "however , it should be noted that the lowest energy line of methanol used in this derivation may be optically thick , which would give rise to an artificially high rotation temperature .",
    "as pointed out above , the high energy lines of methanol are probably excited by collisions as they come from levels with high @xmath13 ( = 25 and 24 ) .",
    "thus they reflect the actual gas kinetic temperature on radii of 1500 to 2000 au from the central source .",
    "it is not certain whether these temperatures represent those of the ambient gas or merely a shocked component .    for the hnco lines ,",
    "it is likely that their excitation is via a strong mid - infrared radiation field ( @xcite ) .",
    "all the hnco lines we have detected are from the same @xmath13(upper ) state but lie in different @xmath16 ladders ( @xcite ) .",
    "transitions between different @xmath16-levels are very rapid and require either very high densities ( exceeding 10@xmath17@xmath6 ) or a mid- to far - infared radiation field .",
    "lower values of @xmath16 are excited at longer wavelengths .",
    "the detection of the @xmath18 transition at 750 k above ground indicates a significant 20-@xmath19 m radiation field . @xcite",
    "have detected the hot core in g29.96 at 18 @xmath19 m supporting the hnco detections .",
    "we have used the bima millimetre array to observe a sample of four uchii  regions at a wavelength of 1.4 mm with subarcsecond resolution . in each case",
    "we detect compact dust cores spatially distinct from the uchii  regions , showing that the hot cores mark the location of a hot dense condensation of gas and dust .",
    "dust emission is also detected within the shell of the cometary uchii  region g29.96 .",
    "modelling of the dust emission reveals density power laws with indices of 1.5 to 2 beyond a radius of @xmath92000 au .",
    "it is tempting to speculate that within this radius either no dust is present or the geometry changes from spherical to axisymmetric , although further observations with higher sensitivity on long baselines are required to validate either of these options .",
    "line emission from 38 transitions of 18 molecular species has been detected .",
    "g10.47 shows the greatest number of lines , with g31.41 coming a close second . in each of these sources",
    "two high - energy lines of ch@xmath12oh are observed with upper - level energies in excess of 950 k above the ground state .",
    "the high @xmath13 number for these transitions suggests that they are collisionally excited and are thus tracing highly excited gas .",
    "the spectral line emission peaks towards the dust cores with no strong evidence of excitation and/or chemical gradients , which indicates that the hot cores are probably not externally heated .",
    "further evidence for internal heating comes from the observation of spatially - resolved bipolar wing emission from h@xmath0s in g29.96 .",
    "our observations point towards these hot cores as housing massive , luminous protostellar objects which have yet to develop a uchiiregion ."
