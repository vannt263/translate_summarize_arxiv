    "elhc  10 ( also known as [ be74 ] 561 , 2mass j05194770 - 6939121 or ogle lmc - lpv-41682 ) is a binary system with period of 219.9 dogle / cvs/ ] , located near the nebular complex n120 @xcite in the bar of the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) ; it was identified as a h@xmath3 emission - line star by @xcite .",
    "the name elhc10 for this object was proposed by @xcite and @xcite , who searched the eros database for blue objects with irregular photometric behavior similar to galactic herbig ae / be stars in the lmc bar .",
    "elhc  10 was the reddest and brightest star in their sample , with a color @xmath4 and estimated absolute magnitude of @xmath5 .",
    "the low resolution spectrum showed emission in h@xmath6 with equivalent width of -23  .",
    "contrary to the other stars in their sample , this star was not an early b star ; the spectrum was more compatible with an early f - type giant or supergiant .",
    "the spectral type was estimated as f2/5 i - ii , and the object was included in a sample of haebe stars @xcite .",
    "although herbig ae/ be stars ( or haebe ) are emission - line stars of spectral types o , b , a and in a few cases f , and in most instances exhibit ir excesses , which are attributed to dust emission from circumstellar discs , this star is hardly a haebe candidate , due to the much evolved nature of the luminous component .    in this paper ,",
    "we focus on resolving the uncertainty about the nature of this system by performing an analysis of the stellar components and the surrounding environment . high - resolution spectra and very accurate @xmath7 light curves allowed us to study elhc 10 in unprecedented detail for the first time .",
    "we find that the brightest member of this binary has a low surface gravity and an atmosphere depleted in refractory elements and might be identified as a member of the subclass of post - asymptotic giant branch stars .",
    "in addition , we provide evidence for the existence of a circumbinary disc and a circumstellar opaque disc .",
    "there are many substantial evidences for stable and compact keplerian circumbinary disks around many post - agb objects @xcite .",
    "additionally the binary nature of the disc source has been in some cases confirmed , with the most famous example certainly being hd 44179 , better known as the red rectangle nebula ( @xcite ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) ) .",
    "two other important cases where it has been possible to test the existence of stable keplerian discs and the correlation with binarity in post - agb stars have been reported by @xcite .",
    "hence , the present work aims to inquire into the nature of elhc 10 bringing new light on the formation of stable discs in these binary systems , which are produced presumably by means of interaction with the companion , when the more massive component becomes either a red giant ( rg ) or an agb star .",
    "actually , these amazing and rare systems might represent a new evolutionary channel that until now has been poorly studied .",
    "in section 2 we present a detailed report of the photometric and spectroscopic observations used in this paper . in section 3",
    "we analyze these observations to obtain the orbital ephemeris and a preliminary spectral type for the more luminous component .",
    "the spectral energy distribution is also analyzed in this section and a radial velocity study is presented .",
    "a study of line profiles yields to detailed parameters of the more prominent star . in section 4",
    "we use results of our radial velocity study to get information about masses and offer an interpretation of discrete absorption components ( dacs ) in terms of mass exchange and mass loss in an interacting binary .",
    "finally , in section 5 we provide the conclusions of our work .",
    "in this paper we call the primary star the stellar component whose absorption lines are detected in the spectrum , while the secondary is the undetected ( and more massive ) star .",
    "let s remember that this scenario of a less evolved more massive star can be possible in case of past or present mass transfer by roche - lobe overflow , as happens in algols .",
    "quantities relative to these stars are labeled with subindexes _ 1 _ and _ 2 _ , respectively .",
    "[ tabla0 ]    [ cols=\"<,<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the circumbinary disc analyzed in this section is different from the opaque structure around the secondary .",
    "in fact , balmer emission can be produced in a relatively hot disc ( t @xmath8 10.000 @xmath1 ) but the opaque structure ( probably another disc ) around the secondary is cool ; it does not contribute significantly to the flux in the optical region as evident from the constancy of line depths during the orbital cycle , even during eclipse ( fig .",
    "[ feba_ii ] ) .",
    "coexistent circumstellar and circumbinary discs have been also found in some post - agb binaries @xcite .",
    "line splitting is a very particular property of elhc10 .",
    "it is observed in metallic lines , especially lines of fei , feii and tiii , but disappears near secondary minimum at @xmath9 = 0.47 . since these lines are stronger at this phase , it is possible that dacs and photospheric lines are blended .",
    "line splitting are not observed in baii , cai , mgii and siii lines except during main eclipse at phase @xmath9 = 0.04 ( at least baii and siii that are spectrally covered at this phase ) .",
    "line splitting occurs in the form of dacs displaced to the red or blue side of the photospheric line .",
    "line splitting has been observed in lines of heavy elements in post - agb stars with c - rich circumstellar environments and explained by structured atmospheres @xcite .",
    "for instance , in v5112sgr the baii line profiles are split in multiple components @xcite .",
    "the case of elhc10 is different , since its primary is not carbon - rich and the alternated visibility of dacs during the orbital cycle exclude any interpretation in terms of an structured envelope .",
    "in fact , lines formed in an structured envelope around the primary should follow the primary motion during the orbital cycle with a blue velocity shift , but not move from the red to the blue side of a line formed in the photosphere .",
    "in addition , we do not observe dacs in elhc  10 only in s - process elements , as in v5112sgr , but also in metallic lines of light elements .    in elhc10 dacs",
    "are probably formed by occultation of the primary photosphere by dense and extended gas regions co - rotating with the binary .",
    "this view is supported by the large strength of the features and their radial velocity behavior . since the number of available spectra",
    "is limited , we can not go deeper in this interpretation .",
    "evidence for interaction has been observed in the galactic post - agb star bd@xmath1046@xmath11 442 , an evolved binary with gas streams , jets and disc @xcite .",
    "contrary to elhc10 , this last system shows strong orbital variability at the h@xmath3 emission ; this line has been interpreted as formed in the disc around the secondary and the h@xmath3 blue - shifted absorption in terms of a disc jet @xcite .",
    "+      70 high probability and 1337 candidate post - agb lmc stars have been catalogued by @xcite .",
    "about half of them are probably binaries , a distinction made based on the shape of the spectral energy distribution , indicating a stable and likely keplerian disc .",
    "this is a surprising result , since one could expect that the residual material from the agb mass loss should be found in an expanding envelope .",
    "therefore , it has been suggested that the formation of a circumbinary disc plays a major role in the evolution of post - agb systems @xcite . very few of these binaries have been studied in detail . to our knowledge",
    ", elhc 10 could be the first post - agb binary in the large magellanic cloud , and the post - agb binary with the highest progenitor mass and the highest - mass companion known .",
    "hitherto the process of disc formation in post - agb stars remains obscure .",
    "for instance , @xcite and @xcite showed that the disc can be the result of the agb evolution after engulfing the companion with a common envelope .",
    "other scenario proposes a disc - like structure formed by wind accretion @xcite .",
    "finally , the disc can be the result of interaction between the agb wind and the disc jet @xcite .",
    "while these scenarios can be possible in some systems at some evolutionary stages , the current observations of elhc10 suggest that equatorial mass loss through the outer lagrangian points could form a circumbinary disc .",
    "this is consistent with roche - lobe overflow and the presence of a large and thick disc surrounding the secondary star .",
    "the kind of outflows that possibly explain the dacs have been predicted by hydrodynamical simulations of gas dynamics in close interacting binaries @xcite . to accept this view , we need to assume a non - standard evolution for the post - agb star , as explained in section 4.3 .",
    "in this paper we have studied the very interesting and complex eclipsing binary elhc10 , located in the young nebular complex n120 in the large magellanic cloud .",
    "while we have determined solid constrains for some parameters of the system , some others remains unbounded .",
    "the following is a list of our main conclusions :    * we find that elhc10 is a sb1 long - period eclipsing binary with the main eclipse produced by a dark structure hiding the secondary star . * for the primary we determined an effective temperature of 6500 @xmath0 250 @xmath1 , logg = 1.0 @xmath0 0.5 and luminosity 5970 l@xmath2 . * from their radial velocities",
    "we find a mass function of 7.37 @xmath0 0.55 m@xmath2 .",
    "* if the primary fills its roche lobe it also fits the core - luminosity relationship of a post - agb star with a mass of 0.625 m@xmath2 .",
    "the abundance pattern is consistent with this classification . *",
    "a 8.1 m@xmath2 primary fits the observed luminosity and temperature in a detached configuration , but implies a secondary of at least 16 m@xmath2 and it is hard to explain why this high - mass star is not visible and does not heat their surrounding dark structure .",
    "another problem with the high - mass primary is its late evolutionary stage , since the unseen secondary should be far more evolved , larger and luminous . *",
    "the very likely membership to the young nebular complex n120 suggests that the only way for the primary to has arrived to the observed advanced evolutionary stage ( low - mass primary case ) is from an initially much more massive star , something that could has occurred by mass transfer due to roche lobe overflow in a semidetached binary .",
    "* we find a prominent stationary h@xmath3 double emission line which we attribute to a circumbinary disc .",
    "* we discovered line splitting of metallic lines characterized by discrete absorption components ( dacs ) observed alternatively at the blue and red side of the photospheric line profiles during the orbital cycle . *",
    "these dacs are similar in appearance to those observed in carbon - rich post - agb stars @xcite , but can not be interpreted as evidence for structured atmosphere as done by these authors for carbon - rich post - agb systems .",
    "* one possible interpretation for the dacs observed in elhc10 are gas streams in an interacting binary .",
