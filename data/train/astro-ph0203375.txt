    "our position within the milky way galaxy ( mwg ) has made study of its large - scale structure and dynamics difficult .",
    "this is partly due to the sun s position within the dust layer of the mwg , as well as the difficulty of determining distances . nevertheless , in recent years",
    ", considerable progress has been made in understanding our galaxy .",
    "it is now clear that the mwg is a barred galaxy , as was first proposed by de vaucouleurs ( 1964 ) .",
    "evidence of this comes from the _",
    "cobe_/dirbe near infrared light distribution ( weiland  1994 ; dwek  1995 ; binney  1997 ) , star count asymmetries ( nakada  1991 ; whitelock & catchpole 1992 ; sevenster 1996 ; nikolaev & weinberg 1997 ; stanek   1997 ; hammersley  2000 ) , gas dynamics ( peters 1975 ; cohen & few 1976 ; liszt & burton 1980 ; gerhard & vietri 1986 ; mulder & liem 1986 ; binney  1991 ) and the large microlensing optical depth towards the bulge ( paczynski  1994 ; zhao  1996 )",
    ". a recent review of the structure of the bulge and disc can be found in gerhard ( 2001 ) .",
    "the principle dynamical parameter of a bar is its pattern speed , @xmath3 , since it determines the orbital structure of stars in the disc .",
    "bar pattern speeds can be parametrized by the distance - independent ratio @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the lagrangian radius at which the gravitational and centrifugal forces cancel out in the bar rest - frame ( @xmath12 is usually approximated by the axisymmetric corotation radius ) and @xmath13 is the bar semi - major axis .",
    "a bar is termed fast when @xmath14 .",
    "knowledge of bar pattern speeds constrains the dark matter ( dm ) content of disc galaxies : debattista & sellwood ( 1998 , 2000 ) argue that fast bars require that the disc they inhabit must be maximal , in the sense that the luminous disc provides most of the rotational support in the inner galaxy .",
    "some evidence for fast bars comes from hydrodynamical models of gas flow , particularly at the shocks .",
    "three such studies are : ngc 1365 ( @xmath15 , lindblad  1996 ) , ngc 1300 ( @xmath15 , lindblad & kristen 1996 ) , and ngc 4123 ( @xmath16 , weiner  2001 ) .    in the mwg",
    ", @xmath3 can be estimated by comparing hydrodynamical models of the inner mwg with the observed longitude - velocity , ( @xmath17 ) , diagram .",
    "several such studies have been carried out : englmaier & gerhard ( 1999 ) found @xmath18 kpc , @xmath19  and @xmath20 , while fux ( 1999 ) found @xmath21 kpc and @xmath22  and the preferred model of weiner & sellwood ( 1999 ) had @xmath23 kpc , @xmath24  and @xmath25 .",
    "binney  ( 1991 ) interpreted the ( @xmath17 ) diagram for hi , co and cs emission using orbits in a barred potential with @xmath26 .",
    "another method for measuring @xmath3 in the mwg involves the identification of the action of resonances : binney  ( 1997 ) suggested that a local density maximum along the minor axis seen in the dust - corrected infrared _",
    "cobe_/dirbe data could be identified with the location of a lagrange point , which gave @xmath27 , having assumed @xmath28 and given the value of @xmath13 from the deprojection .",
    "dehnen ( 1999 ) argued that the bimodal distribution of stellar velocities in the solar neighborhood , as observed by _",
    "hipparcos _ , is due to the action of the outer lindblad resonance ( olr ) , whereby he obtained @xmath29 .",
    "sevenster ( 1999 ) suggested that features in the distribution of  stars can be used to locate the corotation and inner lindblad resonances , giving @xmath30   ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "the differences in these pattern speed measurements reflect uncertainties in viewing geometry , @xmath13 , rotation curve and bar axis ratio .",
    "the mwg also has spiral structure in it , which is less well constrained .",
    "even the number of arms , whether two or four , continues to be an issue of some discussion .",
    "valle ( 1995 ) reviews a variety of different observational tracers , and concludes that the spirals are four - armed , logarithmic and have a pitch angle , @xmath32 .",
    "more recently , drimmel & spergel ( 2001 ) found that a two arm spiral structure dominates the non - axisymmetric near - infrared emission .",
    "the pattern speeds of spirals are generally quite poorly constrained . when a bar is present , as in the mwg",
    ", the expectation that spirals are driven by it (  sanders & huntley 1976 ) would seem to require that the bar and spirals share a common pattern speed .",
    "this idea appears to be further reinforced by the observation that many such spirals connect with the bar ends .",
    "sellwood & sparke ( 1988 ) , however , presented @xmath33-body simulations in which bars and spirals had different pattern speeds , but with the spirals still generally connected to the bar ends .",
    "tagger   ( 1987 ) and sygnet  ( 1988 ) , proposed that the pattern speeds of the bar and spirals are non - linearly resonantly coupled , with the corotation of the bar marking the inner lindblad resonance of the spiral .",
    "toomre s ( 1981 ) swing amplification theory of spiral structure formation requires a radially ( and possibly temporally ) varying pattern speed .",
    "modal theories of spiral formation , on the other hand , depend on a ( nearly ) constant spiral pattern speed in space ( but not necessarily in time , see bertin & lin 1996 ) .",
    "measurements of spiral pattern speeds in external galaxies are still quite few , generally assume a radially constant @xmath3 and tend to give conflicting results .",
    "for example , the spiral pattern speed in m81 has been measured in a variety of ways but so far no unique pattern speed has been found ( see discussion in canzian 1993 ) .",
    "the situation is not much better in the mwg .",
    "morgan ( 1990 ) was able to model the distribution of pulsars within roughly 10 kpc of the sun with spirals of @xmath34 , regardless of the arm multiplicity .",
    "on the other hand , amaral & lpine ( 1997 ) , using the positions and ages of young open clusters within @xmath35 kpc of the sun , estimated @xmath36 .",
    "mishurov & zenina ( 1999 ) used the velocity field of a sample of cepheids which were less than 5 kpc from the sun to conclude that the sun is displaced outwards from the corotation by @xmath37 kpc ( then @xmath38 ) .",
    "a direct method for measuring @xmath3 in systems satisfying the continuity equation was developed by tremaine & weinberg ( 1984 ) .",
    "this method has successfully been applied to four barred galaxies so far : ngc 936 ( @xmath39 , merrifield & kuijken 1995 ) , ngc 4596 ( @xmath40 , gerssen  1998 ) , ngc 7079 ( @xmath41 , debattista & williams 2001 ) and ngc 1023 ( @xmath42 , debattista  2002 ) . in view of the spread in previous measurements of pattern speeds in the mwg , it is worth considering whether this method may not also be applied it .",
    "kuijken & tremaine ( 1991 ) have already derived an equivalent of the tremaine - weinberg method for the mwg ; their main goal was to constrain the radial motion of the local standard of rest ( lsr ) .",
    "applying this method to the hi distribution , they found that pattern speeds from @xmath43 to @xmath44 are possible for an lsr with a radial velocity , @xmath45  to 8 .    in this paper",
    ", we explore the tremaine - weinberg method for the mwg .",
    "this method , unlike others , has the considerable advantage of being model independent . in the general case ,",
    "the only assumption made is that the non - axisymmetric density distribution is in stationary cylindrical rotation (  @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the distance from the galactic centre ) . while this assumption breaks down in some cases (  if the mwg disc is strongly interacting with a companion ) , it is expected to be a very good approximation inside the solar circle .",
    "since we also wish to apply the method to real data , we have made a number of simplifying assumptions .",
    "for example , we assume that there is one unique pattern speed in the inner mwg ; if this is not the case , then some density and asymmetry weighted average pattern speed is measured .",
    "the value of @xmath3 obtained depends sensitively on the assumed radial velocity of the lsr ; however this dependence can be stated explicitly .",
    "the method requires complete samples of tracers : one such sample is obtained from the atca / vla oh 1612 mhz survey of  stars .    in  [ theory ] , we derive the three - dimensional version of the tremaine - weinberg method for the mwg , with the solar and lsr motion taken into account .",
    "we test the method in  [ tests ] , using simple models , exploring under what circumstances the method works best . in ",
    "[ survey ] , we introduce the atca / vla oh 1612 mhz survey , and describe how we selected a sample of older , relaxed  stars from it .",
    "we also discuss our completeness corrections for the survey data .",
    "then in  [ results ] , we present the pattern speed analysis for our sample of  stars .",
    "since the integrals in the tremaine - weinberg method measure asymmetries between positive and negative longitude , they are susceptible to noise and/or observational bias ; therefore in  [ results ] , we present corroborating evidence for the signal we find .",
    "finally , in  [ discons ] , we discuss our results in terms of mwg structure and prospects for using the same method with future data sets .",
    "starting from the continuity equation and the assumption that the visible surface density , @xmath48 , of a barred ( or otherwise non - axisymmetric ) disc depends on time , @xmath49 , in the following simple way : @xmath50 where @xmath51 are arbitrary cartesian coordinates in the plane of the disc , and @xmath52 the corresponding polar coordinates , tremaine & weinberg ( 1984 ) showed that the pattern speed , @xmath3 , can be written as : @xmath53 here , @xmath54 is the line - of - sight ( minus the systemic ) velocity , @xmath55 is an arbitrary continuous weight function , @xmath56 is the inclination angle and @xmath57 are galaxy - centered coordinates along the disc s apparent major and minor axis respectively .",
    "the tremaine - weinberg ( tw ) method needs a tracer of the non - axisymmetric feature which satisfies the continuity equation .",
    "the old stellar population in undisturbed sb0 type disc galaxies provides an ideal tracer of the surface density .",
    "the short lifetimes of massive stars precludes their use as tracers .",
    "moreover , gas can not be used as a tracer because of its conversion between atomic and molecular states , although modelling may be used to describe such conversions ( bienaym  1985 ) .",
    "we now seek to derive an equivalent to the tw method for the mwg .",
    "our position within the mwg disc gives a unique viewing geometry which does not permit the standard tw method of equation ( [ standard ] ) to be used .",
    "as shown by kuijken & tremaine ( 1991 ) , however , it is still possible to use the continuity equation to derive an expression for a pattern speed in the mwg . here",
    ", we re - derive their two - dimensional expression before considering the three - dimensional case . assuming equation ( [ dens ] )",
    "holds , the continuity equation in the plane of the disc can be written : @xmath58 switching to sun - centered cylindrical coordinates @xmath59 , ( where @xmath60 is the usual galactic longitude and @xmath61 is the distance from the sun ) , this becomes : @xmath62 \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\frac{1}{r}{\\frac { \\partial ( r \\mu v_r)}{\\partial r } } + \\frac{1}{r } { \\frac { \\partial ( \\mu v_l)}{\\partial l } } = 0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in this equation , @xmath63 is the velocity in the @xmath59 frame and @xmath4 is the distance of the sun from the galactic centre .",
    "typically , the component @xmath64 is not available ; fortunately , this term drops out after an integration over @xmath60 : @xmath65 if we now multiply by @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is an arbitrary function vanishing at the sun , and integrate over @xmath61 , we obtain , after some rearrangement : @xmath68 where we have assumed that @xmath69 goes to zero at infinity and @xmath70 .",
    "all the quantities on the right hand side of the above equation are observable .    in the case of discrete tracers ,",
    "the surface density gets replaced by a sum over delta functions and the above expression is replaced by : @xmath71 thus @xmath72 can be thought of as a detection probability for the discrete tracers .    in equation ( [ int2d ] ) above , we integrated @xmath60 from @xmath73 to @xmath74 .",
    "but if the non - axisymmetric part of @xmath48 is limited to the range @xmath75 $ ] , it is then trivial to show that these integration limits are sufficient , since axisymmetric components do not contribute to the integrals , and all surface terms resulting from the @xmath60 integrals vanish by symmetry .",
    "it is necessary , however , that the integrals extend from @xmath76 to @xmath77 (  integration in the range @xmath78 $ ] , with @xmath79 gives incorrect results . )    when the bar is either along or perpendicular to the line of sight , the numerator and denominator of equation ( [ inert2d ] ) are zero , and @xmath80 can not be determined .",
    "this is to be compared with the standard tw equation , where @xmath3 can not be measured for a bar along the apparent major or minor axis of the disc .      in 3d ,",
    "the derivation is more or less the same .",
    "the sun - centered spherical polar coordinates are now @xmath81 , with @xmath0 being the standard galactic coordinates and @xmath82 the distance from the sun . following a triple integral much in the spirit of the 2d case ,",
    "we obtain : @xmath83 where @xmath84 must be such that all the non - axisymmetric parts are included .",
    "if the system is symmetric about the mid - plane , then the @xmath85 integral can extend over the region @xmath86 $ ] only : data of this kind are easier to obtain . a discrete version of this equation is given by : @xmath87 where we have introduced a new notation for the integrals .",
    "( note that one factor of @xmath88 drops out because of the jacobian in the delta functions . ) in the limit that all the tracers are in a plane , equation ( [ inert3d ] ) reduces to equation ( [ inert2d ] ) of the 2d case .",
    "both @xmath89 and @xmath90 are defined as integrals / sums over @xmath60 ranging from @xmath76 to @xmath77 .",
    "since @xmath91 and @xmath92 change sign across @xmath93 , the integrals will partially cancel out .",
    "thus @xmath89 and @xmath90 largely measure a difference across @xmath93 .",
    "when the difference is small , @xmath89 and @xmath90 are small and the measured @xmath80 will be poorly determined .",
    "this can be seen from the expression for the variance in @xmath80 : @xmath94}}{\\om r_0}\\right)^2 =    \\left(\\frac{\\sigma_\\kin}{\\kin}\\right)^2 +    \\left(\\frac{\\sigma_\\pin}{\\pin}\\right)^2 $ ] . to be more explicit by what we mean by small ,",
    "we define @xmath95 , with a similar definition for @xmath96 .",
    "( in this notation @xmath97 and similarly for @xmath90 . ) then we introduce the variables @xmath98 these two parameters , which take values in the range @xmath99 $ ] , quantify the degree of global asymmetry in the system .",
    "when @xmath100 , no asymmetry signal is present ( but note that the system need not be axisymmetric , or even symmetric in projection ) while when @xmath101 the observed system is maximally asymmetric . in  [ tests",
    "] , we use simple models to explore the dependence of measurement errors on @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "several complications may arise , including multiple pattern speeds , non - stationary pattern speeds , solar motion ,   here we discuss issues related to violations of the density assumption in eqn .",
    "[ dens ] , deferring discussion of solar motion to  [ subsec : solar_motion ] .",
    "possible violations of eqn . [ dens ] include :    1 .   _ multiple pattern speeds .",
    "_ the mwg has a bar and spirals , perhaps also a small lopsidedness ; almost certainly all have different pattern speeds . to understand how these will affect the measurement ,",
    "we suppose that there are @xmath104 non - axisymmetric features superposed , so that eqn .",
    "[ dens ] becomes @xmath105 .",
    "each of these asymmetries gives rise to integrals @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "then , by the linearity of the continuity equation , we can write @xmath108 . dividing both sides by @xmath109 , we obtain @xmath110 , where @xmath111 is the average of the different pattern speeds , weighted by the @xmath106 s .",
    "thus the average is weighted by both the asymmetry and the density ( since if @xmath112 then @xmath113 ) .",
    "therefore , small perturbations to the disk density do not contribute very significantly to @xmath111 .",
    "however , since the @xmath106 s can be either positive or negative , @xmath111 is not limited to values in the range @xmath114 and @xmath115 ( unless all the @xmath106 s have the same sign ) .",
    "if distances are available , @xmath72 can be varied , to test for such cancellations ; otherwise , strong changes in the slope of @xmath89 as a function of @xmath77 may be used to test for cancellations .",
    "+ note that winding spiral arms are a special case of the multiple pattern speed situation . in this case",
    ", @xmath3 is a continuously varying function of distance from the galactic center .",
    "this case is discussed further in  [ future ] .",
    "2 .   _ radial oscillations . _",
    "if such oscillations were present , eqn .",
    "[ dens ] would become @xmath116 , where we assume @xmath117 is small .",
    "the time - derivative term in the continuity equation therefore becomes @xmath118 the ratio @xmath119 is then given by @xmath120 , where , for concreteness , we have assumed that the disk is exponential with scale - length @xmath121 and the azimuthal density variation is of the form @xmath122 . for a simple estimate , we assume @xmath123 .",
    "therefore we obtain @xmath124 ; at @xmath125 kpc , if the circular velocity is 220 , @xmath126  and @xmath127 kpc ( bissantz  2002 ) , we obtain @xmath128 kpc@xmath129 .",
    "thus radial oscillations with amplitude larger than about 100 pc will strongly interfere with the measurement of pattern speeds using the tw method . however , radial oscillations are expected to be strongly landau damped , and it would be very surprising if the mwg exhibits large radial oscillations .",
    "3 .   _ growing amplitudes . _ in this case , we can replace eqn .",
    "[ dens ] with @xmath130 , where @xmath131 ( @xmath132 ) represents a growing ( damped ) feature .",
    "the term @xmath133 is included to make explicit the fact that the density of the feature grows at the expense of a background axisymmetric disc ( for which @xmath134 ) , to conserve the total mass .",
    "the time - derivative term is now replaced by @xmath135 it is possible to propagate the term in @xmath136 through the calculation , giving , in the 2d case @xmath137 eqn .",
    "[ growing ] contains both @xmath72 and @xmath67 , and therefore requires distance data for a solution . lacking distances",
    ", we estimate the interference from growing features by the ratio @xmath119 , which , for an @xmath138 azimuthal density variation , is given by @xmath139 .",
    "thus the growth term is important when the growth rate is of order the pattern speed ( in which case it is safe to ignore damping ) . since rapid growth",
    "is mostly restricted to the low amplitude , linear regime , while @xmath102 can only be large enough for an accurate measurement once growth is nearly saturated , we expect that rapid growth is unlikely to significantly interfere with pattern speed measurements",
    ". + the most important growing structures are spirals .",
    "if they are modal , they can grow even when tightly wound .",
    "the theoretically computed growth rates vary substantially ;  the fastest growing two arm modes in the flat - rotation , cut - out discs of evans & read ( 1998 ) have @xmath140 .",
    "time - varying pattern speeds .",
    "_ in this case , eqn .",
    "[ dens ] gets replaced by @xmath141 .",
    "although this introduces a new term , proportional to @xmath142 , it also changes the angle derivative to one in the bar rest frame . a simple transformation to a time @xmath143 in which the moment of observation is @xmath144 recovers eqn . [ threed ] .",
    "thus a time - varying pattern speed does not disturb the tw method .",
    "we have considered several violations of the density condition of eqn .",
    "[ dens ] . of these , perhaps the most likely are growing spirals , but it is unclear how rapidly growing spirals are",
    ". most likely , if spirals are of sufficient amplitude to give large signals , then their growth rate can not be too large .",
    "this may be sorted with more detailed data on the mwg density distribution than we currently have , such as will be available with future astrometric missions . for the present work",
    ", we have assumed that there are no ( strong ) non - axisymmetric structures with rapidly growing amplitudes .",
    "we derived equation ( [ threed ] ) for an inertial frame .",
    "any radial velocities that can be measured will be heliocentric , and therefore the motion of the sun needs to be taken into account .",
    "the sun s velocity can be decomposed into two parts : a motion of the local standard of rest , @xmath145 , and the peculiar motion of the sun relative to the lsr , @xmath146 .",
    "we assume that the motion of the lsr consists of two parts , a tangential motion around the mwg centre with velocity @xmath147 , where @xmath148 is in the direction towards the galactic centre and @xmath149 is the in - plane tangential direction .",
    "then , if velocities in the heliocentric frame are labelled as @xmath150 , we can write @xmath151 . thus equation ( [ inert3d ] )",
    "can be rewritten : @xmath152 this equation , which is the 3d form of the tw equation derived by kuijken and tremaine ( 1991 ) , is used in the analysis of the  star sample below .",
    "it contains two quantities , @xmath5 and @xmath1 which must be determined from other data . here",
    ", @xmath5 includes the circular velocity ; reid  ( 1999 ) measured @xmath153  for @xmath8 kpc , from the apparent proper motion of sgr a@xmath154 , while from a similar measurement backer & sramek measured @xmath155 .",
    "the uncertainty in @xmath1 leads to a much larger uncertainty in @xmath156 , largely because @xmath157 depends on the @xmath158 s , which do not cancel across @xmath159 .",
    "the tw equation for external galaxies is similarly sensitive to the relative motion of the observer and the observed galaxy , but in that case reflection symmetry is used to minimize this sensitivity . in the absence of distance information , no similar symmetry argument can be deployed in the mwg",
    ". the solar peculiar motion , @xmath160 , has been measured with _ hipparcos _",
    "data by dehnen & binney ( 1998 ) .",
    "they found @xmath161 .",
    "( these correspond to velocity components that are radially inwards , in the direction of galactic rotation and vertically upwards , respectively . ) in the absence of a radial motion of the lsr , we will then be measuring @xmath2 ,   the negative of the solar velocity in the bar s rest frame .    in the coordinate system we are working in",
    ", a star moving away from the lsr has a positive @xmath162 ; inside the solar circle , such stars will primarily be at positive @xmath60 . therefore ,",
    "if a positive @xmath156 is measured , this will correspond to a non - axisymmetric feature in the inner mwg with a pattern speed @xmath163 , which must therefore be rotating in the same sense as the disc .",
    "the variance in @xmath156 due to the errors in the sun s measured peculiar velocity is given by : @xmath164 ( where we have assumed that errors in position measurements are insignificant ) .",
    "note that , in this expression , the dominant term is the coefficient of @xmath165 , since @xmath166 is everywhere positive in the range @xmath167 .",
    "we now test the tw method on some simple models .",
    "our goal is not so much to test for specific structures expected in the mwg , since such an approach would say more about our models , which we would like to keep simple .",
    "rather , our goal here is to learn how reliable the tw method is under various _",
    "constraints , such as the number of discrete tracers , signal strength , restricted ranges of @xmath60 ,   errors from sources specific to our application are discussed in  [ results ] .    models used to test the tw method need to have velocity fields which preserve the assumed density distribution ,  the assumption of eqn .",
    "( [ dens ] ) needs to remain valid .",
    "however , because the continuity equation is purely kinematic , a model density distribution need not generate the potential required by the kinematics . here",
    "we test the method on models for a bar and a spiral , with application to the  stars in the atca / vla oh 1612 mhz survey of sevenster  ( 1997a , b & 2001 ) in mind .",
    "since  stars are concentrated in the inner mwg , our tests assume that the non - axisymmetric structure is inside the solar circle .",
    "we assume throughout that measurements of @xmath60 , @xmath85 and @xmath92 for individual stars have only small errors , which we ignore , as is appropriate for this survey .",
    "tests of the method for a realistic bar can be obtained from @xmath33-body simulations .",
    "we tested equation ( [ inert3d ] ) for a selection of the bars in the fully self - consistent , @xmath33-body simulations of debattista & sellwood ( 2000 ) , who measured @xmath3 from the time rate of change of the phase of the @xmath138 fourier component of the disc density . here",
    "we present the results of several experiments using their `` maximum disk '' simulation at @xmath168 , which is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] , when the bar was fast ( @xmath169 ) . at this time , @xmath170 ( where @xmath121 is the disc scale - length ) , which is about twice the size of the mwg bar .",
    "the viewer therefore was placed at @xmath171 ( within the disc ) .",
    "the angle of the bar to the sun - center line , @xmath172 , was varied in the expected range ( @xmath173 ) .",
    "the angle @xmath77 , within which the integrals @xmath89 and @xmath90 were evaluated , was varied in the range @xmath174 .",
    "the simulation included @xmath175 disc particles ; here we describe two experiments in which samples of 500 particles were selected . in the first experiment , particles were drawn using @xmath176 a gaussian with @xmath177 and @xmath178 .",
    "the second experiment used a cosine probability : @xmath179 with @xmath180 for @xmath181 and @xmath182 otherwise .",
    "[ fig03 ] plots the results , from which it is clear that the best results are obtained at large @xmath102 and @xmath103 ; since the gaussian probability selects particles in a more limited radial range , it often gives larger @xmath102 and @xmath103 and smaller errors .",
    "however , the cosine probability is likely to be more realistic for a flux - density - limited sample of tracers , since it preferentially selects nearby objects over distant ones .",
    "[ fig03 ] show that , when @xmath183 and @xmath184 , the expected error is on average @xmath185 , and never worse than @xmath186 .",
    "variations in @xmath172 , @xmath77 and @xmath4 mattered to the errors in @xmath156 only insofar as they changed @xmath102 and @xmath103 . for the gaussian @xmath176 experiment , increasing @xmath4 decreased @xmath102 and @xmath103 , with a corresponding increase in the fractional error .",
    "however , changes in @xmath172 ( within our range ) and @xmath77 did not substantially change @xmath102 and @xmath103 , and the error is not overly sensitive to variations in these parameters . for the cosine probability distribution , @xmath102 and @xmath103 were insensitive to variations in all 3 parameters .",
    "it is particularly reassuring that the errors do not depend on @xmath77 , provided that the bar is inside @xmath77 .",
    "stationary spiral models based on density wave theory are somewhat harder to construct . since we have already demonstrated that the tw method works well for bars , which have larger non - circular motions than do spirals , a crude spiral model with purely circular orbits suffices for a spiral test .",
    "we therefore generated an exponential disc in the radial range @xmath187 , consisting of two components , an axisymmetric component with particles on circular orbits at velocity 2.5 in some arbitrary units and a material ( rather than wave ) spiral part , which consisted of particles on circular orbits with constant @xmath188 .",
    "the spiral density varied tangentially as @xmath189 , where @xmath190 , to produce two - armed logarithmic spirals of pitch - angle @xmath191 , which we set to @xmath192 .",
    "both components were modelled by a gaussian vertically , with equal scale - heights .",
    "the axisymmetric component accounted for @xmath193 of the total mass , producing a spiral contrast consistent with that observed in external galaxies ( rix & zaritsky 1995 ) .",
    "the spiral component is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig04 ] .",
    "once we generated this system , we computed the integrals of equation [ inert3d ] for a variety of orientations . in fig .",
    "[ fig06 ] , we plot the errors at @xmath194 as before for the bar ; in all cases the error is @xmath195 when @xmath183 and @xmath184 .",
    "since our rather crude spiral model included no random motions , we expect that more realistic errors will resemble those we found for the bar , provided signals are large .",
    "our analysis of one orientation on a sample of 500 stars , selected with a gaussian probability of @xmath196 and @xmath197 , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig05 ] ; at @xmath198 , the error on @xmath156 is @xmath199 for this case . note that @xmath102 and @xmath103 are both less than 0.2 at @xmath198 , which is smaller than the signal seen in the stars (  [ results ] ) .",
    "the results for this orientation bear a striking resemblance to those of the  stars discussed in  [ apattspd ] .",
    "we ran a variety of additional tests of the tw method on our simple spiral system , with varying system orientation , radial probability function , number of particles selected , and reduced spiral mass fraction .",
    "these cases gave results consistent with those shown in fig .",
    "[ fig06 ] ; unsurprisingly , we found that the error decreases as the number of particles is increased .",
    "we have shown that , for 500 stars , we expect to be able to measure @xmath156 with average errors of @xmath185 , and always less than @xmath186 , for either a bar or a spiral , provided that signals are large ( @xmath102 and @xmath103 @xmath200 ) .",
    "furthermore , we found that limiting @xmath77 does not lead to large errors , provided that the full non - axisymmetric structure is included .",
    "in addition to the tests described above , we also experimented with other parameters , with results generally in agreement with those presented here .",
    "the notable exception was the case of discontinuous @xmath176 s , which gave large errors .",
    "such errors can be understood in terms of noisy surface terms in the integrals .",
    "lacking distance information , @xmath176 can only be a continuous function , corresponding to the detection probability .",
    "stars are oxygen - rich , cool agb stars in the superwind phase ( renzini 1981 ) with typical @xmath201 m@xmath202yr@xmath129 .",
    "the wind outflow velocity , @xmath203 , is @xmath204 , with @xmath203 larger in the more massive ( younger )  stars .",
    "the mass - loss rate is large compared to the stellar mass ( typically , 1 to 6 m@xmath205 ) and the superwind phase is therefore believed to be very short - lived @xmath206 yr ( whitelock & feast 1993 ) .",
    "thus they are rare objects . on the other hand",
    ", they are old objects , with ages @xmath207 gyr , and are therefore dynamically relatively relaxed .",

    "the strongest line of this maser is at 1612.23 mhz which is conveniently insensitive to interstellar extinction .",
    "the doppler shifted profile from the front and back of the thin oh shell permits easy identification of  stars , which makes possible an unbiased survey of these objects , tracing the kinematics of the inner mwg .",
    "a full review of the properties of  stars can be found in habing ( 1996 ) .",
    "we have used the data from the  star catalogue to search for pattern speeds in the inner mwg .",
    "the data were obtained in 3 surveys : the atca - bulge and atca - disc surveys ( sevenster  1997a , b ) at the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) , covering @xmath208 , @xmath209 and the vla - disc survey ( sevenster  2001 ) at the very large array ( vla ) , covering @xmath210 , @xmath211 .",
    "the atca region was covered uniformly with 1449 pointings . on the other hand ,",
    "only @xmath212 of the vla region was surveyed , with 965 pointings out of 1053 giving useful data . in all , the surveys produced 793 detections .",
    "the atca - bulge and vla - disc surveys have a small overlap region ( @xmath213 ) . in this overlap region",
    ", 27 sources were observed in both surveys , thus only 766 independent sources were found .",
    "however , the overlap region also included detections in either only the vla - disc or only the atca - bulge survey , which is , in part , a manifestation of the intrinsic variability of  stars .",
    "details of the reduction technique for the 3 surveys are contained in sevenster  ( 1997a , b ) and sevenster  ( 2001 ) .",
    "of the 793 detections , no outflow velocity was measured in 105 sources .",
    "since such objects can be supergiants or even star - forming regions , rather than  stars , and do nt have well  determined velocities , we have excluded them from our analysis .",
    "the use of two separate instruments for compiling the catalogue introduces a systematic difference in the completenesses of the two sides of the mwg .",
    "we corrected for the ( empirically determined ) completenesses , rewriting equation ( [ threed ] ) : @xmath214 where @xmath215 is a sum over pointings , @xmath216 is a sum over stars detected in pointing @xmath217 and @xmath218 is the completeness of pointing @xmath217 .",
    "the completenesses consist of two terms : @xmath219 .",
    "the first term , @xmath220 , is a measure of the fraction of the surveyed area that is within some threshold radius . for this purpose ,",
    "all vla pointings , including the missing ones , were treated identically , and the @xmath220 s were calculated by monte - carlo integration .",
    "the threshold radii were set by requiring a constant primary beam response ( pbr ) threshold , equal in both telescopes , for each pointing centre .",
    "the pbr of the two instruments is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig07 ] ; table [ tbcpa ] lists several pbr levels , with the corresponding offset radii and values of @xmath220 .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the second term , @xmath221 , is a completeness due to the noise level , and varies from pointing to pointing .",
    "the @xmath221 s were obtained from the observed  star cumulative flux density distribution , @xmath222 , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig08 ] , as the fraction of stars between the flux limits which are brighter than the detection threshold of each pointing .",
    "this is computed in the following way : @xmath223 here , @xmath224 and @xmath225 are the flux density limits we use , @xmath226 is the noise in pointing @xmath217 and @xmath227 is the multiplicative detection threshold ( @xmath228 empirically determined for vla - disc , atca - bulge , atca - disc respectively ) .",
    "we chose @xmath229 jy , since this is the highest of the lower absolute detection thresholds of the 3 surveys , and no upper limit on @xmath230 .",
    "the noise level was more variable in the vla - disc survey then in the atca surveys . in fig .",
    "[ fig09 ] , we plot the resulting distribution of the @xmath221 s .",
    "the three surveys had different velocity coverages : the atca - bulge survey covered @xmath231  @xmath232 , the atca - disc survey covered @xmath233  @xmath234 , while the vla - disc survey had full coverage in the range @xmath235  @xmath236 .",
    "thus the three surveys had full _",
    "velocity coverage from -200  to 200 .",
    "a considerable number of detections were obtained at @xmath237 , but these are mostly at @xmath238 .",
    "one detection was obtained at 270  in the atca - disc survey , but as this turned out to be a single - peaked object anyway , it was excluded from our analysis .",
    "typical errors in positions are @xmath239 for the atca surveys and @xmath240 for vla - disc survey .",
    "these position errors introduce negligible errors in the value of @xmath156 , as can be appreciated from equation [ threed ] .",
    "the velocity errors are of order 1  for the atca surveys , and 2.5  for the vla - disc survey .",
    "the velocity errors produce larger errors in @xmath156 , although , as will be seen below , these are still quite small .",
    "the values of @xmath92 reported in sevenster ( 1997a , b and 2001 ) included a correction for an assumed solar peculiar motion of 19.7  towards ra = 18:07:50.3 , dec = + 30:00:52 ( j2000.0 ) .",
    "for this study , we are adopting the solar peculiar motion found by dehnen & binney ( 1998 ) ; we have therefore had to transform from the sevenster  frame to that of dehnen & binney .",
    "the mass , and therefore age and luminosity , of  stars correlate with @xmath203 . for example , sevenster ( 2001 ) finds that  stars with @xmath241  have a mass of roughly @xmath242 and therefore an age of 1.8  ( 0.2 ) gyr .",
    "we can anticipate , therefore , that we will need to make cuts on @xmath203 .",
    "however , the @xmath203 s have been measured in units of half the channel - widths ( 2.27  for the vla - disc survey , and 1.46  for the atca surveys ) . to compensate for this effective binning , we have randomized the outflow velocities within each bin .",
    "we did this in a number of ways with similar results once random re - samplings were performed ; we have therefore relied on the simplest approach , namely to add to each @xmath203 a random value distributed uniformly between -1.2  and 1.2 .",
    "the luminosity , @xmath243 , of  stars increases with @xmath203 : simple models predict @xmath244 , while more sophisticated models predict @xmath245 ( habing  1994 ) .",
    "thus a flux density - limited sample will probe to different distances for different @xmath203 .",
    "in fig . [ fig10 ]",
    "we plot the maximum longitude , @xmath246 , of  stars versus @xmath203 , from which it can be seen that  stars of low @xmath203 are found only at small @xmath247 .",
    "we interpret this as resulting from the atca / vla oh 1612 mhz survey being able to detect only the very nearest faint  stars of a distribution ending inside the solar circle .",
    "for the faint stars , the effect of small scale number density fluctuations is large , both because only a small portion of the disc is seen and because the number of such stars is low .",
    "we have therefore chosen to exclude all  stars with @xmath248 .",
    "the tw method requires a sample of stars that form a relatively relaxed population ; a convenient cutoff criterion would be at least 2.5 rotations at 6 kpc .",
    "this requires ages greater than 0.5 gyr , or @xmath249 .",
    "however , since we have had to randomize the outflow velocities we used only stars with @xmath250 , to minimize contamination by very young stars .",
    "thus our final range in outflow velocities is @xmath251  @xmath252 , which is expected to cover a distance range of 4 to 10 kpc from the sun .",
    "the lower limit removes roughly @xmath253 of stars from the sample , while the upper limit removes a further @xmath254 .",
    "we computed @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 for @xmath255 in steps of @xmath256 .",
    "we set @xmath229 jy , pbr = 0.5 and excluded  stars with @xmath257 .",
    "we tried both using the atca and the vla in the overlap region . at each @xmath77 ,",
    "the values reflect averages over 100 monte - carlo experiments containing slightly different samples . in these experiments ,",
    "the @xmath203 s were randomized in their bins ( as described above ) and gaussian random errors of @xmath258  added to the radial velocities .",
    "these results are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] .",
    "it is immediately clear that there is effectively no difference between using the atca or the vla in the overlap region .",
    "therefore , since the atca survey tends to be less noisy , we use it from here on . for @xmath259 , both @xmath89 and @xmath90 are small and roughly constant , while @xmath102 and @xmath103 are noisy , suggesting they are strongly affected by poisson noise . in the range @xmath260 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 all",
    "grow very rapidly . at @xmath261",
    ", there is a sudden change in the slope of the number of included stars , which is associated with almost constant @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 at @xmath262 . in this region ,",
    "both @xmath102 and @xmath103 are @xmath200 , which our simple tests of  [ tests ] suggest is large enough for moderate error levels .",
    "averaging over @xmath263 , we obtain @xmath264 , where we have used one half of the difference between the maximum and minimum value for the error estimate since the values of @xmath265 at different @xmath77 are not independent .",
    "then , if @xmath7 , @xmath266 kpc and @xmath9  ( which we assume for the remainder of this paper except where otherwise noted ) , @xmath267 .    another way of presenting the data of fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] , where we plot the same data for @xmath198 but without the averaging of the various values of @xmath90 and @xmath89 resulting from the monte - carlo reshufflings of @xmath203 . in the upper panel of this figure ,",
    "we also plot lines of constant @xmath3 ( 40 , 50 , 60 , 70 and 80 ) assuming @xmath8 kpc and @xmath9  for @xmath7 and for @xmath268 . for the @xmath7 case ,",
    "the various re - samplings have average @xmath269 , while in the case of @xmath268 , average @xmath270 , graphically demonstrating the sensitivity of the value of @xmath3 obtained to a small radial lsr motion .",
    "the bottom panel also shows the effect of varying @xmath5 and @xmath4 , demonstrating that @xmath3 increases with decreasing @xmath4 and/or increasing @xmath5 .",
    "however , we will not be concerned here with errors on @xmath5 , @xmath4 and @xmath1 ; @xmath5 enters only in the ratio @xmath271 , which has been determined to @xmath253 accuracy , @xmath4 is determined to even higher accuracy , while the effect of @xmath1 is considered in ",
    "[ lsrradmot ] .",
    "note that the value of @xmath156 obtained this way is slightly different from that obtained by averaging over @xmath77 ; since the values of @xmath156 at different @xmath77 are not independent , we quote values of @xmath156 and @xmath3 based on @xmath198 only from now on .      before proceeding further",
    ", we present evidence that the signal we have measured is real , and not a result of a systematic error in either our analysis or the  star surveys . since @xmath90 and @xmath89 measure differences , any systematic error in our calculated completenesses of the vla or atca survey will be amplified into a signal .",
    "several reasons lead us to believe that this has not happened .",
    "firstly , the signals of fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] first become evident at a very clear region in the disc , which is well correlated with an observed structure . in fig .",
    "[ fig13 ] , we present contour maps of the surface density of  stars in the survey .",
    "these clearly show the presence of very significant over - densities localized at @xmath272 and @xmath273 .    while , there are roughly equal number of stars at positive and negative @xmath60 , ( _ despite the missing pointings , smaller _ pbhw _ and greater noise in the _ vla survey ) , for @xmath274 , there are 13  stars at negative @xmath60 and 24 at positive @xmath60 , which has less than @xmath253 probability , even without taking the lower vla detection probability into account .",
    "thus , when all the @xmath218 s are set to 1 (  when no completeness corrections are included ) , the qualitative behavior of @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 is unchanged , although , as is to be expected , signals are then smaller .",
    "systematic errors in the completenesses are not likely to be the source of this signal .",
    "suppose errors of the form @xmath275 and/or @xmath276 were present , and suppose further that the  stars sample only an axisymmetric part of the disc .",
    "it is then easy to show that @xmath277 which is approximately equal to @xmath278 in our case .",
    "since the noise errors are random , such a large systematic error would have to be in the values of the areal completenesses , which corresponds to roughly an overestimate ( underestimate ) by @xmath279 in the radius at any given pbr for the atca ( vla ) .",
    "such a large error is impossible since the pbr of both instruments is well determined .",
    "a systematic effect might be introduced by the different channel widths of the vla and the atca , but the similarity of the flux density distributions between the vla and the atca side suggests that , at most , this is a @xmath253 effect .",
    "furthermore , this effect acts to under - estimate the flux density of the sources detected by the vla , so that @xmath224 would remove from our sample more vla stars than atca stars , which would make @xmath89 negative , which is the opposite sign from what we found .",
    "further evidence that the signal of fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] is real comes from the dependence of the signal on @xmath85 .",
    "we explored the effects of limits in @xmath85 , finding that most of the non - axisymmetric signal comes from very close to the mwg plane , with little signal at @xmath280 ( which divides our sample of  stars into two roughly equal parts ) .",
    "this is unsurprising for a disc population : at 6 kpc , @xmath256 corresponds to roughly the disc scale - height .",
    "we found considerable fluctuations in the value of @xmath265 at @xmath263 obtained from @xmath280 , reinforcing the impression that the settling of @xmath265 in the previous experiments is not caused by systematic errors ,  in the completenesses .",
    "all these facts make it likely , therefore , that the signal is intrinsic to the sample .",
    "finally , it is perhaps worth drawing attention to the suggestive similarity between fig .",
    "[ fig05 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] .",
    "although the derived value of @xmath265 is nearly constant in the range @xmath281 , we can not completely exclude that extending the survey to larger @xmath77 would not lead to a different @xmath265 .",
    "however , the density of  stars is decreasing rapidly at @xmath198 : an extrapolation of the binned surface density suggests that their surface density will vanish at around @xmath282 , as is also suggested by the dynamical models of sevenster  ( 2000 ) .",
    "observationally , le squeren  ( 1992 ) found that the distribution of  stars is concentrated inside @xmath283 , with only roughly @xmath284 of sources outside this range .",
    "physically , this steep drop - off is the result of a metallicity gradient in the mwg disc : at the lower metallicities typical of the outer disc , agb stars are more likely to evolve into carbon stars .",
    "thus , even if there is still non - axisymmetric structure outside @xmath285 , it is not likely to change the derived value of @xmath265 for the  population very significantly .",
    "the error introduced by the missing vla pointings is systematic in @xmath90 and @xmath89 , in that it always reduces the vla (  positive ) contribution to these terms ; however , the sign of the resulting change in @xmath265 is not obvious . of 88 missing pointings ,",
    "18 are in the overlap region . in general , therefore , we chose to use the atca pointings in the overlap region , to minimize the effect of missing pointings . to estimate the effect of the remaining missing pointings ( 70 of 88 ) , we tried to reconstruct the missing pointings by reflection about the mid - plane where possible ( 49 pointings ) .",
    "where this was not possible ( 21 pointings ) , we have simply averaged the value in the 4 nearest pointings , or the subset of them which were not themselves missing pointings . with these changes but all else as before , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath102 and @xmath103",
    "increase somewhat , but @xmath265 changes to @xmath286 , which is not significantly different from our previous values .",
    "the reason for this robustness to missing pointings can be understood by comparing the number of pointings and of  stars .",
    "our sample contains 73   stars detected in 840 good vla pointings . with these probabilities",
    ", we estimate that @xmath287  stars have been missed because of missing vla pointings not in the atca overlap region .",
    "due to observational constraints , we considered only  stars with @xmath288 .",
    "we experimented with reducing the maximum @xmath289 further to test how our limit might have affected our value of @xmath265 .",
    "radial velocities this large are expected to occur only in the bulge region , and indeed , the biggest relative changes in @xmath90 were at small @xmath77 , but these propagated to small changes in @xmath90 at large @xmath77 .",
    "it is only at @xmath290  that stars begin to leave the sample , and @xmath265 decreases slowly for smaller maximum @xmath289 , reaching @xmath291  at @xmath292 , which is still smaller than @xmath293 .",
    "we therefore conclude that it is unlikely that our modest cuts in @xmath289 has resulted in a large systematic error in @xmath265 .",
    "a non - zero radial velocity of the lsr , @xmath1 , can not be excluded . for our  star sample ,",
    "thus even a quite small @xmath1 will drastically alter the value of @xmath156 : if @xmath295 , then @xmath156 changes by @xmath296 . an accurate measurement of @xmath1",
    "is therefore needed .",
    "averaging the 197  stars at @xmath297 (   the atca - bulge survey ) , we estimated @xmath298  ( the plus sign indicating that the motion is away from the galactic centre ) .",
    "similarly , kuijken & tremaine ( 1994 ) used a variety of tracers (  stars , globular clusters , high velocity stars , planetary nebulae , ) to obtain @xmath299 .",
    "perhaps the best constraint on @xmath1 is that of radhakrishnan & sarma ( 1980 ) , who showed that the main component in the hi absorption spectrum of sgr a has a mean line - of - sight velocity @xmath300 .",
    "since this absorbing material is presumably outside the inner region of the mwg and within 6 - 7 kpc from the sun , this means that a wide band of material is moving at a common radial velocity . while it is possible to construct models in which @xmath301 is zero but with non - zero @xmath1 (  blitz & spergel 1991 ) , the most natural explanation is that @xmath1 is zero to this level ; if @xmath302 , this changes @xmath156 by @xmath303 .",
    "we now estimate the errors arising from sampling , which should be the largest source of errors for our small sample .",
    "we do this by re - sampling the data ; however , since arbitrary resamplings will increase the noise , we first sorted the  stars by @xmath203 , then took sub - samples of 220 , 230 and 240 consecutive stars . at each sub - sample size , we generated 1000 different reshufflings of the @xmath203 s ( since we always used @xmath304 , the number of combinations of  stars , and therefore the number of different values of @xmath90 versus @xmath89 is smaller than 1000 ) .",
    "the results are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig14 ] , which shows clearly that there is quite a fair amount of scatter in the values of @xmath90 and @xmath89 .",
    "the median value of @xmath6 ; this corresponds to @xmath305 .",
    "therefore , as an estimate of the sampling noise , we adopt 5 .",
    "the error estimate on @xmath156 from sampling is consistent with the results we found in  [ tests ] , and with the estimate based on variations in @xmath77 .",
    "we further test this error estimate by taking a sub - sample of pbr = 0.6 , which gives about 180 stars .",
    "then the average @xmath306 , which is within @xmath307 of the result for the full sample .",
    "since this is an even smaller sample than our main sample , it should be even noisier than our full sample .",
    "we conclude that our sampling error error estimate is reasonable .",
    "( higher pbr levels give even smaller samples and require larger areal corrections ( see table [ tbcpa ] ) , which make them too susceptible to noise .",
    "we have therefore not attempted to use pbr levels above 0.6 . )",
    "we have experimented with other sub - samples ; in all cases we found that the results were not statistically different from the results we presented above .",
    "however , we found that the average @xmath3 tends to systematically increase as the upper cutoff on @xmath203 is decreased .",
    "thus , for example , we find that for @xmath308  ( 212 stars ) , the average @xmath309  while for @xmath310  ( 181 stars ) , the average @xmath311 . the same trend was seen when we increased the upper @xmath203 to 16 , although in that case we are less certain that the population is relaxed .",
    "while all these results are consistent with 59   within @xmath307 , the systematic behavior suggests that there is a systematic error , perhaps due to the population not being fully relaxed .",
    "we take as an estimate of this error 10 .",
    "the results of our study of the  stars in the atca / vla oh 1612 mhz survey give us a pattern speed of @xmath312  ( internal and estimated systematic errors respectively ) for @xmath313 , @xmath8 kpc and @xmath9 .",
    "if the rotation curve stays flat between the region of the non - axisymmetry and the sun , then the corotation radius is @xmath314 kpc , while the main non - axisymmetric feature in question appears to be centered at @xmath315 ,  @xmath316 4.0 kpc if it is seen tangentially .",
    "if this is the full extent of this non - axisymmetric feature , then @xmath317 , which is fast in the usual definition . however it is possible that the feature is not being viewed tangentially and extends somewhat further out , in which case @xmath318 would be smaller .",
    "which feature in the mwg disc can be responsible for the signal we have measured ? while the tw method has the great advantage of being model independent , the result is that , in the absence of distance information , it is hard to identify the feature responsible for the pattern speed measured .",
    "for such a fast feature , the mwg bar would seem to be the natural explanation .",
    "however , the longitude at which the non - axisymmetric signal peaks is somewhat larger than what present models of the mwg would have (  gerhard 2001 , but see hammersley  2000 , who have recently claimed evidence of a second , larger bar in the mwg ) .",
    "the small latitude of the main part of the signal implies a disc source , while the large longitude suggests the signal arises mostly from spirals , particularly at the tangent point of the scutum spiral arm . the high value of @xmath3 and the relatively small @xmath318 may hint at a coupling to the bar ; perhaps it is even an inner ring , rather than a spiral arm .",
    "such rings are often found in external barred galaxies ( buta 1995 ) , and are elongated along the bar , so that they co - rotate with the bars which they contain .",
    "such a ring has been postulated in the mwg (  sevenster & kalnajs 2001 ) .",
    "the pattern speed measured must , in fact , be a density and asymmetry weighted average of all the non - axisymmetric structure in the survey region , which is known to include a bar , various spirals and perhaps a ring .",
    "note that there is no evidence of substantial cancellation of @xmath89 in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] . for various sub - samples , we find some marginal evidence for multiple pattern speeds : when we divided our full sample into bright ( flux density @xmath319 jy ) and faint ( flux density @xmath320 jy ) sub - samples , we found @xmath321  and @xmath322  respectively , together with some evidence of signals peaking at different @xmath77 .",
    "since the bright ( faint ) sub - sample is , on average , expected to be closer to ( further from ) the sun and further from ( closer to ) the galactic centre , the lower ( higher ) pattern speed is not unexpected",
    ". however , these sub - samples are even smaller than our already small full sample , and the differences are not statistically significant .",
    "multiple pattern speeds can be better studied with larger samples of tracers .      in the future",
    ", it will be possible to improve on our measurement in a variety of ways .",
    "our main limitation was the small sample of objects ; larger samples will provide one means of improving on our measurement . at present , the atca / vla oh 1612 mhz survey is the only large scale complete survey of a population satisfying the continuity equation .",
    "kuijken & tremaine ( 1991 ) applied the tw method to the galactic hi , which covers the entire disc , but this is unlikely to satisfy continuity , particularly in the presence of a bar . however , systematic surveys of other populations are now in progress (  planetary nebulae beaulieu  2000 ; sio masers deguchi  2001 ) or planned ( honma  2000 ) ; these may be used for similar measurements .",
    "accurate distance information will lead to an important refinement in the method .",
    "future astrometric satellites , such as esa s _ gaia _ , will measure radial velocities together with distance .",
    "not only will _ gaia _",
    "provide samples many orders larger than the atca / vla oh 1612 mhz survey , but it will also be possible to drop the assumption of one pattern speed . then",
    ", if the pattern speed is some function of galacto - centric radius only , we can write @xmath323 where @xmath52 are galacto - centric polar coordinates , @xmath61 is the usual distance from the sun , and for simplicity we have ignored both the third dimension and lsr motion .",
    "this is a fredholm integral equation of the first kind for the unknown function @xmath324 ; techniques for the solution of such equations , including numerical methods , are well established .",
    "the main difficulty with a solution of this equation probably arises in regularising the solution at helio - centric radii @xmath61 at which the integrals are small or vanish , as must happen for a spiral , but a detailed discussion of these issues is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "such data will make it possible to test theories of spiral structure in greater detail than has been possible to now .",
    "we derived a 3d version of the tremaine - weinberg method for the milky way galaxy .",
    "the method , as developed here , is based on the assumption that the density distribution can be expressed as in eqn .",
    "thus we have assumed one pattern speed only ; if multiple pattern speeds are present , then an average pattern speed is measured , as discussed in  [ complications ] .",
    "moreover , we have assumed that any rapidly growing structure present has low amplitude .",
    "we argued that this is likely to be the case since large amplitude features can not sustain large growth for long .",
    "we tested the method on simple models of bars and spirals , selecting samples of 500 discrete tracers , to show that it is possible to measure pattern speeds with average error of @xmath325 , and always better than @xmath186 , provided that asymmetry signals are sufficiently large , as described in ",
    "[ tests ] .",
    "we then extracted a sample of some 250  stars from the atca / vla oh 1612 mhz survey and applied the method to these stars .",
    "this gave @xmath326 , from which we obtain @xmath305 , with a possible systematic error of perhaps 10 , if @xmath9 , @xmath8 kpc and @xmath7 ( for other values of @xmath5 , @xmath4 or @xmath1 , @xmath3 can be obtained from @xmath327 ) .",
    "the sample is quite small and the detection is only significant at about the @xmath328 level . future larger samples will improve this situation ; we sketch how distance data combined with the projected position and line - of - sight velocity data used in our study will lead to a substantial improvement in our knowledge of the pattern speed(s ) in the milky way galaxy ."
