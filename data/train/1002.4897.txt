    "spin excitations in solids are of fundamental interest for a wide variety of phenomena . for example , in magnetic materials at low temperatures collective spin excitations , so - called spin waves or magnons,@xcite leave a mark on the transport , dynamical , and thermodynamical properties .",
    "the spin waves contribute to the specific heat with a @xmath3 term in addition to the @xmath4 term from phonon excitations .",
    "the low - temperature behavior of the magnetization in three - dimensional magnetic solids is also dominated by spin - wave excitations : in ferromagnets the magnetization drops as @xmath3 , while the sublattice magnetization in antiferromagnets obeys a @xmath5 law.@xcite in low - dimensional systems spin - wave excitations even destroy the long - range magnetic order completely at any finite temperature @xmath6 in the absence of a magnetic anisotropy.@xcite as the temperature increases , additional single - particle spin - flip processes , the so - called stoner excitations , take place , which further contribute to the temperature variation of the magnetization and cause a damping of the spin - wave modes .",
    "spin waves can also couple to charge excitations around the fermi level .",
    "such interactions lead to a pronounced energy renormalization in the quasiparticle band dispersion,@xcite or control the spin - dependent inelastic mean free path of hot electrons in ferromagnets.@xcite another interesting phenomenon is high - temperature superconductivity , in which spin waves have been proposed as a possible mediator for the attractive electron - electron interaction.@xcite this scenario was recently confirmed by infrared spectroscopy and neutron scattering measurements for the high - temperature superconductor yba@xmath7cu@xmath8o@xmath9.@xcite    spin excitations in solids are also of central interest in the field of spintronics .",
    "the writing process of magnetic information in a giant magneto resistance or tunnel magneto resistance device is closely related to the rotation of the magnetization , a process generating and radiating spin waves at all wave lengths , whose damping rate is an important parameter determining the writing time.@xcite spin waves are also generated during the reading process , as hot electrons impinge at the interfaces between the insulating barrier and the magnetic electrodes of magnetic tunnel junctions , which causes a reduction of the magneto resistance.@xcite    the properties and physics of spin waves evidently comprise an unusually rich area of research .",
    "a lot of information about the spin dynamics in solids can be obtained from the magnetic response function ( or dynamical spin susceptibility ) .",
    "the spectrum of magnetic excitations corresponds to the poles of the response function and can be directly compared with experiments like inelastic neutron scattering . in this way it provides insight into the nature of the exchange coupling and the complex magnetic order .",
    "the magnetic response function is thus a central quantity for the theoretical description of magnetic materials .",
    "so far most theoretical studies of magnetic excitations in solids were based on an adiabatic treatment of the spin degrees of freedom in which the slow motion of the magnetic moments and the fast motion of the electrons are separated by mapping the complex itinerant electron problem onto the classical heisenberg hamiltonian with exchange parameters obtained from constrained density - functional theory ( dft ) calculations.@xcite within this approach the spin - wave excitations can be calculated efficiently , whereas the single - particle stoner excitations are neglected . furthermore , the spin - wave life times are not accessible . from a fundamental point of view",
    ", the heisenberg model is justified only for local - moment systems like insulators and rare earths , which possess well - defined spin - wave modes over the entire brillouin zone , so that the adiabatic approximation is reliable . for itinerant - electron magnets the adiabatic approximation yields reasonable results only in the long - wave - length region ,",
    "i.e. , for small wave vectors . for short wave lengths",
    "the discrepancy with experiments can be large , however .",
    "for example , the multiple branches in the spin - wave dispersion of 3__d _ _ ferromagnets can not be captured.@xcite    first - principles calculations of the magnetic response function using realistic energy bands and wave functions are very rare",
    ". initial attempts by cooke _ _ et al.__@xcite within the framework of many - body perturbation theory ( mbpt ) were based on a tight - binding description of the electronic energy bands .",
    "these authors studied the spin - wave dispersion of 3__d _ _ ferromagnets and obtained reasonable agreement with experiments ; in particular , the optical branch in the spin - wave dispersion of fcc ni was correctly described.@xcite using a similar approach , mills and co - workers@xcite carried out extensive calculations to explore the spin dynamics in ultrathin ferromagnetic films on nonmagnetic substrates .",
    "recently more realistic treatments of the spin - wave spectra in 3__d _ _ ferromagnets were reported by savrasov@xcite and buczek _ _ et al.__@xcite within time - dependent density - functional theory ( tddft ) and by karlsson and aryasetiawan within mbpt.@xcite however , in the latter work the authors used a simplified model potential with an adjustable parameter to estimate the matrix elements of the screened coulomb interaction . under these circumstances",
    "both tddft and mbpt appear to give similar results for the spin - wave dispersions of fe and ni .",
    "the results for fe are in good agreement with available experimental data , while for ni the optical branch is too high in energy , which was attributed to the overestimation of the exchange splitting of ni within the underlying lsda.@xcite    the aim of the present work is to develop a practical computational scheme to study excitation spectra of magnetic materials from first principles .",
    "the magnetic response function is calculated within a many - body context following the formalism given in ref .. to study collective spin - wave excitations we include vertex corrections in the form of ladder diagrams , which describe the coupling of electrons and holes with opposite spins via the screened coulomb interaction .",
    "in analogy to the @xmath6-matrix that describes the particle - particle scattering channel , here we use the same term for the electron - hole channel in agreement with the definition of strinati.@xcite in contrast to earlier treatments , the matrix elements of the screened coulomb potential are calculated entirely from first principles . in order to reduce the numerical cost for the calculation of the four - point @xmath6-matrix we exploit a transformation to maximally localized wannier functions ( mlwfs ) , which provide a more efficient basis to study local correlations than extended bloch states.@xcite",
    "this use of localized orbitals makes our scheme very efficient for complex magnetic materials with many atoms per unit cell .",
    "our implementation is based on the flapw method . in the following",
    "we first calculate the matrix elements of the coulomb potential for the 3__d _ _ transition - metal series in the wannier basis and perform extensive convergence tests .",
    "the magnetic excitations in fcc ni are then studied in detail based on the lsda and lsda+@xmath2 methods .",
    "we find that both approaches yield qualitatively similar results for the spin - wave spectra and overall dispersion .",
    "however , the static correlation effects seem to be important for the spin - wave stiffness constant , which is overestimated within lsda .",
    "in contrast to some previous theoretical studies,@xcite our calculations clearly indicate the existence of an optical branch in the spin - wave dispersion curve of ni along the @xmath1 $ ] in addition to that along the @xmath0 $ ] direction in the brillouin zone . in general ,",
    "the obtained results are in good agreement with available experimental data .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec.[sectionii ] we describe the computational method .",
    "section[sectioniii ] contains the results for the matrix elements of the screened coulomb potential for the 3__d _ _ transition metals . in sec.[sectioniv ] we present results for the magnetic excitations in fcc ni together with a detailed discussion . in sec.[sectionv ] we summarize our conclusions and give an outlook .",

    "for simplicity we use the short - hand notation @xmath18 .",
    "the expectation value of @xmath12 with respect to the many - body ground state is given by @xmath19 with the pauli spin matrices @xmath20 , the single - particle green function @xmath21 , and the spin indices @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the notation @xmath24 indicates that the time variable is increased by an infinitesimal to ensure the proper time ordering @xmath25 .",
    "the magnetic response function can be obtained from the spin density by the functional derivative @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 correspond to the components of the magnetization and the magnetic - field vector , respectively .",
    "the latter incorporates a factor @xmath29 , where the @xmath30 denotes the bohr magneton and @xmath31 the electron @xmath31-factor , so that the zeeman term in the hamiltonian operator takes the form @xmath32 .      the single - particle green function in eq.([spin_density ] )",

    "the dynamically screened coulomb potential @xmath42 is given by @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the bare coulomb potential and @xmath45 the polarizability in the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) .",

    "the second term contains the @xmath6-matrix , which describes dynamic correlation in the form of repeated scattering events of particle - hole pairs with opposite spins and is responsible for the occurrence of collective spin - wave excitations .",
    "the feynman diagrams for the magnetic response function @xmath52 and the @xmath6-matrix are displayed in fig.[response ] .",
    "-matrix . ]    for a practical evaluation of the magnetic response function we replace the full renormalized green function @xmath53 by an appropriate mean - field approximation ( lsda , lsda+@xmath2 , etc . ) .",
    "moreover , we employ an instantaneous interaction of the form @xmath54 with @xmath55 in eq.([bethe - salpeter ] ) .",
    "this is justified by the observation that the matrix elements of @xmath56 do not vary strongly in the low - frequency region ( @xmath57 ev ) , in which the spin - wave excitations occur.@xcite under these circumstances it is sufficient to calculate the kernel ( [ kernel_k ] ) for @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "in fact , due to time translation symmetry the resulting expression depends only on the difference @xmath60 and is given by the fourier transform of @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath63 are the lsda ( lsda+@xmath2 ) eigenstates and eigenvalues , respectively .      in order to reduce the numerical cost for the calculation of the four - point kernel @xmath47 we exploit a transformation to maximally localized wannier functions , which allows us to efficiently truncate the matrix in real space .",
    "the generalized wannier functions @xmath64 with orbital index @xmath65 and spin @xmath22 at the site @xmath66 are defined as fourier transforms of the bloch states @xmath62 according to @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the number of discrete @xmath69 points in the full brillouin zone and @xmath70 denote the transformation matrices .",
    "the latter are determined by minimizing the spread @xmath71 where the sum runs over all wannier functions .",
    "we employ the algorithm for minimizing the spread initially proposed by marzari and vanderbilt@xcite for isolated groups of bands and later extended to entangled energy bands.@xcite    the matrix elements of the screened coulomb potential in the mlwf basis are given by @xmath72 the screened potential @xmath73 itself is calculated within the rpa using the mixed product basis.@xcite as we use only the on - site matrix elements of @xmath74 , we set @xmath75 and eventually obtain @xmath76 where @xmath77 ( @xmath78 ) are the biorthogonal basis functions of the mixed product basis , which satisfy the relation @xmath79 in the hilbert space of the wave - function products .",
    "the next step is the calculation of the kernel @xmath47 .",
    "the projection of the bloch states onto the wannier orbitals yields @xmath80 if we perform a lattice fourier transformation , then eq.([kernel1 ] ) takes the form @xmath81 in the wannier basis . instead of a direct evaluation of this expression , we first calculate the corresponding spectral function @xmath82 which equals the probability distribution for spin - flip transitions between occupied and unoccupied states with the energy and momentum difference @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "once the spectral function is known , we use a hilbert transformation to calculate the kernel @xmath85 where @xmath86 indicates the cauchy principal value .    with the kernel @xmath47 and the screened coulomb potential @xmath74 we can construct the @xmath6-matrix according to eq.([bethe - salpeter ] ) , which in the mlwf basis takes the form @xmath87 and can be solved by a matrix inversion for a set of @xmath84 and @xmath83 values .",
    "finally , the magnetic response function is given by @xmath88 \\langle \\tilde{w}^{\\alpha}_{n_3\\mathbf{k}+ \\mathbf{q}}\\tilde{w}^{\\beta*}_{n_4\\mathbf{k}}| \\mathbf{q } \\rangle \\:\\:\\:\\:\\:\\:\\:\\:\\:\\ : \\label{response_function4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath89 the tilde denotes the orthonormalized products of wannier functions .",
    "although the wannier functions themselves form an orthonormal basis set with @xmath90 , their products do not satisfy this orthonormality condition .",
    "therefore , we explicitly orthonormalize the products according to @xmath91_{n_1n_2,n_3n_4}^{\\alpha\\beta }    where the overlap matrix is defined as @xmath92 in practice , this orthonormalization can be performed in the final step of the calculation , i.e. , in the projection of the magnetic response function @xmath52 onto plane waves .",
    "the spin - wave spectra are obtained from the imaginary part of the transverse magnetic response function @xmath93 , which exhibits peaks at the spin - wave energies corresponding to the wave vector @xmath84 . the half - width of a peak is inversely proportional to the life time of the excitation .",
    "all ground - state calculations are carried out using the flapw method as implemented in the ` fleur ` code,@xcite initially within the lsda for the exchange - correlation potential.@xcite we use 4.5 @xmath94 as a cutoff for the plane waves and @xmath95 for the angular momentum for all 3__d _ _ transition metals under consideration .",
    "in addition , the lsda+@xmath2 method with @xmath96 ev and @xmath97 ev is employed to reveal the correlation effects on the magnetic excitation spectra of ni . in practice ,",
    "the @xmath2 and @xmath98 values can either be chosen as empirical parameters or obtained from from first - principles calculations by employing methods like constrained lsda@xcite or constrained rpa,@xcite in which the screening due to the 3__d _ _ electrons is excluded . however , due to _ s - d _ hybridization in the 3__d _ _ transition metals the constrained rpa yields different values for @xmath2 and @xmath98 depending on the procedure used for excluding 3__d__-3__d _ _ transitions in the polarization function .",
    "for example , miyake _ _ et al.__@xcite found 3.7 ev for @xmath2 in fcc ni if the _ s - d _ hybridization is switched off , whereas @xmath2 reduces to 2.8 ev if the _ s - d _ hybridization is retained . on the other hand , our calculations showed that using @xmath2 and @xmath98 values from the constrained lsda or from constrained rpa within the lsda+@xmath2 scheme yields unsatisfactory results for the magnetic moment , exchange splitting and spin - wave dispersion of fcc ni compared to experiments .",
    "for this reason we use the empirical values for @xmath2 and @xmath98 given above , which improve the fermi surface and do not change the magnetic moment substantially.@xcite furthermore , these values yield the correct magnetic anisotropy energy and direction of the magnetization .    the mlwfs are constructed with the ` wannier90 ` code,@xcite which was recently interfaced to the flapw method.@xcite the screened coulomb potential in the rpa is calculated with the ` spex ` code@xcite using the mixed product basis and then projected onto the mlwf basis .",
    "the total number of functions in the mixed product basis is 180 - 200 , and 95 - 100 unoccupied states are included in the calculation of the polarizability .",
    "finally , we note that although the mlwfs provide a minimal basis set for the construction of the @xmath6-matrix , the computational time scales as the fourth power of the number of wannier functions .",
    "the most expensive part in our scheme is the calculation of the kernel @xmath47 , because it requires a large number of @xmath69 points for proper convergence ( see sect.[sectioniv ] ) .",
    "in contrast , the screened coulomb potential @xmath74 is less sensitive to the @xmath69-point sampling , i.e. , it is already converged for a substantially smaller number of @xmath69 points .",
    "as a first step we calculate the matrix elements of the screened coulomb potential @xmath74 for the series of 3__d _ _ transition metals , because these matrix elements are a crucial ingredient for the construction of the magnetic response function . in previous treatments of spin waves in a many - body context the coulomb interaction was chosen either as a simple hubbard - type @xmath2 parameter or as a model potential with an adjustable range parameter.@xcite recent _ ab initio _ studies of the bare and the screened coulomb interaction in 3__d _ _ transition metals focused only on the nonmagnetic ( nm ) state.@xcite here we present a detailed study of the matrix elements in the mlwf basis for the proper ferromagnetic ( fm ) state of the 3__d _ _ transition metals fe , co , and ni . for comparison with previous works the nm states of these three elements and the rest of the 3__d _ _ series are considered , too .",
    "we focus especially on bcc fe to investigate the effect of the exchange splitting on the coulomb matrix elements , because bcc fe has the largest exchange splitting among the 3__d _ _ ferromagnets .",
    "previous studies showed that , similar to insulators , in 3__d _ _ transition metals the wannier functions with _ d _",
    "character are exponentially localized.@xcite the correlation effects hence take place predominantly within the same atomic site.@xcite our calculations confirm these findings . as the off - site matrix elements of the screened coulomb potential are at least two orders of magnitude smaller than the on - site ones ,",
    "we only consider the latter .",
    "the strong localization of the 3__d _ _ orbitals can be seen in fig .",
    "[ mlwf_fe ] , where we present @xmath99-like ( @xmath100 and @xmath101 ) mlwfs for bcc fe .",
    "the isosurface corresponds to 10% of the maximum amplitude of the mlwfs .    to begin with ,",
    "we define the average on - site diagonal and off - diagonal matrix elements of the direct and exchange coulomb potential as @xmath102 @xmath103 @xmath104 although the matrix elements of the coulomb potential are formally spin - dependent due to the spin - dependence of the mlwfs , we find that this dependence is negligible in practice , i.e. , @xmath105 .    -like ( @xmath100 and @xmath101 ) maximally localized wannier functions for bcc fe .",

    "points and ( b ) the number of bands used in the construction of the mlwf basis for the nm and fm states of bcc fe .",
    "( c ) the same as ( b ) for the average spread of the 3__d _ _ orbitals . ]    in fig.[convergence](a ) we present a convergence study for the average on - site diagonal matrix elements of the bare and the screened coulomb interaction ( @xmath106 ) between the 3__d _ _ orbitals as a function of the number of @xmath69 points for the nm and the fm states of bcc fe .",
    "fig.[convergence](b ) shows the same matrix elements as a function of the number of bands used in the construction of the mlwfs .",
    "we observe a fast @xmath69-point convergence but a relatively slow convergence with respect to the number of bands .",
    "in fact , the screened @xmath106 is not completely converged even with 60 bands .",
    "the large difference between the nm and fm states will be discussed below .",
    "the increase of the matrix elements of the coulomb potential with the number of bands can be explained by the localization of the wannier functions . in fig.[convergence](c ) we show the spread @xmath107 for the 3__d _ _ orbitals as a function of the number of bands .",
    "it can clearly be seen that @xmath107 decreases if the number of bands increases , indicating that the 3__d _ _",
    "orbitals become more localized , which in turn gives rise to a larger @xmath106 . for the rest of the 3__d _ _ transition - metal series the behavior of the coulomb matrix elements with respect to the number of bands is very similar to bcc fe . in the rest of this section we use 6 bands and an @xmath108 @xmath69-point mesh in order to compare our results with previously published data that adopted the same parameter settings .    in table[table_screen ]",
    "we present the on - site matrix elements of the screened coulomb potential for the nm and fm states of bcc fe .",
    "tables[table_co ] and [ table_ni_u ] contain the values for the fm state of fcc co and ni .",
    "for all three systems the average values for the diagonal ( @xmath106 ) and off - diagonal ( @xmath109 , @xmath110 ) matrix elements are given in table[table_onsite ] .",
    "we note that the splitting of the diagonal matrix elements by the crystal - field effect is quite pronounced .",
    "for bcc fe the @xmath99-like diagonal elements are larger than the @xmath111-like ones in the fm state , while in the nm state it is just the opposite .",
    "this means that the strongest interaction takes place between the electrons in the @xmath99-like ( @xmath111-like ) orbitals for the fm ( nm ) state , because these are more localized . in the case of fcc ni",
    "the situation is very similar .",
    "however , in fcc co the splitting of the diagonal coulomb matrix elements by the crystal - field effect is different : in the nm state ( results not shown ) all diagonal elements assume similar values , while in the fm state ( see table[table_co ] ) the @xmath111-like diagonal elements are larger than the @xmath99-like ones .",

    "the single - particle stoner excitations are presented .",
    "the second part deals with the collective spin - wave excitations .",
    "stoner excitations are electron transitions between bands of opposite spin .",
    "when an electron is excited from an occupied majority - spin state at @xmath69 to an unoccupied minority - spin state at @xmath69+@xmath84 , it produces an electron - hole pair with triplet spin configuration that reduces the magnetization by unity .",
    "therefore , these excitations are associated with longitudinal fluctuations of the magnetization and play an important role in determining the high - temperature properties of magnetic materials.@xcite to simplify the discussion , let us consider a free electron gas with parabolic dispersion and a rigid exchange splitting @xmath121 .",
    "the corresponding single - particle excitation energies are given by @xmath122 .",
    "for @xmath123 the necessary energy for such excitations equals the exchange splitting @xmath121 , but for finite @xmath84 these excitations form a continuous spectrum , which is called the _ stoner continuum _ and is determined by all possible values of @xmath69 .",
    "the upper and lower bounds of the stoner continuum depend on the electronic band structure of the material .",
    "for example , in strong ferromagnets the smallest possible excitation energy is given by the stoner gap @xmath124 .",
    "on the other hand , weak ferromagnets exhibit a vanishing gap @xmath125 , and thus single - particle excitations do not require a finite energy for particular @xmath84 values .",
    "the lower bound is of special interest , because when the collective spin - wave excitations enter the stoner continuum , they start to decay into single - particle excitations , which reduces their lifetime drastically .",
    "we note that the picture of stoner excitations in real materials is different from the free electron gas with a single band.@xcite     direction in the brillouin zone .",
    "since the kohn - sham system is noninteracting , the spectrum exhibits only single - particle stoner excitations but no collective magnon modes at lower energies . in each panel",
    "the peak amplitudes are scaled to the same height . ]",
    "since the stoner excitations are single - particle spin - flip processes , they can be studied qualitatively at the kohn - sham level .",
    "they result from the term @xmath126 , as discussed before . in fig.[stoner_excitations ] we present the imaginary part of the kohn - sham magnetic response function for fcc ni for selected wave vectors along the @xmath127 direction .",
    "note that all peak amplitudes are scaled to the same height .",
    "the energetic position and shape of the stoner spectrum for @xmath128 provide a measure for the mean exchange splitting and its variation across the brillouin zone .",
    "the triple - peak structure reflects the intraband and interband transitions .",
    "the position of the first peak gives the mean exchange splitting : 0.61 ev within lsda and 0.69 ev within lsda+@xmath2 .",
    "the broadening of the peaks reflects the @xmath69-dependence of the exchange splitting . for rigidly split bands one would get @xmath129 peaks . as the wave vector increases",
    ", individual peaks become broader and are no longer distinguishable .",
    "since the kohn - sham system is noninteracting , the spectrum does not exhibit collective magnon modes at low energies .",
    "experimentally , stoner excitations in 3__d _ _ ferromagnets are studied with spin - polarized electron - energy - loss spectroscopy ( speels ) , a technique that not only measures the high - energy stoner excitations but also low - energy collective spin - wave modes up to the brillouin - zone boundary . using speels kirschner _ _",
    "et al.__@xcite studied the stoner excitation spectrum of ni at @xmath130 .",
    "the authors found that the spectrum had a broad energy distribution of 0.3 ev ( full width at half maximum ) and was centered around 0.3 ev , which is consistent with the average exchange splitting determined by photoemission experiments .",
    "additionally , the width of the distribution provided evidence for the pronounced @xmath69-dependence of the exchange splitting .",
    "the comparison of our calculated spectra with the experimental data shows large discrepancies , however .",
    "these can be attributed to the overestimated exchange splitting and its incorrect nearly isotropic behavior over the brillouin zone in the lsda .",
    "as pointed out by oles and stollhoff@xcite and by liebsch,@xcite the large exchange splitting in the lsda is due to the neglect of strong correlation effects within the 3__d _ _ states and anisotropic exchange .",
    "consequently , recent studies by katsnelson and lichtenstein@xcite and by grechnev _",
    "_ et al.__@xcite based on dynamical mean - field theory , in which the exchange and correlation effects are taken into account properly , gave much improved results for the exchange splitting and quasiparticle band structure of ni .      in the preceding section we discussed the non - interacting magnetic response function @xmath47 , which has singularities that correspond to single - particle stoner excitations , usually with a broad energy distribution .",
    "in addition , there may be other singularities of @xmath52 for a fixed @xmath84 .",
    "for some @xmath131 outside the stoner continuum the denominator ( @xmath132 ) of the magnetic response function might vanish , indicating collective spin - wave excitations .",
    "these correspond to transverse fluctuations of the direction of the magnetization and can be interpreted as a coherent superposition of an electron and a hole with opposite spins coupled via an attractive screened coulomb interaction @xmath74 , thereby forming a bound state with energy @xmath131 , spin @xmath133 , and momentum @xmath84.@xcite as more than one particle is involved in the excitation process , the formation of spin waves can not be described within a single - particle picture .    before discussing our numerical results we briefly review the status of experimental and theoretical studies of magnetic excitations in fcc ni .",
    "starting from the mid 1960s the spin dynamics of ferromagnetic 3__d _ _ transition metals and their alloys were intensively investigated by inelastic neutron scattering .",
    "the first experiments for ni were performed at high temperatures and in the low - energy region .",
    "later the measurements were extended to higher energies .",
    "the results of these early neutron - scattering experiments and a comparison with realistic band structure calculations can be found in the review article by lowde and windsor.@xcite however , the signal intensity and energy resolution in these early experiments were not favorable for a quantitative determination of the spin - wave excitations in ni .",
    "more precise measurements were reported by mook and collaborators in the 1980s with emphasis on high energies up to 240 mev.@xcite the authors measured the spin - wave dispersion of ni at several temperatures starting from @xmath134 up to @xmath135 , where @xmath136 is the curie temperature , and found that the spin - wave dispersion was isotropic in @xmath84 over the entire temperature range studied .",
    "the obtained spin - wave stiffness constant was @xmath137 mev @xmath138 at @xmath139 and @xmath140 mev @xmath138 at @xmath141 .",
    "the spin - wave intensity was found to decrease faster with increasing energy in the @xmath1 $ ] direction than along other symmetry directions . in all directions",
    "the spin waves eventually disappeared at some wave vector close to the zone boundary inside the first brillouin zone , which was attributed to a decay into stoner excitations . additionally , the authors found evidence for a second branch in the spin - wave dispersion , i.e. , an optical mode that crosses the main @xmath0 $ ] acoustic branch around 125 mev .",
    "however , inelastic neutron scattering does not allow to explore the entire brillouin zone in 3__d _ _ ferromagnets , in contrast to speels .",
    "using speels abraham and hopster@xcite attempted to study short - wave - length ( or large - wave - vector ) spin excitations in ni .",
    "however , they only detected stoner excitations , although the data reported reaches down to 100 mev and the resolution of the instrument ( 17 mev ) should have been sufficient to observe collective excitations .",
    "a qualitative explanation for the absence of spin - wave peaks in the speels spectrum was given by hong and mills,@xcite who showed that the spin waves can only be observed in speels if the exchange splitting of the 3__d _ _ bands is large compared to the spin - wave excitation energies .",
    "indeed , spin waves up to the brillouin - zone boundary are observed in fe and co , which have substantially larger exchange splittings than ni.@xcite    on the theoretical side , the first attempt to use realistic energy bands for ni in the calculations of a generalized susceptibility was undertaken by lowde and windsor.@xcite the authors calculated the magnetic susceptibility within the rpa for rigidly spin - split bands , but the agreement with the available experimental data was not good .",
    "et al.__@xcite showed that it is necessary to take the @xmath69-dependence of the exchange splitting into account for a quantitative comparison between theory and experiment .",
    "they used a tight - binding description of the electronic energy bands , and the ferromagnetism was driven by an empirical on - site coulomb interaction between the 3__d _ _ electrons with two adjustable parameters .",
    "these parameters were chosen in such a way that the calculations reproduce the experimentally observed magnetic moment as well as the correct @xmath111 and @xmath99 character of the moment as measured in neutron magnetic - form - factor experiments .",
    "the calculations of cooke _",
    "_ not only yielded the correct spin - wave dispersion relation , including the appearance of the optical branch in the @xmath0 $ ] direction , but the damping of the spin waves in the presence of the stoner modes was also correctly described .",
    "a similar approach was used by hong and mills@xcite with an empirical coulomb interaction that was form - invariant under spin rotations .",
    "however , they failed to find the optical mode in the spin - wave dispersion of ni .    a much more accurate description of spin waves in ferromagnetic 3__d _ _ transition metals was reported by savrasov@xcite and by karlsson and aryasetiawan.@xcite in both works spin - polarized dft was used for the ground - state calculations .",
    "for the transverse spin susceptibility savrasov employed tddft , while karlsson and aryasetiawan adopted mbpt .",
    "similar to the findings of cooke _",
    "_ , savrasov obtained two branches in the spin - wave dispersion of ni along the @xmath0 $ ] direction with an optical mode at high energies .",
    "karlsson and aryasetiawan confirmed these results and investigated the role of the one - particle band structure on the spin - wave dispersion .",
    "they found a very good agreement between theory and experiment if the lsda exchange splitting was manually reduced by one - half . additionally , the calculations gave evidence for an optical branch along the @xmath1 $ ] direction .",
    "the optical branch in the spin - wave dispersion of ni is evidently a very subtle issue .",
    "so far , there has been no general consensus in theoretical treatments concerning the sensitivity of the results to the details of the electronic structure and to the method used . in the following we hence focus on the energy region where the double - peak structure is observed in the spin - wave spectrum . to illuminate the effect of the electronic structure on the magnetic excitation spectrum of ni",
    "we employ three different methods : lsda , lsda+@xmath2 , and lsda with a reduced exchange splitting by one - half .",
    "the calculated spin - wave dispersion along the high - symmetry lines @xmath142 is displayed in fig.[spin_wave_dispersion ] .",
    "for comparison the experimental dispersion is also shown .",
    "the lsda and lsda+@xmath2 yield qualitatively similar results , with an optical mode not only in the @xmath0 $ ] but also in the @xmath1 $ ] direction .",
    "the acoustic branch is well described within lsda and lsda+@xmath2 , but the optical branch is too high in energy .",
    "this discrepancy between theory and experiment can be traced back to the overestimation of the exchange splitting in the lsda.@xcite indeed , when we reduce the exchange splitting by one - half as in ref .",
    ", we obtain reasonable agreement with the experiments .",
    "the corresponding dispersion , shown in fig.[spin_wave_dispersion](c ) , is similar to that of karlsson and aryasetiawan.@xcite     in the brillouin zone within ( a ) lsda , ( b ) lsda+@xmath2 , and ( c ) lsda with a reduced exchange splitting .",
    "the experimental dispersion is taken from refs . and .",
    "]    in fig.[magnon_spectra ] we show the imaginary part of the magnetic response function @xmath52 for selected wave vectors along the @xmath0 $ ] and @xmath1 $ ] directions .",
    "the peak amplitudes are again scaled to the same height for presentational purposes .",
    "the obtained spin - wave spectra along @xmath0 $ ] are in very good agreement with previous calculations.@xcite in particular , a double - peak structure starts to develop from @xmath143 . for larger wave vectors the two peaks overlap , resulting in a rather broad single feature , which can be decomposed into two lorentzian peaks as shown in fig.[double_peaks ] for @xmath144 . as the wave vector increases , the intensity of the lower peak decreases in agreement with experiments.@xcite in the @xmath1 $ ] direction the double peak is not so clear within the lsda .",
    "nevertheless , the calculated structure can still be decomposed into two lorentzians ( results not shown ) , but the @xmath84 interval where the double - peak structure appears is small compared to the @xmath0 $ ] direction .     for selected wave vectors along ( a ) the @xmath0 $ ] and ( b ) the @xmath1 $ ] directions in the brillouin zone .",
    "the double - peak structure for certain wave vectors is clearly visible .",
    "all peak amplitudes are scaled to the same height . ]     into two lorentzian peaks . in the inset",
    "we compare with the original curve . ]",
    "our calculations show that the exchange splitting has a strong influence on the emergence of a double - peak structure . to demonstrate this we consider two @xmath84 points in the @xmath0 $ ] direction where such features appear and calculate the lsda spin - wave spectra by reducing the exchange splitting gradually by 0.1 ev in each step , up to one - half of its original value .",
    "the results are presented in fig.[exchange_splitting ] .",
    "even a very small reduction in the exchange splitting by 0.1 ev strongly suppresses the double - peak feature .",
    "as the exchange splitting reduces further , the width of the peaks becomes narrower , indicating an increased spin - wave life time .",
    "when the exchange splitting is reduced by one - half and corresponds to the experimental value , the optical branch completely disappears in the @xmath1 $ ] direction , while it is shifted to larger wave vectors in the @xmath0 $ ] direction .",
    "the situation is very similar within lsda+@xmath2 with a reduced exchange splitting .",
    "karlsson and aryasetiawan found a weak double - peak structure with a reduced exchange splitting for @xmath145 when they used a small gaussian broadening parameter in the brillouin - zone integration,@xcite but this double - peak structure becomes smeared out if a larger broadening is used .",
    "based on the symmetry properties of fcc ni , the spin - wave dispersion should be isotropic , i.e. , one expects an optical branch also in the @xmath1 $ ] direction , but the resolution of the presently available experimental data is not sufficient to observe it.@xcite of course , a reduction of the exchange splitting in the calculations does not solve all problems for ni . in particular , too large band widths and the incorrect isotropic exchange splitting remain important issues whose effect on the spin - wave spectra requires further investigations .    as pointed out by cooke _",
    "et al._,@xcite the double - peak structure in the magnetic excitation spectra of 3__d _ _ ferromagnets stems from the @xmath69-dependent exchange splitting and interband transitions .",
    "a detailed analysis was given by karlsson and aryasetiawan,@xcite who showed that the double - peak structure in fcc ni is implicitly contained in the kernel @xmath47 , i.e. , it is a band - structure effect arising from the fact that @xmath146 possesses additional structure below the stoner peak , which in turn gives rise to a weak dip structure in @xmath147 via the hilbert transformation .",
    "such a weak dip structure appears as a second peak in the spin - wave excitation spectrum for particular wave vectors .",
    "this observation is indirectly confirmed by our analysis .",
    "the application of a hubbard @xmath2 in the lsda+@xmath2 calculation shifts majority - spin and minority - spin states more or less rigidly , and the optical branch appears in the lsda and lsda+@xmath2 around the same wave vector @xmath84 along @xmath0 $ ] , while a reduction of the exchange splitting leads to an appearance of the optical branch at higher @xmath84 values .     for @xmath148 and @xmath149 for different exchange splitting within lsda .",
    "the spectra for the original lsda exchange splitting are included for comparison . ]",
    "the magnetic response function @xmath52 allows to extract information about the spin - wave life times , which are inversely proportional to the widths of the spin - wave peaks .",
    "if ni were a strong ferromagnet , one would get well defined @xmath129 peaks up to about 0.3 ev in the spin - wave spectra , corresponding to the energy difference between the highest occupied majority - spin 3__d _ _ band and the fermi level , i.e. , the stoner gap . however , ni is not a truly strong ferromagnet due to the _ sp - d _ hybridized majority states around the fermi energy , and stoner excitations thus occur essentially at all energies .",
    "this means that spin waves decay into stoner excitations for all non - zero wave vectors , which is reflected by a finite width of the spin - wave peaks as shown in fig.[magnon_spectra ] .",
    "the life time of the spin waves depends on the details of the coupling between these excitations and on the density of states of the stoner excitations .",
    "it should be noted that in itinerant ferromagnets the life time of the spin waves becomes infinite in the limit of a vanishing wave vector , provided that spin - orbit coupling is ignored . as seen in fig.[magnon_spectra ] , for small wave vectors the spin - wave peaks are indeed narrow , and",
    "the damping is hence weak , i.e. , the life times are long .",
    "as the wave vector increases , the spin - wave dispersion enters into the region with a high density of states of stoner excitations , and the decay mechanism becomes more efficient . in both crystallographic directions considered here",
    "the maximum damping occurs in the region where the double - peak structure appears .",
    "in contrast to the findings of cooke _",
    "_ et al.,__@xcite the spin - wave peaks associated with the optical branch are narrower than the acoustic ones in our work , and the peak widths stay almost constant throughout the brillouin zone , while the peak widths in the acoustic branch increase with the wave vector .",
    "this might in fact explain why the acoustic branch disappears in the middle of the brillouin zone in the neutron - scattering experiments.@xcite    finally , we focus on the spin - wave stiffness constant @xmath150 . in ferromagnets",
    "the spin waves show a quadratic dispersion law @xmath151 for small wave vectors .",
    "the values for ni obtained with different methods are listed in table[table_ni ] .",
    "our lsda estimate of @xmath152 is substantially larger than the experimental value @xmath153 . with the reduced exchange splitting",
    "@xmath150 increases even further to @xmath154 , whereas lsda+@xmath2 provides a much better estimate of @xmath155 , which reflects the importance of static correlation effects in ni .",
    "we note that our lsda estimate for the spin - wave stiffness of fcc ni is in good agreement with calculations based on constrained dft in the adiabatic approximation . using the frozen - magnon technique rosengaard and",
    "johansson@xcite found @xmath156 , which is very similar to the values obtained by schilfgaarde and antropov@xcite ( @xmath157 ) and by pajda _ _ et al.__@xcite ( @xmath158 ) , who employed real - space methods .",
    "as the adiabatic approximation becomes exact in the limit of long wave lengths ( @xmath159),@xcite this can be compared with values obtained from more rigorous approaches based on the dynamical transverse spin susceptibility or magnetic response function . however , within constrained dft the second branch in the spin - wave dispersion of ni can not be described .",
    "in conclusion , we have developed a computational method to study excitation spectra of magnetic materials from first principles .",
    "the method is based on many - body perturbation theory .",
    "the main quantity of interest is the transverse magnetic response function , which treats both collective spin - wave excitations and single - particle spin - flip stoner excitations on an equal footing . in order to describe the former we include appropriate vertex corrections in the form of a multiple - scattering @xmath6-matrix , which describes the coupling of electrons and holes with different spins . to reduce the numerical cost for the calculation of the four - point @xmath6-matrix we exploit a transformation to maximally localized wannier functions that takes advantage of the short spatial range of electronic correlation in the partially filled _ d _ or _ f _ orbitals of magnetic materials .",
    "our implementation is based on the flapw method .",
    "the developed scheme was employed to calculate the matrix elements of the coulomb potential for the series of 3__d _ _ transition metals in the mlwf basis .",
    "special attention was given to the ferromagnets fe , co and ni .",
    "we showed that the matrix elements of the screened coulomb potential are rather different for the nm and fm states and that the difference increases with the exchange splitting in the ni - co - fe sequence , which can be accounted for on the basis of the total density of states around the fermi level for the corresponding systems .",
    "the magnetic excitations in fcc ni were studied in detail based on the lsda and lsda+@xmath2 methods .",
    "both schemes give qualitatively similar results for the spin - wave spectra and dispersion .",
    "however , correlation effects seem to be important for the spin - wave stiffness constant , which is overestimated within lsda .",
    "our calculations indicate the existence of an optical branch in the spin - wave dispersion of ni along the @xmath1 $ ] in addition to that along the @xmath0 $ ] direction in the brillouin zone .",
    "although the acoustic branch is well described within lsda and lsda+@xmath2 , the optical branch appears to be too high in energy .",
    "this discrepancy between theory and experiment can be attributed to the overestimation of the exchange splitting or , in other words , to the use of the kohn - sham green function in the calculation of the kernel @xmath47 instead of the renormalized one .    in the lsda kohn - sham green function",
    "the long and short - range correlation effects are not taken into account properly .",
    "the former can be treated within the @xmath38 approximation , while the latter require the summation of spin - dependent @xmath6-matrix contributions . in the future",
    "we plan to incorporate electron - electron ( hole - hole ) and electron - magnon scattering processes into the electronic self - energy by means of the @xmath6-matrix formalism , which improves the theoretical description of the quasiparticle band structure .",
    "in particular , it is expected to yield the correct exchange splitting in magnetic materials .",
