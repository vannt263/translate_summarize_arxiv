    "resonance absorption lines from metallic ions in the ism of distant galaxies along the line of sight to a qso provide a powerful method for the determination of chemical abundances at high redshifts , and also reveal the properties of low - density gas that is difficult or even impossible to detect with any other method , even in the nearby universe .",

    "also , systems with high column densities are expected to remain mainly neutral due to self shielding , alleviating the need for uncertain ionization corrections to the abundances .",
    "there is still much debate as to the nature of the galaxies hosting dlas and sub - dlas . even at low redshift ,",
    "finding a faint galaxy near the bright point source of the qso is challenging . at higher redshift ,",
    "the cosmological dimming of surface brightness ( @xmath22 ) makes galaxy detections even more difficult . nonetheless , these systems are a unique laboratory to study the ism of galaxies over a wide range of redshifts .    at @xmath23 ,",
    "the lyman-@xmath0 line shifts above the atmospheric cutoff at @xmath24 , and ground based surveys can efficiently search for dla systems .",
