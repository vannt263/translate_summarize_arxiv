    "recently the inclusive decay spectra of heavy hadrons have attracted renewed attention .",
    "it has been shown that by a combination of heavy quark effective theory and the operator product expansion one may perform a systematic @xmath2 expansion of the charged lepton spectrum in inclusive heavy hadron decays @xcite - @xcite . however , it turns out that an adequate description of the endpoint region , where the charged lepton energy @xmath3 , requires a partial resummation of the operator product expansion , yielding a result analogous to the leading twist terms in deep inelastic scattering .",
    "in particular , it involves the analogue of the parton distribution function , which in the present case describes the endpoint region of the lepton spectrum .",
    "while in most of the phase space the nonperturbative corrections may be described in terms of a few parameters , the endpoint region needs the input of a nonperturbative function @xcite-@xcite .",
    "these recent ideas constitute a substantial conceptual progress towards a model independent description of inclusive decay spectra , including the endpoint region .",
    "however , aside from the nonperturbative effects one also has to include qcd radiative corrections before one may confront the theory with data .",
    "these corrections have been calculated @xcite-@xcite and are known to be small for @xmath4 transitions over the whole phase space .",
    "this is also true for the @xmath5 case , as long as one is not too close to the endpoint @xmath3 .",
    "neglecting the mass of the @xmath6 quark one finds sudakov - like double logarithms of the form @xmath7 as well as single logarithms @xmath8 , indicating a breakdown of perturbation theory close to the endpoint .    in the present context",
    "the qcd radiative corrections have been studied by falk et al.@xcite and bigi et al.@xcite .",
    "falk et al .",
    "arrive at the conclusion that the endpoint region of the @xmath9 decays is strongly affected by qcd radiative corrections and in principle a resummation to all orders becomes necessary .",
    "the conclusion of @xcite is that the extraction of the nonperturbative effects becomes practically impossible due to large and mainly uncontrollable perturbative effects .    in @xcite",
    "the sudakov logarithms are exponentiated leading to a strong modification of the endpoint region .",
    "the authors of @xcite suggest that uncontrollable radiative corrections discussed in @xcite may be eliminated by the appropriate choice of the scale @xmath10 entering the strong coupling .",
    "they use @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the characteristic momentum of light degrees of freedom in the heavy meson .",
    "however , this leads to a strong modification of the shape of the spectrum near the endpoint and the reliability of the calculation becomes questionable .",
    "unfortunately , it is only the endpoint region of charmless @xmath1 decays , which is not buried in the huge background of the charmed decays .",
    "the kinematic endpoint of the charmed @xmath1 decays is @xmath13 2.3 gev , while for the charmless semileptonic decay it is @xmath14 2.6 gev .",
    "hence there is only a window of at maximum 300 mev , which may be attributed solely to the transition @xmath15 .",
    "the size of this window is of the order of the mass difference of the heavy meson and the heavy quark , @xmath16 , and thus it is not dominated by a few resonances",
    ". this would be the case in a smaller region of the size @xmath17 , which is of the order of tens of mev , and in which methods mentioned above would fail , since they are based on parton hadron duality .",
    "the present paper is an attempt to define quantities which are on one hand experimentally accessible , and on the other hand allow to disentangle perturbative and nonperturbative effects .",
    "our suggestion is to calculate appropriate moments @xmath18 of the measured spectrum , which are defined in such a way that they allow an expansion in both @xmath19 and @xmath20 , at least for some range of indices @xmath21 .",
    "similar ideas have been put forward previously in @xcite and @xcite . however , in these papers there has been no detailed numerical study of such moments , including both radiative and nonperturbative effects .    in the next section",
    "we shall reconsider the perturbative and nonperturbative contributions to the decay spectrum of inclusive semileptonic charmless @xmath1 decays and give the definition of the moments .",
    "in section 3 we perform a numerical study from which we obtain constraints on the range of the index @xmath21 of the moments .",
    "finally we give our conclusions and comment on the extraction of @xmath22 .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite -@xcite that one may obtain a systematic @xmath23 expansion for inclusive decay rates and the corresponding spectra .",
    "the leading term in this expansion is the free quark decay , and the first nonvanishing corrections appear formally at the order @xmath24 .",
    "these are genuinely nonperturbative corrections , which are given in terms of two matrix elements @xmath25 the parameter @xmath26 is given in terms of the @xmath27 mass splitting @xmath28 gev@xmath29 .",
    "the matrix element @xmath30 is not as easily accessible , in particular it has not yet been determined experimentally .",
    "the theoretical estimates vary over a broad range @xcite of about @xmath31 gev@xmath29 ; thus we shall consider below a typical `` small '' value @xmath32 gev@xmath33 and a `` large '' one , @xmath34 gev@xmath33 .",
    "the result for the spectrum of the inclusive decay @xmath35 , neglecting the mass of the @xmath6 quark , is given by @xmath36 \\theta(1-y ) \\\\",

    "in fact , it has been pointed out in @xcite that for the decay spectra the expansion parameter is in fact @xmath40 $ ] , which becomes large close to the endpoint .",
    "still these terms have an interpretation as being the first few terms of a moment expansion of a nonperturbative function describing the behavior of the spectrum close to the endpoint @xcite-@xcite : @xmath41     =   2 \\gamma_b \\int^1_{(y-1)m_b/\\bar\\lambda}f(x)dx   , \\ ] ] where @xmath42 denotes the @xmath43th derivative of the @xmath38 function .",
    "note that @xmath44 vanishes and @xmath45 may be read off from ( [ npc ] ) to be @xmath46 .",
    "the function @xmath47 may be written formally as @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the positive light cone component of the covariant derivative .",
    "this function has support only in a region of @xmath50 .",
    "in particular , the function @xmath51 leads to some `` smearing '' of the endpoint region , with the effect that the endpoint of the spectrum is shifted from the parton model endpoint @xmath52 to the physical endpoint @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the @xmath1-meson mass .",
    "below we shall use some model input for @xmath51 to estimate the size of the higher order corrections close to the endpoint .    aside from these nonperturbative corrections",
    "there are also perturbative ones , which have been calculated some time ago . the order @xmath55 corrections are known for all values of the lepton energy @xcite-@xcite ; however , since we are interested only in the behavior close to the endpoint , we shall consider here only the contributions relevant in this region . it turns out , that the order @xmath55 corrections exhibit doubly and singly logarithmic divergencies at the endpoint .",
    "up to terms vanishing at the endpoint , the result reads @xcite @xmath56,\\ ] ] where at the endpoint @xmath57    the scale @xmath10 of the strong coupling is not yet fixed in this expression ; any scale choice will formally only affect subleading terms .",
    "however , from physical considerations one may be lead to chose @xmath58 as it was done in @xcite , but this is equivalent to @xmath58 , since in the endpoint region @xmath59 .",
    "] , leading to an even more singular behavior as @xmath60 . in any case , a resummation of the singular terms becomes mandatory in order to describe the spectrum close to the endpoint .",
    "the common folklore is that the doubly logarithmic terms in ( [ rc ] ) exponentiate , and at the level of the sudakov logarithms the radiative corrections become @xmath61   .\\ ] ] again the problem arises of the scale of @xmath55 and we shall compare below two choices . using the one loop expression for @xmath55 @xmath62 we will compare the results obtained for @xmath63 and @xmath58 , the latter expression leading to @xmath64 } \\right ] .\\ ] ] in the endpoint region one obtains qualitatively a behavior of the form @xcite @xmath65 where @xmath66}\\ ] ] behaves approximately like a constant in the region of interest @xcite .",
    "however , after such a resummation to all orders of perturbation theory , it is not obvious , how to disentangle perturbative and nonperturbative contributions any more .",
    "this becomes clear , if one really treats @xmath67 as a constant , in which case one may rewrite ( [ bigi1 ] ) @xmath68 }                    \\right\\ } ,   \\label{bigi1a}\\ ] ] which in this form looks like a nonperturbative contribution .",
    "the above discussion shows that the endpoint region is in fact difficult to describe .",
    "on one hand there are large nonperturbative contributions , on the other hand there are perturbative contributions , becoming large in the endpoint region .",
    "these remarks , however , apply only to the spectrum itself .",
    "it has already been shown in @xcite that it may be helpful to consider appropriately defined moments of the spectrum ; e.g.the moments of the spectrum taken with respect to the parton model endpoint are related to the coefficients of the most singular @xmath38 function like singularities at the endpoint , in each order in the @xmath23 expansion .    here",
    "we propose to consider a slightly different set of moments , namely @xmath69 which may be rewritten in terms of the moments as defined in @xcite . as we shall discuss in detail below ,",
    "these moments have , for some range of @xmath21 , a simultaneous expansion in @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "this range of @xmath21 is specified by two requirements .",
    "experimental information will be available only close in the endpoint region , and thus @xmath21 has to be large enough to be sensitive to this region .",
    "on the other hand , the larger @xmath21 is , the stronger the sensitivity to the details of the endpoint region is . in other words , only for not too large @xmath21 one may perform the simultaneous perturbative and nonperturbative expansion ; the problems present in the spectrum will reappear in the behavior of the moments @xmath18 for large @xmath21 .",
    "in fact , from order of magnitude considerations one would expect that there is no such range in @xmath21 , where @xmath21 is large enough to be sensitive to the endpoint , and in which nonperturbative and radiative effects still remain under control .",
    "however , it turns out from the more detailed study presented below that there might be such a a window in @xmath21 .    in the next section",
    "we shall perform a numerical study for the radiative corrections and the nonperturbative contributions , in order to find a range in @xmath21 where one may reliably calculate the moments @xmath18 .",
    "we shall first consider the moments of the differential distribution in the naive parton model , without any corrections .",
    "the spectrum is given by the parton model expression and one obtains for the moments to the zeroth order @xmath70 however , we are mainly interested in the endpoint region , where the parton model spectrum may be approximated by ( [ endpoint ] ) , and the moments obtained in this approximation are @xmath71 in fig.[fig1 ] we plot the moments obtained from the full parton model rate versus the approximation ( [ m0approx ] ) .",
    "the comparison between the two sets gives some impression , at what @xmath21 one is sensitive only to the endpoint region ; from the figure one reads off that already at @xmath72 one mainly obtains information on the endpoint .    on the other hand",
    ", data will be available in the near future only for lepton energies above 2.3 gev .",
    "thus we shall in the following also consider moments , in which the integration over @xmath21 is restricted to a range @xmath73 @xmath74 where realistic values for @xmath75 will be in the region of @xmath76 .",
    "introducing such a lower cut will change ( [ m0approx ] ) to @xmath77 from which we estimate that for @xmath76 the sixth moment will get about @xmath78 , the tenth moment already about @xmath79 contribution from the region @xmath80 , at least in the naive parton model . on the other hand ,",
    "an upper limit of @xmath21 is given by the experimental resolution .",
    "if data on @xmath5 semileptonic transitions is available only in the small window between 2.3 gev and 2.6 gev one may not expect enough data to extract moments higher than about ten . in what follows",
    "we shall thus concentrate on moments less than ten .",
    "next we turn to the nonperturbative corrections .",
    "they have been been given in ( [ npc ] ) to order @xmath81 .",
    "taking the moments of ( [ npc ] ) one obtains in the endpoint approximation ( [ endpoint ] ) @xmath82 .\\ ] ] the dependence on @xmath21 of the various terms in @xmath18 reflects , how singular the contribution is at the endpoint of the lepton spectrum .",
    "the most singular term is the one with the derivative of the @xmath38 function ; this leads to a linear dependence in @xmath21 .",
    "the terms behaving like a @xmath38 function yield constant terms in the moments , while terms with step functions will decrease as @xmath83 if @xmath21 becomes large .    in a similar way as for the parton model we may estimate the effects of a lower cut off @xmath75 according to ( [ mcut ] ) . for the terms involving step function",
    "the result is qualitatively the same as for the parton model , while for the contributions with @xmath38 function like singularities there is no dependence on the lower cut , since these are concentrated at @xmath84 .",
    "higher moments will become more and more sensitive to what happens in the endpoint region .",
    "thus ( [ npfull ] ) is not valid for @xmath21 becoming too large . in order to estimate the value of @xmath21 ,",
    "where the expansion breaks down , we have to consider an even more singular contribution .",
    "this is contained in the next order of the @xmath2 expansion , and has the form @xmath85 where the parameter @xmath86 is related to the matrix element @xmath87 taking the moment of this gives a contribution quadratic in @xmath21 @xmath88 neglecting the higher orders in the @xmath2 expansion of the moments is only justified , if @xmath89 estimating @xmath90 to be @xmath91 mev@xmath92 one obtains @xmath93 which means that only the nonperturbative contributions to the first few moments may be calculated to lowest order in the @xmath2 expansion .",
    "it is a fortunate circumstance that this upper limit in @xmath21 coincides with the maximal @xmath21 accessible in experiment .    in order to estimate higher moments one has to perform a resummation of the most singular terms at the endpoint to all orders in @xmath2 , in other words",
    ", one has to include these effects using the nonperturbative function @xmath47 defined in ( [ npfunc ] ) . in terms of this",
    "the rate is given by ( [ eq : contraction ] ) , which describes the behavior of the lepton spectrum close to the endpoint , namely over a region of the order @xmath94 .",
    "there is , however , an even smaller region @xmath95 , the resonance region , in which only a few resonances contribute to the spectrum .",
    "this region will start to contribute significantly to the moments for @xmath96 which means that moments with @xmath97 will be determines from the contributions of only very few light resonances .",
    "the function @xmath51 is genuinely nonperturbative and it has been considered using several models .",
    "one frequently used model is the one of altarelli et al .",
    "@xcite , which has been rewritten in terms of the nonperturbative function @xmath47 @xcite given by @xmath98 here @xmath99 , where @xmath54 is the mass of the @xmath1-meson .",
    "the second parameter @xmath100 is the so called fermi - momentum which corresponds to the motion of the heavy quark inside of the heavy meson ; see @xcite for precise definition .",
    "finally , @xmath101 is implicitly given in terms of the other two parameters by @xmath102 where @xmath103 is a modified bessel function .",
    "the model as given in @xcite has only one parameter @xmath101 , which has a physical interpretation , namely @xmath104 .",
    "one may also relate the model parameters to the qcd matrix element @xmath30 , since appropriate moments of @xmath51 are related to matrix elements of powers of covariant derivatives between heavy meson states . in this way one obtains the relation @xmath105 which may be used to determine the value of the model parameter @xmath101 in terms of @xmath106 and @xmath30 ; it has been pointed out in @xcite that only the combination @xmath107 enters in the model .",
    "in particular , eq.([connection2 ] ) has no solution , if @xmath108 is larger than 0.57 . for a value of @xmath106 of 500 mev",
    ", this means that the model can not accommodate a value for @xmath109 of more than 0.42 gev@xmath33 . for this value",
    "we have @xmath110 , and the nonperturbative function simplifies @xmath111 we shall use this model to estimate the effects of the most singular terms occurring in higher orders in the @xmath23 expansion .    the value of @xmath30 is not yet known accurately .",
    "we shall consider below a `` small '' value @xmath112 gev@xmath33 as well as the largest value possible in the above model , @xmath113 gev@xmath33 .",
    "the first value of @xmath30 corresponds to @xmath114 , while the large one is the limiting case @xmath110 . in our final result",
    "we shall also consider a `` large '' value @xmath34gev@xmath33 .",
    "furthermore , we will use @xmath115 gev and @xmath116 mev in the following numerical analysis .    in fig.[fig2",
    "] we plot the nonperturbative corrections @xmath117 to the moments , @xmath118 .",
    "the upper plot corresponds to @xmath32 gev@xmath29 , and the lower one to the maximal value for @xmath30 which can be accommodated in the model ( [ accmm ] ) , @xmath119 gev@xmath29 .",
    "the solid dots are the nonperturbative corrections according to ( [ npfull ] ) , while the solid triangles are the corrections using the model ( [ accmm ] ) for the nonperturbative function @xmath51 .",
    "we have also plotted separately the contributions to the moments originating from the term linear in @xmath21 of ( [ npfull ] ) ( open circles ) and the rest , i.e.  the constant terms and terms decreasing with @xmath21 ( open squares ) .    in both cases ,",
    "small and large @xmath30 , one finds a substantial contribution from the chromomagnetic moment term @xmath26 at least for small moments .",
    "the term from the kinetic energy operator has a linear dependence on @xmath21 ( c.f .",
    "( [ npfull ] ) ) while the chromomagnetic term behaves like a constant for large @xmath21 .",
    "the linear terms of ( [ npfull ] ) are well reproduced by the model for the nonperturbative function ; this is to be expected , since the nonperturbative function contains only the most singular contribution in each order of the @xmath23 expansion , i.e. the leading twist term . on the other hand , from the fact that the linear term in @xmath21 from ( [ npfull ] ) already approximates the nonperturbative function quite well , one may conclude that the expansion ( [ npfull ] ) is in fact sufficient for the range of @xmath21 we are considering . in other words , the leading twist contribution modelled by the ansatz ( [ accmm ] ) may be replaced by the term proportional to @xmath120 in the @xmath23 expansion of the moments with high accuracy .",
    "however , the result ( [ npfull ] ) differs from what the nonperturbative function gives , mainly because of the chromomagnetic moment term and the constant terms proportional to @xmath30 .",
    "these term are less singular than the contribution of @xmath121 , but they contribute substantially to the moments @xmath122 . on the other hand ,",
    "the leading twist terms indicate that the @xmath23 expansion is satisfactory for @xmath122 and we conclude the expansion ( [ npfull ] ) is justified for the moments in the range considered .",
    "finally , one may also consider the effect of a lower cut off @xmath75 in the integration over @xmath123 as in ( [ mcut ] ) .",
    "the strongest effects are expected for large @xmath30 , so we plot in fig.[cutrom ] the nonperturbative corrections for @xmath110 in the model ( [ accmm ] ) , for different values of the cut off @xmath75 .",
    "for the realistic case @xmath76 one finds only small corrections for @xmath124 , and the conclusion concerning the minimal @xmath21 obtained from the parton model remain valid .",
    "next we consider the radiative corrections . in fig.[fig3 ] we plot these corrections to the moments @xmath125 obtained from the one loop result ( [ rc ] ) , from the exponentiation of the leading double logarithms , for both fixed scale @xmath63 and for variable scale @xmath126 .",
    "we use in ( [ rc ] ) the value of @xmath55 at @xmath127 , @xmath128 , corresponding to @xmath129 mev .    the radiative correction contribution to the moments with @xmath130",
    "is rather stable , in other words , it does not depend on how one deals with the endpoint singularities .",
    "compared to the nonperturbative corrections for small @xmath30 they are much larger , dominating the corrections to the moments .",
    "this smallness of the nonperturbative corrections is due to an almost cancellation between the contributions of @xmath30 and @xmath26 in the region of @xmath21 we are considering .    the effect of a lower cut in the @xmath123 integration for the moments as in ( [ mcut ] ) leads to a doubly logarithmic dependence of the form @xmath131 on the lower cut @xmath75 , and , if @xmath75 comes close to 1 , the effects of the lower cut may become large , forcing us to go to higher @xmath21 . however , numerically it turns out that with realistic values of @xmath75 the situation still remains under control .",
    "this is shown quantitatively in fig.[cutr ] , where we use expressions ( [ rc ] ) ( upper figure ) and ( [ rc2 ] ) ( lower figure ) to estimate the effect of a lower bound . again , for the realistic value @xmath76 the corrections to the moments @xmath124 are less than ten per cent .",
    "our main conclusion is thus that one may use the combined expansion for the moments below @xmath132 , which is given by @xmath133 \\nonumber \\\\ & & + { \\cal o } \\left(\\left(\\frac{\\bar\\lambda}{m_b}\\right)^3 , \\alpha_s^2 ( m_b ) ,                      \\left(\\frac{\\bar\\lambda}{m_b}\\right)^2 \\alpha_s ( m_b )                      \\right ) \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have defined @xmath134 \\\\ & & \\longrightarrow \\frac{1}{n } \\ln ^2 n \\mbox { for } n \\gg 1 \\nonumber \\\\ \\sigma ( n ) & = & \\sum_{k=0}^n \\left ( \\begin{array}{c } n \\\\ k \\end{array } \\right ) ( -1)^{k+1 } \\left ( \\frac{1}{k+1 } \\right)^2 = - \\frac{1}{n+1 } \\sum_{k=1}^{n+1 } \\frac{1}{k } \\longrightarrow -\\frac{1}{n } \\ln n \\mbox { for } n \\gg 1\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the values for @xmath135 and @xmath136 are tabulated in tab.[tab1 ] .",
    "furthermore , the fact that data will be available only for @xmath137 only has a small effect on the moments in the range of @xmath21 considered ; the moments including a lower cut @xmath75 may still be treated in the combined expansion .",
    ".numerical values for the functions @xmath135 and @xmath136 [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the final result for the moments is plotted in fig.[fig4 ] , where the moments obtained from the combined expansion in @xmath19 and @xmath20 according to ( [ final ] ) are shown .",
    "the solid dots are the result for `` small '' @xmath32 gev@xmath33 , and the solid boxes are for `` large '' @xmath34 gev@xmath33 .    to summarize , one may analyze the moments up to 12 before the corrections become too big , of order 100@xmath138 .",
    "we also see that nonperturbative corrections are very small for small values of @xmath30 , and key role is played by the radiative ones .",
    "the reason for the smallness of nonperturbative corrections is an almost complete cancellation between the terms proportional to @xmath30 and @xmath26 . for the case",
    "@xmath139 gev@xmath29 the cancellation is only partial and nonperturbative correction are sizable and positive .",
    "this indicates that higher twist effects may play an important role also in the endpoint region , and taking into account only the leading twist contribution , corresponding to the function @xmath51 , is not enough .",
    "this remark , however , applies to a precise description of the spectrum in the endpoint region , while for the moments with sufficiently small @xmath21 it is safe to use the combined expansion in @xmath19 and @xmath20 , which contains pieces of nonleading twist in the constant terms and the contributions decreasing with @xmath21 .",
    "since data on @xmath5 transitions will be restricted to a small window between 2.3 and 2.6 gev , it is mainly the endpoint of the spectrum which will be accessible in experiment . on the other hand ,",
    "the endpoint region is the most difficult region from the theoretical point of view , since here large radiative corrections are entangled with large nonperturbative effects .",
    "in fact , it is not even obvious , whether and how one may distinguish the two sources of corrections close to the endpoint .",
    "the main result of this paper is that one may define suitable averages of the inclusive decay distribution of semileptonic @xmath5 transitions , which on one hand may be calculated reliably , and which on the other hand are mainly sensitive in the window between the kinematic endpoints of @xmath4 and @xmath5 semileptonic decays .",
    "we have concentrated on moments of the energy spectrum of the charged lepton and have performed a detailed numerical analysis , which shows that moments for @xmath122 may be systematically calculated in a combined @xmath19 and @xmath140 expansion ; both types of corrections may be studied systematically .",
    "furthermore , the moments with @xmath130 are sensitive mainly in the experimentally accessible window .",
    "thus there is indeed a region @xmath141 for which the moments defined above may be useful to perform a determination of @xmath0 .",
    "in fact , such a combined expansion is even valid for moments defined with a lower cut off @xmath75 , as given in ( [ mcut ] ) as long as @xmath75 is not too close to one .",
    "furthermore , for a realistic value @xmath76 the deviations of the moments including a cut from the full ones are small in the region of @xmath21 considered .",
    "thus for an experimental analysis one may as well deal with the moments including a cut .    in order to extract @xmath0 from these moments one has to know the two matrix elements @xmath30 and @xmath26 .",
    "while @xmath26 is known from the hadron spectrum , @xmath30 is still uncertain ; we have used typical `` large '' and `` small '' values , but one may hope to extract this parameter from experiment eventually .",
    "one possibility to perform a determination of @xmath30 is in fact to use the moments defined above",
    ". the ratio of two moments will depend only on @xmath142 , @xmath143 and @xmath19 .",
    "the strong coupling and @xmath26 are known , and one may in principle extract @xmath30 and @xmath127 from two ratios of moments . after having done this",
    "one may then use any one of the moments to obtain @xmath144 and hence @xmath0 . to proceed along these lines",
    "one needs a measurement of three moments in the range @xmath141 ; any measurement of additional moments may be used to cross check the @xmath21 dependence of the moments .",
    "the idea presented here may be refined in various aspects , and we consider this paper as a first try to study whether one may extract @xmath0 using the moments of the decay distributions .",
    "as far as the radiative corrections are concerned , we have only considered the singular and nonvanishing terms close to the endpoint . in this point one",
    "may refine the analysis by taking into account the complete corrections , which may be found in the literature .",
    "furthermore , also the corrections of order @xmath20 have been considered @xcite and may be also included in the analysis .",
    "however , we do not expect that any of these higher order corrections will change any of our conclusions",
    ".    finally , one may also think of considering other averages of decay distributions and generalize the moments according to @xmath145 where @xmath146 is some set of functions .",
