    "gravitational modification is one of the main directions one can follow in order to describe the late - time universe acceleration and/or the early - time inflationary stage ( see for instance @xcite ) , which has the potential advantage of avoiding introducing exotic fields and the concept of dark energy ( see @xcite and references therein ) . definitely one should note that , apart from the different physical interpretation , one can transform from one approach to the other , partially or completely , keeping track only of the number of extra degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "thus , one can have various combined scenarios , with nonminimal couplings between gravity and scalar fields being the most used class .",
    "speaking of modified gravity , a natural question arises , namely what formulation of gravity to use as a basis of modification .",
    "the usual approach on the literature is to start from the standard curvature gravitational formulation , that is from the einstein - hilbert action of general relativity , and extend it in various ways @xcite .",
    "however , a different but still very interesting class of modified gravity could arise starting from torsional formulations of general relativity ( gr ) . in particular , it is well known that einstein also constructed the `` teleparallel equivalent of general relativity '' ( tegr ) , where gravity is described not by the curvature tensor but by the torsion one @xcite .",
    "the lagrangian of this theory is given by contractions of this torsion tensor , namely the torsion scalar @xmath0 , in a similar way that the lagrangian of general relativity is given by the ricci scalar @xmath1 , that is from contractions of the curvature tensor .",
    "hence , instead of modifying gr one could try to modify tegr .",
    "the most interesting feature is that although gr coincides with tegr at the level of equations , their modifications do not , and thus they correspond to different classes of gravitational modification .",
    "the simplest modification of tegr is to replace @xmath0 with @xmath2 in the action , resulting to @xmath2 gravity @xcite , in a similar way with the @xmath3 modification of gr .",
    "since @xmath2 gravity has no known curvature equivalent and is a novel modified class , its cosmological @xcite and black hole @xcite applications have attracted significant interest . a next extension of tegr arises if one construct and use higher - order torsion invariants , in a similar way to the use of higher - order curvature invariants in gr modifications .",
    "thus , constructing the teleparallel equivalent @xmath4 of the gauss - bonnet term @xmath5 , one can build the @xmath6 paradigm @xcite , which is not spanned by the @xmath7 class and thus is a novel gravitational modification .",
    "furthermore , one could extend tegr to @xmath8 scenario @xcite , with @xmath9 the matter lagrangian , or to @xmath10 theory @xcite , with @xmath11 the trace of the energy - momentum tensor , inspired respectively by the @xmath12 @xcite and @xmath13 @xcite extensions of curvature - based gravity , where again both these theories are different from their curvature counterparts .",
    "one could proceed further , and introduce nonminimal couplings in the framework of tegr , in a similar way that one introduces these couplings in gr @xcite . thus , in @xcite we formulated the scenario of `` teleparallel dark energy '' , in which @xmath0 is coupled to an extra scalar , and",
    "as expected this scalar - torsion theory is different from scalar-(curvature)tensor model , that is from nonminimal quintessence , with interesting phenomenology @xcite . since scalar - torsion theories are different than scalar-(curvature)tensor ones , in the present work we are interested in exploring various features of the cosmological dynamics of both theories , and investigate their differences and similarities .",
    "indeed , we do find that the behavior of the phase space is different in the two constructions , and amongst others we find that the scalar - torsion can be free from run - away solutions , which are typical for the standard curvature - based theory of non - minimally coupled scalar fields .",
    "the plan of the manuscript is outlined as follows : in section [ model ] we briefly present teleparallel equivalent of general relativity and its scalar - torsion extension . in section [ dynanal ]",
    "we perform a detailed dynamical analysis , while in section [ comparison ] we compare the obtained results with the corresponding behavior of nonminimal scalar - curvature theory .",
    "finally , section [ conclusions ] is devoted to the conclusions .",
    "in this section we briefly review the teleparallel formulation of general relativity and its modifications . in this construction",
    "the dynamical variables are the vierbein fields @xmath14 , which can be expressed in a coordinate basis as @xmath15 .",
    "the vierbeins at each space - time point form an orthonormal basis for the tangent space , and they are related to the metric tensor through @xmath16 where @xmath17 .",
    "concerning the independent object that defines the parallel transportation , i.e. the connection , we use the weitzenbck one @xmath18 @xcite , which leads to zero curvature .",
    "thus , the gravitational field is described by the torsion tensor , which reads @xmath19 in particular , constructing the torsion scalar @xmath0 as @xmath20 and using it as a lagrangian , variation with respect to the vierbeins leads to exactly the same equations with general relativity @xcite . that is why einstein named this theory `` teleparallel equivalent of general relativity '' ( tegr ) .",
    "one can be based on tegr and start constructing various extensions . as we discussed in the introduction ,",
    "the simplest extension is to replace @xmath0 by @xmath21 in the lagrangian , i.e. formulating @xmath2 gravity .",
    "introducing also the matter sector , the total action will be @xmath22+s_m,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is the matter action , @xmath24 and @xmath25 is the gravitational constant ( we set the light speed to one ) .",

    "we stress that although for @xmath32 one recovers tegr with a cosmological constant , and thus gr with a cosmological constant , for @xmath33 the theory is different from @xmath3 gravity .",
    "thus , @xmath2 gravity is a new gravitational modification and that is why it has attracted a significant interest in the literature @xcite .",
    "an alternative extension of tegr is to introduce a scalar field nonminimally coupled with @xmath0 , in a similar way that in curvature - based gravity one introduces a scalar field nonminimally coupled to @xmath1 . in particular , the total action will be @xcite @xmath34 ,   \\label{totalaction}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 is a canonical scalar field , @xmath36 its potential , and @xmath37 its arbitrary nonminimal coupling with the torsion scalar @xmath0 .",
    "variation with respect to the vierbein yields the coupled field equation @xmath38\\left [ e^{-1}\\partial_{\\mu}(ee_a^{\\rho}s_{\\rho}{}^{\\mu\\nu } ) -e_{a}^{\\lambda}t^{\\rho}{}_{\\mu\\lambda}s_{\\rho}{}^{\\nu\\mu}+\\frac{1 } { 4 } e_{a}^{\\nu}t \\right]\\nonumber \\\\ & & \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\   \\ , - e_{a}^{\\nu}\\left[\\frac{1}{2 } \\partial_\\mu\\phi\\partial^\\mu\\phi - v(\\phi)\\right]+    e_a^\\mu \\partial^\\nu\\phi\\partial_\\mu\\phi , \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\   \\ , + 2\\xi e_a^{\\rho}s_{\\rho}{}^{\\mu\\nu}b'(\\phi ) \\left(\\partial_\\mu\\phi\\right)= e_{a}^{\\rho}\\overset { \\mathbf{em}}t_{\\rho}{}^{\\nu } ,   \\label{eoms}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where primes denote the derivative of a function with respect to its argument .    in order to focus on the cosmological application of this theory",
    ", we impose the vierbein ansatz @xmath39 which leads to the flat friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) metric @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the scale factor .",
    "thus , with this vierbein ansantz , the equations of motion ( [ eoms ] ) give rise to the modified friedmann equations @xmath42,\\ ] ] @xmath43,\\ ] ] where @xmath44 is the hubble function , and dots denote differentiation with respect to @xmath45 .",
    "note that in the above relations we have used the relation @xmath46 , which holds for the vierbein choice ( [ veirbfrw ] ) .",
    "additionally , we have considered the matter lagrangian to correspond to a perfect fluid with energy density and pressure @xmath47 and @xmath48 respectively , and we have defined its equation - of - state parameter to be @xmath49 . finally , varying the action ( [ totalaction ] ) with respect to @xmath35 , and imposing the frw ansatz , we acquire the scalar field equation of motion @xmath50",
    "lastly , note that , as expected , for @xmath51 the scenario at hand coincides completely with standard quintessence , since in this case the scalar field is minimally coupled to tegr , which in turn coincides with general relativity .",
    "in the cosmological application of any gravitational theory one can find many analytical solutions , and an infinite number of numerical ones .",
    "however , the most important issue is to investigate the global features of the dynamics , that is to extract information about the given cosmological model that is independent of the initial conditions and the specific evolution .",
    "this is obtained using the powerful method of dynamical analysis , which allows to examine in a systematic way all the possible asymptotic cosmological behaviours , that is all the possibilities of the universe behaviour at late times . in particular ,",
    "if stable late - time solutions are revealed , it is implied that the universe will result to them independently of the initial conditions and the model parameters .",
    "the phase - space and stability analysis is performed by transforming the given cosmological model into its autonomous form , which in general will be of the form @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is a vector constituted by suitable chosen variables and @xmath54 the corresponding vector of the autonomous equations @xcite .",
    "then the critical points @xmath55 of this dynamical system are extracted imposing the condition @xmath56 .",
    "thus , in order to examine the stability of these critical points one expands the system around @xmath55 as @xmath57 , with @xmath58 the column vector of the variable perturbations , and for each critical point he expands the equations for the perturbations up to first order as @xmath59 , where the matrix @xmath60 contains all the coefficients of the perturbation equations .",
    "hence , the stability properties and the type of a specific critical point are determined by the eigenvalues of @xmath60 , namely if all eigenvalues have positive real parts then this point will be unstable , if they all have negative real parts then it will be stable , while if they change sign it will be a saddle point .",
    "let us apply the above method to the scalar - torsion cosmology that was presented in the previous section .",
    "as an example we will focus on power - law potentials and power - law coupling functions , since the exponential cases have been investigated elsewhere @xcite . in particular , in the following we consider the case where @xmath61 and @xmath62 where we focus on even @xmath63 in order for the potential to be non - negative . for convenience",
    "we choose @xmath64 , although the incorporation of the @xmath65 case is straightforward .",
    "additionally , since for @xmath51 the scenario at hand coincides completely with standard quintessence , in the following we focus on the case of interest of this work , that is on @xmath66 .",
    "the dynamical analysis proves to be different for the cases @xmath67 and @xmath68 , and thus in the following subsections we examine these cases separately .      in order to proceed , and as we described above , we introduce the following dimensionless auxiliary variables : @xmath69}\\\\ \\label{auxiliary2 } & & y=\\frac{\\kappa^2 v(\\phi)}{3",

    "is reduced by one . in this case , the cosmological equations of the scenario at hand are finally transformed to their autonomous form @xmath79 where we have replaced @xmath80 as it arises from ( [ bdef ] ) .    the system ( [ eq1]),([eq2 ] ) admits only one real critical point :      the critical point @xmath81 corresponds to @xmath82 , @xmath84 , which according to ( [ axmrelation ] ) leads to @xmath85 , and then using ( [ constraint ] ) to @xmath86 .",
    "since @xmath87 from ( [ auxiliary5 ] ) we deduce that the scalar field is also constant at @xmath88 , namely @xmath89 while according to ( [ hdoth2 ] ) we find that @xmath90 is zero .",
    "thus , knowing additionally that @xmath91 is non - zero , from ( [ auxiliary2 ] ) we deduce that the hubble function obtains a constant non - zero value at @xmath81 , namely @xmath92 and thus the universe is in a de sitter phase where the scale factor expands exponentially as @xmath93 where @xmath94,@xmath95 are constants .",
    "linearizing the perturbation equations around @xmath81 and extracting the eigenvalues of the corresponding perturbation matrix , as we discussed earlier , we find : due to the complexity of the above expressions it is not possible to derive analytical results for the signs of the real parts of these eigenvalues .",
    "thus , we perform a numerical scanning in the parameter space .             + in figs .",
    "[ n2 ] and [ n4 ] we present the stability regions in the parameter subspace @xmath96 for @xmath68 and @xmath97 respectively .",
    "since for @xmath98 , @xmath99 the de sitter solution exists only for negative @xmath100 ( see eq .",
    "( 29 ) ) , we restrict ourselves by odd integer @xmath101 , in other quadrants @xmath63 can be a continious variable ( in white zones the de sitter solution does not exist ) . as we observe , in the case where both @xmath102 and @xmath63 are positive we find that there is not any stability region , and thus point @xmath81 is saddle .",
    "however , in the case where @xmath99 , and for @xmath103 , we do find stability regions , that is in this case the de sitter point @xmath81 is stable .",
    "we do not consider negative @xmath63 further in the present paper .",
    "in this case we also use the auxiliary variables ( [ auxiliary1])-([auxiliary5 ] ) , the constraint ( [ constraint ] ) remains the same , but now relation ( [ axmrelation ] ) simplifies to @xmath104 moreover , instead of ( [ phidotdot]),([hdoth2 ] ) we now have @xmath105 hence , the autonomous form of the cosmological system becomes @xmath106    the system ( [ eq1b]),([eq2b ] ) admits four real critical points :      the first critical point @xmath107 corresponds to @xmath82 , @xmath83 , which according to ( [ axmrelationb ] ) leads to @xmath85 , and then using ( [ constraint ] ) gives @xmath86 ( again we focus on the case @xmath77 i.e. @xmath78 ) .",
    "hence , this point can be obtained from point @xmath81 of the previous subsection , setting @xmath68 . in particular , from the definition of @xmath70 in ( [ auxiliary5 ] ) we find that the scalar field is constant too , namely @xmath108 while from ( [ hdoth2b ] ) we deduce that @xmath90 is zero .",

    "the theory under investigation resembles better the theory with minimally coupled scalar field , where stable future regimes apart from oscillations are impossible for simple power - law potentials .",
    "the reason behind this difference is quite clear . in the equation of motion for the scalar field",
    "the additional term originating from the non - minimal coupling , for positive @xmath168 and even @xmath102 has the same sign as the potential term for even @xmath63 , and , as a result , can only enhance the driven force pushing the scalar field towards the minimum of its potential . on the contrary , looking at the equation of motion for the scalar field in the scalar - curvature case    @xmath189    we can see that additional term in the case of curvature non - minimal coupling has a more complicated structure , with different signs , and under some conditions can push the scalar field into infinity .",
    "hence , it is evident that in order to make non - trivial future asymptotics in the present scenario , we need to balance the potential and correction terms and thus we need either to consider negative @xmath168 or to match an increasing coupling function with a decreasing potential ( or vice versa , however this case is more `` exotic '' ) .",
    "for instance , as we saw , for positive even @xmath102 and @xmath63 the fixed point @xmath81 corresponding to de sitter solution exists only for negative @xmath168 .",
    "the detailed study of such suitable constructed solutions , based on the interplay between the potential and the coupling function , lies beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "studies of viability of such scenario for description of present cosmic acceleration requires also considering of matter contribution .",
    "we leave these interesting questions for a future investigation .",
    "secondly , concerning the past behavior , we also see that the past asymptotics in the scenario at hand are different from both minimal and nonminimal curvature theory . in both these scalar - curvature theories the source point on phase diagrams",
    "represents the massless field regime , existing if the potential is not too steep ( exponentially steep for curvature minimal coupling @xcite and @xmath190 for curvature non - minimal coupling @xcite ) .",
    "however , in teleparallel gravity with power - law potentials , this regime exists only if @xmath102 does not exceed @xmath191 . for @xmath103 ( as well as for @xmath68 , and @xmath184 ) we have infinite scalar field oscillations near a singularity , similar to those in the theory of a minimally coupled field with exponential potentials .",
    "finally , note that in the present scenario we find that the case of @xmath192 is exceptional since only under this condition the unstable exponential solution exists .",
    "this feature has no analogies in the curvature theory .",
    "in this work we investigated cosmological scenarios in the framework of teleparallel gravity with nonminimal coupling . although in the case of absence of the scalar field , or in the case of minimal coupling ,",
    "teleparallel gravity is completely equivalent with general relativity at the level of equations , when the nonminimal coupling is switched on the two theories become different , corresponding to distinct classes of gravitational modification .",
    "hence , in order to reveal the differences between nonminimal scalar - curvature and nonminimal scalar - torsion theories , we use the powerful method of dynamical analysis , which allow us to study their global behavior without the need of extracting exact analytical solutions .",
    "focusing on the cases of power - law potentials and nonminimal coupling functions , we showed that contrary to the case of scalar - curvature gravity , teleparallel gravity has no stable future solutions for positive nonminimal coupling , and the scalar field results always in oscillations .",
    "additionally , concerning the past behavior , while scalar - curvature exhibits a massless field regime for not too steep potentials , nonminimal scalar - torsion gravity exhibits this feature for not too steep coupling functions .",
    "the reason behind these differences is the specific and simple form of the nonminimal correction in the scalar field equation in the case of nonminimal scalar - torsion theory , comparing to the more complicated corresponding term in nonminimal scalar - curvature theory . in particular , in the former case the correction term is relatively simple and thus it can lead to well - determined changes in the dynamics comparing to the minimal model , while in the latter case the correction term is complicated and thus it can not lead to well - determined , one - way changes in the dynamics comparing to the minimal model .",
    "hence , since minimal scalar - curvature is equivalent with minimal scalar - torsion gravity , nonminimal scalar - torsion gravity is relatively close to them , while nonminimal scalar - curvature gravity is radically different .",
    "the significant difference of the two theories was already known @xcite , however in the present work we verified it analyzing in detail the dynamics of the pure scalar - gravity sector , in order to remove possible effects of the matter part .",
    "clearly , the torsional modification of gravity , and its coupling with scalar and matter sectors , brings novel and significant features , with no known curvature counterparts .",
    "thus , it would be interesting to include these capabilities in the model - building of cosmological scenarios .",
    "the research of ens is implemented within the framework of the action `` supporting postdoctoral researchers '' of the operational program `` education and lifelong learning '' ( actions beneficiary : general secretariat for research and technology ) , and is co - financed by the european social fund ( esf ) and the greek state .",
    "the work of at is supported by rfbr grant 14 - 02 - 00894 , and partially supported by the russian government program of competitive growth of kazan federal university .",
