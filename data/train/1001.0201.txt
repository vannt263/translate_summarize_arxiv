    "the area of the hypotenuse is one half of its base times its height , @xmath25 squaring this gives the sum of the squares of the areas of the legs !",
    "this computation is sometimes referred to as de gua s theorem after jean paul de gua de malves who was an 18th century french mathematician @xcite .",
    "the statement that this tetrahedron is _ right _ , boils down to the legs of the tetrahedron being the orthogonal projections of the hypotenuse into the coordinate hyperplanes .",

    "expanding , @xmath132 @xmath133 after a lot of cancellation and reordering we arrive at : @xmath134 where @xmath135 denotes the symmetric group on @xmath117 letters , and @xmath136 is the sign of the permutation sigma .",
    "notice that the sum over @xmath135 of the signed products is a classical formula for the determinant , so it reduces to @xmath137 where the @xmath128 is the determinant of the minor whose entries are indexed by @xmath138 with @xmath139 and @xmath140 ..    now suppose that @xmath141 .",

    "there is also a paper by atzema @xcite that proves the same theorem i proved here , via a more general result about the determinant of a product of matrices due to cauchy .",
    "i would be surprised if a proof along the lines that i gave here , did nt appear elsewhere .",
