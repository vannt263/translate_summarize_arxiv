    "since the discovery of the cosmic x - ray background ( cxb ) more than 35 years ago ( giacconi _ et al . _  1962 )",
    ", its origin has been a key issue of the x - ray astronomy ( for reviews see fabian and barcons 1992 ; hasinger 1996 ) .",
    "although the emission extends over a wide energy range in more than 5 decades from x - rays to @xmath11-rays , the main energy flux of the cxb is emitted in the hard x - ray band , peaked at @xmath12 20 kev .",
    "the spectrum resembles that of a hot plasma with a temperature of 40 kev ( marshall _ et al . _  1980",
    "; rothschild _ et al . _  1983 ) , and this introduced the possibility that hot plasmas uniformly fill the universe . however , the low level of distortion of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) spectrum by the compton up - scattering measured with _ cobe",
    "_ ruled out this possibility , implying that the origin of the cxb is the superposition of faint discrete sources ( mather _ et al._1994 ) .",
    "the understanding of the cxb origin has been quite different for the soft ( @xmath1323 kev ) , and the hard ( @xmath1423 kev ) energy bands , respectively . in the soft x - ray band , the _ rosat _  satellite resolved 7080% of the cxb in the 0.52 kev band into individual sources ( hasinger _ et al . _",
    "most of them are optically identified as ( type - i ) agns such as quasars ( schmidt _ et al . _",
    "the average spectrum of these agns coincides with that of the cxb in the 12 kev range having a photon index of @xmath15 of @xmath16 2 .",
    "the slope is steeper than that of the cxb extrapolated from above 2 kev , @xmath17 1.4 ( e.g. , gendreau _ et al . _  1995",
    "; ishisaki _ et al . _",
    "1999 ) .",
    "by contrast , in the hard x - ray band above 2 kev , the origin of the cxb has been less well understood , due to lack of imaging instruments .",

    ") , _ ariel v _ ( mchardy _",
    "et al . _  1981",
    ") , _ heao1 _  ( piccinotti _",
    "et al . _  1982",
    ") , and _ ginga _  ( kondo _ et al . _",
    "1992 ) performed x - ray surveys above the 2 kev band . however , since they carried collimated - type detectors where the source confusion becomes significant , the achieved sensitivity limits are at most @xmath18 erg s@xmath4 @xmath5  ( 210 kev ) , and the sources observed by them only account for 3% of the total emission of the cxb in the 210 kev band . moreover , for the hard x - ray background , there is a problem called the spectral paradox : bright agns observed with _ heao1 _ , _ exosat _ and _ ginga _  have spectra with an average photon index @xmath15 of 1.7@xmath191.9 ( e.g. , turner and pounds 1989 ; williams _ et al . _",
    "1992 ) , which is significantly softer than that of the cxb itself , and hence , can not be responsible for the total cxb emission .",
    "the spectra of these bright agns are consistent with the spectrum of the cxb fluctuation observed with _ ginga _ , which shows @xmath15 = 1.8@xmath90.1 in the 210 kev range ( hayashida , inoue , & kii 1990 ; butcher _ et al . _",
    "1997 ) . besides the spectral paradox ,",
    "a discrepancy of source counts between the soft and hard energy bands has been noticed ( e.g. , fabian & barcons 1992 ) . the normalization of the log @xmath6 - log @xmath7 relation  in the 210 kev band obtained by the fluctuation analysis with _ heao1 _  ( shafer and fabian 1983 ) and _ ginga _  ( butcher _ et al . _",
    "1997 ) is about 2 times larger than that obtained with the _ einstein _  medium sensitivity survey ( mss ) in the 0.33.5 kev band ( gioia _ et al . _  1984 ; 1990",
    ") , if we convert the flux assuming a photon index of @xmath20 .",
    "in order to study the nature of the x - ray source population over the 0.710 kev band , and to solve these unresolved problems on the cxb origin , we performed an unbiased imaging sky survey with the _ asca_satellite ( large sky survey : lss ; ueda 1996 ; inoue _ et al . _",
    "_ asca _  ( tanaka , inoue , & holt 1994 ) , carrying four identical x - ray telescopes ( xrt ; serlemitsos _ et al . _",
    "1995 ) coupled to two solid - state imaging spectrometers ( sis ; burke _ et al . _  1991",
    "; yamashita _ et al . _",
    "1997 ) , and two gas imaging spectrometers ( gis ; ohashi _ et al . _",
    "1996 ; makishima _ et al._1996 ) as focal plane detectors , is the first imaging satellite capable of study of the x - ray band above 2 kev with a sensitivity up to several @xmath21 erg s@xmath4 @xmath5  ( 210 kev ) .",
    "it also covers the wide energy band from 0.5 to 10 kev , which allows us to directly compare results of the energy bands below and above 2 kev with single detectors , hence accompanied with much less uncertainties than previous studies .",
    "the first results from the lss focusing on the 210 kev band data are reported by ueda _",
    "et al._(1998 ) .    in this paper , we present the details of the analysis and the results , derived utilizing the whole data over the 0.710 kev band . in section  2 , we summarize observations and data reduction . in section  3 , we describe analysis methods and results .",
    "a complete x - ray source list in the lss field is presented . in section  4 ,",
    "we evaluate possible systematic errors in our results , based on studies by monte carlo simulations . in section  5 ,",
    "log @xmath6 - log @xmath7 relations are derived in three survey bands ( 0.77 kev , 210 kev and 0.72 kev ) . in section  6 ,",
    "we discuss implication of the results .",
    "the survey field of the lss is a continuous region near the north galactic pole , centered at @xmath22(2000 ) = 13@xmath2314@xmath24 , @xmath25(2000)=31@xmath26 .",
    "we had no bias in selecting this field except that we avoided bright x - ray sources with a flux greater than @xmath18 erg s@xmath4 @xmath5  ( 210 kev ) in the major x - ray source catalogs in order to minimize complexity in the analysis that would be induced by bright sources .",
    "the galactic neutral hydrogen column density toward the lss field is @xmath27 @xmath5 , which is sufficiently low to study extra - galactic sources above 0.7 kev .",
    "the observation log of the lss is summarized in table  1 .",
    "seventy - six pointings have been made in total ( 16 pointings in dec .",
    "1993 and jan .",
    "1994 , 20 pointings in june 1994 , 20 pointings in dec .",
    "1994 and jan .",
    "1995 , and 20 pointings in june / july 1995 ) with a typical exposure of 10 ksec per pointing . shifting the pointing positions by the half size of the sis fov in sequence , we observed each sky point twice with the sis so that the sum of field of views ( fovs ) of the sis ( @xmath28 ) covered the survey area continuously with good overlaps .",
    "this operation makes the sensitivity limits quite uniform over the entire field .",
    "the total sky area observed with the gis and sis amounts to 7.0 deg@xmath0 , and 5.4 deg@xmath0 , respectively .",
    "the mean exposure time per point is 56 ksec ( sum of gis2 and gis3 ) , and 23 ksec ( sum of sis0 and sis1 ) after data screening .      since the lss observations consist of many pointings , we created images in the sky coordinate system ( gotthelf 1996 ) to be superposed on a common coordinate system for all the data .",
    "photons were accumulated in the different energy bands of 0.77 kev , 27 kev , and 0.72 kev for the sis , and 0.77 kev , 210 kev , 0.77 kev , 24 kev , and 410 kev for the gis so that we can get the spectral information from energy - dependent image analysis .",
    "we did not use energies below 0.7 kev , nor energies above 10 kev ( 7 kev for the sis ) , because the contamination by the non x - ray background ( nxb ) is high relative to x - ray events ( e.g. , kubo _ et al . _",
    "we utilized as much data as possible , so that the signal to noise ( s / n ) ratio should be optimized for faint source detection ( ueda 1996 ) .",
    "we discarded data of the outer part of the gis images with a radius larger than 18@xmath29 from the optical axis , which are not suitable for study of faint sources because ( 1 ) the nxb rate is high ( kubo _ et al . _",
    "1994 ) , ( 2 ) those data are greatly affected by the stray light from the cxb outside the fov ( ishisaki 1996 ) , and ( 3 ) the point spread function ( psf ) of the xrt have not been directly measured through the observations of cyg x-1 ( takahashi _ et al . _",
    "1995 ) .",
    "the nominal error of the attitude solution of _ asca _  is about 1 arcmin ( gotthelf 1995 ) , and arises from the mis - alignment between the focal plane detectors and attitudes sensors ( ueda _ et al._1999 ) .",
    "the error depends on the temperature of the satellite base - plate . in our analysis",
    "we corrected for this error when converting from the detector coordinate to the sky coordinate , using the onboard house - keeping data according to the method described in ueda _",
    "et al . _  ( 1999 ) .",
    "this reduces the systematic positional error , due to the absolute attitude error , to 0.5 arcmin in radius ( 90% confidence level ) .",
    "consequently , we could greatly improve the quality of images superposed from the multi pointings with different orbit conditions of the satellite .",
    "the final position uncertainties , which contain statistical errors , are evaluated in the next section .",
    "extremely careful analysis is required to study faint sources with _ asca_. first , the psf of the xrt has a large scattering tail , which affects flux determination of a faint source near a brighter one .",
    "the psf itself strongly depends on the position of the detector as well as photon energy ( serlemitsos _ et al . _",
    "the background , consisting of the cxb and the nxb , also depends on the position and energy .",
    "it should be noted that the intensity of the nxb can fluctuate by a factor of 1020% from pointing to pointing ( ishisaki _ et al . _",
    "furthermore , there is a grid support on the gis detector ( ohashi _ et al . _  1996 ) , which should be taken into account in calculating fluxes of sources falling near its structure",
    ". under these conditions",
    ", we must pay attention so that real sources are found completely but statistical fluctuations are not picked up .",
    "also , we should be very careful in determining fluxes of faint sources , which are highly sensitive to background subtraction under the low s / n ratio .    to overcome these difficulties in analysis of _ asca",
    "_  data , we developed a new source - detection method ( ishisaki _ et al . _",
    "1995 ; ueda 1996 ; takahashi _ et al . _",
    "1998 ) . in this procedure",
    "we take fully account of the complicated detector responses , such as the position - dependent psf , the background , the vignetting of the xrt , and the grid shadows of the gis .",
    "the procedure consists of two steps : ( step  i ) detection of source candidates and ( step  ii ) calculation of their statistical significances and fluxes .",
    "a source candidate whose significance exceeds a certain threshold is regarded as a detected source . in each step",
    "we treat data of the gis and the sis separately .",
    "finally , their results are combined to improve statistics .      in step",
    "i , we smooth the raw image (= the image in the sky coordinate in the photon counts space ) in order to effectively detect even faint sources",
    ". however , a simple convolution of the image data with an axisymmetric , position - independent smoothing kernel would not be sufficient , because the psf depends strongly on the position of the source in the focal plane of the xrt .",
    "noticeably , the psf elongates toward the azimuthal direction and squeezed in the radial direction if the point source is off the optical axis of the xrt ( e.g. , takahashi _ et al . _",
    "we therefore smooth the images by cross correlating with position - dependent psfs in detector coordinates , which are converted from the sky coordinates with information from the satellite attitude .",
    "the cross correlation function ( ccf ) is calculated as : @xmath30 where @xmath31 represents positional coordinate , @xmath32 is the raw image , and @xmath33 is the psf intensity at @xmath34 with peak at @xmath35 . in calculating the ccf ,",
    "proper modeling of the psf is very important . for the gis",
    ", we adopted a synthetic psf modeled as a two dimensional gaussian function squeezed in the radial direction as a function of the offset angle ( ishisaki _ et al . _",
    "for the sis , we used the ray - tracing program ( tsusaka _ et al . _",
    "1995 ) to reproduce the psf at any position in the focal plane .    since the brightness profile of the background ( cxb + nxb ) peaks around the optical axis and decreased to about 50% at the edge of the gis fov ( kubo _ et al . _  1994",
    "; ueda 1996 ) , it becomes harder to detect sources located at larger radii .",
    "hence , we subtract the background from the raw image before smoothing the gis image .",
    "the background model is produced by the superposition of 109 pointings onto blank skies whose total exposure amounts to about 1 msec . on the other hand",
    ", we neglect this process for sis data because the position dependence of the background is much smaller due to its narrower fov .    after smoothing the raw images separately for each sensor and pointing , we superpose all the smoothed images into a single image with a larger size . finally , we correct it for the exposure by dividing with a superposed exposure map that are smoothed in the same way .",
    "figure  1 shows a contour map of the gis image in the 0.77 kev band thus created .",
    "next , we perform detection of source candidates from the smoothed ( and exposure - corrected ) image created above .",
    "since a point source appear as a cluster of pixels having high counting rates in the smoothed image , source candidates are picked up if the highest pixel in the cluster exceeds some threshold level .",
    "the level is varied from a high to a low level continuously and a newly appeared cluster is added to the source - candidate list .",
    "this makes it possible to find all faint sources completely even when brighter sources are located around them .",
    "the list of the identified clusters is used as inputs for the fitting process in step  ii .",
    "the position of the highest pixel in each cluster gives the source position .      in step",
    "ii we evaluate the statistical significances of the candidate sources , and calculate their fluxes .",
    "the analysis is performed using two - dimensional fitting to the raw image in the photon count space , superposed from the multi pointings .",
    "an advantage of this method is that we can determine the local background level , which is otherwise difficult to estimate with enough accuracy to determine correct fluxes of faint sources , from the observed image itself .",
    "we apply various corrections , such as exposure and vignetting , to the model function , not to the data .",
    "the fitting model is basically a sum of the background image , and the psfs at the location of the source candidates . to reproduce the superposed sky image in the model calculation , we sum up contributions of psf and background from different pointings weighted with exposures .",
    "the intensities of the sources and the background are free parameters to be determined through the fitting .",
    "the source positions are fixed to the values determined from the smoothed image in step  i. due to the vignetting of the xrt , an observed count rate from a source with a given flux decreases as the offset angle from the optical axis becomes larger ( serlemitsos _ et al . _",
    "1995 ) . to derive an intensity of a source , we correct for this effect in the model calculation , so that we should obtain the count rate when the source is observed at a reference position in the focal plane .",
    "the reference position is taken to be a 8.5 arcmin ( 7 arcmin for the sis ) off axis position , and the count rate is defined as that integrated within a radius of 6.0 mm ( corresponding to about 5.9 arcmin ) for the gis and 4.0 mm ( about 3.9 arcmin ) for the sis .",
    "these vignetting correction factors are calculated from the xrt response , which is well calibrated using the crab observations , as described in appendix  a. for the gis , source peaks are modeled by the real psfs obtained from the cyg x-1 observations ( takahashi _ et al . _  1995",
    "; ikebe _ et al . _",
    "1997 ) , and the background is from the same model , as used in step  i ( superposition of real images of blank skies ) . for the sis ,",
    "the psf and the cxb are reproduced by the ray - tracing program , and the nxb is modeled using the night - earth data ( ueda 1996 ) .",
    "the systematic errors in the psf models are estimated to be 5% and 15% for the gis ( takahashi _ et al . _",
    "1995 ) , and the sis ( kunieda _ et al . _",
    "1995 ) , respectively , and are taken into account in the fitting process .",
    "finally , the transmission map of the grid support is multiplied to the component of sources ( psfs ) for the model of the gis .",
    "since the shape of the psf and the vignetting correction factor depend also on energy , we need to assume a spectrum of a source in the model calculation .",
    "we adopted a power law with a photon index of 1.7 as a typical spectrum .",
    "the dependences of the psf and the vignetting correction factor on the assumed spectrum are negligible within a reasonable region of the photon index ( the difference of the vignetting correction factor between @xmath36 is less than a few percent ) .",
    "since the number of photons in one bin of the image is small , we use poisson maximum likelihood statistics to find the best fit parameters .",
    "the maximum likelihood function is defined as : @xmath37 where @xmath38 represents the position of the bin , @xmath39 is the model , and @xmath40 is the data .",
    "the sum is taken over the region used in the fitting . in this statistics ,",
    "1 @xmath41 statistical error of one parameter is defined as a deviation from the best fit value , when the likelihood decreased by 0.5 from its maximum .",
    "the significance of detection is defined as @xmath42 @xmath43 .",
    "for the fitting to converge correctly , the free parameters , namely normalization of the background and those of peaks , are determined one by one in the fitting process .",
    "we first fit the image only with the background component ( cxb + nxb ) to determine the background level .",
    "next , taking the background determined in this way , we determine the flux of the brightest source .",
    "after the flux is obtained , this is then frozen and the process is repeated for the next source . once all the detected source candidates are fitted , the parameters including the normalization of background are allowed to float , producing final parameters .",
    "thus , any statistical coupling between the free parameters are taken into account . in the procedure",
    ", we do not treat all fields of the lss simultaneously .",
    "instead , we divided the entire image into small regions ( @xmath44 for the gis and @xmath45 for the sis ) so that the number of sources becomes appropriate ( @xmath1329 ) for one fitting process . to take into account the psf tails from sources in outer region of the selected area",
    ", we fit the image of larger size with some margins ( @xmath46 for the gis , and @xmath47 for the sis ) when determining the flux of sources within the selected area .",
    "we did not use data of a rectangular region surrounded by four corners , @xmath48 = ( 13@xmath2319@xmath245@xmath49 , 33@xmath50 ) , ( 13@xmath2320@xmath2415@xmath49 , 32@xmath51 ) , ( 13@xmath2321@xmath243@xmath49 , 33@xmath52 ) , and ( 13@xmath2319@xmath2452@xmath49 , 33@xmath53 ) , to avoid systematic errors due to a bright extended source located there .      first , we applied the methods described above to the combined image of the lss field separately for the gis and the sis in three energy bands : the total band ( 0.77 kev ) , the hard band ( 210 kev ; 27 kev for sis ) , and the soft band ( 0.72 kev ) .",
    "we thus obtained 6 preliminary source lists . at this stage",
    "we adopted relatively loose detection criteria ( above 3.2 @xmath41 ) in selecting sources .",
    "we then merged the three source lists in different bands to one list for each detector . due to statistical fluctuation",
    ", the detected positions of a source can differ with energy bands . here , we regarded any pair of sources detected in different energy bands as identical , if their positions coincide within 1.5 arcmin ( 1 arcmin for the sis ) .",
    "these criteria are reasonable , considering the position accuracy of each detector .",
    "we adopted the position determined in the energy band in which the maximum significance was obtained .",
    "finally , we combined the gis list and the sis list , regarding sources detected with different detectors within a distance of 1.5 arcmin as identical sources .",
    "we adopted the positions determined by the sis data , taking advantage of its superior positional resolution ( hence better position accuracy ) , except for those located out of the combined sis fovs .",
    "because the psf of the xrt measured with the sis has a sharp core , we can resolve neighboring sources whose angular separation is as small as 1 arcmin .    using the combined source list as inputs of source candidates",
    ", we repeated step  ii in each energy band .",
    "finally , we adopted the following criteria for detection : ( 1 ) the significance of summed count rate of the gis and the sis ( @xmath54 ) should exceed 4.5 , and ( 2 ) the significance of either the gis or the sis ( @xmath55 or @xmath56 ) should also exceed 3.5 .",
    "studies based on monte carlo simulations justify the validity of setting these criteria , as described below . using @xmath54",
    ", the combination of two significances measured with independent detectors , considerably reduces contamination by fake sources ( statistical fluctuation ) , since real sources are expected to be commonly detected with both the gis and the sis , while fake sources are not .    with these criteria",
    ", we detected 105 , 44 , and 72 sources , in the total , the hard , and the soft energy bands , respectively .",
    "the total number of sources is 107 .",
    "the number of sources detected both in two energy bands ( or only in one band ) is summarized in table  2 .",
    "table  3 gives the complete source list in the lss field with their positions , significances , and vignetting - corrected count rates in the three energy bands .",
    "note that the gis count rate of 1 c ksec@xmath4 in each energy band corresponds to a flux of @xmath57 ( 0.77 kev ) , @xmath58 ( 210 kev ) , @xmath59 ( 0.72 kev ) erg s@xmath4 @xmath5  , respectively , for a power - law spectrum with a photon index of 1.7 .",
    "all the fluxes in this paper are corrected for the galactic absorption ( @xmath60 @xmath5 ) to give unabsorbed fluxes . in table  4",
    ", we list the conversion factors from the count rate to flux for several photon indices assumed .",
    "spectral properties of these faint sources are of particular interest in discussing the origin of the cxb .",
    "the count rates of the hard and the soft bands already contain information of the spectrum for each source . to derive more information , particularly spectra within the 210 kev range , we repeated the image fitting procedure ( step  ii ) in finer energy bands ( 24 kev and 410 kev ) for the gis data .",
    "then , we produced spectra for each source in two energy bands for the sis ( 0.72 and 27 kev ) , and in three energy bands ( 0.72 , 24 , and 410 kev ) for the gis .",
    "for each source , we fitted the gis and the sis spectra simultaneously , assuming a power law with an absorption fixed at the galactic column density of @xmath61 = @xmath62 @xmath5 . in the spectral fitting",
    ", we used an auxiliary response function ( arf ) , constructed for a point source located at the reference position defined above , where the obtained count rate is normalized .",
    "the best - fit power law indices obtained are given in a column of table  3 , with 1@xmath41 statistical errors .",
    "figure  2 shows a correlation between a flux and a photon index determined in the 0.710 kev range . in the figure , the flux ( 0.77 kev )",
    "is converted from the gis count rate in the 0.77 kev band , assuming a photon index of 1.6 ( an average index for a faint source sample ; see below ) .    in order to see the statistical properties of these sources , we next made average spectra of sources for the three survey bands ( the total , hard , and soft band ) by summing up the spectrum of individual sources .",
    "since this operation corresponds to calculating a flux - weighted average , very bright sources dominate the signal and significantly affect the result .",
    "to study the property of faint sources , we therefore use flux - limited samples for each survey band : sources with fluxes ( in units of erg s@xmath4 @xmath5 ) of @xmath63 ( 0.77 kev ) detected in the total band , those with fluxes of @xmath64 ( 210 kev ) detected in the hard band , and those with fluxes of @xmath65 ( 0.72 kev ) detected in the soft band .",
    "we hereafter refer to them as the total - band sample , the hard - band sample , and the soft - band sample , each of which consists of 74 , 36 , and 64 sources , respectively .",
    "we fitted these average spectra with a power law with the galactic absorption . since the sis spectra do not cover the energy band above 7 kev , we here use only the gis spectrum to make the statistical weight uniform over the entire 0.710 kev range .",
    "the spectral fit is performed in two energy ranges : 0.710 kev band consisting of three bins ( 0.72 , 24 , and 410 kev ) and 210 kev band consisting of two bins ( 24 and 410 kev ) .",
    "the fitting results are summarized in table  5 .",
    "we obtained an average photon index of @xmath66 ( 1@xmath41 statistical error ) in the 0.710 kev range for the total - band sample .",
    "the 210 kev photon indices are 1.63@xmath90.18 , 1.49@xmath90.10 , and 1.85@xmath90.22 for the total , the hard , and the soft band sample , respectively ( the 210 kev index of the hard band sample is not exactly same as the value reported in ueda _",
    "et al . _  ( 1998 ) because of inclusion of @xmath56 in the detection criteria ) .",
    "it should be noted that the average spectrum in the 0.710 kev band for the hard - band sample ( or the soft - band sample ) is subject to a statistical bias in the sense that average spectrum of the hard- ( soft- ) band sample tends to show a harder ( softer ) spectrum than in reality : if sources are selected based on significances only in the hard ( soft ) band , there should be a sampling effect that a sample selectively contains sources whose `` observed '' spectra in the 0.710 kev band are hard ( soft ) merely due to statistical fluctuation .",
    "hence , the two values in parenthesis in table  5 should not be considered to reflect a real property , without correcting for these biases . on the other hand ,",
    "no such bias exists , when we discuss a spectral property in the 210 kev range for all the samples .",
    "here we evaluate systematic errors in the obtained fluxes and spectra . in general",
    ", systematic errors can be divided into two categories . in the first category are errors caused by the calibration uncertainty .",
    "appendix  a evaluates this error in detail . the uncertainty in the absolute photometry of _ asca _  is conservatively estimated at 10% .",
    "the error in the relative flux is estimated to be 8% for an individual source , and is much smaller for an average of many sources .",
    "note that this error is smaller than the statistical error for a faint source detected with a significance less than 12@xmath41 ( 1/12 @xmath12 8% ) . in the second category are errors associated with the improper analysis method or those inevitably caused by principles ( such as the source confusion ) , which remain , even if we fully understand the response functions of instruments .    to begin with",
    ", we compared the fluxes obtained from the gis and the sis to check the consistency within our data .",
    "we have 71 sources detected with both the gis and the sis above 3.5@xmath41 ( and @xmath67 ) in the total band .",
    "figure  3 shows a comparison in the form of a scatter - plot between the fluxes obtained with the sis and the gis for this sample . since the spectrum of an individual source at faint flux levels includes a large statistical error , we assumed a photon index of 1.6 for all sources to convert a count rate to a flux .",
    "as shown in the figure , we found a good correlation between the gis and the sis fluxes .",
    "studies by monte carlo simulation are indispensable to check systematic errors of the second category , which are otherwise difficult to evaluate .",
    "we developed an instrument simulator that simulates the response of _ asca _  ( hirayama _ et al .",
    "_  in preparation ; an example of analysis utilizing it is given in ikebe _",
    "et al . _",
    "the complicated responses of the instruments , in terms of psf , vignetting , grid shadow of the gis , etc , are taken into account in the simulator .",
    "the simulator produces a photon - event list from the input sky image and spectrum , according to the probability distribution in the responses , which are well calibrated ( appendix  a ) .    to simulate the lss data , we generated photon - event lists with the same conditions ( such as exposure and satellite attitude ) as the lss observations .",
    "sky images were created according to the log @xmath6 - log @xmath7 relation  obtained by ueda _",
    "et al . _  ( 1998 ) , assuming that it extends towards a lower flux level with a function of @xmath68 , until the whole intensity of the cxb is explained by integral of sources . for simplicity ,",
    "all the sources are assumed to have a single spectrum regardless of the flux level : a power law with a photon index of 1.7 over the full energy range ( 0.710 kev ) .",
    "the nxb was added based on the night earth data , and we fluctuated its intensity from pointing to pointing by a factor of 10% , considering the uncertainties in the modeling of the nxb ( ishisaki _ et al . _  1997 ) .",
    "we then analyzed the simulated data obtained in this way , and applied our source finding procedure in exactly the same manner as for the real data . to reduce the statistical fluctuation in the simulated result , we ran the simulations several times , with a corresponding exposure of 23 msec in total .    figure  4(a ) shows a comparison of the calculated flux with the input flux for these simulated data . here",
    ", we define the input flux as the flux of the brightest source within a 1 arcmin radius around the detected position , considering the angular resolution of the psf .",
    "as noticed from the figure , we obtain a good agreement between input and output flux in general , although there is a tendency for the observed fluxes to become larger than the input ones , when the flux is below @xmath69 erg s@xmath4 @xmath5  ( 0.77 kev ) .",
    "this can be attributed to two effects .",
    "one is the bias due to the statistical fluctuation of photon numbers : we selectively detect sources whose output fluxes are larger than the input fluxes around the sensitivity limit , because the significance is determined by an output flux ( i.e. , observed count rate ) rather than by an input flux .",
    "the second effect is the source confusion by nearby sources : the observed flux contains all the integrated flux from sources that can not be resolved around the detected position .",
    "figure  4(b ) shows a histogram of the ratio of the input flux to the output flux . in the same figure",
    ", we also show a similar histogram , marked with a dashed line , for the case when we define the input flux as an integrated ( not the brightest ) flux within a radius of 1 arcmin around the detected position .",
    "as expected , the ratio ( input / output ) becomes systematically larger for the latter definition .",
    "the difference of the mean value between these two histograms quantitatively gives the effect of the source confusion .",
    "we thus estimate the contamination by nearby sources in the observed flux to be about 10% on average .",
    "this means that effects due to the source confusion are not serious in our analysis , since the number density of the detected sources , derived below ( @xmath12 1020 deg@xmath70 ) , is small enough compared with the confusion limit determined by the beam size ( @xmath12 1 arcmin ) .    from figure",
    "4 , it can be seen that there are several sources detected with an extremely high flux , relative to the input flux .",
    "these are considered to be not real sources but `` fake '' sources , produced by the statistical fluctuation of the background .",
    "we estimate the fraction of fake sources to be at most a few percent in the overall detections . in other words , the probability to pick up a fake source by our source finding method is about @xmath12 0.5 deg@xmath70 with the detection criteria we adopted in this paper ( 4.5@xmath41 ) .",
    "we also check the accuracy of the output spectra . from a scatter plot between a photon index and a flux obtained for the simulated data",
    ", we confirmed that the output photon index scatter around the input value ( 1.7 ) and there is no significant systematic change with respect to the flux level .",
    "we also verified that the summed spectra for the flux - limited samples , defined above , are consistent with the input spectrum within a statistical error .",
    "these results confirm the validity of the spectrum determination by our analysis method .",
    "the source position in the source list contains ( i ) an error arising from the uncertainty of the absolute attitude solution , ( ii ) a statistical error due to limited number of photons , and ( iii ) a systematic error caused by source confusion .",
    "as described earlier , the first term is evaluated to be 0.5 arcmin in radius ( 90% confidence level ) . to evaluate the combined error of the remaining two",
    ", we again analyze the simulated data .",
    "figure  4(c ) shows a histogram of angular distance between the detected position , and the position of the brightest source within a 1 arcmin radius , which should be taken as a real counterpart . according to this histogram",
    ", the error comes out to be 0.6 arcmin ( 90% confidence level ) .",
    "when limiting for sources that are detected also in the hard ( or the soft ) band with significances above 4.5@xmath41 , we found the error reduces to 0.4 arcmin .",
    "hence , taking a root sum square of all possible errors , we estimate the final positional error to be 0.60.8 arcmin in radius ( 90% ) , depending on the detection significance .",
    "to improve it further , observations with the _ rosat _  hri are ongoing .",
    "the log @xmath6 - log @xmath7 relation  ( number - flux relation ; @xmath71 in the differential form and @xmath72 in the integral form ) is the most fundamental measure which directly describes the contribution of individual sources to the cxb . to derive the log @xmath6 - log @xmath7 relation ,",
    "it is necessary to calculate the survey area , @xmath73 , as a function of flux @xmath7 , or in other words , to determine the sensitivity limits over the entire survey field .",
    "the sensitivity limits depend on parameters such as exposure , effective area ( vignetting ) , the background level , and the shape of the psf .",
    "it is not an easy task , however , to compute it by an analytic formula due to the following reasons : ( 1 ) the image is composed of multiple pointings , and the above parameters are different from position to position .",
    "( 2 ) our source - finding method is based on image fitting , and thus the estimates of the sensitivity limits are not trivial .    to estimate the detection significance for a given flux at any position in the survey field",
    ", we utilized the model function used in the source finding procedure .",
    "we first compute an image model around the source position , which consists of a point source with the given flux and the background .",
    "then we fit the computed image with the same model function , varying the flux of the source as a free parameter . using the same principle in the fitting process given in section  3.2",
    ", we can derive the statistical error of the flux , thus the significance of detection , expected for the given flux .",
    "we confirmed the validity of this method by comparing the result with a more realistic simulation , in which the number of photons fluctuates according to poissonian statistics .",
    "this procedure is repeated for several different fluxes , as to determine the sensitivity limits over the entire field for given detection criteria , which thus enables us to compute @xmath74 . in practice , we define @xmath7 as a count rate ( corrected for the vignetting ) rather than as a flux , because the detection significance is simply extracted from a count rate .",
    "we compute @xmath74 separately for the gis and the sis , because the ratio of count rates between the gis and the sis depends on the source spectrum , which makes it difficult to combine the two results .",
    "thus , when deriving @xmath74 , and hence the log @xmath6 - log @xmath7 relation , we adopted the following detection criteria applied separately to the gis or the sis : ( 1 ) @xmath55 @xmath75 ( @xmath56 @xmath75 for the sis ) , and ( 2 ) @xmath54 @xmath75 .",
    "note that the criteria are different from those adopted in making the source list ( section  3.3 ) .",
    "the second condition is added just to reduce the fraction of fake sources .",
    "figure  5(a ) shows results for @xmath74 computed for the three survey bands .",
    "the gis achieves higher sensitivity than the sis in the hard band , while the sis achieves higher sensitivities in the total and the soft bands , as is expected from the energy dependence of their detection efficiencies .",
    "the number of sources detected with the same detection criteria per unit logarithmic flux range are plotted in figure  5(b ) . dividing these numbers by @xmath74 , we can derive `` observed '' log @xmath6 - log @xmath7 relation , @xmath71 , in the differential form . in plotting figure  5 , we coverted the count rate to flux assuming a photon index of 1.6 ( 0.77 kev ) , 1.5 ( 210 kev ) , and 1.9 ( 0.72 kev ) .      from the lss",
    ", we determined the log @xmath6 - log @xmath7 relation  by direct source counts in the three survey bands , 0.77 kev , 210 kev , and 0.72 kev .",
    "these results were obtained by the careful analysis based on extensive instrumental calibration and detailed simulation studies . in the 0.77 kev band , where the sensitivity is optimized for most of sources except for very soft or hard sources , we found that the log @xmath6 - log @xmath7 relationis well represented by @xmath72 @xmath86 @xmath87 over a wide flux range from @xmath88 to @xmath89 erg s@xmath4 @xmath5  ( 0.77 kev ) .",
    "as already reported in ueda _",
    "et al . _  ( 1998 ) , the 210 kev log @xmath6 - log @xmath7 relation  lies on the extrapolation from the previous results by _ heao1 _  a2 ( piccinotti _ et al . _  1982",
    ") and _ ginga _",
    "( kondo _ et al . _",
    "1992 ) with a euclidean slope of @xmath8 .",
    "the result is consistent with the fluctuation analysis by asca ( gendreau , barcons , & fabian 1998 ) .    to compare our results in the 0.72 kev band with previous studies , we superpose the log @xmath6 - log @xmath7 relation  obtained by _ rosat _  ( hasinger 1998 ) on our results in figure  7 ( c ) .",
    "here we convert the flux from 0.52 kev to 0.72 kev assuming a photon index of 1.9 . as shown in the figure , our results are consistent with the _ rosat _  results ( and also with _ einstein _",
    "results ; see primini _ et al . _",
    "1991 ) within statistical error , although we find a discrepancy that the _ asca _  source counts is slightly higher by @xmath90 .    there could be two explanations for this discrepancy .",
    "one is due to the calibration uncertainty in the flux ( appendix  a ) .",
    "in addition to the uncertainty of the absolute photometry ( @xmath1210% ) , the low energy response of the _ asca _  has an uncertainty of @xmath91 @xmath5 in a neutral hydrogen column density , which could produce an error of @xmath125% in the 0.72 kev flux .",
    "note that a systematic error of 10% in the flux leads to @xmath1215% apparent difference in the source counts .",
    "the other explanation could be attributed to the nature of the detected sources .",
    "even though _ asca _  and _ rosat _  cover the common energy band of 0.72 kev , the `` effective '' band at which detection efficiency is maximized is different : the _ asca _  gis / sis has better detection efficiency toward higher energy in the 0.72 kev range ( e.g. , ohashi _ et al . _",
    "1996 ) , while the _ rosat _  pspc has a peak efficiency around 1 kev ( pfeffermann _ et al . _",
    "1986 ) and also covers the energy range below 0.7 kev . if some fraction of sources has hard energy spectra in the 0.72 kev range ( e.g. , absorbed spectra ) , they are more easily detected with _",
    "asca _  than _",
    "rosat_. for example , if half sources in the soft - band sample have absorbed spectra with @xmath92 @xmath5 with a photon index of 2.2 and the other sources are unabsorbed , discrepancy of @xmath1210% in the source counts can be produced , if we simply take a photon index of 1.9 in the flux conversion between _ rosat _  and _ asca _  assuming a single population .",
    "the resolved fraction of the cxb depends on the absolute intensity of the cxb emission , which can be different by about 20% in the literature ( e.g. , marshall _ et al . _  1980",

    "that this 210 kev flux is larger by 23% than the result by marshall _",

    "the error ( 10% ) shows the systematic error due to uncertainty of the evaluation of the stray light in the analysis of the cxb spectrum ( ishisaki _ et al . _",
    "the log @xmath6 - log @xmath7 relations obtained in this paper indicate that @xmath95% of the cxb has been directly resolved into discrete sources with a sensitivity limit of @xmath96 erg s@xmath4 @xmath5  in the 0.77 kev band , and @xmath97% with a sensitivity limit of @xmath98 erg s@xmath4 @xmath5  in the 210 kev band .",
    "the attached error merely comes from the uncertainty of the cxb intensity described above .",
    "the `` observed '' log @xmath6 - log @xmath7 relations are , however , considered to be subject to some biases .",
    "they include ( 1 ) bias induced by the statistical fluctuation of the measured flux ( eddington s bias ) , ( 2 ) effect of the source confusion , ( 3 ) inefficiency of the source detection , and ( 4 ) contamination by fake sources .",
    "again , monte carlo simulations are the most powerful mean to estimate these biases . using the set of simulated data created in section  4 , we calculated @xmath74 and derived the log @xmath6 - log @xmath7 relation  in the same manner as for the real data .",
    "figure  6 show the results of integral log @xmath6 - log @xmath7 relations derived from the simulated data .",
    "the faintest points in the total and the soft band are determined mainly by the sis , while those in the hard band are determined by the gis .",
    "the input log @xmath6 - log @xmath7 relation  is plotted by a dashed line in the same figure .",
    "as noticed , the results of the simulation are almost consistent with the input parameters , although week systematic deviations can be found .",

    "the reason why this deviation is seen only in the soft band can be explained in terms of the source confusion , since the positional resolution of the gis becomes worse for lower energy ( ohashi _ et al . _",
    "1996 ) and the effect should be most significant in the soft energy band .",
    "finally , we derived log @xmath6 - log @xmath7 relations from the real data correcting for these biases . from the simulation",
    ", we found an empirical formula can be applied to correct them , by scaling the `` observed '' integral log @xmath6 - log @xmath7 relation , @xmath72 , by a flux - dependent factor , @xmath77 , which is defined as : @xmath78\\\\ ( { \\rm for\\ ; }",

    "previously , this kind of comparison has been made , based on results of different satellites ( such as _ ginga _  and _ einstein _ ) , which could be subject to uncertainty in the mutual calibration between different instruments . since _ asca _  covers the energy bands above and below 2 kev with single detectors , we can now discuss it with much less uncertainties than in previous studies .",

    "et al . _  ( 1995 ) , the fraction of type - ii agns in the total source counts is about 4050% at a flux of @xmath10 erg s@xmath4 @xmath5  ( 210 kev )",
    ". to connect this prediction with our results , however",
    ", we must correct for the difference of flux limits for type - i and type - ii agns that have different spectra .",
    "just to see this effect , we assume a photon index of 1.7 for type - i agn and 1.0 for type - ii agn in the 210 kev range .",
    "then the flux limit for type - ii agns is brighter than type - i agns by about 20% ( table  4 ) , which corresponds to a factor of 30% in the integral source counts assuming a slope of @xmath8 .",
    "thus , the fraction of type - ii agns in the lss hard - band sample is predicted to be 3040% . at present , this is consistent with our estimate , and with the optical identifications , considering uncertainty in the several assumptions we have made .",
    "a more detailed study using the optical results will be presented elsewhere .",
    "we presented a complete source list , containing 107 sources from the three survey bands of 0.77 kev , 210 kev , and 0.72 kev , in the lss field .",
    "based on extensive calibration and simulation study , the results are carefully verified .",
    "we derived the log @xmath6 - log @xmath7 relations in each survey band with a flux range of @xmath1 to @xmath110 erg s@xmath4 @xmath5  ( 0.77 kev ) , @xmath2 to @xmath111 erg s@xmath4 @xmath5(210 kev ) , and @xmath112 to @xmath113 erg s@xmath4 @xmath5(0.72 kev ) . at these flux limits ,",
    "30(@xmath114% of the cxb in the 0.77 kev and 23(@xmath115)% in the 210 kev band have been directly resolved into discrete sources .",
    "we found that faint sources around the sensitivity limits show on average a photon index of 1.5 in the 210 kev range , and 1.6 in the 0.710 kev range .",
    "these spectra are harder than a typical spectrum of type - i agns , suggesting that contribution of a population with hard energy spectra becomes significant at a flux level of @xmath76 erg s@xmath4 @xmath5  ( 210 kev ) . with reasonable assumptions ,",
    "the fraction of these hard sources is estimated to be 2060% in the hard band sample .",
    "type - ii agns are good candidates for this population of sources , which is being confirmed by the on - going optical identifications .",
    "we thank members of the lss team and the asca team for their support in planning observations , satellite operation , and data acquisition .",
    "we acknowledge the asca_anl and simasca software development teams for supporting the analysis technique .",

    "calibration of instrument response , including that of the absolute photometry , is crucial in our study , particularly when we make comparisons with other missions . here",
    "we describe the calibration method and evaluate systematic errors in the instrument response used in the paper .",
    "the response of the gis and the xrt has been finally determined by the observations of crab nebula , which is a standard calibration source in x - ray astronomy .",
    "fukazawa , ishida , & ebisawa ( 1997 ) summarize the results of spectral fits for the crab data taken at various positions , using the released gis+xrt responses , which have been tuned especially at the nominal pointing position .",
    "they found a tendency that the observed absolute flux increases as the radius from the optical axis becomes large .",
    "although there is no such tendency in the photon index and the column density , the average column density is @xmath61  @xmath116 @xmath5 , which seems to be somewhat lower than a standard value ( @xmath117 @xmath5 , toor and seward 1974 ) .    to improve the accuracy of the response further",
    ", we corrected it in two practical ways .",
    "first , we scaled the effective area of the xrt by an energy - independent factor given as a function of the radius from the optical axis , with a similar formula described in ishisaki ( 1996 ) .",
    "second , we modified the low energy efficiency so that a larger column density should be obtained by @xmath61  = @xmath118 @xmath5 . note that this operation is not contradictory to previous calibrations , considering the uncertainty in the low energy response ( ueda 1996 ) .",
    "the fluxes from crab obtained with the modified response , used throughout in this paper , are plotted in figure  9 against the radius from the optical axis . as noticed from the figure",
    ", the scatter of the flux is less than 8% , which corresponds to the amount of systematic error in relative fluxes observed at different pointings .",
    "the average parameters obtained are flux = @xmath119 erg s@xmath4 @xmath5  ( 210 kev ) , photon index = 2.08 , and @xmath61  = @xmath120 @xmath5 , all of which are consistent with the standard values ( toor and seward 1974 ) .",
    "however , we conservatively attach 10% error in the absolute flux , considering the scatter of the flux between different satellites ( seward 1992 ) .",
    "similarly , the systematic error in @xmath61is estimated to be @xmath118 @xmath5 , which produces additional 5% uncertainty in the 0.72 kev flux .      the degradation of detection efficiency of the sis , which is prominent in 4 ccd mode , becomes a problem in our study ( dotani _ et al . _",
    "this effect is energy independent to first order . to calibrate it , we examined the change of apparent count rate of the cxb spectra using the lss data taken in different periods , separated by 6 months over 2 years .",
    "since the lss covers a wide area even in one period , the fluctuation of the cxb surface brightness is almost canceled out after we discard fields where extreme bright sources are located .",
    "as expected , we found a clear decrease of the count rate with time .",
    "also , a comparison with the gis data suggests that even at december 1993 , only 10 months after launch , the absolute detection efficiency in the 4 ccd mode degraded to about 80% relative to that in the 1 ccd mode at launch .",
    "we correct this with formula of @xmath121 where @xmath77 is detection efficiency normalized by that in the 1 ccd mode at launch , and @xmath122 is the time in months since the launch . note that this formula can be applied only for a period of @xmath123 .",
    "the good correlation between the gis and sis fluxes in figure  3 demonstrates the validity of this correction within accuracy of 5% .",
