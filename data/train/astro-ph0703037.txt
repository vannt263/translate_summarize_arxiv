    "ukidss is the ukirt infrared deep sky survey @xcite , carried out using the wide field camera ( wfcam ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) installed on the united kingdom infrared telescope ( ukirt ) .",
    "data acquisition for the survey started in 2005 may .",
    "the early data release ( edr ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter d06 ) , a prototype dataset , and the first data release ( dr1 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter w07 ) , the first release of survey - quality data , took place in 2006 .",
    "this paper describes the second data release ( dr2 ) .",
    "the data are available from the wfcam science archive ( wsa ) at http://surveys.roe.ac.uk/wsa .",
    "ukidss is a programme of five imaging surveys that each uses some or all of the broadband filter complement @xmath3 , and that span a range of areas , depths , and galactic latitudes .",
    "there are three high galactic latitude surveys , providing complementary combinations of area and depth ; the large area survey ( las ) , will cover 4000 deg@xmath0 to @xmath1 , the deep extragalactic survey ( dxs ) , 35 deg@xmath0 to @xmath2 , and the ultra deep survey ( uds ) , 0.8 deg@xmath0 to @xmath4 . there are two other wide surveys to @xmath1 , aimed at targets in the milky way ; the galactic plane survey ( gps ) will cover 1900 deg@xmath0 , and the galactic clusters survey ( gcs ) 1100 deg@xmath0 .",
    "the complete ukidss programme is scheduled to take seven years , requiring @xmath51000 nights on ukirt .",
    "the current implementation strategy is focused on completing an intermediate set of goals , defined by the ` 2-year plan ' detailed in d06 .",
    "all magnitudes quoted in this paper use the vega system described by @xcite .",
    "depths , where not explicitly specified , are the total brightness of a point source for which the flux integrated in a @xmath6 diameter aperture is detected at @xmath7 .",
    "a set of five baseline papers provides the relevant technical background information for the surveys .",
    "the overview of the programme is given by @xcite .",
    "this sets out the science goals that drove the design of the survey programme , and details the final coverage that will be achieved , in terms of fields , areas , depths , and filters .",
    "the camera is described in detail by @xcite , and the _ zyjhk _ photometric system is characterised by @xcite , who provide synthetic colours for a wide range of types of star , galaxy , and quasar .",
    "details of the data pipeline and data archive will appear in irwin et al .",
    "( 2007 , in prep . ) and hambly et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , respectively .",
    "each ukidss data release includes the data contained in previous releases , together with new data .",
    "the instrument is scheduled in blocks of time of typically three to six months duration .",
    "current policy is that each observing block results in a data release .",
    "dr1 comprised data from the 2005a and 2005b observing blocks . dr2 includes the relatively short 2006a observing block , which ran over 2006 may to july .",
    "dr3 will be much larger , including the consecutive 2006b and 2007a blocks , running over 2006 november to 2007 may .",
    "each ukidss data release is accompanied by a paper summarising the contents of the release , and detailing procedural changes since the previous release .",
    "the edr provided a small prototype datset , and represented a step towards regular release of survey - quality data.the edr paper , d06 , is a self - contained summary of all information relevant to understanding the contents of the edr .",
    "it also serves as the baseline paper for technical details for all releases . besides a summary of the contents of the edr database , d06 includes relevant details of the camera design , the observational implementation ( integration times , microstepping ) , the pipeline and calibration , data artifacts , and the quality control procedures , as well as a brief guide to querying the archive .",
    "subsequent papers summarise the contents of the particular release , together with a description of changes to the implementation , pipeline , calibration , quality control , and archive procedures .",
    "the dr1 paper , w07 , also included plots summarising the distributions of seeing , sky brightness , and airmass over the dataset .",
    "the present paper covers dr2 .",
    "dr2 includes new data for the las , gps , gcs , and dxs , but not the uds which was unobservable in 2006a .",
    "the uds therefore appears in dr2 in identical form to dr1 .",
    "details concerning the uds may be found in w07 , and no further mention is made here .",
    "dr2 is appeared in two stages .",
    "the first stage , released on 2007 march 1 , was complete except for the gps .",
    "the gps data were released on 2007 april 12 . in section [ update ]",
    "we detail changes between dr1 and dr2 to the pipeline , calibration , and archive procedures . in section [ summary ]",
    "we summarise the contents of dr2 .",
    "d06 contains details of the implementation , pipeline , calibration , quality control , and archive procedures applied to the edr data , and a glossary of technical terms . w07",
    "details changes to these procedures betwen the edr and dr1 . in this section",
    "we detail further changes since dr1 . these include mostly minor changes to the pipeline , calibration , and archive procedures .",
    "the implementation and quality control procedures are virtually unchanged . during 2006a , fields were not observed when the moon was within 30deg , in order to avoid moon ghosts ( d06 , w07 ) .",
    "a baffle was installed after the end of 2006a that appears to have eliminated moon ghosts altogether , and the restriction has been removed for 2006b .        for dr2",
    "all 2005a wfcam data were reprocessed from scratch from the raw data .",
    "the 2005a data were first released in the edr , and were not revised for dr1 .",
    "the main changes in the image processing aspects between edr and dr1 , and used in processing the 2005b data , were an improved sky correction strategy more closely linked to the observing block structure ( msbs ) , and the application of the cross - talk supression algorithm ( w07 ) .",
    "further minor improvements have been made to the sky correction strategy since dr1 .",
    "therefore the 2005a and 2006a data benefit from these improvements .",
    "the 2005b data have not been reprocessed since dr1 however .",
    "further small changes to the cataloguing software , mainly related to improving the object detection filter , have also been made since dr1 and were used in the catalogue ( re)generation for the 2005a data .",
    "all of the new 2006a wfcam data were processed with the latest versions of the pipeline software .",
    "several minor improvements to the photometric calibration procedure have also been implemented since dr1 in an attempt to reduce any dependence of the derived photometric zero - points on galactic coordinates , due to , for example , varying dwarf - giant ratios , extinction and extreme colour objects .",
    "as previously , each frame is calibrated using 2mass stars in the frame , converting the 2mass photometry to the wfcam system using appropriate colour equations .",
    "the zero point for each detector is now provided as the attribute photzpcat in the table multiframedetector . the attribute photzp in the table multiframe has been deprecated .",
    "the updated wfcam calibration uses a restricted ( extinction - corrected ) colour range of @xmath8 ( the subscript @xmath9 standing for 2mass ) to help exclude late - type giants , unusual objects and heavily reddened stars .",
    "also , as a result of discovering a correlation of the derived @xmath10- and @xmath11-band zero points with galactic extinction , particularly in regions of heavy extinction , an extra extinction - dependent calibration term has been included .",
    "the revised colour equations are as follows : + @xmath12 + @xmath13 + @xmath14 + @xmath15 + @xmath16    here @xmath17 is the reddening computed using the prescription of @xcite , from the data of @xcite . the corrections for reddening are small in the _ jhk _ bands and in practice also for the @xmath10 band which is only used in the las where the extinction is low .",
    "the reddening corrections for the _ z _ band , only used in the gcs , are large in fields with large reddening , and should be treated with caution .",
    "the revised colour equations produce a more stable calibration for the @xmath10 and @xmath11 bands ( but generally have little impact on the _ jhk _ calibration ) .",
    "in addition , errors on the individual 2mass - derived zero - points are now included together with measures summarising the photometric quality of the night and the overall nightly average zero - point .",
    "w07 note that there is evidence for an overall zero - point offset with respect to the vega system for the @xmath10 and @xmath11 bands .",
    "an analysis of this issue is deferred to dr3 .              in previous releases",
    "two databases were provided , one containing all the data ( called edr+ , dr1 + ) , and a second , a subset of the larger database , containing data for all fields observed with the full filter complement for the particular survey ( called edr , dr1 ) .",
    "for dr2 there is only one database , dr2 + .",
    "nevertheless _ views _ are provided of the source tables for each survey , e.g. _ lasyjhksource _ in order to provide the equivalent functionality .",
    "a significant improvement over dr1 is the provision of quality error bit flags for each detected source . in the detection tables",
    "the attribute is pperrbits , and in the source tables the appropriate filter name is appended , e.g.  ypperrbits , j@xmath181pperrbits .",
    "the attribute is a 32-bit integer where each bit can be set to 1 to flag up to 32 different quality issues .",
    "the quality issues are ranked in severity , with the more severe issues assigned to higher bits .",
    "currently only five bits are set as follows : bit 4 = the source is the offspring of deblending , bit 6 = a bad pixel exists in the default aperture ( @xmath19 radius ) , bit 16 = the source is likely to contain saturated pixels , bit 19 = the source is likely to be either cross - talk or a real source affected by cross - talk ( see d06 and w07 for details on cross - talk ) , bit 22 = the source is likely to include incomplete data as a consequence of lying close to the frame boundary . therefore by converting pperrbits to binary it is possible to filter out sources with particular quality issues . alternatively a threshold can be set e.g. pperrbits@xmath20 to select sources with only very minor quality issues .",
    "in addition the seaming algorithm has been improved since dr1 .",
    "the seaming algorithm deals with sources that are detected in separate ( two or more ) multiframes that overlap . to decide which detection will be designated primary a sequence of discriminants is considered , until a preference is established : first the number of filters in which the source is detected , second the count from pperrbits , and finally the distance of the source from the detector edge .",
    "ukidss dr2 is crossmatched with sdss dr5 @xcite , updated from sdss dr3 for ukidss dr1 .",
    "note also that new crossmatching with catalogues from the millenium galaxy catalogue @xcite and the nrao vla sky survey @xcite is provided for dr2 .",
