    "a @xmath0 junction  @xcite is a josephson junction with a doubly degenerate ground state , in which the josephson phase takes the values @xmath1 or @xmath2 ( @xmath3 )  @xcite .",
    "this junction being closed into a ring is able to self - generate a fractional flux @xmath4/(2@xmath5 ) , where @xmath6 is the magnetic flux quantum .    in this sense",
    "the @xmath0 junction is a generalisation of the @xmath5 junction  @xcite which has a josephson phase @xmath7 or @xmath8 in its ground state .",
    "it has been experimentally demonstrated that the @xmath5 junction improves the performance and simplifies the design of classical and quantum circuits  @xcite . since the @xmath0 junction offers the possibility to choose a special value of the phase in the ground state it may further optimize these circuits .",
    "the initial @xmath0 junction proposal @xcite investigated grain - boundary junctions , which were analysed experimentally in @xcite . from then on @xmath0 junctions",
    "were studied more and more intensively and many other systems appeared as possible candidates for the realisation of @xmath0 junctions , e.g. @xcite . only recently",
    ", an experimental evidence of a @xmath0 junction made of @xmath9 and @xmath5 parts  @xcite was reported  @xcite .",
    "one half of the junction had the josephson phase @xmath9 in its ground state and the other half the phase @xmath5 .",
    "this was realised  @xcite by connecting two superconductor - insulator - ferromagnet - superconductor ( sifs ) junctions in parallel .",
    "the advantage of this concept is that it is based on the technology already developed for the fabrication of @xmath9-@xmath5 junctions  @xcite .    on the other hand",
    "this @xmath0 junction concept is difficult to realise experimentally because , e.g. , a step in the thickness of the f layer must be realised with very high accuracy  @xcite .",
    "a completely other method , the `` ramp - type overlap '' ( rto ) @xmath0 junction , was proposed by bakurskiy et al .",
    "it only requires one small sfs junction located on a thin normal ( n ) metal layer , see figure  [ fig : junction_02 ] .",
    "this basic setup provides a miniaturized @xmath0 junction .",
    "moreover , this type of junction has already been realised experimentally for the analysis of the double proximity effect  @xcite .     and length @xmath10 .",
    "it is located on top of a thin normal ( n ) metal film of thickness @xmath11 . ]",
    "a simple model  @xcite to show that the rto junction can be used as a @xmath0 junction requires its current - phase relation ( cpr ) . by writing it in terms of a sine series @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the josephson phase , the amplitudes have to obey the conditions  @xcite @xmath14    the rto junction , schematically shown in figure  [ fig : junction_02 ] , can fulfil these conditions because the current flows between the s electrodes through the f metal _ and _ the n layer . in this way the properties of an sfs and sns junction are combined .",
    "the sfs junction can have a negative  @xcite amplitude @xmath15 in  ( [ eq : cpr : introcuction ] ) , while the sns junction has a positive  @xcite amplitude @xmath16 in  ( [ eq : cpr : introcuction ] ) . by adding both the total amplitude @xmath17 can be minimized and a dominant negative amplitude @xmath18 from the sns part is obtained to fulfil conditions  ( [ eq : phijunction : condition : a ] ) .",
    "since supercurrents in sfs junctions are rather small , the sns contribution has to be reduced .",
    "this is done by using only a thin normal metal film .    in the present paper",
    "we investigate an rto junction which has , differently from the one proposed in  @xcite , transparent sf interfaces in order to amplify the sfs contribution to the total current .",
    "this assumption has already successfully been used to describe various experiments  @xcite . as a result ,",
    "we obtain slightly smaller system sizes for the @xmath0 junction realisation than  @xcite , where weakly transparent interfaces were assumed",
    ". moreover , our approach provides a better penetration of the superconducting correlations into the f layer which may increase the josephson current . in the framework of transparent sf interfaces we can not use linearised equations for the sfs part , as it was done in  @xcite . therefore",
    ", we use non - linearised equations in the sfs _ and _ sns part for our analytical approach .",
    "we derive the cpr in the `` dirty '' limit . for this purpose , we combine the solution of the usadel equations in the n film  @xcite with the solution of the usadel equations in the sfs layer  @xcite .",
    "the resulting current phase relation consists of three parts : ( i ) a contribution from the sfs layer , ( ii ) a contribution from the n film and ( iii ) a composite snfs term .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : model ]",
    "we introduce the model of the considered josephson junction in terms of usadel equations .",
    "the analytical expression of the cpr of our system is based on this model and presented in section  [ sec : calculation ] . in section  [ sec : discussion ]",
    "we use this expression together with realistic system parameters to discuss its applicability as @xmath0 junction .",
    "finally , an appendix provides a detailed derivation of the composite snfs current .",
    "the considered josephson junction is sketched in figure  [ fig : junction_02 ] .",
    "it consists of an sfs junction located on a normal metal film .",
    "the f layer has a thickness @xmath19 and a length @xmath10 while the n layer has a thickness @xmath11 and is considered as infinitely long .",
    "we have chosen the @xmath20 and @xmath21 axis in directions parallel and perpendicular to the plane of the n film , respectively .",
    "for the calculation of the current @xmath22 flowing from one superconducting electrode to the other we determine the green s functions describing our system .",
    "we consider the `` dirty '' limit @xcite , in which the elastic scattering length is much smaller than the characteristic decay length , we can use the usadel equations  @xcite to model our system .",
    "we write them in the form  @xcite @xmath23    - \\frac{{\\tilde{\\omega}}}{\\pi { t_\\mathrm{c } } } \\phi_j = 0 , \\nonumber \\\\",
    "g_j=\\frac{{\\tilde{\\omega}}}{\\sqrt{{\\tilde{\\omega}}^2+\\phi_j\\phi_j^ * } } , \\quad j \\in \\{\\mathrm{n , f}\\ }    \\label{eq : usadel : general}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the n and f layer , respectively . here ,",
    "@xmath24 and @xmath25 are the usadel green s functions in the @xmath26 parametrization  @xcite .",
    "the frequencies @xmath27 contain the matsubara frequencies @xmath28 at temperature @xmath29 , where @xmath30 , and the exchange field @xmath31 of the ferromagnetic material which is assumed to be zero in the n layer .",
    "the decay lengths @xmath32 of the superconducting correlations are defined via the critical temperature @xmath33 of the superconductor ( we use @xmath34 ) and the diffusion coefficients @xmath35 and @xmath36 in the normal and ferromagnetic metal , respectively .",
    "we assume that superconductivity in the s electrodes is not suppressed by the neighbouring n and f layers .",
    "this assumption is valid in our case of transparent sf interfaces with the conditions for the suppression parameters @xmath37 here , @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the resistances and areas of the sn and sf interfaces .",
    "the values of @xmath40 describe the resistivity of the n , f , and s metals .",
    "this allows us to use the rigid boundary conditions  @xcite @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the absolute value of the order parameter in the superconductor .",
    "the boundary conditions  @xcite at the free interfaces are @xmath43 and at the interfaces of the superconductor they are @xmath44   \\label{eq : bc : sn}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath45 additionally we use @xmath46 at the nf interfaces , where @xmath47 is defined analogous to  ( [ eq : gamma : bsn ] ) .    finally we calculate the total current @xmath48 by integrating the standard expressions  @xcite for the current densities of the n and f part over the junction cross section along the @xmath21 axis .",
    "this leads us to @xmath49_{x=0 }   \\label{eq : current : n : tot : def}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath50_{x=0 }   .",
    "\\label{eq : current : f : tot : def}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the width @xmath51 of the junction along the @xmath52 axis is supposed to be small compared to the josephson penetration depth .",
    "we have chosen the position @xmath53 for the integration over the junction cross section since the @xmath21 component of the current densities vanishes there because of the symmetry of the considered junction geometry .",
    "in order to calculate the current @xmath22 from  ( [ eq : current : tot : def ] ) we can not simply add the current through the n layer calculated by bakurskiy et al .",
    "@xcite to the sfs current calculated by buzdin et al .",
    "@xcite because we have to take into account a composite snfs current which appears due to a penetration of superconductivity from the n layer into the f layer .",
    "therefore , we split the current @xmath54 into a contribution @xmath55 due to a direct penetration of superconductivity into the f layer and the additional part @xmath56 .",
    "this leads us to @xmath57 in the following three sections we derive the expressions of these three currents using the scaling @xmath58      in this layer we adopt the current @xmath59 with the definitions @xmath60 [ eq : functions :",
    "n : def ] from  @xcite .",
    "its derivation is based on the assumption @xmath61 and an infinitely long n layer .",
    "it is calculated with the help of the solution @xmath62  ( [ eq : green : n ] ) of the non - linear usadel equations which depends only on the coordinate @xmath20 because the thickness @xmath63 is assumed to be small .",
    "the current @xmath64 with @xmath65 is a result of  @xcite .",
    "it also has been calculated with the help of a solution of the non - linear usadel equations because @xmath66 is assumed . additionally the condition @xmath67 is required .",
    "we determine the current @xmath56 by combining the two non - linear solutions @xmath68 and @xmath62 of  ( [ eq : green : f ] ) and  ( [ eq : green : n ] ) in  [ sec : nf : current : deriv ] . the main idea is to decompose the ferromagnetic green s function @xmath69 into a function @xmath68 , which corresponds to currents only flowing in the f layer , and a function @xmath70 , which corresponds to currents flowing through the n layer into the f layer . the second function is obtained by linearising the usadel equations  ( [ eq : usadel : general ] ) in the f layer",
    ". then we connect it to the n layer solution @xmath62 via the boundary conditions .",
    "the superposition  ( [ eq : green : f : total ] ) of the solution @xmath71 of the non - linear usadel equation with the solution @xmath72 of the linearised usadel equation is valid because we distinguish in the f part between two cases : ( i ) at @xmath73 near the boundaries to the s regions the green s function @xmath71 is very dominant @xmath74 due to a transparent boundary between the s and the f part , that is @xmath66 ; ( ii ) at @xmath75 , that is away from the boundaries the contribution of @xmath76 decays exponentially .",
    "therefore , the contribution from the n part is dominant @xmath77 .    as a result  ( [ eq : cpr : sum : fn ] ) we obtain the current @xmath78 \\nonumber \\\\     \\times 2\\pi t \\sum_{\\omega>0 } \\theta\\ , \\gamma(\\phi ) \\sin \\frac{\\phi}{2 }    ,   \\label{eq : cpr : sum : fn : main }    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the definitions of @xmath79 from  ( [ eq : def : gamma_phi ] ) , @xmath80 from  ( [ eq : def : kappa ] ) and @xmath81 together with @xmath82 from  ( [ eq : def : eta ] ) .",
    "in this section we estimate the geometrical parameters @xmath11 , @xmath19 and @xmath10 , see figure  [ fig : junction_02 ] , for which the considered josephson junction obeys the @xmath0 junction conditions  ( [ eq : phijunction : condition : a ] ) .",
    "we use the analysing scheme of  @xcite and finally compare our results with the ones obtained in  @xcite .",
    "we split the sine series amplitudes @xmath83 @xmath84 of the total current  ( [ eq : current : tot : def : new ] ) , scaled according to  ( [ eq : current : scaling ] ) , into parts originating from the current of the n layer  ( [ eq : cpr : sum :",
    "n ] ) , the f layer  ( [ eq : cpr : f ] ) and the composite nf current  ( [ eq : cpr : sum : fn : main ] ) .",
    "there is no amplitude @xmath85 because we have a pure sinusoidal cpr  ( [ eq : cpr : f ] ) in the f layer .    in our calculations we chose the temperature @xmath86 .",
    "we make this choice because far away from the critical temperature the cpr has larger deviations from the @xmath87 form  @xcite which results in a larger second harmonic @xmath18 . as s electrode material we chose nb with @xmath88 because it is commonly used in superconducting circuits .",
    "our first step is to find suitable parameters @xmath19 . for this purpose",
    "we analyse the amplitudes  ( [ eq : a ] ) and  ( [ eq : b ] ) as a function of @xmath10 for different values of @xmath19 for the same parameters as in  @xcite : @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "figure  [ fig : cpr : total ] shows three typical examples : ( a ) @xmath95 , ( b ) @xmath96 and ( c ) @xmath97 .",
    "the first ( a ) and last ( c ) examples correspond to limiting cases where it is difficult to realize a @xmath0 junction because the intervals of @xmath10 where conditions  ( [ eq : phijunction : condition : a ] ) hold are not large .",
    "these intervals of @xmath10 are highlighted by bold lines . in between the two limiting values for @xmath19",
    "this line becomes longer .",
    "figure  [ fig : cpr : total ] ( b ) shows an optimum situation because there is a wide range of @xmath10 which yields a @xmath0 junction configuration .     and @xmath98 , based on  ( [ eq : a ] ) and  ( [ eq : b ] ) , as functions of @xmath10 for @xmath89 and three characteristic values of @xmath19 .",
    "the bold lines correspond to values of @xmath10 where the conditions  ( [ eq : phijunction : condition : a ] ) for the @xmath0 junction realization are fulfilled . ]    for the optimum value @xmath96 we calculate the magnitudes and . inserting them together with the amplitude @xmath99 from  ( [ eq",
    ": cpr : f ] ) into  ( [ eq : phijunction : condition : a ] ) and neglecting the small nf contributions leads us to the condition @xmath100 here , we use the constant @xmath101 with @xmath96 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 from  ( [ eq : phijunction : condition : disc ] ) we find the minimum value @xmath104 and maximum values @xmath105 of @xmath10 .",
    "for summarising our suggestion of the geometrical configuration of a @xmath0 junction we use the value @xmath106 for cu as n layer , a strongly diluted ferromagnet such as fepd or the cuni alloy with @xmath107 and @xmath108 as f metal .",
    "our set of parameters then become , and , which we compare to the values , and of  @xcite .    since we use the same n layer configuration ,",
    "the value for @xmath11 is the same . but the suggested regime for @xmath19 differs .",
    "a change in this direction was expected because we only need a thin f layer since the transparency of our interfaces already amplifies our sfs current contribution . the possible range for the length @xmath10 of the f part is smaller in our case but the whole junction configuration is still experimentally feasible .",
    "we have shown that the considered josephson junction with a ferromagnetic weak link located on a thin normal metal film is a good candidate for a @xmath0 junction realisation . by choosing transparent sf interfaces we obtained slightly different system sizes for the @xmath0 junction existence compared to a junction with weakly transparent interfaces .",
    "the current was split into a contribution through the n layer , the f layer and a composite term which described the current flowing through the n and f parts of the junction simultaneously .",
    "we performed our calculations in the `` dirty '' limit , that is , the currents are obtained from solutions of the non - linear usadel equations .",
    "since our case of a large interface transparency corresponds better to the experimental situation  @xcite than weakly transparent interfaces  @xcite it is important to note that a smaller thickness and length of the f layer have to be chosen than predicted in  @xcite .",
    "we are looking forward to experiments realising this @xmath0 junction and its application in classical and quantum devices .",

    "in this appendix we derive the current  ( [ eq : cpr : sum : fn : main ] ) which flows through the n and f part of the junction , sketched in figure  [ fig : junction_02 ] , simultaneously .",
    "we first linearise the usadel equations  ( [ eq : usadel : general ] ) and then combine the solution with the green s functions from  @xcite and  @xcite .    for the linearisation of  ( [ eq : usadel : general ] )",
    "we assume the superconducting correlation coming from the n part into the f part as rather small .",
    "then , the green s function @xmath70 can also be assumed to be small .",
    "using @xmath109 we obtain the linearised usadel equation  @xcite @xmath110 with the definitions @xmath111    its solution in the form of a series @xmath112    , \\label{eq : green : nf}\\ ] ] with @xmath113 and a fourier coefficient @xmath114 , already obeys the boundary condition  ( [ eq : bc : free ] ) at the upper border ( @xmath115 ) .",
    "the boundary conditions at the left and right end of the f part at @xmath116 are also already fulfilled .",
    "they follow from  ( [ eq : bc : sf ] ) with @xmath66 . using here the definition  ( [ eq : green : f : total ] ) of @xmath76 leads us to the condition @xmath117 this equation is already fulfilled by the solution @xmath118 with @xmath119 , \\\\",

    "note that we do not need the expression for @xmath121 to finally calculate the current .    in order to obtain the fourier coefficient @xmath114 which fixes the solution @xmath72 from  ( [ eq : green : nf ] ) we use the boundary condition  ( [ eq : bc : nf ] ) where we neglect the term @xmath72 assuming @xmath122 .",

    "we insert the green s function  ( [ eq : green : f : total ] ) , which contains the green s functions from  ( [ eq : green : nf ] ) and  ( [ eq : green : f ] ) , into the definition  ( [ eq : current : f : tot : def ] ) of the f layer current . due to the condition",
