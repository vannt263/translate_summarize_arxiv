    "collective excitations are a common feature of a large variety of many body systems .",
    "their properties are intimately related to the stucture of the ground state upon which they are built . the simplest theory of excited states of a quantum system where correlations are taken into account to some extent is the random phase approximation ( @xmath0 ) . in this theory one",
    "introduces a set of operators @xmath2 , whose action on the ground state @xmath3 creates the collective excitations , while the ground state itself is the vacuum for the @xmath4 operators .",
    "the latters are defined as linear superpositions of particle - hole ( @xmath5 ) creation and annihilation operators , occupied ( @xmath6 ) and unoccupied ( @xmath7 ) single particle states being defined with respect to the hartree - fock ground state @xmath8 .",
    "the @xmath9 and @xmath10 coefficients of these linear forms are solutions of equations which can be derived by using the equations of motion method @xcite . if the hamiltonian contains one- and two - body terms , the solution of these equations would imply the evaluation of one- and two - body density matrices .",
    "standard @xmath0 is obtained by replacing them by those calculated in the uncorrelated ground state @xmath8 .",
    "this approximation introduces a visible inconsistency since , on one hand , the definition of @xmath3 as the vacuum of the @xmath4 operators is used to derive the formal equations determining the @xmath9 and @xmath10 amplitudes ; while , on the other hand , @xmath11 is used instead of @xmath12 in calculating the expectation values appearing in those equations .",
    "various attempts have been made to eliminate this inconsistency .",
    "we quote the pioneering works @xcite where the renormalized @xmath0 ( @xmath13 ) was introduced .",
    "the @xmath13 was applied to study the low - lying spectrum and the transition densities of vibrational nuclei @xcite and the double beta decay @xcite more recently . a very important contribution to the solution of this problem",
    "has been given in @xcite , where a general scheme , the self consistent @xmath0 ( @xmath14 ) , was developed ( see also @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "in reference @xcite a fully renormalized @xmath0 ( fully @xmath13 ) has been proposed , which shares some similarities with the approach we are going to present in this paper . in @xcite it was shown that by using the number operator method @xcite it is possible to get for the @xmath9 and @xmath10 coefficients a closed set of equations having the same form as in @xmath0 , where the density matrices in the correlated ground state are expressed in terms of the @xmath9 and @xmath10 coefficients themselves .",
    "thus the equations to solve are non linear and their solution requires a big computational effort . in order to appreciate how much a better treatment of correlations modifies the @xmath0 results , in the same paper a simplified version of the approach was proposed , the @xmath1 , based on the linearization of the equations of motion .",
    "the simplification consists in contracting the two - body terms appearing in the commutator of the hamiltonian with a one body @xmath5 operator with respect to the correlated ground state . in this way",
    "only one body density matrices have to be evaluated : the so obtained equations are still non linear , but they are much easier to be solved , since only the one - body density matrix appears . when the latter is calculated in @xmath15 rather than in the correlated @xmath16 , @xmath0 is again obtained @xcite .",
    "this approach was applied in @xcite to the study of the electronic properties of some simple metal clusters , obtaining a better description than @xmath0 .",
    "however , the formulation is quite general and its applicability is by no means limited to such systems .",
    "a limitation common to all extensions of @xmath0 including only @xmath5 configurations is that they violate to some extent the energy weighted sum rules ( @xmath17 ) . in the present paper",
    "we will show that this drawback can be eliminated by enlarging the configuration space , including also those configurations corresponding to the annihilation of a particle ( hole ) and the creation of another particle ( hole ) on the ground state .",
    "this is in the same spirit of @xcite , where , for the first time , the particle - particle and hole - hole configurations were included within the @xmath14 approximation .",
    "very recently a paper @xcite came to our knowledge , where the same problem is tackled and studied within a solvable 4-level model with a separable residual interaction .",
    "as we will show below , there are several differences with the present paper :    \\1 ) we explicitly show that the @xmath17 is exactly satisfied when the configuration space is enlarged ;    \\2 ) by comparison with the exact solutions of the model we can judge about the quality of the results obtained in @xmath1 and its enlarged version , with respect to the @xmath0 ones ;    \\3 ) this comparison allows us to point out that , besides the merit of solving the @xmath17 problem , the approach has the shortcoming that spurious solutions appear .",
    "this problem is not discussed in @xcite where , indeed , probably because a separable residual interaction is used , only one collective state is found despite the fact that 3 elementary excitation modes are present in the model . in this context , it is worth mentioning that spurious solutions are also found in @xcite , where they are interpreted as `` new excitation modes '' .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we shortly recall the main @xmath1 equations , pointing to the origin of the @xmath17 violations .",
    "then we show how this problem is solved when the enlarged space is considered . in section iii",
    "we illustrate the approach by applying it to a solvable 3-level model @xcite and comparing the different approximations among themselves and with the exact results .",
    "in this section we recall the main steps leading to the @xmath1 equations , presented in detail in @xcite , and illustrate why , being limited to @xmath5 excitations , the @xmath1 approximation violates the @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "then we show that , enlarging the space by including also @xmath18 and @xmath19 configurations , this difficulty is overcome . in this respect ,",
    "our approach is similar to the fully @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "let @xmath16 be the ground state of the system and @xmath20 its excited states .",
    "assuming that the latters are linear combinations of @xmath5 and @xmath21 configurations built upon @xmath16 one writes : | _ q^ _ |_0 _ ph [ x^_ph b^_ph - y^_ph b_ph ] | _ 0  , [ 1 ] where @xmath7 ( @xmath6 ) denotes the quantum numbers of an unoccupied ( @xmath7 ) and occupied ( @xmath6 ) single particle state in the uncorrelated hartree - fock reference state @xmath15 . in eq.([1 ] ) we have introduced renormalized @xmath5 creation ( @xmath22 ) and annihilation ( @xmath23 ) operators . in @xcite it is shown that in the basis diagonalizing the one - body density matrix they can be written as : b^_ph = d^-12_ph a^_p a_h  , [ 2 ] with : d_ph n_h - n_p  , [ 3 ] where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are respectively the hole and particle occupation numbers in the correlated ground state @xmath26 .",
    "assuming that @xmath3 is the vacuum of the @xmath4 operators , q_| _ 0 = 0  , [ 4 ] the ortonormality conditions for the excited states leads to : _",

    "[ 5 ] the equations determining the @xmath27 and @xmath28 amplitudes and the excitation energies @xmath29 of the states @xmath20 are obtained by using the equations of motion method @xcite .",
    "they read : (    cc a&b + b^*&a^ *    ) (    cx^ + y^    ) = e _ (    cx^ + -y^    )  , [ 6 ] with the @xmath30 and @xmath23 matrices given by : a_ph , ph = _ 0 |[b_ph , h , b^_ph|_0[7 ] and b_ph , ph = -_0    hamiltonian of the system and : ( [ a,[b , c]]+[[a , b],c ] ) [ 9 ] the standard @xmath0 equations can be obtained by putting @xmath24=1 , @xmath25=0 in the expressions for the operators @xmath23 and @xmath31 ( [ 2 ] ) and by replacing the correlated ground state @xmath32 appearing in ( [ 7 ] ) and ( [ 8 ] ) with the hartree - fock one @xmath33 . in @xcite it is shown that the @xmath0 equations can equivalently be obtained by linearizing the commutator @xmath34 $ ] in ( [ 7 ] ) and ( [ 8 ] ) , i.e. by contracting it with respect to @xmath11 .",
    "a better approximation is done in @xmath1 , where the linearization is made by contraction in @xmath35 . in a loose notation , this means : @xmath36 \\rightarrow a^{\\dag } a + a^{\\dag } a^{\\dag } a a   \\\\",
    "\\sim a^{\\dag } a + \\langle \\psi_0 | a^{\\dag } a | \\psi_0 \\rangle a^{\\dag } a ~. \\label{10}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] therefore , the occupation numbers in the correlated ground state appear in the @xmath1 expressions , while those in @xmath11 ( i.e. 0 or 1 ) appear in standard @xmath0 .",
    "this procedure leads to : @xmath37 where : _",
    "pp ( p|h_1|p)+ _ n_(p",
    "|h_2|p ) [ 12 ] and _ hh ( h|h_1|h ) + _ n _ ( h |h_2| h )  .",
    "[ 13 ] for the matrix @xmath23 one gets : @xmath38 in the above equations @xmath39 is the one - body term of the hamiltonian and @xmath40 its two - body part .",
    "we denote by @xmath41 a generic single particle state ( occupied or unoccupied in @xmath11 ) .",
    "as shown in appendix a of @xcite , using the number operator method @xcite the occupation numbers appearing in the @xmath30 and @xmath23 matrices can be expressed in terms of the @xmath9 and @xmath10 amplitudes as : n_p=_h(_-12_p_1h_1 d_p_1h_1x^_p_1h_1x^_p_1h_1)d_phy^_phy^*_ph  , [ 15 ] n_h=1-_p(_-12_p_1h_1 d_p_1h_1x^_p_1h_1x^_p_1h_1)d_phy^_phy^*_ph  . [ 16 ] therefore eq.s ( [ 6 ] ) are non linear .",
    "they have been solved iteratively in the case of metallic clusters @xcite .",
    "it is , however , apparent that the approach is quite general and can be applied to any many body system .",
    "the matrices @xmath30 and @xmath23 in @xmath1 , eq.s([11 ] ) and ( [ 14 ] ) , are different from those in standard @xmath0 . on one side",
    "the hartree - fock single particle energies appearing in the @xmath30 matrix of @xmath0 are replaced by the quantities appearing in the first line of eq.([11 ] ) . on the other side , the residual interaction in the expressions for @xmath30 and @xmath23",
    "is now renormalized by the factors @xmath42 s . in @xmath13",
    "only the latter modification is present .",
    "this latter modification is present also in @xmath13 .",
    "a serious problem arises with respect to the @xmath17 . as it is well known , if @xmath12 and @xmath43 are a complete set of exact eigenstates of the hamiltonian , with eigenvalues @xmath44 and @xmath29 , the following identity holds : _",
    "( e_- e_0 ) |_|f|_0    hermitian single particle operator .",
    "the equality ( [ 17 ] ) is in general violated to some extent when @xmath3 , @xmath20 and @xmath45 are calculated within some approximation .",
    "to which extent it is satisfied is a measure of the adequacy of the approximation .",
    "a very important feature of @xmath0 is that eq.([17 ] ) is satisfied for any one - body operator if , in calculating its two sides , one considers @xmath11 instead of @xmath35 and the solutions of @xmath0 for @xmath43 and @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "this feature follows from the fact that , when @xmath11 is used in ( [ 17 ] ) instead of @xmath3 only particle - hole matrix elements remain in the r.h.s .",
    "it is easy to show @xcite that , if the transition operator @xmath47 has only @xmath48 matrix elements , the two sides of eq.([17 ] ) are equal also within @xmath1 .",
    "however , this is not the case in general .",
    "let us consider separately the two sides of eq.([17 ] ) in @xmath1 , with a general one - body hermitian operator @xmath47 : f= _ f _ a^ _ a _  .",
    "[ 18 ] the l.h.s . is easily calculated and gives : @xmath49|\\psi_0\\rangle|^2   \\\\ & & = \\sum_{\\nu}(e_\\nu -e_0 ) |\\sum_{ph } f_{ph } d^{1/2}_{ph } ( x^{\\nu}_{ph}+ y^{\\nu}_{ph})|^2 ~ , \\label{19}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is formally equal to the @xmath0 result , apart from the factor @xmath50 .",
    "therefore , only the @xmath5 components of @xmath47 enter .",
    "this is due to the fact that the excited states are described as superpositions of @xmath5 configurations only .",
    "starting from eq.s([6 ] ) and using the properties of the @xmath9 and @xmath10 amplitudes , eq.([19 ] ) can be written as : @xmath51 in order to evaluate the r.h.s .",
    "of eq.([17 ] ) one can use for the commutator @xmath52 $ ] the same linearization procedure already used in deriving eq.s([11 ] ) and ( [ 14 ] ) .",
    "it is easy to realize that the result of such calculation can not be equal to ( [ 20 ] ) since not only the @xmath5 matrix elements of the residual interaction will appear in it , but also other terms if they are present in the one body operator @xmath47 .",
    "this happens because the expectation value of the double commutator is taken in the correlated ground state @xmath3 .",
    "we will show this in the next subsection , where an enlarged configuration space , including also @xmath18 and @xmath19 components , will be used to express the excited states .",
    "of course , if the correlations present in @xmath3 are small and the occupation numbers do not differ too much from 0 and 1 , the violations of the @xmath17 are small .",
    "but , in general , this is not the case .",
    "for example , for na clusters , the discrepancy was found @xcite to be about 25@xmath53 .      as shown in the previous subsection ,",
    "the problem of violations of the @xmath17 arises because also in @xmath1 , as in @xmath0 , the excited states are expressed as superpositions of @xmath5 configurations .",
    "let us then consider the more general expansion : || _ = |q^ _ ||_0 = _ > ( |x^ _ b^ _ - |y^ _ b _ ) ||_0  , [ 21 ] where @xmath41 and @xmath54 stand for any single particle state and @xmath55 means that we order these states according to decreasing occupation numbers , i.e. @xmath56 . the operators @xmath57 and @xmath58 are an obvious generalization of eq.s ( [ 2 ] ) and ( [ 3 ] ) .",
    "as before we define @xmath59 as the vacuum of the @xmath60 operators : _ ||_0 = 0  .",
    "[ 22 ] in order to make simpler the notation , we will omit the bars in the collective operators and in the states , which , of course , are different from those considered in @xmath1 since now @xmath18 and @xmath19 configurations are included , in addition to the @xmath5 ones .",
    "the derivation of the equations of motion can be done by following the same linearization procedure as before .",
    "they have the same form as in eq.([6 ] ) , the matrices @xmath30 and @xmath23 being now : @xmath61 and @xmath62 where : _",
    "= ( |h_1|)+_n _ ( |h_2| )  .",
    "[ 25 ] apart from the fact that in eq.s([23 ] ) and ( [ 24 ] ) the indices run over all single particle states , the main difference with eq.s([11 ] ) and ( [ 14 ] ) is the presence of the @xmath63 terms also in the @xmath23 matrix .",
    "coming back to the @xmath17 problem , eq.([20 ] ) is easily generalized to : @xmath64 which , after some tedious manipulations , can be written as : @xmath65~. \\label{27}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the double commutator is easily calculated by using the same linearization procedure adopted to derive the equations of motion . doing that one realizes that eq.([17 ] ) is indeed satisfied .",
    "thus one obtains a kind of generalization of the thouless theorem .",
    "namely , eq.([17 ] ) is satisfied if one calculates its two sides by using the solutions of the equations of motion and by making the same approximations introduced in the derivation of the latters .    in principle",
    "the new approach does not appear to be more difficult than @xmath1 and its equations can be solved in realistic cases by the same iterative procedure used there . in practice , however , the computational effort is much heavier since the configuration space is much larger . for this reason",
    "we have decided to apply it to a solvable 3-level model @xcite .",
    "we show this application in the next section , where we compare the results of @xmath1 and of its enlarged version with the exact solutions of the model .",
    "let us first of all illustrate the solvable model to which we applied the enlarged version of @xmath1 .",
    "it consists of three levels , 0 , 1 and 2 , with energies @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 , respectively .",
    "let @xmath69 be the degeneracy of each level and @xmath70 the total number of fermions in the system .",
    "we define the operators : k_ij _ m a^_im a_jm  , [ 28 ] where the indices @xmath71 and @xmath72 denote one of the three levels and the index @xmath73 runs over the @xmath69 substates of each of them .",
    "the operators @xmath74 satisfy the following commutation relations : = _ jk k_il - _ il k_kj  . [ 29 ] they are therefore the generators of the @xmath75 algebra . the algebra becomes @xmath76 if we consider the additional relation , n=_i",
    "k_ii  , [ 30 ] that fixes the total number of particles .    we introduce the hamiltonian for our system as follows : @xmath77 the terms with the @xmath78 and @xmath79 strengths describe , respectively , the @xmath80 and @xmath81 parts of the interaction .",
    "the term with the @xmath82 strength is related to the @xmath83 part , while the last term represents the @xmath84 part . in standard",
    "@xmath0 the only two - body terms of @xmath85 that enter in the expressions for the matrices @xmath30 and @xmath23 of the equations of motion ( [ 6 ] ) are those with the strengths @xmath78 and @xmath79 , i.e. the @xmath5 two - body terms . in the @xmath1 approach",
    "@xcite the ground state that is actually used in the calculations is correlated ; so the single particle occupation numbers are nt strictly 1 for hole states and 0 for particle states , as in @xmath86 . in this case",
    "also the @xmath84 term enters in the expressions for the matrices ( actually only in the matrix @xmath30 ) . in the @xmath1 approach with the enlarged configuration space all the terms contribute .",
    "the exact results for the system can be obtained either by using the @xmath76 symmetry of the model or by diagonalizing the hamiltonian ( [ 31 ] ) in the complete set of states : |n_1 n_2 c ( k_10)^n_1 ( k_20)^n_2 |0  , [ 32 ] where @xmath87 denotes the state in which all the particles are in the level @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 are the numbers of particles in the levels @xmath91 and @xmath92 , respectively , and @xmath93 represents a normalization factor .    with the same set of parameters chosen for the exact calculation , after having performed a standard @xmath0 calculation , we solved the equations of motion both in the @xmath1 approach of @xcite and in the new approach , with the enlarged configuration space . in the @xmath1 case the operators @xmath94 are defined as linear combinations of @xmath5 ( @xmath95 , with : @xmath96 ) and @xmath21 ( @xmath97 , with @xmath96 ) configurations , as in eq.([1 ] ) : q^__i ( x^_i k_i0-y^_ik_0i )  , [ 33 ] while in the enlarged calculation they are defined as in eq.([21 ] ) : q^ _ _ i > j ( x^_ij k_ij - y^_ij k_ji )  , [ 34 ] where : _ ij d^-1/2_ij k_ij  . [ 35 ] with the definition ( [ 35 ] ) we get , for the excited states of the system , the same orthonormality conditions as given in eq.([5 ] ) .",
    "note that in ( [ 34 ] ) the indices @xmath71 and @xmath72 run over all the 3 single particle levels of the model . in both cases ( [ 33 ] ) and",
    "( [ 34 ] ) we have solved the non linear problem of eq.s([6 ] ) by means of an iterative procedure .",
    "we fixed the number of particles @xmath98 equal to 10 . in this case",
    "the number of exact eigenstates of the hamiltonian is 66 .",
    "the @xmath0 and @xmath1 calculations will give two excited states , since their configuration space is composed only by the two configurations @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "the enlarged @xmath1 will give three states , since its configuration space is made by the three configurations @xmath99 , @xmath101 and @xmath100 .",
    "we tested various values for the four parameters @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath82 and @xmath102 and for the energies of the levels , the results being qualitatively the same . in fig .",
    "1 we show one case , where : _ 0 = 0 , _ 1 = , _ 2 = 2.5  , [ 36 ] v_0=- , v_1= , v_2=-2 v_3=  .",
    "[ 37 ] both the @xmath63 and @xmath103 parameters have the units of an energy . in the figure the excitation energies are represented versus the increasing values of the strength @xmath103 .",
    "dashed lines refer to exact values of energies . among all the 66 exact eigenvalues",
    "the two represented ones are those with energies equal to 1 and 2.5 at @xmath104 ; i.e. those which correspond to the two @xmath0 and @xmath1 excited states .",
    "dotted lines refer to @xmath0 and dot - dashed lines to @xmath1 values .",
    "the three values corresponding to the enlarged @xmath1 approach are represented by full lines .    the collapse point of @xmath0 , where its first excitation energy becomes imaginary , appears at @xmath105 .",
    "we observe that both the @xmath1 and the enlarged @xmath1 calculations push the collapse point towards greater values of the strength parameter @xmath103 ; so , in this regard , both methods improve the @xmath0 results .",
    "moreover it can be seen that the two exact values are better approximated by the first and the third states obtained in the enlarged @xmath1 approach , than by the two @xmath1 states .",
    "this is especially evident for the higher state .",
    "it is interesting to focus the attention on the presence of the additional state that the enlarged @xmath1 gives , with respect to @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "actually this state does nt correspond to any of the found exact states .",
    "this fact seems to indicate that it is a spurious state . on the other hand",
    "its energy is not zero or very small , as it happens normally for spurious states .",
    "its energy always starts , when @xmath103 starts from zero , from the energy difference between the levels 1 and 2 , and so it depends on how we fix the values @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "this would mean that , if we applied our approach in a realistic calculation , the spurious states that would appear would nt be easily recognized and eliminated , not having in principle zero or very small energies .",
    "this could cause problems in the interpretation of the calculated spectrum of excitations .",
    "a similar situation is encountered in @xmath0 at finite temperature and was also found in @xcite .",
    "let us look at the transition probabilities related to this state .",
    "figure 2 shows the transition probabilities related to the obtained states , for @xmath0 and @xmath106 calculations , for different @xmath103 strengths .",
    "let s observe in the figure the transition probability related to the spurios state , p_sp=| _ _ sp | f | _ 0 |^2  , [ 38 ] where @xmath3 is the ground state , @xmath107 is the spurious state and @xmath47 the one body operator ( [ 18 ] ) with all the @xmath108 s equal to one .",
    "we can see that @xmath109 is very small , with respect to the other two transition probabilities , only when @xmath103 is far from the collapse point ; when @xmath103 approaches the collapse point the transition probability ( [ 38 ] ) becomes appreciable ( see the case @xmath110 in the figure ) .",
    "the same trend is found for other sets of parameters .",
    "this means that in the evaluation of any physical quantity , in a realistic calculation , the existence of spurious states would have some influence and it would be important to recognize and eliminate them from the calculation .",
    "the problem of how to recognize them is still open , as they do nt have in general small energies and/or small transition probabilities .",
    "we present now , in table 1 , the results obtained for the @xmath17 , in @xmath1 and in enlarged @xmath1 cases .",
    "these results refer again to the choice ( [ 36 ] ) and ( [ 37 ] ) for the parameters .",
    "the violation of the @xmath17 , in the @xmath1 case , increases with the increasing values of the @xmath103 parameter and is about of 30@xmath53 for @xmath111 . in the enlarged @xmath1 case",
    "the @xmath17 is always exactly satisfied , as expected .",
    "this is an important achievement of the present method , because , as stressed in section 1 , all the methods that have been proposed so far in order to go beyond the @xmath0 , by avoiding the inconsistency of the quasi boson approximation , always violate the @xmath17 identity .",
    "in conclusion , we have presented an extension of @xmath0 which avoids the use of the quasi boson approximation and , at variance with many other attempts made in the same direction , preserves exactly the @xmath17 .",
    "this is obtained as a generalization of a previously studied approach by enlarging the configuration space with respect to that commonly used , which contains only particle - hole elementary escitations .",
    "the approach has been tested on a 3-level solvable model .",
