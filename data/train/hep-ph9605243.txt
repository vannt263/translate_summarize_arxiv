    "since the advent of qcd as a theory of hadronic interactions , there have been experimental searches for unambiguous evidence of gluonic excitations in mesons .",
    "these searches need to be guided by theoretical input .",
    "the theoretical exploration involves non - perturbative methods and lattice qcd has become the most reliable tool . here",
    "we review the status of glueball mass determinations from the lattice .",
    "the main aspect of topicality comes from a widely publicised claim  @xcite that the lattice work uniquely targets a particular experimental candidate .",
    "we discuss this claim and put it in context .",
    "another area which is promising for a study of gluonic excitations is that of hybrid mesons .",
    "these have a gluonic field in a non - trivial representation so that it is truly excited .",
    "we review lattice results for this spectrum for the case of heavy quarks .",
    "new results for light quarks are presented .",
    "these preliminary results give strong evidence for the splitting among the many possible hybrid meson states .",
    "the states with exotic quantum numbers ( ie not allowed by the naive quark model : @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) are studied and their spectrum is estimated .",
    "the difficulty in isolating glueball candidates experimentally comes from the indirect methods that have to be used to deduce if a given resonance is composed primarily of gluons or of quarks .",
    "lattice qcd allows the quark masses to be varied at will . in the simplest case , the quenched approximation ,",
    "the dynamical quark mass is taken as large so that no quark loops are present in the vacuum . in this approximation , glueballs are stable and do not mix with quark - antiquark mesons .",
    "this approximation is very easy to implement in lattice studies : the full gluonic action is used but no quark terms are included .",
    "this corresponds to a full non - perturbative treatment of the gluonic degrees of freedom in the vacuum .",
    "a systematic lattice study of the neglected quark loop effects can be made in principle - though no comprehensive treatment has yet been made .",
    "the glueball mass can be measured on a lattice through evaluating the correlation @xmath4 of two closed colour loops ( called wilson loops ) at separation @xmath5 lattice spacings .",
    "this correlation has contributions from all glueballs of the given symmetry , with the ground state contribution dominating at large @xmath5 . in practice ,",
    "sophisticated methods are used to choose loops such that the correlation @xmath4 is dominated by the ground state glueball . by using several different loops ,",
    "a variational method can be used to achieve this effectively .",
    "even so , it is worth keeping in mind that upper limits on the ground state mass are obtained in principle .",
    "the method also needs to be tuned to take account of the many glueballs : with different @xmath0 and different momenta . on the lattice the lorentz symmetry is reduced to that of a hypercube .",
    "non - zero momentum sates can be created ( momentum is discrete in units of @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the lattice spatial size ) .",
    "the usual relationship between energy and momentum is found for sufficiently small lattice spacing .",
    "here we shall concentrate on the simplest case of zero momentum ( obtained by summing the correlations over the whole spatial volume ) .    for a state at rest ,",
    "the rotational symmetry becomes a cubic symmetry .",
    "the lattice states will transform under irreducible representations of this cubic symmetry group ( called @xmath8 ) .",
    "these irreducible representations can be linked to the representations of the full rotation group su(2 ) .",
    "thus , for example , the five spin components of a @xmath9 state should be appear as the two - dimensional e@xmath10 and the three - dimensional t@xmath11 representations on the lattice , with degenerate masses .",
    "this degeneracy requirement then provides a test for the restoration of rotational invariance - which is expected to occur at sufficiently small lattice spacing .",
    "the results of lattice measurements  @xcite of the @xmath12 and @xmath13 states are shown in fig  1 . since the lattice observables , such as the glueball mass @xmath14 , are not in physical units , it is necessary to form dimensionless ratios of lattice observables to compare with experiment .",
    "fig  1 shows the dimensionless combination of the lattice glueball mass @xmath15 with a lattice quantity @xmath16 , which is a well measured quantity ( given by @xmath17 at @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the lattice interquark potential at separation @xmath20 ) on the lattice that can be used to calibrate the lattice spacing and so explore the continuum limit .",
    "the quantity plotted , @xmath21 , is expected to be equal to the product of continuum quantities @xmath22 up to corrections of order @xmath23 .",
    "this behaviour near the continuum limit is indeed found as shown by the linear dependence of fig  1 .",
    "the extrapolation to the continuum limit ( @xmath24 ) can now be made with confidence .",
    "note that older lattice data were only available at larger values of @xmath23 which explains why a smaller @xmath12 glueball mass was favoured at that time .    the lattice results in fig  1 from the ukqcd and gf11 groups have signals which are of comparable statistical significance and which are consistent with each other .",
    "however , their published values  @xcite of the @xmath12 glueball mass are different ( 1550 versus 1740 mev ) .",
    "the gf11 group chose to extrapolate @xmath25 to the continuum limit .",
    "this ratio has the disadvantage that there can be corrections both of order @xmath26 and of order @xmath27 while they assume in their extrapolation that only order @xmath23 effects are significant .",
    "they determine @xmath28 from their own results for @xmath29 which yields a @xmath12 mass of @xmath30 mev leading them to claim  @xcite that the @xmath31 meson is a preferred glueball candidate .",
    "their error estimate on the glueball mass does not take into account fully the systematic errors in the extraction of the continuum limit or those due to quenching .",
    "using instead the best determined _ continuum _ quantity from the lattice results , we need to determine a physical value for @xmath32 . from the interquark potential",
    "as determined in spectroscopy , the value of @xmath32 in physical units is about 0.5 fm and we will adopt a scale equivalent to @xmath33 gev .",
    "this information yields lattice predictions for the glueball masses based on all lattice data of around 1.6 gev and 2.2 gev for the @xmath12 and @xmath13 glueballs respectively . setting the scale in a quenched lattice calculation is inherently imprecise because ratios of lattice observables are found to disagree with experimental values ( unquenched ) by different amounts for different ratios .",
    "thus no common scale determination is possible for the quenched lattice .",
    "it is prudent to assign a systematic error of at least 10% to the scale .",
    "since this dominates the statistical error , the conservative conclusion is a @xmath12 glueball mass of @xmath34 mev .",
    "this is an energy range consistent with promising experimental @xmath12 glueball candidates such as @xmath35 - for a review see ref@xcite .",
    "a candidate for a @xmath13 glueball at 2230 mev has also been reported recently  @xcite .",
    "the predictions for the other @xmath0 states are that they lie higher in mass and the present state of knowledge is summarised in fig  2 .",
    "note that the lattice gives a clear indication that no light pseudoscalar glueball should exist .",
    "remember that the lattice results are strictly upper limits .",
    "for the @xmath0 values not shown , these upper limits are too weak to be of use .",
    "since quark - antiquark mesons can only have certain @xmath0 values , it is of special interest to look for glueballs with @xmath0 values not allowed for such mesons : @xmath36 etc .",
    "such spin - exotic states , often called `` oddballs '' , would not mix directly with quark - antiquark mesons .",
    "this would make them a very clear experimental signal of the underlying glue dynamics .",
    "various glueball models ( bag models , flux tube models , qcd sum - rule inspired models , ... ) gave different predictions for the presence of such oddballs ( eg .",
    "@xmath37 ) at relatively low masses .",
    "the lattice mass spectra clarify these uncertainties but , unfortunately for experimentalists , do not indicate any low - lying oddball candidates .",
    "the lightest candidate is from the t@xmath38 spin combination .",
    "such a state could correspond to an @xmath3 oddball .",
    "another interpretation is also possible , however , namely that a non - exotic @xmath39 state is responsible ( this choice of interpretation can be resolved in principle by finding the degenerate 5 or 7 states of a @xmath40 or 3 meson ) .",
    "the overall conclusion at present is that there is no evidence for any oddballs of mass less than 3 gev .",
    "glueballs are defined in the quenched approximation and , hence , they do not decay into mesons since that would require quark - antiquark creation .",
    "it is , nevertheless , still possible to estimate the strength of the matrix element between a glueball and a pair of mesons within the quenched approximation . for the glueball to be a relatively narrow state ,",
    "this matrix element must be small .",
    "a very preliminary attempt  @xcite has been made to estimate the size of the coupling of the @xmath12 glueball to two pseudoscalar mesons .",
    "a relatively small value is found .",
    "furthermore they see indications for a dependence on the pseudoscalar mass of the reduced decay matrix element .",
    "these conclusions imply that the quenched glueball mass determination was of relevance to the experimental situation since the mixing with other mesons would be small . further work needs to be done to investigate this in more detail , in particular to study the mixing between the glueball and @xmath12 mesons since this mixing may be an important factor in the decay process .    in principle",
    ", it is possible to study on a lattice the glueball spectrum in full qcd vacua with sea quarks of mass @xmath41 . for large @xmath41 ,",
    "the result is just the quenched result described above . for @xmath41",
    "equal to the experimental light quark masses , the results should just reproduce the experimental meson spectrum - with the resultant uncertainty between glueball interpretations and other interpretations .",
    "the lattice enables these uncertainties to be resolved in principle : one obtains the spectrum for a range of values of @xmath41 between these limiting cases , so mapping glueball states at large @xmath41 to the experimental spectrum at light @xmath41 .",
    "in order to set the scene for the study of mesons with gluonic excitations , it is worthwhile to summarise briefly the simple constituent quark model .",
    "this model of massive quark and antiquark bound by a potential is only justified theoretically for @xmath42 and to a lesser extent @xmath43 , but it is still useful guide for light quark states .",
    "the mesonic states that can be made from @xmath44 with spatial wavefunction with orbital angular momentum @xmath7 and total spin @xmath45 or @xmath46 have @xmath0 values of    since the gluon can introduce no flavour quantum numbers , the @xmath0 assignments will be of importance .",
    "of special interest in the following will be the absence of certain @xmath0 values in the above list .",
    "these states are known as spin - exotic and include @xmath47 .",
    "we define a hybrid meson as a @xmath44 system with additional gluonic excitation .",
    "the definition of a hybrid meson is less clear than for a glueball since even the basic quark model mesons have a gluonic component which is responsible for the binding force .",
    "so we must establish that the gluonic component is excited before labelling a state as a hybrid meson .",
    "this is straightforward for the case of static quarks at separation @xmath48 .",
    "the ground state potential will then have cylindrical symmetry about the interquark axis while less symmetric configurations correspond to various excitations of the gluonic flux joining the sources . a pioneering study using lattice techniques  @xcite found that the first excited gluonic state arises from transverse gluonic flux excitations of the form @xmath49 .",
    "such spatial excitations of the distribution of the colour flux from quark to antiquark correspond to gluonic fields with @xmath50 about the interquark axis and so are clearly hybrid states .    in molecular physics",
    ", it is common to assume that the electronic degrees of freedom adjust themselves with a much shorter timescale than that of the rotation of the molecule as a whole - this is the adiabatic approximation . for hybrid mesons",
    ", this will be valid if the gluonic degrees of freedom have a much shorter time - scale than those associated with the quarks .",
    "this will be a plausible approach since we find gluonic excitations with energies exceeding 1 gev while quark model excitations ( orbital and radial ) have smaller energies ( of a few hundred mev ) .",
    "then the allowed @xmath0 values of hybrid mesons bound in this excited gluonic potential can be easily determined within this adiabatic approximation using the schrdinger equation .",
    "the lowest lying hybrid states are found  @xcite to have @xmath0 values arising from two spatial symmetries    the first group corresponds to the states accessible from a `` magnetic gluon '' excitation with spatial symmetry @xmath51 while the second group are from an `` electric gluon '' with @xmath52 .",
    "the lattice determination  @xcite of the ground state and excited potentials is illustrated in fig  3 for the quenched case . at large interquark separation @xmath48",
    ", a hadronic string picture is expected to be a reasonable model and we see that the string model excitation energy ( @xmath53 in the simplest version - but see ref  @xcite ) gives a good description . also shown is the spectrum of mesons in these potentials obtained in the abiabatic approximation for @xmath54 quarks . although the absolute value of the bound state energy is not accessible because of lattice self - energy effects , the difference between energies of bound states in the ground and excited potential is completely predicted .",
    "the hybrid level shown is the lowest such level and has the above eight degenerate @xmath0 values .",
    "thus there will be mesons with exotic quantum numbers at this energy which provide a prediction that can be checked by experiment .",
    "the ground state potential in the quenched approximation does not correctly reproduce the experimental @xmath55 spectrum .",
    "the simplest explanation is that in full qcd the short distance ( coulombic ) component of the potential would be enhanced ( by @xmath56 at leading order in perturbation theory ) and such an enhancement is illustrated in fig  3 by the dotted ground state potential that does indeed reproduce the experimental spectrum .",
    "using this prescription , but taking into account uncertainties from different approaches to modifying the quenched approximation , the lattice prediction  @xcite is for the lightest hybrid meson excitation to be at 4.19(15 ) gev for @xmath57 and 10.81(25 ) gev for @xmath58 .",
    "these energy values lie above the open @xmath59 and @xmath60 thresholds .",
    "an alternative procedure , within the quenched approximation , is to focus  @xcite on the energy difference between the hybrid meson and the @xmath61 threshold .",
    "this suggests that the lowest hybrid level may lie below the threshold .",
    "these lattice predictions do not take account of splitting of the degeneracy of the hybrid levels due to spin - spin and spin - orbit effects . indeed , going beyond the adiabatic approximation",
    ", the non - exotic hybrid mesons can mix with states in the usual @xmath7-excited quark model and may thus be modified substantially .",
    "evidence also exists from lattice studies  @xcite at small separation @xmath48 that the @xmath51 excitation is a few hundred mev lighter than the @xmath52 excitation",
    ". this would imply that the degenerate hybrid levels would be split with the lightest exotic state having @xmath1 .",
    "the experimental detection of such states depends crucially on whether they lie above or below the open quark threshold .",
    "the quenched lattice estimate  @xcite shows that , for both @xmath54 and @xmath62 quarks , the lightest hybrid levels lie above threshold . the uncertainties due to the level splitting effects described above , combined with the uncertainty in interpretation of the quenched spectrum , both point to the possibility that a narrow spin exotic hybrid meson could exist close to the open quark threshold .",
    "it is important to search carefully for such states .    in principle",
    "the lattice approach allows a study of hybrid mesons formed from light ( @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 ) quarks .",
    "preliminary results have recently been obtained  @xcite by the ukqcd collaboration .",
    "the method builds on the experience with static quarks and uses operators to create hybrid mesons in which the quark and antiquark are joined by colour flux which is excited in the transverse plane as @xmath49 .",
    "excitations of this kind are clearly non - trivial gluonic contributions and the mesonic states in such excited potentials include exotic @xmath0 values .",
    "the lattice analysis is a fully relativistic analysis of propagating mesons .",
    "the approximations used are that of the quenched approximation for the vacuum and , in this preliminary study , we used a light quark mass corresponding to the strange quark ( since lighter quarks are computationally more demanding ) . from the results we will be able to explore the splitting among hybrid meson levels as well as the mixing between non - exotic hybrid mesons and @xmath66 mesons .",
    "preliminary results  @xcite come from 70 lattices of size @xmath67 at @xmath68 which is only a small fraction of the eventual statistical sample .",
    "we used a sw - clover fermionic action with clover coefficient @xmath69 and hopping parameter @xmath70 . to establish our methods , we have studied the @xmath7-excited quark model mesons for s , p and d waves and successfully determined their energy levels .",
    "the signal for the hybrid mesons is weaker and our present data sample does not give precise estimates of the hybrid meson masses .",
    "for example , our results for the @xmath1 meson are shown by the fit in fig  4 and are consistent with a mass ratio @xmath71 which shows the large errors remaining .",
    "what is somewhat better determined , however , are the splitting effects .",
    "we see in fig  5 significant mixing of non - exotic hybrids created using our hybrid operators with @xmath66 mesons of the same quantum numbers .",
    "we intend to explore this more fully in future .",
    "we find that the exotic hybrids are all at comparable masses with the state with spatial excitation @xmath51 slightly lower in mass so that the lightest exotic hybrid meson would have @xmath1 .",
    "the preliminary study presented here was conducted using @xmath65-quarks",
    ". quenched lattice studies of the qcd spectrum suggest that quark mass effects in the meson mass ( or mass squared ) are well described by a term linear in the quark mass .",
    "experimental meson masses are consistent with the ansatz that @xmath72 gev@xmath73 where @xmath74 means @xmath63 or @xmath64 .",
    "this suggests that the @xmath63 , @xmath64 mesons will be around 160  mev lighter than the @xmath75 mesons for masses around 1.5 gev .",
    "note that these lattice studies are for mesons made from two quarks of equal mass which are thus eigenstates of @xmath76 . for unequal masses ( eg .",
    "strange mesons ) the lack of @xmath76 invariance masks the identification of spin exotic states .",
    "there have been several experimental claims for hybrid mesons - for reviews see refs@xcite .",
    "our results suggest that non spin - exotic candidates may need re - appraisal since big mixing effects are possible . for the exotic mesons ,",
    "the favoured candidate to lie lowest will have @xmath1 and several experimental hints of such states have been reported .",
    "we have summarised quenched lattice predictions for glueballs and hybrid mesons .",
    "recent developments include an estimate of glueball decay widths and a first study of light quark hybrid mesons .",
    "the study of the light quark hybrid mesons with considerable greater statistics is currently under way .",
    "the qualitative features from such predictions are an essential guide to the experimental exploration of such mesons .",
    "lattice studies with dynamical quarks will enable better control of the systematic error from quenching - this is also in progress .",
