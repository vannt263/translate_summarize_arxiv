    "einstein s general theory of relativity has successfully accounted for various observations cosmological scales as well as in astrophysical contexts@xcite .",
    "the golden age of cosmology has seen the theory fine - tuned to a high degree of accuracy in explaining the hubble rate , matter content , baryogenesis , nucleosynthesis , as well as the possible origin and subsequent evolution of the universe .",
    "general relativity , as an extension of newtonian gravity is especially useful in describing compact objects in which the gravitational fields are very strong .",
    "some of these objects include neutron stars , pulsars and black holes where densities are of the order of @xmath0 or greater .",
    "the first exact solution of the einstein field equations representing a bounded matter distribution was provided by schwarzschild in 1916@xcite .",
    "this solution described a constant density sphere with the exterior being empty .",
    "the constant density schwarzschild solution was a toy model which cast light on the continuity of the gravitational potentials and the behaviour of the pressure at the surface of the star . however , the interior schwarzschild solution was noncausal in the sense that it allowed for faster then light propagation velocities within the stellar interior .",
    "this prompted the search for physically viable solutions of the einstein field equations describing realistic stars .",
    "a century later and we have thousands of exact solutions of the field equations describing a multitude of stellar objects ranging from perfect fluids , charged bodies , anisotropic matter distributions , higher dimensional stars and exotic matter configurations .",
    "spherical symmetry is the most natural assumption to describe stellar objects . however , there is a wide range of stellar solutions exhibiting departure from sphericity .",
    "these solutions include the kerr metric which describes the exterior gravitational field of a rotating stellar object@xcite . in the limit of vanishing angular momentum",
    ", the kerr solution reduces to the exterior schwarzschild solution .",
    "there have also been numerous attempts at extending the kerr metric to allow for dissipation and rotation@xcite .    in order to generate exact solutions of the einstein field equations ,",
    "researchers have employed a wide range of techniques to close this system of highly nonlinear , coupled partial differential equations . in the quest to obtain exact solutions describing static compact objects",
    "one imposes ( i ) symmetry requirements such as spherical symmetry , ( ii ) an equation of state relating the pressure and energy density of the stellar fluid , ( iii ) the behaviour of the pressure anisotropy or isotropy , ( iv ) vanishing of the weyl stresses , ( v ) spacetime dimensionality , to name just a few@xcite .",
    "these assumptions render the problem of finding exact solutions of the field equations mathematically more tractable .",
    "there is no guarantee that the resulting stellar model actually describes a physically realizable stellar structure . in the case of nonstatic , radiating stars ,",
    "various exact solutions are known in the literature ranging from acceleration - free collapse , weyl - free collapse , vanishing of shear , collapse from / to an initial / final static configuration as well as anisotropic collapse models .",
    "the randall - sundrum braneworld scenario has generated an intense interest in higher dimensional gravity and modified theories of gravity@xcite .",

    "govender and dadhich showed that the gravitational collapse of a star on the brane is accompanied by weyl radiation@xcite .",
    "they concluded that a collapsing sphere on the brane is enveloped by the brane generalised vaidya solution which is in turn matched to the reissner - nordstrom metric .",
    "the mediation of the vaidya envelope is a unique feature of the braneworld collapse which is not present in standard 4-d einstein gravity . a recent model by banerjee et al",

    ", they ask a pertinent question : `` do we really live in four dimensions or higher ? ''",
    "this question arises from the fact that while gravity is free to propagate in higher dimensions while all other matter fields are confined to 4-dimensions , gravity can not distinguish between 4-d einstein or in particular , 7-d pure gauss - bonnet dynamics@xcite .",
    "the idea of embedding a purely gravitational field represented by a 4-dimensional riemannian metric into a flat space of higher dimensions has resurrected interest in so - called class one spacetimes .",
    "karmarkar derived the necessary condition for a general spherically symmetric metric to be of class one@xcite . in general , if the lowest number of dimensions of flat space in which a riemannian space of dimension @xmath2 can be embedded in @xmath3 , then the riemannian space is referred to as class @xmath4 .",

    "we may then interpret @xmath2 as a stabilizing factor .",
    "the variation of charge with @xmath2 suggests that lower values of @xmath2 imply lower charge which in turn means smaller electromagnetic repulsion .",

    "in addition , the equation of state of these models is of the form @xmath179 giving rise to negative pressure .",
    "the solution obtained in this work relaxes this particular equation of state , allowing for positive pressure .",
    "the gravitational and thermodynamical behaviour of our model is controlled by a parameter @xmath2 .",

    "we use a novel approach of embedding a spherically symmetric , static metric in schwarzschild coordinates into a five - dimensional flat metric .",
    "this embedding is equivalent to the karmarkar condition : the requirement for a spherically symmetric metric to be of embedding class 1 .",
    "the condition obtained from this embedding relates the gravitational potentials thus reducing the problem of finding an exact solution of the einstein - maxwell field equations to a single - generating function . by specifying one of the gravitational potentials on physical grounds , we obtain the second potential which completely describes the gravitational behaviour of the compact object .",
    "the junction conditions required for the smooth matching of the interior spacetime to the exterior reissner - no@xmath87dstrom spacetime fixes the constants in our solution and determines the mass contained within the charged sphere .",
    "our model displays many salient features which are bodes well for describing a compact , self - gravitating object .",
    "graphical analysis of the solution shows that the density and pressure are monotonically decreasing functions of the radial coordinate .",
    "the pressure vanishes at some finite radius .",
    "this indicates that our solution can be utilised to describe a bounded object unlike the kohler - chao solution which arises from imposition of the karmarkar condition together with pressure isotropy .",
    "causality is obeyed at each interior point of the configuration .",
    "stability analysis via the adiabatic index and the harrison - zeldovich - novikov static stability criterion indicate that our model is stable .",
    "analysis of the variation of charge with the radial coordinate reveals an interesting characteristic of our model .",
    "the charge increases with the parameter @xmath163 .",
    "this increase is largest towards the surface layers of the charged object becoming simultaneously indistinguishable for very large values at the surface .",
    "this implies that the surface layers are more stable ( larger repulsive forces here ) than inner core layers .",
    "this differentiated stability may lead to anisotropic collapse or the subsequent cracking of the sphere should this object starts to collapse .",
    "this phenomenon has not been discussed elsewhere in the literature .",
    "the influence of the parameter @xmath2 is clearly drawn out in tables 1 - 6 .",
    "shows that our theoretical model describes compact objects to a very good degree of accuracy with regards to observed masses and radii of stars .",
    "tables 3 to 5 clearly show that variations in the model parameters stabilise for very large @xmath2 .",
    "table 6 . illustrates the influence of the parameter @xmath2 on the central density , surface density , central pressure and surface redshift .",
    "it is clear that for very large @xmath2 variations in these physical quantities tend to zero .",
    "this feature indicates that the parameter @xmath2 can be viewed as a building constant , that is to say , that an increase in @xmath2 is accompanied by an increase in mass , radius and charge which builds up the star from @xmath180 through to the surface . in this work",
    "we have utilised @xmath58 and the case @xmath181 was studied by @xcite .",
    "future work has been initiated to consider the case of general @xmath2 .",
