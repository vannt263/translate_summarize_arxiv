    "diffusion in polymer solutions is among the oldest subjects of polymer physics .",
    "@xcite in general , transport by diffusion can be characterized by two diffusion coefficients : the self - diffusion coefficient @xmath0 and the cooperative diffusion coefficient @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath0 describes the motion of one molecule relative to the surrounding molecules due to thermal motions while @xmath1 describes the motion of a number of molecules in a density gradient .",
    "@xcite the obvious importance of diffusion in polymer physics has led to a rather large number of studies of @xmath1 by dynamic light scattering ( dls ) , @xcite while @xmath0 can be obtained by pulsed - field gradient nuclear magnetic resonance @xcite and label techniques like forced rayleigh scattering @xcite or fluorescence correlation spectroscopy ( fcs ) .",
    "@xcite however , in many cases @xmath0 and @xmath1 could not be obtained for the same homopolymer using the same technique .",
    "such measurements would be very interesting since a central problem in the dynamics of semidilute entangled polymer solutions is the quantitative understanding of the interplay of self - diffusion and cooperative diffusion .",
    "very recently it has been found theoretically that the coupling of self- and cooperative motion due to topological constraints is also important for rather stiff macromolecules .",
    "@xcite    at present , dls is certainly among the most accurate methods to measure @xmath1 and there is a number of careful studies conducted on polymer solutions . in principle , fcs is the method of choice for studying diffusion of single macromolecules in a matrix of same molecular weight giving @xmath0 or in a solution of polymers of different molecular weight ( tracer diffusion @xcite ) . in opposite to dls , fcs requires chains labeled by a stable fluorescing molecule .",
    "moreover , the number of labels per macromolecules should be constant to arrive at results that can be directly compared to theory . given these problems , the use of fcs for measurements of @xmath0 on synthetic polymers has been scarce so far .",
    "@xcite moreover , the full potential of this method has not yet fully been exploited yet since fcs should also allow one to obtain @xmath1 .",
    "@xcite    recently , a well - defined polymeric model system has been presented and used for quantitative fcs - measurements in dilute solution : @xcite nearly monodisperse polystyrene chains have been prepared by anionic polymerization and subsequently labeled by single fluorescent dye .",
    "since the molecular weight of the different samples span a wide range , these polymers provide a nearly ideal model system for exploring the chain dynamics over a wide range of molecular weights and concentrations . using these labeled chains",
    ", we recently presented an in - depth study of the experimental fcs set - up @xcite as well as of the dynamics in dilute solution .",
    "@xcite    here we pursue these studies further by presenting an investigation of polymer diffusion in the semi - concentrated regime by fcs . in order to obtain accurate data of cooperative diffusion ,",
    "these studies are combine with dls - measurements on exactly the same molecular weights and concentrations .",
    "thus , @xmath1 and @xmath0 can now be obtained from identical systems and directly be compared . in the course of these studies we found that a second cooperative mode becomes visible in the fcs - experiments if the concentration exceeds a given value .",
    "this surprising finding prompted us to conduct a full theoretical analysis of both the fcs- as well of the dls - data throughout the entire time scale and range of concentrations available by these experiments .",
    "in doing so we extend the theoretical modeling beyond the usual scaling laws .",
    "the entire study is devoted to a comprehensive understanding of polymer dynamics in solution ranging from the dilute state up to the onset of glassy dynamics .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : after the section experimental we first present the fcs - data together with the finding of the new cooperative diffusion . in the subsequent section a quantitative modeling of the data in terms of an analytical theory",
    "will be given .",
    "in the last section special attention will be paid to possible practical applications of these findings to the spinning of nanofibers .",
    "a conclusion will wrap up the entire discussion .",
    "all experiments reported here were carried out with linear polystyrenes having a narrow molecular weight distribution . for details of the synthesis",
    "see ref @xcite .",
    "the molecular weight and polydispersity of the polymers are summarized in table  [ ps ] .",
    "the solutions for the fcs experiments were prepared in toluene p.  a.  grade by blending a constant concentration of @xmath2 rhodamine  b labeled polystyrene with varying amounts of unlabeled polystyrene from the same synthesis batch .",
    "each labeled polymer carries only one dye molecule at one of its ends . to verify our results ,",
    "additional solutions were prepared with varying labeled polystyrene and a constant amount of unlabeled polystyrene .",
    "we have used preparative gel permeation chromatography to separate labeled polymer and free dye molecules .",

    "various theoretical predictions on the time dependence of the monomer mean square displacement of both continuously and single labeled dna molecules in aqueous solution have been verified using fcs measurements .",
    "@xcite in these earlier experimental and theoretical studies the @xmath89 condition has been considered . however , for ps in toluene solutions the intramolecular excluded volume interaction has to be taken into account . in this case",

    "the experimental data ( solid squares ) follow the scaling law given by eq [ eq12 ] ( dotted line ) and the diffusive behavior ( lower dashed line ) for short and large times , respectively .",
    "hence for short times the decay of the autocorrelation function is dominated by intramolecular chain relaxations , while self - diffusion dominates for large times .",

    "it is apparent from figure [ fig6 ] that the contribution of internal chain motions can not be observed in the case of the 17 kg / mol ps chains in dilute solution ( solid triangles ) because of the dominating diffusive motion ( upper dashed line ) .",
    "the self - diffusion coefficient @xmath0 increases upon decreasing molecular weight according to eq [ eq9 ] , while @xmath95 is less dependent on molecular weight . finally , it is worthwhile to mention the contribution of internal chain motions to the dynamics decreases upon increasing the polymer concentration because of the presence of the surrounding polymer chains .",
    "@xcite      we now turn our attention to the scaling law for the cooperative diffusion coefficient given by eq [ eq10 ] .",
    "figure [ fig7 ] displays the cooperative diffusion coefficient @xmath1 of the 515 kg / mol ps solution ( solid squares ) together with the scaling law ( dashed line ) as a function of the concentration .",

    "@xcite successful models should incorporate the transition region between the dilute regime and the semidilute regimes . in the next subsection we provide a quantitative basis for such a modelling of cooperative dynamical properties of polymer chains in good solution .",

    "this radius of gyration is about larger than corresponding radii of gyration of ps in various good solvents . @xcite the deviation between the radius of gyration used in the calculations and the radii of gyration reported in the literature might be due to the fact that the hydrodynamic interaction has been taken into account in terms of the oseen tensor in order to derive eq [ eq15 ] .",
    "using the rotne - prager tensor @xcite as a first correction to the oseen tensor will improve the results .",

    "hence , it provides the explanation for the finding of a cooperative mode in the fcs - experiment . the topological interaction in semidilute",
    "entangled polymer solutions seriously affects dynamical properties since it imposes constraints on the motion of the polymers .",
    "when the motion of a single polymer chain is partly hindered by the presence of other chains the cooperative diffusion becomes highly correlated and can be studied using only a small fraction of labeled molecules .",
    "moreover , the number of molecules statistically involved in the correlated dynamics increases considerably upon approaching the glass transition concentration .",
    "figures [ fig8 ] ( a ) and ( b ) display the function @xmath144 for the 17 kg / mol ps chains and the 515 kg / mol ps chains in dilute solution ( solid squares , ) and in semidilute solution ( solid triangles , ) . for the 17 kg / mol ps chains only self - diffusion can be measured using fcs irrespective of the concentration ( see figure [ fig8 ] ( a ) ) because of insufficient chain overlap . in the case of the 515 kg / mol ps chains self - diffusion",
    "dominates for large times as is indicated by the dashed lines in figure [ fig8 ] ( b ) . the cooperative diffusion observed in the semidilute entangled solution ( solid triangles in figure [ fig8 ] ( b ) ) dominates the autocorrelation function on the same time scale as intramolecular chain relaxations in the case of a dilute solution ( solid squares in figure [ fig8 ] ( b ) ) .",
    "hence one may conclude that upon increasing the polymer concentration the contribution of internal chain motions to the single chain dynamics decreases while the contribution of the cooperative motions increases because of the fluctuations of the surrounding polymer chains .",
    "both types of dynamics are observable on the same time scale but in different concentration regimes for high molecular weight ps chains . in the case of internal chain motions the dynamics",
    "is driven by fluctuations of the solvent while fluctuations of the surrounding polymer network induce the cooperative dynamics .",

    "some concentration fluctuations may be frozen in by the entanglements .",

    "the direct dls measurement of the slow relaxation confirms our earlier remark that cooperative diffusion becomes highly correlated in the transient entanglement network and can be studied using only a small fraction of labeled polymer chains within fcs . as is illustrated in figure [ fig12 ] ( b ) unlabeled polymer chains ( see , e.g. , the polymer chain denoted by the index 1 ) and labeled polymer chains ( see , e.g. , the polymer chain denoted by the index 2 ) move in a coherent manner due to entanglements into the fcs observation volume enclosed by the grey ellipsoidal lines .",
    "the resulting temporal fluctuations of fluorescence light emitted by labeled polymer chains can be detected by fcs in terms of the cooperative diffusion .",
    "a spherical volume of mean size equivalent to the radius of gyration of an individual polymer chain contains about 15 polymer chains at the concentration @xmath54 at which cooperative diffusion is measured with fcs .",
    "consequently , neighbouring chains strongly interpenetrate and entangle with each other leading to highly cooperative motions in this correlated state . without entanglements cooperative diffusion",
    "can not be detected if only a small fraction of the polymer chains are labeled due to insufficient chain overlap .",
    "hence in dilute and semidilute unentangled solutions the unlabeled polymer chain denoted by 1 in figure [ fig12 ] ( a ) moves from left to right into the fcs observation volume nearly without influencing the remaining labeled and unlabeled polymer chains .          upon approaching the glass transition concentration of ps in toluene , @xcite the dynamics of the polymer chains slows down considerably ( see ref @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "a first signature of this slowing down is given by the deviations of the measured cooperative diffusion coefficients @xmath1 from the solid line at high concentrations in fig [ fig7 ] .",
    "the cooperative diffusion coefficient decreases by more than three decades as compared to its maximum value upon further increasing the concentration ( see fig 6 in ref @xcite ) .",
    "a second signature of the onset of glassy dynamics is given by the shape of the autocorrelation function @xmath72 measured with fcs .",

    "the understanding of dynamical properties of semidilute entangled polymer solutions is also important for various technological relevant applications . as an example we discuss the formation of nanofibers from polymer solutions .",
    "polymer nanofibers are attractive building blocks for functional nanoscale devices .",
    "they are promising candidates for various applications , including filtration , protective clothing , polymer batteries , sensors , and tissue engineering .",
    "@xcite electrospinning is one of the most established fiber fabrication methods and has attracted much attention due to the ease by which nanofibers can be produced from polymer solutions .",
    "@xcite fibers produced by this approach are at least one or two orders of magnitude smaller in diameter than those produced by conventional fiber production methods like melt or solution spinning . in a typical electrospinning process",
    "a jet is ejected from the surface of a charged polymer solution when the applied electric field strength overcomes the surface tension .",
    "the ejected jet travels rapidly to the collector target located at some distance from the charged polymer solution under the influence of the electric field and becomes collected in the form of a solid polymer nanofiber .",
    "however , this method requires a dc voltage in the kv range and high fiber production rates are difficult to achieve because only a single fiber emerges from the nozzle of the pipet holding the polymer solution .",
    "@xcite in order to overcome these deficiencies an efficient procedure enabling the parallel fabrication of a multitude of polymer fibers with regular morphology and diameters as small as 25 nm has been reported recently . @xcite",
    "it involves the application of drops of a polymer solution onto a standard spin coater , followed by fast rotation of the chuck , without the need of a mechanical constriction .",
    "the fiber formation relies upon the instability of the spin - coated liquid film that arises due to a competition of the centrifugal force and the laplace force induced by the surface curvature .",

    "moreover , the cooperative diffusion coefficient @xmath1 in the semidilute entangled regime becomes accessible as well which is ascribed to an * effective * long - range interaction of the labeled chains in the transient entanglement network .",
    "the self - diffusion coefficients @xmath0 can be determined from the cooperative diffusion coefficient @xmath1 obtained by dynamic light scattering measurements and vice versa according to eqs [ eq6 ] and [ eq7 ] .",
