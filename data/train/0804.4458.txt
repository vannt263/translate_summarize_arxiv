    "the @xmath5 k superconductor sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 @xcite is widely believed to be a rare example of a spin - triplet cooper paired system @xcite . unlike heavy fermion materials which are possible candidates for spin triplet pairing ( such as upt@xmath6 )",
    "there are no @xmath7 or @xmath8 heavy elements in the unit cell , and so the effects of spin - orbit coupling should be relatively weak . in this respect",
    "paring in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 should be closely analogous to the case of superfluid @xmath9he .",
    "one should expect that weak or moderate @xmath10-fields would be able to rotate the d - vector order parameter and induce domain walls , textures and other topological defects .",
    "as in the case of @xmath11 , the experimental observation of such d - vector rotations would be a decisive test of the pairing symmetry .",
    "systematic study of such rotations as a function of various physical parameters would both confirm the pairing symmetry and also place strong constraints on the pairing mechanism and microscopic hamiltonian parameters .",
    "one of the strongest pieces of evidence for spin triplet cooper pairing in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 was the observation that the electronic spin susceptibility @xmath12 remained constant below @xmath13 for magnetic fields in the a - b plane @xcite .",
    "this observation is inconsistent with a spin - singlet pairing state ( @xmath14 or @xmath15-wave ) for which @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the normal state pauli spin susceptibility and @xmath18 is the yoshida function . on the other hand the observations would be immediately consistent with a chiral symmetry paring state of the form @xmath19 which below we shall refer to as pairing state @xmath20 .",
    "for such a pairing state is is well known @xcite that the spin susceptibility has the following tensor form @xmath21 and so the susceptibility tensor is constant as a function of @xmath22 for field directions perpendicular to the @xmath23 vector .",
    "the @xmath24 knight shift experiments performed in ( ab ) plane magnetic fields @xcite and neutron scattering experiments @xcite both observed a constant susceptibility below @xmath13 , a result which _ uniquely _ points to a chiral triplet paring state with @xmath25 .",
    "more recently murakawa _",
    "@xcite have measured the @xmath26ru - knight shift of sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 in a superconducting state under the influence of magnetic field parallel to the c - axis . in contradiction to expectations from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : chiral - a ] ) and ( [ eq : chi - a ] ) they found that its value is _ also unchanged from the normal state value below _",
    "they remarked that this result would be consistent with eq .",
    "( [ eq : chi - a ] ) only if it is assumed that the @xmath23 vector rotates away from the @xmath27 direction under the influence of the external field . such a rotation of the @xmath23 vector is well known in the case of superfluid @xmath9he - a @xcite , where to minimize free energy @xmath23 orients itself perpendicular to the external field unless pinned by surface effects .",
    "however , in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 it is expected that spin - orbit coupling would fix the chiral state @xmath23 vector to the crystal c - axis @xcite .",
    "_ @xcite were able to measure @xmath12 down to fields as low as @xmath3 mt at @xmath28 mk , showing that it was equal to @xmath17 to within experimental accuracy at all temperatures and fields measured below @xmath29 ( @xmath30 mt for c - axis fields ) .",
    "the implication of this result , that @xmath23 vector rotation must occur at below @xmath3 mt , therefore places very strong constraints on the strength of pinning by the spin - orbit coupling .    in this work",
    "we examine the combined effects of spin - orbit coupling and c - axis magnetic field on the chiral state of sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 .",
    "we show that a realistic physical model , which we have previously shown to be consistent with a wide range of experimental data , allows us to find reasonable parameter ranges where the chiral state eq .",
    "( [ eq : chiral - a ] ) is stable in zero field , but where a transition to another state occurs even for fields of order @xmath3 mt or smaller .",
    "the minimum energy states in finite c - axis field are not simply the chiral state with @xmath23 vector rotated to the @xmath4 plane , but rather are non - chiral pairing states of the form @xmath31 on the @xmath32 fermi surface sheet ( which below we refer to as @xmath33 and @xmath34 respectively ) .",
    "the spin susceptibility for either of these states is of the form @xcite @xmath35 corresponding to constant spin susceptibility for c - axis fields consistent with the results of murakawa _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite .    since these states are symmetry distinct from the chiral state eq .",
    "( [ eq : chiral - a ] ) the transition from one to another should occur at a finite external field , @xmath36 , and it should be accompanied by a finite entropy change @xmath37 .",
    "below we map out a generic phase diagram for the transitions between pairing states of sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 in a c - axis field , assuming parameter values consistent with the murakawa s _ et al .",
    "_ experiments @xcite .",
    "we also estimate the entropy change associated with the transition , and comment on its experimental observability .",
    "our preliminary results have been presented in @xcite .",
    "as the pairing mechanism operating in the strontium ruthenate superconductor is not known @xcite it is important to understand the experiments on the basis of semi - phenomenological models @xcite .",
    "specifically we write the effective pairing hamiltonian as @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 refer to the three ru @xmath41 orbitals @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 , and @xmath45 and @xmath46 label the sites of a body centered tetragonal lattice .",
    "the hopping integrals @xmath47 and site energies @xmath48 were fitted to reproduce the experimentally determined fermi surface @xcite .",
    "@xmath49 is the effective ru 4d spin - orbit coupling parameter , and the effective hubbard parameters @xmath50 are generally both spin @xcite and orbital dependent @xcite .",
    "our approach is based on self consistent solution of the bogolubov - degennes equations for the model ( [ hubbard ] ) in the spin triplet channel for each possible symmetry distinct order parameter .",
    "we have shown elsewhere @xcite that a minimal realistic model requires two hubbard @xmath51 parameters : @xmath52 for nearest neighbor in - plane interactions between ru @xmath53 orbitals ( corresponding to the @xmath32 fermi surface sheet ) and @xmath54 for out of plane nearest neighbor interactions between ru @xmath55 and @xmath56 orbitals ( corresponding to the @xmath57 and @xmath58 fermi surface sheets ) . when these two parameters are chosen to be spin independent constants ( for @xmath59 ) and to give the experimental @xmath60k on all three @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath32 fermi surface sheets , then the calculated specific heat , thermal conductivity and @xmath4 plane penetration depth are in very good agreement with experiments @xcite .",
    "figure ( [ fig : chi ] ) shows the susceptibilities calculated within the model for the ( a ) and ( b ) states with the symmetries given by eqs .",
    "[ eq : chiral - a ] and [ eq : deltab ] . for the chiral state ( a ) the triplet d - vector is defined in all 3 bands as @xmath61 , with @xmath62 denoting contributions from different orbitals which are given by @xmath63 for the ru @xmath64 orbitals and , @xmath65for @xmath66 corresponding to the ru @xmath55 and @xmath56 orbitals @xcite .",
    "the susceptibility results , for the chiral ( a ) state show that the dependence of @xmath67 for c - axis b - fields is is relatively structureless .",
    "the relevant yoshida function @xmath18 is equal to unity at @xmath68 and drops essentially linearly to zero at @xmath69 , consistent with the expectation from eq.[eq : chi - a ] and the existence of the horizontal line node in the gap on @xmath57 and @xmath58 @xcite . in contrast , we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : chi ] that for the non - chiral ( b ) pairing state the susceptibility for a - axis b - fields decreases approximately linearly towards @xmath70 at @xmath69 , again consistent with the expectations of eq .",
    "[ eq : chi - bc ] .",
    "these results confirm that in spite of very complicated character of the order parameter ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) having zeros on the @xmath57 and @xmath58 sheets of the fermi surface , the overall behavior of the calculated susceptibility tensor is consistent with the expectations from superfluid @xmath71 @xcite .    in zero magnetic field , but in the presence of non - zero spin - orbit interaction @xmath49 the model predicts that the ground state is the chiral state @xmath20 with d - vector along the crystal c - axis , provided that the spin - orbit coupling leads to a small spin dependence of the effective pairing interaction @xcite . choosing @xmath72 about 1% larger than @xmath73 is sufficient to stabilize the chiral state even for large spin orbit coupling .",
    "in contrast , for spin - independent interactions , @xmath74 , the alternative pairing states @xmath33 and @xmath34 ( @xmath75 and @xmath76 @xcite ) are the ground states for any value of @xmath77 ( @xmath78 ) @xcite .",
    "in fig .  [ fig2 ] we show the free energies of the @xmath20 @xmath33 and @xmath34 symmetry pairing states as a function of external magnetic field both for @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "the model parameters were chosen to make the chiral state @xmath20 stable at zero field .",
    "for the field in ab - plane the free energy of the chiral state @xmath20 increases with field more slowly than for the @xmath33 and @xmath34 states .",
    "this means that in large in - plane fields the @xmath20 state becomes relatively more stable than @xmath33 or @xmath34 . on the other hand , in an c - axis field",
    "the chiral phase increases its free energy much faster than the other phases , until at a certain critical field , @xmath36 , the @xmath33 or @xmath34 solutions become more stable . therefore at the field @xmath36",
    "we expect a `` spin flop '' type phase transition from a d - vector oriented along the @xmath2-axis to one where the d - vector lies in the @xmath4 plane . for the parameter values used in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] this critical field is @xmath81 mt . to one where the d - vector lies in the @xmath4 plane .",
    "for the parameter values used in    this prediction is consistent with what one expects from the analogous superfluid state in @xmath11-a . in bulk",
    "@xmath11 there is no preferred symmetry direction in space and so the d - vector simply rotates continuously to remain perpendicular to the applied field .",
    "but in thin films the d - vector is pinned , and only rotates at a finite critical field , known as the freedericksz transition @xcite . in the case of sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1",
    "the transition is not simply a rotation of the chiral d - vector but is also a transition from a chiral to non - chiral pairing state of different symmetry .",
    "the two distinct solutions shown in fig .  [ fig2 ] ( note that @xmath33 and @xmath34 are essentially degenerate ) have different entropies and hence this freedericksz - like spin - flop is a first order thermodynamic phase transition .",
    "one can also ask whether the specific case of fig  [ fig2 ] is typical for a general set of model parameters . in our effective hubbard model",
    "the spin - orbit interaction enters the hamiltonian both directly _ via _ @xmath49 in eq .",
    "( [ hubbard ] ) , and also in the spin dependent pairing potential @xmath82 .",
    "these are not really independent , since a full theory , such as a spin fluctuation model @xcite , would include both effects on the same footing . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we show a part of the full phase diagram of our model @xcite for a specific choice of the parameters @xmath49 and @xmath82 .",
    "the inset shows the effect of the c - axis magnetic field in shifting the phase boundary between the chiral state @xmath20 and the alternative @xmath33 and @xmath34 states . at any point in the phase diagram where @xmath20 is stable for zero field",
    ", there is a definite critical field for which the spin flop to @xmath33 or @xmath34 takes place .",
    "however it is only a small region of the phase diagram , close to the @xmath83 phase boundary , where the transition takes place in fields as small as @xmath84 mt .",
    "the implications of the murakawa _ et al .",
    "_ experiment @xcite are that the parameters do indeed lie in this region .",
    "the alternative , is that the spin flop only takes place at a much larger field , and thus would never be observed in any c - axis field below @xmath85 mt , in contradiction to the simplest interpretation of murakawa _ et al .",
    "_ s result .",
    "if the relevant parameters do allow the d - vector rotation to occur in a relatively low field , then we expect a phase diagram similar to fig .",
    "this hypothesis makes a definite and clear testable prediction , namely the existence of a new first order phase boundary in the @xmath86 plane , which has not yet been observed . a phase diagram of the type shown in fig .  [ fig4 ]",
    "is required from the experiments @xcite .",
    "the nqr experiments @xcite indicate the state with d - vector lying in the ( ab ) plane is realized in a c - axis magnetic field of order @xmath87 mt and larger , and that this d - vector orientation must be present at these fields for all temperatures below @xmath13 . on the other hand",
    "the nonzero kerr signal obtained at fields around @xmath88 mt @xcite ( see the points in fig .",
    "( 3a ) of this reference and the corresponding discussion in the text ) is a clear indication that at these fields the chiral state is stable . accepting the usual interpretations of these two experiments one",
    "is forced to accept the general structure of the phase diagram as in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] as the simplest picture which is consistent with both experiments , with a possible margin of uncertainty of about @xmath88 mt in the position of the @xmath89 transition line .",
    "an obvious question is why has the predicted phase transition in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] not been observed experimentally ?",
    "experimental data @xcite show multiple superconducting phases at the magnetic field parallel to the ( ab ) plane , but none have been reported for fields along the c - axis .",
    "the answer to this question we suggest is that the phases in question have essentially identical values of the quasi - particle energy gap , @xmath90 on the fermi surface , and therefore to a very high level of accuracy they have essentially identical entropy .",
    "this is because to leading order only the direction of @xmath91 changes at each point on the fermi surface , and not its magnitude . to confirm this",
    "we have calculated the entropy change along the transition line @xmath87 mt and this is shown in the fig .",
    "the total change in entropy is very small , of order @xmath92 per formula unit , suggesting that it might not have been detected in specific heat experiments .",
    "the entropy change in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] corresponds to a latent heat of at most @xmath93mj / mol , compared to the zero field specific heat jump @xmath94 of about @xmath95mj / k@xmath96mol at @xmath60k @xcite . assuming that lattice strain or inhomogeneity leads to some smearing of the ideal first order phase transition this small entropy change could easily be masked by the experimental noise",
    "we should note that in the present calculations we have included the influence of the magnetic field in the zeeman energies only and neglected the orbital effects altogether .",
    "this means that the vortex contribution to the condensation energy of both the ( a ) and ( b ) phases is assumed to be the same .",
    "there is no reason to expect a significantly different vortex lattice response in the different phases , since the only changes are in the direction of @xmath91 on the fermi surface and not in its magnitude @xmath90 .",
    "as mentioned above , the experiments @xcite indicate that the region where the chiral @xmath20 state is stable is restricted to the low field part of the @xmath86 plane below a critical field which must be in the range of about @xmath97 mt .",
    "this places a number of constraints on the possible parameter values which we can use in our model hamiltonian .    using our model hamiltonian , eq .",
    "[ hubbard ] , we can ask what are the possible values of the spin - dependent pairing interaction needed to qualitatively describe both experiments . in our model",
    "this is the ratio @xmath98 for opposite spin pairing compared to equal spin pairing .",
    "the other model parameters are fixed beforehand , including the known band structure and the values of interaction parameters @xmath52 and @xmath54 which were previously fitted to other experiments @xcite . for simplicity we have taken the spin - orbit coupling to have a fixed value , @xmath99 , where @xmath100 is the @xmath32 band in - plane nearest neighbor hopping integral in our tight binding band structure fit .    with all other parameters fixed , we then calculate the minimum spin dependent interaction enhancement @xmath82 required to stabilize the chiral state in magnetic fields of up to @xmath87 mt . it turns out that this minimal value of @xmath82 changes with temperature , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_upr ] .    the temperature dependence of @xmath82 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_upr ] arises because the condensation energies calculated for a given value of @xmath82 for @xmath20 and @xmath33 states cross as function of temperature as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_fab ] . for a small value of @xmath82 for which the @xmath33 state will be stable at low temperatures",
    ", we find that this state is destabilized relative to the chiral state closer to @xmath13 .",
    "let us stress that the model we are using is , in principle at least , valid for arbitrarily large spin - orbit coupling .",
    "however , the parametrization of the fermi surface which we have used ceases to be valid for @xmath101 .",
    "therefore in order not to refit the normal state band structure for every value of @xmath49 we have limited the calculations to small values of @xmath49 .",
    "in fact most of the calculations presented in this work have been done for @xmath102 .",
    "this restricted choice does not limit the validity of our conclusions , because for every value of the spin - orbit coupling parameter , @xmath49 , it is possible to find a corresponding value of @xmath82 which will stabilize the chiral state at @xmath103 as discussed earlier ( _ c.f . _ fig . [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "close enough to this boundary of stability a c - axis magnetic field will rotate the d - vector and stabilize one of the other four states @xcite independently of the sign or magnitude of @xmath49 .",
    "this minimal value of @xmath82 depends not only on @xmath49 and @xmath10 but also on temperature , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_upr ] .",
    "however , this uncertainty in the value of @xmath82 precludes an unique theoretical determination of the phase diagram on the @xmath86 plane without additional assumptions .    assuming a constant ( _ i.e. _ temperature independent ) value of @xmath82 which leads to stabilization of the chiral phase at the lowest temperatures would lead to a h - t phase diagram with the chiral phase occupying most of it .",
    "the non - chiral state would be limited to low temperature - high field corner .",
    "other assumptions about the temperature dependence of @xmath82 could produce different topology phase diagrams . rather than try to explore all these possibilities",
    "we simply assume that the boundary between the stable phases at low c - axis fields is given by a line at approximately @xmath104 mt ( shown in fig .  [ fig2 ] ) as dictated by experiment . from this assumption",
    "we have then calculated the corresponding temperature dependence of the minimal anisotropy @xmath82 which is necessary to stabilize the a - phase along the line ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_upr ] ) .",
    "we find this approach more direct than trying to determine the expected temperature dependence of @xmath82 _ a priori _ from a spin fluctuation feedback mechanisms @xcite stabilizing chiral phase .",
    "we note that our effective pairing hubbard model does not really include the full self - consistent effects of spin fluctuation feedback @xcite , which could make the effective pairing interactions @xmath51 and/or @xmath105 temperature dependent .",
    "however , the predicted phase transition places severe constraints on the superconducting pairing mechanism when one takes into account a sizable spin - orbit coupling and the detrimental effect of the c - axis b - field on the chiral phase .",
    "to summarize , we have explored the role played by spin - orbit coupling in determining the superconducting states of strontium ruthenate in the presence of c - axis and ab - plane oriented magnetic fields .",
    "we showed that the d - vector rotation can provide a consistent interpretation of both the nqr and kerr effect data , provided the spin - orbit coupling constant @xmath49 is small enough .",
    "unfortunately , lda estimates of @xmath49 are significantly larger than the values we have assumed in the calculations presented here@xcite .",
    "a large value of spin - orbit coupling has previously been cited as evidence against the d - vector rotation picture @xcite . despite these objections ,",
    "it is clear from our results that even for large values of @xmath49 the transition field @xmath36 for d - vector rotation , in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , can lie within experimental constraints @xcite , but only if the pairing interaction spin anisotropy @xmath82 is such as to make the free energy difference between ( a ) and ( b ) phases finely balanced so that a small field of order @xmath3 mt is sufficient to cause the d - vector rotation .",
    "we have shown that for any value of @xmath49 there is corresponding anisotropy @xmath82 such that this balance can be achieved .",
    "it is possible that such balancing is a consequence of a spin - fluctuation feedback mechanism @xcite , or emerges directly from the full microscopic spin fluctuation theory .",
    "but in the absence of a detailed theory of this effect further progress in the field must await experimental measurement of the effective spin - orbit parameter for the quasiparticles at the fermi surface .",
