    "@xcite , the bosonic hubbard model ( bhm ) and its variants have attracted a great deal of attention due to the rich physics and wide variety of phases and phase transitions it exhibits : incompressible mott insulator ( mi ) , superfluid ( sf ) , bose glass in the presence of disorder @xcite ; charge density wave ( cdw ) , supersolid ( ss ) and phase separation in the presence of longer range repulsion @xcite .",
    "interest intensified when trapped atomic condensates where loaded in optical lattices @xcite where it was shown that the system is governed by the bhm @xcite .",
    "the high tunability of the interaction strengths , the wide range of lattice geometries that can be realized and the ability to perform very detailed measurements offered access to a very wide range systems and tight binding hamiltonians of great interest in the study of strongly correlated systems .",
    "increasingly , over the last several years , the physics of strongly correlated quantum systems has focused on the existence and properties of unconventional phases and phase transitions .",
    "for example , when the extended one - dimensional bose hubbard model ( ebh ) is at full filling and the contact interaction dominates , the system is in the mi phase with one particle per site . as the near neighbor interaction",
    "is increased , quantum fluctuations create holes and doublons , typically leading to three kinds of sites : empty , singly occupied and doubly occupied .",
    "one can then approximate the model by the spin-@xmath0 heisenberg chain with @xmath1 for the doubly , singly and empty sites .",
    "this led to the discovery @xcite that at full filling , the one dimensional extended bhm supports , in addition to the sf , mi and cdw phases , a topological phase characterized by a nonlocal string order parameter and edge states .",
    "this phase , called the haldane insulator ( hi ) , is closely related to the haldane phase @xcite appearing in integer spin chains and realized in the aklt state @xcite .",
    "the phase diagram of this model was elaborated and the excitation spectra studied using quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulations and density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) calculations @xcite .",
    "another situation where unconventional phases may be encountered is that of strong geometrical frustration , for example in the particle kinetic energy . if the hopping term in the hamiltonian is frustrated in a particular way , the lowest band can become flat resulting in a huge degeneracy of states into which the particles may condense",
    "this degeneracy changes the behavior of the particles when their density is sufficiently low ( or when there is no interaction between them ) : the particles are localized in extended geometrical structures due to interference effects of the hopping terms .",
    "what happens when interaction is present and the particle filling exceeds a critical value dictated by the lattice geometry was treated by several authors@xcite .",
    "a general approach used in these references is to project the hamiltonian onto the flat band resulting in an effective low energy hamiltonian which depends only on the interaction .",
    "for example , in ref .",
    "[ ] , the sawtooth and the kagome lattices were treated in this way . for the sawtooth lattice , the effective projected hamiltonian describes bosons hopping on a one - dimensional lattice and interacting with each other .",
    "the question then arises if , under certain situations , this model can support a topological phase , such as the hi , as happens in the extended one - dimensional bhm mentioned above .",
    "this is the main question which we will address in this work .",
    "we will show , with dmrg calculations , that by adding an extended interaction term to the model studied in ref .",
    "[ ] , and when the system has a flat band and is at half filling , the charge and neutral gaps behave in a way reminiscent of the hi .",
    "we then show the presence of edge states and imbalance in the number of particles on the two ends of the system ( with open boundary conditions ) which confirms the existence of the hi . we also show that , contrary to the usual situation , the entanglement spectrum does not exhibit a doubly degenerate ground state in the haldane phase .",
    "we then demonstrate that this behavior persists in a finite interval of geometric frustration around the flat band but disappears if the frustration is far from what is needed for flatness .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ modelsection ]",
    "we present the model and review the results of ref .  .",
    "in section [ gapssection ] we present our dmrg results for the gaps and density profiles and discuss the various phases found at half filling .",
    "topological aspects of the edge states are presented and discussed in section [ edgestatesection ] while the entanglement spectrum is discussed in section [ wanniersection ] .",
    "the phase diagrams when the lowest band is dispersive but still almost flat are presented in section [ notflatsection ] followed by our conclusions in section [ conclusionsection ] .",
    "we will study the bhm on the sawtooth lattice , fig.[sawtoothlattice ] , and governed by the hamiltonian    @xmath2    where @xmath3 denotes near neighbors and @xmath4 near neighbors of the @xmath5 type ; the operators @xmath6 and @xmath7 are destruction and creation operators on site @xmath8 and satisfy the usual bosonic commutation relations .",
    "@xmath9 is the number operator on site @xmath8 and @xmath10 is the hopping parameter between near neighbor sites .",
    "we will take @xmath11 for hops between two b sites ( see fig.[sawtoothlattice ] ) and @xmath12 for hops between a and b sites .",
    "the contact interaction strength is @xmath13 and the near neighbor interaction is @xmath14 both of which are taken to be repulsive .",
    "note that the near neighbor repulsion is only between neighboring @xmath5 sites for reasons to be discussed below .",
    "the kinetic part of the hamiltonian , eq.([sawtoothham ] ) , can be easily diagonalized@xcite giving the band energies @xmath15 when @xmath16 , the lowest band becomes flat and we get , @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the distance between two @xmath5 sites .",
    "if a particle is now introduced in the system , it will be localized on three sites , in the shape of v , due to the interference effects of frustration .",
    "these sites are shown in thick ( red ) v - shaped structures in fig.[sawtoothlattice ] .",
    "the localized states are given by , @xmath19 a particle and each of the two @xmath20 sites by @xmath21 .",
    "it is clear from fig.[sawtoothlattice ] that even in the presence of interaction , if the total number of particles is less than or equal to @xmath21 of the number of sites , these localized states are eigenstates of @xmath22 .",

    "specifically , the questions we address here are : will the half filled system admit a mi phase of v s sharing @xmath20 sites ? will the system admit a cdw phase with alternating vacant and doubly occupied v s ? and , will the system admit a hi phase sandwiched in between these two ?",
    "to address the above questions , we use the dmrg codes in the alps@xcite library to calculate density profiles and the neutral and charge energy gaps at half filling .",
    "we take @xmath42 to fix the energy scale and focus attention on two values of the contact interaction , @xmath43 , and study the system as the near neighbor repulsion , @xmath14 , is varied .",
    "most of our results are for the flat band case , @xmath44 .",
    "the @xmath45 will be addressed in section [ notflatsection ] .",
    "we perform the calculations for several system sizes , @xmath46 ( number of sites is @xmath47 ) with open boundary conditions and a maximum number of boson per state @xmath48 .",
    "the neutral gap , @xmath49 , is calculated by targeting the ground and the first excited states in the dmrg calculation .",
    "we typically keep @xmath50 states in the dmrg calculation and we have verified that keeping more ( up to @xmath51 states ) or increasing @xmath52 does not change the results .",
    "the charge gaps , @xmath53 , are calculated using the energies at half filling and at half filling doped with one particle and doped with one hole , @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the number of particles at half filling .",
    "since we use open boundary conditions , our convention for the lattice names , i.e. aa , bb and ab , indicates the type of site at each end of the lattice and since the lattice is frustrated , special care must be taken in order to observe the various phases .",
    "more precisely , in the following , we will show that , at half filling , the system exhibits three types of insulating phases : mott , haldane , and cdw phases . in order to compute the gap values",
    ", one needs to be able to lift the degeneracy among the different ground states . as for the ebh on a 1d chain ,",
    "this is done by adding a chemical potential at each edge , but , since the `` natural '' local states after projection on the flat band are the v - shaped structures ( or the wannier function ) , the boundary conditions must be matched in terms of these local states .",
    "in particular , adding a large positive chemical potential on a @xmath5 site at one edge ( and on the neighboring @xmath20 site , if the lattice ends with an @xmath20 site ) more or less amounts to imposing a vanishing density on the v - shape localized on that @xmath5 site ; on the other hand , adding a large negative chemical potential on either ending @xmath5 ( and on the neighboring @xmath20 ) site does not correspond to getting a fixed number of bosons in the v - shape localized on this @xmath5 site .",
    "in other words , we do not have a simple way to impose on the ground state to be in a fock state in the v - shape ( or wannier ) basis at the edge .",
    "this is in a sharp contrast with the ebh on a 1d - chain , for which a large negative chemical potential on a given site amounts to fixing the state on that site to a fock state with @xmath52 bosons .",
    "from that point of view , our strategy was to compare the results for the densities , gap values and correlation functions for different lattice types , i.e. aa , bb and ab and different boundary conditions , i.e. adding or not a large chemical potential at each edge .",
    "in what follows , we adopt the following conventions : a lattice size @xmath56 always means a lattice with @xmath57 @xmath5-sites , an aa lattice has then @xmath58 @xmath20-sites whereas a bb lattice has @xmath56 @xmath20-sites .",
    "then , it turns out that , for the different phases , the proper choice of the lattice type , boundary conditions and the number of bosons that give the correct charge and neutral gaps is are follows :    * mi phase ( single ground state ) : aa lattice with @xmath59 bosons and no additional chemical potential . *",

    "we confirmed that the preceding situations yield correct values for the gaps by comparing with the gap values obtained with dmrg , for @xmath60 , under periodic boundary conditions where the above issues do not arise .",
    "larger sizes with periodic boundary conditions do not converge properly with dmrg .    , and neutral , @xmath49 , gaps as functions of the near neighbor repulsion , @xmath14 , for @xmath61 , @xmath16 ( flat band ) at half filling .",

    "away from the boundaries , the average density on the @xmath20 site is 0.61 and 0.39 on the @xmath5 site ; these values are extremely close to the dmrg ground state ones in the hi phase , see fig .",
    "[ hidenprof ] .",
    "more saliently , we find that the entanglement spectrum obtained by splitting the state in the left and right parts in the local basis is uniform and the largest eigenvalues are : @xmath137 .",
    "obviously , the spectrum is not degenerate which emphasizes the impact of the non - locality of the wannier function on the properties of the entanglement .",
    "in addition , the values found for the aklt - like state are extremely close to the ground state ones in the hi phase @xmath138 , which indirectly proves that for @xmath139 and @xmath140 , the system does exhibit a haldane phase , but built on the wannier states .",
    "finally , one can compute the number of bosons of the left and right edge states of these aklt states , as in in section  [ edgestatesection ] for the ground state . here",
    "again , one finds that the left part has 25.2 particles and the right side has 24.8 particles , the imbalance is @xmath141 bosons , exactly as for the dmrg ground state .    .",
    "away from the boundaries , the average density on the @xmath20 site is 0.61 and 0.39 on the @xmath5 site ; these values are extremely close to the dmrg ground state ones in the hi phase . in addition , the edge states contain a fractional number of bosons , the imbalance being @xmath112 like for the ground state of our model.,width=340 ]    , and neutral , @xmath49 , gaps as functions of the near neighbor repulsion , @xmath14 , for @xmath61 , @xmath142 at half filling .",
    "the vertical lines show the locations of the mi - hi ( @xmath143 ) and the hi - cdw ( @xmath144 ) transitions.,width=340 ]    , and neutral , @xmath49 , gaps as functions of the near neighbor repulsion , @xmath14 , for @xmath61 , @xmath145 at half filling .",
    "the vertical lines show the locations of the mi - hi ( @xmath146 ) and the hi - cdw ( @xmath147 ) transitions.,width=340 ]",
    "so far , we have studied the system only in the flat band case , @xmath16 .",
    "the question we address now is : does the phase diagram , in particular the hi phase , survive for any value of @xmath148 ?",
    "we studied in detail the phase diagram for two values , @xmath149 ( _ i.e. _ smaller than @xmath150 ) and @xmath151 ( _ i.e. _ larger than @xmath150 ) .",
    "the results , figs.[gapsu0.5t1.4 ] and [ gapsu0.5t1.43 ] , show that the gaps behave in a very similar manner to the @xmath64 case , in particular the behavior of @xmath49 indicates that the hi phase persists .",
    "furthermore , we verified that the edge states are present and behave as for the case of @xmath16 .",
    "however , it is clear from fig.[gapsu0.5t1.4 ] and fig.[gapsu0.5 ] that the hi phase gets narrower with the smaller value of @xmath148 .",
    "in fact , the hi phase does not exist for @xmath152 . on the other hand , fig.[gapsu0.5t1.43 ]",
    "shows that the hi phase expands for the larger value of @xmath148 .",
    "however , this expansion does not continue as @xmath148 continues to increase ; for a large enough value @xmath49 will not dip down to zero .",
    "the cdw phase will be reached directly from the mi phase .",
    "this is the case for @xmath153 .",
    "this shows that the phase diagram , in particular the presence of the topological hi phase , is robust and persists in a finite ( but narrow ) range of values of @xmath154 centered at the flat band value , @xmath155 .",
    "we also observed the same behavior for @xmath73 .",
    "in summary , we have studied the phase diagram of the half filled bose - hubbard system in the sawtooth lattice in the situation where the geometric frustration in the hopping term produces a flat band .",
    "we have shown that , in the presence of contact and near neighbor repulsion , three phases exist : mott insulator ( mi ) , charge density wave ( cdw ) , and the topological haldane insulating ( hi ) phase .",
    "in particular , we have shown that in the hi phase , even though the entanglement spectrum is not doubly degenerate , it is in excellent agreement with the entanglement spectrum of the affleck - kennedy - lieb - tasaki ( aklt ) state built in the wannier basis associated with the flat band .",
    "this emphasizes that the abscence of degeneracy in the entanglement spectrum is not necessarily a signature of a non - topological phase , but rather that the ( hidden ) protecting symmetry involves non - local states .",
    "finally , we have also shown that , at fixed interactions , the hi phase is stable against small departure from flatness of the band but is destroyed as the band dispersion becomes stronger .    for future work , it would be interesting to find an efficient way to compute the string order in the wannier basis and to show that it vanishes at the mi - hi transition .",
    "in addition , it would be illuminating to study the excitations of the system , and , along the preceding line , to show that the elementary excitations correspond to domain walls in the string order ."
