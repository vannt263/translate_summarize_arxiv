    "an anomaly in field theory occurs if a symmetry of the action or the corresponding conservation law , valid in the classical theory , is violated in the quantized version .",
    "this surprising feature of quantum theory discovered by adler @xcite , bell and jackiw @xcite , and by bardeen @xcite in 1969 plays a fundamental role in physics ( for details see refs.@xcite ",
    "@xcite ) . physically there is a difference between external and internal symmetries .",
    "the breakdown of an external symmetry is not dangerous for the consistency of the theory , on the contrary , it provides for instance the physical explanation for the @xmath1-decay @xcite , @xcite or the solution to the @xmath2 problem in qcd @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the breakdown of an internal symmetry ( i.e. gauge symmetry ) leads to an inconsistency of the quantum theory , the anomalous ward identities destroy the renormalizability of the theory @xcite , and also the unitarity of the @xmath3-matrix may be lost @xcite . to avoid such anomalies imposes severe restrictions to the physical content of a theory .",
    "for instance , in the famous @xmath4 standard theory for electroweak interactions one had to demand the existence of the top quark long before it was discovered .",
    "gravitation regarded as a gauge theory also suffers from anomalies .",
    "the gauges are the general coordinate transformations ( diffeomorphisms ) or the rotations in the tangent frame ( lorentz transformations ) or the conformal transformations ( weyl transformations ) .",
    "then in the quantum case the classical conservation law of the energy - momentum tensor can be broken  an einstein anomaly occurs  or an antisymmetric part of the energy - momentum tensor can exist  a lorentz anomaly occurs  or the trace of the tensor is nonvanishing  a weyl anomaly arises ( for details see e.g. refs.@xcite,@xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "whereas the anomaly in the tensor trace has been found already in the seventies @xcite  @xcite the study of the gravitational anomalies started with the pioneering work of alvarez - gaum and witten @xcite in the eighties .",
    "the anomalies have been first found within perturbation theory , they are local polynomials in the connection and curvature . the authors @xcite  @xcite have calculated ( ultraviolet divergent ) feynman diagrams where the external gravitational field couples to a fermion loop via the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "of course , the anomaly  reflecting the deep laws of quantum physics  must show up within other approaches too . so they have been calculated by the heat kernel method @xcite , @xcite , by fujikawa s path integral approach @xcite , @xcite , and by modern mathematical techniques such as differential geometry and cohomology @xcite  @xcite and topology ( index theorems ) @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , ( for an overview see ref.@xcite ) .    deeply related to anomalies",

    "( st ) show up as additional terms ( extensions ) in the canonical algebra of the equal time commutators ( etc ) of the gauss law operators ( see e.g. @xcite ",
    "cohomologically they are described by the faddeev - mickelsson cocycle @xcite , @xcite , and geometrically they can be related to a berry phase in the vacuum functional @xcite  @xcite .",
    "st are frequently calculated within perturbation theory where the bjorken - johnson - low limit @xcite , @xcite works very well .",
    "however , the definition of a point - splitting method turns out to be more subtle and might not lead to the correct result @xcite , @xcite .    in gravitation schwinger terms",
    "occur in the etc of the energy - momentum tensors , c - number terms that are proportional to derivatives of the @xmath0-function .",
    "they can be related to the gravitational anomalies @xcite , and they have been calculated explictly via the invariant spectral function and via cohomological techniques @xcite . furthermore there exists an interesting relation of the st to the curvature of the determinant line bundle @xcite , @xcite .",
    "our work deals with the calculation of the gravitational anomalies , specifically the einstein anomaly and the weyl anomaly .",
    "the lorentz anomaly is not independent of the einstein anomaly , both types of anomalies can be shifted into each other by a suitable counterterm @xcite . for convenience",
    "we choose the case where the lorentz anomaly is vanishing .",
    "we also calculate the gravitational schwinger terms .",
    "the purpose of our work is to show that all these anomalous features are easily obtained by the method of dispersion relations , a less familiar but very useful approach .",
    "some of our results we have briefly presented in refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite .",
    "already since their first introduction into quantum field theory @xcite dispersion relations ( dr ) proved to be a very valuable tool . in connection with anomalies",
    "dr have been fomulated by dolgov and zakharov @xcite and also by kummer @xcite . in the following several authors",
    "@xcite  @xcite used successfully dr to determine the anomalies in the chiral current .",
    "recently hoej ' i and schnabl @xcite have applied the method to the well - known trace anomaly @xcite , @xcite which is related to the broken dilatation ( or scale ) invariance .",
    "we extend in our work the method of dr to the case of pure gravitation .",
    "so we consider chiral fermion loops coupled to gravitation  for their evaluation it is enough to use gravitation as an external or nonquantized field  and we show that the gravitational anomalies and the schwinger terms are , in fact , completely determined by dispersion relations .",
    "all calculations are performed in two dimensions .",
    "conceptuelly the dr approach is an independent and complementary view of the anomaly phenomenon as compared to the ultraviolet regularization procedures . within",
    "dr the anomaly manifests itself as a very peculiar infrared feature of the imaginary part of the amplitude .",
    "but as we shall show there is a link between the two approaches , the dr method and the n - dimensional regularization precedure .    our paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we present the general structure of the considered ( pseudo- ) tensor amplitude and we discuss the ward identities which we have to study . in section 3 we introduce the dispersion relations for the relevant formfactors of the amplitude and calculate their imaginary parts via the cutkosky rule . in order to reproduce the dr results in a definite ultraviolet regularization scheme",
    "we have worked out in detail the t  hooft - veltman regularization procedure in section 4 and we have compared the several amplitudes with the results of tomiya @xcite and alvarez - gaum and witten @xcite .",
    "the equivalence between the dispersive approach and the dimensional regularization procedure is given in section 5 . in section 6",
    "we derive the anomalous ward identities and explain the source of the anomaly in the dr approach . from the ward identities we deduce the linearized gravitational anomalies",
    " the einstein- and the weyl anomaly  and we also determine their covariant versions , a comparison with the exact results is given .",
    "the gravitational schwinger terms occuring in the etc of the energy - momentum tensors we calculate in section 7 , where we adapt the dispersive approach to a method proposed by klln @xcite .",
    "finally we summarize our main results in section 8 .",

    "if we had subtracted more often or at some other point than @xmath108 we would have lost this property .",
    "the dispersive approach and the dimensional regularization procedure are equivalent in the following sense . for",
    "the formfactors that were convergent or logarithmically divergent the corresponding integrals in both approaches do not have just identical values but we even can transform them into each other by a suitable substitution . more precise , we transform the feynman parameter integrals over x in the dimensional regularization procedure into the corresponding dispersion integrals over t. for the formfactors that were linearly divergent the situation is as follows .",

    "but anyway , for these formfactors the integrals are identical , what is actually sufficient .",
    "the substitutions which link the two approaches are @xmath112 to show the equivalence we need the following relations which are valid for any function @xmath113 with suitable differentiation properties @xmath114",

    "we consider the massless limit , @xmath95 , where the formfactors @xmath115 ( i = 1, ... ,5 ) fulfill the wi ( [ vwi1 ] )  ( [ vwi3 ] ) .",
