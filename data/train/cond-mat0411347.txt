    "currently , the first - principles theory of electrons in disordered metals is based upon density functional theory ( dft ) and either the korringa - kohn - rostoker coherent - potential approximation ( kkr - cpa ) @xcite or its stripped down version , the lmto - cpa , @xcite for averaging over the random configurations .",
    "this approach has been successfully applied to cases where the disorder is internal as well as external .",
    "examples of the latter are metallic solid solutions such as @xmath2 and @xmath3 above their ordering temperatures @xmath4 .",
    "examples of the former are @xmath5 or @xmath6 above their curie temperatures @xmath7 , where randomness in the crystal potential seen by an electron is the consequence of disordered local moments ( dlm ) , @xcite and secondly valence fluctuating systems such as @xmath8 .",
    "@xcite despite significant achievements , @xcite this methodology suffers from the shortcoming of not describing correlations in the fluctuations of the crystal potential .",
    "however a generalization of the kkr - cpa theory has recently been proposed , the kkr - nlcpa @xcite ( where nl stands for nonlocal ) , which systematically takes into account such correlations , enabling environmental effects such as short - range order ( sro ) to be taken into account . although the full 3d kkr - nlcpa formalism was given in refs .",
    ", in this paper we present the first realistic 3d implementation of the theory @xcite by illustrating the effects of sro on the @xmath1 system .",
    "the physics of the above sro plays a particularly important role near phase transitions where it is frequently a precursor for long range order and can be said to be driving the ordering process .",
    "for example , in the ordering of the @xmath1 solid solution into an intermetallic compound of @xmath9 symmetry the system lowers its free energy by having unlike neighbours more frequently than like neighbours even in the disordered state , thereby lowering the temperature @xmath4 where the system must finally order .",
    "such sro is also central to the understanding of electronic transport in general and in @xmath10-state alloys in particular .",
    "@xcite moreover , the formation of the moment in the dlm state of @xmath6  @xcite and the creation of @xmath11-like @xmath8 atoms near the @xmath12 transition  @xcite will be materially affected by the sro .",
    "the kkr - nlcpa method to be illustrated here will enable these important problems to be tackled in a parameter - independent and material - specific way .",
    "however , before getting on with the task we comment briefly on efforts addressing the same problem as we do by adopting alternative strategies .    there have been several attempts to develop cluster generalisations of the single - site cpa . as with the cpa",
    ", the main construct is an effective medium so that the motion of an electron through it approximates the motion , _ on the average _ , of the electron in the disordered system .",
    "an early example , the molecular cpa ( mcpa ) , @xcite introduces a supercell so that the medium has the unsatisfactory attribute of broken translational symmetry . the embedded cluster method ( ecm ) @xcite refers to the non - self consistent embedding of a cluster with all the relevant disorder configurations into the cpa medium . the travelling cluster approximation ( tca ) @xcite based on diagrammatic methods and the cluster - cpa ( c - cpa ) @xcite based on the augmented space formalism ( asf ) @xcite are , like the nlcpa , satisfactory on account of their translationally invariant , self - consistently determined effective media and herglotz analytic properties .",
    "both the tca and c - cpa become rapidly computationally intractable , however , and a kkr version of the latter has been applied only to model systems .",
    "@xcite a reasonably good alternative starting point for the electronic structure of some disordered alloys is the tight - binding ( tb)-lmto method @xcite combined with the cpa , which can include an approximate treatment of the charge self - consistency needed for a dft .",
    "mookerjee and prasad @xcite have developed a generalised asf with correlated variables to describe sro , which has been combined with the tb - lmto and real space recursion technique .",
    "@xcite this approach has been used successfully to describe effects of sro on the densities of states of several alloy systems . @xcite",
    "nonetheless it is desirable to develop a computationally tractable generalisation of the cpa within the kkr method , the kkr - nlcpa , with fewer approximations and superiority with regards to accuracy and reliability over lmto methods .",
    "it will also be amenable for incorporation into a full dft description of disordered materials with sro.@xcite    this paper is organised as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we briefly summarise the idea of the kkr - nlcpa ( for the full derivation see refs .  ) , and in particular we clearly explain how to carry out the fundamental ` coarse - graining ' procedure for general lattices .",
    "our aim is to show how current kkr - based computational codes can be straightforwardly adapted to include the kkr - nlcpa with its capability of dealing with disordered systems with sro . in sec .",
    "iii we present results including sro calculations for the @xmath1 system , and we conclude in sec .  iv .",

    "@xcite finally , note that the kkr - nlcpa formalism reduces to the kkr - cpa for @xmath27 , and nonlocal scattering correlations ( and sro if desired ) are systematically included into the effective medium as @xmath23 is increased , becoming exact as @xmath62 .",
    "c +   +    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     to illustrate the kkr - nlcpa , we present calculations for the @xmath0 @xmath1 solid solution with lattice constant 2.86 . in all calculations that follow , @xmath63 and @xmath64 potentials come from self - consistent field ( scf ) kkr - cpa calculations , @xcite the brillouin zone integrals use the adaptive quadrature method , @xcite and the energy contour has 1  mry imaginary part .",

    "since the energies of the @xmath63 and @xmath64 @xmath65-bands are very different , the system is said to be in the ` split band ' regime .",
    "physically , this means an electron travels more easily between @xmath63 or between @xmath64 sites than between unlike sites and so the decrease in overlap between like sites in the ordered case results in a narrowing of the @xmath63 and @xmath64 bands by a factor of two compared with the pure calculations .",
    "@xcite fig .",
    "[ fig4](a ) shows kkr - cpa results for disordered @xmath1 .",

    "next , a kkr - nlcpa calculation for disordered @xmath1 for a two - site cluster ( @xmath29 ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4](b ) .",
    "first note that there is little observable difference in the total dos compared with the kkr - cpa calculation .",
    "this is due to the small size of the cluster , and the difference due to the nonlocal scattering correlations shows up in detail only on a scale of @xmath66 state / atom / ry , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4](c ) .",
    "as expected , it is clear that the extra structure is in the energy regions of the impurity @xmath65-bands .",
    "however the most striking aspect of the kkr - nlcpa calculation is that the component contributions to the total dos from the four possible cluster configurations are apparent .",
    "the component plots here are the dos measured at the first cluster site when a particular cluster configuration is embedded in the kkr - nlcpa medium , which is the @xmath63 site for the @xmath63-@xmath63 and @xmath63-@xmath64 configurations , and the @xmath64 site for the @xmath64-@xmath63 and @xmath64-@xmath64 configurations .",
    "crucially , owing to the translational invariance of the kkr - nlcpa medium , measurement at the second site gives the same results with a simple reversal of the labels of the @xmath63-@xmath64 and @xmath64-@xmath63 components .",
    "these component plots are particularly useful for interpreting the effects of sro on the electronic structure , as described in the next section .",
    "finally , fig .",
    "[ fig4](b ) also shows total dos results for the larger @xmath30 cluster , where the extra structure is more visible in the energy region between 0.10  ry and 0.15  ry where some states are shifted to higher energies .      unlike single - site theories , it is possible to include the effects of short - range order ( sro ) on the electronic structure of disordered systems using the kkr - nlcpa",
    "this may be done by using an appropriate non - random probability distribution when averaging over the impurity cluster configurations in eq .",
    "[ nlcpacond ] .",
    "of course as the size of the cluster increases , the range of possible sro that may be included also increases .",
    "here we show results for @xmath0 @xmath1 using a pair cluster ( @xmath29 ) , where it is possible to include sro between nearest neighbour sites only .",
    "this may be straightforwardly done by introducing the nearest neighbour warren - cowley sro parameter @xmath67 , @xcite and using probabilities defined as @xmath68 for @xmath1 , @xmath69 and so the sro parameter can take values in the range @xmath70 , where @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 correspond to ideal ordering , complete randomness , and ideal clustering .    fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] shows the effects of short - range clustering upon the configurationally - averaged dos .",
    "it is clear that as @xmath67 increases above zero , the probability of like pair components increases whilst that of unlike pairs decreases , resulting in corresponding changes to the component and total dos .",
    "indeed at @xmath74 the probability of unlike pairs is zero and the total dos is now completely dominated by the features of the @xmath63-@xmath63 and @xmath64-@xmath64 components , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5](f ) . as expected these features",
    "are reminiscent of the pure bands shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) , for example the magnifying of the trough and peak either side of 0.15  ry and 0.5  ry can all be associated with the dos for pure @xmath64 and pure @xmath63 respectively . moreover , a new peak appears just before 0.4  ry associated with pure @xmath63 .",
    "[ fig6 ] shows the effects of short - range ordering upon the configurationally - averaged dos . here as @xmath67 decreases below zero , the components of the total dos due to like pairs decreases whilst that due to unlike pairs increases . finally at @xmath75 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6](f ) , there are only contributions remaining from unlike pairs .",
    "evidently , the dos in general has a closer resemblance to that of ordered @xmath1 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) .",
    "for example the peaks either side of 0.15  ry and 0.5  ry are now of roughly equal magnitude and there is also a slight overall narrowing of the bands compared with those for positive values of @xmath67 due to the decrease in probability of like neighbours .",
    "in summary , the recently devised kkr - nlcpa generalises the widely used kkr - cpa method by including sro , and satisfies all of the requirements for a satisfactory effective medium cluster theory .",
    "@xcite it has relatively low computational cost in comparison with supercell - based methods since the bz integration , the most computationally - demanding aspect of a band structure calculation , does not scale with the cluster size . in this paper",
    "we have implemented the kkr - nlcpa for a realistic system by illustrating the dramatic changes that can occur in the dos for @xmath0 @xmath1 .",
    "ultimately the kkr - nlcpa will be the electronic structure component of a fully self - consistent theory of disordered systems .",
    "the next step will be to combine it with dft , @xcite which will also enable charge correlations @xcite and local lattice displacements @xcite to be systematically taken into account for alloys .",
    "then , the sro parameter @xmath67 will need to be coarse - grained via eqs .",
    "[ ijtok ] , and could be determined via a linear response calculation @xcite before being fed back into the electronic structure , resulting in a completely ab - initio theory of sro at a given temperature @xmath76 .",
    "similar treatments will also be available for effects such as magnetic sro in metallic magnets at finite temperature ."
