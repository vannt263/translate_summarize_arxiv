    "one of the primary goals of the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) is the discovery of the higgs boson and a thorough investigation of the mechanism of electroweak ( ew ) symmetry breaking  @xcite . in this context ,",
    "vector - boson fusion ( vbf ) processes have emerged as a particularly interesting class of processes .",
    "higgs boson production in vbf , i.e.   the reaction @xmath8 , where the higgs decay products are detected in association with two tagging jets , offers a promising discovery channel  @xcite and , once its existence has been verified , will help to constrain the couplings of the higgs boson to gauge bosons and fermions  @xcite .    in order to distinguish possible signatures of strong weak - boson scattering from those of a light higgs boson , a good understanding of @xmath0 and @xmath1 scattering processes , which are part of the vbf reaction @xmath9 , is needed .",
    "this requires the computation of next - to - leading order ( nlo ) qcd corrections to the @xmath10 cross section , including the leptonic decays of the @xmath2 bosons .",
    "experimentally , very clean signatures are expected from the @xmath11 decays in vbf with four charged leptons in the final state , the disadvantage of this channel being a rather small @xmath12 or @xmath13 branching ratio of about 3% . the @xmath14 channel , with two undetected neutrinos , on the other hand , results in a larger number of events due to the larger @xmath15 branching ratio  @xcite .",
    "lo results for ew @xmath16 production in vbf have been available for more than two decades .",
    "the first calculations  @xcite were performed employing the effective @xmath17 approximation  @xcite , where the vector bosons radiated off the scattering quarks are treated as on - shell particles and , therefore , kinematical distributions characterizing the tagging jets can not be predicted reliably . in the following years",
    ", exact calculations for @xmath10 have been completed , first without @xmath2 boson decay  @xcite , and then including leptonic decays of the @xmath2 bosons within the narrow width approximation  @xcite .",
    "we go beyond these approximations and develop a fully - flexible parton level monte carlo program , which allows for the calculation of cross sections and kinematical distributions for ew @xmath18 production via vbf at nlo qcd accuracy .",
    "the program is structured in complete analogy to the respective code for ew @xmath19 production presented in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    ", we calculate the @xmath20-channel weak - boson exchange contributions to the full matrix elements for processes like @xmath21 and @xmath22 at @xmath23 .",
    "we consider all resonant and non - resonant contributions giving rise to a four charged - lepton and a two charged - lepton plus two neutrino final state , respectively .",
    "contributions from weak - boson exchange in the @xmath24-channel are strongly suppressed in the phase - space regions where vbf can be observed experimentally and therefore disregarded throughout .",
    "we do not specifically require the leptons and neutrinos to stem from a genuine vbf - like production process , but also include diagrams where one or two of the @xmath2 bosons are emitted from either quark line .",
    "diagrams , where the final state leptons stem from a @xmath25 decay or non - resonant production modes , are also taken into account .",
    "finite - width effects are fully considered .",
    "for simplicity , we nonetheless refer to the @xmath26 and @xmath27 processes computed this way generically as `` ew @xmath18 '' production .",

    "[ sec : concl ] .",
    "the calculation of nlo qcd corrections to ew @xmath18 production closely resembles our earlier work for ew @xmath28 production in association with two jets  @xcite .",
    "the main differences lie in the electroweak aspects of the processes , while the qcd structure of the nlo corrections is very similar .",
    "the techniques developed in ref .",
    "@xcite can therefore be adapted readily and only need a brief recollection here . for simplicity , we focus on the @xmath29 decay channel in the following .",
    "the application of the basic features discussed for this case to the @xmath30 leptonic final state is then straightforward .",
    "the feynman graphs contributing to @xmath31 can be grouped in six topologies , respectively , for the 579 @xmath20-channel neutral - current ( nc ) and the 241 charged - current ( cc ) exchange diagrams which appear at tree level .",

    ". backgrounds to vbf are significantly reduced by requiring a large rapidity separation of the two tagging jets .",
    "we therefore impose the cut [ eq : cutsyjj ] y_jj=|y_j_1-y_j_2|>4 .",

    "in addition , the charged leptons are required to fall between the rapidities of the two tagging jets [ eq : cutsyl ] y_j , min < _ m_h+10 , and correspondingly for the @xmath100 final state . since the contribution from the higgs boson resonance",

    "the lo cross section only depends on @xmath107 . by varying the scale factor @xmath108 in the range @xmath109 , the value of @xmath110 changes by almost a factor of two , indicating the theoretical uncertainty of the lo calculation .",
    "the strong scale dependence is reduced substantially after the inclusion of nlo corrections .",
    "for @xmath111 we study three different cases : @xmath112 ( solid red line ) , @xmath108 , @xmath113 ( dot - dashed blue line ) , and @xmath114 , @xmath115 ( dashed green line ) .",
    "the latter curve illustrates clearly the weak dependence of @xmath111 on the renormalization scale , which can be understood from the fact that @xmath116 enters only at nlo , while the lo cross section is completely independent of @xmath105 .",
    "also the factorization - scale dependence of the full cross section is rather low , such that the variation of @xmath111 with the scale parameter amounts to less than 2% for all cases in the interesting range @xmath117 . in the following ,",

    "the shape of the distribution at nlo differs from the respective lo result .",
    "this is emphasized in panel  ( b ) of the figure , where we show the dynamical k  factor , defined as [ eq : kfac ] k(x ) = . due to the extra parton emerging in the real - emission contributions to the nlo cross section",
    ", the quarks which constitute the tagging jets tend to have smaller transverse momenta than at lo , thereby giving rise to lower values of their invariant mass .",
    "the transverse - momentum distributions of the tagging jets , per se , exhibit k  factors in the range @xmath121 . on the other hand , angular distributions , such as the azimuthal angle between the tagging jets , display rather uniform k  factors for the scale choice @xmath118 . for this particular scale choice ,",
    "the total cross section is barely affected by the inclusion of nlo corrections , leading to a k  factor of 0.99 .",

    "it is very sensitive to a light higgs boson , showing a pronounced resonance behavior for @xmath122  gev . for values of @xmath123 of the order of 1  tev , the peak is diluted due to the large corresponding width of the higgs boson ( @xmath124  gev ) and the signal is distributed over a wide range in @xmath125 .",

    "one remarkable feature of fig .",
    "[ fig : mzz ] is that lo and nlo results are virtually indistinguishable , for the scale choice @xmath118 .",
    "for the @xmath125 distribution , the invariant mass of the @xmath2 pair is another possible scale choice , which , however , would lead to substantially reduced lo differential cross section predictions at high values of @xmath125 .",
    "one finds , for example , a decrease by a factor of @xmath127 in @xmath128 at @xmath129 when changing @xmath130 to @xmath131 , which largely is due to an underestimate of the lo parton distributions at large feynman-@xmath132 .",
    "the nlo prediction , on the other hand , decreases by about 13% compared to our default choice @xmath118 , demonstrating the precision gained by including the nlo corrections .",
    "in this paper we have presented first results for ew @xmath18 production at nlo qcd accuracy , obtained with a fully - flexible parton - level monte carlo program that allows for a straightforward implementation of realistic experimental cuts .",
    "the integrated cross sections for the two processes @xmath133 and @xmath134 were found to exhibit k  factors around 0.99 , which shows that higher - order corrections are under excellent control .",
    "larger nlo contributions are obtained for some kinematical distributions with dynamical k  factors in the range @xmath135 .",
    "these results hold for a default scale choice of @xmath136 .",
    "leading order results can change substantially , by up to a factor of 2 , for other scale choices , while nlo results are very stable , demonstrating the value of the nlo corrections .",
    "an estimate of the theoretical uncertainty of the nlo calculation is provided by the scale variation of cross sections , within vbf cuts .",
    "it amounts to about 2% for integrated cross sections and , in extreme cases , up to 10% for distributions , when changing scales by a factor of two .",
    "similar uncertainties are induced by the present errors on parton distribution functions , which , in the analogous case of higgs boson production in vbf , were found to be about @xmath137%  @xcite .",
