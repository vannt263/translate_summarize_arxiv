    "the macroscopically degenerate manifolds of single - particle states on a flat band provide a unique playground , especially for studying non - perturbative aspects of electron correlations in fermionic lattice models .",
    "for example , lieb , and subsequently mielke and tasaki , have shown rigorously that repulsive hubbard interaction provokes ferri- or ferro - magnetism  @xcite , and localized magnons are discussed in frustrated antiferromagnets  @xcite . in a much wider context ,",
    "flat - band systems have attracted a renewed attention in terms of topological insulators  @xcite , where several constructions were proposed for exactly or nearly flat bands that accommodate nontrivial chern numbers  @xcite .",
    "these topological flat bands are reminiscent of landau levels in the conventional systems in magnetic field and may set the stage for new topological phases when interactions are switched on .",
    "indeed , the hubbard interaction has been shown to lead to either conventional ferromagnetic states  @xcite or fractional chern insulators  @xcite , depending on the fermion filling of the flat band .    in the present work ,",
    "we consider a _ bosonic _ system with a hubbard interaction on a flat - band lattice , which is a cross - linked ladder with @xmath0 flux [ figs .",
    "[ fig : model](a ) and [ fig : model](b ) ] .",
    "the basic motivation for going over to a bosonic system is the following . in the fermionic flat - band systems ,",
    "one important observation is that correlated systems in a flat band are quite distinct from those in the atomic limit ( where the hopping in the tight - binding model @xmath1 )  @xcite .",
    "then , an intriguing question arises : can there be bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) in flat - band boson systems while we have obviously no bec in the atomic limit ( with an effective mass @xmath2 ) ? if we do have states far from those in the atomic limit , we may have a peculiar quantum liquid , or even a possibility of supersolid , i.e. , coexistence of condensation with a diagonal long - range order such as charge density wave ( cdw ) .",
    "in fact , huber and altman have considered this problem , and they concluded that there is a supersolid ( superfluid + cdw ) region for a chain of triangle and kagome lattices  @xcite .    our choice of the model [ fig .",
    "[ fig : model](a ) ] is inspired by the work of creutz _",
    "et al_.  @xcite , which shows that edge states emerge at open boundaries and the fermionic counterpart can be thought of as one - dimensional topological insulators  @xcite . in this paper , we find that the many - body ground state ( gs ) exhibits a variety of phases as the density of bosons is varied .",
    "while the gs consists of nonoverlapping wannier states at low densities , we find that tomonaga - luttinger liquid ( tll ) comprising pairs of bosons ( pair tll ) is stabilized at higher densities , where the fundamental degrees of freedom are boson pairs rather than individual bosons .",
    "pair tll is deduced from the mapping of a boson system onto a spin-1/2 xxz chain in magnetic field .",
    "the validity of the mapping is confirmed by exact diagonalization and the bethe ansatz solution .",

    "the boundary condition is periodic .",
    "it is the same as the creutz model  @xcite except that particles are not fermions but bosons .",
    "here we focus on the case of @xmath18 , which means @xmath0 flux is introduced .",

    "the kinetic part of the hamiltonian  ( [ eq : hamil_orig ] ) becomes @xmath22 , where @xmath23 .",
    "the two energy bands are both flat bands having no wave number dependence ( no dispersion ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : model](c ) .",

    "the wannier operator @xmath24 involves @xmath13 and @xmath25 sites , so that they have only on - site and nearest - neighbor interactions .",
    "when the boson density ( the averaged number of bosons per site ) @xmath26 is dilute ( @xmath27 ) , we can construct a state that does not feel the interaction by making configurations in which the wannier state at each site ( which we simply call `` site '' hereafter ) is occupied by 0 or 1 particle with no two nearest - neighbor sites occupied [ fig .",
    "[ fig : phases](a ) ] . since the kinetic energy is quenched and the interaction term is positive semidefinite , these states are obviously many - body gs of the hamiltonian @xmath28 .",
    "this configuration resembles the wigner solid in an electron gas that minimizes the coulomb interaction by avoiding overlap , so we call it a wigner solid hereafter .        for higher density region of @xmath29 , we consider a projection of hamiltonian onto the lower energy band @xmath30 , neglecting the effect of the higher energy band @xmath31 ( interband interaction and intraband interaction within the higher band ) .",
    "this approximation is justified when the interaction @xmath32 is small compared with the hopping @xmath33 .",
    "we then obtain @xmath34 , \\label{eq : hamil_proj}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have dropped the band index `` @xmath35 '' .",
    "namely , we end up with on - site repulsion ( first term on the right - hand side ) , nearest - neighbor repulsion ( second ) , and pair hopping of bosons ( third ) , respectively .",
    "remarkably , we have a pair - hopping interaction with a significant magnitude ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "the sign of this term is irrelevant , since it is altered by a gauge transformation , @xmath37 ( for @xmath9 ) .",
    "we can vary the number of bosons @xmath38 by adding the chemical potential term @xmath39 to  ( [ eq : hamil_proj ] ) . in the following ,",
    "we ignore the states in which more than two bosons occupy a single site because the energy would become much higher due to the on - site repulsion .",
    "namely , the number of bosons in a single site is 0 , 1 , or 2 , and these states are denoted by @xmath40 , respectively .",
    "note that a single boson is immobile because bosons can hop only in pairs , and let us call a site occupied by a single boson a single - boson site ( sbs ) .",

    "( [ eq : hamil_proj ] ) can be mapped to a spin-1/2 model by identifying @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "we introduce spin-1/2 operators @xmath45 and @xmath46 , with which we have @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 .",
    "the hamiltonian is then mapped to @xmath50 this is nothing but the spin-1/2 xxz model in a magnetic field . the chemical potential term is translated to @xmath51 .    if we want to include @xmath52 , we only have to map the system to a spin-1 chain ( @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 ) , with which we have @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , where @xmath59 are spin-1 operators and @xmath60 . in this case",

    "now let us begin with the region of @xmath62 , where sbss are adjacent or two bosons occupy the same site .",
    "since the nearest - neighbor repulsion is stronger than on - site repulsion in ( [ eq : hamil_proj ] ) , particles tend to form pairs rather than to occupy adjacent sites .",
    "we have performed an exact diagonalization , which demonstrates that the gs of ( [ eq : hamil_spinhalf ] ) and ( [ eq : hamil_spinone ] ) numerically coincide with each other ( see appendix  [ app : edresult ] ) . in other words ,",
    "sbss are irrelevant , and the use of @xmath63 in place of @xmath64 is justified .",
    "the @xmath62 regime for bosons corresponds to the spin-1/2 xxz model  ( [ eq : hamil_spinhalf ] ) with nonzero magnetization , where the low - energy excitations are known to be described as tll induced by external magnetic fields .",
    "since @xmath65 and @xmath66 correspond to @xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectively , we can translate the state as a `` pair tll '' back in the original model . a schematic picture of pair tll is shown in fig .",

    "note that collective excitations in tll are gapless in contrast to the gapped excitations for creating sbss .",
    "this fact again justifies the neglect of sbss in taking the low - energy effective hamiltonian .",
    "here we can raise an intriguing question : can wigner solid and pair tll phases coexist ?",
    "since each boundary between the two phases costs surface energy , there should be a single boundary , if any .",
    "we assume that the proportion of wigner solid phase is @xmath75 , i.e. , wigner solid phase has @xmath76 bosons occupying @xmath77 sites , while pair tll phase has @xmath78 bosons occupying @xmath79 sites .",
    "this pair tll translates into the spin-1/2 chain with magnetization @xmath80 ( with the saturated magnetization corresponding to 1/2 ) , and the gs energy per site @xmath81 can be obtained by solving the bethe - ansatz equations  @xcite .",
    "the energy in the total system is @xmath82 , since the wigner solid phase has zero energy .",

    "since the gss of  ( [ eq : hamil_spinhalf ] ) and  ( [ eq : hamil_spinone ] ) coincide according to numerical diagonalization , the spin-1/2 description is still valid .",
    "however , we have to be careful about the excited states involving sbss because the @xmath95 case corresponds to the xxz chain without magnetization and has an excitation gap .",
    "the lowest two levels are doubly degenerate gss , which have a nel order due to a strong ising anisotropy in the xxz description  ( [ eq : hamil_spinhalf ] ) .",
