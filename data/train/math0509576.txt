    "we consider a group of agents arranged on the nodes of a graph who repeatedly play the prisoner s dilemma game against their immediate neighbors .",
    "the players adapt their actions to the past behavior of their opponents by applying the so - called win - stay lose - shift strategy  @xcite which , as the name suggests , consists in changing strategy whenever the payoff is deemed unsatisfactory .",
    "this model has been studied in the artificial intelligence literature  @xcite as a simple example of `` co - learning ''  @xcite . on a finite connected graph",
    ", it turns out that the system converges to the all - cooperate state  the globally optimal state  in finite time . in this respect , this instance of the iterated prisoner s dilemma ( ipd ) game on a graph provides an interesting example of a system learning to behave optimally by a mechanism that involves each agent applying independently a simple strategy  or rule of thumb  which takes into account only the latest actions of its immediate neighbors . for related work , see  @xcite and references therein .",
    "see also  @xcite for the evolutionary perspective .    in order to understand how persistent this `` emergence of cooperation ''",
    "phenomenon is , it is crucial to analyze the rate of convergence to the all - cooperate state . where the convergence is rapid , one would expect to observe the optimal , cooperation state in a practical system based on similar dynamics . on the other hand , where the convergence is slow , one would rather expect that such a system would stagnate in a suboptimal , metastable state where a nonnegligible fraction of agents defect .",
    "rates of convergence for ipd were studied in  @xcite where the structure of the graph was shown to be a determining factor .    in this paper , we show that ipd exhibits an exponentially slow convergence to cooperation on expander graphs and bounded - degree trees .",
    "our result for bounded - degree trees is somewhat surprising . in particular ,",
    "it should be compared to the behavior of global reversible dynamics on trees  @xcite where the convergence is always rapid .",
    "note however that this slow convergence on trees is not unprecedented .",
    "notably , the contact process , a common model of infection , is slow to converge on trees when the infection rate is large .",
    "see e.g.  @xcite and references therein .",
    "in fact , our proof suggests that ipd behaves very much like the contact process .",
    "nevertheless , the analysis of non - reversible particle systems has been an open challenge in the last two decades and we hope that the results obtained here can shed some more light on how such systems can be tackled .",
    "the proof of slow convergence we give here combines several ideas .",
    "the main idea is to look at the process at the right space - time scaling .",
    "this approach , commonly used in probability ( e.g. in the analysis of interacting particle systems  @xcite ) , allows us to analyze the rough behavior of ipd ",
    "defection survives for long periods of time in zones that are densely populated by defectors .",
    "the main technical difficulty is to control the dependencies between different regions and different times .",
    "then the process is compared to a directed percolation process ( where the directed axis corresponds to the time axis in the original process ) . using contour arguments",
    "we show that the directed percolation process survives for an exponential time .",
    "see  @xcite for background on directed percolation .",
    "recall that the prisoner s dilemma game ( pd ) is a bimatrix game with the following payoff matrix for the row player ( and similarly for the column player ) : @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the first row ( column ) corresponds to the _ cooperate _ action and the second row ( column ) corresponds to the _ defect _ action .",
    "the global  or pareto  optimum is for both agents to cooperate .",
    "however , for any given action of the column player , it is always in the row player s advantage to defect ( and similarly for the column player ) .    for an agent playing pd ,",
    "a simple way to adapt to her opponent s behavior is the so - called win - stay lose - shift strategy ( wsls )  @xcite , also known as the pavlov strategy  @xcite .",
    "this works as follows .",
    "every time the game is played , if the agent s payoff is one of the two smaller payoffs , i.e. @xmath3 or @xmath4 , then she switches her action in anticipation for the next round of play , otherwise she keeps the same action .",
    "we now consider a repeated graphical version of pd which we will refer to as ipd .",
    "let @xmath5 be a finite graph with @xmath6 .",
    "each node , @xmath7 , is an agent to which we associate an action @xmath8 at time @xmath9 .",
    "( as will become clear in later sections , it is easier to consider the continuous - time version of this problem . ) here @xmath10 stands for _ cooperation _ while @xmath11 stands for _ defection_. the initial state is @xmath12 for all @xmath13 .",
    "the agents repeatedly play pd against their immediate neighbors in the graph through the following mechanism .",
    "each edge @xmath14 has an exponential clock , i.e. we associate to each edge an independent poisson process @xmath15 where all inter - arrival times @xmath16 are independent exp(1 ) ( with the convention @xmath17 ) .",
    "every time a clock rings , say at edge @xmath18 , the endpoint agents @xmath19 and @xmath7 play one round of pd using their respective actions @xmath20 and @xmath21 , assuming the clock rings at time @xmath22 .",
    "then the two agents update their state using wsls . in other words , if a clock rings on edge @xmath18 at time @xmath22 , we witness the following transition for @xmath23 @xmath24    this defines a stochastic process for the state of the system @xmath25 with initial state the all - defect state , @xmath26 .",
    "it is clear that , given the above allowed transitions , the system has a unique fixed point , the all - cooperate state @xmath27 .",
    "in particular , if @xmath28 is a finite connected graph with @xmath29 , we have a.s . @xmath30 as @xmath31 .",
    "the question of interest is : how long does it take to reach @xmath32 on a given graph .",

    "note that in theorem  [ thm : expand ] , in order to obtain slow convergence , it suffices to have large expansion for relatively small sets .",
    "in particular , the theorem applies to expander graphs such as random regular graphs  @xcite .",

    "we define an _",

    "our main result , theorem  [ thm : tree ] , is that cooperation is slow to emerge on caterpillars .",
    "the proof of theorem  [ thm : tree ] follows from a series of stochastic domination arguments .",
    "we now briefly outline the main steps of the proof .    1 .   * star dynamics via biased random walk . *",
    "the first step is to analyze the behavior of a single star .",
    "the main point here is that it takes the star with @xmath40 leaves an exponential number of steps ( in @xmath40 ) to move from the all - defect state to the all - cooperate state .",
    "this is proved by comparing the process to a biased random walk .",
    "this comparison also shows that a star can go from a few defectors to linearly many in @xmath61 time with constant probability , and that a small linear fraction of defectors grows with high probability within @xmath61 steps .",
    "moreover , these claims can be established even if one allows two of the nodes of the stars to have arbitrary values .",
    "2 .   * space - time scaling .",
    "* we think of a star as defecting if at least @xmath62 of its leaves defect .",
    "then , we consider triplets of adjacent stars and say that a triplet is defecting if at least one of its extremal stars is defecting .",
    "( we actually work with triplets of stars rather than pairs to help control dependencies . )",
    "we scale time by looking at the process every @xmath61 steps .",
    "the random walk argument of the previous point allows to show that defecting stars have a high probability  at least @xmath63of remaining defectors after the @xmath61 time window .",
    "moreover , a defecting star has a @xmath64 probability of `` infecting '' neighboring stars during that time . by iterating these observations @xmath61 times  yet another time scaling  we show that a defecting triplet has a probability @xmath65 of `` infecting '' a neighboring triplet .",
    "( neighboring triplets are actually intersecting . )",
    "* percolation .",
    "* we may now look at the space - time diagram of defecting triplets and show that it dominates a directed percolation with probability @xmath66 for edges to be open .",
    "the time axis of the original process corresponds to the direction of propagation in the percolation process .",
    "finally , a contour argument allows to conclude that this percolation survives for a time which is exponential in @xmath37 , thus proving that the convergence time of ipd on the caterpillar is itself exponential in @xmath37 .",
