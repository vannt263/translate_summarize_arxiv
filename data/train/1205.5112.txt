    "performing a census of variable stars in a globular cluster is an important task because variable stars , such as rr lyrae and sx phe , provide a wealth of information about the host cluster .",
    "fourier decomposition of the rr lyrae light curves can be used to estimate their metallicity and absolute magnitudes , from which estimates of the metallicity and distance to the cluster may be derived . a frequency analysis of the light curves of the sx phe stars combined with the knowledge of their period - luminosity ( p - l ) relation",
    "may also be used to determine a cluster distance , and conversely , the results may be used to investigate how the sx phe p - l relation depends on metallicity ( @xcite ) .    when performing precise differential time - series photometry , essential for a variable star census , there is always the problem of systematic photometric errors that correlate with image and object properties such as point - spread function full - width half - maximum ( psf fwhm ) , spatial coordinates , local sky background , etc .",
    "( `` red noise '' - see @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "systematic trends may sometimes be mistaken for real variability , since image and object properties may vary smoothly over time , mimicking variability on various timescales",
    ". therefore it can be quite easy to contaminate the catalogue of true variable stars in a globular cluster with non - variable stars whose light curves exhibit systematic trends , and consequently these stars may be accidentally used as part of the sample of variable stars to derive the cluster properties , introducing unwanted errors into these estimates .",
    "one way to avoid contamination is to set the detection threshold for variables to a level that has a very small probability of admitting false detections even when systematic trends are present .",
    "the detection threshold may be determined empirically from an analysis of the light curves of the general ensemble of stars which are usually dominated by true non - variable stars .    in a series of papers ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) we have been performing a variable star census for a range of galactic globular clusters of different metallicities .",
    "we have targeted clusters that are generally under - studied with regards to time - series photometry in the ccd era , and we aim to detect all the variables in the cluster field - of - view down to close to our magnitude limit . to avoid confusion over the variable star identifications for future researchers ,",
    "we provide detailed finding charts and accurate astrometry in addition to the light curves of the variable stars that we find .    specifically , we recently performed this task for ngc  5024 ( @xcite - from now on a11 ; @xcite - from now on a12 ) .",
    "we used the 2.0  m telescope of the indian astronomical observatory ( iao ) , hanle , india , equipped with an imaging camera with a pixel scale of 0.296 arcsec pix@xmath0 and a field - of - view ( fov ) of @xmath110.1@xmath210.1 arcmin@xmath3 , to obtain @xmath4 and @xmath5 time - series photometry with @xmath1300 epochs in each waveband observed during 18 nights spread out over @xmath12 years .",
    "our exposure times ranged from 25  s to 600  s in both filters , with the longer exposure times generally employed during the earlier observation nights .",
    "we reduced the image data using the technique of difference image analysis ( dia ) and specifically we used the dandia software ( @xcite ) for this purpose .",
    "we clarified the variable status , periods , and ephemerides of the previously known variables , including correcting the misidentification of three variables , and we presented the discovery of two new rr lyrae stars and 13 new sx phe stars .",
    "more recently , @xcite ( from now on ss11 ) used the same telescope and camera to obtain @xmath17.2 hours of continuous @xmath6-filter time - series photometry ( 101 epochs ) from a single night and using a single exposure time of 100  s. we therefore expect that the ss11 image properties are very similar to those of the a11 and a12 images ( e.g. cluster positioning , seeing , number of saturated stars , etc . ) .",
    "ss11 also reduced their image data using dandia , although the parameters used for the reduction process were not necessarily the same as those used in a11 and a12 .",
    "ss11 claim the detection of 74 new variable stars from the analysis of their data .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to investigate these new candidate variable stars in order to confirm their variable status using our more extensive photometric data base .",
    "we also take this opportunity to publish some corrections of mistakes in the literature regarding variable star identification and astrometric coordinates in appendix  a.",
    "a total of 74 stars are presented as candidate variables in ss11 ; namely , one standard star exhibiting suspected eclipses , 14 rr lyrae - type variables , 10 eclipsing binaries , 22 sx phe - type variables , and 27 other unclassified variables . in this section ,",
    "we investigate each set of candidate variables in turn .",
    "ss11 note that six stetson standard stars ( @xcite ) exhibit spurious variability with the same pattern in their light curves , which they explain as being caused by a deficiency in the data reduction process .",
    "however , star s240 is also suspected of showing the signature of an algol - type detached eclipsing binary with two suspected eclipses of depths @xmath10.05 and @xmath10.1  mag separated in time by @xmath12.5  h , although ultimately ss11 classify the variability seen in their light curve as spurious ( see their table  5 ) .",
    "we plot our @xmath4 light curve light curve does not exist in our data for this star because it lies on a bad column in the @xmath5 filter reference image . ] for s240 in figure  [ fig : nonvar1 ] using the same scale on the magnitude axis as that used in ss11 .",
    "our light curve shows some systematic photometric trends at the level of @xmath10.01 - 0.02  mag and we achieve a root - mean - square ( rms ) magnitude deviation in the light curve of @xmath19  mmag . given that our light curve includes multiple sections of continuous time - series photometry of durations greater than 4  h",
    ", we should be able to detect an eclipsing signal with period @xmath12.5  h and amplitude @xmath110 times our light curve noise .",
    "however , we detect no such signal , and we conclude that the eclipse - like signatures seen in the ss11 light curve of star s240 are artefacts of the data reduction process .      as described in @xcite , the dandia software measures the differential flux of each star in the difference images by optimally scaling the appropriate point - spread function ( psf ) model at the known star position ( as determined from the reference image ) while simultaneously fitting for a local background .",
    "the software stores the psf model as a circular image stamp of radius four times the fwhm and it follows that for star pairs in close spatial proximity their corresponding psf models may overlap",
    ". however , the dandia software only performs an independent fit to each star in a difference image and consequently the differential flux from a real variable may systematically influence the results of the psf fit to any nearby stars , with the effect being largest for the closest and faintest nearby stars .",
    "an easy way to spot if the flux variations from a nearby variable star have influenced the photometry of an otherwise constant star is to see if the light curves of both stars correlate , or if they have the same period and phase .",
    "ss11 present 14 candidate variables that are suspected of showing rr lyrae - type light curve variations .",
    "however , we find that candidates rr1 , rr2 , rr8 , rr12 , and rr14 lie within @xmath17.6 , 3.8 , 16.9 , 11.4 , and 20.2  pix , respectively , of the known rr lyrae variables v11 , v18 , v40 , v1 , and v58 , respectively .",
    "given that the typical psf fwhm of the ss11 observations is @xmath15  pix ( @xmath11.5  arcsec ) , these candidate variables have psfs that overlap substantially with the nearby rr lyrae star psfs .",
    "furthermore , these candidate variables are fainter than the known rr lyrae variables ( by @xmath11.5 - 2.5  mag ) and therefore we believe that the rr lyrae - like variations that are seen in the ss11 light curves of rr1 , rr2 , rr8 , rr12 , and rr14 are due to the systematic influence on the light curves from the nearby rr lyrae stars .    using the celestial coordinates from ss11 of the remaining rr lyrae - type variable candidates , we have identified these stars in our @xmath4 and @xmath5 reference images and found the corresponding light curves in our data base . candidates rr4 and rr5 are very faint in our reference images and we do not have the corresponding light curves",
    ". we can not therefore comment on the variations seen in these stars by ss11 . for rr3 , rr6 , rr7 , rr9 , rr10 , rr11 , and rr13",
    ", we plot our light curves in figure  [ fig : nonvar1 ] using black and red points for the @xmath4 and @xmath5 photometric measurements , respectively , and using the same scale on the magnitude axis for each candidate variable as that used in ss11 to enable a direct comparison .",
    "the @xmath5 light curves have been offset in magnitude by an amount that allows a clear comparison of the light curves between the two filters .",
    "note that the scatter in our light curves increases with time simply because our adopted exposure times were systematically reduced throughout our observing campaign .",
    "true photometric variability generally correlates between different filters whereas systematic trends in the photometry do not necessarily correlate but they may do . furthermore , systematic trends tend to exhibit similar temporal patterns between stars that are relatively close to each other in an image .",
    "candidates rr11 and rr13 are within 50 pix of each other and their @xmath4 light curves show similar trends with time , which is also the case for the @xmath6 lightcurves of these stars displayed in figure  11 of ss11 .",
    "also , these candidate variables are very close to a star that is highly saturated in both of our reference images which has a negative impact on the quality of the difference images in this region , explaining the particularly large amplitude of the trends in our light curves for these stars . later on in section  [ sec : unclass ] , we also conclude that the variable candidates vc18 , vc19 , and vc20 exhibit spurious variability due to their proximity to the same highly saturated star .",
    "for these reasons we do not believe that ss11 have detected true variability in stars rr11 and rr13 .",
    "our light curves for candidate variables rr7 and rr10 rule out the existence of the @xmath10.2 - 0.3  mag amplitude variations seen in the ss11 light curves of these stars .",
    "inspection of our light curves for rr3 , rr6 , and rr9 reveals that the trends present in our light curves do not generally correlate between filters ( e.g. see the night of 17/04/2009 ) , and certainly the trends do not reach the @xmath10.5 and 0.4  mag amplitudes seen in the ss11 light curves for rr6 and rr9 , respectively .",
    "we therefore believe that the larger - amplitude variations seen by ss11 and the smaller - amplitude variations seen in our light curves for these five candidates are due to trends introduced during the reduction process .",
    "finally , in this section we comment that all of the rr lyrae - type variable candidates rr1-rr14 as reported by ss11 are fainter ( @xmath7  mag ) than the horizontal branch of ngc  5024 ( @xmath8  mag ) , which implies that if they are rr lyrae stars , then they must lie behind the cluster relative to our sun , and therefore they can not be cluster members .",
    "it is highly unlikely that 14 galactic rr lyrae stars not associated with ngc  5024 lie within this @xmath110@xmath210  arcmin@xmath3 field of view .",
    "this conclusion is supported by the fact that over an area of @xmath110000  deg@xmath3 , @xcite found on average only @xmath10.5 rr lyrae stars per square degree down to @xmath9  mag . if any of these stars are eventually found to be true variables , then they are most likely to be of the sx phe type .      ss11 present 10 candidate variables that they classify as short - period contact eclipsing binaries .",
    "they determine a period for each candidate and present the phase - folded light curves . using the celestial coordinates from ss11 , we have found the corresponding @xmath4 and @xmath5 light curves in our data base .",
    "candidates w1 and w8 lie within @xmath114.2 and 15.4  pix of the known variables v33 ( rr lyrae type ) and v68 ( sr type - red giant ; highly saturated in our data ) , and for the same reasons as described in section  [ sec : rrlyrae ] , we do not believe that ss11 have detected true variability in these stars .",
    "however , candidate w9 is a true variable star , but it is not an eclipsing binary .",
    "instead it is the sx phe type variable v104 first detected by a11 . ss11",
    "derive a tentative period of @xmath10.15  d for v104 consistent with the much more precise period of @xmath10.14756  d from a11 .",
    "the periods determined by ss11 for any of their variable candidates are not appropriate for folding our light curves over the full time span of our observations ( @xmath12 years ) since they are derived from a time base of only @xmath17.2 hours .",
    "therefore , whenever we choose to plot phase - folded versions of our light curves using the periods from ss11 , we only plot the photometric data from the first three nights of observation ( 17 - 19th april 2009 ) since these nights are consecutive and the data have the best photometric precision in our time - series because they correspond to the longest exposure times of 600  s in @xmath4 and 420  s in @xmath5 .    in figure",
    "[ fig : eclbin ] , we plot our light curves for candidates w2-w6 , w11 , and w13 , phase - folded using the periods from ss11 .",
    "we do not have an @xmath5 light curve for candidate w13 because this star lies on a bad column in the @xmath5 filter reference image .",
    "ss11 list the amplitudes of the light curve variations in the @xmath6 band as @xmath11.22 , 0.49 , 0.75 , 0.30 , 0.60 , 0.54 , and 1.06  mag for the candidates w2 , w3 , w4 , w5 , w6 , w11 , and w13 , respectively , and these variations , if true , will have similar amplitudes in the @xmath4 and @xmath5 bands . inspection of our plotted light curves reveals that we can fully rule out the presence of these variations in the candidates w2 , w4 , w5 , w6 , and w13 . for w3 ,",
    "our light curves show a relatively large scatter , but it is clear that there are no coherent variations at the ss11 period .",
    "we therefore believe that the variations seen by ss11 are due to trends introduced during the reduction process .    for the variable candidate w11 , our phase - folded light curve in figure  [ fig : eclbin ] shows a hint of coherent variations at the ss11 period that match the shape of the ss11 phase - folded light curve , and",
    "therefore we tentatively confirm the variable nature of this star .",
    "however , the scatter in our light curve is sufficiently large that we believe that better precision follow - up observations are required before this candidate variable is assigned a proper v - number .",
    "we note that w11 has @xmath10  mag and @xmath11  mag , which places it outside the blue straggler region as marked in the colour - magnitude diagram ( cmd ; figure  4 in a11 ) .",
    "we also find that its period and mean magnitude are inconsistent with the p - l relation for sx phe cluster members ( see later in figure  [ fig : plrel ] ) , since the star is much too faint for such a long period . ] .",
    "we therefore can not speculate on the type of variability exhibited by w11 .    to quantify our conclusions about the candidate variables plotted in figure  [ fig : eclbin ] ,",
    "we calculate the improvement in chi - squared @xmath12 when fitting a sine - curve compared to a constant magnitude . under the null hypothesis that a light curve is not variable",
    ", the @xmath12 statistic follows a chi - squared distribution with two degrees of freedom .",
    "we set our threshold for rejection of the null hypothesis at 1% , which is equivalent to @xmath13 .",
    "candidate w11 has @xmath14  9.33 and 9.39 for the @xmath4 and @xmath5 light curves , respectively , supporting our tentative conclusion that it is variable .",
    "we plot the fitted constant and sine - curve models in the corresponding panel of figure  [ fig : eclbin ] as the dashed and continuous curves , respectively . for the remaining candidates shown in figure  [ fig : eclbin ] ,",
    "the maximum value of @xmath12 is @xmath14.42 , meaning that we do not detect any sinusoidal variability in our data at the ss11 periods .",
    "ss11 present 22 candidate variables that they classify as `` potential sx phe stars '' .",
    "they determine a period for each candidate and present the phase - folded light curves .",
    "again , using the celestial coordinates from ss11 , we have found the corresponding @xmath4 and @xmath5 light curves in our data base , except for the candidate sx13 where we can not find a star at the ss11 coordinates in our @xmath4 and @xmath5 reference images .",
    "candidate sx6 is the known sx phe variable star v78 first discovered by @xcite .",
    "candidates sx2 , sx3 , sx9_1 , sx11 , sx14 , sx19 , and sx22 are the sx phe variable stars v96 , v97 , v99 , v101 , v102 , v103 , and v105 first discovered by a11 .",
    "candidate sx9 , as noted by ss11 , is only @xmath14.2  pix from the true variable v99 , and its ss11 photometry has obviously been influenced by the flux variations from v99 because ss11 derive very similar periods and the same epoch for both stars .",
    "also , as acknowledged by ss11 , candidate sx25 is the known sx phe variable star v80 first discovered by @xcite .    in figure",
    "[ fig : sxphe ] , we plot our light curves for the candidates sx4 , sx7 , sx8 , sx12 , sx15 - 17 , sx20 , sx21 , sx23 , and sx24 , phase - folded using the periods from ss11 .",
    "we do not have an @xmath5 light curve for the candidate sx15 due to a failure of the dandia software to measure the reference flux of this star in the @xmath5 filter reference image . applying the same chi - squared analysis to these folded light curves as that described in section  [ sec : eclbin ] , we find that sx4 has @xmath14  14.43 and 10.22 , sx12 has @xmath14  8.18 and 10.86 , sx16 has @xmath14  23.05 and 3.79 , and sx21 has @xmath14  34.67 and 11.59 , all for the @xmath4 and @xmath5 filters , respectively .",
    "we therefore confirm the variability at the ss11 periods for the candidates sx4 , sx12 , sx16 , and sx21 , although we consider the candidate sx12 as border - line because the two @xmath12 values for the light curve lie only just above and below the detection threshold .",
    "we plot the fitted constant and sine - curve models in the corresponding panels of figure  [ fig : sxphe ] as the dashed and continuous curves , respectively .    for the remaining candidates sx7 , sx8 , sx15 , sx17 , sx20 , sx23 , and sx24 , the maximum value of @xmath12 is @xmath13.51 , and we conclude that our data do not show any variability at the ss11 periods . also , if the variations detected by ss11 in their light curves for these stars are due to true variability , then we should have been able to detect them since their measured amplitudes are considerably larger than the scatter in our light curves in all cases .",
    "therefore we believe that the variations seen in the ss11 light curves of these candidates are due to trends introduced during the reduction process .",
    "ss11 present 27 candidate variables `` that show definite light variations '' but which they are unable to classify . using the celestial coordinates from ss11",
    ", we have found the corresponding @xmath4 and @xmath5 light curves in our data base , except for candidate vc9 where the dandia pipeline has failed to measure the reference flux of this star in both the @xmath4 and @xmath5 filter reference images .",
    "candidates vc1 , vc2 , vc7 , vc11 , vc15 , vc16 , vc17 , vc21 , vc22 , and vc24 lie within @xmath13.7 , 4.0 , 3.7 , 20.4 , 20.2 , 3.5 , 13.3 , 4.4 , 4.7 , and 4.3  pix , respectively , of the known rr lyrae variables v33 , v42 , v64 , v46 , v72 , v53 , v63 , v45 , v9 , and v51 , respectively .",
    "inspection of the ss11 light curves for these candidates reveals that they mimic segments of rr lyrae light curves , and we believe that the variability detected by ss11 for these stars is due to the systematic influence on the light curves from the nearby rr lyrae stars .",
    "candidates vc18 , vc19 , and vc20 all lie within @xmath110  pix of the same highly saturated star that is also in the vicinity of the previously discussed candidates rr11 and rr13 ( see section  [ sec : rrlyrae ] ) .",
    "we believe that the poor quality of the difference images in such close proximity to a highly saturated star is the cause of the variations observed in the ss11 light curves for these stars .    in figure",
    "[ fig : nonvar2 ] , we plot our light curves for vc3 , vc5 , vc6 , vc8 , vc10 , vc12 - 14 , and vc25 - 28 using the same scale on the magnitude axis as that used in ss11 , and in figure  [ fig : nonvar1 ] , we plot our light curve for v80_7 , which was flagged as a suspected variable by ss11 during their investigation into the identification of v80 . as expected , all of our light curves show systematic trends at some level ( usually the few per cent level ) .",
    "however , for all of the candidates except vc27 and vc28 , the amplitudes of the variations in our light curves are considerably smaller than the amplitudes of the variations seen in the ss11 light curves .",
    "furthermore , the variations seen in our light curves do not generally correlate between wavebands on a reasonable fraction of nights .",
    "we also note that vc25 and vc26 are close to a saturated star .",
    "hence , on the basis of our data , we do not confirm the variability of the stars vc3 , vc5 , vc6 , vc8 , vc10 , vc12 - 14 , vc25 , vc26 , and v80_7 , and we believe that the variations seen by ss11 are most likely the signature of systematic errors introduced during the reduction process .    for candidate vc27 ,",
    "ss11 present a light curve with variations of amplitude @xmath10.15  mag , and our light curve is not of sufficient precision to definitively rule out such variations .",
    "however , the variations that are seen in our light curve for vc27 do not always correlate between wavebands ( e.g. see the night of 19/04/2009 ) . for candidate vc28 , our light curve on any single night does not show the @xmath10.3  mag variations seen in the ss11 light curve , and again the variations do not always correlate between wavebands ( e.g. see the night of 17/04/2009 ) .",
    "hence , we also do not confirm the variability of the stars vc27 and vc28 .",
    "in section  [ sec : sxphe ] , we confirm the variable nature of the candidates sx4 , sx16 , and sx21 from ss11 , and consequently , we assign them the new variable numbers v106 , v107 , and v108 , respectively . for future",
    "ease of identification , we provide the finding charts for these stars in figure  [ fig : find ] .",
    "we perform a frequency analysis of the light curves of these new variables using period04 ( @xcite ) , the results of which we report in table  [ tab : newvar ] , along with their mean magnitudes , colours , and celestial coordinates .",
    "we only detect one dominant frequency for each variable , which we use to plot the stars in figure  [ fig : plrel ] as solid red circles .",
    "this figure displays the p - l relation for the sx phe stars in ngc  5024 and it is an updated version of figure  12 from a11 . v106 and v108 follow the fundamental mode p - l relation for the cluster and they also lie in the blue straggler region of the cmd ( figure 4 of a11 ) .",
    "hence we classify v106 and v108 as sx phe stars pulsating in the fundamental ( @xmath15 ) mode .",
    "v107 lies above the p - l relations for the fundamental , first , and second overtone pulsators in the cluster , and it also lies close to but outside of the blue straggler region in the cmd .",
    "however , v107 is blended with a brighter star ( see figure  [ fig : find ] ) and therefore it is likely that the reference flux for this variable is over - estimated . assuming that v107 is actually an sx phe variable , which is an assumption consistent with its short period , then",
    "the blending could explain why it is brighter than the cluster p - l relation and why its colour places it outside of the blue straggler region .",
    "we therefore tentatively classify v107 as an sx phe variable for which we can not speculate on the mode(s ) in which it is pulsating .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : lc ]",
    "ss11 consider a combination of several statistics to select their 74 candidate variable stars .",
    "for each of their @xmath110@xmath16 light curves , they calculate an alarm statistic @xmath17 ( @xcite ) , an excess variance statistic @xmath18 ( @xcite ) , the lomb periodogram significance level @xmath15 at the best - fit period ( @xcite ) , and the rms magnitude deviation @xmath19 .",
    "they then devise the following combined criterion for selecting variable star candidates : @xmath20 which selects 310 candidate variables .",
    "ss11 then rejected variable star candidates within 20  pix of the image edges and within 10  pix of known variable stars ( although this last rejection criterion was obviously not applied properly ) , and used visual inspection to make the final selection of 74 candidates .    as pointed out in a12 , the alarm statistic @xmath17 is flawed for variable star detection because of the normalisation by @xmath21 in its definition .",
    "large amplitude variable stars have long runs of large residuals , but also a very high @xmath21 statistic , meaning that true large - amplitude variables yield undesirably small values for @xmath17 .",
    "therefore we are sceptical that the constraint on the @xmath17 statistic applied in ss11 was actually useful for discriminating variable from non - variable stars .",
    "both the lomb periodogram significance level @xmath15 and the excess variance statistic @xmath18 are highly dependent on the accuracy of the estimated uncertainties on the photometric data points",
    ". under - estimation of the uncertainties leads to smaller values for @xmath15 and larger values for @xmath18 , and vice versa .",
    "since there is no discussion in ss11 of how the thresholds on @xmath15 and @xmath18 were chosen , it is not clear how appropriate the adopted thresholds are .",
    "the rms diagram presented in figure  8 of ss11 shows that @xmath22  mag for all stars fainter than @xmath117.5  mag in the @xmath6-waveband .",
    "therefore the threshold on @xmath19 chosen by ss11 does not discriminate variable stars from non - variable stars except for the brightest stars in the sample .",
    "when searching for variability via the @xmath19 statistic , it is more appropriate to set a magnitude depedendent threshold determined from the rms diagram itself ( see the vidrih index defined in section  3.1 of @xcite ) since the rms magnitude deviation is a magnitude dependent quantity that is generally larger for fainter stars .",
    "setting the variability detection threshold is a very important process that can be used to minimise the rate of false positive detections and maximise the number of detections of true variables .",
    "our investigation into the candidate variables presented by ss11 clearly shows that the vast majority of their candidates are false positive detections with only a few detections of true variability , which means that they set their detection threshold too low .",
    "in fact , in ss11 , there is no assessment of the impact of random noise , the accuracy of the estimated photometric uncertainties , and the systematic trends in the light curves on the actual detection thresholds that should be applied in order to minimise the number of false positives . assuming that the estimated photometric uncertainties are correct and that there are no systematic trends in the light curves , then monte carlo simulations employing the photometric uncertainties on the light curve data points may be used to determine the detection threshold required to achieve a desired rate of false positives .",
    "however , in practice , the estimated photometric uncertainties are usually inaccurate and systematic trends almost certainly exist in the light curves ( as evidenced already in the light curve plots from both ss11 and this paper ) . therefore , an appropriate detection threshold can only be determined from analysis of the distribution of the detection statistic(s ) for the light curves of the ensemble of stars under the assumption that the majority of stars are non - variable .",
    "we have investigated the 74 candidate variable stars presented by ss11 . we could not investigate four of these candidates because they are either too faint ( three cases ) or the dandia software failed to measure a reference flux on either reference image ( one case ) . of the remaining 70 candidates",
    ", we find that 14 are true variable stars , 10 of which were already discovered in previous works ( although only 2 of these were available in the literature at the time of the ss11 paper submission ) , and four of which are new discoveries .",
    "we assign the variable star numbers v106-v109 to the newly discovered variables .",
    "we classify v106-v108 as sx phe type variables whose discovery is attributed to ss11 , and we classify v109 as an sr type variable discovered in this paper .",
    "we also tentatively confirm the presence of true variability in two other candidates .    from the analysis of our data",
    ", we strongly suggest that the other 54 candidate variable stars ( or the majority of such ) presented by ss11 are false positive detections where systematic trends in the light curves have been mistaken for true variability . for 17 of these cases",
    ", we can explain the systematic trends as having been caused by their proximity to known rr lyrae variables which are much brighter , and for 8 of these cases , the trends are due to their proximity to saturated stars which reduce the local quality of the difference images . for the remaining 29 candidates , investigation of our light curves does not yield any evidence of true variability at the amplitudes reported by ss11 , and any lower amplitude variations that we do see do not generally show the correlations between wavebands typical of true variability , which leads us to conclude that in these cases , the variations seen in the ss11 light curves are due to trends introduced during the reduction process .",
    "aaf is thankful of the support from the dgapa - unam grant through project in104612 .",
    "we would like to thank christine clement for her helpful comments on the ss11 paper .",
    "briefly in this appendix , we clarify some mistakes in the literature regarding variable star identification and astrometric coordinates .    in table  2 of a11 , there is a typo in the coordinates for v43 .",
    "the coordinates should read : ra  @xmath23 , dec .",
    "@xmath24 , j2000 .    in a11 ,",
    "we did not report the celestial coordinates of v53 , which is highly blended . for completeness",
    ", we have measured these coordinates on the difference images where the variable star is not blended and we report them here as : ra  @xmath25 , dec .",
    "@xmath26 , j2000 .",
    "these coordinates correspond to the epoch of our @xmath4 reference image which is the heliocentric julian date @xmath12455249.332",
    "d.    we note that ss11 arrive at the same conclusion as a11 about the previous misidentifications in the literature of the variables v57 and v72 , and the non - variability of v81 , v82 , and v83 .",
