    "the accelerating expansion of the universe is one of the most important issues of modern cosmology , which has been discovered and verified by supernova @xcite , cmb @xcite and bao @xcite observations ( see also recent reviews @xcite ) .",
    "after the discovery of this scenario , a great variety of attempts have been done to explain this acceleration ( see the reviews @xcite ) . among these alternatives , @xmath0cdm is the simplest and most nature one , which fits the observational data best . in this scenario ,",
    "the dark energy is associated to the energy density of the quantum vacuum .",
    "briefly put , the dark energy is the energy stored on the true vacuum state of all existing fields in the universe , i.e. @xmath7 , where @xmath0 is the cosmological constant .",
    "however , it is embarrassed by cosmological constant problems , namely the fine - tuning problem and the coincidence problem @xcite .",
    "several possible approaches have be adopted to explain or alleviate the cosmological constant problems @xcite , though there is no convincing fundamental theory for why vacuum energy dominance happened only recently . the possibility that if @xmath0 is not a real constant but is time variable or dynamical , the cosmological problems may be alleviated or removed , was considered many years ago @xcite .",
    "this kind of models can be called as @xmath4cdm models . the traditional approach for @xmath4cdm models was first to specify a phenomenological time - dependence form for @xmath4 and then establish a cosmological scenario .",
    "there are a lot of proposals of the phenomenological forms for @xmath4 in the literature @xcite , such as @xmath8 and @xmath9 . in our scenario",
    ", @xmath4 is determined based on its relation with the cosmological length scale or time scale .",
    "as it is known , in the de sitter universe , any nonzero @xmath0 can introduce a length scale @xmath10 and time scale @xmath11 , as the form @xmath12 into einstein s theory @xcite , where @xmath13 is the speed of light and throughout this letter we use the unit @xmath14 .",
    "conversely , a cosmological length scale and time scale may introduce a @xmath2 into einstein s theory @xmath15 obviously , when the length scale or time scale is time variable , a time varying @xmath0 can be obtained .",
    "the key problem is how to choose a proper cosmological length scale or time scale to obtain a tiny @xmath0 .",
    "however , we have not acquired the first physical principle to determine the length or time scale recently .",
    "nevertheless , one can immediately relate these length or time scales to the biggest natural length scales , including the hubble horizon , the particle horizon and the future event horizon , and natural time scales , including the age of the universe and the conformal time .",
    "the cosmological constant derived from the length scale can be called as _ horizon cosmological constant _ @xcite , and",
    "the one derived from the time scale can be called as _ age cosmological constant _ @xcite .    once mentioning the length scale and time scale , one may easily associate them with the holographic and agegraphic dark energy . based on the holographic principle , cohen et al .",
    "@xcite suggested a relation between the ir cut - off and the uv cut - off in the quantum field theory . for a system with size @xmath16 representing the ir cut - off and",
    "uv cut - off @xmath0 relating to the quantum zero - point energy , without decaying into a black hole of the same size , it is required that the total energy in a region of size @xmath16 should not exceed the mass of a black hole of the same size , namely @xmath17 . when this inequality is reduced to an equality",
    "@xmath18 @xmath16 takes the maximum value , where @xmath19 is the reduced planck mass and @xmath20 is a numerical factor .",
    "recently , three length scales of the universe : the hubble horizon , the particle horizon and the future event horizon , have been taken as the role of ir cut - off .",
    "however , when the hubble horizon and the particle horizon are chosen as the ir cut - off , non - accelerated expansion universe can be achieved .",
    "li @xcite proposed to take the future event horizon as the ir cut - off leading to the holographic dark energy model which can derive an accelerated expansion universe .",
    "also , this model has been constrained with different observational data and is consistent with the data @xcite . however , it is embarrassed on the fundamental level due to its assumption that the current properties of the dark energy are determined by the future evolution of the universe , which is the so - called causality problem @xcite .",
    "what s more , it has been pointed out that this model can be inconsistent with the age of the universe @xcite .",
    "recently , based on the krolyhzy uncertainty relation @xmath21 together with the time - energy uncertainty relation , also called the heisenberg uncertainty relation @xmath22 , one can estimate the quantum energy density of the metric fluctuations of minkowski space - time that is @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is a numerical factor representing some uncertainties . in the above context , @xmath25 is a numerical factor of order one , @xmath26 is the reduced planck time , and throughout this letter , the units @xmath27 are adopted , so that one has @xmath28 with @xmath29 and @xmath30 being the reduced planck length and mass , respectively . recently ,",
    "two time scales of the universe : the age of the universe and the conformal time , have been taken as the role of @xmath31 , corresponding to the agegraphic dark energy @xcite and the new agegraphic dark energy @xcite .",
    "both of the models can derive an accelerated expansion universe , and is consistent with the recent observational data @xcite .",
    "they two also can resolve the causality problem , however , it has been presented that the agegraphic dark energy model is classically unstable , and the new agegraphic dark energy model is no better than the holographic dark energy model for the description of the dark energy - dominated universe @xcite . after a brief introduction of the holographic and agegraphic dark energy , one may be more interested in that whether there are some relationships between them and the @xmath4cdm models investigated in this letter .",
    "the corresponding problems will be discussed in sections iii and iv .",
    "the letter is organized as follows . in section ii , the basic equations of the time variable cosmological constant models are given . in section iii , three length scales and two time scales will be considered to derive the time variable cosmological constant models , and constraints from the recent observational data are illustrated .",
    "furthermore , the relationships between the time variable cosmological constant models and the holographic dark energy and agegraphic dark energy are investigated .",
    "finally , we provide our conclusion and discussion in section iv .",
    "considering the einstein field equation @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the energy - momentum tensor of matter and radiation , one sees by bianchi identities that when the energy - momentum tensor is conserved , namely @xmath34 , it follows necessarily that @xmath0 is a constant . to accommodate the running of @xmath0 with the cosmic time , namely @xmath35 , the most obvious way is to shift @xmath36 to the right - hand side of eq .",
