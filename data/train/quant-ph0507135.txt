    "we first of all propose a simple definition of a thermal squeezed state .",
    "previous definitions of thermal coherent states and squeezed states@xcite have used the thermofield approach of takahashi and umezawa@xcite .",
    "an early paper by vourdas@xcite discusses the superposition of squeezed states with thermal photons ; a more recent paper@xcite considers only the case of thermal coherent states .",
    "an early study of canonically transformed thermal states similar to the approach of the present work was made in @xcite , and also in @xcite .",
    "two further papers adopt essentially the same definition as the present note s@xcite using a slightly different approach . the method that we take here",
    "is the straightforward one of defining the hamiltonian whose eigenstates are squeezed states ( sometimes known as squeezed - coherent states to distinguish them from squeezed vacuum states ) .",
    "the complete set of eigenstates are in fact squeezed displaced number states .",
    "these are the states @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the displacement operator , and @xmath2 the squeezing operator .",
    "the thermal squeezed state we define is simply a mixed state given as a thermal sum of these states .",
    "the simplicity of this approach in , for example , calculating thermal averages is due to the group - theoretical structure of these states , which essentially enables such calculations to be reduced to free hamiltonian averages .",
    "this structure is a consequence of the definition of the squeezed - coherent states as transformed vacua under the automorphism group of the canonical commutation relations , which we shall describe in the next section .    to exemplify how the physical properties are degraded by the thermalization process",
    ", we calculate the important signal - to - quantum noise ratio for these thermal squeezed states .",
    "finally , we use the kraus formalism to propose a model for the thermalization .",
    "the canonical commutation relations for the boson ( photon ) creation and annihilation operators @xmath3 and @xmath4 are @xmath5=i.$ ] we shall consider canonical transformations of the form @xmath6 the approach of this note is to consider the relevant quantum optics states as vacuum states for the transformed operator @xmath7 . the _ vacuum state _ is defined as the normalized state satisfying @xmath8 we note that the vacuum state corresponding to @xmath7 , defined by @xmath9 is given by @xmath10 in the spirit of our approach , the ordinary vacuum state corresponds to the trivial unitary transformation @xmath11 , @xmath12 with @xmath13 less trivially , we shall now consider some important states which may be considered in the same light .    *",
    "* coherent states * these states correspond to the ( next ) most simple canonical transformation , that corresponding to @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the unit operator .",
    "this canonical transformation is generated by the unitary displacement operator @xmath16 which operates on @xmath4 by @xmath17 the vacuum state of @xmath7 is the coherent state @xmath18 and the vacuum equation for @xmath7 is @xmath19 which is equivalent to @xmath20 this is the usual coherent state@xcite @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the normalization , and has all the well - known properties , such as minimizing the heisenberg uncertainty principle . *",
    "* squeezed vacuum * this state corresponds to the canonical transformation @xmath23 , @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 satisfy @xmath27 here @xmath28 is the squeezing operator , given by @xmath29 where we have put @xmath30 the squeezed vacuum satisfying @xmath19 is given by @xmath31 ; that is , it satisfies @xmath32 + the 2-parameter operator @xmath28 is not the most general element of the 3-parameter vacuum - squeezing group @xmath33 an additional operator @xmath34 , where @xmath35 supplies the third parameter and completes the generators of the group . * * squeezed states * standard squeezed states correspond to the canonical transformation @xmath36 where @xmath37 the squeezed state @xmath38 thus defined may be written explicitly as @xmath39 and satisfies the usual equation@xcite @xmath40    we tabulate the above results in table 1 .",
    ".canonical transformations and corresponding states [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the motivation for the foregoing observations is the following . since we have an explicit unitary transformation @xmath41 from the vacuum to a squeezed state , we have analogously the transformation from a free thermal state to our thermal squeezed state .",
    "this enables any calculations involving the thermal squeezed state to be performed very easily . and",
    "this may be expedited further by using the following 3-dimensional representation of the automorphism group of the canonical commutation relations generated by @xmath42 , which we may call the _ squeezing group _ @xmath43 .",
    "this is a 5-parameter group corresponding to the action of the semi - direct sum of the 3-dimensional heisenberg - weyl algebra ( the central element of this algebra acts trivially ) and the 3-dimensional algebra @xmath44 on @xmath45 and is a subgroup of the inhomogeneous pseudounitary group @xmath46 with fundamental representation @xmath47\\ ; \\ ; \\ ; \\ ; \\ ; ( \\lambda,\\mu,\\alpha \\in { \\mathcal c } ; \\ ; \\ ; |\\lambda|^2-|\\mu|^2=1).\\ ] ] the value of this representation is due to the fact that for any operator @xmath48 the inverse transformed operator @xmath49 may be simply obtained by use of the inverse matrix @xmath50 @xmath51\\ ] ] where @xmath52 we shall make extensive use of this inverse transformation in the calculations which follow .",
    "we define a thermal squeezed state quite conventionally as that obtained in the usual way from a hamiltonian .",
    "our starting point is the single - mode free boson hamiltonian ( harmonic oscillator ) @xmath53=1\\ ] ] with complete eigenspectrum @xmath54 .",
    "we shall use the unitary transformation defined in the preceding section to produce the following hamiltonian with which to define our thermal states , writing the @xmath55 dependence explicitly .",
    "@xmath56 where @xmath57 explicitly @xmath58 the eigenstates of @xmath59 are @xmath60 which are squeezed ( displaced ) number states .",
    "the partition function @xmath61 for the hamiltonian eq.([ham1 ] ) is just the standard @xmath62 since the trace is invariant under the unitary transformation eq.([trans ] ) .",
    "we define the thermal squeezed state @xmath63 by means of the hamiltonian eq.([ham1 ] ) in the usual way @xmath64 thermal averages in the state @xmath63 are immediate due to the unitary equivalence with the free thermal state @xmath65 defined in terms of the free boson hamiltonian . generally , for the operator @xmath48 , the thermal average is @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the free thermal average .",
    "as mentioned above , such thermal averages are simply evaluated using the inverse transformation @xmath50 of eq.([inverse ] ) .",
    "for example , the thermal averages of the quadratures are given by @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the average number of photons in the _ free thermal state_. we obtain here the same expressions as for the @xmath70-added squeezed state@xcite with @xmath71 substituted for @xmath70 .",
    "in an important yet elementary paper , yuen@xcite showed that the absolute optimal value for the signal - to - noise ratio @xmath72 in a quantum system is given by @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the photon intensity ( number of photons per unit time ) .",
    "this limiting ratio is in fact attained by a standard squeezed state .",
    "it requires only a straightforward calculation to evaluate the corresponding optimal ratio @xmath75 in a thermal squeezed state , following the methods of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we assume that the maximum photon intensity @xmath74 is used , that all the signal is in one quadrature @xmath76 , so that @xmath77 we then optimize @xmath78 with respect to @xmath79 subject to the constraint given by eqs([avs1 ] , [ avs2 ] ) @xmath80 eq.([sig2 ] ) is minimal for real @xmath81 , so that @xmath82 , giving @xmath83 the optimal value is given by @xmath84 which value is attained for @xmath85    as noted , @xmath71 is the average number of photons in the _ free thermal state _",
    "@xmath86    in the figure we show how the yuen limit is degraded by increasing temperature @xmath87 for our thermal squeezed states .",
    "( we have normalized @xmath88 to the optimal @xmath89 value @xmath90 , and measure @xmath87 in units of @xmath91 . )",
    "another advantage of the unitary transformation approach described above is that it enables us to relate the thermalization of squeezed states to that of the free boson vacuum state . since we are not interested here in details of the dissipative evolution of our system , we eschew the more usual lindblad differential equation approach and use the global , kraus formulation@xcite .",
    "this gives the dissipative transformation of the state @xmath92 as @xmath93 where @xmath94 and the operators ( matrices ) @xmath95 are otherwise arbitrary .",
    "it is clear that this preserves both the positivity of @xmath92 and the tr @xmath96 property .",
