    "the finding of the diminishing size of the crab synchrotron nebula with increasing frequency supports the picture that energetic electrons are injected in the vicinity of the pulsar and lose energy to synchrotron radiation in the larger nebula @xcite .",
    "the radial emission profiles were first modeled as a central particle source with diffusion into the larger nebula @xcite . @xcite specified a termination shock in the pulsar wind as the source of the particle acceleration and viewed the outer part of the nebula as a place where the pulsar magnetic field winds up and the flow decelerates .",
    "this view was put on a firmer basis by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter kc ) , who calculated the conditions at the relativistic mhd shock and followed the time independent downstream flow of fields and particles . this 1-dimensional model with advected particles",
    "was able to reproduce the observed sizes of the optical and x - ray emission in the crab nebula , but did not address the radio emission .",
    "high resolution imaging of the crab with the _ hubble _ telescope at optical wavelengths and _ chandra _ at x - ray wavelengths shows an active system of toroidal filaments and jets close to the pulsar in line with the expected position of the termination shock @xcite .",
    "these observations have motivated 2-dimensional mhd simulations , which allow for a polar angle dependence of the pulsar wind power @xcite . in these models ,",
    "the wind is stronger in the equatorial plane , producing the toroidal filaments .",
    "hoop stresses in the shocked flow bring material back to the axis to form the jets .",
    "current models for the filaments are able to reproduce many aspects of the filaments ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) , including the integrated spectrum of the crab from radio to tev @xcite and the time variability of the inner structure @xcite .",
    "the jet - torus structure near the pulsar has been commonly observed in x - ray images of pulsar nebulae @xcite , and the structure is presumed to be a standard feature of pulsar nebulae .",
    "although models for the toroidal filaments are now convincing , the nature of the flow beyond the filaments to the edge of the nebula remains uncertain .",
    "the primary way of exploring the particle transport is to model the structure of the nebulae at different photon energies or , equivalently , the structure and photon index distribution .",
    "the crucial point is that the particles lose energy to synchrotron radiation as they age so that the photon index distribution provides a good test of the particle transport mechanism .",
    "provided the magnetic field is not strongly varying , the spectral index in a particular location gives information on the mean age of the particles .",
    "observations of the crab nebula at optical @xcite and infrared @xcite wavelengths show a monotonic change in spectral index from the center to the edge of the nebula , where edge is defined by the decrease in surface brightness at that particular wavelength .",
    "the well - known bays in the crab are asymmetric structures , but the spectral index at the bay edge is similar to that at other edges . the data do not indicate a highly asymmetric flow in the nebula .",
    "thus , we assume spherical symmetry in our models .    in section  2 of this paper",
    ", we discuss issues with existing models for the larger scale flow and , in section  3 , consider a diffusion / advection model for the particle propagation .",
    "the model is applied to the phase when the pulsar wind nebula ( hereafter pwn ) is expanding into the freely expanding supernova gas , before a reverse shock front moves in due to interaction with the surroundings .",
    "we concentrate on comparing our models to the crab nebula , 3c 58 and g21.50.9 because they are the best observed pwne within that phase . in section  4 , we discuss the diffusion process .",
    "current data on the crab nebula convincingly show that there is a relativistic flow in the interior that must slow to match the outer boundary @xcite . the issue treated in this paper",
    "is how the particles are transported between the inner , toroidal region and the outer boundary of the pwn . in the kc model , the particles",
    "are advected with a toroidal magnetic field .",
    "cross field scattering of particles is expected to be small ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so that diffusion of particles can be neglected .",
    "problems with this model in reproducing the spectral index distributions in young pwne have been raised @xcite .",
    "this issue is discussed in detail in the next section . here",
    "we note some other points relevant to the toroidal field model for the outer structure .    in the crab nebula ,",
    "the x - ray emission is from a region close to the pulsar because of synchrotron burn - off .",
    "if one goes to optical wavelengths , where the particles have longer lifetimes , an analysis of the polarization shows that there are @xmath0 magnetic elements across the nebula with possible smaller scale structure @xcite .",
    "@xcite find that magnetic structure in the crab only extends down to about 20 arcsec , or 0.2 pc .",
    "@xcite presented deep _",
    "images of the crab , finding evidence for fingers with a roughly radial orientation ; the spectral index structure implied rapid diffusion along the structures , presumably oriented along the magnetic field and slow diffusion perpendicular to the fingers . the x - ray emitting particles in 3c 58 have",
    "longer lifetimes and imaging x - ray studies with _ chandra _ show many magnetic loops without a clear toroidal structure , except close to the pulsar @xcite ; the x - ray filaments are related to ones observed at radio wavelengths and with some optical filaments ( thermal gas ) .",
    "overall , there is little evidence for toroidal structure in pulsar nebulae except near the central pulsars .",
    "two pwne that do show evidence for toroidal field structure are the small nebula around the vela pulsar @xcite and g106.6 + 2.9 @xcite ; however , these objects are probably in a different evolutionary stage than the crab , without an unstable outer boundary @xcite .",
    "the crab nebula , with radio spectral index @xmath1 @xcite where flux @xmath2 , shows little radio spectral index variation over the entire nebula , to within 0.01 @xcite , although pwne themselves show a range of spectral indices , e.g. , 3c 58 has @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "there is no indication that the spectral index observed in the crab is a universal value , so the uniformity of spectral index is surprising .",
    "g21.50.9 also has a fairly uniform radio spectral index image @xcite , as well as 3c 58 @xcite .",
    "these observational considerations support the view that , although there is clearly toroidal structure where the pulsar wind impacts the larger nebula , the flow is more radial in the outer nebula and there is evidence for a mixing process .",
    "there are several possible reasons for the apparent mixing of energetic particles .",
    "the acceleration of the supernova ejecta by the pulsar bubble is rayleigh - taylor unstable @xcite .",
    "the structure observed in the thermal gas filaments in the crab nebula and other pwne is likely due to this instability @xcite , although there are still uncertainties about how the instability operates when the low density fluid is magnetized @xcite .",
    "as discussed by @xcite , there is evidence in the crab for magnetic field lines being ` draped ' around thermal filaments and stretched in the radial direction .",
    "the crab filaments cover the velocity range @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "another possibility is the action of instabilities occurring at or near the pulsar wind termination shock @xcite .",
    "instabilities right at the shock front may not be compatible with the apparent regular structure observed in the case of the newly formed nebula around the vela pulsar @xcite",
    ". there may be feedback between instabilities near the termination shock and the outer boundary . in their axisymmetric numerical simulations ,",
    "@xcite find that waves and vortices in the larger nebula feed back on the structure at the termination shock , which in turn generates more structure in the nebula .",
    "@xcite note that it is impossible to distinguish between the cause and the effect . in addition",
    ", some thermal gas from the supernova is entrained in the unstable region , explaining the optical filaments seen in association with nonthermal filaments in the crab and 3c 58 .",
    "these observational and theoretical considerations show that , although the region close to the pulsar has a clear toroidal structure , the larger nebula has a complex structure that includes a radial component to the magnetic field . as summarized by @xcite , there are layers of magnetic fields folded on top of each other such that adjoining field lines in one place move away from each other .",
    "although diffusion across magnetic field lines is expected to be small , even a small amount of cross field transport could result in thorough mixing , with this magnetic field configuration .",
    "we thus consider models with radial diffusion .",
    "one uncertainty for the models is the degree to which particles are transmitted through the outer boundary of the pwn .",
    "the expectation is that the pwn magnetic field is contained within the wind bubble , which is bounded by supernova ejecta in young pwne ; the outer boundary of the crab nebula shows loop structures at radio wavelengths that are likely to delineate the magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the characteristic mean free path for particles to cross the magnetic field is limited to the particle gyroradius ( bohm limit ) @xmath5 where the particle energy , @xmath6 , corresponds to an energy of synchrotron radiation through @xmath7 and @xmath8 is the magnetic field .",
    "the escape time for bohm diffusion from a region of size @xmath9 is then @xcite @xmath10 which is long compared to the ages of the pwne considered here ( @xmath11 yr ) , particularly for particles radiating below x - ray wavelengths .",
    "however , there is some chance for escape from a narrow region close to the edge of the nebula .    an observational test for the transmission of particles would be synchrotron emission from energetic particles that have left the main pwn .",
    "there has been little evidence for such emission , but @xcite have recently found x - ray emission around a number of pwne , which they interpret as synchrotron emission from escaped particles . to have x - ray emitting particles extend to such large radial distances",
    "requires a surprisingly low magnetic field strength in order to avoid synchrotron losses .",
    "one of the pwne discussed by @xcite is g21.50.9 , which is also one of the primary remnants treated here .",
    "however , there are other interpretations for the extended emission .",
    "@xcite attributed the emission to a combination of a dust scattering halo plus emission from a surrounding shell ; @xcite have shown clear evidence for shell emission .",
    "escape of electrons and positrons from pwne has also come up in the context of a possible source for features in the galactic cosmic ray spectrum of electrons and positrons ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ". however , the escape can be from elderly pwne ( @xmath12 yr old ) , and does not require escape from young objects like those discussed here ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite suggested the escape of particles from the vela x pwn to explain the steeper particle spectrum in the outer parts of the nebula ; however , this is an older nebula that has likely been affected by the reverse shock wave @xcite .",
    "overall , particle escape in pwne with ages @xmath11 yr does not appear likely . in section 3.2 , we model the effect of the outer boundary condition for the pwn .    in the early diffusion models for the crab nebula @xcite , the diffusion coefficient was assumed to be constant with energy , and that is the assumption that we make in most of our modeling .",
    "@xcite argued for a constant coefficient based on the fact that the diffusion length is likely to be related to the size of magnetic filaments and is much larger than the gyroradius .",
    "however , there are reasons to consider energy dependent diffusion of the form @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is a constant . on the observational side ,",
    "cosmic rays are known to diffuse from the galaxy in an energy dependent way ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the data indicate @xmath15 , with a diffusion coefficient of @xmath16 @xmath17 s@xmath18 at a reference particle energy of 1 gev @xcite .",
    "interstellar turbulence is thought to play a role in the energy dependent diffusion .",
    "also , there is the possibility that the diffusion coefficient is proportional to the particle gyroradius , as in bohm diffusion , leading to @xmath19 .",
    "this `` bohm - type '' value of @xmath14 is used by @xcite and @xcite in their modeling of evolved pwne .",
    "however , the diffusion length is much larger than the particle gyroradius , so there is not a clear argument for @xmath19 in the pwn case .",
    "we consider the possible effect of energy dependent diffusion in section 3.1 .",
    "@xcite first showed that the spatial and spectral distribution of the crab nebula in the optical could be explained by a diffusion model with synchrotron radiation losses .",
    "observations of 3c 58 @xcite and g21.5 - 0.9 @xcite taken by _",
    "chandra _ also gave a photon index distribution that is similar to the optical spectral index distribution in the crab and is incompatible with the kc model @xcite .",
    "although observations of the crab clearly show evidence for a relativistic wind close to the pulsar , a pure diffusion model illustrates one limiting case of the expected particle transport .",
    "we used the pure diffusion model developed by @xcite to fit the spectral index distribution of crab from radio to optical , and 3c 58 and g21.5 - 0.9 in x - rays .",
    "we also used the model to calculate the half light radius of the crab from radio to x - rays .",
    "this is the same model used by @xcite in his model for the crab .",
    "the model assumes that a point source injects particles into an infinite space with spherical symmetry , and the injected particles follow a power law distribution @xmath20 .",
    "the transport mechanism for the injected particles is diffusion . in order to satisfy the spherical symmetry assumption ,",
    "the objects we discuss in this paper are young pwne that are observed to have approximate spherical symmetry . in our initial model",
    "we have a pre - defined pwn radius @xmath9 ; when we calculate the half light radius and integrated spectrum , we only consider the particles that are within the nebular radius @xmath9 , reasoning that the magnetic field in the freely expanding ejecta outside @xmath9 is small .",
    "the outer nebular boundary is a transmitting boundary .",
    "the model also assumes that the diffusion coefficient @xmath21 and magnetic field @xmath8 inside @xmath9 are constant with radius .",
    "here we neglect the adiabatic expansion energy losses and assume synchrotron radiation loss is the only energy loss , so that @xmath22 , where @xmath23 in cgs units and @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "we examine the assumptions of point source injection , pure diffusion , and a transmitting boundary in section 3.2 . in this section",
    "we use this simple pure diffusion model to analyze the spectral index distribution and half light radius of pwne .    based on these assumptions ,",
    "the number density distribution @xmath25 is @xcite @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 the lower limit @xmath29 of the integral @xmath30 is @xmath31 if there is no upper limit for the injection particle energy . here",
    "@xmath32 is the age of the nebula .    in order to simplify the calculation of the emission",
    ", we further assume that all the radiated power @xmath33 of an electron of energy @xmath34 goes into radiation of a frequency @xmath35 corresponding to the maximum synchrotron radiation power .",
    "therefore @xmath36,\\ ] ] where @xmath37 is a constant , and @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the mass and charge of an electron , and @xmath41 is the particle pitch angle .",
    "here we assume @xmath42 , yielding @xmath43 erg .",
    "the spectral index distribution @xmath44 between frequency @xmath45 and @xmath46 is given by @xmath47}{\\log(\\nu_1/\\nu_2 ) } } \\nonumber \\\\    & & = \\frac{\\log(\\nu_1/\\nu_2)^{1/2}+\\log[n_{tot}(\\nu_1,r)/n_{tot}(\\nu_2,r)]}{\\log(\\nu_1/\\nu_2)},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath48 is the total number of particles emitted per unit area per unit time , per unit frequency with frequency @xmath35 and at radius @xmath49 from a central point source after integration along the line of sight .",
    "@xcite assumed a point source which makes @xmath50 a singularity in @xmath48 .",
    "we performed integrations along the line of sight starting at a cutoff radius , but this did not affect the larger scale results .",
    "there is a critical energy for synchrotron cooling , @xmath51 , which is relevant for the number density distribution @xmath25 . if @xmath52 , @xmath25 reaches a steady state solution @xmath53 .",
    "if @xmath54 , only particles with @xmath55 contribute to the spectrum at the frequency @xmath35 and @xmath25 evolves with time .",
    "the corresponding peak synchrotron radiation frequency of particle with @xmath56 is @xmath57 if the injected particles have an upper limit of energy @xmath58 , the lower limit @xmath29 of the integral @xmath30 changes to @xmath59 and the critical energy becomes @xmath60 .",
    "when the energy range of interest satisfies @xmath61 , the @xmath58 term in @xmath29 is not important and can be neglected , which means we can assume the injection particle energy has no upper limit .",
    "a plausible estimate for @xmath58 is that the gyroradius of the particle equals to the termination shock radius , @xmath62 , or @xmath63 for a relativistic electron .",
    "we then have @xmath64 and the corresponding peak synchrotron emission frequency is @xmath65 for the objects considered in this paper , electron energy injection with no upper limit is always a good assumption for frequencies below soft x - rays .",
    "the spectral index distribution of the system at a certain frequency band mainly depends on the ratio @xmath66 between diffusion distance @xmath67 and the nebular size @xmath9 . at a certain frequency , the same @xmath68 gives roughly the same spectral index distribution .",
    "the @xmath69 index of the injected particles would also affect the spectral index profile to some extent .",
    "since we have good observational data for the spectral index of the pwne considered here , its value can be directly determined from the observations . if the frequency band is in the steady state regime ,",
    "then @xmath70 , and we find @xmath71 . since the nebular size is usually known , the spectral index distribution is determined by @xmath72 in a particular frequency band .",
    "the diffusion coefficient @xmath21 and magnetic field @xmath8 are coupled together in the spectral index fitting ; in order to get an accurate diffusion coefficient @xmath21 , we need to know the magnetic field @xmath8 of the system . one way to estimate @xmath8 is based on the synchrotron break frequency in the integrated spectrum ( equation [ [ critv ] ] ) . however , the break is not a sharp feature and it is difficult to locate the synchrotron break frequency of the crab and 3c 58 based on current observational data @xcite .",
    "another way is to model the high energy inverse compton emission .",
    "the magnetic field obtained by using inverse compton fitting is slightly different from the magnetic field defined in our pure diffusion model , because in our model we solve for the constant @xmath8 situation which means the magnetic field @xmath8 is an average @xmath8 of the pwn over its lifetime",
    ". our average magnetic field should be slightly larger than the magnetic field indicated by inverse compton modeling .",
    "the minimum energy method for synchrotron emission also gives an estimate for @xmath8 , but it depends on an uncertain assumption . if the frequency band is in the non - steady state regime , @xmath68 , where @xmath32 is now the age of the nebula .",
    "the diffusion coefficient @xmath21 and magnetic field @xmath8 are now decoupled and @xmath73 . however , in this regime the particles do not suffer synchrotron losses , so their spectrum is not changed from the injection spectrum and they do not give useful information about the diffusion coefficient .",
    "next we consider how the spectral index profile varies as a function of the ratio @xmath66 . as we are mainly interested in the steady state case",
    ", we now consider the critical frequency @xmath74 corresponding to the case @xmath75 .",
    "it is the same as @xmath76 defined in @xcite : @xmath77 we assume a pwn in steady state with @xmath78 , and scale to a nebular size @xmath79 pc , magnetic field @xmath80",
    "@xmath81 g and diffusion coefficient @xmath82 @xmath17 s@xmath18 . we calculate the spectral index distribution for the three cases : @xmath83 , and @xmath84 ( figure [ 3c_58_vary_freq ] ) . when @xmath85 , which corresponds to @xmath86 , the photon index profile is flat . at high frequency",
    "the photon index profile first changes into a power law when @xmath87 , and then into an exponential when @xmath88 . when the diffusion distance @xmath89 @xmath9 , the diffusing particles within the nebula are well mixed so the spectral index profile tends to be flat .",
    "when the diffusion distance @xmath90 , the particle density drops quickly along the radial direction because of the short cooling time , so the spectral index shows steepening in the radial direction .",
    "a calculation of the spectral index distribution in the kc model shows that it has a problem in explaining the observed spectral index profile ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "we take the crab as an example and use the kc model to calculate the spectral index distribution of the crab at optical wavelengths , where the kc model is still applicable .",
    "we use the best fit parameters given by @xcite to do the calculation and assume that there is no synchrotron emission within the termination shock . in order to give a good comparison ,",
    "we use the same emissivity as used in @xcite , which is slighty different from our value .",
    "we add a pre - defined radius @xmath9 which is 20 times of the termination shock radius in the simulation ; there is no emission beyond this point .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ kc_model ] . the spectral index profile in figure [ kc_model ]",
    "does not fit the optical data shown in @xcite . in the observations ,",
    "the spectral index profile is approximately a power law distribution , while the results given by the kc model are flat within a certain radius and then increase very quickly beyond that radius .",
    "the power law like spectral index distributions are also seen at x - ray wavelengths in 3c 58 @xcite and g21.50.9 @xcite which indicates that diffusion processes could be generally important in young pwne @xcite .",
    "@xcite show that a 2d mhd simulation could reproduce most of the toroidal and jet like structure near the termination shock , but the spectral index properties of the crab nebula suggest diffusion processes on larger scales .    the nebular size of a pwn is also determined by @xmath74 or @xmath66 .",
    "when @xmath91 , @xmath92 in the steady state case , the nebular size remains the same due to the boundary condition .",
    "when @xmath93 , @xmath94 , the size tends to shrink as the cooling time of particles is smaller than the diffusion time . in the @xmath93 , @xmath94 regime , the nebular size for the pure diffusion model",
    "can be estimated by setting @xmath95 , which yields @xmath96 .",
    "we first use parameters known from observations such as age @xmath32 , nebular size @xmath9 and magnetic field @xmath8 to fit the spectral index distribution of the crab , 3c 58 and g21.50.9 . fitting a model yields the diffusion coefficient @xmath21 and @xmath69 of the pwne .",
    "we then discuss the nebular size behavior . for the crab we use a magnetic field",
    "@xmath97 @xmath81 g .",
    "this is slightly larger than the value , @xmath98 @xmath81 g , found by @xcite and @xcite from inverse compton emission , which gives the current value of the field .",
    "our value gives a sufficiently high diffusion coefficient @xmath21 to explain the size of the crab .",
    "radio data for the crab show @xmath99 .",
    "the spectral index distribution from radio ( 5 ghz ) to optical @xmath100 hz frequencies is shown in figure [ crab ] . by comparing our results with the major axis data in @xcite",
    "we find that @xmath101 @xmath17 s@xmath18 gives a good fit to the data .",
    "since we do not know exactly the optical frequency used in @xcite , we did not do a least squares fit .",
    "we then used the diffusion coefficient @xmath101 @xmath17 s@xmath18 to calculate the spectral index distribution for infrared ( @xmath102 @xmath81 m ) and optical ( @xmath103  ) wavelengths , which are shown in figures [ crabfig ] . in the infrared ( ir ) , fitting the spectral index variation from 0.3 to 0.8 within the crab nebula found by @xcite requires the nebular radius to be @xmath104 .",
    "our simulation indicates that in the ir the nebular size of the crab has decreased due to synchrotron losses , which is consistent with figure 3 of @xcite .",
    "the spectral index variation from 0.6 to 1.1 within the crab nebula at optical wavelengths @xcite implies the nebular size of the crab is @xmath105 , which is consistent with the results in figure 2 of @xcite . comparing our simulation results in figures",
    "[ crab ] and [ crabfig ] with the data in @xcite and @xcite shows that our spectral index in the central region is lower than the observed value if the optical band is involved .",
    "we attribute the discrepancy to an intrinsic break in the injected particle spectrum , which is discussed below .",
    "the main uncertainty in the model comes from the magnetic field @xmath8 , although other factors , such as non - spherical symmetry and boundary conditions , also have some effect .",
    "we used the same formalism to fit the x - ray photon index profiles of 3c 58 and g21.50.9 . according to equation ( [ critv ] ) ,",
    "the x - ray emitting particles of both 3c 58 and g21.50.9 have reached a steady state if they are young pwne , so their age information is not required for photon index fitting and we can use the steady state solution to calculate the photon index distribution .",
    "the parameters we used for 3c 58 and g21.50.9 are listed in table [ params ] .",

    "the length for the crab is about a factor 10 smaller than the scale indicated by optical polarization ( section 2 ) , and the length for 3c 58 is about a factor of 10 smaller than the scale of apparent magnetic loops seen in the x - ray image @xcite . the actual longer diffusion time",

    "<S> most of our models use an energy independent diffusion coefficient ; power law variations of the coefficient with energy are degenerate with variation in the input particle energy distribution index in the steady state , transmitting boundary case . energy dependent diffusion is a possible reason for the smaller diffusion coefficient inferred for the crab . </S>",
    "<S> monte carlo simulations of the particle transport allowing for advection and diffusion of particles suggest that diffusion dominates over much of the total nebular volume of the crab . </S>",
    "<S> advection dominates close to the pulsar and is likely to play a role in the x - ray half - light radius . </S>",
    "<S> the source of diffusion and mixing of particles is uncertain , but may be related to the rayleigh - taylor instability at the outer boundary of a young pwn or to instabilities in the toroidal magnetic field structure . </S>"
