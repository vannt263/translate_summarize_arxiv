    "nuclear matter is an idealized system of nucleons interacting without coulomb forces which is translationally invariant with a fixed ratio of neutrons to protons .",
    "the goal of nuclear matter theory is to obtain an equation of state ( eos ) for nuclear matter starting from the underlying two - body nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) interaction .",
    "the nuclear eos , which is the energy per nucleon e / a = @xmath0 of nuclear matter as a function of nucleonic density @xmath1 , can then be used to obtain the bulk properties of nuclear matter such as the nuclear incompressibility , the energy density , the pressure , the velocity of sound in nuclear medium etc .",
    "the eos is also of fundamental importance in the theories of nucleus - nucleus collisions at energies where the nuclear incompressibility @xmath2 comes into play as well as in the theories of neutron stars and supernova explosions @xcite and a widely used experimental method is the determination of the incompressibility from the observed giant monopole resonances ( gmr ) @xcite . in the present work we obtain an eos for nuclear matter using the m3y - reid - elliott effective interaction supplemented by a zero range pseudo - potential representing the single - nucleon exchange term along with the density dependence which takes care of the higher order exchange effects and the pauli blocking effects .",
    "the density dependence parameters of the interaction are obtained by reproducing the saturation energy per nucleon and the saturation density of spin and isospin symmetric cold infinite nuclear matter .",
    "one of the density dependence parameter is also utilized to provide estimate for the nuclear mean free path .",
    "the eos , thus obtained , then used to calculate the pressure , the energy density , the nuclear incompressibility and the velocity of sound in nuclear matter .",
    "the m3y interaction , which was derived by fitting its matrix elements in an oscillator basis to those elements of the g - matrix obtained with the reid - elliott soft - core nn interaction , has a profound physical basis .",
    "the ranges of the m3y forces were chosen to ensure a long - range tail of the one - pion exchange potential as well as a short range repulsive part simulating the exchange of heavier mesons @xcite .",
    "the real part of the nuclear interaction potential obtained by folding in the density distribution functions of two interacting nuclei with the density dependent m3y effective interaction supplemented by a zero - range pseudo - potential ( ddm3y ) was shown to provide good descriptions for medium and high energy @xmath3 and heavy ion elastic scatterings @xcite .",
    "the zero - range pseudo - potential represented the single - nucleon exchange term while the density dependence accounted for the higher order exchange effects and the pauli blocking effects . since the density dependence of the effective projectile - nucleon interaction was found to be fairly independent of the projectile @xcite , as long as the projectile - nucleus interaction was amenable to a single - folding prescription , the density dependent effects on the nucleon - nucleon interaction were factorized into a target term times a projectile term and used successfully in case of nuclear scattering @xcite and cluster radioactivity @xcite .",
    "present work uses the same effective interaction within single folding model description to obtain nuclear eos and provide unified descriptions of nuclear scattering , cluster radioactivity and nuclear matter .",
    "the general expression for the density dependent effective nn interaction potential @xmath4 is written as @xcite    @xmath5    where the realistic effective m3y interaction potential @xcite supplemented by a zero range pseudopotential @xmath6 is given by    @xmath7    where the zero - range pseudo - potential @xmath8 representing the single - nucleon exchange term is given by @xcite    @xmath9    and the density dependent part @xcite has been taken to be of a general form    @xmath10    which takes care of the higher order exchange effects and the pauli blocking effects .",
    "this density dependence changes sign at high densities which is of crucial importance in fulfilling the saturation condition as well as giving different @xmath11 values with different values of @xmath12 for the nuclear eos .",
    "the value of the parameter @xmath13 was originally taken by myers in the single folding calculation @xcite .",
    "in fact @xmath13 also has a physical meaning because then @xmath14 can be interpreted as an in medium effective nucleon - nucleon interaction cross - section @xmath15 while the density dependent term represents interaction probability .",
    "this value of @xmath14 along with nucleonic density of infinite nuclear matter @xmath16 can also provide the nuclear mean free path @xmath17 .",
    "moreover , it also worked well in the double folding calculations with the factorized density dependence for the high energy heavy ion scattering @xcite and the cluster radioactivity @xcite .",
    "the two parameters of eqn.(4 ) , c and @xmath14 , have been fitted to reproduce the saturation conditions .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention here that due to attractive character of the m3y forces the saturation condition for cold nuclear matter is not fulfilled .",
    "however , the realistic description of nuclear matter properties can be obtained with this density dependent m3y effective interaction .",
    "therefore , the density dependence parameters have been obtained by reproducing the saturation energy per nucleon and the saturation nucleonic density of the spin and isospin symmetric cold infinite nuclear matter .",
    "the energy per nucleon @xmath0 obtained using the effective nucleon - nucleon interaction @xmath4 for the spin and isospin symmetric cold infinite nuclear matter is given by    @xmath18 + g(\\rho , \\epsilon)\\rho j_v / 2 \\label{seqn5}\\ ] ]    where m is the nucleonic mass equal to 938.91897 @xmath19 , @xmath20 given by @xmath21 is the fermi momentum , @xmath1 is the nucleonic density while @xmath22 being the saturation density for the spin and isospin symmetric cold infinite nuclear matter and @xmath23 represents the volume integral of the m3y interaction supplemented by the zero - range pseudopotential having the form    @xmath24    the eqn.(5 ) can be rewritten with the help of eqn.(4 ) as    @xmath18 + [ \\rho j_v c ( 1 - \\beta\\rho^n)/2 ]    \\label{seqn8}\\ ] ]    and differentiated with respect to @xmath1 to yield equation    @xmath25 + j_v c [ 1 - ( n+1)\\beta\\rho^n ] /2",
    "\\label{seqn9}\\ ] ]    the equilibrium density of the nuclear matter is determined from the saturation condition @xmath26 .",
    "then eqn.(8 ) and eqn.(9 ) with the saturation condition can be solved simultaneously for fixed values of the saturation energy per nucleon @xmath27 and the saturation density @xmath22 of the spin and isospin symmetric cold infinite nuclear matter , henceforth will be called the standard nuclear matter , to obtain the values of the density dependence parameters @xmath14 and c. density dependence parameters @xmath14 and c , thus obtained , can be given by    @xmath28/[(3n+1)-(n+1)p ] , \\label{seqn10}\\ ] ]    @xmath29/[\\hbar^2k_{f_0}^2 ] , \\label{seqn11}\\ ] ]    @xmath30^{1/3 } , \\label{seqn12}\\ ] ]    @xmath31 / [ 5mj_v\\rho_0(1 - ( n+1)\\beta\\rho_0^n ) ] , \\label{seqn13}\\ ] ]    respectively .",
    "it is quite obvious that the density dependence parameter @xmath14 obtained by this method depends only on the saturation energy per nucleon @xmath27 , the saturation density @xmath22 and the index @xmath12 of the density dependent part but not on the parameters of the m3y interaction while the other density dependence parameter c depends on the parameters of the m3y interaction also through the volume integral @xmath23 .",
    "the energy per nucleon can be rewritten as    @xmath18 - ( \\rho/\\rho_{0 } ) [ \\hbar^2k_{f_0}^2 ( 1 - \\beta\\rho^n)]/[5m(1 - ( n+1)\\beta\\rho_{0}^n ) ] \\label{seqn14}\\ ] ]    the pressure @xmath32 and the energy density @xmath33 of nuclear matter can be given by    @xmath34 + \\rho^2 j_v c [ 1 - ( n+1 ) \\beta\\rho^n]/2 , \\label{seqn15}\\ ] ]    @xmath35 ,   \\label{seqn16}\\ ] ]    respectively , and thus the velocity of sound @xmath36 in standard nuclear matter is given by    @xmath37/[\\epsilon + m c^2 + \\rho \\partial\\epsilon/\\partial\\rho ] } \\label{seqn17}\\ ] ]    the incompressibility @xmath11 of the spin and isospin symmetric cold infinite nuclear matter which is defined as    @xmath38    can be theoretically obtained using eqn.(18 ) , eqn.(6 ) and eqn.(9 ) as    @xmath39 \\label{seqn19}\\ ] ]    since the product @xmath40 appears in the above equation , a cursory glance reveals that the incompressibility @xmath11 depends only upon the saturation energy per nucleon @xmath27 , the saturation density @xmath22 and the index @xmath12 of the density dependent part of the interaction but not on the parameters of the m3y interaction .",
    "the calculations have been performed using the values of the saturation density @xmath41 and the saturation energy per nucleon @xmath42 for the standard nuclear matter . for a fixed value of @xmath14 ,",
    "the parameters @xmath3 and c can have any possible simultaneous values as determined from nuclear matter . using the usual value of @xmath43 for the parameter of energy dependence of the zero range pseudo - potential , the values obtained for the density dependence parameters c and @xmath14 have been presented in table-1 for different values of the parameter @xmath12 along with the corresponding values of the incompressibility @xmath11 .",
    "smaller @xmath12 values predict softer eos while higher values predict stiffer eos .",
    "the form of @xmath44 with @xmath13 for the density dependence which is identical to that used for explaining the scattering and the @xmath3 , cluster radioactivity phenomena @xcite also agrees well with recent theoretical @xcite and experimental @xcite results for the nuclear incompressibility .",
    ".compression modulus at different parameter values of n [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in fig.-1 plots of the theoretical estimates of the velocity of sound and the energy per nucleon @xmath0 of the standard nuclear matter have been shown as a function of the normalized nuclear density @xmath45 using @xmath13 .",

    "the theoretical estimate of @xmath11 from the refractive @xmath3-nucleus scattering is about 240 mev-270 mev @xcite and that by infinite nuclear matter model ( inm ) @xcite claims a well defined and stable value of @xmath50 mev and present theoretical estimate is in reasonably close agreement with the value obtained by inm which rules out any values lower than 200 mev . using the value of the density dependence parameter @xmath51 corresponding to the standard value of the parameter @xmath13 along with the nucleonic density of @xmath52 , the value obtained for the nuclear mean free path @xmath53 is about @xmath54 which is in excellent agreement @xcite with other theoretical estimates .",

    "in summary , we conclude that the present eos which is obtained using the m3y effective nn interaction , which was derived by fitting its matrix elements in an oscillator basis to those elements of the g - matrix obtained with the reid - elliot soft - core nn interaction , has a profound theoretical standing .",

    "this value is also in excellent agreement with the experimental estimates from gmr @xcite as well as determination based upon the production of hard photons in heavy ion collisions @xcite .",
    "thus , a unified description for nuclear scattering , radioactivity and eos for standard nuclear matter has been achieved using a realistic effective interaction along with a physical density dependence ."
