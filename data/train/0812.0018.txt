    "our understanding of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) has improved enormously in the last 15 years , thanks to observations by dedicated @xmath6-ray / x - ray satellites such as compton - gro , bepposax , hete-2 and swift , and follow - up observations from the ground in optical and radio ( for recent reviews see mszros , 2002 ; piran 2005 ; woosley & bloom , 2006 ; fox & mszros , 2006 ; zhang , 2007 ) . as a result of this work",
    ", it is now established that at least some long - duration bursts are produced in the collapse of a massive star ( as suggested by woosley 1993 ; paczynski 1998 ) , accompanied by the ejection of a highly relativistic jet .",
    "afterglow observations as well as energy considerations indicate that the jet is well collimated ( rhoads 1999 , frail et al .",
    "2001 , panaitescu & kumar , 2001 ) .",
    "the presence of a relativistic jet has also been directly confirmed in the nearby burst grb 030329 which exhibited `` superluminal '' motion in its radio afterglow ( taylor et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "grb lightcurves are known to be highly variable ( meegan et al . 1992 ) , and this has led to the development of the _ internal shock model _ ( piran , shemi & narayan 1993 ; rees & meszaros 1994 ; katz 1994 ) . according to this model , the lorentz factor of the jet varies with time , and as a result , faster portions of the jet catch up with slower portions . in the ensuing collision",
    ", a fraction of the kinetic energy of the jet is converted to thermal energy .",
    "the observed radiation is then produced via synchrotron and inverse - compton processes .    in a seminal paper , sari and piran ( 1997 ) provided a general argument why grb lightcurve variability can not be explained by simply appealing to a highly inhomogeneous source .",
    "they showed that the efficiency for converting jet energy to the observed radiation is extremely poor when variability arises purely from inhomogeneity ; the essence of their argument is summarized in  2 .",
    "the argument is both powerful and compelling , and it has led to wide acceptance of the internal shock model .",
    "a basic feature of the model is that different pulses within the lightcurve of a grb are produced in distinct internal collisions / shocks , generally at different distances from the central explosion .",
    "there are , however , a number of observations and/or theoretical considerations that pose difficulties for the internal shock model .",
    "internal shocks have only a modest efficiency @xmath710% for converting jet energy to the radiation observed in the @xmath8kev1mev band ( kumar , 1999 ; panaitescu , spada & meszaros , 1999 ; lazzati et al",
    ". 1999)% . however , their estimates were based purely on the kinematics of colliding shells , where shells of lorentz factor @xmath9 collided with high @xmath6 shells .",
    "they did not take into consideration the efficiency of the emergent radiation in the commonly observed 20kev1mev band . ] .",
    "even a @xmath1010% radiative efficiency is low compared to the burst efficiency implied by measurements of the jet kinetic energy through modeling grb afterglow lightcurves ( panaitescu & kumar , 2002 ) .",
    "another difficulty with the internal shock model is the large distance from the central explosion that one estimates ( @xmath11 cm ) for the @xmath6-ray - producing region in a number of grbs ( kumar et al .",
    "this distance is significantly larger than what one expects in the internal shock model .",
    "moreover , the estimated distance is within a factor of a few of the deceleration radius where the jet begins to interact with the external medium .",
    "this coincidence between two unrelated radii is unexpected .    these difficulties , along with the problem of avoiding excessive baryon loading , motivate us to consider an alternative to the internal shock model .",
    "we show in  3 that the argument of sari & piran ( 1997 ) against an inhomogeneous source can be successfully overcome if we consider source inhomogeneities that move with _ relativistic velocities_. in  4 , we calculate a model lightcurve using this relativistic model and demonstrate that it is consistent with observations of grbs .",
    "we conclude in  5 with a discussion .",
    "we consider an idealized model of a grb in which a spherical shell , located at radius @xmath1 with respect to the center of the explosion , expands ultra - relativistically outward with a bulk lorentz factor @xmath3 .",
    "we define a second length scale , @xmath12 for simplicity , we ignore cosmological redshift . in the frame of an external observer , the time since the explosion is @xmath13 , while in the comoving frame of the expanding shell , the time is @xmath14 .",
    "the causal horizon around any point in the fluid is thus a sphere of radius @xmath15 .",
    "we assume causal contact in the radial direction .",
    "the radial width of the shell in the fluid frame is then @xmath15 , and the radial width in the observer frame is @xmath16",
    ".    the radiation from any fluid element in the shell will be isotropic in the fluid frame , but beamed within a cone of half - angle @xmath17 in the observer frame .",
    "for a given distant observer , most of the received radiation comes from a circular patch of transverse radius @xmath18 on the shell , i.e. , from a single causal volume in the radiating fluid .",
    "consider the radiation emitted from the outer surface of the shell .",
    "as seen by the observer , the time delay between the radiation received from the center of the visible patch and that from the edge of the patch is @xmath19 ( we ignore factors of order unity in this paper ) .",
    "assuming the shell is homogeneous , this is the shortest time scale over which the observed signal can vary .",
    "since the radial width of the shell in the observer frame is @xmath20 , the smoothing time due to the finite radial width of the source is also of the same order .",
    "thus , in this model of a grb , which we refer to as the _ standard model _ , the variability time scale is given by @xmath21    it is natural to associate the time scale @xmath22 with the duration of individual pulses ( spikes ) in the @xmath6-ray lightcurve .",
    "however , for a typical long grb , the total burst duration @xmath23 is several tens of times , and sometimes even a couple of hundred times , longer than @xmath22 . to explain the longer time scale @xmath24 , the standard model invokes a long - lived central engine with significant power output over a time @xmath25",
    "furthermore , the engine is postulated to be highly variable and to eject a large number of successive shells with different lorentz factors .",
    "these shells collide with one another in internal shocks , each shock producing a pulse in the lightcurve of duration @xmath26 .    instead of having multiple shells and internal shocks ,",
    "could the burst variability be explained via inhomogeneity in the radiating fluid ?",
    "for instance , could @xmath24 be equal to @xmath27 and could the observed rapid variations in the lightcurve be the result of bursts of radiation from tiny active blobs within the radiating fluid ?",
    "sari & piran ( 1997 ) gave the following simple and powerful argument against this possibility .",
    "let us define the variability parameter @xmath28 ; a typical value is @xmath29 . for most bursts ,",
    "@xmath30 is roughly equal to the number of pulses in the lightcurve , i.e. , the pulses fill the lightcurve with a duty cycle of order unity .",
    "if we wish to set @xmath24 equal to @xmath31 , then a blob that produces any single pulse in the lightcurve must have a radial extent no larger than @xmath32 .",
    "assuming that the blobs are roughly spherical in shape ( in the comoving frame of the fluid ) , this means that there must be @xmath33 independent blobs within a causal volume ( @xmath34 ) of the fluid .",
    "however , the number of pulses observed in the grb lightcurve is no more than @xmath30 .",
    "also , each pulse must be produced on average by only one blob since the intensity varies by order unity across a pulse .",
    "we thus conclude that , out of @xmath35 blobs , only @xmath30 blobs radiate out of a total of @xmath36 blobs radiate , or that the radiative efficiency is @xmath37 . ] .",
    "that is , only one out of every @xmath38 blobs radiates , and @xmath39 of the fluid is silent .",
    "it is highly unlikely that the grb energy is localized inside just @xmath40 of the volume of the fluid in the shell .",
    "it is more likely that the energy from the explosion is spread uniformly over the entire shell .",
    "but if this is the case , then the prompt grb emission must be highly inefficient , with only @xmath40 of the available energy being radiated during the grb .",
    "such extreme inefficiency is unpalatable .",
    "for instance , after correcting for beaming , the energy release in gamma - rays in a typical long - duration grb is found to be of order 10@xmath41erg ( frail et al .",
    "2001 ) . with an inhomogeneous model",
    "in which the efficiency is only @xmath42 , the true energy release would be @xmath43  erg , which is larger by a factor @xmath44 than the kinetic energy of relativistic ejecta in grbs as determined from multiwavelength modeling of their afterglow lightcurves ( wijers & galama , 1999 ; panaitescu & kumar , 2002 ) .",
    "we are thus compelled to give up the idea of variability arising from inhomogeneity , and forced to accept the standard internal shock model . according to this model , the burst duration @xmath24 is equal to the lifetime of the central engine , variability is produced by a large number of random internal shocks among independent shells ejected from the engine , and the variability time @xmath22 is given by equation ( [ eqstd ] ) .",
    "we now describe an alternative model  the _ turbulent model _  in which we assume that the fluid in the grb shell is relativistically turbulent . in the shell frame , let the typical lorentz factor of an energy - bearing eddy be @xmath0 . as mentioned earlier",
    ", the lifetime of the system in the shell frame is @xmath14 . in the frame of an eddy",
    ", this corresponds to a lifetime @xmath45 .",
    "therefore , by causality , we expect the maximum size of an eddy in its own frame to be @xmath46 .",
    "let us make the reasonable assumption that the energy - bearing eddies have roughly this size .",
    "thus , the size of an eddy in its own frame is @xmath47 each eddy has a volume @xmath48 , so we expect the total number of eddies in a causal volume of the shell to be @xmath49 in the shell frame , an eddy has a size @xmath50 in a plane perpendicular to its velocity vector , and a lorentz - contracted size @xmath51 parallel to its motion .",
    "eddies are not likely to travel along perfectly straight lines .",
    "rather , we expect their velocities to change on approximately the causal time , which is @xmath14 in the shell frame .",
    "we also expect eddies to dissolve and reform on this time scale . however , since @xmath52 is roughly the lifetime of the system we do not expect multiple generations of eddies .",
    "consider now the radiation from an eddy as viewed in the shell frame . at any instant ,",
    "the radiation is beamed into a cone of half - angle @xmath53 . during the life of the eddy , the orientation of the beam wanders by a few radians as a result of turbulent acceleration .",
    "thus each eddy illuminates a total solid angle @xmath54 in the shell frame in the course of its motion .",
    "boosting to the observer frame , the illuminated solid angle from each eddy is @xmath55 .",
    "summing over all @xmath56 eddies in a causal volume , the total solid angle illuminated by all the eddies is @xmath57 .",
    "all of this radiation is beamed within a solid angle @xmath58 .",
    "therefore , each observer receives radiation from @xmath59 eddies .",
    "an observer receives radiation from the entire collection of eddies ( inside one causal volume ) over a time @xmath60 . in a major departure from the standard model ,",
    "let us associate this time with the burst duration @xmath24 .",
    "the radiation received from a single eddy then corresponds to an individual pulse in the grb lightcurve . to estimate the duration of a pulse",
    ", we note that the thickness of an eddy in a direction parallel to its beamed radiation is @xmath61 in the shell frame , or @xmath62 in the observer frame .",
    "thus , an observer receives radiation from a single eddy within a time @xmath63 . as we showed above",
    ", an observer receives on average @xmath5 pulses .",
    "thus , in the turbulent model , we have the following results : @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the mean number of pulses in the burst .",
    "equations ( [ tburst])([npulse ] ) show that @xmath66 .",
    "this has two implications .",
    "first , it means that pulses typically fill the entire duration of the burst , i.e. , the duty cycle of the pulses is of order unity , as observed in grbs .",
    "second , an observer receives radiation on average from only one eddy at any given time .",
    "thus , we expect order unity variations in the observed @xmath6-ray flux , again consistent with observations .",
    "these features are illustrated in the sample lightcurve shown in fig .",
    "1 .     and the turbulent lorentz factor of the eddies to be @xmath67 .",
    "time is scaled by the burst duration as defined in eq .",
    "( [ tburst ] ) .",
    "note the high degree of variability during the main burst ( @xmath68 ) , and the rapid decrease of the flux at late times due to off - axis emission.,width=624 ]    figure 1 was computed by considering a grb shell expanding outward with a large lorentz factor @xmath69 ( the precise value is unimportant ) .",
    "the shell is randomly filled with a population of eddies with turbulent lorentz factor @xmath67 .",
    "it is assumed that there are @xmath70 eddies per volume @xmath71 in the frame of the shell and that there is a probability @xmath53 that the relativistically boosted beam of any given eddy will sweep past the observer during the eddy lifetime .",
    "the spectral index of the radiation is taken to be @xmath72 and the observed flux in a fixed energy band is computed using standard relativistic transformations .",
    "the resulting lightcurve depends to some extent on the precise assumptions we make",
    ". however , the model assumptions described above are reasonable . as fig .",
    "1 shows , this model gives a large number ( @xmath5 ) of pulses during the main burst ( eq .",
    "[ tburst ] ) .",
    "the burst duration is probably closer to @xmath73 . ] , with a duty cycle not very different from unity .",
    "the rapidly declining late - time flux is the result of off - axis emission .",
    "note that this emission continues to show some residual variability .",
    "this feature of the model may be worth verifying through observations .",
    "however , given the rapid decline in the flux and the limited sensitivity of detectors , one is generally forced to time - average the late - time data and this will cause the variability to be washed out .",
    "the turbulent model described in this paper has several attractive features .",
    "\\(ii ) according to equation ( [ tburst ] ) , the quantity @xmath31 is equal to @xmath24 rather than @xmath26 ( eq . [ eqstd ] ) .",
    "relative to the standard model , the turbulent model can thus accommodate much larger values of @xmath1 and smaller values of @xmath3 .",
    "this eliminates a problematic constraint which leads to difficulties when attempting to fit grb observations using equation ( [ eqstd ] ) from the standard model ( e.g. , kumar & narayan 2008 ) .",
    "\\(iii ) the larger value of @xmath1 obtained with the turbulent model is compatible with ideas described in lyutikov & blandford ( 2003 ) , according to which the jet energy is primarily in the form of poynting flux .",
    "this energy is converted to radiation through plasma instabilities near the deceleration radius ( @xmath74 cm ) .",
    "the same instabilities may also produce the relativistic turbulence invoked in our model .",
    "\\(iv ) the turbulent model neatly avoids the efficiency argument of sari & piran ( 1997 ) .",
    "any particular observer receives radiation from only a fraction @xmath75 of the available eddies . however , the additional relativistic boost of the received radiation because of turbulent motion makes up for the missing eddies .",
    "thus , each observer receives a fair share of the emission from the shell , and there is no radiative inefficiency in the model .      for simplicity ,",
    "we have assumed in this paper that the eddy motions are isotropic in the frame of the grb shell .",
    "this is , however , not essential .",
    "we could , for instance , have random relativistic motions which are concentrated primarily in a plane perpendicular to the radius vector of the shell , e.g. , parallel to the local tangential magnetic field .",
    "such a model would give qualitatively similar results , though some of the scalings may be a little different .",
    "also , we have simplified matters by assuming that all eddies have the same lorentz factor , which is unlikely in a real turbulent medium .",
    "in fact , a likely scenario is that a part of the fluid moves relativistically with a range of lorentz factors , and a part resides in a ( more - or - less ) stationary inter - eddy medium which is produced when eddies collide with one another in shocks .",
    "this would slightly modify the radiative properties of the medium ( kumar & narayan 2008 ) , but it will not change the key features of the model as described in the present paper . finally , the relevant energy - bearing eddies may not be as large as their comoving causality size but may be smaller by a numerical factor , and the solid angle swept by an eddy in the shell frame may be different from @xmath75 ( for instance , eddies might be hardly accelerated at all once they are formed ) .",
    "these effects will modify equations ( [ tburst ] ) , ( [ tvar ] ) and ( [ npulse ] ) .",
    "however , the results will remain qualitatively the same ."
