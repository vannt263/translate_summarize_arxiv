    "neutron star high - mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ) , i.e. , neutron stars accreting from an early - type stellar companion , typically show very high levels of variability in their x - ray emission . as the unabsorbed flux is directly related to the mass accretion rate",
    ", we can understand these changes as originating from variations of the latter .",
    "the physical conditions inside the accretion column , where most of the x - rays are produced , change with accretion rate . by sampling different luminosity levels",
    "we can obtain constraints on the geometry and physical processes in the accretion column .",
    "in particular , be - star systems , where the stellar companion has a large circumstellar disk ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , are ideally suited for studying the luminosity dependence of the x - ray spectrum , as they show weeks- to months - long outbursts which can cover more than two orders of magnitude in luminosity .",
    "many accreting neutron stars show prominent cyclotron resonant scattering features ( crsfs ) .",
    "crsfs are produced by resonant scattering of photons off electrons moving perpendicular to the magnetic field .",
    "the electrons are quantized on landau levels which energies depend directly on the local magnetic field , and therefore make the observed energy of the crsf a direct tracer of the b - field ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) . with a variable accretion rate the cyclotron line production region can move along the accretion column , sampling different magnetic fields .",
    "a precise measurement of the crsf therefore probes the accretion geometry of a source .    according to theoretical calculations , a strongly asymmetric shape of the fundamental line",
    "is predicted , with significant emission wings .",

    "the shape is thereby strongly dependent on the accretion geometry and the underlying x - ray continuum .",
    "the asymmetry originates from photon - spawning , where electrons excited to higher harmonic landau levels cascading back to the ground state and emitting photons close to the fundamental line energy @xcite .",
    "observationally , however , only very few of the approximately 25 known crsf sources show any evidence for a deviation from very simply - shaped fundamental lines . in gx  301@xmath22 ,",

    "the line energies are about 2kev lower , consistent with the expected difference between the models ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "our model is therefore insensitive to the slight differences in shape between the two profiles , similar to results obtained for her  x-1 @xcite and v0332 + 35 @xcite .",
    "the crsf energy shows small but statistically significant variations with luminosity , decreasing from @xmath77kev in the first observation to @xmath78kev in the second observation .",
    "this behavior is qualitatively the same with or without the second absorption feature . in order to rule out the possibility that small changes in the continuum parameters influence the measured energy of the crsf",
    ", we performed a simultaneous fit of both datasets .",
    "this was possible as the continuum parameters ( besides the normalization ) do not change significantly between the two observations . in the simultaneous fit , the photon index @xmath79 , the folding energy @xmath80 , the cutoff energy @xmath81 , the absorption column @xmath82 , and the @xmath10line parameters are tied between both datasets .",
    "we obtain very similar results with respect to the two absorption features and the black body component , in particular the luminosity dependence of the crsf energy is seen with the same significance and both observations require a second absorption feature .    in order to further investigate the choice of the continuum on the shape and energy of the crsf , we also model the data with an npex model @xcite , in which we fix the secondary power - law index to @xmath83 .",
    "we obtain a very similar statistical quality of fit and consistent parameters . the energy of the line is fitted to @xmath84kev and @xmath85kev .",
    "the secondary absorption feature is also clearly visible in the residuals and its addition leads to a similar improvement in terms of @xmath86 .",
    "we have presented simultaneous _ swift_and _",
    "nustar_observations at two different luminosities taken during an outburst of cep  x-4 in june and july 2014 .",
    "we describe the broad - band spectrum with a power - law attenuated by absorption and a fermi - dirac cutoff . we find that the continuum does not change significantly between the observations but that the crsf shows complex behavior .",
    "we have shown that to accurately describe the hard x - ray spectrum of cep  x-4we require a second absorption feature in addition to the prominent crsf around 30kev .",
    "if this feature were the fundamental line , it would imply a lower magnetic field strength than previously suggested .",
    "that is , however , unlikely as we expect the ratio of the fundamental and first harmonic line energy to be close to 2 , while we measure @xmath87 .",
    "other sources also show deviations from the expected factor , however , they are typically much smaller ( @xmath88 , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the deviation we observe is too large to be explained by relativistic effects @xcite .",
    "the second feature is also unlikely to result from sampling different accretion columns or different regions .",
    "if that were the case , the strength of the 30kev line would be difficult to explain as this scenario implies that the line should only be present at some phase intervals . in order to further investigate this we will present results of phase - resolved spectroscopy in a separate paper ( bhalerao et al .",
    ", in prep . ) .",
    "the production of two crsfs of such different energies in different accretion columns would also indicate a strong deviation from a simple dipole magnetic field , which is not expected ( see * ? ? ? * for a discussion of the influence of multipole fields on the crsf ) .",
    "the most likely explanation for the second absorption feature is a deviation of the shape of the crsf from a smooth gaussian or lorentzian profile .",
    "this deviation is highlighted in figure  [ fig : lineshape ] , where we plot the data - to - model ratio using the best - fit model with both lines removed .",
    "we superimpose the ratio between this model and the best - fit model with the secondary feature removed , which implicitly shows a simple symmetric line profile . from this ratio",
    "the data clearly deviate at the red wing",
    ". a similar deviation might be present on the blue side , however , the data quality does not us allow to constrain this . adding a feature there with a similar optical depth does not change the statistical quality of the fit significantly .",
    "prominent emission wings would be the most obvious explanation for deviations from a smooth line .",
    "however , such emission wings typically require a harder spectrum than we observe to spawn enough photons to become significant @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , depending on geometry and optical depth , photon spawning can lead to distorted shapes of the scattering trough without creating measurable emission wings @xcite .",
    "as can be seen in the inset of figure  [ fig : spec ] and in figure  [ fig : lineshape ] , the second absorption feature is located exactly at the energy where the primary crsf starts to produce significant deviations from the continuum spectrum , supporting this interpretation .",
    "thanks to _ nustar _",
    "s energy resolution , we are able to constrain the centroid of the line energy to better than @xmath89kev . this allowed us to measure a significant change between the two observations , which appears to be correlated with luminosity . to highlight that correlation and put it into context , we show the crsf energy as a function of luminosity in figure  [ fig : ecrsf2lx ] for different sources",
    ". the energy decreases with declining flux , leading to a positive correlation between luminosity and crsf energy .",
    "the luminosity of cep  x-4is between ( 16)@xmath0ergs@xmath1 for a distance of 3.8kpc , which is below the theoretical limit for the formation of a shock in the accretion column @xcite .",
    "we therefore expect a constant crsf energy uncorrelated with luminosity , as observed in a0535 + 26 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* but see @xcite for indications of a correlation ) . in recent _",

    "are from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the dotted line indicates the original coulomb stopping luminosity presented by @xcite and the dot - dashed line indicates the updated values for vela  x-1@xcite . ]",
    "@xcite follow the calculations of @xcite but allow for wind - accretion instead of disk - accretion and assume a massive neutron star ( around 2@xmath91 in vela  x-1 ) .",
    "this results in a narrower accretion column than assumed in @xcite , which in turn decreases the luminosity threshold required for shock formation significantly , moving the measured luminosities of vela  x-1partially above it ( see the dot - dashed line in figure  [ fig : ecrsf2lx ] ) .",
    "cep  x-4also crosses this adopted line , although the mass of the neutron star in this system is not known .",
    "additionally , cep  x-4is a be - system , and so we expect that the accreted matter forms a temporary accretion disk around the neutron star , which leads to a different accretion geometry than in purely wind accreting systems ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if the accretion geometry could be constrained , this correlation might indicate that the neutron star in cep  x-4is also massive , with @xmath92 .",
    "_ nustar_has revealed two new interesting features of the crsf in cep  x-4 : a distorted profile and a luminosity dependence of the line s energy .",
    "this makes cep  x-4the first system where a significant deviation from a symmetric line profile has been measured in the phase averaged spectrum and the second system where a positive correlation between crsf energy and luminosity has been found at luminosities below @xmath90ergs@xmath1 .",
    "the latter discovery challenges the current understanding of the accretion column geometry , as the line forming region is expected to be at the neutron star surface and therefore independent of luminosity .",
    "the discovery of a complex line profile on the other hand is a good qualitative confirmation of theoretically predicted line - profiles when taking photon - spawning and magnetic field gradients into account ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . by combining detailed calculations of the line profile with sophisticated light bending calculations",
