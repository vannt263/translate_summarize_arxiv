    "@xcite ) , it seems worthwhile to reexamine inflationary models in light of wmap results , as they may give us further insight into the very early universe .",
    "supergravity inflationary models are particularly important as supersymmetry ( or its local version , supergravity ) is the only known way to avoid the hierachy problem , i.e. the fact that the high energy scale of inflation communicates to other sectors of the theory driving the electroweak scale much above its observed value via radiative corrections .",
    "however , supergravity inflationary models also suffer from a kind of hierarchy problem as supersymmetry is broken by the large cosmological constant during inflation giving all scalars , including the inflaton , a soft mass of the order of the hubble parameter @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the curvature of the inflaton potential , as measured by the @xmath7 slow - roll parameter , becomes too large to allow for a sufficiently long period of inflation to take place - the so - called @xmath7 problem .",
    "recently , it has been shown that this problem can be avoided within the randall - sundrum type ii braneworld scenario @xcite , at least for a class of supergravity models in which the evolution of the inflaton dynamics is controlled by a single power at the point where the observed density fluctuations are produced and the inflationary potential can , therefore , be approximately given by    v ^4  , [ eq : gpot ] where @xmath8 is the reduced planck mass .",
    "in the braneworld context , the friedmann equation acquires an additional term quadratic in the energy density @xcite    h^2 = 8 3 m_p^2  , [ eq : h22 ] where @xmath9 is the brane tension , which relates the four and five - dimensional planck scales through    m_p =  .",

    "the case of chaotic inflation has already been analysed in ref .",
    "@xcite , with the conclusion that the quadratic potential is allowed at two - sigma for any value of the brane tension and the quartic potential is very constrained , particularly in the case where the inflationary energy scale is close to the brane tension . here",

    "we find that although the running of the scalar spectral index is within the bounds determined by wmap for both the quadratic and cubic models and for a wide range of potential parameters , a spectral index running from @xmath4 on large scales to @xmath5 on small scales is not possible in either case as precisely the opposite trend is found .",
    "we first consider the case where the potential is quadratic in the inflaton field , @xmath15 , and we rewrite it as    v= v_0 + 12 m^2 ^2  , [ eq : v2 ] and assume that the first term is dominant .    in supergravity ,",
