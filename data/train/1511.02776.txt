    "we consider the following idealized experiment .",
    "an amount of a reactant gas of species @xmath2 is injected into an initially evacuated chemical reactor . the reactor , which has arbitrary but well defined shape represented by a region @xmath3 in @xmath1-dimensional space , is filled with a chemically inert solid material that is permeable to gas diffusion . for example ,",
    "the reactor may be filled with closely packed small inert particles creating a network of channels in the packing interstitial void through which gas can diffuse .",
    "a solid catalytic material promoting the irreversible reaction @xmath4 , where @xmath2 and @xmath5 are gas species that can diffuse through @xmath3 , is embedded into the packed bed of the reactor at specified places . at",
    "any given time , the mixture of reactant and product gases is allowed to escape the reactor through part of the boundary of @xmath3 designated as the reactor exit , while the outside of @xmath3 is kept at near vacuum . the composition of the gas mixture @xmath6 exiting @xmath3 is analyzed and after @xmath3 is eventually emptied of all gas the molar fraction of @xmath5 in the total gas outflow is measured .",
    "we refer to this fraction by @xmath7 and call it the reaction _ conversion _ , or _",
    "conversion probability_. the main concern of this paper is the theoretical determination of @xmath7 for a variety of systems .",
    "more specifically , our focus in this paper is on the functional dependence of @xmath7 on the reaction rate constant and on the geometric configuration of the system , as will be explained in detail shortly .",
    "the analytical and numerical results described here are based on the general ideas developed in @xcite , which will be summarized later in the paper .",
    "the above description is meant to capture the essential features of the experimental technique known as _ temporal analysis of products _ ( tap ) used for studying primarily heterogeneous catalysis involving gases and complex solid materials .",
    "tap experiments are based on technology invented by j. gleaves @xcite and methodology developed by j. gleaves and g. yablonsky @xcite .",
    "see @xcite and the references @xcite for a detailed explanation of the tap method .    in an illustrative tap experiment",
    ", one considers @xmath8 oxidation in the presence of @xmath9 .",
    "the actual tap reactor has the shape of a small cylinder in which reactant gas is injected at the center of the circular backside and product gases exit at the opposite ( open ) side .",
    "the reactor s inert region is uniformly packed with non - porous small particles of quartz , creating a medium that can be characterized by essentially constant diffusivity .",
    "diffusion is generally assumed to proceed in the knudsen regime , in which the mean free path of the gas molecules is comparable or longer than the length scale of the small network of voids produced by the packing . it is natural to model the motion of gas molecules by mathematical brownian motion ( or wiener process ) as this motion corresponds macroscopically to ordinary fickian diffusion .",
    "the catalytic zones may consist of particles having similar size distribution as in the inert region .",
    "these zones are kept at a constant temperature .",
    "although the precise reaction mechanism resulting in the overall reaction @xmath10 may be complex , one is often justified in representing the kinetic dependence as a simple first order kinetic expression . in this example , the quantity @xmath7 of interest to us is the molar fraction of @xmath11 in the total gas outflow .    below is a summary description of the structure of the paper .    * in section [ alphaprocedure ] we review an effective procedure developed in @xcite and elaborated in @xcite for obtaining conversion @xmath7 under very general conditions , based on solving a time - independent boundary value problem for either laplace s equation in certain cases or , more generally , a feynman - kac operator .",

    "metric graphs_. for these models it is possible to obtain exact analytic solutions for @xmath7 as will be seen in section [ networks ] .",

    "we investigate via numerical experiments some @xmath1-dimensional examples of systems that are similar to tap - configurations ; that is , cylindrical reactors with one or more catalyst pellets .",
    "our main interest is to determine , in the case of a single pellet placed at varying positions and having a variety of simple shapes , how well @xmath7 can be approximated by the general formula given above for a graph model with a single active node ; and to find out how @xmath16 and @xmath15 may depend on position and shape parameters of the catalyst pellet .",

    "it is convenient to formulate the problem in terms of the _ survival function _ @xmath18 , representing the probability that a single gas molecule of type @xmath2 , injected into @xmath3 at the initial position @xmath19 , will eventually leave @xmath3 through the exit boundary @xmath20 without having converted into @xmath5 . the complementary probability is then @xmath21 .",
    "we assume that gas molecules diffuse through the reactor bed @xmath3 under ordinary ( fickian ) diffusion having constant diffusivity , denoted @xmath22 .",
    "this amounts to the assumption that the trajectories of individual gas molecules correspond to sample paths of mathematical brownian motion .    in real tap experiments",
    "active particles may consist of a polycrystalline material forming a complex structure of pores and other features at various length scales .",
    "the reaction takes place on the surface . by expressing @xmath7 in terms of solutions to a boundary value problem as we do below",

    "the interior of each such particle is not regarded as being part of @xmath3 while the particle boundary surface is supposed to have a well defined unit normal vector field .",
    "we call these surfaces active sites of _ type _ ii .",
    "the reaction constant in this case will be denoted by @xmath13 , a quantity having physical dimension @xmath28 $ ] .",
    "the relationship between @xmath13 and @xmath12 will be discussed below .",
    "the former is similar to a damkhler number of type ii , although we avoid this terminology here and simply refer to @xmath13 as the _ surface reaction constant_. 3 .   _ active sites of type iii . _",
    "the active region consists of regular surfaces ( having a well - defined normal vector field ) that are porous to the passage of gas , forming transition boundaries between inert regions .",
    "we also refer to these sites as _ active thin zones_. the reaction constant for this type of active site will be denoted @xmath13 and is equal to the constant for sites of type ii .",

    "@xmath31 is the union of the active surfaces of type ii ; 3 .",
    "@xmath32 is the remaining of the boundary of @xmath3 , where @xmath33 stands for `` reflecting . ''",
    "if the overall reaction constant is @xmath12 then @xmath18 satisfies @xmath34 with the following boundary conditions , where @xmath35 is a unit normal vector field to @xmath32 : @xmath36 the effect of the active regions of types ii and iii are captured by a robin boundary condition on @xmath31 and by a transition ( discontinuity ) condition for the normal derivative of @xmath17 on active surfaces , respectively .",

    "the former has physical dimension of reciprocal of time and the latter reciprocal of distance .",
    "let us imagine that each catalyst particle is surrounded by an active `` collar region , '' or thin shell , and that each active transition surface @xmath39 has a definite width , so that these active sites can be regarded as being of type i. in other words , there is a zone of catalytic activity around each active particle to which we attribute a width @xmath43 .",
    "similarly for thin zones , or sites of type iii . by a standard approximation argument using the divergence theorem",
    ", we obtain the relation @xmath44    because the systems we are going to investigate in greater detail below only involve active regions of type ii and iii , it is @xmath13 rather than @xmath12 that will appear in our formulas for conversion @xmath7 .",

    "this quantity has the following probabilistic interpretation : @xmath46 the limit of @xmath47 for large values of @xmath13 , denoted @xmath48 , is the probability that the gas molecule started at @xmath19 visits an active site before leaving the reactor .",
    "this hitting probability is a well - studied quantity in probability theory that can be obtained by solving a dirichlet boundary value problem for laplace s equation .",
    "thus our main concern here is the determination of @xmath49 .",
    "this quantity may be interpreted as the _ conditional conversion _ , or the conversion probability of a reactant molecule conditional on the molecule actually hitting the catalyst .",
    "although the aforementioned procedure for computing @xmath7 can be implemented numerically quite effectively ( examples will be given below ) , it is useful to have model configurations of the reaction - diffusion system that can be solved analytically .",
    "we are particularly interested in determining explicitly how @xmath50 depends on @xmath13 .",

    "the problem thus reduces to dimension @xmath0 .",
    "see figure [ graphthinzones ] .     a network model with one catalyst particle at the node @xmath58 .",
    "see figure [ thinzones ] for the convention we are using to represent the different types of nodes.,width=192 ]    more generally , we may consider network models as in figure [ singlecat ] specified by the following data : a set @xmath59 of nodes ( or vertices ) which contains a subset @xmath60 of active nodes and the set @xmath61 of exit nodes , all other nodes being inert ; and a set @xmath62 of edges connecting pairs of nodes , each edge assigned a length . in our network diagrams inert vertices are indicated by a dot `` @xmath63 '' , active nodes by @xmath64  , and exit nodes by `` @xmath54 '' . if @xmath65 is an edge , we let @xmath66 denote its length . it is convenient to introduce the function @xmath67 on the set of nodes such that @xmath68 if @xmath69 is an active node , and @xmath70 if @xmath71 is inert .",

    ", the boundary value problem for the survival function @xmath17 restricted to @xmath59 reduces to the system of linear equations : @xmath75 and @xmath76 for more details , see @xcite .",
    "thus , for such network models , finding @xmath77 , where @xmath19 is now a node of the metric graph , reduces to the elementary problem of solving a system of linear equations .",

    "it is interesting to observe that the length of the spokes is irrelevant since only their number , or the degree @xmath90 of the active node , enters into the expression of conversion for this example .",
    "the reader is referred to the linear chain of thin zones example of figure [ thinzones ] and its network model of figure [ graphthinzones ] .",
