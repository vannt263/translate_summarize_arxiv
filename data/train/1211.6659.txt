    "the physical and geometrical properties of ngc 6240 are different from those of mrk 231 .",

    "large oh@xmath33 and h@xmath2o@xmath33 abundances are only sustained in gas clouds with high ionization fractions ( @xmath144 ) , which are produced by elevated cosmic ray or x - ray fluxes ( cf .",
    "their absence hints that the bulk of the gas is not exposed to high ionization rates resulting from agn or starburst / supervae activity .",

    "an agn ( creating an xdr ) generates a uv continuum which contains approximately ten times more energy than the x - ray field , and also heats the dust efficiently . in shocks , on the contrary , the gas is compressed and heated to higher temperatures , while the dust is not affected ( except for shock velocities and densities that are orders of magnitude higher ) . assuming that shocks are not heating the dust and that all the far - infrared luminosity is reprocessed radiation from the agn",
    ", we obtain a maximum agn contribution of @xmath150 percent .",

    "this is similar to the fwhm of the co @xmath35 line at the emission peak between the two nuclei , suggesting that the co @xmath1 emission is also located in this region .",
    "the projected distance between these nuclei on the sky is @xmath157  pc , and the true distance between them is estimated at 1.4 kpc @xcite .",
    "these authors assume that the two nuclei are on a circular orbit , of which the position angle and inclination are the same as that of the co - disk between the two nuclei @xcite , and that the velocity difference between the two nuclei is 150 km  s@xmath8 .",
    "the agn x - ray luminosities are not enough to power the co excitation of the gas that is residing between the two nuclei , since they are geometrically diluted and absorbed : the luminosities derived by @xcite give an x - ray flux at 250 pc from the agn of @xmath158  erg  @xmath149  s@xmath8 . @xcite",
    "derive a much larger luminosity by an obscured agn , with an absorbing screen of @xmath159  @xmath149 which also reduces the x - ray fluxes below @xmath160  erg  @xmath149  s@xmath8 .",
