    "online social networks ( osns ) such as facebook have become one of the primary outlets for businesses and enterprises to advertise and communicate with their customers . just in 2013 , facebook s net ad revenue amounted to $ 6.7b , i.e. , 5.64% of the global market  @xcite .",
    "one feature offered by facebook is the concept of _ pages _ , which business can create , e.g. , to display information about products and events .",
    "users can _ like _ them to receive updates , post messages , or connect with other customers .",
    "page likes also become part of the user s profile",
    ". the number of likes for a given page is often considered a measure of its popularity : chompon estimates the expected revenue from each like to be $ 8 , while other estimates range between $ 3.60 , $ 136.38 , and $ 214.81  @xcite .    to reach out to their potential audience , businesses can _ promote _ their facebook page using targeted ads , via _ page like _ ads .",
    "based on the advertiser s preferences , ads can be targeted to users from a specific age or location group , or to users who have certain interests . as per facebook",
    "s guidelines , this is the only legitimate way to collect page likes  @xcite .",
    "however , a growing underground industry has emerged that provides paid services , aka _ like farms _ , to inflate the number of facebook page likes .",
    "some recent press articles  @xcite have started to look into facebook page promotion methods and speculated that like farms use fake profiles trying to imitate real users behavior . as these likes  which we call _ fake likes _",
    " do not correspond to a genuine interest in the advertised page , they are less valuable to businesses in terms of potential customer engagement and revenue",
    ". other reports  @xcite have suggested that promoting pages using legitimate facebook ad campaigns may also garner significant amounts of fake likes .",
    "one possible explanation is that fake profiles attempt to diversify their liking activities to avoid facebook s fraud detection algorithms .",
    "to do so , they need to click on ads and like pages other than those they are paid for .",
    "however , to the best of our knowledge , there has been no systematic analysis of facebook pages promotion methods , even though the understanding of fake likes is arguably crucial to improve algorithms for fraud detection / mitigation in osns .    in this paper , we start addressing this gap with a comparative measurement study of facebook likes garnered by means of legitimate facebook page like ads and by using a few underground like farms .",
    "we set up thirteen facebook _ honeypot _ pages and promote them using both methods .",
    "we monitor the likes garnered by these pages , collect information about the likers ( e.g. , gender , age , location , friend list , etc . ) , and perform a comparative analysis based on demographic , temporal , and social characteristics of the likers .",
    "our study highlights a few interesting findings . when targeting facebook users worldwide , we obtain likes from only a few countries .",
    "likers profiles also seem to be skewed toward male profiles .",
    "we found evidence that different like farms ( with different pricing schemes ) garner likes from a similar set of users and may be managed by the same operator .",
    "we also identified two main _ modi operandi _ of the like farms .",
    "our results suggest that a first set of farms is operated by bots and do not really try to hide the nature of their operations , delivering likes in bursts and forming disconnected social sub - graphs .",
    "other farms follow a stealthier approach , mimicking regular users behavior , and rely on a large and well - connected network structure to gradually deliver likes while keeping a small count of likes per user .",
    "the first strategy reflects a `` quick and dirty '' approach where likes from disposable fake users ( as also indicated by the number of terminated accounts ) are delivered rapidly , as opposed to the second one , which exhibits a stealthier approach that leverages the underlying social graph , where real users ( or well - masked fake users ) trickle their likes .",
    "we did not find direct evidence that the likes garnered by the facebook campaigns also originate from like farms . however , when comparing profiles attracted by the facebook campaigns to those associated with like farms , we did identify a noticeable overlap in the pages they liked overall .",
    "we also observed that likers from facebook campaigns liked a lot more pages than typical facebook users , and much closer to that observed for like farm users .",
    "prior work has studied and detected sybil and/or fake osn accounts by relying on tightly - knit community structures  @xcite .",
    "findings revealed by our work also highlight several characteristics about the social structure and activity of fake profiles attracted by the honeypot pages , e.g. , their interconnected nature or the activity bursts .",
    "in fact , our analysis does not only confirm a few insights used by sybil detection algorithms but also reveals new patterns that could complement them .",
    "a few _ passive _ measurement studies have also focused on characterizing fake user accounts and their activity .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite studied phantom profiles in facebook gaming applications , while thomas _ et al . _",
    "@xcite analyzed over 1.1 million accounts suspended by twitter .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite studied spam campaigns on facebook originating from approximately 57,000 user accounts .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite performed an empirical analysis of social relationships between spam accounts on twitter , and dave _ et al . _",
    "@xcite proposed a methodology to measure and fingerprint click - spam in ad networks .",
    "our work differs from these studies as they all conduct passive measurements , whereas we rely on the deployment of several honeypot pages and ( paid ) campaigns to actively engage with fake profiles .",
    "stringhini _ et al .",
    "_  @xcite and lee _ et al . _",
    "@xcite created honeypot profiles in facebook , myspace , and twitter to detect spammers .",
    "their work differs from ours in that ( 1 ) their honeypot profiles were designed to look legitimate , while our honeypot pages explicitly indicated they were not `` real '' ( to deflect real profiles ) , and ( 2 ) our honeypot pages _ actively _ attracted fake profiles by means of paid campaigns , as opposed to passive honeypot profiles .",
    "also , thomas",
    "_ et al._@xcite analyzed trafficking of fake accounts in twitter .",
    "they bought fake profiles from 27 merchants and developed a classifier to detect these fake accounts . in a similar study , stringhini _ et al . _",
    "@xcite analyzed the market of _ twitter followers _ , which , akin to facebook like farms , provide twitter followers for sale .",
    "note that twitter follower markets differ from facebook like farms as twitter entails a _ follower - followee _",
    "relationship among users , while facebook friendships imply a bidirectional relationships . also , there is no equivalent of liking a facebook page in the twitter ecosystem .",
    "beutel _ et al . _",
    "@xcite proposed a technique to detect fake likes based on identifying groups of users who liked a set of pages within a given time period .",
    "however , their technique does not rely on ground truth data , so it is unclear whether or not the detection mechanism blocks all fake likes , or actually only those exhibiting a certain pattern .",
    "by contrast , we focus on actively measuring like fraud activities by means of honeypots , i.e. , attracting fake likes to empty pages , through payment . we elicit and study ground truth data , and highlight how some like farms actually try to emulate behavior of regular users and thereby stay below the detection radar .",
    "nonetheless , our work serves as the starting point for improved fake like detection and can complement techniques from  @xcite .",
    "finally , a few investigative press reports  @xcite have also looked into facebook page ads and underground like farms , however , without any systematic analysis of facebook pages promotion methods .    [ cols= \" < , < , < , < , > , > , > , > , > \" , ]      next , we evaluated the social graph induced by the likers profiles . to this end , we associated each user with one of the like farm services based on the page they liked .",
    "note that a few users liked pages in multiple campaigns , as we will discuss in section  [ sec : likeanalysis ] .",
    "a significant fraction of users actually liked pages corresponding to both the authenticlikes and the mammothsocials campaigns ( see figure  [ fig : like - distribution ] ) : we put these users into a separate group , labelled as alms .",
    "table  [ tab : likersandfriendships ] summarizes the number of likers associated with each service , as well as additional details about their friendship networks .",
    "note that the number of likers reported for each campaign in table  [ tab : likersandfriendships ] is different from the number of campaign likes ( table  [ tbl : measurements ] ) , since some users liked more than one page .",
    "many likers kept their friend lists private : this occurred for almost 80% of likers in the facebook campaigns , about 75% in the boostlikes campaign , and much less frequently for the other like farm campaigns ( @xmath04060% ) .",
    "the number and percentage of users with public friend lists are reported in table  [ tab : likersandfriendships ] .",
    "the fourth column reports the average number of friends ( @xmath1 the standard deviation ) for profiles with visible friend lists , and the fifth column reports the median .",
    "some friendship relations may be hidden , e.g. , if a friend chose to be invisible in friend lists , thus , these numbers only represent a _",
    "lower bound_. the average number of friends of users associated with the boostlikes campaign ( and to a smaller extent , the authenticlikes campaign ) was much higher than the average number of friends observed elsewhere .",
    "to evaluate the social ties between likers , we looked at friendship relations between likers ( either originating from the same campaign provider or not ) , ignoring friendship relations with facebook users who did not like any of our pages .",
    "table  [ tab : likersandfriendships ] ( sixth column ) reports , for each provider , the overall number of friendship relationships between likers that involved users associated with the provider .    in figure",
    "[ fig : friendship ] , we plot the social graph induced by such friendship relations ( likers who did not have friendship relations with any other likers were excluded from the graph ) . based on the resulting social structure , we suggest that :    1 .",
    "dense relations between likers from boostlikes point to an interconnected network of real users , or fake users who mimic complex ties to pose as real users ; 2 .",
    "the pairs ( and occasionally triplets ) that characterize socialformula likers might indicate a different strategy of constructing fake networks , mitigating the risk that identification of a user as fake would consequently bring down the whole connected network of fake users ; and 3 .",
    "the friendship relations between authenticlikes and mammothsocials likers might indicate that the same operator manages both services .",
    "we also considered indirect links between likers , through mutual friends .",
    "table  [ tab : likersandfriendships ] reports the overall number of 2-hop relationships between likers from the associated provider .",
    "figure  [ fig:2hop_friendship ] plots the relations between likers who either have a direct relation or a mutual friend , clearly pointing to the presence of relations between likers from the same provider .",
    "these tight connections , along with the number of their friends , suggest that we only see a small part of these networks .",
    "( in fact , like farms sell packages of as many as 50k likes . ) for socialformula , authenticlikes , and mammothsocials , we also observe many isolated pairs and triplets of likers who are not connected .",
    "one possible explanation is that farm users create fake facebook accounts and keep them separate from their personal accounts and friends .",
    "in contrast , the boostlikes network is well - connected .",
    "we then looked at the _ other _ pages liked by profiles attracted to our honeypot pages . in figure",
    "[ fig : like - distribution - facebook ] and [ fig : like - distribution - farms ] , respectively , we plot the distribution of the number of page likes for facebook ads and like farm campaigns users . to draw a baseline comparison , we also collected page like counts from a random set of 2000 facebook users , extracted from an unbiased sample of facebook user population .",
    "the original sample was crawled for another project  @xcite , obtained by randomly sampling facebook public directory which lists all the ids of searchable profiles .",
    "we observed a large variance in the number of pages liked , ranging from 1 to 10,000 .",
    "the median page like count ranged between 600 and 1000 for users from the facebook campaigns and between 1200 and 1800 for those from like farm campaigns , with the exception of the bl - usa campaign ( median was 63 ) .",
    "in contrast , the median page like count for our baseline facebook user sample was 34 .",
    "the page like counts of our baseline sample mirrored numbers reported in prior work , e.g. , according to @xcite , the average number of pages liked by facebook users amounts to roughly 40 .",
    "in other words , our honeypot pages attracted users that tend to like significantly more pages than regular facebook users .",
    "since our honeypot pages both for facebook and like farm campaigns explicitly indicated they were not `` real '' , we argue that a vast majority of the garnered likes are fake .",
    "we argue that these users like a large number of pages because they are probably reused for multiple `` jobs '' and also like `` normal '' pages to mimic real users .    to confirm our hypothesis , for each pair of campaigns , we plot their jaccard similarity .",
    "specifically , let @xmath2 denote the set of pages liked by a user @xmath3 : the jaccard similarity between the set of likes by likers of two campaigns @xmath4 and @xmath5 , which we plot in figure   [ fig : similarity - matrix - a ] , is defined as @xmath6 , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "we also plot , in figure  [ fig : similarity - matrix - b ] , the similarity between @xmath9 and @xmath10 , i.e. , the similarity between the set of likers of the different campaigns .",
    "note from figure [ fig : similarity - matrix ] that fb - ind , fb - egy , and fb - all have relatively large ( jaccard ) similarity with each other .",
    "in addition , the sf - usa and sf - all pair and the al - usa and ms - usa pair also have relatively large jaccard similarity .",
    "these findings suggest that the same fake profiles are used in multiple campaigns by a like farm ( e.g. , sf - all and sf - usa ) .",
    "moreover , some fake profiles seem to be shared by different like farms ( e.g. , al - usa and ms - usa ) , suggesting that they are run by the same operator .",
    "this paper presented a comparative measurement study of facebook page promotion methods , aiming to shed light on like farms activities .",
    "we identified two main _ modi operandi _ : ( 1 ) some farms , like socialformula and authenticlikes , seem to be operated by bots and do not really try to hide the nature of their operations , as demonstrated by large bursts of likes and the limited number of friends per profile ; ( 2 ) other farms , like boostlikes , follow a much stealthier approach , aiming to mimic regular users behavior , and rely on their large and well - connected network structure to disseminate the target likes while keeping a small count of likes per user . for the latter , we also observed a high number of friends per profile and a `` reasonable '' number of likes .    a month after the campaigns",
    ", we checked whether or not likers accounts were still active : as shown in table  [ tbl : measurements ] , only one account associated with boostlikes was terminated , as opposed to 9 , 20 , and 44 for the other like farms .",
    "11 accounts from the regular facebook campaigns were also terminated .",
    "although occurring not so frequently , the accounts termination might be indicative of the disposable nature of fake accounts on most like farms , where  bot - like \" patterns are actually easy to detect .",
    "it also mirrors the challenge facebook is confronted by , with like farms such as boostlikes that exhibit patterns closely resembling real users behavior , thus making fake like detection quite difficult .",
    "we stress that our findings do not necessarily imply that advertising on facebook is ineffective , since our campaigns were specifically designed to avert real users .",
    "however , our work provides strong evidence that likers attracted on our honeypot pages , even when using legitimate facebook campaigns , are significantly different from typical facebook users , which confirms the concerns about the genuineness of these likes .",
    "we also show that most fake likes exhibit some peculiar characteristics  including demographics , likes , temporal and social graph patterns  that can and should be exploited by like fraud detection algorithms .    besides the design of detection techniques , items for future work include larger and more diverse honeypots measurements as well as longer observation of removed likes .",
    "also , as suggested in prior work  @xcite , fake likes might be generated via fake accounts , malware , malicious browser extensions , and social engineering , thus prompting the need for further investigation of fake likes origin .",
    "* acknowledgments .",
    "* we would like to thank the reviewers and our shepherd for their feedback and useful comments .",
    "we are also grateful to gianluca stringhini for reviewing a draft of the paper ."
