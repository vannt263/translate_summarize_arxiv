    "at low energies , few - body systems with large scattering length exhibit universal features ( universality ) that are independent of the interaction details .",
    "some consequences are the existence of a shallow bound state and the efimov effect@xcite in the two- and three - body sectors , respectively .",
    "these universal properties have a wide range of applications , from particle and nuclear to atomic and molecular physics@xcite .",
    "universality has been put on a different light in the language of effective field theory ( eft)@xcite .",
    "eft is suitable for energies with an associated compton wavelength @xmath0 that is much larger than the interaction radius @xmath1 , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are respectively the characteristic low and high momentum scales .",
    "the formalism allows for corrections of @xmath4 , obtained in a systematic and model - independent way . for nuclear systems with @xmath5",
    ", it provides a convincing explanation for some few - nucleon correlations , like the phillips@xcite and tjon@xcite lines , as well as reliable error estimates for some astrophysical reactions like@xcite @xmath6 .",
    "technical and numerical complications arise for nuclei with @xmath7 .",
    "there are , however , interesting situations of halos and weakly bound nuclear clusters , where large simplifications can be achieved .",
    "the typical momentum @xmath3 required to excite the core / clusters is much larger than the momentum @xmath2 that binds the clusters altogether .",
    "the degrees of freedom then become the clusters themselves@xcite , usually stable nuclei like alpha particles and nucleons . in the following i present eft studies for alpha - alpha ( @xmath8 ) and nucleon - alpha ( @xmath9 ) interactions , which are the basic ones in order to build more complex systems , like the @xmath10he halo nuclei , the first @xmath11 excited state in @xmath12c ( hoyle state ) , or the @xmath13 excited @xmath14be state .",
    "in halo eft each cluster is represented by an elementary field , with short - range forces represented by contact interactions .",
    "this is a good approximation for systems whose binding ( or resonance ) energy has a compton wavelength @xmath15 much larger than the radius @xmath16 of the largest cluster can be computed in a controlled and systematic way . ] . to simplify the discussion ,",
    "let us consider a system of two identical bosons , with mass @xmath17 , represented by a field @xmath18 and an @xmath19-wave strong interaction .",
    "the latter is described by the lagrangian @xmath20\\phi -\\,d^{\\dagger}\\bigg[i\\partial_0+\\frac{\\vec\\nabla^2}{4m_{\\alpha } } -\\delta\\bigg]d+g\\,\\big[d^{\\dagger}\\phi\\phi+(\\phi\\phi)^{\\dagger}d\\big ] + \\cdots\\ , , \\label{eq : lolag}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we introduce an auxiliary ( dimeron ) field @xmath21 , with `` residual mass '' @xmath22 , carrying the quantum numbers of two bosons in @xmath19-wave and coupling with their fields through the constant @xmath23 .",
    "the dots stand for higher order terms in a derivative expansion .",
    "the form of the scattering amplitude depends on the magnitude of the parameters in the lagrangian .",
    "here we concentrate on the scale of @xmath22 , which determines the size of the scattering length @xmath24 to get an effective range with a natural size , @xmath25 . ] .",
    "a minimal fine - tuning on @xmath26 provides an unnaturally large @xmath27 , corresponding to a system of strongly interacting bosons generates @xmath28 and a system of weakly interacting bosons . ] .",
    "this situation is analogous to the nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath29 ) case@xcite .",
    "the kinetic term @xmath30 of the dimeron propagator is subleading compared to @xmath22 and the amplitude has the form of the effective range expansion ( ere ) formula , with the effective range @xmath31 , shape parameter @xmath32 , and higher order terms treated in perturbation theory .",
    "however , the power counting for nuclear clusters is often more complicated . in @xmath8 scattering for example@xcite ,",
    "an extra amount of fine - tuning ( @xmath33 ) is necessary to generate an even larger scattering length , @xmath34 . as a consequence ,",
    "the dimeron s kinetic and residual mass terms become of comparable order , which requires resummation of @xmath31 to all orders .",
    "this resummation is necessary to reproduce a narrow resonance at low energy@xcite .",
    "electromagnetic interactions are introduced in the usual way , among which coulomb is the dominant one at low energies@xcite .",
    "the latter was formulated in the eft framework by kong and ravndal@xcite for the two - protons system , and can be extended in a straightforward way to include resonances .",
    "the coulomb - modified strong amplitude @xmath35 is diagramatically illustrated by fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( see caption ) and has the form of a geometric series . like in the proton - proton case ,",
    "the power counting for narrow resonances requires resummation .",
    "up to next - to - leading order ( nlo ) one gets for our two - boson example , with reduced mass @xmath36 and charge @xmath37 , @xmath38\\ , , \\label{eq : ampsc2}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 is the inverse of the bohr radius , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 .",
    "there is a small complication in this formula , that around the resonance energy multiple  kinematical fine - tunings \" are required@xcite .",
    "this is a technical rather than a conceptual problem , and can be handled via an expansion around the resonance pole@xcite .",
    "the @xmath8 system is dominated by @xmath19-wave at low energies , with the presence of a very narrow resonance at @xmath44  kev and width @xmath45  mev ( the @xmath46be ground state ) .",
    "the @xmath8 scattering length @xmath47  fm is nearly three orders of magnitude larger than the alpha matter radius , suggesting the large amount of fine - tuning discussed in the last section .",
    "the low - energy scale @xmath48  mev is roughly seven times smaller than a high momentum scale associated to either the pion mass or the excitation energy of the alpha particle , @xmath49  mev . within the power counting for resonances",
    ", one would expect convergent results for observables at laboratory energies up to 3  mev .",
    "coulomb interactions are described in terms of the momentum scale @xmath50 which , due to the large @xmath8 reduced mass , is numerically of @xmath51 .",
    "the low - energy amplitude is then obtained by expanding the function @xmath52 for large @xmath53 .",
    "however , it is interesting to discuss the other limit @xmath54 , when coulomb is turned off . in this case one has @xmath55 , which is larger than the terms @xmath56 and @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) . as a consequence , at leading order",
    "the denominator of the amplitude is given by the unitarity term @xmath59 , and the @xmath8 exhibits non - relativistic conformal invariance**???**. such unitary limit implies the existence of the @xmath46be ground state right at threshold , and the corresponding three - body system ( @xmath12c ) showing an exact efimov spectrum .",
    "these results change for a physical value of @xmath50 , due to the breaking of conformal invariance by coulomb forces .",
    "nevertheless , the fact that the ground state of @xmath46be and the hoyle state in @xmath12c remain very close to the threshold into @xmath60-particles suggests that this conformal picture is not far from the real case .    the low - energy expansion of @xmath52 up to nlo is given by @xmath61 , and resembles the usual effective range expansion .",
    "defining @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and performing an expansion around the resonance pole , @xmath35 reads @xmath64 , \\label{eq : poletcs}\\ ] ] where @xmath65 is the momentum of the resonance .",
    "the scattering length is obtained from @xmath66 an intriguing puzzle arises at this point . in the @xmath29 case ,",
    "the fine - tuning necessary to generate the low - energy bound and virtual states reflects a sensitivity to qcd parameters .",
    "for the present case , this sensitivity seems to be much larger , as indicated by two orders of magnitude of @xmath22 away from a natural size . apart from that",
    ", one observes an extra fine - tuning generated by a roughly 90% cancellation between strong and electromagnetic contributions in the parameter @xmath67 , now of @xmath68 .",
    "that leads to a scattering length of @xmath69 , an order of magnitude larger than its purely strong part .",
    "it is remarkable , that if the strong forces generated an @xmath31 11% larger the @xmath46be ground state would be bound , with drastic consequences in the formation of elements in the universe ( see also ref.@xcite ) .    despite the large fine - tunings and cancellations of strong and electromagnetic contributions ,",
    "we obtain a successful description of @xmath8 scattering at low energies , as shown in fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "@xmath19-wave phase shifts and ere parameters can be found in a review by afzal _",
    "et al._@xcite and references therein .",
    "the latest extraction of ere parameters before our work was done in ref.@xcite , with numerical values given in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "we used the available scattering data , combined with the most recent measurement of the resonance properties@xcite , and we were able to extract the ere parameters with smaller errorbars .",
    "the disagreement between ref.@xcite and our results for @xmath24 is likely due to an approximation made in the latter , as discussed in details in ref.@xcite .",
    "[ tab1 ]    our combined fit , albeit showing a convergence pattern , still has a relative large @xmath70 .",
    "if one uses only the scattering data , the fit becomes much better but the resonance width is well underpredicted .",
    "this happens regardless if one uses eft or the conventional ere .",
    "we take this as indication that the measurement of the resonance properties and the ( rather old ) scattering data are incompatible with each order or , at least , one of them has overestimated quoted errors .",
    "reanalysis or even new measurements of scattering data seem necessary to resolve this discrepancy .      at low energies",
    "@xmath9 scattering is dominated by the waves @xmath71 ( or the notation @xmath72 ) , @xmath73 ( @xmath74 ) , and @xmath75 ( @xmath76 ) . a narrow , low - energy resonance is seen in the @xmath74 channel , and a very broad one , at the @xmath76 channel .",
    "the latter is a perturbative effect that appears only beyond the nlo that we are working on@xcite .",
    "therefore , for eft up to this order , only @xmath72 and @xmath74 are relevant .",
    "the power counting for a narrow @xmath77-wave resonance was developed in refs.@xcite with an application to neutron - alpha ( @xmath78 ) scattering .",
    "recently we incorporated the expansion around the resonance pole to this process , obtaining similar to ( but showing better convergence than ) the previous works@xcite .    in proton - alpha ( @xmath79 ) scattering ,",
    "coulomb interactions are included by extending the formalism from @xmath19-wave@xcite to @xmath77-wave strong interactions .",
    "one important difference is that in the latter not only the `` scattering length '' @xmath80 , but also the `` effective range '' @xmath81 , are renormalized by coulomb loops .",
    "fig.[fig3 ] shows our preliminary results for @xmath79 cross - section at @xmath82 laboratory angle , compared against results of ref.@xcite using the ere .",
    "clearly , a good agreement is achieved already at lo .",
    "i presented the eft formalism for cluster resonances in the presence of coulomb interactions . as applications , low - energy @xmath8 and @xmath9 scattering",
    "were successfully described .",
    "these two interactions are the basic ones before considering more complicated clusters of @xmath60 and nucleons .",
    "the hoyle state in @xmath12c is particularly interesting due to its relevance in the formation of heavy elements .",
    "a model - study with this state in mind was developed in ref.@xcite , where a perturbative treatment of the coulomb interaction was proposed .",
    "this idea could be useful to handle the technical difficulties involving three charged particles .",
    "i would like to thank hans - werner hammer , bira van kolck , and carlos bertulani for stimulating collaboration , and the organizers of the asia - pacific few - body 2008 for the invitation and enjoyable conference .",
