    "long - duration gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) emit their bulk luminosity over a time period of 2 - 50 sec in the 100 - 1000 kev range ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "their afterglows are generally assumed to arise from the interaction of the blast wave with the surrounding interstellar material ( ism ) , where a strong relativistic shock is driven ( so - called external shock ) .",
    "this happens about 10@xmath2 - 10@xmath3 sec after the burst , at distances of the order of 3@xmath410@xmath5 cm @xcite .",
    "the shocked gas is the source of a long - lived , slowly decaying afterglow emission .",
    "some afterglows have shown substantial optical variability , both at early times as well as at late times .",
    "the early ones can be distinguished into a component which tracks the prompt gamma - rays ( grb 041219a @xcite , grb 050820a @xcite , grb 080319b @xcite ) and an afterglow component which starts during or shortly after the prompt phase ( grb 990123 @xcite , grb 030418 @xcite , grb 060111b @xcite ) .",
    "the former component has been attributed to internal shocks , while the latter component was interpreted as reverse shock emission , e.g. @xcite . at late times , some grb afterglows ( 021004 , 030329 ) showed bumps on top of the canonical fading , with timescales of 10@xmath3 - 10@xmath0 sec .",
    "originally , these bumps have been interpreted as the interaction of the fireball with moderate density enhancements in the ambient medium , with a density contrast of order 10 @xcite , and later by additional energy injection episodes @xcite .",
    "the optical variability due to the interaction with the ism is expected to be not faster than 10@xmath6 sec , because the blast wave , once it has swept up enough interstellar material to produce the canonical afterglow emission , is thought to be only mildly relativistic .",
    "this is different with optical emission possibly related to the forward or reverse shock : here the emission is relativistic , and the timescales in the observer frame are shortened by @xmath7 , with @xmath1 being the bulk lorentz factor which typically is assumed to be 300500 . the reverse shock is predicted to happen with little delay with respect to the gamma - ray emission unless the lorentz factor is very small , and the corresponding optical emission has a decay - time power law index of -2 for a constant density environment , or up to -2.8 for a wind density profile @xcite .",
    "swift / bat triggered on grb 080129 ( trigger 301981 ) at 06:06:46 ut @xcite which had an observed duration t@xmath8=48 sec .",
    "bat measured a fluence ( over t@xmath8 , the time during which 90% of the fluence is emitted ) of 8.9@xmath410@xmath9 erg / cm@xmath2 in the 15 - 150 kev band .",
    "the spectral slope is 1.3 with no spectral turn - over up to 150 kev .",
    "if we assume the expected spectral turn - over according to a canonical grb spectrum to be at e@xmath11 = 300 ( 500 ) kev , the total isotropic gamma - ray energy equivalent is e@xmath12 = 6.5(7.7 ) @xmath13 erg ( 151000 kev ) . at 320 sec after the trigger , swift slewed to a different location on the sky , placing the line - of - sight towards the grb nearly in the bat detector plane , therefore being blind to any late emission .",
    "pointed observations of the grb with the x - ray telescope ( xrt ) and the uv - optical telescope ( uvot ) started only at 07:00:08 ut , 3.2 ksec after the grb trigger .",
    "a clearly fading x - ray source was discovered , but no emission seen with uvot @xcite .",
    "we started optical / near - infrared ( nir ) imaging with grond immediately after the trigger , and had independently identified the optical / nir afterglow @xcite though we reported it after bloom ( 2008 ) . here",
    "we report the full results .",
    "grond , a simultaneous 7-channel imager @xcite mounted at the 2.2 m mpi / eso telescope at la silla ( chile ) , started observing the field at 06:10:18 ut , about 4 min after the grb .",
    "our imaging sequence began with 46 sec integrations in the @xmath14 channels , spaced at about 50 sec due to detector read - out and preset to a new telescope dither position .",
    "after about 10 min , the exposure time was increased to 137 sec , and after another 28 min to 408 sec . since the afterglow brightness was rising , the exposure time was reduced back to 137 sec at 07:21 for the rest of the night . in parallel",
    ", the three near - infrared channels @xmath15 were operated with 10 sec integrations , separated by 5 sec due to read - out , data - transfer and @xmath16-band mirror movement .",
    "the first images immediately revealed a strongly flaring source .",
    "the light curve of the afterglow ( fig . [ lc ] ) shows this unique pattern in more detail : there is a @xmath173 mag amplitude flare of 80 sec ( full - width at half maximum ; fwhm ) duration , peaking at @xmath17540 sec post - burst .",
    "thereafter , the afterglow brightness is continuously rising until 6000 sec after the grb . at the beginning of the next night , at 65 ksec after the grb , the afterglow intensity is still at the same level , despite declining by a factor of 25 at x - rays .",
    "in contrast , in the 65 - 500 ksec interval the emission in the optical / nir and x - rays is correlated , with a slow rise ( t@xmath18 ) over another day , and a subsequent rapid decay ( t@xmath19 ) .",
    "we obtained an optical spectrum of the afterglow of grb 080129 in the 500 - 800 nm region with fors1/vlt ( fig .",
    "[ redsh ] ) on jan 30 , 2008 , 06:16 ( mid - time ) consisting of 4 exposures of 1800 sec each .",
    "the strong fringing of the blue - sensitive detector long - wards of 7500 and the strong foreground extinction of @xmath20=3.4 mag result in a limited range of the spectrum being useful for analysis ; but luckily ly@xmath21 and some metal absorption lines like siii ( 1260  ) and siiv ( 1402  ) happen to fall in this usable range , so that a redshift of @xmath22=4.349@xmath230.002 ( luminosity distance of 40 gpc in concordance cosmology ) could be derived .",
    "observations with vlt / isaac ( eso paranal , chile ) and ntt / sofi ( eso la silla , chile ) were triggered to monitor grb 080129 in the nir with high - time resolution photometry .",
    "isaac was used in fastphot mode in @xmath24 band on 2008 jan 30 , between ut 00:34 and 02:35 , with 14.3 ms exposures , while sofi was used thereafter from ut 03:30 to 05:04 with 40.1 ms exposures ( also fastphotjitt mode in @xmath24 band ) .",
    "after bias and flatfield correction and background subtraction the frames were stacked to achieve longer total integration times ( 4000 frames combined give 57.2 s integration time in isaac , 1000 frames combined give 40 s integration time in sofi ) .",
    "the light curves do not show any flaring activity above 0.3 mag amplitude .      for the photometric observations at 1.2 mm ( 250 ghz ) we used the 117 channel max - planck bolometer array mambo-2 @xcite at the iram 30 m telescope on pico veleta , spain .",
    "mambo-2 has a half - power spectral bandwidth from 210 to 290 ghz , with an effective bandwidth center for flat spectra of 249@xmath231 ghz ( 1.20 mm , 2@xmath232 mm percipitable water vapor ) .",
    "the effective beam fwhm is 10.7 arcsec , and the undersampled field of view is 4 arcmin .",
    "atmospheric conditions were generally good during the observations , with typical line of sight opacities between 0.2 and 0.3 and low sky noise .",
    "the on sky integration times varied between 1200 and 5000 sec on the five epochs .",
    "observations were performed using the standard on - off technique , with the sub - reflector switching every 0.25 seconds between two sky positions ( on and off source ) separated by 32 arcsec .",
    "the telescope pointing was frequently checked on a nearby quasar and was found to be stable within 2 arcsec .",
    "the data were analyzed using the mopsic software package .",
    "correlated noise was subtracted from each channel using the weighted average signals from the surrounding channels .",
    "absolute flux calibration was done through observations of planets , resulting in a flux calibration uncertainty of about 20% .",
    "the third  fifth epochs on feb 3 , 6 and 10 yielded only upper limits of @xmath250.5 mjy ( 3@xmath26 ) ( see tab .",
    "[ submm ] ) .",
    "the rising light curve between 1000 - 6000 sec after the grb is likely the emerging afterglow .",
    "the rather steep power law photon index of @xmath21 = -1.35@xmath230.15 and the flux rise ( f @xmath27 t@xmath28 ) with @xmath29 indicate that the characteristic synchrotron frequency has already crossed the optical band at t=1000 sec .",
    "our interpretation for the rising part is that the ejecta have not entered the deceleration phase at t=6000 sec . in this case",
    "one can use the peak time of the light curve at t6000 sec , to estimate the fireball lorentz factor at the time of the deceleration which is expected to be half of the initial lorentz factor @xmath30 @xcite . using the formulation of @xcite",
    ", we obtain for the ism case @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the radiative efficiency @xcite . ignoring the weak dependence on @xmath33 and the external density @xmath34 , and using our above derived @xmath35=0.7",
    ", we get @xmath36 ( with allowed values down to 85 if the peak emission was at 15.000 sec instead of 6.000 sec ) .      at very late times , starting at 180 ksec after the grb , the x - ray and optical / nir emission vary achromatically . again , this is in contrast to the behaviour in most swift grbs @xcite , but the steepening of the decay to @xmath37 and the spectrum by @xmath38 ( tab .",
    "[ sedtab ] ) is consistent with a jet break .",
    "the jet angle @xmath39 was calculated following sari et al .",
    "( 1999 ) for the ism model and bloom et al .",
    "( 2003 ) for the wind model , where in the former case the redshift factor was added : @xmath40 using e@xmath41 = 6.5(7.7)@xmath13 erg / s ( see introduction ) , our derived redshift , a circumburst density n = 1 @xmath42 , and a break time of @xmath43 = 180000 sec = 2.08 days , as well as the canonical values @xmath44 = 1 and @xmath45 , we derive a jet opening angle of 435(426 ) for ism and 382(366 ) for a wind medium ( where the density follows @xmath46 , with @xmath47 = /4@xmath48",
    "g @xmath49 derived for the reference values = 1@xmath50 yr@xmath51 and @xmath52 km s@xmath51 ) .",
    "the beaming factor is @xmath53 .",
    "the corresponding jet angle - corrected energy is 1.88(2.13)@xmath410@xmath54 erg / s for ism , and 1.44(1.57)@xmath410@xmath54 erg / s for wind medium .",
    "this grb is remarkable for a second reason : it showed a prolonged plateau phase in its afterglow emission , most pronounced in the x - ray band .",
    "flat , or shallow - decay parts of the light curve are now commonly detected in the swift era @xcite , and occur between 100 sec until 10@xmath55 - 10@xmath0 sec after the burst . in grb 080129 ,",
    "we observe the plateau to last from 9000 - 56000 sec in the rest frame ( 50000 - 300.000 sec observers frame ) , so starting substantially later , but with a duration ( in the rest frame ) which is not extraordinary .",
    "however , the stunning fact is that this same plateau is also seen in the optical / nir data of grond . using also the mambo detection at 1.2 mm , the overall spectrum during the plateau",
    "can not be fit by a single power law , but requires a second component .",
    "adopting a broken power law , at least one break is required , with the break energy between the optical ( 400 nm ) and x - rays ( 0.5 kev ) .",
    "the best - fit power law indices are 1.57@xmath230.06 for the mambo - grond spectrum , and 2.36@xmath56 for the high - frequency part of the spectrum . integrating this spectrum over the duration of the plateau phase ( 69 hrs ) results in a total emitted energy , of 3.4@xmath13 erg , about 50% of the total energy emitted during t@xmath8 in the 15150 kev band .",
    "the optical flare is more difficult to explain due to primarily two facts : it is not correlated to the gamma - ray emission , but delayed by 12@xmath4t@xmath8 , and it occurs well before the peak of the optical afterglow .",
    "one possibility is to assume that it is the prompt emission of the grb while bat triggered on the precursor .",
    "the typical ratio of at least 30 for the gamma - ray fluence of proper burst to precursor @xcite implies e@xmath12 = 2.0(2.3 ) @xmath4 10@xmath57 erg , similar to the brightest previously known burst grb 990123 @xcite , therefore making the precursor hypothesis unlikely .",
    "another possibility to explain the optical flare is as the reverse shock emission . in a constant density environment",
    ", a reverse shock @xcite is expected to rise rapidly ( @xmath58 , where p is the powerlaw index of the electron distribution ) , and decline , in the thin shell case , with @xmath59 . with the canonical range of @xmath60 , this implies @xmath61 , and @xmath62 , in contrast to our observed values of @xmath63 and @xmath64 while this is true only for the simplest model , and the actual rise and decline values depend on the density profile and the @xmath65 values of the electron distribution , we are not aware of any reverse shock model that gives so steep flux density variations . note also that a wind profile , while helping in steepening the decline time , would not give a rising forward shock optical emission as we observe .",
    "yet another option is to interpret the flare as the simultaneous optical emission from an unobserved ( because swift / xrt did not point to the grb at that time ) x - ray flare .",
    "x - ray flares are commonly seen in grb afterglows , at times typically 1000 - 10000 sec ( rest frame ) after the grb @xcite . in our case , the early occurrence would be on the short side of this distribution , still consistent with this distribution .",
    "the presently generally accepted explanation for the x - ray flares is that they are due to late - time internal shocks @xcite , in particular either with a low @xmath1-difference ( so they collide late ) , or ejected with a large time difference ( late - time activity of the engine ) . for both cases ,",
    "one expects that the rise time is ( much ) shorter than the decay time : the rise time is basically the time it takes for the reverse shock of that collision to travel through the thickness of the shell .",
    "the decay time is due to the curvature effect , becoming important whenever the radius of the shell exceeds the shell thickness .",
    "thus , if we require that the decay time is not larger than the rise time ( as we observe ) , then the shell radius must be of the order of the shell thickness - and this is valid only very early after the grb , thus incompatible with our late - time occurrence .",
    "also , simultaneous swift / uvot observations of the many x - ray flares have not revealed such flaring activity in the uv / optical domain .",
    "thus , we consider it unlikely that the optical flare in grb 080129 is the optical counterpart of an unseen x - ray flare .    invoking a late internal shock between shells which have not produced gamma - ray emission , and collide at large radii , is another option .",
    "while this scenario has been already proposed to explain the early optical emission of grbs 990123 , 041219 and 060111b @xcite , it requires that the late ejections have , for some reason , very high @xmath1 of order 8001000 , without producing gamma - ray emission .",
    "this @xmath1 value is well above the measured @xmath1 120 of the main burst .",
    "finally , our light curve has , at first glance , some resemblance to that of grb 041219a , a long - duration ( @xmath66 sec ) burst for which pairitel obtained infrared photometry starting before the end of the burst @xcite . in that case",
    ", the first flare , occuring before the end of the burst emission , was associated to the internal shock that produced the grb ; however , the note added in proof implies that a re - analysis of the data showed less evidence for the rising part .",
    "thus , it remains open whether this emission was indeed a flare , or some slower - decaying prompt emission .",
    "the second flare at 3@xmath67 was associated with the reverse shock .",
    "the rise and decline times of this second flare , @xmath68 and @xmath69 are fully consistent even with the simplest model of a reverse shock , while our values for grb080129 are not .",
    "thus , the similarity between the observed optical / infrared light curves of grb 041219 and 080129 ends with the global structure of multiple peaks in the light curves , but does not provide clues to solve the discrepancies in the case of grb 080129 .",
    "the best match of the observed properties of the flare in grb 080129 with theoretical predictions is with residual collisions in grb outflows @xcite .",
    "internal collisions at small radii , which produce the @xmath70-ray emission , have been proposed to lead to residual collisions at much larger radii where the optical depth to long - wavelength photons is much lower .",
    "if the bulk lorentz factor is large , the optical emission is delayed by only fractions of a second with respect to the @xmath70-rays , and thus can explain the prompt optical emission which has been seen so far in a few grbs like grb 041219a , 050820a or 080319b . in the case of grb 080129 , @xmath1 120 , and the delay time can be longer than the duration of the burst ( in such case the electrons that radiate in the optically emitting region do not cool because of up - scattering the grb photons ) .",
    "li & waxman ( 2008 ) showed that the radius at which the ( observer - frame ) nir @xmath2710@xmath71 hz radiation becomes optically thin is r@xmath72 cm , resulting in a delay @xmath73 sec . assuming that the kinetic luminosity of the flow l@xmath74 erg / sec ( in fact the very long phase of optical emission between 1 - 3 days after the grb with a luminosity similar to that of the burst itself implies a large kinetic energy ) , the delay time can be @xmath75 100 sec if @xmath76 . the predicted spectral slope above the self - absorption frequency",
    "is @xmath77 , and @xmath78 below , consistent with our measured values of 0.57 and 1.2 , respectively ( rising part of the flare ) . also , the predicted ratio of f@xmath79/f@xmath80 compares well with the observed ratio of 1000 .",
    "given this tantalizing coincidences , we analyzed in more detail the shape of the optical flare light curve .",
    "it turns out that it can be well described by the superposition of two gaussian profiles ( fig .",
    "[ lc ] ; note that log gaussians or fast - rise - exponential - decay curves do not fit ) .",
    "we speculate that these are the direct signatures of the residual collisions .",
    "looking at the @xmath70-ray light curve from swift / bat ( fig .",
    "[ bat ] ) , one can recognize two pulses , the first with fwhm = 11 sec , the second with fwhm = 6 sec .",
    "it is interesting to note that the ratio of the fwhm of these pulses is two , identical to the corresponding ratio of the optical pulses .",
    "given that just the sequence of broad / narrow pulse has inverted , one could speculate even further that the shell causing the narrow , second peak in @xmath70-rays had a slightly higher @xmath1 and took over the shell causing the broader , first @xmath70-ray pulse , thus leading to the optical flare .",
    "a caveat with this interpretation comes from the observed fast variability of the flare .",
    "residual collisions are expected to result in a smooth optical lightcurve that varies on the delay timescale .",
    "alternatively the flare may be powered by dissipation of poynting flux in a localized `` hot spot '' in strongly magnetized ejecta @xcite . in this picture",
    "the fast variability is the result of the small emitting volume .",
    "the observed fluence of the flare is comparable to the energy available in the volume of the hot spot as constrained by the observed fractional duration of the flare @xmath81 @xcite .",
    "the energy contained in the `` hot spot '' is @xmath82 erg ( assuming again that the total energy in the ejecta is @xmath2710 times larger than the @xmath83 ) in this scenario of a `` hot spot '' , the radiation would also be strongly polarized - a prediction which can help to distinguish the above two models by future observations of similar phenomena .",
    "if more detailed theoretical investigation of the properties of residual collisions and the comparison of their predictions with our data will support our interpretation of the observed flare to be correct , then the delay time between gamma - ray and optical flare provides an independent way of determining the lorentz factor @xmath1 .",
    "moreover , further parameters of the blast wave can be determined , which were not constrained by observations so far , such as the distance of the residual collisions , the ratio of radiation to magnetic field energy ( via the ratio of inverse compton and synchrotron emission ) , and the ratio of kinetic to gamma - ray energy .",
    "this offers the hope to finally measure the energetics of gamma - ray bursts beyond the rare cases of calorimetry with radio observations .",
    "we are grateful to pierre cox , the iram director , for granting ddt time at the 30 m telescope , as well as to c. thum and s. leon ( also iram ) for getting the observations performed .",
    "this work is partly based on observations collected at the european southern observatory , chile under proposal eso no .",

    "<S> the delay of the flare relative to the grb , its spectral energy distribution as well as the ratio of pulse widths suggest it to arise from residual collisions in grb outflows @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> if this interpretation is correct and can be supported by more detailed modelling or observation in further grbs , the delay measurement provides an independent , determination of the lorentz factor @xmath1 of the outflow . </S>"
