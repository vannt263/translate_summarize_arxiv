    "@xmath5 models in two - dimensional euclidean space - time were introduced by golo and perelomov , see @xcite , with the goal of discussing self - dual @xmath6-instantons in a complex / kh@xmath7ler framework .",
    "these systems in minkowski @xmath8 space - time are a variant of the @xmath9 non - linear sigma model , which is constructed in turn as a restriction of the linear sigma model of gell - mann and levy @xcite to the dynamics of their goldstone bosons .",
    "several generalizations of the non - linear @xmath9-sigma model appeared as low energy effective theories in hadronic physics related to current algebras before the surge of non - abelian gauge theories in particle physics . in this work",
    "we shall focus in a model belonging to the family of gauged non - linear sigma models , see e.g. @xcite , which might be treated also in interaction with gravity , see @xcite , granting to this kind of systems a r@xmath10le in cosmology .    in particular , we shall concentrate in the simplest model studied in reference @xcite where we added to the action of the gauge @xmath1-model a potential energy density depending only on the fields and guaranteeing that both the scalar and vector particles are massive .",
    "moreover , we showed that in this model there are two species of bps vortices living respectively in the south and north charts .",
    "because our vortex solutions have cylindrical symmetry they can be interpreted as cosmic strings conveying by themselves cosmological implications if the model is defined in curved space - time , see _ inter alia _ the monographic textbook @xcite and references quoted therein .    besides of letting the system to live in the higgs phase ,",
    "our choice of the potential energy density is guided by the existence of a self - dual structure : first - order static field equations together with a topological bound .",
    "this structure arises at the critical point where the scalar and vector particle masses are equal and it is the requirement to build generalizations of these gauge non - linear sigma models with extended supersymmetry .",
    "in fact , in the disguise of @xmath6 instantons nitta and vinci discovered in @xcite the same topological defects in the framework of two - dimensional @xmath11 susy sigma model that we described within a purely bosonic context in @xcite .",
    "the promotion of the field theoretical model at the stake to a @xmath12 supersymmetric status is possible through an standard procedure using the k@xmath7hler structure of @xmath1 .    our goal in this essay",
    ", however , is to analyze thoroughly the bps vortex zero modes of the two species . despite of being in a higgs phase",
    "our model exhibits zero gap fluctuations around the bps vortices .",
    "in reference2 @xcite we developed this task in a fully detailed manner for the bps vortices in the abelian higgs model .",
    "the information that we acquired in this work was the key to the computations achieved in @xcite of the one - loop bps vortex string tension shifts in the ahm when these objects are immersed in the quantum world .",
    "we plan thus to establish the analogies and differences between the zero modes of fluctuation of the standard self - dual vortices and those of the two species of bps vortices in our gauged @xmath1 model . because zero modes provide a bridge between the classical and quantum domains we hope that the results obtained here will be useful in future research about quantum properties of the two species of bps @xmath1 vortices .",
    "we shall address a system of three scalar fields @xmath13 which take values on a @xmath14-sphere target space : @xmath15 we also denote @xmath16 and choose the metric tensor in @xmath8 as : @xmath17 .",
    "stereographic projections respectively from the north and south poles of the sphere to the plane lead to the south and north charts that form a minimal atlas in @xmath14 intersecting at the equator . in these two planes / charts",
    "we define the complex scalar fields @xmath18 distinguished by the superscripts @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "use of complex coordinates characterizes the target @xmath14-sphere as the complex manifold @xmath1 , i.e. , the complex projective line .",
    "the information coming from one of these charts is translated into the other one via the transition function @xmath21 that allows the global definition of the @xmath1 by prescribing how the two charts are related .",
    "we remark that our choice of transition function reverses the orientation of the north chart with respect to that of the south chart .",
    "the reason for choosing this option is to deal later with scalar fields coupled to the gauge field with identical electric charges in both charts .",

    "second , in the restricted second - order field equations one looks for solutions with this characteristics and appropriate boundary conditions , which force the quantization of the magnetic flux .",
