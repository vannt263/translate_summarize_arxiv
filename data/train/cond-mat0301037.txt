    "despite of the intensive research of the nature of high temperature ( ht ) superconductivity the questions about the pairing mechanism and about the nature and number of carriers remain open . today for the normal state at @xmath9 for underdoped ( ud ) high temperature superconductors ( ud htsc ) the two - component model of carriers",
    "can be considered as a firmly established fact : small polarons and holes are the heavy and light carriers respectively . here",
    "@xmath1 is the temperature of the transition to the pseudogap ( pg ) state in which @xmath4 plane are in stripe state . for normal state",
    "the measurements of optical conductivity for ud htsc @xcite- @xcite provided the first evidence for coexistence of these two carrier types . later from spin susceptibility measurements for @xmath10 the doping dependence of the part for each carrier type was determined @xcite , but the character of the polaron state ( it is the polaron or bipolaron ) was unclear .",
    "this question for cuprate htsc is of fundamental importance because the existence of jahn - teller ( jt ) small polarons for doped antiferromagnets ( af ) with large value of dielectric constant and mobile light oxygen ions @xcite namely was the initial point for htsc searches .",
    "upon doping the extra holes are localized on the transition metal ions that causes the change of their valence and leads to the strong jt distortions . at the doping increase",
    "the transition of af into metal occurs with two carrier types ( for example in @xmath11 @xcite ) , and the superconducting ( sc ) transition with enough high value of @xmath0 is in principle possible .",
    "really the surface superconductivity with @xmath12 recently was observed for @xmath13 doped by @xmath14 ions @xcite.\u0000    now it is clear that understanding of the pg state nature at \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 @xmath2 will provide a clue to ht superconductivity .",
    "this supposition is based on the following facts : 1 ) the change of the density of states starts at @xmath15 and continues on up to @xmath0 ; 2 ) at @xmath0 the coherent sc state is formed with practicably no effect on the density of states ; 3 ) there is a lot of evidence of an evolution of the sc fluctuations at @xmath2 ( see refs . in @xcite ) . in ref.@xcite under bose - einstein condensation theory the three component model of the pg state was proposed in which bipolarons were the third component of carriers .    in this paper",
    "the authors discussed a supposition that the pg and sc states in ud htsc result from dynamical dimension reduction when htsc behaves as if its dimensionality changes at the lowering of the temperature below @xmath1 . at",
    "that the transition to the pg state is the dimensional 3d @xmath6 2d crossover of charge motion . at @xmath16",
    "namely two - dimensionality leads to the crucial role of jt distortions in @xmath17 planes which bound up with holes and form delocalized jt polarons and the localized three spin polarons in @xmath17 planes .",
    "the chains of the latter form in @xmath17 planes a narrow stripes with distorted low temperature tetragonal - like lattice .",
    "this means that the dimensional crossover at @xmath18 leads to the charge ordering in @xmath17 planes , and removes the competition between pairing of carriers and their localization on the jt distortions . at @xmath3 the `` hole - jt polaron '' pairing occurs which are zero - dimensional ( 0d ) sc fluctuations . at @xmath19 a sequence of two crossovers of the sc fluctuations",
    "occurs : the first is the crossover 0d@xmath202d , and second is the crossover 2d@xmath203d that leads to three- dimensional sc transition .",
    "for ud htsc incoherent interlayer tunnelling the charge transfer along @xmath21 axis is the result of the thermal fluctuations at @xmath22 here @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the interlayer hopping rates of the charges , @xmath25 is the boltzman constant . at the temperature decreasing @xmath26 thermal fluctuations limit out the interlayer tunnelling .",
    "this leads to the dimensional crossover 3d@xmath202d of charges motion when at the temperature @xmath27 the charges in @xmath17 plane moves as two - dimensional ones .",
    "this means that the transition to the pg state is the result of dynamical dimensional reduction .",
    "lowering of dimensionality leads to the crucial role of any disorder and to the changes of character of the sc fluctuations .",
    "one in the first attempts to consider in a self - consistent way the competition between pairing of the carriers and their localization on the defects were made in works @xcite-@xcite . at @xmath16 for underdoped cuprate htsc",
    "two - dimensionality leads to the crucial role of jt distortions around two adjacent @xmath28 ions which bound up holes @xcite -@xcite , and form the quasilocal states ( delocalized jt polarons ) and local states ( the localized three spin polarons @xcite , or ferrons @xcite ) .",
    "mobile delocalized jt polaron is the quasilocal state of hole bounded up with complex of two adjacent distorted by jt interactions `` squares '' @xmath29 with common oxygen ion , and @xmath30 phonon normal mode leads to the oscillations of `` squares '' ( see fig .",
    "total spin of jt polaron is equal 1/2 , and spins of two @xmath31 ions are antiparallel . in @xmath17 plane",
    "these jt polarons form wide @xmath32 stripes with nearly undistorted low temperature orthorhombic - like lattice @xcite .",
    "the studying ferromagnetic self - trapped states of a charge carriers in a doped af crystal was began in 1968 by nagaev ( see refs.in @xcite ) .",
    "later this type of states has been proposed by emery and reiter , and at first it was observed and named `` the three spin polaron '' by kochelaev et al .",
    "( @xcite , and refs . there ) .",
    "electron - paramagnetic resonance ( epr ) measurements provide experimental evidence of the existence of the three spin polarons and the presence of dynamical jt distortions with normal modes @xmath33 and @xmath34 , which have tetragonal symmetry and lead to exchange spin - phonon interaction similar to the dzyaloshinskii - morya interaction @xcite @xmath35\\cdot \\exp(izq')[(s^{y}_k s^{z}_{k - q } -\\ ] ]    @xmath36,\\ ] ]    where @xmath37 is the exchange antiferrognetic coupling constant , @xmath38 is spin - orbit coupling constant , @xmath39 is an average splitting between energy levels , @xmath40 is a two dimensional fourier s transforms a component of the spin operator , @xmath41 and @xmath42 are projections of three dimensional wave vector on the @xmath17 plane and @xmath21-axis respectively , and @xmath43 is electron - phonon coupling constant .",
    "this small interaction can not pin the three spin polaron in 3d system but at @xmath16 for 2d system local state exists at any values of the interactions in the frame of i.m.lifshits theory @xcite .",
    "the isotope effect on the epr linewidth ( it doubles ) upon substitution @xmath44 quantitatively adjusts with exchange spin - phonon interaction assistance in ( 4 ) , and can be indirect evidence of 2d nature of the pg state : @xmath45=110 k , and @xmath46=180 k ( @xcite and refs . there ) .",
    "the three spin polaron with parallel spins of two adjacent @xmath31 ions and with total spin 1/2 is localized state of a hole bounded up with two distorted `` squares '' @xmath47 with common oxygen ion ( see fig.1b ) .",
    "their chains form in @xmath17 plane narrow stripes with distorted low temperature tetragonal - like lattice ( d stripes @xcite-@xcite ) . thus in spite of localization of the carriers part on dynamical jt distortions with normal modes @xmath33 and @xmath34 , charge ordering in @xmath17 plane removes the competition between pairing of carriers and their localization on the jt distortions .",
    "for ud htsc the coexisting at @xmath9 of polarons and holes stimulated the interest to the studying the possibility of their pairing , but at that the mechanism of the suppression of on - site coulomb repulsion @xmath48 for two particles is the main problem for htsc . in",
    "refs.@xcite-@xcite the possibility of such pairing was shown .",
    "kudinov @xcite at the first shows the principal possibility of on - site attraction of polaron and hole .",
    "his conclusion is based on the following results : ( i ) polarons lead to the band narrowing and to the polaron shift of the energy @xmath49 ( here @xmath50 is the constant of jt interactions of holes with mobile oxygen ions , m is the effective mass of jt mode ) ; ( ii ) at @xmath51 both as the compensation of coulomb repulsion , and so the on - site attraction between the hole and polaron take place .    in refs .",
    "@xcite-@xcite the zhang - rice polarons @xcite were taken into account which have total spin equal zero , and their pairing with holes can not lead to the local pairs . but kudinov model easily generalizes for jt polarons with spin equal 1/2 ( see fig .",
    "1a ) , if after canonical holstein - lang - firsov transformations @xmath52 , in hamiltonian all two - particle renormalizated interactions are taking into account ( between holes , between jt polarons , as well between the hole and jt polaron ) : @xmath53 + a^{+}_{m,\\sigma}b_{m+g,\\sigma}|.\\ ] ]    here @xmath54 is non - renormalizated interaction constant between holes , @xmath55 , @xmath56 is elastic constant of jt normal mode , operators @xmath57 , and @xmath58 create the hole and jt polaron on site @xmath59 , respectively , and @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the impulse and equilibrium coordinate of the common oxygen ion for two adjacent `` squares '' @xmath62 .",
    "one can see that strong jt interactions lead to different renormalization of all two - particle interactions . at @xmath63 @xcite generalized kudinov s habbarg hamiltonian",
    "is equal @xmath64 where @xmath65 .",
    "all many particles interactions are exponential renormalizated that leads to the small contribution of bipolarons in the energy relatively with the contribution of the on - site `` hole- jt polaron '' pairs ( because former contribution has exponential dependence on the distance between two jt polarons @xcite ) .",
    "as it shown by kudinov in bcs model the pairing hole and jt polaron leads to the possibility of the sc transition in @xmath4 plane with the temperature @xmath66 . at that the local pair `` hole - jt polaron '' occupies the of jt polaron complex , and has coherent length @xmath67 ( @xmath68 is the mean distance between @xmath69 and @xmath70 ions in @xmath4 plane ) .",
    "thus , the dimensional crossover at @xmath1 leads to the charge ordering in @xmath4 plane and removes the competition between pairing of the carriers and their localization on the jt distortions . for cuprate",
    "htsc the coexistence at @xmath16 of holes and jt polarons is fundamentally important but decisive role belong to the latter .",
    "jt polarons lead to polaron shift of the energy , and to the compensation of on - site coulomb repulsion between jt polaron and hole in @xmath17 planes .",
    "this leads at @xmath3 to the local pairing of jt polarons and holes , i.e. to zero - dimensional ( 0d ) sc fluctuations @xcite- @xcite .",
    "the temperature lowering leads to the increasing of the coherent length @xmath71 , so that at enough big @xmath72 local pairs begin overlap , and at @xmath73 the dimensional crossovers 0d@xmath62d of the sc fluctuations occurs .",
    "second crossover 2d@xmath63d of the sc fluctuations occurs at @xmath74 @xcite- @xcite .",
    "the transition to the 2d sc fluctuations with the temperature dependence of the coherent length @xmath75 leads to the semiconducting dependence of the @xmath21-axis resistivity with the probability of the charge transfer which is depending on the temperature @xcite , @xcite : @xmath76    where @xmath77 is berezinskii - kostelits - thouless temperature ( bkt ) of the 2d sc transition for the isolated @xmath4 plane , and @xmath78 and @xmath72 are the values of the coherent lengths at @xmath79 . at sufficiently small @xmath80 the kats inequality",
    "@xcite @xmath81 determines the temperature of the sc transition which occurs as two dimensional one with small region of the 3d sc fluctuations ( here @xmath82 is fermi energy ) @xmath83 for example , from the analysis of the resistivity measurements in single crystal bi-2212 with @xmath84 @xcite it follows that the region of the ( 0d+2d ) sc fluctuations @xmath85 , and the region of the 3d sc fluctuations @xmath86 , and @xmath87 .    at the analysis of the sc state in @xcite",
    "it was shown that at @xmath88 the coherence length @xmath89 becomes less than the interlayer distance .",
    "this means that once more dynamical dimension reduction occurs at which the 3d sc state changes into the 2d sc state .",
    "the boundary of the region of `` three - dimensionality '' of the sc state can be determined as the temperature at which the two universal temperature dependencies of the ratio of the squares of the penetration depths of a magnetic field directed along @xmath21 axis,@xmath90 , are crossing : one is determined by the 3d sc fluctuations in the bcs theory @xmath91 and another is universal dependence for the 2d degenerate system @xmath92    the temperature interval of `` three - dimensionality '' of the sc state occupies only two temperature regions , @xmath93 near @xmath0 , and @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the temperature of the transition into spin cluster glass sc state ( state ( 2 + 3 ) on fig.2)@xcite .",
    "for example , @xmath96 for @xmath97 , and region of `` three - dimensionality '' of the sc and pg states near @xmath0 is equal @xmath98 @xcite . for ud htsc",
    "last dimensional reduction occurs at temperature @xmath99 when the 2d sc state changes on 3d spin cluster glass sc state @xcite , and the values of @xmath100 .",
    "thus , for ud htsc the sc transition has two - dimensional character ( according to the kats definition @xcite ) with limited total region of `` three - dimensionality '' of the sc and pg states .",
    "the peculiarities of normal , the pg and sc states can be understood taking into account the effect of dynamical dimension reduction under cooling when htsc behaves as if its dimensionality repeatedly changes at @xmath101 ( fig.2 ) . at",
    "that the pg transition is a transition to 2d carriers motion at @xmath1 , and the sc transition occurs as a sequence of dimensional crossovers of the sc fluctuations .",
    "for ud htsc at dimensional crossovers of the sc fluctuations holes number @xmath102 and polaron number @xmath103 @xcite , are decreasing that is according with the observation of the noticeably change of the density of states at @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "for example , at the hall effect measurements for @xmath104 was found out that @xmath102 decreases at lowering the temperature from @xmath105 up to @xmath106 @xcite : @xmath107 .    for ht superconductivity",
    "the conclusion about the decisive role of `` hole - jt polaron '' pairing qualitatively comes to an agreement with the doping dependence of the part of each carriers type relatively of total carriers number : in ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath10 it was shown that the value of @xmath108 ( at``hole - jt polaron '' pairing @xmath109 ) at the hole concentration @xmath110 on ion @xmath31 when @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "the temperature dependence of the resistivity also evidences about the coexistence of carriers and local pairs `` hole - jt polaron '' in the pg state @xcite- @xcite , @xcite.the studying fluctuational in - plane conductivity @xcite shown that the interactions of fluctuational pairs with the carriers are weak , and the contributions into conductivity of the 0d , 2d and 3d sc fluctuations are been identified .",
    "the measurements of optical conductivity are the convincing evidence of `` hole- jt polaron '' pairing where it is shown that at @xmath16 the @xmath21-axis component of electronic kinetic energy and carriers mass double @xcite .",

    "the doublet structure of two - magnon absorption band for the sc state is an indirect evidence of @xmath131-wave symmetry of the sc order parameter for ud htsc as well : at @xmath132 some part of unpaired polaron @xmath133 percolates through the direction of wave vector where the order parameter is equal zero .",

    "the existence of the pseudogap at @xmath135 means that there are a part of unpaired carriers which in the sc state moves only in @xmath17 plane , and we above see that jt polarons are these unpaired carriers .",
    "for verification of various htsc scenarios it is very important to know the right answer on the question : is the pg state at the temperature @xmath2 a precursor of the sc state or not .",
    "the problems of the decision of this question is connected with non - three - dimensional character of the sc fluctuations for the part of fluctuational interval @xmath136 where pairing amplitude is non - zero , but phase rigidity is lost .",
    "this means that at @xmath137 the standard measurements which are depending on phase rigidity ( such as andreev reflection or insufficiently high magnetic field ) can not be sensitive to the sc fluctuations with non - zero pairing amplitude , but without phase rigidity .",
    "for example , the studying of the dependence of the fluctuations at @xmath137 under sufficiently high ( up to 33 t ) magnetic field h// @xmath21-axis can give the decisive answer on this question .",
