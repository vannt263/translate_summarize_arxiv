    "the discovery of quantum hall effect in 1980  @xcite has ushered in a new era of quantum states of non - interacting electrons , distinguished by non - trivial topological invariant . subsequently , haldane s proposal@xcite of quantum hall effect with synthetic gauge field in a honeycomb lattice gave an important clue on how a specific lattice structure can give rise to non - trivial band topologies .",
    "there are various mechanism by which the momentum - space mapping of the hamiltonian with specific crystal symmetry , orbital symmetry , and/or spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) results in an irreducible su(2 ) representation of the dirac or weyl hamiltonian , garnering a large class of dirac and weyl materials .",
    "@xcite in bipartite lattices , such as in the so - called su - schrieffer - heeger model,@xcite or in honeycomb lattice,@xcite the hopping between inequivalent lattice sites carries a net bloch phase @xmath3 .",
    "this acts as a momentum - space gauge field , in analogy with the wilson loop formula for a magnetic field which , in special cases , is associated with an integer phase winding number @xmath4 a non - trivial topological invariant .",
    "again , electron hopping between even and odd parity orbitals ( such as @xmath5- and @xmath6-orbitals ) often results in a net hopping @xmath7 , giving a linear orbital - momentum locking.@xcite as orbital texture inversion occurs at discrete @xmath0-points , these points act as monopoles in the momentum - space , giving rise to dirac or weyl cones .",
    "furthermore , soc provides a common origin to a variety of quantum hall and topological classes of materials.@xcite in all these examples , the spinor of the su(2 ) representation ( or its generation to a su(2@xmath8 ) version , where @xmath8 is integer ) comprises of two chiral species originating from the momentum locking with two sublattices , or two orbitals , or spin-1/2 particles . as a chiral object forms an orbit , surrounding an external magnetic field , or momentum space berry curvature , it produces a non - zero flux , which is quantified by the winding number or chern number ( topological invariants ) .",
    "encouraged by the tremendous success of material realization and engineering of the su(2 ) based topological materials,@xcite we explore the possibility of designing a lattice model with su(3 ) symmetry .",
    "su(3 ) flavor symmetry was originally proposed in the quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) field for systems with three basis vectors ( namely , colors ) which can be expanded in the basis of eight @xmath9 gell - mann matrices @xmath10 .",
    "@xcite the non - abelian theory of the su(3 ) groups predicts several elementary excitations such as quark , and gluons .",
    "prediction of emergent su(3 ) symmetry in condensed matter systems is rather limited,@xcite and no physical system or optical lattice is realized to date with such properties . in a recent work",
    ", it is shown that a soc generated in a square optical lattice in the presence of a spatially homogeneous su(3 ) gauge field can give rise to non - trivial topological characteristics  @xcite .",
    "this can be experimentally realized with ultra - cold atoms having internal spin degrees of freedom or any such three component hamiltonian .",
    "an explicit topology - engineering scheme in a three band model has been discussed in another recent work  @xcite , where the generation of arbitrary chern number is based on the equivalence of the topological number of a given band on the monopole charge , and can be extended to higher chern number derivatives .",
    "the feasibility of the materials realization of the corresponding models has not been discussed in these papers .    the basic principles for su(3 )",
    "symmetric ti follows that of the su(2 ) counterpart . a momentum representation of the su(3 ) hamiltonian incipiently demands the entanglement of a three components quantum state via some sort of intrinsic gauge field .",
    "we start with a generalized form of the su(3 ) hamiltonian @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the eight components vector made of electron hoppings in a lattice .",
    "the momentum - space magnetic field ( berry curvature ) can thus be expressed in ( 2 + 1 ) dimension,@xcite @xmath13 where indices @xmath14 , @xmath15 = @xmath16 , and @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 give the components of the @xmath20-vector .",
    "@xmath21 is the usual levi - civita tensor .",
    ".   implies that chiral orbits or vortices are formed in all three bands , with their centers located at @xmath22 , where the berry curvature @xmath23 obtains singularity .",
    "the flux of @xmath24 through the first brillouin zone for each band is quantized , and is quantified by the associated chern number .",
    "therefore , the chern number essentially dictates the number of orbit centers , while its sign corresponds to the direction of associated phase winding or chirality . without any external magnetic field , the total chern number for",
    "all bands must vanish .",
    "this implies that the chirality of one of the su(3 ) component must be opposite to the other two components , and also the associated chern number ( or @xmath25space monopoles ) , say , @xmath26 must be equal to the total chern number from the other two chiral states , i.e. @xmath27 .",
    "in the case of @xmath28 , the other two bands give @xmath29 which mimics the quantum spin - hall system for spinful systems.@xcite    the above - mentioned features can also be understood simply by the corresponding band topology .",
    "the center of orbits at @xmath30-points are those discrete points where band degeneracy occurs .",
    "therefore , the number of vortices dictate the number of band inversions in two dimensions ( 2d ) . in su(2 ) topological systems , the odd number of band inversions ( at the time - reversal momenta , if this symmetry is present ) between two basis components gives a finite chern number or @xmath31 invariant .",
    "for su(3 ) systems , the band inversion must happen between all three bands , or at least , the band with the highest chern number ( @xmath26 ) must undergo inversion with _ both _ the other two bands .",
    "the other two bands do not necessarily undergo a band inversion between them unless their chern numbers are also different .",
    "this is an important distinction of the su(3 ) framework .",
    "another unique requirement of the su(3 ) topological state is that here not only a gauge field is required to be present in the off - diagonal term of the hamiltonian ( as in su(2 ) case ) , but _",
    "an odd parity zeeman - like term , i.e. @xmath32 term must also be present between any two basis_. such an odd parity onsite zeeman - like term does not arise naturally from bloch phase or from conventional soc .    , @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "@xmath35 denotes the direction of the vector potential of the electromagnetic ( em ) wave , which causes the different peierls phase coupling for the different orbitals .",
    "the hopping amplitudes are multiples of @xmath36 and @xmath37 , and are different for the different components ( orbitals ) .",
    "also , @xmath38 in the present model . ]    a focal point of our work is to construct a lattice model which inherits the required suitable gauge fields , and odd - parity zeeman term , and thus intrinsically performs as topological material distinguished by finite chern number .",
    "we present a model hamiltonian of a spinless su(3 ) topological system in a tripartite lattice with three inequivalent lattice sites .",
    "each sublattice is sitting in distinct 1d chains , and they are coupled by nearest - neighbor quantum tunneling , as shown in fig .  1 .",
    "this would naturally give an uncompensated bloch phase for all three inter - site hoppings as : @xmath39 , @xmath40 , while the third one is naturally reversed to @xmath41 , where @xmath42 are distances between @xmath43 and @xmath44 sublattice .",
    "this naturally enforces opposite chirality between any two band in a given parameter space . finally , for the generation of the odd parity ` onsite ' matrix - element , we propose to utilize the light - matter interaction with site - selective photon polarization .",
    "we show with a modified tight - binding model in a tripartite lattice that the dipole interaction term @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the vector potential of the photon , naturally leads to a @xmath47 term ( where @xmath48 is the unit vector along the polarization direction , and @xmath49 is a tunable parameter ) . then by tuning the direction of the polarization parallel or orthogonal to @xmath50 ( or with other methods as discussed later )",
    ", one can selectively generate , reverse , and destroy this term in different sublattices .",
    "this way , we can generate odd - parity zeeman term by using opposite polarization in lattice sites 1 and 2 , while it is destroyed in the 3rd site , as shown in fig .  1 .",
    "this generates our su(3 ) topological system , which we characterize by the detailed analysis of the berry curvature , chern number , and edge states .",
    "we also discuss two realizable setup to obtain site - selective polarization with existing tools .",

    "[ conclusion ] .",
    "we design a su(3 ) hamiltonian with on eye on finite chern number in a bottom - up approach .",
    "a generic hamiltonian , obeying the su(3 ) decomposition , can be written as , [ su3_gellmann ] ( * k*)=a(*k*)_3+*b*(*k * ) , where @xmath51 is a 3@xmath523 identity matrix , @xmath53 are the su(3 ) generators ( gell - mann matrices ) , and @xmath54 , @xmath55 are the corresponding coefficients .",
    "the explicit matrix form of the hamiltonian ( the @xmath0- dependencies in @xmath56 and @xmath57 are implied ) is , [ gensu3 ] ( * k*)=    a+b_3 + & b_1-ib_2 & b_4-i b_5 + b_1+i b_2 & a - b_3 + & b_6-i b_7 + b_4+i b_5 & b_6+i b_7 & a- +    .",
    "we work with a three component spinor @xmath58 , where @xmath59 are the basis representing different orbitals , or sublattices , and so on ( but we do not consider spin here ) .",
    "each @xmath57 term requires special treatment such that opposite chirality , and odd - parity zeeman term can be simultaneously achieved in such a way that berry curvature singularities at discrete @xmath0-points can be attained .",
    "we start with the diagonal terms of eq .  .",
    "we denote the three onsite , intra - basis , dispersions as @xmath60 where @xmath61 . in general tight - binding hamiltonians ,",
    "diagonal terms comprise of cosine functions of momentum , and chemical potential .",
    "the sine term of the bloch phase is associated with imaginary ` i ' which can not appear in the diagonal term for it to be a hermitian one .",
    "it drops out even in centrosymmetric lattices as the same hopping on both positive and negative directions are added . with the analysis of berry curvature and su(3 ) symmetry , we recognize that an essential requirement for non - zero chern number in this case is that the diagonal terms @xmath62 and @xmath63 must contain @xmath64 terms , which is equivalent to having odd - parity zeeman term . without specifying the origin at this point , we start with a combination of three diagonal terms in a 1d lattice : [ diagonal ] _ i(*k * ) & = & t_i+ m_i- , where @xmath65 , @xmath66 are the expansion parameters , and @xmath17 is the chemical potential . @xmath67 and @xmath49 are arbitrary parameters depending on the crystal structure and lattice constants .",
    "finite chern number arises for a set of parameters as @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 , and @xmath72 .",
    "the cosine terms arise from the nearest neighbor hopping along the @xmath73-direction . in sec .",
    "[ sec : epcoupling ] below , we discuss how to obtain @xmath74 term with the help of light - matter interaction in which we find that @xmath66 depends on both @xmath65 as well as the vector potential @xmath75 .",
    "thus its sign can be simultaneously reversed by using antiparallel photon polarization .",
    "we notice that all three diagonal terms are taken to depend only on @xmath76 which is consistent with the setup drawn in fig .  1 .",
    "by comparing eqs .   and",
    ", we obtain [ ab3b8 ] a(*k * ) & = & = ( -3 + 2 ( m_1 + m_3 ) ) , + b_3(*k * ) & = & = ( -7 k_y + 2 m_1 k_y ) , + b_8(*k * ) & = & + & = & ( 3 k_y + 2(m_1 - 2 m_3 ) k_y ) , looking at the hamiltonian in eq .  , we notice that @xmath54 gives a overall shift to all the bands and thus does not play any specific role on the topology .",
    "@xmath77 gives an anisotropic zeeman splitting between 1st and 2nd basis in the hamiltonian , while @xmath78 gives a similar splitting of the 3rd basis from the other two ones .",
    "it is easy to see that the band inversion along the @xmath76 direction is driven by @xmath79 and @xmath80 terms . and also",
    ", since the eigenvalues are proportional to @xmath79 and @xmath80 , we see that the bands become anisotropic between @xmath81 . on the other hand , along the @xmath82 direction they are symmetric , since the eigenvalues depend on the absolute value of the other @xmath83 terms .",
    "this asymmetry also reflects in the berry curvature maps shown in fig .",
    "[ 3dbren ] .",
    "next we consider the three off - diagonal terms which follow a general form @xmath84 , where @xmath85 , @xmath86 . in condensed matter systems ,",
    "such a complex term usually has two origins : ( 1 ) rashba- or dresselhaus - type spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) , ( 2 ) bloch phase from nearest neighbor electron s hopping .",
    "( 1 ) rashba and dressenhaus soc yields @xmath87 , and @xmath88 ( where @xmath89 is the soc strength ) .",
    "soc is however difficult to achieve for all three su(3 ) spins in both condensed matter and optical lattice setups .",
    "more importantly , we find that the computation of chern number with soc in the off - diagonal terms often gives zero chern number .",
    "therefore , we focus on the possibility ( 2 ) . assigning @xmath90 , and @xmath91 ( where @xmath36 is a parameter which can be different for different @xmath18 and @xmath92 ) , we see that this term simplifies to @xmath93 .",
    "this is just a bloch phase associated with the nearest - neighbor hopping between different sublattices ( since it appears in the off - diagonal term in the hamiltonian ) .",
    "we also find that for finite chern number , _ the bloch phase must be reversed in at least one of the off - diagonal terms , compared to the other two . _      based on the constraints for both diagonal and off - diagonal terms , we now seek a minimal model for the realization of su(3 ) chern insulator in the spinless basis : @xmath94 where @xmath36 is the nearest neighbor tight - binding hopping parameter between different basis . without loosing generality , we set @xmath95=1 .",
    "this gives all eight components of the @xmath20 vector to be : @xmath96 .",
    "\\end{split}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      next we discuss how to obtain such a hamiltonian with realistic crystal structure and orbital symmetry .",
    "the phase dependent off - diagonal term @xmath97 , and the zeeman term @xmath98 term can be simultaneously obtained in a tripartite lattice by applying linearly polarized light on each sublattices . at the end of this section ,",
    "we discuss how to design such a lattice .",
    "the motivation for the origin of @xmath100 term can be drawn from the fact that the dipole interaction between an electron with momentum @xmath101 and an em wave with potential @xmath102 ( @xmath103 is the light polarization ) is @xmath104 .",
    "we choose a linearly polarized light with its polarization oriented along the @xmath73-direction . we take a single electron hamiltonian under the periodic potential @xmath105 of the lattice as @xmath106 .",
    "the corresponding bloch wavefunction is @xmath107 , where @xmath8 is the total number of unit cells , @xmath108 is the wannier state at the @xmath109 site located at @xmath110 . in the presence of vector potential @xmath46 ,",
    "the hamiltonian becomes @xmath111 .",
    "for the em wave , the spatial dependence of @xmath46 can be neglected , and thus , the translational symmetry of the lattice remains the same .",
    "therefore , the new bloch wavecfunction simply changes to @xmath112 , where @xmath113 .",
    "@xmath114 is called the peierls phase at @xmath115 acquired by the charged particle in traversing from the @xmath109 lattice site .",
    "it can be shown that @xmath116 . using these ingredients",

    "@xmath117 is the tb hopping amplitude between @xmath15 and @xmath118 sites _ without _ the vector potential .",
    "we here restrict ourselves to the nearest neighbor hopping , i.e. , @xmath119 . let the lattice constant along the @xmath73-direction be @xmath120 . by setting @xmath121 , and @xmath122 ,",

    "then we see that eq .",
    "is the same as eq .  .",
    "from this definition , it is easy to see that as the direction of polarization is reversed , @xmath126 , and thus @xmath127 , @xmath128 while the perpendicular polarization yields @xmath129 , and @xmath37 remains the same .      for the su(2 ) case , the phase dependent hopping term @xmath130 is obtained in bipartite lattice ( c.f .",

    "[ model ] . also note that , the complex hopping term only includes @xmath82 terms , implying that different basis elements should be aligned along the @xmath131-direction only .",
    "therefore , we consider three chains of different species which are connected via quantum tunneling in both directions .",
    "we assume periodic boundary conditions along both directions .",
    "the nearest neighbor hoppings along the @xmath132direction between basis @xmath133 , and @xmath134 give the same momentum dependence @xmath135 , while that for @xmath136 is @xmath137 ( we set the corresponding hopping amplitudes as @xmath138 and @xmath139 ) .",
    "this reversal of bloch phase serves the purpose of chirality inversion along this direction .",
    "caution should be taken when the next - nearest hopping term becomes turned on , whose @xmath0-dependence is given by @xmath140 , respectively .",
    "such term adiabatically destroys the integer chern number .",
    "therefore , to avoid it we propose to increase the inter - atomic distance between adjacent chains to be as large as possible so that the hopping term @xmath141 .",
    "this setup simultaneously produces a @xmath142 term for the intra - basis dispersions in eq .   due to nearest neighbor hopping .",
    "this creates a linear polarization that rotates in space ( at @xmath143 polarization is along @xmath144 , at @xmath145 and @xmath146 polarization along @xmath147 and @xmath148 , respectively ) .",
    "atoms are trapped at these @xmath131-values to create the necessary odd parity zeeman term .",
    "b ) a linearly polarized em wave along @xmath144 is incident on the atom trapped in the 1st atomic chain .",
    "a polarizer plate , placed between the 1st and 2nd wires , rotates the polarization vector by @xmath149 . the em wave in the 2nd wire is then polarized along @xmath147 . another polarizer plate , between the wires with the 2nd and the 3rd atom , rotates the incident polarization vector @xmath147 by @xmath149 again , and the polarization vector along the 3rd wire is along @xmath148 . two quarter - wave polarizer or one half - wave polarizer plates are need to be placed between the 3rd and 4th wire ( site index 1 as periodicity is imposed ) to rotate the polarization vector from @xmath148 to @xmath144 .",
    "this generates the desired polarization gradient in our lattice grid structure . ]    for all the above terms , no constraint arose about the specific parity ( or orbital symmetry ) of each basis .",

    "we suggest two practical experimental setups for the engineering of this phenomenon .",
    "of course , the possibilities are abundance .    _",
    "( a ) sisyphus cooling:- _ sisyhus cooling technique provides a spatial modulation of the static polarization .",

    "the atomic de broglie wavelength becomes comparable to the cooling laser wavelength ( though still shorter than is required for the bec phase transition ) and hence to the extent of the potential wells .",
    "it is therefore no longer possible to localize the atomic wave packet in the potential wells , even if they were deeper than the photon recoil energy .",

    "we visualize the three orbital characters ( in different row ) for three different bands ( in different column ) in the entire 2d @xmath0-space in fig .",
    "[ supp_band ] .",
    "as discussed in the introduction section , band inversion is an important criterion for both the su(2 ) and su(3 ) topological classes . in time - reversal invariant su(2 ) topological classes , bands are only required to be inverted at the time - reversal invariant @xmath0-points .",
    "this makes it easier to define the band inversion strength simply by defining the band gap between the two bands at the time - reversal invariant @xmath0-points.@xcite such simple definition becomes difficult to implement for su(3 ) materials . on the other hand , we recognize that the berry curvature acquires spike at the discrete band degenerate @xmath0-points ( @xmath0-space monopoles ) across which bands are inverted in two orthogonal directions ( the two orthogonal directions do not necessarily have to be along the @xmath82- and @xmath76-directions ) . in this spirit we can define a band inversion strength via occupation number or the ` orbital weight ' ( here orbital refers to the su(3 ) components ) of the band at each @xmath0-points .",
    "another interesting feature of the monopole is that it represents a saddle point in the orbital weight ( see fig .",
    "[ supp_band ] ) , in the sense that if an orbital character obtains a maximum along the @xmath82 direction , it obtains a minimum in the @xmath76 direction .",
    "the rightmost column of fig .",
    "[ supp_band ] refers to the @xmath0-resolved berry curvature .",
    "we see that at all the @xmath30-points where @xmath24 diverges in a given band , the corresponding orbital weight profile exhibits a saddle point .",
    "let us define a quantity @xmath181 $ ] , where @xmath182 is the eigenfunction of the hamiltonian in eq .",

    "its minimum would corresponds to @xmath187 .",
    "therefore , the locus of the monopole is defined by the discrete points which satisfy @xmath188 .",
    "this is of course an indication of the location of finite berry curvature .",
    "a singularity in @xmath189 is obtained where the bands are fully degenerate .    for the higher energy band , among the six visible saddle - points ,",
    "three of them reside in the @xmath190 region .",
    "they give three negative spikes in the berry curvatures , as shown in the corresponding rightmost column of fig .",
    "( the two extreme peaks occurring at the zone boundary are related by reciprocal lattice vectors ) .",
    "this gives the corresponding chern number @xmath191 ( where @xmath15 stands for bands ) to be -3 . in this band",
    ", inversion occurs between orbitals 1 and 3 across the three saddle points . in the lowest band ,",
    "the berry curvature peaks occur in the corresponding @xmath192 side due to the band inversions between orbitals 2 and 3 .",
    "the chern number of this band comes out to be the same as -3 .",
    "the middle band shows band inversions between all three orbitals at the same locations in both @xmath81 sides , with positive berry curvatures and thus obtains a chern number of @xmath193 .",
    "it can also be shown that the chern number does not depend if the strength of the pierels phase is different in the different orbitals . as long as the @xmath100 terms have opposite signs in the diagonal terms ( i.e. mimicking a zeeman - like term )",

    "changing the off - diagonal elements , say from @xmath194 to @xmath195 , we find higher chern number @xmath196 . in the appendix below , we discuss several other parameter sets where chern number can be tuned by different values of @xmath67 , @xmath49 , and other terms in the hamiltonian .",

    "[ edgestate ] with the same parameter set .",
    "the essence of the topological edge state is that it must adiabatically connect to the bulk states which is clearly observed in the present case . owing to the maximum chern number of 6 , there are 6 edge states also ( red lines ) . edge states with opposite dispersion , connecting to different bulk bands with opposite sign of the chern number , meet at discrete @xmath30-points where the berry curvature obtained singularities in fig .",
    "[ supp_band ]",
    ". consistently , there are total of 6 such band touching points for the edge states .",
    "we see that @xmath204 term is diagonal in this basis which gives the dispersion along the @xmath76 direction .",
    "these states become gapped by @xmath205 .",
    "however as the number of lattice site is increased , the gap at the edge state vanishes at the @xmath76-points where berry phase acquires divergence .",
    "therefore , expanding the edge state near these points , we find that three eigenstates up to linear - in-@xmath76 as ( substituting @xmath206 ) @xmath207 we notice that the second term represents a localized bound state ( soliton ) , while the other two bands are linear with @xmath76 in the low - energy region .",
    "as @xmath205 term is turned on , these three states spit into six states , in accordance with the higher chern number in the bulk state .",
    "in our model , su(3 ) symmetry is obtained for spinless fermions , in which spin of the particles is a dummy variable .",
    "this hamiltonian respects the spin - rotational symmetry .",
    "therefore , as long as this symmetry is held ( in the absence of spin orbit coupling or magnetic moment ) , the topological invariant remains the same for all values of spin in a given system , that means for both fermionic and bosonic systems .",
    "we now discuss how the result changes when the spin rotational symmetry is broken . for generality , we assume the atoms / electrons have a spin value @xmath208 , which splits into 2@xmath208 + 1 multiplets once the rotational symmetry is lifted . in this case , our starting su(3 ) spinor has the dimension of 3(2@xmath208 + 1 ) . for illustration",
    "we take @xmath209 , while the obtained conclusions below remain the same for any other values of @xmath208 . in this case , the spinor is @xmath210 , in which the hamiltonian becomes a @xmath211 matrix .",
    "the hamiltonian can be split into two @xmath9 diagonal blocks as @xmath212 , and @xmath213 , and off diagonal blocks @xmath214 , and @xmath215 . in the absence of the spin - flip terms ,",
    "i.e. , when @xmath216 at all momentum , the hamiltonian breaks into a block diagonal one . as the time - reversal symmetry is broken by introducing an exchange term @xmath217 , the block diagonal terms become @xmath218 , where @xmath219 is given in eq .   above . note that chern number does not depend on an overall energy shift ( @xmath220 term in eq .",
    "[ su3_gellmann ] ) .",
    "therefore , the system remains topologically non - trivial .",
    "if the exchange energy @xmath217 is increased beyond the band gap ( determined by @xmath79 and @xmath80 terms ) , it can introduce new band inversion .",
    "depending on the nature of the band inversion , the system can obtain either higher or lower chern number ( a topological phase transition ) .    in",
    "what follows , as long as a simple exchange field is present to split the spin states , such as magnetic field or ising like ferromagnetic state , the system maintains its topological property .",
    "we have also checked that when the exchange energy is taken to be orbital dependent ( breaking parity ) , the system continues to obtain the same chern number untill a new band inversion occurs . when the spin - flip term @xmath214 is introduced for the case of spin - orbit coupling or antiferromagnetism ,",
    "spin is no longer a good quantum number . in this case",
    ", chern number can not be defined for each spin state of band .",
    "therefore , there will be a topological phase transition into either a trivial case , or to another topological class , such as @xmath31 family for fermions .",
    "we discuss one such possibility using ising spin - orbit coupling .",
    "recently , there is a number of transitional metal dichalcogenide materials synthesized in isolated monolayers which have buckled honeycomb lattice structure .",
    "the buckled structure looses inversion symmetry in all three directions .",
    "this causes a large out - of - plane spin polarization , similar to ising spin which then becomes locked to the only one momentum component via soc .",
    "the corresponding soc component , as known by ising soc , is expressed by @xmath221 , where @xmath222 is the soc strength and @xmath159-axis is chosen as the easy axis of the ising spins . for a buckled honeycomb lattice",
    ", it is shown that the momentum dependent term comes out to be@xcite @xmath223 .",
    "this term essentially gives an odd - parity ( along @xmath76 ) zeeman - like term .",
    "to go from a su(2 ) system to su(3 ) , one requires another spinless ( or singlet ) u(1 ) basis .",
    "one possible way to obtain such a hamiltonian is to introduce a spin - singlet kondo impurity as new basis in each unit cell .",
    "solving a kondo lattice model , one can obtain the reqired bloch phase @xmath135 for the hopping between su(2 ) species to the kondo impurity .",
    "finally , the rashba - soc between the su(2 ) basis provides the chirality between them . in this way , an effective su(3 ) topological hamiltonian can be constructed which can be written in terms of @xmath224-matrices .",
    "the corresponding results will be published elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the paper delivers the following messages .",
    "we showed that for the su(3 ) topological phase , two of the basis components must contain counter - propagating chiral phase .",
    "the third component can take any of the chirality and/or may be chiral - free .",
    "this situation is analogous to a su(2 ) topological insulator in which chirality inversion is also an important criterion .",
    "one way to obtain chirality inversion in su(2 ) systems is through reversing the soc , either intrinsically in layered materials,@xcite or in engineered heterostructures in which adjacent layers are assumed to have opposite soc,@xcite or even through fermi surface nesting between spin - orbit coupled objects which in special cases can render chirality reversal.@xcite    we engineered the complex phase dependent off - diagonal terms in a tripartite lattice through uncompensated bloch phase .",
    "the chirality inversion is naturally obtained between the sublattices 1 & 3 , which is reversed from that between 1 & 2 and 2 & 3 . the multi - channel set - up of one - dimensional atomic chains suggested in our model",
    "can be visualized as an array of quantum wires , hosting different types of orbitals , being subjected to a linearly polarized static electromagnetic field .",
    "quantum wires are being studied extensively to describe varied topological phenomena theoretically  @xcite .",
    "fractional topological phases are being studied in weakly coupled quantum wires , in both two and three dimensions.@xcite periodically driven systems can also show interesting non - trivial topological effects in spinless systems  @xcite and can also be extended to su(3 ) systems .",
    "furthermore , fermi surface nesting in quantum wires with soc can also lead to chirality inversion between different sublattices through the formation of an exotic spin - orbit density wave , as predicted @xcite and subsequently realized @xcite in pb- , and bi - based quantum wires .",
    "quantum wires can be grown on electric field grid or on ferroelectric subtracts which can be tailored to obtain chirality inversion in the off - diagonal and diagonal terms .    the second criterion for the su(3 )",
    "topological hamiltonian is unique to this system . here",
    ", two of the diagonal terms in the hamiltonian must contain an odd parity term , such as a sinusoidal function of the momentum .",
    "this poses an important bottleneck to engineer su(3 ) topological phase in a condensed matter setup .",
    "here we mainly focused on designing such term through electromagnetic wave by generalizing the tight - binding hamiltonian with an applied vector potential .",
    "this gives a spinless su(3 ) topological material .",
    "we proposed two realistic techniques , using either the sisyphus cooling technique or polarizer plates to obtain the desired site - selective polarization .",
    "robustness of the spinless su(3 ) topological phase when spin is introduced is also discussed .",
    "we showed that as long as there is only a magnetic exchange term present without any spin - flip term , the topological invariant is robust upto a new band inversion . as the exchange energy surpass the band gap ,",
    "a topological phase transition occurs , reducing or increasing the chern number by an integer value . when a spin - flip term is introduced ( such as spin orbit coupling or antiferromagnetic like term ) , spin is no longer a good quantum number , and chern number can no longer be defined for each spin or band .",
    "so our formalism does not hold any more .",
    "the presence of edge states can be detected by using non - local electrical measurements  @xcite , where a current applied between two probes creates a net current along the edge .",
