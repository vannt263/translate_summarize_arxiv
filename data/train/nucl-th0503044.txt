    "in recent years effective field theory ( eft ) techniques have found increasing acceptance in nuclear physics .",
    "eft facilitates the systematic separation of the effects of high - momentum physics from those of low - momentum physics . in nuclear physics",
    "there are many different momentum scales present .",
    "but for the @xmath5 system the key ones would seem to be : @xmath6 with @xmath7 the binding energy of deuterium , @xmath8 and @xmath9 the pion and nucleon masses , and @xmath10 the scale of chiral - symmetry breaking , which is of the order of the mass of the @xmath11 meson . an eft based on",
    "the first hierarchy@xmath12has had considerable success describing very - low - energy reactions in @xmath5 and @xmath13 ( for reviews see  @xcite ) , and has recently been extended to @xmath14  @xcite . here",
    "i will focus on the eft built on the second hierarchy@xmath15 .",
    "this eft is chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath4pt )  ( for a review see @xcite ) . here",
    "the low - momentum physics is described by a quantum field theory of nucleons and pions whose lagrangian is the most general one that respects the approximate chiral symmetry of qcd and the pattern of its breaking .",
    "higher - energy effects of qcd appear in @xmath4pt as non - renormalizable contact operators .",
    "any process involving nucleons and an arbitrary number of ( soft ) pions and photons should then be computable as an expansion in the ratio of nucleon or probe momenta ( denoted here by @xmath16 and @xmath17 ) and @xmath8 to @xmath10 .    since typical momenta in light nuclei are @xmath18 we would expect to be able to calculate the response of such nuclei to low - momentum electroweak probes using @xmath4pt . as we will see below",
    ", @xmath4pt provides a systematic way to compute what in nuclear - structure physics would be called `` bare operators '' .",
    "but the operators computed in this fashion include pieces which account for the fact that they are not actually `` bare '' if one thinks about the physics at scale @xmath19 which has been `` integrated out '' of the low - momentum theory of nucleons and pions : high - momentum nucleon modes , the delta isobar , mesons such as the rho , pomerons , m - branes , etc .    here",
    "i will argue that these operators produce results for electromagnetic few - nucleon reactions which are model independent , can be systematically improved by going to higher order , and yield a good description of the data over the region of validity of the eft .",
    "section 2 outlines the @xmath4pt expansion , and briefly discusses how to obtain deuteron wave functions using it .",
    "section 3 then looks at electron - deuteron scattering in @xmath4pt as a probe of deuteron structure .",
    "section 4 examines the use of compton scattering on the deuteron  in particular as a way to extract isoscalar polarizabilities of the nucleon .",
    "consider an elastic scattering process on the deuteron . if @xmath20 is the transition operator for this reaction",
    "then the amplitude in question is simply @xmath21 , with @xmath22 the deuteron wave function . in this section ,",
    "we follow weinberg  @xcite , and divide the formulation of a systematic expansion for this amplitude into two parts : the expansion for @xmath20 , and the construction of @xmath22 .",
    "chiral perturbation theory gives a systematic expansion for @xmath20 of the form @xmath23 where we have labeled the contributions to @xmath20 by their order @xmath24 in the small parameter @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 .",
    "to construct @xmath28 one first writes down the vertices appearing in the chiral lagrangian up to order @xmath24 .",
    "one then draws all of the two - body , two - nucleon - irreducible , feynman graphs for the process of interest which are of chiral order @xmath29 .",
    "the rules for calculating the chiral order of a particular graph are :    * each nucleon propagator scales like @xmath30 ( provided that the energy flowing through the nucleon line is @xmath31 ) ; * each loop contributes @xmath32 ; * graphs in which both particles participate in the reaction acquire a factor of @xmath33 ; * each pion propagator scales like @xmath34 ; * each vertex from the @xmath24th - order piece of the chiral lagrangian contributes @xmath29 .    in consequence",
    "more complicated contributions involving two - body mechanisms , and/or higher - order vertices , and/or more loops are suppressed by powers of @xmath35 .",
    "this leaves us with the problem of constructing a deuteron wave function that is consistent with the operator @xmath20 .",
    "weinberg s proposal was to use the @xmath4pt expansion ( [ eq : expansion ] ) for the @xmath36 potential @xmath37 , and then solve the schrdinger equation to find the deuteron ( or other nuclear ) wave function  @xcite .",
    "matrix elements @xmath38 should then incorporate the consequences of chiral - symmetry breaking in a model - independent way .",
    "calculations have shown that the @xmath36 phase shifts can be understood , and deuteron bound - state static properties reliably computed , with @xmath36 potentials derived from @xmath4pt  @xcite .",
    "this is now a sophisticated enterprise , with n@xmath39lo @xmath40o@xmath41 $ ] potentials recently having been obtained  @xcite .",
    "these potentials can reproduce @xmath36 data with an accuracy which rivals that of `` high - quality '' @xmath36 potentials , at least for @xmath42 mev",
    ".    in the goldstone - boson and single - nucleon sector @xmath4pt works because loop effects are generically suppressed by powers of the small parameter @xmath35 . in zero and",
    "one - nucleon reactions the power counting in @xmath35 applies to the amplitude , and not to the two - particle potential .",
    "however , the existence of nuclei tells us immediately that a power counting in which all loop effects are suppressed can not be correct for the multi - nucleon case , since if it were there would be no nuclei , and neither we , or this workshop , would occur .",
    "weinberg s proposal to instead power - count the potential is one response to this dilemma .",
    "however , its consistency has been vigorously debated in the literature ( see  @xcite for reviews ) .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite have shown that weinberg s proposal is consistent to leading order in the @xmath43 channel , but there remain questions about the consistency in other channels and at higher orders  @xcite . here",
    "we will use wave functions calculated according to the weinberg proposal .",
    "one of our objectives will be to assess whether such a procedure really does lead to convergent eft expansions for the processes under consideration , or whether problems along the lines of those raised in refs .",
    "@xcite also occur in the chiral eft for electroweak reactions on deuterium .",
    "one quantitative test of @xmath4pt s deuteron wave functions is provided by elastic electron - deuteron scattering .",
    "we thus turn our attention to the deuteron electromagnetic form factors @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 .",
    "these are matrix elements of the deuteron current @xmath47 , with : @xmath48 where we have labeled these ( non - relativistic ) deuteron states by the projection of the deuteron spin along the direction of the momentum transfer @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "@xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 are related to the experimentally - measured @xmath51 , @xmath7 , and @xmath52 in the usual way , with @xmath52 being primarily sensitive to @xmath53 and @xmath7 depending only to @xmath46 . here",
    "we will compare calculations of the charge and quadrupole form factor with the recent extractions of @xmath44 and @xmath45 from data  @xcite .",
    "both of these form factors involve the zeroth - component of the deuteron four - current @xmath54 .",
    "here we split @xmath54 into two pieces : a one - body part , and a two - body part .",
    "the one - body part of @xmath54 begins at order @xmath55 ( the proton charge ) with the impulse approximation diagram calculated with the non - relativistic single - nucleon charge operator for structureless nucleons .",
    "corrections to the single - nucleon charge operator from relativistic effects and nucleon sub - structure are suppressed by two powers of @xmath35 , and thus arise at @xmath56 , which is the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) for @xmath44 and @xmath45 . at this order one might also expect meson - exchange current ( mec ) contributions .",
    "however , all mecs constructed with vertices from @xmath57 are isovector .",
    "these play a role in , e.g. @xmath58  @xcite . the first mec effect in @xmath59 does not occur until n@xmath60lo , or @xmath61 , where an @xmath62 vertex from @xmath63 gets included in an isoscalar two - body contribution to the deuteron charge operator ( see fig .",
    "[ deuterongraphs](b ) )  .",
    "the most important correction that arises at nlo is the inclusion of _ nucleon _ sub - structure . at @xmath56",
    "the isoscalar nucleon form factors are dominated by short - distance physics , and so the only correction to the point - like leading - order result comes from the inclusion of the nucleon s electric radius . for the isoscalar combination of nucleon electric form factors @xmath4pt to @xmath56 gives : @xmath64 this description of nucleon structure breaks down at momentum transfers @xmath17 of order 300 mev .",
    "there is a concomitant failure in the description of @xmath1 scattering data  @xcite . in order to focus on _ deuteron _ structure , in the results presented below",
    "i have chosen to circumvent this issue by using a `` factorized '' inclusion of nucleon structure  @xcite : @xmath4pt is used to compute the ratio @xmath65 .",
    "this allows us to use experimentally - measured single - nucleon form factors   scattering data is one input to the extraction of the neutron electric form factor . ] in the calculation , thereby allowing us to test how far the theory is able to describe the @xmath36 dynamics .",
    "the results for @xmath44 and @xmath45 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - fcfq ] .",
    "the figure demonstrates that convergence is quite good below @xmath66 mev .",
    "the results shown are for the nlo chiral wave function .",
    "it is clear that  provided information from single - nucleon form factors is taken into account@xmath4pt is perfectly capable of describing the charge and quadrupole form factors of deuterium at least as far as the minimum in @xmath44 .",
    "@xmath46 can be obtained in a similar way . the lo contribution to @xmath46",
    "is @xmath67 .",
    "the first two - body mechanisms enter at @xmath68 , when an undetermined two - body counterterm , as well as a long - range two - body current with an undetermined coefficient , appear  @xcite .",
    "results for @xmath46 at @xmath61 turn out to be of similar quality to those for @xmath44  @xcite , but are somewhat more sensitive to short - distance physics , as expected given the presence of a counterterm at nnlo in this observable .",
    "using the nnlo chiral wave function , high - quality potential - model wave functions , or indeed simple wave functions which include only one - pion exchange regulated by a square well at short distances , does not modify the plots for @xmath44 and @xmath45 greatly below @xmath69 mev  @xcite . as long as wave functions with the same long - distance parts",
    "are employed these observables are apparently not very sensitive to the choice of @xmath22 . in the language of the no - core shell model they do not `` renormalize strongly '' .",
    "( an important exception is the deuteron quadrupole moment , @xmath70 . )",
    "this is good news for weinberg s power counting , because the first operators with which @xmath71 can be renormalized occur at @xmath72 ( fig .",
    "[ deuterongraphs](c ) ) .",
    "therefore it was to be expected that operator renormalization would have this small impact on @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "furthermore , the dominant piece of the operator renormalization can be taken into account by adjusting the coefficients of the @xmath72 operators to reproduce , e.g. @xmath73 and @xmath70 .",
    "this would then push the omitted effects of operator renormalization in these observables to @xmath74 .",
    "compton scattering on the nucleon at low energies is a fundamental probe of the long - distance structure of these hadrons .",
    "this process has been studied in @xmath75 in @xcite .",
    "the following results for the proton polarizabilities were obtained at @xmath76 : @xmath77 going to next order in the chiral expansion single - nucleon counterterms which shift the polarizabilities enter the calculation . using the @xmath78 amplitude computed by mcgovern to @xmath79  @xcite we fitted @xmath78 data over the kinematic range @xmath80 mev  @xcite .",
    "= 10.0 cm    the best fit for the proton electric and magnetic polarizabilities is @xmath81 statistical ( 1-@xmath82 ) errors are inside the brackets .",
    "an estimate of the theoretical error due to truncation of the expansion at @xmath83 is given outside the brackets .",
    "the result ( [ eq : protpol1 ] ) is compatible with other extractions , although the central value of @xmath84 is higher  @xcite .",
    "one would like to perform a similar analysis for @xmath3 scattering data .",
    "coherent compton scattering on a deuteron target has been measured at @xmath85 49 and 69 mev by the illinois group @xcite , at @xmath86 mev at saskatoon  @xcite , and at @xmath87 and @xmath88 mev at maxlab at lund  @xcite .",
    "such data should permit an extraction of the isoscalar nucleon polarizabilities @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "these are interesting , not only as fundamental nucleon - structure parameters , but also because @xmath4pt predicts @xmath91 , @xmath92 at @xmath93 .",
    "the amplitude for @xmath3 scattering involves mechanisms other than compton scattering on the individual constituent nucleons .",
    "so , our desire to extract nucleon polarizabilities argues for a theoretical calculation of this reaction that is under control in the sense that it accounts for _ all _ mechanisms to a given order in @xmath75 .    the compton amplitude we wish to evaluate is ( in the @xmath3 center - of - mass frame ) : @xmath94 where @xmath9 ( @xmath95 ) is the initial ( final ) deuteron spin state , and @xmath96 ( @xmath97 ) is the initial ( final ) photon polarization state , and @xmath98 ( @xmath99 ) the initial ( final ) photon three - momentum , which are constrained to @xmath100 .",
    "the first integral is represented by the graphs of fig .",
    "[ procomptonebodmod ] where the photon interacts with only one nucleon .",
    "the second integral corresponds to the graphs of fig .",
    "[ combined ] where the current is of a two - body nature .    -2.2",
    "cm    the lo contribution to compton scattering on the deuteron is shown in fig .  [ procomptonebodmod](a ) .",
    "this graph involves a vertex from @xmath63 and so is @xmath101 .",
    "this contribution is simply the thomson term for scattering on the proton .",
    "there is thus no sensitivity to either two - body contributions _ or _ nucleon polarizabilities at this order . at @xmath102",
    "there are several more graphs with a spectator nucleon ( figs .",
    "[ procomptonebodmod](b),(c),(d ) ) , as well as graphs involving an exchanged pion with leading order vertices ( fig .",
    "[ combined ] ) and one - loop graphs with a spectator nucleon ( fig .",
    "[ procomptonebodmod](e ) )  @xcite .",
    "graphs such as fig .",
    "[ procomptonebodmod](e ) contain the physics of the proton and neutron polarizabilities at @xmath76 in @xmath4pt .",
    "we employed a variety of wave functions @xmath22 , and found moderate wave - function sensitivity .",
    "results shown here are generated with the nlo chiral wave function of ref .",
    "[ cvgplot ] shows the results of a fit to the world s modern @xmath3 data .",
    "the dotted line is the prediction at @xmath103 in the kernel , where the second contribution in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gammad ] ) is zero , and the single - scattering contribution is given solely by fig .",
    "[ procomptonebodmod](a ) .",
    "it is quite remarkable how well the @xmath103 calculation reproduces the 49 mev data .",
    "however , the agreement is somewhat serendipitous : there are significant @xmath76 corrections . at these lower photon energies",
    "weinberg power counting begins to break down , since it is designed for @xmath104 , and does _ not _ recover the deuteron thomson amplitude as @xmath105 . correcting the power counting",
    "to remedy this difficulty appears to improve the description of the 49 mev data , without significantly modifying the higher - energy results  @xcite .    at @xmath76",
    "all contributions to the kernel are fixed in terms of known pion and nucleon parameters , so to this order @xmath75 makes _ predictions _ for deuteron compton scattering .",
    "note that the @xmath76 corrections get larger as @xmath106 is increased  as expected .",
    "the agreement of the @xmath76 calculation with the intermediate - energy data sets is very good , although only limited conclusions can be drawn .",
    "these results are not very different from other , potential - model , calculations  @xcite .    at @xmath79 terms",
    "enter the single - nucleon amplitude which allow us to fit @xmath89 and @xmath90 to @xmath3 data .",
    "a number of new two - body currents also appear . however , there are still no short - distance @xmath107 operators contributing to @xmath3 scattering at this order .",
    "therefore an @xmath79 calculation allows us to test the single - nucleon physics which is used to predict the results of coherent scattering on deuterium , since there are no undetermined parameters in the two - body mechanisms that enter .",
    "unfortunately the data is fairly sparse , and the sensitivity to the @xmath36 wave function quite large , so our fit does not tie down @xmath89 and @xmath90 very accurately . the result is : @xmath108 the errors inside the brackets are statistical and those outside are an estimate of the effect from higher - order terms .",
    "( for details see ref .",
    "the fit only includes data satisfying @xmath109 mev .",
    "recent work suggests that to describe the backward - angle points at 95 mev requires the inclusion of an explicit delta degree of freedom  @xcite .",
    "the second error quoted on @xmath89 and @xmath90 is large because , as alluded to above , cross sections depend on the choice of @xmath110 at the 1020% level .",
    "this change in the @xmath3 cross section has a sizable impact on the extraction of @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "while not all of the wave functions we employed are consistent with @xmath4pt , they do all have the correct long - distance behavior .",
    "the differences we see are thus a consequence of different short - range behavior in , say , the nijm93 and nlo @xmath4pt @xmath36 potentials . as such they",
    "should be renormalized by @xmath107 contact operators .",
    "however , weinberg power counting predicts that the operators which do this do not appear until ( at least ) @xmath111 .",
    "thus the degree of variability seen in our results with different wave functions could be viewed as inconsistent with this power counting .",
    "indeed , it may be necessary to modify the power counting so that , e.g. @xmath107 contact operators appear at a lower order than is indicated by the naive @xmath4pt power counting we have used for @xmath20 .",
    "the issue here is one of relevance to nuclear - structure physics : it speaks of the need to properly renormalize the effective @xmath107 operators found when high - energy degrees of freedom are integrated out of our eft of the @xmath36 system .",
    "further understanding of this issue is also crucial if @xmath4pt is to be an accurate calculational tool for low - energy reactions on deuterium .",
    "there is nothing in what i have presented so far that is particular to the photon as a probe .",
    "analogous expansions can be made for axial currents .",
    "the result is a systematic approach to reactions such as @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "i do not have room to properly describe the beautiful work on these reactions by park , ando , and collaborators  @xcite .",
    "in my view a particular strength of that work is the application of the same @xmath4pt electroweak operators to @xmath5 , 3 , and 4 . ref .",
    "@xcite uses the well - known tritium beta decay rate to fix the strength of an ( otherwise poorly constrained ) two - body contribution to the gamow - teller transition operator .",
    "this renormalizes the effective @xmath36 gamow - teller operator to such high accuracy that the @xmath114-fusion @xmath115 factor has an estimated error from higher - order terms of less than @xmath116% . the same one- and two - nucleon operators are then used to predict the reaction @xmath117  @xcite and @xmath118 scattering  @xcite .",
    "this is a great example of @xmath4pt s ability to give a systematic derivation of electroweak operators that can be used in a variety of light nuclear systems to yield accurate predictions .",
