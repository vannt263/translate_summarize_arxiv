    "the possibility of current - induced magnetic switching ( cims ) in multilayer structures has been introduced by slonczewski @xcite and berger @xcite .",
    "they pointed out that spin polarized current passing through a multilayer consisting of two ferromagnetic layers separated by a nonmagnetic spacer can exert a torque on the local magnetic moments in ferromagnetic layers . in case of commonly used ( standard )",
    "spin valves , this torque can switch the system between parallel ( p ) and antiparallel ( ap ) alignments of the layers magnetic moments . indeed , the cims has been confirmed experimentally in many spin valve structures @xcite .    in order to meet the technological demands for applications , designing of bistable magnetic spin valve devices that could be fast switched by electric current only is highly desired .",
    "accordingly , several subtle switching schemes aimed at speeding up the switching process and lowering the energy costs have been developed for various magnetic multilayer structures .",
    "it has been shown that proper optimization of the current pulse parameters ( amplitude , duration , frequency , etc . )",
    "can finally result in ultrafast , single - step , switching @xcite .",
    "current - induced dynamics in spin valves is governed by spin - transfer torque ( stt ) , particularly by its magnitude and dependence on the angle between magnetization vectors of the reference and sensing magnetic layers .",
    "such an angular variation depends mainly on the type of electron transport through the spin valve .",
    "recently , stt in the diffusive transport regime draws more attention .",
    "it has been demonstrated @xcite , that spin diffusion in various types of polarizing layer can strongly influence the current - induced behavior of spin valves . to calculate stt in the diffusive transport limit",
    ", one can consider the model @xcite that extends the valet - fert description @xcite to arbitrary magnetic configuration and allows to study stt as a function of layers thicknesses , type of materials , spin asymmetries , etc , which can be directly compared to experimental observations @xcite . in the case of diffusive transport",
    ", spin - diffusion length has to be much longer than the mean free path .",
    "however , it has been shown @xcite that diffusive approach is valid also for spin diffusion lengths of the order of mean free paths",
    ". moreover , the approach describes relatively well experimental results even for layer thicknesses comparable to the corresponding mean free paths .",
    "one of the most pronounced manifestation of the importance of spin - diffusion length has been shown for asymmetric spin valves @xcite , where the non - standard ( wavy - like ) angular dependence of stt leads to the current - induced precessional regimes in zero magnetic field @xcite .",
    "this prediction has been later confirmed experimentally @xcite .",
    "the wavy - like stt vanishes not only in the collinear configurations ",
    "p and ap ones  but also in a certain non - collinear configuration .",
    "depending on the current direction , the collinear configurations are either both stable or both unstable .",
    "the first case is of importance for the current - induced zero - field microwave excitations , while the later one would be desired for further stabilization of the collinear magnetic configurations in memory devices against thermal or current fluctuations .",
    "since the problem of switching in non - standard spin valves has not been addressed yet , here we present a comprehensive study of the cims in such systems due to a current pulse of finite duration . in the following ,",
    "the spin valves with wavy - like stt will be refereed to interchangeably as nonstandard or asymmetric ones , whereas the spin valves with stt vanishing only in collinear configurations will be referred to as standard or symmetric ones .    in this paper , we investigate current - pulse - induced magnetization dynamics in three - layer spin valves @xmath0 sandwiched between semi - infinite cu leads .",
    "the numbers in brackets correspond to the layers thicknesses in nanometers .",
    "the py(8 ) stands for the permalloy sensing layer , which magnetization direction can freely rotate upon applied magnetic field and/or spin polarized current , whereas @xmath1 denotes the reference layer , which magnetization is considered to be fixed and not influenced by external magnetic fields and electric current . assuming these conditions , we have considered two different types of the reference layer : @xmath2 , and @xmath3 .",
    "taking into account the above introduced notation , the former spin valves , @xmath4 , we will referred to as standard or symmetric , whereas the latter spin valves , @xmath5 , we will be referred to as non - standard or asymmetric ones .",
    "the main motivation of this paper is to provide a systematic study of the cims , based on the macrospin simulations .",
    "we consider a rectangular current pulse characterized by the current amplitude and pulse duration .",
    "we have found that a proper choice of the pulse parameters leads to fast switching with relatively low energy costs . in the case of non - standard spin valves , the double - pulse scheme , which allows reliable switching between the collinear magnetic configurations and significant shortening of the overall switching time , is proposed .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  2",
    "we describe the macrospin model . numerical analysis for both standard and non - standard ( asymmetric ) spin valve is described in section  3 , where also a double - pulse switching scheme for an asymmetric spin valve is described .",
    "section  4 includes summary and final conclusions .",
    "time resolved imaging of cims showed that inhomogeneous spatio - temporal magnetization evolution takes place during the reversal @xcite .",
    "thus , more sophisticated models , involving detailed micromagnetic description , have to be adopted for a better qualitative description @xcite . however , the macrospin model  particularly for spin valves in nano - size range  provides a sufficient quantitative description of the current - induced dynamics , which is in agreement with many experiments on standard spin valves @xcite .",

    "the @xmath105 points are close to the maximum magnetic energy . therefore , if current is turned off , the spin position becomes unstable ; spin is driven due to gilbert damping through the opp regime with decreasing precessional frequency to the ipp regime . in the ipp regime ,",

    ", the pulse has to exceed a critical current density and duration . in the static limit ( @xmath110 ) the critical density is about @xmath111 . for a finite pulse duration ,",
    "higher densities are necessary to drive the spin during the time @xmath49 away from the p state . when the pulse is shorter than a critical one , the relaxation back to the p state takes place [ region ( i ) ] . to escape the basin of attraction , the time @xmath49 has to exceed an escape time that depends on the actual magnetic energy and the current density . for the higher current densities ,",
    "the spin is driven faster away and a shorter escape time is needed . if the pulse ends just before the onset of the opp regime , the spin is then placed within the basin of attraction of the ap state . the relaxation via the gilbert dissipation drives the system to the ap state [ region ( ii ) ] .",

    "we note that both the collinear configurations are now unstable .",
    "the second pulse of positive current , called _ stabilizing pulse _ , controls the dynamics and drives the spin into the final state .",
    "moreover , the stabilizing pulse shortens the switching time ( suppressing the ringing ) via additional energy dissipation from the system .    in fig .",
    "5(a ) we show time evolution of the @xmath88 component due to single current - pulse and double current - pulse . here",
    "we consider infinitely long stabilizing pulse that in principle has no effect on the spin dynamics for @xmath116 .",
