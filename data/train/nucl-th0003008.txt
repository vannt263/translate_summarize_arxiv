    "it is believed that a neutron star begins its life as a proto - neutron star ( pns ) in the aftermath of a supernova explosion .",
    "the evolution of the pns depends upon the star s mass , composition , and equation of state ( eos ) , as well as the opacity of neutrinos in dense matter .",
    "previous studies @xcite have shown that the pns may become unstable as it emits neutrinos and deleptonizes , so that it collapses into a black hole .",
    "the instability occurs if the maximum mass that the equation of state ( eos ) of lepton - rich , hot matter can support is greater than that of cold , deleptonized matter , and if the pns mass lies in between these two values .",
    "the condition for metastability is satisfied if `` exotic '' matter , manifested in the form of a bose condensate ( of negatively charged pions or kaons ) or negatively charged particles with strangeness content ( hyperons or quarks ) , appears during the evolution of the pns .",
    "even if collapse to a black hole does not occur , the appearance of exotic matter might lead to a distinguishable feature in the pns s neutrino signature ( _ i.e. _ , its neutrino light curve and neutrino energy spectrum ) that is observable from current and planned terrestrial detectors .",
    "this was investigated recently by pons _",
    "@xcite who studied the evolution of a pns in the case where hyperons appeared in the star during the latter stages of deleptonization .",
    "although the possibility of black hole formation was first discovered in the context of kaon condensation in neutron star matter @xcite , a full dynamical calculation of a pns evolution with consistent eos and neutrino opacities in kaon condensed matter has not been performed so far .",
    "one of the objectives of this paper is to investigate @xmath1 condensation in finite temperature matter , including the situation of trapped neutrinos in more detail .",
    "an impetus for this study is the recent suggestion that a mixed phase of kaon - condensed and normal matter might exist which could greatly affect the structure @xcite and its neutrino opacity @xcite .",
    "another objective of our study is to identify differences in thermodynamic quantities such as the pressure , entropy or specific heat that might produce discriminating features in the star s neutrino emission . in separate works",
    ", we will examine neutrino interactions in kaon - condensed matter and neutrino signals from pns evolution calculations in a consistent fashion .    since we wish to isolate the aforementioned effects due to kaons in this paper , we deliberately exclude consideration of hyperons .",
    "hyperons and kaons were considered together in refs . @xcite and @xcite .",
    "hyperons tend to delay the appearence of kaons in matter , especially if the @xmath2 appears first",
    ". however , the @xmath2 couplings are not as well determined as those of the @xmath3 and even in this case the data are restricted to nuclear or subnuclear densities . relatively small variations in the coupling constants can lead to a situation where the threshold density for the appearance of @xmath2 particles is larger than that for kaons .",
    "these uncertainties remain unresolved ; further hyper - nuclear experiments are needed to pin down their couplings .",
    "the original investigations of kaon condensation in neutron star matter ( _ e.g. _ refs . @xcite and its astrophysical conseqences @xcite ) employed a chiral @xmath4 model in which the kaon - nucleon interaction occurs directly via four point vertices .",
    "however , one can also employ an indirect , finite - range interaction which arises from the exchange of mesons .",
    "several studies have been performed along these lines @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that the chiral and meson exchange approaches give similar results provided that the kaon - nucleon couplings are chosen to yield similar optical potentials in nuclear matter . allowing kaons to interact via the exchange of mesons",
    "has the advantage that it is more consistent with the walecka - type effective field - theoretical models usually used to describe nuclear matter @xcite . in most studies of kaon condensation it has been found that the transition to a phase in which kaons condense is second order for modest values of the kaon optical potential , @xmath5 , of order -100 mev . for magnitudes of @xmath5 well in excess of 100 mev , however , the phase transition becomes first order in character .",
    "even when the transition is first order , it is not always possible to satisfy gibbs criteria for thermal , chemical and mechanical equilibrium , so a maxwell construction , which satisfies only thermal and mechanical equilibrium , was sometimes employed to construct the pressure - density relation .",
    "recently , glendenning and schaffner - bielich ( gs ) @xcite modified the meson exchange lagrangian in such a way that the gibbs criteria for thermal , chemical and mechanical equilibrium in a first order phase transition was possible . the extended mixed phase of kaon - condensed and normal matter which results produces a qualitative difference for the structure of a neutron star , since the eos is softened over a wider region than in the case in which there is no mixed phase .",
    "this has implications for the mass - radius relation and the maximum mass , among other properties of the star .    in this paper , we investigate the phase transition involving kaon - condensed matter and its influence upon the equation of state .",
    "we find that the precise form assumed for the scalar interactions ( particularly , their density dependence ) , both for baryon - baryon and kaon - baryon interactions , determines whether or not the transition is first or second order , and , in the case of a first order phase transition , establishes whether or not a gibbs construction is possible .",
    "since the form of the scalar interactions is not experimentally well constrained at present , we have explored several different models in this study of the effects of kaon condensation on the eos and the structure of a pns . for each model",
    ", we have performed a detailed study of the thermal properties which are summarized in terms of phase diagrams in the density - lepton content and density - temperature planes .    in sec .",
    "ii we present the various lagrangians and derive exressions for the thermodynamic properties of each .",
    "we also develop the theoretical formalism necessary to describe baryons and kaon condensed matter in both the pure and mixed phases .",
    "this is followed by a discussion of the determination of the various coupling constants .",
    "section iii contains a comparison of the results for the eos and for the structure of neutron stars for typical values of entropy and lepton content in a proto - neutron star as it evolves .",

    "for a given kaon lagrangian , fairly similar results can be obtained with different nuclear lagrangians by making relatively small shifts in the kaon optical potential @xmath165 .",

    "the differences in the variation of the scalar ( @xmath176 ) and isovector ( @xmath177 fields between the models are particularly illuminating . for gm+kpe ,",
    "the scalar field exhibits a relatively rapid increase with density after the onset of condensation .",
    "this in turn causes both the nucleon and kaon effective masses to drop rapidly with density .",
    "in fact , for sufficiently large density , the gm+kpe kaon effective mass vanishes ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "the variations of the effective masses in the models gm+gs and zm+tw are more moderate .",
    "the variation of the isovector field with density , which in large part controls the variation of the electron chemical potential @xmath88 and hence the electron concentration , is also more dramatic in the case of gm+kpe than in the gm+gs and zm+tw models . notice that in the kpe model it goes to zero for asymptotic densities ( this follows from eq .",
    "( [ hhyp5 ] ) ) , so that the proton and neutron abundances become equal .",
    "this does not occur for the other two cases considered here .",
    "finally , it is worth noting that in all three models the condensate amplitude rises rapidly once the threshold density is reached .",
    "we turn now to a discussion of the results obtained by imposing gibbs criteria for mechanical and chemical equilibrium at zero temperature . in fig .",
    "[ fig3a ] , we show the chemical potentials associated with the two conserved charges , charge and baryon number , as functions of each other , for the model gm+gs for a kaon optical potential of @xmath178 mev .",
    "quantities associated with the pure nucleon phase , phase i , are shown as solid lines here and in subsequent figures .",
    "phase ii refers to the high - density phase in which nucleons and the kaon condensate are in equilibrium , and quantities associated with it are shown as dashed lines .",
    "both phases , i and ii , coexist in the mixed - phase region which is displayed as a dotted line . this figure illustrates the way a mixed phase is built from the two pure phases . for electron chemical potentials below the solid curve , matter is positively charged in phase i. a similar interpretation of positive or negative charge for @xmath88 below or above the dashed curve is not possible , since two different types of particles , kaons and leptons , can furnish charge . in other words , a decrease in @xmath88 , or , equivalently , the number of electrons , does not necessarily lead to a positive net charge in phase ii . for @xmath179 mev , only phase i with nucleons and leptons are present . for @xmath180 mev , a mixed phase of positively charged phase i and negatively charged phase ii obeying the gibbs conditions ( [ g1 ] ) is favored .",
    "qualitatively , a similar situation is encountered in the construction of the mixed phase for the zm+tw model , but the mixed phase region is quite small . as noted earlier , however , it was not possible to satisfy gibbs criteria for models with the kaon lagrangian kpe .    in fig .",
    "[ fig3b ] we show the individual charge densities of phase i and ii in the mixed phase , as a function of baryon density .",
    "the dotted curve in this figure shows the volume fraction of phase i. the results are for the gm+gs model with @xmath181 mev ( upper panel ) and for the zm+tw model with @xmath182 mev ( lower panel ) . near the lower threshold ,",
    "matter in phase i is very slightly positively charged and occupies most of the volume . as the density increases , the volume fraction of phase i , @xmath126 , decreases and its charge density increases .",
    "note that the negative charge density of matter in phase ii at the lower transition point , @xmath183 @xmath184 , and the positive charge density of matter in phase i at the higher transition point , @xmath185 @xmath184 , are rather large in the case of gm+gs compared to the case zm+tw .",
    "this is due to the stronger density dependence of the scalar and isovector densities in the former case .",
    "note also that a first order transition allows for the existence of a very dense and nearly isospin symmetric matter in the mixed phase .    in figs .",
    "[ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] , we show the magnitudes of the various fields , the electron chemical potential , the nucleon and kaon effective masses , and the condensate amplitude for the gm+gs and zm+tw models , respectively .",
    "both models show the same qualitative behavior . at the lower phase boundary ,",
    "in which phase ii just begins to appear , the scalar field in phase ii is much larger than in phase i and the condensate amplitude @xmath94 in phase ii takes a large value which decreases with increasing @xmath186 through the mixed - phase region .",
    "thus , the effective masses of both kaons and nucleons in phase ii are much smaller than in phase i. the densities demarking the mixed phase region and its overall extent are dependent upon the interaction models , and upon the assumed values of the kaon optical potentials , here taken to be @xmath187 mev in the case of gm+gs and @xmath188 mev in the case of zm+tw .",
    "the region in density over which the mixed phase extends is much smaller in the latter case , chiefly due to the more moderate behavior of the scalar interaction with density variations in this case .",
    "it is instructive to compare the behavior of the two models at the threshold of the mixed phase region .",
    "phase i will have a net small positive charge and a volume proportion @xmath126 close to 1 ( see fig . [ fig3b ] ) .",
    "this has to be counterbalanced by a large net negative charge in phase ii since it is weighted by the small proportion @xmath189 . focusing on phase ii , the condensate condition for the models gm+gs and zm+tw from the last of eqs .",

    "the kpe lagrangian , however , rapidly substitutes electrons by kaons , which is detrimental to meeting the gibbs criteria . for these reasons",

    "the effects of the condensate are more evident in the case of the gm+gs model in which the mixed phase occurs over a wider region of density than in the zm+tw model .",
    "when the effects of the softening induced by the occurrence of the condensate are large , the limiting mass and the radius at the limiting mass are reduced significantly from their values when the condensate is absent .",

    "the calculation of the neutrino spectra of different flavors emitted from a proto - neutron star as it evolves from a hot , lepton - rich state to a cold , neutrino - poor state requires the knowledge of the equation of state of matter at temperatures up to about 5060 mev and lepton fraction up to about 0.4 . since the nucleon - nucleon and kaon - nucleon interactions at high density are relatively poorly understood , we explored several possible field - theoretical models in both sectors .",
    "these models are distinguished by the form of the assumed scalar ( and in some cases vector ) interactions which chiefly determine the density dependences of the nucleon and kaon effective masses .",
    "these models produce significantly different high density behavior of the eos , even though the kaon - meson couplings in these models are calibrated to give the same the kaon - nucleus optical potential in nuclear matter .",
    "the principal findings of our studies at zero temperature were :    1 .",
    "the order of the phase transition between pure nucleonic matter and a phase containing a kaon condensate depends sensitively on the choice of the kaon - nucleon interaction .",
    "2 .   in one case we studied ( kpe ) , although a first - order phase transition resulted , it was not possible to satisfy gibbs rules for phase equilibrium which would have produced a mixed phase .",
    "we performed a detailed analysis of this situation and found that scalar , and to a lesser extent the isovector , interactions that vary rapidly with density were chiefly responsible for this failure .",
    "this was confirmed by developing a new kaon - nucleon interaction ( tw ) with more moderate variations in the scalar density and the kaon effective mass in which the gibbs criteria in a first order phase transition would be satisfied . the extent of the mixed phase region was thereby reduced .",
    "the significance of the new kaon - nucleon interaction ( tw ) we developed is that it avoids the anomalous behavior for the kaon effective mass that occurs in previous models ( kpe , gs ) at very high density .",
    "near the low - density boundary of a mixed phase region , the kaon condensed phase appears with large density , too large for the kpe interaction to produce physically acceptable effective masses .",
    "we also made detailed comparisons with earlier work which used the gs form for the scalar interactions .",
    "3 .   in all models considered ( kpe , gs and tw )",
    ", a first - order phase transition occurs only for large values of the kaon - nucleus optical potential ; moderate values generally produce a second order phase transition .    in the meson exchange models studied here ,",
    "only linear kaon self - interactions were considered . in the case of a first order phase transition , the condensate amplitude was found to be rather large at the low - density boundary of the mixed phase .",
    "we therefore explored the effect of non - linear kaon self - interactions guided by the chiral model in appendix b. we found that introducing higher order interactions , using the lowest order chiral lagrangian , results in a second order , rather than a first order , phase transition . whether this behavior persists",
    "when more general higher order operators in the chiral expansion are considered remains an open question .    at finite temperatures",
    ", we find the effects of condensation , in general , are less pronounced than at zero temperature . for moderate values of the optical potential ,",
    "when the phase transition is first order at zero temperature , kaon condensation eventually becomes a second order phase transition at high enough temperatures , whether or not neutrino trapping is considered .",
    "the temperature at which this occurs is in the range of 3060 mev , depending upon interactions . for the cases at finite temperatures in which the transition is first order , its thermodynamics ( such as the pressure - density relation ) becomes effectively similar to that of a second order phase transition",
    "this is because of the existence of thermal kaons and because of nucleonic thermal effects .",
    "the condensate is suppressed , and moved to higher densities , both by the existence of trapped neutrinos and by finite temperatures .",
    "compared to earlier works , the new aspects of our work are :    1 .   the delineation of the phase boundaries in the baryon density versus lepton number and baryon density versus temperature planes .",
    "this is helpful to anticipating the possible outcome in a full pns simulation .",
    "in particular , the critical temperatures above which the mixed phase disappears are above 30 and 60 mev , depending upon the interaction .",
    "this has implications for the temperature dependence of the surface energies , and for the melting temperatures , of the droplets in the mixed phase .",
    "the finding that thermal effects on the maximum gravitational mass of neutron stars are comparable to the effects induced by the trapped neutrino content .",
    "this is in stark contrast to previously studied cases in which nucleons - only matter , or matter containing hyperons , were considered .",
    "furthermore , compared to equations of state previously studied that allow metastable protoneutron stars , those containing hyperons or quark matter , the maximum mass does not significantly decrease during the deleptonization of the protoneutron star because of these thermal effects .",
    "only after the temperature in the protoneutron star significantly decreases does the maximum mass appreciably fall .",

    "i.e. , _ @xmath241 . specializing to the case where the only baryons are nucleons and using the walecka lagrangian for the nucleons ,",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the chiral thermodynamic potential per unit volume can be written @xmath242 where the primes on the meson fields distinguish them from those used previously and @xmath243 is the heaviside step function .",
    "the nucleon effective masses are @xmath244 we employ the values suggested by politzer and weise @xcite , namely @xmath245 mev ( @xmath246 is the strange quark mass ) and @xmath247 mev .",
    "@xmath248 is usually taken to lie in the range @xmath249 to @xmath250 mev .",
    "if we ignore the fairly small effect of @xmath251 here and in the kaon - nucleon sigma term , @xmath252 , we can write @xmath253 as well as redefining the scalar field , we can redefine the chiral vector fields entering the chemical potentials : @xmath254 substituting in eq .",
    "( [ omkap ] ) we find @xmath255 if we expand this in powers of @xmath94 and retain only the lowest order @xmath256 term , the last term in eq .",
    "( [ omchmes ] ) does not contribute and our thermodynamic potential is exactly of the form given by eqs .",
    "( [ hyp2 ] ) and ( [ zkexch ] ) for the meson exchange model provided that the @xmath68 expression is used . in order for the correspondence to be exact ,",
    "the parameters for the @xmath7 and @xmath8 meson need to obey @xmath257 these are precisely the conditions found in ref .",
    "@xcite for the optical potentials of the chiral and meson exchange models to be the same in nuclear matter .",
    "the relation involving the @xmath8 meson couplings is quite well obeyed with our parameters .",
    "in addition , for the @xmath9 meson , @xmath258 this indicates that @xmath259 , a condition which is not well obeyed by the parameters used here or in other works .",
    "given that the chiral and meson exchange thermodynamic potentials can be put into precise correspondence to lowest order in @xmath256 , it follows that the equations of motion and the thermodynamics will be identical to this order .",
    "if scalar self - coupling terms are included , @xmath260 , then the transition from the chiral to the meson exchange approach will couple higher powers of the @xmath7 field to the kaon condensate ( in the braces in eq .",
    "( [ omchmes ] ) ) .",
    "it will also introduce higher order terms .",
    "these additional contributions may not be negligible so the correspondence between the two approaches becomes less precise .",
    "our findings in appendix a naturally raise the question of whether it is sufficient to work at order @xmath256 , involving only linear kaon self - interactions , in the meson exchange models .",
    "it clearly will be sufficient at the low - density onset of a second order phase transition where @xmath94 is small .",
    "on the other hand , for a first order phase transition , the value of @xmath94 is large at the low - density onset of the mixed phase , particularly for the gs model .",
    "it is therefore interesting to explore the effect of non - linear kaon self - interactions guided by the chiral model .",
    "the order of the phase transition ( in the mean field approximation ) is determined by the behavior of the thermodynamic potential , @xmath261 , at fixed chemical potentials .",
    "a first order transition , with a mixed phase , is possible only if there exists some value of @xmath124 for which @xmath261 exhibits two degenerate minima . at the critical density corresponding to the low - density onset of the mixed phase ,",
    "the @xmath117 phase should be a local minimum which is degenerate with a minimum at some finite @xmath262 . in the vicinity of the critical density ,",
    "the @xmath117 phase is nearly charge neutral ( with an infinitesimal excess of positive charge and a volume fraction close to 1 which balances the negative charge in the kaon phase which has an infinitesimal volume fraction ) .",
    "this requirement enables us to determine the electron chemical potential at the critical density by charge neutrality .",
    "we focus on the gm+gs model for which the thermodynamic potential of nucleons and kaons was given in eqs .",
    "( [ hyp2 ] ) and ( [ zkexch ] ) ; the contribution due to leptons is ignored since it does not contain any @xmath94 dependence at fixed @xmath88 . at zero temperature with a kaon optical potential @xmath175 mev",
    ", this model predicts a first order phase transition in the vicinity of @xmath263 mev , as can be deduced from fig .",
    "[ fig14 ] where @xmath264 is plotted as a function of @xmath94 . the thermodynamic potential for the model gm+gs is shown as the solid curve labelled @xmath265 .",
    "it clearly shows two minima , one at @xmath117 and the other at @xmath266 .",
    "the latter corresponds to a kaon number density @xmath267 @xmath184 which is larger than the baryon density .",
    "for such a dense condensate one would suspect that non - linear kaon self - interactions might be important .",
    "the order @xmath268 corrections to the thermodynamic potential are easily found from eq .",
    "( [ omchmes ] ) : @xmath269 the result of adding this correction to @xmath265 is shown as the dashed curve in fig .",
    "[ fig14 ] .",
    "it greatly alters the behavior of @xmath261 for @xmath270 .",
    "the exsistence of a second minimum suggests that a first order phase transition is still possible , but at larger @xmath124 .",
    "however , we find that this is not the case and a second - order transition occurs at @xmath271 mev .",
    "it is possible to incorporate all powers of @xmath94 arising from self - interactions in the chiral model . in this case",
    "the correction to the grand potential is @xmath272 the result of including this correction is shown as the dot - dashed curve in fig .",
    "[ fig14 ] . in this case",
    "no first order phase transition is possible in the vicinity of @xmath273 .",
    "instead a second order phase transition occurs once again at @xmath271 mev ; this is because kaon self interactions play no role when @xmath94 is small . despite our findings here",
    ", it is not clear if kaon self - interactions will generically disfavor a first order transition .",
    "this is because we have ignored higher order operators in the chiral expansion which will become important with increasing @xmath94 .",
    "the indication from phenomenological chiral perturbation theory @xcite is that such effects can be significant when @xmath274 .",
    "the robust finding here is that the higher order kaon self - interactions predicted by the lowest order chiral lagrangian lead to a second order , rather than a first order , phase transition",
