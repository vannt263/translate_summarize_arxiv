    "spatial confinement of condensed matter is known to induce a wealth of exotic crystalline structures.@xcite in essence this can be attributed to a phenomenon coined packing frustration ; an incompability between the preferred packing of particles  whether atoms , molecules , or colloidal particles  and the packing constraints imposed by the confining surfaces . as an illustrative example , we can consider the extensively studied system of hard spheres confined between planar hard surfaces at a close separation of about five particle diameters or less .",
    "this is a convenient system for studies on packing frustration , because its phase diagram is determined by entropy only .",
    "while the phase diagram of the bulk hard - sphere system is very simple,@xcite the dense packing of hard - sphere particles in narrow slits has been found to induce more than twenty novel thermodynamically stable crystalline phases , including exotic ones such as buckled and prism - like crystalline structures.@xcite    in the case of spatially confined fluids , the effects of packing frustration are more elusive .",
    "nevertheless , extensive studies on the fluid s equilibrium structure has brought into evidence this phenomenon ; confinement - induced ordering of the fluid is suppressed when the short - range order preferred by the fluid s constituent particles is incompatible with the confining surface separation ( see , e.g. , ref .   for illustrative examples ) .",
    "packing frustration also influences other properties of the confined fluid , such as a strongly suppressed dynamics because of caging effects.@xcite however , little is known to date about the underlying mechanisms of frustration in spatially confined fluids .",
    "a stumbling block when elucidating the mechanisms of packing frustration in fluids is the hierarchy of distribution functions;@xcite a mechanistic analysis of distribution functions requires higher - order distributions as input . while density profiles ( i.e. , singlet distributions ) in inhomogeneous fluids are routinely determined today , either by theory , simulations , or experiments , structural studies are only seldom extended to the level of pair distributions.@xcite the overwhelming majority of theoretical work in the literature has been done on the singlet level where pair correlations from the homogeneous bulk fluid are used in various ways as approximations for the inhomogeneous system .",
    "moreover , even in the cases where the pair distributions for the inhomogeneous fluid have been explicitly determined,@xcite the mechanistic analysis of ordering is hampered by the sheer amount of variables .",
    "a conceptually simple scheme for addressing ordering mechanisms in inhomogeneous fluids is therefore much needed .    in this work , we deal with the mechanisms of packing frustration in a dense hard - sphere fluid confined between planar hard surfaces by means of first - principles statistical mechanics at the pair distribution level . for this purpose",
    "we introduce principal components of the mean force acting on a particle , and study their behavior as a function of confining slit width .",
    "this provides a novel and conceptually simple scheme to analyze the mechanisms of ordering in inhomogeneous fluids .",
    "in contrast to the aforementioned multitude of exotic crystalline structures induced by packing frustration , we obtain compelling evidence that even for a dense hard - sphere fluid in narrow confinement , as studied here , the ordering is in essence governed by the packing constraints at a single solid - fluid interface .",
    "nonetheless , there are also some common features for the structures in the fluid and in the solid phases .",
    "finally , we demonstrate how subtleties in the ordering may lead to important , nontrivial confinement effects .",
    "the calculations in this work are done in integral equation theory for inhomogeneous fluids at pair correlation level , where the density profiles and anisotropic pair distributions are calculated self - consistently .",
    "the only approximation made is the closure relation used for the pair correlation function of the inhomogeneous fluid .",
    "we have adopted the percus - yevick closure , which is suitable for hard spheres .",
    "the resulting theory , called the anisotropic percus - yevick ( apy ) approximation , has been shown to give accurate results for inhomogeneous hard sphere fluids in planar confinement.@xcite in principle , pair distribution data for confined fluids could also be obtained from particle configurations obtained by computer simulation , e.g. grand - canonical monte carlo ( gcmc ) simulations . however , even with the computing power presently available , one would need impracticably long simulations in order to obtain a reasonable statistical accuracy for the entire pair distribution , which for the present case has three independent variables .",
    "for the confined hard sphere fluid , the pair distribution function has narrow sharp peaks ( see ref .   for typical examples ) , which are particularly difficult to obtain accurately .",
    "the alternative to use , for example , the widom insertion method to calculate the pair distribution point - wise by simulation is very inefficient for dense systems .",
    "it should be noted , however , that in cases where direct comparison is feasible in practice , simulations and anisotropic integral equation theory are in excellent agreement in terms of pair distributions.@xcite in these cases , for a corresponding amount of pair - distribution data of essentially equal accuracy , the integral - equation approach was found to be many thousands times more efficient in cpu time than the simulations .",
    "finally we note that other highly accurate theoretical approaches , such as fundamental measure theory ( see , e.g. , ref .   for a recent review ) , have not yet been extended to the level of pair distributions in numerical applications .",
    "within the present study , we focus on a dense hard - sphere fluid confined between two planar hard surfaces . for a schematic representation of the confinement geometry , we refer to fig .",

    "particles that form the main layer in contact with the bottom surface can then touch the central particle ; the latter is penetrating just the edge of this layer .",
    "note that the position of the secondary maximum for the middle case , fig .",

    "our task here is to understand the reason for such differences .    in the contour plots of the pair density @xmath18 in fig .",
    "[ fig : ng ] we see that in all three cases the particle density in the wedge - like section formed between the central particle and the upper wall is strongly enhanced , resulting in a local number density of up to 17 , 20 , and 24 @xmath64 , respectively , in the three cases .",
    "this enhancement in @xmath65 relative to the density @xmath66 at the same @xmath3 coordinate is given by the pair distribution function @xmath67 , which is about 4  4.5 in the inner part of the wedge - like section for all these cases .",
    "in the region near the bottom surface , where the central particle is in contact with the main bottom layer , there is also an enhancement in density , but to much smaller extent than at the top .",
    "note that the density distribution @xmath65 near the bottom is very similar in all three cases .      to understand why the profiles differ so much in these three cases , we investigate the mean force @xmath68 that acts on a particle with its center at position @xmath3 .",
    "the potential of mean force , @xmath69 , is related to the density @xmath66 by @xmath70 , where @xmath71 , @xmath72 is boltzmann s constant , and @xmath73 the absolute temperature .",

    ", @xmath66 depends on @xmath3 only and the total force components in the @xmath4 and @xmath5 directions are zero .",
    "the mean force @xmath75 is then directed parallel to the @xmath3 axis and we have @xmath76 , where @xmath77 .",
    "thus , an understanding of the behavior of the profile can be obtained from an analysis of @xmath75 .",
    "the sign of @xmath75 tells whether @xmath66 is increasing or decreasing and extremal points of @xmath66 correspond to points where @xmath75 is zero .    for hard - sphere fluids , the forces exerted on a particle by the other particles in the system",
    "are simply due to collisions . due to planar symmetry",
    ", the density distribution in the vicinity of a particle has rotational symmetry around the @xmath3 axis through the particle center .",
    "the average force at each point is acting in the direction normal to the sphere surface and for a particle located at @xmath78 the average force from all collisions along the sphere periphery at coordinate @xmath79 is proportional to the contact density @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the contact value of the pair distribution function at the particle surface .",
    "note that the force in , for example , the @xmath4 direction on one side of the periphery is cancelled by the force in the @xmath82 direction on the opposite side .",
    "thus only the @xmath3 component of the net force on the particle contributes as expected .",
    "using the first born - green - yvon equation one can show  @xcite that @xmath83 ( the integral is over the range @xmath84 where @xmath85 is defined ) .",
    "the role of the factor @xmath86 is to project out the @xmath3 component of the contact force .",
    "( this line of reasoning is readily extended to systems exhibiting soft interaction potentials , such as lennard - jones fluids or electrolytes ; in such cases , however , one also needs to include the interactions with the walls and all other particles in the system , see e.g. refs . and . )",
    "let us now return to the intriguing formation of secondary density maxima for @xmath87 . for this purpose , we present in fig .  [ fig : ng ] the @xmath3 component of the contact forces acting on the particle .",

    "it is the subtle interplay between these forces for neighboring @xmath78 values which leads to the secondary density maximum .",
    "the situation is , however , markedly different for @xmath90 and @xmath57 .",
    "while the total force exerted by the particles in the main layer at the bottom surface is practically equal for all three cases , the magnitude of the force exerted by the particles in the main layer at the upper surface varies strongly with @xmath35 .",
    "this variation is partly due to the different magnitude of the contact densities in the wedge - like region mentioned above and partly due to the change in angle between the normal vector to the sphere surface there and the @xmath3 axis . recall that the contact force acts along this normal vector , so the @xmath3 component is dependent on this angle . for @xmath90 , fig .",
    "[ fig : ng](a ) , the @xmath3 component of the contact force from the upper layer is smaller than for @xmath88 .",
    "the sum of the arrows is then positive , i.e. the total average force is directed towards the upper wall and hence @xmath91 at this @xmath3 coordinate . for @xmath92 , fig .",

    "[ fig : schematic ] ) . with increasing @xmath78 we observe a monotonically increasing @xmath94 , which can be attributed both to the increasing area exposed to collisions on the lower half of the sphere surface and the decrease in angle of the sphere normal there relative to the @xmath3 axis . with further increase in @xmath78",
    ", we eventually observe a decrease in the exerted force induced by a decrease in contact density @xmath80 .",
    "around @xmath100 we observe a sudden onset of a rapid decrease for @xmath94 .",
    "this is a consequence of a rapid decrease in contact density , that occurs when the particle at @xmath78 loses contact with the dense particle layer at the bottom wall . for even larger @xmath78 , where the particle is close to the top surface ,",
    "collisions with particles in the slit center around the entire lower half of the sphere surface become important so that @xmath94 increases again .",

    "[ fig : sketch_fsp ] shown schematically how these force contributions act on a sphere . in the presence of only one solid - fluid interface ( l ) , the total force in the direction away from the surface ( upwards ) is @xmath149 , i.e. , the force on the bottom half of the sphere shown as red in the figure .",
    "let us now place the second surface ( u ) some distance from the other , at the location indicated in the figure .",
    "the change in the upwards force due to this second surface is given by @xmath150 in the superposition approximation .",

    "( [ eq : fup_split ] ) we have adopted this value as an approximation for the corresponding change when placing the upper wall in the presence of the lower one , i.e. , when the initial state is an inhomogeneous fluid in contact with the lower surface and the final state is a fluid simultaneously affected by both surfaces . since",
    "this approximation obviously is very good , it follows that the inhomogeneity due to one surface has only a small influence on the effects from the other surface throughout the entire slit .",
    "we saw in section  [ sec : principal_comp ] that the seemingly complicated changes in structure as the surface separation varies around half - integer @xmath0 values of @xmath35 ( i.e. , @xmath151\\sigma$ ] with @xmath152 integer ) , can be mainly explained by a parallel displacement of upward and downwards force curves along the @xmath3 direction .",
    "there was , however , some variation in these force curves near one of the surfaces ( the upper surface for the upward forces and the lower surface for the downwards forces ) that remained unexplained there . in the current section",
    "we have seen that this variation too can be mainly explained by a parallel displacement  in this case a displacement of the contributions to @xmath94 ( or @xmath95 ) due to each surface as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : f_up](c ) .    to summarize our results in this section",
    "we make two important conclusions : first , by considering the mean force due to one surface ( here the lower one ) and by treating the influence from the other ( upper ) surface as a correction @xmath129 according the the superposition approximation , one obtains nearly quantitative agreement with the full theory .",
    "our approach of defining principal components of the mean force thereby provides a means to understand the contributions of each confining surface .",
    "second , the principal force components obtained within the full theory and the superposition approximation are virtually in quantitative agreement for @xmath153 . for narrower slit widths ( down to @xmath154 ) ,",
    "quantitative discrepancies become more pronounced .",
    "these quantitative differences , which will be discussed in the next subsection , are nontrivial confinement effects .",
    "nevertheless , the semi - quantitative agreement in the whole range of slit widths , down to @xmath154 , further strengthens the notion that ordering of confined hard - sphere fluids can , to a good approximation , be explained as a single - wall phenomenon .",
    "in essence , the fluid conforms locally with only one of the confining surfaces at a time . in some local regions it will thereby conform to one surface and in other regions to the other surface",
    " regions that are continuously changing ( recall that the distributions we calculate are time averages of the various possible structures ) .",
    "we emphasize that this reasoning holds for all slit widths , irrespective of whether @xmath35 is close to an integer or a half - integer multiple of the particle diameter ( cf .",
    "[ fig : f_up ] ) .",
    "in other words , from a mechanistic point of view there is little difference between ordering in frustrated and more ordered confined hard - sphere fluids . in the latter case ,",
    "the local ordering near one surface essentially agrees with the local ordering at the other one , whereby for the density profiles there appear only small mutual effects of the ordering from both surfaces beyond what is given by superposition .",
    "an interesting similarity between the structures observed in the fluid and solid phases should be mentioned . in some of the exotic crystalline structures observed under confinement  most notably the prism - like structures  @xcite  the particles locally conform with one of the solid surfaces .",
    "this is reminiscent of the situation in the fluid phase discussed above , although in the latter case the structures are less ordered and constantly changing locally . in particular , the adaptive prism phase @xmath155 found in ref .",
    "would yield an average density profile with secondary peaks on either side of the midplane , similar of those shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ng](b ) but much sharper .",
    "the fact that the superposition approximation works surprisingly well for these rather large densities and gives a large part of the effects of confinement , means that it is simple to obtain good estimates of the density profiles for a confined fluid given an accurate density profile for a single solid - fluid interface . to obtain",
    "the latter is , however , computationally nontrivial and requires fairly advanced theories .",
    "furthermore , as we shall see below , not all important properties of the confined fluid can be explained by superposition .     and ( b ) contact density @xmath156 of hard spheres between two hard planar surfaces as functions of reduced surface separation .",
    "the system is in equilibrium with a bulk fluid of density @xmath7 [ same as in fig .",

    "however , subtle deviations in @xmath6 do remain in the superposition approximation , and these may lead to important , nontrivial confinement effects .",
    "the two most prominent nontrivial effects of confinement in , for example , fig .",
    "[ fig : n_z ] are the slit width dependence of the contact density at the walls , @xmath157 , and the total number of particles per unit area in the slit @xmath158 , which is a fundamental quantity for many properties of the confined fluid . in the following",

    "the discrepancy between the two theoretical schemes is striking ; since @xmath160 is an integrated quantity , minor systematic deviations in @xmath6 accumulate to a large effect in the total number of particles .",
    "the superposition approximation gives , for example , in the interval @xmath44 to @xmath45 an estimate of @xmath161 that is wrong by a factor that varies between 1.36 and 0.84 .",
    "we note that , e.g. , dynamic quantities such as diffusion coefficients@xcite and relaxation times@xcite in simple confined fluids have been found to scale with particle packing , as quantified by the excess entropy .",
    "consequently , a systematic error in the packing of particles ( especially for very narrow confinement ) , as evidenced by systematic quantitative differences in the number density @xmath162 and an ensuing large discrepancy in @xmath163 between the full theory and the superposition approximation , will have a substantial impact on many properties of the confined fluid obtained theoretically .",
    "[ fig : contact](b ) shows the contact density @xmath156 as a function of @xmath35 , again obtained both via the full theory and the superposition approximation .",
    "this is an important quantity , because it yields the pressure between the walls , @xmath164 , according to the contact theorem .",
    "consequently , @xmath157 is related to the net pressure acting on the confining surfaces , @xmath165 with @xmath166 denoting the bulk pressure , and hence to the extensively studied oscillatory surface forces.@xcite while the superposition approximation explains reasonably well the magnitude of @xmath157 , there is a nontrivial systematic phase shift with respect to @xmath35 of about @xmath167 .",
    "this effect has been observed by one of us ( s.s . )",

    "conversely , since there are large variations in the density profiles with surface separation , the packing is strongly altered even when the change in @xmath67 is small .",
    "the self - consistent calculation of density profiles and anisotropic pair distribution functions , as provided by integral equation theories at the pair correlation level ( like the apy theory used in this paper ) , gives efficient tools for the investigation of the structure of inhomogeneous fluids in confinement .",
    "this is exemplified in this paper by a detailed examination of the mechanism behind the packing frustration for a dense hard - sphere fluid confined between planar hard walls at short separations .",
    "when the width of the slit between the walls is close to an integer multiple of sphere diameters , the layer structure is optimal and the number density profile @xmath6 between the walls has sharp peaks . for slit widths near half - integer multiples of sphere diameters ( @xmath151\\sigma$ ] with @xmath152 integer ) ,",
    "the layer structure is much weaker and the packing frustration is large .",
    "the density profile shows considerable intricacy when the slit width is varied around these latter values .",
    "for example , when the reduced slit width @xmath35 is increased from @xmath201 , there appear secondary density peaks close to the main peaks at each wall .",
    "these secondary peaks merge into a single peak at the slit center when @xmath35 approaches @xmath45 . the mechanism behind these and other structural changes have been investigated in this paper , using the tools provided by the anisotropic pair distribution function theory .",
    "the number density profile is determined by the mean force @xmath68 on the particles in the slit via the relationship @xmath202 .",
    "for the hard - sphere fluid the mean force , which acts on a particle located at @xmath3 , originates from collisions by other particles at the surface of the former",
    ". the average collisional force on the sphere periphery is proportional to the contact density there , which varies around the surface since the fluid is inhomogeneous .",
    "the sum of the average collisional forces constitutes the mean force @xmath75 and since we have access to the pair distribution , and thereby the contact density at the sphere surface , we can investigate the origin of any variations in @xmath75 and thereby in @xmath66 . of particular interest here are the variations when the slit width is changed .    by introducing the two principal components @xmath94 and @xmath95 of @xmath75 , each of which is the sum of the average collisional forces on the particle hemisphere facing one of the walls , we extract sufficient information from the pair distributions to obtain a lucid description of the causes for the structural changes due to varying degree of packing frustration .",
    "we show that most features of the structural changes , including the appearance and merging of the secondary peaks mentioned above , can be explained by a simple parallel displacement of the @xmath94 and @xmath95 curves when the slit width is varied around half - integer @xmath0 values .",
    "the underlying reasons for this simple behavior is revealed via a detailed investigation of the pair distribution , that gives information about how the contact densities around the sphere periphery varies for different positions @xmath3 of a particle in the slit .",
    "it is found that the components @xmath94 and @xmath95 , and thereby the ordering of the fluid , are essentially governed by the packing conditions at each single solid - fluid interface .",
    "the fluid in the slit thereby conforms locally with only one of the confining surfaces at a time . in some local regions it will conform to one surface and in other regions to the other surface  regions that are constantly changing ( the calculated distributions are averages of the various possible structures ) .",
    "this picture holds for all slit widths , irrespective of whether @xmath35 is close to an integer or a half - integer multiple of the particle diameter .    as a consequence of these local packing conditions , the force components @xmath94 and @xmath95 , and thereby the total mean force @xmath203 acting on a particle in the slit ,",
    "can to a surprisingly good approximation be written as a superposition of contributions due to the presence of each individual solid - fluid interface at the walls .",
    "when the slit width is varied , this superposition can be expressed in terms of a parallel displacement of force curves due to either surface .",
    "there are , however , some important properties of the inhomogeneous fluid that can not be described by a simple superposition , but are instead determined by nontrivial confinement effects . in this paper , we exemplify such quantities by the number of particles per unit area in the slit @xmath161 , the excess adsorption @xmath160 , the contact density of the fluid at the wall surfaces @xmath204 , and the net interaction pressure between the walls @xmath205 . in the superposition approximation , @xmath161 and @xmath160 disagree to a large extent compared to the accurate values , while @xmath204 and @xmath205 are mainly off by a phase shift in their oscillations . the analysis show that these nontrivial confinement effects are due to rather delicate changes in the anisotropic pair distribution function @xmath15 when the wall separation is changed .",
