    "io is the most volcanically active body in the solar system .",
    "first viewed by voyager @xcite , observable volcanic activity revived the search for an atmosphere around io .",
    "after several years of multi - wavelength studies @xcite , it is known that a tenuous atmosphere maintained by sublimation and volcanic outgassing and composed primarily of so@xmath5 @xcite and so @xcite exists at io .",
    "this atmosphere is denser in the equatorial regions of the satellite and above active volcanic plumes @xcite .",
    "minor atmospheric species including sulfur and oxygen @xcite , the atomic by - products of so@xmath5 , and sodium @xcite have been observed at io .",
    "recently , emissions from chlorine @xcite , and nacl @xcite have also been detected in the atmosphere with inferred abundances lower than those of sulfur and oxygen .",
    "extended clouds of potassium have been reported @xcite suggesting potassium local to io , and @xcite identified potassium as the most probable source of ir emission detected in the equatorial glows , but it has not yet been confirmed in the bound atmosphere .",
    "since io s orbit around jupiter takes it into and out of the densest regions of the io plasma torus , electrons in the torus , co - rotating with jupiter s magnetic field , continually bombard io s atmosphere , collisionally exciting and ionizing atmospheric species .",
    "the excited species de - excite by emitting photons and produce a rich ultraviolet spectrum .",
    "the ionized material can be captured by the magnetic field and populates the torus .",
    "this and other loss mechanisms account for a supply of @xmath910@xmath10 amu per second from io to the jovian magnetosphere . as a result",
    ", elements observed in the atmosphere are expected to be components of the torus .",
    "likewise , species detected in the torus should be found in some form in io s atmosphere .",
    "@xcite reported the discovery of cl@xmath11 in the io plasma torus in the near infrared . from their measurements ,",
    "the abundance of chlorine ions was estimated to be 4% relative to sulfur ions , indicating a chlorine to total ion mixing ratio of 2% . for their abundance calculations",
    ", they assumed that s@xmath11 , s@xmath12 , o@xmath11 , and cl@xmath11 ions constitute 85% of the torus ion density . in a follow up study by schneider , park , & kppers ( 2000 ) , cl@xmath12 was detected at comparable levels to cl@xmath11 , implying a slightly larger chlorine to total ion mixing ratio for the torus than first estimated . in a more recent study , @xcite detected both cl@xmath11 and cl@xmath12 in a far - uv spectrum of the torus and derived a cl@xmath12 abundance of 3% relative to s@xmath12 , implying an abundance ratio of 2% for all chlorine ions to all sulfur ions , and a ratio of chlorine to all torus ions of at most 1% . in 2001 , @xcite acquired better signal to noise ratio spectra and confirmed the presence of chlorine ions in the torus , but with a 30% lower chlorine to sulfur abundance than previously inferred .",
    "this reduction in chlorine abundance observed in data acquired one year later is highly suggestive of a variable source of chlorine .",
    "ionized sodium has also been tentatively detected in the torus with a similar estimated abundance of 1% @xcite .",
    "the presence of chlorine ions in the torus has motivated the search for chlorine in the atmosphere of io .",
    "if the atmospheric abundance is similar to the @xmath131% torus abundance , then an atmospheric chlorine column density of @xmath91@xmath610@xmath14@xmath8 is implied assuming a nominal so@xmath15 column density of 1@xmath610@xmath7@xmath8 @xcite .",
    "this implies that neutral chlorine , like oxygen and sulfur , should be a detectable component of io s atmosphere .",
    "chlorine is known to be outgassed in terrestrial volcanos and thermochemical models show nacl as the dominant sodium and chlorine bearing gas in io s volcanic gases ( fegley & zolotov 2000 ; moses , zolotov , & fegley 2002b ) .",
    "this prompted a search for nacl , which was successfully detected by @xcite on both the orbital leading and trailing hemispheres of io .",
    "they inferred a disk averaged nacl abundance of 0.3% relative to so@xmath5 .",
    "some of the observed nacl emission lines are broader than the so@xmath5 emission lines , implying locally enhanced nacl or higher nacl temperatures .",
    "since nacl is seen on both hemispheres , may be locally enhanced , and has a short lifetime to photolysis , @xcite inferred that volcanic activity is the most likely source of the nacl .",
    "a variable volcanic source of chlorine could also explain the change in chlorine torus abundance reported by @xcite .    as a result of rapid nacl photolysis in io s upper atmosphere , atomic chlorine and sodium",
    "are more abundant than nacl @xcite . in an independent study of data acquired on two dates by the hubble space telescope ( hst ) space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) ,",
    "@xcite detected two chlorine emission lines in the equatorial spots of io and calculated a chlorine to oxygen abundance of 0.071% .",
    "here we present unambiguous detections of two ultraviolet multiplets of atomic chlorine present in three years of archived hst data which provide constraints on the atmospheric chlorine abundance .",
    "although the data show temporal variations over the three years of acquisition , this data set gives the most complete disk and time averaged abundances for the minor species in io s atmosphere and aids in understanding the nominal atmospheric composition .",
    "we first describe the observations and data reduction , then present the analysis of the chlorine detection , giving estimates of the relative chlorine abundances at io , and finally , discuss the implications of our findings .",
    "we utilize an extensive set of goddard high resolution spectrograph ( ghrs ) archival spectra acquired during 19941996 with the 1.74@xmath161.74@xmath17 large science aperture and g140l grating covering the spectral range 12501500 .",
    "although preliminary analyses of these data have been presented @xcite , none have been previously published .",
    "the dataset consists of 25 exposures varying in length from 6 to 26 minutes ( see table 1 for details ) .",
    "we concentrate in this paper only on the 13301420 portion of the spectrum because it contains previously unidentified features as well as known oxygen and sulfur emissions .",
    "the data are reduced in the following manner .",
    "a flux spectrum is created by co - adding 5.5 hours of data to maximize the signal to noise ratio ( snr ) .",
    "spectra from the individual dates are presented in figure 1 .",
    "large temporal variations can be seen in the data and are most likely to be caused by differences in the spatial distribution and abundance of the emitting species in io s atmosphere and the variable emission morphology @xcite driven by the interaction between io and its changing electromagnetic environment . due to these effects , the line profiles are not necessarily symmetric or well centered at the laboratory wavelength of the transition , which can result in systematic wavelength shifts .",
    "accordingly , when co - adding , the data are weighted by exposure time and aligned in wavelength using the strong ] @xmath01356 emission feature in each spectrum .",
    "the errors are determined from the observed count rate using poisson statistics and propagated through the rest of the reduction steps .",
    "a background subtraction is done to correct for an erroneous slope introduced during the original pipeline calibration in which only the four corner diodes ( which have virtually no counts ) were used to determine the detector background .",
    "the resulting spectrum is smoothed by 3 bins .",
    "a nominal full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of 3.2 for the observed features is determined by @xmath18 fitting gaussian profiles to the strongest and least blended emission multiplet in the spectrum , ] @xmath01356 .",
    "we assume this value is constant across the spectrum and use it in subsequent analysis .",
    "the reduced , co - added flux spectrum is shown in figure 2 .",
    "previously identified oxygen and sulfur emissions from the io system are noted @xcite .",
    "previously unidentified emissions are indicated by the x s in the figure .",
    "the first step in our analysis is to identify the lines present in the data by creating synthetic spectra for the 13301420 region using only the known oxygen and sulfur transitions listed in table 2 .",
    "the synthetic spectra are comprised of gaussians with fwhm of 3.2 at each of the central wavelengths of the oxygen and sulfur transitions . for identification purposes",
    "only , the relative amplitudes of the gaussians are constrained to satisfy the optically thin line ratios ( table 2 ) .",
    "next , best fit spectra are determined for the confirmed sulfur and oxygen multiplets in the data using specfit , an iraf @xmath18 minimization spectral fitting routine @xcite .",
    "the fwhm and number of gaussians to be fit in the spectral region are fixed and supplied to the program while the amplitude of each line is a free parameter , and the central wavelength of each line is restricted to a range of @xmath2 1.4 from the laboratory wavelength .",
    "this wavelength constraint is used because of the instrumental wavelength uncertainty of 0.7 and the variable observational wavelength shift mentioned above .",
    "line fluxes extracted using the best fit gaussian profiles along with the best fit central wavelengths are summarized in table 2 .",
    "our best fit to the ] @xmath01356 doublet is shown in figure 3 , with the transitions displaying a ratio of 3.3 @xmath2 0.4 to 1 , consistent with the expected optically thin ratio .",
    "the @xmath01389 and @xmath01405 spectral fits are shown in figure 4a .",
    "there are six components in the @xmath01389 multiplet and three components in the @xmath01405 multiplet ( table 2 ) .",
    "atomic data for the uv sulfur transitions are limited , especially for the @xmath01389 multiplet which has only two published oscillator strength values for the individual transitions , one theoretical @xcite and one experimental @xcite , differing by several orders of magnitude .",
    "the 3s3p@xmath19@xmath20p state of this multiplet is highly mixed , difficult to correctly represent in theoretical calculations , and in io s environment is excited by low - temperature , near - threshold electrons . because of this , neither the experimental nor the theoretical data are ideal . although both give similar line ratios , @xcite reports the experimental data @xcite which we also utilize .",
    "our observed relative strengths significantly disagree with the expected optically thin values .",
    "specifically , transitions with an upper level of @xmath21=2 , 1388 and 1396 , are 23 times larger than expected .",
    "however , our values are reasonably consistent with those observed by @xcite .",
    "what looks to be a large discrepancy between the two data sets in the relative strengths of the 1388/1389 lines is a result of blending of these two transitions .",
    "if analyzed as a pair rather than individual lines , comparable values of @xmath95 @xmath2 2 for ( 1388 + 1389)/1381 emerge .",
    "we do not attribute the disagreement between observed data from io and published atomic data for @xmath01389 to optical depth effects since the multiplet oscillator strength is 23 orders of magnitude smaller than those of other allowed sulfur multiplets and is comparable in magnitude to the forbidden lines , which do not experience self - absorption .",
    "in addition , we find that the strongest lines in the data , which are expected to be strongest in the optically thin case and hence would be most affected by optical depth , are the transitions for which the ratios are inconsistently large , in the opposite sense of optical thickness effects",
    ".    the relative strengths of the @xmath01405 multiplet also differ from the expected optically thin values , which we attribute to optical thickness effects and spectral contamination by the io plasma torus . the weakest line , 1413 , is marginally detected while the remaining lines , 1401 and 1409 , are comparable in strength , corresponding to the redistribution of line flux from the strongest line , 1401 , to the longer wavelength line , 1409 .",
    "the oscillator strength , optical thickness effects , and configuration of this multiplet resemble that of the @xmath01814 allowed multiplet in io s atmosphere which has also been interpreted to be optically thick ( feaga , mcgrath , & feldman 2002 ; mcgrath et al .",
    "2000 ; ballester et al .",
    "the ratio of 1409 to 1413 , however , is much higher than expected even in the optically thick case where 1409 is preferentially pumped by 1401 and is the result of torus emission blending with the @xmath01405 multiplet , as explained below .",
    "we investigate a feature longward of the @xmath01405 multiplet , marked with a y in figure 2 , which is detected at a snr of 5 and is coincident in wavelength with a transition at 1416.9 to determine if the multiplet , composed of 5 transitions from 13981424 , contributes to the inconsistent line ratios discussed above for the @xmath01405 multiplet . using the spectral fitting routine , and allowing the fwhm of the multiplet to differ from the emissions from io , the weak 1398 line is not detected .",
    "the 1424 line is coincident with a much stronger @xmath01429 multiplet and we do not attempt to disentangle its expected minimal contribution",
    ". fits to the remaining two lines , 1404 and 1406 , provide a better overall fit to the data , although the error bars on the 1404 line are large and contribute to the uncertainty of the @xmath01405 fluxes . the 1406 and 1417 lines",
    "are expected to be the strongest lines of ] @xmath01406 ( figure 4a ) .",
    "as detected , they have relative line strengths consistent with those found using atomic data from @xcite and observed in the io torus @xcite .",
    "we tentatively identify these emissions as originating from the io plasma torus since the ghrs field of view is larger than the disk of io and the line of sight from hst to io intersects the torus .",
    "additional emission , not associated with the oxygen and sulfur features , is obvious in figures 4 and 5 flanking the ] @xmath01356 doublet and the @xmath01389 multiplets .",
    "emission near 1335 and 1379 is seen in spectra from all 8 dates of observation ( figure 1 ) . in the co - added flux spectrum , the 1379 emission is detected at a snr of 10 ( figure 4 ) .",
    "the emission features at 1335 , 1347 , and 1363 ( figure 5 ) are detected at a snr of @xmath96 .",
    "two multiplets of chlorine occur in the 13301400  region , a dipole allowed transition , @xmath01349 , consisting of four lines and ] @xmath01386 , a forbidden transition consisting of five lines ( table 2 ) .",
    "synthetic profiles of these multiplets using optically thin line ratios are shown in figures 4b and 5b . using the same @xmath18 minimization method described above in which the amplitude is a free parameter ,",
    "wavelength is constrained , and fwhm is fixed , fits are made to these previously unidentified features and are presented in figure 4c and 5c . using data acquired by stis with higher spectral resolution but lower snr , @xcite presents the detection of one chlorine line per multiplet , 1347.2 and 1379.5 .    in the ] @xmath01386 multiplet ,",
    "lines other than 1379.5 , which is the strongest line of the multiplet accounting for more than 75% of the multiplet s total strength , are either too weak or blended with the sulfur to unambiguously identify .",
    "the component at 1373.1 is not detected , consistent with its very small strength compared to the 1379.5 line .",
    "we neglect all but the 1379.5 line in the subsequent flux analysis .",
    "the flux ratio of 1347.2 to 1363.5 in the @xmath01349 multiplet is almost a factor of 4 lower than expected in the optically thin case , indicating the redistribution of flux between the two lines .",
    "because of this , we infer that the multiplet is optically thick .",
    "the flux ratio of 1335.7/1351.7 is 2.6 , more than a factor of 5 higher than the expected optically thin value for the two @xmath01349 lines at these wavelengths .",
    "as discussed further below , we attribute the majority of the integrated flux for the 1335 feature to a factor other than optical depth effects .",
    "the 1335.7 feature of the @xmath01349 multiplet is not well fit with one gaussian of 3.2 fwhm .",
    "the best fit for a single gaussian at 1335.7 results in a line with a fwhm of 1.8 . considering the unusually high flux and the smaller fwhm of the 1335.7 feature ,",
    "we attribute the majority of the integrated flux at 1335.7 not to chlorine but to the strong @xmath01335 emission multiplet , with a component at 1335.7 , in the solar spectrum reflected from io and detected previously from both europa and ganymede @xcite .",
    "we model the reflection of the @xmath01335 multiplet from io s disk and determine that has a smaller fwhm than iogenic emissions for which the fwhm are broadened by the geometry of the equatorial spots and limb glow morphology . to correctly account for the solar carbon and iogenic chlorine contribution to 1335 , we re - fit the feature with three gaussians , two representing the 1334.5 and 1335.7 lines of with fwhm of 1.4 and one chlorine line with a fwhm of 3.2 ( figure 5c ) .",
    "these fluxes are listed in table 2 .",
    "this is the first reported detection of @xmath01335 from io , providing a unique measurement of the uv geometric albedo of the satellite at this wavelength .",
    "following @xcite , io s albedo is calculated using a weighted average of solar spectra from the uars solstice experiment @xcite acquired on the dates of hst / ghrs io observation .",
    "all observations occurred during periods of minimal solar activity . with no so@xmath5 absorption ,",
    "the best fit to the data in figure 5c gives a disk averaged geometric albedo of 0.83@xmath20.35% .",
    "however , the albedo calculation at 1335 is sensitive to the so@xmath5 column density .",
    "an so@xmath5 column density of @xmath910@xmath7@xmath8 would increase the derived albedo to 1.0% .",
    "@xcite estimate albedos of 1.5% for hst / stis data acquired in 1997 and 1.9% for 1998 by fitting the continuum between 1520  and 1700 . in this wavelength interval ,",
    "the albedo calculation is much less sensitive to the so@xmath5 column since the absorption cross section of so@xmath5 is half that at 1335 .",
    "including a latitudinally varying surface albedo and a modeled so@xmath5 column density , which when disk averaged is @xmath91@xmath610@xmath7@xmath8 , @xcite derive albedos ranging from 2.23.1% to match the mid - latitude lyman-@xmath22 measurements in the 1998 hst / stis data .",
    "an so@xmath5 column density of 3.68.0@xmath610@xmath7@xmath8 would easily bring our albedo value into agreement with those of @xcite and @xcite which is consistent with the known properties of io s so@xmath5 atmosphere @xcite .",
    "differing values of the geometric albedo estimated by @xcite and @xcite for the same data using similar so@xmath5 column densities may suggest a wavelength dependence of the uv albedo rather than measurable variations in the so@xmath5 atmosphere .",
    "we have also considered the contribution of solar resonant scattering to the @xmath01349 multiplet . as stated previously ,",
    "1335.7 is coincident in wavelength with a strong solar transition .",
    "since the 1335.7 and 1351.7 lines share the same upper level , it is possible for 1351.7 to be pumped by the strong solar carbon line at 1335.7 . including a curve of growth to account for self - absorption in our data where the @xmath01349 multiplet is optically thick , the fluorescence saturates at 0.02@xmath2310@xmath24photons@xmath25s@xmath26 .",
    "we conclude that the induced fluorescence of 1351.7 is negligible .",
    "since our data set lacks spatial information , we rely on @xcite for information about the spatial distribution of the chlorine emission at io .",
    "he finds that the emitting chlorine has similar morphology to that of atomic oxygen and sulfur , and is therefore assumed to be located at higher altitudes than the bulk of the so@xmath5 and to be excited by the same electron impact mechanism as oxygen and sulfur .",
    "this assumption allows us to give concurrent estimates of the relative abundances of these species from the same spectrum . for a transition excited by electron impact",
    ", the total measured brightness for a multiplet along the line of sight ( @xmath27 ) is related to the density of the emitting species ( @xmath28 ) , the electron density ( @xmath29 ) , and the temperature - dependent electron excitation rate coefficient ( @xmath30 ) of the multiplet : @xmath31 in calculating ratios of species detected along the same line of sight , the dependence on the electron density and line of sight conditions is removed and an approximate proportionality is established as a function of electron temperature ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "since the electron impact excitation rate coefficient is a function of electron temperature , we choose a nominal value 5 ev for @xmath32 . incorporating the @xmath01349 and ] @xmath01356 cross sections from @xcite and d. f. strobel ( 2002 , private communication ) , respectively , @xcite made detailed calculations of the rate coefficients which are adopted here ( table 3 ) .",
    "using recently published atomic data @xcite , the electron impact excitation rates for several sulfur multiplets are calculated and listed in table 3 .",
    "a liberal error estimate of 30% for the rate coefficients is propagated through the relative abundance calculations .    to achieve the best estimate of the cl / o , cl / s , and s / o abundance ratios , total measured fluxes of @xmath01349 , ] @xmath01356 , @xmath01429 , and @xmath01479 are selected for the calculation .",
    "@xmath01349 is chosen since it is the least blended chlorine multiplet and the only chorine multiplet in our data for which reliable atomic data have been published .",
    "two allowed sulfur multiplets are selected in lieu of forbidden sulfur multiplets and the contaminated @xmath01405 multiplet .",
    "@xmath01429 and @xmath01479 are dominant sulfur transitions in the spectral range of the data with high snr and better atomic data than the other sulfur multiplets .",
    "following @xcite , we assume a 40% : 60% contribution to the total 1479 flux of the individual forbidden and allowed multiplets , respectively , as they are not resolved in the ghrs data . with these fluxes and the corresponding electron rate coefficients from table 3 , we estimate and present in table 4 disk averaged abundance ratios . because of the large errors for the abundance ratios due in part to the uncertainty in the electron impact rate coefficients , the results are insensitive to @xmath32 for a range of 37 ev .",
    "to quantify the contribution of the equatorial spot emission to the total emission from io , we present the stis equatorial spot to ghrs disk averaged emission flux ratio for @xmath01349 and compare it to the spot to disk ratio of ] @xmath01356 in stis data alone .",
    "the equatorial spot flux listed in table 2 is the average flux for a single spot extracted using a 0.049 ( arcsec)@xmath33 solid angle @xcite and the disk flux is calculated from the emission contained in the 1.74@xmath17 square ghrs aperture .",
    "the equatorial spots are 25% of the total disk emission for chlorine . for comparison , an oxygen spot to disk ratio of 25%",
    "is estimated using the data from @xcite .",
    "the chlorine and oxygen spot to disk values are similar .",
    "utilizing the definition of optical depth , @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the column density and @xmath36 is the absorption cross section , and the determination of the @xmath01349 multiplet being optically thick in our data ( @xmath371 ) , a lower bound to the disk averaged chlorine column density of 2.3@xmath610@xmath38@xmath8 is implied .",
    "the chlorine absorption cross section is calculated with the oscillator strength from @xcite at a temperature of 1000 k. in the same manner , the @xmath01405 multiplet appears to be optically thick in our data giving a lower bound to the disk averaged sulfur column density of 2.4@xmath610@xmath39@xmath8 using an oscillator strength from @xcite .",
    "this result is consistent with the disk averaged sulfur column density lower bound estimated by @xcite for the @xmath01814 multiplet in iue and fos data .",
    "this independent estimate of the sulfur column density lends credence to the range of sulfur column densities found by @xcite .",
    "the s / o results presented here are in agreement with the @xcite analysis of hst / stis data .",
    "they find a disk averaged s / o brightness ratio of 1 : 0.81 when comparing the combined @xmath01479 multiplets to the ] @xmath01356 doublet . applying the 40% : 60% contribution of the forbidden and allowed multiplets @xcite , respectively , to the @xcite analysis and utilizing the rate coefficients from table 3 , their brightness ratio translates to an s / o abundance ratio of 0.10 @xmath2 0.06 .",
    "combining the s / so@xmath5 ratio of 37@xmath610@xmath40 measured at three spatially resolved locations by @xcite with our results , an estimate of the cl / so@xmath5 ratio can be made , which leads to an approximate cl / so@xmath5 abundance ratio of 3.07.0@xmath610@xmath41 ( table 4 ) .",
    "in addition , combining the o / so@xmath5 ratio of 0.05 inferred with cassini data @xcite with our results gives a cl / so@xmath5 value of 8.5@xmath610@xmath41 .",
    "recently , @xcite detected a comparable abundance of nacl with a disk averaged nacl / so@xmath5 ratio of 7@xmath610@xmath410.02 if nacl is more localized than so@xmath5 , with a preferred value of 3.5@xmath610@xmath40 ( table 4 ) .    in assessing escape rates of sodium , chlorine , and nacl from io , @xcite",
    "establish that chlorine and sodium have escape fluxes 1020 times larger than nacl .",
    "our estimated atmospheric chlorine abundance and the nacl abundance of @xcite are both 12 orders of magnitude lower than the 1% torus chlorine mixing ratio @xcite indicating that there exists an intricate relationship between the transport of volcanic gases to the upper atmosphere and escape to the torus .",
    "there may also be a higher concentration of chlorine compared to sulfur and oxygen near volcanic outflows which are at lower altitudes than we probe and would boost the overall atmospheric chlorine abundance measured in our data . in the pele - type volcanic atmospheres modeled by @xcite which include chlorine , sodium , and potassium , the initial chlorine abundance is assumed from the high chlorine torus abundance of @xcite .",
    "they do not check the sensitivity of their models to lower chlorine abundances , so we do not compare our results for chlorine .",
    "we do however compare the s / o abundance ratios .",
    "@xcite determine an equilibrium ratio of 10 for s / o , @xmath950 times larger than our data shows .",
    "this suggests that either the initial oxygen abundances in the models are too low or the disk averaged atmosphere we detect at io is dominated by prometheus - type ( so@xmath5 dominated ) outflows rather than pele - type ( sulfur dominated ) .",
    "@xcite do not check the sensitivity of their models to the initial s / o abundance .",
    "lastly , our cl / s ratio adds plausibility to the identification of solid cl@xmath5so@xmath5 or clso@xmath5 in nims / galileo spectra near the volcanic center of marduk as suggested by @xcite .",
    "unidentified absorption features are present in the infrared spectra and based on their spectroscopic arguments , cl@xmath5so@xmath5 is the favorite candidate with clso@xmath5 a potential alternative .",
    "@xcite estimate that for abundant cl@xmath5so@xmath5 formation , the gaseous [ cl-(na+k)]/s ratio in a volcanic plume needs to be larger than 0.015 , and for clso@xmath5 , the ratio must be even larger .",
    "when there is an excess of halogens as compared to alkalis , cl/(na+k ) @xmath42 1 , sulfur chlorides and oxychlorides are formed with the surplus chlorine . since volcanic outgassing",
    "is assumed to be the only source of chlorine in io s atmosphere , plumes should have at least a comparable , most likely higher , abundance of chlorine relative to the disk averaged atmosphere .",
    "for comparable cl and nacl disk averaged abundances , consistent with our data and that of @xcite , an estimated cl / na ratio of @xmath910 is shown in figure 3d of @xcite , and for our cl / s ratio of 0.1 , a cl / na ratio @xmath432 can be estimated from figure 5 of @xcite .",
    "these ratios imply that gaseous chlorine is at least twice as high in abundance as sodium .",
    "therefore , our disk averaged cl / s ratio is consistent with the requirements of @xcite for the presence of cl@xmath5so@xmath5 or clso@xmath5 .",
