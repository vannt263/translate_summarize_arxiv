    "strong / weak - coupling duality , or s - duality , exists in a number of quantum systems . in 4d gauge theories , it takes the form of electromagnetic duality , which inverts the gauge coupling and exchanges the roles of elementary charged particles and magnetic monopoles @xcite .",
    "it is realized in the simplest manner in maximally supersymmetric yang - mills ( sym ) theory @xcite . in this case , the spectrum of dyons in the coulomb phase was shown to exhibit @xmath5 duality @xcite , providing a robust evidence of s - duality .",
    "s - duality in quantum field theories has also been a cornerstone of developing string dualities @xcite . in both qft and string theory ,",
    "s - duality provides valuable insights on the strongly coupled regions of the systems .",
    "s - duality of maximal sym has many implications .",
    "in particular , this duality is related to the existence of 6d superconformal field theories called @xmath2 theories @xcite .",
    "4d maximal sym theories with gauge groups @xmath6 ,",
    "@xmath7 , @xmath8 are realized by compactifying 6d @xmath2 theories on small @xmath3 .",
    "the @xmath5 duality originates from the modular transformation on @xmath3 .",
    "on one side , this relation highlights the far - reaching implications of the 6d cfts to challenging lower dimensional systems .",
    "on the other hand , the 6d cfts lack microscopic definitions , so that s - duality can provide useful clues to better understand the mysterious 6d cfts . in this paper , we study the s - duality of the 6d @xmath2 theories compactified on finite @xmath3 , and use it to explore some interesting properties of these systems .",
    "our key observable of the 6d @xmath2 theory is the partition function of the d0-d4 system .",
    "more precisely , we study the witten index of the quantum mechanical @xmath9 gauge theory for @xmath10 d0-branes bound to @xmath11 separated d4-branes and fundamental open strings , and also study their generating function for arbitrary @xmath10 . in m - theory",
    ", this system is made of @xmath11 m5-branes wrapping @xmath0 .",
    "the d0-d4 systems describe the 6d @xmath2 cft on m5-branes in the sectors with nonzero kaluza - klein momenta . from the viewpoint of 5d super - yang - mills theory on d4-branes , this partition function",
    "is also known as nekrasov s instanton partition function @xcite .",
    "although the 5d yang - mills description of its instanton solitons is uv incomplete , the d0-d4 system provides a uv complete description for computing the instanton partition function .",
    "the results in our paper rely only on the uv complete d0-d4 quantum mechanics .",
    "the d0-d4 index was explored in @xcite . from the 5d viewpoint , this is a partition function on @xmath12 , where @xmath0 is the temporal circle for the witten index . however , with d0-branes ( yang - mills instantons ) providing the kaluza - klein ( kk ) modes of m - theory , there are evidences that this index ( multiplied by a 5d perturbative part ) is a partition function of the 6d @xmath2 scft on @xmath13 .",
    "see @xcite for the @xmath14 theories , and @xcite for the @xmath15 theories .    regarding the d0-d4 index as a 6d partition function on @xmath13 , one can naturally ask if it transforms in a simple manner under the s - duality acting on @xmath3 . in this paper",
    ", we establish the s - duality of the prepotential of this index , finding a simple anomaly of s - duality which we can naturally interpret with 6d chiral anomalies .",
    "note that the prepotential @xmath16 is the leading coefficient of the free energy @xmath17 when the so - called omega deformation is taken to zero , @xmath18 .",
    "@xmath19 and @xmath20 are coulomb vev and 5d @xmath21 mass parameter , explained in section 2 .",
    "the anomaly of s - duality takes the following form .",
    "the prepotential @xmath16 can be divided into two parts , @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is related to its s - dual prepotential by a 6d generalization of the legendre transformation .",
    "( see section 2 for details . )",
    "@xmath24 is a simple function which does not obey s - duality , thus named anomalous part .",
    "we find @xmath24 in a closed form in section 2 , which in particular is independent of the coulomb vev @xmath19 .",
    "this finding has two major implications .",
    "firstly , similar result was found for the prepotential @xmath25 of the 4d @xmath26 theory @xcite , related to our prepotential by taking the small @xmath3 limit .",
    "@xmath25 is also given by the sum @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is self s - dual . since @xmath29 is independent of @xmath19 , @xmath25 is s - dual in the seiberg - witten theory , which only sees @xmath19 derivatives of @xmath25 . in our 6d uplift ,",
    "@xmath16 appearing in the seiberg - witten theory also does not see @xmath30 for the same reason .",
    "secondly , the partition function @xmath31 itself is a witten index of the 6d theory on @xmath32 .",
    "so the full prepotential @xmath33 including the @xmath19 independent @xmath24 is physically meaningful , as the leading part of the free energy @xmath34 when @xmath35 are small . at this stage",
    ", we note our key discovery that @xmath24 contains a term proportional to @xmath4 in a suitabe large @xmath11 limit , to be explained in section 2 .",
    "in particular , we further consider the limit in which the kk modes on the circle become light .",
    "this amounts to taking the chemical potential @xmath36 conjugate to the kk momentum ( d0-brane charge ) to be much smaller than the inverse - radius of @xmath0 .",
    "the small @xmath36 limit is the strong coupling limit of the 5d yang - mills theory , or the limit in which the sixth circle decompactifies .",
    "this is the regime in which 6d cft physics should be visible .",
    "the prepotential in this limit can be computed from our anomalous s - duality , since it relates the small @xmath36 ( strong coupling ) regime to the well - understood large @xmath36 ( weak coupling ) regime .",
    "@xmath24 determines the small @xmath36 limit of the free energy , and makes it scale like @xmath4 .",
    "we also show that the term in the asymptotic free energy proportional to @xmath4 is related to the chiral anomaly of the 6d @xmath2 theory , using the methods of @xcite .",
    "these findings show that the number of 5d kk fields for d0-brane bound states grows like @xmath4 , as we decompactify the system to 6d .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section 2.1 and 2.2",
    ", we develop the anomalous s - duality of the prepotential and test it either by expanding @xmath16 in the 5d @xmath21 mass @xmath20 , or by making the ` m - string ' expansion @xcite . in section 2.3 , we discuss the 6d @xmath2 theories of @xmath15 and @xmath8 types . in section 3 ,",
    "we study the high temperature free energy and show that it scales like @xmath4 in a suitable large @xmath11 limit . in section 3.1 ,",
    "we test our result for @xmath37 theory . in section 3.2",
    ", we account for the imaginary part of the asymptotic free energy from 6d chiral anomalies .",
    "section 4 concludes with comments and future directions .",
    "we shall study the witten index of the d0-d4 quantum mechanics , consisting of @xmath10 d0-branes and @xmath11 d4-branes .",
    "this system is a quantum mechanical @xmath9 gauge theory with @xmath38 supersymmetry and @xmath6 global symmetry .",
    "see , for instance , @xcite for the details of this system . here",
    ", we shall only explain some basic aspects .",
    "the bosonic variables consist of four hermitian @xmath39 matrices @xmath40 , two complex @xmath41 matrices @xmath42 , five hermitian @xmath39 matrices @xmath43 , and a quantum mechanical @xmath9 gauge field @xmath44 . here , @xmath45 is the vector index on @xmath46 for the spatial worldvolume of the d4-branes . @xmath47 and @xmath48 are doublet indices of @xmath49 and @xmath50 respectively , which form @xmath51 rotation of @xmath46 .",
    "@xmath52 is the vector index on @xmath53 transverse to the d4-branes .",
    "when @xmath43 are all diagonal matrices , their eigenvalues are interpreted as d0-brane positions transverse to d4-branes .",
    "similarly , when @xmath54 are all diagonal , their eigenvalues are interpreted as d0-brane positions along d4-brane worldvolume . @xmath42",
    "represent internal degrees of freedom .",
    "the bosonic potential energy is given by @xmath55 ^ 2    + \\left|\\varphi^iq_{\\dot\\alpha}\\right|^2-\\frac{1}{4}[\\varphi^i,\\varphi^j]^2\\ , \\ ] ] where traces are assumed if necessary , @xmath56 is the @xmath50 triplet index .",

    "this system flows in ir to two branches .",
    "classically , they are described by two branches of moduli space satisfying @xmath60 , or @xmath61 , @xmath62=0 $ ] , @xmath63 and @xmath64=0 $ ] .",
    "the first branch is obtained by taking @xmath65 , and @xmath54 , @xmath43 to be diagonal matrices .",
    "the @xmath10 sets of eigenvalues of @xmath66 represent the positions of @xmath10 d0-branes on @xmath67 , unbound to the d4-branes .",
    "the second branch is obtained by taking @xmath68 , and @xmath42 , @xmath54 to satisfy @xmath61 .",
    "after modding out by the @xmath9 gauge orbit , one can show that this branch is described by @xmath69 real parameters .",
    "the two branches meet at @xmath68 , @xmath65 . far away from this intersection ,",
    "each branch is described by a nonlinear sigma model ( nlsm ) on its moduli space .",
    "we are interested in the second branch , describing 6d cft on m5-branes in the sector with @xmath10 units of kk momentum .",
    "the witten index of the second branch can be computed easily by deforming the system by a fayet - iliopoulos ( fi ) parameter , shifting @xmath57 in ( [ adhm ] ) by three constant @xmath70 .",
    "after this deformation , the first branch becomes non - bps , since @xmath65 can not solve @xmath61 with @xmath71 .",
    "so the witten index acquires contributions only from the second branch .",
    "one can understand the second branch from the low energy field theory of d4-branes , the 5d maximal sym theory .",
    "d0-branes are realized in yang - mills theory as instanton solitons , classically described by finite energy stationary solutions of the following bps equation , @xmath72 the finite energy solutions are labeled by the instanton number @xmath10 , defined by @xmath73 we shall consider d0-branes rather than anti - d0-branes , with @xmath74 , equivalently ( [ self - dual ] ) with @xmath75 sign .",
    "@xmath10 corresponds to the rank of the @xmath9 gauge group of the quantum mechanics .",
    "the solutions of @xmath61 , modded out by the @xmath9 gauge orbit , provides the moduli space of self - dual instantons .",
    "the nlsm on the second branch can be obtained by the moduli space approximation of the instanton solitons . however",
    ", this moduli space is known to be singular , having the so - called small instanton singularities . due to these singularities ,",
    "the nlsm description is incomplete , and needs a uv completion .",
    "this is naturally interpreted as inheriting the uv incompleteness of the 5d yang - mills description .",
    "although we do not know how to uv complete the full 5d sym , the nlsm can be uv completed to the @xmath9 quantum mechanics .",
    "we shall study the d0-d4 system in the coulomb phase , with scalar vacuum expectation value ( vev ) . for @xmath6 theories ,",
    "the vev is parametrized by constant @xmath76 diagonal matrices @xmath77 . in the d0-d4 system",
    ", @xmath78 deforms the bosonic potential @xmath79 as @xmath55 ^ 2    -\\frac{1}{4}[\\varphi^i,\\varphi^j]^2+\\left|    \\varphi^iq_{\\dot\\alpha}-q_{\\dot\\alpha}\\phi^i\\right|^2\\ .\\ ] ] the @xmath11 eigenvalues of @xmath78 correspond to the positions of @xmath11 d4-branes on @xmath53 .",
    "we shall separate the d4-branes along a line , giving nonzero vev to @xmath80 only . in this setting",
    ", we shall study the bps bound states of the d0-branes and the fundamental open strings stretched along the @xmath80 direction , suspended between a pair of d4-branes .",
    "the bound states preserve @xmath81 hermitian supercharges . in 6d @xmath2 theory , we compactify a spatial direction on a circle with radius @xmath82 .",
    "the bps states saturate the bound @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is the energy , and @xmath85 is the quantized momentum on @xmath0 which is @xmath10 in the d0-d4 system .",
    "@xmath86 are the @xmath11 eigenvalues of the scalar @xmath80 , and @xmath87 s are the @xmath88 electric charges in the coulomb branch , satisfying @xmath89 . from the 6d viewpoint , they are the self - dual strings with charges @xmath87 coming from open m2-branes , with @xmath85 units of momenta on them .",
    "we also define @xmath90 , which is the ( dimensionless ) energy on the self - dual strings .",

    "the measure is chosen so that it commutes with @xmath95 of the @xmath81 hermitian supercharges preserved by the bps states , or a complex supercharge @xmath96 and its conjugate @xmath97 . see @xcite for the details .",
    "one also finds that @xmath98 .",
    "since only the states saturating the bps bound @xmath99 contribute to the index , @xmath31 is independent of @xmath100 . with @xmath101 understood , the factor @xmath102 weights the bps states with the momentum @xmath85 along the circle .",

    "@xmath107 comes from the zero modes at @xmath108 , the perturbative open string modes on the d4-branes .",
    "this factor can also be understoood as coming from the perturbative partition function of the 5d maximal sym .",

    "secondly , let us discuss how @xmath19 should transform .",
    "in 4d , we already stated that @xmath293 naturally appears on the left hand side of ( [ 4d - s - dual ] ) . for simplicity ,",
    "let us discuss these variables in the limit of large coulomb vev , @xmath294 , @xmath295 .",
    "the second term can be ignored in this limit , yielding the semi - classical result @xmath296 . in this limit",

    "the real part of @xmath19 is the vev of the real scalar in the 6d self - dual tensor multiplet , which is noncompact . on the other hand ,",
    "the imaginary part of @xmath19 comes from the holonomy of the 2-form tensor field @xmath297 on @xmath3 , implying that it is a periodic variable .",

    "the second term of @xmath24 is one of the key findings of this paper , which comes from the charged part of the partition function . after replacing @xmath323 , and multiplying @xmath324 to the above @xmath24 to get to the conventionally normalized prepotential",
    ", one can take the 4d limit of @xmath24 .",
    "the second term proportional to @xmath325 vanishes in the 4d limit @xmath219 , as it is proportional to @xmath326 .    with the motivations and results given , we now properly set up the calculation and show the claims made above . as in 4d",
    ", we decompose the 6d prepotential as @xmath327 where @xmath328 .",
    "the prepotential is s - dual if it satisfies @xmath329 we first study the structures of this equation , before showing that it is satisfied by our @xmath23 .",
    "firstly , replacing @xmath16 by @xmath330 , one can check that s - duality trivially holds at the classical level : @xmath331    = -\\pi i\\tau v^2    = f_{\\rm cl}(\\tau , v)-v\\frac{\\partial f_{\\rm cl}}{\\partial v}(\\tau , v)\\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath332 is replaced by its classical value @xmath333 ( formally at @xmath334 ) .",
    "now we subtract ( [ s - dual-5d ] ) by ( [ s - dual - classical ] ) to find the following condition for the quantum prepotential @xmath163 : @xmath335 we are going to study the last equation .",
    "note again that the effective action in the coulomb branch only contains @xmath194 derivatives of @xmath16 , or @xmath163 .",
    "thus , in seiberg - witten theory , @xmath163 is ambiguous by addition of @xmath194 independent functions , possibly depending on @xmath217 and @xmath20 .",
    "however , the s - duality requirement ( [ s - dual - requirement ] ) is sensitive to the value of @xmath163 , including the @xmath194 independent part .",
    "so when one tries to establish the s - duality of the coulomb branch effective action , one should have in mind that one may have to add suitable coulomb vev independent terms to @xmath163 computed microscopically from @xmath31 .",
    "following @xcite , we shall establish the s - duality ( [ s - dual - requirement ] ) and its anomaly ( [ s - dual - anomaly ] ) by expanding @xmath163 in the mass @xmath20 when it is small enough .",
    "we shall still get an exact statement ( [ s - dual - anomaly ] ) , which we check for certain orders in @xmath20 .",
    "one should however have in mind that the exact statement ( [ s - dual - anomaly ] ) may be valid only within a finite region of @xmath336 in the complex planes . in section 2.2",
    ", we shed more lights on the exactness of ( [ s - dual - anomaly ] ) , by making an m - string expansion @xcite .",
    "as studied in the 4d limit @xcite , there is a natural way of achieving the s - duality requirement ( [ s - dual - requirement ] ) .",
    "this is to require that @xmath163 is expanded in quasi - modular forms of suitable weights . to precisely explain its meaning , we first expand @xmath163 in @xmath20 as @xmath337",
    "this series makes sense as follows .",
    "firstly , the @xmath338 limit exhibits enhanced maximal supersymmetry .",
    "so at @xmath339 , the classical prepotential @xmath340 acquires no quantum corrections , meaning that @xmath163 vanishes at @xmath339 .",
    "also , the prepotential is an even function of @xmath20 , which restrict the expansion as above . in the perturbative part , which is easiest to see from the 4d limit ( [ 4d - fpert ] ) .",
    "however , we shall expand @xmath341 as ( [ m - series ] ) , while the term @xmath342 is moved to @xmath24 . ] then , following @xcite , we require that @xmath343 is a quasi - modular form of weight @xmath344 , which means the following .",
    "quasi - modular forms are polynomials of the first three eisenstein series @xmath345 , @xmath346 , @xmath347 , where each series has weight @xmath348 respectively under s - duality in the following sense : @xmath349 more concretely , they are given by @xmath350 higher eisenstein series @xmath351 are polynomials of @xmath352 with weight @xmath353 . to study the quasi - modular property , it is helpful to decompose their dependence on @xmath217 into the dependence through @xmath345 and the dependence through @xmath352 .",

    "this is equivalent to @xmath357 we now investigate how quasi - modularity is related to the s - duality ( [ s - dual - requirement ] ) .",
    "one can make ( [ quasi - modular ] ) to be equivalent to ( [ s - dual - requirement ] ) by specifying the @xmath345 dependence of @xmath163 , which we now turn to .",

    "by applying ( [ quasi - modular ] ) to @xmath358 , one obtains @xmath359 where again recall that @xmath356 . combining this with ( [ s - dual - requirement ] ) , one obtains @xmath360 we want to make this equation to hold , by specifying a particular @xmath345 dependence of @xmath163 .",
    "@xcite showed that the desired @xmath345 dependence is @xmath361 for the sake of completeness , we repeat the logics presented in @xcite and expand it to make a proof . in fact , we shall make a stronger claim than needed .",

    "one finds that @xmath364 so at @xmath365 and @xmath366 orders , one finds that it agrees with the right hand side if ( [ modular - anomaly ] ) is met .    now assuming ( [ modular - anomaly ] )",

    "is equivalent to ( [ s - dual - v2 ] ) , since the @xmath372 component is the only information lost by taking @xmath363 derivative .",
    "however , we have already shown around ( [ zeroth - first ] ) that the @xmath372 component of ( [ s - dual - v2 ] ) is satisfied . therefore , showing ( [ derivative - s - dual - v2 ] ) will be equivalent to showing ( [ s - dual - v2 ] ) .",
    "so will show ( [ derivative - s - dual - v2 ] ) by assuming ( [ modular - anomaly ] ) .",
    "we take @xmath363 derivative of @xmath373 at fixed @xmath374 . again using ( [ modular - anomaly ] ) , one obtains @xmath375 so if @xmath373 is zero at a particular value of @xmath363 , ( [ 2nd - derivative ] ) guarantees that it is zero at different values of @xmath363 .",
    "since we already checked around ( [ zeroth - first ] ) that ( [ s - dual - v2 ] ) is true up to @xmath376 , we have shown that ( [ derivative - s - dual - v2 ] ) holds at @xmath372 , or that @xmath377 at @xmath378 .",
    "this establishes that ( [ modular - anomaly ] ) implies ( [ derivative - s - dual - v2 ] ) , and in turn that ( [ modular - anomaly ] ) implies ( [ s - dual - v2 ] ) . finally , we insert @xmath362 .    to summarize till here , ( [ s - dual - v2 ] ) holds if @xmath163 satisfies ( [ modular - anomaly ] ) .",

    "following and extending @xcite , we show that the prepotential @xmath163 obeys the two properties ( [ quasi - modular ] ) , ( [ modular - anomaly ] ) , up to an anomalous part which is independent of the coulomb vev @xmath194 . again following @xcite",

    "therefore , while fixing the integration constants and @xmath386 in @xmath341 by using the low order @xmath233 expansion coefficients of @xmath163 , it suffices to use @xmath163 up to the addition of any convenient expression independent of @xmath194 .",
    "so for technical reasons , we shall fit these integration constants and @xmath386 by comparing @xmath341 with @xmath388 rather than @xmath163 itself .",

    "we start the recursive contruction by determining @xmath386 .",

    "the non - local part comes from the 5d perturbative maximal sym .",
    "there is additional difficulty in using the derivative expansion in our setting , since some of our background fields are proportional to @xmath883 , which may spoil the orderings provided by the derivative expansion .",
    "so it appears tricky to directly employ the formalism of @xcite .",
    "however , one can study the imaginary part ( [ imaginary ] ) of our asymptotic free energy using the 5d approach .",

    "then the 5d effective action is real , since hermiticity is not broken in the lorentzian theory .",
    "now we wick - rotate the ` time ' direction in this 5d setting .",
    "since all background fields are real , the only possible step which may cause complex effective action is the wick rotation to euclidean 5d space . here , note that we are seeking for an effective action of the vectors @xmath884 ( spin connection ) , tensor @xmath873 , and scalars @xmath880 , @xmath298 . to compute the imaginary part , one can focus on the local terms .",
    "this is because the nonlocal terms come from the determinant of 5d maximal sym whose fields are covariantized by real background fields , which is real . among the local terms obtained from scalar lagrangian density",
    ", we should seek for terms containing the tensor @xmath885 to obtain imaginary contribution after wick rotation .",
    "it should be contracted with antisymmetric tensors formed by the background fields .",
    "there are many possibilities , arranged in derivative expansion .",
    "for instance , there could complicated terms like @xmath886 , and so on .",
    "although there are many terms , let us comment that there can be gauge invariant terms and gauge non - invariant terms in the imaginary action .",
    "the latter class should exist because the 5d effective action should realize 6d chiral anomalies .",
    "the coefficients of the terms in the latter class are thus completely determined by known 6d anomalies @xcite . among the gauge invariant terms",
    ", there can be action coming from gauge invariant lagrangian density , like the term that we illustrated in the last paragraph .",
    "finally , there may be chern - simons terms in which lagrangian densities are not gauge invariant but their integrals are .",

    "@xmath890 consists of the gauge invariant chern - simons terms .",
    "@xmath891 is part of the gauge non - invariant chern - simons terms that comes from @xmath892 normal bundle anomaly in 6d , namely the first term @xmath893 of ( [ anomaly - pol - reduced ] ) .",

    "plugging in these values , one obtains @xmath902 the parenthesis consists of the fields reduced from 6d metric ( [ 6d - metric ] ) . note that , after plugging in constant @xmath880 and @xmath901 , all terms should be formally gauge invariant in the remaining fields .",
    "this is because the only possible gauge non - invariant terms @xmath900 , completely dictated by anomaly , also become gauge invariant like @xmath903 with constant @xmath880 .",
    "now we note the fact that , in the 6d metric , all @xmath867 coordinates of @xmath46 are multiplied by @xmath865 .",
    "so in the parenthesis of ( [ imaginary - reduced ] ) , the only @xmath904 s not associated with @xmath865 are derivatives .",
    "so one makes a formal derivative expansion of this term , assigning the ` mass dimensions ' @xmath905=0 $ ] , @xmath906=0 $ ] , @xmath907=0 $ ] , @xmath908=1 $ ] .",
    "the lowest order term comes in two derivatives , and is proportional to @xmath909 .",
    "there can be no other gauge - invariant terms at this order .",
    "this term indeed yields the desired @xmath313 scaling .",
    "firstly , the integral @xmath910 can be scaled into @xmath911 times a measure depending on @xmath912 .",
    "also , two derivatives in @xmath909 can also be scaled with @xmath913 , yielding another overall factor @xmath914 .",
    "@xmath867 in the remaining integral appear in the combination @xmath912 , including the integration variable , so is independent of @xmath865 .",
    "so this term yields the right scaling @xmath915 .",
    "therefore , to compute ( [ imaginary - normal ] ) , we only need to consider those terms that reduce to @xmath916 upon plugging in our background .",
    "this implies that one does not have to consider @xmath897 of ( [ 5d - derivative ] ) , since they are associated with local lagrangian density and can not provide terms like ( [ cs - leading ] ) .",
    "so we only consider @xmath895 and @xmath900 of ( [ 5d - derivative ] ) . unlike the coefficients of @xmath900 , coefficients of @xmath895",
    "can not be determined with our limited knowledge of the 6d theory .",
    "so even after restricting our interest to the imaginary part ( [ imaginary ] ) of the effective action , we can not compute them all due to our ignorance on these coefficients . since the second term of @xmath890 is quadratic in @xmath879",
    ", we can not compute the @xmath917 term of ( [ imaginary ] ) .",
    "this is why we shall not need the mixed anomaly contributions in @xmath891 coming from the term @xmath918 in ( [ anomaly - pol - reduced ] ) , which will also yield a contribution at @xmath917 , since knowing them is incomplete to compute the whole @xmath917 contributions .",
    "also , the @xmath919 term can not be computed since we do not know @xmath920 .",
    "however , the chern - simons terms that are quartic in @xmath879 and @xmath880 are completely dictated by 6d anomalies , as shown on the second line of ( [ 5d - derivative ] ) .",
    "note that quartic chern - simons term is allowed precisely because we allow gauge non - invariant chern - simons term , to match 6d anomalies which are fourth order in the fields .",
    "thus , we can compute ( [ imaginary - normal ] ) from @xmath891 of ( [ 5d - derivative ] ) .",
    "note also that , for imaginary chemical potentials , we have found earlier in this section that @xmath698 undergoes phase transitions due to massless particles .",
    "this only changes @xmath919 or lower order terms , so that the @xmath391 order that we are going to compute is unaffected .",
    "we also note in passing that , we can turn the logic around and use our d0-d4 results to constrain the 5d effective action .",
    "namely , we know from our d0-d4 calculus the @xmath917 and @xmath919 coefficients of @xmath921 , and also the vanishing of the @xmath922 coefficient",
    ". this knowledge can be used to constrain @xmath923 of ( [ 5d - derivative ] ) .",
    "this information may be useful for studying other high temperature partition functions of the 6d @xmath2 theories .",
    "coming back to the computation of ( [ imaginary - normal ] ) , we plug @xmath924 and @xmath881 into @xmath891 of ( [ 5d - derivative ] ) to obtain @xmath925 to compute this , one should evaluate the gravi - photon chern - simons term , @xmath926 where @xmath927 , with @xmath928 being the cartesian coordinates of @xmath46 . since @xmath929 , @xmath930 , ( [ adada ] ) becomes @xmath931 where @xmath932 , @xmath933 .",
    "so one obtains @xmath934 where we plugged in @xmath888 .",
    "this precisely agrees with ( [ imaginary - normal ] ) , based on d0-d4 calculus .",
    "finally , let us comment that the same calculation can be done to test some part of ( [ ade - asymp ] ) for all ade theories",
    ". for ade , ( [ ade - asymp ] ) yields the imaginary part @xmath935 simply by changing the coefficient @xmath936 from ( [ ade - asymp ] ) . on the other hand , the anomaly polynomial ( [ anomaly - u(n ) ] )",
    "is replaced by the following polynomial @xmath937 for ade . again after restricting @xmath938 to @xmath833 , the term @xmath835 of ( [ anomaly - pol - reduced ] ) is replaced by @xmath939 .",
    "so the calculations of this subsection can be done by replacing all @xmath4 by @xmath940 , completely reproducing ( [ seff - ade ] ) .",
    "in this paper , we explored s - duality of the prepotential of the 6d @xmath2 theories compactified on @xmath3 , on the coulomb branch .",
    "we found evidences of s - duality and its anomaly . using this result , we computed the asymptotic free energy of this system compactified on @xmath0 ( in the index version ) , when the omega background parameters @xmath166 and the chemical potential @xmath36 conjugate to the kk momentum are small .",
    "the asymptotic free energy is proportional to @xmath4 in a suitable large @xmath11 limit , showing that the light kk fields exhibit the @xmath4 degrees of freedom .",
    "after suitably complexifying the chemical potentials , we showed that the imaginary part of the free energy proportional to @xmath4 is completely reproduced from the 6d chiral anomaly of the @xmath654 r - symmetry .",
    "most results are generalized to the ade class of @xmath2 theories .    in the literatures ,",
    "the @xmath4 scalings of various observables of 6d @xmath2 theory have been found , using various approaches .",
    "thermal entropy of black m5-branes @xcite or various other quantities are computed from the gravity dual .",
    "chiral anomalies are computed from the anomaly inflow mechanism @xcite .",
    "the supersymmetric casimir energy on @xmath941 was computed from the superconformal index @xcite .",
    "perhaps among these , the mysteries of 6d cft may be most directly addressed from the thermal partition function calculus of @xcite .",
    "so it would be desirable to have a microscopic view of this phenomenon by directly counting states of the 6d cfts .",
    "as far as we are aware of , such a direct account for @xmath4 scaling of states has not been available from a mircroscopic quantum calculus yet .",
    "our studies show the @xmath4 scalings of the microscopically counted degrees of freedom .",
    "more precisely , we compactified the 6d scft on @xmath0 , so @xmath4 degrees of freedom are absent at low energy .",
    "however , at high temperature compared to the inverse - radius of the circle , we expect the 6d cft physics to be visible , hopefully in our @xmath16 .",
    "one subtlety is that fermionic states are counted with minus sign in the index , so there may be cancelation between bosons and fermions . even after this possible cancelation , we find that the uncanceled free energy still exhibits @xmath4 scaling , which proves that the 6d cft has @xmath4 degrees of freedom .",
    "we have provided an alternative study of the asymptotic free energy based on 6d chiral anomalies , which completely agrees with our d0-d4 calculus .",
    "our studies based on d0-d4 system also shows that the light d0-brane particles are responsible for the uv enhancement of degrees of freedom . since d0-branes are the key objects which construct m - theory at strong coupling limit of the type iia strings , it is natural to see that they are also responsible for the @xmath4 degrees of freedom of the 6d @xmath2 theory .",
    "it will be interesting to better understand the the single particle index @xmath942 which yields this behavior .",
    "in particular , conjectures on instanton partons @xcite may be addressed in more detail .",
    "the coulomb branch partition function on @xmath13 was used as building blocks of interesting cft indices in the symmetric phase .",
    "we comment that our asymptotic free energy proportional to @xmath4 does not appear in these symmetric phase indices .",
    "let us explain this with the 6d superconformal index , and the dlcq index .",
    "firstly , it has been proposed that the d0-d4 partition function , or more precisely this partition function multiplied by the 5d perturbative part , is a building block for the 6d superconformal indices @xcite on @xmath943 .",
    "so one might wonder whether our finding @xmath944 ( with @xmath945 ) at high temperature has implications to the supercofonrmal index .",
    "one can immedidately see that the answer is negative . for this discussion ,",
    "the relevant formula is presented in @xcite , which uses the product of @xmath946 copies of coulomb branch partition functions on @xmath13 as the integrand .",
    "the angular momentum chemical potentials of @xmath947 on @xmath941 are labeled by three numbers @xmath948 satisfying @xmath949 . in this",
    "setting , the @xmath946 sets of omega deformation parameters are given by @xmath950 , @xmath951 , @xmath952 respectively . since the asymptotic formula for @xmath31 is obtained in the limit of small @xmath35 , one can study the superconformal index in the limit of small @xmath948 . in this limit ,",
    "the most divergent part in @xmath166 is given by @xmath953\\ .\\ ] ] it is an identity that the sum in the square bracket vanishes , so that the leading asymptotic part proportional to @xmath4 vanishes on @xmath943 .",
    "so our @xmath698 has no implication to the superconformal index .",
    "however , study of the the subleading part @xmath954 will be interesting , along the lines of our section 2.2 .",
    "we hope to come back to this problem in the near future .",
    "secondly , the m5-brane theory compactified on a lightlike circle can be studied using the d0-d4 quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "its index at dlcq momentum @xmath10 can be computed by integrating the d0-d4 index in the coulomb branch suitably with the coulomb vev @xmath194 , as explained in @xcite .",
    "so one finds ( again with @xmath955 ) @xmath956\\ .\\ ] ] here , unlike the partition function on @xmath13 , where we have notion of multi - particles so that @xmath957 itself is meaningful as the singe particle index , the dlcq index is defined with a confining harmonic potential on @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "thus , the exponent can not be physically meaningful separately . also , the definition of @xmath958 is such that @xmath959 has to be real and bigger than other fugacities , as @xmath960 plays the role of main convergence parameter .",
    "so one has to set @xmath530 .",
    "this implies that @xmath958 does not exhibit exponential growth , but is rather highly suppressed at small @xmath36 , presumably due to boson / fermion cancelation .",
    "omega deformed partition functions can also be used to study 6d @xmath962 superconformal field theories .",
    "in fact , for many 6d @xmath962 systems , the index on @xmath13 is known in the ` self - dual string expansion , ' similar to the m - string expansion explained in our section 2.2 .",
    "the coefficients like @xmath463 of section 2.2 are elliptic genera of 2d cfts for the 6d self - dual strings in the tensor branch .",
    "those elliptic genera have been studied for various 6d @xmath962 theories @xcite .",
    "the s - duality anomaly and the high temperature asymptotic free energies could be studied using the approaches explored in this paper .",
    "this may be an interesting approach to explore the rich physics of 6d cfts and their compactifications to 5d/4d .",
    "it would also be interesting to further study the s - duality of the full index of the @xmath2 theory , based on some ideas sketched in our section 2.2 .",
    "following @xcite , we find it interesting to study the wilson/t hooft line defects uplifed to 6d surface operators .",
    "s - dualities of other defect operators should also be interesting .",
    "finally , one may ask if a suitable m2-brane partition function on @xmath963 can exhibit @xmath964 scaling , where @xmath965 is the omega deformation parameter .",
    "although this scaling has been microscopically computed from the @xmath556 partition function , or the entanglement entropy , perhaps better physical intuitions can be obtained by directly accounting for where such degrees of freedom come from , like we did for 6d scfts on @xmath0 from d0-branes ( instanton solitons ) .",
