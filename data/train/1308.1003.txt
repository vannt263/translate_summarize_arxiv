    "<S> akemann , ipsen and kieburg recently showed that the squared singular values of products of @xmath0 rectangular random matrices with independent complex gaussian entries are distributed according to a determinantal point process with a correlation kernel that can be expressed in terms of meijer g - functions . </S>",
    "<S> we show that this point process can be interpreted as a multiple orthogonal polynomial ensemble . </S>",
    "<S> we give integral representations for the relevant multiple orthogonal polynomials and a new double contour integral for the correlation kernel , which allows us to find its scaling limits at the origin ( hard edge ) . </S>",
    "<S> the limiting kernels generalize the classical bessel kernels . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath1 they coincide with the scaling limits found by bertola , gekhtman , and szmigielski in the cauchy - laguerre two - matrix model , which indicates that these kernels represent a new universality class in random matrix theory . </S>"
