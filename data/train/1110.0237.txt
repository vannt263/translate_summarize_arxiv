    "the merging of two co - rotating vortices is an essential phenomenon in transitional and turbulent flows and as a result , has emerged as a `` canonical '' problem in the fluid dynamics literature .",
    "it seems to be the `` simplest '' problem whose evolution involves the interplay between the two key terms in the equations of motion   for incompressible flows .",
    "first is the _ convective _ term given by @xmath57 in the vorticity form of the navier - stokes equations , second is the _ viscous _ term given by @xmath58 . of course both operate simultaneously in evolving the initial configuration , through the transients , to the final lamb - oseen state . the convective term is usually thought of as being responsible for aspects of merging such as filamentation and stretching ( inviscid aspects ) , while the viscous term is of course responsible for the ultimate diffusive merging .",
    "previous works on vortex merging can be categorized into symmetric versus asymmetric vortex pairs , or inviscid versus viscous fluid model .",
    "the related results are briefly described here in roughly chronological order .",
    "earlier studies mainly focused on mergers in inviscid fluid , i.e. solving the euler equations .",
    "saffman & szeto  @xcite found the critical separation between the symmetric vortex pair by solving for steady equilibrium shapes of the contour of uniform vorticity patches ( sometimes also referred to as _ rankine _ patches ) .",
    "overman & zabusky  @xcite confirmed saffman & szeto s result using contour dynamics for the symmetric uniform patches , and determined which vortex `` wins '' for the asymmetric vortex pair ( a point vortex and an extended uniform patch ) .",
    "dritschel  @xcite used a contour surgery method to study symmetric uniform patches and linked shape stability to the energy of the system .",
    "he also , for the first time , showed the importance of separatrices of the streamlines in a co - rotating reference frame for the point vortex model .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite studied both the symmetric and asymmetric mergers of uniform patches .",
    "they juxtaposed the results of a high resolution pseudo - spectral method to solve the euler equations with a hyper - viscosity term ( @xmath59 ) and a low order moment model . in the co - rotating frame , they described flow regions bounded by the separatrices of the streamlines , namely , the _ core regions _ around the vortices , an _ exchange band _ that entraps the cores , and the region outside the exchange band .",
    "they also noted the `` ghost '' vortices on the vertical axis in the co - rotating frame , which appear due to the eccentric nature of the flow field generated by the vortex pair .",
    "dritschel & waugh  @xcite used contour dynamics to study asymmetric uniform patches with the same vorticity density , and identified 5 flow regimes of vortex interaction depending on area ratio and separation of vortices : elastic interaction , partial straining - out , complete straining - out , partial merger and complete merger .",
    "yasuda & flierl  @xcite studied the same problem , but added one more parameter to vary  vorticity density ratio , and confirmed the categorization of the 5 flow regimes .",
    "ehrenstein & rossi  @xcite studied contour dynamics for both symmetric and asymmetric cases , but instead of uniform vorticity patches , they focused on gaussian - like patches with compact support .",
    "they noticed the critical distance of merging in this case is less than that for uniform patches .    in 2001 , amoretti _ et al . _",
    "@xcite compared an electron - plasma experiment and a particle - in - cell numerical simulation of the euler equations for an asymmetric setup ",
    "a point vortex and an uniform patch . in the same year",
    ", meunier & leweke  @xcite conducted water tank experiments to study the instability of 3d vortex pairs , which provided remarkable insight to the 2d problem as well .",
    "they described the merging of a symmetric pair as 3 stages based on the separation and core size of the vortices ( defined by the maximum azimuthal velocity ) : ( i ) the separation between vortices remains almost constant and the core size grows like a gaussian diffusion ; ( ii ) when the core size grows to about 30% of the separation distance , filamentation becomes much more obvious , and the two vortices merge ; ( iii ) the merged vortices diffuse like a gaussian again .",
    "they also mentioned that a complete merge always occurs in a viscous flow , which is evident from  @xcite since a gaussian is the eventual solution of any vorticity field .",
    "later , le dizs & verga  @xcite performed direct numerical simulation of the evolution of initial gaussian vortices using a spectral method , and analyzed the local eccentricity around vortices before the merging starts .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite compared their water tank experimental result and analytical result ( continuation analysis of an equilibrium solution for the euler equations with initial symmetric gaussian patches ) , and obtained an expression for the separation distance as a function of time and reynolds number .",
    "cerretelli & williamson  @xcite conducted an experiment of symmetric vortex merger shed from the trailing edge of a wing in water tank , and analyzed the flow field in the co - rotating frame to explain the physical mechanism of merging .",
    "they convincingly identified 4 stages of the merging process ( their figure 4 ) at reynolds number 530 : ( i ) the first diffusive stage , ( ii ) the convective stage , ( iii ) the second diffusive stage ( which was not clearly noticed in meunier & leweke  @xcite ) , and ( iv ) the merged diffusive stage .",
    "they superimposed separatrices of streamlines in a co - rotating frame , as well as vorticity contours , and noted the clear correlation between them .",
    "more importantly , they decomposed the vorticity field into a _",
    "symmetric _ part ( two gaussians ) and an _ antisymmetric _ part ( a vortex quadrupole ) , and concluded the first diffusive stage is primarily responsible for spreading the initially confined concentrated vorticity profile to an outer _ recirculation _ region of the flow whose velocity field redistributes the vorticity to form two pairs of weaker vortex dipole structures ( i.e. a quadrupole ) which by its nature pushes the centers of the original stronger vortices together .",
    "then , the second and merged diffusive stages act to finish job .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite confirmed cerretelli & williamson s result with a water tank experiment and a spectral method in direct numerical simulation , and also emphasized that the merging time changes with reynolds number .",
    "velasco fuentes  @xcite used a vortex - in - cell method to study uniform symmetric patches in inviscid flow , and concluded that filamentation is not the reason for merging , but merely a result of the process .",
    "he also brought up a point that has often been overlooked in the literature : the difference between the lagrangian and eulerian points of view in the merging problem , i.e. between trajectories of passive particles ( dye , or weak vorticity ) and streamlines  especially separatrices  in a rotating frame . trieling _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite revisited the asymmetric merger problem using contour dynamics in inviscid flow . instead of focusing on an equilibrium analysis like some of the previous studies , they showed a comparison between the simulation and electron - plasma and water tank experiments during the transient stage of merging .",
    "the dye visualization of the water tank experiment for different circulation ratios ( their figure  15 ) is especially worth mentioning .",
    "more recently , brandt & nomura  @xcite performed high fidelity directly numerical simulation of the navier - stokes equations using a pesudo - spectral method for both symmetric and asymmetric mergers , and related the merging process to the strain field generated by the deformed vortices .",
    "they once again pointed out the importance of the comparison between the vorticity contours and streamlines in a co - rotating frame .",
    "although different studies focused on pinpointing the distinct roles played by the convective and diffusive terms , in reality , both terms operate simultaneously . untangling the `` order '' in which their presence is felt in our mind is not a well defined problem , and is analogous to answering a `` chicken vs. egg '' question . among the many complications in elucidating these issues separately is the fact that they depend on the reynolds number associated with the system  @xcite .",
    "our low - dimensional model described in this paper captures well the first diffusive stage , the second diffusive stage , and the merged diffusive stage described in cerretelli & williamson  @xcite , but can not generate quadrupole vorticity structures , hence does not capture the essential feature of the convective merging stage . by this , we do not mean to imply that the model ignores all convective ( inviscid ) aspects of the transient dynamics , only those that are able to generate the quadrupole moment of vorticity .",
    "this is the essential deficiency in using the core growth model to study two - vortex merging , but also points to a low - dimensional way to correct the deficiency which we discuss at the end .",
    "determination of a merging criterion for the vortex pairs has been the focus of many studies both in inviscid and viscous setups , mostly in the symmetric case  @xcite , and fewer in the asymmetric case  @xcite .",
    "we study a symmetric case with identical circulations , @xmath20 , initially assigned to each vortex , and an asymmetric case with unequal circulations @xmath60 and @xmath61 initially assigned to each vortex . both cases have the same total circulation of @xmath36 and are shown in figure [ fig : schematics ] .",
    "both cases will approach the same asymptotic lamb - oseen solution in long time since their total circulation is the same .",
    "however , the transient dynamics is rather distinct and interesting , which will be shown in the later sections . for the symmetric case ,",
    "the onset of merging is usually determined by the ratio between the vortex core size @xmath62 and the separation between the vortex centers @xmath63 .",
    "the critical ratio @xmath64 has been found to be between 0.23 and 0.31 in the mentioned studies .",
    "for the asymmetric case , as stated in several studies mentioned before , whether a universal critical ratio can be found still remains an open question .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows : we implement the multi - gaussian model in the context of the co - rotating pairs in section  [ sec : mergers ] .",
    "we describe the evolution of vorticity and absolute velocity fields for the symmetric and asymmetric cases in section  [ sec : absolute ] .",
    "we then show the relative velocity field in section  [ sec : relative ] , and focus on the evolution and bifurcation of the instantaneous fixed points and instantaneous separatrices .",
    "since weaker vorticity tends to be `` passively '' advected by stronger more concentrated vorticity in the full equations of motion ( i.e. _ one - way _ coupling of the vorticity field ) , a key diagnostic tool for us is the tracking of passive tracers that are seeded judiciously in the flow field .",
    "the evolution of these passive patches are presented and discussed in section  [ sec : tracer ] .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : discussion ] we make connections between the results obtained from the multi - gaussian model and the previous studies and point to ways in which the low - dimensional core - growth model used in this paper can be augmented with the quadrupole terms to increase its fidelity to the full navier - stokes system .",

    "the snapshots of tracer evolution are rotated into the rotating frame for easier comparison .",
    "the reader is reminded that although the general trend of the evolution should only be dictated by the bifurcations of the relative velocity field , the visual details of passive tracer plots will also depend on the way the tracers are seeded , which should be kept in mind when comparing with dye visualization in previous experimental results .",

    "when the tracers travel along the outer separatrix and recirculate close to the opposite hyperbolic point , they will `` escape '' to the region outside the outer separatrix ( referred to as the _ outside area _ ) , see figure  [ fig : symmtracer](e ) . in the mean time , some of the middle ( yellow and teal ) and later inner ( red and blue ) tracers encounter the hyperbolic points and enter the outer recirculation area , they mix with the outer tracers while traveling close to the outer separatrix . at the second bifurcation time @xmath146 ,",
    "the moving hyperbolic points collide with the elliptic points , and most of the inner tracers still remain close to the now hyperbolic points @xmath147 , see figure  [ fig : symmtracer](f ) . as the separatrices continue to evolve , the tracers continue to mix in the outside area , but closer to the origin the six colored tracers are separated by clear boundaries .",
    "after the last bifurcation time @xmath148 , the topology of the separatrices remain the same , and the shape of the streamlines will not vary much ( although the magnitude of the velocity will continue to decay ) .",
    "hence , after @xmath148 , the tracers confined within the inner separatrix ( which include all six colors ) will mostly remain inside , and rest of the tracers will circulate around the outer separatrix in the outside area .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : symmtracer](h ) and ( i ) , due to the difference in the magnitude of velocities inside the inner separatrix , the boundaries between the inside six colored tracers will start to stretch , causing the tracers to mix in layers .",

    ", the 5 bifurcation times occur within a short period of time , hence the positions of the passive tracers will not change much during the bifurcation times .",
    "however , the last bifurcation time @xmath152 marks the end of the state that the tracers `` hover '' around two elliptic points , and all tracers will start to rotate around the remaining left vortex from now on .",

    "one can see remarkable resemblance between this result and the dye evolution in  @xcite ( their figure 15 ) and vorticity contour in  @xcite ( their figure 1 & 4 ) .",
    "there are three key features in the analysis of the core - growth model we highlight here :    1 .   the streamline description of a relative velocity field ( velocity field minus a rigid body rotation ) and their topological bifurcations analyzed in an appropriately chosen time - dependent rotating frame ; 2 .   the passive tracer field description in this same rotating frame ; 3 .   the identification of the passive field as a _ one - way coupled _ model of vorticity evolution giving insights into the dynamics of a weak vorticity field ( the outer region of a decaying gaussian core ) advected by the more strongly concentrated vorticity field emerging from the concentrated initial conditions .    [ !",
    "t ]    the description offered by the model reveals much more detailed and delicate structure than could easily be pinpointed by careful experiments addressing the same questions , such as @xcite .",
    "their experiment , however , clearly reveals the importance of the _ two - way coupling _ of the vorticity and velocity fields in the convective stage , as the vorticity is squeezed out of the inner zones shown in our figure [ fig : symmtracer ] , with respect to the generation of a quadrupole structure which is the key mechanism responsible for pushing the two vortex centers towards each other .",
    "this feature can not be captured in our _ one - way coupled _ description .",
    "the general monotonically decreasing trend of the distance between vortex centers as shown in our figure  [ fig : symmomega](b ) is consistent with the general direction .",
    "one can compare the separation plot with the figure 5(a ) in the dns study in  @xcite and see good qualitative agreement . from the value",
    "@xmath71 which is the time two peaks merge in the symmetric case , one can readily calculate that @xmath153 . though this value does not quantitatively agree with the results obtained by experiments ( the starting core sizes in experiments are generally around @xmath154 , which contributes to the complexity as well ) , e.g. on average 0.0011 for @xmath155 in  @xcite , and 0.0015 for @xmath156 , 0.0012 for @xmath157 , 0.0011 for @xmath158 in  @xcite , one can see that multi - gaussian model predicts merging time ( if defined as the merging of vorticity peaks ) roughly 4@xmath1595 times larger , and this difference ratio is consistent with the comparison between the bifurcation time for the model and dns in our previous work  @xcite .",
    "we believe the difference will decrease once the quadrupole is added to the model .    the rotating frame and topology of streamline patterns is essential to the understanding of viscous vorticity evolution . in the multi - gaussian model ,",
    "the angular velocity of the structure @xmath40 ( which will eventually decrease to zero due to the presence of viscosity ) is a natural choice of rotation rate , and the analogy between the velocity field of the vortex pair and that of a rankine vortex justifies the physical meaning of subtracting a rigid body rotation from the ( rotated ) absolute velocity field . indeed , although the passive tracer evolution is a result from integrating the absolute velocity field , it is obvious that the relative velocity fields ( figure  [ fig : symmseparatrix ] and  [ fig : asymmseparatrix ] ) are much more relevant to the tracer evolution than the absolute velocity fields ( figure  [ fig : symminertial ] and  [ fig : asymminertial ] ) .",
    "this is evident from comparison between the passive tracer trajectories ( figure  [ fig : path ] ) and rotating frame streamlines ( figure  [ fig : symmseparatrix ] ) and inertial frame streamlines ( figure  [ fig : symminertial ] ) . the reason was essentially noted by velasco fuentes  @xcite  the lagrangian dynamics of the passive tracer trajectories do not always follow the _ time varying _ eulerian streamlines . in steady flows ,",
    "both geometries are identical .",
    "the slower the eulerian velocity field is varying , the less difference between the two  @xcite . in this case",
    ", the absolute velocity field is a fast varying eulerian field , which is both rotating and evolving .",
    "the relative velocity field is a much slower varying eulerian field since it is a result of subtracting the fast varying part ( rigid body rotation ) off the absolute field .    [ !",
    "t ]    [ ! t ]    by using the multi - gaussian model ,",
    "we are able to analyze the topological evolution and bifurcation sequence of the relative field separatrices , and obtain the topological bifurcation times .",
    "the results can be partially verified in comparison to the experimental results obtained by previous studies of the symmetric case .",
    "the best example is figure 13 in cerretelli & williamson  @xcite , where they obtained separatrices topologically identical to figure  [ fig : symmseparatrix](a ) and ( h ) , but the intermediate topological states were not shown .",
    "indeed , we have not proven that they exist for the full navier - stokes equations , only for the multi - gaussian model . for the asymmetric case , to our knowledge , no previous research has shown separatrices in the rotating frame other than the initial state .",
    "we believe it is essential to understand the topological evolution of the streamlines , which dictate the merging process , and this work can be viewed as a first step towards unveiling the navier - stokes evolution of streamlines in the merging process .",
    "we present the complete sequence in figure  [ fig : symmseparatrix ] for the symmetric case and figure  [ fig : asymmseparatrix ] for the asymmetric case , and one can see that the bifurcations are rich and not at all trivial .",
    "the timeline of all important events based on the multi - gaussian model are plotted in figure  [ fig : symmtimeline ] for the symmetric case and in figure  [ fig : asymmtimeline ] for the asymmetric case .",
    "the path is now clear for a corrected low - dimensional core - growth based model of vortex merger .",
    "one needs to augment the basic description in this paper with the development and growth of an appropriately chosen quadrupole structure surrounding the co - rotating state , chosen with time dependent vorticity strengths which develop as the primary vorticity from the original core is squeezed out of the inner core region .",
    "it is interesting to note that some of these multi - pole features are systematically used in the work of  @xcite .",
    "implementing these key features in the context of a low - dimensional model of merger will be the focus of a separate paper .",
