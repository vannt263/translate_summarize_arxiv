    "it is known that seyfert galaxies often show very high - ionization emission lines such as [ ] @xmath4 , [ ] @xmath5 , [ ] @xmath6 and [ ] @xmath7 ( oke & sargent 1968 ; grandi 1978 ; penston et al .",
    "1984 ; de robertis & osterbrock 1986 ) .",
    "because the ionization potentials of these lines are higher than 100 ev , much attention has been paid to the high - ionization nuclear emission - line region [ hiner ; murayama , taniguchi , & iwasawa 1998 ( hereafter mti98 ) ; see also binette 1985 ] .",
    "the possible mechanisms of radiating such high - ionization emission lines are the following three processes : ( 1 ) collisional ionization in the gas with temperatures of _",
    "t@xmath8 _ @xmath9 10@xmath10 k ( oke & sargent 1968 ; nussbaumer & osterbrock 1970 ) ; ( 2 ) photoionization by the central nonthermal continuum emission [ osterbrock 1969 ; nussbaumer & osterbrock 1970 ; grandi 1978 ; korista & ferland 1989 ; ferguson , korista , & ferland 1997b ; murayama & taniguchi 1998a , 1998b ( hereafter mt98a and mt98b , respectively ) ] ; and ( 3 ) a combination of shocks and photoionization ( viegas - aldrovandi & contini 1989 ) .    recently , in context of the locally - optimally emitting cloud models ( loc models ; ferguson et al .",
    "1997a ) , ferguson , korista , & ferland ( 1997b ) showed that the high - ionization emission lines can be radiated in conditions of widely range of gas densities .",
    "more recently mt98a have found that type 1 seyfert nuclei ( s1s ) have excess [ ] @xmath06087 emission with respect to type 2s ( s2s ) .",
    "given the current unified model of agn ( antonucci & miller 1985 ; see for a review antonucci 1993 ) , the finding of mt98a implies that the hiner traced by the [ ] @xmath06087 emission resides in the inner wall of such dusty tori . since the covering factor of the torus is usually large ( e.g. , @xmath11 ) , and the electron density in the tori ( e.g. , @xmath12 @xmath13 ) is considered to be significantly higher than that ( e.g. , @xmath14 @xmath13 ) of the narrow - line region ( nlr ) , the contribution from the torus dominates the emission of the higher - ionization lines ( pier & voit 1995 ) . taking this hiner component into account ,",
    "mt98b have constructed new dual - component ( i.e. , a typical nlr with a hiner torus ) photoionization models and explained the observations consistently .",
    "on the other hand , it is also known that some seyfert nuclei have an extended hiner whose size amounts up to @xmath9 1 kpc ( golev et al . 1995 ; mti98 ) .",
    "the presence of such extended hiners can be explained as the result of very low - density conditions in the interstellar medium ( @xmath15 @xmath13 ) makes it possible to achieve higher ionization conditions ( korista & ferland 1989 ) .",
    "thus mt98a suggested a three - component model for the spatial distribution of hiner in terms of photoionization .",
    "that is : ( 1 ) the inner wall of the dusty torus with electron densities of @xmath16 @xmath13 ; the torus hiner [ pier & voit 1995 ; murayama & taniguchi 1998b ] , ( 2 ) the innermost part of the nlrs ; the nlr hiner ( @xmath17 @xmath13 ) at a distance from @xmath910 to @xmath9100 pc , and ( 3 ) the extended ionized region ( @xmath18 @xmath13 ) at a distance @xmath91 kpc ; the extended hiner ( korista & ferland 1989 ; mti98 ) .",
    "perhaps the relative contribution to the hiner emission from the above three components may be different from galaxy to galaxy .",
    "in particular , extended hiners have been found only in ngc 3516 ( golev et al .",
    "1995 ) and tololo 0109383 ( mti 98 ) and thus it is important to investigate how common the extended hiner in seyfert galaxies .    in this paper , we report on the discovery of an extended hiner in the nearby seyfert galaxy ngc 4051 .",
    "this observation was made during the course of our long - slit optical spectroscopy program for a sample of nearby seyfert galaxies at the okayama astrophysical observatory . throughout this paper",
    ", we use a distance toward ngc 4051 of 9.7 mpc , which is estimated using a value of _",
    "=  75 km s@xmath20 mpc@xmath20 and its recession velocity of 726 km s@xmath20 ( ulvestad & wilson 1984 ) .",
    "therefore , 1  corresponds to 47 pc at this distance .",
    "the spectroscopic observations were made at okayama astrophysical observatory , national astronomical observatory of japan on 1992 june 5 .",

    "we took three spectra ; ( 1 ) the central region , ( 2 ) 2  north of the central region , and ( 3 ) 2  south of the central region . each exposure time was 1200 seconds , respectively .",
    "the slit positions for ngc 4051 are displayed in figure 1 .",
    "the data was reduced with the use of iraf .",
    "the reduction was made with a standard procedure ; bias subtraction and flat fielding were made with the data of the dome flats .",
    "the flux scale was calibrated by using a standard star ( bd+33@xmath23 2642 ) .",
    "the nuclear spectrum was extracted with 292 aperture .",
    "the seeing size derived from the spatial profile of the standard star was about 23 ( fwhm ) during the observations .",
    "the spectrum of the nuclear region ( the central 29 @xmath21 18 region ) is shown in figure 2 . in order to estimate emission - line fluxes , we made multicomponent gaussian fitting for the spectrum using the sng ( the spectronebulargraph ; kosugi et al .",
    "1995 ) package .",
    "the identified emission lines of the nuclear region are summarized in table 1 .",
    "the [ ] @xmath06374 emission line is blended with [ ] @xmath06364 . assuming the theoretical ratio of [ ] @xmath06300/ [ ] @xmath06364 = 3 ( osterbrock 1989 ) , we measured the [ ] @xmath06374 flux .",
    "the reddening was estimated by using the balmer decrement ( i.e. , the ratio of narrow components of h@xmath2 and h@xmath3 ) .",
    "if the case b would be assumed , an intrinsic value of h@xmath2/h@xmath3 ratio was 2.87 for @xmath24 = 10@xmath25 k ( osterbrock 1989 ) .",
    "however , veilleux & osterbrock ( 1987 ) mentioned that the harder photoionizing spectrum of agns results in a large transition zone or partly ionized region in which collisional excitation becomes important ( ferland & netzer 1983 ; halpern and steiner 1983 ) .",
    "the main effect of the collisional excitation is to enhance h@xmath2 .",
    "therefore we adopt h@xmath2/h@xmath26 3.1 for the intrinsic ratio , and accordingly we obtain @xmath27 = 1.00 mag . this value is almost consistent with the previous estimation ( @xmath27 = 1.11 mag : erkens et al .",

    "this is more extended than the nlr traced by [ ] @xmath06300 .",
    "since , as shown in figure 6 , there is no strong line of sky emission at the observed wavelength of [ ] , the extended [ ] appears to be real .",
    "figure 5 also shows that the hiner may be extended southwestward .",
    "however this may be due to the contamination from the nuclear region , suggested by the relatively broad width of h@xmath3 at the southwest position .",
    "following veilleux & osterbrock ( 1987 ) , we investigate the excitation conditions of the emission - line region in each position . as shown in figure 7 , we find that the regions where [ ] is absent exhibit agn - like excitations , whereas the regions where [ ] is found show region - like excitations ( except for the southeast region where the line ratios show region - like excitation though [ ] is not detected ) .",
    "it is unlikely that the [ ] emission arises from regions .",
    "therefore the observed region - like excitations are due not to photoionization by massive stars but to some additional mechanism .",
    "we will discuss this complex property in section 5 .      as noted in section 1 , there are three kinds of the hiner ; 1 ) the torus hiner , 2 ) the nlr hiner , and 3 ) the extended hiner ( see mt98a ) .",
    "our detection of the extended [ ] emitting region tells us that the extended hiner exists at least in ngc 4051 .",
    "here we estimate how strong the contribution from the torus hiner using the dual component photoionization model of mt98b . according to the diagnostic diagram of their model ( figure 2 in mt98b ) , we find that the torus hiner may contribute to the total intensity of the hiner emission less than 3% . on the other hand ,",
    "if [ ] in the nuclear region was mainly attributed to the nlr hiner , this line would have a larger fwhm in the nuclear region than in off - nuclear regions because the flux contribution of the nlr hiner may be negligibly small in the off - nuclear regions . since we could not find the difference of fwhm of [ ] between the nuclear region and west , the nlr hiner is not a dominant source in ngc 4051 .",
    "it is therefore suggested that the majority of the hiner emission in ngc 4051 arises from low - density ism within a radius of @xmath1 150 pc .",
    "in order to understand the nuclear environment of ngc 4051 , we use photoionization models and compare the predictions of the models with the observed emission - line ratios of the nuclear region of ngc 4051 .",
    "the simplest model for the nlrs of seyfert galaxies is a so - called one - zone model , which assumes optically thick clouds of single density and single distance from the source of the ionization radiation ( e.g. ferland & netzer 1983 , stasinska 1984 ) .",
    "however , these models have been known to predict too weak high - ionization emission lines such as [ ] @xmath4 and [ ] @xmath5 , and moreover , predict less intense [ ] @xmath06374 than [ ] @xmath06087 . because these model predictions appear inconsistent with observations , one - zone models are not suitable to investigate the environment of the nuclear region of ngc 4051 .",

    "although our three - component model appears consistent with the observation , our result implies that the majority of balmer emission ( @xmath9 60% ) arises from the contamination component .",

    "first , we consider this problem for the nuclear region .",
    "possible candidates of the contamination components are either the blr or nuclear star - forming regions or both . if ngc 4051 belongs to a class of nls1s ( boller et al .",
    "1996 ; komossa & fink 1997 ) , it seems hard to measure the contribution from the blr to the h@xmath3 emission because of the narrow with of the broad line if present .",
    "it is also possible to consider that ngc 4051 experiences a burst of massive star formation in its nuclear region because there is a lot of cold molecular gas as well as circumnuclear star - forming regions in ngc 4051 ( kohno 1997 ; vila - vilar , taniguchi , & nakai 1998 ) .",
    "peterson , crenshaw , & meyers ( 1985 ) reported that h@xmath3 of ngc 4051 exhibits time variability ( enhanced by 85% in h@xmath3 flux ) on time scales shorter than @xmath92 years , that is , h@xmath3 of ngc4051 contains the broad component more or less .",
    "although we have no way to evaluate the contribution of this blr contamination to the total flux quantitatively , it is possible that all of the contamination component is contributed from the blr .",
    "in addition , the nuclear star - formation may contribute to the contamination .",
    "kohno ( 1997 ) discussed the gravitational instability of the nuclear molecular gas of some seyfert galaxies using the toomre s _ q_-value .",
    "the toomre s _ q _",
    "parameter characterizes the criterion for local stability in thin isothermal disks and is expressed as _",
    "_ = @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the critical surface density .",
    "q _ = 0.90 for the nuclear region of ngc4051 .",
    "this means that the molecular gas in the nuclear region of ngc4051 is thought to be gravitationally unstable .    in any case , about 60% of observed h@xmath3 is not originated from the nlr in the nuclear region of ngc 4051 .",
    "this means that the line ratios of the nuclear region suffer seriously from the contamination . in figure 10 , we replot the excitation diagnostic diagram using the line ratios , from which the contamination component is subtracted .",
    "this diagram shows that the contamination - subtracted line ratios of nuclear region show the typical agn - like excitation condition .",
    "therefore we conclude that the unusual excitation condition is due to the contamination component .",
    "high - spatial resolution optical spectroscopy or x - ray imaging observations will be helpful in investigating whether or not the star - formation activity dominates the flux of h@xmath3 .",
    "second , we consider the off - nuclear regions .",
    "as shown in figure 7 , the three off - nuclear regions ( west , southwest , and southeast ) also show region - like excitations .",
    "since a typical size of the blr is @xmath9 0.01 pc ( e.g. peterson 1997 ) , it is likely that these excitation conditions are thought to be due to circumnuclear star - forming regions .",
