    "we write @xmath8 for such a branching random walk .",
    "we assume throughout that @xmath0 is infinite , @xmath7 is irreducible , @xmath6 has finite mean @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "we write @xmath11 for a random walk on @xmath0 with transition kernel @xmath7 , and @xmath12 for a probability measure under which the brw and the random walk are independent and begin at vertex @xmath2 .",
    "let @xmath13 be the spectral radius of @xmath7 , @xmath14 ( which is independent of the choice of @xmath2 ) .",
    "we say that a brw is _ recurrent _ if every vertex of the graph is visited infinitely often by the particles of the brw . otherwise it is _",
    "transient_. benjamini and peres ( see @xcite ) gave a characterization for transience of the process in terms of the spectral radius @xmath15 of the underlying walk : they showed that if @xmath16 then the brw is transient , while if @xmath17 then the brw is recurrent .",
    "we call a @xmath8 _ critical _ if @xmath18 .    gantert and mller @xcite and bertacchi and zucca @xcite proved that any critical brw is transient .",
    "the trace of the critical process ( the subgraph induced by edges that are traversed by particles of the brw ) is then an interesting random structure in its own right . benjamini and mller @xcite showed that on cayley graphs , simple random walk on the trace of any transient brw is itself almost surely transient , but any non - trivial _ branching _ random walk on the trace is strongly recurrent .    in this work",
    "we investigate the number of topological ends of the trace .",
    "that is , if we remove a large ball about the origin , how many connected components do we see ?    we prove the following theorem , which shows that on many graphs the trace has infinitely many ends .",
    "we say that a random walk @xmath19 is _ quasi - symmetric _ if there exists @xmath20 such that for all vertices @xmath2 and @xmath21 , and all @xmath4 , @xmath22 in particular , simple random walk on any graph of bounded degree is quasi - symmetric .",

    "we highlight several interesting and illuminating examples , finding cases where critical brw has one end , infinitely many ends , and everything in between .",
    "take a random walk @xmath25 on a graph @xmath0 with transition kernel @xmath7 .",
    "we shall associate a random walk with its transition kernel ; for example , if we say `` @xmath7 is simple random walk on @xmath0 '' we mean that @xmath7 is the transition kernel corresponding to simple random walk on @xmath0 .",
    "recall that the spectral radius of @xmath7 is defined to be @xmath26 it is easy to see that this does not depend on the choice of vertices @xmath2 and @xmath21 , due to irreducibility of @xmath7 .",
    "see for example @xcite for many more details on the spectral radius of a random walk .",
    "we say that a random walk is _ amenable _ if @xmath27 , and _ non - amenable _ otherwise if and only if the graph is amenable .",
    "this powerful result motivates our terminology . ] .",
    "often we say that a _ graph _",
    "@xmath0 is amenable ( non - amenable , respectively ) , by which we mean that the relevant random walk on @xmath0 is amenable ( non - amenable ) .    in many cases we will consider simple ( isotropic ) random walk on a graph @xmath0 , which jumps to each of its current neighbours with equal probability , and write @xmath28 for its transition kernel .",
    "it is natural , at first , to restrict ourselves to vertex - transitive graphs .",
    "if a graph is amenable then the critical branching random walk is just a random walk , so we are interested in non - amenable graphs .",
    "observe also that if a vertex - transitive graph @xmath0 has infinitely many ends itself , then the trace of any transient brw will have infinitely many ends too .",
    "thus we are interested in one - ended , non - amenable , vertex - transitive graphs . a natural way to construct such graphs is to take the cartesian product of two vertex - transitive graphs , at least one of which is non - amenable .    to be precise , for two graphs @xmath29 and @xmath30 ( not necessarily vertex transitive ) , the cartesian product @xmath31 is the graph with vertex set @xmath32 and edge set @xmath33 given transition kernels @xmath34 and @xmath35 on @xmath29 and @xmath30 respectively , we can then define a random walk on @xmath31 by flipping a fair coin at every step : if it comes up heads , then we take a step along an edge inherited from @xmath29 according to @xmath34 , and if it comes up tails , we take a random walk along an edge inherited from @xmath30 according to @xmath35 .",
    "we write @xmath36 for the corresponding transition kernel .",
    "we consider this to be the `` natural '' random walk on @xmath31 .",
    "note that this is not necessarily the usual isotropic simple random walk on @xmath31 , in which the walk moves to each of its neighbours with equal probability .",
    "however , all of our results apply without change in the isotropic case ; see section [ appendix ] for details .",
    "our first example is @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the tree in which every vertex has degree 3 .",
    "consider @xmath40 .",
    "it is easy to calculate that @xmath41 , and of course @xmath42 . from this",
    "we deduce ( see lemma [ cs2 ] ) that @xmath43    [ t3z ] if @xmath44 , then the trace of @xmath45 has infinitely many ends almost surely .",
    "consider the projection of the branching random walk onto @xmath39 . at each time",
    "@xmath4 , each particle branches independently into a random number of particles with law @xmath6 ; and each of these particles moves independently according to _ lazy _ simple random walk on @xmath39 ; that is , it stays put with probability @xmath46 , otherwise it makes a step according to a simple random walk on @xmath39 . call the transition kernel for this walk @xmath47 ( so @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is simple random walk on @xmath39 and @xmath50 is the identity matrix ) .",
    "then @xmath51 so @xmath52 is a critical branching random walk and therefore transient .",
    "we deduce that each copy of @xmath53 is hit only finitely often by particles in @xmath45 ; since @xmath39 has infinitely many ends , this property is inherited by the trace of the branching random walk .",
    "note that our proof did not require many detailed properties of the two graphs @xmath39 and @xmath53 .",
    "in fact all that we used was that critical brw on @xmath39 has infinitely many ends , and that @xmath53 is amenable .",
    "the natural next question is to consider what happens when our cartesian product is of two non - amenable graphs .",
    "we begin with @xmath54 , and note that our previous tactic no longer works .",
    "each copy of @xmath39 is hit infinitely often by particles of the critical brw , which tells us nothing about the number of ends of the trace .",
    "we instead look from a different viewpoint : if we start two independent critical branching random walks from vertices a long way apart , do they meet ?",
    "start one critical brw from a vertex @xmath55 , and call this the _ red _ process ; start the other , independent critical brw from vertex @xmath21 , and call it the _ blue _ process .",
    "colour red any vertex that is hit by a particle in the red process , and colour blue any vertex that is hit by a particle in the blue process .",
    "vertices that are coloured both red and blue we call _",
    "purple_. we are interested in the number of purple vertices .    [ purplefinite ] for any @xmath2 and @xmath21 , the expected number of purple vertices is finite .    for this we will need some detailed estimates on the return probability of simple random walk on @xmath54 , and a simple tool for calculating expected numbers of particles in branching processes .",
    "we delay these details for a moment to show that proposition [ purplefinite ] is enough to establish that the trace of critical brw on @xmath54 has infinitely many ends .",
    "let @xmath7 be simple random walk on @xmath54 , and suppose that @xmath56 .",
    "then the trace of @xmath57 has infinitely many ends almost surely .    for every @xmath58 define @xmath59 to be the set of particles alive in the branching random walk at time @xmath5 .",

    "for each particle @xmath66 at time @xmath67 , given its position , its descendants draw out a brw ; call this @xmath68 . note that , by proposition [ purplefinite ] , the intersection of the trace of @xmath68 with the trace of @xmath69 is finite for each @xmath70 .",
