    "quantum key distribution enables the distribution of provably secure shared bit strings , which is an important fundamental primitive for many cryptographic tasks such as one - time pad encrypted secure communication @xcite or message authentication @xcite .",
    "in contrast to classical secret key distribution schemes , only quantum key distribution ( qkd ) @xcite has been proven to provide universally composable security against an arbitrarily powerful eavesdropper , who is only restricted by the laws of quantum physics @xcite . since the first theoretical conception @xcite ,",
    "a wide variety of different qkd protocols have emerged and have been demonstrated in numerous real - world scenarios @xcite .    for implementations based on optical fiber telecommunication infrastructures ,",
    "many qkd systems rely on quantum states prepared in the time - phase domain to benefit from their inherent robustness against polarization fluctuations during propagation through the fiber .",
    "moreover , the receiver of such systems can be rendered completely passive , without the need for active components which would introduce losses in the quantum channel and require additional resources from a fast random - number generator . among the most prominent of such qkd protocols",
    "are the bb84 @xcite time - phase coding scheme @xcite , the cow protocol @xcite and the dps protocol @xcite .",
    "many interesting approaches of establishing qkd between different users in a network scenario have been proposed and demonstrated .",
    "mainly , they have adopted either the trusted node implementation @xcite , passive optical switching @xcite or active optical switching @xcite .",
    "the latter two methods allow the quantum channels to be dynamically reconfigured in order to connect different users without relying on trusted nodes . in all of the demonstrations",
    "so far , the physical layer of the qkd systems has been restricted to specialized transmitters and receivers running the same qkd protocol . however , in reconfigurable network environments there is a potential interest in the capability of switching between several qkd protocols .",
    "this can stem from a variety of reasons , such as certain protocols being better suited for long distance links , varying resistance to environmental effects or background noise , individual user demands or different industrial standards .",
    "these things are already evident from current network implementations @xcite , where a broad range of commercial and development systems are being used . having a single transmitter capable of performing qkd with receivers dedicated to different protocols",
    "could provide a reduction in system complexity , management and cost . in this work we aimed at developing such a transmitter suitable for deployment in a reconfigurable network as represented in fig .",
    "[ fig : ddmnetwork ] .    in @xcite it was shown that an arbitrary time - bin qubit state can be generated using a pulsed laser source , an unbalanced mach - zehnder interferometer ( mzi ) and a dual - drive modulator ( ddm ) . in this work",
    "we apply and extend this result to implement a simplified ddm based qkd transmitter which does not require a stabilized interferometer .",
    "moreover its absence allows for flexible time - bin period adjustment achieved by changing the ddm clock frequency .",
    "such flexibility is essential when switching between receivers which may have a different interferometer path difference .",
    "this transmitter is especially suited for compact implementations of distributed - phase reference protocols , namely cow and dps , as well as bb84 schemes based on weak coherent states with nonrandom phases @xcite .",
    "we present experimental results obtained with a ghz clocked multi - protocol qkd platform , which is based on a ddm transmitter and a reconfigurable receiver with free - running avalanche photodiode ( apd ) single photon detectors .",
    "a hardware - based key distillation engine is used to analyze the performance of the source in various qkd scenarios .",
    "our transmitter exhibits stable low quantum bit error rates ( qber ) in both the time and phase bases , suitable for multi - protocol qkd in optical fiber infrastructures .    in the following",
    ", we will describe the operation of the ddm and how it can be used to prepare states required for the previously mentioned protocols . note that it could also be applied to related protocols such as sarg @xcite and b92 @xcite",
    ", however we will not analyze them in this work .",
    "experimental analysis of the state preparation is carried out , followed by incorporation of the transmitter in a qkd scenario .",
    "overall performance is presented whilst using different protocols with various channel losses .",
    "the stability of the source is also analyzed over a long period of time .",
    "and single photon detectors ( spd ) . the abstract component in between the transmitter and receivers represents an actively or passively switched network establishing the connection.,width=377 ]    a ddm consists of two electro - optic phase modulators , one in each arm of an integrated mzi , as illustrated in fig .  [ fig : ddmnetwork ] .",
    "the ability to control the phase shifts in the individual ddm arms enables the generation of arbitrary qubit states , limited only by the capability of the driving electronics .",
    "each of the phase modulators provides an electrical input port to apply a dc bias voltage @xmath0 which leads to a fixed phase @xmath1 . here , @xmath2 is the characteristic voltage which shifts the phase by @xmath3 and @xmath4 indicates the ddm arm .",
    "a second pair of radio frequency ( rf ) input ports allows the injection of voltage pulses of amplitudes @xmath5 which apply additional phase shifts @xmath6 . throughout this paper",
    "it is assumed that the ddm has a z - cut structure @xcite , hence a positive voltage induces a positive phase shift in both arms .",
    "quantum models for electro - optic phase and amplitude modulation have been described in detail in @xcite .",
    "accordingly , any coherent state @xmath7 with complex amplitude @xmath8 at the input of the ddm is transformed as    @xmath9    for simplicity , we choose the dc bias voltages such that @xmath10 , @xmath11 .",
    "therefore the resulting state @xmath12 is given by    @xmath13    hence for @xmath14 the interference is destructive and no light passes through the modulator . applying temporary rf voltage pulses with @xmath15 results in constructive interference and output pulses of maximum intensity are obtained .",
    "the global phase is determined by an appropriate choice of @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "if the input is a coherent continuous wave ( cw ) laser , it is possible to cut out multiple coherent pulses with an arbitrary phase relation , i.e. an arbitrary time - phase qubit ( or qutrit or any higher dimensional state ) can be prepared .",
    "for example , in order to generate two pulses with a phase difference of @xmath3 , we first apply @xmath18 and @xmath19 and then , after a time @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 . in order to operate the ddm transmitter at high frequencies",
    "it is desirable to utilise a method for generating the required qubit states by using rf drive signals with the minimum number of voltage levels , preferably just two .    in reality",
    "it is not possible to apply the desired phase shift instantaneously , since the rf drive pulses have a finite rise time and this leads us to consider the resulting phase chirp of pulses carved out from a cw laser .",
    "it is possible to obtain chirp - free intensity modulation by operating the ddm in the so called push - pull mode , where opposite phase shifts of equal magnitude are applied to the ddm arms simultaneously .",
    "this method can be used for production of the time and phase basis qubits , however if both bases are used , as for bb84 , then 4 voltage levels would be required for driving the ddm arms . by allowing the pulses to be chirped , the number of voltage levels can be reduced , simplifying the drive electronics . generally , increasing the number of voltage levels in high - speed electronics bears the drawback of increased signal eye spreading ( amplitude fluctuations ) @xcite .",
    "such amplitude fluctuations could have a detrimental effect on the qber . in the following",
    "we will show that having a phase chirp should not actually increase the qber , meaning the overall system performance can be improved by using fewer voltage levels .    considering that the phase qubit is formed by two optical pulses separated by a time @xmath20 , it is sufficient to ensure that each pair of points on the two pulses separated by @xmath20 have the correct relative phase , in other words the phase chirp is matched . in order to visualise the phase progression of the optical pulses , eq .",

    "visualized like this , the optical phase between two pulses @xmath25 is the relative angle between them and the optical field amplitude is the radial distance from the origin .",
    "it is clear that the pulse progression for a positive phase shift in arm 1 ( trace ( a ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : constellation ] ) is rotated by 180 degrees from that of a positive phase shift in arm 2 ( trace ( b ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : constellation ] ) .",
    "inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : constellation ] shows that the optical phase difference @xmath25 between these two optical pulses is constant as a function of optical field amplitude .",
    "this means that two pulses generated by equal phase shifts ( same rise - time and amplitude of rf signals ) applied to different ddm arms would interfere destructively in an optimal way .",
    "similarly , a pair or pulses originating from a phase shift in the same ddm arm ( twice trace ( a ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : constellation ] ) would interfere constructively since the pulses are identical .",
    "this enables the generation of phase encoded @xmath26 qubits ( phase difference of @xmath3 or 0 between two optical pulses ) of arbitrary amplitudes .",
    "we wish to stress that this method of phase basis state generation has significant advantages over conventional methods for phase coding with a phase modulator , for example as used in @xcite , where the finite rise time of the phase modulator drive signal introduces errors and necessitates further temporal filtering .",
    "our transmitter is inherently robust against this problem and reduces the number of components .",
    "it should be noted that attempting to generate the @xmath27 states ( phase difference @xmath28 or @xmath29 between two optical pulses ) with two level drive signals in this manner would lead to unmatched phase chirp and hence imperfect interference .",
    "this is illustrated with pulse progressions ( a ) and ( c ) in fig .",

    "this is used for @xmath32 basis encoding by sending a pulse in either the early or late time - bin .",
    "in fact , inverting the applied phase shifts ( @xmath33 and @xmath34 ) would generate a pulse with a relative optical phase difference of @xmath3 , hence as mentioned previously , it is possible to achieve phase encoding using the push - pull method .",
    "it is clear however that this requires an additional voltage level .",
    "in fact , switching between the phase and time basis , as in bb84 , would require four voltage levels in order to change the pulse amplitude .",
    "one can expect that going from a two - level signal to a three - level signal can increase the rf signal eye spreading by a factor of 1.5 , whilst using a four - level signal could increase it by a factor of 3 @xcite . in order to estimate the impact this would have on the qber ,",
    "let us consider drive signals that have an eye spreading of 10% for two voltage levels .",

    ", the chirped method would result in around 2.8% qber in the phase basis , whist in the chirp free case it would be about 4.9% due to the additional eye spreading of the four - level signals .",

    "the photon    number per pulse is always constant , unlike bb84 .",
    "thus it is possible    to generate the pulses either using the push - pull method utilizing    both arms of the ddm , or by using only one arm and increasing the    drive voltage to @xmath2 .",
    "bob determines the bit value    by simply measuring the arrival times of the photons with a detector ,    know as the data single photon detector    ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "a beam splitter sends a    fraction of the pulses to an unbalanced interferometer where the    coherence of succeeding pulses is checked with detector    @xmath43 , which guarantees the security of    the protocol .",

    "this detection scheme was    first proposed in @xcite and is explained in further detail in    @xcite .",
    "the security of the protocol is not altered since only the    qubit frequency is changed .",

    "* ) the bb84 protocol has been implemented with a pulsed    laser source , an unbalanced interferometer identical to the one at    bob , plus a phase and/or intensity modulator .",
    "the advantage of these    implementations is that the states are phase randomized .",
    "it has been    shown in @xcite that even using nonrandom phases , as in our case ,    still yields a secret key in place of general attacks , albeit at a    much restricted distance .",
    "the secret key rate will be calculated using    this security proof .",
    "the advantage of using our source , is that alice    can not only save the interferometer , but she can also generate almost    any time delay @xmath20 with the electronic control system ,    making the transmitter easily adaptable to different receivers . in    principle it could be possible to achieve phase randomization by    pulsing the laser , bringing it below threshold between qubits , an    approach that has already been demonstrated for high - speed random    number generation @xcite .",
    "otherwise , dual - drive modulators exist with    an integrated phase modulator at the output , which could be used to    actively phase randomize the qubits . as we have shown",
    ", the ddm is    capable of producing phase and time basis states with arbitrary    amplitude , hence in the future it would be possible to directly    implement the decoy - state bb84 protocol @xcite , by using multi - level    rf drive signals .",
    "figure  [ fig : ddmnetwork ] shows a sketch of the experimental setup for the source used to produce the quantum states from a continuous laser beam .",
    "we use a distributed feedback ( dfb ) diode laser ( anritsu ) with a center wavelength of 1555  nm and a spectral line width below 3  mhz , hence a coherence time much longer than the typical delay @xmath20 between the time bins , which is usually on the order of nanoseconds .",
    "after the pulses are generated by the ddm as described in the previous section , a variable optical attenuator ( voa ) reduces the number of photons per qubit down to the single photon level .",
    "the random pulse sequences for the two rf inputs of the ddm are provided by a 2.5  ghz transceiver driven by a hardware key distillation engine based on a field - programmable gate array ( fpga)(xilinx virtex 5 ) , such that the separation @xmath20 between two time bins is 800  ps ( 1.25  ghz ) . the key distillation engine is seeded with a quantum random number generator ( qrng ) ( i d quantique quantis ) .",
    "the qubit frequency is 625  mhz for cow and bb84 and 1.25  ghz for dps .",
    "the rf pulses are synchronized with an external variable rf delay and amplified by means of two 12.5  ghz rf modulator drivers ( picosecond 5865 ) .",

    ", an attractive feature of our transmitter is that it can be easily adapted to work with interferometers of different imbalances .",
    "moreover one can take advantage of this fact to loosen the accuracy requirements in production of fiber interferometers . indeed manufacturing a fiber interferometer with a precise imbalance",
    "is non - trivial as it requires accurate fiber cleaving with an error on the order of tens of microns .",

    ", the phase error curve is displaced to higher photon numbers compared to that of the time basis .",
    "this is partially due to the additional losses in the interferometer and circulator along with the fact that only one time - bin per qubit is monitored corresponding to the instance where the early and late parts of the qubit take the long and short interferometer arms respectively , whilst any other combination is discarded . with decreasing photon numbers",
    ", the dark counts quickly became the dominant contributor to the qber , whilst at high photon numbers the qber also increased due to saturation effects in the detectors .",
    "this is the reason for the counter intuitive reduction of sifted and secret rates at high photon numbers .",
    "the maximum sifted rates saturated at just below 25  kb / s ( cow and bb84 ) and 40  kb / s ( dps ) , due to the deadtime of the detectors .    it is evident that the secret key rates for the three protocols are quite different .",
    "one must keep in mind that the presented secret rates and distances are only an indication of what could be achievable , calculated from the sifted rates and the qber .",
    "cow was analyzed taking finite key effects into account , assuming a block size of @xmath64 , whilst treatment of dps and bb84 was carried out in the asymptotic limit .",
    "dps performs the best in terms of distance , allowing transmission beyond 100  km , whilst cow reaches a distance of about 90  km . due to the fact that bb84 with weak coherent states is susceptible to the photon - number splitting attack it exhibits the worst secret key rate .",
    "additionally the nonrandom phase limits the distance to about 20  km .",
    "we expect that with phase randomization the distance would increase by around a factor of 3 . in order to increase the distance further , in would be logical for future work to investigate the possibility of implementing the decoy state version of bb84 with this transmitter .",
    "although this work does not aim to be a review of the different protocols ( we would direct the reader to @xcite for this ) , it is clear that they posses various advantages and disadvantages , be it achievable distance , secret key rate , ease of implementation or security against a given attack .",
    "this highlights the appeal of having a flexible transmitter that could allow adaptation to the most efficient protocol in a given scenario . in this investigation",
    "we did not implement all of the real - time post processing required for full qkd , however , in practice our transmitter is directly compatible with existing qkd platforms .",
    "currently , switching protocols with our system must be done manually and takes a few tens of minutes in order to reconfigure the fpga .",
    "since the majority of the resource heavy processes such as error correction and privacy amplification are independent of the protocol , in should be possible to implement a system that could automatically switch protocols and receivers within tens of seconds . for real - world use , in order to increase the secret key rate and achievable distance dramatically , the main change that would need to be made to the overall system is the use of rapid - gated apd detectors @xcite , or superconducting nanowire single photon detectors @xcite .    in scope of this investigation",
    "the figure of merit relating directly to the transmitter performance is the optical quantum bit error rate ( @xmath65 ) , which is calculated by subtracting the detector dark count contribution . by taking into account the detector deadtime",
    ", we calculate the @xmath65 for each protocol in the range of @xmath66 photons per pulse / qubit , where high detection rate was observed giving the best statistics , without detector saturation effects .",
    "the results are summarized in table  [ table : optqber ] .",
    ".optical qber .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     as expected from the extinction ratio measurement , the resulting time basis error rate is very low ; a portion of which can still be attributed to the timing jitter and afterpulsing of the detectors .",
    "the main contribution to the phase error rate is expected to stem from pulse - to - pulse amplitude and shape fluctuations ( signal eye spreading ) which lead to imperfect interference at the receiver .",
    "the fact that the phase error rate for cow is lower than that of bb84 and dps means that more errors arise from the state with a phase difference of @xmath3 , since this is the only one not used in cow .",
    "this can be expected since this state is generated by first applying a phase shift in one arm of the ddm and then the other .",
    "any mismatch in the electronic pulses driving each arm will directly result in interference errors .",
    "it is envisaged that further improvements to the pulse generator cards could reduce this value , by reducing the electronic pulse ripple , which leads to the significant distortions on the falling edge of the optical pulses , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : extinction](b ) .    in order to demonstrate the stable operation of the transmitter ,",
    "a constant photon number per pulse of @xmath67 was set , whilst using the cow protocol .",
    "active tracking of the ddm bias voltage and the laser current was also enabled . during this measurement ,",
    "parameter estimation was carried out over the authenticated public channel , on 12.5% of the sifted bits , along with full qber verification over the service channel of the key distillation engine .",
    "figures  [ fig : qber_long](a ) and [ fig : qber_long](b ) show operation over a period of 40 hours with an average qber of 1.2% and a visibility of 96.5% . the resulting bias voltage and laser current is also plotted .",
    "this demonstrates that our system is very robust and can easily track and optimize the required parameters .",
    "we have demonstrated a novel optical quantum communication transmitter that can be flexible in terms of the qkd protocol that it uses .",
    "moreover , the transmitter is constructed with off - the - shelf components , i.e. a commercial ddm running at a frequency of 1.25  ghz , a cw laser and a voa .",
    "the experimental results show an extinction ratio of @xmath68 db allowing time and phase coding with low qber for three different protocols , namely bb84 , cow and dps .",
    "the performance of the transmitter was analyzed with the three protocols by running qkd over different channel losses .",
    "indicative secret key rate and achievable distances were presented . in future work",
    "it would be possible to automatically switch between different receivers dedicated to different protocols , when using a reconfigurable network .",
    "switching between receivers with different interferometer path differences could also be possible .",
    "the source can simplify extensions to network qkd environments providing a reduction in system complexity , management and cost .",
    "we wish to thank charles ci wen lim for helpful advice and antonio ruiz - alba for stimulating discussions and involvement with our group leading to this investigation .",
    "this work was supported by the swiss national centre of competence in research , quantum science and technology project ( nccr - qsit ) ."
