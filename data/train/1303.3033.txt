    "another application arises from quantum mechanics , where nls type models arise in the description of bose - einstein condensates in harmonic traps ( which are experimentally required to produce these condensates ) . in this context",

    "the possibility of obtaining strichartz type estimates on @xmath309 is therefore severely restricted and any proof of a possible bound on @xmath315 requires totally different techniques from those needed in the case @xmath316 . in view of this , we shall restrict ourselves to the situation @xmath26 , only , in which case the following local well - posedness result can be directly deduced from @xcite ( the case @xmath23 is not treated in @xcite , as it is straightforward using the sobolev embedding @xmath317 , that is , without strichartz estimates ) :          in the particular case @xmath322 several additional results are available .",
    "for example , in @xmath23 local well - posedness in @xmath33 holds for nonlinearities which are smaller that quintic @xcite . in higher dimensions , though , the situation seems to be more involved ( at least if one seeks for strong solutions in the energy space ) .",
