    "@xcite first discovered twelve definite massive o and wolf  rayet ( w  r ) stars orbiting our galaxy s central black hole ( bh ) sagittarius a * ( sgr a * ) .",
    "@xcite raised this to twenty - four , and more recently @xcite counted 177 .",
    "these stars are intriguing for their unusual situation .",
    "they appear to be coeval , having formed roughly @xmath6 ago @xcite .",
    "all orbit at distances between roughly @xmath7 and @xmath3 of sgr a*. further astrometric and spectroscopic measurements have confirmed that these stars form at least one eccentric ( @xmath8 ) disc- or ring - like structure ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and fit a top - heavy imf ( eg .",
    "@xmath9 , @xcite ) .",
    "interestingly , a reasonable subset of the stars rotate oppositely in the plane of the sky . @xcite and @xcite concluded that these stars form a secondary stellar disc or streamer , although its existance is statistically less certain @xcite .",
    "it seems likely that these stars were formed in a single event , though their unusual location and configuration complicate matters .",
    "@xcite suggested that a massive cluster similar to arches or the quintuplet could infall to the bh via dynamical friction with the background stars .",
    "the remnant cluster core would be deposited there .",
    "however , timescale arguments make this difficult ( see @xcite and the discussions in @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "another scenario is that of the stars formation _ in situ _ within an accretion disc around the bh @xcite .",
    "while ` normal ' star formation within a cloud so close to the bh would be strongly inhibited by tidal forces , a disc formed from such a cloud s tidal shearing around the bh may become self - gravitating to such a degree that fragmentation may occur ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .    in agreement ,",
    "numerical simulations have shown that portions of an infalling cloud can be captured by a bh to form an eccentric disc that fragments to form a stellar disc population ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite found that heating of the gas as it was compressed around the bh raised the jeans mass , leading to the formation of a population of high mass stars in inner regions around the bh .",
    "lower mass stars formed farther out in a separate population .",
    "@xcite found that a collision between two clouds close to sgr a * could be responsible for the formation of multiple discs , though this would require two clouds to simultaneously enter the innermost galactic centre ( gc ) .",
    "two populations of stars formed in the same manner as in @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we use smoothed particle hydrodynamics to examine a model similar to that of @xcite , requiring only one cloud on infall towards a bh  a simpler and perhaps more frequent event . the cloud s geometry is prolate to the orbital plane , generating a large spread in angular momentum when on a highly radial orbit as gas flows around the bh from different directions .",
    "this naturally leads to the formation of multiple misaligned gas structures orbiting the central bh .",
    "smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) is a lagrangian hydrodynamics formalism in which particles are used to represent portions of the total gas mass . a good description of the formalism is provided by @xcite .",
    "we used the code of @xcite , itself derived from an earlier sph code ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this code includes individual particle timesteps ( eg .",
    "@xcite ) and is parallelized using openmp .",
    "sink particles , which are the sph representations of ( proto-)stars , were implemented following @xcite .",
    "radiative transfer of energy was approximated with the hybrid method of @xcite .",
    "standard sph shock heating and @xmath10 work were combined with the polytropic cooling technique of @xcite and the flux - limited diffusion method of @xcite .",
    "polytropic cooling alone was used by @xcite and allowed energy transfer with an external radiation background .",
    "this took the form of cooling when the gas had a higher temperature than the background , and heating when it was lower . the radiative diffusion used here",
    "further improved the approximation by allowing energy to flow from hot to cold gas , the flux - limiter regulating the flow appropriately between the optically thick and thin limits .",
    "we used a background temperature of @xmath11 , close to the values observed in gc molecular and atomic gas ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "once a particle s time derivative of the internal energy had been calculated , it was semi - implicitly integrated as described by @xcite , following @xcite .",
    "in contrast to both this work and @xcite , the cooling of @xcite was determined via a parametric relation with the dynamical timescale .",
    "particles were integrated in thirty timestep bins , each with a power of two division of the maximum timestep @xmath12 , or @xmath13 in code units ( one code unit was equivalent to @xmath14 ) .",
    "the smallest timestep a particle could be integrated on was @xmath15 , though typically few ever required a timestep shorter than @xmath16 . while a large bh accretion radius ( see section  [ ss : sphsinks ] ) delayed it , the accretion to the disc of cloud material over time eventually caused particle timesteps to fall below the minimum , ending the simulation . to keep the simulation running",
    "would have required reducing the maximum timestep or increasing the number of bins : either would have unreasonably increased the integration time .",
    "gas in the simulation experienced the potential from the nuclear stellar cluster in addition to the bh and its own self - gravity . to obtain the enclosed mass as a function of galactocentric radius @xmath17 , we integrated over volume the stellar number density of @xcite , who constructed a model using observations by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this number density is given as @xmath18^{(\\gamma_i - \\gamma)/\\alpha}.\\ ] ] to tabulate the masses we used their best fit parameters of @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and normalized with the observed enclosed mass at @xmath23 of @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "sinks are n - body particles that only experience gravitational forces , but can accrete nearby gas particles .",
    "dynamic sink creation was used to model star formation . following @xcite",
    ", sinks were created to replace a bound , collapsing region of gas .",
    "such a region was required to be smaller than the accretion radius of the sink which would replace it ( see next paragraph ) , @xmath25 .",
    "it was also required to exceed a critical density . in those runs which used clouds with masses @xmath26 and",
    "@xmath27 , it was @xmath28 , while for the clouds of @xmath29 , which were less dense initially , it was @xmath30 .",
    "these are of order ten million times the initial cloud densities .",
    "they also approximate the tidal density at the bh s outer accretion radius , helping prevent sink formation where tidal disruption is likely .",
    "once a region fulfilling the above requirements was identified , further checks were made to ensure that the region was both bound and collapsing , as described by @xcite .",
    "the initial mass for sink particles was approximately fifty times the gas particle mass . for clouds with @xmath27 ,",
    "this was @xmath31 ; for @xmath29 , it was @xmath32 .",
    "taken together , these tests ensured that a real and resolved star formation event was taking place .",
    "accretion to a sink from within an outer accretion radius @xmath33 was only allowed if the gas was bound to the sink , and more tightly than to any other sink , and if its angular momentum around it was small enough to allow it to enter a circular orbit at @xmath33 .",
    "conversely , all gas was accreted once it fell within an inner accretion radius @xmath34 .",
    "we used @xmath35 for both the stars and the bh .",
    "@xmath36 was used for sink particles representing stars , the same as the critical sink creation radius .",
    "the outer accretion radius was chosen to approximate the size of a protostellar disc ; therefore a sink particle may be taken to represent an unresolved star - disc system .",
    "this radius was chosen as an acceptable tradeoff between simulation runtime , decreased with increasing @xmath37 , and sink resolution , improved with decreased @xmath37 .",
    "we represented the black hole with a sink particle of mass @xmath38 @xcite . in order to avoid relativistic effects and huge forces on gas particles",
    ", we increased its outer accretion radius to @xmath39 . at this distance from the bh ,",
    "the keplerian circular speed was @xmath40 per cent of the speed of light .",
    "the inner accretion radius was the same as that used for dynamically created sinks .",
    "it is important to note that dynamically - created sink particles do not represent true stars .",
    "rather , they consist of an unresolved accretion disc and ( proto)star that exist within the accretion radius .",
    "likewise , the large accretion disc around the bh would in reality extend inside the outer accretion radius .       and a black hole ( bh ) , represented by a sink particle of mass @xmath41 .",
    "the cloud was positioned such that its centre lay on the @xmath42-axis at a distance @xmath17 from the bh which lay at the origin .",
    "it had a semi - minor axis of length @xmath43 and semi - major axis of length @xmath44 , which was aligned with the @xmath45-axis .",
    "the cloud was given an initial velocity @xmath46 which lay in the @xmath47-plane , giving it an infall velocity @xmath48 and a tangential velocity @xmath49 .",
    "this ensures that specific angular momentum @xmath50 is spread over a large angle between particles at the top @xmath51 and bottom @xmath52 of the cloud . ]",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      from the bh ( short dashes ) and the mass accreted to the bh ( long dashes ) have been plotted here against time for the i - simulations .",
    "the thick solid lines show the sum of the two  this is the total mass bound to within @xmath53 .",
    "the total mass dropped from @xmath54 to @xmath55 as the initial tangential velocity @xmath49 increased from @xmath56 to @xmath57 .",
    "the majority of this is due to a decrease in mass accreted to the bh sink particle .",
    "the kinks seen in the i5 lines ( black ) at @xmath58 came about as at that time very short timestep gas particles close to the bh were forcibly accreted to it in order for it to run slightly longer . by the end of runs",
    "i5 and i10 , roughly twice as much material was accreted to the bh sink as remained bound in the gas phase . in both cases the high infall speed ( reducing structure formation time ) and low @xmath49 ( reducing @xmath45-component angular momentum ) brought about extremely effective shocking behind the bh , allowing rapid accretion of low angular momentum material . ]      it was not uncommon for sinks to form in the cloud during slow infall ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "these were either unbound or on orbits with eccentricities approaching unity .",
    "our interest however lay with star formation within a disc or streamer , as demonstrated in earlier numerical experiments ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . the masses , semi - major axes and eccentricities of the sinks we discuss in this section",
    "are shown in figure  [ mass_vs_sma_eccen ] .",
    "out - of - plane from the inner ) can be clearly distinguished . those in run  a at the largest distances were formed during infall and",
    "did not belong to the disc .",
    "perhaps most noticeably , eccentricities in the range of @xmath60 to @xmath61 were by far the most common , and covered almost the complete range of masses and semi - major axes . ]    by the end of run  a at @xmath62 , nine sinks had formed in the disc and followed orbits with semi - major axes @xmath63 and eccentricities @xmath64 . forming shortly before the simulation s end , they did not have enough time to accrete to high masses and ranged from one to three @xmath65 . while the number of sinks formed in this simulation is well below the observed number of more than a hundred ,",
    "it is likely that that number would have increased . in the integration step during which the simulation ended ,",
    "eighteen further sinks were created , more than doubling the total ; the step was only half completed . indeed the rate of sink formation was accelerating .",
    "thus our sinks are individually realistic , but our sample incomplete .",
    "the runs using the cloud with mass @xmath66 ( f and the i runs ) were able to form a greater number of sinks . by run",
    "f s end at @xmath67 , sixty - four sinks were orbiting the bh .",
    "these could be split into two groups separated by semi - major axis .",
    "the first , consisting of fifty - four sinks , had semi - major axes of @xmath68 and eccentricities @xmath69 .",
    "these began to form at @xmath70 .",
    "the second population , consisting of ten sinks , began to form at @xmath71 and had @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "the mass function of the sinks at the simulation s end are shown in figure  [ mf_density_menc_gc2d107_2pops ] .",
    "the sinks were able to accrete quickly ; by this point at the end the most massive sink had @xmath74 , and the mean mass was @xmath75 .",
    "the sinks semi - major axes and eccentricities are consistent with those observed , though the former lie at the lower end of the reported range . in this run ,",
    "the higher gas mass produced greater torques and shocks which were more effective in reducing the angular momentum of the captured material .",
    "thus the gas disc and stellar orbits were smaller and more circular than those seen in run  a.    no sinks formed in misaligned streamers in simulations with slow infall @xmath76 .",
    "we performed a re - run of run  i10 , where a streamer was formed at @xmath77 to the bh accretion disc .",
    "here we allowed the bh to accrete all material within @xmath39 without test and sinks to form with ratio of thermal to gravitational energy of one , as opposed to @xmath61 which is otherwise used . with these changes the simulation could run to @xmath78 , and",
    "the misaligned streamer was able to become dense enough that a second population of sinks formed @xmath77 from the first .",

    "mass functions are shown in figure  [ mf_infall150_tang10_density_new_gc2d133_2pops ] . while the outer misaligned sinks are at lower masses , both populations contain sinks which have been allowed to accrete to high masses .",
    "the mfs shown ( figures  [ mf_density_menc_gc2d107_2pops ] for run  f and [ mf_infall150_tang10_density_new_gc2d133_2pops ] for the re - run of i10 ) do not resemble a standard @xcite imf , being flat in logspace from one to ten @xmath65 .",
    "the number of sinks in each bin for run  f s inner population actually increases , peaking in the range of tens of solar masses before falling again .",
    "the observed imf is likewise weighted towards the higher end @xcite , apparently a violation of a ` global ' salpeter - like imf .",
    "simulations suggest this is due to high gas temperatures and preferential formation of high - mass fragments due to tidal forces @xcite .",

    "the gaseous discs which formed within run  i20 and i40 were also able to form a substantial number of sinks .",
    "considerable shocking had taken place within the gas , and so the disc and stellar orbits were small with semi - major axes @xmath89 and eccentricities @xmath90 .",
    "the mass function resembled that of the inner population of run  f ( red line , figure  [ mf_density_menc_gc2d107_2pops ] ) , but it was actually shifted even further towards high masses , peaking at @xmath91 .",
    "run  i40 formed only ten sink particles ( see figure  [ coldens_infall150_tang40_density_gc2d089_xy_zoom ] ) , with @xmath86 and @xmath87 . despite their small number ,",

    "our simulations were only able to run for a few tens of thousands of years . given the physical conditions at the end of the simulations we expect further fragmentation to occur .",
    "@xcite found that only gas which is able to cool over a timescale @xmath94 shorter than three times the dynamical timescale @xmath95 may fragment  see also @xcite and @xcite ) .",

    "<S> we follow the near radial infall of a prolate cloud onto a @xmath0 supermassive black hole in the galactic centre using smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) . </S>",
    "<S> we show that a prolate cloud oriented perpendicular to its orbital plane naturally produces a spread in angular momenta in the gas which can translate into misaligned discs as is seen in the young stars orbiting sagittarius a*. a turbulent or otherwise highly structured cloud is necessary to avoid cancelling too much angular momentum through shocks at closest approach . our standard model of a @xmath1 gas cloud brought about the formation of a disc within @xmath2 from the black hole and a larger , misaligned streamer at @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> a total of @xmath4 of gas formed these structures . </S>",
    "<S> our exploration of the simulation parameter space showed that when star formation occurred , it resulted in top - heavy imfs with stars on eccentric orbits with semi - major axes @xmath5 to @xmath2 and inclinations following the gas discs and streamers . </S>",
