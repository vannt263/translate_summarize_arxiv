    "every black face of @xmath1 except @xmath12 is not changed by surgery , so lemma [ primelemma ] implies each black face intersects at most one composite circle .",
    "now , @xmath12 shares one edge each with @xmath71 and @xmath72 . after surgery , those two edges",
    "are changed to two edges @xmath113 and @xmath114 in @xmath95 , each on the boundary of different black faces .",
    "therefore , @xmath108 shares one edge each with @xmath109 and @xmath110 , so @xmath109 and @xmath110 do not intersect with any composite circle of @xmath95 .",
    "see the figure below .",
    "let @xmath115 be the set of composite circles of @xmath95 . by claim [ black1 ] , @xmath116 , @xmath117 , @xmath118 .",
    "the number of intersections is even , so we can remove all intersections by perturbing composite circles inside @xmath108 . by lemma [ primelemma ] , @xmath119 consists of two points one in @xmath73 and another in @xmath74 . by the proof of claim [ black1 ] ,",
    "then we can connect midpoints of @xmath113 and @xmath114 with a simple arc @xmath121 such that @xmath122 ( see figure above ) .",
    "if the composite circles are not concentric , then there exists a triple @xmath123 such that @xmath124 bounds a disc inside an annulus on @xmath2 bounded by @xmath125 and @xmath126 .",
    "then @xmath121 intersects @xmath124 an even number of times , which is a contradiction .",
    "now we will complete the proof by showing ( 2 ) .",
    "the sum of turaev genera of all components of @xmath96 is @xmath127 by theorem [ surgerytheorem ] and additivity of turaev genera of diagrams under connected sum .",
    "assume that one of the components of @xmath96 is composite .",
    "suppose @xmath108 is changed to @xmath128 , which is homeomorphic to an @xmath32-holed disc after surgery . by the same argument as in claim [ black1 ] , every black face of @xmath95 which intersects composite circles of @xmath95 is divided into two faces and each face shares exactly one edge which apears after surgery with @xmath128 .",
    "therefore , every composite circle of @xmath96 intersects with edges of @xmath95 . now consider each composite circle as a union of two arcs , each of them intersects a face of @xmath96 .",
    "using the checkerboard coloring of @xmath96 , we can label each arc as a black or white arc .",
    "every face of @xmath96 except @xmath128 is a subset of a face of @xmath95 .",
    "therefore , every black and white arc except the one inside @xmath128 is a simple arc inside a face of @xmath95 . for the white arc inside @xmath128 , we can choose another arc with the same endpoints , which is an arc inside @xmath108 because its endpoints are on the edges of @xmath95 .",
    "then the black and white arcs form a composite circle of @xmath95 , which contradicts our assumption that we surgered along all composite circles to get @xmath96 .",
    "this completes the proof of theorem [ concentric ] .",
    "let @xmath1 be a prime link diagram on @xmath2 with @xmath129 .",
    "choose a cutting arc @xmath39 using an algorithm from the proof of theorem [ surgerytheorem ] and assume that @xmath39 is in a black face of @xmath1 .",
    "we surger @xmath1 along @xmath39 to get @xmath95 with @xmath130 .",
    "@xmath95 has a checkerboard coloring induced by the checkerboard coloring of @xmath1 .",
    "let @xmath49 be obtained from @xmath1 by surgery along an arc @xmath47 .",
    "we define the _ attaching edge _",
    "@xmath131 to be midpoint@xmath132 $ ] , with @xmath133 as in the definition of surgery along a cutting arc , as indicated by a dotted arc .",
    "note that if we do surgery along @xmath131 , then the attaching edge is @xmath47 , and we get @xmath1 again .    consider every composite circle of @xmath95 .",
    "we surger @xmath95 along black arcs to get @xmath96 which consists of exactly one prime diagram @xmath134 with @xmath135 , and several prime alternating diagrams .",
    "choose the checkerboard coloring of @xmath134 that comes from @xmath1 .",
    "note that every attaching edge is in one white face of @xmath134 , as in the figure below .",
    "now we need to reconstruct @xmath1 from @xmath134 and the alternating diagrams .",
    "theorem [ concentric ] implies components of @xmath96 are pairwise connected by exactly one attaching edge , if any , and no more than two attaching edges in total .",
    "below , we consider all possible cases for attaching @xmath134 and the alternating components of @xmath96 :              if two attaching edges are connected to two alternating edges of the same alternating tangle of @xmath134 , then we have an alternating @xmath10-tangle , and the alternating tangle structure of @xmath1 is shown in figure [ case1 ] .",
    "if the two attaching edges are connected to two alternating edges in different alternating tangles of @xmath134 , then we have two alternating @xmath59-tangles , and the alternating tangle structure of @xmath1 is shown in figure [ case2 ] .",

    "therefore , in this case , the alternating tangle structure is the same as one of the above cases .",
    "if one of the attaching edges is connected to @xmath137 , then we have two possibilities .",
    "first , if the sign of the alternating tangle of @xmath134 and of the alternating diagram are different , then the alternating tangle structure changes as illustrated in the figure below .",
    "then we have one alternating @xmath10-tangle , and the alternating tangle structure of @xmath1 is shown in figure [ case3 ] .",
    "if the signs are the same , then we have one alternating @xmath10-tangle which is not simply connected , and the alternating tangle structure is shown in figure [ case4 ] .",
    "if there is no attaching edge connected to @xmath137 , then the alternating tangle structure is the same as figure [ case4 ] .",
    "if one attaching edge is connected to @xmath137 and another attaching is connected to @xmath138 , then we have three possibilities . first ,",
    "if the sign of the alternating tangle of @xmath134 and of two alternating diagrams connected to @xmath134 by two attaching edges are different , then the alternating tangle structure changes as in the figure below ( left ) .",

    "if the sign of one of the alternating diagrams is the same as the sign of the alternating tangle of @xmath134 , then we can merge them into one maximally connected alternating tangle as in the figure above ( middle )",
    ". then we have one alternating @xmath10-tangle , and the alternating tangle structure of @xmath1 is shown in figure [ case3 ] .",
    "if the signs of two alternating diagrams are the same as the sign of the alternating tangle of @xmath134 , then we can merge them into one maximally connected alternating tangle as in the figure above ( right ) .",
    "this maximally connected alternating tangle is not simply connected and the alternating tangle structure of @xmath1 is shown in figure [ case4 ] .",
    "other cases are just the same as case 2 ) above .",
    "if two attaching edges are connected to alternating edges of @xmath134 , and the two alternating edges of @xmath134 are in different tangles , then we have two alternating @xmath59-tangles and the alternating tangle structure is shown in figure [ case5 ] . if two attaching edges are connected to alternating edges of @xmath134 , and the two alternating edges of @xmath134 are in the same alternating tangle , then we have one alternating @xmath10-tangle and the alternating tangle structure is shown in figure [ case6 ] .",
    "if at least one attaching edge is connected to a non - alternating edge of @xmath134 , then the alternating tangle structure changes as in the figure in the proof of case(11 ) , which implies the same alternating tangle structure as in figrue [ case5 ] or [ case6 ] .",
    "assume that the two alternating tangles adjacent to @xmath71 are positive tangles , as in the figure above .",

    "otherwise , the alternating tangle structure of @xmath1 can be as in figure [ case4 ] or figure [ case6 ] .",
    "if two attaching edges are not connected to @xmath137 , then the alternating tangle structure is shown in figure [ case4 ] .",

    "are used in the proof .",
    "first , all faces of @xmath1 in the channel region are considered in case(11 ) and case(21 ) .",
    "it remains to show that all the faces in the alternating tangles are used in the proof . from the checkerboard coloring and the cycle of alternating @xmath5-tangle structure",
    ", we can show that every face in the alternating tangle can be adjacent to at most two faces in the channel region .",
    "therefore we can categorize every faces in the alternating tangle by the number of adjacent faces in the channel region and the existence of cutting arcs in adjacent faces .",
    "these are considered in the cases ( 12 - 14 ) and cases ( 22 - 24 ) .",
    "lastly , we show that all eight cases are distinct up to isotopy on @xmath2 . first , case 4 is distinct from all others because it has a non - simply connected alternating tangle .",
    "if every ribbon contains no alternating tangles , then cases 1 , 3 and 6 have the same alternating tangle structure .",
    "similarly , cases 2 and 5 have the same alternating tangle structure .",
    "cases 1,3,6 have a @xmath10-tangle , and cases 2,5 have two @xmath59-tangles , so they are distinct .",
    "cases 7 and 8 are distinct from the others because their alternating tangle structure consists of only @xmath5-tangles .",
    "case 8 has @xmath5-tangles adjacent to four others which case 7 does not , so cases 7 and 8 are distinct .",
    "we now distinguish cases 1 , 3 and 6 . with many alternating tangles in every ribbon , the single @xmath10-tangle",
    "is connected to four different alternating @xmath5-tangles .",
    "if we orient the boundary of the @xmath10-tangle , non - alternating edges connected to the boundary have a cyclic ordering .",
    "if we compare the three cyclic orderings , then they are distinct up to a cyclic permutation .",
