    "ngc  1275 is the central galaxy of the perseus cluster .",
    "it is known as a nearby seyfert galaxy ( @xmath5 ) and hosts the compact radio source 3c  84 .",
    "cosmic rays accelerated around the central supermassive black hole ( smbh ) may be playing an important role in offsetting radiative cooling of the cool core of the cluster @xcite .",
    "the proximity of the object allows us to make detailed observations about the environment around the smbh and its activities .",
    "early vlbi observations showed that 3c  84 has complicated structures on a scale of pc ; a mushroom - like jet is expanding southward from a bright compact core .",
    "the apparent velocity of the southern jet has been estimated to be @xmath6 @xcite . from this velocity , it has been suggested that this expanding jet relates to an outburst in 1959 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the counterjet of this southern jet has been discovered to the north of the core @xcite .",
    "the ratio of the apparent distances of the two jets from the core suggests that the observing angle to the jet direction is @xmath7@xmath8 @xcite .",
    "the angle between the jets and the line of sight has great importance for the gamma - ray spectrum of ngc  1275 @xcite .",
    "recently , new activity in the core has been reported .",
    "@xcite showed that a new component ( c3 in the paper ) emerged in the central subparsec region of the core ( c1 ) .",
    "they indicated that this component relates to a radio outburst that began in 2005 .",
    "moreover , since the gamma - ray luminosity of ngc  1275 started to increase around 2005 @xcite , the new component is seemingly associated with the gamma - ray activity . since the new component is moving toward south from the core , its counterjet , if any , is expected to appear to the north of the core .    in this letter",
    ", we report the discovery of the northern counterjet . from the ratio of the apparent lengths of the southern and northern jets from the core",
    ", we estimate the inclination angle of the jets .",
    "we also discuss the environment in the vicinity of the smbh based on the inverted spectrum of the northern jet .",
    "we adopt @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 . for these cosmological parameters , 1",
    "mas corresponds to 0.36  pc .",
    "we use the calibrated very long base line array ( vlba ) data of 3c  84 provided by monitoring of jets in active galactic nuclei with vlba experiments ( mojave ) and boston university ( bu ) blazar monitoring program .",
    "the data were taken on 22 january 2016 at 15  ghz and on 5 december 2015 at 43  ghz .",
    "the imaging was done using clean algorithm implemented in the difmap software .",
    "data reduction was performed using the nrao astronomical imaging processing system ( aips ) .",
    "[ fig:43ghz ] shows a 43 ghz image of 3c  84 . from the core ( c1 )",
    ", a lobe - like feature extends southward , which we call the southern jet .",
    "the hotspot ( c3 ) is clearly seen in the jet . the hotspot location seems to be shifted to the east compared to the previous 43 ghz vlba image @xcite . a new component , which we call n1 , is recognised to the north of the core . while the background noise level is @xmath12 , the peak flux of n1 is @xmath13 , which means @xmath14 detection .",
    "[ fig:15ghz ] shows a 15 ghz image of 3c  84 .",
    "the north component n1 can also be seen at the same position in fig .",
    "[ fig:43ghz ] .",
    "the background noise level is @xmath15 and the peak flux of n1 is @xmath16 , which means @xmath17 detection .",
    "thus , it is unlikely that the detection is false .",

    "from the ratio of apparent lengths of the southern and north jets from the core and from the apparent jet velocity , we can estimate the angle of the jets to the line of sight @xmath24 .",
    "the ratio @xmath25 is represented by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the jet velocity normalised by the light speed @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "the observed velocity of the approaching jet is given by @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "thus , the inclination angle is @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "@xcite estimated that the apparent velocity of the approaching component ( c3 ) is @xmath31 .",
    "we use the 43  ghz image in fig .",
    "[ fig:43ghz ] to derive the ratio @xmath25 , because the resolution is higher than the 15  ghz image in fig .",
    "[ fig:15ghz ] .",
    "we assume that the tips of the southern and northern jets are c3 and n1 , respectively .",
    "the position of c3 and n1 are derived by fitting them with a gaussian using aips task jmfit .",
    "we ignore the error of the position associated with the fit , because it is much smaller than the beam size ( @xmath20  mas ) .",
    "the position of the core ( c1 ) is derived in the same way , and we assume that it is the position of the black hole . the ratio @xmath25 is given by the ratio of the distance from the black hole to c3 to the distance from the black hole to n1 , and it is @xmath32 , where the error comes from the beam size .",
    "thus , we obtain @xmath2 from equation  ( [ eq : theta ] ) , and @xmath33 from equations  ( [ eq : d ] ) or ( [ eq : ba ] ) .",
    "the obtained angle is not much different from that of the outer pair of old jets ( @xmath34@xmath8 ) associated with an outburst of 3c  84 around 1959 @xcite .",
    "moreover , the jet direction on the sky is similar to that of the old jets @xcite .",
    "these suggest that the jet direction has not much changed over the last half a century .",
    "note that the position of the core may be affected by an opacity - induced core shift .",
    "for m  87 , the core shift is 0.0070.01  pc at 43  ghz @xcite , which corresponds to @xmath35  mas for ngc  1275 .",
    "thus , the effect of the core shift is probably negligible .",
    "however , fig .",
    "6 of @xcite shows that the core has a strong northern ridge for the inner mas or so at higher frequencies .",
    "the position of the peak of the core may depend on resolution due to blending of the inner features .",
    "thus , as an extreme case , we set the position of the black hole at the northern edge of the core ( 0.3  mas north of the peak ) , and we calculate the jet parameters .",
    "we found that @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 .",
    "the angle @xmath24 is still fairly large .",
    "we expect that the new jets ( c3 and n1 ) are associated with gamma - ray emission that started to increase around 2005 @xcite .",
    "the obtained inclination angle has an implication for theories on gamma - ray radiation from jets in radio galaxies .",
    "a popular idea is that ngc  1275 is a misaligned blazar .",
    "however , although one - zone synchrotron - self compton models may explain the observed broadband spectral energy distribution ( sed ) , they require an untypical low bulk - lorentz factor @xcite . even if two - zone spine - layer jet models are considered , they conflict with the relatively large angle that we obtained ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "this is because the gamma - rays with energies above a few tens of gev are absorbed in the luminous infrared radiation field associated with the fast spine emission @xcite .",
    "moreover , in spite of the large inclination angle , the gamma - ray luminosity of ngc  1275 is very large and is comparable to those of blazars @xcite .",
    "these facts suggest that the misaligned blazar interpretation may not be applied for ngc  1275 .",
    "the spectral index of the radio emission can give us information on absorption toward an object .",
    "thus , we estimate the spectral indices for the southern and the northern components . for that purpose",
    ", we make an image at 43  ghz with a convolving beam of @xmath22  mas to match the resolution of the 15  ghz observation ( fig .",
    "[ fig:15ghz ] ) .",
    "then , we estimate the fluxes of the components c3 and n1 by fitting them with a gaussian using aips task jmfit for both of the 43 and 15  ghz images . from the ratio of the flux at 43  ghz to that at 15  ghz , we find that the spectral index of c3 is @xmath39 and that of n1 is @xmath40 , where the spectral index is defined as @xmath41 .",
    "the index of c3 is the one for a typical synchrotron emission region , which means that the component is not much affected by absorption . on the other hand",
    ", n1 has an inverted spectrum and it is likely to be absorbed .",
    "considering the inclination angle of the jets ( @xmath42 ) , a natural explanation is that the black hole is surrounded by an optically - thick accretion disk , which is perpendicular to the jets and obscures only the northern component .    if the southern and the northern components are symmetric , and if there is no absorption , the ratio of brightness between the two components ( c3 and n1 ) is written as @xmath43 where @xmath44 is ether 2 or 3 for a continuous jet or single component , respectively @xcite . using the values of @xmath24 and",
    "@xmath27 derived in section  [ sec : angle ] and assuming that @xmath45 , we can predict that the brightness ratio should be @xmath46 for @xmath47 , and @xmath48 for @xmath49 .",
    "the observed ratios are much larger and they are @xmath50 at 43  ghz and @xmath51 at 15  ghz .",
    "these large values clearly indicate that the north component is actually absorbed by the accretion disk .",
    "the most likely explanation for the inverted spectrum and the large ratio of brightness is free - free absorption @xcite .",
    "the free - free optical depth can be written as @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the temperature of the absorbing medium , @xmath54 is the electron density ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and @xmath55 is the disk depth along the line of sight . here , we assumed that the absorbing medium is a pure hydrogen plasma with a uniform density , and that the electron density equals the proton density .",
    "for @xmath56  k and @xmath5743  ghz , the gaunt factor is @xmath58 ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we can estimate the optical depth from the relation of @xmath59 for @xmath47 , the optical depth is @xmath60 at 43  ghz , and @xmath61 at 15  ghz .",
    "we can calculate the density of the disk using equation  ( [ eq : tau ] ) . assuming that @xmath62  k and @xmath63  pc , which is the apparent distance between c1 and n1 , the density is @xmath64 for 43  ghz , and @xmath65 for 15  ghz .",
    "the density is not much different when @xmath49 .",
    "if the disk is thinner or @xmath55 is smaller , the density is higher .",
    "thus , we conclude that the gas density is @xmath66 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the ratio of the observed optical depths at 43 and 15  ghz suggests that @xmath67 , which is different from @xmath68 in equation  ( [ eq : tau ] ) .",
    "one explanation may be that the absorbing medium is highly inhomogeneous and it consists of regions of @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "if this is the case , the averaged optical depth is less dependent on the observational frequency .",
    "if a temperature of @xmath62  k is assumed , the optical depth @xmath71 we obtained and equation  ( [ eq : tau ] ) mean that the emission measure ( em ) is @xmath72 for 43  ghz and @xmath73 for 15  ghz at the position of n1 ( a projected distance of @xmath74  pc from the core ) . on the other hand , @xcite found that the em at @xmath753.6  pc is @xmath76 based on the data taken in january 1995 or @xmath77 based on the data taken in october 1995 and we have corrected the difference from ours . ] .",
    "if we extrapolate these to @xmath74  pc , the em is @xmath78 .",
    "thus , the em we obtained is @xmath797 times larger than the extrapolated one .",
    "however , this may be because @xcite derived their profiles for a fairly narrow range of distance . for @xmath8030  pc",
    ", @xcite indicated that the em is @xmath81 if @xmath62  k. if we fit the above data over the whole range ( @xmath8230  pc ) with a single power - law , they are well represented by @xmath83 .",
    "@xcite discussed the density of the surrounding medium in the direction of the outer old jets or perpendicular to the accretion disk in ngc  1275 . here",
    ", we apply this argument to the new jets shown in figs .",
    "[ fig:43ghz ] and  [ fig:15ghz ] .",
    "the momentum balance along the jet is given by @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the kinematic power of the jet , @xmath86 is the density of the ambient gas just ahead of the jet , @xmath87 is the velocity the hotspot ( the jet head ) , and @xmath88 is the cross - section area of the jet head .",
    "the density profile of the ambient gas is assumed to be @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the three - dimensional distance from the black hole and @xmath91 is the position of the jet head .",
    "note that since the new jets are propagating in the old jets , the ambient gas here means the gas in the old jets .",
    "we implicitly assume that the old jets are filled with a significant fraction of thermal gas .",
    "the age of the jet is given by @xmath92 from equation  ( 8) in @xcite , where @xmath93 is the bondi radius and @xmath94 .",
    "thus , equation  ( [ eq : tage ] ) in this letter can be obtained using the relation of @xmath95 . ] .",
    "the apparent distance between the black hole and c3 is @xmath96  mas .",
    "considering the inclination angle ( @xmath42 ) , the actual jet length is @xmath97  pc .",
    "the width of the southern lobe at the position of c3 is @xmath98  mas ( fig  [ fig:43ghz ] ) , and thus the area of the jet head is @xmath99 .",
    "the jet velocity is @xmath100 ( section  [ sec : angle ] ) .",
    "following @xcite , we assume @xmath101 , although results are insensitive to the value of @xmath102 .",
    "we also assume that the current jet power @xmath85 is comparable to the average jet power in the past ( @xmath103  yr ) . from the size of x - ray cavities",
    ", @xcite estimated that the average power is @xmath104 .",
    "based on these assumptions , we can derive @xmath86 so that the condition of @xmath105 is satisfied using equation  ( [ eq : lj ] ) .",
    "we find that the number density of the ambient gas at @xmath106 is @xmath107 .",
    "the age of the jets is @xmath108  yr ( equation  ( [ eq : tage ] ) ) , which means that the jets was born in 2003 or 2004 .",
    "the birth time is not much different from the beginning of the recent activity around 2005 @xcite .",
    "note that for the outer old jets , @xcite obtained @xmath109 for @xmath110 and @xmath111  pc .",
    "if @xmath105 , the density is @xmath112 .",
    "it is interesting to note that there was a feature at the position of n1 in the full resolution 15 and 22 ghz images shown in fig .  5 of @xcite and in the deep 23 ghz image shown in fig .  1 of @xcite .",
    "the observations were made in october 1995 for the former and in september 1998 for the latter .",
    "although 15  ghz data ( mojave ) have been available since 1999 , noticeable features are not recognised at the position of n1 before september 2015 . for 43  ghz data ( bu ) , which have been available since 2010",
    ", a noticeable feature appears at the position of n1 in december 2015 .",
    "since both mojave and bu observations are not deep , we can not deny that dim features had been overlooked .",
    "if there has always been a feature there , it might be the result of some other effect .",
    "for example , there may be a groove on the accretion disk , and when a bright component in the jet ( e.g. a knot ) passes behind the groove , n1 may be brightened .",
    "if the emergence of n1 at the end of 2015 is attributed to the passage of the hot spot of the new jet behind the groove , the main conclusions of this paper do not change . on the other hand ,",
    "n1 may be associated with an internal structure in the jet that stays at the same position ( e.g. a re - collimation shock ) while the luminosity changes . long and deep observations are required to investigate these possibilities .",
    "we discovered a new feature @xmath0  mas ( @xmath1  pc ) north of the central core of ngc  1275 ( 3c  84 ) at 15 and 43  ghz with vlba .",
    "this feature is considered to be the counterjet of the jet expanding southward from the core that launched around 2005 . from the ratio of the lengths of the two jets , we estimated the inclination angle of the jet and found that it is @xmath2 , which is not much different from that of the outer old jets that launched around 1959 .",
    "the northern jet has a strongly inverted spectrum , which indicates that it is absorbed by an accretion disk around the smbh . from the brightness of the northern jet , we calculated the density of the disk and found that it is @xmath113 .",
