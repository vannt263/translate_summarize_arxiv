    "the @xmath8 decay has been the subject of much interest over the years . because of",
    "the transformation properties of the weak current under parity and @xmath9-parity , @xmath10-lepton decay to an odd number of pions is expected to occur exclusively through the axial vector current , ignoring isospin - violating effects . since @xmath11 and @xmath12 are good quantum numbers of the hadronic current from weak decays , the weak axial current produces systems of pions with @xmath13 or @xmath14 odd @xmath9-parity and odd numbers of pions .    the @xmath15 system in @xmath8 is expected to be produced dominantly through the poorly understood @xmath16 @xmath17 where @xmath2 in an @xmath3-wave decay .",
    "although it is possible that the @xmath15 system can be produced through the @xmath18 @xmath19 this is expected to be suppressed by the pcac ( partially conserved axial current ) hypothesis .",
    "it has been known for some time that simple models do not provide a satisfactory description .",
    "for example , argus @xcite found that the model of khn and santamaria @xcite and that of isgur , morningstar , and reader @xcite did not describe their @xmath8 data satisfactorily .    here",
    "we report the preliminary results of a model - dependent fit of the substructure in @xmath20 decays .",
    "the work is based on the analysis of @xmath21 @xmath22 events @xcite .",
    "in addition to fitting the substructure with various @xmath17 decay modes , fits for the production of the @xmath15 system via the @xmath18 @xmath23 are included .",
    "these results are compared to the substructure in @xmath24 previously reported @xcite .    throughout this paper",
    "the charge conjugate versions of decays are implied for brevity and clarity .",
    "this analysis is based on 4.67  fb@xmath25 of @xmath26 colliding beam data collected at center - of - mass energy energies @xmath27  gev with the cleo  ii detector at the cornell electron storage ring ( cesr ) .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath28 @xmath29 events .",
    "@xmath22 events are selected from a topology in which the @xmath30 decays into a single charged particle plus a @xmath31 and the @xmath32 decays into three charged particles plus a @xmath33 ( 1 versus 3 charged - particle topology ) . selected events are required to have four well - constructed charged tracks coming from the interaction region , and the net charge of the tracks is required to be zero .",
    "no more than one track is allowed to be identified as an @xmath34 or @xmath35 the most isolated track is identified , and the remaining three tracks are required to be @xmath36 away from it .",
    "events with photons ( isolated electromagnetic showers not associated with a track ) are rejected .",
    "events that satisfy the hypothesis @xmath37  gev are rejected in order to eliminate events containing @xmath38 decays .",
    "finally , the 2-dimensional cut shown in figure  [ twodcut ] is used to reject events with missing tracks and/or energy along the beam pipe .",
    "application of these cuts yields 145,000  @xmath22 events .",
    "= 7.5 cm    the @xmath39 effective mass spectrum resulting from these cuts is shown in figure  [ threepimass ] .",
    "the background , indicated by the shaded histogram , which amounts to about 11% of the events in the spectrum .",
    "monte carlo studies show that this background is from other @xmath10-decays : @xmath40 comes from @xmath10-events with missing @xmath41 ( s ) and @xmath40 is from @xmath10-events with @xmath42 charged @xmath43 monte carlo studies indicate that backgrounds from multihadronic @xmath44 events , @xmath45 events , and qed events are negligible .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the isoscalar sub - resonances in the decay of the @xmath17 [ @xmath46 @xmath47 and @xmath48 play a large role in the fits . to demonstrate the need for these isoscalars ,",
    "the data were fitted without them .",
    "projections of the dalitz plat without the presence of these isoscalars are shown in figures  [ fig:6 ] and [ fig:7 ] .",
    "for the projection onto the @xmath49 axis ( figure  [ fig:6 ] ) , the lack of all three isoscalars results in a poor fit for @xmath50  gev@xmath51 for the projection onto the @xmath52 axis ( figure  [ fig:7 ] ) , the presence of @xmath53 is needed for all regions of @xmath54 especially those of lower @xmath55 values .",
    "these results support the resonance substructure previously reported for the cleo  ii @xmath7 @xcite data , which are based on @xmath56 lepton - tagged events .",
    "the fit results on these events are given in table  [ table:2 ] for the reader s convenience .",
    "both analyses find that axial vector amplitudes with isoscalars , especially @xmath57 are large .",
    "this work is a new measurement of substructure in @xmath58 a model - dependent unbinned maximum likelihood fit on 145,000 events was performed using an axial vector component [ @xmath4 primary resonance and several subresonances , including isoscalars ] and a pseudoscalar component [ @xmath59 plus several subresonances ] . as expected , this decay is dominated by @xmath60 with subsequent @xmath61 @xmath3-wave decay .",
    "however , it is also apparent that other @xmath17 decay modes are present .",
    "in particular , @xmath17 decay into isoscalars [ @xmath46 @xmath47 and @xmath48 is significant .",
    "the @xmath62 is especially prominent .",
    "these results are consistent with the earlier cleo  ii results for @xmath63 @xcite .",
    "both analyses find that axial - vector amplitudes with isoscalars , especially @xmath57 are large .",
    "regarding non - axial - vector contributions , inclusion of the @xmath18 @xmath6 improves the fit to the data in the expected regions , but the need for it is not compelling .",
    "it is hoped that the future cleo - c dataset will clarify some of these issues .",
    "this work represents the work of many cleo collaborators , especially jason w. hinson , jon urheim , and alan j. weinstein .",
