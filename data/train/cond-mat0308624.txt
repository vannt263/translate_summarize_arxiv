    "graph theory and its applications play an important role in many areas of scientific research , from pure mathematics , to physics , statistics , biology and social sciences . in particular random graphs , that is graphs extracted with some probability from a suitable statistical ensemble , are interesting as a mean to implement the intrinsic complexity and/or chaotic nature of many physical , biological and social systems @xcite .    among graphs , trees",
    "( that is graphs without loops ) play a distinguished role : they retain a deep interest and wide applicability while still being amenable to detailed analytic studies .",
    "random trees appears in several distinct contexts , like polymer physics , critical percolation @xcite and two  dimensional quantum gravity ( branched polymers @xcite ) .",
    "generically , in a random graph the local coordination is itself a random variable taking values according to some probability distribution ; while in the classical erds - rnyi theory of random graphs @xcite this distribution is poissonian , in several examples of `` experimental '' complex networks it turns out to be `` scale - free '' , that is with a long power - law tail @xcite .",
    "this implies that on an infinite scale - free graph nodes with diverging coordination are rather frequent , causing some subtleties in the application of the law of large numbers .    in this paper",
    "we concentrate our attention to homogeneous scale - free random trees subject only to the physically natural constraint of being embeddable in a finite dimensional euclidean space .",
    "this class of random trees has been studied already in @xcite , although from a viewpoint different from ours : while in these works only some statistical averages relevant to characterize the geometry of these trees were analyzed , we study here in depth the probability distributions of the basic observables which specify the intrinsic geometry .",
    "our results apply therefore to any single `` generic '' ( infinite ) scale - free random tree and not just to their statistical ensemble .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows .",
    "first of all we recall some definitions of graph theory and we introduce the algorithm used to build homogeneous random trees , summarizing known results . the local connectivity dimension is then obtained from the scaling properties of the probability distributions for the volume and the surface of the spheres centered at the origin of the tree - constructing algorithm .",
    "details of the scaled probabilities are studied and their asymptotic behavior is determined . then the probability distributions for the graph - averaged volume and the surface are considered ; the average connectivity dimension is extracted from their scaling properties .    our results for the growth properties of a random tree can be summarized in very concise heuristic formulas as follows : consider a sphere ( intrinsically defined in terms of the chemical distance alone ) of radius @xmath0 centered on some node ; for large @xmath0 the volume @xmath1 of the sphere and the coordination fluctuation @xmath2 within the sphere are random variables simply related as @xmath3 this relation apply to all random trees with bounded growth rate ( see below ) regardless of whether @xmath2 has a finite limit as @xmath4 or not . in the former case ,",
    "as it happens for instance on trees with bounded coordination , one reads immediately out the connectivity dimension @xmath5 . in the latter case",
    ", one need to estimate the asymptotic dependence of @xmath2 on @xmath1 . for scale - free trees with tail exponent @xmath6 ( see below for the proper definitions ) , one finds @xmath7 , yielding the @xmath8dependent connectivity dimension @xmath9 suppose instead that one is interested in the graph - averaged volume @xmath10 obtained by averaging over all locations of the center of the sphere ( for a finite tree with large volume @xmath11 ) .",
    "the random variable @xmath10 is related to the coordination fluctuation @xmath12 _ over the whole tree _ just as before , that is @xmath13 now the behavior in @xmath0 is always quadratic , regardless of the way the coordinations are distributed .",
    "of course , in the scale - free trees with @xmath6 one has @xmath14 , making it impossible to consider the standard thermodynamic limit @xmath15 .",
    "nonetheless , we find that a well defined limit exists for the `` renormalized '' volume @xmath16 . therefore ,",
    "in all cases we conclude for the average connectivity dimension @xmath17 finally , in the last section , the analysis of the probability distribution for the effective squared mass , defined through the gaussian model on the tree , allows us to rigorously determine also the local spectral dimension @xmath18 .",
    "it fulfills the long - conjectured @xcite relation @xmath19 already verified in @xcite through a general but completely different argument .",
    "a graph @xmath20 is defined by a set of nodes ( finite or countable ) , pairwise connected by a set of unordered links .",
    "if the set of nodes is finite , its cardinality will be denoted by @xmath21 .",
    "the coordination number ( or degree , or simply coordination ) of a node @xmath22 is the number of its nearest neighbors and it is denoted by @xmath23 . the intrinsic properties of the graph are determined only by the connections between the nodes ; the metric is given by the so - called chemical distance : the distance @xmath24 is equal to the number of links of the shortest connected path between @xmath22 and @xmath25 .",
    "this distance is used to define spheres ; the `` volume '' @xmath26 is defined as the number of nodes of the radius @xmath0 sphere centered at node @xmath22 , and the `` surface '' @xmath27 is the number of nodes of the corresponding spherical shell . here",
    "we shall consider connected graphs in the limit of infinitely many nodes .    given a function @xmath28 defined on the nodes , its average value @xmath29 is defined as the infinite radius limit of the average over spheres ; if such limit exists , it does not depend on the center of the spheres provided @xmath28 is bounded from below and the graph has a bounded growth rate @xcite , that is the surface vanishes with respect to the volume in the infinite size limit .",
    "the properties of graphs can be described by various parameters ; here we consider the connectivity dimension @xcite and the spectral dimension @xcite .",
    "the connectivity dimension describes how the volume of spheres scales with its radius @xmath0 for @xmath30 ; we can define a local connectivity dimension @xmath31 using the spheres centered on any given node @xmath22 @xmath32 it is not difficult to show that @xmath31 does not depend on @xmath22 when the graph has a bounded growth rate .",
    "we can define also an average dimension @xmath33 , if the average volume is used ( provided the limit defining it exists finite ) @xmath34 these two connectivity dimensions usually coincide , but on strongly inhomogeneous graphs they can be different @xcite .",
    "the spectral dimension is related to long time properties of random walks on the graph , as well as to many other physical properties such as the infrared behavior of the gaussian model @xcite . on a generic connected graph @xmath20 this model is defined by assigning a real - valued random variable @xmath35 to each node @xmath36 with the hamiltonian @xmath37 where @xmath38 denotes nearest neighbors pairs of nodes and @xmath39 is a free parameter ( the squared mass in field  theoretic sense ) .",
    "the spectral dimension is determined by the infrared @xmath40 singularity of the diagonal element of the covariance @xmath41 where @xmath42 denotes standard gibbs expectation values weighted with @xmath43 .",
    "one can show that @xmath18 does not depend on the choice of the node @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "as for the connectivity dimension , it is possible to split the spectral dimension into a local one and an average one . the definition in eq .",
    "evidently corresponds to the local one ; the average spectral dimension @xmath44 characterizes in the same way the singularity of the graph average of @xmath45 .",
    "again , the two dimensions usually coincide , but on strongly inhomogeneous graphs they can be different @xcite .",
    "suppose now that a certain statistical ensemble @xmath46 of ( infinite ) graphs is given . as a consequence , connectivity and spectral dimensions become in principle random variables with probability distributions derived from the `` microscopic '' one specifying @xmath46 .",
    "consider the connectivity dimension : if the graphs of @xmath46 are rooted , we can use the root , denoted by @xmath47 , as the center of the spheres those growth define @xmath31 ; then the corresponding volumes @xmath48 are random variables distributed with some probability @xmath49 $ ] . if this probability has a well defined scaling behavior for @xmath50 , that is @xmath51 \\simeq \\frac1{r^d}\\ , p\\!\\left(\\frac{v}{r^d}\\right)\\",
    "] ] then the random variable @xmath52 has a well defined probability distribution in the limit @xmath50 and we may write again @xmath53 as in eq . , identifying @xmath54 with a non - fluctuating local connectivity dimension @xmath31 .",
    "in other words @xmath31 is a property of a `` generic '' specimen of the ensemble , that is a a property of @xmath46 itself .",
    "a similar argument applies to the average connectivity dimension @xmath33 and to the spectral dimensions using the random variable @xmath45 and its graph average .",
    "an alternative approach is used in ref .",
    "@xcite , where averages in the canonical or grand - canonical ensembles of certain random trees ( _ i.e. _ graphs without loops ) are studied rather than a single `` generic '' sample tree .",
    "two parameters are introduced to describe the intrinsic geometry of these trees , also called `` branched polymers '' : the hausdorff dimensions @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "the former is related to how the average two - point distance on graphs with @xmath11 nodes scales with the size @xmath11 : @xmath57 the latter ( called local hausdorff dimension in @xcite ) is related to the behavior of the two - points correlation function @xmath58 ( proportional to the number of couples of nodes which are at distance @xmath0 ) for distances which are large , but much smaller than @xmath59 : @xmath60 it is claimed in @xcite that @xmath55 and @xmath56 differ on a certain class of `` exotic '' random trees characterized by unbounded local coordinations .    actually , it is not a priori obvious if and how parameters such as @xmath55 and @xmath56 are connected to the connectivity dimensions @xmath31 and @xmath33 , although it is common lore to identify the hausdorff dimension with the connectivity dimension when no distinction is made about local or average dimensions .",
    "one of the aims of the present work is just to fully answer this question in the case of homogeneous random trees , as we shall see below .",
    "homogeneous random trees are built by the random independent extraction of every node s degree from a given distribution @xmath61 .",
    "this process can be formulated as a galton - watson branching process @xcite ; in particular , since we are interested in trees with bounded growth rate , we must consider the critical galton - watson case .",
    "the given coordination distribution must be properly normalized @xmath62 and the average coordination must be equal to 2 because of the condition of bounded growth rate ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath63 clearly these sums have a finite number of addends if the coordination is bounded , while they become series if it is unbounded as in the scale - free case .",
    "the series , however , must be properly convergent in order equations  ( [ fnorm ] ) and  ( [ favg ] ) to hold , so that @xmath61 must vanish faster than @xmath64 for @xmath65 .",
    "let us also introduce the probability generating function @xmath66 @xmath67 which enjoys the properties @xmath68 easily derived from those of @xmath61 .",
    "a branching process effectively ends when a shell ( that is a given generation of sibling branches ) is made only by nodes with coordination 1 , so that the next shell is empty .",
    "the trees produced in this way are all finite because the surviving probability after @xmath0 generations vanishes for @xmath50 in the critical galton - watson process @xcite .",
    "since we are interested in the thermodynamic limit we have two possibilities @xcite .",
    "the first one is an explicit preconditioning on non - extinction : this means that modified branching probabilities are used to avoid finite trees , while keeping unaltered the properties of the infinite trees @xcite .",
    "this is achieved if the root coordination is chosen with probability @xmath61 while on every successive shell the coordination of the first node is extracted with a modified probability distribution @xmath69 .",
    "the other possibility consists in calculating probabilities conditioned on the number of nodes @xmath11 of the resulting trees , and then take the limit @xmath15 . in this latter case",
    "the root coordination must be extracted with the refined probability @xmath70 since the root has as many branches as its coordination while every other node has one branch less than its coordination [ see section 3.1 of ref .",
    "@xcite for details ] .      in @xcite and",
    "@xcite the geometrical and spectral properties of bounded random trees were determined using non - extinction preconditioning .",
    "the surface and volume probability , in the large radius limit , are shown to be function only of the scaled variables @xmath71 and @xmath72 , respectively . moreover , after the discussion of the auto - averaging property , also average surface and volume are fully analyzed .",
    "these results allow the rigorous determination of the connectivity dimension , both local and average : @xmath73 .",
    "the study of the gaussian model on such trees leads also to the determination of the spectral dimension @xmath74 . using a simple scaling hypothesis it is shown that the relation @xmath75 should hold on a wider class of random trees .",
    "an important universality property is also found : all the average values and probability distributions in the large radius limit depend on the @xmath61 distribution only through its second moment or , equivalently , @xmath76 .",
    "this parameter quantifies the coordination fluctuations , since @xmath77 ^ 2\\ ] ] and characterizes all asymptotic behaviors .",
    "altogether , these results can be summarized as @xmath78 meaning that @xmath79 $ ] , as @xmath50 , is a random variable with a well defined universal probability distribution .",
    "the approach based of the grand - canonical ensemble of branched polymers yields the result @xmath80 when the coordination of each node is bounded .",
    "this corresponds to the `` generic phase '' of random trees according to @xcite .      in this paper",
    "we turn to scale - free trees , that is trees whose coordination distribution has a long power ",
    "law tail : @xmath81 where @xmath82 .",
    "when the coordination is unbounded , the function @xmath66 may have singularities ; in the scale - free case it becomes singular for @xmath83 .",
    "for any non - integer exponent the singularity has a different , logarithmic , form ; however , since the final results will be analytic in @xmath84 , one is able to extend them also to integer values of @xmath84 . ]",
    "its expansion contains a term proportional to @xmath85 , that is : @xmath86 where @xmath87 is analytic in @xmath83 @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "therefore , if @xmath6 , @xmath90 diverges for @xmath91 ; since we found @xmath76 to be an important parameter in the bounded coordination case , we expect this divergence to have many important consequences . as a first example it causes the divergence of @xmath92 , the expected volume of the balls around the root of the branching process .",
    "this can be intuitively explained , using non - extinction preconditioning , because on every shell the coordination of one node is chosen with probability distribution @xmath93 , whose first moment is infinite .",
    "if auto - averaging holds , then also @xmath94 would diverge on a single scale - free tree and the definition of average connectivity dimension appears troublesome for scale - free trees .",
    "thus , in order to deal with finite graph - averaged quantities , we will also use the finite volume approach , regarding the volume @xmath11 as a regulator .",
    "we may then find an heuristic argument based on eq .",
    "( [ vtor ] ) to determine the connectivity dimensions @xmath31 and @xmath33 for scale - free random trees .",
    "first of all , if @xmath95 nothing changes because @xmath76 is still finite , so that @xmath96 . on the contrary ,",
    "if @xmath6 , we have to face the divergence of @xmath76 .",
    "but coordination fluctuations are finite for a finite number @xmath97 of nodes , and diverge with @xmath97 in a way fixed by the long tail of @xmath61 , since all coordination extractions are independent .",
    "let @xmath98 be the largest coordination extracted , estimated from @xmath99 then we may estimate fluctuations by @xmath100^{3-{\\beta } } = n^{{\\nu}}\\ ] ] where we defined the exponent @xmath101 as @xmath102 thus for the local growth we have the consistency relation @xmath103 which implies @xmath104 when the graph - averaged @xmath94 is considered for trees of @xmath11 nodes , the coordination fluctuation over the whole graph should be used instead : @xmath105 from this we read the scaling exponent @xmath106 independently on @xmath11 , but without the standard thermodynamic limit .",
    "of course this is not a real proof and a more rigorous approach confirming these results is adopted in the following sections ( see also appendix [ sec : prob - distribution ] ) ; at any rate , these exponents are the same as those calculated for scale - free branched polymers with @xmath6 in the grand - canonical approach : @xmath107 @xcite and @xmath108 @xcite .",
    "the probability @xmath109 $ ] ( @xmath49 $ ] ) for the surface ( volume ) of the radius @xmath0 sphere around the root of an infinite tree can be found , recursively on @xmath0 , using the modified probabilities given by explicit preconditioning ( see @xcite , where a slightly different notation is used ) .",
    "the corresponding generating functions @xmath110 \\\\    g^v_r({\\lambda } ) = \\sum_v { \\lambda}^v \\ , { \\mathrm{pr}}[v_r(o)=v]\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] satisfy functional recursion rules easier to analyze , given by equations  ( 15 ) and ( 16 ) in @xcite , that is @xmath111 where @xmath112 these recursions involve only @xmath66 and @xmath113 , which are finite for @xmath114 for every value of @xmath82 , and therefore can be solved numerically with high accuracy for any @xmath0 ( subject only to computational limits ) , thus providing a solution of our problem from a practical point of view .",

    "the agreement is good , and we notice the power law tail with exponent that can be estimated as @xmath123 . in other cases ( not shown ) this is always equal to @xmath124 .    analytically , upon substitution of eqs .",

    "we study the local growth properties of scale - free random trees of finite volume @xmath11 .",
