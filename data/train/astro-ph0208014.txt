    "parallaxes of late - m , l , and t dwarfs have been measured from images taken over the past several years with the 1.55 m strand astrometric telescope at the u.s . naval observatory .",
    "the present results have been published recently by dahn et al .",
    "the parallaxes are necessary for many purposes , including comparison with evolutionary models , analyzing the kinematics , determining ages , determining temperatures , and identifying outlying objects ( perhaps binaries or young objects ) .",
    "when faint companions to bright stars with hipparcos parallaxes are included , there are now nearly 30 field l dwarfs with measured and published distances , but only five t dwarfs published to date . in this paper",
    ", we discuss two applications of the parallax data to our understanding of l dwarfs .",
    "in figure 1 , the absolute magnitude @xmath2 is plotted .",
    "( @xmath2 is used because it scales more closely with luminosity than @xmath5 or @xmath6 do . )",
    "the five known binary pairs of l dwarfs are labelled in the middle panel ",
    "they are plotted after correcting their magnitudes from the combined light to the individual components .",
    "the figure shows that both spectral type and @xmath1 color can be used to predict @xmath2 for m7 through l8 spectral types .",
    "the scatter in the @xmath3 color of l dwarfs makes that color less accurate for use in predicting @xmath2 .",
    "we need more data before drawing conclusions about t dwarfs .",
    "the @xmath7 colors of l dwarfs are known to have a poor correlation with spectral type ( e.g. leggett et al . 2002 ) and with absolute magnitude and temperature ( kirkpatrick et al . 2000 ; dahn et al .",
    "the right - hand panel of figure  1 reinforces that conclusion .",
    "the @xmath7 colors are believed to be controlled by the amount of dust in the atmospheres of these cool objects : the distribution of dust particle sizes , the vertical distribution of dust clouds , and perhaps the existance of holes or bands between dust clouds are likely to be relevant factors ( e.g. ackerman & marley 2001 ; burrows et al . 2002 ; tsuji 2002 ) .    in an effort to understand what factor(s ) cause dust to vary between otherwise - similar objects , in figure 2 we repeat the right - hand panel of figure 1 to show four potential correlations .",
    "figure 2 uses data from the literature ( basri et al .",
    "2000 ; basri 2001 ; kirkpatrick et al . 1999 ; 2000 ; 2001 ; martn et al .",
    "1999 ; reid et al . 2002",
    "; tinney & reid 1998 ) for lithium detection , h@xmath4 emission , tangential velocity , and rotation velocity .",
    "some trends are already known : lithium is detected more frequently at fainter absolute magnitudes , while h@xmath4 equivalent widths drop and rotation velocities increase .",
    "however , based on the available data , there is no obvious tendency for the @xmath3 color to correlate with any of these parameters at a given absolute magnitude .",
    "perhaps several factors influence the dust content of the atmospheres of l dwarfs and mask any one - parameter correlation .",
    "we need data ( parallax and other ) for more l dwarfs .",
    "we really need data for more t dwarfs .",
    "parallaxes for more t dwarfs will be coming from tinney ( this volume ) and from parallaxes with the usno ir camera ( vrba et al . in preparation ) .",
