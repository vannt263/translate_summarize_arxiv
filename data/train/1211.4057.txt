    "a permanent electric dipole moment of the electron or of any other fundamental particle , or of an atom in an eigenstate of angular momentum , is possible only if the symmetries of both parity  ( @xmath5 ) and time reversal  ( @xmath6 ) are violated @xcite . by the @xmath7  theorem @xcite ,",
    "@xmath6 violation is the equivalent of @xmath8  violation , where  @xmath9 is charge conjugation .",
    "@xmath8  violation has been observed , but only in the quark sector and only in the decay of the neutral  @xmath10 and  @xmath11 mesons .",
    "the cabbibo - kobayashi - maskawa  ( ckm ) mass mixing matrix in the standard model is consistent with these observations , but does not produce a large enough @xmath8 violating effect to account for the excess of matter over anti - matter in the universe  @xcite .",
    "extensions of the standard model generically contain new massive particles and new sources of @xmath8  violation that give rise to an electric dipole moment ( edm ) for the electron . in field theories ,",
    "the interaction of an electron with the electromagnetic field is described by the field - theoretical interaction hamiltonian @xmath12 , where the interaction hamiltonian density @xmath13 is ( in international mksa ( si ) units ) @xmath14 here @xmath15 is a dirac matrix , @xmath16 is the electron charge , @xmath17 is the speed of light , and we assume that the fermion field operator @xmath18 is normalized so that @xmath19 has physical dimension of inverse volume .",
    "the second form in eq .   includes radiative corrections , where the vertex function is denoted as @xmath20 .",
    "for an electron on the mass shell , the vertex function in an arbitrary field theory can be expressed in terms of lorentz and @xmath7 invariant terms as @xmath21 where @xmath22/2 $ ] , and @xmath23 is the contribution of the anapole moment  @xcite .",
    "( the form factors are the @xmath24 dirac , the @xmath25 pauli , and the @xmath26 anapole form factor ; the @xmath8-odd @xmath27 term which leads to the edm does not carry a special name . )",

    "the weak interaction gives rise to the last , anapole term , which conserves  @xmath6 and  @xmath8 , but violates both  @xmath5 and  @xmath9 separately ; it is not considered in the following .",

    ", the electron edm gives rise to the following effective hamiltonian for the interaction of the spin of a free electron with an electric field , @xmath28 in the effective hamiltonian for a bound electron , one has to replace @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the total angular momentum of the atom ( including the nuclear spin ) and @xmath31 is the enhancement factor [ see eq .",
    "we recall that @xmath32 is the elementary charge unit . the pauli spin matrices @xmath33 are dimensionless .",
    "the electric field @xmath34 is multiplied by the elementary charge and the electron compton wavelength @xmath35 to yield an interaction energy . in the absence of a special structure that would otherwise constrain the form factor  @xmath27 to be",
    "small , field theories which extend the standard model generally contain a significant edm .",
    "the special structure in the standard model is that @xmath8  violation occurs only in a single phase in the quark mass mixing matrix .",
    "the leading standard model contribution to a lepton edm is at the level of four loops  @xcite . because the resulting electron  edm is far too small to be observed by any proposed experiment , there are in practice no standard model effects to account for , so mere observation of an electron  edm is direct evidence of a new and non - standard - model source of @xmath8  violation  @xcite .",
    "the sensitivity of edm measurements to new phenomena is far - reaching .",
    "in some recent calculations , an electron  edm arises through a mechanism that produces the neutrino mass  @xcite or is sensitive to physics at energy scales that exceed @xmath36  @xcite , or is sensitive to dark matter  @xcite , or that is responsible for baryogenesis  @xcite .",
    "the present limit on the electron  edm already presses supersymmetry ( susy ) , especially when that limit is combined with those on the neutron  edm and those on the  edms of diamagnetic atoms .",
    "present limits on the electron edm  @xcite are lower by a factor of  @xmath37 than edms predicted by some susy  models  @xcite with super - partner masses of @xmath38 and @xmath8 violating phases of order unity . therefore , these susy models could be excluded .",
    "the present edm limits are also not in complete agreement with models with one - tev super - partner masses  @xcite .    in this paper , we examine in detail a proposal to significantly lower experimental limits on the electron  edm , by roughly two orders of magnitude in comparison to present limits  @xcite .",
    "a nonvanishing edm on this level would imply the existence of new physics beyond the standard model , or , alternatively , imply that currently favored extensions of the standard model need to be significantly altered . within  susy",
    ", an unexpectedly small edm could be realized if one assumes that @xmath8 violating phases are much smaller than currently assumed , or that the masses of superpartners are much larger than currently expected .",
    "quite sophisticated models have been proposed with this notion in mind : e.g. , in so - called split supersymmetry  @xcite , one assumes that only the masses of those superpartners that contribute to edms most significantly , are larger than expected , whereas the masses of other susy partners remain in the expected range .",
    "however , in general , susy offers no special reason for small @xmath8  violating phases or any good reason for most of the superpartner masses to remain small  @xcite .",
    "if more accurate experimental results still turn out to be compatible with a zero edm , one will begin to exhaust some of the simpler remedies and push the theory towards constructions inconsistent with the original motivations for  susy .",
    "our proposed measurement scheme is based on the observation that the interaction hamiltonian   is proportional to @xmath39 [ or @xmath40 for a bound electron , see eq .",
    "the influence of an edm of the electron is largest when an atom is put in an intense , static electric field to evolve a long time , and an atomic fountain apparatus ( the details of which will be explained below ) is an essentially undisturbed environment in which this can be done .",
    "the inclusion of an atomic fountain in edm experiments has not been discussed in the literature to the best of our knowledge . however",
    ", it is a subtle matter to select an actual observable that is sensitive to an edm , takes advantage of the properties of an atomic fountain , cancels many systematic effects , and can be realized using lasers alone .",
    "our proposed scheme consists of four steps .    *",
    "[ step 1 . ] * we start with heavy alkali atoms of half - integer nuclear spin and prepare an initial state that is a coherent superposition of states within the upper hyperfine manifold of the electronic @xmath41 ground state .    * [ step 2 . ] * in the fountain , the state of the atom evolves from the initial one under the influence of a strong electric field but only weak static magnetic fields .",
    "the full hamiltonian generating the dynamics is given below in eq .  .",
    "the quantum dynamics of the atom are the main concern of the current theoretical investigation . because of the analytic simple structure of the hamiltonian given in eq .  , which involves a tensor stark term and an edm term , the dynamics can be described semi - analytically using time - ordered perturbation theory .    *",
    "[ step 3 . ] * the analysis of the time - evolved state proceeds in a region where the atom is irradiated by laser light tuned to the @xmath42 transition ( with @xmath43 or @xmath44 and @xmath45 ) , roughly as follows ( further details are discussed in the main body of the article ) : after many cycles of absorption and spontaneous emission , any sublevel @xmath46 either ends in the dark state of the upper hyperfine level ( @xmath47 ) with probability  @xmath48 or ends in the lower hyperfine level ( @xmath49 ) with probability  @xmath50 .",
    "if an atom ends in the dark state , the atom `` survives '' in the upper hyperfine level .",
    "the probability that the actual time - evolved state survives is given as the sum over the `` survival probabilities '' of its separate components .",
    "this probability depends on the electron edm and defines the observable @xmath51 [ see eq .",
    "below ] , where @xmath52 is the rotation angle ( about the @xmath53 axis in fig .",
    "[ figg1 ] below ) of the propagation direction of the linearly polarized analysis laser with regard to the coordinate system of the atomic fountain apparatus ( see fig .",
    "[ figg1 ] below for the @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath53 axes ) .",
    "we here assume that the atomic state is initially prepared with respect to a quantization axis adjusted to be essentially parallel to the direction of the applied electric field ( which is the @xmath53 axis in fig .",
    "[ figg1 ] below ) .    * [ step 4 . ] * as a separate step , the survival probability signal @xmath51 is measured by fluorescing the @xmath56 to @xmath57 cycling transition , then pumping all atoms from the lower @xmath58 hyperfine level also into the @xmath56 level and fluorescing the cycling transition again .",
    "the ratio of the number of photons scattered over a fixed time while the cycling transition was fluoresced then equals the desired probability . throughout this paper",
    ", we use the phrase  optical pumping `` when the purpose of hitting atoms with a laser is to alter the atomic state , and ' ' fluorescing \" when the purpose is to scatter photons from the laser that are to be counted .",
    "we propose to do all of this in a double - differential setup , where the interrogation laser in step  @xmath59 is tilted by angles  @xmath52 and  @xmath60 , and the difference of the two survival probabilities @xmath61 is taken [ see also eq .",
    "that difference is measured for opposite signs of the applied electric field and the difference is taken again .",
    "this leads to the observable @xmath62 ( the superscript standing for `` odd '' ) that appears in eq .",
    "this double - differential setup is key to our proposal and eliminates many systematic effects .",
    "a schematic diagram for the resulting experiment to measure the electron electric dipole moment using an atomic fountain is laid out in fig .",
    "[ figg1 ] .",
    "atoms are collected and cooled in a magneto - optical trap , a fully coherent initial state is prepared ( so that the use of a density matrix becomes unnecessary ) , and the atoms are launched vertically .",
    "the atoms enter a region shielded against static magnetic fields . within the atomic fountain , the atoms then rise into and fall out of a large electric field .",
    "if an electron edm exists , the initial quantum state ( step  @xmath63 ) rotates by a small angle about the electric field axis , while in the electric field ( step  @xmath64 ) .",
    "while still in the magnetically shielded region , but outside the electric field , the atoms are analyzed by optical pumping ( state analysis , step  @xmath59 ) , which has the effect of encoding the small angle of rotation into a relative shift in the population of the upper and lower hyperfine levels of the ground state .",
    "those populations do nt change if stray magnetic fields are subsequently applied , so atoms can be allowed to fall out of the magnetic shield before the populations are measured by optical pumping and counting of the scattered photons ( fluorescence , step  @xmath2 ) .",

    "the width of the parabolic trajectory has been greatly exaggerated . in first approximation",
    ", we assume that atoms rise and fall strictly along the @xmath55  axis , and that the applied electric field is strictly parallel to the @xmath53  axis .",
    "atoms are exposed to lasers at the points on the trajectory marked by solid circles . ]",
    "the system of optical pumping for state preparation uses the property that an atom illuminated with a laser tuned to an allowed transition with @xmath65 has a unique , known `` dark '' state from which excitation by the laser is forbidden .",
    "the dark state is a continuous function of the ellipticity of the laser polarization ; for a linearly polarized laser with its axis of polarization parallel to the  @xmath53  axis , the dark states is @xmath66 , and for a laser propagating in the @xmath53  direction that is circularly polarized with positive helicity , the dark state is @xmath67 . for conceptual simplicity , we mainly study initial states which are the coherent superpositions @xmath68 .",
    "the system of optical pumping for state analysis ( step  @xmath59 ) is similar to that of state preparation ( step  @xmath63 ) .",
    "an atom in any state of the upper , @xmath47 hyperfine level that is illuminated with a laser tuned to an allowed transition with @xmath69 will either end in the dark state of the laser or in some state of the lower hyperfine level . in the simple cases of a laser that is polarized parallel to the  @xmath53  axis , or that propagates parallel to  @xmath53 and",

    "the dark state is @xmath74 , because @xmath75(@xmath76 ) transitions are only allowed if the total angular momentum changes .",
    "the probabilities  @xmath70 depend on the branching ratios for the various spontaneous transitions and can be found as simple fractions by solving the @xmath77 equations for the evolution of the states of a given hyperfine level ; the essential physics for the probabilities is illustrated for one particular transition in fig .",

    "such effects arise naturally in edm experiments because in the rest frame of the atom , due to the atom s nonzero velocity in the applied electric field , the atom sees ( si units ) a magnetic field @xmath107 which changes sign when @xmath34 changes sign .",

    "let us briefly comment on the effect of a possible slight nonuniformity of the electric field , in which case the atomic trajectory may become more complicated because atoms in the level @xmath112 are attracted into regions of strong electric field by the stark shift .",

    "the combination of a significant motional magnetic field and a stray magnetic field , acting while the tensor stark splittings are still small , generates among other effects an additional rotation about the @xmath53 axis that can mimic the rotation effected by an electron edm .",

    "the systematics start intrinsically smaller than in previous experiments because of the smaller velocity of atoms in an atomic fountain , which reduces the magnitude of the motional magnetic field , and because in an atomic fountain with a large electric field a magnetic field is not required to define a quantization axis , so stray components of the magnetic field can be suppressed to the limit provided by the surrounding magnetic shielding .",

    "<S> an improved measurement of the electron electric dipole moment ( edm ) appears feasible using ground - state alkali atoms in an atomic fountain in which a strong electric field , which couples to a conceivable electron dipole moment ( edm ) , is applied perpendicular to the fountain axis . in a practical fountain , </S>",
    "<S> the ratio of the atomic tensor stark shift to the zeeman shift is a factor  @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we expand the complete time evolution operator in inverse powers of this ratio ; complete results are presented for atoms of total spin  @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and  @xmath3 . for a specific set of entangled hyperfine sublevels ( coherent states ) , potential systematic errors enter only as even powers of @xmath4 , making the expansion rapidly convergent . </S>",
    "<S> the remaining edm mimicking effects are further suppressed in a proposed double - differential setup , where the final state is interrogated in a differential laser configuration , and the direction of the strong electric field also is inverted . </S>",
    "<S> estimates of the signal available at existing accelerator facilities indicate that the proposed apparatus offers the potential for a drastic improvement in edm limits over existing measurements , and for constraining the parameter space of supersymmetric ( susy ) extensions of the standard model . + </S>",
