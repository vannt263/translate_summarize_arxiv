    "marked point processes ( mpps ) are versatile models for the statistical analysis of data recorded at irregularly scattered locations .",
    "the simplest marking scenario is independent marking , where marks are given by a sequence of independent and identically distributed random elements , which is also independent of the underlying point pattern of locations .",
    "a more complex class of models considers a so - called geostatistical marking , where the marks are determined by the values of a random field at the given locations .",
    "although the random field usually exhibits intrinsic spatial correlations , it is assumed to be independent of the location point process ( pp ) .",
    "however , in many real datasets interactions between locations and marks occur .",
    "moreover , many marked point patterns arising in models from stochastic geometry such as edge centers in ( anisotropic ) voronoi - tessellations marked by orientation or pps marked by nearest - neighbour distances do not fit the setting of geostatistical marking .",
    "for recent asymptotic approaches to mark correlation analysis based on mark variogram and mark covariance functions , we refer to @xcite .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to investigate estimators of the palm mark distribution @xmath2 in point patterns exhibiting correlations between different marks as well as between marks and locations .",
    "the probability measure @xmath2 can be interpreted as the distribution of the typical mark which denotes the mark of a randomly chosen point of the pattern . for any mark set @xmath3 , we consider the scaled deviations @xmath4 as measure of the distance between @xmath2 and an empirical palm mark distribution @xmath5 . in @xcite , we prove asymptotic normality of the scaled deviation vector @xmath6 under appropriate strong mixing conditions when the observation window @xmath7 with volume @xmath8 grows unboundedly in all directions as @xmath9 . in this study , we in particular discuss consistent estimators for the covariance matrix of the gaussian limit of @xmath10 .",
    "this enables us to construct asymptotic @xmath0-goodness - of - fit tests for the palm mark distribution @xmath2 . in a simulation study",
    "we apply our testing methodology to the directional analysis of random surfaces . for this purpose ,",
    "we consider cox processes on the boundary of boolean models , mark them with the local outer normal direction and test for a hypothetical directional distribution .",
    "this allows to identify the rose of directions of the surface process associated with the boolean model and represents an alternative to a monte carlo test for the rose of direction suggested in @xcite .",
    "the occurring mpps differ fundamentally from the setting of independent and geostatistical marking , for which functional central limit theorems ( clts ) and corresponding tests have been derived in @xcite . in general , they also do not represent @xmath11-dependent mpps .    our paper is organized as follows .",

    "the relatively high errors of second type for the small elongation factor of @xmath501 are to be expected , since the investigated structures are only slightly anisotropic .",
