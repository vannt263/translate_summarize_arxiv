    "we show how to make the six heavy neutral fermions decouple at the ew scale by invoking a modified casas - ibarra parametrization method  @xcite , leaving the three light fermions as the active neutrinos .",
    "furthermore , we discuss how the model can explain the discrepancy of the muon anomalous magnetic moment from the sm prediction and contribute to the relic density of dark matter ( dm ) .",
    "we present a comprehensive analysis to find the parameter space that can satisfy constraints such as charged lepton flavor - violating decays , electric dipole moments , direct detection searches of dm , @xmath5 decays , and neutrino oscillation data .",
