    "models with extra dimensions @xcite provide one of the most promising solutions to the hierarchy problem , namely , the huge difference between the scale of gravity @xmath12 gev and the electroweak ( ew ) scale @xmath13 gev . in these models",
    "@xmath14 appears as an effective scale related with the fundamental one , @xmath15 110 tev , by the volume of the compact space or by an exponential warp factor .",
    "the difference between @xmath16 and @xmath17 would then just define a _ little _ hierarchy problem that should be easier to solve consistenly with all collider data .",
    "the phenomenological consequencies of this framework are quite _ intriguing _ : the fundamental scale would be at accessible energies , and processes with @xmath18 would probe a _",
    "regime where gravity is expected to dominate over the other interactions @xcite .",
    "the spin two of the graviton implies then gravitational cross sections that grow fast with @xmath19 and become long distance interactions . as a consequence , quantum gravity or other short distance effects become irrelevant as they are screened by black hole ( bh ) horizons @xcite .",
    "one of the scenarios in which tev gravity effects could play a significant role is provided by cosmic rays physics .",
    "the earth is constantly hit by a flux of protons with energy of up to @xmath2 gev and , associated to that flux , it is also expected a flux of cosmogenic neutrinos ( still unobserved ) with a typical energy peaked around @xmath20 gev @xcite .",
    "these are energies much larger than the ones to be explored at the lhc , where there would be no evidence for gravitational interactions if the scale @xmath17 is above a few tev .",
    "in addition , notice that the new physics should be more relevant in collisions of particles with a small sm cross section , as it is expected for the interaction of a proton with a dark matter particle @xmath21 if it is taken to be a weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) .",
    "we will discuss here the interaction of ultra high energy cosmic rays ( uhecr ) with dark matter particles @xmath21 in our galactic halo .",
    "no detail about the nature of @xmath21 other than its mass , which defines the center - of - mass energy @xmath22 in the collision , is going to be significant to the present analysis .",
    "we also consider collisions of uhecr with other cosmic rays .",
    "these are arguably the most energetic elementary processes that we know that occur in nature at the present time , and would produce mini bhs significantly colder and longer - lived than the ones usually considered in the literature .",
    "we will focus just on bh production and evaporation , being this analysis a necessary first step in order to understand the full effects of tev gravity on uhecr phenomenology .",
    "bh production processes are the most widely and detailfully discussed aspect of tev - gravity phenomenology @xcite , and they have been considered both in the lhc @xcite and in the uhecr context @xcite . here",
    "we will assume a scenario with @xmath23 flat extra dimensions of common lenght where gravity is free to propagate , while matter fields are trapped on a ( non - compact ) four - dimensional brane .",
    "we will use the basic estimate that the collision of two pointlike particles at impact parameters smaller than the schwarzschild radius @xmath24 of the system leads to the production of a bh whose mass is given by @xmath25 .",
    "the bhs that we are considering ( @xmath26 gev ) will be described by a ( @xmath27)-dimensional metric ( they are smaller than the volume of the compact space ) , being their radius @xmath28 for two pointlike particles , the cross section @xmath29 to produce a bh is then written as @xmath30 if the collision involves non - elementary ( at the scale @xmath31 ) protons , then its partonic structure has to be included in order to find the total cross section , as it is usually done for analyses of bh production at lhc @xcite .",
    "the p@xmath21 ( or p@xmath32 ) cross section may therefore be written as @xmath33 this formula expresses the cross section as the sum of partial contributions @xmath34 to produce a bh of mass @xmath35 resulting from the collision of a parton @xmath36 that carries a fraction @xmath37 of momentum with a pointlike target .",
    "it is crucial to notice that the scale @xmath38 in the collision is fixed by the inverse scwarzschild radius , rather than by the bh mass @xcite @xcite , since the scattering is probing a lenght scale that grows ( not decreases ! ) with @xmath39 .",
    "actually , we expect that for large enough @xmath39 the scale that we are exploring goes above its radius and a pointlike behaviour for the proton will emerge .",
    "in contrast with a qed scattering , here at lower energies ( @xmath40 gev ) we can _ see _ the composite structure of the proton , while at higher energies ( @xmath41 gev ) the proton will scatter coherently as a whole . since eq .",
    "[ sigmapnu ] does not reproduce this behaviour , it is necessary to include matching corrections between the two energy regions .",
    "the cross section in eq .",
    "[ sigmapnu ] describes the low - energy regime , and it is dominated by the large number of partons of low @xmath37 that may produce a bh of mass near the threshold @xmath17 .",
    "this scheme explains why @xmath42 . when the cross section @xmath43 approaches the proton size ( @xmath44 mbarn ) , then the density of partons with enough energy to produce a bh is so large that the parton cross sections overlap , and the bhs produced are big enough to trap other _ spectator _ partons .",
    "this overlapping reduces the total cross section and increases the average mass of the produced bh . in this regime",
    "@xmath45 is basically constant with @xmath39 until it matches the pointlike behaviour in @xmath46 .",
    "a similar behavior is also expected in @xmath47@xmath47 collisions , where the partonic enhancement of the cross section is even more important at lower energies ( in this regime @xmath48 ) and the intermadiate regime of constant total cross section is reached at lower energies . the smooth transition from these regimes",
    "can be modelled numerically discounting the contributions from spectator partons , and are summarized in fig .",
    "there we plot the bh production cross section for different kind of particles .     and @xmath49 tev .",
    "[ fig1 ] ]    we will analyze two processes that can lead to bh production ( see @xcite for the fluxes of proton , cosmogenic neutrinos and for the dark matter density ) .    _ ( i ) _ a cosmic ray of energy @xmath50 colliding with a dark matter particle @xmath21 at rest in the frame of reference of our galaxy .",
    "the average number of bhs produced per unit time and volume depends on the density @xmath51 , the cross section @xmath52 and the differential flux of cosmic rays @xmath53 ( with @xmath54 ) : @xmath55 here the center of mass energy @xmath56 can run from @xmath17 to @xmath57 gev .",
    "_ ( ii ) _ a cosmic ray of energy @xmath58 colliding with a cosmic ray of energy @xmath59 .",
    "in this case the center of mass energy depends upon the relative angle @xmath60 , and results into @xmath61 .",
    "the interaction rate per unit time and volume is expressed by : @xmath62 these processes generate bh masses @xmath25 that can reach @xmath63 gev .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we plot the production rate of bhs from both types of collisions .    , @xmath49 tev , @xmath64 gev .",
    "to understand what kind of signal one could observe from such an event , it is necessary to estimate how the bh evolves after its production .",
    "it is expected that initially the bh undergoes a quick _ balding _ phase , in which it loses its gauge hair and asymmetries .",
    "then it experiences a _ spin down _ phase , where its angular momentum is radiated while losing just a small fraction of its mass @xcite .",
    "finally , during most of its life the bh is in a schwarzschild phase , losing mass through spherically symmetric hawking radiation @xcite .",
    "the spectrum is , in a first approximation , that of a black body of temperature @xcite @xmath65 this means that the scale of emission is fixed by the inverse schwarzshild radius .",
    "this formula has important corrections arising from the gravitational barrier that the particles have to cross once emitted .",
    "these corrections are usually expressed in terms of the so called _ greybody factors _ , effective emission areas @xmath66 that depend on the dimensionality @xmath67 of the space - time , the spin of the particle emitted , and its energy @xmath68 @xcite .",
    "these factors give corrections of order 1 to the black - body emission rates for all particles species except for the graviton , which can have a stronger correction depending upon the number of extra dimensions .",
    "we will assume here the numerical greybody factors given in @xcite .",
    "the number of particles of the species @xmath36 emitted with ( @xmath27)-dimensional momenta between @xmath69 and @xmath70 in a time interval @xmath71 can be written as @xmath72 while the radiated energy is given by @xmath73 some remarks are here in order .    _",
    "( i ) _ on dimensional grounds @xmath74 and @xmath75 , so each degree of freedom should contribute equally ( up to order one geometric and greybody factors ) to the total emission independently from its bulk or brane localization @xcite .",
    "_ ( ii ) _ we are considering bh temperatures above @xmath76 ( @xmath77 gev leads to @xmath78 gev ) , so qcd degrees of freedom ( quarks and gluons ) are also radiated and dominate the total emission .",
    "once the instant spectrum is known , we integrate it over time to get the bh lifetime . on dimensional grounds @xmath79 , although the dependence upon the number of the radiated degrees of freedom at different temperatures may be significant . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we plot the correlation between lifetime , mass and initial temperatures for bhs of mass ranging from @xmath80 tev to @xmath2 gev , @xmath81 and @xmath49 tev ; it is there shown that lifetimes go from a maximum of @xmath82 s for the most heavy bhs to a minimum around @xmath83 s for lhc - like bhs .",
    "tev and @xmath81 .",
    "an important issue about the evolution of the radiation from a bh is the debated question relative to its thermalization .",
    "it has been argued @xcite that the emitted particles should produce a thick shell of almost - thermal plasma of qed ( qcd ) particles usually called photosphere ( chromosphere ) . this would occur for bhs above a critical temperature @xmath84 ( @xmath85 ) , and would change the average energy of the emitted particles from @xmath86 to @xmath87 ( or @xmath88 ) .",
    "the argument leading to these shells is based on the average number @xmath89 of interactions of the particles exiting the bh , so @xmath90 should suffice to confirm the presence of the plasma shell .",
    "initial estimates @xcite used the expression @xmath91 which describes the case of particles scattering against a fixed target .",
    "recently , however , it has been noticed that the kinematic differences between that case and the case of particles exiting radially from a bh are so significant that lead to a complete suppression of the interaction rate @xcite .",
    "we will show , following the approach of carr , mcgibbon and page , that their arguments ( formulated for ordinary bhs ) hold also for bhs in tev gravity models .",
    "the first kinematic effect is due to _ causality _ , and depends on the fact that the scattered particles do not come from infinity ( as in a regular collision ) , they are created in definite points of space - time .",
    "this introduces a _ minimal _ separation between particles successively emitted , both in time and lenght , and induces via heisenberg s indetermination principle an uv cutoff in the scale of the exchanged momenta .",
    "the scattering cross section is reduced because not all the energies can be interchanged . in particular , in qed ( qcd ) bremsstrahlung and pair production the momenta dominating the collision are of order @xmath92 ( or right above @xmath93 ) .",
    "if the particle wave functions do not overlap , and their minimum distance @xmath94 ( in units of their compton wavelength ) is larger than the dominant inverse momenta , then the process will be suppressed .",
    "checking the parameter @xmath32 is sufficient to decide about the effective connection between emitted particles , and eventually exclude thermal interactions . in @xcite",
    "we have shown that this argument excludes the presence of a photosphere for any number of extra dimensions , but not of a chromosphere when @xmath95 .",
    "the second suppression effect is based on the fact that the interaction between two particles is not instantaneous , it takes a finite time to complete .",
    "it is easy to see that when this occurs the particles are already far away from each other , so that they can not interact again . in particular , after completing a qcd interaction partons will be at distances larger than @xmath96 , where qcd is already ineffective . to fully understand this point ,",
    "one first has to notice that the interaction between particles moving radially in the same direction ( within the _ exclusion cone _ ) is negligible , as the density in such a region is low .",
    "also , that particles moving radially keep on moving radially , as the average angular deviation due to bremsstrahlung - like processes is small .",
    "this implies that the distance of a particle to the particles out of the exclusion cone will always increase ( they _ never _ approach to each other ) , and when it reaches a radius @xmath97 this distance will be bigger than @xmath98 ( or @xmath99 ) and the particle is no longer able to interact",
    ". if the bh temperature is above @xmath100 , as it is the case for the bhs under study here , it is easy to see that after the particle has completed one interaction it will have already crossed @xmath97 .",
    "once the greybody spectrum of emission has been established , it is necessary to study how it evolves at astrophysical distances : unstable particles will decay , and colored particles ( which dominate the spectrum ) will fragment into hadrons and then shower into stable species .",
    "we present our results following the approach of @xcite , who first studied this issue for primordial bhs .",
    "the main difference with their analysis is that while the authors in @xcite compute the stationary spectrum at a given @xmath101 ( which only changes on astrophysical time scales ) , we need here to evaluate the spectrum integrated over the whole ( very short ) bh lifetime . in any case",
    ", our results will be analogous , since the temperature of a bh variates little for most of its lifetime .",
    "of course , our framework also deals with a different scale of gravity @xmath102 and extra dimensions where gravitons propagate .",
    "this implies emission into the bulk and different greybody factors for all the species .",
    "notice finally that the spectrum that we are discussing is in the bh rest frame , it is _ not _ the one to be observed at the earth as the bhs produced in cosmic ray collisions will be highly boosted .",
    "we will assume that the evolution of the species @xmath36 emitted by a bh at rest coincides with the one in @xmath103 in the center of mass frame , so we will use the montecarlo jet code herwig6 @xcite to evolve the greybody spectrum described before .",
    "namely , we compute the convolution @xmath104 to obtain the number @xmath105 of stable particles of species @xmath106 with energy between @xmath68 and @xmath107 emitted in a time @xmath108 .",
    "the first term in parenthesis stands for the greybody spectrum of emission for particle species @xmath36 , while the second encodes the probability for the species @xmath36 of energy @xmath109 to give a @xmath106 of energy @xmath68 . for a given @xmath101 ,",
    "this has been implemented via montecarlo including all particles of mass @xmath110 ( leptons , quarks and gauge bosons , neglecting the higgs or the dark matter particle ) and has resulted in a final spectrum of neutrinos , electrons , photons and protons .",
    "the spectrum includes the same number of particles and antiparticles ( they are generated at the same rate ) , and the three families of neutrinos ( their flavor oscillates at astrophysical lenght scales ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we plot the spectrum at fixed temperature @xmath111 gev , whereas in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] we give the complete spectrum for initial masses of @xmath112 gev and @xmath20 and @xmath8 .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "the head to head collision of two cosmic rays provides center - of - mass energies of up to @xmath2 gev . in models with extra dimensions and a fundamental scale of gravity at the tev",
    "such collision should result in the formation of a mini bh .",
    "its evaporation and showering into stable particles could provide an observable signal .",
    "we have estimated the production rate of these bhs ( fig .  [ fig2 ] ) via collisions of two cosmic rays or , more frequently , in the collision of a cosmic ray and a dark matter particle .",
    "in particular , it seems worth to analyze the possibility that _",
    "( i ) _ extragalactic cosmic rays crossing the galactic dm halo produce a flux of secondary particles with a characteristic shape and strongly dependent upon galactic latitude ; _ ( ii ) _ a fraction of the flux of cosmic rays with energy up to @xmath113 gev trapped in our galaxy by @xmath114 magnetic fields can be processed by tev interactions into a secondary flux peaked at smaller energies .",
    "notice that the physics proposed in this talk is expected to become relevant just at center of mass energies above @xmath115 tev , i.e. , at cosmic ray energies around the cosmic ray _",
    "knee_. these considerations will be worked out in @xcite , where the additional effects of gravitational elastic interactions will also be included .",
    "here we have discussed the properties of bhs with masses between @xmath1 and @xmath2 gev .",
    "such objects have a proper lifetime between @xmath82 and @xmath83 s ( fig .  [ fig3 ] ) , and their desintegration products are mainly determined by the fragmentation of qcd species produced via hawking radiation .",
    "interactions among emitted particles are not able to produce a thermal shell of radiation , so the spectrum of fundamental species exit the bh with basically the black body spectrum described by hawking . the final spectrum of stable particles at large distances , however , is peaked around @xmath76 , and exhibits features weakly dependent upon number of extra dimensions or the bhs mass .",
    "standard model modes are constituted by an approximate @xmath3 of neutrinos , a @xmath4 of electrons , a @xmath5 of photons and a @xmath6 of protons .",
    "the gravitons produced are a fraction that goes from the @xmath116 of the total number of particles ( @xmath5 of the energy ) for @xmath117 gev and @xmath118 to the @xmath119 ( @xmath7 of the energy ) for @xmath120 tev and @xmath8 .",
