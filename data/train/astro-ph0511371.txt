    "[ clusters ]    we consider clusters of identical touching spherical particles arranged in three different geometries : fractal , cubic , and linear . for a high precision of the calculations ,",
    "we restrict the number of particles per cluster to less than 10 .    we have selected three main geometries , namely a `` snowflake 1st  order prefractal '' cluster ( fractal dimension",
    "@xmath1 , @xcite ) , where one sphere is surrounded by six others along the positive and negative cartesian axes , a cluster of eight spheres arranged as a cube and a linear chain of five spheres .",
    "all of the clusters ( fig.[clusters ] ) consist of homogeneous spheres with radii @xmath2  nm and embedded in vacuum ( or air ) .",
    "-sic cluster produced in the laboratory by laser - induced pyrolysis @xcite .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",width=264 ] [ clement ]    an sic cluster consisting of nano - particles produced in the laboratory by laser - induced pyrolysis @xcite , which has served as inspiration for this paper , is shown in fig.[clement ] .",
    "[ nk ]    in order to study the convergence of the different codes , we chose three different materials of which our clusters are composed : crystalline @xmath3-sic , crystalline feo and amorphous sio@xmath0 . these solids differ significantly from each other in their infrared properties . first , while @xmath3-sic and feo have only one mid - infrared resonance , amorphous sio@xmath0 has three of them .",
    "second  and more importantly  the minima and peak values of these materials optical constants are very different from each other , see fig.[nk ] .",
    "roughly speaking , the maximum @xmath4 and @xmath5 values of feo , by reaching 56 close to 30@xmath6 m , amount to only 50% of those of @xmath3-sic in its resonance at 12.6@xmath6 m , and the same holds true for sio@xmath0 as compared to feo . due to its sharp resonance , @xmath3-sic not only reaches a very high maximum , but also a very deep minimum of @xmath4 , which makes the calculation of its absorption and scattering behaviour especially difficult ( see also sect.[sect_cos ] and [ sect_dda ] ) .",
    "more details on the maxima of @xmath4 and @xmath5 as well as the minima of @xmath4 for sic , feo and sio@xmath0 can be found in tab .",
    "[ t : nk - max ] .",
    ".maxima of the optical constants @xmath4 and @xmath5 of sic , feo and sio@xmath0 . amorphous sio@xmath0 has three resonances in the mid - ir range which have been labeled r1  r3 .",
    "[ t : nk - max ] [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the 20@xmath6 m phonon band of amorphous sio@xmath0 ( not shown in our figures ) actually converges even faster than the the 9@xmath6 m band . here , convergence seems to be achieved for l@xmath731 .",
    "this is probably due to the fact that re(m ) does not reach as low values as for the 9@xmath6 m band .",
    "this dependence of the convergence on re(m ) is also observed with the dda approach and will further be discussed in the next section .",
    "[ sect_dda ]    as well as the cluster - of - spheres methods , the dda method also encounters difficulties with reaching convergence for the clusters we have chosen to study , see figs.[lin5_sic_ddscat ]  [ frac7sc8_sic_ddscat ] . for the _ lin5 _ cluster composed of sic it is clear from fig.[lin5_sic_ddscat ] that we are most likely not even close to obtaining a converged result , although we have used rather large numbers of dipoles ( see tab.[dipoles ] ) for the calculations",
    "this is especially true at wavelengths longward of the primary resonance at 10.6  @xmath6 m . some of the spectra obtained",
    "show secondary resonances similar to the scsmtm results whereas others are relatively flat .",
    "similarly , for the feo _ lin5 _",
    "cluster the results seem to be converged towards the short - wavelength part of the spectrum shown in fig.[feo_lin5_ddscat ] , but not towards the longer wavelengths , especially for one particular spectrum ( 4475 dipoles ) which strongly differs from all others including the scsmtm result . for sio@xmath0 ( fig.[sio2_lin5_ddscat ] ) the ddscat calculation is closer to converging due to the lower values of the optical constants for this material as compared to feo and sic ,",
    "see tab.[t : nk - max ] .",
    "however , again the 4475 dipole spectrum shows a secondary resonance which is neither present in the other three nor in the scsmtm result .",
    "similar results concerning the convergence were found for the two other cluster shapes studied _",
    "frac7 _ and _ sc8 _ , fig.[frac7sc8_sic_ddscat ] .",
    "an influence of the refractive index values on the precision of the dda is expected . for materials with large refractive index ( @xmath8 ) @xcite",
    "show that especially the absorption is overestimated by dda . according to @xcite ,",
    "the lattice dispersion relation prescription for the polarisability , @xmath9 , gives fair accuracy for scattering but poorer results for absorption .",
    "when @xmath10 is large , the continuum material is effective at screening the external field : in the limit @xmath11 the internal field generated by the polarization would exactly cancel the incident field , so that the continuum material in the interior of the target would be subjected to zero field . in the case of a discrete dipole array , the dipoles in the interior will also be effectively shielded , while the dipoles located on the target surface are not fully shielded and , as a result , absorb energy from the external field at an excessive rate .",
    "this error can be reduced to any desired level by increasing the number @xmath12 of dipoles , thereby minimizing the fraction @xmath13 of the dipoles which are at surface sites , but very large values of @xmath12 are required when @xmath10 is large @xcite .    at a closer view to the results of the dda calculations , we found that the choice of the dipole grid is significant for the obtained result .",
    "for the linear five particle cluster _",
    ", a grid with a dipole number which is a multiple of five provides a significantly different result than dipole grids which are not a multiple of five .",
    "the former are the ones which generally produce stronger secondary resonances as can be seen from a comparison of the resulting spectra ( shown in fig.[lin5_sic_ddscat ] ) with tab.[dipoles ] ( see also fig.[multiple ] , which will be discussed later ) . for the semi - fractal seven particle cluster _",
    "frac7 _ the difference was between dipole grids which were a multiple of three and for the cubic eight cluster _",
    "sc8 _ it was for dipole grids which were a multiple of two , equivalent to the length scale of the longest chain within the cluster .",
    "the results shown in figs.[lin5_sic_ddscat ]  [ frac7sc8_sic_ddscat ] were calculated using ddscat @xcite but identical results were found using the code by @xcite . according to this solution the absorption cross section averaged over all orientations of an arbitrarily shaped particle obtained using dda can be written as @xmath14,\\ ] ] where @xmath15 , @xmath16 is the material volume of the particle , @xmath12 is the number of dipoles .",
    "the @xmath17 , the so - called form - factors ( not to be confused with the symbol for the multipolar order ) , and @xmath18 , the weights , are obtained from the dda equations . once the @xmath19 and the @xmath18 are found , it is trivial to compute the absorption cross section for any wavelength or complex refractive index , @xmath20 .     cluster .",
    "the results are obtained with the code by @xcite , an identical dependence is found by the ddscat code of @xcite .",
    "the dark gray area show the range of seven spectra obtained when using a dipole grid which is a multiple of five .",
    "the light gray shaded area is the range of 24 spectra obtained when using dipole grid which is nt a multiple of five .",
    "a similar result is found for the _ frac7 _ and _ sc8 _ clusters but here for grids which are multiple of three and two , respectively . , width=340 ]    fig.[multiple ] shows a selection of results for the _ lin5 _",
    "cluster , divided in into grids dividable and non - dividable by 5 .",
    "it is obvious , especially for sic and feo , that the dividable grids produce secondary resonances , which lead to long - wavelength extinction enhancement but with a large spread .",
    "consequently , they are the ones that contribute stronger to the convergence problems than the non - dividable grids .",
    "the method by @xcite allows to examine these effects in even more detail by investigating the origin of the resonances . according to eq.[eq : cabs ] , each form - factor @xmath19 causes a resonance in the complex @xmath20 plane at @xmath21 in the limiting case @xmath22 the @xmath19 and @xmath18 form a continuous distribution , smoothing out all these resonances to a continuum function of @xmath20 .",
    "however , using a limited number of dipoles will result in a limited number of resonances . especially for small values of @xmath23",
    ", this resonance behavior might show up .",
    "the positions of these resonances are sensitive to the exact configuration of the dipoles in the particle .",
    "thus it is very hard to obtain convergence using dda for low values of @xmath23 .",
    "the previous is illustrated in fig.[fig : contours ] where we plot in the contours the dimensionless quantity @xmath24 for the _ lin5 _ aggregate as a function of the real and imaginary part of the refractive index .",
    "we do not give any numerical values for the contour lines because we would like to focus on the general shape of the contours .",
    "in the upper panels it can be seen that there is a large difference between the contours obtained using different numbers of dipoles .",
    "it is clear in all plots that a number of resonances are present along the axis with @xmath25 .",
    "more generally speaking , the contours look very different over the whole complex @xmath20 space . if we zoom in on the region with moderate values of @xmath20 ( the lower panels ) , we see that the differences between the 52 and the 54 wide dipole grids are almost gone in this region of the complex @xmath20 plane .",
    "all the differences between the contours shown in the middle two panels are located at very small values of @xmath23 .",
    "however , the grid of 50 and 55 dipoles width still displays a different shape of the contours .",
    "more generally , for this cluster shape there is a different behaviour when the number of dipoles along the long axis of the system is a multiple of five .",
    "this illustrates the bad convergence behavior of this cluster shape when using dda .",
    "we have studied the performance of two cluster - of - spheres ( @xcite ) and two discrete dipole approximation ( dda ; @xcite ) methods for calculating the extinction of aggregates .",
    "the methods were chosen because they are popular and often used in studies of astrophysical dust extinction and scattering problems .",
    "we present results of the calculated extinction within infrared absorption bands of sic , feo and sio@xmath0 clusters composed of 5 to 8 spherical particles of radii 10 nm .",
    "the clusters had three different shapes : linear chain , semi - fractal and simple cubic .",
    "the materials display a range of material properties and therefore have different strengths of the surface resonances .",
    "when the real part of the refractive index is much smaller than unity , none of the four methods are able to converge .",
    "for the two dda methods there is a strong dependence of the calculated band profiles on the exact dipole distribution within the particles . for the linear five particle cluster _",
    "lin5 _ the result depend on whether the grid is a multiple of five or not , for the semi - fractal seven particle cluster _",
    "frac7 _ and the simple cubic eight particle cluster _",
    "sc8 _ the dependence is on whether the grid is a multiple of three and two , respectively .",
    "currently it does not seem possible to calculate the absorption efficiencies of clusters of spheres for materials with optical constants @xmath26 in a reliable way .",
    "we assume that the critical point is the contact geometry of the particles , which explains the importance of the resolution of the methods used .",
    "this implies that for corresponding experiments it is of great importance to study the contact points between the particles . without a good investigation of the contact",
    "points a comparison between experimental data and model calculations are very likely to be fruitless .",
    "one could hope that things might be easier when particles are less perfect than the spheres we have considered , since that will give rise to fewer resonance effects .",
