    "we live in a universe that is old and very nearly spatially flat .",
    "the possibility that these two properties of our universe ",
    "its age and small spatial curvature  could be related , has been the focus of considerable study in cosmology .",
    "tolman wondered whether a progressively older universe could be constructed out of repeated cycles of expansion and contraction @xcite .",
    "however he was also well aware of the fact that , for perfect fluids , the equations of motion are reversible and so each cyclic epoch is identical to the next . to construct a universe in which successive epochs were of longer duration tolman postulated the presence of a viscous fluid .",
    "viscosity leads to an asymmetry in pressure during expansion and contraction which , in turn , results in a progression of cyclic epochs of successively longer duration .",
    "however tolman did not have a prescription for avoiding the big bang singularity and had to assume it a priori . an important later development which addressed both the age issue and the flatness problem was inflation . by driving the flatness parameter ,",
    "@xmath1 , towards unity , inflation ensured that the rapidly expanding universe , even if spatially closed , would expand for a long duration of time .",
    "however inflation did not address the issue of the big bang singularity and it has been shown that although inflation could be eternal in the future , its past spacetime is necessarily incomplete @xcite .",
    "the present paper further develops the central idea s of an oscillatory universe and attempts to synthesise elements of cyclic cosmology with the inflationary paradigm . extending the arguments originally proposed in @xcite",
    "we demonstrate that a universe filled with a scalar field possesses the intriguing property of ` _ hysteresis _ ' .",
    "cosmological hysteresis is related to the fact that the pressure of a scalar field is usually asymmetric with respect to expansion and contraction : @xmath2 .",
    "this asymmetry leads to the development of a _ hysteresis loop _ , @xmath3 , during each oscillatory cycle .",
    "the loop can cause consecutive cycles to be larger in amplitude and in duration . while the asymmetry between expansion and contraction is largest for inflationary potentials , the phenomenon of cosmological hysteresis appears to be _ generic",
    "_ and is observed also in potentials which do not give rise to inflation .    in  2 of this paper",
    "we develop the equations which relate cosmological hysteresis to the amplitude of successive cycles and demonstrate that these equations have a universal form which is independent of the scalar field potential responsible for hysteresis .",
    "furthermore , the presence of hysteresis appears to be robust , and is shown to exist for quite general mechanisms of singularity avoidance such as those predicted by braneworld cosmology @xcite and loop quantum gravity @xcite . in ",
    "3 we demonstrate that @xmath4 for flat potentials , which leads to the increase in amplitude of successive cycles .",
    "a remarkable feature of this scenario is that the universe appears to possess an _ ` arrow of time ' _ even though the field equations are formally time reversible ! for steep potentials the value of @xmath5 can be negative as well as positive . in this case",
    "the phenomenon of cosmological hysteresis can adorn the universe with quasi - regular oscillations , or _ beats _",
    ", resembling those in acoustic systems .",
    "section 4 discusses the behaviour of a massive scalar field during cosmological contraction .",
    "one finds that the field can grow to sufficiently large values during the contracting phase to give rise to a long duration inflationary phase at the commencement of the next expansion cycle .",
    "the behaviour of spatial anisotropy in the cyclic scenario is examined in  5 and a brief discussion of our results is presented in  6 .",
    "an oscillatory universe requires two essential ingredients : [ a ] a mechanism for singularity avoidance ( when the matter density is high ) and [ b ] a mechanism for inducing contraction ( when the matter density is low ) .",
    "below we provide a brief summary of the assumptions adopted in this paper regarding both a and b.    * [ a ] * _ cosmological bouncing scenario s _ have been widely studied ; see @xcite and @xcite for a review . within the framework of general relativity ( gr ) a necessary condition for avoiding the big bang singularity",
    "is the violation of the energy conditions usually satisfied by matter @xcite .",
    "an alternative viewpoint considers gr to be an ` effective ' theory requiring modification when the space - time curvature becomes enormous .",
    "the initial big bang singularity can be successfully replaced with a ` bounce ' in theories incorporating both these sets of ideas , examples being braneworld cosmology @xcite , loop - quantum cosmology @xcite , string theory motivated models @xcite and other modifications to the einstein - hilbert action @xcite .",
    "while a bounce in the early universe could arise in any one of the above scenario s , the central results of this paper will be model independent and so will not depend upon the specific mechanism sourcing the bounce . for illustrative purposes we shall consider a bounce which is known to arise in braneworld cosmology ( with a time - like extra dimension ) , in which the friedmann equations are modified to @xcite h^2 & = & 1 - -  , + & = & -(+3p ) - ( 2 + 3p )  .",

    "the prevailance of the bounce in ( [ eq : bounce ] ) & ( [ eq : bounce0 ] ) is not linked to the violation of any of the energy conditions by matter , but is caused instead by a departure of space - time dynamics from the predictions of gr at large values of the matter density.@xmath16 one might also note the following fairly general phenomenological prescription for singularity avoidance @xcite which provides a reasonable approximation to ( [ eq : bounce ] ) & ( [ eq : bounce0 ] ) a a ,  a - a ,   ,  .",

    "if the universe is spatially closed ( @xmath18 ) and the density of matter drops off faster than @xmath19 .",
    "this has been the conventional approach of making a matter / radiation dominated universe turnaround and contract @xcite . indeed for a perfect fluid such as dust ( @xmath20 ) the expansion factor in a closed universe is time - symmetric and is described by the cycloid ( see figure [ fig : cycloid ] ) @xmath21 for which the space - time becomes singular at @xmath22 .",
    "2 .   the universe will turnaround if , in addition to ` normal ' matter with @xmath23 , one postulates a form of matter , @xmath24 , whose energy density becomes _ negative _ at late times .",

    "these models can therefore source cosmic turnaround .",
    "both potentials contain the possibility of giving rise to a _ transiently accelerating _ universe thereby providing us with interesting candidates for dark energy @xcite as well as cyclic cosmology .",
    "other models of transient acceleration are discussed in @xcite .",
    "a novel means of using ( [ eq : bounce ] ) to obtain a cyclic universe was suggested in @xcite .",
    "these authors noted that the density in a phantom dark energy component _ increases _ as the universe expands , thus making the @xmath35 term in ( [ eq : bounce ] ) relevant both at early and at late times . in this scenario ,",
    "the bounce at small values of the expansion factor is caused by normal matter , while the universe turns around and contracts due to phantom de .",
    "the bouncing scenario [ a ] together with either of [ b1]-[b3 ] gives rise to cyclic cosmology .    in this paper",
    "we shall assume that during some period in its history the universe was dominated by a massive scalar field .",
    "the presence of a scalar can make cosmological dynamics much more versatile , as we demonstrate below .    in this case",

    "by contrast , in a contracting ( @xmath40 ) universe , @xmath38 behaves like _ anti - friction _ and accelerates the motion of the scalar field .",

    "every system resists outside forces .",
    "the scalar field expands , and a negative pressure ( or tension ) builds up .",
    "if the expansion were created by the motion of a piston in a cyclinder containing @xmath45 , the tension would decelerate the piston . on the other hand ,",
    "if the field is being compressed , a positive pressure builds up , producing a force opposing the motion of the piston . ",
    "as zeldovich suggests , there is nothing really surprising about the behaviour of the scalar field in a closed universe .",
    "what is surprising , however , is the observation @xcite that as the universe contracts , the scalar field does not perform a time reversal and move back up the same trajectory down which it descended during expansion .",
    "what is seen instead is a lag between the trajectories describing expansion and contraction .",
    "this behaviour , shown in figure [ fig : hysteresis ] , is typical of systems displaying hysteresis.@xmath46    let us now discuss the effect of hysteresis on cosmological dynamics . we assume , as in b2 , that the late time behaviour of the universe is governed by the einstein equation h^2 - , [ eq : late ] where @xmath47 , and @xmath26 , @xmath48 , so that the universe turns around and contracts if matter satisfies the strong energy condition @xmath49 .",
    "note that @xmath50 corresponds to a _ negative _ cosmological constant , whereas @xmath51 describes a universe which is spatially closed .",
    "the scalar field ( [ eq : lagr ] ) has no dissipation and therefore provides us with an example of a perfect fluid @xcite .",
    "however unlike other perfect fluids such as dust or radiation , the expansion factor for a cyclic universe filled with a scalar field need not display time - symmetric evolution .",
    "the reason for this is as follows .",
    "at turnaround the universe stops expanding and begins to contract . setting @xmath52 in ( [ eq : late ] )",

    "within such a conventional setting bouncing models with a scalar field were studied in @xcite .",
    "however it seems unlikely that hysteresis could arise in such a scenario since @xmath82 was found to arise during contraction ( inducing the bounce ) and a similar equation of state arose again during the early stages of expansion . so the asymmetry between @xmath83 and @xmath84 , which is an essential requirement for hysteresis , is virtually absent in this case .",
    "* note also that in a realistic cosmological model only some of the matter degrees of freedom driving cosmic expansion in ( [ eq : bounce0 ] ) & ( [ eq : frw0 ] ) may display hysteresis . in this case",

    "a complementary means of generating hysteresis and the associated increase in consecutive cycles , is by allowing the fluid filling the universe to be viscous and dissipative @xcite . if @xmath142 is the coefficient of bulk viscosity then the fluid pressure changes from its equilibrium value @xmath143 to @xmath144 .",

    "the reason for this proliferation of possibility rests in the following .    as pointed out in @xcite , the presence of hysteresis is closely linked to the ability of the field @xmath45 to oscillate .",
    "indeed oscillations appear to be vital for the existence of hysteresis since they play the important role of _ mixing _ the field in phase - space @xmath148 due to which the value of @xmath148 when the universe turns around and contracts is almost uncorrelated with its phase space value when the field @xmath149 began oscillating .",
    "this phase - space mixing ensures that ( during contraction ) the scalar field almost never rolls up @xmath34 along the same phase - space trajectory down which it descended ( during expansion ) , thereby ensuring @xmath150 and @xmath147 .",
    "we therefore conclude that @xmath34 must have a well defined minimum value in some region of configuration space in order to allow the possibility of hysteresis .",
    "consider as an alternative the potential @xmath151 which does not possess a minimum and is a popular candidate for dark energy @xcite . in this case",
    "no oscillatory phase is present which will reverse the sign of @xmath152 during contraction , causing @xmath149 to roll up its potential instead of down . as a result @xmath34 continuously decreases in value when the universe expands as well as contracts .",
    "the role of the potential during successive cycles therefore soon becomes negligible , and cosmological dynamics becomes solely governed by the kinetic energy @xmath153 .",
    "the universe , in this case , behaves as if it were dominated by a perfect fluid with the stiff equation of state @xmath154 and there is no possibility of hysteresis , as demonstrated in figure [ fig : rp ] .",
    "an important question which arises in connection with the bouncing scenario is whether the scalar field can rise high enough on its potential ( during contraction ) to provide an adequate number of inflationary e - folds during the ensuing round of ( post - bounce ) expansion .",
    "this value can be easily estimated as follows .    as discussed earlier",
    ", the inflationary scalar field ( @xmath155 ) in a cyclic universe passes through three successive regimes during which : ( i ) @xmath156 and the field slow - rolls down its potential resulting in @xmath82 , ( ii ) @xmath157 and the motion of the field becomes oscillatory leading to @xmath158 .",
    "the oscillatory regime exists during expansion as well as the early stages of contraction .",
    "( iii ) during the late stages of contraction the scalar field amplitude grows to @xmath159 .",
    "the field now stops oscillating and begins to climb up its potential leading to the _ stiff _ equation of state @xmath160 .",
    "( this is in response to anti - friction in ( [ eq : scalar field ] ) since @xmath161 during contraction . ) below we shall provide a simple analytical estimate of how far up its potential the field can climb before beginning its descent , soon after the universe has bounced , and the universe starts to expand once more .",
    "it is useful to note in this connection , the following exact expression describing the motion of a massive scalar field in a spatially flat universe which expands / contracts as a power law @xmath162 , where @xmath163 and @xmath164 is the equation of state : = aj_(mt ) + by_(mt )  ,   =  .",
    "[ eq : exact ] during the oscillatory dust - like phase , @xmath165 , and ( t ) [ eq : dust ] where @xmath166 is a phase constant .",
    "equation ( [ eq : dust ] ) informs us that the amplitude of the scalar field , averaged over a certain number of oscillations , increases / decreases in a contracting / expanding universe as @xmath167 . during contraction ,",
    "once the field value reaches @xmath159 , the oscillatory regime ceases and the scalar field begins to climb up its potential .",
    "this marks the commencement of the _ kinetic regime _ during which the equations of motion begin to be dominated by the kinetic energy of @xmath45 , resulting in @xmath168 , @xmath169 in ( [ eq : exact ] ) , and the solution = aj_0(mt ) + by_0(mt )  ,  where   j_0 1 ,  y_0  ,  when  mt 1  . in other words @xmath170 , where @xmath171 and @xmath172 are initial values of the scalar field velocity and the cosmic time at the commencement of the kinetic regime@xmath173 .    assuming that the bounce occures at the planck energy and remembering that @xmath159 when oscillations end , we get the following result for the scalar field amplitude at the instant of the bounce @xmath174    ( the actual value is smaller if the bounce occures at energies below the planck scale . )",
    "it is worth noting that ( [ eq : phi_bounce ] ) is valid for any potential which is less steep than the exponential@xmath175 and in this case the ratio @xmath176 of hubble parameters at the bounce and at the commencement of the kinetic regime , replaces @xmath177 in the logarithm of ( [ eq : phi_bounce ] ) so that @xmath178    while the above expression is quite general and holds for a fairly wide class of inflationary potentials , the number of e - folds during the post - bounce inflationary stage does depend upon the concrete form of the inflaton potential .",
    "consider for instance the chaotic inflationary potential , @xmath155 with @xmath179 , which is in excellent agreement with observations .",
    "substituting @xmath179 into ( [ eq : phi_bounce ] ) one obtains @xmath180 , and an embarassingly small value for the number of inflationary e - folds @xmath181 .",
    "surprisingly this does not indicate that this model can be ruled out , since , to the scalar field value at the bounce , @xmath182 , one needs to add @xmath183  the ` initial ' value of the scalar field at the commencement of the kinetic regime .",
    "the value of @xmath183 depends upon the phase of the oscillatory scalar field and ranges from @xmath184 to @xmath185 . moreover , immediately after the bounce the absolute value of the scalar field continues to increase despite the fact it now encounters a large amount of friction ( the post - bounce value of @xmath92 being positive ) .",
    "indeed , our numerical simulations@xmath186 indicate that while the value of the scalar field at the bounce is only @xmath187 , the field manages to climb to the significantly higher value @xmath188 soon after the bounce , resulting in the observationally comfortable value @xmath189 .",
    "a central issue in cosmology concerns the class of initial conditions which can give rise to a universe resembling our own .",
    "this issue was highlighted in @xcite which showed that isotropic models were a set of zero measure in the space of all homogenous solutions of the einstein equations @xcite .",
    "subsequently several mechanisms were identified , including cosmological particle creation @xcite , which might successfully dissipate a large initial anisotropy within short span of time , so that a universe which started out being highly anisotropic would rapidly isotropize to a frw space - time .",
    "perhaps the most successful of these mechanisms is inflation , which possesses a no hair property which allows the universe to inflate from a fairly general class of initial conditions @xcite . in the context of the present paper we would like to ask the question as to how a large amount of anisotropy might impact the behaviour of a cyclic universe . for this purpose",
    "we shall focus on a bianchi i universe which expands at different rates along the three spatial directions and for which the line element is ds^2 = dt^2 - r_1 ^ 2(t)dx^2 - r_2 ^ 2(t)dy^2 - r_3 ^ 2(t)dz^2  .",
    "[ eq : bianchi ] introducing the directional expansion rate h_i = r_i / r_i ,   i = 1,2,3 and the mean expansion factor @xmath190 we find the mean expansion rate h = = _",
    "i=1 ^ 3 h_i  , [ eq : bianchi1 ] in terms of which the expression for the anisotropy is simply _ = 1 ^ 3 ( h_- h)^2 =  .",
    "[ eq : shear ] the resulting ( 0 - 0 ) einstein equation 3h^2 = 8g+ + contains the anisotropy in the rhs as if it were an effective energy density with the _ stiff _ equation of state @xmath191 @xcite . in order to assess the behaviour of anisotropy in a cyclic scenario we shall assume @xmath192 , which permits the universe to turnaround and contract . as before",
    ", we also assume that in the vicinity of the ` big bang ' extra - dimensional effects @xcite modify the frw equations to h^2 & = & 1 - + +  , + & = & -(+3p ) - ( 2 + 3p)+ - 2  .",
    "[ eq : bounce_anis ]    our results shown in figure [ fig : anis ] indicate that , if the scalar field is not too heavy ( @xmath193 ) , then the oscillating universe displays monotonically increasing cycles which cause the anisotropy density @xmath194 to decrease from cycle to cycle .",
    "the necessary condition for the gradual disappearence of anisotropy and the isotropisation of the universe is therefore @xmath119 , since this guarantees that successive cycles are larger in amplitude to previous ones .",
    "note that this does not require the presence of inflation , although a short burst of inflation at the start of every cycle would clearly assist the abatement of anisotropy .",
    "in the present paper we have shown how a cyclic universe containing a self - interacting minimally coupled scalar field exhibits interesting relationships , ( [ eq : work1 ] ) & ( [ eq : work4 ] ) , linking the change in the expansion factor at turnaround / bounce to the net work - done during a given expansion - contraction cycle : @xmath0 .",
    "this relationship is quite general and requires only that the universe turnaround and bounce , so that cyclicity is maintained .",
    "it is legitimate to ask whether such a scenario can be realised within the framework of a universe which accelerates at late times , and therefore resembles our own .",
    "the demand that cyclicity makes of cosmic acceleration is that the latter be transient since otherwise our current accelerating phase would become a permanent feature of our universe , preventing turnaround .",
    "it is well known that a transiently accelerating phase can occur in several distinct models of dark energy @xcite .",
    "however , an investigation of the presence of hysteresis in such models lies somewhat beyond the scope of the present paper and we do not discuss it here .",
    "another important issue , left untouched in the present paper , concerns the development of density inhomogeneities .",
    "the universe today is characterized by structure which is significantly nonlinear on scales shorter than a few mpc .",
    "the criterion @xmath195 marks the onset of nonlinearity and the comoving nonlinear length scale @xmath196 can be defined from the equality @xcite ( /)^2 ^ 1/2 = d_+(t)(4_0^k_nl p(k)k^2 dk)^1/2 = 1 [ eq : pert ] where @xmath197 is the growing mode of the linearized density contrast and @xmath198 is the power spectrum of linear density fluctuations . for power law spectra @xmath199",
    "k_nl^-1 d_+^2/(n+3)(t )  , [ eq : knl ] and , since @xmath197 grows with time , it follows that the nonlinear length scale grows continuously from small initial values at early times to @xmath200 mpc currently .",
    "the growth of the nonlinear length scale with time reflects the fact that gravitational clustering takes place hierarchically in gravitational instability scenario s based on cold / warm dark matter .",
    "the power spectrum in such scenario s is characerized by the local spectral index @xmath201 whose value , in the case of cold dark matter , ranges from @xmath202 on scales @xmath203 mpc to @xmath204 on scales @xmath205 mpc . from ( [ eq : knl ] ) we find that the growth in @xmath196 will be affected both by the change in value of the slope @xmath206 ( as successively larges scales become nonlinear ) and the behaviour of @xmath197 .",
    "the latter is governed , in the absence of pressure and on scales significantly smaller than the hubble length , by the jeans - type equation + 2hd_+ - 4g|d_+ = 0  , [ eq : jeans ] from which we learn that the hubble parameter behaves like a damping term during expansion , when @xmath207 , causing linearized perturbations to grow much slower than they would in a static universe@xmath208 : @xmath209 . during contraction , @xmath161 , the situation is reversed since the ( negative ) hubble parameter now plays the role of an anti - damping term which significantly speeds up gravitational instability relative to expansion .",
    "this means that the nonlinear length scale will grow rapidly during contraction eventually overtaking the comoving hubble length @xmath210 which _ decreases _ with time in a contracting universe .",
    "one therefore suspects that a universe resembling ours will become strongly inhomogeneous during contraction and it is not clear whether the assumptions which went into the derivation of the bouncing equations ( [ eq : bounce ] ) will hold in this case .",
    "( since most bouncing solutions have been derived within the frw setting and rely on assumptions of homogeneity @xcite , these concerns are also relevant to them . )",
    "the above argument necessarily applies to an _ old _ universe resembling ours .",
    "it need not be true for a cyclic epoch of much shorter duration @xmath211 .",
    "if a shorter cyclic epoch preceeded ours then gravitational instability would have had insufficient time to grow to nonlinear values and the universe during contraction might persist in being quasi - homogeneous ( see @xcite for an analysis of linealized perturbations in cyclic models ) .",
    "such a situation is illustrated by the right panel of figure [ fig : phi2 ] , the first three panels of figure [ fig : cosh1 ] and by figure 4 of @xcite .",
    "to summarize , we have demonstrated the presence of hysteresis in spatially flat and closed frw cosmologies filled with a self - interacting scalar field .",
    "for these models we have established a rather simple relationship between the growth in the expansion factor and the quantum of hysteresis , namely ( [ eq : work1 ] ) .",
    "we have shown that , depending upon the value of the hysteresis loop , the universe can exhibit a wide format of behaviour including progressively larger expansion cycles ( when @xmath119 ) as well as stochasticity .",
    "an early inflationary epoch is not an essential prerequisite for the existence of increasing expansion cycles .",
    "what is required in this case is that the hysteresis loop be negative , @xmath119 , and even a small asymetry between the fluid pressure during expansion and contraction can accomplish this .",
    "in such situations , when @xmath212 but @xmath213 we sat thay hysteresis is small , in contrast to the situation portrayed in fig [ fig : hysteresis ] when @xmath121 and hysteresis is large .",
    "as demonstrated in this paper , even in situations with small hysteresis , the moderate increase in successive cycles can draw the cosmological density parameter towards unity , gently ameliorating the flatness problem .",
    "the same is true for spatial anisotropy whose value declines in a universe with growing cycles .",
    "the presence of cosmological hysteresis can also adorn the universe with quasi - regular oscillations , or _ beats _",
    ", reminiscent to those in acoustic systems .",
    "one should note here that the phenomenon of beats ( and stochasticity ) is not peculiar to the @xmath90 potential but has been observed in other potentials as well , including the potential @xmath214 associated with chaotic inflation .",
    "our treatment has focussed on scalar fields possessing canonical kinetic terms and coupling minimally to gravity .",
    "we find it intriguing that while the system which we study is fully relativistic , its broad dynamical features can be enapsulated by the well known non - relativistic thermodynamic expression @xmath215 .",
    "it would therefore be interesting to explore whether the phenomenon of hysteresis is more general and extends to cosmologies in which some of the assumptions of this paper are relaxed , such as the non - canonical scalar field models associated with dbi inflation @xcite , k - essence @xcite , ghost condensate models @xcite , cosmologies with interacting fluid components @xcite , etc .",
    "one could also ask whether cosmological hysteresis exists for scalar fields which couple non - minimally to gravity , for instance through @xmath216 , brans - dicke and field derivative type couplings @xcite , or in cosmological models featuring non - local gravity @xcite .",
    "we also leave untouched the interesting issue of quantum stability of a cyclic model displaying hysteresis , which touches on issues beyond the scope of the present paper @xcite .",
    "finally , it may also be worth enlarging the present analysis to ( higher - dimensional ) anisotropic models in which some of the spatial directions expand while others contract , and ask whether a form of hysteresis might exist in this case too .",

    "<S> a universe filled with a homogeneous scalar field exhibits ` _ cosmological hysteresis _ ' . </S>",
    "<S> cosmological hysteresis is caused by the asymmetry in the equation of state during expansion and contraction . </S>",
    "<S> this asymmetry results in the formation of a _ hysteresis loop _ : @xmath0 , whose value can be non - vanishing during each oscillatory cycle . for flat potentials </S>",
    "<S> , a negative value of @xmath0 leads to the _ increase _ in amplitude of consecutive cycles and to a universe with older and larger successive cycles . </S>",
    "<S> such a universe appears to possess an _ arrow of time _ even though entropy production is absent and all of the equations respect time - reversal symmetry ! </S>",
    "<S> cosmological hysteresis appears to be widespread and exists for a large class of scalar field potentials and mechanisms for making the universe bounce . for steep potentials </S>",
    "<S> , the value of @xmath0 can be positive as well as negative . </S>",
    "<S> the expansion factor in this case displays quasi - periodic behaviour in which successive cycles can be both larger as well as smaller than previous ones . </S>",
    "<S> this quasi - regular pattern resembles the phenomenon of _ beats _ displayed by acoustic systems . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , the expression relating the increase / decrease in oscillatory cycles to the quantum of hysteresis appears to be _ </S>",
    "<S> model independent_. the cyclic scenario is extended to spatially anisotropic models and it is shown that the anisotropy density decreases during successive cycles if @xmath0 is negative . </S>"
