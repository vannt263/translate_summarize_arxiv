    "the main idea behind the study of @xmath0 meson decays is to get precise information on cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix elements . testing the kobayashi - maskawa mechanism  @xcite of @xmath3 violation in flavor physics",
    "requires many measurements of branching ratios and @xmath3-violating observables . to consistently compare different results on common ground it is convenient to express them in terms of constraints on the apex of the ckm triangle in the @xmath5 plane ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ckmfitter ] ) where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are parameters of the wolfenstein parametrization of the ckm matrix .",
    "the weak phase @xmath8 was measured in @xmath9 decays ( including @xmath10  @xcite ) with high precision .",
    "currently , this ckm angle is determined to lie within a @xmath11 interval , @xmath12 , at 95% confidence level  @xcite .",
    "only indirect constraints exist for the other two ckm angles , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , with much larger allowed ranges : @xmath15 and @xmath16 at 95% confidence level .",
    "and @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "[ fig : ckmfitter ] ]    decays to two - body hadronic charmless final states are particularly useful since many of them involve more than one significant quark subprocess .",
    "typically the weak phase difference between tree and penguin - type diagrams is equal to @xmath4 . when the strong phases are substantially different , too , a decay has the potential for displaying direct @xmath3 asymmetries which can be observed in experiment .",
    "a reliable extraction of @xmath4 is dependent on our ability to understand the pattern of strong phases in as wide as possible a set of decays .",
    "final state interaction ( fsi ) strong phases involve nonperturbative long - distance physics and can not be computed from first principles . a data - driven flavor topology approach based on the assumption of the su(3 ) flavor symmetry",
    "@xcite offers a way to extract fsi strong phases associated with individual topological amplitudes together with the weak phase @xmath4 and topological decay amplitudes .    in this analysis",
    ", we take flavor su(3 ) symmetry @xcite as a working hypothesis .",
    "assuming factorization , we take account of su(3 ) symmetry breaking effects due to decay constant differences only when relating strangeness - conserving and strange - changing tree amplitudes .",
    "we do not expect factorization to work in penguin and color - suppressed amplitudes so we do nt make any specific assumptions beyond the strict su(3 ) symmetry .",
    "the ratios of strangeness - conserving and strange - changing amplitudes for these two types of amplitudes are assumed to be completely determined by the ratio of the weak ckm matrix elements involved in either transition .    from the results of two separate fits to @xmath2 and @xmath1 data one can extract information about fit parameters ( decay amplitudes and their strong and weak phases ) , compare with other known constraints , and make predictions for as - yet - unseen decay modes .",
    "the @xmath2 analysis has particularly good sensitivity to the ckm phase @xmath4 .",
    "this is driven in part by the pattern of tree - penguin interference in a wide variety of hadronic @xmath0 decays , and in part by the incorporation of time - dependent information on @xmath17 .",
    "the importance of @xmath18 decays is not surprising as they were shown to be particularly sensitive to the ckm weak phase @xmath19  @xcite .",
    "the values of @xmath4 that are obtained in @xmath2 and @xmath1 fits are consistent with each other and with the current indirect bounds  @xcite .",
    "the analysis of @xmath2 decays  @xcite is based on measurements performed by the babar , belle and cleo collaborations on branching ratios , @xmath3 asymmetries and/or time - dependent parameters in strangeness - preserving @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 decays , and strangeness - changing @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 decays .",
    "the total number of available data points is 34 , including some quantities that do not affect the fit such as the time - dependent mixing - induced and direct asymmetries in the @xmath29 decay , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , and the @xmath3 asymmetry @xmath32 .",
    "plots of @xmath33 as a function of @xmath4 for three version of @xmath2 fits are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gc ] .",
    "three local minima are found , around @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 .",
    "the solid line represents the fit with no constraints on the ratio @xmath37 of two different qcd penguin amplitudes in which the spectator quark hadronizes inside either a vector or a pseudoscalar final state meson .",
    ", obtained by minimizing over all remaining fit parameters , as a function of the weak phase @xmath4 .",
    "dashed curve : @xmath38 ( 24 d.o.f . ) ; dash - dotted curve : @xmath37 real ( 23 d.o.f . ) ; solid curve : @xmath37 complex ( 22 d.o.f . ) .",
    "vertical dashed lines show the boundaries of the favored 95% confidence level range of @xmath4 ( @xmath39 ) from fits to ckm parameters  @xcite based on other measurements .",
    "[ fig : gc ] ]    only one of the three solutions , @xmath40 , is consistent with the current indirect bounds .",
    "it is also the only one that features small relative strong phase between two types of tree diagrams , @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "this feature is consistent with the predictions based on qcd factorization  @xcite . with @xmath43 ,",
    "the solution represents a good description of the current data within the present experimental uncertainties .",
    "a similar analysis of @xmath1 decays  @xcite is based on measurements of branching ratios , @xmath3 asymmetries and/or time - dependent parameters in strangeness - preserving @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 decays , and strangeness - changing @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 decays .",
    "the total number of @xmath1 data points is 26 .",
    "several important lessons were learned while searching for a good @xmath1 fit to the current data .",
    "first of all , a large relative strong phase @xmath50 between the color - suppressed @xmath51 and tree @xmath52 amplitudes is crucial for getting a satisfactory agreement between fit expectations and the experimental data .",
    "although the su(3 ) fit to @xmath44 , @xmath53 decays ( fit i of ref .",
    "@xcite ) is able to accommodate the data when nontrivial @xmath54 is added to the fit , it prefers such values for @xmath55 and @xmath56 amplitudes that @xmath57 .",
    "two effects are responsible for this unusually large amplitude ratio .",
    "one is the presence of final - state interactions , the other is the importance of a penguin amplitude @xmath58 associated with intermediate @xmath59 and @xmath60 quarks .",
    "this penguin term features the same weak factors as tree - type amplitudes @xmath52 and @xmath51 .",
    "when it is not explicitly taken into account as a fit parameter , it disguises itself as a part of the tree and color - suppressed amplitudes , interfering destructively with the former and constructively with the latter .",
    "when @xmath58 is added as a fit parameter , the fit to @xmath44 , @xmath53 data ( fit ii ) separates @xmath58 and tree - level amplitudes to predict a more reasonable @xmath61 which is still larger than expected .",
    "the values of both the @xmath62 amplitude ratio and the relative phase @xmath54 are roughly consistent with the result for the @xmath63 ratio inferred from @xmath64 decays  @xcite .",
    "the extraction of this ratio from charmless @xmath1 decays yields a larger @xmath62 ratio and a larger phase than expected from the qcd factorization approach .",
    "this indicates that soft final - state interactions play an important role in @xmath0 physics despite the naive expectation that products of energetic @xmath0 decays move away too fast to experience final - state rescattering .",
    ", obtained by minimizing over all remaining fit parameters , as a function of the weak phase @xmath4 .",
    "dashed curve : fit iii of ref .",
    "@xcite ; solid curve : fit iv .",
    "vertical dashed lines show the boundaries of the favored 95% confidence level range of @xmath4 ( @xmath39 ) from fits to ckm parameters  @xcite based on other measurements .",
    "[ fig : ppfit ] ]    fig .",
    "[ fig : ppfit ] shows plots of @xmath33 as a function of @xmath4 for two versions of fits to _ all _ @xmath1 data , including final states that involve flavor - singlet @xmath7 and @xmath65 mesons .",
    "one of the fits ( fit iv ) uses @xmath66 , a singlet - penguin amplitude associated with intermediate @xmath59 and @xmath60 quarks , as a fit parameter , the other neglects it .",
    "both versions of @xmath1 fits have a local @xmath33 minimum in the range @xmath16 allowed by global fits to phases of the ckm matrix  @xcite : @xmath67 in fit iii and @xmath68 in fit iv .",
    "the variation of central values of @xmath4 between two fits is about @xmath69 , providing an estimate of the systematic error associated with this topological approach .",
    "the decays of @xmath0 mesons to a pair of charmless mesons have been analyzed within a framework of flavor su(3 ) symmetry of the topological quark diagrammatic approach .",
    "acceptable separate fits to @xmath1 and @xmath2 branching ratios and @xmath3 asymmetries were obtained with tree , color - suppressed , penguin , and electroweak penguin amplitudes .",
    "the penguin amplitude @xmath58 associated with intermediate @xmath59 and @xmath60 quarks was found to considerably improve the quality of @xmath1 fits .",
    "contrary to expectations , the value of relative strong phase @xmath54 between @xmath51 and @xmath52 amplitudes and the value of the @xmath62 ratio were found to be large , hinting at the presence of final - state interaction effects .",
    "so far , the data is accommodated well within the sm ; the largest deviation from fit predictions does not exceed @xmath70 .",
    "new experimental data on @xmath47 decays  @xcite made the so - called  @xmath47 puzzle \" less severe . @xmath71 and @xmath72 are expected to be equal in the limit of small color - suppressed amplitudes .",
    "the new data determine the difference between @xmath73 and @xmath74 to be approximately equal to @xmath75 .",
    "the discrepancy is under @xmath76 , a smaller significance than before .",
    "a joint fit to all data on charmless hadronic @xmath0 decays is currently being developed with the weak phase @xmath4 as a common parameter for the @xmath1 and @xmath2 sectors of the fit  @xcite .",
    "just as in the case of separate @xmath1 and @xmath2 fits , one can extract the magnitudes and relative phases of different topological amplitudes and make predictions for rates and @xmath3 asymmetries in as - yet - unseen decay modes , including @xmath77 decays .",
    "preliminary results of the joint fit are roughly consistent with those obtained in the analyses of @xmath78 and @xmath79 decays .",
    "the global minimum of @xmath33 is achieved at the weak phase @xmath80 .",
    "it favors @xmath4 within the range @xmath81@xmath82 at the @xmath83 level , and 48@xmath8462@xmath84 at 95% confidence level .",
