    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec1 ]",

    "* in the `` classical '' case @xmath103 ( i.e. @xmath104 ) the property follows from the next general result obtained in @xcite : let @xmath0 be a fixed domain and @xmath14 be a family of domains satisfying some mild regularity assumptions and @xmath105 ( here @xmath106 stays for the lebesgue measure in @xmath13 ) , then holds true .",
    "and indeed , although the number of attached `` rooms '' and `` passages '' tends to infinity , their total measure tends to zero .",
    "it may happen , however , that holds true , but there exists a sequence @xmath107 converging to a point not belonging to @xmath108 . as we will see below this can happen for `` room - and - passage''-like perturbations . another important class of such domains are so - called dumbbell - shaped domains . in a simplest case they are defined as follows : let @xmath10 be a union of two disjoint domains @xmath109 , @xmath110 and @xmath111 , where @xmath22 is a narrow straight channel connecting @xmath112 and @xmath113 and approaching a @xmath9-dimensional line segment of the length @xmath114 as @xmath30 .",
    "it can be proved that if @xmath115 as @xmath30 then either @xmath116 or @xmath117 for some @xmath118 .",
    "the spectral properties of boundary value problems posed in dumbbell - shaped domains were studied in a lot of papers  see , e.g. , @xcite . some general results allowing to characterize the set of accumulation points , which are not in the spectrum of @xmath108 , were obtained in @xcite .    * 2 . * one can also study the behaviour of the spectrum of the dirichlet laplacian under a perturbation of the boundary of a domain .",
    "but in this case the continuity of eigenvalues holds for rather wide set of perturbations . for example ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , if @xmath10 is a bounded domains and @xmath119 then the @xmath16-th eigenvalue of the dirichlet laplacian in @xmath17 converges to the @xmath16-th eigenvalue of the dirichlet laplacian in @xmath10 .",
    "it is easy to see that `` room - and - passage''-like perturbations described above ( with @xmath120 ) satisfy conditions .",
    "however , the situation might be more complicated if together with the geometry of a boundary we perturb the mass density near it .",
    "* 3 . * boundary value problems in domains with rapidly oscillating boundary",
    "attract a great attention of mathematicians in recent years .",
    "such problems are motivated by various applications in physics and engineering sciences ( for example , in scattering of acoustic and electromagnetic waves on small periodic obstacles ) .",
    "we mention here some papers devoted to such problems ",
    "@xcite , more references one can find in @xcite . to the best of our knowledge , problems in domains with rapidly oscillating boundary and `` room - and - passage''-like geometry of a period cell were considered only in the book @xcite mentioned above .",
    "the asymptotic behaviour of eigenvibrations of a body with mass density singularly perturbed near its boundary was studied , for example , in @xcite and many other papers .",
    "the overview of results in this area one can find in the introduction of @xcite .",
    "perturbations involving both the perturbation of the boundary and of the mass density were studied in @xcite , here the domain in @xmath19 is perturbed by attaching a lot of narrow strips of a fixed length ( so - called _ thick junctions _ ) , on these strips the mass density is large .    *",
    "* as we announced above our limit spectral problem may contain the spectral parameter in boundary conditions .",
    "namely , we get the following boundary conditions : @xmath121 where @xmath122 is either linear ( @xmath102 ) or rational ( @xmath101 ) function . in the later case",
    "@xmath122 has exactly one pole ( the point @xmath82 ) , which is a point of accumulation of eigenvalues .",
    "the boundary conditions of the form appear in some problems with concentrated masses ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , also in problems involving thick junctions  see , e.g. , @xcite . in these problems @xmath123 is a meromorphic function with a sequence of poles .",
    "elliptic boundary value problems with boundary conditions containing a spectral parameter were studied in many papers  see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein .",
    "* domains with `` room - and - passage''-like geometry are widely used in order to construct examples illustrating various phenomena in sobolev spaces theory ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "for instance , it is well - known , that if @xmath10 is a _ bounded _",
    "domain then the imbedding @xmath124 is compact provided @xmath5 is sufficiently regular .",
    "if @xmath5 is not smooth , then @xmath125 need not be compact .",

    "@xcite ) that under a special choice of sizes of `` rooms '' and `` passages '' the embedding @xmath125 is non - compact .",
    "the non - compactness of @xmath125 leads to occurrence of essential spectrum for @xmath126 . in this connection",
    ", we mention the following nice result from @xcite : for an arbitrary closed set @xmath127 , @xmath128 and @xmath47 one can construct the domain @xmath129 such that the essential spectrum of @xmath130 is just this set @xmath131 . in their constructions",
    "the authors of @xcite used `` room - and - passage''-like domains .",
    "* one can consider also the `` bulk '' analogue of our domain @xmath17 .",
    "namely , we perturbed the domain @xmath10 to the family @xmath132 , @xmath133 of @xmath85-dimensional riemannian manifolds , where @xmath134 is a family of small holes distributed @xmath52-periodically in @xmath10 ( they play the role of `` passages '' ) , @xmath135 is a family of spherical surfaces ( they play the role of `` rooms '' ) , @xmath59 is glued to the boundary of @xmath136 .",
    "when @xmath30 the number of attached surfaces goes to infinity , while their radii goes to zero . instead of the usual laplacian we study the lalplace - beltrami operator @xmath137 in @xmath17 ( the choice of the boundary conditions on @xmath138 is inessential ) .",
    "evolution equations involving @xmath137 were studied in @xcite .",
    "the behaviour of its spectrum as @xmath30 was studied in @xcite . in particular ,",
    "it was shown in @xcite that under a suitable choice of sizes of @xmath136 and @xmath59 the limit spectral problem in @xmath10 has the form @xmath139 , where @xmath122 is a rational function with one pole ; the spectrum of this problem has the same structure as we have in our limit problem , when @xmath101 , @xmath91 .",
    "* 8 . * our research",
    "is inspired , in particular , by spectral problems involving periodic differential operators posed in domains with periodic waveguide - like geometry ( tubes with periodically varying cross - section , etc . ) .",
    "it is well - known that spectra of such operators have band structure , that is a locally finite union of compact intervals  _ bands_. in general the bands may overlap , otherwise we have a _ gap _ in the spectrum , i.e. an open bounded interval having an empty intersection with the spectrum , but with edges belonging to it .",
    "the presence of gaps is important for the description of wave processes which are governed by differential operators under consideration .",
    "if the wave frequency belongs to a gap , then the corresponding wave can not propagate in the medium .",
    "the problem of constructing of periodic differential operators posed in domains with periodic waveguide - like geometry and having non - void spectral gaps attracts a lot attention in the last years ",
    "see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "our guess is that `` room - and - passage''-like perturbation of a straight waveguide will imply the opening of gaps .",
    "this conjecture is based on the following observation .",
    "let @xmath140 ( @xmath141 ) be a strip in @xmath19 , @xmath142 .",
    "it is not hard to show ( using the proof of lemma [ lm1 ] ) that there exists @xmath143 such that for an arbitrary @xmath144 the interval @xmath145 has an empty intersection with the spectrum of the problem provided @xmath146 is less some @xmath147 ( where @xmath147 is independent of @xmath144 ) .",
    "this suggests that the spectrum of the operator @xmath75 posed in the unbounded ( @xmath148 ) periodic waveguide - like domain @xmath17 has a gap provided @xmath52 and the thickness of unperturbed strip @xmath10 are small enough .",
