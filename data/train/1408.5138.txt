    "an external electric field perpendicular to a bernal - stacked bilayer graphene , breaks layer and sublattice symmetry ; localizing charge over two sublattices in different layers . under this charge landscape , it is not obvious how charge current flows within the sample .",
    "we have shown here that current distribution is highly affected by the polarization of charge to only one sublattice , as well as by the geometry of the system ( width considered and presence or not of edges ) and by the strength of the electric field .",
    "we demonstrate that current does not necessarily flow over regions of the system with higher charge density , even when next - nearest neighbor hoppings are included in our model . for some energy ranges",
    ", charge can be polarized to one layer , while the current is equally distributed over both layers .",
    "there are also considerable energy ranges for which the current flows predominantly over the layer with much lower charge density .",
    "we show that this effect can be explained by the sublattice polarization of charge in the ab - stacking biased blg , and that it is robust against disorder .",
    "therefore , to design applications of bilayer graphene in digital electronics , it is essential to calculate not only the charge distribution in each layer , but also the current density distribution in each layer , as it presents much richer details than the more monotonic behavior of the charge distribution .",
