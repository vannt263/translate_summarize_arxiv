    "most of the theoretical models for associative memory of neural networks as typified by the hopfield model  @xcite have been based on the idea of rate coding , which assumes that information is coded in the firing rate of a neuron at a particular time . on the other hand",
    ", some experimental results on the visual cortex have been suggesting the possibility of another scheme of information coding , that is , the concept of temporal coding which assumes that information is coded in the relative timing of the firing pulses  @xcite .    stimulated by these experimental findings , studies of the temporal coding are becoming an active area of theoretical brain researches . recently , there have been an increasing number of papers reporting neurophysiological experimental findings of synchronization phenomena of neurons in animal s brain  @xcite .",
    "synchronized firings of neurons can be considered to play a key role in certain types of information processing such as the binding problem  @xcite .    in order to get insights into basic properties of the scheme of the temporal coding it will be necessary to study neural network models based on neurons that can be expressed by such nonlinear oscillators as limit - cycle type and integrate - and - fire type oscillators .",
    "indeed , a network of integrate - and - fire neurons , where one can be directly concerned with the spike timing of neurons , is one of such models and was previously studied  @xcite to confirm its functioning as associative memory accompanied by synchronized firings",
    ".    the simplest theoretical model of synchronization of coupled oscillators will be the case of a system of phase oscillators of kuramoto et al .",
    "@xcite , which is derived under the assumption of weak coupling limit for general types of limit - cycle oscillators . in an associative memory model based on such a system with the hebb type learning rule",
    ", the distribution of native frequencies will become crucial for the behavior of synchronization or desynchronization of the system  @xcite .",
    "if all of the oscillators have an identical native frequency and the couplings are symmetric , the network can be reduced , by an appropriate coordinate transformation , to a system that has a lyapunov function ensuring stability of its equilibrium state(s ) , which implies that the network eventually settles into a synchronized state . on the other hand , in the case when native frequencies are distributed , lyapunov functions in general no longer exist except for a particular case  @xcite and the network becomes essentially of dynamic nature ; one may expect partial synchronization or more complex oscillatory behavior .    in the present paper ,",
    "we report results of our detailed analysis of associative memory of an oscillator neural network model with distributed native frequencies .",
    "whereas oscillator networks with a lyapunov function were studied previously by several authors  @xcite , satisfactory analysis of the case without a lyapunov function has been far less conducted  @xcite .",
    "the oscillator network model we consider is described by the following phase evolution equations  @xcite : @xmath1 where @xmath2 denotes the total number of neurons , and @xmath3 and @xmath4 respectively denote the phase and the native frequency of @xmath5-th neuron .",
    "we assume the strength of interactions to be given according to the hebb learning rule , @xmath6 where @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) represents the @xmath9-th stored patterns .",
    "we consider the case when the number of patterns is extensive , @xmath10 . in order to elucidate the effect of the distribution of native frequencies on the behavior of synchronization we want to make the model as simple as possible , and",
    "then we assume @xmath11 to take values @xmath12 rather than continuous values with @xmath13 , ( @xmath14 $ ] ) , which would be more appropriate for the study of temporal coding itself .",
    "furthermore , we deal with a simple case where the native frequency distribution @xmath15 is discrete and symmetric with respect to the central frequency @xmath16 : @xmath17 , @xmath18 . it is noted that without loss of generality one can set @xmath19 as a result of rotational symmetry of the phase evolution equation ( [ phase - eq ] ) .",
    "if the native frequencies are the same , i.e. , @xmath20 independent of @xmath5 , all of the oscillators can get synchronized with @xmath21 . in the case of distributed native frequencies ,",
    "there remain , in general , a group of desynchronized oscillators .",
    "then the total system can not settle into entirely equilibrium states .",
    "assuming that influences exerted by a group of desynchronized neurons on the macroscopic behavior of the total system can be neglected , we use the self - consistent signal - to - noise analysis ( scsna )  @xcite to analytically obtain the macroscopic order parameter equations for the time - stationary states of synchronized oscillations of the network accompanying memory retrieval .    introducing the complex variable @xmath22 to express the state of @xmath23-th neuron",
    ", we formally obtain the fixed point equations by putting @xmath24 ; @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the local field and @xmath27 denotes its complex conjugate .",

    "the effect of distribution of native frequencies on the behavior of memory retrieval is summarized in fig .  3 , where overlap @xmath33 from the scsna equations is plotted as a function of @xmath59 and @xmath55 for @xmath69 .",
    "there appear two distinct retrieval regimes separated by a valley or gap located around a region with an intermediate value of @xmath55 in the @xmath33-@xmath59-@xmath55 space . in the regime with small @xmath55 , most of the oscillators undergo synchronized motions .",
    "the storage capacities @xmath62 corresponding to the edge of the @xmath33 surface are observed to decrease , as @xmath55 is increased , to attain a certain minimum value , where a crossover to the other regime occurs . in the regime with large @xmath55 ,",
    "oscillators with @xmath55 oscillate with their own frequencies that are modified from the original @xmath55 as a result of entrainment phenomenon .",
    "such a behavior can easily be understood by considering the system in the limit @xmath70 . in the large @xmath55 limit , while most of the oscillators with @xmath71 get synchronized , the oscillators with @xmath72 can not get synchronized and they oscillate with their own frequency @xmath73 independently of the synchronized neurons with @xmath71 .",
    "it is clearly seen in this case that the desynchronized neurons does not contribute to the time - averaged local fields acting on the synchronized neurons .",
    "then the system can be viewed as a diluted system with only a fraction @xmath54 of neurons participating in memory retrieval .",
    "it is interesting to note that the storage capacity @xmath62 in the large @xmath55 region increases as @xmath55 is increased .",
    "the crossover between the two regimes or the gap in the @xmath74 curve with fixed @xmath59 can be more clearly seen in fig .  4 , which display the @xmath55 dependence of overlap @xmath33 obtained from the scsna together with the result of numerical simulations ( @xmath75 ) for a fixed value of @xmath59 .",
    "as the fraction @xmath54 of the oscillators with the central frequency @xmath16 is varied , there occur three types of behavior of the @xmath74 curve showing the cross over between the two regimes . in fig .  5",
    ", we show the @xmath55 dependence of the overlap @xmath33 obtained for @xmath76 and @xmath77 with @xmath78 .",
    "while for @xmath54 large one sees a continuous crossover between the small @xmath55 regime and the large @xmath55 regime , for @xmath54 small the large @xmath55 regime disappears . for only intermediate values of @xmath54",
    ", one observes the gap in the @xmath74 curve to appear .",
    "the occurrence of such two retrieval regimes is not restricted to the simplest case of @xmath79 , but is also observed for more general case with @xmath80 . when a sufficiently large number of oscillators have native frequencies near the central one @xmath16 , the system can behave the same way as that of @xmath79 with @xmath81 , as is shown fig .  6 , where the @xmath82 dependence of the overlap @xmath33 obtained by numerical simulations is displayed for the native frequency distribution with @xmath83 and @xmath84 :    @xmath85",
    "indeed we see a gap separating the small @xmath82 regime from the large @xmath82 one .",
    "although there are no oscillators with @xmath19 because of @xmath84 , most of the oscillators get synchronized for the small @xmath82 regime .",
    "we have studied the behavior of the oscillator neural network system with distributed native frequencies . to date analysis of associative memory models",
    "has been mostly confined to the case of networks with an energy or lyapunov function that allows use of replica symmetric calculations of statistical mechanics . in the present work , making use of the method of the scsna that is free from the energy concept  @xcite , we have succeeded in analyzing properties of _ the associative memory accompanied by synchronized oscillations _ in the prototype oscillator network that has no lyapunov functions except for the case when @xmath86 .",
    "_ we have shown that the oscillator network can work as associative memory based on temporal coding of simple type even in the presence of distribution of native frequencies . _",
    "our approach has taken advantage of the fact that such temporal attractors as limit - cycles of certain types of dynamical systems can be reduced to a fixed - point type attractors as a result of the system s symmetry property .",
    "the distribution of native frequencies does not allow the present coupled oscillator system to settle into an entirely synchronized state but into a partially synchronized one .",
    "the contributions from desynchronized neurons to the macroscopic behavior of the system have , however , been found to be almost negligible .",
    "thereby , the partially synchronized state of the system has turned out to be almost determined by the long time behavior of the group of synchronized neurons , which can be described by fixed - point type attractors giving rise to retrieval states . in other words ,",
    "_ memory retrieval is achieved by synchronization of oscillatory motions of neurons . _    under the assumed type of native frequency distribution we have found that _ the partial synchronization is classified into a high degree of synchronization that occurs for small @xmath55 with overlap @xmath33 large and a low degree of synchronization that occurs for large @xmath55 with @xmath33 small .",
    "_    finally we note that oscillator neural networks are considered to have advantage over fixed - point type neural networks in several respects .",
    "first , oscillator neural networks exhibit the ability to easily and efficiently discriminate a successful retrieval from unsuccessful one , because the settling into a retrieval state of oscillator neural networks implies the appearance of oscillations with an appreciable amplitude and the central frequency @xmath16 in the overlap , and hence , the local fields of neurons .",
    "second , by utilizing phase as well as amplitude as dynamical variables representing output of a neuron  @xcite it becomes possible for neural information to be processed in terms of spatio - temporal patterns of neuronal firings .",
    "in particular , information on time domain is available by employing the scheme of temporal coding  @xcite , where assuming uniformly distributed random numbers @xmath87 on @xmath88 for components of the memory patterns , the phase difference @xmath89 between the two oscillators @xmath5 and @xmath90 eventually settles into the difference @xmath91 of the memory pattern @xmath9 .",
    "our present model setting based on the use of binary patterns with @xmath92  @xcite presents a special as well as simple case of the above temporal coding , where the pattern of synchronization is either of in phase or out of phase .",
    "such a case may be related to the problem of segmentation of an object from its background  @xcite .",
    "more generally , pattern segmentation  @xcite seems to be one of the unique features of oscillator neural networks as has been studied by wang et al .",
    "@xcite , who pointed out that use of limit cycles as attractor states of associative memory facilitates switching between one pattern and another on the time domain .",
    "while studying the important issue of the functionality of pattern segmentation provided by oscillator neural networks will require taking into account some specific ingredients such as the sparseness of the memory patterns and appropriate inhibitory couplings , our simple model will have wide applicability in exploring the computational ability or relevance exhibited by oscillator neural networks from the viewpoint of analytical studies . extending the assumed symmetric native frequency distribution to more general cases of asymmetric one as well as continuous ones",
