    "over the past two decades , experiments @xcite that turn single molecules of twist - storing polymers like dna have been performed .",
    "the conformational transition that is associated with these experiments attracts continuing interest . in this paper",
    ", we propose a related thought experiment and model it by weighting the writhe of self - avoiding polygons ( sap ) on the simple cubic ( sc ) lattice .",
    "we are interested in observing the typical signs that are associated with real phase transitions .",
    "the self - avoiding walk ( saw ) in three dimensions is one of the simplest models of polymers .",
    "it reduces polymers down to two features .",
    "first , it represents the fact that a polymer is composed from a large number of repeating subunits .",
    "second , the self - avoidance reflects the fact that polymers can not be compressed arbitrarily . as a model of long polymers in statistical mechanics ,",
    "the saw is known to make correct predictions about the scaling of the end - to - end distance or equivalently the radius of gyration of a polymer in a good solvent at thermal equilibrium .",
    "when we denote the length of the saw by @xmath0 , the expectation value of the squared radius of gyration is predicted to obey the scaling form    @xmath1    where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are constants specific to the lattice on which the saw lives .",
    "in contrast , the exponents @xmath4 and @xmath5 are considered to be universal . they have been determined from simulations @xcite as well as from calculations in the context of the renormalization group idea . this is due to a mapping of the saw onto the magnetic @xmath6-vector model in the formal limit @xmath7 .",
    "recent predictions @xcite are @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the predictions for the leading scaling exponent @xmath4 agree with experiments on dna @xcite that for long molecules of dna fit their results to @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the length of the dna .",
    "in addition saws are used as configurations of various standard models of single polymer phase transitions .",
    "most notable are the collapse and adsorption transitions . in the latter case , one considers all saws above a plane in three dimensions or above a line in two dimensions and weights the saws by the number of contacts made with the wall ( surface or line , respectively ) .",
    "denote a saw by @xmath12 , where @xmath13 are the vertices .",
    "denote by @xmath14 the number of visits to the wall , then the saws of length @xmath0 are distributed according the boltzmann distribution @xmath15 where @xmath16 measures the number of visits in @xmath17 , @xmath18 is the partition function and @xmath19 is related to the interaction strength between the polymer and the wall .",
    "we remark that we use the subscript in the coupling @xmath19 only as a label , not an index so that when we denote by @xmath20 the number of saws of length @xmath0 with @xmath14 visits , we may write the partition function as @xmath21 the finite size free energy is defined as @xmath22 so that in the thermodynamic limit @xmath23 , it is known that there is a critical value @xmath24 at which the free energy @xmath25 becomes non - analytic .",
    "when the critical value is crossed from below the system undergoes a continuous phase transition from a desorbed phase into the adsorbed phase . in the desorbed phase the first derivative of the free energy with respect to @xmath19 vanishes , while in the adsorbed phase a certain fraction of the vertices is expected to be in contact with the wall .",
    "correspondingly , the transition is associated with a discontinuity in the second derivative @xmath26 , which jumps from zero to some finite value at @xmath24 . at finite size ,",
    "the singular part of the free energy near @xmath24 obeys a standard scaling ansatz @xmath27 where @xmath28 , @xmath29 is a scaling function and @xmath30 is called the crossover exponent . in the case of the adsorbed walk , the crossover exponent takes a mean field value of @xmath31 at the transition .",
    "an exact solution for certain directed saws in two dimensions is given in @xcite , which also includes an expression for the scaling function . in the following",
    ", we will consider sap which are saws , the first and last vertex of which are adjacent .",
    "the writhe is a quantity associated with the topology and geometry of a space curve . in the lattice polymer literature @xcite , the writhe of a sap",
    "is usually computed based on a theorem by lacher and sumners @xcite , who realized that the expression for the writhe of a @xmath32 curve @xmath33 @xmath34 simplifies for a sap @xmath17 on the sc lattice to considering the linking number between @xmath17 and four copies of @xmath17 that are translated by eg .",
    "therefore , @xmath36 on the other hand , there exist several @xcite expressions for the writhe of polygonal curves . in @xcite",
    "we derived one of these ourselves .",
    "when the @xmath6 segments of a polygonal knot @xmath33 are aligned in directions @xmath37 @xmath38 , the writhe is given by @xmath39 with @xmath40\\right)}{2\\pi}\\biggl\\{\\arctan\\left(\\frac{\\left\\langle \\mathbf{d},\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{a}}_{i-1}\\right\\rangle -\\left\\langle \\mathbf{d},\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{a}}_{i}\\right\\rangle \\,\\left\\langle \\hat{\\mathbf{a}}_{i-1},\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{a}}_{i}\\right\\rangle } { \\left|\\left[\\hat{\\mathbf{a}}_{i-1},\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{a}}_{i},\\,\\mathbf{d}\\right]\\right|}\\right)\\nonumber \\\\   &   & + \\arctan\\left(\\frac{\\left\\langle \\mathbf{d},\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{a}}_{i}\\right\\rangle -\\left\\langle \\mathbf{d},\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{a}}_{i-1}\\right\\rangle \\,\\left\\langle \\hat{\\mathbf{a}}_{i-1},\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{a}}_{i}\\right\\rangle } { \\left|\\left[\\hat{\\mathbf{a}}_{i-1},\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{a}}_{i},\\,\\mathbf{d}\\right]\\right|}\\right)\\biggr\\}\\label{eq : tw_i},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath41 must be chosen so that it does not lie on the tantrix of @xmath33 .",
    "( the tantrix , or tangent indicatrix , is the set of all unit tangents to the curve . )",
    "we can then apply ( [ eq : wr_poly ] ) to a general sap on the sc lattice to obtain    [ lem : writhe_on_sc]let @xmath42 , then the writhe of a sap @xmath17 on the sc lattice is given by    @xmath43\\left\\langle \\mathbf{d},\\,\\hat{\\varphi}_{i-1}+\\hat{\\varphi}_{i}\\right\\rangle \\label{eq : wr_sc_writhe_twist_formula}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in ( [ eq : wr_poly ] ) , the segment directions @xmath37 take the values of one of the lattice vectors @xmath44 of the sc lattice @xmath45 . here",

    "the ensemble of saps on the sc lattice has been considered in @xcite , where the authors introduced a scaling exponent @xmath57 associated with the absolute writhe . here , we will define this exponent via the relation @xmath58 the results obtained in @xcite via simulations are compatible with @xmath59 , which in @xcite was suspected to be the lower boundary for @xmath60 . in @xcite",
    ", it was shown via simulations that the value @xmath59 appears to hold even when the ensemble is restricted to saps of given knot types ( figure  [ fig : intro_knots ] ) .",
    "we point out that the fits used to estimate the scaling exponent from simulation results did not take into account any corrections to the leading scaling in ( [ eq : scaling_w2 - 1 ] ) and all fits that have been performed consistently estimated @xmath60 slightly larger than one . for saws ( not saps ) , it was shown in @xcite via the renormalization group method that @xmath59 .",
    "it was also determined that the corrections @xmath61 take the form @xmath62 at the collapse transition .",
    "diagrams of prime knots .",
    "the knot types are : the unknot , the trefoil knot and the @xmath63 knot .",
    ", width=226 ]    in a previous paper @xcite we have considered the partition function @xmath64 , where we weight the writhe of saws using simulations , but without restricting the knot type .",
    "we found a strong first - order transition , which had been suspected by @xcite using renormalization group arguments .",
    "we showed that this first - order transition is between different knot types , so that at high @xmath65 the ensemble is dominated by complicated chiral knots near maximum writhe .",
    "we remark that the results provided in @xcite should imply that for a general saw on any lattice the maximum writhe scales as @xmath66 , so that we would expect @xmath67 at high @xmath65 .    however , when the knot type is restricted , the maximum writhe will be bounded as @xmath68 . therefore , at high @xmath65 one expects @xmath69 .",
    "the formula ( [ eq : wr_poly ] ) suggests that the writhe can be decomposed into a global and local contribution .",
    "however , this decomposition is not unique as it depends on the choice of @xmath70 . nevertheless , it is possible to consider an ensemble of saws ( saps ) , such that for every state of the ensemble all writhe can be computed along the saw .",
    "for example , one can weight the writhe of directed saws that form the center line of a directed lattice ribbon @xcite . due to its local nature",
    ", this model is not associated with a phase transition as the free energy for large @xmath0 will take the form @xmath71 with @xmath72 . due to symmetry of the writhe , that is",
    "@xmath73 , the writhe expectation value ( @xmath74 ) vanishes at @xmath75 .",
    "then with @xmath76 the scaling exponent must take the form @xmath77 we can consider the values of @xmath57 in ( [ eq : zeta_local ] ) to be trivial as they can be understood by writhe forming along the saw / sap",
    ".      polymers that can absorb energy in the form of twist have been called @xcite twist - storing polymers .",
    "most prominently , this includes double stranded dna .",
    "experiments @xcite performed on dsdna in thermal equilibrium resemble turning a piece of rubber coated cable . after adding sufficient",
    "turns to the molecule , the polymer is believed to undergo a transition into states in which it wraps around itself to form plectonemes . in the literature @xcite the mechanics of this",
    "have been modeled as ribbons @xcite .",
    "the boundary curves of the ribbon can ( for example ) be thought to represent the strands of a dna molecule .",
    "only if the knot type ( figure  [ fig : intro_knots ] ) of the polymer is conserved , the linking number between these curves is controlled by the number of turns and according to the cfw theorem @xcite , the linking number can be absorbed either in the form of twist or in the form of writhe : @xmath78    sketch of the thought experiment . both sides of a dna like polymer are attached to the apparatus .",
    "the depicted cylinder can be rotated ( black arrows ) .",
    "the tsp exerts a force @xmath79 on the cylinder which attacks at a distance @xmath80 from the centre ( green arrow ) . on the other hand , a force @xmath81 ( red arrow )",
    "can be applied at a distance @xmath33 from the centre .",
    "then , the net torque exerted on the cylinder reads @xmath82 . ]    in this paper we devise a thought experiment that is slightly different from the ones currently performed on dna .",
    "we consider a two sided apparatus as shown in figure  [ fig : torquemachine ] .",
    "on one side the twist storing polymer ( tsp ) is attached to an immobile part of the apparatus , on the other side , the tsp is connected to a turn - able cylindrical structure , which is used to control the linking number between the two strands of the double stranded molecule . in order to apply a pulling force ,",
    "we take a magnetic bead , attach a loop to it and pass one end of the tsp through the loop before it is attached to the apparatus . via a magnetic field",
    ", a constant pulling force can be applied to the polymer .",
    "note that the force does not attack at a specific point of the tsp .",
    "in fact , it is important that there is as little as possible interaction between the loop material and the tsp . instead of controlling the number of turns",
    ", we can imagine to keep the polymer at a constant torque @xmath65 .",
    "this is called the constant torque ensemble .      a self - avoiding unknot ( sauk ) above a surface of length @xmath83 .",
    "the step furthest away from the surface defines the extension @xmath84 .",
    ", width=188 ]    we conjecture that the critical structure related to the above thought experiment can be obtained by weighting the writhe of self - avoiding polygons on the sc lattice .",
    "this is supported by the observation that the linking number of a lattice ribbon was recently proved to be equal to the writhe of the centre line of the lattice ribbon in @xcite , itself a self - avoiding polygon on the sc lattice .",
    "while not every self - avoiding polygon on the simple cubic lattice can be the center line of the lattice ribbon , the condition for polygons that can is merely local , so that we conjecture that the critical structure remains unaffected by extending the ensemble to all saps .",
    "the knot type of these polymers is restricted to be the unknot .",
    "thus , we refer to these as self - avoiding unknots ( sauk ) .",
    "imagine a surface at @xmath85 , so that the sauk is restricted to the positive half space @xmath86 . in the thought experiment ,",
    "the energy associated with pulling is proportional to the distance @xmath84 of the bead from the plane @xmath85 . at least for strong pulling forces",
    "this should typically be identical to the @xmath87-component of the vertex furthest away from the surface .",
    "we define @xmath88 the second parameter @xmath89 is an appropriate multiple of the writhe",
    ". then , the partition function reads @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the number of sauks of length @xmath0 , writhe @xmath89 and extension @xmath84 .",
    "the finite size free energy is given by @xmath92 .",
    "the remainder of this paper is structured as follows . in section  [ sec : directed - sauk - with_axis ] we will define a directed version of a sauk .",
    "we use it to show via an exact solution that weighting the writhe of certain unknotted induces a real phase transition . by construction",
    ", this transition must be associated with the sauk wrapping around itself . in section  3",
    "we use simulations to weight the writhe of pulled sauk on the sc lattice .",
    "we summarize and discuss the results in section  4 .",
    "in this section , we define a directed version of a sap on the sc lattice , the knot type of which is the unknot . when a general unknotted sap is under strong stretching force and not too much torque , we might expect that a typical conformation may be approximated by two saws , directed in pulling direction , that begin at the origin and join on some plane @xmath93 .",
    "the directedness of the saws guarantees that the joined object is indeed an unknot .",
    "unfortunately , this model is still too hard to solve so that we will have to simplify it considerably .",
    "therefore , consider that one of the two saws steps only along a given axis .",
    "the resulting object shall be called a self - avoiding unknot ( sauk ) with axis .",
    "[ def_axial_poly]given a lattice base vector @xmath94 on the sc lattice and a root vertex @xmath95 , we define an sauk with axis @xmath17 of length @xmath0 as a two component lattice object .",
    "the first component is a directed self - avoiding walk comprising of vertices @xmath96 such that    1 .",
    "the walk ends on the axis defined by @xmath94 and the root , i.e. @xmath97 2 .",
    "no vertex of the walk except @xmath95 and @xmath98 lie on the axis , i.e. @xmath99 for all @xmath100 and all @xmath101 .",
    "the walk is directed and makes no steps against the @xmath94 direction , i.e. @xmath102 for all @xmath101    the second component is a walk of length @xmath103 that connects the vertices @xmath98 and @xmath95 .",
    "the vertex positions are given as @xmath104 @xmath105 .",
    "sauk with axis of length 24 .",
    "the depicted case is an additionally directed version , which can be ( more or less ) solved exactly.,width=377,height=226 ]    the general case of sauks with axis is still too hard to solve , so that only a subset of sauks with axis on the sc lattice will be considered for the ensemble .",
    "their construction is described in the following .",
    "the axis direction will be @xmath106 and the lattice polymer will be confined to the slab @xmath107 .",
    "we set @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 ,  @xmath111 .",
    "the sauks can be constructed by appending double steps in @xmath112 direction .",
    "for example , we can append a double step @xmath113 to @xmath114 so that @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "in addition , whenever the current @xmath117-component is not zero , a triple step @xmath118 or @xmath119 can be appended .",
    "the applicable step combination depends on whether the current vertex lies on the plane @xmath120 or @xmath121 . with",
    "every appended double or triple step , we also append a step in @xmath122 direction to the axis .",
    "whenever a vertex with components @xmath123 is reached , the sauk can be finished by appending a step in @xmath124-direction .",
    "a lattice object constructed according to these rules is shown in figure  [ fig : ww_sap - with - axis ] .",
    "we can choose the writhe formula ( [ eq : wr_sc_writhe_twist_formula ] ) , to find the rule that the double steps in @xmath124 direction contribute @xmath125 to writhe @xmath126 when @xmath127 , and the double steps in @xmath128 direction decrease the writhe by @xmath125 .",
    "when @xmath129 , the writhe contributions are inverted . from this point of view , there is no other source of writhe .",
    "note that the writhe of this simplified sauk with axis comes in multiples of two .",
    "we do not consider a pulling force , so that when we denote the number of these specified sauks with length @xmath0 and writhe @xmath89 by @xmath130 the partition function reads @xmath131    to solve the model , we will try to obtain an expression for the generating function of sauks with axis @xmath132 the strategies for solving similar problems have been used for example in @xcite .",
    "in addition to the generating function  [ eq : ww_gen_sauk ] , one introduces a generating function for unfinished sauks of length @xmath0 , where @xmath0 counts the number of steps in the walk and in the axis .",
    "denote by @xmath133 the generating function of unfinished sauks whose walk ends on the plane @xmath120 at @xmath134 .",
    "correspondingly , when the walk ends on the plane @xmath121 , we denote the generating function by @xmath135 . therefore , @xmath136 .",

    "note that for @xmath141 ( [ eq : ww_ah_2 ] ) can be inverted to give @xmath150 for @xmath151 , this can be used in ( [ eq : ww_bh ] ) to obtain the bulk relation for @xmath133 , @xmath152 this is a difference equation of order four for @xmath133 .",

    "the system is in the bulk phase so that the free energy must take the form @xmath204 numerically , the values approximate to ( @xmath205 ) @xmath206    we conclude that we have shown that , at least in principle , weighting the writhe of sauk can induce a phase transition at a non - trivial value of @xmath207 .",
    "this is true , at least when the ensemble of sap is restricted appropriately . by construction ,",
    "the high torque phase is associated with the sauk that wrap around their axis . in the next section we will consider the full ensemble of sap via simulations .",
    "self - avoiding lattice knots , including sauks have been treated via simulations in the lattice polymer literature before .",
    "most notably in @xcite , the authors considered saps of lengths up to @xmath208 via markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) simulations , where ( effectively ) uncorrelated samples were generated with the two - point pivot algorithm . via a knot detection algorithm , the samples could then be categorized by knot type .",
    "their main result was that the scaling exponent associated with the radius of gyration appears to be invariant when the ensemble of sap is restricted to a certain knot type .",
    "a result that can not be derived from the renormalization group , as the renormalization group transformation will in general not preserve the knot type .    in this section",
    "we want to consider the ensemble of unknotted sap ( sauk ) weighted by their writhe .",
    "however , we will not use the same approach as in @xcite to sample states via mcmc .",
    "there are two reasons for this .",
    "first , when the writhe of saps is weighted , the ensemble is dominated by increasingly denser states for which the pivot algorithm becomes ineffective .",
    "second , the ensemble becomes increasingly populated by knotted states , thus it becomes hard to sample effectively .    instead , in this section we solve the model ( [ eq : sauk_z-1 ] ) via simulations with the wang - landau algorithm ( wla ) @xcite using a local move set that preserves the knot type .",
    "in this section , we use @xmath209 , which is an integer for a sap on the sc lattice .",
    "we use a parallel version of the wla as discussed for example in @xcite , but with a maximum of merely eight parallel threads .",
    "we initialize an unknotted , rooted sap on the positive half - space of the sc lattice and generate new states using the pull - moves @xcite ( excluding the end - move ) .",
    "the pull - moves certainly preserve the knot type of the sap , however in contrast to the case of the saw , to our knowledge , it is not proven that the pull moves are ergodic within the knot type .",
    "for some simulations we also used kink transport between random positions .",
    "suppose the current state is @xmath17 , then we obtain a state @xmath210 by applying a move to @xmath17 . in order to determine the writhe of @xmath210",
    ", we rely on the formula  ( [ eq : wr_sc_writhe_twist_formula ] ) .",
    "therefore , we need to determine the linking number of the sauk @xmath17 with the pushed off unknot @xmath211 . the linking number can be determined by considering the signed crossing in a projection .",
    "suppose we project the sauk into the @xmath212-@xmath87 plane , then all crossings will occur at potential crossing points of the form @xmath213 , @xmath214 .",
    "therefore , every time a bond is added , the two potential crossing points are determined and the bonds are linked to these crossing points via pointers .",
    "when there are already bonds linked to the crossing point , we cycle through all perpendicular bonds ( that correspond to the pushed off curve or vice versa ) and compute the sum of signed crossing that the new bond produces with all the bonds that have already been linked .",
    "this corresponds to the change in linking number .",
    "the same procedure is performed once a bond is removed .",
    "this time however , the linking number changes by the negative of the sum of signed crossings produced by the bond .",
    "this algorithm was inspired by @xcite .    in order to determine the extension ( [ eq : wl_h-1 ] ) , we keep a list of integer @xmath215 $ ] , which count the number of vertices in the plane @xmath216",
