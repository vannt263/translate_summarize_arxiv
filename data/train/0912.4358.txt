    "nowadays , in condensed matter physics and semiconductor microelectronics , two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron system is one of the main objects of detailed study . such a system is formed by , e.g. , surface - state electrons or electrons in semiconductor heterostructures .",
    "phenomenon that is observed in such systems and makes them of great interest , especially in context of spintronic applications , is spin - orbit interaction ( soi ) .",
    "this interaction arise from the structure inversion asymmetry of potential confining the electron system in directions perpendicular to the confinement plane ( the rashba spin - orbit interaction@xcite ) and the bulk inversion asymmetry that is present in semiconductor heterostructures based on materials with a zinc - blende structure ( the dresselhaus spin - orbit interaction@xcite ) .",
    "the dresselhaus interaction depends on semiconductor material and growth geometry , whereas the interaction strength of the rashba soi can be tuned via an externally applied electric field perpendicular to the confinement plane.@xcite as a result , one can controllably manipulate the spin in devices without recourse to an external magnetic field.@xcite .    in order to efficiently exploit the mentioned phenomenon , a theoretical study of dynamics of electrons and holes in the 2d spin - orbit coupled electron systems",
    "is needed .",
    "the most discussed and studied processes concerning this problem are spin relaxation and spin dephasing.@xcite however , to our knowledge , such crucial quasiparticle property as the lifetime caused by inelastic electron - electron scattering remains still insufficiently studied .",
    "to all appearance the first attempt to analyze what effect the soi has on the quasiparticle lifetime has been made in ref .  .",
    "in the work cited , a particular case of the 2d electron gas ( 2deg ) with the rashba soi was considered at the limit of @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the fermi energy and @xmath3 with @xmath4 and @xmath5 being the interaction strength and the effective electron mass , respectively ( unless stated otherwise , atomic units are used throughout , i.e. , @xmath6 . ) . within the @xmath0 approximation , it has been shown that in a small vicinity of @xmath2 a modification of the lifetime due to the soi is insignificant and does not depend on the subband index of the spin - orbit split band . to go beyond the limits of ref .  , in ref .",
    "the inelastic lifetime ( decay rate ) of quasiparticles in the 2deg with the rashba soi has been studied within a wide energy region . for material parameters typical for in@xmath7ga@xmath8as 2degs , it has been revealed that modifications induced by the soi and the dependence on the subband index become noticeable , when the decay channel due to plasmon emission appears .",
    "the first joint theoretical and experimental investigation of hole lifetimes in a 2d spin - orbit coupled electron system has been done in ref .  .",
    "in addition to a demonstration of the weak influence of the soi on hole lifetimes by the case of the au(111 ) surface state , a hypothetical system , where the soi can have a profound effect , has been considered .    in this work",
    ", we generalize the results on effect of the soi on the quasiparticle lifetime . within the @xmath0 approach with the screened interaction @xmath9 evaluated in the random phase approximation ( rpa ) , we study the inelastic decay rate of quasiparticles in a 2deg with the rashba and dresselhaus interactions linear in @xmath10magnitude of the electron 2d momentum @xmath11 . in our @xmath0-calculations ,",
    "material parameters suitable for inas quantum wells are taken .",
    "we compare the inelastic decay rates calculated at different ratios between the interaction strengths of the mentioned spin - orbit interactions .",
    "we show that on the energy scale , for the taken material parameters , the main visible effect induced by the soi is modifications of the plasmon - emission decay channel via the extension of the landau damping region .",
    "we also consider a hypothetical small - density case , when in the 2d spin - orbit coupled electron system the fermi level is close to the band energy at @xmath12 .",
    "for such a system , we predict strong subband - index dependence and anisotropy of the inelastic decay rate for electrons and appearance of a plasmon decay channel for holes .",
    "and @xmath13 determining the spin - quantization axis with polar angles @xmath14 and @xmath15 and the rotation axis , respectively . ]",
    "we consider a 2deg described by the hamiltonian @xmath16 with @xmath17 and the spin - orbit contribution @xmath18 that includes both rashba and dresselhaus terms .",
    "the latter is written with the assumption that a quantum well grown in [ 001 ] direction is considered . in eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonian ] ) , @xmath19 are the electron momenta along the [ 100 ] and [ 010 ] cubic axes of the crystal , respectively , @xmath20 are the pauli matrices , @xmath5 is the effective electron mass , @xmath4 and @xmath21 are the interaction strengths for the rashba and dresselhaus spin - orbit interactions . to bring the hamiltonian to a diagonal form",
    ", we perform the rotation in spin space generated by @xmath22 $ ] dependent on the momentum @xmath11 .",
    "the rotation is performed with the angle @xmath14 around the axis determined by @xmath23 . a positional relationship of the axis @xmath23 and the spin - quantization axis @xmath24 is shown in fig .  [ fig1 ] .",
    "we suppose that we deal with the in - plane spin polarization , i.e. , @xmath25 . in the new , unitary transformed , spin basis",
    "the spin - orbit contribution has the form@xcite @xmath26\\sigma_{z},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the angle @xmath15 is related to the polar angle @xmath27 of the momentum @xmath11 as @xmath28 due to the diagonal form of @xmath29 , the energy bands are simply given by@xcite @xmath30\\ ] ] and correspond to the wave functions @xmath31 with the subband index @xmath32 , where @xmath33 are the spin components in the new spin basis .",
    "this means that for the initial , untransformed , hamiltonian we have the following eigenstates @xmath34 .",
    "the spin orientation in @xmath11 space reads as ( see fig .  [ fig2 ] )",
    "@xmath35 note that the case with @xmath36 and @xmath37 ( pure rashba ) is characterized by the angle @xmath38 , whereas in the situation with @xmath39 and @xmath40 ( pure dresselhaus ) one has @xmath41 . in the special case of @xmath42 ,",
    "the angle @xmath43 does not depend on @xmath27 .",
    "the inelastic decay rate ( inverse lifetime @xmath44 caused by inelastic electron - electron scattering ) is determined by the imaginary part of the matrix elements of the quasiparticle self - energy @xmath45 at the energy @xmath46 as @xmath47 . at the hartree - fock ( hf ) mean - field level ,",
    "these elements are totally real and have the form @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the bare coulomb interaction with @xmath50 being the static dielectric constant .",
    "the factors @xmath51/2 $ ] come from @xmath52 and @xmath53 is the fermi factor .",
    "such a form ( [ hf_sigma ] ) is similar to the exchange contribution to the single - particle energies considered in refs .   in the pure rashba case .",
    "however , in order to examine quasiparticle lifetimes , one has to go beyond the hf approximation .",
    "the simplest variant is the @xmath0 approximation ( for details about the approximation , we refer the reader to refs . and ) .",
    "within such an approximation , we arrive at the following expression for the imaginary part of the mentioned matrix elements @xmath54 when @xmath55 , and @xmath56\\\\ & \\times&\\mathrm{im}w^0(\\mathbf{k}-\\mathbf{q},\\omega - e_{\\mathbf{q}s'})\\theta(\\omega - e_{\\mathbf{q}s'}),\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] when @xmath57 . in these equations",
    ", @xmath58 is the step function and the screened interaction @xmath59^{-1}\\ ] ] is defined by the rpa irreducible polarizability ( see also refs .   and , where the retarded part of @xmath60 was examined ) @xmath61",
    "using the example of an inas quantum well , we take the effective mass @xmath62 ( see , e.g. , ref .  ) and the static dielectric constant @xmath63 ( see , e.g. , ref .  ) .",
    "the interaction strength of the dresselhaus soi is chosen to be @xmath64 evm to simulate a quite narrow quantum well.@xcite at the ratio @xmath65 ( see , e.g. , ref .  )",
    ", we have the rashba interaction strength @xmath66 evm .",
    "the electron density is put at @xmath67 @xmath68 that corresponds to the fermi energy @xmath69 mev .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows our results on the inelastic decay rate @xmath70 obtained with the material parameters listed above .",
    "two main points caused by the spin - orbit splitting of the band make the considered 2deg different from that without the soi .",
    "these are an angle - dependent relative shift of @xmath71 and @xmath72 on the momentum scale and some smoothing of sharp forms of the peak caused by opening of the plasmon decay channel .",
    "the former reflects the fact that subbands of the split band reach the same energy at different momenta , while the latter originates from the extension of the landau damping region ( the region where plasmons decay into single - particle excitations@xcite ) due to appearance of inter - subband transitions ( for a detailed discussion of the screening properties of the 2deg with the soi we refer the reader to refs .   and )",
    "this extension varying with the polar angle @xmath27 leads to a nonzero plasmon linewidth , when the plasmon spectrum enters into the soi - induced damping region .    in order to show what effect the soi has on the inelastic decay rate for different subbands , in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , by setting up a correspondence between @xmath70 and @xmath73 via the momentum @xmath11 , we plot the decay rate as a function of energy . on first glance , it may seem that we have an ordinary energy dependence of the decay rate as in a 2deg without the soi : the quadratic behavior with the logarithmic enhancement in the vicinity of the fermi energy with @xmath74 at @xmath2 and the jump above the fermi energy , which is caused by opening the plasmon decay channel for excited electrons.@xcite however , on examining the energy dependence of @xmath75 in detail , we can say that due to the finite plasmon linewidth the plasmon decay channel manifests itself at lower energies , when it occurs in a 2deg without the soi .",
    "the same reason leads to reduction in the jump .",
    "also , we can reveal distinctions between @xmath71 and @xmath72 , which become noticeable , when the plasmon - emission decay channel appears , and increase upon moving from @xmath76 to @xmath77 .",
    "an analysis of the inelastic mean - free path ( imfp ) @xmath78 as a function of energy has shown that , as a consequence of the distinctions between @xmath71 and @xmath72 , the imfp of electrons can vary with the subband index .",
    "for example , at @xmath79 for electrons this variation can reach , e.g. , @xmath80% .",
    "the obtained results can be understood by inspecting constant - energy contours shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] with mental drawing of possible transitions selected by the factors @xmath81 of eqs .",
    "( [ me_sigma_im_below_ef ] ) and ( [ me_sigma_im_above_ef ] ) at a given @xmath27 ( see also ref .  ) . actually , for each subband ( @xmath82 ) one has a set of intra- and inter - subband transition momenta as arguments of @xmath83 . for the chosen material parameters and for @xmath76 ,",
    "these momenta do not vary considerably with the subband index @xmath84 . for @xmath79 differences in both intra- and inter - subband",
    "transitions for @xmath85 and @xmath86 become already sensible for values of @xmath83 , especially in the vicinity of plasmon peaks of the latter .    now , remaining @xmath5 , @xmath50 , @xmath87 , and @xmath2 unchanged , we consider the case of @xmath88 [ @xmath89 evm ] and the pure dresselhaus ( rashba ) case [ @xmath90 evm and @xmath91 . the case of equal interaction strengths , when the rashba and dresselhaus interactions can cancel each other , is distinguished by various significant effects reported in the literature ( see , e.g. , refs .  ) . in this case , one has the 2d electron system with two uncoupled spin components ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) , each of which demonstrates the properties peculiar to a 2deg without the soi.@xcite our results@xcite on the inelastic decay rate at @xmath88 are shown in fig .",
    "the sharp edges of the plasmon contribution are evidence of the fact that there is no modifications of the landau damping region induced by the soi . as is seen from the inset of the figure , due to the shifting property @xmath92 , where @xmath93 , the @xmath71 and @xmath72 curves coincide and have the form of that in a 2deg without the soi .    in the pure rashba or pure dresselhaus cases ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) , the resulting @xmath75 does not tell the difference between spin orientations in the momentum plane , which correspond to the rashba or dresselhaus soi ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) . as well as before",
    ", we have the relative shift ( but angle - independent ) on the momentum scale and main modifications induced by the soi in the energy region , where a quasiparticle can decay into plasmons .",
    "all the considered cases meet the condition of @xmath94 , where @xmath95 is the measure of influence of the soi on the band structure .",
    "however , as is partly discussed in ref .",
    ", in two - dimensional electron systems with much greater @xmath96 as compared to @xmath2 the inelastic decay rate can substantially differ from that in the 2deg without the soi .",
    "a striking example of such a system is that formed by surface - state electrons in ordered surface alloys,@xcite which are very promising materials for spintronics applications . in order to predict how the inelastic decay rate can behave in a system , where @xmath97 , we consider the hypothetical case with the unchanged @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 evm , but with @xmath98 evm ( @xmath99 ) and @xmath100 @xmath68 , which give @xmath101 mev and @xmath102 mev .",
    "the obtained results are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] .",
    "the main feature we would like to note first is that for holes the decay rate @xmath72 as a function of @xmath10 has an `` outgrowth '' at @xmath103 , where @xmath104^{1/2}$ ]  the momentum , at which @xmath105 has a minimum . a close analysis of the imaginary part of the screened interaction @xmath9 and the region of integration in eq .  ( [ me_sigma_im_below_ef ] ) has shown that the outgrowth is caused by opening of the plasmon decay channel for transitions between the @xmath86 and @xmath106 subbands .",
    "it is important that in a 2deg without the soi such a channel is impossible for holes.@xcite    as is evident from the figure , in this case on the energy scale we have a strong anisotropy of the inelastic decay rate .",
    "also the presented curves clearly demonstrate that the latter depends strongly on the subband index @xmath84 of the spin - orbit split band . keeping in mind that the index @xmath84 distinguishes spin components",
    ", we can say that the subband - index dependence reflects a spin asymmetry of the inelastic decay rate @xmath107 for a given direction .",
    "the asymmetry shows its worth most brightly in the @xmath79 direction .",
    "in fact , in that very direction there are significant distinctions in @xmath72 and @xmath71 as functions of the exciting energy and , as a consequence , in the corresponding imfp for electrons .",
    "for instance , the ratio @xmath107 is about 3 at @xmath108 mev and about 2 at @xmath109 mev . at",
    "further increasing of energy , the ratio continues to decrease .",
    "note that the imfp spin asymmetry makes a basis of the spin filter effect observed in hot electron transport through a ferromagnetic ( see , e.g. , refs .   and ) . in the considered case of the quantum",
    "well , the spin asymmetry is not such big as in ferromagnetics ( see , e.g. , ref .  ) , but , as distinct from the latters , values of the imfp spin symmetry depend strongly on direction and can be tuned by external electric field .",
    "in conclusion , we have presented a study of the inelastic decay rate of quasiparticles in a two - dimensional electron gas with the @xmath10-linear spin - orbit interaction that includes both rashba ( interaction strength @xmath4 ) and dresselhaus ( interaction strength @xmath21 ) contributions . in this study ,",
    "the electron gas is characterized by material parameters suitable for [ 001]-grown inas quantum wells .",
    "we have considered the cases of @xmath110 , @xmath42 , @xmath40 ( @xmath111 ) , and @xmath37 ( @xmath112 ) .",
    "the cases meet the condition of @xmath94 , where @xmath95 is the measure of influence of the spin - orbit interaction on the band structure .",
    "as compared to a two - dimensional electron gas without the spin - orbit interaction , we have revealed a relative shift of the inelastic decay rates for different subbands of the spin - orbit split band on the momentum scale . also , except for the case of equal interaction strengths , we have found a some smoothing of sharp forms of the peak concerned with opening of the plasmon decay channel for electrons .",
    "we have shown that , on the energy scale , in this very region distinctions between the decay rates for different subbands become noticeable .",
    "these distinctions depend on the polar angle @xmath27 and cause the inelastic mean free path to be angle- and subband - dependent . as to the case of @xmath42 , due to the shifting property",
    ", the decay rate as a function of energy has the form of that in a two - dimensional electron gas without the spin - orbit interaction .    in order to predict how the inelastic decay rate can behave in a system , where @xmath97 , we have considered the hypothetical case of small electron density .",
    "we have revealed that in such a system the decay rate demonstrates strong anisotropy and subband dependence within all the considered interval of momenta and exciting energies .",
    "since the subband dependence can be interpreted as a spin asymmetry of the decay rate in a given direction of @xmath11 , one can expect the spin - filter effect driven by externally applied electric field .",
    "also , we have found that in the system with @xmath97 holes can decay into plasmons , what is impossible in a two - dimensional electron gas without the spin - orbit interaction .",
