    "application of light is a powerful method to change material properties . for example",
    ", light can induce currents through mechanisms such as photovoltaic effect@xcite , photo - thermoelectric effect@xcite , and photo - drag effects@xcite . moreover",
    ", light can change the response of materials and induce insulator to metal transitions@xcite or change the characteristics of @xmath0 junctions@xcite .    in recent years",
    ", there has been tremendous developments and interests in the induction of quantum phases through light applications .",
    "for example , experiments have demonstrated that superconductivity can be induced through infrared pulses in high - temperature cuprate superconductors@xcite .",
    "inductions of quantum phases are inherently non - equilibrium phenomena , and thus their understanding is quite challenging .",
    "even some basic questions such as the physical signatures of the induced phases and how such phases can be stabilized in a steady state do not have answers yet .",
    "many of quantum phases manifest themselves through transport , and therefore , understanding of transport properties in non - equilibrium , open systems is crucial for experimental verifications of such induction of quantum phases under the application of light . in this paper , we develop a general formalism for studying non - equilibrium transport under the application of light , and , using the formalism , address the possibilities of the induction of topological properties through light .    motivated by recent rapid development of the understanding in topological phases , the possibility of inducing topological phases such as integer quantum hall phase and topological insulators through light has been theoretically explored by many different groups@xcite . generally speaking ,",
    "the application of light on electron systems has two important physical effects ; 1 .",
    "photon - dressing of band structures through the mixing of different bands 2 .",
    "redistribution of electron occupation numbers through the absorptions / emissions of photons leading to non - equilibrium distributions .",
    "previous works proposed optical induction of band structures with topological properties @xcite , and thus have mostly focused on the analysis of the first effect . on the other hand ,",
    "most of these works do not address the question of the second effect , the redistribution of electrons in the band structure , and thus its physics is yet poorly understood .",
    "topological properties only appear when certain bands are fully filled , and it is not clear how this band occupation can be achieved and topological properties survive when the system is strongly driven out of equilibrium by the application of light .    in order to answer these questions , we study the physical consequence of the application of light through dc many - terminal transport measurements as in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] .",
    "the coupling of the driven systems with leads , that are in return coupled with equilibrium reservoirs , plays the crucial role to determine the occupations of electrons . using the formalism for transport properties in periodically driven systems developed by various groups@xcite , here we study topological transport phenomena in materials such as graphene and three dimensional topological insulators .",
    "first of all , we show that non - equilibrium transport properties can not generally be captured by the photon - dressed , effective band structures .",
    "in particular , in addition to the usual transport through such static effective band structures , there are contributions from photon assisted electron conductions . _",
    "thus , the induction of topologically non - trivial band structures does not immediately imply the topological properties of the non - equilibrium systems .",
    "_    on the other hand , the regime exists in which topological band structures can manifest themselves ; we explicitly demonstrate that for _ off - resonant _ light where electrons can not directly absorb photons , the transport properties of the non - equilibrium systems attached to the leads are well approximated by the transport properties of the system described by the _",
    "static _ effective hamiltonian that incorporates the virtual photon absorption processes .",
    "in particular , the occupations of the electrons under this situation are close to the filling of the photon - dressed bands . as examples ,",
    "we show that the transport properties under the application of off - resonant light is given by the photon - dressed hamiltonian corresponding to a quantum hall insulator without landau levels@xcite in the case of graphene , and to a gapped insulator with anomalous quantum hall effects and magneto - electric response described by axion electrodynamics@xcite at the surfaces of three dimensional topological insulators . in these systems ,",
    "the measurements in six - terminal configurations in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] lead to the near quantization of hall conductance .",
    "thus , the application of off - resonant circularly polarized light leads to an intriguing `` hall '' effects _ without applying a static magnetic field_.    this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : summary ] , we describe the summary of the results , focusing on the analysis of graphene and three dimensional topological insulators under the application of off - resonant light . here",
    "we provide the physical and intuitive explanations of the phenomenon of light - induced quantum hall effects and refer to later sections for many important details . in section  [ sec : formalism ] , we develop the formalism for studying the non - equilibrium transport properties under periodical drives in many - terminal measurements .",
    "our formalism is based on the extension of the multi - probe bttiker - landauer formula@xcite to periodically driven systems , a `` floquet landauer formula . ''",
    "we provide two distinct ways to calculate the transmission amplitudes in the driven systems . first method expresses the results in terms of the floquet states and it illuminates the physical origin of the photon - assisted transport .",
    "second method takes advantage of `` floquet dyson s equation '' to give an elegant solution which is more convenient for numerical solution@xcite . by taking the off - resonant limit of these solutions ,",
    "the equivalence of transport properties under the application of light and those with effective photon - dresseed hamiltonian is established .",
    "most of the analysis in this paper assumes the absence of interactions among electrons as well as electron - phonon interactions .",
    "we argue in section  [ sec : interaction ] that , in the case of graphene and topological insulators under the off - resonant light , the results given in section  [ sec : summary ] are robust against these interaction effects at low temperatures .",
    "while the measurements of transport properties require the attachment of leads , the probe of the effective gap induced by light is plausible even in an isolated system .",
    "we propose in section  [ sec : pumpprobe ] such measurements through the adiabatic preparation of non - equilibrium systems combined with the transmission of probe laser with small frequencies .",
    "the essential ingredients in the arguments of section  [ sec : interaction ] and section  [ sec : pumpprobe ] are the extensions of adiabatic theorem and fermi golden rule to periodically driven systems and floquet states , dubbed as `` floquet adiabatic theorem '' and `` floquet fermi golden rule . ''",
    "we give the detailed proof of these important statements in the appendix . in section  [ sec : conclusion ] , we conclude with possible extensions of this work .",
    "here we consider graphene as an example of semi - metals and study the change in the transport properties under the application of light .",
    "we model graphene by a hexagonal tight - binding model with two @xmath1-bands , where we first neglect the electron - electron as well as electron - phonon interactions . in section",
    "[ sec : interaction ] , we discuss the effects of these interactions and argue that they do not change the qualitative results of the analysis .",
    "we consider the application of circularly polarized light perpendicular to the plane of graphene . for concreteness",
    ", here we represent the rotating electric field due to light as a time - dependent vector potential @xmath2 with @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the frequency of light . plus",
    "sign is for right circulation of light and minus sign for left circulation .",
    "the light intensity is characterized by the dimensionless number @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the electron charge and @xmath7 is the lattice constant of graphene . for intensity of lasers and pulses available in the frequency regime of our interests @xmath8thz",
    ", @xmath9 is typically less than @xmath10 . in this gauge ,",
    "electrons accumulate phases as they hop in the lattice ; @xmath11 where @xmath12 with @xmath13 being the coordinates of the lattice site @xmath14 , @xmath15 is the hopping amplitude of electrons , and @xmath16 are spins of electrons . for simplicity , we only consider the orbital effect of electromagnetic fields on electrons , and disregard the small zeeman effect .",
    "the inclusion of the zeeman effect is straightforward . in this limit , spins trivially double the hilbert space and thus we suppress the spin indices in the following .",
    "when the light frequency is off - resonant for any electron transitions , light does not directly excite electrons and instead , effectively modifies the electron band structures through virtual photon absorption processes .",
    "such off - resonant condition is satisfied for the frequency @xmath17 in our model with @xmath1-bands .",
    "more general case of on - resonant light can be analyzed through the formalism developed in later section section  [ sec : formalism ] .",

    "the effect of virtual photon absorptions at the degenerate dirac points is to open a gap with magnitude @xmath39 . in fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] , we illustrate the opening of the gap near one of the dirac points upon the application of light for both infinite and finite systems .",

    "as a result of non - zero chern number of the bands , @xmath18 shows the existence of gapless chiral edge states , colored as blue and green , corresponding to the edge state in the upper and lower edge , respectively .",

    "[ ] , we show above ( also see section  [ sec : effective ] ) that the virtual photon absorption and emission process represented by the second term of eq .",
    "( [ heff ] ) induces a gap at the dirac point and leads to a non - zero chern number .",
    "such photon - dressing , which was neglected in the study of ref .",

    "the main focus of this paper , however , is the study of the manifestations of the gapped hamiltonian @xmath18 in many - terminal transport measurements depicted in fig .",

    "[ figure1]@xcite .",
    "the non - equilibrium transport properties of mesoscopic , periodically driven systems in this configuration have been studied previously , using floquet theory@xcite combined with the keldysh formalism @xcite .",

    "the pump current @xmath62 is zero for inversion symmetric geometries , so we focus on the properties of the response current @xmath64 in the following .",
    "the transmission coefficients @xmath65 in eq .",
    "( [ resdccurrent ] ) represent the transmission of electrons with energy @xmath66 from lead @xmath67 to @xmath58 during which electrons absorb ( emit ) @xmath68 photons as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ landauer ] .",
    "thus , the response conduction in the presence of periodic drive can be seen as an extension of the static conduction , where the transmission can now happen with the absorptions / emissions of photons .",
    "we note that the expression of dc current in eq .",
    "( [ resdccurrent ] ) is valid for arbitrary strength and frequency of the drives .",
    "the transmission probabilities @xmath65 can be efficiently computed by dressing the propagators with photon absorptions / emissions@xcite , and will be described in section  [ sec : formalism ] .",
    "we emphasize that the response current is generally the sum of the contributions from @xmath68 photon absorption / emission processes ( see eq .  ( [ resdccurrent ] ) ) and thus its transport property can not be described by _ any _ static hamiltonians .",
    "the off - resonant case described below is an exceptionally simple case in this respect .",
    "we employ this floquet - landauer formalism to study the off - resonant , large frequency regime @xmath69 with weak intensity of light , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath26 . in this regime ,",
    "absorptions or emissions of photons are suppressed by @xmath70 , and the transmission coefficients @xmath65 with @xmath71 is small and of the order of @xmath72 .",
    "on the other hand , the zero - photon absorption / emission transmission coefficient @xmath73 is modified due to virtual photon processes .",
    "such modifications are included in @xmath18 and the transmission probability is given by @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the transmission probability of the static system described by @xmath18 .",
    "these results will be rigorously established in section  [ sec : formalism ] .",
    "this correspondence demonstrates , under our assumptions , that graphene under the application of off - resonant light behaves as an insulator with gap @xmath39 with hall conductance quantized at @xmath76 with possible corrections up to the order of @xmath72 . here",
    "the factor of @xmath77 comes from spin degrees of freedom . while we established the results in the perturbation theory on @xmath9 , it is possible to analytically confirm the insulating behavior for all orders in @xmath9 for weak contact couplings with leads(see section  [ sec : formalism ] ) .",
    "we emphasize that although the effective hamiltonian is perturbative in @xmath9 , the hall conductance at zero temperature is non - perturbative : an infinitesimal gap @xmath55 is sufficient to yield a topological band with non - zero chern number .",
    "a distinct feature of this light - induced hall effect above is that the hall conductance switches its sign under the change of circulations of light polarization .",
    "this can be easily checked for the geometry of the system which is symmetric under @xmath78 , under which the circulation of light reverses .",
    "such reversal of hall current can be used in the experiments to distinguish this light - polarization _ dependent _ current from light - polarization _ independent _ current , which could originate from mechanisms we did not consider in this paper .",
    "we briefly describe the requirements to observe the proposed phenomena with off - resonant light in graphene .",
    "the band width of graphene in the @xmath1 orbital is given by @xmath79 where @xmath80ev , placing the required frequency of off - resonant light to be soft x - ray regime with @xmath81thz .",
    "for this frequency of light , the gap of the system @xmath55 can reach @xmath82k for the strong light intensity @xmath83w/@xmath84@xcite which gives @xmath85 , where we expect the hall conductance to be quantized with possible correction of @xmath10% of @xmath76 . in reality , even such high frequency of light is expected to be absorbed in graphene .",
    "such direct electron excitations lead to reconfiguration of electron occupation numbers , which modifies the hall conductance from its quantized values .",
    "the analysis of graphene above can be directly extended to three dimensional topological insulators such as @xmath86 .",
    "the low energy description of electrons on surfaces of  @xmath86 is given by two dimensional dirac fermions@xcite , and is described by the hamiltonian @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the velocity of the dirac fermion , and @xmath33 are pauli matrices corresponding to two bands near the dirac point .",
    "as before , we assume the application of weak , off - resonant , circularly polarized light .",
    "the orbital effect of the light is taken into account through the replacement @xmath89 . at the dirac cone",
    ", the virtual photon process again opens a gap and the effective hamiltonian is ( see eq .",
    "( [ heff ] ) ) @xmath90 where @xmath91 corresponds to the gap due to right(left ) circularly polarized light .",
    "the consequences of the gap coming from the third term in eq .",
    "( [ heffti ] ) are extensively investigated in ref [ ] . just as in the case of graphene , the induced insulator is topologically non - trivial , and expected to result in anomalous quantum hall effect with hall conductance @xmath92 with possible corrections up to the order of @xmath72 . here",
    "we propose to probe the unique magneto - electric response of the gapped topological insulator through pump - probe type measurements , where circularly polarized light is used to open a gap at the dirac point and linearly polarized light with small frequency within the gap is used to probe the faraday / kerr rotations@xcite , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ figure3 ] a ) ( also see section  [ sec : pumpprobe ] ) . unlike other schemes proposed previously with ferromagnetic layers , here",
    "the faraday / kerr rotations can only result from the topological insulators and they give unambiguous signature of magneto - electric effects . in a similar fashion , the existence of magnetic monopoles can be probed by placing an electric charge near the surface of the topological insulator in the presence of circularly polarized light ( see fig .  [ figure3 ] b ) ) .      in the analysis of graphene and topological insulators",
    "above , we assumed the off - resonance of light for entire bands , but the gap in the effective hamiltonian opens whenever the light is off - resonant near the dirac points , which requires much less stringent condition on the light frequency .",
    "however when inter - band electronic transitions occur due to photon absorptions , subsequent relaxation processes are expected to change the electron occupation numbers in the steady state , and modify hall conductance away from quantized values .",
    "thus in the case of on - resonant light , the system is expected to display non - quantized hall effects without magnetic fields .",
    "moreover , as we show in section  [ sec : formalism ] , the application of on - resonant light leads to the photo - assisted conductance and the resulting non - equilibrium transport property can no longer simply be described by the static effective hamiltonian .",
    "the transport under the on - resonant light contains rich physics in itself , and it will be studied in the future works . on the other hand , it is possible to achieve the off - resonance with small frequency of light in , for example , the gapped systems such as boron - nitride by applying the sub - gap frequency of light .",
    "many of these possible extensions can be studied through the formalism developed in the following sections .",
    "the understanding and formalism obtained in this paper is likely to guide future searches for the optimal systems to study photo - driven quantum hall effects without magnetic field .",

    "( [ greeneom ] ) , which is valid for a certain class of periodic drive including the application of circularly polarized light .",
    "this solution is derived by writing `` floquet dyson s equation , '' and has the advantage of being numerically efficient .",
    "again , by taking the off - resonant , weak intensity limit of this solution , we arrive the result reported in section  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "the `` stationary states '' of the schrdinger equation for periodically driven systems are the states which return to themselves after one period of time , @xmath120 , with possible phase accumulations .",
    "these so - called floquet states are the eigenstates of the evolution operator over one period , and thus also eigenstates of effective hamiltonian @xmath18 defined in eq .",
    "( [ defeff ] ) .",

    "if the chemical potential lies at the dirac point before the application of light , the result above implies that the adiabatic increase of the intensity of light @xmath269 can be used to prepare the system close to the filled lower band state of @xmath18 . at exactly the dirac points where the spectrum becomes degenerate ,",
    "the adiabatic theorem above does not apply , but these points represent only a tiny portion of the total states , and thus can be ignored for the calculations of physical quantities .",
    "when the initial system is at finite temperature , such adiabatic increase of @xmath269 leads to _ non - thermal _ distributions of electrons in the spectrum of @xmath18 , but nonetheless the resulting density matrix can be calculated through the result eq .",
