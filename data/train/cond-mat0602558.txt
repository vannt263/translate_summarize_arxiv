    "granular gases consist of particles that undergo dissipative collisions , making them a paradigm of non - equilibrium statistical mechanics @xcite . the absence of microscopic reversibility ( in each collision , kinetic energy is lost ) and the contraction of the phase space volume lead to specific properties which differ from elastically colliding thermal systems .",
    "these include non - gaussian statistics , modified hydrodynamics , and absence of equipartition @xcite .    compared to equilibrium ,",
    "our knowledge of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics is still incomplete , and exact results are rare . in this paper",
    ", we consider a one - dimensional model of a tracer particle that undergoes dissipative collisions with particles of a thermalized bath .",
    "the kinetic description is provided by the boltzmann equation .",
    "we show that when the mass ratio of the tracer to a bath particle , @xmath2 , is equal to the coefficient of restitution @xmath3 , there exists a mapping with the boltzmann equation of identical elastic hard rods , the solution of which was derived almost thirty years ago @xcite .",
    "we propose here a simpler way of solving the boltzmann equation and we discuss the results in the context of our model , i.e. a granular particle in a thermalized bath . in addition , we obtain the velocity autocorrelation function as well as the diffusion coefficient .",
    "numerical simulations of the boltzmann equation show that the qualitative kinetic features are not strongly dependent on the value of the coefficient of restitution , implying that the exact solution provides the characteristics of the system also when @xmath5 , where an analytic solution is not available .",
    "we consider a one - dimensional gas of identical hard rods of mass @xmath1 into which one inserts a granular hard rod of mass @xmath0@xcite .",
    "particles have hard core interactions and collisions between bath particles are elastic .",
    "but , collisions between the tracer particle and the bath particles are assumed inelastic and characterized by a coefficient of restitution , @xmath6 .",
    "in addition , we assume that a stationary , gaussian velocity distribution is imposed on the bath particles , compensating for the kinetic energy lost during collisions with the tracer particle .    for each collision , momentum is conserved so that for a collision between a bath particle and the tracer particle , one has @xmath7 where the upper - case velocity corresponds to the tracer particle and the lower - case velocity to the bath particle , and the asterisks denote post - collisional quantities . at the moment of impact , the relative velocity changes sign and shrinks ( for @xmath8 ) according to the collision rule @xmath9 by combining eqs.([eq:1 ] ) and ( [ eq:2 ] ) , the velocities of colliding particles after collision are given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 .",

    "( [ eq:5 ] ) , although linear in the case of a tracer particle , has not yet been solved exacty .",
    "exact solutions have , however , been found in the framework of the inelastic maxwell model where the collision frequency , which occurs in the boltzmann collisional term , is assumed independent of the relative velocity @xcite .",
    "the first objective of this paper is to show that an exact solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq:5 ] ) can be obtained when the coefficient of restitution equals the mass ratio of the tracer to a bath particle , @xmath23 . in this case , the boltzmann equation for the distribution of the granular tracer particle turns out to be mathematically identical to the boltzmann equation describing a tagged elastic particle in a thermalized bath of mechanically identical particles .",
    "this fact , shown below , opens the way to an exact solution .",
    "however , the physical situations are totally different : evolution of a dissipative system towards a stationary state in one case and evolution of a conservative system towards thermal equilibrium in the other .",
    "the differences between the two systems on the level of the microscopic dynamics are illustrated by the collision rules .",
    "for the elastic system with identical masses , a binary collision leads to the exchange of particle velocities , @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "moreover , for the inverse collision one finds @xmath26 and @xmath27 , which is related to the microscopic reversibility . for the granular tracer particle of mass @xmath28 in a thermalized bath of particles of mass @xmath1 ,",
