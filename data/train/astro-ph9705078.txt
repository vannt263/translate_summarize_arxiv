    "several disk galaxies have been observed to contain counterrotating stars , including ngc 3593 ( bertola et al .",
    "1996 ) ; ngc 4138 ( jore , et al .",
    "1996 ) , ( thakar , et al . , 1996 ) ;",
    "ngc 4550 ( rubin , et al .",
    "1992 ) , ( rix et al . 1992 ) ; ngc 7217 ( merrifield & kuijen 1994 ) ; and ngc 7331 ( prada , et al .",
    "the observed mass fraction in counterrotating stars is remarkably high , ranging from @xmath4 to @xmath5 .",
    "lovelace , jore , and haynes ( 1997 ) ( hereafter ljh ) developed a theory of the two - stream instability in flat counter - rotating galaxies .",
    "the basic instability is similar to that found in counterstreaming plasmas ( e.g. , krall & trivelpiece 1973 ) .",
    "ljh made several predictions , most notably that the presence of stars orbiting in both directions around the disk should create a strong instability of the @xmath6 ( one - arm ) spiral waves ; that the @xmath6 wave with the strongest amplification is usually the leading spiral arm with respect to the dominant component ; and that the spiral wave is stationary when there are equal co- and counterrotating components .",
    "the two - stream instablity may have been observed in earlier computer simulations which found @xmath6 spiral waves in counterrotating disks ( sellwood & merritt 1994 ; sellwood & valluri 1997 ; howard et al .",
    "1997 ) ; however the characterization the instability was very limited and tightly wrapped spiral waves were not observed .",
    "it is of interest that @xmath6 perturbations in spiral disks are rather common ( rix & zaritsky 1995 ; zaritsky & rix 1997 ) . in some cases these may arise from counterrotating material .",
    "we present here the results of three runs of our galaxy code ( schroeder & comins 1989 ; schroeder 1989 ; shorey 1996 ) , each with different fractions of the stars initially in counterrotating orbits .",
    "the runs had @xmath2 , @xmath7 , and @xmath3 counterrotating particles . in the notation of ljh",
    ", this corresponds to runs with @xmath8 , 0.375 , and 0.50 , respectively .",
    "each run had a total of 100,000 collisionless , equal - mass particles embedded in a halo containing @xmath9 of the total mass of the system .",
    "this halo mass is used to help suppress the ubiquitous @xmath10 `` bar - mode '' instability .",
    "this particular halo mass fraction is chosen because it restricts the bar to the inner one - quarter of the disk for the run with all the particles moving in the same direction , while , along with the effect of the counterrotating particles , helping to completely suppress the bar in the @xmath11 run ( kalnajs 1977 ) .",
    "a halo mass fraction much larger than this severely limits the instability we are studying ( comins et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "the simulation is done on a cartesian grid with @xmath12 cells .",
    "the radial mass distributions of both the particles and the halo are that described in sellwood & carlberg ( 1984 ) and carlberg & freedman ( 1985 ) for simulating the rotation curve of an sc galaxy .",
    "the initial value of toomre s ( 1964 ) stability parameter is @xmath1 over the entire disk .",
    "this q increases due to heating throughout the run , bringing the disk to a q consistent with the values in real galaxies .",
    "toomre s critical radial wavenumber @xmath13 satisfies the condition assumed by ljh for tightly wrapped spiral waves , @xmath14 , over all but the very center of the disk ( @xmath15 varies from @xmath16 at @xmath17 to @xmath18 at @xmath19 ) . here",
    ", @xmath20 is the epicyclic frequency and @xmath21 is the total surface mass density . for our galaxy ,",
    "@xmath22 at the radius of the sun ( binney & tremaine 1987 ) .",
    "the ljh theory predicts an e - folding time of about @xmath23 of a rotation period for @xmath24 for a wave with radial wavenumber @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the e - folding time increases and the wavenumber decreases ( to @xmath27 ) as @xmath28 increases .",
    "there is no growth for @xmath29 .",
    "each run lasted 8 rotation periods , as measured at the half - mass radius of the disk .",
    "in @xmath30 we consider each run separately . in  5 we compare and contrast them and present our conclusions .",
    "this run began with very little large@xmath31 spiral development , compared to what occurs in the other cases we consider or when all the stars are orbiting in the same direction .",
    "indeed , the disk remains featureless for three - quarters of a rotation period .",
    "theoretically , the @xmath11 case ( equal numbers of particles traveling in both directions ) has no preferred direction of motion .",
    "however , the symmetry is broken by the monte carlo particle position and velocity loads . initially there are @xmath32 more particles moving clockwise in this run .",
    "the initial , stationary spiral in this run points counterclockwise ( figure 1 ) .",
    "stationary here , and throughout this paper , means that the spiral structure rigidly rotates less than @xmath33 per rotation period .",
    "the spiral shown in figure 1 became noticeable after @xmath34 of a rotation period of the disk and it persisted for 4 rotation periods . during this time it was stationary and",
    "its linear growth had ceased , giving saturation of the mode amplitude . as defined in ljh , the initial growth rate @xmath35 during",
    "the first rotation period is well below the maximum growth rate predicted by ljh of @xmath36 .",
    "the spiral arm then changed direction , taking one rotation period ( between the fifth and sixth rotation periods ) to make the transition .",
    "this reversed spiral was also stationary and it persisted for about two rotation periods , by which time the disk also showed a series of spiral arcs .",
    "figure 2 shows the reversed spiral .",
    "the @xmath6 fourier amplitude begins to decrease as soon as @xmath28 exceeded 1.8 , as predicted by ljh .",
    "figure 3 shows this effect .",
    "this run begins with the development of weak multiarm spirals . within one rotation period",
    "these are replaced by a stationary , leading , one - arm spiral that persists for about two rotation periods .",
    "this spiral is similar in appearance to the one in figure 1 , rotated by roughly @xmath38 degrees .",
    "this spiral then transforms into a single trailing - arm spiral .",
    "the change occurs in a fraction of a rotation period .",
    "this spiral then splits into a combination of leading and trail - arm segments .",
    "figure 4 shows the mix of leading and trailing arcs that constitute the stationary structure for five rotation periods late in the run .",
    "once again , the @xmath6 fourier amplitude begins to decay when @xmath28 increases above 1.8 .",
    "this run begins with the formation of trailing multi - arm spirals within the first one quarter of a rotation period .",
    "these arms are numerous , relatively weak ( fourier amplitudes less than 0.003 ) , and they are similar in appearance to those seen at the beginning of a typical run in which all particles are orbiting in the same direction ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "the initial arms persist for over three rotation periods . during this time , an @xmath6 trailing - arm spiral forms , eventually dominating the disk with a maximum fourier amplitude of 0.10 .",
    "the weaker multiple - arm structure vanishes .",
    "the one - arm spiral is stationary and it remains for about 4 rotation periods .",
    "it is less tightly wound than the spiral in figure 1 , but more tightly wound than the spiral in figure 2 .",
    "the @xmath6 mode begins decreasing in fourier amplitude as @xmath28 increases above @xmath40 , as predicted by ljh .",
    "as this @xmath6 spiral fades , it is replaced with a small bar , which persists for the remainder of the run .",
    "our simulations support many of the features of the `` two - stream '' instability in galactic disks with counterrotating stars , as presented in ljh .",
    "consistent with the theory we see : one - armed spirals ; decrease in the amplitude of this spiral as the toomre @xmath28 of the system exceeds @xmath40 ; strengthening of the spiral wave amplitude with @xmath41 ( for @xmath42 ) ; and leading - arm spirals .",
    "the strength of the one - arm instability is predicted by ljh to be strongest in the @xmath11 case , consistent with our simulation .",
    "indeed , the fourier amplitude @xmath43 of the arm there is 7 times greater than in the @xmath37 case and 16 times greater than in the @xmath8 case .",
    "we do note some discrepencies between our results and the existing two - stream theory .",
    "first , the one - armed spiral in the @xmath8 run developed and remained as a trailing - arm spiral .",
    "we attribute this to the particularly strong trailing , multiarm spirals that developed at the beginning of this run .",
    "we believe that the organized motion of the particles in the trailing arms damped the leading arm instability , and transferred energy to the more slowly amplifying , trailing , one - arm spiral .",
    "the influence of strong initial trailing - arm spiral growth and the resulting coupling between modes with different numbers of arms is not addressed in the two - stream instability theory as presented in ljh .",
    "therefore , this result probably does not contradict the theory .",
    "sellwood and merritt ( 1994 ) earlier found unstable @xmath6 modes , but their work differs from the present paper by having @xmath44 not large compared with unity and having the unstable modes localized in the inner part of the disk where @xmath45 was smallest and where the rotation curve was rising .",
    "comparisons with sellwood and valluri ( 1997 ) and howard et al .",
    "( 1997 ) is not possible because they do not give @xmath46 .    finally , we observed dominant spirals changing direction , a phenomenon that is not predicted by the present version of the two - stream instability .",
    "figure 5 shows that with pattern speed @xmath47 , the spiral encounters no resonances , making it possible for the wave to propagate through the center of the disk and thereby reverse direction . for the @xmath37 case ,",
    "the leading arm spiral occurred only in the inner quarter of the disk s radius . the subsequent trailing arm extended over three quarters of the disk .",
    "this transformation appears to be consistent with the behaviour of a swing amplfier .",
    "we see precisely the same qualitative behaviour as depicted in toomre ( 1981 figure 8) , where the leading spiral is only in the inner region of the disk .",
    "it then undergoes a transformation to a trailing arm spiral extending over a much larger radial extent .",
    "we are pursuing this issue of whether we are seeing swing amplification .",
    "the strength and long lifetimes of the one - arm spiral waves , as shown by the runs presented here , suggests that there may be one - armed spiral features in galaxies with counterrotating components .",
    "we are continuing to pursue this intriguing phenomenon in a variety of ways , including simulations with more particles ( which will slow the rate of increase of @xmath28 ) , simulations using a gravitating gas component , simulations using other initial values of @xmath28 , and simulations using other initial radial mass distributions .",
    "in particular , we have found the one - arm spiral waves to persist for over ten rotation periods in a @xmath48 , @xmath49 kuzmin disk .",
    "we are also developing a three dimensional code in which to explore mergers of counterrotating disks .",
    "n.f.c . wishes to thank sun microsystems , inc . , for a grant of computers on which this work was done , and bruce elmegreen for a helpful discussion .",
    "the work of r.v.e.l . was supported in part by nsf grant ast 93 - 20068 ."
