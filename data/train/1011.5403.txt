    "the rather interesting kinetic properties of @xmath2-si / sige / si structures have been attracting attention of researchers for the last two decades [ 1 - 6 ] .",
    "the quantum well in @xmath2-si / si@xmath11ge@xmath12/si is located in the strained si@xmath13ge@xmath12 layer ; therefore , the triply degenerate ( without regard for spin ) valence band of sige splits into three bands due to spin  orbit coupling and mechanical stresses .",
    "the charge carriers are represented by heavy holes , whose band is formed by atomic states with quantum numbers @xmath14 = 1 , @xmath15 = 1/2 , and @xmath16 = 3/2 .",
    "this should result in a strong anisotropy of the effective @xmath17 factor : @xmath17 * @xmath18 4.5 if a magnetic field is normal to the plane of the quantum well and @xmath17 * @xmath18 0 if a magnetic field is parallel to the plane of the quantum well [ 7 ] .",
    "in such structures in a magnetic field normal to the plane of the quantum well , the values of parameter @xmath19 * and @xmath17 * factor are such that the relationship @xmath17*@xmath20 @xmath21@xmath22 holds true ; here , @xmath23 is the bohr magneton , @xmath22 = _ eb_/@xmath19*@xmath24 is the cyclotron frequency , @xmath25 is the electron charge , @xmath26 is the magnetic field , @xmath19 * is the effective hole mass , and @xmath24 is the velocity of light . as a result , resistivity @xmath27 oscillations only with odd filling factors @xmath8 = 1 , 3 , 5 ,  are experimentally observed in magnetic field @xmath26 .",
    "@xmath28 oscillations at @xmath8 = 2 are observed only in some samples .",
    "the specific features of conductivity in the magnetic field corresponding to @xmath8 = 2 are comprehensively studied in this work .",
    "the formation of pinned wigner glass was revealed in @xmath2-si / sige / si with a low impurity concentration ( @xmath29= 8.2 @xmath3 10@xmath30 @xmath31 in the quantum limit in a perpendicular magnetic field [ 8 ] , and a giant positive magnetoresistivity was observed in this structure in a parallel magnetic field [ 9 ] .",
    "this magnetoresistivity was caused by the interaction of the orbital motion of carriers in a wide quantum well with a parallel magnetic field .",
    "an unusual phenomenon , namely , the so called re - entrant metal - insulator transition , was also found in this structure in a magnetic field at a filling factor @xmath8 = 3/2 [ 1 - 6 ] . in [ 2 ] , this anomaly was related to the presence of smooth large scale potential fluctuations with an amplitude comparable with the fermi energy . in [ 3 - 5 ] , however , this phenomenon was explained by the crossing of landau levels with opposite spin directions ( 0@xmath32 , 1@xmath33 when the magnetic field strength changes .    in this work ,",
    "we study magnetoresistivity , hall effect , and acoustoelectronic effects in an tilted magnetic field to determine the dependence of the @xmath17 * factor on the angle of magnetic field tilt to the normal to the plane of a two dimensional channel . with this dependence",

    "it is seen that , as @xmath7 increases , the oscillation maxima and minima shift toward high magnetic fields and the value of @xmath0 in the maxima at @xmath43 = 3/2 increases .",
    "figure 2b shows the @xmath44 dependence near @xmath8 = 3/2 for various @xmath7 .",
    "indeed , the anomaly described in the introduction does occur near @xmath26 = 5.2 t ( @xmath8 = 3/2 ) : @xmath0 increases more than five fold when angle @xmath7 increases from 0 to 70 .",
    "figure 3 shows the dependences of @xmath1 on the total magnetic field and its perpendicular component at @xmath40 = 0.3 k and various angles of inclination @xmath7 .",

    "the @xmath49 dependence is shown in fig .",
    "4 . it is inter esting that anomalies do not occur in the @xmath50 dependences at @xmath8 = 3/2 ( @xmath51 changes by 30% when tilt angle @xmath7 changes from 0 to 75 ) .",
    "moreover , the positions of the @xmath51 minima in a magnetic field are inde pendent of the tilt angle at @xmath8 = 1 , 3 , and 5 , whereas these minima begin to shift toward low magnetic fields at @xmath8 = 2 and @xmath52 50 .",
    "the explanation of this fact requires separate consideration .",
    "apart from the dc measurements , we also studied the acoustoelectronic effects in an tilted magnetic field at @xmath53= 0.3 k. the acoustic methods based on sur face acoustic waves make it possible to measure sam ples of a square or rectangular shape without application of electric contacts .",
    "to this end , a `` hybrid '' method is used : a surface acoustic wave propagates along the surface of the piezoelectric insulator linbo@xmath54 , and the structure to be studied is slightly pressed to the lithium niobate surface by a spring .",
    "a deformation wave propagating along the lithium nio bate surface is accompanied by an electric field wave having the same frequency .",
    "the electric field penetrates into the channel with two dimensional conductivity , inducing high frequency currents and , correspondingly , wave energy absorption . in this experimental configuration ,",
    "deformation is not transmitted into the sample .     vs. total magnetic field at various angles of inclination @xmath7 to the normal to the sample surface at @xmath2 = 1.99 @xmath55 10@xmath4 @xmath56and @xmath40 = 0.3 k ( @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the field components normal and parallel to the structure plane , respectively ) .",

[ fig4 ] ]    we measured the following acoustoelectronic effects : absorption coefficient @xmath60 and the change in the surface acoustic wave velocity at a frequency of 30 mhz in an tilted magnetic field up to 18 t for various angles of inclination at @xmath40 = 0.3 k. the acoustoelectronic effects are governed by the high frequency conductivity of a two dimensional system [ 10 ] .",
    "if the system exhibits the quantum hall effect and dc shubnikov - de haas oscillations in a magnetic field , similar oscillations are also observed in the acoustoelectronic effects .",
    "figure 5 shows absorption coefficient @xmath60 and the change in the surface acoustic wave velocity @xmath61/@xmath62 versus the total magnetic field at various angles of magnetic field tilt .",
    "it is seen that the positions of oscillations shift toward high magnetic fields as the tilt angle increases and that the oscillation corresponding to @xmath8 = 2 disappears at @xmath7 = 53 .",
    "this fact means that , at @xmath7 @xmath63 53 , the conductivity in the two dimensional channel increases strongly .",
    "if an effective @xmath17 factor is isotropic , its value in an tilted magnetic field is usually determined by the formula @xmath64     and the change in the surface acoustic wave velocity @xmath61/@xmath62 vs. the total magnetic field at various angles of magnetic field tilt @xmath65 to the normal to the structure surface , @xmath40 = 0.3 k , and @xmath66 = 30 mhz .",

    "the oscillation amplitude depends on angle @xmath65 at all filling factors ; therefore , axial symmetry which is corresponded to eq .",
    "( 1 ) is likely to be violated in our sample .",
    "we use the dependences of conductivity @xmath51 on temperature and angle of magnetic field tilt @xmath65 at @xmath8= 3 in order to determine the angular dependence of the @xmath17 * factor . as a function of the magnetic field at",
    "@xmath8= 3 , @xmath70is minimal when the fermi level is located between two spin split landau levels , 1@xmath71and 1@xmath32 . as is seen from fig . 6 ,",
    "@xmath72 at @xmath8 = 3 grows with both temperature ( @xmath7= 0 ) and angle of magnetic field tilt @xmath73= 0.3 k ) . in this case",
    ", the temperature and angular dependences of the conductivity minimum can be expressed as      where @xmath26 is the total magnetic field and @xmath76 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "therefore , if we plot the @xmath77 and @xmath78 dependences and attribute certain temperature @xmath53 to every angle @xmath65 at the same @xmath51 , we can obtain the expression @xmath79 or @xmath80 thus , we can determine the dependence of the reduced @xmath17 * factor on tilt angle @xmath7 .",
    "a similar procedure can also be performed for @xmath8 = 5 but with a much lower accuracy .",
    "another method for determining @xmath17*(@xmath81 is related to the construction of the dependences of @xmath51 on total magnetic field @xmath26 for the oscillation minima at @xmath8= 3 , 5 , 7 , and 9 ; various angles @xmath7 ; and@xmath82 = 0.3 k. the conductivities were determined from the curves shown in fig .",

    "are usually observed in shubnikov - de haas oscillations in experiment in si / sige / si samples in a magnetic field nor mal to the plane of a two dimensional channel .",
    "the only exception is the even minimum at @xmath8= 2 , which is only observed in some samples , in particular , in the sample under study .",
    "it is generally accepted that the absence of oscillations with an even filling factor @xmath8is caused by the relation @xmath21@xmath90*@xmath91 .",
    "when this equality holds true in magnetic fields corresponding to even @xmath8 , the energies of the levels with different spin directions are the same in different landau bands ; therefore , oscillations with even @xmath8 are not observed .",
    "the value of @xmath17 * calculated from this equality at @xmath19 * = 0.21@xmath92 is 4.7 .",
    "however , as was shown in our experiment , we both observed a clear minimum of @xmath51 at @xmath8= 2 ( fig .",
    "9a ) and were able to measure its temperature dependence .",
    "the @xmath77 dependence at @xmath7 = 0 corresponds to an activation energy @xmath933.2 k ( 0.28 mev ) , which means that levels 0@xmath32and 1@xmath71at @xmath7= 0 are close but noncoincident .",
    "it is also seen from fig .",
    "9 that conductivity @xmath51 in the minimum at @xmath8 = 2 and a varied magnetic field increases with both the temperature and angle .",
    "when the temperature changes , the position of this oscillation minimum does not change along the magnetic field axis ( fig .",
    "9a ) ; however , as tilt angle @xmath65 increases , the conductivity minimum shifts toward low magnetic fields ( fig .",
    "9b ) . when the tilt angle reaches about 59.5 ( fig .",
    "10 ) , the following two oscillations are present in the curve : the former oscillation with its minimum shifting to the left with increasing angle ( at @xmath95 59.5 , it is observed at @xmath57 = 3.6 t ) and a new oscillation appearing at @xmath96 4 t. as @xmath7 increases further , the amplitudes of the new oscillations increase and their minima shift toward low magnetic fields , and the former oscillations disappear .",

    "[ fig8 ] ]      to analyze these anomalies , we use the idea employed in [ 3 - 5 ] to explain the specific features of electrical resistivity in si / sige / si at @xmath8 = 3/2 .",
    "they were related to the change of the relative position of spinsplit ( 0@xmath32 , 1@xmath33 landau levels induced by the dependence of the @xmath17 * factor of the magnetic field .",
    "this idea was developed earlier in theoretical works [ 12 , 13 ] and was supported experimentally in gaas / algaas for @xmath8 = 4 [ 14 ] and 2/3 [ 15 ] .",
    "it was assumed that the crossing of the landau levels is accompanied by a first order paramagnet - ferromagnet phase transition [ 14 , 15 ] .",
    "we now study the relative position of landau levels 0@xmath32 and 1@xmath71 at @xmath8 = 2 ( @xmath57 = 4.15 t ) as a function of the angle of magnetic field tilt . to this end , we need to know the value of @xmath17*(@xmath7 = 0 ) .",

    "it should be noted that the @xmath17*(@xmath81/@xmath17*(@xmath7 = 0 ) dependence was determined from the dependences of the spin gap energy on temperature and angle @xmath7 at @xmath8 = 3 .",
    "however , at a large spin splitting and @xmath8 = 3 , the order in the relative position of the landau levels can also be broken . in this case , the energy determined in the angular range 0@xmath105 60 differs from the spin gap . as a check",
    ", we also determined @xmath17*(@xmath81 from the @xmath106 dependence at @xmath8 = 2 in the angular range 0@xmath107 60 ( see the inset to fig .",
    "since the dependence @xmath108 holds true in this angular range , the @xmath109= 0)/@xmath106 ratio can be represented by the equation @xmath110 which can be used to determine @xmath17*(@xmath81 .",
    "the values of @xmath17 * determined from this equation are shown as squares in fig .",

    "this means that a ferromagnetic order should be in the system , since two filled landau levels with the same spin direction lie below the fermi level . at @xmath9560 , the levels intersect each other and , at @xmath112 60 , change their relative position , breaking the ferromagnetic order . in the angular range from 59.5to 61 ,",
    "both states coexist .",
    "landau levels 0@xmath32 and 1@xmath71 intersect due to a strong dependence ( decrease ) of the @xmath17 * factor on the angle of magnetic field tilt . at the point of crossing",

    "the @xmath117 dependence is shown in fig . 13 .",
    "both phases are seen to coexist in the angular range 59.5 @xmath11861 .",
    "however , the conductivity at the oscillation minima does not jump and reaches a maximum at the transition point .",
    "this dependence can easily be explained , since the activation energy at the transition point is minimal and increases on either side of this transition .",
    "this fact is also supported by the measurement of the acoustoelectronic effects , whose magnitude is governed by the conductivity .",
    "the dependences of the acoustoelectronic effects on the magnetic field and the tilt angle support the conclusion about the absence of the anomaly in conductivity at @xmath8 = 3/2 .        1 .   when analyzing a number of works dealing with the resistivity anomaly in a magnetic field at @xmath8 = 3/2",
    ", we can conclude that the properties of @xmath2si / sige / si samples are ambiguous : in some samples , the resistiv ity anomaly exists and depends on the angle of mag netic field tilt @xmath7 ; in other samples , this anomaly is absent ; and in samples of a third group , this anomaly is independent of the tilt angle [ 3 ] .",
    "we think that the resistivity anomaly should be studied at @xmath8 = 2 , since point @xmath8 = 3/2 has no physical meaning at a large spin splitting .",
    "the ambiguity of the results obtained on differ ent @xmath2si / sige / si samples is thought to be related to different dependences of the@xmath103 * factor on the angle of magnetic field tilt and , apparently , different absolute values of this factor , which is controlled by the quality of the sample and the hole concentration .        at @xmath8",
