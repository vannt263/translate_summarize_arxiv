    "since the work of wigner @xcite and moyal @xcite , phase space methods have been used extensively in quantum mechanics . a lot of this work is for the harmonic oscillator where both the position and momentum take values in the real line @xmath2 and the phase space is the plane @xmath3 .",
    "there has also been work on finite quantum systems @xcite , where both the position and momentum take values in @xmath4 ( the integers module n ) and the phase space is the lattice @xmath5 .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to study phase space methods for quantum particles on a circle . in this case",
    "the position takes values on a circle @xmath6 and the momentum take discrete values in @xmath7 ( the integers times a factor ) . in this case",
    "the phase space is @xmath8 .",
    "we note that in any area where there is fourier transform involved ( eg in signal processing ) , the phase space can be @xmath1 or @xmath9 or @xmath0 in the sense that where one of the variables takes values in @xmath2 or @xmath4 or @xmath6 , the ` dual variable ' take values in @xmath2 or @xmath4 or @xmath7 , correspondingly .",
    "quantum mechanics on a circle is the simplest example of quantum mechanics in a non - trivial topology and has been studied extensively in the literature @xcite .",
    "physical applications include aharonov - bohm phenomena @xcite , mesoscopic aharonov- bohm rings , floquet - bloch wavefunctions in solid state systems , etc .    in section 2",
    "we introduce the basic formulism for position and momentum states and operators , taking into account the non - trivial topology of our system ( described by the winding number ) . in section 3",
    "we introduce displacement operators and study their properties . in section 4",
    "we define wigner and weyl functions .",
    "we show that the properties of the displacement operators lead to analogous properties for the wigner and weyl functions . in section 5",
    "we discuss an example based on a theta wavefunction ( which is the analogue in a circle , of a gaussian wavefunction in a real line ) .",
    "numerical examples for the corresponding wigner and weyl functions are discussed .",
    "we conclude in section 6 with a discussion of our results .",
    "an electric charge is moving on a circle parameterized by the variable @xmath10 .",
    "the winding number @xmath11 of @xmath10 is defined as the integer part of the @xmath12 ( for negative @xmath10 it is the integer part of the @xmath12 minus @xmath13 ) .",
    "let @xmath14 be the radius of the circle .",
    "a magnetostatic flux @xmath15 is threading the circle in the perpendicular direction.the wavefunction @xmath16 obeys the quasi - periodic boundary condition ( in units @xmath17 ) @xmath18 similar functions also appear in solid state physics ( bloch functions ) .",
    "they are normalizable within each period @xmath19    since @xmath16 is a quasi - periodic function , it can be written as the following fourier expansion : @xmath20 the inverse fourier transform gives : @xmath21 @xmath16 and @xmath22 can be respectively considered as the position and momentum representations of the state @xmath23 .",
    "so eq([rx ] ) and eq([rn ] ) can be written as : @xmath24 @xmath25    let @xmath26 , @xmath27 be position and momentum eigenstates , correspondingly .",
    "then : @xmath28 \\exp[-i2\\pi\\sigma ( w_y - w_x)];\\;\\;\\;\\ ;     \\langle p_m|p_n \\rangle = \\delta_{mn}.    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is easily seen that @xmath29    the completeness can can be expressed as : @xmath30    position and momentum operators are defined as : @xmath31 we note that a different definition of @xmath32 that involves integration from @xmath33 to @xmath34 leads to : @xmath35 the @xmath36 is different from @xmath32 by the projection operator @xmath37 . in the special case that @xmath38 where @xmath39 is an integer , @xmath40 .",
    "it is easily seen that : @xmath41",
    "we define displacement operators as @xmath42|x+\\alpha \\rangle , \\label{dx}\\\\     d(\\alpha , k){|p_n\\rangle}&=&\\exp \\left ( -\\frac{i\\alpha k}{2r } \\right ) \\exp(-i\\alpha p_n)|p_{n+k } \\rangle .",

    "the period is @xmath48 if @xmath49 is even and @xmath50 if @xmath49 is odd number : @xmath51 = ( -1)^{k }      \\exp \\left ( \\frac{i\\alpha\\sigma}{r } \\right ) d(\\alpha , k),\\ ] ]    we also define the parity operator as : @xmath52 the ` flux factor ' @xmath53 has been included in the definition so that the integrand @xmath54 is periodic .",
    "the parity operator obeys the relations : @xmath55 the flux breaks the parity symmetry .",
    "the parity operator acting on the state @xmath56 ( which has momentum @xmath57 ) gives the state @xmath58 ( which has momentum @xmath59 ) ; i.e. , it is a parity with momentum origin @xmath60 .",
    "the parity operator acting on the state @xmath61 gives the state @xmath62 .",
    "the ` flux factor ' @xmath63 ` corrects ' the quasi - periodicity caused by the flux into periodicity .",
    "we note here that in the harmonic oscillator case the displacement operators @xmath64 obey the important relations @xcite @xmath65 where @xmath66 and @xmath67 is here the harmonic oscillator parity operator ( defined in @xcite ) .",
    "these relations are intimately related with the marginal properties of the wigner and weyl functions .    motivated by this we study here similar relations in our context of quantum mechanics on a circle .",
    "we first define the function @xmath68 this is the sinc - function ( used extensively in areas like digital signal processing ) with a phase factor . for integers @xmath69 @xmath70 where @xmath71 is kronecker s delta . using eqs([dx]),([dp ] ) can prove that : @xmath72 @xmath73 we have explained earlier why the integrations involve the ` flux factor ' @xmath53 .",
    "it is natural to ask what is the result in eq([dda ] ) if we do not include the ` flux factor ' .",
    "we can prove @xmath74 in eq([dda ] ) , integration from @xmath48 to @xmath50 , gives the same result for even @xmath49 and the same result but with opposite sign for odd @xmath49 : @xmath75    this is related to the fact ( eq([qpd ] ) ) that for odd @xmath49 the @xmath46 is ` anti - periodic ' with ` period ' @xmath48 ( it is periodic with period @xmath50 ) .",
    "therefore if we integrate from @xmath76 to @xmath50 we get the same result for even @xmath49 and zero for odd @xmath49 .    combining eqs([u0]),([dda ] )",
    "we easily show that : @xmath77 it is natural to ask what is the result in eq([ddakev ] ) if we sum over both even and odd integers .",
    "we can prove @xmath78    the displaced parity operator is @xmath79 @xmath80 is a periodic function of @xmath47 with the period @xmath81 : @xmath82 we next show that : @xmath83 @xmath84 @xmath85 eq([udk ] ) is proved if we use eq([ddk]),([uak ] ) in conjunction with the fact that @xmath86 for completeness we also mention that @xmath87 eq([evend1 ] ) can be proved using eq([dx ] ) .",
    "we note that in eq([udk ] ) we have projectors to the diametrically opposite position states @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "this is related to the fact that the displaced parity operator on the left hand side of eq([udk ] ) , has period @xmath81 .",
    "eq([uda ] ) can be proved using eq([dda ] ) .",
    "summation over @xmath49 in eq([uda ] ) gives eq([ui ] ) .",
    "the displacement operators are related to the displaced parity operators through a two - dimensional fourier transform .",
    "multiplying the left and right hand sides of eq([ddakev ] ) with @xmath90 and @xmath91^\\dagger$ ] correspondingly , we can prove : @xmath92 \\textrm{d}\\beta = u(\\alpha , k)\\ ] ]",
    "the weyl and wigner functions can be defined in terms of the displacement and parity operator correspondingly , as : @xmath93 , \\\\",
    "w(x , p_n ) & = & \\textrm{tr } \\left [ \\hat{\\rho}u(x , n ) \\right ] ,    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using the fact that the density matrix is hermitian , we easily show that the wigner function is real .",
    "the weyl function is in general complex .",
    "we can easily show the following formulas ( which can also be used as alternative definitions ) : @xmath94.\\\\     w(x , p_n ) & = & \\frac{1}{2\\pi r } \\int_{0}^{2\\pi r } \\langle x-\\alpha|\\hat{\\rho}|x+\\alpha\\rangle              \\exp(i2\\alpha p_n ) \\textrm{d}\\alpha ,   \\\\            & = & \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty } \\langle p_{n+k}|\\hat{\\rho}|p_{n - k } \\rangle \\exp \\left ( \\frac{2ixk}{r } \\right ) .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the wigner function describes the pseudo - probability of finding the particle in phase space , in a way consistent with quantum mechanics and the uncertainty principle .",
    "the weyl function is equal to the overlap of the displaced state with the original state . in this sense , the @xmath47 , @xmath49",
    "are position and momentum _ increments_. the weyl function can be understood as a _ generalised correlation function_. if we have the wavefunction @xmath16 in order to find the correlation we displace it into @xmath95 and take the integral of @xmath96 . in the weyl function",
    "we perform a more general displacement in phase space i.e. , a displacement in both position and momentum .",
    "therefore the correlation is a special case of the weyl function with @xmath97 ( or @xmath98 ) .",
    "we note that the momentum takes values @xmath99 and depends on @xmath100 .",
    "in contrast the momentum increments appearing on the weyl function take values @xmath101 and do * not * depend on @xmath100 .",
    "the wigner function is related to the weyl function through a two - dimensional fourier transform @xmath102 this can be proved using eq([dda ] ) or eq([qw ] ) .",
    "this result is intimately connected to the fact that the displacement operator and displaced parity operator are related to each other through a two - dimensional fourier transform ( eq([qw ] ) ) .    using eqs([aqpd]),([pu ] ) we easily see that the wigner function is periodic function of @xmath10 with period @xmath81 ; and the weyl function is quasi - periodic with ` period ' @xmath48 : @xmath103 the wigner and weyl functions depend on the ` magnetic flux ' @xmath100 although for simplicity in the notation we have not shown this dependence explicitly .",
    "they obey the relations @xmath104 this is related to the fact that the momentum is @xmath105 and as we go from @xmath100 to @xmath106 the momentum @xmath107 is relabelled as @xmath108 .",
    "the properties of the displacement and parity operator that we proved above can be translated into properties for the wigner and weyl functions . starting with the weyl function we use eqs([ddk]),([dda ] ) to prove that : @xmath109 we can make here a similar comment to that made for eq([dda ] ) . in eq([weylda ] ) , integration from @xmath48 to @xmath50 , gives the same result for even @xmath49 and the same result but with opposite sign for odd @xmath49 .",
    "therefore if we integrate from @xmath76 to @xmath50 we get the same result for even @xmath49 and zero for odd @xmath49 .",
    "we can also show that @xmath110    for the wigner function we use eqs([udk]),([uda]),([ui ] ) to prove : @xmath111    we can also prove that @xmath112",
    "as an example , we consider a ` free particle ' descibed with the hamiltonian @xmath113 we note that the particle feels a vector potential through the quasi - periodic boundary condition .",
    "we assume that at @xmath114 the wavefunction is a ` gaussian on a circle ' i.e. , a theta function . in order to explain this we introduce the zak",

    "is defined only on the discrete values of the momenta @xmath128 and the parallel black lines in the figure show the case @xmath129 . as expected from eq([qw ] ) , the wigner function is periodic function of @xmath10 with period @xmath130 . also it has been explained in eq([wigsigma ] ) that the plotted values of @xmath131 for @xmath132 represent the @xmath133 for @xmath134 .",

    "we calculate the time evolution of this system .",
    "this is easily done in the momentum representation as @xmath137 we need the state of the system at @xmath114 in the momentum representation .",
    "if @xmath138 is the fourier transform of @xmath139 : @xmath140 then using eq([rn ] ) , eq([qperiodic ] ) and eq([ft ] ) we can prove the relation : @xmath141 since the fourier transform of gaussian wavefunction eq([gauss ] ) is : @xmath142 we obtain : @xmath143 inserting eq([b ] ) into ( [ a ] ) we get @xmath144",
