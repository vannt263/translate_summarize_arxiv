    "the tully - fisher relation ( tfr ) relates the intrinsic luminosity to the maximum rotation velocity of the gas , @xmath1 , a proxy for the circular velocity , of late - type galaxies @xcite .",
    "it reflects the equilibrium state of late - type galaxies but , unlike the fundamental plane of elliptical galaxies , which is a three - parameters relation @xcite , has only two parameters , implying additional relations between the observational characteristics .",
    "still for gas - rich late - type galaxies , the tfr has been generalised to a relation between @xmath1 and stellar mass ( the stellar - mass tfr or stfr ) and between @xmath1 and hi gas+stellar mass ( the baryonic tfr or gstfr in our notation ) @xcite .",
    "these relations are the subject of very active theoretical and observational work .",
    "e.g. , @xcite present simulations of the evolution of the tfr of massive late - types ( @xmath2  km / s ) and show that while the tfr undergoes strong luminosity evolution , the stfr and gstfr have remained constant since @xmath3 . to test for any possible environmental influences , these authors switched off star - formation in a disk galaxy by removing all its halo gas .",
    "after some fading and reddening , this galaxy ends up slightly below the b - band tfr but remains on the stfr and gstfr . @xcite",
    "have simulated the evolution of the stfr and gstfr of dwarf galaxies ( @xmath4  km / s ) .",
    "again , little evolution of these relations with redshift is found .",
    "these authors predict a steepening of the stfr slope below a stellar mass of @xmath5 while the gstfr is expected to have a constant slope .",
    "if instead of the observed rotation we consider the circular velocity characterizing the gravitational potential , these relations can be extended to any type of galaxies , in particular to giant and dwarf ellipticals ( des ) which are not dominated by rotation .",
    "this generalization would allow to probe further the similarities of the dark - matter distribution of early- and late - type galaxies that were already investigated by @xcite .",
    "the rotation curves of ellipticals can not readily be observed since they contain little or no hi @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite determined the circular velocities of bright ellipticals using dynamical models .",
    "@xcite measured stellar rotation curves for a sample of 16 flattened virgo des .",
    "these authors found des to adhere closely to the tfr of gas - rich dwarf and spiral galaxies .",
    "however , they did not correct for asymmetric drift , which , for des , can be as large as the velocity dispersion . in order to obtain more reliable rotation curves of des",
    ", we constructed dynamical models for 13 des from the fornax cluster , nearby southern groups , and the local group , to stellar kinematics out to @xmath6  r@xmath7 .",
    "the local group des were observed with the ohp 1.93-m telescope @xcite .",
    "the other des were observed in the course of eso large programme 165.n  0115 ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we use the observed surface brightness distribution , the mean velocity , the velocity dispersion , and , if available , the central fourth order moment of the line - of - sight velocity distributions calculated from the kinematic parameters up to @xmath8 @xcite , as data .",
    "a detailed account of the modeling method can be found in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . in @xcite , the model for fs373",
    "is discussed ; in @xcite , we present the models for ngc147 , ngc185 , and ngc205 ( including a technical description of the modeling method , a presentation of the data , and a comparison of the models with the data ) . we can define the range of models , and hence mass distributions , that are consistent with the data and determine the best fitting model .",
    "the strong dependence of the model mass profile , and consequently the corresponding circular velocity curve , on the velocity dispersion profiles makes estimates of @xmath9 based on dynamical models much less sensitive to the unknown inclination than @xmath9 estimates based on direct measurements of stellar rotation curves .",
    "there remains the caveat that @xmath9 estimates derived from dynamical models are by construction to some extent model dependent and are the result of the non - trivial conversion of stellar kinematics into a dark - matter density profile .",
    "the new data for the 13 des are presented in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "@xmath10 is the maximum circular velocity of the best fitting model ; @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the lowest and highest maximum circular velocities of models that are consistent with the data at the 90% confidence level .",
    "all velocities are expressed in km / s . @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the b and 2mass ks band absolute magnitudes , respectively .",
    "the maximum extent of the kinematic data in units of the half - light radius is indicated by @xmath15 .",
    "the des with `` fcc '' designations are taken from the @xcite fornax cluster catalog ; `` fs '' refers to the @xcite catalog of southern groups ; ngc5898_dw1 and ngc5898_dw2 are two des in the ngc5898 group @xcite . throughout this paper ,",
    "we use @xmath16  km  s@xmath17  mpc@xmath17 .",
    "the b - band tfrs traced by early and late - type galaxies are plotted in the left panel of fig . [ tf ] .",
    "the black spiral symbols represent late - type galaxies taken from @xcite ( tp00 ) , @xcite ( c00 ) , @xcite ( m05 ) , and @xcite ( g06 ) .",
    "if galaxies appear in more than one data set , we use only the tp00 data . based on 115 galaxies ,",
    "tp00 find @xmath18 , with @xmath19 expressed in solar b - band luminosities and @xmath9 in km  s@xmath17 .",
    "we fitted a straight line to the combined tp00 and m05 data sets , taking into account the errors on the luminosities @xmath20 and on the circular velocities @xmath9 , using the routine fitexy of @xcite .",
    "the diagonal elements of the covariance matrix are used as approximations of the variances of the regression coefficients .",
    "going back to the original papers from which the m05 data set is compiled , the average error on @xmath9 is @xmath21  km  s@xmath17 .",
    "we adopt a 15% error on the total luminosity , roughly accounting for the various sources of statistical and systematic errors . limiting ourselves to the 128 galaxies brighter than @xmath22 , or @xmath23  mag , we find the relation @xmath24 at lower luminosities ,",
    "the situation becomes very unclear .",
    "the m05 late - types fall systematically below the tfr whereas the g06 galaxies lie above it . this may be due to an increased scatter about the tfr at low luminosities .",
    "@xcite note that at @xmath25 , turbulent gas motions start dominating the ordered rotation , causing the scatter about the tfr to increase dramatically .",
    "they also suggest that at that point the notion of a thin , well - aligned gas disk might break down . on the other hand ,",
    "even if low - mass galaxies are supported by turbulence rather than by rotation , one would expect some kind of tfr to persist , even though the underlying equilibrium of these fainter systems might be different .",
    "we fitted a straight line to the data of the early - type galaxies , taking into account the errors on the luminosities @xmath20 and on the circular velocities @xmath9 .",
    "this data - set consists of the luminosities and the circular velocities of bright ellipticals , estimated by @xcite ( k00 ) and @xcite ( mb01 ) from spherical dynamical models , and des from @xcite and @xcite ( d06 ) . in case where galaxies appear in both the k00 and mb01 data sets",
    ", we opted to use the k00 data because these models allow for a radially varying anisotropy .",
    "we note that the k00 and mb01 @xmath9 estimates of overlapping galaxies are in good agreement . for the luminosities , as for the late - type galaxies , we assume a 15% error",
    "; for the circular velocities , we use the 90% confidence level uncertainties given by the various authors .",
    "we find that the tfr of the early - type galaxies can be well represented by a single power - law over 3 decades in luminosity : @xmath26 within the error bars , the b - band tfrs of early - type and late - type galaxies have the same slope . in the de - regime , at about @xmath27 , or @xmath28  mag , late and early - type dwarfs essentially overlap in a @xmath20 versus @xmath29 diagram . in the b - band , ellipticals ,",
    "in the regime defined by @xmath30 , or @xmath31 to @xmath32  mag , are about a factor of @xmath33 , or about 1.5  mag , fainter than spiral galaxies with the same @xmath9 .",
    "the k - band tfr of early and late - type galaxies is plotted in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ tf ] , using 2mass ks - band magnitudes for the dwarf and giant early - type galaxies .",
    "tp00 find @xmath34 for the k - band tfr of late - type galaxies .",
    "our fit to the k - band tfr of the d06 , k00 , and mb01 galaxies yields @xmath35 in the k - band , ellipticals are roughly a factor of 3 , or @xmath36  mag , fainter than late - types with the same @xmath9 .",
    "going from the well - known tfr to the stellar mass tully - fisher relation ( stfr ) requires the conversion of luminosities , and , if available , colours , to stellar masses , @xmath37 . @xcite",
    "have fitted a suite of spectrophotometric disk evolution models to a set of observed properties of late - type galaxies .",
    "the acceptable models produce a tight correlation between the stellar mass - to - light ratio ( @xmath38 ) and colour .",
    "alternatively , one can use the stellar @xmath38 that gives the best mond fit to the rotation curves or use the maximum disk @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "these @xmath38 estimates generally agree to within of a factor of 2 . in short ,",
    "the @xmath38s and stellar masses of late - type galaxies can be estimated straightforwardly from their colours or rotation curves . here",
    ", we use the @xmath38 based on the properties of the stellar population ( colours , ages , metallicities ) .",
    "the uncertainty on @xmath37 , which is the combined uncertainty on @xmath19 and @xmath38 , can be quite substantial and we estimate it to be of the order of 100% , on average .    no easy - to - use tool for estimating @xmath38s of early - type galaxies exists .",
    "however , the mass - metallicity relation of early - type galaxies is observationally well constrained , from the faintest dwarfs up to the brightest giants , using either luminosity @xcite or velocity dispersion @xcite as a substitute for galaxy mass .",
    "the thoretical predictions for this relation and the observations are in reasonably good agreement @xcite .",
    "we tried different methods to calculate @xmath38 . _",
    "( i ) _ we fit a 4@xmath39 order polynomial to the empirical luminosity - metallicity relation of @xcite in order to estimate the metallicities of the galaxies in the k00 , mb01 , and d06 data sets . plugging this metallicity , along with an average age of 10  gyr @xcite , in the ssp - models of @xcite or @xcite yields the b - band @xmath38 . _",
    "( ii ) _ for the giant ellipticals , one can use the relation @xmath40 of @xcite between stellar mass @xmath37 , expressed in @xmath41 , and velocity dispersion @xmath42 , expressed in km / s , or , alternatively , _",
    "( iii ) _ the empirical metallicity and age relations , @xmath43 } = -1.06 + 0.55 \\times \\log(\\sigma)$ ] and @xmath44 , of @xcite in combination with the @xcite or @xcite models .",
    "we found all methods to be in excellent agreement .",
    "they have systematic offsets much smaller than the errorbars on the datapoints and yield stfr slopes that agree to within the parameter uncertainties ( see below ) .",
    "we also converted the 2mass ks - magnitudes into @xmath37 using the @xcite models .",
    "this gave results that were entirely consistent with the stfr based on the b - band data .",
    "for the remainder , we adopt approach _ ( iii ) _ for the giant ellipticals and approach _ ( i ) _ for the des .    the stfrs of early and late - type galaxies are plotted in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ mass ] . both early and late - type galaxies trace a single yet curved stfr over 3.5 orders of magnitude in stellar mass .",
    "for all galaxies in the range @xmath45 we find @xmath46 using the @xmath47 relation of @xcite yields a stfr slope of @xmath48 , consistent with eq .",
    "( [ stfr_all1 ] ) .",
    "this is in good agreement with theoretical predictions @xcite .",
    "the curvature of the stfr is at least partially responsible for @xcite concluding that early type galaxies have lower stellar masses than late - type galaxies at the same @xmath10 if the stfr of the late - types is extrapolated .",
    "the mass of the gaseous component in late - type galaxies follows from 21  cm observations .",
    "we denote the sum of the stellar and hi gas mass by @xmath49 .",
    "since early - type galaxies do not contain a significant interstellar medium ( see @xcite and references therein , @xcite , @xcite ) , the hi gas+stellar mass tully - fisher relation ( gstfr ) of early - types to a good approximation equals their stfr . for the late - types",
    ", we use the data of @xcite .",
    "the gstfr of the early and late - type galaxies , presented in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ mass ] , is less curved than the stfr , and , for the whole range @xmath50 , can be fitted by the linear relation @xmath51 this can be compared with the gstfr for giant and dwarf late - type galaxies constructed by @xcite , who find a slope @xmath52 .",
    "our result agrees much better with the slope of 3 which one would expect from the virial theorem , assuming a constant virial overdensity and a constant baryon - to - total mass ratio @xcite .",
    "late - types show a vertical scatter of 0.2 dex in @xmath53 about the gstfr , giant early - types have a slightly larger scatter of 0.3 dex .",
    "des are offset downwards by 0.4 dex , probably due to them having lost part of their baryons by galactic winds @xcite or ram - pressure stripping @xcite .",
    "early - type and late - type galaxies trace different yet approximately parallel tfrs , with early - types being roughly 1.5  mag fainter in the b - band than late - types for the same @xmath9 .",
    "surprisingly , all galaxies trace the same stfr and gstfr over a range of 3.5 decades in stellar or hi gas+stellar mass .",
    "des lie slightly below the general gstfr .",
    "this seems to indicate that early - type dwarfs , which , contrary to the late - types , reside in high - density environments have lost their gas due to environmental influences , e.g. by galactic winds or ram - pressure stripping .",
    "this also shows that the environment only plays a secondary role in shaping these relations , making them a `` clean '' cosmological tool .",
    "@xmath0cdm simulations are able to account for the observed slopes of these relations .",
