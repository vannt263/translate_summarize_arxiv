    "one of the attractive features of the seesaw mechanism for neutrino masses  @xcite is that it provides a way to understand the origin of matter in the universe via leptogenesis  @xcite ( for a recent review , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in the vanilla framework of leptogenesis",
    "where right - handed ( rh ) neutrino masses are hierarchical , it is well known that the lightest rh neutrino needs to be rather heavy , around @xmath3  gev or higher  @xcite .",
    "these scales are however beyond the reach of collider experiments , e.g. the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) . on the other hand , from the point of view of the seesaw model itself",
    ", one can envisage the new physics scale to be anywhere between tev to @xmath4  gev .",
    "it is well known that the scale of leptogenesis can be lowered to the tev scale if one allows the rh neutrinos to be quasi - degenerate  @xcite .",
    "however , first the quasi - degeneracy should be motivated , and second if the scale of the rh neutrinos is to be explained by the breaking of some gauge symmetry , what is the impact of the latter on leptogenesis ?",
    "two classes of seesaw models are of interest in this connection : the usual type - i seesaw  @xcite , and the inverse seesaw  @xcite . in both classes of models , a higher gauge symmetry , e.g. @xmath5 , is usually called for to make the model `` natural '' .",
    "in addition to providing a compelling reason for the inclusion of the rh neutrinos to guarantee anomaly cancellation , in the type - i case it can be used to understand why the seesaw scale is so much lower than the planck scale , whereas , in the inverse seesaw case , it stabilizes the zeros in the @xmath6 mass matrix that leads to the doubly - suppressed seesaw formula .",
    "an attractive gauge symmetry that embeds the @xmath5 symmetry and also provides a way to understand the origin of parity violation in low - energy weak interactions is the left - right ( lr ) gauge group @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "an important question that arises in these models is : what is the scale of parity invariance ?",
    "in particular , if it is in the tev range and if at the same time leptogenesis generates the desired matter - anti - matter asymmetry , then the lhc could be probing neutrino mass physics as well as shed light on one of the deepest mysteries of cosmology .    since sakharov s",
    "out - of - equilibrium condition  @xcite must be satisfied in order to generate a baryon asymmetry , the existence of new interactions inherent to the lr models make it a nontrivial task to check whether a tev - scale @xmath1 is indeed compatible with leptogenesis as an explanation of the origin of matter .",
    "specifically , the efficiency of leptogenesis crucially depends on the number of rh neutrinos that decay out of equilibrium to produce a leptonic asymmetry .",
    "this number is set by two things : first , it depends on the relative magnitudes of the decay rate and the ( @xmath8-conserving ) gauge scattering rates of the rh neutrino , since this can lead to a dilution of the number of `` useful '' rh neutrinos .",
    "second , the washout processes , primarily inverse decays , should drop out of equilibrium early enough , otherwise the number of rh neutrinos gets suppressed at an exponential rate .",
    "these issues have been analyzed for the type - i case within lr symmetric models  @xcite as well as @xmath5 models  @xcite .",
    "it was found that for the full lr models with tev - scale parity restoration and rh neutrino masses , gauge scattering rates induced by @xmath1 exchange largely dominate the decay and inverse decay rates because the yukawa couplings are small for the standard type - i seesaw at the tev scale .",
    "these facts lead to a huge dilution of the number of rh neutrinos which decay out of equilibrium and in a @xmath8 asymmetric manner .",
    "moreover , the gauge scattering interactions also wash out lepton number at a very large rate , much larger than the inverse decays .",
    "altogether , these two effects lead to a very stringent constraint on the mass scale of @xmath1 for successful leptogenesis , @xmath9  tev  @xcite , which would imply that the discovery of a @xmath1 at the lhc is incompatible with thermal leptogenesis as the origin of matter . on the other hand , in the case of a simple @xmath5 theory",
    ", successful leptogenesis only implies that @xmath10  tev in the `` collider - friendly '' region of parameter space where the rh neutrino mass is less than half the @xmath2 mass  @xcite model where only the doubly charged higgs boson is in the tev range , see ref .",
    "@xcite . ] .",
    "we note that there exist bounds on the @xmath1 mass from low energy observations  @xcite and they allow @xmath1 mass to be as low as 2.5 tev .    in this paper",
    ", we have analyzed the leptogenesis constraints on the recently proposed tev - scale lr model within a unified supersymmetric @xmath0 framework  @xcite where neutrino masses arise from an inverse seesaw mechanism .",
    "two features distinguish the inverse seesaw mechanism from the type - i seesaw : ( i ) the dirac yukawa couplings of the rh neutrino @xmath11 can be much larger ( @xmath12 ) than for the type - i case ( where they are typically of order @xmath13 for tev - scale rh neutrino masses ) and ( ii ) the lepton - number - violating parameter ( the majorana mass @xmath14 of the left - right singlet lepton @xmath15 , which measures the `` pseudo - diracness '' of @xmath11 ) is much smaller than the dirac mass of @xmath11 . as a result , first , the decay rate of @xmath11 can be much larger than the @xmath1 exchange scattering rate at the baryogenesis epoch , and second , the wash - out processes are suppressed by the small majorana mass @xmath14 .",
    "consequently , we find that both the @xmath1 and @xmath2 can be in the tev range and hence accessible at the lhc .",
    "this is the main result of our paper , and it should make the case for searching the @xmath1 and @xmath2 at lhc stronger  @xcite .    this paper is organized as follows : in section ii , we summarize the lr inverse seesaw model and give the dirac yukawa couplings as well as the various lepton - number - violating parameters as constrained by @xmath0 unification  @xcite . in section iii , we present a generic discussion of leptogenesis in this class of inverse seesaw models ; in section iv , we present the numerical results for our model . finally , we summarize our findings and conclude in section v. in appendix a , we present a new scenario for gauge coupling unification ( different from that discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite ) in these models where the relative magnitudes of @xmath1 and @xmath2 masses can be unrelated . in appendix b ,",
    "we give the analytical expressions of the @xmath8-asymmetry in the inverse seesaw model for some special cases .",
    "the implementation of the inverse seesaw mechanism  @xcite requires , in addition to the usual standard model ( sm ) singlet rh neutrinos @xmath16 ( @xmath17 for three generations ) as in the typical type - i seesaw , three extra sm gauge singlet fermions @xmath18 coupled to the rh neutrinos through the lepton - number - conserving couplings of the type @xmath19 , while the traditional rh neutrino majorana mass term is forbidden by the lepton number symmetry majorana mass term but its magnitude is of order @xmath20 gev and is too small to affect our discussion . ] . in the low energy theory ,",
    "dominant lepton number breaking arises only from the self - coupling term @xmath21 .",
    "the neutrino mass lagrangian in the flavor basis is given by @xmath22 where @xmath14 is a complex symmetric @xmath23 mass matrix containing all the lepton - number - violating parameters , and @xmath24 and @xmath25 are @xmath23 mass matrices representing the dirac mass terms in the @xmath26@xmath11 and @xmath11@xmath15 sectors , respectively . in the basis @xmath27 , the full @xmath28 neutrino mass matrix is then given by @xmath29 the lepton - number - violating entries in the @xmath14 matrix have to be much smaller than the dirac neutrino masses in order to fit the light neutrino masses , as observed in neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "in fact , the light neutrino mass matrix can be cast in a seesaw - like form in the limit @xmath30 : @xmath31 to leading order in @xmath32 .",
    "as expected , in the limit @xmath33 , which corresponds to unbroken lepton number , we recover the massless neutrinos of the sm .",
    "we note that this smallness of the @xmath14-parameter peculiar to the inverse seesaw models allows for a neutrino mass fit even with tev - scale rh neutrino mass and large dirac mass terms .",
    "theoretically , smallness of the @xmath14-term could be explained in extra dimensional brane world models if the lepton number is broken in a separate brane from the standard model brane  @xcite .    as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , in order to embed a tev - scale inverse seesaw mechanism into a generic @xmath0 model , we need to break the @xmath5 gauge symmetry by * 16 * -higgs fields at the tev scale , whereas the @xmath0 symmetry is broken down to the lr symmetric gauge group @xmath34 at the gut - scale by * 45 * and * 54 * -higgs fields ; finally , the sm symmetry is broken at the weak scale by * 10 * -higgs fields .",
    "as in the usual @xmath0 models , the three generations of quark and lepton fields are assigned to three * 16 * -dimensional spinor representations , and correspondingly , we add three @xmath0 singlet matter fields @xmath35 ( they can be identified with the @xmath18 fields above ) to implement the inverse seesaw mechanism .    as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , we need at least two @xmath36 fields to have a realistic fermion mass spectrum ; we also need two @xmath37 fields , one for symmetry breaking at the gut scale and another to give rise to the vectorlike color triplets at the tev - scale as required by coupling unification constraints .",
    "similarly , we need only the @xmath38 doublet fields of @xmath39 and no @xmath40 fields for unification . with this minimal set of higgs fields ,",
    "the most general yukawa superpotential is given by @xmath41 where the first term is the usual yukawa coupling term , the second and third terms are higher - dimensional terms , and the last two terms give rise to the inverse seesaw mechanism .",
    "as already pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is sufficient to keep only one of the higher - dimensional operators , usually the @xmath42 term , whose fully antisymmetric combination acts as an effective @xmath43 operator , in order to obtain a realistic fermion mass spectrum at the gut scale , and hence for simplicity , we will assume all the @xmath44-couplings to be zero ; keeping this term does not affect our discussion below .",
    "term has two effective contributions ",
    "one of @xmath45 -higgs type and another of @xmath46-higgs type .",
    "the effective @xmath45 coupling can be absorbed into the first term , and since the @xmath46 coupling is antisymmetric in generation indices , it only contributes to the off - diagonal elements in fermion mass matrices .",
    "hence , a non - zero @xmath44 coupling could only slightly modify the specific structure of the dirac neutrino mass matrix , without changing any of the main results of the paper . ]",
    "the @xmath5 symmetry is broken when the @xmath47-field acquires a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) and the @xmath11@xmath15 sector rh neutrino mass matrix is given by @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the vev of @xmath47 and is of order tev for the low - scale @xmath5 breaking models considered here .",
    "all the other fermion masses are generated when the sm symmetry is broken at the weak scale by the @xmath36 vevs .",
    "we consider here only the model ( a ) of ref .",
    "@xcite where the vev patterns of the two @xmath50 fields are given by @xmath51 and the fermion mass matrices are given by @xmath52 where in the notation of ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath53 and @xmath54 . using the renormalization group evolution of the fermion masses in the lr model",
    ", we obtain the gut - scale fermion masses starting from the experimentally known weak scale values , and using these mass eigenvalues , we obtain a fit for the yukawa coupling matrices at the gut scale , from which we can get the structure of the dirac neutrino mass matrix .   here , as an example ,",
    "we quote the result for @xmath55  @xcite : @xmath56 with this dirac neutrino mass , we can easily fit the observed neutrino oscillation data by fixing the singlet mass matrix @xmath14 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lhmass ] ) . as an example , for a normal hierarchy of neutrino masses , and assuming a diagonal structure for the rh neutrino mass matrix @xmath25 with eigenvalues ( 3.5 , 3 , 1 ) tev , we can fit the observed @xmath57 neutrino oscillation data  @xcite for the following choice of @xmath14 : @xmath58",
    "in this section we summarize the main features of leptogenesis within the class of lr inverse seesaw models discussed above .",
    "we also wish to note that while we have used the @xmath0 framework to make the results definite and somewhat more predictive , our discussion applies also to the case with tev - scale left - right symmetry without grand unification . in what follows",
    ", we will partially follow the discussion presented in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , a crucial difference of the inverse seesaw from the usual seesaw is the dependence on a new mass matrix , @xmath14 , which can lead to the result that no matter what the ratio of the mass scales @xmath59 is , the lightness of the left - handed neutrinos can always be explained by small @xmath14 entries . in other words ,",
    "the inverse seesaw makes it possible to have at the same time large dirac masses and low , say tev - scale , rh neutrino masses , and it still can explain why neutrinos are light .",
    "this is directly connected to the fact that , in the limit @xmath33 , lepton number is conserved , and therefore neutrino masses vanish , as in the sm .",
    "this is a crucial difference from the case of tev scale type i seesaw .",
    "an interesting question to ask is how leptogenesis is affected by this distinctive feature of inverse seesaw models .",
    "we expect that the lepton - number - violating washout will go to zero in the limit of vanishing @xmath14 . as a matter of fact , as explicitly shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the all - important @xmath60 washout process @xmath61 vanishes as @xmath62 , with @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the total decay rate of @xmath16 into lepton and higgs ( and antiparticles ) , and @xmath65 are the masses of the quasi - dirac rh neutrino pair @xmath66 ( with @xmath67 ) .",
    "note that we denote by @xmath68 the heavy neutrino mass eigenvalues . as shown in the appendix",
    ", the leading order contribution to the mass splitting for each quasi - dirac pair comes from the diagonal elements of the @xmath14 matrix .",
    "therefore , as expected , the washout tends to zero in the limit of vanishing @xmath14 . the suppression of the washout can be shown to occur through the destructive interference of one member of a quasi - dirac pair with the other  @xcite .",
    "it is instructive to show numerically how the washout is kept under control in this family of models with more than one pair of rh neutrinos .",
    "the washout parameter @xmath69 is defined as @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the usual hubble expansion rate : @xmath72 , and @xmath73  ev .",
    "however , the main results of this paper remain unchanged irrespective of the sparticle spectrum chosen . ] . plugging in numbers",
    ", we find that with yukawa couplings of order @xmath74 and a rh neutrino mass of order 1 tev , the washout parameter @xmath75 is of order @xmath76 , which is huge ! however , the suppression of the washout is also very large , being proportional to @xmath77 with @xmath78 due to the smallness of @xmath14 , as required to get the right scale for the light neutrinos .",
    "specifically , for the example of eq .",
    "( [ eq : murhs ] ) , we find that @xmath79 and therefore the effective washout parameter @xmath80 , which is reasonably small .",
    "in the lr model we are considering , there are other processes contributing to the washout of lepton number , for instance , @xmath81 .",
    "more precisely , this process destroys rh lepton number , but in the temperature range of interest to us ( tev scale ) every individual rh lepton flavor equilibrates with the lh lepton flavor one , thanks to the yukawa interactions .",
    "does this process also turn off in the limit of lepton number conservation ?",
    "it can be easily shown that , including the production of the rh neutrino by an inverse decay , followed by the scattering process mentioned above , there is also a destructive interference within the quasi - dirac pair which leads exactly to the same kind of @xmath77-suppression as for the process @xmath82 .",
    "another feature of inverse seesaw models is that they typically lead to lepton flavor equilibration  @xcite because of the large yukawa couplings .",
    "more precisely , it can be shown that the process @xmath83 , which does not change lepton number , but changes lepton flavor , is deep in thermal equilibrium for the tev temperatures ( see , for instance , ref .",
    "consequently , the boltzmann equations for leptogenesis can be written as only one equation for the sum of the lepton flavors  @xcite .",
    "in other words , flavor effects  @xcite are not important in our framework .",
    "putting together all the qualitatively important effects discussed above and solving the relevant set of boltzmann equations , one can derive the following expression for the efficiency factor ( see , for instance , ref .",
    "@xcite ) : @xmath84 \\ , ,          \\label{eq : efficiency }      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath85 ,   @xmath86 is the number density of @xmath87 over the relativistic number density of rh neutrinos , and @xmath88 denote the various decay , scattering and washout terms respectively , defined in section iv . note that the expression above assumes @xmath89 with @xmath90 ,  where @xmath91 is the modified bessel function of the 2nd kind .",
    "this is a very good approximation in our model ( with large yukawa couplings ) .",
    "note also that we are neglecting spectator processes  @xcite and @xmath92 scatterings involving the higgs , which are both expected to lead to order one corrections .",
    "the final baryon asymmetry can be conveniently written as @xmath93 where the dilution factor @xmath94 takes into account the fraction of @xmath5 asymmetry converted into baryon asymmetry by sphaleron processes and also the dilution due to photon production from the onset of leptogenesis till recombination .",

    "( [ eq : eps ] ) was derived assuming heavy neutrino mass eigenstates .",

    ", we show the analytical expressions up to first order in @xmath14 for some simpler cases with only two quasi - dirac pairs and show explicitly that the @xmath8-asymmetry indeed vanishes in the @xmath98-conserving limit @xmath33 , as expected . for the general case with three quasi - dirac pairs",
    ", we numerically evaluate the @xmath8-asymmetry in the next section .",
    "we note that the three - pair case reduces to the two - pair case discussed in appendix b if one of the masses is much heavier than the other two and hence decouples from the rest .",
    "as noted in section ii , the yukawa couplings are fixed by the @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "the @xmath14 matrix can be deduced from the knowledge of the light neutrino masses and mixing angles as a function of the rh neutrino mass matrix @xmath25 , which can be taken to be diagonal without loss of generality .",
    "varying the rh neutrino mass eigenvalues input then leads to different @xmath14 matrices , keeping the light neutrino mass matrix given by eq .",
