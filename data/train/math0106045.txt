    "in this paper we derive explicit asymptotically sharp estimates for the constant of hlder continuity in the spherical metric of quasiconformal ( qc ) mappings .",
    "these results are based on reducing the problem to the euclidean metric case , where hlder continuity is well - known .",
    "the paper @xcite provides explicit estimates with some nice properties ( cflemma [ m1fv ] ) that will be shown to hold for the constants in the spherical metric also .    a similar , but more restricted ,",
    "result has previously appeared as lemma 4.1 of @xcite ( cited as lemma [ bonlem ] in this paper ) .",
    "this result gives an estimate for the hlder constant with respect to the spherical metric of planar quasiconformal mappings , which , however , is not asymptotically sharp as @xmath5 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in the next section the main results are stated , in section 3 the standard notation is reviewed and some explicit estimates pertaining to qc mappings are presented .",
    "section 4 contains various lemmas and the proof of the main results . in section 5 , an explicit bound for the hlder constant in the spherical metric of @xmath2-quasisymmetric real functions",
    "is derived .",
    "we first introduce some notation and terminology for the formulation of our main results . for a more complete account , see the following section .",
    "[ holcdef ] we define @xmath6 ( for @xmath7 ) to be the smallest constant such that the following inequalities hold for all @xmath8 and for all @xmath2-quasiconformal mappings @xmath9 , with @xmath10 , @xmath11 that satisfy the additional conditions indicated :    * @xmath12 * @xmath13 * @xmath14 * @xmath15    where @xmath16 and @xmath1 is the spherical metric ( defined in([qmetric ] ) ) .    for brevity ,",
    "we will write @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 . the two last definitions are to be understood as replacing the condition @xmath8   by the condition @xmath21 .",
    "we can also define analogous constants for @xmath22 , see section 5 .",
    "note that for @xmath23 we require that @xmath24 , whereas for @xmath25 we only have the normalization @xmath26 .",
    "the reason for this discrepancy will become clear in the proof of theorem [ m_3(2 ) ] .    [ m1fv ] ( @xcite , pp115 - 7 ) the constant @xmath25 has the following properties :    * @xmath27 as @xmath28 , * @xmath29 is bounded for fixed @xmath30 , * @xmath29 is bounded for fixed @xmath31    moreover , @xcite provides explicit estimates that exhibit the described behavior and shows that @xmath32 has properties ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) , and provides an explicit estimate . in terms of these constants",
    "we may state bonfert - taylor s result as    [ bonlem ] ( lemma 4.1 , @xcite ) @xmath33 .",
    "note that this constant does not satisfy the most important of the properties above , property ( 1 ) .",
    "however , this result proves property ( 2 ) for @xmath34 , but not property ( 1 ) , which is perhaps the most important .",
    "the main results of this paper show that ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) hold for @xmath23 and ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) hold for @xmath35 .",
    "@xcite also shows that @xmath32 does not satisfy ( 3 ) .",
    "unfortunately , we were unable to settle whether @xmath35 satisfies ( 2 ) .",
    "our results are stated in the following two theorems :    [ annthm ] let @xmath36 denote the grtzsch constant ( see @xcite , ( 8.38 ) ) , @xmath37 be as in lemma [ etaest ] and @xmath38 be as in lemma [ annlem ] .",
    "then @xmath39 where @xmath40 moreover , @xmath38 , and therefore @xmath35 , is asymptotically sharp for @xmath5 with this choice of @xmath41 . in particular , for @xmath42 , @xmath35 satisfies the quite crude estimate : @xmath43 this means that @xmath44 for @xmath42 .",
    "if we assume instead that @xmath45 we have the better estimates @xmath46    [ m_3(2 ) ] the constant @xmath23 satisfies ( 2 ) in lemma [ m1fv ] .",
    "in particular , @xmath47",
    "we denote by @xmath48 the standard basis of @xmath49 .",
    "the following standard notation will be used : @xmath50 @xmath51    we define the spherical metric @xmath1 by means of the canonical projection onto the riemann sphere , hence , for @xmath52 , @xmath53    we denote the dimension of the euclidean space under consideration by @xmath30 . till section 5",
    ", it is assumed that @xmath54 .",
    "the letter @xmath2 will denote the constant of quasiconformality of the arbitrary quasiconformal mapping @xmath55 ( of @xmath56 ) .",
    "more precisely , this entails the following assumptions : @xmath57 and @xmath58 is an acl homeomorphism , satisfying @xmath59 a.e .  in @xmath56 , where @xmath60 stands for the jacobian ( cf@xcite , theorem 9.9 ) .",
    "for ease of reference we define the classes @xmath61 and refer to mappings of this class as normalized @xmath2-qc mappings .",
    "note that for @xmath62 , @xmath63 consists of isometries only , that is , reflections in planes containing the @xmath64-axis and rotations about the same , by the constancy of the cross ratio under mbius mappings . from the definition",
    "it also follows that if @xmath65 then @xmath66 .",
    "let @xmath67 be a homeomorphism .",
    "let @xmath68 and @xmath69 be domains in @xmath49 .",
    "we say that a mapping @xmath70 is @xmath71-quasisymmetric if @xmath72 for all @xmath73 with @xmath74 .    [ etaest ]",

    "for @xmath54 and @xmath3 there exists a bijection @xmath75 such that every @xmath2-qc mapping of @xmath49 is @xmath37-qs , and @xmath37 satisfies the following bounds :    * @xmath76 * @xmath77 , for @xmath78 , * @xmath79 , for @xmath80 , * @xmath81 , for @xmath82 , * @xmath83 , for @xmath84    for the remainder of this paper let us write @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",

    "[ etaestimp ]    ( @xcite , 14.36 ( 4 ) ) for @xmath89 , we have the better estimate @xmath90",
    "the main results , theorems [ annthm ] and [ m_3(2 ) ] , will be proved in this section . to accomplish this , we first temporarily turn to a more general setting .",
    "suppose , therefore , that @xmath91 is an arbitrary @xmath92-bihlder continuous mapping with constant @xmath93 ( with respect to the euclidean metric ) .",
    "what can we say about the hlder continuity of @xmath91 with respect to the spherical metric ? in this general setting we may state the following lemma , which turns out to be asymptotically sharp for qc - mappings :    [ holderlem ] let for @xmath94 consider an arbitrary @xmath95bihlder continuous mapping , @xmath70 , fixing the origin ( which entails that @xmath68 and @xmath69 contain it ) .",
    "that is to say , there exists a @xmath96 such that @xmath97 for all @xmath98 .",
    "then @xmath91 is hlder continuous with respect to the spherical metric as well , in particular : @xmath99 where @xmath100 .    by ( [ qmetric ] ) , the second inequality of ( [ bihe ] ) is equivalent to @xmath101 and hence @xmath102 , where @xmath103 and the supremum is taken over @xmath104 and over all mappings @xmath91 that satisfy the assumptions . using the first inequality of ( [ bihe ] ) we conclude , by setting @xmath105 in ( [ bihe ] ) , that @xmath106 then , since @xmath96 and @xmath107 , we have @xmath108 to prove that @xmath109 we take the logarithmic partial derivative with respect to @xmath110 of both sides . since the left and right hand side of ( [ 1.5c ] ) are equal when @xmath111 , we only need to prove that the derivative of the left hand side is greater than that of the right hand side for @xmath112",
    "that is , we need to show that @xmath113 where @xmath114 .",
    "the left hand side has an infimum greater than @xmath115 and the right hand side the supremum @xmath116 , so we are done .",
    "note that a mapping can be @xmath110-bihlder continuous in the sense of ( [ bihe ] ) for @xmath117 only if @xmath68 and @xmath69 are bounded .",
    "[ qhcbn ] @xmath118    follows directly from lemma [ holderlem ] as @xmath55 is @xmath119-hlder continuous in @xmath120 with constant @xmath25 by definition .    from the lemmas [ m1fv ] and [ holderlem ] we derive the properties ( 1)-(3 ) for @xmath121 .",
    "it does not provide the hlder continuity throughout space .",
    "it is possible to remedy this shortcoming as will be shown , however , in doing so , we will loose property ( 2 )",
    ". therefore we first give an independent proof of property ( 2 ) .",
    "by lemma [ holderlem ] this is clear if @xmath122 or @xmath123 .",
    "let @xmath124 and @xmath125 and @xmath126 be given .",
    "we will prove that there exists a point @xmath127 in the intersection of the line through @xmath128 and @xmath129 with @xmath130 such that @xmath131 .",
    "let @xmath132 be the image of @xmath128 in the canonical projection of @xmath56 onto @xmath133 etc .",
    "then , by definition , @xmath134 and so on .",
    "let @xmath135 be the radius of the image of the line containing @xmath128 and @xmath129 under the projection .",
    "of the two possible @xmath127 s , we chose the one on the shorter arc joining @xmath132 and @xmath136 .",
    "then we need to show that @xmath137 let us differentiate the left - hand - side with respect to @xmath119 .",
    "we the find easily that the left - hand - side has a maximum at @xmath138 .",
    "we then have to show that @xmath139 .",
    "now this follows directly from the equation @xmath140 .    from lemma [ holderlem ]",
    "it follows that @xmath141 here we have used the fact that a continuous mapping has the same hlder constant for @xmath120 and @xmath142 .",
    "we combine the previous estimates and conclude that @xmath143 @xmath144 @xmath145 thus @xmath146 .",
    "note that this estimate is not asymptotically sharp .",
    "we now return to deriving an asymptotically sharp estimate and start by presenting an auxiliary lemma stating an explicit relationship between the constant and the domain of definition of the mapping :    [ annlem ] for @xmath7",
    "@xmath147    let @xmath126 and @xmath8 .",
    "define an auxiliary mapping @xmath91 by : @xmath148 since @xmath149 it follows from the definition of @xmath25 that @xmath150 which is equivalent to @xmath151 and thus , by lemma [ etaest ] , ( [ expannest ] ) holds with the constant @xmath152 indicated .",
    "now we will derive a new version of lemma [ holderlem ] , which incorporates the variability of @xmath152 in the proof and is thus specialized to quasiconformal mappings .",
    "[ holderlemqc ] let @xmath126 .",
    "then @xmath153 is hlder continuous with respect to the spherical metric with constant @xmath154 satisfying @xmath155    this is proved as lemma [ holderlem ] except that we will use different methods of estimating the upper bounc @xmath156 of @xmath157 .",
    "if @xmath158 we use the estimate @xmath159 in this case we easily see that @xmath160 . for @xmath161",
    "we have , by the hlder continuity of @xmath162 , @xmath163",
    ". then we proceed exactly as lemma [ holderlem ] to get @xmath164 .",
    "it follows that @xmath165 recall that in lemma [ holderlem ] the hlder constant in the spherical metric was shown to be less than @xmath166 so we are done .",
    "we are now in a position to derive easily the main result .    by lemmas [ annlem ] and [ holderlemqc ]",
    "the estimate holds for @xmath167 . since the inversion @xmath168 is a q - isometry",
    ", we conclude that the estimate holds also for @xmath169 .",
    "we now deal with the remaining case : @xmath170 .",
    "then @xmath171 the last inequality holds , since we may assume ( otherwise inequality ( [ expm_4est ] ) is trivial ) @xmath172 as @xmath173 . from this",
    "it follows immediately that @xmath174 which concludes the proof of ( [ expm_4est ] ) .    for asymptotical sharpness",
    "we still need to prove that @xmath175 when @xmath5 for @xmath41 as given in ( [ rdef ] ) , i.e. that @xmath176 at the limit .",
    "this follows from the following chain of inequalities :    @xmath177 thus we see that the bound of @xmath35 is asymptotically sharp .",
    "note how using this latter method does not give us a better explicit bound for @xmath23 than for @xmath35 .",
    "this is a consequence of our operating in euclidean space , where the sharper restriction of the mappings on the unit circle is not much different from only fixing unity as viewed   from near infinity .",
    "also note that already for quite small values of @xmath2 , the estimate in theorem [ annthm ] is worse that that in the proof of theorem [ m_3(2 ) ] .",
    "if @xmath2 is close to one , we may derive the following bound for @xmath178 in terms of our new constant @xmath179 : @xmath180 it is valid if @xmath181 .",
    "in particular , @xmath182 if @xmath183 . these claims are proved exactly as lemma [ holderlem ] so the proofs are omitted here .",
    "we see that from bounds on the hlder constants in the spherical metric we can derive bounds for the constants in the euclidean metric , as well as the other way around .",
    "in @xcite , a one parameter family of @xmath2-quasisymmetric ( qs ) functions is defined as those functions @xmath184 that satisfy @xmath185 for all @xmath128 and @xmath186 .",
    "we will now derive an explicit bound for the hlder constant in the spherical metric of this class of functions .",
    "the proof of this is similar to the existence proof given by lehto and virtanen ( @xcite , p. 57 ) , except that the following lemma will be used :    [ lehlem](@xcite ) let @xmath55 be @xmath2-qs in the sense of @xcite with constant @xmath2 .",
    "then @xmath55 can be extended to an @xmath187-qc mapping @xmath188 where @xmath189 and @xmath190 denotes the upper half - plane .",
    "the point @xmath128 lies in a region bounded by a line and a circle , as shown in figure 1a .",
    "this means that @xmath199 lies in a region bounded by two spheres , as shown in figure 1b .",
    "it is immediately clear that @xmath129 is as far from the origin as any other point in the region , so that @xmath200 .",
    "we calculate @xmath201 from @xmath202 and @xmath203 ( note that here @xmath119 refers to an angle as indicated in the picture , not to @xmath204 . )",
    "we subtract the second equation from the first to get @xmath205 now using this in the first equation gives us the desired formula @xmath206 .",
    "denote the symmetric @xmath212-qc extension of @xmath55 to a mappin from @xmath191 to @xmath191 by @xmath55 , again ( here we use lemma [ lehlem ] ) .",
    "we assume without loss of generality that @xmath11 and @xmath213 . since @xmath55 is @xmath212-qc , @xmath214 .",

    "therefore we may take @xmath223 in lemma [ auxlem ] to conclude that @xmath224 with @xmath196 the inversion in @xmath197 .",

    ". since @xmath55 fixes @xmath226 , @xmath91 fixes @xmath227 .",

    "let @xmath230 be a mbius transformation with @xmath231 and @xmath232 . then , since @xmath91 is symmetric in @xmath227 , @xmath233 .",
    "now @xmath230 is bilipschitz with constant @xmath234 ( see eg@xcite , chapter 1 , for these elementary mbius mapping results . ) since @xmath235 is @xmath212-qc and fixes @xmath227 , 0 and @xmath236 , we have @xmath237 , for @xmath238 by theorem 15.5 of @xcite .",
    "it follows from the bilipschitz property of @xmath230 that @xmath239 when we set @xmath240 and @xmath241 , we get @xmath242 for @xmath243 , which is what we wanted to show .",
    "[ conj ] the previous theorem could be extended to higher dimensions by using the extension result of @xcite instead of that of @xcite , which would allow us to derive estimates similar to those in the begining of this paper .",
    "this does not , however , give the explicit results that we have strived for ."
