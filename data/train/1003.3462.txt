    "in heavy fermion ( hf ) compounds , it is very common to establish the kondo energy scale @xmath5 from the linear coefficient of specific heat @xmath4 through rajan s formula @xmath5= @xmath6 derived for the degenerate ( @xmath7 2 ) kondo model@xcite where @xmath8 is the total angular momentum . in previous studies of the specific heat of the hf compounds ce@xmath0x",
    "( x = in , sn)@xcite which crystallize in the cu@xmath0au cubic structure , this formula was used to determine the kondo temperature , which was found to be 4.8 k for ce@xmath0 in and 16.7 k for ce@xmath0sn . the crystal electric field ( cef )",
    "excitation energy was estimated to be @xmath9=65 k.    most hf compounds reside close to a quantum critical point ( qcp)where antiferromagnetic ( afm ) or ferromagnetic ( fm ) correlations are present .",
    "this makes the previous analysis inappropriate in so far as it assumes that the magnetic correlations do not contribute to @xmath4 .",
    "indeed , the wilson ratios ( @xmath10 ) which were determined previously for ce@xmath0 in and ce@xmath0sn are 11.5 and 7.0 respectively@xcite , indicating that ferromagnetic correlations dominate the susceptibility .",
    "inelastic neutron scattering(ins ) experiments on single crystals of compounds that are close to a qcp , such as ceru@xmath11si@xmath11@xcite or ceni@xmath11ge@xmath11@xcite exhibit two classes of excitations . at",

    "similar behavior is observed in intermediate valence compounds for which it is clear that the behavior of the low temperature susceptibility , specific heat and ins spectra are close to the kondo impurity prediction , as though the onset of lattice coherence has only a minor effect on these measurements@xcite . near the qcp , however , large @xmath12-dependent scattering is observed with maximum intensity at the critical wavevector @xmath13 ( @xmath13 = 0 for fm and @xmath13 = @xmath14 for afm ) where ordering occurs in the nearby magnetic state .",
    "this scattering represents the short range order .",
    "it is dynamic and critically slows down , or softens , as the qcp is approached by lowering the temperature or changing a control parameter .",
    "these fluctuations affect the specific heat and can result in non - fermi liquid behavior .",
    "hence ins in single crystals can separate the kondo behavior from the contributions due to magnetic correlations . since the spectral weight in the magnetic correlations is typically small , ins in polycrystals will be dominated by the @xmath12-independent kondo scattering .",

    "we have also measured the low temperature magnetization to 13 t.    in the ce@xmath0x compounds , the ce ions sit on the face centers of the cubic lattice and are subject to a crystalline electric field ( cef ) of tetragonal symmetry . in this case , the hamiltonian is described as : +   + @xmath18 , +   + where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the crystal field parameters and steven operators , respectively .",

    "low energy transfer quasielastic scattering will also be observed if the instrumental resolution is adequate . from the ins spectra",
    ", the crystal field energies and wavefunctions can be determined from the ampitudes and energies of the excitations .",
    "the kondo effect , which arises from the hybridization of the 4 @xmath25-electron with the conduction electrons , broadens the peak line - widths proportional to @xmath26 . the quasielastic scattering peak width @xmath27 can be equated to the kondo energy @xmath26 of the ground state doublet .    in",
    "what follows , we will use the cef parameters and the kondo energies derived from the neutron scattering to calculate the kondo contribution to the specific heat , susceptibility and magnetization .",
    "all the kondo calculations utilized@xcite employ the same bethe - ansatz calculation , making intercomparison possible .",

    "this suggests zeeman splitting , where at zero field the splitting arises from the internal field in the regions of fm short range order , and where the applied field increases the splitting . to determine the internal field @xmath95",
    ", we calculate the schottky anomaly @xmath96 expected due to zeeman splitting of a doublet with the same effective @xmath70-factors as we have obtained from the neutron fits ; we then adjust @xmath95 until the peak temperature of the schottky anomaly is the same as that of the gaussian peak temperature for @xmath79 = 0 .",
    "this gives @xmath95 = 9.5 t. we then calculate @xmath97 to determine peak position of the schottky anomaly in an applied field @xmath98 .",
    "as can be seen in fig .",
    "6 ( f ) , the gaussian peak temperatures track the expected zeeman splitting very closely . on the other hand ,",
    "the temperature dependence of the schottky specific heat calculated in this manner is considerably broader than the gaussian contributions @xmath91 that are plotted in fig .",
    "this means that , while the contribution of the fm short range order to the specific heat is not of schottky form , the increase of the gaussian peak position is the same as the zeeman splitting expected for a total field @xmath99 given the effective @xmath70-factors .",
    "the entropy of the gaussian contribution is about 15 @xmath3 of rln2 for all fields .",

    "the specific heat does not change with field for @xmath106 9 t. the most likely explanation of this is that , as discussed above , the fm correlations make a smaller contribution than in ce@xmath0 in .",
    "the excess specific heat @xmath107 seen for @xmath108 6 k is presumably due to the cef contribution , which should be even broader in temperature in ce@xmath0sn than in ce@xmath0 in due to the larger kondo temperature .",

    "we can estimate that these fm correlations will have 10 - 15@xmath3 of the total spectral weight in @xmath12-space . since the large @xmath4 and the proximity to the qcp occurs when the kondo temperature @xmath111 17 k is fairly large , it is also reasonable to believe that when an appropriate control parameter ( e.g. alloying parameter x in ce@xmath112la@xmath113 in ) drives this system to the qcp , the kondo temperature @xmath114 will remain finite , as expected for example for a spin density wave type qcp .",

    "this behavior is that afm interactions between rare earth atoms on the face centers of the cu@xmath0au structure are frustrated .",
    "if , for example , the atoms at ( 1/2 1/2 0 ) and ( 1/2 0 1/2 ) are aligned antiferromagnetically , the atom at ( 0 1/2 1/2 ) will be free to point to any direction .",
    "ferromagnetic next - nearest - neighbor interactions could then stabilize ferromagnetism on this sublattice@xcite . in any case",
    ", the fm correlations appear to be generic to this crystal structure .    in conclusion ,",
