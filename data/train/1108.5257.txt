    "quantum antiferromagnet in two spatial dimensions has been a subject of intense research for multiple reasons .",
    "on one hand , the antiferromagnetic order parameter itself does not commute with the antiferromagnetic exchange interaction in the hamiltonian so that there exist inherent quantum fluctuations in the system . on the other hand , effects of quantum fluctuations",
    "are amplified as the size of the spin moment becomes smaller and the spatial dimension of the system gets lower .",
    "the antiferromagnetic spin-1/2 chain is the limiting situation where both reach their respective minimum possible values .",
    "indeed , the antiferromagnetic spin-1/2 chain demonstrates the strongest effect of the quantum fluctuation , which makes the ground state a gapless spin - liquid.@xcite while interesting in many aspects , the one - dimensional quantum antiferromagnet is too much susceptible to quantum fluctuations that it hardly displays any long - range order .    in this context ,",
    "the two - dimensional quantum antiferromagnet gives rise to perhaps the most interesting regime where the strength of quantum fluctuation is just so right that there is a delicate balance between order and disorder . on simple lattices , magnetically ordered states",
    "are often found to be energetically favorable .",
    "for example , the two - dimensional quantum antiferromagnet becomes ordered in the square lattice with staggered spin moments .",
    "the ground state in this case is known as the nel state .",
    "realizing quantum disordered states in two spatial dimensions requires a delicate way of tilting the balance between order and disorder .",
    "geometric frustration is often envisioned as an effective way to do just that .",
    "the kagome lattice is regarded as one of the most geometrically frustrated systems in two dimensions owing to the corner - sharing triangular structure , and therefore expected to be the best place to look for the quantum disordered state in spatial dimensions higher than one . indeed , in a recent experimental discovery of an  ideal \" kagome lattice realized in herbertsmithites , zncu@xmath0(oh)@xmath1cl@xmath2 ,  @xcite it is shown",
    "that the material remains magnetically disordered down to 50 mk while its curie - weiss temperature , a measure of the spin exchange energy , is about 300 k. this experimental finding strongly suggests that the ground state might be spin disordered even at zero temperature , providing a concrete example of fully quantum disordered states in two spatial dimensions . despite this strong suggestion for the existence , however , the precise nature of the spin disordered state is still unknown .    to construct a precise theory for the spin disordered ground state in the kagome lattice antiferromagnet ,",
    "it is crucial to use lessons obtained from numerical studies .",
    "following are some of the most important lessons from exact diagonalization .",
    "@xcite ( i ) the ground state is magnetically disordered .",
    "( ii ) the spin-0 excitation seems to have a very small gap or is completely gapless .",
    "( iii ) the spin-1 excitation has a small , but finite gap , which is @xmath3 in the @xmath4 system and estimated to be around @xmath5 in the thermodynamic limit . here , @xmath6 is the spin exchange energy .",
    "there are two possible candidates for the spin disordered ground state .",
    "@xcite one is the spin liquid state where spin moments are disordered without breaking any lattice translation symmetry .",
    "@xcite there are two variations within the spin liquid scenario , differing in whether the spin excitation is gapped or gapless .",
    "considering the results from exact diagonalization and recent density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) studies  @xcite , a gapped version of the spin liquid has a potential to be the true ground state .",
    "the other candidate is the so - called valence bond solid ( vbs ) order where spins are paired up with one of its nearest neighbors to form a spin singlet , consequently breaking the lattice translation symmetry .",
    "@xcite while earlier exact diagonalization as well as series expansion studies favor the vbs order , a recent study using the dmrg method  @xcite seems to indicate that the spin liquid may be closer to the true ground state .",
    "resolving the issue as to which state is really the true ground state for the pure heisenberg model is highly non - trivial and numerically subtle since many competing ground states are very close in energy .",
    "setting aside this issue , however , what is important is the fact that , due to the very proximity between various competing ground states , even a small deviation from the pure heisenberg model hamiltonian can cause significant changes in the ground state property . for example , it is shown in the same dmrg study mentioned above  @xcite that a slight reduction in @xmath6 by less than 2% in a particular pattern can in fact stabilize the vbs order with a 36-site unit cell rather than the spin liquid .",
    "in addition , there are various important experimental factors that modify the hamiltonian and thus play crucial roles in determining the true ground state .",
    "such factors include the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction , the lattice deformation , the presence of impurity spins , and so on . in this context , it is constructive to conduct a comprehensive investigation of all possible spin disordered states and study their properties .    in this paper , we focus on the vbs state with a 36-site unit cell illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig:36_site_unit_cell ] .",
    "spin singlet bonds , denoted as thick lines in the figure , represent the vbs ordering pattern with the 36-site unit cell ; this is believed to be the most favorable configuration by many of the previous studies .",
    "@xcite schematically speaking , the most favorable vbs order is the one with the honeycomb structure of perfect hexagons which in turn surround the pinwheel structure in the david - star shaped region at the core . here",
    "the perfect hexagon means that the sides of a hexagon is alternatively covered with three spin - singlet pairs .",
    "[ fig:36_site_unit_cell ] shows two possible honeycomb arrangements of the perfect hexagons with one having the staggered hexagonal resonance and the other the uniform hexagonal resonance . in the vbs order with staggered hexagonal resonance ,",
    "perfect hexagons have an alternating dimer covering pattern ( denoted as filled and empty circles inside the hexagon ) encircling the pinwheel structure .",
    "meanwhile , in the vbs order with uniform hexagonal resonance , all perfect hexagons have the same dimer covering pattern .",
    "note that the pinwheel structure itself can have two different orientations , which have exactly the same energy .",
    "the degeneracy between two such states is not lifted even after the pinwheel is coupled with surrounding dimers .",
    "this is in fact the origin of the gapless spin-0 excitations in the vbs scenario .",
    "we consider both the vbs order with staggered and uniform hexagonal resonance in this paper since they are equally good candidates for the most stable vbs order .",
    "the vbs state with uniform hexagonal resonance was previously studied by some of the authors within the bond operator theory ( bot ) .",
    "@xcite the bond operator theory provides a natural theoretical framework for the analysis of the valence bond solid state by regarding quantum states on a bond connecting the nearest - neighboring sites as fundamental quantum modes of the system . at the mean - field level ,",
    "such quantum modes are treated as effectively independent `` bond particles . ''",
    "while correctly producing the vbs order in the ground state , however , the bond operator theory turns out to be quantitatively inaccurate .",
    "in particular , the spin-1 excitation gap is predicted to be much larger than that obtained from exact diagonalization of the 36-site cluster while the ground state energy is not too bad considering the level of approximation .",
    "in addition , a peculiar property of the bond operator theory is that the lowest spin-1 excitations entirely originate from the surroundings [ light blue ( gray ) in the right figure of fig .",
    "[ fig:36_site_unit_cell ] ] that encircle the core pinwheel structure .",
    "this is a consequence of the bond operator theory that core dimers [ dark blue ( gray ) in the right figure of fig .",
    "[ fig:36_site_unit_cell ] ] are completely decoupled from the surrounding ones . while this conclusion may be fully consistent with series expansion results ,",
    "the large discrepancy in the lowest spin - excitation gap energy leaves the accuracy of the bond operator analysis in question .",
    "moreover , the bond operator theory predicts that the spin-1 excitations from the pinwheel structure are all degenerate with the energy gap being exactly @xmath7 .",
    "this is clearly not correct .",
    "while the problem certainly arises from the coarse nature of the mean - field approximation , there is no systematic way to improve the mean - field theory , especially for the `` hard - core '' constraint imposing that no two bond particles can occupy the same dimer site . in this paper , instead of",
    "looking for a perturbative way to include higher - order diagrams , we set out to improve the bond operator theory by extending the fundamental building block of the system from a bond to a more extended cluster of spins .    ]    to determine which spin clusters are most appropriate , it is worthwhile to investigate the nature of the inter - dimer interaction carefully . to this end , it is important to note that all inter - dimer interactions can be classified into two basic units according to their geometric structures : ( i ) topologically orthogonal and ( ii ) empty triangle structure .",
    "[ fig : inter_dimer_int ] for illustration . extended spin clusters can be constructed by the combination of these two basic units .",
    "next , by using exact diagonalization , we investigate how each basic structure affects the low - energy spectrum of the extended spin clusters . as a result",
    ", it is shown that the empty triangle structure mainly contributes to the lowering of the ground state energy while the topologically orthogonal structure stabilizes the ground state itself by reducing quantum fluctuations about the vbs order .",
    "we first test the bond operator theory as to how well it captures the effects of the topologically orthogonal as well as the empty triangle structure .",
    "the test shows that the bond operator mean - field theory is quite accurate for capturing the effects of the empty triangle structure while it is not so in the case of the topologically orthogonal structure .",
    "based on this result , we conclude that the most appropriate spin cluster is the one containing the maximal number of the topologically orthogonal structures allowed by the vbs order .",
    "an important assumption here is that , similar to the bond operator mean - field theory , the effects of all remaining empty triangle structures are well captured by the mean - field theory formulated in terms of the quantum modes formed in the extended spin clusters . for convenience ,",
    "let us call this approach the spin cluster operator theory ( scot ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : cluster covering ] shows spin cluster coverings for each type of the vbs order depicted in fig .  [ fig:36_site_unit_cell ] .",
    "as one can see , the vbs order with staggered hexagonal resonance is covered with one spin cluster for a david - star structure ( denoted as d ) and two spin clusters with each composed of a perfect hexagon and three attached dimers ( denoted as h1 and h2 )",
    ". meanwhile , the vbs order with uniform hexagonal resonance is covered with one spin cluster composed of a david - star and three attached dimers ( denoted as c ) and nine dimers for spin - singlets ( denoted as s1 , @xmath8 , s9 ) . here",
    "spin clusters are chosen according to the following three conditions : ( i ) the vbs order formed inside each individual spin cluster should be consistent with that of the whole lattice , ( ii ) the shape of spin clusters should preserve the symmetry of the vbs order , and ( iii ) spin clusters should include as many inter - dimer interactions with the topologically orthogonal structure as possible within themselves .",
    "there is one additional practical constraint in the choice of the above spin clusters , which comes from the technical problem that the size of the hilbert space grows exponentially as the number of spins increases . for this reason , in this study , we choose an appropriate subset of the unit cell as a spin cluster . for future work , we propose to investigate the `` super cluster '' that contains all topologically orthogonal structures within the whole unit cell .",
    "details of our proposal are discussed later in this paper .",
    "the ground state energy as well as the spin-1 excitation energy spectrum can be computed via mean - field analysis of the spin cluster operator theory . for the vbs order with staggered hexagonal resonance ,",
    "the ground state energy is given by @xmath9 per spin which is not too bad in comparison with the 36-site exact diagonalization result , @xmath10 , considering the coarse nature of the mean - field theory .",
    "the spin-1 excitation spectrum is found to be almost flat with very narrow band widths in the low energy sector .",
    "the lowest spin-1 excitation occurs at the k point in the first brillouin zone with the energy gap being @xmath11 .",
    "compared to the mean - field result of the bond operator theory for the same vbs order , @xmath12 , the above spin-1 excitation energy gap is in much better agreement with exact diagonalization . for the vbs order with uniform hexagonal resonance , the core cluster , denoted as c in fig .",
    "[ fig : cluster covering ] , is completely decoupled from the surrounding dimers , resulting in exactly the same ground state energy as that of the bond operator theory , @xmath13 per site .",
    "spin-1 excitations consist of two entirely separate groups with one coming from the core cluster and the other from the surrounding dimers .",
    "the lowest spin-1 excitation occurs from the core cluster with its energy gap being @xmath14 .",
    "this energy gap is also much reduced from the bot result for the same vbs order , @xmath15 .    despite these improvements , however , the spin-1 excitation energy gap is still somewhat higher than the exact diagonalization result . also , an important feature of the low energy excitations is that they predominantly originate from the triplet states within the pinwheel structure in fig .",
    "[ fig : cluster covering ] .",
    "this fact is at odds with the bond operator theory as well as previous series expansion studies . in combination with the reduced , but still larger size of the spin gap , this suggests that the effects of the topologically orthogonal inter - dimer interaction structures are not fully incorporated . expecting that the true low - energy spin excitations have contributions from both the pinwheel and its surroundings , we propose to use super spin clusters in future work , which treat spin excitations from the both contributions on a more equal footing .",

    "[ sec : summary ] .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , in this paper , the valence bond solid state with a 36-site unit cell is regarded as a candidate ground state for the kagome - lattice antiferromagnetic heisenberg model ( klahm ) : @xmath16 where @xmath17 denotes that @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the nearest neighbors . here",
    ", the spin exchange energy , @xmath6 , is positive since we are interested in the antiferromagnetic model .",
    "the vbs order with a 36-site unit cell has a dimer covering pattern represented by a honeycomb array of perfect hexagons with a pinwheel structure at the center of each cell .",
    "this particular pattern of the vbs order is generally believed to be the most favorable among various possibilities while the underlying physical reason why this is so varies from theory to theory .    with the vbs order composed of the two structures , ( i ) a honeycomb array of perfect hexagons and ( ii ) a pinwheel structure at the center of each honeycomb cell , different viewpoints occur regarding which structure plays a more important role for the stability of the vbs order .",
    "by using a duality mapping to the fully frustrated ising model , nikolic and senthil  @xcite advocated a viewpoint that the most preferred dimer covering is the one simultaneously maximizing the number of perfect hexagons and pinwheels ( or the 12-bond star - shaped flippable loops as called in the paper ) .",
    "another viewpoint is provided by singh and huse  @xcite who , by using series expansion , argue that the ground state energy is minimized when every three empty triangles are bound into perfect hexagons .",
    "such formed perfect hexagons are furthermore arranged in such a way that empty triangles between the nearest perfect hexagons share as many dimer bonds as possible .",
    "the resulting dimer covering is exactly the same honeycomb array of perfect hexagons as before . in this picture , the pinwheel structure at the center of the unit cell is just a simple byproduct of the overall covering pattern .",
    "some of the authors in this paper proposed a yet different viewpoint that the number of topologically orthogonal inter - dimer structures is maximized for the stability of the dimer covering pattern .",

    "<S> depending on two possible configurations of the vbs order , various spin clusters are considered : ( i ) in the vbs order with staggered hexagonal resonance , we consider one spin cluster for a david star and two spin clusters with each composed of a perfect hexagon and three attached dimers , and ( ii ) in the vbs order with uniform hexagonal resonance , one spin cluster composed of a david star and three attached dimers . </S>",
