    "the physics of topological defects , such as vortices , becomes especially intriguing at the interface between coexisting , topologically distinct phases of a macroscopically coherent system . due to different broken symmetries on either side , a defect can not perforate the interface unchanged .",
    "instead it must either terminate , or continuously connect across the boundary to an object representing a different topology .",
    "this situation arises , for example , at the interface between the @xmath0 and @xmath1 phases of superfluid liquid @xmath2he  @xcite , at interfaces between regions of different vacua in theories of the early universe  @xcite , in the physics of branes in superstring theory  @xcite , and in exotic superconductivity  @xcite .",
    "the parallels  @xcite between cosmological objects and defects in superfluids prompted the suggestion that analogues of cosmological phenomena can be studied in the laboratory  @xcite , for example the formation of defects in phase transitions  @xcite or properties of cosmic vortons ( superconducting cosmic strings  @xcite )  @xcite .",
    "current experimental techniques in atomic physics allow accurate measurements and precise control and manipulation of ultracold atomic gases by finely tuning electromagnetic fields . in spinor",
    "bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) , where the atoms retain their spin degree of freedom , experiments have demonstrated controlled preparation of coreless vortices and analogous non - singular textures formed by the nematic axis  @xcite .",
    "vortex nucleation in phase transitions  @xcite and dynamical formation of spin textures  @xcite have also been experimentally observed .",
    "simultaneously there has been a rapidly increasing theoretical interest in the wide variety of vortices , point defects and particle - like textures in two - component ( pseudospin-@xmath3 )  @xcite , as well as spin-1",
    "@xcite and spin-@xmath4  @xcite becs .",
    "this development brings multi - component systems of ultracold atoms to the forefront as candidate laboratories where properties of a variety of field - theoretical solitons ( see for exampel  @xcite ) may be studied .",
    "we have previously suggested  @xcite that spatially non - uniform manipulation of scattering lengths by optical or microwave - induced feshbach resonances can be used to study the physics of topological interfaces in ultracold atomic gases with spin degree of freedom .",
    "an example is the spinor becs , which exhibit distinct phases of the ground - state manifold . in the simplest case of a spin-1 bec",
    "there are two phases , polar and fm , and the sign of the spin - dependent interaction determines which phase is energetically favourable .",
    "we proposed that a combination of ( microwave or optical ) feshbach resonances and spatially - dependent ac - stark shifts can be used to enforce different signs of this interaction in different spatial regions of the same spin-1 bec , establishing a coherent interface between the phases . within this system , we formulated spinor wave functions corresponding to defect combinations that can be phase imprinted using existing techniques . by numerical simulation",
    "we found examples of energetically stable interface - crossing defects and complex core deformations , such as the formation of an arch - shaped half - quantum vortex on the interface .",
    "in addition , defects at an energetically established boundary in a two - component bec , where in one region the two components are miscible and in the other immiscible , have recently been studied in becs in  @xcite .    here",
    "we propose to employ precise spatial engineering of the zeeman shifts to create topologically dissimilar regions within a spinor bec , providing an experimentally simple route for studying defects and textures at the emerging topological interface .",
    "the ground state of the spinor bec generally depends on the linear and quadratic energy shifts of the zeeman levels . in the case of the spin-1 bec ,",
    "the zeeman shift can cause the condensate to adopt the fm phase even when the polar phase is favoured by the interactions , and vice versa  @xcite .",
    "in particular , we demonstrate that a stable , coherent , topologically non - trivial interface between fm and polar phases of a spin-1 bec can be established through spatially non - uniform linear or quadratic zeeman shifts .",
    "uniform ground - state solutions exist , for both polar and fm interaction regimes , that follow the variation of the zeeman shift ; the corresponding wave functions continuously interpolate between the polar and fm phases",
    ". we then analytically construct defect states that continuously connect defects and textures representing the topology of the fm and polar phases , such that the connection is provided directly by the spatial dependence of the zeeman energy shifts .",
    "we show that the modulation of the zeeman splitting allows the preparation of a rich family of interface - crossing defect solutions , with various combinations of singular ( integer and half - quantum ) and non - singular vortices , point defects , and terminating vortices . by numerical simulation , we determine the stability properties of the constructed solutions and determine their energy - minimizing core structures .    in the polar interaction regime ,",
    "the interface is established by a varying linear zeeman shift .",
    "examples of energetically stable interface - perforating defect configurations in a rotating trap include a singly quantized fm vortex line continuously connecting to a singly quantized polar vortex whose core splits into a pair of half - quantum vortices , as well as a polar vortex that terminates at the interface .    for a bec in the fm interaction regime ,",
    "a spatially varying quadratic energy shift is used to establish the interface between the polar and fm phases .",
    "we find an energetically stable , singular fm vortex that terminates at the interface .",
    "moreover , non - singular , coreless vortices in the fm phase become energetically favourable , and we find energetically stable structures where the coreless vortex continuously connects to a singly quantized vortex on the polar side of the interface .",
    "the unusual property of the singly quantized polar vortex in this configuration is the axially symmetric stable vortex core , in which the line singularity is filled with atoms in the fm phase , and the core is not split into a pair of half - quantum vortices .",
    "the existence of stable core structures of different symmetries in atomic spinor becs is reminiscent of the rich vortex core symmetries encountered in superfluid liquid @xmath2he  @xcite .",
    "for example , the core of a singular @xmath1-phase vortex may analogously retain a non - zero superfluid density by filling with the @xmath0 phase , either with an axially symmetric core  @xcite or by breaking the axial symmetry when forming a two - fold symmetric split core  @xcite .",
    "in the case of both fm and polar interactions we also find stable core structures of singular fm vortex lines terminating on a point defect in the polar phase .",
    "such a point defect is analogous to the t  hooft - polyakov monopole  @xcite and the combined defect configuration of the terminating vortex line and the point defect is closely related to boojums that can exist in superfluid liquid @xmath2he  @xcite .",
    "the core of the point defect minimizes its energy by deforming into a half - quantum line defect connecting at both ends to the interface .",
    "as the point defect , or the ` alice arch ' line defect , does not couple to the trap rotation , the defect experiences a trivial instability with respect to drifting out of the atom cloud as a result of the density gradient of the harmonic trap ( the order parameter bending energy of defects and textures generally favours lower atom densities ) , but can be otherwise stable .",
    "such an instability could be overcome by creating a local density minimum close to the trap centre by an additional optical potential  @xcite .",
    "the interface physics with the zeeman shifts provides several promising experimental scenarios .",
    "accurate tuning of zeeman shifts has been experimentally demonstrated in ultracold atoms  @xcite , and also applied to the study of spin textures  @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the control of multiple interfaces and their time - dependence could open up avenues for emulating complex cosmological phenomena in the laboratory .",
    "for instance , in superfluid liquid @xmath2he  @xcite or in a two - component bec system  @xcite it has been proposed that colliding interfaces or phase boundaries could mimic cosmic defect formation . in a spin-1 bec",
    "we could envisage , for instance , the following set - up : a disc of polar phase is created in an otherwise fm condensate by locally increasing zeeman shift .",
    "the two parallel fm - polar interfaces can then be interpreted as analogues of string - theoretical @xmath5-branes and anti - branes arising in theories of brane inflation  @xcite .",
    "removing the local zeeman shift causes the interfaces to collapse , simulating defect formation in brane annihilation scenarios .",
    "similar experiments have been performed with colliding superfluid @xmath2he @xmath0-@xmath1 interfaces  @xcite , where , however , observation of defects is more difficult .",
    "here we consider the engineering of a topological interface by manipulation of zeeman shifts in the context of a spin-1 bec . in the gross - pitaevskii mean - field theory ,",
    "the condensate wave function is a three - component vector @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the atomic density and @xmath8 is a normalized spinor ( @xmath9 ) in the basis of spin projection onto the @xmath10 axis .",
    "a magnetic field in the @xmath10 direction leads to linear and quadratic energy shifts of the zeeman sublevels , of strengths @xmath11 and @xmath12 respectively . the hamiltonian density",
    "may then be written as  @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the external trapping potential for the atoms .",
    "the local spin vector is given by the expectation value of the spin operator @xmath15 defined as a vector of spin-1 pauli matrices .",
    "the contact interaction between the atoms separates into spin - independent and spin - dependent contributions .",
    "the respective interaction strengths are @xmath16 and @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the atomic mass , and @xmath19 are the scattering lengths in the spin-@xmath20 channels of colliding spin-1 atoms .",
    "the interaction terms give rise to the density and spin healing lengths @xmath21 that describe the length scales over which perturbations of the atom density and the spin magnitudes , respectively , heal .",
    "when the zeeman shifts are not present ( @xmath22 ) , ( [ eq : hamiltonian - density ] ) is invariant under spin rotations .",
    "the ground state of the uniform system ( @xmath23 ) then exhibits two phases depending on the sign of @xmath24 . in the fm phase , favoured when @xmath25 ( e.g. , in @xmath26rb ) , the spin is maximized : @xmath27 for a uniform spin texture .",
    "all physically distinguishable , degenerate , ground states are then coupled by three - dimensional spin rotations .",
    "the family of fm spinors can therefore be parametrized as  @xcite @xmath28 where @xmath29 are euler angles defining the spin rotation such that @xmath30 .",
    "a condensate phase @xmath31 is absorbed by the third euler angle @xmath32 to form @xmath33 , and corresponds to spin rotations about the local spin direction .",
    "the order - parameter manifold , the broken symmetry in the ground state , is therefore @xmath34 , which supports only two distinct classes of line defects : singular , singly quantized vortices , and non - singular coreless vortices ( see [ sec : appendix ] ) .",
    "the polar phase with minimized spin , @xmath35 in the uniform texture , is favoured when @xmath36 ( e.g. , in @xmath37na ) .",
    "the degenerate ground states are then characterized by a macroscopic condensate phase @xmath31 and a unit vector @xmath38  @xcite : @xmath39 note that @xmath40 .",
    "these states are therefore identified , and hence @xmath38 should be understood as unoriented .",
    "the identification is reflected in the factorization by the two - element group in the corresponding broken ground - state symmetry @xmath41/\\mathbb{z}_2 $ ] .",
    "this so - called nematic order leads to the existence of half - quantum vortices [ e.g. ,  ( [ eq : hq ] ) ] . while all circulation - carrying vortices are singular in the polar phase , it is possible to form a non - singular _ nematic coreless vortex _",
    "@xcite , characterized by a fountain - like texture in @xmath38 [ e.g. ,  ( [ eq : nematic - coreless ] ) ] .    here",
    "we consider the case when either or both of the zeeman energy contributions are non - zero .",
    "the linear zeeman shift in a magnetic field @xmath42 is given by @xmath43 , where the land factor @xmath44 in the @xmath45 ground - state manifold of @xmath37na or @xmath26rb .",
    "the linear shift can be given a spatial dependence by careful engineering of the applied magnetic field @xmath46 .",
    "in alkali - metal atoms in the regime relevant to our considerations , the quadratic shift @xmath12 , which can be obtained from the breit - rabi formula  @xcite , is positive and smaller than @xmath11 .",
    "however , by combining a static magnetic field with an off - resonant microwave dressing field , accurate tuning of the quadratic energy shift can be achieved through the resulting ac - stark shifts  @xcite , or could be induced by lasers  @xcite .",
    "when the zeeman shifts are included , the coupled gross - pitaevskii equations for the spinor components @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) derived from ( [ eq : hamiltonian - density ] ) read @xmath49\\psi.\\ ] ] in a uniform system , these may be solved analytically  @xcite to find the stationary states .",
    "the zeeman shifts break the spin - rotational symmetry of the fm and polar ground states .",
    "one then finds , in addition to the purely fm state with @xmath50 and the polar state with @xmath51 , also the steady - state solution  @xcite @xmath52 where @xmath53 .",
    "the solution ( [ eq : zetap ] ) is valid provided that the linear zeeman shift is sufficiently small , such that @xmath54 .",
    "note that the expectation value of the spin is no longer zero , @xmath55 , and @xmath38 lies in the @xmath56 plane .",
    "for very weak linear zeeman shift @xmath11 , the expression then approaches the polar state @xmath57 . at the limit of validity ,",
    "on the other hand , it coincides with the fm solution @xmath58 for @xmath59 [ @xmath60 for @xmath61 .",
    "the spinor  ( [ eq : zetap ] ) also represents the lowest - energy state when @xmath36 and @xmath62  @xcite .",
    "hence in a condensate with polar interactions , such as for @xmath37na , ( [ eq : zetap ] ) provides an energetically stable solution that takes values between fm and polar phases , depending on the linear zeeman shift .",

    "the zeeman energy contribution can partially lift this degeneracy , but as we will consider non - uniform defect states in a rotating trap , ( [ eq : p - general ] ) provides the most suitable starting point for constructing the initial states for the energy minimization .",
