    "in 1989 , weiss , von klitzing , ploog , and weimann @xcite discovered the striking effect of a periodic potential varying in one direction on the magnetoresistivity of a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) .",
    "they observed that even a weak potential modulation ( grating ) with a wave vector @xmath0 induces very strong oscillations of the magnetoresistivity @xmath1 , while showing almost no effect on @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the oscillation period corresponds to a change of the ratio @xmath4 by unity , where @xmath5 is the cyclotron radius , and @xmath6 the grating wave length .",
    "these findings were explained by gerhardts _",
    "et al _ @xcite and winkler _ et al _ @xcite in terms of the quantum - mechanical band structure induced by the modulation ( see also @xcite for explanation of the weak oscillations induced by the grating in @xmath2 and @xmath3 and @xcite for discussion of the temperature dependence of the magnetoresistivity ) .",
    "beenakker @xcite presented a semiclassical theory of the effect .",
    "he showed that the geometric resonance of the cyclotron motion in the grating induces an extra contribution to the drift velocity of the guiding center , with a r.m.s .",
    "amplitude oscillating with period @xmath4 .",
    "these arguments were supported by an exact solution of the boltzmann equation , where isotropic scattering with a relaxation time @xmath7 was assumed . however , while accounting for the above experimental features , the theoretical results @xcite disagree strongly with the experiment as far as the damping of the oscillations with decreasing magnetic field is concerned . specifically , in the regime @xmath8 ( which is valid for the experimental value of the transport time @xmath7 in the whole range of the magnetic fields where the oscillations are observed ) the theory @xcite predicts a linear decrease of the oscillation amplitude , @xmath9 : @xmath10 here @xmath11 is the relative amplitude of the potential modulation @xmath12 , @xmath13 is the mean free path , @xmath14 the cyclotron frequency , @xmath15 the fermi energy , and @xmath16 the fermi velocity .",
    "in contrast with this result , the experimental damping is much stronger , so that only few oscillations ( @xmath17 in @xcite ) are observed .",
    "the problem of the damping of the weiss oscillations was addressed in a number of publications . in ref.@xcite",
    "an empirical observation was made that inclusion of the factor @xmath18 in eq.([e1 ] ) with @xmath19 being the total relaxation rate ( as opposed to the momentum relaxation rate @xmath20 ) yields a reasonable description of the experimentally observed damping .",
    "the authors of ref.@xcite argued quite oppositely that only the transport time should enter the expression for the damping factor , and proposed an empirical form @xmath21 $ ] , with a fitting parameter @xmath22 .",
    "monte carlo simulations @xcite , as well as numerical solution of the boltzmann equation @xcite , showed that allowing for anisotropic scattering leads to a stronger damping of the oscillations .",
    "however , despite considerable interest in this problem , no quantitative theory of the weiss oscillations for the experimentally relevant situation , when small angle scattering is dominant , has been available so far .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to fill in this gap .",
    "we begin by reminding the reader briefly about the boltzmann equation approach to the problem @xcite .",
    "one starts from the kinetic equation for the distribution function @xmath23 of electrons on the fermi surface , @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the direction of the electron velocity , @xmath26^{1/2}$ ] is the magnitude of the velocity , @xmath27 is the electron charge , and @xmath28 is the collision integral ( to be discussed below ) . in the absence of the grating , the solution is given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the drude conductivity tensor , @xmath31 @xmath32 , and @xmath33 is the density of states at the fermi level . using the ansatz @xmath34f^{(0)}+f^{(1)}$ ]",
    ", one may transform eq.([e4 ] ) into the form @xmath35 this implies that the grating induced correction to the conductivity tensor , @xmath36 , is given by @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the solution to the equation @xmath39 and the angular brackets @xmath40 denote the averaging over both the velocity direction and a period of the modulation , @xmath41 calculating now the resistivity tensor @xmath42 , one finds that @xmath43 , where @xmath44^{-1}$ ] and the only non - zero component of @xmath45 is @xmath46 given by @xmath47 for a weak modulation , @xmath48 , the corrections @xmath45 and @xmath49 are proportional to @xmath50 .",
    "therefore , to calculate the average @xmath51 in the leading order , one would have to solve the boltzmann equation ( [ e7 ] ) up to the second order in @xmath11 .",
    "however , it was observed by beenakker @xcite that the following identity holds : @xmath52 since @xmath53 , it is now sufficient to calculate @xmath38 to first order in @xmath11 , in order to find @xmath49 or @xmath45 to the order @xmath50 .",
    "we note that , while only presented for the isotropic scattering case in ref.@xcite , the identity ( [ e10 ] ) holds for a general collision integral @xmath28 as well , since its derivation uses only the fact that @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 .",
    "to proceed further , one has to solve the kinetic equation ( [ e7 ] ) .",
    "this requires first specifying the collision integral .",
    "its general form reads : @xmath57\\ , \\label{e11}\\ ] ] where @xmath58 is the scattering cross - section .",
    "the collision integral can be most conveniently characterized by its eigenvalues @xmath59 note that @xmath60 reflects the particle number conservation ; @xmath61 is the transport relaxation rate , while @xmath62 is the total relaxation rate .",
    "expanding the solution of eq.([e7 ] ) in the angular harmonics , @xmath63 , we get to the leading order in @xmath11 the following coupled system of equations @xcite : @xmath64 according to eqs.([e9 ] ) , ( [ e10 ] ) , the correction to the resistivity tensor is determined by @xmath65 , since @xmath66 in turn , @xmath65 is found from the system ( [ e13 ] ) as @xmath67 where @xmath68 is determined by the set of ( homogeneous ) equations ( [ e13 ] ) with @xmath69 , and @xmath70 . for a generic set of eigenvalues @xmath71 , the solution @xmath72 can be presented as a continuous fraction , @xmath73 the result can be expressed in closed form in the case when @xmath71 depends linearly on @xmath74 , @xmath75 $ ] with an arbitrary @xmath76 , yielding @xcite @xmath77 where @xmath78 .",
    "the two most important particular cases are @xmath79 , corresponding to a white - noise random potential ( isotropic scattering ) , and @xmath80 , describing the scattering by a white - noise random magnetic field with the scattering rate @xmath81 . in the next section",
    "we investigate @xmath46 in these two situations , exploiting the existence of the exact analytical solution ( [ e16 ] ) .",
    "this will give us a first example of how the small angle scattering ( dominant in the random magnetic field case , when @xmath82 ) modifies the magnetic field dependence of the amplitude of the weiss oscillations .",
    "using eqs . ( [ e13a ] ) , ( [ e14 ] ) , and ( [ e16 ] ) , we find for arbitrary values of the parameter @xmath76 @xmath83 for the particular case of isotropic scattering , @xmath79 , the following identity can be used to simplify eq.([e18 ] ) : @xmath84\\ .",
    "\\label{e19}\\ ] ] this allows us to reduce eq.([e18 ] ) to the form @xmath85 substituting ( [ e20 ] ) in ( [ e9 ] ) and assuming that @xmath11 is small enough so that @xmath86 ( this will be valid for all @xmath87 , if @xmath88 ) , we finally get @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the drude resistivity . eq.([e21 ] ) is completely equivalent to beenakker s result ( eq .",
    "( 5 ) of ref.@xcite ) , which is , however , presented in @xcite in the somewhat different form of an infinite series .",
    "the equivalence follows from the bessel function identity @xcite @xmath91    we will assume that @xmath92 , which is a necessary condition for the existence of oscillations . at @xmath93 ( i.e. in the oscillation region ) ,",
    "the asymptotic behavior of @xmath94 reads according to eq .",
    "( [ e21 ] ) @xmath95\\ , \\qquad \\pi / s\\gg 1 \\label{e24}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus , the amplitude of oscillations depends linearly on magnetic field @xmath87 in the high - field regime @xmath96 , and gets exponentially damped in @xmath97 , @xmath98 , in the lowest fields , @xmath99 .",
    "note that for a typical value of the transport time @xmath7 in the gaas heterostructures , @xmath100 , the condition @xmath101 corresponds to very low fields , @xmath102 .",
    "we turn now to the random magnetic field scattering , where @xmath80 . analyzing eq .",
    "( [ e18 ] ) in this case , we find the following two asymptotic regimes : @xmath103\\ , \\qquad 4q / s\\gg 1 \\label{e26}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] again eq.([e25 ] ) corresponds to a power - law behavior of the oscillation amplitude in the range of relatively high magnetic fields @xmath87 , while eq.([e26 ] ) describes the exponential damping of the oscillations in low fields .",
    "there is however a number of important differences between the results for the isotropic scattering [ eqs.([e23 ] ) , ( [ e24 ] ) ] and those for the random magnetic field scattering [ eqs.([e25 ] ) , ( [ e26 ] ) ] :    * the `` high '' field behavior ( [ e25 ] ) is @xmath104 , rather than @xmath105 as in eq.([e23 ] ) ; * the value of the magnetic field , at which the exponential damping starts , is much larger in the random magnetic field case ( @xmath106 ) , than for the isotropic scattering ( @xmath107 ) ; * the low - field damping is of a gaussian form ( with respect to @xmath97 ) in the random magnetic field case , @xmath108 $ ] , rather than of a simple exponential , @xmath109 , as in eq.([e24 ] ) .",
    "all these features are consequences of the small - angle scattering , dominant in the random magnetic field case . in the next two sections we will consider the weiss oscillations in the long - range correlated random potential , which also leads to small - angle scattering . since in this case the exact solution can not be expressed in a simple analytic form , we will use different methods to find the shape of the weiss oscillations .",
    "the random potential experienced by electrons of a 2deg in the gaas heterostructures is very smooth , since the impurities are separated from the 2deg layer by a relatively large distance ( spacer ) @xmath110 ( @xmath111 being the fermi wave vector ) . assuming that the positions of ionized donors are uncorrelated , while their density is equal to that of the electrons , @xmath112 , and treating the screening in the random phase approximation , one finds for the random potential correlation function @xmath113 in momentum space @xmath114 where @xmath115 is the density of states per spin orientation .",
    "the scattering cross - section in the born approximation is thus given by @xmath116 the total ( @xmath19 ) and the momentum ( @xmath20 ) relaxation rates are defined as @xmath117 so that their ratio is @xmath118 . both @xmath7 and @xmath119",
    "are experimentally measurable : the former is found from the _ dc _ conductivity at @xmath120 , while the latter follows from the dingle analysis of the damping of the shubnikov  de haas oscillations . for the structures of the type used in the weiss oscillation experiment @xcite ( @xmath121 , @xmath122 ) , their typical values are @xmath123 , @xmath124 , so that the ratio @xmath125 is large , in agreement with the theory .",
    "note , however , that the experimental values of @xmath7 and @xmath119 are usually somewhat different from the theoretical estimates ( [ e29 ] ) , ( [ e30 ] ) .",
    "this was attributed to correlations between the positions of the scatterers @xcite .",
    "below we will express our results for the damping of the weiss oscillations in terms of @xmath7 and @xmath119 , so that for comparison with experiment one should simply use the experimental values of these quantities .    as was shown in @xcite , the physical origin of the oscillations",
    "can be traced to the additional contribution to the drift velocity of the guiding center , @xmath126 where @xmath127 is the @xmath128-coordinate of the guiding center and @xmath129 is the electric field induced by the grating .",
    "averaging @xmath130 over @xmath127 , one finds @xcite : @xmath131 for @xmath132 , the oscillations are determined by the interference of the contributions from the vicinities of the saddle points @xmath133 , @xmath134 ( and vice versa ) , leading to @xmath135 ( in this section we do not keep power - law prefactors , since we calculate the exponential damping factor only ) .",
    "impurity scattering leads to a change @xmath136 of the guiding center position @xmath127 during the time an electron moves along the cyclotron orbit from @xmath137 to @xmath138 .",
    "this introduces in eq.([e33 ] ) a damping factor @xmath139 for isotropic scattering , any scattering event kicks an electron far away from its original cyclotron orbit , so that @xmath140 is determined simply by the probability for an electron to remain unscattered during the half cyclotron period time @xmath141 , yielding @xmath142 , in agreement with eq.([e24 ] ) .",
    "the situation is , however , different when the scattering is of small - angle character , so that even after one or several scattering events an electron remains close to its original cyclotron orbit and contributes to the oscillations .",
    "we first consider the random magnetic field scattering .",
    "since in this case the exact solution has been found ( eq.([e26 ] ) , this will be an additional check for the correctness of our method of calculation in this section .    in this case",
    ", the probability for an electron to be scattered by an angle @xmath143 in a small time interval @xmath144 is given by @xcite @xmath145 scattering by the angle @xmath146 changes the position @xmath127 of the guiding center by @xmath147 , so that @xmath148 where @xmath149 ; @xmath150 ; @xmath151 ; @xmath152 .",
    "according to eq.([e35 ] ) , @xmath153 therefore , the damping factor @xmath140 is equal to @xmath154 in precise agreement with the exact solution , eq.([e26 ] ) .",

    ", the scattering cross - section ( [ e28 ] ) implies that the distribution function of the scattering angles @xmath146 in a time interval @xmath144 is given by @xmath155 therefore , @xmath156 this leads to the following result for the damping factor @xmath157\\right\\}\\ .",
    "\\label{e41}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as is seen from eq.([e41 ] ) , the region of exponentially damped oscillations can be further subdivided into two regimes : @xmath158 at @xmath159 and @xmath160 at @xmath161 . in the former the leading contribution to @xmath140",
    "comes from multiply scattered carriers , while in the latter @xmath140 is governed by those electrons , which remain unscattered within the time @xmath141 .",
    "the exponential damping found in the above is efficient at low enough magnetic fields , @xmath162^{1/3}$ ] . at stronger magnetic fields ,",
    "the @xmath87-dependence of @xmath46 is of a power - law nature .",
    "this will be considered in the next section using a different method .",
    "to find the grating - induced correction to the resistivity at relatively strong fields , we return to the boltzmann equation approach of sec.[s2 ] . for the scattering cross - section ( [ e28 ] )",
    "the eigenvalues @xmath163 of the collision integral are equal to @xmath164 the approximation we will make at this point will be to consider the limit @xmath165 , which reduces eq.([e42 ] ) to @xmath166 .",
    "this approximation is valid for not too small magnetic fields , such that @xmath167 , where the total relaxation rate @xmath119 is irrelevant , and only the transport one , @xmath7 , is important .",

    "\\label{e51}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] finally all the three regimes can be described by a single formula of the form ( [ e50 ] ) with @xmath194 \\label{e52}\\ ] ]    let us also note that the behavior of @xmath46 at @xmath195 ( i.e for magnetic fields stronger than those generating the oscillations ) is the same for all the types of scattering , @xmath196 as is easily found from eqs .",
    "( [ e18 ] ) , ( [ e21 ] ) , ( [ e46 ] ) . in reality , in most of the weiss oscillation",
    "experiments the magnetoresistivity at such strong fields is strongly affected by the shubnikov - de haas oscillations and by the quantum hall effect .",
    "however , the giant quadratic magnetoresistance ( [ e53 ] ) was observed in the experiment @xcite , where the measurements were performed at somewhat higher temperatures .",
    "now we evaluate the boundaries @xmath197 , @xmath198 of the regions with different behavior of the oscillation amplitude in a typical experimental situation .",
    "we find from the parameters of the sample of ref.@xcite ( @xmath199 , @xmath200 , @xmath201 ) the transport time @xmath202 .",
    "furthermore , a typical value of the total relaxation rate for such structures is @xcite @xmath203 ( as we will see below , with this value of @xmath119 our results perfectly describe the experimentally observed damping of the oscillations in low fields ) .",
    "this gives the following crossover values : @xmath204 , @xmath205 .",
    "for a higher mobility sample studied in ref.@xcite ( the weiss oscillation data are presented there in the inset of fig .",
    "1 ) these values are somewhat larger : @xmath206 , @xmath207 .",
    "we conclude that although parametrically @xmath208 is large at @xmath209 , for realistic parameters @xmath198 and @xmath197 are numerically close to each other .",
    "therefore , the regime ( ii ) corresponds in reality to a rather narrow intermediate domain between the regime ( i ) describing the fast ( @xmath210 ) drop of @xmath46 in high fields , and the regime ( iii ) corresponding to the @xmath18 damping of the oscillatory part of @xmath46 in low fields .    in fig.1",
    "we compare our theoretical results with experimental data of weiss _ et al _ @xcite .",
    "the sample parameters are @xcite @xmath199 , @xmath200 , @xmath202 , the total relaxation rate is taken to be @xmath211 .",
    "as is seen from the figure , with the modulation strength @xmath212 we get a very good description of the experimentally observed magnetoresistivity @xcite .    to illustrate the difference between the long - range potential scattering and the isotropic scattering , we plotted in fig.2 the corresponding results for the modulation - induced resistivity correction at the same value of the transport time @xmath7 .",
    "it is seen that the results for these two different scattering mechanism differ drastically not only in low magnetic fields ( where the small - angle scattering leads to the exponential damping of oscillations ) , but also in high fields ( due to the different power - law dependence of @xmath46 on @xmath87 ) . in particular , already at the first maximum of @xmath46 ,",
    "the value of the correction is smaller by factor of a @xmath213 for the long - range random potential scattering , as compared to the isotropic scattering case , at the same value of the grating strength @xmath11 . for the second maximum",
    "this ratio is already a factor of @xmath214 , etc . as a consequence ,",
    "one generates a considerable error when trying to evaluate the modulation strength by fitting the amplitude of one of the first maxima by the white - noise random potential results .",
    "for example , beenakker @xcite underestimated @xmath11 by factor of 3 @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we have presented a theory of the weiss oscillations of the magnetoresistivity in a 2deg , for the case when the impurity scattering is predominantly of the small - angle nature .",
    "while this is precisely the experimental situation in currently fabricated semiconductor heterostructures , no quantitative theoretical description of this case has been available so far .",
    "previous theories @xcite assumed the scattering to be isotropic .",
    "we have shown that the small - angle scattering strongly affects the shape and the damping of the weiss oscillations .",
    "this was demonstrated both for the scattering by a white - noise random magnetic field ( linearly increasing eigenvalues @xmath215 of the collision integral ) and for long - range random potential scattering ( @xmath216 $ ] ) . in the latter case , which was of primary interest for us , the shape of the magnetoresistivity",
    "is determined by both the momentum and the total relaxation rates ( @xmath20 and @xmath19 , respectively ) , and has the following features . in relatively strong magnetic fields",
    "@xmath87 , the amplitude of the modulation induced correction @xmath46 falls of as @xmath183 with decreasing @xmath87 , i.e. much more rapidly , than in a white - noise random potential , where @xmath217 .",
    "this rapid fall - off is determined by the quadratic increase of the eigenvalues @xmath218 for not too large @xmath219 . in low magnetic fields ,",
    "the oscillatory part of the magnetoresistivity is found to be exponentially damped , much more efficiently than in the case of isotropic scattering with the same @xmath7 .",
    "the low - field damping factor is of the form @xmath220 , familiar from the theory of the shubnikov - de haas oscillations .",
    "let us stress , however , that while the shubnikov - de haas oscillations are of purely quantum nature , the weiss oscillations represent a classical effect .",
    "nevertheless , due to the interplay of the finite modulation wave vector @xmath221 and the cyclotron radius @xmath5 , the resistivity correction @xmath46 is determined by the whole spectrum of eigenvalues @xmath163 of the collision integral ( and , in particular , by @xmath62 ) , rather than by @xmath61 only ( governing conventional transport in the absence of modulation ) .",
    "finally , our results describe nicely the shape of the experimentally observed magnetoresistance and the dependence of the oscillation amplitude on the magnetic field .",
