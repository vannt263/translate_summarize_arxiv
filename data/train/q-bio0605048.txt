    "there has been much interest in understanding the rates of protein folding in terms of transition state structures .",
    "we focus here on two - state proteins , i.e.  those proteins that fold with single - exponential kinetics .",
    "the folding kinetics of two - state proteins is often investigated by mutational analysis @xcite .",
    "the effect of a given mutation on the protein s folding kinetics is quantified by its @xmath0-value @xcite @xmath3 here , @xmath4 is the folding rate for the wildtype protein , @xmath5 is the folding rate for the mutant protein , and @xmath6 is the change of the protein stability induced by the mutation .",
    "the stability @xmath7 of a protein is the free energy difference between the denatured state @xmath8 and the native state @xmath9 . in classical transition - state theory ,",
    "the folding rate of a two - state protein is proportional to @xmath10 $ ] , where @xmath11 is the free energy difference from the denatured state to the transition state . in that notation , @xmath0-values have the form @xmath12 where each @xmath13 in this expression represents the change due to the mutation .",
    "by definition , @xmath0-values are energetic quantities , related to changes in the protein s stability and folding rate . do @xmath0-values also give information about the structures that the protein adopts when it is in a kinetic `` bottleneck '' or transition state @xcite ? in the traditional interpretation , @xmath0-values are taken to indicate the _ degree of structure formation of the mutated residue in the transition - state ensemble t. _ a @xmath0-value of 1 is interpreted to indicate that the residue is fully native - like structured in t , since the mutation shifts the free energy of the transition state t by the same amount as the free energy of the native state n. a @xmath0-value of 0 is interpreted to indicate that the residue is as unstructured in t as in the denatured state d , since the mutation does not shift the free energy difference between these two states .",
    "@xmath0-values between 0 and 1 are taken to indicate partial native - like structure in t.    modelers often calculate @xmath0-values based on this traditional interpretation . in many approaches ,",
    "@xmath0-values are calculated from the fraction of contacts a residue forms in the transition state t , compared to the fraction of contacts in the native and the denatured state @xcite , or from similar structural parameters @xcite .",
    "notable exceptions are a recent md study of an ultrafast mini - protein in which @xmath0-values are calculated from rates for the wildtype and mutants via eq .",
    "( [ phi ] ) @xcite , and the calculation of @xmath0-values from free energy shifts of the transition - state ensemble using eq .",
    "( [ phi2 ] ) @xcite .    however , there are reasons to question this simple interpretation of @xmath0-values . first , some @xmath0-values are negative or larger than 1 @xcite .",
    "these ` nonclassical ' @xmath0-values can not be interpreted as a degree of structure formation , because this would have the nonsensical implication of ` less structured than @xmath8 ' or ` more structured than @xmath9 ' .",
    "second , @xmath0-values are sometimes significantly different for different mutations at a given chain position , contradicting the normal assumption that the degree of nativeness of the transition state is just a property of the position of a monomer in the protein .",
    "third , @xmath0-values for neighboring residues within a given secondary structure often span a wide range of @xmath0-values . in the traditional interpretation",
    ", this means that some of the helical residues are unstructured in the transition state , while other residues , often direct neighbors , are highly structured .",
    "this contradicts the notion that secondary structures are cooperative .",
    "the inconsistencies of the traditional interpretation result from the assumption that the mutation - induced free energy changes of a residue are proportional to a single structural parameter , the ` degree of nativeness ' of this residue in the transition state t. is there a consistent structural interpretation of @xmath0-values , and if yes , how many structural parameters do we need to capture the mutation - induced free energy changes ?",
    "we show here that the @xmath0-values for multiple mutations in a given helix can be consistently interpreted in a simple physical model that takes into account just two structural parameters for the whole helix : @xmath14 , the _ degree of secondary structure formation of the helix in the transition - state ensemble t _ , and @xmath15 the _ degree of tertiary structure formation of the helix in t_. in our model , the mutation - induced free energy changes are split into two components .",
    "the overall stability change @xmath16 is split into two parts : the change in intrinsic helix stability @xmath17 , and the change in tertiary free energy @xmath18 caused by the mutation .",
    "similarly , @xmath19 , the change of the free energy difference between the transition state and the denatured state , is split into a change @xmath20 in secondary free energy , and a change @xmath21 in tertiary free energy .",
    "the @xmath0-values for the mutations in the helix then have the general form @xmath22 the second expression simply results from replacing @xmath18 by @xmath23 .",
    "the two parameters @xmath14 and @xmath15 of our model are ` collective ' structural parameters for all mutations in the helix .",
    "different @xmath0-values then simply result from different free - energetic ` signatures ' @xmath17 and @xmath16 of the mutations . in particular , eq .",
    "( [ phi_modeled ] ) captures that different mutations of the same residue can lead to different @xmath0-values , and that @xmath0-values can be ` nonclassical ' , i.e.  @xmath1 or @xmath2 . since the two structural parameters @xmath14 and @xmath15 range between 0 and 1 , a nonclassical @xmath0-value implies that the changes @xmath17 and @xmath18 in secondary and tertiary free energy caused by the mutation have opposite signs .    to apply our model",
    ", we first estimate @xmath17 , the change in helical stability , for each mutation in a particular helix , using standard helix propensity methods .",
    "we then plot all experimental values for @xmath0 versus @xmath24 , and obtain the two structural parameters @xmath14 and @xmath15 from a linear fit of eq .",
    "( [ phi_modeled ] ) . in principle , the two structural parameters can be extracted if @xmath0-values and stability changes for at least two mutations in a helix are available . however , to test our model , and to obtain reliable values for @xmath14 and @xmath15 , we focus here on helices for which more than 10 @xmath0-values have been determined .",
    "the modeling quality then can be assessed from the standard deviation of the data points from the regression line , and from the pearson correlation coefficients between @xmath0 and @xmath24 .",
    "our model can be applied to all mutations for a helix , or to a subset of mutations that affect only the tertiary interactions with one other structural element .",
    "we model the transition state as an ensemble of @xmath25 different conformations ( see fig .  [ figure_ts ] ) .",
    "each transition - state conformation is directly connected to the native state n and to the denatured state d. the model thus has @xmath25 parallel folding and unfolding routes .",
    "we assume that the protein is stable , i.e.  that @xmath26 .",
    "we also assume that the free energy barrier for each transition state conformation is significantly larger than the thermal energy , i.e.  that @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "the rate of folding along each route @xmath28 is then proportional to @xmath29 $ ] , and the total folding rate as the sum over all the parallel routes is @xmath30 where @xmath31 is a constant prefactor .",

    "the effect of these mutations on the stability and folding kinetics can be experimentally characterized by the stability changes @xmath16 , and by the @xmath0-values .",
    "we suppose that the experimentally measured change in stability @xmath16 for each mutation is the sum of effects on the stability of the helix and on the interactions of the helix with its tertiary neighbors : @xmath35 the first term , @xmath17 , is the change in the intrinsic helix stability .",
    "the term , @xmath18 , is the change in tertiary free energy of the helix interactions with neighboring structures .",
    "below , we estimate @xmath17 using either the program agadir @xcite or from a helix propensity scale @xcite .",
    "the term @xmath18 is then simply obtained by subtracting @xmath17 from the experimentally measured stability change , @xmath16 .",
    "we also decompose each @xmath36 , the mutation - induced free energy change for the transition state conformation @xmath28 , into two terms : @xmath37 here , @xmath38 is either 0 or 1 , depending on whether the helix is formed or not in the transition state conformation @xmath28 .",

    "values of @xmath14 between 0 and 1 indicate that the helix is formed in some of the transition - state conformation , and not formed in others .",
    "the term @xmath15 represents the boltzmann - weighted average of the tertiary structure parameter @xmath39 in t , and also ranges from 0 to 1 . from eq .",

    "( [ phi_modeled ] ) , we do nt have to assume that the tertiary parameters @xmath39 for the @xmath28 transition - state conformations are independent of the residue position and/or mutation .",
    "however , we focus here on the simplest version of our model and show that a consistent structural interpretation of experimental @xmath0-values in a helix can be obtained with just two structural parameters @xmath14 and @xmath15 for the whole helix , which implies a cooperativity of secondary as well as tertiary interactions . ]    more than twenty two - state proteins with @xmath51 @xcite , @xmath34-helical @xcite , or all-@xmath52 structures @xcite have been investigated by mutational analysis in the past few years .",
    "mutational data are also available for several proteins that fold via intermediates @xcite or apparent intermediates @xcite .",
    "we focus here on the well - characterized @xmath34-helices of two - state proteins for which at least 10 @xmath0-values apiece are available : the helices 2 and 3 from the protein a , and the helices of ci2 and protein l. protein a is an @xmath34-helical protein with three helices , ci2 and protein l are @xmath51-proteins with a single @xmath34-helix packed against a @xmath52-sheet .",
    "our analysis of experimental @xmath0-values requires an estimate of the mutation - induced changes @xmath17 of the intrinsic helix stability . in the case of the ci2 helix",
    ", we estimate @xmath17 both with the program agadir @xcite and from a helix propensity scale @xcite , see table 1 .",
    "the change in intrinsic helix stability @xmath17 can be estimated from the helical content predicted by agadir via @xmath53 . here",
    ", @xmath54 is the helical content of the wildtype helix , and @xmath55 the helical content of the mutant .",
    "the program agadir is based on helix / coil transition theory , with parameters fitted to data from circular dichroism ( cd ) spectroscopy . in table 1 , the values for @xmath17 obtained from agadir are compared to values from a helix propensity scale @xcite .",
    "helix propensities of the amino acids are typically given as free energies differences with respect to alanine .",
    "we use the propensity scale of pace and scholtz @xcite , which has been obtained from experimental data on 11 different helical systems .",
    "for example , the value @xmath56 kcal / mol for the mutant e15d in the ci2 helix is simply the difference between the helix propensity 0.69 kcal / mol for the amino acid d ( aspartic acid ) and the propensity 0.40 kcal / mol for amino acid e ( glutamic acid ) . the helix propensity scale can be applied for residues at ` inner ' positions of a helix , not for residues at the termini or ` caps ' of the helix .",
    "the n - terminal residues of the ci2 helix are the residues 12 and 13 , the c - terminal residues are the residues 23 and 24 .",
    "for the 8 mutations at ` inner positions ' of the ci2 helix , the values for @xmath17 from agadir and from the helix propensity scale correlate with a pearson correlation coefficient of 0.77 . for the other three helices considered here , the helicities predicted by agadir are significantly smaller than the helicities around 5 % predicted for the ci2 helix .",
    "estimates for @xmath17 based on agadir therefore are not reliable for these helices .",
    "the values of @xmath17 shown in the tables 2 to 4 are calculated from helix propensities .",
    "the three structural elements of protein a are its three helices . based on the contact map of protein a shown in fig .",
    "[ map_proteina ] , the mutations in helix 2 of protein a can be divided into three groups : ` purely secondary ' mutations that do nt affect tertiary contacts ; mutations that affect only tertiary contacts with helix 1 ; and mutations that affect tertiary contacts both with helix 1 and 3 .",
    "if only the first two groups of mutations are considered in our analysis , @xmath15 represents the average degree of structure formation with helix 1 .",
    "if all groups and , thus , all mutations are considered , @xmath15 is the average degree of structure formation with the helices 1 and 3 . in the case of helix 3 , we distinguish between mutations that affect either tertiary contacts with helix 1 or helix 2 , or none of the tertiary interactions , see table 3 . in the case of the protein l helix ,",
    "the two other structural elements are the terminal @xmath52-hairpins , see fig .",
    "[ map_proteinl ] and table 4 . in the case of ci2",
    ", we do not distinguish between different tertiary contacts .",
    "one reason is that there are at least three other structural elements to consider , the three strand pairings @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 of the four - stranded @xmath52-sheet that is packed against the ci2 helix @xcite .",
    "another reason is that the degree @xmath15 of tertiary structure formation in the transition state is small for this helix .    the structural parameters @xmath14 and @xmath15 obtained from our analysis shown in the figs .",
    "[ helix_ci2 ] to [ helix_proteinl ] are summarized in table 5 .",
    "we estimate the overall errors of @xmath14 and @xmath15 , which result from experimental errors in @xmath0 and @xmath16 and from modeling errors , as @xmath60 for the ci2 helix and helix 2 of protein a , and as @xmath61 for helix 3 of protein a and the protein l helix .",
    "the @xmath14 values for the ci2 helix and the helix 2 of protein a are close to 1 .",
    "this indicates that the helices are fully formed in the transition - state ensemble .",
    "in contrast , @xmath14 for helix 3 of protein a is close to 0 , indicating that the helix is not formed in the transition state .",
    "@xmath14 for the helix in protein l indicates a partial degree of helix formation between 20 and 30 % .",
    "our @xmath15 values indicate that the degree of tertiary structure formation in the transition state is around 16 % for the ci2 helix , around 50 % for helix 2 of protein a , and around 30 % for helix 3 of protein a. the @xmath15 values for the protein l helix show a small degree of tertiary structure formation with hairpin 1 ( around 15 % ) and no tertiary structure formation with hairpin 2 .",
    "to assess the quality of our modeling , we consider two quantities : the correlation coefficient @xmath62 , and the estimated standard deviation sd of the data points from the regression line .",
    "high correlation coefficients up to 0.9 and larger indicate a high quality of modeling . however , it s important to note that the correlation coefficient can only be used to assess the modeling quality in the cases where the structural parameters @xmath14 and @xmath15 are sufficiently different from each other .",
    "the case @xmath63 corresponds to a regression line with slope 0 , and hence a correlation coefficient of 0 , irrespective of how well the data are represented by this line . for small differences of @xmath14 and @xmath15 ,",
    "the correlation coefficient @xmath62 is dominated by the experimental errors in @xmath0 .",
    "this is the case for the mutations in the protein l helix that affect tertiary contacts with hairpin 1 , see table 5 .",
    "the slope of the regression line is almost zero for this data set , see fig .",
    "[ helix_proteinl ] . here",
    ", the relatively small standard deviation 0.1 of the data points from the regression lines indicates that our model is in good agreement with the experimental data .",
    "we only consider here mutations with stability changes @xmath64 kcal / mol .",
    "because of experimental errors , @xmath0-values for mutations with smaller stability changes are generally considered as unreliable @xcite . in our previous work @xcite , we considered all the published mutations for the ci2 helix , including those for which @xmath16 is significantly smaller than 0.7 kcal / mol .",
    "the correlation coefficient 0.91 obtained here for the subset of mutations with @xmath64 kcal / mol is larger than the correlation coefficient 0.85 for all mutations .",
    "the significantly larger reliability threshold of 1.7 kcal / mol for @xmath16 obtained by sanchez and kiefhaber @xcite is based on the assumption that different mutations at the same residue position should lead to the same @xmath0-value . in our model ,",
    "different @xmath0-values for mutations at the same site result from different effects on the intrinsic helix stability @xmath65 and the tertiary free energy @xmath66 .    in our model , nonclassical @xmath0-values @xmath1 or @xmath2 can arise if @xmath67 is @xmath1 or @xmath2 .",
    "since @xmath68 , this implies that @xmath17 and @xmath18 have opposite signs .",
    "our model reproduces the clearly negative @xmath0-values for the mutations d23a in the ci2 helix and d38a in the protein l helix .",
    "both mutations stabilize the helix ( i.e.  @xmath69 ) , but destabilize tertiary interactions ( @xmath70).-values can arise for mutations that only shift the free energy of the denatured state , but not the free energy of the transition state and native state .",
    "this is not the case .",
    "indeed , the @xmath0-value for these hypothetical mutations is 1 since @xmath71 . ]",
    "we have shown how to obtain a structural interpretation of @xmath0-values for multiple mutations within a single helix . combined with any scale of helical propensities ,",
    "our model shows how linear fitting of experimental data leads to two structural quantities : the extent of helix formation in the transition state , and the extent to which the helix interactions with neighboring tertiary structure are formed in the transition state .",
    "the method gives a simple physical interpretation of nonclassical @xmath0-values  nonclassical values arise if a mutation stabilizes a helix while destabilizing its interactions with neighboring parts of the protein , or vice versa .",
    "the model also explains how two different mutations at the same site can have different effects on the kinetics  this difference is traced back to different effects of the mutations on the intrinsic helix stability versus tertiary stability .",
    "hence , this model appears to give simple physically consistent structural explanations for experimentally measured @xmath0-values .",

    "<S> @xmath0-values are experimental measures of the effects of mutations on the folding kinetics of a protein . </S>",
    "<S> a central question is which structural information @xmath0-values contain about the transition state of folding . </S>",
    "<S> traditionally , a @xmath0-value is interpreted as the ` nativeness ' of a mutated residue in the transition state . however , this interpretation is often problematic because it assumes a linear relation between the nativeness of the residue and its free - energy contribution . </S>",
    "<S> we present here a better structural interpretation of @xmath0-values for mutations within a given helix . our interpretation is based on a simple physical model that distinguishes between secondary and tertiary free - energy contributions of helical residues . from a linear fit of our model to the experimental data , </S>",
    "<S> we obtain two structural parameters : the extent of helix formation in the transition state , and the nativeness of tertiary interactions in the transition state . </S>",
    "<S> we apply our model to all proteins with well - characterized helices for which more than 10 @xmath0-values are available : protein a , ci2 , and protein l. the model captures nonclassical @xmath0-values @xmath1 or @xmath2 in these helices , and explains how different mutations at a given site can lead to different @xmath0-values . </S>"
