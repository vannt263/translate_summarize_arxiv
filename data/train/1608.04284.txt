    "the purpose of this article is to review progress over the past few years on the thermal behaviour of hadronic and qcd matter obtained within the framework of qcd sum rules ( qcdsr ) @xcite-@xcite extended to finite temperature , @xmath6 .",
    "these thermal qcdsr were first proposed long ago by bochkarev and shaposnikov @xcite , leading to countless applications , with the most recent ones being reviewed here .",
    "the first step in the thermal qcdsr approach is to identify the relevant quantities to provide information on the basic phase transitions ( or crossover ) , i.e. quark - gluon de - confinement and chiral - symmetry restoration .",
    "this is done below , to be followed in section 2 by a brief description of the qcd sum rule method at @xmath7 , which relates qcd to hadronic physics by invoking cauchy s theorem in the complex square - energy plane .",
    "next , in section 3 the extension to finite @xmath8 will be outlined in the light - quark axial - vector channel , leading to an intimate relation between de - confinement and chiral - symmetry restoration . in section 4 the thermal light - quark vector channel",
    "is described , with an application to the di - muon production rate in heavy - ion collisions at high energies , which can be predicted in the @xmath9-meson region in excellent agreement with data .",
    "section 5 is devoted to the thermal behaviour of the weinberg sum rules , and the issue of chiral - mixing . in section 6",
    "very recent results on the thermal behaviour of the up- down - quark mass will be shown .",
    "section 7 is devoted to the thermal behaviour of heavy - quark systems , i.e. charmonium and bottonium states , which led to the prediction of their survival at and above the critical temperature for de - confinement , confirmed by lattice qcd ( lqcd ) results . in section 8",
    "we review an extension of the thermal qcdsr method to finite baryon chemical potential .",
    "finally , section 9 provides a short summary of this review .",
    "+ figure 1 illustrates a typical hadronic spectral function , @xmath10 , in terms of the square energy , @xmath11 , in the time - like region , @xmath12 , at @xmath7 ( curve ( a ) ) .",
    "first , there could be a delta - function corresponding to a stable particle present as a pole ( zero - width state ) in the spectral function .",
    "this could be e.g. the pion pole entering the axial - vector or the pseudo - scalar correlator , with the spectral function    @xmath13    where @xmath14 is the pion ( weak - interaction ) decay constant , defined as @xmath15 , and @xmath16 its mass .",
    "this is followed by resonances of widths increasing in size with increasing @xmath17 , and corresponding to poles in the second riemann sheet in the complex @xmath17-plane .",
    "for instance , for narrow resonances the breit - wigner parametrization is normally adequate    @xmath18    where @xmath19 is the coupling of the resonance to the current entering a correlation function , @xmath20 its mass , and @xmath21 its ( hadronic ) width . at high enough squared energy , @xmath22 ,",
    "the spectral function becomes smooth , and should be well approximated by perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) . in the sequel , this parameter will be indistinctly referred to as the perturbative qcd threshold , the continuum threshold , or the deconfinement parameter . at finite @xmath8",
    "this spectrum gets distorted .",
    "the pole in the real axis moves down into the second riemann sheet , thus generating a finite width .",
    "the widths of the rest of the resonances increase with increasing @xmath8 , and some states begin to disappear from the spectrum , as first proposed in @xcite .",
    "eventually , close to , or at the critical temperature for de - confinement , @xmath23 , there will be no trace of the resonances , as their widths would be very large , and their couplings to hadronic currents would approach zero . at the same time , @xmath24 would approach the origin . thus @xmath24 becomes a phenomenological order parameter for quark - de - confinement , as first proposed by bochkarev and shaposnikov @xcite .",
    "this order parameter , associated with qcd de - confinement , is entirely phenomenological and quite different from the polyakov - loop used by lqcd .",
    "nevertheless , and quite importantly , qualitative and quantitative conclusions regarding this phase transition ( or crossover ) , and the behaviour of qcd and hadronic parameters as @xmath25 obtained from qcdsr and lqcd should agree .",
    "it is reassuring that this turns out to be the case , as will be reviewed here .",
    "in this scenario , whatever happens to the mass is totally irrelevant ; it could either increase or decrease with temperature , providing no information about de - confinement .",
    "the crucial parameters are the width and the coupling , but not the mass .",
    "in fact , if a particle mass would approach the origin , or even vanish with increasing temperature , this in itself is not sufficient to signal de - confinement , as a massless particle with a finite coupling and width would still contribute to the spectrum .",
    "what is required is that the widths diverge , and the couplings vanish . in all applications of qcd sum rules at finite @xmath8 ,",
    "the hadron masses in some channels decrease , and in other cases they increase slightly with increasing @xmath8 . at the same time , for all light , and heavy - light quark bound states the widths are found to diverge and the couplings to vanish close to or at @xmath26 , thus signalling de - confinement .",
    "however , in the case of charmonium and bottonium hadronic states , after an initial surge , the widths decrease considerably with increasing temperature , while the couplings are initially independent of @xmath8 , and eventually grow sharply close to @xmath26 .",
    "this survival of charmonium states was first predicted from thermal qcd sum rules @xcite-@xcite , and later extended to bottonium @xcite , in qualitative agreement with lqcd @xcite .",
    "+ in addition to @xmath24 , there is another important thermal qcd quantity , the quark condensate , this time a fundamental order parameter of chiral - symmetry restoration .",
    "it is well known that qcd in the light - quark sector possesses a chiral @xmath27 symmetry in the limit of zero - mass up- and down - quarks .",
    "this chiral - symmetry is realized in the nambu - goldstone fashion , as opposed to the wigner - weyl realization @xcite . in other words ,",
    "chiral - symmetry is a dynamical , as opposed to a classification symmetry .",
    "hence , the pion mass squared vanishes as the quark mass    @xmath28    and the pion decay constant squared vanishes as the quark - condensate    @xmath29    where b is a constant . while from eq.([mpi2 ] ) @xmath30 can vanish as the quark mass at @xmath7 , the vanishing of @xmath31 can only take place at finite temperature , as @xmath32 at @xmath33 , the critical temperature for _ chiral - symmetry restoration_. the correct meaning of _ chiral - symmetry restoration _ is a phase transition from a nambu - goldstone realization of chiral @xmath27 to a wigner - weyl realization of the symmetry .",
    "in other words , there is a clear distinction between a symmetry of the lagrangian and a symmetry of the vacuum @xcite .",
    "+ in summary , at finite temperature the hadronic parameters to provide relevant information on de - confinement are the hadron width and its coupling to the corresponding interpolating current . on the qcd side we have ( a ) the chiral condensate , @xmath34 , providing information on chiral - symmetry restoration , and ( b ) the onset of pqcd as determined by the squared energy , @xmath24 , providing information on quark - de - confinement .",
    "the next step is to relate these two sectors .",
    "this is currently done by considering the complex squared energy plane and invoking cauchy s theorem , as described first at @xmath7 in section ii , and at finite @xmath8 in section iii .",
    "however , to keep a historical perspective , a summary of the original approach @xcite , not entirely based on cauchy s theorem , will be provided first .",
    "the primary object in the qcd sum rule approach is the current - current correlation function    @xmath35    where @xmath36 is a local current built either from the qcd quark / gluon fields , or from hadronic fields . in the case of qcd , and invoking the operator product expansion ( ope ) of current correlators at short distances beyond perturbation theory @xcite-@xcite , one of the two pillars of the qcd sum rule method , one has    @xmath37    where @xmath38 , @xmath39 is a renormalization scale , the wilson coefficients @xmath40 depend on the lorentz indexes and quantum numbers of the currents , and on the local gauge invariant operators @xmath41 built from the quark and gluon fields in the qcd lagrangian .",
    "these operators are ordered by increasing dimensionality and the wilson coefficients are calculable in pqcd .",
    "the unit operator above has dimension @xmath42 and @xmath43 stands for the purely perturbative contribution . at @xmath7 the dimension @xmath44 term in the ope",
    "can not be constructed from gauge invariant operators built from the quark and gluon fields of qcd ( apart from negligible light - quark mass corrections ) .",
    "in addition , there is no evidence from such a term from analyses using experimental data @xcite , so that the ope starts at dimension @xmath45 .",
    "the contributions at this dimension arise from the vacuum expectation values of the gluon field squared ( gluon condensate ) , and of the quark - anti quark fields ( the quark condensate ) times the quark mass .",
    "for instance , let us consider the conserved vector current correlator    @xmath46    where @xmath47 $ ] is the ( electric charge neutral ) conserved vector current in the chiral limit ( @xmath48 ) , and @xmath49 is the four - momentum carried by the current .",
    "the function @xmath50 in pqcd is normalized as    @xmath51 \\ , , \\label{pi}\\ ] ]    and the leading non - perturbative term of dimension @xmath52 is given by    @xmath53    a renormalization group invariant quantity , with @xmath54 the qcd current quark masses in the @xmath55 regularization scheme , and @xmath56 .",
    "the scale dependence of the quark condensate cancels with the corresponding dependence of the quark masses . in general",
    ", the numerical values of the vacuum condensates can not be determined analytically from first principles , as this would be tantamount to solving qcd exactly .",
    "they can be estimated from qcdsr and some experimental data , to be discussed next , or computed numerically in lqcd .",
    "an important exception is the quark condensate term above , whose value follows from the gell - mann - oakes - renner relation in chiral @xmath27 symmetry @xcite",
    "@xmath57    where @xmath58 is the pion decay constant @xcite . corrections to this relation , essentially hadronic , are small and at the level of a few percent @xcite .",
    "+ turning to the hadronic representation of the current correlation function @xmath50 in the time - like region , @xmath59 , in eq .",
    ", at leading order it is given by the rho - meson resonance . to a good approximation",
    "this is well described by a breit - wigner form    @xmath60    where @xmath61 is the coupling of the @xmath9-meson to the vector current , i.e. the leptonic decay constant @xcite , and @xmath62 and @xmath63 are the mass and width of the @xmath9-meson , respectively .",
    "this parametrization has been normalized such that the area under it equals the area under a zero width expression , i.e.    @xmath64    the next step is to find a way to relate the qcd representation of @xmath65 to its hadronic counterpart .",
    "historically , at @xmath7 , one of the first attempts was made in @xcite using as a first step a dispersion relation ( hilbert transform ) , which follows from cauchy s theorem in the complex squared energy @xmath17-plane    @xmath66    where @xmath67 equals the number of derivatives required for the integral to converge asymptotically , @xmath68 is a free parameter , and @xmath69 . as it stands , the dispersion relation , eq.([hilbert ] ) , is a tautology . in the early days of high energy physics",
    "the optical theorem was invoked in order to relate the spectral function , @xmath70 , to a total hadronic cross section , together with some assumptions about its asymptotic behaviour , and thus relate the integral to the real part of the correlator , or its derivatives .",
    "the latter could , in turn , be related to e.g. scattering lengths .",
    "the procedure proposed in @xcite was to parametrize the hadronic spectral function as    @xmath71    where the ground state pole",
    "( if present ) is followed by the resonances which merge smoothly into the hadronic continuum above some threshold @xmath72 .",
    "this continuum is expected to be well represented by pqcd if @xmath72 is large enough .",
    "subsequently , the left hand side of this dispersion relation is written in terms of the qcd ope , eq.([ope ] ) .",
    "the result is a sum rule relating hadronic to qcd information .",
    "subsequently , in @xcite a specific asymptotic limiting process in the parameters @xmath67 and @xmath73 was performed , i.e. @xmath74 and @xmath75 , with @xmath76 fixed , leading to laplace transform qcd sum rules , expected to be more useful than the original hilbert moments ,    @xmath77\\equiv\\lim_{\\stackrel{q^2,n \\rightarrow \\infty}{q^2/n\\equiv m^2 } } \\frac{(-)^n}{(n-1 ) ! }",

    "this equation is still a tautology . in order to turn it into something with useful content one still needs to invoke eq.([hadspec ] ) . in applications of these sum rules",
    "@xcite @xmath79 was computed in qcd by applying the laplace operator @xmath80 to the ope expression of @xmath81 , eq.([ope ] ) , and the spectral function on the right hand side was parametrized as in eq.([hadspec ] ) .",
    "the function @xmath79 in pqcd involves the transcendental function @xmath82 @xcite , as first discussed in @xcite .",
    "this feature , largely ignored for a long time , has no consequences in pqcd at the two - loop level .",
    "however , at higher orders , ignoring this relation leads to wrong results .",
    "it was only after the mid 1990 s that this situation was acknowledged and higher order radiative corrections in laplace transform qcdsr were properly evaluated .",
    "+ this novel method had an enormous impact , as witnessed by the several thousand publications to date on analytic solutions to qcd in the non - perturbative domain @xcite . however , in the past decade , and as the subject moved towards high precision determinations to compete with lqcd , these particular sum rules have fallen out of favour for a variety of reasons as detailed next .",
    "last , but not least , laplace transform qcdsr are ill - suited to deal with finite temperature , as explained below .    the first thing to notice in eq.([laplace ] ) is the introduction of an ad - hoc new parameter , @xmath78 , the laplace variable , which determines the squared energy regions where the exponential kernel would have a minor / major impact .",
    "it had been regularly advertised in the literature that a judicious choice of @xmath78 would lead to an exponential suppression of the often experimentally unknown resonance region beyond the ground state , as well as to a factorial suppression of higher order condensates in the ope .",
    "in practice , though , this was hardly factually achieved , thus not supporting expectations . indeed ,",
    "since the parameter @xmath78 has no physical significance , other than being a mathematical artefact , results from these qcdsr would have to be independent of @xmath78 in a hopefully broad region . in applications ,",
    "this so called stability window is often unacceptably narrow , and the expected exponential suppression of the unknown resonance region does not materialize .",
    "furthermore , the factorial suppression of higher order condensates only starts at dimension @xmath83 with a mild suppression by a factor @xmath84 .",
    "but beyond @xmath83 little , if anything , is numerically known about the vacuum condensates to profit from this feature .",
    "another serious shortcoming of these qcdsr is that the role of the threshold for pqcd in the complex @xmath17-plane , @xmath72 , i.e. the radius of the circular contour in fig .",
    "2 , is exponentially suppressed .",
    "this is rather unfortunate , as @xmath72 is a parameter which , unlike @xmath78 , has a clear physical interpretation , and which can be easily determined from data in some instances , e.g. @xmath85 annihilation into hadrons , @xmath86-lepton hadronic decays , etc .. when dealing with qcdsr at finite temperature , this exponential suppression of @xmath72 is utterly unacceptable , as @xmath24 is * _ the _ * phenomenological order parameter of de - confinement!. a more detailed critical discussion of laplace transform qcdsr may be found in @xcite . + a different attempt at relating qcd to hadronic physics was made by shankar @xcite by considering the complex squared - energy s - plane shown in fig.2 .",
    "the next step is the observation that there are no singularities in this plane , except for those on the positive real axis , which introduce a discontinuity across this axis .",
    "they arise from the hadronic poles and/or resonances present in any given correlation function .",
    "hence , from cauchy s theorem in this plane ( quark - hadron duality ) one obtains    @xmath87    which becomes finite energy sum rules ( fesr )    @xmath88    where an analytic function @xmath89 has been inserted , without changing the result , and the radius of the circle @xmath90 is understood to be large enough for qcd to be valid there .",
    "the function @xmath89 need not be an analytic function , in which case the contour integral instead of vanishing would be proportional to the residue(s ) of the integrand at the pole(s ) . in some cases ,",
    "this is deliberately considered , especially if the residue of the singularity is known independently , or conversely , if the purpose is to determine this residue .",
    "the function @xmath89 above is introduced in order to e.g. generate a set of fesr projecting each and every vacuum condensate of different dimensionality in the ope , eq . .",
    "for instance , choosing @xmath91 , with @xmath92 , leads to the fesr    @xmath93 \\;\\ ; ( n=1,2,\\cdots ) \\;,\\label{fesr2}\\ ] ]    where the leading order vacuum condensates in the chiral limit ( @xmath94 ) are the dimension @xmath45 condensate , eq . , and the dimension @xmath95 four - quark condensate    @xmath96 \\ , , \\label{c6}\\ ] ]    where @xmath97 are the su(3 ) gell - mann matrices .",
    "a word of caution , first brought up in @xcite , is important at this point , having to do with the validity of qcd on the circle of radius @xmath98 in fig.2 .",
    "depending on the value of this radius , qcd may not be valid on the positive real axis , a circumstance called quark - hadron duality violation ( dv ) .",
    "this is currently a contentious issue , which however has no real impact on finite temperature qcd sum rules , to wit . at @xmath7 one way to deal with potential dv",
    "is to introduce in the fesr , eq.([fesr ] ) , weight functions @xmath89 which vanish on the positive real axis ( pinched kernels ) @xcite , @xcite , or alternatively , design specific models of duality violations @xcite .",
    "the size of this effect is relatively small , becoming important only at higher orders ( four- to five - loop order ) in pqcd .",
    "thermal qcd sum rules are currently studied only at leading one - loop order in pqcd , so that dv can be safely ignored .",
    "in addition , results at finite @xmath8 are traditionally normalized to their @xmath7 values , so that only ratios are actually relevant .    in order to verify that the fesr , eq . , give the right order of magnitude results , one can choose e.g. the vector channel , use the zero - width approximation for the hadronic spectral function , ignore radiative corrections , and consider the @xmath99 fesr to determine @xmath72 .",
    "the result is @xmath100 , or @xmath101 , which lies above the @xmath9-meson , and slightly below its very broad first radial excitation , @xmath102 .",
    "an accurate determination using the breit - wigner expression , eq .",
    ", together with radiative corrections up to five - loop order in qcd , gives instead @xmath103 , or @xmath104 , a very reassuring result . among recent key applications of these qcd fesr",
    "are high precision determinations of the light- and heavy - quark masses @xcite,@xcite , now competing in accuracy with lqcd results , and the hadronic contribution to the muon magnetic anomaly @xmath105 @xcite .",
    "+ turning to the case of heavy quarks , instead of fesr it is more convenient to use hilbert moment sum rules @xcite , as described next .",
    "the starting point is the standard dispersion relation , or hilbert transform , which follows from cauchy s theorem in the complex @xmath17-plane , eq.([hilbert ] ) . in order to obtain practical information one invokes cauchy s theorem in the complex @xmath17-plane ( quark - hadron duality ) , so that the hilbert moments , eq.([hilbert ] ) become effectively fesr    @xmath106    where    @xmath107",
    "@xmath108    the non - perturbative moments above , @xmath109 , involve the vacuum condensates in the ope , eq.([ope ] ) .",
    "one important difference is that there is no quark condensate , as there is no underlying chiral - symmetry for heavy quarks .",
    "the would - be quark condensate @xmath110 reduces to the gluon condensate , e.g. at leading order in the heavy - quark mass , @xmath111 one has    @xmath112    where @xmath111 is the heavy - quark mass ( charm , bottom ) . writing several fesr one obtains e.g. information on heavy - quark hadron masses , couplings and hadronic widths . alternatively , using some known hadronic information one can find the values of qcd parameters , such as e.g. heavy - quark masses @xcite,@xcite , and the gluon condensate @xcite . for a review see e.g. @xcite .",
    "their extension to finite temperature will be discussed in section 7 .",
    "+ the techniques required to obtain the qcd expressions of current correlators , both perturbative as well as non - perturbative ( vacuum condensates ) at @xmath7 are well described in detail in @xcite .",
    "the first thermal qcdsr analysis was performed by bochkarev and shaposnikov in 1986 @xcite , using mostly the light - quark vector current correlator ( @xmath9- and @xmath113-meson channels ) at finite temperature , in the framework of laplace - transform qcd sum rules .",
    "additional field - theory support for such an extension was given later in @xcite , in response to baseless criticisms of the method at the time .",
    "laplace transform qcdsr were in fashion in those days @xcite , but their extension to finite @xmath8 turned out to be a major breakthrough , opening up a new area of research ( for early work see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the key results of this pioneer paper @xcite were the temperature dependence of the masses of the @xmath9 and the @xmath113 vector mesons , as well as the threshold for pqcd , @xmath24 .",
    "with hindsight , instead of the vector mesons masses , the @xmath8-dependence of the vector mesons couplings to the vector current would have been better quantities to determine .",
    "however , at the time there were some proposals to consider the hadron masses as relevant thermal parameters .",
    "we have known for a long time now , that this was an ill - conceived idea .",
    "in fact , the @xmath8-dependence of hadron masses is irrelevant for the description of the behaviour of qcd and hadronic matter , and the approach to de - confinement and chiral - symmetry restoration .",
    "this was discussed briefly already in section 1 , and in more detail below . returning to @xcite",
    ", their results for the @xmath8-dependence of @xmath24 , i.e. the de - confinement phenomenological order parameter , clearly showed a sharp decrease with increasing @xmath8 .",
    "indeed , @xmath24 dropped from @xmath114 , to @xmath115 at @xmath116 .",
    "a similar behaviour was also found in the @xmath113-meson channel .",
    "the masses in both cases had decreased only by some @xmath117 . +        .",
    "[ fig : figure3 ]    the first improvement of this approach was proposed in @xcite , where qcd - fesr , instead of laplace transform qcdsr , were used for the first time .",

    "[ fig : figure4 ]    notice the difference in a factor - two with the normalization in eq.([pi ] ) .",
    "this is due to the currents in eq.([aacorrelator ] ) being electrically charged , and those in eq.([vvcorrelator ] ) being electrically neutral ( thus involving an overall factor @xmath123 , as stated after eq.([vvcorrelator ] ) ) the reason for this choice of correlation function was that since the axial - vector correlator involves the pion decay constant , @xmath31 on the hadronic sector , the thermal fesr would provide a relation between @xmath124 and @xmath24 . since the former is related to the quark condensate @xmath125 , eq.([fpi2 ] )",
    ", one would then obtain a relation between chiral - symmetry restoration and de - confinement , the latter being encapsulated in @xmath24 .",
    "we will first assume pion - saturation of the hadronic spectral function , in order to follow closely @xcite .",

    "starting at @xmath7 , the pion - pole contribution to the hadronic spectral function in the fesr , eq.([fesr2 ] ) , is given by    @xmath126    where @xmath127 above was approximated in the chiral limit . with @xmath128 ( see eq.([ope ] ) ) , the first fesr , eq.([fesr2 ] ) for @xmath99 simply reads    @xmath129        .",

    "+ the next step in @xcite was to use the dolan - jackiw @xcite thermal quark propagators , equivalent to the matsubara formalism at the one - loop level , to find the qcd and hadronic spectral functions .",
    "for instance , at the qcd one - loop level the thermal quark propagator becomes    @xmath132    and an equivalent expression for bosons , except for a positive relative sign between the two terms above , and the obvious replacement of the fermi by the bose thermal factor .",
    "an advantage of this expression is that it allows for a straightforward calculation of the imaginary part of current correlators , which is the function entering qcdsr .",
    "it turns out that there are two distinct thermal contributions , as first pointed out in @xcite .",
    "one in the time - like region @xmath133 , called the annihilation term , and another in the space - like region @xmath134 , referred to as the scattering term . here , @xmath135 , where @xmath136 is the energy , and @xmath137 the three - momentum with respect to the thermal bath .",
    "the scattering term can be visualized as due to the scattering of quarks and hadrons , entering spectral functions , with quarks and hadrons in the hot thermal bath . in the complex energy @xmath136-plane ,",
    "the correlation functions have cuts in both the positive as well as the negative real axes , folding into one single cut along the positive real axis in the complex @xmath138 plane .",

    "this choice allows for a smooth extension of the qcdsr method to finite @xmath8 .",
    "the only thermal restriction has to do with the support of the integrals entering the sum rules . in most cases",
    "this extends up to the critical temperature , an exception being charmonium which goes even further .",
    "field theory arguments fully supporting this approach were given in @xcite .",
    "+ another key element in this programme is the identification of the relevant qcd and hadronic parameters characterizing the transition to deconfinement and chiral - symmetry restoration .",
    "while the latter is universally understood to be the thermal quark condensate , an order parameter , in the case of deconfinement the parameter is purely phenomenological .",
    "it also differs from that used by lqcd , i.e. the so - called polyakov loop .",
    "thermal qcd sum rules invoke , instead , the onset of perturbative qcd in the square - energy , @xmath17-plane , so called @xmath24 , as first proposed in @xcite .",
    "this choice is validated _ a posteriori _ by all applications in the light - quark and the heavy - light quark sector , resulting in an @xmath24 decreasing monotonically with increasing temperature , and eventually vanishing at a critical temperature @xmath33 . an important exception to",
    "this behaviour is the heavy - heavy quark system , i.e. charmonium ( vector , scalar , and pseudoscalar channels ) @xcite-@xcite , and bottonium @xcite ( vector and pseudoscalar ) , for which @xmath24 remains well above zero at or beyond @xmath26 . on the hadronic sector ,",
    "the relevant parameters are the current - hadron coupling , and the hadronic width , both of which underpin the conclusions derived from the behaviour of @xmath24 , to wit . for light and heavy - light quark systems the current - hadron coupling decreases , and the hadronic width increases monotonically with increasing @xmath8 , thus signalling deconfinement . instead , for the heavy - heavy quark systems , the coupling actually increases , and the width while initially growing , it reverses behaviour decreasing close to @xmath26 , indicating the survival of these hadrons at and above @xmath26 .",
    "this prediction was later confirmed for bottonium by lqcd @xcite .",
    "+ another fundamental issue , to which this method contributed , was the relation between the two phase transitions , i.e. deconfinement and chiral - symmetry restoration . after preliminary indications of the approximate equality of both critical temperatures @xcite , a later analysis @xcite supported this conclusion .",
    "recently , a more refined updated analysis @xcite fully confirmed earlier results .",
    "+ the extension of the well known weinberg sum rules @xcite to finite @xmath8 , without prejudice on some pre - existing chiral mixing scenario @xcite , clearly show their full saturation , except very close to @xmath26 , albeit returning to full saturation at @xmath33 .",
    "these deviations are caused by the thermal space - like cut in the energy plane , arising at leading order in the vector channel , but loop suppressed in the axial - vector case .",
    "this asymmetric contribution , growing with the square of the temperature , vanishes at @xmath33 .",
    "hence , this feature has no relation whatsoever with a potential chiral mixing scenario .",
    "in fact , an inspection of the thermal behaviour of the hadronic parameters in the vector and the axial - vector channel fully disprove this idea .",
    "these spectral functions remain quite distinct at all temperatures , except at @xmath33 where they vanish for obvious reasons . in any case , and as shown in section 5 , as well as in @xcite , in a hadronic thermal bath there is a chiral asymmetry due to isospin and g - parity preventing any mixing .",
    "+ on a separate issue , thermal qcd sum rules allow to determine the behaviour of the light quark masses , @xmath327 together with the pion decay constant , @xmath124 @xcite .",
    "the two sum rules for the light - quark pseudoscalar axial - vector current divergence require as input the @xmath8-dependence of the pion mass @xcite , and the quark condensate @xcite .",
    "the result for @xmath124 is fully consistent with chiral - symmetry , in that it follows the behaviour of @xmath328 , independently of @xmath254 ( see eqs .",
    "( [ mpi2 ] ) , ( [ fpi2 ] ) ) .",
    "it is also consistent with the expectation that close to @xmath26 the quark mass should increase , becoming the constituent mass at deconfinement .",
    "finally , qcdsr have been extended to finite @xmath8 together with finite baryon chemical potential , @xmath294 , @xcite .",
    "this has allowed to obtain the phase diagram ( @xmath329 ) .",
    "it should be possible , in future , to extend the explored range of @xmath294 , as well as study other applications at finite @xmath8 and @xmath294 .",
    "+ a topic not discussed here is that of non - diagonal ( lorentz non - invariant ) condensates . clearly , the existence of a medium , i.e. the thermal bath , breaks trivially lorentz invariance .",
    "however , after choosing a reference system ar rest with respect to the medium , one can ignore this issue and continue to use a covariant formulation .",
    "nevertheless , there might exist new terms in the ope , absent at @xmath7 . in the case of non - gluonic operators",
    "it has been shown that they are highly suppressed @xcite , @xcite so that they can be ignored .",
    "a gluonic twist - two term in the ope was considered in @xcite , and computed on the lattice in @xcite . once again , the contribution of such a term is negligible in comparison with all regular ( diagonal ) terms as shown in @xcite .",
    "+ in closing we wish to briefly mention a few applications of thermal qcdsr which were nor covered here .",
    "an independent validation of this method was obtained by determining the thermal behaviour of certain three - point functions ( form factors ) , and in particular their associated root - mean - squared ( rms ) radii . in the case of the electromagnetic form factor of the pion , @xmath330 , it was found in @xcite that it decreases with increasing @xmath8 , almost independently of @xmath73 .",
    "the pion radius , @xmath331 , increases with temperature , doubling at @xmath332 , and diverging at @xmath223 , thus signalling deconfinement . on a separate issue , the axial - vector coupling of the nucleon",
    ", @xmath333 was found to be essentially constant in most of the temperature range , except very close to @xmath26 , where it starts to grow @xcite .",
    "the associated rms , @xmath334 was also found to be largely constant , but diverging close to @xmath26 , consistent with deconfinement .",
    "this information was used to determine the thermal behaviour of the @xmath27 goldberger - treiman relation ( gtr ) , and its deviation , @xmath335 defined in @xcite as    @xmath336    which is different from the standard definition @xmath337 .",
    "given that the nucleon mass is basically independent of @xmath8 , except very close to @xmath26 @xcite-@xcite , and similarly for @xmath333 , the deviation @xmath338 decreases with increasing @xmath8 and the gtr ceases to be valid .",
    "+ another thermal three - point function analysis dealt with the coupling @xmath339 , the associated rms radius , and the issue of the vector meson dominance ( vmd ) at finite temperature @xcite , @xcite .",
    "results from @xcite indicated the approximate validity of an extension of vmd where the strong coupling @xmath339 becomes a function of the momentum transfer .",
    "this extended coupling decreases with increasing temperature , vanishing just before @xmath340 , and the associated rms radius diverges close to the critical temperature , thus siganlling deconfinement .",
    "+ finally , the adler - bell - jackiw axial anomaly @xcite at finite @xmath8 was studied at low temperatures in @xcite , and in the whole @xmath8 range in @xcite .",
    "results from @xcite showed that the amplitude of @xmath341 decreased with increasing t. the same behaviour was found in @xcite , leading to the vanishing of that amplitude , provided vmd remains valid .",
