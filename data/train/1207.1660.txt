    "the creation of directional states of molecules represents an important tool to control and tailor the rotational degree of freedom .",
    "when a molecule is oriented the molecular fixed axes are confined along laboratory fixed axes and its dipole moment is pointing in a particular direction . experimentally , the availability of oriented molecules provides a wealth of interesting applications in a variety of molecular sciences , such as in chemical reaction dynamics  @xcite , photoelectron angular distributions  @xcite , or high - order harmonic generation  @xcite .    due to this broad interest",
    ", special efforts have been undertaken to create samples of oriented molecules and techniques based in the application of inhomogeneous  @xcite , and homogeneous  @xcite electric fields as well as homogeneous magnetic fields  @xcite have been used .",
    "a major breakthrough came with the proposal by friedrich and herschbach  @xcite of enhancing the orientation of polar molecules by exposing them to combined weak electrostatic and strong non - resonant radiative fields .",
    "this theoretical prediction was done within an adiabatic picture assuming that the switching on time of the laser pulse is larger than the molecular rotational period . for linear molecules ,",
    "a linearly polarized laser field produces a double - well potential along the polarization direction . in the pendular limit , this double - well potential contains nearly degenerate pairs of states with opposite parity forming tunneling doublets . if the molecules possess a permanent electric dipole moment , a strong pseudo - first - order stark effect is induced by coupling the tunneling doublets with an additional electrostatic field . due to this coupling , the two levels in a pendular doublet are efficiently oriented but with their effective electric dipole moments pointing in opposite directions .",
    "as a consequence of this oriented and antioriented states pairing , the orientation is small in a molecular ensemble with the population thermally distributed .",
    "therefore , the first experimental measures of the orientation of a molecular beam were indeed reduced to small values  @xcite .",
    "a significant improvement was gained by using a quantum - state selected molecular beam , which allowed the creation of unprecedented degree of orientation for complex asymmetric tops  @xcite .",
    "a first theoretical study of the mixed - field orientation experiment of asymmetric top molecules , pointed out that a fully adiabatic description of the process does not reproduce the experimental observations  @xcite .",
    "recently , we have experimentally and theoretically investigated the mixed - field orientation of the carbonyl sulfide molecule  @xcite .",
    "our analysis has proven that a time - dependent description of the mixed - field orientation process is required to explain the experimental results .",
    "we have shown how the non - adiabatic coupling of the levels forming the quasi - degenerate doublets as the laser intensity is increased , gives rise to the reduction of the orientation and , therefore , to the disagreement with the predictions of the adiabatic theory  @xcite .",
    "herein , we provide a detailed theoretical analysis on the dynamics of a linear molecule exposed to an electrostatic field combined with a non - resonant laser pulse . in the framework of the rigid rotor approximation ,",
    "we solve the time - dependent schrdinger equation using experimental field configurations , i.e. , a gaussian laser pulse and a weak electrostatic field that is turned on at constant speed .",
    "as prototype example , we consider the carbonyl sulfide molecule ( ocs ) . for several rotational states ,",
    "we investigate the mixed - field orientation dynamics under different field - configurations by varying either the laser peak intensity , the duration of the gaussian pulse , the dc field strength or the angle between both fields .",
    "hence , we demonstrate that for some field configurations , the field - dressed dynamics is non - adiabatic and provide a detailed account of the sources of non - adiabaticity and the field regimes at which they appear . for parallel fields ,",
    "the dynamics is characterized by the population transfer between adiabatic states when the pendular doublets are formed .",
    "whereas for non - parallel fields , we encounter additional non - adiabatic effects when the states from the same @xmath0-manifold , having now the same symmetry , are driven apart as the laser intensity is increased on the weak field regime . for different field configurations , we identify and discuss the experimental conditions needed to achieve an adiabatic molecular dynamics .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in we describe the hamiltonian of the system and its symmetries for various field configurations .",
    "the results for the energy , alignment and orientation predicted by the adiabatic theory are analyzed in . in , we focus on the molecular dynamics when the fields are parallel .",
    "in particular , we explore how the time - dependent orientation varies as the field parameters are modified , and indicate the experimental conditions under which an adiabatic orientation would be achieved .",
    "a similar study is performed for tilted fields in , where we show that the conditions for an adiabatic mixed - field orientation are more difficult to fulfill . in , we assume that once the pulse is turned on its peak intensity is kept constant , and investigate the dynamics in this regime . in , first the laser pulse",
    "is switched on and then an electric field is applied . in this field configuration",
    ", we analyze the orientation of the ground state and provide the field parameters for an adiabatic orientation .",
    "the conclusions are given in .",
    "we consider a polar linear molecule exposed to an homogeneous static electric field and a non - resonant linearly polarized laser pulse .",
    "the field configuration is illustrated in : the polarization of the laser field lies along the @xmath1-axis of the laboratory fixed frame ( lff ) @xmath2 , and the dc field is contained in the @xmath3-plane forming an angle @xmath4 with the @xmath1-axis .",
    "the @xmath5-axis of the molecule fixed frame @xmath6 is defined by the permanent dipole moment @xmath7 of the molecule .",
    "these two frames are related by the euler angles @xmath8 , cf .",
    "the description of this system is done within the rigid rotor approximation , assuming that the vibrational and electronic dynamics are not affected by the fields .",

    ", we average over the rapid oscillations of the non - resonant field .",
    "this causes the coupling of this field with the permanent dipole moment to vanish  @xcite .",
    "thus , the non - resonant laser field molecule interaction can be written as @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the polarizability anisotropy , @xmath28 is the intensity of the laser , @xmath29 is the speed of light and @xmath30 is the dielectric constant .",

    ", we have not made explicit these dependences , but the field configuration is clearly indicated through the text .    to get a better physical insight on the field - dressed dynamics , the time - dependent results will be compared to those from the adiabatic theory . for this system , we take the adiabatic limit by using a constant electrostatic field @xmath47 and constant laser intensity @xmath48 in the hamiltonian . the time - independent schrdinger equation associated to this hamiltonian is solved by expanding the wave function in a basis that respects the symmetries .",

    "the insets in this panel show how these doublets appear .",
    "the gap in energy in a doublet goes as @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the effective dipole moment of the state @xmath76 in the doublet , which is of opposite sign for @xmath77 . within a doublet ,",

    "the larger is the field - free rotational quantum number of the levels , i.e. , their field - free energy , the stronger is the laser intensity needed to achieve a significant orientation .",
    "indeed , the states in the third and fourth doublets are not aligned for @xmath79 and , therefore , not oriented . once the pendular regime is achieved , the orientation of these states @xmath80 approaches to @xmath81 as @xmath48 is enhanced .",
    "if the laser field is sufficiently strong , this adiabatic orientation is independent of the dc field strength , and of the angle between both fields .",
    "in this section , we investigate the rotational dynamics in a parallel configuration : a dc - field of @xmath82 and a gaussian pulse with fwhm @xmath83  ns and several peak intensities . for the ground state @xmath84 , the expectation value @xmath62 is presented in  ( a ) as a function of @xmath28 up until the peak intensity @xmath36 is reached . for comparison ,",
    "the adiabatic results are also shown .",
    "since the fwhm is 125.31 times larger than the rotational period , one would expect that the rotational dynamics follows the adiabatic limit .",
    "however this is not the case , and there are significant discrepancies between the time - dependent and adiabatic results .",
    "in contrast to what is predicted by the adiabatic theory , the final orientation decreases as the peak intensity of the laser pulse is increased . for @xmath85 , @xmath62",

    "the field configuration is @xmath72 and @xmath41 . ]",
    "a first physical insight into the non - adiabatic dynamics could be gained by analyzing the characteristic times of the molecule .",
    "when the states in a pendular doublet are quasi - degenerated , the energy gap between them , @xmath97 , defines a time scale of this system  @xcite .",
    "note that we have assumed @xmath98 , which holds in the strong laser field regime . for @xmath72 and @xmath41 ,",
    "the energy separation within the first doublet formed by @xmath63 and @xmath64 is @xmath99  @xmath58 giving a time scale of @xmath100  ps , which is larger than the rotational period @xmath101  ps .",
    "thus , only long enough pulses compared to this pendular time would ensure an adiabatic orientation of the molecule .",
    "since the static field strength is so weak , its impact on the rotational dynamics is very small , and before the pulse the levels could be considered as field - free rotor states . as the laser intensity increases",
    ", the states are hybridized by the combined action of the both fields , and the doublets of nearly - degenerate states are formed in the strong laser field regime , as it is shown in  ( a ) .",
    "when the energy splitting of this pendular doublet approaches the coupling of the two sublevels due to the pseudo - first - order stark interaction , these states can mix because they have the same symmetry for @xmath102 . as a consequence ,",
    "there is a population transfer between the oriented and anti - oriented states , which results in a decrease of the final orientation compared to the adiabatic limit . for this field configuration ,",
    "the dynamics can be analyzed by means of the adiabatic states forming this pendular doublet , because their couplings to states in neighboring doublets is much smaller than the energy difference between them .",
    "note that these adiabatic states are the eigenstates of the hamiltonian at fixed time @xmath46 .    under a time - dependent interaction , i.e. , in our case the interaction with the laser field @xmath103 , the dynamics could be considered as adiabatic if and only if the following condition  @xcite @xmath104{\\left\\langle i \\left|\\cfrac{\\partial h_\\textup{l}(t)}{\\partial t}\\right| j\\right\\rangle}{_{\\textup{p } } } \\right|}{\\left|e_i - e_j\\right|^2}\\ll 1\\ ] ] is fulfilled , with @xmath105 and @xmath106 being the eigenstates of the hamiltonian in the adiabatic limit , and @xmath107 and @xmath108 their energies .",
    "according to this criterion , the probability for mixing , corresponding to a transfer of population from one state of the doublet to the other , is determined by the rate of change of the laser field interaction and the energy separation between the states .",
    "thus , as the laser intensity is increased the population transfer between the two states in a doublet takes place because the criterion is not satisfied . to illustrate this phenomenon",
    ", we show the contribution of the adiabatic ground state @xmath109 to the time - dependent wave function of @xmath84 ,  ( b ) , and the adiabatic parameter @xmath96 when @xmath110 ,  ( c ) . note that @xmath111 . in these four cases ,",
    "the dynamics is initially adiabatic , i.e. , @xmath109 remains equal to @xmath81 and @xmath112 .",
    "as @xmath28 is increased , the energy splitting of the doublet decreases and , moreover , it becomes comparable or even larger than the rate of turning - on the pulse ; thus , @xmath96 is close to @xmath81 , and the population transfer takes place .",
    "this region where @xmath96 is not negligible corresponds to the formation of the quasi - degenerate doublet .",
    "once the doublet is formed , @xmath113 reaches a small value and slowly decreases as @xmath28 is enhanced ; but the two states are oriented in opposite directions and their wave functions do not overlap .",
    "therefore , the coupling due to the alignment laser is much smaller than @xmath114 , @xmath115 and the population transfer does not take place any longer , i.e. , @xmath109 remains constant as @xmath28 is enhanced .",
    "the larger is this population transfer , the smaller is the orientation compared to the adiabatic prediction . since these adiabatic states contributing to the dynamics are quasi - degenerated and have very close values of the alignment and hybridization of the angular motion , the lack of adiabaticity is not reflected on the time evolution of the energy , @xmath73 or @xmath116 .",
    "for this field configuration , the molecular dynamics of excited states present analogous features for @xmath62 , @xmath73 and @xmath116 as those encountered here for the ground state .",
    "the adiabaticity of the field - dressed dynamics is determined by the rate of change of the laser field interaction compared to the largest time scale of the system . in the pendular regime ,",
    "the energy splitting in a doublet goes as @xmath117 ; then , the population transfer decreases if @xmath47 is increased . on the other hand , by increasing the fwhm augments the time scale on which the pendular doublets are formed , and facilitates the adaptation of the molecule to this field .",
    "that is , the mixed - field orientation will be more adiabatic when either longer pulses or stronger static electric fields are used .",
    "let us remark that with the expression _ being the dynamics more adiabatic _ we mean that for a certain state , the weight of its corresponding adiabatic state in the time - dependent wave function is closer to one during the dynamics .      here",
    ", we investigate the orientation at the maximum of the laser pulse , as it is done in most of the experiments @xcite .",
    "the rate of change of the laser field and the adiabatic parameter depend linearly on @xmath36 .",
    "then , for a gaussian pulse with fixed fwhm , the dynamics will be more diabatic if @xmath36 is increased .",

    "this is counterintuitive to what is expected in the adiabatic limit ; namely , a larger orientation when the laser intensity is increased .",
    "the maximum in the orientation is achieved with an alignment pulse that already gives rise to a non - adiabatic dynamics .",
    "however , due to the coupling between the populated adiabatic states in the pendular pair @xmath129 , the orientation is enhanced compared to what happens at the adiabatic limit . by further increasing @xmath36 ,",
    "the population transferred between the two states is enhanced , but now the coupling between them is very small or even zero due to their opposite orientation . as a consequence , the final orientation decreases as @xmath36 is increased . for a certain pendular doublet",
    ", the upper state is antioriented , and @xmath62 shows the opposite behavior as a function of @xmath36 .",
    "regarding the third and fourth doublets , the states are not oriented nor aligned for ac pulses with @xmath130 .",

    "an analogous behavior is obtained for the ground state and @xmath42 . by further increasing the peak intensity , the orientation of the adiabatic states increases , the coupling terms are reduced approaching zero , and these regular oscillations will disappear .    when two pendular doublets participate in the dynamics , this oscillatory behavior becomes irregular , because the frequencies associated with the energy separations within each pendular doublet and between two of them do not form a commensurable set .",

    "in previous sections , the field configuration was based on the mixed - field orientation experiments  @xcite . here",
    ", we investigate the molecular dynamics when the temporal order of the fields is inverted : the gaussian pulse is switched on first , its peak intensity is kept constant , and then the static electric field is turned on . while the laser field is switched on ,",
    "the pendular doublets of quasi - degenerate states with opposite parity are formed .",
    "this process is adiabatic  @xcite , and for a sufficiently large peak intensity , these two levels are strongly aligned but not oriented . by turning on the static field , these states have the same symmetry and they should be oriented due to their interaction with this field . for this field configuration ,",

    ", @xmath62 oscillates as @xmath18 is increased , and its frequency is equal to the energy separation between the adiabatic levels @xmath178 and @xmath176 . a similar behavior is observed for @xmath292  v / scm , but the orientation of the ground state oscillates around a value closer to the adiabatic limit because the process is more adiabatic and @xmath293 for @xmath294 . for @xmath295 and @xmath296",
    "v / scm , the dynamics can be considered as adiabatic , with @xmath109 being larger than @xmath297 . however , for @xmath295 , @xmath62 still oscillates around the adiabatic value .    by increasing the peak intensity of the laser pulse ,",
    "the energy splitting of the levels in a pendular doublet is decreased , but their coupling due to the dc field is not significantly modified .",

    "in this work , we have investigated the mixed - field orientation dynamics of linear molecules .",
    "the richness and variety of the field - dressed rotational dynamics has been illustrated by analyzing in detail the directional properties of several low - lying states .",
    "in particular , we have explored the degree of orientation as the peak intensity and fwhm of the gaussian pulse , the electrostatic field strength and the angle between both fields are varied .    by considering prototypical field configurations used in current mixed - field orientation experiments ,",
    "we have proven that the assumption of a fully adiabatic dynamics is incorrect . for parallel fields ,",
    "a non - adiabatic transfer of population takes place when the quasi - degenerated pendular doublets are formed as the laser intensity is increased . as a consequence ,",
    "the time - dependent results for the degree of orientation are smaller than the predictions of the adiabatic theory .",
    "using current available experimental peak intensities , longer laser pulses or stronger static fields will increase the degree of orientation even for highly excited states . in particular",
    ", we have provided the field parameters under which the mixed - field orientation dynamics will be fully adiabatic .",
    "we have also shown that the field - dressed dynamics is more complicated if both fields are tilted . apart from the non - adiabatic effects when the pendular doublets are formed , at weak laser intensities",
    "there is also population transfer due to the splitting of the states within a @xmath0-manifold having now the same symmetry . for non - parallel fields",
    ", we have shown that the ground state is strongly oriented , whereas excited states might only present a moderate orientation , and , furthermore , some of them could behave as dark states to the mixed - field orientation dynamics .",
    "the requirements for an adiabatic dynamics are now more difficult to satisfy for excited levels than for the ground state .",
    "again , we have indicated the field configuration that will give rise to an adiabatic mixed - field - orientation .",
    "if the peak intensity is kept constant after turning on the pulse , we have shown that the orientation of the states might oscillate with time due to the non - adiabatic dynamics .",
    "finally , we have investigated the molecular dynamics when the temporal order of the fields is inverted .",
    "we have shown that once the ground state is adiabatically aligned , the switching on of the dc field has to be very slow to achieve a significant orientation .",
    "although our study is restricted to the ocs molecule , we stress that the above - observed physical phenomena are expected to occur in many other polar molecules .",
    "indeed , the hamiltonian can be rescaled , and the above results used to describe another polar linear molecule .",
