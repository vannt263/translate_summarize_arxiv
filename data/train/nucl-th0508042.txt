    "numerous experimental as well as theoretical investigations of @xmath2 exclusive reactions , in both light and heavy nuclei , have been performed extensively in the past , with the aim to extract information about the structure of these systems @xcite . in particular",
    "one has tried to access ground state properties of the target nucleus like spectroscopic factors , shell momentum distributions etc .",
    "however , it is well known that such quantities can only be obtained under the hypothesis that the reaction mechanism is dominated by a direct knock  out of the proton and neglecting the interaction in the final state .",
    "such assumptions are usually considered more and more plausible as the momentum transferred by the electron to the system increases and allows to probe `` single nucleon '' physics . in many nuclei the experimental one ",
    "body knock  out spectra indeed show very nicely pronounced peaks , hinting to an independent motion of the nucleons in such systems . in these cases shell momentum distributions and spectroscopic factors have been extracted trying to estimate fsi effects in various ways .",
    "spectroscopic factors which are found smaller than 1 ( and they are often found considerably far from 1 ) are interpreted as due to large `` correlation effects '' induced by the residual interaction in the ground state of the system .",
    "unfortunately up to recently the two fundamental assumptions mentioned above could not be checked , because of the impossibility to solve the man ",
    "body problem in a quantum mechanical consistent way both for ground and continuum states .",
    "the recent progress made in few ",
    "body physics allows us to start investigating these assumptions . for @xmath3 and 3 the calculations are fully under control  @xcite both for ground and continuum states , and",
    "the problem has been investigated .",
    "however , the features of such systems are often considered too different from those of a typical `` many ",
    "body '' nucleus , to be taken as testing grounds for validating assumptions on heavier systems .    in the last decade",
    "it has been demonstrated that the procedure to calculate reactions with the help of integral transforms originally proposed in 1985  @xcite can be successfully applied in order to overcome the longstanding stumbling block which prevented _ ab initio _ calculations of high energy reactions involving four nucleons and more  @xcite .",
    "this has been possible thanks to the integral transform with the lorentz kernel ( we will denote it by lit ) proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite and recently applied also to the two  body break  up of the four  body system in ref .",
    "thus it is possible now to treat the full dynamics of a reaction to continuum in a nucleus whose features ( binding energy and density ) are certainly much closer to those of heavier systems than deuteron and triton or @xmath4he .",
    "it is the purpose of this work to perform a model study of the role of the full treatment of the interaction in the four  body dynamics in the @xmath0he@xmath1h reaction and to discuss the plausibility of the direct knock  out and plane wave assumptions . to this aim",

    "this response is accessible experimentally if one performs a rosenbluth separation in parallel kinematics , and has been measured in a number of experiments  @xcite . though the use of a semirealistic potential does not allow to draw precise conclusions we believe that a comparison with data may be instructive and we will also comment on that .    in sec .",

    "finds that the longitudinal responses at constant @xmath147 values , calculated with and without fsi , cross at an @xmath11 value of approximately @xmath149 .",
    "the fact that the crossing happens just along that ridge is probably due to the different effects of the potential in the initial and in the final state with respect to the free one  body knock  out model , as explained in the following . in the one body",
    "knock  out model the pwia peak energy is @xmath150 . the positive quantity",
    "@xmath151 is the difference between the binding energies of @xmath0he and @xmath4h and can be considered as a `` ground state effect '' of the potential .",
    "one can argue that the additional effect of the potential in the final state would lead to @xmath152 , where @xmath153 represents the mean interaction energy between the proton and the triton in the final state interaction zone ( @xmath153 will be attractive ) .",
    "therefore the pwia and fsi curves should intersect at an energy smaller than @xmath154 . to a good accuracy",
    "this value turns out to be just @xmath149 .",
    "of course such a comparison between inclusive and exclusive results is justified only in case of sufficiently low @xmath145 as it is the case for the kinematics listed in table  [ table1 ] .",
    "similar pwias and fsi effects are also found for kin .",
    "n. 6 and 9 in the two  body break  up results of @xmath4he @xcite .",
    "it is a common belief that the kinematical regions at lower energy and higher momentum transfers are the privileged ones to investigate the ground state short range correlation effects .",
    "our results show that if one relies on approximate approaches to estimate the fsi effects one might underestimate considerably the momentum distributions at high @xmath155 extracted from experiment in those kinematical regions .",
    "as stated above , the aim of the present work is mainly to study relative effects of antisymmetrization and fsi , which are often treated approximately , via a complete solution of the quantum mechanical few - body problem .",

    "[ figure4 ] results for non parallel kinematics are shown as functions of @xmath145 . in the upper panel",

    "<S> it is found that lower missing momenta and higher momentum transfers are preferable to minimize effects beyond the plane wave impulse approximation ( pwia ) . also for non parallel kinematics </S>",
    "<S> the role of antisymmetrization and final state interaction become very important with increasing missing momentum , raising doubts about the possibility of extracting momentum distributions and spectroscopic factors . </S>",
    "<S> the comparison with experimental results in parallel kinematics , where the rosenbluth separation has been possible , is discussed . </S>"
