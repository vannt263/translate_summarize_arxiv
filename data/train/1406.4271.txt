    "they often represent dense structure resulting from sudden changes in wind characteristics .",
    "these circumstellar nebulae are often known from their optical emission lines , but infrared emission from cold and dense medium is becoming more important . in principle ,",
    "emission in different regimes provide us with a more complete view of the progenitor star system and its evolution .",
    "planetary nebulae ( pne ) are the most frequent type of nebula around evolved stars .",
    "the nebula consists of material ejected during the agb phase and ionized by the uv radiation from the newly - formed hot central star @xcite .",
    "more than a thousand pne are currently known in our galaxy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , most of the known ones are high above the galactic plane and the number of pne along the galactic plane is relatively small . with the advent of sensitive h@xmath10  survey of the galactic plane such as iphas @xcite and vphas+ , a large number of pne in the plane is being revealed .",
    "furthermore , the nir line surveys like uwish2 and uwife have the potential to uncover a significant population pne along the galactic plane",
    ". these surveys will help us to constrain their space density and any variation along the plane which is related to various routes of pn formation .",
    "also the findings of numerous new pne will enable more rigorous statistical analysis .",

    "the initial search of [ fe@xmath4roman2 ]  emission from the known pne in the uwife survey resulted in a half dozen of detection from around 29 known pne ( 25 from @xcite and 4 from f2011 ) .",

    "for comparison , @xcite found all the 3 pne detected in [ fe@xmath4roman2 ]   show accompanying @xmath6  emission .",

    "lbvs belong to the most luminous stars in our galaxy ( thus with very large initial masses ) typified by their irregular variabilities , which are sometimes associated with eruptive mass loss .",
    "the best example of lbv star is @xmath85 car which is surrounded by an extremely massive circumstellar shell ( @xmath86 ) , believed to be a product of its 1840 s great ejection .",
    "the line emission from circumstellar shells around some lbvs has been a valuable tool to understand not only the physical process responsible for lbv mass loss but also the nature of the central star .",
    "nir lines , such as [ fe@xmath4roman2 ] , are well suited to study the shells around evolved massive stars as they are less affected by interstellar extinction . [ fe@xmath4roman2 ]",
    "emission is so far found in a half dozen of lbvs @xcite , and detailed studies of @xmath85  car have demonstrated the usefulness of the [ fe@xmath4roman2 ]  emission @xcite .    in our preliminary study , we searched for [ fe@xmath4roman2 ]  emission associated with known lbvs and candidate lbvs from . among several sources covered by the uwife survey , we detected [ fe@xmath4roman2 ]  emission from a few of them .",

    "the morphology of @xmath6  emission is similar to h@xmath10  and the thermal emission from the dust @xcite and is sharply peaked along the torus in the southwestern side . on the other hand , the [ fe@xmath4roman2 ]  emission is more diffuse and more extended toward the northeastern side .",
    "the only other lbv that shows both @xmath6  and [ fe@xmath4roman2 ]  emission is @xmath85  car . follow  up spectroscopic observations of hd  168625 will reveal detailed mass  loss history of the central star , as in the case of @xmath85  car @xcite .    from the uwish2 , [ fe@xmath4roman2 ]  from the uwife and broad  band j from the gps survey .",

    "strong nir [ fe@xmath4roman2 ]  lines are emitted when these shocks interact with dense material , which could be either the sn or the circumstellar material for young snrs , and usually interstellar material for middle - aged snrs .",
    "moreover , fe , being the end product of the stellar nucleosynthesis process , forms a main component of the supernova ejecta ; the materials ejected from the deep layers of the progenitor are often enriched in fe .",
    "the fe abundance can also be significantly enhanced in a shocked region if the interstellar dust is destroyed .    in the survey area",

    "we search for the [ fe@xmath4roman2 ]  emission around the positions of the known snrs .",

    "provide high - quality , wide - area views of detected snrs , for which , sometimes , only parts of the area were covered by the previous observations .",

    "the uwife survey is an _ unbiased _ survey , so that we have an opportunity to detect `` every '' dense , shocked gas with bright [ fe@xmath4roman2 ]  line emission in the inner galaxy , some of which would be serendipitous discoveries . in order to identify ifos in the uwife survey area",

    "unbiased imaging surveys of the galactic plane in the infrared broadband such as glimpse and mipsgal have greatly increased our understanding of the galaxy .",
