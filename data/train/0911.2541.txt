    "the spaces on the right are subcomplexes of @xmath0 and the right hand vertical map is inclusion of the @xmath179-skeleton .",
    "so by cellular approximation , all maps induce isomorphisms in @xmath180 for @xmath181 .    from the long exact sequence of a pair",
    ", it follows that @xmath182 is an isomorphism for @xmath183 .",
    "now let @xmath184 , which is an open neighborhood of @xmath24 in @xmath185 .",
    "@xmath157 consists of the open @xmath58-cell containing @xmath24 and any open @xmath179 cells which have that @xmath58-cell as a face .",
    "so @xmath157 looks like a finite collection of @xmath179-cells identified along part of their boundary , and @xmath24 is in that part of the common boundary .",
