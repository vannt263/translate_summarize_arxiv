    "the nlc final focus ( ffs ) optics  @xcite is designed to produce a very small vertical beam size of 3  nm at the interaction point ( ip ) in 500 gev _",
    "cms _ collisions . to attain these small spots ,",
    "the nlc ffs design includes a number of non - linear elements ; the optics for the nlc ffs is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : optics ] , where sextupoles are denoted with first letter `` s '' , octupoles with `` o '' , and decapoles with `` d '' .",
    "these correctors are used to compensate the high - order geometric and chromatic effects generated in the nominal ffs optics as well as fold the beam halo in on itself to reduce the number of large amplitude halo particles  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , alignment and field errors in the ffs are amplified by the strong focusing and may lead to enlargement of ip beam size and subsequent luminosity loss . to maintain the maximum luminosity",
    ", aberrations increasing the beam size at ip have to be corrected .",
    "the correction procedure envisioned for the nlc ffs is very similar to that implemented on the stanford linear collider ( slc ) ffs or the final focus test beam ( fftb ) @xcite :    1 .",
    "the quadrupoles are aligned using beam - based alignment techniques such as the shunting method , 2 .",
    "the sextupoles are aligned in a similar manner , 3 .",
    "trajectories are fit to verify the first - order optics and fix the phase advance between sextupoles , 4 .",
    "the sextupoles are set to minimize the chromaticity , 5 .",
    "global tuning correctors ( knobs ) are used to tune both the first - order and the nonlinear corrections using luminosity measurements .    in the following ,",
    "we describe a set of simple correction system ( knobs ) using a minimum number of magnets for independent control of individual ip aberrations .",
    "the knob correctors are located at optimum optical positions close to the ip to minimize the extent of optics perturbation .",
    "several knobs based on the ffs sextupoles have beed designed to correct linear and the second order optical aberrations at the ip .",
    "five knobs have been designed to correct the following linear aberrations at the ip : longitudinal position of horizontal ( @xmath0 ) and vertical ( @xmath1 ) beta waist , @xmath0 and @xmath1 dispersion , and @xmath0-@xmath1 coupling .",
    "correction of the first order aberrations requires adjustment of the normal and skew quadrupole field in the ffs .",
    "similar to tuning techniques at the slc  @xcite and the fftb , we used @xmath0 , @xmath1 offsets of the ffs sextupoles to make these knobs .",
    "one can verify that a sextupole displaced by @xmath2 and @xmath3 generates the following low order field on the reference orbit : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the sextupole gradient .",
    "therefore , the feed - down normal and skew quadrupole strengths are @xmath6 respectively , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 is the magnetic rigidity .",
    "the last terms in eqn .",
    "[ eq : dby ] ,  [ eq : dbx ] lead to additional orbit , quadratic in @xmath2 , @xmath9 , which may be not negligible for large offsets , however , it is assumed that this orbit will be cancelled by the ip steering correctors .",
    "correction efficiency of the ffs sextupoles is enhanced by the large beta functions and phase advance of @xmath10 from ip .",
    "enlargement of ip beam size and subsequent luminosity loss may be caused by longitudinal displacement @xmath11 of focusing waist and residual horizontal dispersion @xmath12 at ip .",
    "the waist displacement increases ip beta function as @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the ideal beta at ip . for maximum luminosity ,",
    "waist position has to be kept within @xmath15 .",
    "the beta waist and horizontal dispersion knobs have been constructed using horizontal sextupole offsets . according to eqn .",
    "[ eq : dk ] , @xmath2 creates a normal quadrupole field which distorts @xmath16 and @xmath17 functions .",
    "beta perturbation propagates to the ip and for @xmath10 results in a longitudinal shift of the beta waist .",
    "the shift caused by a single sextupole is approximately @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the sextupole length and beta function . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : optics ] , the dispersion @xmath21 is not zero in most of the ffs sextupoles , therefore @xmath2 also generates horizontal dispersion at ip : @xmath22    three sextupoles are required to construct three orthogonal knobs for the @xmath23 and @xmath12 aberrations . in each knob ,",
    "the sextupole offsets are varied linearly with the fixed scale factors to produce a desired amplitude of the aberration .",
    "the scale factors for @xmath2 offsets are listed in table  1 .",
    "note that two sextupoles are sufficient for @xmath24 and @xmath12 knobs for the following reasons . in the first case ,",
    "the ratio @xmath25 at sd0 and sf1 is about constant which results in correction of @xmath12 when @xmath26 is corrected . in the second case ,",
    "the @xmath27 transformation between sf5 and sf6 makes it possible to cancel @xmath26 and @xmath28 with one scale factor .",
