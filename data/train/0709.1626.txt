    "the reflection nebula ngc  1333 is one of the nearest low - mass star - forming regions and is associated with the classical herbig - haro ( hh ) objects hh  7 - 11 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . despite the importance of ngc  1333 for studying star - formation processes and the overall structure of the larger molecular cloud complex , the distance to ngc  1333 is still quite uncertain .",
    "ngc  1333 is located in the perseus complex of dark clouds , which forms a chain of several clouds with a size of @xmath3 , elongated perpendicular to the galactic plane ( @xcite , 1993 ) .",
    "the molecular clouds associated with ngc  1333 are located at the western edge of the chain , while the young open clusters ic  348 and perseus  ob2 are at the eastern edge of this chain ( @xcite , 1993 ) .",
    "the large scale structure of the perseus dark cloud complex has been studied extensively ( @xcite , 1993 ; @xcite ) . according to these studies",
    ", there is a gradient in distance across the complex ( see fig.9 of @xcite ) ; ngc  1333 is the nearest cloud at a distance of 220  pc ( @xcite ) and ic  348 and the perseus ob2 association are at a distance of 318 - 340  pc ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "although hipparcos provided an accurate distance to the perseus ob2 association , based on an annual parallax measurement of 318@xmath127  pc ( @xcite ) , the distance to ngc  1333 and the other dark clouds have been measured only through optical photometry , with a typical uncertainties of about 25% ( @xcite , 1993 ) .",
    "therefore , further precise astrometry allowing an accurate annual parallax measurement is necessary to reveal overall structure of the chain of the molecular clouds in the perseus region .",
    "the young stellar object ( yso ) svs  13 is located at the base of hh  7 - 11 in ngc  1333 and has been proposed to be a powering source of the jets and outflows in this region ( @xcite ) .",
    "high - resolution observations with radio interferometers at centimeter and millimeter wavelengths have been conducted to investigate the complex nature of this system .",
    "very large array ( vla ) observations at 3.6  cm wavelength reveal a radio continuum source vla4 that appears to be associated with svs  13 ( @xcite , 1999 ) .",
    "higher resolution vla observations of svs  13 at the same wavelength resolved vla4 into a double radio source , denoted vla4a and vla4b ( @xcite ) , with the separation angle of 0.3 .",
    "@xcite reported that the position of svs  13 coincides with the western component , vla4a , while that of the millimeter source ( @xcite ) is associated with the eastern component , vla4b .",
    "vla4b is suggested to have larger amount of circumstellar material than vla4a , based on the subsequent high - resolution vla observations in the 7  mm band ( @xcite ) .    although hh  7 - 11 have been proposed to be powered by svs  13",
    ", @xcite argued that another radio continuum source vla3 , located 6  southwest of svs  13 , is a more favorable candidate for the powering source due to the better alignment of vla3 with the hh objects .",
    "in contrast , @xcite presented the results of the interferometric co @xmath4=2 - 1 observations of hh  7 - 11 that indicate that the extremely high velocity ( ehv ) molecular outflow is powered by svs  13 , rather than vla3 which has no high velocity co outflow .",
    "@xcite also suggested that vla3 ( or millimeter source a2 in their paper ) is a less likely candidate for the source that powers hh  7 - 11 .",
    "@xcite claimed that both vla3 and svs  13 ( vla4b is favorable rather than 4a ) could be the powering source of hh  7 - 11 .",
    "despite the fact that the axes of the hh jets and molecular outflows are similar , their exciting sources could be different , since there are several ysos in a small area .",
    "in fact , it is possible that there is more than one molecular outflow because , as noted by @xcite , inspection of figure 2 of @xcite shows that the ehv outflow is associated with vla4 , while the standard high velocity ( shv ) gas is found in the vicinity of both vla3 and vla4 .",
    "thus the origin of the jets , molecular outflows , and hh  7 - 11 is still ambiguous and might be revealed through accurate proper motion measurements .",
    "proper motions can be accurately measured by phase - referencing vlbi observations . if one employs extragalactic radio sources as the position references , one can measure the absolute position of the target source ( @xcite ) , making it feasible to derive its annual parallax as well as the absolute proper motion .",
    "highly precise vlbi astrometric observations have been carried out for the galactic ch@xmath5oh and h@xmath0o maser source w3(oh ) with the nrao very long baseline array ( vlba ) , which yielded distances of 2.0  kpc from the sun with uncertainties of about 2% , based on the annual parallax method ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "recently , we have constructed a new vlbi network in japan called vera , vlbi exploration of radio astrometry ( @xcite ) , which is the first vlbi array dedicated to phase - referencing astrometry .",
    "initial results of vera observations have been reported ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , in which absolute proper motions and annual parallaxes are measured for galactic h@xmath0o maser sources at distances ranging from 178  pc for iras  16293 - 2422 ( @xcite ) to 5.28  kpc for s269 ( @xcite ) , demonstrating vera s astrometric capability .    in this paper , we present the results of astrometry of the h@xmath0o masers associated with svs  13 in ngc  1333 with vera .",
    "these observations have been done as one of the initial scientific projects of vera : measurements of annual parallaxes of nearby molecular clouds ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "svs  13 is known to be one of the brightest h@xmath0o maser sources among the known low - mass ysos ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , there is a bright icrf source , j0336@xmath63218 , which is separated from svs  13 by an angle of @xmath7 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the aim of this paper is to measure the distance to ngc  1333 as well as to explore the powering source of the jets and outflows in this region through the maser positions and proper motions .",
    "the vera observations of h@xmath0o masers ( @xmath8-@xmath9 , 22235.080 mhz ) associated with svs  13 were carried out for 10  hours in each of 7 observing sessions from nov .",
    "2004 to may 2005 ( 2004/317 , 2004/355 , 2005/021 , 2005/052 , 2005/080 , 2005/113 , and 2005/140 ; hereafter an observing session is denoted by year / day of the year ) at intervals of about 1  month .",
    "all 4 stations of vera ( see fig.1 of @xcite ) took part in all sessions , providing a maximum baseline length of 2270  km .",
    "observations were made in the dual beam mode ; the h@xmath0o masers associated with svs  13 and a reference source j0336@xmath63218 ( @xcite ) , with the separation angle of @xmath7 , were observed simultaneously .",
    "the instrumental phase difference between the two beams was measured continuously during the observations by injecting artificial noise sources into both beams at each station ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the typical value of the phase drift between the two beams was 3 degrees per hour , which was removed from the data .",
    "left - handed circular polarization was received and sampled with 2-bit quantization and filtered using the vera digital filter unit ( @xcite ) .",
    "the data were recorded onto magnetic tapes at a rate of 128  mbps , with two if channels of 16  mhz bandwidth each for both svs  13 and j0336@xmath63218 .",
    "j0336@xmath63218 was detected with a peak intensity greater than 1.2  jy  beam@xmath2 in all the sessions , so it was also used for bandpass and delay calibration .",
    "system temperatures and atmospheric attenuation were measured with the chopper - wheel method ( @xcite ) , and typical values were 100 - 400  k , depending on weather conditions and elevation angles of the observed sources .",
    "the aperture efficiencies of the antennas ranged from 45 to 52% .",
    "correlation processing was carried out on the mitaka fx correlator ( @xcite ) located at the naoj mitaka campus .",
    "for h@xmath0o maser lines , the spectral resolution was set to be 15.625  khz , corresponding to the velocity resolution of 0.21  km  s@xmath2 .",
    "( 80mm,80mm)figure1.eps    data reduction was performed using the nrao astronomical image processing system ( aips ) .",
    "amplitude and bandpass calibration were done for the target ( svs  13 ) and reference ( j0336@xmath63218 ) sources independently . for phase calibration ,",
    "fringe fitting was done with the aips task fring on the phase reference source ( j0336@xmath63218 ) , and the solutions were applied to the target source ( svs  13 ) .",
    "in addition , we applied the results of the dual - beam phase calibration measurements ( @xcite ) .",
    "we also corrected for the approximate delay model adopted in the correlation processing ( @xcite ) and for drifts of the visibility phase caused by the earth s atmosphere based on the gps measurements .",
    "we first searched for h@xmath0o maser `` spots '' , defined as emission occurring in a single velocity channel , in fringe - rate maps with the aips task frmap .",
    "we found that the h@xmath0o masers were detected toward two different sources in ngc  1333 ; one was associated with svs  13 , which was previously identified to be h@xmath0o(a ) by @xcite , and another was located 34  southwest from svs  13 , corresponding to the radio continuum source vla2 and h@xmath0o(b ) by @xcite .",
    "the h@xmath0o masers associated with vla2 were detected only in the first three sessions from 2004/317 to 2005/021 . because the positions of the maser spots associated with vla2 are shifted by 34  southwest of the phase - tracking center , the synthesized images are significantly distorted due to the time - averaging smearing effect ( @xcite ) , making it almost impossible to conduct accurate astrometry .",
    "therefore , we do not discuss the masers associated with vla2 in this paper .",
    "high resolution synthesis imaging and deconvolution ( clean ) were done for the maser spots associated with svs  13 using the aips task imagr .",
    "the image size of each map was 51.2  mas@xmath1051.2  mas with the pixel size of 0.1  mas@xmath100.1  mas .",
    "the naturally - weighted synthesized - beam size ( fwmh ) was typically 1.3  mas@xmath100.9  mas with a position angle of @xmath11 . with a net integration time of 7  hours for the h@xmath0o maser lines , the resultant rms noise levels of the phase - referenced images ranged from 0.06  jy  beam@xmath2 to 0.16  jy  beam@xmath2 in a single spectral channel .",
    "we regard the h@xmath0o maser spot to be real if the signal to noise ratio of the peak intensity is larger than 5 times the noise level ( 5@xmath12 ) for at least two consecutive channels , provided the positions are coincident within the synthesized beam size . in order to improve the signal to noise ratios in the phase - referenced images",
    ", we made integrated intensity maps of the maser features , by summing the channel maps over the detected velocity range .",
    "the peak positions and peak intensities of maser features were derived by fitting elliptical gaussian brightness distributions to these integrated intensity maps using the aips task jmfit .",
    "the formal uncertainties in the feature positions given by jmfit were 0.03 - 0.1  mas , depending on the signal to noise ratios of the features and possibly their spatial structure .",
    "the uncertainties in the peak intensities were 0.1 - 0.3  jy  beam@xmath2 ( 1@xmath12 ) which were approximately equal to or slightly larger than the rms noise levels of the phase - referenced images .",
    "figure [ fig - spectra ] shows the spectra of the h@xmath0o masers associated with svs  13 , which are obtained by fitting gaussian brightness distributions to each channel map .",
    "we detected two spatially distinct h@xmath0o maser features at the lsr velocities of 7 - 8  km  s@xmath2 , which agree well with the ambient cloud velocity ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "hereafter we call them as feature 1 and 2 , as explained later .",
    "we did not find other velocity components detected previously by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , due to the variability of the h@xmath0o masers ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig - vshift ] , the peak velocity of each maser feature was found to drift systematically from 7.0  km  s@xmath2 to 7.9  km  s@xmath2 during the observing period of 6  months , at a rate of 1.7  km  s@xmath2  yr@xmath2 .",
    "it is likely that the observed velocity drift indicates true acceleration of the maser feature as discussed later , although we can not rule out the possibilities of a change in strength of blended hyperfine components ( @xcite ) or the structure in the maser feature .",
    "( 80m,80mm)figure2.eps    figure [ fig - allspot ] shows the positions of the maser spots and features associated with svs  13 .",
    "initially , we found only feature 1 in the sessions 2004/317 - 2005/021 , as seen in the spectra ( figure [ fig - spectra ] ) . in the session 2005/052 , feature 2 appeared at 4.5 mas north of feature 1",
    "the two features existed at almost the same lsr velocities of about 7.5  km  s@xmath2 in the sessions 2005/052 and 2005/080 . in 2005/080 , feature  2 became brighter than feature  1 , which disappeared in the subsequent session 2005/113 .",
    "feature  2 remained until the session 2005/140 , while all the h@xmath0o masers associated with svs  13 finally disappeared after the 6-month monitoring period of our observations .",
    "we can see the internal structures of the maser features , which are the collections of several maser spots , in figure [ fig - allspot ] .",
    "the dispersions of the maser spots within the features , 0.04 - 0.27  mas , are significantly smaller than the synthesized beam size , except for those detected in the session 2005/021 in which we found two different groups of spots with the separation of 1  mas .",
    "these northern spots correspond to the weak red shifted shoulder at the lsr velocity of 7.5 - 7.7  km  s@xmath2 as seen in figure [ fig - spectra ] and can be recognized as part of the elongated structure of the maser feature in the integrated intensity map .",
    "these results suggest that the peak position of the maser feature possibly affect the astrometric accuracy ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) , as discussed in the next section .",
    "( 80mm,80mm)figure3.eps      as shown in figure [ fig - allspot ] , the movement of the masers significantly deviates from a simple linear motion ; as we will show the data can be well modeled by the effects of an annual parallax .",
    "assuming that the movement of the maser feature is the sum of a linear motion and the annual parallax , we derive the proper motions in right ascension @xmath13 and declination @xmath14 , the initial positions in right ascension @xmath15 and declination @xmath16 , and the annual parallax @xmath17 for the maser feature by a least - squares analysis as summarized in table [ tab - results ] and figure [ fig - ra ] . in the least - squares analysis",
    ", we determined the proper motions and initial positions of two maser features independently , while the annual parallax of svs  13 is common for both features . according to @xcite and @xcite",
    ", the precision of the derived annual parallax is significantly improved when we use only the data for right ascension , as this data is less affected by atmospheric modeling errors . in this manner , we find the annual parallax of the h@xmath0o maser features associated with svs  13 in ngc  1333 to be 4.25@xmath10.32  mas , corresponding to a distance of 235@xmath118  pc .",
    "we note that the parallax derived from the right ascension data fits the declination data quite well .",

    "thus , the distance to ngc  1333 is most likely 235  pc , which is consistent with the photometric distance to ngc  1333 reported by @xcite of 220  pc with an uncertainty of 25% , rather than the larger value of about 300  pc ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this is the first time that the distance to ngc  1333 is determined based on an annual parallax measurement with an uncertainty of only 8% .",
    "even though the observing period was as short as 6  months , our results provide a strong constraint on the distance to ngc  1333 with higher precision than that of the photometric method ( @xcite ) .    unfortunately , the masers associated with svs  13 completely disappeared after the 6-month monitoring observations with vera",
    ". we will continue long - term monitoring observations of the h@xmath0o maser sources in ngc  1333 , including svs  13 and others such as iras2 and iras4 ( @xcite ) , which may enable us to improve the accuracy of the annual parallax measurements with vera .",
    "combining our new results with those of @xcite based on the hipparcos measurements of the distance to the perseus ob2 association , 318@xmath127  pc , we provide a definite evidence for a distance gradient along the chain of molecular clouds in the perseus region as proposed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "although we determine the distance to only one h@xmath0o maser source associated with svs  13 in ngc  1333 in this paper , we should be able to reveal the overall 3-dimensional structure of the perseus molecular cloud complex through the further vlbi astrometry of other h@xmath0o maser sources in this region .",
    "the standard deviations of the post - fit residuals from the least - squares analysis , 0.10  mas and 0.29  mas in right ascension and declination , respectively , are significantly larger than the formal errors in the gaussian fitting of the maser features , 0.03 - 0.1  mas , implying that some systematic errors significantly affect our astrometry .",
    "although it is difficult to estimate the sources of the systematic errors in the vlbi astrometry quantitatively ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , they are mainly due to ( 1 ) the difference in the optical path lengths between the target and reference sources caused by the atmospheric zenith delay residual and/or ( 2 ) the variability of the structure of the maser feature for the following three reasons .    first , the optical path length error due to an atmospheric zenith delay residual of 3  cm , which is typical for vera observations ( @xcite ) , would cause a relative position error of 0.3  mas , for the case of svs  13 and j0336@xmath63218 with a separation angle of @xmath7 at an elevation angle of 20  degrees .",
    "this is comparable to the standard deviation of the post - fit residuals , especially in declination .",
    "because the elevation angle of the sources was always higher than 20  degrees , the estimated position error of 0.3  mas gives an upper limit .",
    "nevertheless , the atmospheric zenith delay residual could contribute significantly to the error sources in our astrometry , especially in declination .",
    "second , the internal structures in the maser features are found to be 0.04 - 0.27  mas based on our channel maps of the maser spots .",
    "sometimes , the positions of the maser spots within a feature are spread over more than 1  mas , as found in the session 2005/021 .",
    "thus structural changes might explain the 1  mas declination residual in the data point of session 2004/355 in figure [ fig - ra ] .",
    "this data point is clearly an outlier .",
    "however , the magnitude of the possible change in the feature positions due to the variation of the internal structure of the maser spots certainly could be comparable to the dispersion of the positions of the maser spots .",
    "this effect has also been found in the previous results with vera , in particular for the h@xmath0o maser sources associated with nearby molecular clouds ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "third , the uncertainties in the station positions , delay model , and path length errors due to ionosphere would have negligible effects on our astrometry , according to the discussions in @xcite .",
    "the uncertainties in the absolute position of j0336@xmath63218 are reported to be 0.46  mas and 0.56  mas in right ascension and declination , respectively ( @xcite ) .",
    "these uncertainties do not affect the derived annual parallax and proper motion because they would add only a constant offsets to the position of the maser features .    in summary",
    ", we conclude that the astrometric accuracy in our observations is mainly limited by the atmospheric zenith delay error and/or the structure of the maser features .",
    "along with the annual parallax , we successfully measured the absolute positions and proper motions of the h@xmath0o maser features with vera .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig - map](b ) , the detected maser features are likely to be physically related to vla4a , only 0.2  ( 50  au at the inferred distance of 235  pc ) from the maser features , rather than vla4b or other sources .",
    "the association of the maser features in the lsr velocity of 7 - 8  km  s@xmath2 with vla4a is in agreement with the suggestion by @xcite .",
    "they also reported that another group of the h@xmath0o masers at the lsr velocities ranging from @xmath23 to @xmath24  km  s@xmath2 is associated with vla4b , suggesting the presence of an outflow from vla4b ( @xcite ) .",
    "although the outflow activity of vla4b can not be excluded by our results without any detection of the h@xmath0o masers associated with vla4b , the present results show that vla4a is the most favorable candidate for the powering source of the observed h@xmath0o masers .",
    "( 160m,160mm)figure5.eps    figure [ fig - map](b ) and table [ tab - results ] show the absolute proper motions of the maser features associated with svs  13 .",
    "both features are moving toward southeast with position angles of 114@xmath25 and 133@xmath25 , respectively , which are apparently in good agreement with the alignment of the hh objects traced by the optical emission ( @xcite ) and molecular outflows traced by the co @xmath4=2 - 1 line ( @xcite ) .",
    "although the absolute proper motions of the maser features seem to be well aligned with the jets and outflows previously reported , we must stress that the proper motions obtained with vera do not represent the `` intrinsic '' proper motions of the maser features because they are measured with respect to the sun and , hence , include the contribution of the solar motion .",
    "if we assume the solar motion relative to the lsr based on the hipparcos satellite data , ( @xmath26)=(10.00 , 5.25 , 7.17 )  km  s@xmath2 ( @xcite ) , we can calculate the contribution of the solar motion to the observed absolute proper motion to be 3.7  mas  yr@xmath2 and @xmath27  mas  yr@xmath2 in right ascension and declination , respectively .",
    "subtracting these values from the observed proper motions listed in table [ tab - results ] , the proper motions of the h@xmath0o maser features with respect to the lsr in right ascension and declination are obtained to be ( 14.2 , -0.6 )  mas  yr@xmath2 and ( 6.9 , @xmath28 )  mas  yr@xmath2 , for the features 1 and 2 , respectively , as shown in figure [ fig - map](b ) .",
    "they are significantly different from those based on the absolute proper motions .    using the proper motions with respect to the lsr rather than the absolute ones",
    ", we will discuss the possible origin of the h@xmath0o masers associated with svs  13 .",
    "first , we rule out the possibility that galactic rotation accounts for the observed proper motions , because the contribution of galactic rotation would be only @xmath29  mas  yr@xmath2 , which is estimated by assuming @xmath30 of 8.0  kpc ( @xcite ) and @xmath31 of 236  km  s@xmath2 ( @xcite ) .",
    "one of the most plausible explanations is that the proper motions of the maser features are due to the jet from vla4a .",
    "in fact , vla4a is proposed to be a powering source of the hh jets and molecular outflows as mentioned above ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "if vla4a is at rest with respect to the lsr , the proper motions of the h@xmath0o masers with respect to the lsr , 15.8  km  s@xmath2 ( 14.2  mas  yr@xmath2 ) and 8.3  km  s@xmath2 ( 7.4  mas  yr@xmath2 ) for the features 1 and 2 , respectively , represent the motions relative to vla4a .",
    "these observed transverse velocities are consistent with the jets and outflows previously observed in this region ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , the directions of the proper motions are not parallel to the jets from vla4a ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , positions of the maser features are not exactly aligned with the hh objects and molecular outflows from vla4a . however , vla4a itself might hava a proper motion with respect to the lsr , which could account for the apparent discrepancy found in the geometry of vla4a and jets traced by the h@xmath0o masers .",
    "it is worth considering that the observed proper motions are due to a rotating circumstellar disk of vla4a . according to @xcite , vla4b , a companion of the close binary system including vla4a , has a circumstellar disk with the size and mass of @xmath3230  au and 0.06@xmath33 , respectively , while the mass of the circumstellar disk of vla4a is at least 5 times smaller than that of vla4b .",
    "note , however , that we detected a signature of acceleration of the maser features as shown in figure [ fig - vshift ] , which might be indicative of rotating disk ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "if we simply assume an edge - on disk with a rotation velocity @xmath34 of 12  km  s@xmath2 , which equals to the mean proper motion of the maser features , the radius of the disk , @xmath35 , can be derived from the relationship @xmath36 to be 18  au , where @xmath37 is the drift rate of the radial velocity of the maser features , 1.7  km  s@xmath2  yr@xmath2 .",
    "the inferred radius of the disk is in good agreement with that of vla4b ( @xmath3230  au ; @xcite ) , but it is slightly smaller than the separation from vla4a , @xmath3850  au . as a result",
    ", the enclosed mass within the radius of 18  au is estimated to be 3@xmath33 .",
    "this value gives lower limit of the mass because we simply assume the inclination axis of the disk to be 0@xmath25 .",
    "the mass of the envelope associated with svs  13 is derived to be of order 1@xmath33 based on the interferometric millimeter wave observations of dust continuum emission ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , the luminosity of svs  13 is as low as @xmath3822@xmath39 ( @xcite ) , suggesting that it should be a low - mass yso . although these results agree well with the mass of 3@xmath33 estimated from the circumstellar disk model , the position of the disk ( the maser features ) and the yso ( radio continuum source ) is inconsistent with the edge - on disk model .",
    "the results of our astrometry of the maser features are still puzzling because the positions and proper motions of the maser features with respect to vla4a do not fully satisfy the requirements for either a jet or a rotating circumstellar disk associated with vla4a .",
    "one of the reasons for this discrepancy arises from the lack of the absolute proper motion measurements of vla4a and other possible candidates for the powering source of the masers .",
    "the proper motion vectors could be changed significantly by subtracting the absolute proper motion vector of vla4a , making us reconsider all the possibilities discussed above .",
    "other possibilities such as an orbital motion of the binary system consisting of vla4a and vla4b ( e.g. @xcite , 2004 ; @xcite ) could be tested if we measure the proper motions of vla4a and vla4b .",
    "further high - precision astrometry of the maser features together with the possible candidate for their powering sources ( i.e. vla4a and other radio continuum sources in ngc1333 ) is essential to solve this problem ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we present the results of multi - epoch vlbi astrometric observations of the 22  ghz h@xmath0o masers associated with svs  13 in the ngc  1333 region with vera .",
    "the principal results of this paper are summarized as follows .",
    "we have determined the annual parallax of the h@xmath0o masers associated with svs  13 to be 4.25@xmath10.32  mas , corresponding to a distance of 235@xmath118 pc from the sun .",
    "although the inferred distance of 235  pc is consistent with the photometric distance of 220  pc estimated by @xcite , our results provide the distance to ngc  1333 with much higher accuracy than the photometric methods .",
    "the standard deviations of the post - fit residuals for the annual parallax and proper motion measurements are 0.10  mas and 0.29  mas in right ascension and declination , respectively .",
    "the astrometric error sources in our observations are discussed , and they are attributed to the difference in the optical path lengths between the target and reference sources caused by the atmospheric zenith delay errors and/or the variability of the structures of the maser features .",
    "the absolute positions and proper motions of the h@xmath0o maser features at the lsr velocities of 7 - 8  km  s@xmath2 are derived , revealing that they are most likely associated with the radio continuum source vla4a , based on the observation that the projected distances of the maser features are only 50  au from vla4a .",
    "we considered the possible origin of the observed proper motions of the maser features and found it difficult to explain the positions and the proper motions of the maser features in terms of either the jet or the rotating circumstellar disk associated with vla4a solely based on the present results .",
    "further highly precise astrometric observations of the maser features and radio continuum sources including vla4a would be necessary to reveal the complex nature found in the hh  7 - 11 region in ngc  1333 .",
