    "the best estimate for the sum of the baryonic mass currently observed in stars , neutral hydrogen , and x - ray emitting gas in clusters of galaxies ( fukugita , hogan , & peebles 1998 ) falls short of the most - likely value predicted by standard big - bang nucleosynthesis ( burles & tytler 1998 ) .",
    "numerical simulations suggest that most of the missing baryons reside in a hot intergalactic medium , which is too rarefied to be detectable through its x - ray emission or the sunyaev - zeldovich effect ( e.g. , ostriker & cen 1996 ; theuns et al .",
    "much of this gas resides in the outskirts of galaxy groups or clusters , and hence is likely to possess a similar metallicity to that observed in the x - ray emission spectrum from the cores of these systems ( mushotzky et al . 1996 ) . in this paper",
    "we explore the possibility of detecting this hot intergalactic medium through the x - ray absorption lines imprinted by its metals on the spectrum of a background quasar .",
    "detection of x - ray absorption lines from galaxy clusters had been suggested in the past as a means of measuring distances ( krolik & raymond 1988 ; sarazin 1989 ) . however , because of the limited sensitivity of x - ray instruments at that time , these early papers restricted their attention to the strong lines produced in the cores of rich clusters and hence to the unlikely superposition of a quasar behind such cores . the next generation of x - ray telescopes , manifested at their best by the successor to axaf , constellation - x ( see http:// constellation.gsfc.nasa.gov ) , will achieve a much greater sensitivity than previously imagined .",
    "it is therefore the purpose of this paper to quantify the full probability distribution of equivalent widths for the intergalactic x - ray absorption lines imprinted on the spectrum of any _ random _ quasar .",
    "since much of the baryonic mass is currently assembled into virialized objects and since the present nonlinear mass - scale is that of galaxy groups , most of the absorption lines would be produced by gas in the outskirts of these groups . in ",
    "2 we combine the press - schechter mass function and the singular - isothermal - sphere model to predict the density and temperature distribution of this gas in a standard cdm cosmology with @xmath2 .",
    "we used a bardeen et al .",
    "( 1986 ) power spectrum with a tilted primordial index of @xmath3 . because the power - spectrum is normalized on the cluster mass scale , our results depend only weakly on the choice of the power spectrum shape ( and agree by construction with x - ray data for the temperature function of groups and clusters ;",
    "see , e.g. henry et al .",
    "we assume an @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 cosmology throughout the discussion . in ",
    "3 we compute the corresponding statistics of the absorption lines produced by highly - ionized metals in this gas . finally ,  4 summarizes the main conclusions of this work .",
    "observations of the x - ray surface brightness of galaxy clusters are commonly fitted by the isothermal @xmath7-model .",
    "this model assumes that the gas temperature is constant and the radial profile of its mass density is given by @xmath8^{-3\\beta/2}\\ ; , \\label{eq : ro}\\ ] ] with @xmath9 being the core radius .",
    "typical values for the parameters of this functional fit are clustered around @xmath10 mpc and @xmath11 ( jones & forman 1984 ) ; for specificity , we adopt these values throughout our discussion",
    ". the central density can be matched at large radii far from the core ( @xmath12 ) , to that of a singular isothermal profile , @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the global mass fraction of the gas ( assumed to equal the universal baryon - to - total matter density ratio ) , @xmath15 is the gas temperature , @xmath16 is the proton mass , and @xmath17 is the mean atomic weight .",

    "the fractional abundance of the ion @xmath38 is only a function of temperature ( sarazin & bahcall 1977 ) , i.e. @xmath39 .",
    "we ignore photoionization by the x - ray background since we focus on the high density environments of virialized objects ( in which the highest equivalent - width lines are expected to occur ) where collisional ionization dominates .",
    "the collisional ionization / recombination time is typically much shorter than the hubble time at the temperatures ( @xmath40 kev ) and overdensities ( @xmath41 ) of interest here . assuming a uniform metallicity , the column density of the ion @xmath38 is then @xmath42 where 0.92 is the fraction of hydrogen atoms by number .",

    "we have assumed that the spectral lines are only thermally broadened , since the lines are generically not saturated and so turbulent broadening has a negligible influence on their equivalent width .",
    "the fractional abundance @xmath64 has been computed by interpolating the data from the tables of arnaud & rothenflug ( 1985 ) for o viii and of arnaud & raymond ( 1992 ) for fe xxv .",
    "we have assumed the metallicity of the gas to be @xmath65 for iron and @xmath66 for oxygen ( see , e.g. mushotzky et al .",
    "1996 ; gibson et al . 1997 ; fukuzawa et al .",
    "1998 ) with the solar metallicity abundances taken from anders & grevesse ( 1989 ) .",
    "figure 1a shows that at low redshifts most of the collapsed baryons can be probed by an instrument with a sensitivity @xmath0 ev to the o viii line .",
    "the fraction is lower but still substantial at moderate reshifts , as shown in figure 1b .",
    "overall , the baryonic mass probed in absorption extends up to an order of magnitude above the value probed by the conventional methods of detecting x - ray emission ( fukugita et al .",
    "the o viii line traces more baryons than the fe xxv line , since the oxygen ion exists in the temperature regime of @xmath67@xmath68 kev while the iron ion is abundant only at temperatures @xmath69 kev ( arnaud & rothenflug 1985 ) .",
    "the lower temperature regime is characteristic of galaxy groups ( henry et al .",
    "1995 ; burns et al .",
    "1996 ) , which contain most of the mass in the present - day universe .    in order to assess the feasibility of these observations it is useful to estimate the expected number of absorbers of a given equivalent width per unit redshift .",

    "correspondingly , the differential cross - section for detecting a resonant absorption line with an equivalent width between @xmath75 and @xmath76 is given by @xmath77(w^i)=[d\\sigma / d n^i](n^i(w^i))|dn^i / dw^i|_{n^i = n^i(w^i)}$ ] .",

    "finally , by integrating over the cluster temperature distribution , we derive the probability of observing an absorption line with an equivalent width between @xmath75 and @xmath76 per unit redshift at a redshift @xmath58 , @xmath80 where in the adopted @xmath4 cosmology the redshift derivative of cosmic path length is given by @xmath81 , with @xmath82 being the hubble constant .",
    "figure 2 shows this probability distribution at the redshifts @xmath60 [ panel ( a ) ] and @xmath61 [ panel ( b ) ] for the previously mentioned absorption lines of o viii ( solid line ) and fe xxv ( dashed line ) .",
    "we find that the spectrum of any _ random _ quasar at @xmath83 is expected to show several o viii lines with an equivalent width @xmath0 ev due to intervening gaseous halos of galaxy groups .",
    "finally , we would like to estimate the detectability of the predicted absorption signal for an x - ray telescope of a given area and spectral resolution .",
    "the maximum signal - to - noise ratio , s / n , is dictated by photon counting statistics . given the characteristic surface brightness distribution of clusters , emission by the intracluster gas can be ignored at several core radii for a characteristic telescope aperture @xmath84 .",
    "the required number of continuum photons from the quasar which the detector must receive within its spectral resolution bin of width @xmath85 around the line is ( sarazin 1989 ) , @xmath86 correspondingly , the flux from the quasar at the line energy @xmath47 needs to be @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the collecting aperture of the telescope , @xmath89 is the quantum efficiency of the detector , and @xmath90 is the integration time of the observation . the future constellation - x telescope with its planned effective area of @xmath91 and resolution of @xmath92 could therefore detect an o viii line with @xmath93 kev and an equivalent - width @xmath94 ev at a signal - to - noise ratio @xmath95 after @xmath96 seconds of integration on a quasar with @xmath97 .",
    "based on the number counts of quasars brighter than a flux @xmath98 in the 0.53.5 kev band , @xmath99 ( maccacaro et al .",
    "1982 ) and the intrinsic soft x - ray spectrum of quasars @xmath100 ( laor et al . 1997 ) , we estimate that there should be several hundred quasars above the necessary flux threshold across the sky .",
    "figure 1 therefore implies that constellation - x will be able to probe up to 70% of the hot gas in the outskirts of groups or clusters of galaxies through the o viii resonant absorption line .",
    "we have investigated the possibility of using the x - ray absorption spectrum of a background quasar to probe the presence of heavy elements in the outer regions of groups and clusters of galaxies .",
    "figure 1 demonstrates that observations of the o viii line with an equivalent width sensitivity @xmath101 ev should be able to probe most of the baryonic material out to the virial radius of these systems , well beyond the regions where x - ray emission is currently detected .",
    "we estimate that there should be several such o viii absorption lines per unit redshift along the line of sight to any quasar ( cf .",
    "2 ) . the future constellation - x telescope will be able to detect these lines with a signal - to - noise ratio @xmath1 in a day of integration for any of the few hundred brightest quasars accross the sky .",
    "our model assumed that the gas in groups or clusters of galaxies is isothermal .",
    "the modest radial decline which was observed recently with asca for the temperature of the gas in the outer parts of clusters ( markevitch et al .",
    "1998 ) , might make absorption features by ionic species such as o vii more prominent than o viii in the x - ray absorption spectra of quasars . on",
    "the other hand , energy input by the same supernovae that enrich the gas with metals might increase the temperature of x - ray halos beyond the value adopted in equation  ( [ eq : m - t ] ) ( which was calibrated based on numerical simulations of gravitational dynamics only ) .    in our calculations",
    "we have assumed a constant metallicity of the gas ; a reduced metal abundance due to inefficient mixing in the outer parts of groups and clusters would obviously lower our predicted signal .",
    "if absorption will be detected for some quasars , it would be interesting to correlate the absorption line redshift and sky position with x - ray or optical catalogs of galaxy clusters .",
    "if a group or a cluster are identified at the absorption redshift , it would be possible to infer the impact paramter @xmath31 , and the metallicity @xmath102 , using equations  ( [ eq : ni ] ) and  ( [ eq : w ] ) . observations of the o viii line around x - ray clusters at different redshifts could trace the distribution of metals in the intergalactic medium and possibly shed light on the epoch and nature of the metal enrichment process .",
