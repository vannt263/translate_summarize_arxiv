    "low - temperature heat transport has been extensively studied for high-@xmath7 cuprates , since it not only provides the most straightforward information of quasiparticle ( qp ) transport properties and the peculiar electronic state , but also shows rich physics like the magnon heat transport of low - dimensional spin system , the phonon heat transport and its interaction with peculiar spin / charge order .",

    "the size of qp peak ( the enhancement from the minimum near @xmath7 to the peak is 1.1 w / km or 25 % ) is among the largest in bi2212 single crystals that have ever been studied,@xcite confirming the high quality of the crystals . in pure samples , either increasing or decreasing the hole concentration results in the weakening of the qp peak while the magnitude of total thermal conductivity monotonously decreases with decreasing the hole concentration .",
    "furthermore , the peak suppression is much more significant in the underdoped samples than that in the overdoped samples , which is possibly related to the nanoscale inhomogeneity found by stm experiments in the superconducting state of this compound.@xcite this behavior is very similar to that in the zn - doped bi2212,@xcite in which local suppression of the superconductivity leading to a patchy superconducting state is playing a role.@xcite upon doping dy , the qp peak is also strongly suppressed but a new peak at 10 k emerges .",
    "interestingly , in the dy81 ( @xmath6 = 0.17 ) sample , both the qp peak and the 10 k peak show up , which means that the 10 k peak is not directly related to the qp heat transport .",
    "this low-@xmath11 peak is the strongest in the dy45 ( @xmath6 = 0.30 ) sample and survives in the non - superconducting sample ( dy0 , @xmath6 = 0.53 ) , which clearly indicates that it originates from the phonon heat transport .    in the undoped compound of other cuprates , like la@xmath2cuo@xmath27 , yba@xmath2cu@xmath23o@xmath51 , nd@xmath2cuo@xmath27 and pr@xmath35la@xmath36cuo@xmath27 , the phonon heat transport behaves similarly to that of common insulators and shows a large phonon peak around 20 k , whose magnitude varies between @xmath31 20 and @xmath31 80 w / km.@xcite however , it is known that bi2212 system has much dirtier phonon heat transport than other cuprates,@xcite probably due to the strong disorder of the crystal lattice caused by the excess oxygen and the incommensurate superlattice along the @xmath33 axis .",
    "the incommensurate modulation had been discussed to be related to the extra oxygen locating in bio double layers and the lattice mismatch between the bio block and the cuo@xmath2 layer.@xcite in an earlier work , the thermal conductivity of bi2212 parent material was studied in bi@xmath2sr@xmath2ycu@xmath2o@xmath28 and it was found that the phonon heat transport is too weak to give rise to the phonon peak ( only a hump - like feature observed at 20  30 k with the magnitude of @xmath1 smaller than 2 w / km).@xcite to our knowledge , the present result shows the phonon peak of bi2212 for the first time .",
    "it is not surprising that the phonon peak is located at much lower temperature than in other cuprates if the defect scattering is much stronger in bi2212 .",
    "the present result also indicates that a moderate dy doping can enhance the phonon conductivity rather strongly despite that the atomic substitution always introduces additional impurity / defect scattering on phonons . apparently , the crystal structure is somewhat stabilized by doping an appropriate amount of dy .",
    "a possible scenario is that substituting ca@xmath46 ions with dy@xmath8 increases the oxygen content and results in the expansion of the bio bolck , which is helpful for relaxing the lattice mismatch between the bio block and cuo@xmath2 plane.@xcite note that the low-@xmath11 peak observed in the dy - doped samples clarifies that the  knee \" feature of @xmath37 in superconducting bi2212 single crystals is due to the competition between the decrease of qp heat transport and the increase of phonon heat transport upon lowering temperature across 10 k. furthermore , the phonon heat transport in pure bi2212 is obviously very weak , and its magnitude at 10 k ( where the phonon conductivity peaks ) is smaller than or at most comparable to that in the non - superconducting dy - bi2212 .",

    "after appropriate annealing to increase the oxygen content , for example , the @xmath6 = 0.30 crystal ( dy45 in fig .",
    "2 ) presents a parallel - shift - like enhancement of the thermal conductivity at first glance , as shown in fig .",
    "however , we should note that the thermal conductivity enhancement above @xmath7 is mainly caused by the increase of the electron heat transport ( which can be roughly estimated from the normal - state resistivity data using the wiedemann - franz law ) , while the enhancement of the 10k - peak should be mainly due to the improvement of phonon transport since the qp ( or electron ) heat transport in this temperature region is expected to be strongly damped in highly dy - doped samples .",
    "it is likely that the oxygenating process reduces the number of oxygen vacancies in the crystal , which scatter phonons .",
    "the magnitude of the phonon peak at 10 k increases from 3.8 to 5.2 w / km , but both curves do not show the qp peak although the superconducting temperature increases from 45 to 55 k.      to further investigate the doping dependence of qp heat transport , the thermal conductivities of bi2212 and dy - doped bi2212 single crystals are measured at very low temperatures down to 70 mk .",
    "some of the data have been reported in a previous publication ( see figs . 3 and 4 in ref . ) .",
    "it has been shown that in the lowest-@xmath11 regime where phonons are in the boundary scattering limit , the qp term and the phonon term of thermal conductivity can be separated by fitting data ( below @xmath31 130 mk ) to @xmath52 where the residual term @xmath13 is the qp contribution and @xmath53 is the phonon contribution.@xcite note that the residual thermal conductivity of a @xmath12-wave superconductor was discussed to present a ",

    "however , our bi2212 crystals clearly show much larger residual thermal conductivity compared to the samples used in earlier works.@xcite judging from the methods of growing single crystals and the normal - state resistivity data,@xcite it is obvious that the difference in @xmath13 is strongly related to the cleanliness of the crystals , which actually challenges the validity of the  universal \" behavior .",

    "nonetheless , the residual thermal conductivity universally shows a monotonous doping dependence in all cuprates .",
    "recently , a controversy arose for the data analysis of the very - low-@xmath11 thermal conductivity of high-@xmath7 cuprates ; namely , whether the commonly observed @xmath11-dependence of @xmath29 data below 1 k weaker than @xmath30 is due to the specular reflection of phonons off the sample surface or simply because the phonon boundary scattering can only be achieved at temperatures lower than @xmath31 130 mk.@xcite in this regard , although taillefer s group was the first to propose the analysis of eq .",

    "2 ) , it is reasonable to conclude that the @xmath30 dependence of the low-@xmath11 thermal conductivity ( above @xmath31 100 mk ) of bi2212 is related to an amorphous - like phonon transport @xcite together with a @xmath30-dependent qp heat conductivity .",

    "the phonon scattering off these spins is most effective in suppressing the heat transport when the energy splitting is equal to @xmath31 3.8 @xmath66 , where the spectrum of phonon heat conductivity peaks;@xcite therefore , the spin - phonon scattering usually generates a dip - like feature in @xmath9 at this energy and the dip position shifts to higher fields with increasing temperature.@xcite as we have mentioned , the effect of the magnetic phonon scattering on the heat transport has been known for a long time and has recently been found to affect the field - dependence of @xmath1 in cuprates.@xcite while the magnetic scattering on phonons seems unimportant in pure bi2212 single crystals , in which the phonon heat transport is strongly damped by defects and lattice disorders , it becomes much more pronounced upon doping dy that not only brings free spins but also enhances the phonon heat transport .    as shown in fig .",
    "7(d ) , a step - like @xmath9 isotherms is observed at low temperatures in the @xmath6 = 0.51 sample .",
    "is this also due to the phonon scattering by free spins ? in this scenario ,",
    "if the energy splitting is larger than 3.8 @xmath66 , the magnetic field further increases the energy splitting and simply weakens the scattering and produces a step - like _ increase _ of thermal conductivity.@xcite apparently , the step - like _ decrease _ of @xmath9 in dy - bi2212 is out of the expectation from the common spin - phonon scattering mechanism and suggests some other physical mechanism . since the @xmath6 = 0.51 sample is non - superconducting with an insulating resistivity behavior at low temperatures , the step - like @xmath9 must also be irrelevant to the electron transport .",
    "thermal conductivity of the dy - bi2212 ( @xmath6 = 0.53 ) single crystal down to 0.36 k. the magnetic field is applied along the @xmath20 axis.,width=321 ]    in fig .",
    "7(d ) , the @xmath9 isotherm of @xmath6 = 0.51 sample at 5 k shows a step - like decrease at low field and @xmath1 becomes nearly independent of magnetic field above 2 t , a  plateau \"- like behavior .",
    "we note that it is not clear whether this  plateau \" behavior is the same as that observed in pure bi2212 along the @xmath33 axis,@xcite because the latter is believed to have its origin in the qp transport , while in the present case the sample is an insulator . to investigate this intriguing behavior in dy - doped bi2212 ,",
    "the magnetic - field dependence of @xmath1 are studied in more detail at very low temperature down to 0.36 k and in high magnetic field up to 16 t ( along the @xmath20 axis ) . as shown in fig .",
    "10 , the  plateau \"- like behavior is well reproduced in another sample of @xmath6 = 0.53 at low temperatures . with lowering temperature",
    ", the step - like suppression of @xmath1 becomes more significant and the strongest ( @xmath31 16% ) suppression is observed between 0.97 and 0.5 k. at even lower temperature of 0.36 k , the field - induced suppression of @xmath1 is getting weaker .",
    "the characteristic field , where the suppression completes or the  plateau \" starts , is weakly dependent on the temperature , increases slightly from @xmath31 1 t at 0.36 k to @xmath31 2 t at 5 k. somewhat intriguingly , this trend is the same as that found for the plateau in the superconducting bi2212 samples.@xcite     = 0.53.,width=321 ]    figure 11 shows the temperature and field dependences of magnetization for an @xmath6 = 0.53 sample .",
    "it is clear that the magnetization data show rather conventional spin polarization of paramagnetic spins , which must be spins of dy@xmath8 ions .",
    "the characteristic field for spin polarization is about 2 t at 2 k and increases quickly with increasing temperature ; this is rather different from the characteristic field of @xmath9 where the  plateau \" appears . in this sense",
    ", the @xmath9 behavior does not appear to have direct relation with the dy@xmath8 free spins and their polarization , which is different from the case of the @xmath6 = 0.30 sample .",
    "it is known that in rare - earth- or y - doped bi2212,@xcite the antiferromagnetic ( af ) order of cu spins starts to be established when the superconductivity is completely suppressed and charge carriers are localized upon increasing the concentration of rare - earth ions . therefore , one possible picture of the plateau behavior would be the magnon heat transport being affected by applied magnetic field : in a long - range - ordered spin system , the low - energy magnon excitations can act as heat carriers , but when the magnetic field drives the magnon states to sufficiently high energies , these magnons are no longer thermally excited and drop from heat conduction.@xcite this causes a plateau - like @xmath9 behavior in magnetic systems , as has been observed in the yttrium iron garnet system.@xcite however , one should keep in mind that the magnons are possibly involved only when the antiferromagnetic state has un - gapped ( or very weakly gapped ) acoustic magnon branches , which needs to be confirmed by neutron measurements .",
    "more importantly , the very abrupt nature of the onset of the plateau observed at very low temperature [ fig .",
    "10(a ) ] , together with the rather weak temperature dependence of the magnetic field from which the plateau starts , seems to be difficult to be understood within this picture .",
    "also , it is even not clear whether the  plateau \" is only observable in non - superconducting dy - doped samples . in other word , although the  plateau \" feature is not present in the low-@xmath11 @xmath9 curves for the @xmath40-axis bi2212 samples in strong fields up to 16 t,@xcite the present data could not clarify whether it is also absent in high magnetic fields for superconducting ( and not af ordered ) dy - bi2212 with lower concentration of @xmath6 .",
    "detailed future study of this plateau phenomenon is clearly called for .    in passing ,",
    "we note that the  plateau \" behavior gradually weakens with increasing temperature , which is possibly due to the disappearance of the antiferromagnetic order .",
    "however , at even higher temperatures , the field dependence becomes again stronger above 18.5 k , as is shown in fig .",
    "the strongest @xmath0-dependence is observed at 30 k , where the magnetic field of 6 t induces @xmath31 3 % suppression of @xmath1 without any signature of saturation .",
    "this magnetic - field dependence of @xmath1 at high temperature is actually difficult to understand because if phonon transport is not affected by magnetic field , the only way to bring the field dependence of @xmath1 is through the electron channel . in this regard",
    ", the magnetoresistance measurements have shown that the in - plane resistivity changes by less than 0.1 % in magnetic field ( @xmath67 ) up to 14 t.@xcite such small change of resistivity can not bring several percent change of thermal conductivity unless the wiedemann - franz law is strongly violated in this case .",
    "both the quasiparticle and phonon heat transport of bi@xmath2sr@xmath2cacu@xmath2o@xmath3 are carefully studied for a broad doping range by using pure bi2212 single crystals with tuned oxygen contents and bi@xmath2sr@xmath2ca@xmath4dy@xmath5cu@xmath2o@xmath3 single crystals with different dy contents .",
    "it is found that the qp transport decreases with lowering doping by either decreasing oxygen content or increasing dy content , whereas the phonon conductivity is enhanced in moderately dy - doped samples where a phonon peak is observed at 10 k , which means that dy@xmath8 ions not only act as impurities or point defects but also stabilize the crystal lattice .",
    "the magnetic - field dependence of @xmath1 in pure bi2212 at temperature above 5 k is mainly due to the qp scattering off vortices .",
    "in contrast , the dy - doped samples ( with @xmath6 = 0.30 ) present an additional  dip \"- like term of @xmath9 at low field , which is discussed to be related to the phonon scattering by free spins of dy@xmath8 ions . in non - superconducting dy - bi2212 samples with @xmath10 0.50 , a  plateau \"- like @xmath9 isotherms with characteristic field at 1  2 t is observed .",
    "we discuss that this  plateau \" is possibly related to the magnon transport .",
