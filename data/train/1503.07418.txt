    "it has been known that if an entropy is not associated with a black holes , then the second law of thermodynamics will get violated @xcite .",
    "this was because the absence of an entropy for a black hole can cause a spontaneous reduction in the entropy of the universe .",
    "this will happen when ever an object with a finite entropy crossed the horizon .",
    "thus , the black holes are taken to be maximum entropy objects , i.e. , black holes have more entropy than any other object of the same volume  @xcite .",
    "this maximum entropy is proportional to the area of the black hole @xcite , and this observation in turn has led to the development of the holographic principle  @xcite .",
    "in fact , almost all the approaches to quantum gravity predict the same relation between the area and the entropy of a black hole .",
    "this relation is given by @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the entropy of the black hole and @xmath2 is the area .",
    "however , this maximum entropy of the black holes is expected to get corrected due to quantum fluctuations , and this is in turn expected to modify the holographic principle @xcite .",
    "these quantum fluctuations become important as the black hole reduces its size by giving off hawking radiation .",
    "so , as the black holes get smaller in size due to the radiation of hawking radiation , quantum fluctuations are expected to correct the standard relation between the area and the entropy of a black hole .",
    "such corrections have been evaluated using several different approaches .",
    "the density of microstates for asymptotically flat black holes have been calculated using the non - perturbative quantum general relativity @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "the density of states has been obtained by counting the conformal blocks of a well defined conformal field theory .",
    "it has thus been demonstrated that the non - perturbative quantum general relativity does reproduce the bekenstein entropy for the large black holes .",
    "however , it is also possible to calculate the leading order corrections to this entropy using the non - perturbative quantum general relativity , and it turns a logarithmic correction .",
    "the cardy formula has been used to argue that such logarithmic corrections should occur in all the black holes whose microscopic degrees of freedom are described by a conformal field theory @xcite .",
    "such logarithmic corrections have also been obtained for three dimensional btz black holes by computing the exact partition function @xcite .",
    "matter fields in backgrounds of a black hole have been used to demonstrated the leading order corrections to the black hole entropy are logarithmic corrections @xcite .",
    "it has also been demonstrated the string theoretical effects can generate logarithmic corrections to the entropy of a black hole @xcite .",
    "in fact , the corrections to the entropy of dilatonic black holes have been explicitly obtained @xcite , and they again turn out to be logarithmic corrections .",
    "rademacher expansion of the partition function also has been used to obtained such corrections to the entropy of a black hole @xcite .",
    "it may be know that recently it has been argued that the corrections to the black hole entropy can come from planckian deformation of space - time , due to the generalized uncertainty @xcite .",
    "it has been demonstrated that such corrections can lead to the existence of black hole remnants , which can have important phenomenological consequences @xcite .",
    "it is expected that quantum fluctuations in the geometry will lead to thermal fluctuations in the thermodynamics of the black holes .",
    "it is possible to calculate the corrections to the entropy of a black hole by considering the thermal fluctuations around equilibrium @xcite .",
    "the corresponding canonical ensemble is stable , as the stability condition is equivalent to having a positive specific heat .",
    "it is possible to construct various asymptotically ads charged black hole solutions  @xcite .",
    "in fact , it is possible to define a thermodynamic equilibrium , and thus obtain many related results for such black holes @xcite .",
    "so , it is interesting to analyze the effect of thermal fluctuations for various thermodynamic quantities for such black holes .",
    "in fact , this can be further used for analysing phase transition in such systems .",
    "the phase transitions has also been studied in large ads black hole @xcite .",
    "in fact , there is a close analogy between the charged ads black holes and van der waals fluids @xcite .",
    "this analogy becomes even more clear in the extended phase space @xcite .",
    "this is because in this case the cosmological constant can be treated as a thermodynamical pressure .",
    "this can be used to write the first law of thermodynamics in terms of the cosmological constant .",
    "finally , it is also possible to define a thermodynamic volume using this first law of thermodynamics . it will be interest to see how this analysis changes when thermal fluctuations are taken into account . in this paper",
    ", we will use the leading order form for the corrections to the entropy of a charged ads black hole to analyze the phase transition of this system .",
    "this will be done by first calculating the corrections to the entropy of a charged black hole explicitly , and then using this to calculate other thermodynamical quantities in the system .",
    "finally , that will be used for analyzing the phase transition of this system .",
    "in this section , we will consider a charged ads black hole .",
    "the action for a four dimensional asymptotically ads spacetime coupled to maxwells equations can be written as @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the ads radius , and @xmath5 .",
    "the field equations for this system can now be written as @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the metric for this a charged ads black hole , can now be written as @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 the black horizon radius can be obtained by taking the real positive root of the following equation , @xmath11    in the path integral formalism , it is possible to calculate the amplitude for a field configuration to propagate to another field configuration .",
    "this can be done using a formalism called the euclidean quantum gravity , where the temporal coordinate is rotated on the complex plane .",
    "thus , the partition function for the charged ads spacetime can be written as @xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the euclidean action for this system .",
    "it may be noted that this can be related to the statistical mechanical partition function @xcite @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the inverse of the temperature .",
    "now , the density of states can be written as @xmath16 where @xmath17 usually this entropy is measured around the equilibrium temperature @xmath18 , and all thermal fluctuations are neglected . the expression for entropy , when all the thermal fluctuations are neglected is given by @xmath19 similarly , the temperature of the charged ads black hole can be written as @xmath20 it is also possible define a thermodynamic volume , in absence of thermal fluctuations as @xcite @xmath21    however , it is possible to take these thermal fluctuations into account , and expand @xmath22 around the equilibrium temperature @xmath18 @xcite , @xmath23 where we have neglected higher order corrections to the entropy .",
    "now we can write the density of states as @xmath24 after changing the variables , this expression can be written as @xmath25^{1/2}.\\ ] ] thus , we can write @xmath26^{1/2}.\\ ] ] it may be noted that this second derivative of entropy is actually a fluctuation squared of the energy .",
    "it is possible to simplify this expression by using the fact that the microscopic degrees of freedom of a black hole can be calculated from a conformal field theory @xcite .",
    "thus , the entropy can be assumed to have the form , @xmath27 , where @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "this has an extremum at the value @xmath29 , and so expanding @xmath1 around this extremum , we can demonstrate that @xcite @xmath30 thus , we will use the corrected form for the entropy , neglecting higher order corrections can be written as @xmath31 where we have used @xmath32 .",
    "it may be noted that the quantum fluctuations in the geometry of a black hole give rise to thermal fluctuations in the thermodynamics of a black hole .",
    "so , this correction term will only contribute sufficiently when the black hole is small and its temperature is large .",
    "this is because we can neglect the quantum fluctuations to the geometry of a large black hole .",
    "in fact , as the thermal fluctuations only become sigfinicant for objects with large temperature , and the temperature of a black hole increases as its size reduces , we expect this correction term to only contribute when the size of the black hole is sufficiently small . in this section",
    ", we analyzed some basic aspects of thermodynamics of the charged ads black hole . in the next section",
    ", we will explicitly calculate the corrections to these thermodynamic quantities due to thermal fluctuations .",
    "in this section , we will use the form for the corrections to the entropy of a charged ads black hole to obtain explicit expression for various thermodynamic quantities .",
    "then , we will use these explicit values to study phase transition in this system .",
    "thus , we will use the corrected form for the entropy , neglecting higher order corrections @xmath33 where we have added the parameter @xmath34 , to help track corrections coming from the thermal fluctuations .",
    "so , by setting @xmath35 , we will recovers expression for the entropy without any corrections . furthermore ,",
    "if we can set @xmath36 , we obtain the corrections due to thermal fluctuations .",
    "thus , for large black holes whose temperature is very small , we can take the limit @xmath37 , and for small black holes whose temperature sufficiently large , we can take the limit @xmath38 .",
    "we will now analyze the effect of this parameter @xmath34 on the thermodynamical stability of a black hole . now using temperature and entropy given by eqs .",
    "( [ t1 ] ) and ( [ t2 ] ) , we can obtain the following expression , @xmath39+\\alpha\\ln[4\\sqrt{\\pi}l^{2}r_{+}^{2}].\\ ] ] it is clear that the effect of logarithmic correction is reduction of the entropy .",
    "specific heat at constant pressure and constant volume can be obtained as follows , @xmath40 and @xmath41 we will use @xmath42 to investigate phase transition .",
    "ratio of above quantities is denotes by , @xmath43.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is clear that if we have , @xmath44 then @xmath45 , which is smaller than the cases of ideal classic gas ( @xmath46 ) and extreme relativistic gas ( @xmath47 ) . in the case of @xmath37 , the above condition reduced to @xmath48 , which seems illegible .",
    "therefore , existence of logarithmic correction is necessary to have @xmath45 .",
    "we can obtain the following expression for total pressure , @xmath49 it may be noted that this is a decreasing function of @xmath34 .",
    "now we using eqs .",
    "( [ t1 ] ) , ( [ t3 ] ) and ( [ l7 ] ) , we obtain @xmath50 , and it is satisfied at @xmath37 or @xmath51 .",
    "so , for the infinitesimal @xmath52 , we can write , @xmath53 then , we can find enthalpy as follow , @xmath54 which can be considered as black hole mass @xmath55 @xcite .",
    "hence we can use the first law of thermodynamics @xcite , @xmath56 to extract electric potential @xmath57 .",
    "it is easy to find , @xmath58 which is increasing function of @xmath34 out of inner horizon , while it is decreasing function of @xmath34 in the center of black hole .",
    "it means that the effect of corrected terms is increasing the electric potential at the horizon . on the other hand ,",
    "in the center of the black hole , logarithmic corrections decreased value of the electric potential .",
    "+ finally , we can find helmholtz and gibbs energies as follows , @xmath59 and @xmath60 all of these quantities are decreasing function of @xmath34 , which means the logarithmic correction term decreases the energy .",
    "@xmath61 thus , the energy of the system is decreases by thermal fluctuations .",
    "+ now using the specific heat given by the equation ( [ l4 ] ) , we can investigate phase transition of the black hole .",
    "the specific heat can be written in terms of the horizon radius as a parameter , by using eqs .",
    "( [ c4 ] ) , ( [ l9 ] ) and ( [ l4 ] ) @xmath62 where @xmath63 assumed . an important consequence of logarithmic correction is that the black hole is unstable for @xmath35 and stable for @xmath64 . in the fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , we show behavior of the specific heat given by the equation ( [ p1 ] ) , for several values of @xmath34 .",
    "we can see that there are some stable regions @xmath65 corresponding to @xmath64 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath66 is minimum value of the black hole horizon radius where phase transition happen .",
    "for example , at @xmath67 phase transition happen at @xmath68 .",
    "so , the black hole is completely stable for @xmath69 , for instance @xmath70 and @xmath71 gives stable black hole with @xmath72 .",
    "( dashed line ) , @xmath73 ( solid line ) , @xmath74 ( dash dotted line ) , @xmath36 ( red long dashed line ) , @xmath67 ( dotted line ) ]",
    "in this paper , we analyzed the effects of thermal fluctuations on a charged ads black hole .",
    "this was done by analyzing the corrections to thermodynamics of this charged ads black hole due to thermal fluctuations .",
    "it was also demonstrated the the logarithmic term is the leading order correction term to the entropy of this charged ads black hole .",
    "we also calculated other corrections to other important thermodynamic quantities for this black hole .",
    "finally , we used the corrected value of the specific heat to analyze the phase transition in this black hole .",
    "the corrections terms to the entropy may be related to the conformal field theory description of all black solutions @xcite . it may be noted that asymptotically ads space - time have been studied because of their importance in the ads / cft correspondence  @xcite .",
    "according to the ads / cft correspondence , the string theory on ads is dual to a conformal field theory on the boundary of that ads .",
    "it has also been demonstrated using the ads / cft correspondence that the asymptotically ads black hole is dual to a strongly coupled gauge theory at finite temperature @xcite .",
    "it is possible to analyze the strongly correlated condensed matter physics using ads / cft correspondence .",
    "in fact , a holographic model of superconductors has also been constructed from black hole solutions using the ads / cft correspondence  @xcite",
    ". it will be interesting to analyze the cft dual to thermal fluctuations on the ads , and discuss its possible applications for the strongly correlated condensed matter systems .",
