    "v838 her was discovered independently by @xcite on 1991 march 24.78 ut at 5.4 mag and by @xcite at @xmath4 mag on 1991 march 25.67 ut .",
    "alcock s visual discovery around the peak was made in strong twilight , so the peak magnitude was not accurate .",
    "the outburst time can be estimated from the upper limit ( 9 mag ) prediscovery observation by @xcite on jd 2,448,339.9 and sugano s discovery on jd 2,448,340.281 . in the present work",
    "we adopt the outburst time jd  2,448,340.0 as day zero and the maximum magnitude @xmath5 mag .",
    "soon after the optical maximum , the nova entered a very rapid decline phase , followed by a slight oscillatory behavior enduring several days and , later on , by a smooth decline .",
    "infrared ( ir ) fluxes also showed a rapid decline , reaching a local minimum on day 6 , followed by a rapid brightening .",
    "the spectral energy distribution was consistent with free - free emission from day 1.3 to 6.5 , and thereafter with blackbody emission , ascribed to the formation of a hot dust shell @xcite .",
    "indication of ir emission from silicate grains was reported only at a later phase @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggested that silicate emission was due to a light echo by cold silicate grains deposited in a previous nova eruption .",
    "red and blue preoutburst magnitudes were estimated from the palomar sky survey plates as 19 and 17.5 , respectively , by @xcite , and 20.6 and 18.25 by @xcite , but were contaminated by a closeby ( @xmath6 ) star of similar magnitude .",
    "v838 her returned to the preoutburst magnitude @xmath7 on day 403 , and @xmath8 on day 572 @xcite .    in this series of papers ,",
    "we have applied our universal decline law to many novae , including moderately fast novae ( e.g. , v1668 cyg in @xcite [ hereafter referred as paper i ] ) and a slow nova ( gq mus in @xcite [ paper iii ] ) , and have succeeded in reproducing simultaneously optical , infrared , ultraviolet ( uv ) 1455  , and supersoft x - ray light curves .",
    "v838 her is , however , one of the fastest classical novae , so it is interesting to see if the universal decline law also applied to such an extreme object .",
    "the main observational features of v838 her are summarized in tables [ table_observation ] and [ table_v838her_chemical_abundance ] .",
    "section [ sec_uv ] reviews our observational results based on the _ iue _ spectra .",
    "our model light curves are briefly introduced in section [ sec_model ] .",
    "the results of light curve fitting are given in section [ sec_lightcurvefitting ] .",

    "v838 her has been monitored by _ iue _ from day 2 to day 831 , mainly at low resolution . a gallery of uv spectra can be found in @xcite and @xcite .    in the following",
    "we revisit the problem of color excess @xmath13 of v838 her , and describe the long term evolution of uv continuum and of emission lines .",
    "the uv spectra were retrieved from the _ iue _ archive through the ines ( _ iue _ newly extracted spectra ) system , which also provides full details of the observations .",
    "the use of the _ iue _ ines data is particularly important for the determination of reddening correction because of the implementation of upgraded spectral extraction and flux calibration procedures compared to the previously published uv spectra .",
    "as summarized by @xcite , the color excess of v838 her has been determined by several authors using different methods , based on the balmer decrement @xcite , the equivalent width of the na i interstellar lines @xcite , the ratio of the uv flux above and below 2000    @xcite , and the assumed intrinsic color at maximum light @xcite .",
    "the mean value of these determinations , assuming to have the same weight , is @xmath13 = 0.50 @xmath16 0.12 .",
    "such a large error would cause large uncertainties on the distance and hence on the intrinsic parameters of the nova , as derived through a comparison with our models .",
    "this has driven us to revisit the problem of the reddening using an independent method that we consider more reliable than the previous ones , because of relying directly on its best detectable effect , i.e. the strength and shape of the 2175    broad dust absorption band .",
    "the galactic extinction curve @xcite shows a pronounced broad maximum around 2175    due to dust absorption . since it takes the same value @xmath17 at @xmath18 , 1878 , and 2386  , the slope of the straight line passing through the continuum points at these wavelengths is insensitive to @xmath13 in a @xmath19 plot .",
    "this circumstance can be used to get a reliable estimate of @xmath13 as that in which the stellar continuum becomes closely linear in the 15122386    region , and passes through the continuum points at the above wavelengths . from 8 pairs of short and long wavelength _",
    "iue _ spectra taken from day 6 to day 69 ,",
    "i.e. during or close to the nebular phase , we have in this way found @xmath2 , a value that we adopt in the following .",
    "examples of _ iue _ spectra of v838 her corrected with @xmath20 are reported in figure [ uvreddening ] for day 10 , 12 , 15 and 22 .    in principle",
    ", we could have estimated the @xmath13 color excess also from the observed relative intensities of the 1640    balmer line , and the 2734 and 3203    paschen recombination lines , compared with theoretical ratios , as done , for example in the case of gq mus ( paper iii ) .",
    "such lines were however too faint to be measured accurately .      we have measured the mean flux in two narrow bands 20    wide centered at 1455    and 2855  , selected to best represent the uv continuum because little affected by emission lines @xcite .",
    "figure [ uv1455evolution ] shows the time evolution of the @xmath21   ) and @xmath22  ) fluxes and of the uv color index @xmath23  )@xmath24   ) ] .",
    "the measurements were made on well exposed low resolution large aperture spectra .",
    "figure [ uv1455evolution ] reports also , for comparison , the visual light curve obtained from the fine error sensor ( fes ) counts on board _ iue _ , once corrected for the time dependent sensitivity degradation ( see * ? ? ? * for details on the fes calibration ) .",
    "it appears from figure [ uv1455evolution ] that flux maximum is reached later in the uv 1455    band than in the 2885    and visual bands , as a result of the progressive shift of the maximum emissivity towards shorter wavelengths .",
    "the progressive hardening of the uv spectrum stops after day 10 , when the c(1455 - 2885 ) color index stabilizes around a value of zero .",
    "both these features are a common property of the novae studied by @xcite .",
    "figure [ uvlinesevolution ] reports , as a function of time , the observed flux in the most prominent uv emission lines , as measured by us from the available _ iue _ low resolution spectra .",
    "the figure shows that the maximum emission progressively shifts from low to high ionization lines , such that 2800    is the first to reach maximum , followed by 1335  , 1300  , 1909  , 1487  , and 1240   maximum .",
    "the time delay of maximum emission @xmath25 with respect to the visual maximum does in fact increase with increasing the line ionization potential @xmath26 [ ev ] , as better shown in figure [ uvionization ] where @xmath25 , once normalized to the @xmath9 time , is plotted as a function of @xmath26 for the different emission lines . here , @xmath9 is the time in which the visual magnitude drops by 3 magnitudes from the optical peak .",
    "such a behavior is consistent with that observed in a sample of seven co novae , whose mean data from @xcite are overplotted for comparison . in particular , note that the maximum emission in 1909    and 1750   takes place after a time of @xmath27 @xmath28 2 , as in co novae .",
    "this time has been identified in cassatella et al . as the start of the pre - nebular phase .",
    "good quality @xmath29 high resolution spectra of v838 her are available only at two dates : day 2.5 ( lwp 19993 ) and day 15 ( swp41317 ) .",
    "the most prominent feature in the long wavelength spectrum of day 2.5 is the broad p cygni profile of the 2800    doublet ( figure [ uvmg2 ] ) .",
    "a comparison with theoretical p cygni profiles computed with the sei ( soblolev exact integration ) method @xcite indicates that the terminal velocity of the wind is @xmath30 3000 km  s@xmath31 .",
    "the huge emission compared with the absorption component , usual in novae , is due to efficient population of the upper levels of the doublet by electron collisions .",
    "another interesting line profile is that of the 1906.68 - 1908.73    doublet shown in figure [ uvcarbonio ] , which is the strongest emission line observed in the short wavelength spectrum of day 15 . as it appears from the figure , the emission has a very complex profile .",
    "one way to interpret this profile is that the emitting region is very inhomogeneous in terms of density and velocity structure .",
    "this possibility can not be ruled out a priori also in view of the presence of complex emission line profiles , e.g. , in the hydrogen balmer lines ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the other possibility is that the emission is eroded by overlying absorption from an outer shell .",
    "a likely source of overlying absorption is the principal and diffuse absorption components from the uv 34 triplet at radial velocity of @xmath32 km  s@xmath31 and @xmath33 km  s@xmath31 , respectively .",
    "such components have already been confidently identified to affect the emission line in v1974 cyg @xcite .",
    "in this and previous papers , we have presented a unified model for the ir , optical , uv , and supersoft x - ray light curves of several classical novae .",
    "our models are based on the optically thick wind theory of nova outbursts as described in @xcite and in paper i.      after a thermonuclear runaway sets in , the photosphere of the white dwarf ( wd ) envelope expands greatly to a giant size with @xmath34 .",
    "the envelope settles into steady - state around the optical peak .",
    "the following decay phase can be described by a sequence of steady state solutions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "using the same method and numerical techniques as in @xcite , we have followed the evolution of novae by connecting steady state solutions along the decreasing envelope mass sequence .",
    "the equations of motion , radiative diffusion , and conservation of energy , are solved from the bottom of the hydrogen - rich envelope through the photosphere , under the condition that the solution goes through a critical point of a steady - state wind .",
    "the winds are accelerated deep inside the photosphere so that they are called `` optically thick winds . ''",
    "we have used updated opal opacities @xcite .",
    "optically thick winds stop after a large part of the envelope is blown in the wind .",
    "as one of the boundary conditions for our numerical code , we assume that photons are emitted at the photosphere as a blackbody with a photospheric temperature @xmath35 .",
    "the uv 1455    flux is estimated directly from blackbody emission instead of modeling wd atmosphere .",
    "this approximation is reasonably accurate in a very narrow wavelength range around uv 1455    flux ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and paper iii ) near its peak .",
    "infrared and optical fluxes are calculated from free - free emission by using physical values of our wind solutions .",
    "physical properties of these wind solutions are given in our previous papers @xcite .",
    "we neglect helium ash layer which may develop underneath the hydrogen burning zone in mass increasing wds as in rs oph ( see * ? ? ?",
    "we suppose that the wd mass is decreasing in v838 her , because metal enhancement is observed in v838 her ( see table [ table_v838her_chemical_abundance ] ) .",
    "metal enrichment is an indicator of decreasing wd mass ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .      in the optically thick wind model ,",
    "a large part of the envelope is ejected continuously for a relatively long period ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "after maximum expansion of the photosphere , the photospheric radius ( @xmath36 ) gradually decreases keeping the total luminosity ( @xmath37 ) almost constant .",
    "the photospheric temperature ( @xmath35 ) increases with time because @xmath38 .",
    "the maximum emission shifts from optical to supersoft x - ray through uv and extreme ultraviolet .",
    "this causes the optical luminosity to decrease and the uv luminosity to increase with a timescale that depends strongly on the wd mass and weakly on the chemical composition of the envelope ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* paper i ) .",
    "we calculated the optical and ir fluxes of free - free emission outside the photosphere of optically thick winds by @xmath39 ( see paper i for more details ) , where @xmath40 is the flux at the frequency @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the number densities of electrons and ions , respectively , @xmath44 is the emitting volume , @xmath36 is the photospheric radius , @xmath45 is the wind mass loss rate , and @xmath46 is the velocity at the photosphere .",
    "we also assume that @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and use the continuity equation , i.e. , @xmath49 , where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the density and velocity of the wind , respectively .",
    "finally , we assume that @xmath52 outside the photosphere .",
    "this equation has successfully reproduced the optical and infrared light curves of several novae in outburst . in the case of v838 her , the early decay ( until day 6 ) of @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55-bands",
    "are almost parallel to each other as shown later in figure [ light ] , whereas @xmath53 is not shown for clarity ; this is one of the characteristic properties of free - free emission ( see appendix of paper iii ) .",
    "also the spectrum of v838 her is consistent with that of free - free emission as mentioned in section [ introduction ] .",
    "thus , we can safely apply our method to v838 her .",
    "after the optically thick wind stops , the total mass of the ejecta remains constant with time .",
    "the flux from such homologously expanding ejecta is @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the mean density , and @xmath58 is the ejecta mass .",
    "we assume that the ejecta are expanding at a constant velocity , @xmath59 .",
    "so we have @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the time after the outburst .",
    "the proportionality constants in equations ( [ free - free - wind ] ) and ( [ free - free - stop ] ) can not be determined a priori because radiative transfer is not calculated outside the photosphere ; these were determined using the procedure described below .",
    "@xmath62 is also represented by equations ( [ free - free - wind ] ) and ( [ free - free - stop ] ) , but the proportionality constant depends on wavelength since @xmath63 .",
    "if we assume an expanding shell with constant thickness , the flux is proportional to @xmath64 as discussed in v723 cas @xcite . in v1500 cyg and v1974 cyg",
    ", however , we found that the flux decline rate can be well represented by @xmath65 ( see paper i ) .",
    "as we will see later , the decline rate of v838 her is consistent with @xmath65 .    as the proportional constant in equation ( [ free - free - stop ] )",
    "can not be determined theoretically , and there is no representative timescale , this later part of the light curve does not contain any information on the wd mass .",
    "therefore , we do not use this part in our light curve fitting .",
    "the light curves of our optically thick wind model are parameterized by the wd mass ( @xmath66 ) , chemical composition of the envelope ( @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 ) , and the envelope mass ( @xmath71 ) at the time of outburst ( jd 2,448,340.0 ) .",
    "note that the metal abundance , @xmath70 , includes carbon , nitrogen , oxygen , and neon with solar composition ratios and that @xmath68 and @xmath69 denote additional excesses .",
    "table [ table_v838her_chemical_abundance ] summarizes the chemical abundance determinations so far available for v838 her , as first provided by @xcite , superseded by the later re - determinations by @xcite , and extended by @xcite from spectra taken at four epochs ( day 28 , 60 , 79 and 148 ) .",
    "we thus assume the chemical composition of v838 her to be @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 .",
    "we call it the `` standard '' composition set .",
    "we also assumed two other sets of composition for comparison .",
    "the first case is @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath74 , @xmath79 , and @xmath76 , expressing less enrichment of heavy elements such as in v382 vel and qu vul , and the second case is @xmath80 , @xmath73 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and @xmath76 which may be an extreme case of metal enrichment for v838 her but appropriate composition for v1974 cyg and v351 pup , although abundance estimates are very different among different authors ( see table 1 in paper i which lists observational estimates of abundance of nova ejecta ) .",
    "the latter two recent determinations both indicate an excess of helium with respect to hydrogen , i.e. , @xmath83 @xcite and 1.8 @xcite , against the solar value of 0.7/0.28 = 2.58 . in massive wds",
    "about one tenth of hydrogen is consumed by nuclear burning to produce thermal and gravitational energy during the early phase of the outburst @xcite .",
    "supposing that @xmath84 of hydrogen is converted into helium , the hydrogen / helium ratio becomes @xmath85 @xmath86 . if , in addition , a fraction @xmath87 of the envelope mass is dredged up and mixed into the envelope , the above envelope composition is further changed to @xmath88 , and @xmath89 .",
    "this is very consistent with the observational results by @xcite and @xcite in table [ table_v838her_chemical_abundance ] .",
    "we have searched for the model light curves that best fit the observational data among models with wd mass 1.2 , 1.3 , 1.33 , 1.35 , and @xmath90 , for the three sets of chemical abundance quoted above . as shown in previous papers of this series",
    ", we have proven the light curve fitting method to be a powerful tool to obtain the intrinsic nova parameters .",
    "in particular , we have shown that the theoretical light curves of uv 1455    continuum are very sensitive to the wd mass , so that the wd mass can be determined with a good accuracy .",
    "figure [ lightuv3 ] shows the fits to the uv 1455   light curve of v838 her for three different chemical composition and various wd masses .",
    "figure [ lightuv3]a ) shows that @xmath91 model is in a good agreement with the observed data but models of @xmath92 produce too slow declines .",
    "models of 1.2 and 1.3 @xmath93 are omitted because they are too slow to be compatible with the observation .",
    "similar results are obtained if we increase the hydrogen content and decrease the heavy elements slightly to @xmath94 = @xmath95 ) as in figure [ lightuv3]b . on the other hand , if we decrease the hydrogen and increase the heavy elements to @xmath96 , and @xmath82 ( figure [ lightuv3]c ) , which may be an extreme case for v838 her , the @xmath97 model shows a good fitting and less massive wds ( @xmath98 ) are probably excluded .",
    "therefore , from the uv light curve fitting , we see that the wd in v838 her is as massive as @xmath99 .",
    "figure [ light ] reports the model fits to the visual and infrared light curves for the standard composition set .",
    "we have assumed that , at these wavelengths , the light curve is dominated by free - free emission ( i.e. , can be calculated from eq .",
    "[ [ free - free - wind ] ] ) . since its shape",
    "does not depend on wavelength , one can apply the same light curve model to the optical and ir data .",
    "figure [ light ] shows indeed that , if suitably upward - shifted , the optical light curve also fits the infrared fluxes , at least until day 6 , when an ir flux minimum was reached ( indicated as a vertical dashed line in figure [ light ] ) , owing to thermal emission from dust ( see section [ introduction ] and section [ sec_discussion ] ) .",
    "figure [ lightlog ] provides , in logarithmic time , another view of the model fit to the data .",
    "this figure shows that , at very late phases , optical and infrared fluxes decay along with the @xmath100 line as predicted from equation ( [ free - free - stop ] ) .",
    "this circumstance does not bring , however , any information on the wd mass .",
    "as shown in figures [ light ] and [ lightlog ] , among models with the wd mass of 1.33 , 1.35 and 1.37  @xmath101 , the 1.35  @xmath101 wd provides a best fit representation of the uv light curves as well as the optical and infrared light curves .",
    "figures [ lightlog.compositionb ] and [ lightlog.compositionc ] show the model fits for the other two sets of chemical composition . in figure [ lightlog.compositionb ] , we get the best fit models of 1.35  @xmath101 wd from fitting optical , ir and uv fluxes . in figure",
    "[ lightlog.compositionc ] , however , we can not fit both of the uv and optical fluxes simultaneously .",
    "when we fit the optical , the model uv flux rises too earlier , and then we can not obtain a good fit in the uv .",
    "this indicates that the assumed composition , i.e , @xmath102 , and @xmath82 is too metal rich and not appropriate for v838 her .    to summarize",
    "we may conclude that the wd mass is @xmath103 .",
    "the model parameters and the main results are summarized in table [ table_model ] .",

    "@xcite and @xcite claimed that the rise of infrared fluxes starting on jd 2,448,346 ( day 6 ) was accompanied by a sudden drop of the visual magnitude by @xmath125 .",
    "@xcite proposed that the sudden drop of the visual flux was caused by an optically thick clump of matter ejected toward the earth on day 6 ( indicated by the vertical dotted line in figure [ light.iaucconnect ] ) .",
    "afterwards , the optical flux continued to decline but at a substantially lower level than extrapolated from the light curve of previous days , shown by a dash - dotted line in figure [ light.iaucconnect ] ( which mimics the dashed curve in figure 1 of * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the visual magnitudes used by @xcite and by @xcite were taken from iau circulars .",
    "these data were , however , obtained by different observers .",
    "we have tested self - consistency of the different sets by connecting the data obtained by the same observer ( figure [ light.iaucconnect ] ) .",
    "it clearly appears from the figure that there are systematic differences between the data sets from different observers , and also that no observer reported the sudden drop at jd 2,448,346 , in agreement with the smooth decline shown by the homogeneous set of the @xmath126 magnitudes , also given in the same figure .",
    "moreover , the magnitudes corresponding to just before and after the sudden drop are 8.5 mag at mar . 30.46 ut and 9.54 mag at mar .",
    "30.466 ut , respectively , which are obtained by different observers .",
    "if we take the reported observation time as a three - digit number , the magnitude should dropped by 0.006 day = 8.6 minutes .",
    "this is too short to have some significant change in stellar luminosity .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the claimed @xmath44 magnitude drop is an artifact caused by connecting the different data set with systematic difference .    should the 0.9 mag optical drop be real and due to dust absorption from a clump of matter ejected along the line of sight , one would expect to observe a simultaneous strong absorption of the uv flux .",
    "the decrease in the uv flux is estimated to be a factor of @xmath127 .",
    "figure [ light ] shows , however , no indication of such a drastic decrease in the uv flux .      after the local minimum on day 6 ,",
    "the ir fluxes increased to reach a local maximum around day 12 ( in @xmath54 band ) , being ascribed to thermal emission from an optically thin dust shell @xcite . as shown in figure [ light ] , however , there is no clear evidence for a corresponding decrease in the uv fluxes . in this subsection",
    "we make a comparison with nova v1668 cyg in order to understand to what extent dust absorption can cause significant effects on the uv and optical fluxes in the case of v838 her .",
    "v1668 cyg is a well studied moderately fast nova .",
    "it developed an optically thin dust shell giving rise to the infrared second maximum @xmath128 60 days after the optical peak @xcite . in correspondence to the second ir maximum , the uv 1455    flux suddenly dropped by @xmath129 of what expected from a linear decline law @xcite .",
    "the evolution of v1668 cyg ( @xmath9 @xmath128 23 days ) was much slower than that of v838 her , due to its smaller wd mass ( @xmath130 , see paper i ) .",
    "consequently , the ejected mass of v1668 cyg is expected to be much larger than that of v838 her .",
    "namely , since the ejected mass of v1668 cyg is estimated to be @xmath131 @xcite , while we estimate that it was @xmath132 for v838 her from our best fit models ( see table [ table_model ] ) .",
    "one should thus expect that the dust mass of v838 her was roughly ten times smaller .",
    "observationally , @xcite estimated for v1668 cyg the mass of dust ( condensed carbon ) to be @xmath133 and shell mass of hydrogen to be @xmath134 , which is consistent with the above value of total ejecta mass @xmath131 .",
    "also , @xcite estimated the total grain mass of v838 her to be @xmath135 assuming distance of @xmath136 kpc .",
    "as the mass estimate is proportional to @xmath137 , where @xmath138 is the distance to the star , this corresponds to @xmath139 for @xmath140 kpc here adopted ( see section 5.3 below ) .",
    "@xcite estimated the dust mass of v838 her to be @xmath141 at dust shell maximum for @xmath142 kpc , which is proportional to the ir luminosity , therefore , a smaller value @xmath143 is derived for @xmath140 kpc .    in any case",
    ", the dust mass of v838 her appears to be one tenth of dust mass of v1668 cyg , a value that is not expected to affect significantly the uv fluxes even at the time of the second infrared maximum , explaining then the absence of any quick drop in the uv 1455    light curve .",
    "the interstellar extinction and the distance were estimated with various methods ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for summary ) , the values of which are largely scattered as @xmath144 and @xmath145 kpc ( see table [ table_observation ] ) .",
    "one of the typical way to estimate the distance is to use @xmath9 time or using statistical properties such as a given magnitude at a certain stage of light curve .",
    "let us begin with the distance estimate using the maximum magnitude versus rate of decline ( mmrd ) law .",
    "the absolute @xmath44 magnitude at maximum @xmath146 can be estimated from the @xmath9 time through schmidt ",
    "kaler s mmrd relation @xcite : @xmath147 then the distance is obtained from @xmath148 if @xmath13 is known . if we adopt @xmath149 from the optical maximum of @xmath150 @xcite , this equation gives @xmath151 . with the apparent visual magnitude of @xmath150 and @xmath152",
    ", we get @xmath153 kpc .",
    "if @xmath13 is not fixed , we have @xmath154 which is plotted in figure [ avd ] ( labeled `` mmrd1 '' ) .    the schmidt",
    " kaler law ( eq . (",
    "[ schmidt - kaler - law ] ) ) yields a bit larger magnitudes for a faster nova .",
    "@xcite derived the following mmrd relation which is a good representation of fast novae , @xmath155 for @xmath156 @xcite this equation gives @xmath157 . with the apparent visual magnitude of @xmath150 and @xmath152 , we get @xmath158 kpc .",
    "if @xmath13 is not fixed , we have @xmath159 which is plotted in figure [ avd ] ( labeled `` mmrd2 '' ) .",
    "another way to estimate the distance to v838 her comes from comparing the observed light curve of 1455    band with the corresponding model fluxes ( see paper i , paper iii , and * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we show that the calculated flux at @xmath160 = 1455    at a distance of 1  kpc for model 2 is @xmath161 = 6.6 @xmath162  erg  @xmath163  s@xmath31  @xmath31 at the uv peak in figure [ lightuv3]a . the corresponding observed peak flux is @xmath164=1.57 @xmath165  erg  @xmath163  s@xmath31  @xmath31 . from these values",
    "one obtains the following relation between distance and reddening : @xmath166 where @xmath167 , and @xmath168 at @xmath169    @xcite .",
    "this curve is reported in figure [ avd ] , and is labeled `` uv 1455 '' . equation ( [ eq : uvdis ] )",
    "provides a distance of @xmath170  kpc for @xmath171 .",
    "if we take the upper and lower values of the uv peak @xmath172  erg  @xmath163  s@xmath31  @xmath31 , we get the distance of 2.9 kpc and 2.5 kpc , respectively .",
    "this is however , an extreme case , because the fitting becomes much worse in figure [ lightuv3 ] .",
    "therefore , we estimate the distance to be @xmath170  kpc for @xmath173 from uv light curve fitting .",
    "note that the distance hardly changes for all the models in table [ table_model ] .",
    "one may estimate a lower limit for the distance assuming that the flux of free - free emission is larger than the blackbody flux in optical wavelength region . as the optical free - free flux is dominated by photons reprocessed from shorter wavelength photons of blackbody continuum , free - free flux is larger than that of corresponding blackbody emission at the optical wavelength during the early phase of nova outburst @xcite .",
    "our experience of light curve fitting also suggest that this condition is empirically satisfied in several novae ( see * ? ? ? * for v1974 cyg ) .",
    "thus , we assume this condition , which is written as @xmath174 the shadowed region labeled `` bb '' in figure [ avd ] is where equation ( [ bbdistance ] ) is not satisfied .",
    "the border gives the lower limit for the distance to v838 her , which is @xmath175  kpc for the particular value of @xmath176 .",
    "as shown in table [ table_observation ] , the distances in literature are very scattered . the distance obtained from mmrd tends to be larger than ours as shown in figure [ avd ] .",
    "@xcite obtained a distance of @xmath177 kpc and @xmath178 0.6 from the comparison of total uv flux ( lwp / spw ) including both of line and continuum emission with that of nova lmc 1991 showing a similar spectrum development .",
    "this is similar but contrasted to our method in the sense that we use only continuum emission around 1455    and compare it with the theoretical value . their value @xmath177 kpc is larger than ours , but closer than other estimates using the mmrd relation .      in the early phase of the outburst",
    ", the photosphere of the wd envelope extends beyond the size of the binary orbit .",
    "the companion is deeply embedded inside the wd photosphere .",
    "after maximum expansion , the photospheric radius shrinks owing to wind mass loss .",
    "we can estimate the epoch when the companion appears from the photosphere .    from warner s ( 1995 )",
    "empirical formula the mass of the donor star ( companion ) is expressed as : @xmath179 which gives @xmath180 for @xmath181 days ( 7.14 hr ) , in good agreement with the value @xmath182 obtained by @xcite , although they could not well constrain the mass of the primary component ( @xmath183 ) .",
    "the binary separation is obtained from kepler s law to be @xmath184 for @xmath185 .",
    "the effective radius of the roche lobe is @xmath186 for the primary component ( wd ) , and @xmath187 for the secondary .",
    "here we use an empirical formula of @xmath123 and @xmath124 given by @xcite . in our model ,",
    "the companion emerges from the wd envelope when the photospheric radius of the wd shrinks to @xmath188 ( the separation plus @xmath124 ) , @xmath189 ( the separation ) , or @xmath190 ( the separation minus @xmath124 ) .",
    "this occurs on day 7 , 9 and 11 , respectively , in our model 2 .",
    "the emergence time of the companion ( the central time ) is shown in table [ table_model ] and also indicated by a small arrow in figures [ lightlog ] , [ lightlog.compositionb ] and [ lightlog.compositionc ] . as the eclipse is due to the occultation of the wd , or of the central part of the accretion disk by the companion ,",
    "the eclipse must occur after the above three epochs of emergence .",
    "our estimated time of companion emergence is a rough estimate , but it is well before the first eclipse observation ( day 21 ) , so consistent with observation .",
    "the duration of a uv nova outburst , as measured by the full width at half maximum @xmath191 of the 1455    light curve @xcite is tightly correlated with the nova decay time @xmath9 which , in turn , is a primary indicator of the wd mass ( livio 1992 ) .",
    "detailed model calculations by @xcite have confirmed the primary dependence of @xmath191 on @xmath66 and have shown , in addition , that there is secondary , weaker , dependence on chemical composition .",
    "these results imply that the duration of a uv nova outburst can be used as a useful tool to estimate the wd mass in nova systems .    in figure [ uvwidth ]",
    "we compare the theoretical relation of @xmath191 vs. wd mass @xcite with those obtained from the measured values of @xmath191 @xcite and from the wd masses of seven classical novae , including v838 her , estimated from the previous works ( namely from paper i for v1668 cyg and v1974 cyg ; from * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for v351 pup , os and and v693 cra , and from this paper for v838 her ) .",
    "we recall that the masses of these novae were determined by using the light - curve fitting method not only on the uv 1455    light curve , but also on the optical , infrared , and supersoft x - ray light curves .",
    "for gq mus the uv data are very scattered so we plot here the theoretically fitted value in paper iii .",
    "the largest possible error in this mass determination arises from ambiguity of chemical composition because observationally determined values are sometimes very scattered in literature .",
    "if we adopt different chemical composition , we get different @xmath66 even for the same @xmath191 as shown in figure [ uvwidth ] . in the case of v838 her",
    ", however , the difference of mass determination @xmath192 is relatively small , because in very massive wds , @xmath191 quickly decreases and then strongly depends on the wd mass but weakly on the composition .",
    "another possible source of ambiguity in the determination of wd mass may come from effects of dust .",
    "figure [ uvwidthobs.theory ] compares the duration of uv nova outburst @xmath191 , as predicted by our models , with the observed values from cassatella et al .",
    "( 2002 ) for five novae .",
    "the figure shows that there is a reasonable agreement between the two sets of data , except the dust forming novae v1668 cyg and os and . in these two objects ,",
    "dust formation took place shortly after the uv 1455    maximum , so making the measured @xmath191 significantly smaller than expected . in the case of v838 her , in spite of being a dust forming nova ,",
    "the mass of dust was too small to affect the uv light curve , as discussed in section [ sec : dust ] .",
    "note that the mass determination of our light curve analysis is based not only on the uv data fittings , but also on the optical and ir fittings , so the error in uv fitting does not directly reflect to the resultant @xmath66 .",
    "figure [ uvwidth ] indicates that less massive wds ( @xmath193 ) are systematically co - rich , while more massive wds ( @xmath194 ) are neon - rich .",
    "it has been argued that heavy element enrichment of nova ejecta is caused by dredge - up of wd core material so that , for example , c and o enrichment is an indication of a co wd .",
    "an one wd is born in massive stars after ignition of a co core and , therefore , one wds are usually more massive than co wds when they are just born .",
    "our results are consistent with this .",
    "the mass boundary of co wds and one wds are suggested to be 1.0 - 1.1 @xmath101 .",
    "@xcite summarized that a star of initial mass of 5 -10 @xmath101 leaves a co wd of mass @xmath195 and a star of @xmath196 becomes one wd .",
    "@xcite calculated stellar evolution of 9 @xmath101 star which finally becomes an @xmath197 one core surrounded by an co envelope of @xmath198 .",
    "@xcite calculated stellar evolution until co core ignition with fine grid of initial stellar mass and concluded that the mass of co wds born in binaries is less massive than @xmath199 of which initial mass is @xmath200 for @xmath76 .",
    "@xcite obtained co core mass consistent with umeda et al.s value .",
    "these predictions are consistent with our results in figure [ uvwidth ] .",
    "x - ray emission from v838 her has been detected with @xmath201 as early as 5 days after the discovery @xcite , and was found to be consistent with emission from shocked plasma with @xmath202 kev @xcite . according to these authors the shock could originate from within the ejected material itself or by interaction of the ejecta with pre - existing circumstellar matter . in our model 2",
    "the optically thick wind lasts until day @xmath203  days ( see table [ table_model ] for other models ) ; this is consistent with the picture that the wind collides with circumstellar matter to produce the observed x - ray flux .",
    "the presence of an accretion disk has been suggested from the long duration of the eclipse @xcite , and from the depth of eclipse at minimum @xcite .",
    "the absolute magnitude of a disk , seen at an inclination angle @xmath204 , is approximated by @xmath205 where @xmath66 is the wd mass , and @xmath206 is the mass accretion rate ( eq .",
    "( a6 ) in * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite estimated the inclination of the disk to be @xmath207 . assuming @xmath208 and @xmath209",
    ", we get @xmath210 , 4.8 , and 3.1 for the mass accretion rates of @xmath211 , @xmath212 , and @xmath213  yr@xmath31 , respectively .",
    "the corresponding apparent magnitudes , as calculated from equation ( [ modulus ] ) with @xmath152 and @xmath140 kpc are @xmath214 , 18.6 and 16.9 . considering the ambiguity of assumed accretion rates and the inclination angle , these values are consistent with the preoutburst magnitude reported in section [ introduction ] .",
    "the contribution of a companion star to the quiescent luminosity is estimated as follows .",
    "@xcite gives an empirical relation between the absolute magnitude of a roche lobe filling companion and its orbital period as @xmath215 for @xmath216 . for @xmath217 = 7.14",
    "hr @xcite we get @xmath218 and @xmath219 .",
    "thus , the companion star would be fainter than the accretion disk although there are ambiguity in the mass accretion rate and the inclination angle .",
    "this is also consistent with a faint companion suggested from a small upper limit of @xmath220 mag on the depth of the secondary minimum @xcite and from no visible evidence in the spectrum @xcite .",
    "we have applied the universal decline law of classical novae described in  [ subsec_universallaw ] to one of the fastest novae v838 her and derived various parameters .",
    "our main results are summarized as follows :      \\2 .",
    "the @xmath0 wd model reasonably reproduces the light curves of v838 her both in the optical and in the uv 1455    band as well as in the infrared @xmath54 and @xmath55 bands at the early stages , until dust formation takes place .",
    "model 2 in table [ table_model ] is the best fit model .",
    "the authors are grateful to takashi iijima for fruitful discussion , and also to an anonymous referee for useful comments to improve the manuscript .",
    "we also thank the american association of variable star observers ( aavso ) for the visual data of v838 her .",
    "this research has been supported in part by the grant - in - aid for scientific research ( 20540227 ) of the japan society for the promotion of science .",
    "figure [ novacomparison ] demonstrates a `` universality '' of nova light curves , in which five classical novae are shown in the visual ( @xmath44 and @xmath224 ) and uv 1455    band ( except v1500 cyg : no uv 1455    band is available ) .",
    "each peak of the uv 1455    flux is normalized in order to match the peak of v838 her . also , the time - scale of each nova is normalized so that each uv 1455    light curve is overlapped with that of v838 her .",
    "the same normalizing factor of time - scale is applied to both the uv and the optical light curves .",
    "these normalizing factors , obtained by eye fitting , are summarized in the figure caption .",
    "our universal decline law predicts that the light curves , normalized in this way , should merge into one , independent of the wd mass and chemical composition ( see paper i ) .",
    "this match is excellent for the @xmath224 light curve , because this band is little contaminated by strong emission lines @xcite .",
    "as one may appreciate from the figure , there is a good overlap between the light curves of v1668 cyg ( @xmath224-magnitude , connected by solid line ) , v1500 cyg ( @xmath224-magnitude ) , and the initial phase of v1974 cyg ( @xmath44 magnitude ) .",
    "it also appears from the figure that , whenever strong emission lines provide the dominant contribution to the magnitude , the data deviate above the v1668 cyg line . in the case of v838 her the data are scattered compared with the above three objects , therefore , we fit its lowest boundary of the data with the v1668 cyg line .",
    "we can see excess of the visual magnitudes between day 3 and day 6 .",
    "four uv 1455    light curves also show a good agreement with each other , although v1668 cyg shows a drop at 0.37 in the normalized time due to dust formation @xcite .",
