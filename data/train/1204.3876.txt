    "however , in decentralized problems , different systems have access to different information sets and their decisions are based on local measurements .",

    "a quadratic cost is to be minimized under the partially nested information structure .",
    "the goal is to explore the structure of the distributed controllers .",
    "this problem is known to have a linear optimal policy , see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , most existing approaches do not provide explicit optimal controller formulae and , in addition , the order of the controller can be large .",
    "a solution to this problem has been first given in @xcite , where the resulting controller is of high order which makes the implementation difficult .",
    "moreover , some work has been focused on finding numerical algorithms to these problems @xcite , @xcite .",
    "state - space solutions to the two - systems _ state feedback _ @xmath0 version of this problem was given in @xcite .",
    "another instance of the problem with a _ partial output feedback _ structure has been considered in @xcite , in which one system measures his state directly and the other system uses a noisy measurement of his own state .",

    "@xmath9 , we let @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath11 denotes the dirac delta function .",
    "consider a linear system composed of @xmath1 interconnected subsystems @xmath12 where the system matrices are partitioned into blocks as @xmath3,~b=[b_{ij}],~c=[c_{ij}],~i , j=1, ... ,n$ ] , and @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 are the overall state , input , and output vectors .",

    "the interconnection structure can be described as follows .",

    "this structure can be represented by a directed graph of order @xmath1 .",
    "the graph has an arrow from node @xmath22 to @xmath18 if and only if @xmath28 .    here , we assume system dynamics over an acyclic graph . for a directed acyclic graph it is natural to order the nodes so that the adjacency matrix becomes lower - triangular .",
    "thus , we shall consider a lower - triangular @xmath5 matrix for the remainder of this paper .",
    "furthermore , we assume that the matrices @xmath29 and @xmath30 have the same sparsity structure : @xmath31 the interconnection structure for a two - systems chain , and a three - systems graph has been shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] respectively .",
    "assume @xmath32 and @xmath33 are sequences of gaussian vectors with zero mean values and covariances @xmath34 furthermore , the covariance matrices are partitioned into appropriately sized blocks @xmath35 , v=[v_{ij } ] , \\mbox{~for } i , j=1 , \\hdots , n. \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath36 will denote the @xmath22th block column of @xmath37 . we want to minimize the infinite - horizon quadratic cost @xmath38 where @xmath39 the weighting matrices are also partitioned as @xmath40 , r=[r_{i j } ] , s=[s_{ij}],~i , j=1, ... ,n$ ] .",

    "the dynamics of subsystem @xmath22 propagates to subsystem @xmath18 if @xmath43 . clearly ,",
    "if all systems have access to the global measurements , the information structure would be classical , and the optimal linear controller could be obtained from the lqg control theory .",
    "however , we consider the case in which each system @xmath18 has access to its own measurements up to time @xmath44 , i.e. @xmath45",
    ". furthermore , system @xmath18 has access to the information set that system @xmath22 has access to if the decision that system @xmath22 makes affects the information set of system @xmath18 .",
    "this assumption implies that the information pattern is _ partially nested_. this information pattern is not classical and is one of a few non - classical information patterns for which the optimal policy is known to be unique and linear in the associated information set @xcite .",

    "note that since the controllers @xmath59 and @xmath60 do nt have the same information , their estimators of the system will be different .",
    "+ let @xmath61 @xmath62 is given by the kalman filter ( @xcite ) @xmath63 where @xmath64 is obtained from ( [ riccati4 ] ) and ( [ k1 ] ) . introduce @xmath65 by construction , @xmath66 is orthogonal to @xmath67 .",

    "the gain @xmath79 depends on the dynamics of @xmath80 , which in turn depends on @xmath81 in ( [ kalmanz2 ] ) , and can be found once we have the dynamics of @xmath81 .",
    "note that @xmath82 the components in the second equality above are uncorrelated , so @xmath83 and hence , we decompose the cost function into three components as @xmath84 , with @xmath85 @xmath86 and @xmath87 @xmath88 is independent of the controller , and hence , nothing can be done about it . minimizing @xmath89 and @xmath90",
    "is done with respect to independent decision variables , @xmath91 and @xmath92 , repectively .      seeking the optimal policy that minimizes the cost @xmath89 can be cast as the following optimization problem @xmath94 @xmath91 is a function of @xmath95 by construction .",
    "hence , it can be a function of @xmath71 .",
    "this is clearly a centralized state feedback lq problem . under stabilizability conditions ,",
    "the optimal controller is given by @xmath96 , where @xmath97 is obtained from the riccati equation ( [ riccati3 ] ) ( @xcite ) .",
    "note first that @xmath98 depends only on @xmath95 , so @xmath99 .",
    "thus , @xmath100 and @xmath101    now the optimal controller synthesis for the cost @xmath90 becomes : @xmath102 clearly , this problem is also a centralized state feedback control problem since @xmath103 measures @xmath80 .",
    "therefore , under stabilizability conditions , the optimal controller is given by @xmath104 where @xmath105 , and @xmath106 is given by the riccati equation ( [ riccati3 ] ) ( @xcite ) .",
    "first , take the optimal controller ( [ u2 * ] ) and plug it in the expression of the kalman filter error equation ( [ kalmanz2 ] ) : @xmath107 thus , the error dynamics of @xmath80 give rise to the riccati equation ( [ riccati6 ] ) ( @xcite ) , and @xmath79 is the solution obtained from ( [ riccati6 ] ) and ( [ k2 ] ) .",
    "we can see that the controller is decomposed into two parts , @xmath108 where @xmath109 is a state feedback law based on @xmath71 .",
    "@xmath71 is an estimate of the _ centralized _ estimate of the state @xmath110 , based on the output history @xmath95 which is available to both controllers .",
    "the additional information controller 2 has access to , @xmath111 , is used to to minimize the part of the cost ( @xmath90 ) that can not be observed with respect to @xmath95 .",
    "this is given by @xmath112 .",
    "the dependence of the filter ( [ kalmanz2 ] ) on part of the controller , @xmath103 , is essentially what makes the problem different from centralized control , where the estimator becomes independent of the controller .",
    "this is also why we get a coupling between the estimator gain @xmath79 and the controller gain @xmath113 in the riccati equations ( [ riccati6])-([riccati5 ] ) .",
    "we note that the riccati equations ( [ riccati4])-([riccati3 ] ) can be solved independently . the riccati equations ( [ riccati6])-([riccati5 ] )",
    "are coupled and depend on the output from ( [ riccati4])-([riccati3 ] ) . the coupling looks complicated , but using the fact that the equalities in riccati equations can be written as inequalities ( @xcite ) , and by schur complementing , we can obtain a set of linear matrix inequalities that can be efficiently solved .    also , in principle , the solution can be easily extended to the case of @xmath1 interconnected systems by induction .",
    "we simply take the @xmath1th system as the `` second system '' considerd in this paper , and the rest of systems @xmath114 to be the `` first '' system",
    ". then we proceed iteratively by taking system @xmath115 as the `` second '' system and systems @xmath116 as the first , and so on . however , the coupled riccati equations might give rise to a complicated numerical solution .",
