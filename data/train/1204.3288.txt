    "this is not entirely surprising since taking limits in spacetime geometries is quite a subtle issue @xcite . in particular , results depend on the coordinates that are held fixed during the limit .",
    "in order to be able to relate the asymptotic analysis in both cases we have to take into account that in flat space , the analysis is performed at null infinity . for definiteness",
    ", we concentrate on future null infinity @xmath55 .",
    "since gauge fixing is independent of the presence of a cosmological constant , we can choose the three dimensional analog of the bms gauge for both asymptotics .",
    "this can be done by making the following metric ansatz in terms of coordinates @xmath56 , @xmath57 for three arbitrary functions @xmath58 .",
    "for instance , defining the retarded time @xmath59 through @xmath60 , the @xmath3 metric in global coordinates , @xmath61 is of the form with @xmath62 , @xmath63 .",
    "furthermore , the limit @xmath4 can be safely taken and yields minkowski spacetime , as desired .",
    "assuming that @xmath64 , the einstein equations of motion imply in particular that @xmath65 infinitesimal transformations that keep the gauge fixed form invariant are generated by vector fields @xmath66 such that @xmath67 and are explicitly given by @xmath68 where @xmath69 . when requiring in addition that the fall - off conditions be preserved , @xmath70 the additional conditions are @xmath71 and hence @xmath72 where now @xmath73 , and @xmath74 are arbitrary functions of their arguments .",
    "it now follows that , or equivalently , also hold in the bms gauge : the spacetime vectors form a representation of the conformal lie algebra on an asymptotically @xmath3 spacetime defined through ( [ eq : ojo ] ) and when equipped with the modified bracket .    in the gauge assuming furthermore that @xmath64 , the most general solution to the einstein equations @xmath75 is easily worked out .",
    "one finds @xmath76 or equivalently @xmath77 where @xmath78 .",
    "in addition , @xmath79 so that @xmath80 where @xmath25 . note that on - shell , the asymptotic killing vectors become @xmath81    in these coordinates , the btz black hole is again determined by , while computing @xmath82 , with @xmath83 as in and @xmath84 as in and , gives the transformation laws .",
    "the charges are computed along the lines of @xcite at the circle at infinity @xmath59 constant and @xmath85 using as background the @xmath3 space - time in the form @xmath86 in a first stage , this gives @xmath87=\\frac{1}{16 \\pi g } \\int_0^{2\\pi}d\\phi\\ , \\big[f ( \\mathcal{m}+1 ) +    2y \\mathcal{n}\\big ] ,   \\label{eq : qq}\\ ] ] and then , using and , one recovers .",
    "it follows that all relations of the previous section discussed after equation hold in the bms gauge as well .",
    "we now study the flat limit of asymptotically @xmath3 space - times in the bms gauge .",
    "more precisely , we want to take the limit of the cosmological constant going to zero in such a way that asymptotically @xmath3 solutions get mapped to asymptotically flat solutions .",
    "this will be achieved through a suitably modified penrose limit .",
    "the first observation is that asymptotically @xmath3 spacetimes in the bms gauge belong to the robinson - trautman class of metrics @xcite , for which @xmath59 parametrizes null hypersurfaces and @xmath88 is an affine parameter for the associated null geodesic generators .",
    "it is in this setting that penrose has shown that a particular limit of a generic spacetime is given by a plane wave @xcite .",
    "second , in the context of string theory backgrounds , penrose limits were used to connect backgrounds with @xmath89 factors to backgrounds involving flat or plane wave backgrounds @xcite .",

    "in particular , according to the previous section , the most general asymptotically @xmath3 family of solutions of this type is obtained by using @xmath100 with an arbitrary @xmath101 dependence instead of @xmath102 in and .",
    "it then follows from that @xmath103 is a solution to the einstein equations with cosmological radius @xmath104 .",

    "for instance , the penrose limit @xcite of the metrics consists in rescaling the metric as above and simultaneously scaling the coordinates as @xmath107 the transformed metric is @xmath108du^2 - 2dudr+ 2 \\lambda \\mathcal{n}(\\lambda^2u , \\lambda\\phi ) du d\\phi + r^2 d{\\phi}^2.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if @xmath109 and @xmath110 are continuous functions of the coordinates , the ricci - flat limiting metric is simply the null orbifold @xcite",
    "@xmath111    we would like to perform a different flat limit which keeps the number of arbitrary functions appearing in the metric .",

    "the limit can be used , as well , to relate the symmetries of asymptotically @xmath3 and flat spacetimes .",
    "the first step is again that for a general asymptotically @xmath3 metric @xmath97 , the most general asymptotic killing vectors involve the arbitrary functions @xmath125 with an arbitrary dependence on @xmath101 in instead of @xmath126 . under the change of coordinates",
    ", the asymptotic killing vectors then acquire the form @xmath127 consider first the leading order parts of @xmath128 and @xmath129 , @xmath130 when taking into account the scaling of @xmath88 and the previously discussed behaviour of @xmath131 in , it follows again that , apart from the arbitrary @xmath101 dependence in the fourier modes , in the coordinates @xmath56 , @xmath132 is obtained from through the substitution @xmath118 , @xmath133 .    a necessary condition for a well defined limit @xmath134 is then @xmath135 so that @xmath136 with @xmath137 again , the scaling of @xmath88 and the previously discussed limit of @xmath131 in , then implies that @xmath138 where the components @xmath139 are given by with @xmath140 and @xmath141 .",
    "this limit coincides with the direct computation in @xcite of the vectors describing the symmetries of asymptotically flat spacetimes in three dimension .",
    "let us now turn to the charges .",
