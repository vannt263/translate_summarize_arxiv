    "inherent broadcast nature of wireless channel makes wireless transmission susceptible to eavesdropping within the communication range of the source .",
    "traditionally security in wireless networks has mainly been considered at higher layers using cryptographic methods .",
    "however , recent advances in computation technology pose serious threats to such frameworks , motivating researchers to explore alternative security solutions which offer unbreakable and quantifiable secrecy . _ physical layer security _ has emerged as a viable solution .",
    "the fundamental principle behind physical layer security is to exploit the inherent randomness of noise and communication channels to limit the amount of information that can be extracted at ` bit ' level by an unauthorized receiver .",
    "physical layer security builds upon the pioneering results developed by wyner @xcite which established the possibility of achieving information - theoretic security by exploiting the noise of communication channel and for the first time showed that secure communication is possible if the eavesdropper s channel is a _ degraded _ version of the destination channel . later in @xcite ,",
    "wyner s result was extended to gaussian wire - tap channels .",
    "these results are further extended to various models such as multi - antenna systems @xcite , multiuser scenarios @xcite , fading channels @xcite .",
    "an interesting direction of work on secure communication in the presence of eavesdropper(s ) is one in which the source communicates with the destination via relay nodes @xcite . in the existing literature",
    "such work has been considered in one or both of the following two scenarios : ( a ) relay nodes employ relaying schemes , such as decode - and - forward ( df ) , ( b ) the source communicates with the destination over a two - hop relay network .",
    "we argue that computationally complex relaying schemes such as df render end - to - end performance characterization intractable , without providing any performance guarantee in general channel and network scenarios .",
    "therefore , we consider one of the simplest relaying scheme : amplify - and - forward ( af ) that allows us to provide guarantees on the optimal performance over a wide range of channel conditions .",
    "a node performing af - relaying scales and forwards the signals received at its input .",
    "further , with af - relaying the end - to - end performance characterization problem remains tractable for much larger class of networks than those that can be considered with other relaying schemes .",
    "the characterization of the optimal secure af rate is a computationally hard problem for general layered network .",
    "thus , in this paper we introduce an approach based on network simplification to reduce the computational effort of approximating the maximum achievable secure af rate in general layered networks . consider a network scenario where source @xmath4 is connected to a destination @xmath5 via a network of wireless relays in the presence of an eavesdropper .",
    "the eavesdropper can overhear the transmissions of a subset of relay nodes in the network . to characterize the maximum secure af rate one has to optimize it over the scaling factors of all relay nodes .",
    "however , there can be several relay nodes which contribute marginally to the achievable secrecy rate . shutting down those relays saves physical resources without compromising much on the performance . at the same time , computational effort of calculating optimal secure af rate is reduced greatly as now one needs to optimize the secrecy rate over scaling factors of fewer relay nodes . in this paper",
    "we aim to understand what portion of the maximum achievable secrecy rate can be maintained if only a fraction of available relay nodes are used .",
    "previous work on network simplification embraces two major threads : one pertaining to the characterization of the fraction of achievable rate / capacity that can be maintained with a selected subset of available relay nodes and the other pertaining to the design of efficient algorithms for the selection of a subset of the best relay nodes . in the first direction , for the gaussian n - relay diamond network",
    ", @xcite characterizes the fraction of the capacity when @xmath6 out of @xmath1 available relay nodes are used . in @xcite , the work of @xcite were extended to diamond network with multiple antennas at the source and the destination for some scenarios .",
    "authors in @xcite provide upper bounds on multiplicative and additive gaps between optimal af rates with and without network simplification for the gaussian diamond network and a class of symmetric layered networks .",
    "recent work in @xcite , characterizes the guarantees achievable over arbitrary layered gaussian networks , however restricted to the selection of exactly one relay from each layer .",
    "the performance guarantees for the scenario where a subset of two relays per layer is selected from a network with two layers of three relays each is also provided .",
    "the progress in the second direction is made by @xcite and @xcite , where low - complexity heuristic algorithms for the selection of near - optimal relay subnetwork of a given size from a layered gaussian relay network is provided .",
    "previously , in cooperative communication literature also , the notion of relay selection has been used @xcite . however ,",
    "such prior work used relay subnetwork selection in a restricted sense ( selecting the best single relay node among n relays in one layer networks ) .    in the above - mentioned work",
    "the main objective was throughput maximization .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , no work has been done hitherto towards the characterization of the performance of network simplification for wireless relay networks in the presence of an eavesdropper with the objective of secrecy rate maximization which is an even harder problem . as a first step in this direction ,",
    "we provide the optimal secure af rate characterization in the communication scenarios where the source communicates with the destination over @xmath0 layers of relay nodes @xmath7 , in the presence of an eavesdropper which overhears the transmissions of the nodes in the last layer and any number @xmath6 of relay nodes in each layer are used , @xmath8 .",
    "the eavesdropper being a passive entity , a realistic eavesdropper scenario is the one where nothing about the eavesdropper s channel is known , neither its existence , nor its channel state information ( csi ) .",
    "however , the existing work on secrecy rate characterization assumes one of the following : ( 1 ) the transmitter has prefect knowledge of the eavesdropper channel states , ( 2 ) _ compound channel : _ the transmitter knows that the eavesdropper channel can take values from a finite set @xcite , and ( 3 ) _ fading channel : _ the transmitter only knows distribution of the eavesdropper channel @xcite . in this paper , we assume that the csi of the eavesdropper channel is known perfectly for the following two reasons .",
    "first , this provides an upper bound to the achievable af secrecy rate for the scenarios where we have imperfect knowledge of the eavesdropper channel .",
    "for example , the lower ( upper ) bound on the compound channel problem can be computed by solving the perfect csi problem with the worst ( best ) channel gain from the corresponding finite set .",
    "further , this also provides a benchmark to evaluate the performance of achievability schemes in such imperfect knowledge scenarios .",
    "second , this assumption allows us to focus on the nature of the optimal solution and information flow , instead of on complexities arising out of imperfect channel models .",
