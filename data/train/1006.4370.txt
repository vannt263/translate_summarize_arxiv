    "phenomenology of models based on extra spatial dimensions  @xcite is quite popular now .",
    "besides offering a solution to the hierarchy problem of the standard model  @xcite these models allow for the low - energy unification of the gauge couplings  @xcite , provide a rich tev  scale new physics phenomenology , existence of gravity at the tev  scale and may even offer candidate(s ) for the cold dark matter of the universe  @xcite .    in the simplest string theory inspired extension of the standard model ( sm ) based on one extra spatial dimension , originally proposed by randell - sundram ( rs )  @xcite , gravitons are the only propagating particles in the bulk",
    ". such gravitons will therefore have kaluza - klein ( kk ) excitations which will appear in experiments as a widely separated resonances .",
    "this contrasts with the kk spectrum of models with compact extra dimensions such as add  @xcite where there are a very large number of closely spaced graviton modes .",
    "the coupling of these graviton excitations to the sm is through the 4-d reduced planck mass @xmath0 , which may be on the tev scale , rather than the inaccessibly large planck mass at @xmath1 gev .",
    "the couplings to standard model particles are therefore be proportional to @xmath2 , thereby allowing graviton excitations to decay into all the sm particles including a fermion pair or a pair of gauge bosons . at tev scale energies ,",
    "when such graviton excitations are produced , this variety of possible decay modes will give rise to vast phenomenology at the tev  scale ; @xmath3 , with @xmath4 as a warped factor which arise due to the compactification of the extra dimension on a circle with radius @xmath5 .",
    "the factor @xmath6 is due to the fact that sm in located on the circle at @xmath7 and @xmath8 is the curvature parameter .",
    "although lots of variations of the rs model have been proposed over the years  @xcite and their phenomenology  @xcite has been studied in detail , in this paper we will consider the original scenario .",
    "in particular , we assume that the whole the sm is localized on the tev  brane , so that the mass of gravitons is given by @xmath9 , where @xmath10 are the roots of the first - order bessel function . in order to be useful in the resolution of the hierarchy problem and keep gravity weak enough to be treated perturbatively , @xmath11 should lie in the range @xmath12",
    ".    the focus of this paper will be the distinctive triphoton signature at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) produced by the rs model and other models like it .",
    "the importance of such a signature lies in the fact that this signature is experimentally clean and a distinctive signature for models of this type .",
    "we will also discuss graviton mass reconstruction and the angular distribution of the graviton decay which which are important tools for characterizing the physics which produces the triphoton signal .",
    "the paper is organized as follow : in section 2 , we discuss the graviton production in association with a photon and its decays into the sm particles .",
    "section 3 focuses on the numerical analysis of signal and background as well as graviton reconstruction in detail .",
    "finally , in section 4 , we summarize our findings .",
    "triphoton signal in the rs model will arise due to the associated production of a on shell graviton with a photon while the graviton subsiquently decays into an additional photon pair . in this section",
    "we discuss the production process as well as the various other dominant two body decays of the graviton .",
    "the parton - level matrix - element for the production process @xmath13 as calculated in  @xcite is ,    @xmath14    with , + @xmath15 @xmath16 + where , @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",

    "the kinematics of this process implies that @xmath23 .",
    "note that this cross - section is symmetric with respect to the interchange of @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "the lhc production cross - section for this process is presented in figure  [ fig : gprd ] .",
    "we use a wide range of graviton mass well above the tevatron bounds  @xcite for three different sets of center - of - mass energy , @xmath26 as 7 tev , 10 tev , and , 14 tev respectively .",
    "we use cteq6l-1@xcite parton densities at @xmath27 , and the renormalization and factorization scales are set as , @xmath28 .    from the figure  [ fig : gprd ]",
    ", it is quite clear that due to the low cross - section , it is hard to observe such productions with the early lhc data with an integrated luminosity of 100 pb@xmath29 and @xmath30 tev .",
    "for instance only 2 events would be produced if @xmath31 tev ; at the higher energy @xmath32 tev , the number of events is roughly doubled .",
    "tev  has been assumed in this chart.,width=336,height=288 ]    in figure  [ fig : gdec ] , we present the branching fractions of graviton to various two - body sm mode .",
    "the dominant mode is the dijet channel with a branching ratio @xmath33 ( where , @xmath34 ) .",
    "the fraction for the diphoton mode is smaller , @xmath35 , but it is important as this will lead to a clean signature at the lhc .",
    "the production of a graviton associated with a photon occurs in the high x - region , so generally the associated photon as well as the photons produced in the graviton decay will carry high transverse momentum .",
    "large transverse momentum cuts on the triphoton signal will therefore be helpful in selecting graviton events and rejecting sm backgrounds where photons tend to have low transverse momentum .",
    "we use madgraph  @xcite to produce signal events with a photon and a graviton . later , these events are interfaced to pythia  @xcite for the analysis purpose",
    ". decay of gravtiton is done using the decay table in pythia .",
    "braching fractions for different decay modes for @xmath36 tev are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gdec ] .    before selecting our event samples",
    ", we order the photons on the basis of their transverse momentum i.e. , @xmath37 .    in order to analyze the actual event rate expected to observe at the lhc ,",
    "we first employ the following three basic cuts :    * @xmath38 gev and @xmath39 , * photon - photon separation , @xmath40 ; @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 being psuedo - rapidity of photon @xmath44 and is defined as @xmath45 . *",

    "[ fig : spt1 ]    the sm background is mostly composed of ( a ) the direct triphoton production i.e. where three photons are produced by sm processes , and ( b ) processes involving fake photons , in other words , where the detector incorrectly identifies particles which are not photons as photons .    in order to estimate the sm background we use madgraph with the same parton densities as for the signal case . at 14 tev ,",
    "the total cross - section for the direct triphoton production in the sm is @xmath47 pb . the most likely fake photon backgrounds are those due to the misidentification of jet or an electron as a photon we can thus subdivide the processes in case ( b ) as follows :    \\(i ) @xmath48 , @xmath49 @xmath50 , and ,    \\(ii ) @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "\\(iii ) @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 .",
    "we found that the bare cross - sections for these processes are @xmath57 pb , @xmath58 pb and , @xmath59 pb . with the fake probability for a jet to be identified as a photon , @xmath60 , as given in  @xcite , the contributions due to these channels to the triphoton background will be @xmath61 pb , @xmath62 pb and @xmath47 pb respectively .",
    "cross - sections for the processes involving electrons ( and positrons ) are @xmath63 pb , @xmath64 pb , and , @xmath65 pb . by assuming a fake rate similar to that of a jet the net contribution to the background from these processes will be @xmath66 pb which is mostly due to the process involving one electron or a positron arising due to a @xmath67 production , where @xmath67 decays into an electron or a positron and the corresponding neutrino or anti - neutrino .",
    "contribution due to processes involving one or more jets and electrons ( or positrons ) is @xmath68 pb which is also insignificant even though the bare rates are @xmath69 pb , @xmath70 pb and @xmath71 pb for @xmath72 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 respectively .    the background form fake photons due to jets is the highest with a combined cross - section of @xmath73 pb which is about two times larger than the direct sm triphoton background .      in figures  [ fig : ptg ] ,  [ fig : pts ] and  [ fig : invm ] , we present @xmath74 , @xmath75 and invariant mass @xmath76 distributions with basic cuts for three different values of graviton mass in case of signal , and , the net background due to direct tri - photons and faked backgrounds due to electorns ( or positrons ) and photons as discussed above . from figures  [ fig : ptg ] , it is clear that a demand of @xmath77 gev and @xmath78 gev will ensure that the triphotons are indeed due to the a heavy graviton production .",
    "we employ further cuts on the scalar sum of photons transverse momenta , @xmath75 and invariant mass of harder photons , @xmath76 .",
    "effects of these individual and combined cuts on the signal and background event rates for an lhc luminosity @xmath79 fb@xmath29 is presented in table  [ t : lhc ] .",
    "as it clear from the table  [ t : lhc ] that , though a large fraction of the background is already eliminated at the basic level itself due to the demand that the missing transverse energy per event should not exceed @xmath80 gev limit .",
    "yet a cut on scalar sum of the transverse momenta of all the photons , @xmath75 of about 550 gev or alternatively , @xmath76 of about 800 gev in addition to the basic and photon selection cuts reduces the background significantly .",
    "a combination of all these cuts reduces to background events to 14 while keeping signals events to 293 , 213 and 105 respectively for the graviton mass 1 , 1.5 and 2 tev respectively for an integrated luminosity of 300 fb@xmath29 .    in order to reconstruct the graviton mass we use the following techniques",
    ": we first reconstruct all possible diphoton pairs with the @xmath74 ordered photons .",
    "later we drop those pairs in each event which are nearer to each other , i.e. , those with @xmath81 gev where , @xmath82 is the difference of reconstructed invariant masses .",
    "clearly with this technique we are able to help a graviton mass with an uncertainty within @xmath83 per cent even in the presence of background as shown in figure  [ fig : invm ] .",

    ", we first identify the correct photon pair which yield the right graviton mass peak in a clean signature case .",
    "next , we boost the photon pair into the rest frame of the graviton . in this boosted frame",
    "we produce angular distribution of either of the photons as the two have nearly identical shape .",
    "we plot angular distribution for the first photon in figure  [ fig : angle ] .",
    "we have studied triphoton signals in details . with a detailed study on background arising due to various sm processes including the processes where a photon can be faked by a jet or an electron or positron .",
    "we found that the processes is relatively clean and the background may be greatly reduced ( see the table  [ t : lhc ] ) .",
    "we have also shown that the graviton mass reconstruction and its spin measurement is possible in this signals though we need to wait for 300 fb@xmath29 data in order to have sufficient statistics at the lhc .",
