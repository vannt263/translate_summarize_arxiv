    "the ads / cft correspondence has triggered a revival of interest in the classical anti - de sitter ( ads ) string equations .",
    "such equations have been for long known to be classically integrable on general grounds @xcite . in the last decade however , several concrete explicit solutions have been constructed and mapped into properties of the dual conformal theory @xcite ( for a review and a partial list of references see @xcite ) . the various constructions often make use of ingenious procedures , as for instance the one introduced by pohlmeyer @xcite , to transform the string equations and the constraints into other kind of equations for which integration methods already exist , such as the sine - gordon equation , etc .    in this paper",
    "we present a direct construction of certain doubly elliptic solutions ( i.e. solution which are elliptic functions of both the worldsheet coordinates @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) whose intriguing properties seem to have stayed uncovered to date .",
    "these solutions can be obtained in many different ways . here",
    "we present a construction based on the embedding of the ads space into the projective cone in one dimension more .",
    "we exhibit explicit parameterizations for the two - dimensional anti de sitter , de sitter and lobacevskij strings , while we leave the higher dimensional hyperelliptic cases for future investigation @xcite .",
    "we begin by reformulating the gkp solution @xcite on the projective cone in one spacelike dimension more .",
    "this mapping put into evidence the deep relation that exists between ads strings ( and more generally strings on complex spheres ) and theta functions ( and more generally hyperelliptic functions ) . a particular role",
    "is played by the virasoro constraints that are spelled by a class of ( perhaps unknown ) beautifully simple identities between theta functions and their derivatives .",
    "based on these identities we present several interesting new string solutions . in a related paper",
    "we will discuss the general issue of separating the of variables in the ads classical strings equations with application to nontrivial examples in higher dimension @xcite .",
    "even though very well known , to motivate what follows we start by briefly reviewing the gkp rigidly rotating folded string .",
    "one considers here a two - dimensional parameterized surface embedded in @xmath2 as follows : @xmath3 where @xmath4 the function @xmath5 is required to be periodic : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is an adjustable parameter .    the second step is to derive a differential equation for @xmath8 by imposing the conformal gauge constraints : @xmath9 eq .",
    "( [ constraint ] ) immediately establishes a relation between the angular velocities @xmath10 and @xmath11 and the parameter @xmath7 as follows : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind and @xmath14 gives the localization of the two extremal points of the ( closed ) folded string .",

    "two important conserved quantities are easily computed in terms of the complete elliptic integrals : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the complete elliptic integral of the second kind .",
    "the above equations provide a relation @xmath19 between @xmath20 and @xmath21 ( in parametric form ) which is relevant to compute the anomalous dimension of twist operators in the dual conformal field theory @xcite .    to integrate eq .",

    "this completes our review of the gkp solution .",
    "an immediate generalization of the original gkp rigidly rotating string may be obtained by the following ansatz : @xmath32 two conditions on the three coefficients @xmath33 follow by imposing @xmath34 ( i.e. @xmath35 ) : @xmath36 next , we impose the virasoro constraints @xmath37 and get two more conditions on the angular velocities : @xmath38 finally , the string equations ( [ string ] ) give one more condition ( at variance with the original gkp model where the constraints are enough for the string equation to hold , because of its lower dimensionality ) : @xmath39 which together with eqs .",
    "( [ condisp ] ) and ( [ pp ] ) implies that    @xmath40    it is immediately seen that the choice @xmath41 reproduces the standard gkp solution as given in eq .",
    "( [ gkp2 ] ) . on the other hand , for any value of the elliptic modulus @xmath42",
    "there is a one parameter family of rotating gkp - like strings parameterized by an angular velocity @xmath43 .",
    "now we have three non - zero cartan conserved quantities , the energy and two spins ( we set @xmath44 ) : @xmath45 which are related by a law @xmath46 that in principle can be obtained by eliminating @xmath47 and @xmath42 ; for @xmath48 the function @xmath49 reproduces the energy @xmath50 of the standard gkp string : @xmath51",
    "there is a nice geometrical reinterpretation of the above construction that can be uncovered by recasting the parametrization ( [ embeddingfinal ] ) of the gkp string in terms of theta functions ( we adopt the notations of whittaker and watson s classical book @xcite ) . for the reader",
    "s convenience we recall the basic formulae expressing the jacobi elliptic functions as ratios of theta functions and theta constants : @xmath52 the elliptic moduli @xmath42 and @xmath53 are related to the theta constants as follows : @xmath54 the parametrization ( [ embeddingfinal ] ) of the worldsheet of the gkp string can then be rewritten as follows : @xmath55 where we set @xmath56 and @xmath57 the above parametrization naturally suggests the introduction of homogeneous coordinates on the cone @xmath58 ( here @xmath59 ) ; there we consider the parameterized two - surface @xmath60 the string ( [ embeddingfinal ] ) on the anti de sitter gkp is reobtained by taking the ratios @xmath61 .",
    "note that the condition @xmath62 just expresses a well - known quadratic identity between theta functions ( @xcite , p. 466 ) : @xmath63 the second observation is that the parameterized surface ( [ embeddingcone ] ) obeys virasoro - type constraints on the cone .",
    "the validity of the constraint @xmath64 is immediate .",
    "the nontrivial constraint can be shown by using the heat equation which is satisfied by the theta functions ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "indeed one has that @xmath65 this equality implies that the function @xmath66 is quasi doubly periodic function . by further observing",
    "that @xmath67 one infers that @xmath68 on the other hand @xmath69 and therefore the constraint @xmath70 is satisfied .",
    "the above result is indeed generally true in the following sense : suppose that an ads string is parameterized in terms of inhomogeneous coordinates as follows @xmath71 the map @xmath72 , @xmath73 describes a two - surface in @xmath74 .",
    "the condition @xmath75 immediately implies that @xmath76 where @xmath77 can be either @xmath78 or @xmath79 .",
    "therefore , if the collection of functions @xmath80 satisfies the constraints in @xmath81 , the functions @xmath82 also do in @xmath83 and viceversa .",
    "this also means that the nontrivial identity ( [ thetaidentities ] ) among theta functions and their derivatives is indeed _ proven _ by exhibiting the map ( [ embeddingcone ] ) , once the validity of the virasoro constraints for the corresponding @xmath84 string is known .",
    "we are now ready to construct new examples of ads classical strings . here the idea of rotating strings is abandoned in favor of solutions which are elliptic functions of both the worldsheet coordinates @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "these strings have a completely different shape w.r.t .",
    "the rotating examples and may have interesting features also in view of generalizations to higher dimensions .",
    "let us describe the typical construction in some detail and consider the following symmetric two - surface embedded in the cone @xmath85 : @xmath86 the vector @xmath87 satisfies the condition @xmath88 ( i.e. @xmath89 ) because of a well - known quadratic identity between theta functions of different arguments ( @xcite , p 487 ) : @xmath90 the symmetry @xmath91 will reverberate in a certain self - duality of the corresponding strings ( we will come back to this point below ) .",
    "let us examine the status of the virasoro constraints : @xmath92 the validity of the first constraint amounts to establishing another ( possibly unknown ) identity among theta functions and their derivatives : @xmath93 this identity may be proven by applying the laplace operator to ( [ funda ] ) : @xmath94 in the second step we used once more the heat equation .",
    "the other constraint @xmath95 is an immediate consequence of the separation of variables in ( [ embeddingconeelliptic ] ) .",
    "we can take one step further in understanding eq .",
    "( [ virasoroa ] ) by explicitly computing the quantity @xmath96 by taylor expanding the jacobi addition formulae ( @xcite , p 487 ) @xmath97 we rapidly deduce the following differential identities : @xmath98 by multiplying eq .",

    "let us now project back the surface ( [ embeddingconeelliptic ] ) on the anti de sitter manifold by singling out at first the fourth coordinate @xmath105 .",

    "the configuration of maximal length ( the diagonal ) is the only one that coincides with a spacelike geodesic . at this moment",
    "the endpoints suddenly invert their motion and the string starts recontracting to be finally annihilated at an event which is the mirror image of the event where the string was created w.r.t the plane containing the diagonal spacelike geodesic ( and the geometrical center of the ads manifold ) .",

    "suppose indeed that there are two sheets ; each time that the string hits the lightlike boundary passes to the other sheet and it closes back after a full period .",
    "the other sheet may thought as copies of the same ads universe . in this case",
    "when passing to the second sheet the curve become timelike and then again spacelike and once more timelike before closing . or either , it also is conceivable that the second sheet is a de sitter one . in this case the four arcs are all spacelike and there are four points where the tangent to curve become lightlike . in both cases the following ( folded )",
