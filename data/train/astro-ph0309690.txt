    "the existence of super massive black holes in active galactic nuclei ( agn ) was clearly proved by the detection of a thin keplerian rotating disk in the liner galaxy ngc4258 that was imaged using strong h@xmath3o@xmath4maser emission @xcite .",
    "vlbi observations have shown that these masers are distributed in the thin disk with a radius of 0.13  0.26 pc tracing a region down to @xmath2 40,000 schwarzschild radii , which is the lowest radial distance ever imaged in the central engine of an agn @xcite .",
    "motivated by this discovery , a number of single - dish surveys for new water masers in agn have been carried out ( e.g. , @xcite ) and have yielded a catalogue of about 30 sources in early 2003 ( @xcite ) .",
    "studies of several h@xmath3o@xmath4masers at milliarcsecond resolution using vlbi have shown that the masers do not always lie around an active nucleus @xcite , but that some of them are associated with other agn activities such as jets or nuclear outflows .",
    "h@xmath3o@xmath4masers are found to be important tools for investigating the nuclear kinematics in various types of active galaxies , in particular narrow - line agn .",
    "a number of broad - line agn have been surveyed for masers , however , no water maser emission has yet been detected in broad - line seyfert 1 galaxies . in 2001",
    ", we began a survey program searching for h@xmath3o@xmath4masers in far - infrared ( fir ) luminous galaxies ( @xcite , hereafter paper i ) .",
    "in paper i we reported the first confirmed detection of a maser in the seyfert galaxy ngc6240 .",
    "the aim of this survey was to find new h@xmath3o@xmath4masers in ` radio - excess ' fir luminous galaxies , which were selected on the basis of a large ratio of the correlated flux density at 21-cm ( using the vla at @xmath5  arcsec resolution ) to the fir flux density .",
    "details on the sample selection were described in paper i. the new detection in ngc6240 motivated us to continue the survey of the radio - excess fir galaxies .",
    "+ in this letter , we briefly summarize the results of the ongoing maser survey following paper i , which has culminated in the discovery of a water maser in the type 1 seyfert galaxy ngc4051 .",
    "in addition , we present preliminary results from vla snapshot observations of this maser .",
    "survey observations of h@xmath3o@xmath4emission in the 6@xmath0 - 5@xmath1 transition at 22.23508 ghz have been carried out with the mpifr 100-m radio telescope at effelsberg in march and september 2002 . throughout the survey ,",
    "a k - band hemt receiver with two orthogonal linear polarizations was used with a system temperature of 70120 k depending on atmospheric conditions .",
    "the spectrometer was an 8-channel digital autocorrelator ( ak 90 ) , each channel having a bandwidth of 40 mhz ( @xmath2 540 km s@xmath6 ) and 512 spectral points ( velocity resolution @xmath2 1.1 km s@xmath6 ) .",
    "four channels were employed for each polarization . the centre spectral points of each correlator were offset from the systemic velocity of the galaxies by typically @xmath7 ( 20  30 ) mhz , thereby providing a total bandwidth of 100  130 mhz per polarization .",
    "more details on the observations can be found in paper i.",
    "a total of 24 galaxies from the fir galaxy sample have been observed , including previously observed objects in this survey .",
    "ten newly observed galaxies are listed in table 1 . during the survey",
    ", we discovered a new water maser toward a narrow - line seyfert 1 ( nls1 ) galaxy ngc4051 @xcite on 5 march 2002 .",
    "the detection was confirmed six months later on 14 september .",
    "the parameters of the galaxy are summarized in table 2 , where the systemic velocity of the galaxy ( _ v_@xmath8= 730 @xmath7 5 km s@xmath6 ) is adopted .",
    "the sample of 24 selected galaxies consists of type 1 and 2 seyferts , compact hii nuclei and liners .",
    "the two new detections in ngc6240 and ngc4051 suggest an @xmath2  8% detection rate , which is greater than that of @xmath2  3% in @xcite and that of @xmath2  4% in @xcite , all of which are based on modest number statistics . while the galaxies surveyed in @xcite and @xcite",
    "were selected from a distance - limited agn sample with systemic velocities @xmath9 8000 km s@xmath6 , we constructed a radio - excess fir galaxy sample based on the radio and fir properties of the agn .",
    "the total number of radio - excess fir galaxies is about 30 , of which at present eight galaxies contain water masers .",
    "these results suggest that the presence of the h@xmath3o@xmath4masers in active galaxies correlates well with the combined presence of a considerable fir flux density ( at 60  @xmath10 m and 100  @xmath10 m ) and a radio compact core originating in the dust heated by an active nucleus or a compact hii region @xcite .",
    "+ the detection of an h@xmath3o@xmath4water maser in type 1 seyfert galaxies is still rather unique since most of the extragalactic h@xmath3o@xmath4masers have been found in type 2 seyferts or liners .",
    "since the seyfert galaxy ngc5506 , which contains an h@xmath3o@xmath4maser , has recently been re - classified as a nls1 , ngc4051 is the second detection in this type of galaxy @xcite .",
    "figure 1 shows the spectrum of the maser in ngc4051 observed at two epochs 6 months apart .",
    "the emission is dominated by narrow components with linewidths of @xmath2 1  2 km s@xmath6 .",
    "several components in the range _",
    "v_@xmath8= @xmath2 670  690 km s@xmath11and at _ v_@xmath8= 712 km s@xmath11varied by a factor of two over six months .",
    "the spectrum in figure 1 shows that several doppler - shifted maser components are seen on either side of the systemic velocity .",
    "their centroid velocities are listed in table 3 .",
    "a first interpretation is that the maser components are distributed quasi - symmetrically relative to the 730 km s@xmath11component at the systemic velocity .",
    "the discovery spectrum also displays a high - velocity component at _ v_@xmath8= 936 km s@xmath11(@xmath2 3 @xmath12 level ) , but this component does not have any blue - shifted counterparts .",
    "the maser components are observed from 659 km s@xmath11to the weaker component at 773 km s@xmath6 , which accounts for a velocity extreme of @xmath7 70 km s@xmath11relative to the systemic velocity . while these extrema are not as large as the maximum rotation velocity of @xmath13 1100 km s@xmath11for ngc4258 ( e.g. , @xcite ) ,",
    "such symmetrically or quasi - symmetrically distributed emission has not been observed except in the cases of ngc4258 , ngc1068 and ngc2960 @xcite .",
    "we searched for additional components within @xmath7 1000 km s@xmath11of the systemic velocity , but none were detected at the 3 @xmath12 sensitivity levels of 15  45 mjy , depending on the velocity range ( table 1 ) .",
    "no acceleration of the maser components was detected over the six months interval , yielding an upper limit for the drift rate of @xmath2 2.2 km s@xmath11year@xmath6 .",
    "the total maser luminosity , assuming isotropic radiation of the emission , is @xmath13 2 .",
    "the galaxy has been searched for water masers at least twice , in 1983 @xcite and 1995 @xcite , with a 3 @xmath12 detection level of 130  180 mjy .",
    "these observations were not sensitive enough to be able to detect even the strongest maser component of @xmath14 90 mjy shown in figure 1 .",
    "therefore , it is uncertain whether the detected components represent a flaring state for the galaxy .",
    "however , the galaxy could be a promising object for study of a classical accretion disk around an active nucleus if the maser components are indeed associated with agn activity .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < , < ,",

    "the low - luminosity ( @xmath15 2 ) of the nuclear water maser and the modest doppler shifts of any maser components in the nucleus of ngc4051 can be explained by a lower inclination angle of the disk or disk - like configuration in a heavily obscured circumnuclear medium along our line of sight ( los ) @xcite .",
    "this configuration could significantly decrease the maser gain along the los , which results in a lower maser luminosity , as compared with the extragalactic water masers with l@xmath16 @xmath17 100 associated with a highly inclined disk plane .",
    "peterson et al . ( 2000 ) argued that the balmer lines in ngc4051 might arise in a low - inclination disk - like configuration with an inclination similar to the 40@xmath18 of the galaxy as a whole , which we would preferentially observe on the near side .",
    "they also found that the narrow - line objects could be located at the same position as the agn blr .",
    "this implies that the h@xmath3o@xmath4emitting medium would coincide with the structure that obscures the blr .",
    "the putative lower disk - inclination model is consistent with the observed smaller los velocities ( _ v_@xmath19 = _",
    "v_@xmath20 sin@xmath21 , @xmath21 = disk inclination angle ) of the high - velocity components in a disk .",
    "the lower galactic disk inclination ( 30@xmath18 40@xmath18 ) in ngc4051 would reduce the apparent los velocities by about 40 ",
    "50 per cent as compared to those in a more edge - on disk ( @xmath21 @xmath17 70@xmath18 ) .",
    "the galaxy shows strong and rapid x - ray variations @xcite but there is no direct evidence yet for strong maser variability .",
    "there is no prominent starburst region in the galaxy and the total galaxy mass - to - fir luminosity ratio is 10@xmath22 times less than that of typical galactic starforming regions like w51 @xcite , which makes a relation with active starformation implausible .",
    "we can not still rule out that the maser in ngc4051 is associated with starforming activity on the basis of high - resolution observations with pc - scale resolution .",
    "however , we favor the idea that agn activity gives rise to the h@xmath3o@xmath4maser in the galaxy since ngc4051 contains an agn and the physical environment could prevent a high - luminosity maser .",
    "the h@xmath3o@xmath4maser in the nls1 galaxy ngc5506 shows several narrow ( 1 - 2 km s@xmath6 ) maser lines near the systemic velocity with variable maser flux densities of 0.1 - 0.3 jy @xcite .",
    "the luminosity of such spiky components is on the order of 1 , which is comparable with those in ngc4051 .",
    "the similarity of the ngc4051 maser to those in ngc5506 is also evident in the broad variable components ( line widths of 20 - 80 km s@xmath6 ) near the systemic velocities , which are found in most of the h@xmath3o@xmath4masers associated with agn activity .",
    "the relative weakness of the masers in both galaxies probably results from the environment surrounding these active nuclei , because narrow optical lines and hard x - rays would correlate with intense h@xmath3o@xmath4masers @xcite .",
    "compton reflection components in the form of neutral iron lines in hard x - ray bands have been detected in both ngc5506 and ngc4051 @xcite .",
    "this could support the presence of an optically thick neutral layer shrouding the type 1 seyfert nucleus and the blr .",
    "the detection of an h@xmath3o@xmath4maser in an nls1 would also tell us about unified models of agn because the h@xmath3o@xmath4masers may trace the medium that obscures the blr in type 1 seyfert nuclei .",
    "a complete sample of nls1 objects should be searched for new h@xmath3o@xmath4masers using sensitive telescopes .",
    "this research has made use of the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology , under contract with the national aeronautics and space administration .",
