    "each grain maps to an individual tile in the tiling .",
    "the boundaries of this tile are constructed by graphically summing the contact forces on the grain , moving from contact to contact around the grain in a right hand fashion ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : tiling]b , d ) . a tile s boundary closes because the vector sum of the forces on the grain is zero , i.e.  because the grain is in force balance .",
    "moreover , tiles tessellate space due to newton s third law , which guarantees tiles in contact have facets with like length and orientation . note that lengths in the tiling correspond to forces in the packing , so the tiling occupies a different space than the packing . in particular , the area @xmath25 of the tile corresponding to grain @xmath10 has units of @xmath26 .",
    "modulo a global rotation , the vertex coordinates in a maxwell - cremona diagram are equivalent to the `` void forces '' of satake @xcite or `` loop forces '' of ball and blumenfeld @xcite .",
    "as noted above , the set of grain arrangements compatible with fixed boundary load specifies an ensemble at fixed extensive stress @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "similarly , the boundary of a packing s tiling can be constructed simply by knowing the boundary forces .",
    "if we then rearrange the grains or forces inside the packing to produce a new static packing compatible with the same boundary loading , the the tilings corresponding to the old and new packings will have the same area .",
    "therefore the total area @xmath27 of the maxwell - cremona tilings in an ensemble at fixed extensive stress is _ also _ an additive invariant @xcite .",
    "the invariance of @xmath18 is a direct consequence of local force balance in the packing and has important consequences for the statistics of local stresses .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we considered an ideal gas - like calculation in which the average tiling area @xmath28 , as well as the average extensive pressure @xmath29 , is imposed . maximizing entropy then leads to a local pressure distribution @xmath30 , where @xmath31 depends on contact geometry and @xmath32 , @xmath13 , and @xmath33 are lagrange multipliers .",
    "the distribution is asymptotically gaussian because @xmath34 , the average tile area given @xmath16 , is proportional to @xmath35 . as shown in fig .",

    "the form of the tail of local stress distributions in static granular packings is a subject of ongoing debate , and our goal here is not to insist on one form over another .",
    "rather , we ask what local stress distributions can tell us about applying the maximum entropy postulate to ensembles of packings . here",
    "the force network ensemble is particularly useful , as it serves as a litmus test for theory .",
    "a calculation that is too simplistic to explain results in the force network ensemble _ can not _",
    "explain results in numerical or experimental ensembles , which are more complex than the force network ensemble ; apparent agreement , if any , must be coincidental . therefore ,",
    "ideal gas - like calculations that predict exponential tails can not explain the exponential tails observed in some experimental and numerical measurements @xcite , because the same calculations should apply to the force network ensemble , which does not display exponential tails .",
    "as the tiling area constraint is a necessary consequence of force balance and incorporating the constraint in an ideal gas - like calculation yields predictions consistent with the force network ensemble , it is important to ask how the tiling area should enter , more generally , in a maximum entropy approach . a more detailed calculation than that in ref .",
    "@xcite is likely required to describe systems more complex than the force network ensemble , for example due to a growing correlation length @xcite .",
    "the results of ref .",
    "@xcite , then , suggest two possible scenarios , but do not go far enough to distinguish between them .",
    "these are : ( _ i _ ) the extensive quantities @xmath4 and @xmath18 must be treated on equal footing , i.e.  the boltzmann factor should in fact be @xmath37 .",
    "this possibility was already noted above .",
    "the second is that ( _ ii _ ) the tiling area @xmath18 need not be enforced independently , that is it need not appear in the boltzmann factor . instead , its role is that of proxy for the spatial couplings implied by local force balance and neglected in an ideal gas calculation , and if these are incorporated exactly in an analytical calculation the tiling area @xmath18 need not be considered separately .",
    "the goal of the present work is to distinguish between these two scenarios , which is a prerequisite for any future work that would seek to incorporate spatial correlations in more detail .",
    "the issue hinges fundamentally on the role of local force balance in a static granular ensemble .    by considering two routes",
    "by which a microcanonical ensemble passes to a canonical ensemble , we argue that @xmath4 and @xmath18 are not independent in the thermodynamic limit , i.e.  we argue in favor of the latter of the two scenarios above . as support",
    "we offer the first analysis of the _ canonical _ force network ensemble .",
    "we will show that for small systems it matters a great deal which boltzmann factor is used .",
    "for a thermodynamically large system , however , it suffices to characterize the system by either @xmath4 or @xmath18 , provided one also imposes force balance _ on every grain_. we confirm this through simulations of the force network ensemble , which allows us to access the canonical ensemble directly with monte carlo methods and to impose local force balance exactly .     in the force network ensemble on a frictionless triangular lattice ; adapted from ref .",
    "the numerical distribution is taken from a microcanonical ensemble of @xmath38 grains using umbrella sampling @xcite .",
    "theoretical distributions result from an entropy maximization calculation subject to a constraint on the average extensive pressure @xmath39 and/or average area of a reciprocal tile @xmath28 .",
    "all calculations neglect correlations with neighboring grains , while the numerics impose force balance exactly on every grain . ]",
    "the force network ensemble @xcite is an ideal testbed for statistical mechanics - based approaches to static granular media .",
    "we frame our discussion in the context of the force network ensemble , but our main conclusions regarding ensembles based on @xmath4 and/or @xmath18 apply to any ensemble of static granular packings . for",
    "now it suffices to state that , rather than comprising many different arrangements of the grains , the force network ensemble takes advantage of the fact that disk packings at finite pressure are generically _ hyperstatic _",
    ", i.e.  the forces are underdetermined by the constraints of mechanical equilibrium .",
    "the ensemble then comprises all configurations of forces ( force networks ) on one quenched configuration of grains . in the microcanonical force network ensemble the global stress tensor",
    "is imposed , and all force balanced configurations of noncohesive forces are assigned equal statistical weight . for purposes of illustration",
    "we take the contact network to be a frictionless triangular lattice of grains and discuss at several points the relation to disordered packings .",
    "the force network ensemble is described in greater detail in section [ sec : numerics ] .",
    "as a thought experiment , one passes from a microcanonical to a canonical ensemble by placing a previously microcanonical system in contact with a much larger system that acts as a reservoir of some conserved quantity , e.g.  @xmath4 . for ensembles of static packings ,",
    "this can be achieved by sampling @xmath3-grain clusters of grains from a microcanonical ensemble of packings of @xmath40 grains .",

    "the twist is that , as noted above , a microcanonical system at fixed @xmath4 also has fixed tiling area @xmath18 .",
    "therefore the bath also imposes an average tiling area @xmath45 on the canonical system , where @xmath46 is the average area per tile in the bath .",

    "unlike the previous scenario , which can be understood as clusters sampled from a larger microcanonical ensemble , this scenario corresponds to a thought experiment in which a collection of @xmath3 grains is repeatedly randomly seeded inside a prescribed unit cell and allowed to relax to mechanical equilibrium .",
    "final states that are mechanically stable are placed in the ensemble and weighted according to the boltzmann factor .",

    "the relation between tiling area and stress has immediate consequences .",
    "first , in a canonical ensemble of periodic packings ( fig .  [",
