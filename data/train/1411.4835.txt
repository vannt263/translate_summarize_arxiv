    "the serpentine representation is a remarkable representation of the infinite symmetric group @xmath0 , which has not yet been studied .",

    "the main goal of this paper is to study another example of schur  weyl duality , namely , the * unique * schur  weyl scheme that satisfies the following additional condition : it preserves the so - called stable major index of a young tableau .",
    "_ we show that this particular representation of the infinite symmetric group , which we call the serpentine representation , can be naturally equipped with the structure of the basic representation of the affine lie algebra @xmath1 , with the irreducible @xmath2-modules corresponding to the irreducible virasoro modules .",

    "the construction of @xcite is based on the notion of the fusion product of representations , whose main ingredient is , in turn , a special grading in the space @xmath19 . a key observation underlying the results of this paper , which relies on the computation presented in @xcite of the @xmath20-characters of the multiplicity spaces of irreducible @xmath17-modules with respect to this grading ,",
    "is that the fusion product under consideration can be realized in an @xmath2-module so that this special grading essentially coincides with a well - known combinatorial characteristic of young tableaux called the major index ( see proposition  [ prop : fin ] ) .",
