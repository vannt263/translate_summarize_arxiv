    "the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon , the muon @xmath0 , has been measured very precisely at the brookhaven e821 experiment  @xcite : @xmath3 notably , @xmath4 deviates from standard model ( sm ) predictions beyond @xmath5 level .",
    "the deviation , @xmath6 , is known to be @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the sm prediction . since the size of @xmath9 is comparable to that of the electroweak contribution in the sm  @xcite",
    ", a plausible possibility is that new particles with masses of @xmath10 gev are responsible for @xmath9 : the anomaly of the muon @xmath0 may be a clear evidence that physics beyond sm exists around the weak scale .    in the minimal supersymmetic standard model ( mssm ) ,",
    "the discrepancy of the muon @xmath0 is explained if the smuons , chargino and neutralino are as light as @xmath10 gev with @xmath11  @xcite .",
    "also , supersymmetry ( susy ) provides us with attractive features in addition to the explanation for the muon @xmath0 anomaly : a solution to the hierarchy problem and a framework for the grand unified theory ( gut ) .",
    "therefore , to consider susy models explaining @xmath12 is one of the important directions for physics beyond the sm .",
    "however , there is an obstacle in this direction .",
    "the squarks and gluino have not yet been observed at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , resulting in the lower bound on their mass at 1.4 - 1.8 tev  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the observed higgs boson mass @xmath13 around @xmath14  @xcite can be explained , only if there is a sizably large radiative correction from the heavy stop(s )  @xcite , unless the large trilinear coupling of the stops exists . in fact , including higher order corrections beyond the 3-loop level , it is suggested that the stop is as heavy as 3 - 5 tev  @xcite in the absence of the large trilinear coupling of the stops .",
    "since squarks and sleptons belong to a same representation of @xmath1 gut gauge group and the gaugino masses unify at the high energy scale in a simple setup , it is rather nontrivial to obtain the heavy stop and light sleptons simultaneously . as a consequence , to construct a convincing susy scenario for the muon @xmath0 is a rather difficult task .    recently there has been a resurgence of interest in explaining both the muon @xmath0 anomaly and the observed higgs boson mass within a unified framework .",
    "it has been shown that the discrepancy of the muon @xmath0 and the higgs boson mass around 125 gev can be explained simultaneously by introducing gut breaking effects , and the higgs boson mass around 125 gev are successfully explained without introducing a gut breaking effect on the soft susy breaking masses .",
    "the models shown in refs are based on the  split - family susy \" , where the third generation sfermions are much heavier than the first and second generation sfermions .",
    "also , extensions of the mssm allow us to explain @xmath12 without introducing a gut breaking effect ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) . ] in the gauge mediation  @xcite , gaugino mediation  @xcite , and gravity mediation  @xcite . in most of these cases ,",
    "the violation of the gut relation among gaugino masses is at least required .    in this paper",
    ", we show that the required mass splitting among the strongly and weakly interacting susy particles , i.e. the gut breaking effect on the soft susy breaking masses , is naturally induced from anomaly mediation  @xcite : both the higgs boson mass around 125 gev and @xmath12 can be easily explained in our simple framework , which is consistent with @xmath2 or @xmath1 gut .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : pamsb ] we propose the phenomenological amsb ( pamsb ) model used in our analysis . in section",
    "[ sec : mhgm2 ] we discuss the susy contribution to the muon @xmath0 in our setup and show numerical results",
    ". a more fundamental realization of the pamsb model is shown in section [ sec : pamsbr ] .",
    "finally , section [ sec : conc ] is devoted to the conclusion and discussion .",
    "in susy models , masses of squarks and sleptons are required to be highly split in order to explain the higgs boson mass around 125 gev and the muon @xmath0 anomaly simultaneously . moreover , the bino and wino masses should be ( much ) smaller than the gluino mass at the high energy scale , otherwise the radiative corrections lift up the slepton masses and it becomes difficult to accommodate the experimental result of the muon @xmath0 .",
    "the anomaly mediated susy breaking ( amsb ) contributes to the masses of the colored and non - colored susy particles very differently : the squark and gluino masses obtain large contributions , while the slepton , bino and wino get negative or small contributions .",
    "this feature of amsb is welcome for the higgs mass around 125 gev and the muon @xmath0 .",
    "based on this observation , we propose a phenomenological amsb ( pamsb ) model , which can be easily accommodated into @xmath15 or @xmath1 grand unified theory .    within a supergravity framework",
    ", we construct the pamsb model with the following khler potential : k = -3 m_p^2 , where @xmath16 is a function of hidden sector superfields , and @xmath17 is a chiral superfield in the mssm .",
    "the reduced planck mass is denoted by @xmath18 ( @xmath19gev ) .",
    "the superpotential is also assumed to be separated as @xmath20 , where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are superpotentials for the visible sector and hidden sector superfields , respectively .",
    "( a concrete example of @xmath16 and @xmath22 is shown in appendix [ sec : mirage - like ] . ) here , @xmath23 is an additional source of the sfermion masses , and is defined later . in the case",
    "@xmath24 , the khler potential is so - called sequestered form and the scalar masses vanish at the tree level .",
    "scalar masses ( gaugino masses ) are generated at the two - loop level ( one - loop level ) from anomaly mediation ( see appendix a.1 ) .",
    "the squark and slepton masses are estimated as _",

    "we evaluate the above soft masses at 2 tev for @xmath33 , @xmath34 gev and @xmath35 .",
    "the first term ( second term ) in the bracket comes from the gauge ( yukawa ) interactions .",
    "the corrections from 1st and 2nd generation yukawa couplings are neglected .",
    "using one - loop beta - functions of gauge couplings , the gaugino masses are   and @xmath36 have been flipped by the @xmath37-rotation : @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "the definition of the @xmath40-term is given by @xmath41 m_1(2 tev ) = 1.43 m_0 ,  m_2(2 tev ) = 0.41 m_0 ,  m_3(2 tev ) = -3.12 m_0 , [ eq : amsb_gaugino ] where @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the masses of the bino , wino and gluino , respectively : @xmath45 .",

    "however , the slepton masses @xmath50 and @xmath51 are tachyonic , since it interacts only non - asymptotically free gauge interactions .    the tachyonic sleptons can be avoided if there is an additional source of the scalar masses , contained in @xmath23 : f & = & - + & & - h_u^h_u - h_d^h_d , [ eq : pamsb_setup ] where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are up - type and down - type higgs , respectively . here ,",

    "the above type of @xmath23 with the suppressed @xmath56-term , @xmath57 , arises if @xmath55 couples to the matter fields . note that @xmath59 is obtained with a kklt - type superpotential  @xcite ( see also appendix [ sec : mirage - like ] ) .",
    "the moduli @xmath55 in @xmath23 gives corrections to the soft susy breaking masses of the mssm fields comparable to those from anomaly mediation .",
    "these corrections uplift the tachyonic slepton masses . the setup in eq.([eq : pamsb_setup ] ) is similar to that of the mixed modulus - anomaly mediation scenario  @xcite , but allowing non - universal contributions to the soft masses from the moduli @xmath55 .",
    "moreover , unlike the mixed modulus - anomaly mediation , we can independently chose the soft masses squared and the trilinear coupling of the stops @xmath60 determined by @xmath61 : large contributions to soft masses squared from @xmath55 do not always lead to large @xmath40-terms .",
    "this significantly enlarges the parameter space for explaining the muon @xmath0 anomaly and the higgs boson mass around 125 gev simultaneously , especially in cases that the higgsino mass term @xmath62 is small ( see discussion in sec .",
