    "we can probe the insides of a white dwarf using asteroseismology just like seismologists on earth can learn about the interior of our planet using earthquakes .",
    "a unique model fit to the observed periods of the variable white dwarf can reveal information about the stellar mass , core composition , age , rotation rate , magnetic field strength , and distance ( see the review paper * ? ? ?",
    "this information could prove vital in determining the system dimensions and parameters , and may be the only way to derive conclusive results for non - eclipsing cvs .",
    "pulsating white dwarfs in cvs are also interesting to the variable white dwarf community because they can help establish the effect of accretion on pulsations .",

    "our goal is to establish the pulsationally unstable region(s ) for accreting white dwarfs , which requires a statistically significant number of these systems with well - determined temperatures .",
    "finding the non - variables around an instability strip is equally important in determining its boundaries as discovering variables close to its edges . with this context in mind",
    ", we also report a non - variable sdssj171145.08 + 301320.0  ( hereafter sdss1711 + 3013 ) , discovered as a cv by @xcite .",
    "we observed the system twice and place useful non - variability limits related to the absence of pulsation in the primary white dwarf .",
    "we select those cvs for high - speed photometry whose optical spectra include prominent broad absorption lines from the white dwarf as well as the contaminating narrow emission features from the accretion disk .",
    "the absorption lines indicate that the white dwarf flux dominates the light from the cv .",
    "while this is not a _ sufficient _ criterion for pulsation in the primary white dwarf , these are the only systems where the search is even possible .",
    "when the orbital period of a cv is @xmath180 - 90min , it is near the evolutionary period minimum and the cv exhibits the smallest rate of mass transfer .",
    "@xcite used the optical accretion luminosity to constrain the rate of mass transfer to be greater than @xmath2 , while @xcite and @xcite theoretically compute the rate of mass transfer at the period minimum to be few times @xmath3 .",

    "these theoretical instability strips essentially merge .",
    "@xcite expect that there are thus two distinct instability strips for accreting model white dwarfs with a he abundance between about 0.38 and 0.48 .",
    "optical spectra do not lead to sufficiently reliable temperatures for the white dwarf due to contamination from the accretion disk .",
    "accurate temperature determination requires ultraviolet spectra ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that we do not have .",

    "this suggests that the 260s period is a doublet ; sampling different phases of the beat cycle where one mode may dominate over the other can explain the slightly different period measurements . in the short period zz  ceti  stars ( 200300s ) close to the blue edge of the non - interacting zz  ceti  instability strip",
    ", we often observe multiplet structure in the excited modes due to rotation or magnetic field .",
    "these stars typically show lower amplitudes in the range of 120mma @xcite , which is consistent with the amplitudes observed for the 260s period .",
    "our present constraint on the splitting of the 260s mode is about 20.6@xmath40hz .",
    "if the splitting were caused by rotation , this would imply a spin period of @xmath11.8days , which is too slow for an accreting white dwarf .",
    "it is therefore much more likely that the splitting is caused by a magnetic field @xmath41 g ( see * ? ? ?",
    "we can justify that the mode was not observed on the 1st of december 2005 due to beating of the closely spaced frequencies .",
    "the amplitude modulation from 6.8mma on the 5th of december 2005 to 15.8mma on the 16th of march 2007 lends support to this idea .",
    "although we find no evidence to contradict our idea that the 260s period is a nonradial g - mode , we are unable to eliminate the remote possibility that it could be the spin period of the white dwarf .    we expect to measure the spin period of a rapidly rotating white dwarf in a cv whenever there are features on the surface of the white dwarf , such as a hot spot .",
    "such a hot spot typically arises in accreting white dwarfs with a strong magnetic field , where the accretion flow close to the white dwarf becomes field - aligned .",
    "the accretion stream then funnels to one or both magnetic poles .",
    "the stream undergoes a shock front and radiates x - rays which heat the white dwarf surface near the pole(s ) .",
    "there are two kinds of cvs that show hot spots : intermediate polars with magnetic fields of 110 mg , usually with some outer accretion disk , and polars with fields @xmath715 mg devoid of a disk .",
    "since the optical spectrum of sdss0919 + 0857shows double - peaked lines , typical of an accretion disk , it is not likely to be a polar cv .",
    "the spectrum does not show any signs of zeeman splitting , suggesting that the field is smaller than 1 mg ( see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "also , there is no x - ray source associated with sdss0919 + 0857  ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "these constraints reduce the possibility that sdss0919 + 0857  is an intermediate polar , and the 260s period represents the spin period of the white dwarf caused by a rotating hot spot .",
    "however we are not completely certain because @xcite claim to observe the spin period of 1.12min in the recently discovered accreting pulsating white dwarf hs2331 + 3905 ; its optical spectrum does not show any zeeman splitting and it is not associated with any x - ray source either .",
    "we had initially dismissed the 144s period observed on the 24th of january 2006 as noise due to flickering .",
    "but we find that this period is perhaps revealing the interaction of the orbital period with the 260s period .",
    "let @xmath42 be the frequency associated with the harmonic of the orbital period 41.8min observed on the 24th of january 2006 .",
    "let @xmath43 and @xmath44 be the frequencies associated with the 259.93s and 144.09s periods respectively .",
    "we find that within uncertainties @xmath45 .",
    "this implies that @xmath44 could be a linear combination frequency , however its amplitude is only 2.5 times the average noise amplitude , making it less reliable than a 3@xmath31 detection .",
    "we can not explain why we do not observe @xmath46 , and why the 144s period is only visible during one set of observations , if it is indeed real .",
    "this does not help us resolve the dilemma of whether the 260s period represents the spin period or a pulsation mode , as both these phenomena could potentially interact with the orbital period through tides .",
    "our observations on the 1st of december 2005 do not show the 260s period inspite of a suitably low noise level ( see figure[lcft - cvzb ] ) .",
    "it is possible that the accretion is clumpy at these low rates of mass transfer . if the accretion stopped for some time , the hot spot could cool off , explaining the absence of the 260s period during our first run under this scenario .",
    "we can explain the observed 260s period with two different models : nonradial pulsation and rotation .",
    "we adopt the model of nonradial pulsation here because it is more likely .",
    "we report a non - variable sdss1711 + 3013  ( @xmath30=20.25 ) , which we observed twice during our search , obtaining useful non - variability limits related to the absence of pulsations in the primary white dwarf .",
    "note that even cvs that show variability from flickering , spin or orbital period modulations , would still count as non - variables in this context .",
    "we show the light curves and dfts of sdss1711 + 3013  acquired using the wiyn 3.5 m telescope in figure[lcft - nova ] .",
    "we indicate the periods and amplitudes of the optical variations related to the orbital period in table[per - nova ] .",
    "we show the light curves and corresponding dfts of sdss1711 + 3013  data obtained using the 3.5 m wiyn telescope .",

    "the light curve from the next night distinctly shows both the orbital period and its harmonic at 83.3min & 38.8min respectively .",
    "our weighted average of these three measurements is 78.8@xmath221.4min , using weights that are inversely proportional to the 1@xmath31 uncertainties .",
    "we artificially boost the error bar to 4.5min for consistency with all the measurements .",
    "hence our determination of the orbital period becomes 79@xmath225min .",
    "note that both light curves from figure[lcft - nova ] show a distinctive feature : the orbital modulation consists of a @xmath13035min lower amplitude feature followed by a @xmath150min relatively higher amplitude feature .",
    "sdss1711 + 3013  was not observed to vary ( nov ) , and we designate it as nov@xmath47 , where @xmath47 represents the non - variability limit determined from the dft , similar to the scheme for non - variables within and around the zz  ceti  instability strip ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the highest peak in the dft essentially defines the detection threshold or the non - variability limit , provided it is not related to the orbital period or also present in the dfts of the reference stars . in that case , we apply the same test to the second - highest peak , and so on , until we can determine the highest peak , truly representative of the non - variability limit .",
    "the data acquired using the wiyn 3.5 m telescope on the 29th of may 2006 ( top right panel , figure[lcft - nova ] ) allow us to constrain the pulsation amplitude below 7mma for periods in the range of 831430s .",
    "the data from the 30th of may 2006 ( bottom right panel , figure[lcft - nova ] ) restrict the pulsation amplitude to below 5mma for periods in the range of 771470s .",
    "we conclude that there are no pulsation related periodicities in the range of about 851400s that are higher than the limiting amplitude of 0.5% ; we designate this non - variable as nov5 .",
    "we estimate an effective temperature of 10500k for the accreting primary white dwarf in sdss1711 + 3013  using its optical sdss spectrum ( see table[t - fitparameter ] ) . since most of the known accreting white dwarf pulsators cluster in the temperature range of 1450015000k @xcite ,",
    "we wonder if the non - variable sdss1711 + 3013  is too cool to lie within the instability strip(s ) for variable accretors . @xcite",
    "determine an effective temperature of 10500k for the accreting white dwarf pulsator hs2331 + 3905 .",
    "however given the uncertainty of @xmath12000k in our temperature estimate , sdss1711 + 3013  could easily be substantially cooler than hs2331 + 3905 .",
    "the light curves of sdss0745 + 4538 , sdss0919 + 0857 , and sdss1711 + 3013  show optical variations indicative of the orbital period of these binary systems .",
    "we determine an orbital period of @xmath32min for sdss0745 + 4538 , @xmath48min for sdss0919 + 0857 , and @xmath49min for sdss1711 + 3013  using our data .",
    "we also observe a single independent period in the light curves of sdss0745 + 4538  in the range of 11661290s , which varies from run to run .",
    "the spin of the white dwarf is expected to be highly stable and can not explain the observed variations .",
    "we deduce that the variations in the light curves of sdss0745 + 4538  with long periods , high amplitudes of 4.57% , non - sinusoidal pulse shapes , and substantial amplitude modulation are completely consistent with nonradial g - modes , similar to those observed for the non - interacting long period cool zz  ceti  stars .",
    "we observe a persistent period close to 260s in five out of six of the light curves of sdss0919 + 0857 .",
    "we adopt the explanation that this period is a nonradial pulsation mode with doublet structure and consequent beating , similar to the modes excited in the short period zz  ceti  stars .",
    "the observed amplitudes are also consistent with the small amplitudes observed in the short period zz  ceti  stars , found close to the blue edge of the zz  ceti  instability strip .",
    "but we can not rule out the remote possibility that the 260s period could be the spin period of the white dwarf without additional data that span a long timebase .    even after observing sdss1711 + 3013  twice",
    ", we did not find any pulsation related periodicities in the range of 851400s that are higher than the limiting amplitude of 0.5% ( nov5 ) .",
    "we therefore conclude that sdss1711 + 3013  does not exhibit nonradial pulsations .",
