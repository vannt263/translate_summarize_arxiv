    "two - dimensional surfaces are interesting objects in the sense that the length scales are ranging from microscopic scales to macroscopic ones .",
    "the microscopic string @xcite and the macroscopic biological membranes @xcite can be described and hence unified by a surface model of helfrich and polyakov @xcite .",
    "the models are defined by a curvature hamiltonian , which is given by an extrinsic curvature energy @xcite . the surface shape or its motion",
    "is considered to be governed by the curvature hamiltonian .",
    "one interesting phenomenon is a phase transition of shape transformation , which separates a flat phase at large bending rigidity from a crumpled phase at small bending rigidity @xcite .",
    "numerical studies have been devoted to understand the phase transitions @xcite .",
    "while recent simulations show that the model undergoes a first - order transition @xcite , a continuous transition is also predicted by theoretical studies based on the renormalization group technique @xcite .",
    "thus , the transition still remains to be studied .    in the string model context , a two - dimensional surface @xmath2 and the image @xmath4 of the mapping @xmath1 from @xmath2 to @xmath5 are independently treated .",
    "the length scale of @xmath2 is not always identified to the one in @xmath4 .",
    "this is because the mapping @xmath1 and the metric @xmath3 of @xmath2 are considered as the two different dynamical variables . to the contrary , in the case of numerical studies for real membranes ,",
    "the two - dimensional surface @xmath2 is always fixed and hence is not taken into account to define the model .",
    "this corresponds to the case where the euclidean flat metric @xmath6 is assumed in @xmath2 . in this case",

    "@xmath2 can be identified with @xmath4 . in this case , the length scale of @xmath2 is identified to that of the external space @xmath8 , which is also an euclidean flat space . the surface position @xmath4 is the only dynamical variable in both cases .",
    "thus , little is known about the dependence of the phase structure on the variable @xmath3 in the triangulated surface models .",
    "therefore , it is still interesting to study numerically the surface model described by both of the variables @xmath1 and @xmath3 and to see whether the phase structure of the model depends on @xmath3 or not .",

    "however , the phase structure of surface models has not been so extensively studied at least numerically by assuming the metric as a dynamical variable in the low - dimensional cases @xmath12 .    in this paper",
