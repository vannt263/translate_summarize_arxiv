    "let @xmath0 be a fixed probability distribution on the real line such that @xmath1 and for any @xmath2 let @xmath3 denote the associated hermitian wigner matrix of size @xmath4 .",
    "this means that @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a collection of real random variables with distribution @xmath0 .",
    "the second - order correlation function of the characteristic polynomial of the random matrix @xmath7 is defined by @xmath8 where @xmath9 .",
    "we are interested in the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath10 as @xmath11 , for certain sequences @xmath12 , @xmath13 which will be specified below .",
    "furthermore , the correlation coefficient of the characteristic polynomial of the random matrix @xmath7 is defined by @xmath14    in the special case where @xmath0 is the gaussian distribution with mean  @xmath15 and variance  @xmath16 , the distribution of the random matrix @xmath7 is the so - called gaussian unitary ensemble ( gue ) ( see forrester @xcite or mehta @xcite but note that we work with a different variance ) . in this case",
    ", it is well - known that @xmath17 where @xmath18 and the @xmath19 are the monic orthogonal polynomials with respect to the weight function @xmath20 ( see chapter  4.1 in forrester @xcite ) .",
    "thus , up to scaling , the @xmath19 coincide with the hermite polynomials ( as defined in szeg @xcite ) , and it is possible to derive the asymptotics of the second - order correlation function @xmath21 from the well - known asymptotics of the  hermite polynomials ( see theorem  8.22.9 in szeg @xcite ) .",
    "more precisely , one obtains the following ( well - known ) results ( see  also chapter  4.2 in forrester @xcite ) : for @xmath22 and any @xmath23 , @xmath24 where @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 for @xmath28 and any @xmath23 , @xmath29 where @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 denotes the airy function ( see abramowitz and stegun @xcite ) . by  symmetry ,",
    "a similar result holds for  @xmath33 . the functions in ( [ sine - kernel ] )  and  ( [ airy - kernel ] ) are also called the sine kernel and the airy kernel , respectively .",
    "furthermore , it is well - known that the eigenvalues of a random matrix @xmath7 from the gue are distributed roughly over the interval @xmath34 $ ] . that  is  why the results ( [ bulk - gue ] ) and ( [ edge - gue ] ) are also said to refer to the bulk and the edge of the  spectrum , respectively .",
    "recently , gtze and ksters @xcite have shown that the result ( [ bulk - gue ] ) for the  bulk is ( almost ) `` universal '' in the sense that it holds not only for the gue , but also ( with minor modifications ) for more general hermitian wigner matrices as introduced at the beginning of this section . more precisely , under the assumption ( [ moments - hermitian ] )",
    ", we have @xmath35 for all @xmath22 and all @xmath23 , where @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the same as in ( [ bulk - gue ] ) .",
    "therefore , it seems natural to ask whether the result ( [ edge - gue ] ) for the edge can also be generalized to more general hermitian wigner matrices .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to answer this question in the affirmative .",
    "more precisely , our first result is as follows :    [ theorem - hermitian ] under ( [ moments - hermitian ] ) , we have @xmath39 for all @xmath23 , where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the same as in ( [ edge - gue ] ) .    [ corollary - hermitian ] under ( [ moments - hermitian ] )",
    ", we have @xmath42 for all @xmath23 .",
    "moreover , it turns out that similar results hold for real - symmetric wigner matrices .",
    "let @xmath43 be a fixed probability distribution on the real line such that @xmath44 and for any @xmath2 let @xmath45 denote the associated real - symmetric wigner matrix of size @xmath4 .",
    "this means that @xmath46 where @xmath47 is a collection of real random variables with distribution @xmath43 .",
    "then , similarly as above , the second - order correlation function and the correlation coefficient of the characteristic polynomial of the random matrix @xmath48 are defined by @xmath49 and @xmath50 respectively , where now @xmath51 .",
    "following the approach by gtze and ksters @xcite , ksters @xcite recently showed that under the assumption ( [ moments - symmetric ] ) , we have @xmath52 for all @xmath22 and all @xmath23 , where @xmath37 is the same as in ( [ bulk - gue ] ) , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 thus , we also have universality ( in the same sense as above ) in the bulk of real - symmetric wigner matrices . in the special case where @xmath43 is the gaussian distribution with mean  @xmath15 and variance  @xmath55 ,",
    "the distribution of the random matrix @xmath48 is the so - called gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) ( see forrester @xcite or mehta @xcite but , again , note that we work with a different variance ) . in this case ,",
    "( [ bulk - symmetric ] ) had been obtained previously by brzin and hikami @xcite .",
    "our second result shows that the result ( [ bulk - symmetric ] ) admits an analogue for the edge of the spectrum , too :    [ theorem - symmetric ] under ( [ moments - symmetric ] ) , we have @xmath56 for all @xmath23 , where @xmath57 , and @xmath58    [ corollary - symmetric ] under ( [ moments - symmetric ] ) , we have @xmath59 for all @xmath23 .    in the special case of the goe , ( [ edge - symmetric ] )",
    "can already be found in brzin  and  hikami @xcite .",
    "it seems interesting to note that the functions @xmath60 and @xmath61 arising for the bulk of the spectrum are related by the identity @xmath62 and that the functions @xmath63 and @xmath64 arising for the edge of the spectrum are related by the analogous identity @xmath65 see also brzin and hikami @xcite .",
    "( to check the latter identity , use the fact that the airy function @xmath66 satisfies the differential equation @xmath67 . )    also , observe that in all the cases previously mentioned , the precise choice of the underlying distribution @xmath0 or @xmath43 enters into the asymptotic behaviour of the second - order correlation function of the characteristic polynomial only as a multiplicative factor depending on the fourth cumulant .",
    "thus , the results are essentially `` universal '' .",
    "let us mention some related results from the literature .",
    "it is well - known that at the edge of the spectrum of wigner matrices , we have universality also for the correlation function of the eigenvalues themselves ( see soshnikov @xcite ) . in  contrast to  that , for the bulk of the spectrum of wigner matrices , only partial results are available in this direction ( see johansson @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , in the special  cases of the gue and the goe , several authors have investigated the averages of more general products and even ratios of characteristic polynomials ( see brzin and hikami @xcite , fyodorov and strahov @xcite , baik , deift and strahov @xcite , strahov and fyodorov @xcite , akemann and fyodorov @xcite , vanlessen @xcite , borodin and strahov @xcite ) .",
    "even more , at least in the  hermitian setting , some of these results have been shown to be `` universal '' in that they continue to hold ( with some modifications ) for the class of unitary - invariant ensembles .",
    "for wigner matrices , however , less seems to be known in this  respect .",
    "* acknowledgement : * i would like to thank alexander soshnikov for the suggestion to study the problem at the edge of the spectrum .",
    "to prove theorems [ theorem - hermitian ] and [ theorem - symmetric ] , we will start from the fact that for fixed @xmath23 , the exponential generating functions of the sequences @xmath68 and @xmath69 are given explicitly by @xmath70 ( see lemma  2.3 in gtze and ksters @xcite ) and @xmath71 ( see lemma 2.3 in ksters @xcite ) , respectively .",
    "this fact opens up the possibility to study the asymptotic behaviour of the second - order correlation functions by evaluating appropriate contour integrals of their exponential generating functions .",
    "in fact , this strategy was already used by gtze and ksters @xcite and ksters @xcite to  obtain the above - mentioned results for the bulk of the spectrum . here",
    "we carry out a similar analysis for the edge of the spectrum .",
    "since it does not require any additional efforts , it seems convenient to evaluate the values @xmath72 for arbitrary @xmath73 and @xmath74 , where @xmath75 denotes a contour around the origin . by the  foregoing , the case @xmath76 corresponds to the hermitian case and the case @xmath77 corresponds to the real - symmetric case .",
    "we remark in passing that for a general parameter @xmath73 , it is not hard to see that the exponential generating function under consideration can be interpreted as that of the second - order correlation  function of the characteristic polynomial of a random matrix from ( a rescaled version of ) the tridiagonal beta ensemble introduced by dumitriu and edelman @xcite with @xmath78 . for this  interpretation",
    ", one should set @xmath79 .    for @xmath73 and @xmath23 ,",
    "put @xmath80 in the next section , we will prove the following results :    [ theproposition2 ] for any @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath23 , we have @xmath81    [ theproposition3 ] for any @xmath82 and @xmath23 , we have @xmath83 where @xmath84 denotes the @xmath85-fold application of the given differential operator .",
    "( for @xmath86 , consider the continuous extension of the right - hand side . )",
    "it is straightforward to check that @xmath87 and @xmath88 ( for the second identity , use the fact that the airy function @xmath66 satisfies the differential equation @xmath67 . )",
    "thus , in view of the preceding comments , it is immediate that theorems [ theorem - hermitian ] and [ theorem - symmetric ] , which correspond to the special cases @xmath76 and @xmath77 , follow from propositions [ theproposition2 ] and [ theproposition3 ] .    to prove corollaries [ corollary - hermitian ] and [ corollary - symmetric ] , observe that @xmath89 in the hermitian case and @xmath90 in the real - symmetric case .",
    "moreover , it is not difficult to see that @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the @xmath4th hermite polynomial ( see section  5.5 in szeg @xcite ) .",
    "thus , in both cases , the expectation of the characteristic polynomial is given by the  _ same _  function @xmath93 .",
    "therefore , to deduce corollaries [ corollary - hermitian ] and [ corollary - symmetric ] from theorems [ theorem - hermitian ] and [ theorem - symmetric ] , respectively , it will be sufficient to show that @xmath94 is  asymptotically negligible in comparison to @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "slightly more generally , we will consider the case of an arbitrary parameter @xmath73 and investigate the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath95 for any @xmath23 . in the next section",
    ", we will show that proposition [ theproposition2 ] entails the  following result :    [ theproposition5 ] for any @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath23 such that @xmath96 , @xmath97 , we have @xmath98    furthermore , we will prove the following :    [ theproposition6 ] for any @xmath82 , we have @xmath99 for all @xmath100 .    in view of the preceding comments , it is obvious that corollaries [ corollary - hermitian ] and [ corollary - symmetric ] , which correspond to the special cases @xmath76 and @xmath77 , follow from propositions [ theproposition5 ]  and  [ theproposition6 ] .",
    "we remark in passing that for a general parameter @xmath73 , @xmath101 can be interpreted as the correlation coefficient of the characteristic polynomial of a random matrix from ( the rescaled version of ) the tridiagonal beta ensemble ( with @xmath78 ) , since in this setting , the average of the characteristic polynomial is also given by the hermite polynomial ( see theorem  4.1 in dumitriu and edelman @xcite ) .",
    "fix @xmath23 . we have to evaluate @xmath102 where @xmath103 , @xmath104 , and @xmath75 denotes a contour around the origin ( which will be chosen further below ) .    setting @xmath105 and @xmath106 , ( [ intrep1 ] )",
    "may be written as @xmath107 with @xmath108 in particular , the leading exponential factor in ( [ intrep2 ] ) is asymptotically the same as  that in proposition [ theproposition2 ] .",
    "similarly as in the proof of the main theorem in @xcite , the basic idea is that the  main contribution to the integral in ( [ intrep3 ] ) comes from a  small neighborhood of the point @xmath111 .",
    "let @xmath112 ( where @xmath113 denotes the principal branch of the logarithm ) and @xmath114 then the left - hand side in ( [ intrep3 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath115 put @xmath116 and @xmath117 , where @xmath118 .",
    "we shall prove the following :          thus , for @xmath118 sufficiently large , we have not only the conclusion of claim  2 , but also the inequality @xmath126 hence , in combination with claim  1 , it follows that @xmath127 for all @xmath124 sufficiently large .",
    "since @xmath120 is arbitrary , this proves ( [ intrep3 ] ) .",
    "_ proof of claim 1 : _ first of all , substituting @xmath128 , we have @xmath129 we will determine the asymptotics of @xmath130 as @xmath11 , for .",
    "the @xmath131-bounds occurring in the sequel hold uniformly in this region . to begin with , note that @xmath132 therefore , for @xmath4 sufficiently large , we have the following approximations : @xmath133 @xmath134 @xmath135 @xmath136 @xmath137 @xmath138 putting these approximations together , the terms of highest order cancel out , and we end up with @xmath139 hence , by an application of the dominated convergence theorem , it follows that @xmath140 and claim  1 is proved .",
    "_ proof of claim 2 : _ by symmetry , it suffices to consider the interval @xmath141 .",
    "write the integral as @xmath142 since @xmath143 and @xmath144 are real and @xmath145 , this is clearly bounded by @xmath146 in the following , let @xmath147 denote constants which depend only on @xmath148 ( which are regarded as fixed ) but which may change from occurrence to occurrence",
    ". then we have @xmath149 and @xmath150 ( as follows from a straightforward calculation ) and therefore @xmath151 since @xmath152 it follows that @xmath153 for some constant @xmath154 , say .",

    "this proves claim  2 .",
    "we start from the following well - known integral representation of the airy function : @xmath172 a standard application of cauchy s theorem shows that the contour @xmath168 can be deformed into the contour @xmath173 , @xmath174 .",
    "thus , we obtain @xmath175 observe that the resulting integral exists in the lebesgue sense , since we have @xmath176 for any @xmath174 .",
    "it follows from ( [ ai - int ] ) that @xmath177 substituting @xmath178 and doing a small calculation , we find that @xmath179 using the well - known relation @xmath180 ( where @xmath181 ) , it follows that @xmath182 or @xmath183 by another application of cauchy s theorem , the contour @xmath184 , @xmath185 , may be deformed back into the contour @xmath168 .    replacing the contour @xmath168 in lemma [ airyproduct ] by the contour @xmath173 and  substituting @xmath186",
    ", we have @xmath187 by means of abbreviation , write @xmath188 for the numerator inside the integral . then , for any @xmath73 , we have @xmath189 @xmath190 and therefore @xmath191 the assertion of proposition [ theproposition3 ] now follows by induction .",
    "fix @xmath23 , and put @xmath103 , @xmath104 . using well - known results about the asymptotic properties of the hermite polynomials ( see theorem 8.22.9(c ) in szeg @xcite ) , we find that the function @xmath93 given by @xmath192 ( @xmath193 ) satisfies @xmath194 for any @xmath73 .",
    "setting @xmath195 , we therefore obtain @xmath196 where we have used proposition [ theproposition2 ] as well as the assumptions @xmath96 , @xmath197 .",
    "this  completes the proof of proposition [ theproposition5 ] .",
    "first of all , note that the definition ( [ idefinition ] ) may be extended to the case @xmath198 and that @xmath199 for any @xmath100 by  lemma  [ airyproduct ] .",
