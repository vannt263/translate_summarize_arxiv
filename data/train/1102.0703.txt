    "active galactic nuclei ( agns ) are one of the most important tools in modern cosmology .",
    "they are intrinsically the brightest continuously luminous sources in the universe , which allows their detection to great cosmological distances and their use as probes of the universe over cosmic time .",
    "agns are also believed to play a major role in galaxy evolution ( e.g. , @xcite ) , acting as means for quenching star formation ( e.g. , @xcite ) and `` converting '' blue spirals into red elliptical galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "although there are over a hundred thousand known agns ( e.g. , @xcite ) , it has proved difficult to identify quasars in dense stellar fields such as the large and small magellanic clouds ( lmc and smc ) , the galactic bulge , or other nearby galaxies .",
    "for example , the expected number of quasars brighter than ogle s @xmath4 magnitude limit is @xmath6/deg@xmath1 ( figure  13 in @xcite ) while there are @xmath7/deg@xmath1 stars with @xmath4  mag in the central regions of the smc . as a result",
    ", few quasars are known behind the magellanic clouds ( 57 in the lmc , 28 in the smc  within a 5 degree radius ) , and none have been identified behind the galactic bulge .",
    "most of the known quasars were found by investigating sources with long time scale , non - periodic variability combined with their colors and magnitudes ( e.g. , and recently @xcite ) , and a smaller number were found as the ( variable ) optical counterparts to x - ray sources ( @xcite ) .",
    "quasars behind the magellanic clouds or the galactic bulge have several important scientific applications .",
    "first , they are the best sources for fixing the reference frames needed for proper motion studies .",
    "the recent improvements in the proper motions of the magellanic clouds ( @xcite , @xcite ) all relied on _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) measurements in fields centered on quasars .",
    "the results were surprising , as the clouds were found to be moving significantly faster than previous estimates ( e.g. , @xcite ) and the tangential motion of the smc differs significantly from that of the lmc .",
    "this implies that the clouds may be on their first pericentric passage and unbound from the galaxy ( @xcite ) , and that they may not be bound to each other ( @xcite ) .",
    "these results can be improved not just by longer temporal baselines for the previously known quasars , but also by better mapping out the contaminating internal motions of the clouds using additional quasar fields .",
    "the second familiar reason for finding background quasars is that bright quasars can be used in absorption studies of the interstellar medium ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this requires finding the brightest possible quasars behind the clouds , which is challenging given the density of contaminating sources and the low density of bright quasars , with only @xmath80.01 , 1 and 25 quasars / deg@xmath1 brighter than @xmath9 , 18 and 20 mag , respectively .",
    "the third application , which may be less familiar , is studying the physics of quasar variability .",
    "@xcite showed that quasar light curves can be well modeled as a damped random walk , a stochastic process with only three parameters : the mean light curve magnitude , a characteristic time - scale and an amplitude .",
    "their study , using @xmath10 quasars from the macho survey ( @xcite ) and quasars targeted for reverberation mapping ( @xcite ) , found strong correlations between these variability parameters and the physical properties of the quasars such as black hole mass and luminosity .",
    "@xcite , based on @xmath11 quasar candidates from @xcite with ogle - iii light curves , further demonstrated that the stochastic models describe quasar variability well , using a more powerful statistical approach from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite investigated these correlations in greater detail using the light curves of @xmath12 sdss quasars , finding that the amplitude of variability on long time scales decreases with increasing luminosity and increasing rest - frame wavelength , and that it is also correlated with black hole mass . the characteristic time scale for returning to the mean luminosity increases with increasing wavelength and increasing black hole mass , but remains constant with redshift and luminosity .",
    "there are discrepancies , however , between the time scale distributions in @xcite and @xcite which may be due to higher than estimated stellar contamination in @xcite , selection differences or the better light curves available for sources in microlensing fields .",
    "the individual parameter estimates for the sdss quasars are significantly worse than those for the cloud quasars , and this will also be true of light curves from other modern surveys like the catalina survey ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the palomar transient factory ( e.g. , @xcite ) , pan - starrs ( e.g. , @xcite ) or lsst ( e.g. , @xcite ) that attempt to cover large fractions of the sky rather than localized regions . the ogle microlensing survey has monitored the lmc , smc and the galactic bulge for @xmath13 years , providing light curves for 400 million objects ( @xcite ) .",
    "these fields have also been observed for shorter periods of time by the eros ( e.g. , ) , macho ( e.g. , @xcite ) , moa ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and supermacho ( e.g. , @xcite ) microlensing surveys , aiming primarily at detection of dark matter compact objects in the galactic halo ( e.g , ) .",
    "this leaves the problem of identifying the quasars , spectroscopically confirming them , and determining their properties ( luminosities , black hole mass estimates from emission line widths ) .",
    "@xcite pointed out that the mid - ir agn selection method of @xcite would also work reasonably well in dense stellar fields because the mid - ir colors of quasars are different from all normal stars .",
    "based on a simple three - level criteria , they selected @xmath14 quasar candidates behind the magellanic clouds from the sage ( @xcite ) and s3mc ( @xcite ) data . in this paper , we present the results of our aaomega spectroscopic follow - up of a single @xmath0 deg@xmath1 field in the smc , containing 268 quasar candidates from @xcite .",
    "we report the confirmation of 29 new quasars , and include a list of 12 plausible quasars . in section  [ sec : data ] we present the data analysis procedures . in section  [ sec : newquasars ]",
    "we present newly confirmed quasars , and in section  [ sec : deteff ] we discuss the detection efficiency .",
    "the paper is summarized in section  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "in @xcite we classified the candidates based on three criteria .",
    "first , objects in the @xcite mid - ir color selection region were classed as `` a '' if they lay away from the track of cool black bodies through the selection region and `` b '' if they lay close to the track .",
    "second , the brighter sources have mid - ir magnitudes also observed for young stellar objects ( ysos ) , so sources were classified as `` yso '' if they lay in the region heavily contaminated by ysos and as `` qso '' if they did not .",
    "finally , objects with the mid - ir to optical colors typical of quasars were classed as `` a '' , while those which did not were classed as `` b '' . for out first attempt at spectroscopic follow - up , we selected 249 qso - aa and 13 qso - ba quasar candidates , for a total of 262 targets .",
    "the sample included two previously confirmed quasars in the field ( @xmath15 and @xmath16 , @xcite ) .",
    "we also searched for optically variable objects in ogle - iiogle / photdb/ ] ( @xcite ) within the 3@xmath17 position uncertainties of the x - ray sources from .",
    "we targeted 6 x - ray / variability - selected objects , including one at @xmath18 confirmed in @xcite .",
    "since this was an experiment , we did not attempt to exclude known stellar objects from the target list ( see table  [ tab : results2 ] ) .",
    "this was one of several fields prepared for the lmc and smc , but the only one to be observed .",
    "732059.6 at @xmath19 , one of our 29 new spectroscopically confirmed quasars , as seen by the ogle 1.3-m ground - based telescope ( left ) and _ hst _ ( right ) .",
    "the blue and red colors are for v / f555w and i / f814w , respectively .",
    "the circle has the 2 arcsec diameter of the aaomega fibers , and is also comparable to the fwhm during the observations .",
    "the flux in the fiber is a blended combination of the bright blue star and the fainter , redder extended agn seen in the hst image .",
    "the image dimensions are 10  @xmath20 10  .",
    "north is up , east is to the left . , width=302 ]    the field was centered at ( r.a . , decl.@xmath2100:52:00.0 , @xmath2272:48:00.0 ) j2000 .",
    "while aaomega has a field of view of @xmath23 deg@xmath1 ( @xcite ) , the s3mc survey had a complex shape so that the actual overlapping area was @xmath0 deg@xmath1 .",
    "the spectra were obtained as a service observation on august 17 2009 in moderate sky conditions with @xmath24 arcsec seeing .",
    "we used the lowest resolution mode , with @xmath25 and a spectral coverage of approximately @xmath26 between the blue ( 580v ) and red ( 385r ) channels .",
    "we obtained three exposures of @xmath27  seconds , leading to signal - to - noise ratios ( s / n ) ranging from 3 to 300 , with 50% of the objects having @xmath28 ( figure  [ fig : contamination ] ) .",
    "we used 25 sky fibers , positioned to avoid stellar emission based on the ogle - iii smc catalogs ( @xcite ) .",
    "the initial fld files were created with the configure software , and the final analysis was done using the 2dfdr software ( @xcite ) .",
    "the most prominent feature of essentially every spectrum is the emission line contribution of the interstellar medium ( ism ) in the smc .",
    "these emission lines are redshifted by @xmath29 , consistent with the radial velocity of the smc ( e.g. , ) .",
    "since the stellar densities are high , contamination from nearby stars is also common , as shown by the ogle and hst images of the `` brightest '' new agn in figure  [ fig : hst ] .",
    "we estimated the contribution from nearby stars to the flux in the fiber by computing the contribution from stars within 10 arcsec to a 2 arcsec diameter fiber assuming a 2 arcsec fwhm gaussian seeing profile based on the ogle - iii photometric catalogs ( @xcite ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : contamination ] shows our estimate of this contaminating flux from stars relative to the flux of the quasar .",
    "because we are looking for emission line objects , there was no trivial relationship between either s / n or contamination and our ability to identify quasars .",
    "we searched each spectrum for the common ( redshifted ) quasar emission lines ( e.g. , @xcite ) ly@xmath30 at 1216 , h@xmath31 at 4101 , h@xmath32 at 4340 , h@xmath33 at 4861 , h@xmath30 at 6563 , magnesium mgii at 2800 , carbon civ at 1549  and ciii ] at 1909 , as well as the the narrow forbidden lines of oxygen [ o ii ] at 3727 , [ o iii ] at 4959  or 5007 . in general",
    ", we required the identification of two lines , except in the redshift range @xmath34 , where we can only find mgii despite the broad spectral coverage .",
    "we identified 29 new quasars behind the smc .",
    "their parameters ( including the identified lines ) are presented in table  [ tab : results1 ] ( top panel ) , and their spectra are shown in figure  [ fig : spectra1 ] .",
    "we also confirmed the 3 known quasars we included in the target list .",
    "another 12 were plausibly quasars with broad emission lines but remained somewhat ambiguous due to the low quality of their spectra .",
    "these objects are listed in table  [ tab : results1 ] ( middle panel ) .",
    "table  [ tab : results2 ] lists the remaining sources and any identifications available from simbad .",
    "we have not attempted to classify any of the stellar spectra ourselves .",
    "the low yield requires some discussion .",
    "@xcite identified 657 quasar candidates behind the smc , and 4699 behind the lmc . of these ,",
    "215 smc and 1296 lmc candidates are brighter than @xmath4 mag , corresponding to 72 and 32 candidates per square degree in the smc and lmc , respectively .",
    "the expected number of quasars with @xmath4  mag is @xmath35 per square degree ( @xcite ) , so we already had indications that the level of contamination was significantly higher in the smc / s3mc candidate list than in the lmc / sage candidate list .",
    "for the roughly @xmath36  deg@xmath1 overlap of the s3mc field and the aaomega field of view , we would expect @xmath37 quasars with @xmath4  mag .",
    "of the observed 268 quasar candidates we were able to confirm 29 new quasars or 11% of the targets . of these 29 quasars , 15 are brighter than @xmath4 mag , which is 40% of the expected number ( 15 out of an expected 38 ) .",
    "we noted after the observations were complete , that there is an @xmath80.1  mag blueward shift in the @xmath38-[4.5]$ ] colors between the @xmath83 deg@xmath1 s3mc data release of @xcite used by @xcite and the subsequent release of 30 deg@xmath1 ( @xcite ) .",
    "this would shift significant numbers of contaminating sources into the mid - ir color selection region .",
    "we may also have overestimated the purity of the smc mid - ir selected sample .",
    "this is suggested by the lower density of candidates ( 40 per deg@xmath1 ) identified in the lmc by @xcite and that the quasar variability time scale distribution of the mid - ir candidates in @xcite seems to extend to shorter time scales than those in the sdss sample considered by @xcite .",
    "we will investigate these issues in more detail once we have completed more spectroscopic fields .",
    "with the identification of 29 quasars , we have doubled the number of known quasars behind the smc . while the yields were lower than expected , there was already reason to expect this from the difference in the surface density of candidates behind the lmc and smc in the candidate catalogs of @xcite .",
    "fortunately , with the large numbers of fibers available on aaomega , there is little problem in targeting the candidates .",
    "we suspect that the yields in the lmc will be significantly higher .",
    "identifying large numbers of quasars in the microlensing regions is important not only for use as probes of the lmc / smc through proper motions or absorption studies .",
    "it is also important because of the revolution in studying quasar variability that began in 2009 with the introduction of a successful method for quantitatively modeling quasar variability as a damped random walk by @xcite , and its subsequent improvements in @xcite and @xcite . with the long , well - cadenced ogle - ii , ogle - iii and currently ogle - iv light curves",
    ", these new quasars will be invaluable for studying the variability properties of quasars if they can be identified in large enough numbers .",
    "even with the yields of the current observations , we would expect the full @xcite candidate list to produce @xmath81000 new quasars .",
