    "the boundary between stars and brown dwarfs is defined as the mass at which the luminosity of old objects is just dominated by hydrogen burning .",
    "this boundary is predicted to occur at a mass between 0.07 - 0.072@xmath3 at [ fe / h]=0 and @xmath20.092@xmath3 at [ fe / h]=-3 @xcite",
    ".    however , this boundary , and the theoretical relationships that predict effective temperature and luminosity as a function of mass and age , are largely untested by observations .",
    "the observations that are required to test these models are dynamical mass measurements of binary and multiple - star systems , combined with accurate photometry and distance determinations , preferably at known age .",
    "many stars between 0.1 and 0.2@xmath3 now have accurate dynamical masses @xcite , but objects with masses between the hydrogen burning limit and 0.1@xmath3 so far do not have accurate ( @xmath4% ) mass and luminosity determinations .",
    "dependence on theoretical models has led to controversy about the mass of brown dwarfs , particularly when objects are plausibly near the canonical planetary - mass boundary of @xmath213m@xmath5 ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . in the few cases where the dynamical mass of a brown dwarf has been measured @xcite ,",
    "precision is either inadequate to truly constrain models , or the model fits have to make unusual assumptions such as non - coeval systems @xcite .",
    "gj  802 is a m5 field dwarf system at @xmath216pc that was discovered to have a brown dwarf component through astrometry @xcite . the subsequent detection of the companion , gj  802b , with aperture - masking interferometry @xcite made this an ideal target for dynamical mass determination , due to the system s @xmath23 year period .",
    "the high contrast ( @xmath2100:1 ) and small separation ( @xmath6mas ) of gj  802ab make this system too difficult for direct imaging observations , but is in an ideal range for interferometric detection .",
    "this paper reports aperture - masking interferometry detections of gj  802b at six epochs in three colors , enough to make good measurements of the orbit , and the discovery that gj  802a is itself a close spectroscopic m dwarf binary .",

    "we compare our results to theoretical predictions and section  [ sectconclusion ] has a summary and discussion .",
    "the observations on which this paper is based consist of seeing - limited astrometry , aperture - masking interferometry , infrared and visible spectroscopy and photometry .",
    "the astrometry observations , in addition to parallax and proper motion , provide the orbit of the gj  802aab pair about the gj  802ab center of mass .",

    "it involves placing a mask with an array of holes of non - redundant spacing in the pupil - plane of a telescope , and analyzing the recorded images as interference fringes on a number of discrete baselines .",
    "recently , our group has used this technique behind adaptive optics at the palomar 200 inch and keck telescopes to increase the magnitude limit of the technique beyond that achievable in a seeing - limited speckle mode .",
    "the reason for the technique s success over direct adaptive - optics imaging is that the calibration is independent of structure of the wavefront over scales larger than a single sub - aperture , but it still preserves the angular resolution of the full aperture .",
    "aperture - masking observations of gj  802 were made using both the pharo camera of the palomar 200 inch telescope @xcite and the nirc2 camera of the keck ii telescope .",
    "the palomar aperture - masking mode of the pharo camera is described in @xcite .",
    "the nirc2 aperture - masking mode is similar , although the masks are placed in the filter wheels of the nirc2 camera rather than a designated pupil wheel as is the case with pharo .",
    "the masks create fringe patterns in the image - plane of each detector .",
    "our primary observable , closure - phase , is extracted from these fringe patterns and models are fit to the closure phases .",
    "a summary of all aperture - masking observations , along with the detected binary properties , are given in table  [ tabapmasking ] .",
    "for the nirc2 and pharo aperture - masking experiments , both 9 and 18 hole masks are available .",
    "the 9 hole mask results in 36 simultaneous baselines and 28 independent closure - phases .",
    "the 18 hole mask results in 153 simultaneous baselines and 136 independent closure - phases , but has half the throughput of the 9 hole mask and spreads the light over 4 times as many pixels as the 9 hole mask .",
    "all observations were done with a 9 hole mask in h and k bands , except the june 2007 j@xmath8 observation for which a 18 hole mask was used . in the absence of sky rotation ,",
    "the field - of - view of the aperture - masking experiment is given by @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the shortest baseline in the mask .",
    "outside this field - of - view , the position angle and separation become ambiguous without multiple exposures at different sky rotations .",
    "although the 9 hole mask was well suited to h and k observations at both keck and palomar , the @xmath273mas separation of gj 802b would have been outside the nominal 9 hole mask field of view in j band .    in a similar manner ,",
    "the aperture masking inner working angle is given by @xmath11/2b@xmath12 , where b@xmath12 is the longest baseline ( near to the full aperture size ) .",
    "at this separation , the maximum closure phase signal is equal to the contrast ratio of the binary ( i.e. 0.01 radians or 0.6 degrees for a 100:1 binary ) . in the case of the pharo observations of june 2004 and october 2006 , these nominal inner detection limits are 43 and 57mas respectively . near this inner edge ,",
    "the contrast ratio and separation for model - fitting are degenerate . despite their large errors on separation , these detections are therefore reliable .",
    "we explicitly list the correlations between separation and contrast in table  2 .",
    "we have made several improvements to the analysis pipeline and observing procedure since the original detection published in @xcite .",
    "the most important improvement has been in the observations themselves : we have generally been much more careful in using calibrators of similar brightness , colors and position in the sky .",
    "this procedure was not used carefully for the discovery epoch of september 2004 , and we find that the astrometry depends on which of several unsuitable calibrators are used in the analysis .",
    "therefore , we choose not to use this epoch in our analysis here , and it is not presented in table  [ tabapmasking ] .",
    "we have windowed the data prior to fourier - transforming with a tighter function than previous publications to minimize residual chip - based effects ( e.g. of bad pixels ) .",
    "the window size is of the form exp@xmath13 with a full - width half - maximum of @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is our aperture - mask hole diameter projected onto the primary mirror .",
    "this tighter window also has the effect of spatially - filtering the interferometric data .",
    "the raw frames from the pharo camera are taken in a mode where all ( non - destructive ) reads are saved .",
    "this allows us to split the data in post - processing into a variety of integration times , where smaller integration times have less atmospheric and ao system noise but more readout noise .",
    "we now carefully choose an optimal number of sub - reads to analyze data of a given brightness : for gj  802 we split the data into sub - frames spaced by 2 reads , which have integration times of 862ms each .",

    "least square fits were made to the continuum subtracted spectra of gj 802 , based on a model made up of the sum of two shifted gj 777b spectra .",
    "we chose this technique rather than a cross - correlation because the two spectra were not separated well enough to give clearly separate peaks in the cross - correlation .",
    "the errors in the velocity difference come straight from the least - squares fitting process , where the uncertainty in the gj  802 spectrum was set to 1.3% of the mean flux so that the model fit had a reduced @xmath7 of 1 .",
    "an uncertainty on the velocity difference based on deviations from a linear fit to the measured velocities would be 2.5kms@xmath17 .",
