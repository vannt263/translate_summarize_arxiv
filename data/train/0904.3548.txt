    "one of the most basic requirements for the models is that they be flat .",
    "the essential tool to investigate this and other questions of a local nature , also introduced in @xcite , is the _ local model : _ this is a scheme tale - locally isomorphic to the original model , but defined in terms of a purely linear - algebraic moduli problem , and thus  at least in principle  more amenable to direct study .    local models for groups involving only types @xmath3 and",
    "@xmath4 have received much study in the past decade ; see , for example , work of pappas @xcite , grtz @xcite , haines and ng @xcite , pappas and rapoport @xcite , krmer @xcite , and arzdorf @xcite .",
    "by contrast , the subject of this paper is the essential case of type @xmath2 : local models for the split orthogonal similitude group @xmath5 with iwahori level structure .",
    "unfortunately , as observed by genestier ( see @xcite*8.3 , p.  560 ) , the local model defined in @xcite _ fails to be flat _ in the orthogonal case , even when the group is split ; subsequently , this scheme has come to be renamed the _ naive local model @xmath6_. failure of flatness has also been observed , first by pappas @xcite , for local models in type @xmath3 and @xmath4 cases for groups that split only after a ramified field extension . as in these cases , there is a `` brute force '' correction available to non - flatness of @xmath6 : one simply _ defines _ the true local model @xmath7 to be the scheme - theoretic closure in @xmath6 of the generic fiber @xmath8 . a priori",
    ", this definition of @xmath7 carries the disadvantage of not admitting a ready moduli - theoretic description .",
    "thus it is of interest when such a description can be found . in @xcite pappas and rapoport",
    "propose to describe @xmath7 by adding a new condition , the so - called _ spin condition _",
    "( see [ ss : spin_cond ] ) , to the moduli problem defining @xmath6 .",
    "we denote by @xmath9 the subscheme of @xmath6 representing pappas s and rapoport s strengthened moduli problem .",
    "one obtains @xmath10 as a closed subscheme , and pappas and rapoport show that the generic fibers of the two schemes agree .",

    "@xmath11 , that is , @xmath9 is the scheme - theoretic closure in @xmath6 of the generic fiber .",
    "although the conjecture remains open in general , pappas and rapoport have obtained a considerable amount of computer evidence in support of it , and they explicitly work out the case @xmath12 and part of the case @xmath13 in @xcite .",
    "hand calculations in the case @xmath14 show that @xmath9 is indeed flat with reduced special fiber .",
    "the main result of this paper is the following weak form of the conjecture .",
    "@xmath9 is topologically flat , that is , it has dense generic fiber .    in other words , the theorem asserts that the underlying topological spaces of @xmath9 and @xmath7 are the same . the strategy to prove the theorem is the same as that pioneered in grtz s original paper @xcite : we    1 .",

    "the problem of obtaining a good description of the schubert cells occurring in @xmath17 is essentially that of identifying the schubert cells of maximal dimension in @xmath17 , since these parametrize the irreducible components of @xmath17 ; and this translates to a purely combinatorial problem in the iwahori - weyl group @xmath18 of @xmath5 , which indexes the schubert cells in . in this form ,",
    "the problem becomes essentially that of _ @xmath1-permissibility vs.  @xmath1-admissibility _ considered by kottwitz - rapoport @xcite and subsequently by haines - ng @xcite .",
    "more precisely , consider the dominant minuscule cocharacters @xmath19 for @xmath5 ( expressed as cocharacters for the standard diagonal torus in the ambient @xmath20 ) , and regard them as translation elements in @xmath18 .",
    "let @xmath21 denote the finite weyl group of the identity component @xmath22 .",
    "the special fiber @xmath23 has two connected components , and it is easy to see that the schubert cells corresponding to the @xmath21-conjugates of @xmath24 ( resp . , @xmath25 ) are all contained in one component ( resp . , the other ) .",

    "it is especially worth comparing with the symplectic case .",
    "indeed , denote by @xmath39 ( resp . ,",
    "@xmath40 ) the iwahori - weyl group for @xmath20 ( resp . , @xmath38 ) .",

    "these sets are obtained by intersecting @xmath40 with the relevant sets in @xmath39 , so that the theorem for @xmath38 follows from the theorem for @xmath20 .",
    "but there seems to be no such royal road in the orthogonal case . to prove our theorem , we go back to kottwitz s and rapoport s original argument for @xmath37 and adapt it to the orthogonal setting , where some new subtleties arise .",
    "kottwitz and rapoport define @xmath1-admissibility and @xmath1-permissibility for any cocharacter @xmath1 in any extended affine weyl group attached to a root datum , and they show that @xmath1-admissibility always implies @xmath1-permissibility .",
    "however , haines and ng @xcite*7.2 have shown that the reverse implication does not hold in general .",
    "on the other hand , motivated by considerations arising from shimura varieties , rapoport @xcite*3 , p.  283",
    "has raised the question of whether @xmath1-admissibility and @xmath1-permissibility agree for _ minuscule _",
    "cocharacters @xmath1 , or even for sums of dominant minuscule cocharacters . in the particular",
    "setting of this paper , @xmath18 contains exactly three dominant minuscule cocharacters modulo the subgroup @xmath41 : @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath42 we give a proof of the equality @xmath43 in @xcite .",
    "results of kottwitz - rapoport @xcite , this paper , and @xcite combine to answer rapoport s question in the affirmative for all minuscule @xmath1 in root data involving only types @xmath3 , @xmath44 , @xmath4 , and @xmath2 . by contrast , we shall show in @xcite that the answer to the more optimistic question , namely whether @xmath1-admissibility and @xmath1-permissibility are equivalent for @xmath1 a sum of dominant minuscule cocharacters , can be negative .",
    "somewhat surprisingly , pappas and rapoport have discovered that a version of the spin condition also turns up in their study of local models for ramified , quasi - split @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "we shall show that the `` spin '' local models they define are topologically flat in @xcite .    for simplicity ,",
    "in this paper we focus solely on the case of iwahori level structure , and we ignore the explicit connection between local models and shimura varieties  although this is certainly our main source of motivation to study local models .",
    "we intend to take up the case of general parahoric level structure , as well as the connection to shimura varieties , in a subsequent paper .",
    "we now outline the contents of the paper . in [ s : loc_mod ] we review the definitions of orthogonal local models , both the naive version and the strengthened version incorporating the pappas - rapoport spin condition .",
    "sections [ s : g0_2n][s : wtw ] consist of some preparation of a group - theoretic nature for our subsequent discussion of the affine flag variety for @xmath5 over @xmath16 . in [ s : aff_flag_vty ] we review the affine flag variety itself . in [ s : embedding ] , we embed the special fiber of the naive local model into the affine flag variety , and we use this to reduce the question of topological flatness for the spin model to the combinatorial identity @xmath46 for @xmath26 . in [ s : adm_perm_sets ] we prove the identity @xmath46 , as well as the identity @xmath47 , for @xmath26 ; this forms the technical heart of the paper .",

    "indeed , our lemma [ st:[wta , a)_lem ] , formulated without the requirement that @xmath724 , continues to hold in the @xmath37 setting .",
    "so , using the language of @xcite , if @xmath827 has minuscule associated alcove @xmath828 and is not a translation element , then there must exist a proper @xmath829 , and the lemma immediately furnishes an @xmath453 such that @xmath830 is minuscule and @xmath668 . on the other hand",
    ", @xcite actually proves a little more : namely , that @xmath453 can always be chosen to satisfy the additional constraint that the translation parts of @xmath32 and @xmath602 are the same .",
    "we can find such an @xmath453 by letting @xmath62 denote the _ minimal _ proper element in @xmath157 ; then @xmath831 or @xmath832 does the job .    as noted by kottwitz and rapoport",
    ", it follows that @xmath833 much more generally , haines @xcite*proof of 4.6 , using hecke algebra techniques , has shown that continues to hold when @xmath834 is replaced by the extended affine weyl group attached to any root datum .",
    "unfortunately , the arguments in this paper do not seem to yield a direct proof of for @xmath18 and @xmath26 .",
    "we conclude the paper by showing that kottwitz s and rapoport s notion of @xmath1-permissibility @xcite agrees with our notion of @xmath1-spin - permissibility for elements in @xmath18 .",
