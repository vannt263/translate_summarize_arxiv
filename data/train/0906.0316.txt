    "the mostly investigated kaon photoproduction on the nucleon are the proton channels  @xcite , i.e. , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , since the experimental data are available for these channels  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , it is not the case for the neutron channels , since free neutron targets are not available .",
    "instead , one can use deuteron as effective neutron targets because it has a small binding energy and simple structures .",
    "therefore , kaon photoproduction on the deuteron is the natural candidate for investigating the kaon photoproduction on the neutron .",
    "furthermore , since the reaction on the deuteron yields several particles in the final state , it is important to include final state effects in the calculations .",
    "it seems that kaon photoproduction on the deuteron can serve as an alternative reaction for studying the @xmath4 interaction through the @xmath4 rescattering at the final state .",
    "a previous study  @xcite has investigated @xmath4 final state interaction effect by using realistic @xmath4 potentials .",
    "another previous study  @xcite has included @xmath5 rescattering effect and @xmath6 intermediate process in its calculations for charged kaon channels by using separable interactions . concerning the study of neutron channels , li  _ et al .",
    "@xcite has shown the possibility to extract the elementary amplitude from the reaction on the deuteron .",
    "very recently an experiment of neutral kaon photoproduction on the deuterium has been done at the laboratory of nuclear science ( lns ) , in sendai  @xcite .",
    "they measured the cross section of the @xmath7 process at a photon energy around the threshold with forward kaon angles .",
    "this paper is structured as follow .",
    "the formalism for calculating the transition matrix and observables are shown in sect .",
    "[ formulations ] . the results and comparisons with experimental data are presented in sect .",
    "[ results ] and we close the paper with conclusions in sect .  [ conclusions ] .",
    "in this work we use the kaon - maid model  @xcite , which includes the @xmath8(1895 ) resonance beside the born terms and other resonances as shown in figure  [ fig - gnky - drivingterm ] , for the elementary operator .",
    "separate hadronic form factors for each vertex were used in order to restore gauge invariance .    through out the paper we work in the deuteron rest frame . for the inclusive process @xmath9 the cross section",
    "is given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 is the hyperon momentum calculated in the center of mass frame of the two final baryons .",
    "the total amplitudes on the deuteron are calculated according to the diagrams shown in figure  [ fig - gdkyn - amplitudes ] . for the deuteron wave function and @xmath4 interaction",
    "we use the nijmegen models as in the previous studies  @xcite .",
    "separable interactions rank-1 are applied for the calculations of @xmath5 rescattering and @xmath6 process .    with respect to polarization observables",
    ", we consider the tensor target asymmetries @xmath13 which are given by  @xcite @xmath14 where @xmath15 with a kinematic factor @xmath16 for extracting the elementary amplitudes , we use the expression @xmath17 where @xmath18 on the r.h.s . of eq .",
    "( [ eq - gdkyn - exclusive - cross - section - extract ] ) the sum of the squared amplitudes of the elementary process @xmath19 has been completely separated from the deuteron wave function .",
    "figure  [ fig - comparison - experimental - data ] shows comparisons between the inclusive cross sections of the models and of the experimental data for reaction @xmath20 as a function of kaon momentum @xmath21 at forward kaon angle @xmath22 .",
    "the left panel for photon energy @xmath23 gev and the right one for @xmath24 gev .",
    "the curves are calculated in the impulse approximation only and the data are taken from tsukada  _ et al . _",
    "there are several sets of coupling constant by kaon - maid model .",
    "the first one is the set obtained after fitting with the experimental data by including the @xmath8(1895 ) resonance or the so called missing resonance .",
    "it is shown by the solid line in the figure and we call this as set a. the other ones are the sets without the missing resonance , which are shown by the different dashed lines in the figure and we call these as sets b.    as can be seen from the figure , the set a gives over predictions , while the sets b can describe the data fairly well in the @xmath0 channels ( up to @xmath25 gev / c for @xmath23 gev and up to @xmath26 gev / c for @xmath24 gev ) and are still poor for the @xmath1 channel ( up to threshold of @xmath21 for both photon energies ) . the discrepancies between the set a and the experimental data are originated from the value of coupling constant in the vertex of @xmath27 of the set a ( see diagram ( f ) of figure  [ fig - gdkyn - amplitudes ] )",
    ". we can see it from the figure as follow . by setting the value of @xmath27 coupling to zero in the set a ( indicated with no @xmath28 in the figure )",
    ", then the cross section reduces to the value in the order of sets b and the experimental data .",
    "figure  [ fig - tensor - asymmetry-1100 ] shows the tensor target asymmetries as a function of kaon angle @xmath29 for photon energy @xmath30 = 1.1 gev .",
    "the solid lines are obtained after including all final state effects , the dashed ones only ia+yn+kn , the short - dashed ones only ia+yn , and the dotted ones only impulse approximation ( ia ) . as can be seen in the figure ,",
    "the tensor target asymmetries are very sensitive to the final state effects .    figure  [ fig - extraction - elementary - amplitude ] shows the elementary amplitude as a function of kaon angle @xmath29 for different photon energy and different spectator proton momentum .",
    "the solid lines are the extracted elementary amplitudes from the reaction on the deuteron , while the dashed ones are obtained from the free process . as can be seen in the figure that the agreement between the extracted and the ones from the free process are very good especially in the quasi - free scattering kinematics , where the spectator proton has zero momentum .",
    "the sets b of kaon - maid models describe the experimental data better than the set a. this indicates that the data on the deuteron can be used to study the elementary process .",
    "tensor target asymmetries are more suitable for investigating the @xmath4 interaction through the rescattering effects at the final state of @xmath31 . for the process @xmath32",
    ", the rescattering effects are negligibe at the quasi - free scattering ( qfs ) kinematics .",
    "this gives us a possibility to extract the elementary amplitude . at qfs kinematics",
    "the extracted and the free - process amplitudes agree well .",
    "this demonstrates that kaon photoproduction on the deuteron in the qfs kinematics can be used for investigating the elementary process in the neutron channels .",
    "this suggests that qfs kinematics is suitable for measurements .",
    "some parts of this work were done during one of the authors ( as ) staying at okayama university of science , okayama and tohoku university , sendai . therefore as would like to thank the people form both universities for warm hospitalities .",
