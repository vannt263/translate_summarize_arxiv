    "<S> we discuss correspondence between the predictions of quantum theories for rotation angle formulated in infinite and finite dimensional hilbert spaces , taking as example , the calculation of matrix elements of phase - angular momentum commutator . </S>",
    "<S> a new derivation of the matrix elements is presented in infinite space , making use of a unitary transformation that maps from the state space of periodic functions to non - periodic functions , over which the spectrum of angular momentum operator is in general , fractional . </S>",
    "<S> the approach can be applied to finite dimensional hilbert space also , for which identical matrix elements are obtained .    </S>",
    "<S> -.75 in 14.5 cm    many interesting quantum phenomena , such as in josephson junctions @xcite , aharonov - bohm effect @xcite , fractional statistics in quantum hall effect @xcite or superfluid thin films @xcite , are a consequence of the periodic or non - periodic nature of wave function under change in the phase variable associated with it . </S>",
    "<S> however , the idea of a hermitian phase operator , which may serve as possible observable in quantum mechanics , has a long history . </S>",
    "<S> dirac @xcite first of all attempted to obtain a phase operator for harmonic oscillator by defining a polar decomposition of annihilation operator , @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> however , the exponential phase operator so defined is not unitary @xcite and so does not yield a hermitian operator @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> it is now generally accepted that a hermitian phase operator does not exist for harmonic oscillator . </S>",
    "<S> a related system is of a quantum rotor in plane . here due to the angular momentum being unbounded , a hermitian operator @xmath2 may be defined , which has continuum of phase eigenvalues @xmath3 . the hilbert space of the system is space of square integrable functions of polar angle @xmath3 in the range @xmath4 $ ] , with lebesgue measure @xmath5 . a differential realization for the third component of angular momentum @xmath6 </S>",
    "<S> , then implies the canonical commutator @xmath7 = i$ ] .    </S>",
    "<S> however to deal with bounded operators @xcite or finite spin systems @xcite , finite dimensional version of phase operator formalism have been proposed . </S>",
    "<S> a distinct feature of this formalism is that eigenvalues of phase operator are restricted to quantised values . naturally then </S>",
    "<S> , differential realization for @xmath8 is not valid as it assumes a continuity of phase eigenvalues . </S>",
    "<S> a hermitian phase operator @xmath9 so defined , satisfies a different commutator with @xmath8 = _ m , m^ = -l ^l,(mm^ ) [ com ] where @xmath10 is dimension of the space and dirac notation for states is used . </S>",
    "<S> one such formalism that has gained attention in recent years , is the pegg - barnett ( pb ) theory @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it emphasizes a specific limiting procedure : the physical results are to be obtained when the infinite dimensional limit is taken , _ </S>",
    "<S> after _ the calculation of expectation values for observables . </S>",
    "<S> for the angular momentum case , it means that only in the semi - classical limit ( @xmath11 ) , can predictions of the theory match with physical results . although the analogous formalism for phase of quantised electromagnetic field has been intensively studied and also debated in recent years @xcite , there have been relatively fewer studies elaborating the implications of the pb theory for rotation angle in quantum mechanics . </S>",
    "<S> an example is non - trivial notion of angular velocity in this formalism , where the usual heisenberg equation for phase operator does not predict physically intuitive result . </S>",
    "<S> a solution was presented in @xcite by recourse to the classical - quantum correspondence .    </S>",
    "<S> the infinite space formalism has its own share of subtleties . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the usual heisenberg uncertainty relation between @xmath2 and @xmath8 does not apply @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one of the often discussed issues has been the seeming inconsistency in the calculation of matrix elements of canonical commutator , @xmath12m)$ ] , over periodic wave functions @xmath13 , satisfying @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> it was thought that the problem lies in the operation @xmath15 , which projects wave functions out of the space of periodic functions . </S>",
    "<S> so the use of a bare phase operator was rejected in favour of defining a suitable periodic extension of phase operator @xcite or using periodic functions of the phase operator @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , if the adjoint of @xmath8 is taken carefully , then the problem vanishes @xcite and well behaved matrix elements of the commutator are obtained ( n,[,_z]m)=12_0 ^ 2d e^-in[,_z ] e^im = i_mn . </S>",
    "<S> [ rlim ] however , within the finite dimensional space , different matrix elements are obtained @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , given the commutator ( [ com ] ) , the diagonal elements vanish m|[_l,_z]|m=0 . </S>",
    "<S> [ diag ] this result is exact for all angular momentum eigenstates @xmath16 where @xmath17 . thus taking @xmath11 , </S>",
    "<S> does not yield the result in infinite space . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we try to address the question of correspondence between results of these matrix elements in the finite and infinite dimensional spaces . </S>",
    "<S> we adopt a different approach for the calculation of these elements and argue that results in finite space can also match with those in the infinite space .    </S>",
    "<S> the difficulty discussed above for infinite space springs from the fact that @xmath8 is not self - adjoint on the space of nonperiodic functions of the kind @xmath18 which turn up during the calculation . </S>",
    "<S> still , this does not exclude the use of other non - periodic functions ( if they serve any useful purpose ) over which angular momentum operator is self - adjoint . </S>",
    "<S> note that using the differential realisation and by partial integration , we obtain ( u_2,_zu_1 ) = ( _ zu_2,u_1 ) -i2 [ u_2^*(2)u_1(2 ) - u_2^*(0)u_1(0 ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> the surface term vanishes or alternately , @xmath8 becomes hermitian if its eigenfunctions satisfy @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is positive real parameter . </S>",
    "<S> we denote the angular momentum operator by @xmath21 , whose domain ( @xmath22 ) is the above mentioned space of non - periodic functions @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that @xmath24\\ne d[\\hat{l}_z(s)]$ ] for non - integer values of parameter @xmath20 , and that both operators have same differential realisation @xmath25 . in other words , both satisfy the same canonical commutator with @xmath2 and the matrix elements of this commutator can be correctly evaluated over their respective domains along the lines presented in @xcite . in literature , usually hermiticity is guaranteed for @xmath8 by restricting its state space to periodic functions ( @xmath20 is zero or integer valued ) . </S>",
    "<S> but it is clear that periodicity of wave functions is required only to keep the spectrum of @xmath8 integer valued . </S>",
    "<S> theoretical possibilities such as generalized statistics do exist , where spectrum of @xmath8 is in general , fractional @xcite . in the following , we make use of the freedom of parameter @xmath20 to derive the matrix elements of canonical commutator .    </S>",
    "<S> we have seen that @xmath26 $ ] consists of wave functions @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> these can be generated from the usual periodic functions @xmath28 , by a unitary transformation : @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> also we have @xmath30 , in analogy with @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> now consider the term = e^is_z -_z(s)e^is . </S>",
    "<S> [ rterm ] evaluating @xmath32 , we can easily verify that ( [ rlim ] ) is satisfied . </S>",
    "<S> note that the need for taking adjoint of angular momentum operator is dispensed with , since @xmath8 and @xmath21 have to act in their respective domains only .    </S>",
    "<S> it is the unitary transformation @xmath33 which is of present interest to us . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , it can be used to define a generalized dynamics @xcite for current - biased josephson junction . </S>",
    "<S> the parameter @xmath20 in this case , takes a physical interpretation and represents an external magnetic flux linked to the junction . </S>",
    "<S> this system is equivalent to the system of a charged particle on a ring with magnetic flux through the centre of the ring . </S>",
    "<S> thus the limit @xmath34 in our calculation , represents the limit in which magnetic flux at the centre of ring goes to zero .    for transparency </S>",
    "<S> , we also calculate in dirac notation . </S>",
    "<S> the states @xmath35 form a complete orthonormal basis like the standard angular momentum basis @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> the periodic phase eigenstate can be written as |= 1 _ </S>",
    "<S> m=-^+ e^-im|m , [ p1 ] or equivalently |= 1 _ m=-^+ e^-i(m+s)|m+s . </S>",
    "<S> [ p2 ] relevant operators are defined by the following representation _ z|m&= & m|m , + _ z(s)|m+s&= & ( m+s)|m+s , +    unitary transformation exists e^is = _ m=-^+ |m+sm| . </S>",
    "<S> [ uny ] the unitarity of this operator follows simply from completeness of states . for @xmath37 , we get resolution of unity over standard angular momentum states . </S>",
    "<S> note again that due to the angular momentum being unbounded , the system of states is invariant under any finite integer shift @xmath20 . due to this invariance </S>",
    "<S> , we can restrict the range of @xmath20 as @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> particularly , for @xmath39 , we have the canonical unitary phase operator which shifts an angular momentum state by unity . for this case </S>",
    "<S> , the unitary operator may be said to shift states within the same orthonormal basis , while for other values of @xmath20 , ( [ uny ] ) clearly takes from one orthonormal basis to another .    </S>",
    "<S> next we consider the matrix elements when dimension of angular momentum space is finite . from the @xmath40 term ( [ rterm ] ) defined in infinite space </S>",
    "<S> , we were able to derive the matrix elements of canonical commutator @xmath7 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> thus it is interesting to extend this calculation to finite space also and see if we can recover , say ( [ diag ] ) or not . we take @xmath41 , and calculate the matrix elements @xmath42 , where now all operators act in @xmath10 dimensional space . </S>",
    "<S> analogous to ( [ p1 ] ) and ( [ p2 ] ) , we can define the phase states in finite space in terms of either the @xmath43 states or @xmath44 states , as follows |_l&= & 1 _ m =- </S>",
    "<S> l^+l e^-im_l|m , + & = & 1 _ </S>",
    "<S> m =- l^+l e^-i(m-1+s)_l|m-1+s . </S>",
    "<S> [ pxy ] these are eigenstates of phase operator @xmath45 , which form a conjugate @xmath10-dimensional orthonormal basis , if the phase eigenvalues are quantised as @xmath46 , where @xmath47 , for phase operator defined in @xmath48 range . </S>",
    "<S> apart from @xmath49 , we also have _ </S>",
    "<S> z(s)|m-1+s= ( m-1+s)|m-1+s . from ( [ pxy ] ) , we have the following unitary transformation e^is_l = _ m =- l^l-1 |m+sm| + |-l-1+sl| , [ unyl ] which may be looked as a generalized phase operator producing arbitrary shift in the angular momentum states . </S>",
    "<S> its operation on angular momentum states has been shown pictorially in the figure . </S>",
    "<S> note that for @xmath39 , we have the standard phase operator formalism in finite space @xcite .    before we present results for matrix elements , a remark is in place . for infinite dimensional case </S>",
    "<S> , we can take the @xmath34 limit at the operator level , for example , in ( [ uny ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus one recovers the canonical commutator @xmath7 $ ] from the quantity @xmath50 , in the @xmath34 limit . </S>",
    "<S> however , this is not correct within finite space theory , as can be seen from ( [ unyl ] ) ; taking @xmath34 limit does not give the identity operator . </S>",
    "<S> the reason for this difference is that in order to satisfy unitarity , the operator ( [ unyl ] ) produces a shift of @xmath20 in all @xmath16 states , except for @xmath51 case , for which the shift is @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> this discontinuity in the shift property of unitary phase operator is also present in the @xmath39 case of standard formalism @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> note that we should investigate the limit in which magnitude of the shift produced goes to zero . in the infinite dimensional case , </S>",
    "<S> shifts in all states were of equal magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> as an implication , separate limits are to be taken depending on whether in the calculation of matrix elements , the state @xmath53 is involved or not . </S>",
    "<S> thus the said limit is taken only _ </S>",
    "<S> after _ the matrix elements are calculated .    now observing that n|e^is_l_z|k= k_m =- l^l-1n|m+s_mk + k n|-l-1+s_lk , [ t1 ] and n|_z(s)e^is_l|k= _ m =- l^l-1 ( m+s)n|m+s_mk + ( -l-1+s)n|-l-1+s_lk [ t2 ] we can calculate @xmath42 . to evaluate proper limit , we distinguish two cases :    \\(i ) if for some @xmath54 in the range @xmath55 , @xmath56 , then we obtain n||k= -sn|k+s . </S>",
    "<S> thus we get _ s0 1is n||k= i_nk . [ lim1 ] </S>",
    "<S> ( ii ) if @xmath57 , then n||l= -n|l+ , where parameter @xmath58 has been defined above . therefore considering the limit when the shift @xmath58 approaches zero _ 0 1i n||l = i_nl . </S>",
    "<S> [ lim2 ] thus from our result for infinite dimensional space , we might expect that limiting behaviour of @xmath42 in finite space , may yield the matrix elements such as ( [ diag ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , we see that the obtained matrix elements ( [ lim1 ] ) and ( [ lim2 ] ) exactly correspond with the elements ( [ rlim ] ) , provided the limits in which the shift parameter goes to zero are carefully taken .    concluding , we have presented a new derivation for matrix elements of canonical commutator between phase and angular momentum operators . </S>",
    "<S> we have utilised the more general state space of non - periodic eigenfunctions over which the spectrum of angular momentum can be fractional . </S>",
    "<S> the matrix elements are obtained in the limiting case ( @xmath34 ) , when integer valued angular momenta are realised . </S>",
    "<S> we remark that the limit @xmath34 has been used here only as calculational tool ; we do not imply that matrix elements of the canonical commutator are well defined only for @xmath34 case . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we do not question the relevance of canonical commutator @xmath59 = i$ ] for circumstances where @xmath60 may be significant @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we have extended the technique to finite dimensional space also , where it is required to introduce a generalization ( [ unyl ] ) of unitary phase operator such that standard case @xcite of @xmath39 is also recovered . </S>",
    "<S> it is argued that similar matrix elements as of infinite space can be obtained . </S>",
    "<S> thus we have here another example of the correspondence between predictions of quantum theories for rotation angle in infinite and finite dimensional spaces . </S>"
