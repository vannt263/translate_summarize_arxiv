    "it is well known that the quantization of gauge field theories is affected by ambiguities due the existence of equivalent gauge configurations which are not fully specified by the gauge fixing condition .",
    "this point was discovered by gribov @xcite . for modern reviews ,",
    "see also @xcite and @xcite .",
    "normally the quantization procedure has problems only for the yang - mills theories .",
    "the existence of gribov ambiguities means that the gauge fixing conditions are valid only in a local sense . in particular",
    "this problem is relevant in the context of the infrared behavior of the theory .",
    "if we restrict ourselves to the abelian case , for example qed , it can be shown that the gribov ambiguities can be factorized as a global external factor @xcite which does not affect the functional integral over the gauge fields .",
    "this is related to the triviality of mappings between the circle , where the abelian gauge lives at infinity , and the sphere @xmath5 , which are trivial .",
    "however , if we address now the problem of the u(1 ) theory in the presence of temperature and/or chemical potential effects , the ambiguity problem turns out to be also non trivial in the abelian sector @xcite . in that article",
    "@xcite it is shown that there is a gribov ambiguity at finite temperature for the abelian gauge theory if the gauge theory is defined on the full gauge orbit space , i.e. , in a global way .",
    "the non trivial structure at zero temperature , with a finite chemical potential , is related to the existence of the homotopy group between the circle of the gauge group u(1 ) and the 2d plane with the origin excluded .",
    "as we will see , the kernel that solves the schrdinger type operator at the gribov horizon is singular at the origin .",
    "if we remove this point , automatically a topological stable solution emerges .",
    "the details are presented in the next section .    in the case",
    "where both @xmath6 and @xmath7 , the non trivial solutions are characterized by the homotopy group between the gauge group and the circle defined by the compactified time . in this case",
    "we need also to exclude the origin in order to have a finite kernel .",
    "this time , however , we do not have the restriction of being in a two dimensional plane , as in the previous case . therefore",
    ", we do not have a nontrivial topological structure associated to the space region because a full sphere without the origin is still topologically equivalent to a sphere , and the homotopy group between the circle of the gauge group and the sphere is trivial .    in the present article",
    "we will extend this idea by considering the abelian higgs model in the presence of chemical potential ( @xmath1 ) and temperature effects , when an explicitly @xmath1 dependent gauge fixing condition is considered . in a previous paper @xcite",
    ", the dependence on the gauge - fixing condition of several quantities in the u(1 ) higgs model at finite temperature and chemical potential @xmath1 has been analyzed .",
    "the idea was to compute the effective potential at the one loop level using a @xmath1-dependent gauge fixing condition which allows to decouple the contribution of the different fields in the model .    here",
    "we will concentrate on the gribov ambiguities associated to such a gauge fixing conditions , giving also a geometrical interpretation of the ambiguities when finite temperature effects are included .",
    "first , we discuss the effective schrdinger type operator that allows to find the gribov boundaries in the fields space .",
    "we emphasize the topological role of finite temperature , associated to the kubo - martin - schwinger ( kms ) boundary conditions .",
    "our discussion includes both the unbroken as well as the broken u(1 ) case , where unbroken refers to the existence of a non vanishing expectation value for the higgs field .",
    "we show that the finite chemical potential implies a restriction to the existence of gribov copies .",
    "the abelian higgs model is described by the following lagrangian    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is a complex scalar field .",
    "as it is well known , we need @xmath10 , and the covariant derivative is given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the coupling constant .",
    "notice that the chemical potential , which is the lagrange multiplier associated to the conserved u(1 ) charge , appears as an external constant zero component gauge field @xcite    this theory is @xmath0 invariant ,    @xmath13    when @xmath14 , the potential develops a new minimum , which at the tree level is given by    @xmath15    being the phase @xmath16 unspecified .",
    "the generator for a symmetry transformation is @xmath17 , where q is the well known conserved charge ,    @xmath18.\\ ] ]    in this way , for an arbitrary operator f dependent on @xmath19 and the canonical momenta we have    @xmath20.\\ ] ]    notice that if @xmath21 , the exponentiation of the previous relation , gives in fact the transformed field according to eq .",
    "( [ nu_gau_trans ] ) .",
    "it is natural to demand that when @xmath22 , @xmath23 , ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "the @xmath25 s that obey such condition define the so called physical transformation group @xmath26 .",
    "following @xcite we introduce a correction to the thooft @xmath27 gauge for a theory with finite @xmath1 and spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "thus we set ,    @xmath28    this gauge fixing allows us to calculate explicitly all the contributions to the one loop efective potential , cancelling the unphysical coupling of the scalar and gauge fields .",
    "as we had noticed in @xcite the validity of the gauge fixing condition demands @xmath29 when @xmath30 in order to have a correct counting of the degrees of freedom .    however , this gauge fixing condition may have non trivial gribov copies in the broken phase , as we will see .",
    "the condition for the existence of such copies is    @xmath31    therefore we have    @xmath32    for @xmath25 real , we have ( in minkowski space - time )    @xmath33    and @xmath34    after separating the real and imaginary parts .    in the euclidean formulation ( @xmath35 ) , however , if we split the equation ( [ gauge_trans ] ) in their real and imaginary parts , we get    @xmath36    and @xmath37    where @xmath38 is the laplacian in @xmath39 dimensions .    the infinitesimal version of ( [ real_g_c_tau ] ) is given by ,    @xmath40    notice that this expression has the form of a schrdinger type equation where the field @xmath41 plays the role of a potential .",
    "once we have fixed the gauge condition ( [ gauge_cond ] ) , it is completely equivalent to consider @xmath42 or the @xmath9 field as the external potential .",
    "the condition for the existence of non trivial solutions for the gauge parameter @xmath25 , i.e. , gribov copies , is the ocurrence of a zero energy solution in equation ( [ schrodinger_nu ] ) .",
    "making the transformation @xmath43 , equation ( [ schrodinger_nu ] ) transforms into    @xmath44    this equation is completely analogous to the schrdinger equation    @xmath45    with a potential @xmath46 and energy @xmath47 .",
    "we can see that the effect of the chemical potential is to enlarge the domain of the potential fields @xmath41 , before reaching the first gribov horizon .        using the condition ( [ dtmu2 ] ) and equation ( [ real_g_c_tau ] ) , we can find an exact solution for the gauge parameter @xmath25 .",
    "@xmath48    the solution of the inhomogeneous equation ( [ exact_theta ] ) is given by    @xmath49    using spherical coordinates , it s easy to show that this integral converges only for @xmath50 .",
    "the cases @xmath51 and @xmath52 do not belong to @xmath26 . in @xmath53 ( two space and one euclidean time directions ) ,",
    "the convolution kernel is given by    @xmath54    this kernel diverges at the origin .",
    "the schrdinger operator acting on the kernel leaves a delta distribution at the origin .",
    "if we remove the origin we can find a solution for @xmath25 in the whole space @xmath55 .    the kernel given by eq ( [ exact_theta_2 ] ) does not show an explicit dependence on a winding number .",
    "however this dependence appears naturally when expanding the kernel in cylindrical coordinates around the origin .",
    "give us a mapping between the gauge group and the configuration space ]    both in the unbroken as well as the broken phase , we can see that the effect of chemical potential in the gauge fixing condition implies a bigger domain for the gauge fields before the first gribov horizon is reached , where the horizon is defined by the existence of gauge transformations which satisfy our schrdinger type equation with @xmath47 .",
    "we would like to comment about an interesting connection between  quasi \" goldstone bosons and the existence of gribov copies .",
    "in fact , if we consider e.q .",
    "( [ dtmu2 ] ) , then we see that it can be rewritten as    @xmath56    on the other side , if we use the polar decomposition for the higgs field @xmath9 , @xmath57 , we discover that    @xmath58    the previous identification allows us then to identify @xmath25 with the @xmath59 field which now propagates as a massive fields , with @xmath60 .",
    "this identification can be read from the yukawa behaviour of the convolution kernel , see eq .",
    "[ exact_theta_2 ] notice that when @xmath30 and when we decouple the gauge fields , the @xmath59 field becomes a goldstone boson .",
    "therefore , there is a link between the gauge field configuration that correspond to gribov copies and the goldstone bosons ( the corresponding theory without gauge fields ) , in the limit when @xmath30    in this context it is interesting to mention the general results about the existence of a lesser number of nambu - golstone bosons when finite density effects are considered in the breakdown of continous symmetries @xcite .",
    "here we confirm precisely this result . the @xmath59 field that would have been",
    "a goldstone boson becomes massive .",
    "in this section , we would like to discuss the interplay between temperature ( @xmath2 ) and chemical potential ( @xmath1 ) in our abelian higgs model with the gauge fixing condition given by ( [ gauge_cond ] ) .",
    "as we will see , t and @xmath1 play different roles .",
    "let us start the discussion by considering the unbroken phase , ( @xmath61 ) , with finite @xmath2 .",
    "as it is well known , the temperature appears through the kms condition which imposes a periodicity for the bosonic fields in the imaginary time direction . in this way",
    ", only the discrete matsubara frequencies appear @xmath62 .",
    "any gauge fixing condition depending on the euclidean time @xmath63 , can be expanded as a fourier series    @xmath64    notice that we have an explicit dependence on the winding number on this case , due to the compactification of time .",
    "the gauge fixing condition @xmath65 implies    @xmath66    a radial solution for the homogeneous equation will have the form    @xmath67    where @xmath68 and @xmath69 satisfy @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "the first relation obviously implies the realization @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "this fact reminds us the quasiparticles , according to the bogoliubov theory of interacting bosons at low densities @xcite , where also nontrivial dispersion relations associated to quasiparticles appear .",
    "the solution is the following    @xmath74    then we have for @xmath25    @xmath75    these sums will converge when @xmath76 .    in the limit of @xmath77 , we can aproximate @xmath68 and @xmath69 by    @xmath78    keeping only linear terms in @xmath1 we can perform the sum ( here @xmath79 @xmath80 @xmath81 @xmath82 ) finding an aproximate solution @xmath83 ( with an error of order @xmath84 ) for @xmath25    @xmath85}{2\\cosh{\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{\\beta}r\\right)}-2\\cos{\\frac{2\\pi}{\\beta}\\tau}}\\\\ -\\frac{\\left[\\gamma\\cos{\\left({\\mu}r-\\frac{2\\pi}{\\beta}\\tau\\right)}+\\alpha\\sin{\\left({\\mu}r-\\frac{2\\pi}{\\beta}\\tau\\right)}\\right]}{2\\cosh{\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{\\beta}r\\right)}-2\\cos{\\frac{2\\pi}{\\beta}\\tau}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    this solution is not well defined in @xmath86 , but we can use the symmetry @xmath87 of equation ( [ eq_t ] ) and construct an approximate solution finite at the origin using @xmath88 obtaining    @xmath89    our solution for @xmath90 , when @xmath1 vanishes reduces to the spherical symmetric solution obtained by harrington and shepard @xcite . however this limit does not coincide with the solution given in @xcite    @xmath91    and which is wrong , because along the plane @xmath92 does not vanish when @xmath93 .    in any case",
    ", we would like to remark that the origin @xmath94 is a singular point .",
    "however , the singular behaviour of the gauge fields at the origin does not affect the construction of mappings between the circle when @xmath95 and the gauge group .",
    "the particular solution of ( [ eq_t ] ) is given by    @xmath96",
    "the main conclusions of this article can be summarized as follows    1.- a gauge fixing condition depending on the chemical potential implies that the first gribov horizon is boosted and therefore the regular gauge configuration space becomes  bigger \" than the normal case ( @xmath97 ) .",
    "2.- the general solution for the gauge field configuration that define the first gribov horizon at finite temperature , according to equation 21 , corresponds to the homotopy group associated to the mappings between the configuration space and the gauge space u(1 ) . in the literature",
    "there was a previous discussion about gribov ambiguities at finite temperature in the abelian case @xcite .",
    "our results extend this discussion by including the chemical potential @xmath1 , which does not play a topological role , like temperature .",
    "the gauge configurations that solve our problem can be considered as quasiparticles that propagate along the radial directions with a strong damping when @xmath95 and with an oscillatory behaviour , where the frequency @xmath69 is induced by the chemical potential . from this perspective",
    ", we could say that the chemical potential conspires against the existence of field configurations belonging to the horizon .",
