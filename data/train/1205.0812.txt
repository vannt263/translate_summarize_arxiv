    "the spread of both positive and negative @xmath77 velocities observed for individual objects ( figure [ match_info_histograms_vel_egs ] ) is consistent with a global average velocity close to 0 km s@xmath1 , but the negligible blueshift of fe  ii lines in the composite spectrum may also be due to the smaller dynamic range of gas velocities probed by fe  ii than mg  ii @xcite .",
    "we discuss potential explanations for this decreased dynamic range below .",
    "outflowing galactic winds can be measured using a variety of samples : background quasars probing galactic halos along the line - of - sight , galaxy - galaxy pairs , and isolated galaxies in which the stellar disk provides a continuum for absorption by foreground interstellar gas . even considering only the last technique  which we employ in this paper",

    "s / n spectroscopy , the kinematics extracted from the centroids of absorption lines must be thought of as tracing only the gross average of multiple fronts of outflowing gas . with this limitation in mind",
    ", we now turn to a discussion of how the choice of tracer species may impact the measured properties of the outflows .",
    "absorption line studies are necessarily affected by the choice of absorption line probe .",

    "local studies typically employ na d while investigations of higher redshift populations may use transitions of si  ii , c  ii , al  ii , fe  ii , mg  ii , or mg  i in the rest - frame uv .",
    "as these species differ in abundance , ionization potential , susceptibility to emission filling , and ( perhaps ) spatial distribution , it is unsurprising that their associated outflow velocities differ as well . for instance",
    ", na d stellar absorption is known to be stronger in older stellar populations ; if the outflow and stellar components are not separated by means of modeling , the outflow velocity can be significantly underestimated and trends between galaxy properties and winds can become skewed or lost ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the different ionization energies of na  i , fe  ii , mg  ii , and mg  i ( 5.1 , 16.1 , 15.0 , and 7.6 ev , respectively ) result in these species tracing different populations of gas : na  i and mg  i , with low ionization potentials , require dense , shielded gas in order to survive while fe  ii and mg  ii are less easily ionized and therefore survive in more widespread environments .",
    "emission filling affects particular transitions of species to a differing degree depending on the relative availability and oscillator strengths of transitions decaying to excited ground states .",
    "the mg  ii doublet presents a particularly extreme case of emission filling .",
    "the doublet energy levels are such that these transitions are trapped ; the absorption of a resonance photon necessarily results in the re - emission of another resonance photon .",
    "the mg  ii doublet is therefore strongly susceptible to emission filling and measurements of the centroids of these transitions may yield different kinematic information ( i.e. , larger blueshifts ) relative to that derived from features less affected by emission filling @xcite .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are suggestive that the speed of galactic winds increases with increasing galactocentric radius .",
    "this inference that galactic winds are accelerating is consistent with recent work by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite studied a sample of ulirgs at _ z _ @xmath0 0.25 and concluded that winds are accelerating based on the assumption of a spherical outflow and measurements of how gas covering fractions vary with velocity .",
