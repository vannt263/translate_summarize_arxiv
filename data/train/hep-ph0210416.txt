    "supersymmetry is one of the most attractive extensions of the standard model .",
    "therefore the discovery of supersymmetric particles as well as the accurate measurement of their properties are among the main topics in the experimental programs for future high  energy colliders , such as lhc @xcite and prospective @xmath0 linear colliders @xcite . in this report",
    "we summarize how high  precision measurements of supersymmetric particles can be used to extract information on the underlying high scale theory at the gut / planck and to eventually reconstruct this theory @xcite .",
    "the general strategy is based on the bottom  up approach .",
    "it can be summarized shortly as follows ( see @xcite for more details ) . from a specific theory at the high scale one",
    "calculates the observables at the electroweak scale , e.g.  masses and cross sections .",
    "these observables are endowed with errors as expected at future high  energy experiments .",
    "this set of data is adopted as input and the origin of data in terms of the high scale theory is `` forgotten '' .",
    "next one extracts the parameters plus the corresponding errors at the electroweak scale from the experimental observables .",
    "these parameters are extrapolated to the high scale by means of renormalization group techniques . in this way one",
    "gains insight to which extent and with which accuracy the orginal theory can be reconstructed . in the following",
    "we exemplify this procedure by considering three examples : supergravity @xcite , gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking @xcite , and superstring effective field theories motivated by orbifold compactified heterotic string theories @xcite .",
    "supersymmetry is broken in a hidden sector in supergravity models ( sugra ) and the breaking is transmitted to our eigenworld by gravitational interactions @xcite . in this scheme",
    "it is suggestive although not compulsory that the soft susy breaking parameters are universal at the high scale , e.g.  the gut scale @xmath1 .",
    "the sugra point we have analyzed in detail , was chosen close to the snowmass point sps#1 @xcite , except for the scalar mass parameter @xmath2 which was taken slightly larger for merely illustrative purpose : @xmath3  gev , @xmath4  gev , @xmath5  gev , @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "this set of parameters is compatible with the present results of low  energy experiments .",
    "the initial `` experimental '' values , have been generated by evolving the universal parameters down to the electroweak scale according to standard procedures @xcite .",
    "these parameters define the experimental observables , including supersymmetric particle masses and production cross sections .",
    "they are endowed with errors as expected for threshold scans as well as for measurements in the continuum at @xmath0 linear colliders ( lc ) .",
    "the errors given in ref.@xcite are scaled in proportion to the masses of the spectrum .",
    "typical examples are shown in table  [ tab : masserrors ] .",
    "the lc errors on the squark masses , see _",
    "ref.@xcite , are set to an average value of 10 gev . for the cross - sections we use only statistical errors , while assuming a ( conservative ) reconstruction efficiency of 20% .",
    "these observables are interpreted as the experimental input values for the evolution of the mass parameters in the bottom - up approach to the grand unification scale .",
    ".__representative experimental mass errors used in the fits to the mass spectra ; with the exception of the gluino mass , all the other parameters are based on lc measurements .",

    "in this report we have demonstrated that fundamental parameters of the underlying supersymmetric theory at the high scale can be reconstructed in practice .",
    "the reconstruction is based on future high  precision data from @xmath0 linear colliders , tesla in particular , combined with results from lhc and clic .",
    "the bottom  up approach of evolving the parameters from the electroweak scale to the high scale provides a transparent picture of the underlying theory at the high scale .",
    "we have exemplified this conclusions in the cases of minimal supergravity theories , gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking , and for a string effective theory . in the latter example",
    "we have demonstrated that one can indeed extract the string parameters  a truly exciting observation  from future high  precision measurements at hadron and lepton  colliders .",
