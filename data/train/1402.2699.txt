    "web services ( e.g. , gmail , facebook , and online bankings ) today most commonly rely on passwords to authenticate users .",
    "unfortunately , two serious issues in this paradigm are : users will inevitably forget their passwords , and their passwords could be compromised and changed by attackers , which result in the failures to access their own accounts .    therefore , web services often provide users with backup authentication mechanisms to help users regain access to their accounts .",
    "unfortunately , current widely used backup authentication mechanisms such as security questions and alternate email addresses are insecure or unreliable or both .",
    "previous works  @xcite have shown that security questions are easily guessable and phished , and that users might forget their answers to the security questions .",
    "a previously registered alternate email address might expire upon the user s change of school or job . for the above reasons , it is important to design a secure and reliable backup authentication mechanism .",
    "recently , _",
    "trustee - based social authentication _ has attracted increasing attentions and has been shown to be a promising backup authentication mechanism  @xcite .",
    "brainard et al .",
    "@xcite first proposed trustee - based social authentication and combined it with other authenticators ( e.g. , password , security token ) as a two - factor authentication mechanism .",
    "later , trustee - based social authentication was adapted to be a backup authenticator  @xcite .",
    "in particular , schechter et al .",
    "@xcite designed and built a prototype of trusted - based social authentication system which was integrated into microsoft s windows live i d .",
    "schechter et al . found that trustee - based social authentication is highly _",
    "reliable_. moreover , facebook announced its trustee - based social authentication system called _ trusted friends _ in october , 2011  @xcite , and it was redesigned and improved to be _ trusted contacts _",
    "@xcite in may , 2013 .",
    "however , these previous work either focus on security at individual levels  @xcite or totally ignore security  @xcite .",
    "in fact , security of users are correlated in trustee - based social authentications , in contrast to traditional authenticators ( e.g. , passwords , security questions , and fingerprint ) where security of users are independent .",
    "specifically , a user s security in trustee - based social authentications relies on the security of his or her trustees ; if all trustees of a user are already compromised , then the attacker can also compromise him or her because the attacker can easily obtain the verification codes from the compromised trustees .",
    "the impact of this key difference has not been touched . moreover , none of the existing work has studied the fundamental design problems such as _ how to select trustees for users so that the system is more secure and how to set the system parameters ( e.g. , recovery threshold ) to balance between security and usability_.    * our work : *   in this paper , we aim to provide the first systematic study about the security of trustee - based social authentications . to this end",
    ", we first propose a novel framework of attacks that are based on the observation that users security are correlated in trustee - based social authentications . in these attacks ,",
    "an attacker initially obtains a small number of compromised users which we call _ seed users_. the attacker then iteratively attacks other users according to some _ priority ordering _ of them . in an _ attack trial _ to a user alice , if at least @xmath0 trustees of alice are already compromised , then the attacker can easily compromise alice ; otherwise the attacker can ( optionally ) send spoofing messages to alice s uncompromised trustees to request verification codes , and such spoofing attacks can succeed with some probability  @xcite .",
    "our attacks are similar to forest fires which start from a few points and spread among the forests .",
    "thus , we call them _ forest fire attacks_.    second , we construct a probabilistic model to formalize the threats of forest fire attacks and their costs for attackers . for each user , our model computes the _ compromise probability _ that the user is compromised after a given number of attack iterations . with those compromise probabilities ,",
    "our model calculates the _ expected number of compromised users _ and treats it as the threat .",
    "moreover , our model quantifies the costs of sending spoofing messages for attackers .",
    "third , we explore various scenarios where seed users have different properties and introduce strategies to construct priority orderings . for instance",
    ", one scenario could be that seed users happen to be appointed as trustees of a large number of users .",
    "furthermore , we discuss a few defense strategies . for example , one strategy is to guarantee that no user is appointed as a trustee of a large number of users .    * results and impact of our work : *   we apply our framework to extensively evaluate various concrete attack scenarios , defense strategies , and the impact of system parameters using three real - world social networks .",
    "first , we find that forest fire attack is a potential big threat .",
    "in particular , when all the users with at least 10 friends in these social networks adopt trustee - based social authentications , an attacker can compromise tens of thousands of users in some cases even if the number of seed users is 0 ; using a small number ( e.g. , 1,000 ) of seed users , the attacker can further compromise two to three orders of magnitude more users with low ( or even no ) costs of sending spoofing messages .",
    "second , our defense strategy , which guarantees that no users are selected as trustees by too many other users , can decrease the expected number of compromised users by one to two orders of magnitude and increase the costs for attackers by a few times in some cases .",
    "third , we find that , in contrast to existing work  @xcite where the recover threshold is set to be three , it could be set to be four to better balance between security and usability .    in summary ,",
    "our key contributions are as follows :    we propose a novel framework of attacks , which we call _ forest fire attacks_.    we construct a model to formalize the threats of forest fire attacks and their costs for attackers .",
    "moreover , we explore various attack scenarios and defense strategies .",
    "we apply our framework to extensively evaluate these attack scenarios , defense strategies , and the impact of system parameters using three real - world social networks .",
    "our results have strong implications for designing more secure trustee - based social authentications .",
    "first , we overview how a trustee - based social authentication system works .",
    "then , we introduce two basic concepts , i.e. , _ social networks _ and _ trustee networks_.      a trustee - based social authentication includes two phases :    * registration phase . *",
    "the system prepares trustees for a user alice in this phase .",
    "specifically , alice is first authenticated with her main authenticator ( i.e. , password ) , and then a few ( e.g. , 5 ) friends , who also have accounts in the system , are selected by either alice herself or the service provider from alice s friend list and are appointed as alice s trustees .    * recovery phase . *",
    "when alice forgets her password or her password was compromised and changed by an attacker , she recovers her account with the help of her trustees in this phase .",
    "specifically , alice first sends an account recovery request with her _ username _ to the service provider which then shows alice an url .",
    "alice is required to share this url with her trustees",
    ". then , her trustees authenticate themselves into the system and retrieve verification codes using the given url .",
    "alice then obtains the verification codes from her trustees via emailing them , calling them , or meeting them in person .",
    "if alice obtains a sufficient number ( e.g. , 3 ) of verification codes and presents them to the service provider , then alice is authenticated and is directed to reset her password .",
    "we call the number of verification codes required to be authenticated the _ recovery threshold_.    note that it is important for alice to know who her trustees are in the recovery phase .",
    "schechter et al .",
    "@xcite showed that users can not remember their trustees via performing user studies .",
    "thus , a usable trustee - based social authentication system should remind alice of her trustees .",
    "next , we provide details about two representative trustee - based social authentication systems which were implemented by microsoft  @xcite and facebook  @xcite , respectively .",
    "* microsoft s trustee - based social authentication : *   schechter et al .",
    "@xcite designed and built a trustee - based social authentication system and integrated it into microsoft s windows live i d service . in the registration phase ,",
    "users provide _ four _ trustees .",
    "the recovery threshold is _",
    "three_. moreover , users will be reminded of their trustees .",
    "* facebook s trustee - based social authentication : *   facebook s trustee - based social authentication system is called _ trusted friends _  @xcite , whose improved version is _ trusted contacts _  @xcite . in the registration phase of trusted contacts ,",
    "a user selects _ three to five _ friends from his or her friend list as trustees .",
    "the recovery threshold is also set to be _",
    "three_. facebook does not remind a user of his or her trustees , but it asks the user to type in the names of his or her trustees instead .",
    "however , once the user gets one trustee correctly , facebook will remind him or her of the remaining trustees .",
    "both trustee - based social authentication systems ask users to select their own trustees without any constraint . in our experiments ( i.e. , section  [ sec : eva ] ) ,",
    "we show that the service provider can constrain trustee selections via imposing that no users are selected as trustees by too many other users , which can achieve better security guarantees . moreover , none of these work performed rigorous studies to support the choice of three as the recovery threshold .",
    "in fact , our experimental results show that setting the recovery threshold to be four could better balance between security and usability .",
    "we denote a social network as @xmath1 , where each node in @xmath2 corresponds to a user in the service and an undirected edge @xmath3 represents that users @xmath4 and @xmath5 are friends .",
    "moreover , in a trustee - based social authentication system , users and their trustees form a directed network .",
    "we call this directed network a _ trustee network _ and denote it as @xmath6 , where a node in @xmath7 is a user in the service and a directed edge @xmath8 in @xmath9 means @xmath5 is a trustee of @xmath4 .",
    "one fundamental challenge in trustee - based social authentication is how to construct the trustee network from a social network so that the system is more secure .",
    "we first introduce attackers background knowledge and then a novel family of attacks which we call _ forest fire attacks_.      we assume that attackers know the trustee network in the target service .",
    "the reasonableness of this threat model is supported by two evidences .",
    "first , attackers can obtain users usernames .",
    "a username is usually a string of letters , digits , and special characters .",
    "moreover , bonneau et al .",
    "@xcite showed that a majority ( e.g. , 96% in their studies ) of websites enable attackers to probe if a string is a legitimate username .",
    "thus , strong attackers , who have enough resources ( e.g. , a botnet ) to perform username probings , can obtain all usernames in the target service .",
    "second , schechter et al .",
    "@xcite found , via performing user studies , that users can not remember their own trustees .",
    "therefore , a usable trustee - based social authentication system must remind users of their trustees . recall that an account recovery request only requires a username . as a result",
    ", an attacker could send account recovery requests with the collected usernames to the service provider which reminds the attacker of the trustees of each user .",
    "next , we take facebook as an example to show how an attacker obtains the trustee network .",
    "first , facebook provides an interface to test if a user ( represented by a username , real name , or email address ) is in facebook .",
    "thus , the attacker can perform username probings to collect facebook users .",
    "second , the attacker sends account recovery requests to facebook using the collected names .",
    "recall that facebook shows all trustees to a user once the user correctly types in one trustee .",
    "moreover , bilge et al .",
    "[ 4 ] showed that an attacker can obtain friend lists of around 90% of facebook users .",
    "thus , the attacker can repeatedly guess the trustees of a user until success .",
    "we note that facebook only allows a user to try around 10 times for typing in the trustees within a short period of time .",
    "however , such rate limit can not prevent a strong attacker from obtaining the trustee network eventually , though it can increase the attacker s cost .",
    "our forest fire attacks consist of _ ignition phase _ and _ propagation phase_. * ignition phase : *   in this phase , an attacker obtains a small number of compromised users which we call _ seed users_. they could be obtained from phishing attacks , statistical guessings , and password database leaks , or they could be a coalition of users who collude each other .",
    "indeed , a large number of social network accounts were reported to be compromised , showing the feasibility of obtaining compromised seed users .",
    "* propagation phase : *   given the seed users , the attacker iteratively attacks other users . in each",
    "_ attack iteration _ , the attacker performs one _ attack trial _ to each of the uncompromised users according to some _ attack ordering _ of them . in an attack trial to a user @xmath4 , the attacker sends an account recovery request with @xmath4 s username to the service provider , which issues different verification codes to @xmath4 s trustees .",
    "the goal of the attacker is to obtain verification codes from at least @xmath0 trustees .",
    "if at least @xmath0 trustees of @xmath4 are already compromised , the attacker can easily compromise @xmath4 ; otherwise , the attacker can impersonate @xmath4 and send a spoofing message to each uncompromised trustee of @xmath4 to request the verification code .",
    "schechter et al .",
    "@xcite found that such spoofing attacks can successfully retrieve a verification code with an average probability around 0.05 .    [",
    "cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ dataset ]    [ impact - a - both ]    * datasets : *   we use three social network datasets .",
    "they are flickr , google+ , and twitter .",
    "we obtained the flickr dataset from mislove et al .",
    "@xcite . in this social network",
    ", we take each user as a node and connect two users if they are in each other s friend lists .",
    "we obtained a google+ snapshot from gong et al .",
    "@xcite . in this social network , each node is a google+ user and two users are connected if they are in each other s circles .",
    "the twitter dataset was obtained from kwak et al .",
    "@xcite . in this social network , each node is a twitter user and two users are connected if they follow each other .    since a trustee - based social authentication requires a user to have enough number of friends from which trustees can be selected , we assume that users who have at least 10 friends are appropriate to adopt the trustee - based social authentication service . in our experiments , we consider the _ worst _ scenario in which every such user has adopted the trustee - based social authentication service .",
    "table  [ dataset ] shows the statistics of our interest in the three social networks .    for simplicity ,",
    "we only show results on the flickr dataset in some of our experiments , but similar conclusions are applicable to the other two datasets .",
    "* impact of attackers resources and attack orderings : *   the number of attack iterations is closely related to the costs of sending spoofing messages .",
    "figure  [ impact - a - both ] illustrates the expected number of compromised users ( figure  [ impact - a ] ) and the expected number of required spoofing messages ( figure  [ impact - a - cost ] ) as a function of the number of attack iterations on flickr for the ordering construction strategies o - random and o - gradient . the seed selection strategy is s - degree and the trustee selection strategy is t - cf .",
    "first , we find that a strong attacker ( e.g. , an attacker controlling a botnet ) can perform firest fire attacks with low costs .",
    "this is because such an attacker can send out billions of messages _ per day _ with a low cost  @xcite , which is far more than that needed to spoof trustees in our experiments .",
    "second , we find that the ordering construction strategy o - gradient compromises more users and requires fewer spoofing messages than o - random when the attacker performs a given number of attack iterations . in other words ,",
    "given the number of spoofing messages the attacker can send , the attacker should adopt o - gradient to construct the attack orderings .",
    "similar conclusions are applicable to other combinations of seed selection strategies and trustee selection strategies .",
    "thus , we do nt show the corresponding results for conciseness .",
    "* impact of seed users selection strategies and trustee selection strategies : *   figure  [ attack - defense ] and figure  [ attack - defense - cost ] show the expected number of compromised users and the expected number of required spoofing messages respectively for different seed selection strategies and trustee selection strategies .",
    "we can draw a few conclusions .",
    "first , we find that forest fire attack is a potential big threat .",
    "for instance , when the seed users are appointed as trustees of many users ( i.e. , s - degree ) and the trustees are selected by t - cf , the attacker can compromise around 190,000 , 660,000 , and 3,760,000 users in the three social networks , respectively .",
    "this represents a growth of two to three orders of magnitude from the 1,000 seed users .",
    "however , our strategy t - degree can decrease the expected number of compromised users by one to two orders of magnitude .",
    "for instance , the expected number of compromised users of t - degree is 53 times smaller than that of t - cf on twitter when the seed users selection strategy is s - degree .",
    "moreover , our strategy t - degree can increase the costs for attackers by a few times in some cases .",
    "for instance , the cost of sending spoofing messages of t - degree is 3 times bigger than that of t - cf and that of t - aa on flickr when the seed users are appointed as trustees of many users .",
    "the reason is that the trustee networks constructed by t - degree are more loosely connected , which makes it harder for forest fire attacks to propagate among them .",
    "second , even if the seed users are distributed among a social network uniformly at random ( i.e. , s - random ) , the attacker can still compromise dozens of times more users .",
    "for instance , the attacker can still compromise 65 to 80 times more users in twitter depending on how trustees are selected .",
    "third , t - jc works better than t - aa which performs better than t - cf for all seed users selection strategies except s - random .",
    "we find that the outdegree distributions of the trustee networks constructed by t - cf are skewed towards high degrees the most while those constructed by t - jc are skewed towards low degrees the most .",
    "thus , the seed users in the trustee networks constructed by t - jc have lower outdegrees than those constructed by t - aa , which have lower outdegrees than those constructed by t - cf . as a result",
    ", t - jc performs better than t - aa and t - aa performs better than t - cf .",
    "* impact of spoofing attacks : *   the attacker can choose not to send any spoofing message , which requires no costs of sending spoofing messages",
    ". moreover , spoofing probabilities might decrease as the attacker performs more attack iterations because trustees become aware of the spoofing attacks , and we consider an extreme case where spoofing probabilities are zero in all attack iterations .",
    "that spoofing probabilities are zero is equivalent to that the attacker does not use spoofing attacks in terms of the number of compromised users .",
    "figure  [ optional - spoofing - attacks ] shows the ratios between the expected number of users that are compromised without spoofing attacks and those with spoofing attacks for different seed users selection strategies and trustee selection strategies on flickr .",
    "we find that , without spoofing attacks , the expected number of compromised users only decreases by 20% to 25% when the trustee selection strategy is t - cf or t - aa and the seed users selection strategy is not s - random , which means that the attacker can still compromise orders of magnitude more users and that spoofing attacks are optional in some cases .",
    "* impact of * @xmath10 , @xmath0 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 * : *   towards this end , we assume that the attacker and the defender are making their best choices , i.e. , the seed selection strategy is s - degree and the trustee selection strategy is t - degree . for simplicity , we assume @xmath14 for all users @xmath4 who adopt the trustee - based social authentication service and @xmath15 for all edges @xmath8 in the trustee network and attack iterations",
    ". moreover , we consider zeroth - order approximation of recovery probabilities , i.e. , we use the average recover probability to approximate recover probabilities of all users in different attack iterations .",
    "in other words , @xmath16 for all users and attack iterations .",
    "@xmath17 represents the average fraction of compromised users that realize their accounts are compromised and take actions to recover them in each attack iteration .",
    "figure  [ phase_transition ] shows the impact of @xmath18 , @xmath0 , @xmath19 , @xmath12 , and @xmath17 .",
    "note that the x - axis in figure  [ impact - ns ] is the percentage of users that adopt the trustee - based social authentication service .",
    "we have a few observations .    naturally , we observe that the expected number of compromised users decreases with @xmath0 and @xmath17 , and it increases with @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath12 . moreover , the trends are _ qualitatively _ similar on the three social networks for each of the five parameters , which indicates the generality of our results .    the parameters @xmath18 and @xmath0 balance between security and usability .",
    "specifically , a smaller @xmath18 or a bigger @xmath0 makes the system more secure but less usable .",
    "figure  [ impact - k ] shows that the expected number of compromised users decreases dramatically when @xmath0 increases from 1 to 4 .",
    "for instance , the expected number of compromised users decreases by around one order when @xmath0 changes from 3 to 4 .",
    "however , the decrease is not significant when @xmath0 increases from 4 to 5 .",
    "existing trustee - based social authentication systems  @xcite set @xmath0 to be 3 ; our observations indicate that they could set @xmath0 to be 4 to better balance between security and usability .",
    "we find that the expected number of compromised users changes dramatically when @xmath19 is around 0.2 on all the three social networks .",
    "moreover , almost all users that have adopted the trustee - based social authentication service are compromised when @xmath19 is bigger than around 0.3 .",
    "our results imply that it is urgent to mitigate the spoofing attacks via designing better user interfaces to remind users of not easily sharing the verification codes to others via messages .",
    "the expected number of compromised users increases dramatically with @xmath12 in the range where @xmath12 is small .",
    "this implies that obtaining a few more seed users enables the attacker to compromise significantly more users when the number of seed users is small .",
    "moreover , even if the number of seed users is 0 , the attacker can still compromise thousands of nodes in flickr and tens of thousands of nodes in google+ and twitter .",
    "the expected number of compromised users significantly decreases with @xmath17 .",
    "for instance , the number of compromised users decreases by one order in all the three social networks when around 40% of compromised users recover to be uncompromised in each attack iteration ( i.e. , @xmath20 ) .",
    "our results imply that it is important for users to take actions to recover their accounts quickly when suspicious activities of their accounts are detected .",
    "* a greedy seed users selection strategy : *   an attacker could use a greedy strategy to select seed users . specifically , the attacker selects seed users one by one . to select a seed user ,",
    "the attacker iterates over each user that is not a seed user yet ; for each such user @xmath4 , the attacker pretends that @xmath4 is a seed user and simulates our security model to predict the corresponding expected number of compromised users ; and the user @xmath4 which increases the expected number of compromised users by the most is added as a new seed user .",
    "we compared this greedy strategy with other seed users selection strategies using a small subnetwork sampled from the google+ dataset and found that it can compromise more users .",
    "however , it is not scalable to large social networks .",
    "it is an interesting future work to make the strategy scalable .",
    "* community - based trustee selection strategy : *   we can also design a trustee selection strategy based on some notion of community . specifically , we could select trustees for users such that the trustee network consists of isolated communities , which could constrain the propagation of forest fire attacks .",
    "it is an interesting future work to explore these community - based trustee selection strategies .    * limiting the issuance of verification codes : *",
    "a compromised user @xmath4 might request a verification code from the service provider when the attacker performs an attack trial to a user who selects @xmath4 as a trustee .",
    "thus , a compromised user who is a trustee of many other users might request many verification codes in each attack iteration .",
    "therefore , limiting the number of verification codes that each user can request within a given period of time ( e.g. , one hour ) can slow down forest fire attacks .",
    "it is an interesting future work to explore the impact of such rate limitings on forest fire attacks and what strategies attackers can adopt to maximize the number of compromised users given a time constraint .",

    "_ independent cascade model : _ different from the linear threshold model , the independent cascade model proceeds in discrete iterations according to the following randomized rule : when a node @xmath4 first becomes active in the @xmath23th iteration , it has a _ single _ chance to activate each of its currently inactive friend @xmath5 and succeed with some probability which encodes the influence of @xmath4 to @xmath5 .",
    "the key difference is that verification codes can be propagated from an uncompromised ( i.e. , inactive ) node to another uncompromised node via spoofing attacks in forest fire attacks while an inactive node can only be activated by active nodes in the linear threshold model and the independent cascade model .",

    ", @xmath4 has some probability of passing the disease to each of its susceptible neighbors .",
    "after @xmath24 iterations , @xmath4 becomes removed , which means that @xmath4 can not catch nor propagate the disease any more .",
    "again , a susceptible ( i.e. , uncompromised ) node can only be influenced by infectious ( i.e. , compromised ) nodes in the sir model , which is different from the forest fire attacks .",
    "moreover , the state _ removed _ is not meaningful in the context of forest fire attacks since a node could be compromised again even if it recovers the account and resets the password .",
    "* summary : *   the key difference between forest fire attacks and previous diffusion models lies in the spoofing attacks .",
    "specifically , an uncompromised node can obtain verification codes from its uncompromised trustees via spoofing attacks in the forest fire attacks while an inactive or susceptible node can only be influenced by its active or infectious neighbors in previous diffusion models .",
    "in this paper , we provide the first systematic study about the security of trustee - based social authentications .",
    "first , we introduce _ forest fire attacks_. in these attacks , an attacker first obtains a small number of compromised seed users and then iteratively attacks the rest of users according to a priority ordering of them .",
    "second , we construct a probabilistic model to formalize the threats of forest fire attacks and their costs for attackers .",
    "third , we introduce a few strategies to select seed users and construct priority orderings , and we discuss various defense strategies .",
    "fourth , via extensive evaluations using three real - world social network datasets , we find that forest fire attack is a potential big threat .",
    "for instance , with a small number ( e.g. , 1,000 ) of seed users , an attacker can further compromise two to three orders of magnitude more users in some scenarios with low ( or even no ) costs of sending spoofing messages .",
    "however , our defense strategy , which guarantees that no users are trustees of too many other users , can decrease the number of compromised users by one to two orders of magnitude and increase the costs for attackers by a few times in some cases .",
    "moreover , the recovery threshold should be set to be 4 to better balance between security and usability .",
    "a few future directions include evaluating forest firest attacks on real social authentication systems such as facebook s trusted contacts , designing new attack and defense strategies , and optimizing forest fire attacks given a time constraint .",
