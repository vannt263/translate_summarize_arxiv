    "in the quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) there is a very fruitful analogy between superconductivity and qcd : according to the t hooft and mandelstam assumption @xcite , @xcite a confinement in the qcd is similar to the dual meissner effect in a superconductor .",
    "such confinement scenario assumes that the ground state of qcd is a condensate of magnetic monopoles which one confines ( pinches ) the color electric field of color charges into flux tubes .",
    "in other words , the magnetic charges , defined as the dirac monopoles in ground state of qcd , should condense in the vacuum in just the same way as the cooper pair in a superconductor .",
    "this analogy works in the direction : _ * superconductivity @xmath1 quantum chromodynamics . *",
    "_    an analogy can be offered in the opposite direction : from the qcd to the high - t@xmath0 superconductivity by the following manner .",
    "an interaction between gluons exists in the qcd and it is so strong that the force lines of color gauge field are stretched into a flux tube between quark and antiquark .",
    "the most important in this picture is the strong interaction between gluons .",
    "this one distinguishes the quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) from the quantum chromodynamics : qed does not have the photon - photon interaction .",
    "thus , our basic assumption is that _ * in the high - t@xmath0 superconductor there is a strong phonon - phonon interaction*_. we assume that the jump from the ordinary superconductivity to high - t@xmath0 one is analogous to the jump from qed to qcd .",
    "@xmath2    the consequence of such conjectural analogy is that the interaction between phonons is so strong that _ the phonons between the cooper pair are confined into a phonon tube ( pt ) _",
    "@xcite .",
    "the phonon hamiltonian @xmath3 in the continuum limit we can write as follows @xmath4 ,   \\label{1 - 1}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 is the mass density , @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) is the ion deviation from the equilibrium state , @xmath8 is the potential energy , @xmath9 are some coefficients .",
    "our assumption indicates that the potential term @xmath8 in the high - t@xmath0 superconductor can not be simplified as @xmath10 even though for the small deviations @xmath11 .",
    "the same takes place in the qcd with lagrangian @xmath12 here @xmath13 ; @xmath14 ; @xmath15 is the su(3 ) gauge potential ; @xmath16 are the structural constants of the su(3 ) gauge group ; @xmath17 are the color indexes .",
    "it is easy to see that in this qcd lagrangian we have @xmath18 and @xmath19 terms .",
    "the most important is that coupling constant @xmath20 is not small , _",
    "i.e. _ in contrast with qed we have a very strong interaction between gluons that probably leads to the appearance of a nonlocal object - flux tube stretched between quark and antiquark .",
    "the basic idea of bcs theory is that in the presence of even a weak interaction between electrons they cooperate in the cooper pairs that leads to decreasing the ground state energy of superconductor in comparison with the normal state .",
    "according to the above - mentioned assumption about the possible analogy with the qcd we suppose    * there is a strong interaction between phonons ( nonlinear potential term in ( [ 1 - 1 ] ) expression ) which leads to appearing of a tube filled by phonons ( like the flux tube filled by chromodynamical color fields in the qcd ) .",
    "we can name such tube as the pt .",
    "* in the first approximation , neglecting by cross section of the pt , such object is like a string .",
    "analogously to the qcd in the first rough approximation the pt in the high - t@xmath0 superconductor can be considered as a string . * as in the qcd we assume that the interaction between cooper electrons is described by the nonrelativistic string potential @xmath21 where @xmath8 is the potential energy of the phonon interaction between cooper electrons , @xmath22 is a coefficient and @xmath23 is a length of the string .    in this model",
    "the cooper pair is modeled as a string with two cooper electrons attached at its ends . in the qcd",
    "such construction is a string with quark and antiquark at the ends .",
    "the interaction quark - antiquark is so strong that we have confinement : if we increase the string length then in some moment the string is torn and again we will have the quark - antiquark pair , _",
    "i.e. _ we can not obtain a single quark . by applying such model to the high - t@xmath0 superconductivity",
    "we should be delicate : certainly a single electron exists but the basic idea is the same : the string interaction leads to an essential increase of the binding energy of the cooper pair .",
    "now we would like to repeat the calculations in the microscopic bcs theory with the potential ( [ 2 - 1 ] ) ( following , for example , to ref .",
    "@xcite ) . let us assume that @xmath24 is a quantum amplitude that the cooper pair is unoccupied and @xmath25 that it is occupied , then the wave function is @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the probability that the cooper pair @xmath28 , @xmath29 is unoccupied and accordingly @xmath30 is the probability that it is occupied ; @xmath31 is the wave vector .",
    "we have the normalization condition @xmath32 the normal ground state is given by @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the fermi wave vector .",
    "the energy of ground state is calculated by the variational method @xmath35 with the constraint @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the number operator and @xmath38 is the mean number of particles in this system , @xmath39 is the fermi energy .",
    "the calculation for kinetic energy term @xmath40 gives us @xmath41 where the single particle energies @xmath42 are measured from the fermi surface @xmath43 , the factor 2 appears as @xmath30 is the occupation probability for the cooper pair .",
    "the expectation value of the potential energy part is @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the amplitude for the initial state in which the cooper pair @xmath31 is occupied and pair @xmath46 in unoccupied ; @xmath47 is the amplitude for the final state in which the reverse is true .",
    "thus we have @xmath48 as usual , we minimize this functional with respect to @xmath49 that leads to the equation @xmath50 where @xmath51 as usual we simplify @xmath52 here @xmath53 is the debye energy of phonons .",
    "now we can include our string assumption : we suppose that @xmath8 in the ( [ 2 - 14 ] ) expression is @xmath54 where @xmath22 is some constant , @xmath23 is the length of cooper pair ( length of the string ) .    as usual",
    "the further calculations give us @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the density of states in energy at the fermi surface .",
    "we can hope that in the high - t@xmath0 superconductor the quantity @xmath8 in the ( [ 2 - 16 ] ) expression will be much more than the corresponding quantity in the ordinary superconductors @xmath57 as it takes place in the qcd : the strong interaction between quarks is much more than the electromagnetic one between electrons ( positrons ) . in the qcd",
    "the interaction between gluons is so strong that the force lines are confined into the flux tube stretched between quark and antiquark .",
    "the greatest difficulty here is the microscopical calculation of the quantity @xmath8 .",
    "this difficulty is connected with the presence of the nonlinear potential term in the hamiltonian .",
    "this means that in the presence of the strong self - interaction between phonons the expression for the exchange of one phonon between two electrons ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) @xmath58 now is not correct .",
    "the same problem exists in the qcd : now we can not deduce the existence of the flux tube ( string in the first rough approximation ) from the su(3 ) lagrangian .",
    "this problem is connected with that we do not have appropriate mathematical tools in the nonperturbative qcd , _",
    "i.e. _ without the feynman diagram techniques",
    ".    one of the first attempts of nonperturbative calculations in the qcd was a veneziano amplitude @xcite ( see fig.[fig2 ] ) @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the mandelstam variables ; @xmath62 is the gamma function ; @xmath63 ; @xmath64 and @xmath65 are some constants .",
    "this approach has not resulted in a great success in the qcd as this amplitude is some rough approximation for the correct 4-point green s function .",
    "it is possible to assume that such approximation can be made in the superconductivity theory : the scattering amplitude of two electrons @xmath66 is the veneziano amplitude .",
    "certainly ( just as in qcd ) it is a rough approximation for the correct green s function .    we can try to obtain an expression for @xmath8 on the basis of the dimensional reasons .",
    "the result , for example , can be @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the cross section of the pt . if we suppose that the pt is located inside of a layer of an anisotropical superconductor then @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the thickness of the layer . in this case",
    "these expressions will be @xmath71 because of @xmath72 we have @xmath73 .",
    "what is the physical meaning of the pt ? in the qcd the flux tube is filled with the color field which is parallel to the tube axis and equal to zero outside this tube . in our case",
    "we can suppose that there can be one from the following possibilities @xmath74 the first possibility @xmath75 means that the nonzero static deviation of the ion lattice exists only inside pt .",
    "the second one @xmath76 means that the nonzero mean square of the deviation exists only inside pt only and so on .",
    "a possible strong phonon - phonon interaction can obstruct the application of feynman diagram techniques in our case .",
    "some time ago w. heisenberg had conceived of the difficulties in applying an expansion in small parameters to quantum field theories having strong interactions .",
    "he had investigated the dirac equation with nonlinear terms ( heisenberg equation ) ( see , for example , ref s @xcite - @xcite ) . in these papers",
    "he repeatedly underscored that a nonlinear theory with a large parameter _ * requires the introduction of another quantization rule .",
    "* _ he worked out a quantization method for strong nonlinear field unusing the expansion in a small parameter .",
    "it is possible that in the high - t@xmath0 superconductivity the interaction between phonons is strong making it necessary take into account the interaction between phonons to correctly calculate the energy of the cooper pairs .",
    "heisenberg s basic idea proceeds from the fact that the n - point green functions must be found from some infinity differential equations system derived from the field equation for the field operator .",
    "for example , we present heisenberg quantization for nonlinear spinor field .",
    "the basic equation ( heisenberg equation ) has the following form : @xmath77 = 0 , \\label{a1}\\ ] ] where @xmath78 are dirac matrices ; @xmath79 is the field operator ; @xmath80 is the dirac adjoint spinor ; @xmath81=   \\hat\\psi ( \\hat{\\bar\\psi }   \\hat\\psi)$ ] or @xmath82 or @xmath83 or @xmath84 .",
    "heisenberg emphasizes that the 2-point green function @xmath85 in this theory differs strongly from the propagator in linear theory .",
    "this difference lies in its behaviour on the light cone .",
    "@xmath85 oscillates strongly on the light cone in contrast to the propagator of the linear theory which has a @xmath70-like singularity .",
    "then heisenberg introduces the @xmath86 functions : @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the time ordering operator .",
    "@xmath89 is a system state characterized by the fundamental eq .",
    "( [ a1 ] ) .",
    "relationship ( [ a2 ] ) allows us to establish a one - to - one correspondence between the system state @xmath89 and the function set @xmath86 .",
    "this state can be defined using the infinite function set of ( [ a2 ] ) .",
    "applying heisenberg s equation ( [ a1 ] ) to ( [ a2 ] ) we can obtain the following infinite equations system : @xmath90 + \\nonumber \\\\ \\delta ( { \\bf x}_r - { \\bf y}_1 ) \\tau   \\left ( { \\bf x}_1\\ldots { \\bf x}_{r-1}{\\bf x}_{r+1}\\ldots { \\bf x}_n| { \\bf y}_2\\ldots { \\bf y}_{r-1}{\\bf y}_{r+1}\\ldots { \\bf y}_n\\right ) + \\nonumber \\\\ \\delta ( { \\bf x}_r - { \\bf y}_2 ) \\tau \\left ( { \\bf x}_1 \\ldots { \\bf x}_{r-1}{\\bf x}_{r+1}\\ldots { \\bf x}_n| { \\bf y}_1{\\bf y}_2\\ldots { \\bf y}_{r-1 } { \\bf y}_{r+1}\\ldots { \\bf y}_n\\right ) + \\ldots . \\label{a3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] heisenberg then employs the tamm - dankoff method for getting approximate solutions to the infinite equations system of ( [ a3 ] ) .",
    "the key to this method lies in the fact that the system of equation has an approximate solution derived after cutting off the infinite equation system ( [ a3 ] ) to a finite equation system .",
    "it is necessary to note that a method of solution to eq .",
    "( [ a3 ] ) can be various .",
    "for example , we can try to determine the green s functions using the numerical lattice calculations . here",
    "the important point is the following : the technique of expansion in small parameters ( feynman diagrams ) can not be employed for strong nonlinear fields .",
    "it is possible that as in quantum chromodynamics , where quarks are thought to interact strongly by means of flux tubes , so too in high - t@xmath0 superconductivity phonons may strongly interact among themselves .    in ref .",
    "@xcite such a mechanism is applied for the qcd . in this paper",
    "we apply a variant of heisenberg s quantization method to solutions of the classical su(3 ) yang - mills field equations which have bad asymptotic behavior .",
    "after quantization it has been found that the bad features ( _ i.e. _ divergent fields and energy densities ) of these solutions are moderated . from these results",
    "is argued that in general the n - point green s functions for yang - mills theories can have nonperturbative pieces which can not be represented as the sum of feynman diagrams .    in heisenberg",
    "s theory the matter and the interacting fields are identical : fundamental spinor field @xmath91 . from a more recent perspective",
    "this is not the case .",
    "an interaction is carried by some kind of boson field . in superconductivity",
    "this is the phonons , in quantum chromodynamics it is the nonabelian @xmath92 gauge field - gluons .    in conclusion of this section",
    "we emphasize again heisenberg s statement that _ * the perturbation theory is inapplicable to strong nonlinear fields . * _",
    "thus , the basic assumption supposed here is the following : * _ the energy of cooper pair has an essential contribution coming from an interaction of phonons_*. this means that the corresponding sound wave is a nonlinear wave .      in this subsection",
    "we would like to show that heisenberg idea about quantization of strongly interacting fields in fact had been applied in the superconductivity theory for definition of green s function . here",
    "we would like to show that the calculations which was made in ref .",
    "@xcite is an application of the heisenberg quantization idea . in this section",
    "we follow to ref.@xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system electrons describing the properties of a metal in the superconductivity state is @xmath93 d v , \\label{green1}\\ ] ] where @xmath94 is the operator of spinor field describing electrons , @xmath95 is the electron mass , @xmath96 is some constant and @xmath97 are the spinor indexes . as usually ( it is the same as heisenberg equation for nonlinear spinor field ) the operators @xmath98 and @xmath99 obey the following operator equations @xmath100 as well as in heisenberg method for nonlinear spinor field we have an equation for the 2-point green s function @xmath101 @xmath102 further we have to write an equation for term @xmath103 and so on .",
    "after this we will have an infinite set for green s function .",
    "the main problem here is : how can we cut off this infinite equation system ?",
    "let us cite ref.@xcite : `` @xmath104 for interacting particles , the product of four @xmath98-operators can be expressed in terms of the vertex part , _",
    "i.e. _ it already includes the contributions from various scattering processes . in the weak - interaction model under consideration , these scattering processes involving collisions of particles can be neglected , but at the same time , it must be borne in mind that the ground state of the system differs from the usual state with a filled fermi sphere , because of the presence of bound pairs of electrons .",
    "@xmath104 '' .",
    "this means that in the textbook @xcite it was made the following approximation : the operators @xmath105 and @xmath106 contain terms corresponding to the annihilation and creation of bound pairs ( cooper pairs ) .",
    "it allows to state @xmath107 where @xmath108 and @xmath109 are ground states of system with @xmath38 and @xmath110 particles ( cooper pairs ) , respectively . we should note that this expression is approximate one and following to heisenberg idea it allows us to cut off the above - mentioned infinite equation set for green s function .",
    "the key role here plays the last term in expression .",
    "this expression allows us to split the 4-point green s function with the nonperturbative way not using feynman diagram techniques .",
    "eq . means that we have neglected all effects of scattering particles by each other and the presence of the interaction has been taken into account only as leading to the formation of bound pairs . the third term in the right - hand side of eq .",
    "has been written in complete analogy with the case of a bose gas in the correspondence with the fact that all bound pairs ( cooper pairs ) are `` condensed on the lowest level '' .",
    "the quantity @xmath111 obviously has the same order of magnitude as the density of pairs .",
    "we can introduce the following functions @xmath112 where @xmath39 is a chemical potential .",
    "we now substitute into the equation for the green s function .",
    "we can everywhere omit the first two terms in the right - hand side of since they lead to an additive correction to the chemical potential in the equations for the functions @xmath113 . as a result",
    "we obtain the following equation connecting @xmath114 and @xmath115 : @xmath116 the quantity @xmath117 is defined as @xmath118 an equation for @xmath119 can be obtained in a similar way by using the equation @xmath120 analogously to eq .",
    "we have @xmath121 now we have eq s . and as the finite set of equations for the 2-point green s functions @xmath114 and @xmath122 .",
    "thus , above - mentioned reasonings should convince us that _ * this green s function method in the superconductivity theory is a realization of heisenberg idea developed by him for the quantization of non - linear spinor field .",
    "* _      in this subsection we would like to consider a possibility for the phonons to form a static configuration .",
    "let us write again the lagrangian ( [ 1 - 1 ] ) for phonons in continuous limit @xmath123 . \\label{d1}\\ ] ] thus , in this model it is assumed that operators of strong nonlinear fiels @xmath11 must satisfy the following equation ( which is implied from the lagrangian ( [ d1 ] ) ) : @xmath124 the multitime formalism of heisenberg s method ( when in @xmath125 ) allows us to investigate the scattering processes in quantum theory .",
    "the simultaneous formalism ( when @xmath126 ) allows us to calculate the mean value of the field , the energy , or any combination of field powers .",
    "let us consider , for example , the simplest case of the scalar field when the vector @xmath127 is replaced by the scalar field @xmath128 .",
    "in this case the lagrangian is @xmath129   \\label{d3 - 1}\\ ] ] where @xmath130 and the potential term @xmath131 the classical field equation is @xmath132 the quantization of ( [ d3 - 2 ] ) equation gives us @xmath133 it is easy to see that the mean value @xmath134 satisfies the following equation : @xmath135 for the definition of @xmath136 we turn to eq.([d3 - 3 ] ) and obtain ( @xmath137 ) in heisenberg s notation ) : @xmath138 here @xmath139 .",
    "analogously it can be used to derive the infinite equation system for calculating @xmath140 . in the first approximation",
    "we can solve this equation system using the following assumption : @xmath141 and then we can derive the equation @xmath142 this equation is very interesting for us . derrick s",
    "theorem @xcite states that eq . has a static solution with the finite energy only in two dimensional spacetime @xmath143 .",
    "this solution is @xmath144   \\label{d5 - 2}\\ ] ] where @xmath145 and @xmath146 are some constants .",
    "the first assumption is that such solution can be realized on the layer of high - t@xmath0 superconductor as a line ( wall ) separating regions with different vacua ( @xmath147 ) .",
    "the existence of regions with different vacua can have very interesting physical consequences for a distribution of free electrons in the ion lattice .",
    "following ref.@xcite we present a model example of a fermion coupled to solution .",
    "let we have 2-dimensional dirac equation @xmath148 where @xmath149 is the two - component spinor ; @xmath20 is the coupling constant ; @xmath150 is the soliton ; @xmath151 are the dirac matrices , which we can choose to be the pauli matrices @xmath152 now we search a static solution of dirac equation in the presence of the soliton @xmath153 here we consider case with energy @xmath154 . in this case",
    "we have the following normalizable zero mode @xmath155 \\right \\}^{-2m / m_\\psi } \\dbinom{1}{1 } \\label{d5 - 5}\\ ] ] where @xmath156 .",
    "we see that it is strongly localized at the position @xmath146 of the soliton ( see , fig.[fig3 ] ) . in the context of mechanism with different vacua",
    "this toy model can mean that the free electrons on the layer of the high - t@xmath0 superconductor will be located on the boundaries between regions with different vacua .",
    "evidently , the appearance of localized solutions is connected with the presence of two vacuums ( @xmath147 ) .",
    "it allows us to assume that the mechanism offered here for the formation of cooper pair in high-@xmath157 superconductivity depends on the existence of several vacuums for phonon field , _ i.e. _ on the presence of several equilibrium states ( stable and unstable ) for ions of the lattice .",
    "such interpretation depends on the existence of different vacua .",
    "thus , this mechanism takes place only in the presence of different equilibrium states for ions of the lattice .",
    "it is necessary to note that can exist other mechanism of the field localization in some region .",
    "it is possible , for example , that such mechanism ( without different vacua of gauge field ) occurs in qcd by forming a hypothesized flux tube between quark - antiquark .",
    "another possibility can be connected with cut - in of an external gauge field . in the ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that the scalar field coupled with the electromagnetic field can forms the flux tube ( nielsen - olesen flux tube ) .",
    "the detailed investigation of such possibility in the context of the gingbug - landau theory is given in ref.@xcite .",
    "it should be pointed out that the investigation of @xmath158 gives us the information about the mean value of the field @xmath159 . for the investigation of questions on the scattering or interaction of phonons",
    "it is necessary to explore the functions , @xmath160 .",
    "how can this string model for the cooper pair in the high - t@xmath0 superconductor be proved ?",
    "the best way is the direct observation of the pt between cooper electrons .",
    "evidently it should be connected with the detection of the ion lattice between cooper electrons . if we can establish that @xmath161 inside of the tube and @xmath162 outside of the pt then probably it will indicate the existence of the pt .",
    "certainly , such measurements of the state of ion lattice are very difficult .",
    "another indirect way is a test for the nonlinear potential @xmath163 .",
    "the presence of such nonlinear term can lead to : ( a ) the nonlinear effects by propagation of the sound wave in the high  -  t@xmath0 superconductor along the layer ; ( b ) the different equilibrium states of ions in the lattice . such effects can be : ( a ) nonlinear scattering , propagation , absorption and so on for the sound waves ; ( b ) appearance of regions with different vacua . certainly , the presence of such kind of nonlinear effects is not the direct demonstration of the pt but it can indicate the important role of the strong phonon - phonon interaction in the high - t@xmath0 superconductor .",
    "the basic goal of this paper is an assumption that the quantum solid theory with the strong nonlinear interaction of ions in the lattice can be similar to the qcd in which there is the strong gluon - gluon interaction .",
    "such similarity can lead to the appearance of nonlocal objects in the quantum solid theory like the flux tube in the qcd .",
    "it is possible that such a mechanism is realized in the high-@xmath157 superconductor by such a way that the phonons are confined into a nonlocal object ( tube ) located between two cooper electrons .    in this paper",
    "we have considered only one mechanism probably leading in emergence the pt .",
    "the problem on existence of other alternative such mechanisms was not discussed in this paper and remains while open .",
    "it is very important to note that our analysis shows that the green s function method in the superconductivity theory is a realization of an algorithm proposed by heisenberg for quantization of nonlinear spinor field .",
    "we have shown that green s function method is such realization of discussed heisenberg idea .",
    "we would like to emphasize that the nonperturbative heisenberg quantization method is much more powerful than a perturbative feynman diagram techniques .",
    "finally , we can presuppose that in the quantum field theory * _ nonlinearity can lead to nonlocality _ * : nonlinear terms @xmath18 and @xmath19 in the qcd lead to the flux tube and probably such a mechanism in the high - t@xmath0 superconductivity leads to the pt .",
