    "the ads / cft conjecture or its stronger version gauge / gravity duality provides a new framework to holographic study of quantum field theory in the nonperturbative regime . according to this duality , the einstein gravity in the bulk spacetime corresponds to a gauge theory with a large number of colors @xmath0 and large t hoof coupling @xmath1 living on the boundary . indeed in principle",
    ", one can use the dictionary of duality and obtain information on one side by performing computation on the other side @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been shown that one can describe strongly coupling phenomena in qcd , condense matter physics and superconductivity by performing gravity calculations .",
    "for an interesting review on application in the condense matter physics , see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the gauge / gravity duality for einstein gravity with a two - derivative bulk action only works for large @xmath0 and large @xmath1 limit . on the other hand ,",
    "the coupling constants in the gravity side relate to central charges in the field theory .",
    "thus , einstein gravity does not have enough free parameters to account for the ratios between central charges and therefore it is only dual to those conformal field theories for which all the central charges are equal . in order to extend the regime of validity to the case of finite @xmath1 and finite @xmath0 , or field theories with different ratios between central charges",
    ", one should add higher curvature terms or higher derivative terms with more coupling constants within a perturbative framework to action @xcite .",
    "the first - step generalization is to add the gauss - bonnet term to the gravity action .",
    "but the gauss - bonnet gravity has only one such a coupling constant so the range of its dual theories is limited . in order to extend the duality to new classes of field theories",
    ", one can consider terms with higher order curvature interactions such as the third order lovelock term @xcite . although the equations of motion of third order lovelock gravity are second - order differential equations , the third order lovelock term has no contribution to the field equation in six or lower dimensional spacetime and therefore it is useless for studying field theories in four dimensions .",
    "recently , a new toy model for gravitation action has been proposed which includes cubic curvature interactions and has contribution in five dimensions @xcite .",
    "the equations of motion of this theory are second - order differential equations when the metric is spherically symmetry . as in the case of third order lovelock gravity ,",
    "the cubic term vanishes in six dimensions .",
    "although this property of lovelock gravity is due to a topological origin of euler density in six dimensions , this property of the new theory does not have a topological origin @xcite .",
    "hence , this theory is known as quasitopological gravity . the black hole solutions and holography study of this toy model",
    "have been investigated in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it is known that the einstein - hilbert action does not have a well - defined variational principle , since one encounters a total derivative that produces a surface integral involving the derivative of the variation of the metric normal to the boundary . to cancel this normal derivative terms",
    "one has to add a surface term to action @xcite .",
    "also in the framework of the path integral formalism of quantum gravity , the necessity of adding the surface term has been emphasized @xcite .",
    "furthermore , surface terms should be known when one likes to study the general relativity in the hamiltonian framework @xcite .",
    "these reasons provide a strong motivation for introducing the surface terms in higher curvature gravity such as lovelock gravity or quasitopological gravity .",
    "the suitable surface term for lovelock gravity in all orders has been introduced in @xcite . here , the main aim of this paper is to introduce surface terms for quasitopological gravity in order to have a well - defined variational principle in the case of spacetimes with flat boundary .",
    "we also present the static and rotating charged black branes of quasitopological gravity and investigate their thermodynamics . to obtain the conserved quantities of the solutions",
    ", we use the counterterm method .",
    "this is due to the fact that , as in the case of einstein gravity , the action and conserved quantities diverge when the boundary goes to infinity .",
    "we will introduce a counterterm to deal with these divergences for spacetimes with flat boundary . since all curvature invariants of the boundary are zero , the only possible boundary counterterm is one proportional to the volume of the boundary regardless of the number of dimensions @xcite .",
    "the outline of our paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ bound ] , we give a brief review of the quasitopological gravity and review the surface terms of the einstein and gauss - bonnet gravities .",
    "then we introduce the surface term of quasitopological gravity for spacetimes with flat boundary . in sec .",
    "[ therm ] , we introduce asymptotically ads charged black branes of quasitopological gravity and investigate the thermodynamic properties of these solutions by using the relation between on shell action and gibbs free energy .",
    "section [ rot ] is devoted to the generalization of our static charged solutions to the case of rotating charged solutions .",
    "we also study the thermodynamic properties of charged rotating black branes .",
    "finally , we finish our paper with some closing remarks .",
    "the action of quasitopological gravity in @xmath2 dimensions with negative cosmological constant @xmath3 in the presence of the electromagnetic field may be written as @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the electromagnetic tensor field and @xmath6 is the vector potential .",
    "the first and second terms are the well - known cosmological constant and the einstein - hilbert action , the third term is the gauss - bonnet term    @xmath7    and the fourth term is the quasitopological term @xcite    @xmath8    one should note that our coupling constant @xmath9 is @xmath10 of ref .",
    "indeed , this term has no contribution to field equations in six or less than five - dimensional spacetimes .",
    "but , in contrast to the lagrangian of third order lovelock gravity @xcite which has no contribution to the field equations in five dimensions , this term contributes to the field equation in five dimensions .",
    "the field equations of quasitopological gravity are second - order differential equations only for the case of static metric .",
    "gibbons and hawking have mentioned that the einstein - hilbert action ( with @xmath11 ) does not have a well - defined variational principle , since one encounters a total derivative which produces a surface integral involving the derivative of variation of metric normal to the boundary , @xmath12 .",
    "such terms , which make the variation of action ill defined , should cancel by some surface terms which only depend on the geometry of boundary .",
    "in fact , the normal derivative terms can be canceled by the variation of gibbons - hawking surface term @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 is induced metric on the boundary @xmath15 and @xmath16 is the trace of extrinsic curvature of the boundary .",
    "therefore , any generalization of einstein - hilbert action needs similar but much more complicated surface terms .",
    "however , the surface terms which make the variation of action of lovelock gravity well - defined are known @xcite .",
    "this surface term for the case of gauss - bonnet gravity -with @xmath17 in the action ( [ actd])- is @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is @xcite @xmath20 in eq .",
    "( [ ib2 ] ) @xmath21 is the @xmath22-dimensional einstein tensor of the metric @xmath14 , and @xmath23 is the trace of @xmath24    now , we want to present the surface terms which make the variation of the action of quasitopological gravity ( [ actd ] ) well defined . by using the similarity of quasitopological gravity and third order lovelock gravity ,",
    "we introduce a surface term which makes  the action ( [ actd ] ) well defined . for simplification ,",
    "we restrict our consideration to the case of spacetimes with flat boundary , i.e. @xmath25 .",
    "therefore , we suggest a surface term with a combination of fifth order terms in extrinsic curvature as @xmath26 we can fix the unknown coefficients @xmath27 such that all normal derivative of  @xmath28 of quasitopological term are canceled by the variation of @xmath29 . since the quasitopological gravity gives second - order differential equations only for the case of static solutions , we present @xmath29 for the static metric .",
    "the @xmath2-dimensional static metric with a flat boundary may be written as @xmath30 substituting the metric ( [ met1 ] ) in the action ( [ actd ] ) and integrating by parts , we can choose @xmath27 s such that the variation of action becomes well defined .",
    "one encounters with only five equations for the seven unknown coefficients , @xmath27 s .",
    "so , one can set two of them to zero , which we choose them to be @xmath31 .",
    "it is worth noting that the value of total action is independent of our choice .",
    "the values of @xmath27 s may be obtained as @xmath32    in general @xmath33 is divergent when evaluated on solutions .",
    "one way of eliminating such divergence terms is through the use of the background subtraction method @xcite .",
    "however for asymptotically ads solutions , one can instead deal with these divergences by using the counterterm method inspired by ads / cft correspondence . in this method the divergence terms",
    "are removed by adding a counterterm action @xmath34 which depends on the boundary curvature invariants .",
    "the suitable counterterm for quasitopological gravity is unknown .",
    "however , for the case of spacetimes with flat boundary @xmath35 , one can add a term proportional to the volume of the boundary : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is a scale length factor that depends on @xmath38 , @xmath9 , and @xmath1 .",
    "of course , @xmath37 must reduce to @xmath38 as @xmath9 and @xmath1 go to zero .",
    "here , we investigate the thermodynamics of static charged solutions of quasitopological gravity by the counterterm method introduced in the last section .",
    "since we are assuming spherical symmetry , we can obtain the one - dimensional action . using the static metric ( [ met1 ] ) with @xmath39 and @xmath40 for the vector potential , after integration by parts",

    "varying the action with respect to @xmath43 yields @xmath44 which shows that @xmath45 should be a constant which we set equal to @xmath46 . varying the action with respect to @xmath47 and substituting @xmath48 gives @xmath49 which has the solution @xmath50 after varying the action ( [ act2 ] ) with respect to @xmath45 , substituting @xmath51 and using eq .",
