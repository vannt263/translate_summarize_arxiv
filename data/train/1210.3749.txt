    "suppose that one has @xmath0 copies of a quantum system each in the same state depending on an unknown parameter @xmath1 , and one wishes to estimate @xmath1 by making some measurement on the @xmath0 systems together .",

    "what is the best we can do as @xmath2 , when we are allowed to optimize both over the measurement and over the ensuing data processing ? the objective of this paper is to study this question by extending the theory of local asymptotic normality ( lan ) , which is known to form an important part of the classical asymptotic theory , to quantum statistical models .",
    "let us recall the classical lan theory first .",

    ", one needs some mathematical devices . in general , a statistical theory comprises two parts .",
    "one is to prove the existence of a statistic that possesses a certain desired property ( direct part ) , and the other is to prove the non - existence of a statistic that exceeds that property ( converse part ) . in the problem of asymptotic efficiency , for example , the converse part , the impossibility to do asymptotically better than the best which can be done in the limit situation , is ensured by the following proposition , which is usually referred to as `` le cam s third lemma '' @xcite .",
    "[ prop : clecam3 ] suppose @xmath33 is lan at @xmath19 , with @xmath34 and @xmath21 being as above , and let @xmath35 be a sequence of random vectors . if the joint distribution of @xmath36 and @xmath34 converges to a gaussian distribution , in that @xmath37 then @xmath38 for all @xmath25 .",

    "this proves the existence of an asymptotically efficient estimator for @xmath44 . in the real world",
    "however , we do not know @xmath15 ( obviously ! ) .",
    "thus the existence of an asymptotically optimal estimator for @xmath44 does not translate into the existence of an asymptotically optimal estimator of @xmath1 .",
    "in fact , the usual way that le cam s third lemma is used in the subsequent analysis is in order to prove the so - called representation theorem , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 7.10 ) . this theorem can be used to tell us in several precise mathematical senses that no estimator can asymptotically do better than what can be achieved in the limiting gaussian model .",
    "for instance , van der vaart s version of the representation theorem leads to the asymptotic minimax theorem , telling us that the worst behaviour of an estimator as @xmath1 varies in a shrinking ( 1 over root @xmath0 ) neighbourhood of @xmath15 can not improve on what we expect from the limiting problem .",
    "this theorem applies to _ all _ possible estimators , but only discusses their _ worst _ behaviour in a neighbourhood of @xmath1 .",
    "another option is to use the representation theorem to derive the convolution theorem , which tells us that _ regular _ estimators ( estimators whose asymptotic behaviour in a small neighbourhood of @xmath1 is more or less stable as the parameter varies ) have a limiting distribution which in a very strong sense is more disperse than the optimal limiting distribution which we expect from the limiting statistical problem .",
    "this paper addresses a quantum extension of lan ( abbreviated as qlan ) . as in the classical statistics ,",
    "one of the important subjects of qlan is to show the existence of an estimator ( direct part ) that enjoys certain desired properties",
    ". some earlier works of asymptotic quantum parameter estimation theory revealed the asymptotic achievability of the holevo bound , a quantum extension of the cramr - rao type bound ( see section b.1 and b.2 ) . using a group representation theoretical method , hayashi and",
    "matsumoto @xcite showed that the holevo bound for the quantum statistical model @xmath45 comprising the totality of density operators on the hilbert space @xmath46 is asymptotically achievable at a given single point @xmath19 .",
    "following their work , gu and kahn @xcite developed a theory of strong qlan , and proved that the holevo bound is asymptotically uniformly achievable around a given @xmath19 for the quantum statistical model @xmath47 comprising the totality of density operators on the finite dimensional hilbert space @xmath48 .",
    "they proved that an i.i.d .",
    "model @xmath49 and a certain quantum gaussian shift model can be translated by quantum channels to each other asymptotically .",
    "although their result is powerful , their qlan has several drawbacks .",
    "first of all , their method works only for i.i.d .",
    "extension of the totality @xmath50 of the quantum states on the hilbert space @xmath51 , and is not applicable to generic submodels of @xmath50 .",
    "moreover , it makes use of a special parametrization @xmath1 of @xmath50 , in which the change of eigenvalues and eigenvectors are treated as essential .",
    "furthermore , it does not work if the reference state @xmath52 has a multiplicity of eigenvalues .",
    "since these difficulties are inevitable in representation theoretical approach advocated by hayashi and matsumoto @xcite , gu and jenov @xcite also tried a different approach to qlan via the connes cocycle derivative , which was put forward in the literature as an appropriate quantum analogue of the likelihood ratio .",
    "however they did not formally establish an expansion which would be directly analogous to the classical lan .",
    "in addition , their approach is limited to faithful state models .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to develop a theory of weak qlan based on a new quantum extension of the log - likelihood ratio .",
    "this formulation is applicable to any quantum statistical model satisfying a mild smoothness condition , and is free from artificial setups such as the use of a special coordinate system and/or non - degeneracy of eigenvalues of the reference state at which qlan works .",
    "we also prove asymptotic achievability of the holevo bound for the local shift parameter @xmath44 that belong to a dense subset of @xmath53 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the main results are summarized in section [ sec : mainresults ] .",
    "we first introduce a novel type of quantum log - likelihood ratio , and define a quantum extension of local asymptotic normality in a quite analogous way to the classical lan .",
    "we then explore some basic properties of qlan , including a sufficient condition for an i.i.d .",
    "model to be qlan , and a quantum extension of le cam s third lemma .",
    "section [ sec : appqlan ] is devoted to application of qlan , including the asymptotic achievability of the holevo bound and asymptotic estimation theory for some typical qubit models .",
    "proofs of main results are deferred to section a. furthermore , since we assume some basic knowledge of quantum estimation theory throughout the paper , we provide , for the reader s convenience , a brief exposition of quantum estimation theory in section b , including quantum logarithmic derivatives , the commutation operator and the holevo bound ( section b.1 ) , estimation theory for quantum gaussian shift models ( section b.2 ) , and estimation theory for pure state models ( section b.3 ) .",
    "it is also important to notice the limits of this work , which means that there are many open problems left to study in the future . in the classical case",
    ", the theory of lan builds , of course , on the rich theory of convergence in distribution , as studied in probability theory . in the quantum case ,",
    "there still does not exist a full parallel theory .",
    "some of the most useful lemmas in the classical theory simply are not true when translated in the quantum domain .",
    "for instance , in the classical case , we know that if the sequence of random variables @xmath54 converges in distribution to a random variable @xmath55 , and at the same time the sequence @xmath56 converges in probability to a constant @xmath57 , then this implies joint convergence in distribution of @xmath58 to the pair @xmath59 . the obvious analogue of this in the quantum domain",
    "is simply untrue .",
    "in fact , there is not even a general theory of convergence in distribution at all : there is only a theory of convergence in distribution towards quantum gaussian limits .",
    "unfortunately , even in this special case the natural analogue of the just mentioned result simply fails to be true .    because of these obstructions we are not at present able to follow the standard route from le cam s third lemma to the representation theorem , and from there to asymptotic minimax or convolution theorems .",
    "however we believe that the paper presents some notable steps in this direction .",
    "moreover , just as with le cam s third lemma , one is able to use the lemma to construct what can be conjectured to be asymptotically optimal measurement and estimation schemes .",
    "we make some more remarks on these possibilities later in the paper .",
    "in developing the theory of qlan , it is crucial what quantity one should adopt as the quantum counterpart of the likelihood ratio .",
    "one may conceive of the connes cocycle @xmath60_t:=\\sigma^{\\sqrt{-1}t } \\ , \\rho^{-\\sqrt{-1}t}\\ ] ] as _ the _ proper counterpart since it plays an essential role in discussing the sufficiency of a subalgebra in quantum information theory @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we shall take a different route to the theory of qlan , paying attention to the fact that a `` quantum exponential family '' @xmath61 inherits nice properties of the classical exponential family .",
    "[ def : qlikelihoodratio ] we say a pair of density operators @xmath62 and @xmath63 on a finite dimensional hilbert space @xmath51 are _ mutually absolutely continuous , _ @xmath64 in symbols , if there exist a hermitian operator @xmath65 that satisfies @xmath66 we shall call such a hermitian operator @xmath65 a _ quantum log - likelihood ratio_. when the reference states @xmath62 and @xmath63 need to be specified , @xmath65 shall be denoted by @xmath67 , so that @xmath68 we use the convention that @xmath69 .",
