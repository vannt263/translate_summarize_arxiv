    "recently an eight - component relativistic wave equation for spin-@xmath0 particles was proposed  @xcite .",
    "this equation was obtained from a four - component spin-@xmath0 wave equation ( the kg@xmath0 equation  @xcite ) , which contains second - order derivatives in both space and time , by a procedure involving a linearization of the time derivative analogous to that introduced by feshbach and villars  @xcite for the klein - gordon equation .",
    "this new eight - component equation gives the same bound - state energy eigenvalue spectra for hydrogenic atoms as the dirac equation but has been shown to predict different radiative transition probabilities for the fine structure of both the balmer and lyman @xmath1-lines  @xcite .",
    "since it has been shown that the new theory does not always give the same results as the dirac theory , it is important to consider the validity of the new equation in the case of other physical problems .",

    "it is easier to calculate the result using the four - component kg@xmath0 equation and this is carried out in section  [ 4-kg-1/2 ] .",
    "however , for completeness , the calculation for the eight - component theory is given in section  [ 8-theory ] and is shown to be equivalent to that obtained by the four - component theory , namely the well - known klein - nishina formula  @xcite initially obtained using the dirac theory .",
