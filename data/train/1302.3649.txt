    "graphene , a two - dimensional ( 2d ) honeycomb lattice of carbon atoms , was thrust into the limelight of condensed - matter research since its experimental emergence in 2004 @xcite .",
    "much of this attraction is due to its 2d structure and contrary to any ordinary 2d material , having two dirac cones in the brillouin zone ( bz ) , where the conduction and valence bands touch .",
    "charge carriers with momenta near these two cones ( known as @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) have a unique linear energy dispersion and behave like massless dirac fermions . on the other hand , crystalline blg @xcite has recently attracted a great deal of attention because of its unique tunable electronic properties .",
    "it consists of two single - layer graphene ( slg ) sheets separated by a small distance and can be produced by mechanical exfoliation of thin graphite or by thermal decomposition of silicon carbide .",
    "the low - energy quasi - particles in blg behave as massive chiral fermions and are responsible for a plethora of interesting physics including broken - symmetry states at very weak magnetic fields when blg is suspended to reduce disorder  @xcite and anomalous exciton condensation in the quantum hall regime  @xcite .",
    "although the intrinsic blg is a zero - gap semi - metal , it becomes a tunable band gap semiconductor  @xcite when a gate voltage is applied .",
    "the band gap determines the threshold voltage and the on - off ratio of field - effect transistors and diodes , thereby making blg more convenient for applications in nano - electronic industry than slg  @xcite .",
    "one of the fundamental problems of interest in graphene research is the indirect exchange interaction between two localized magnetic moments placed on this otherwise non - magnetic material .",
    "this carrier - mediated exchange interaction is known as rkky interaction @xcite and it plays a significant role in the magnetic ordering of many electronic systems including spin glasses and alloys . as it was originally studied for three - dimensional electron gas , it has also been studied for electron gas in one @xcite and two @xcite dimensions .",
    "two main features of the long - range behavior of the interaction , measured by exchange integral , @xmath2 , for an electron gas is that it oscillates ( in sign and magnitude ) with the distance , @xmath3 , between the moments , which exhibits ferromagnetic ( fm ) or anti - ferromagnetic ( afm ) ordering and also decays  @xcite with @xmath3 .",
    "both of these features have different functional forms depending on the dimension and generally , on the energy dispersion of the host material . for slg , the rkky interaction has extensively been studied @xcite . for an undoped slg ( @xmath4 ) two main features are agreed upon , first , unlike an ordinary 2d metal with @xmath5 decay in the long - distance limit",
    ", @xmath2 in undoped graphene falls off as @xmath6 and shows the @xmath7$]-type oscillations with additional phase factors  @xcite depending on the direction of @xmath8 , and second , the moments on the same sublattice exhibit an fm interaction and an afm coupling if placed on the opposite sublattices , as required by the particle - hole symmetry  @xcite .",
    "the rkky interaction for doped graphene shows a long - range behavior similar to that of ordinary 2d electron gas with another oscillatory factor emerging from the dirac cones .",
    "it was shown that two characteristic momenta , @xmath9 and @xmath10 can be tuned to exhibit an unusual beating of the rkky interaction for certain magnetic moment arrangements @xcite .    the rkky interaction in blg",
    "has also been addressed by several researchers  @xcite .",
    "the local moment formation for adatoms on blg using a mean - field theory of the anderson impurity model has been studied by killi et al  @xcite .",
    "they showed that the rkky interaction between local moments can be varied by tuning the chemical potential or by tuning the electric field as it induces changes in the band structure of blg .",
    "the symmetry of the rkky interaction on the bipartite lattice at half filling has been discussed recently  @xcite and the distance dependence of the rkky interaction has been briefly reported . furthermore , jiang et al  @xcite , investigated the rkky interaction in multilayer graphene systems and they showed that the thickness of the multilayer influences the interaction in a complicated manner and that the interaction couplings fall off as @xmath5 in long - range regime for blg .",
    "however , the previous studies have only considered the rkky interaction in the half - filled ( @xmath4 ) blg .",
    "consequently , significant tunability feature of the rkky interaction due to both doping , where the fermi energy is no longer zero , and the perpendicular electric field , which gives rise to the gapped blg , have not been addressed in the literature .",
    "both of these cases are of paramount importance when it comes to possible spintronic applications and will be the main focus in the present work .    in this paper , we extend the green s function ( gf ) technique used for the rkky interaction in slg  @xcite to blg .",
    "all cases of undoped , doped , unbiased and biased system are considered .",
    "we use the effective two - band hamiltonian for the blg  @xcite and for the first time , report the analytical expressions of the rkky interaction for unbiased blg in terms of the meijer g - functions .",
    "we also present the numerical results of the interaction in the presence of a perpendicular electric field and show how the long - range behavior of the interaction can be tuned by the gate voltage .",
    "we explore a beating pattern of oscillations of the rkky interaction in the four - band continuum model in which two conduction bands are partially occupied ( highly doped system ) .",
    "furthermore , we discuss the discrepancy between the short - range rkky interaction calculated from the two - band and that obtained from the four - band continuum model .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we introduce the general formalism and all the required gfs that will be used in calculating the rkky interaction within the gf approach . in sec .",
    "iii and iv , we present the analytical results of the rkky coupling within the two - band and four - band models , respectively .",
    "the main numerical results using two - band and four - band models and a brief account of the difference between the rkky interaction within the four - band model and the effective two - band approximation are presented in sec .",
    "v. finally , we summarize the results in sec . vi and draw some conclusions .",
    "we have used the same gf method in studying the impurity states induced by a single vacancy in slg , that includes the behavior of the @xmath11 electrons as well as the @xmath12 electrons both using model and density - functional calculations .",
    "the blg in bernal stacking lattice shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : blg ] consists of two slg lattices offset from each other in the @xmath13 plane with four atoms in the unit cell such that the top @xmath14-sublattice is directly above the bottom @xmath14-sublattice and it is between these pairs of atoms that the inter - layer dimer bonds are formed .",
    "the other two atoms do not have a counterpart on the other layer .",
    "we assume that the @xmath15-hybridized electrons of carbon atoms in each sheet are inert and only take into account the @xmath16 electrons which form the @xmath12 bands .",
    "( @xmath17 ) sublattices are indicated by red ( green ) circles with corresponding intra - layer and inter - layer hopping amplitudes .",

    "we consider two magnetic impurities located at @xmath19 and @xmath20 and in contact interaction with the electrons of the biased blg in bernal stacking , where @xmath21 and @xmath22 denote the sublattice indices ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "the tight - binding hamiltonian of the system is given by @xmath24 where the hamiltonian for the biased blg , @xmath25 , is given by    @xmath26    where @xmath27 is the layer index , @xmath18 is an external potential difference between the layers , @xmath28 ev is the intra - layer nearest - neighbor hopping energy @xcite , the hopping energy between on - top sublattices in different layers is @xmath29 ev and furthermore , @xmath30 denotes the hopping energy between not on - top sublattices between two layers  @xcite . another inter - layer second - nearest - neighbor hopping energies @xmath31 ev and hence very small compared to @xmath32 and can be ignored .",
    "the position vectors of three nearest neighbors of @xmath14-atom is denoted by @xmath33 and @xmath34 is the carbon - carbon bond length . in the most general case ,",
    "the on - site energies on the four atomic sites are no longer equal .",
    "they consist of independent parameters to describe inter - layer asymmetry between the layers , an energy difference between two atoms in each layer and finally an energy difference between dimer and non - dimer sites .",
    "however , in this paper , we assume the equal on - site energies . the wave function can be written as a four - component spinor , @xmath35 . in this basis , the hamiltonian of the biased blg in eq .",
    "is represented as a @xmath36 matrix given by  @xcite @xmath37 where @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the interaction between the localized spins @xmath41 and @xmath42 and the itinerant electron spins @xmath43 is given by @xmath44    ignoring @xmath45 and @xmath46 in the hamiltonian justifies the use of the bz for slg to describe the electrons momenta for the blg .",
    "therefore , we similarly describe the physics for those electrons with momenta in the proximity of the dirac points @xmath47 . in order to find the low - energy hamiltonian near dirac points ,",
    "we expand the function @xmath48 using @xmath49 in powers of @xmath50 and keep only the linear term , which yields @xmath51 where @xmath52 indicates the valley label , @xmath53 ( @xmath54 from now on ) is the fermi velocity of the electrons in slg , @xmath55 and @xmath56 is the polar angle of @xmath50 with respect to the @xmath57-axis chosen to be along the direction of @xmath58 .",
    "furthermore , we consider @xmath59 which allows us to eliminate the high - energy states perturbatively and simplify the hamiltonian in eq . to two - band effective hamiltonian with states localized around @xmath60 and @xmath61 sites . doing so yields four bands , two degenerate bands in each of the two valleys @xmath0 and @xmath1 , described by the effective two - band hamiltonian  @xcite @xmath62 where @xmath63 for the @xmath0 valley and @xmath64 for @xmath1 valley and @xmath65 and it is about @xmath66 corresponding to a very small effective mass .",

    "we emphasize that the unperturbed hamiltonians for the four - band and two - band models are denoted by @xmath25 and @xmath69 , respectively .      in the linear - response theory ,",
    "the strength of the rkky interaction , @xmath2 , is found by two steps .",
    "first , using the lippmann - schwinger equation @xmath71 , one calculates the perturbed state @xmath72 , of the surrounding electron gas ( host material ) at the unperturbed state @xmath73 due to the first moment , @xmath41 localized at the origin and second , the first - order correction in the energy of this spin - polarized gas is found in the presence of the second moment , @xmath74 localized at the lattice position @xmath8 , viz . , @xmath75 .",
    "here , @xmath76 is the the unperturbed retarded gf .",
    "therefore , the interaction energy may be written as @xmath77 with the rkky interaction @xmath78 being proportional to the static susceptibility , @xmath79 viz .",
