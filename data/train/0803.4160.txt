    "this paper is about basic analytical properties of elliptic operators on compact manifolds with smooth boundary .",
    "our main achievements are ( i ) to develop the basic elliptic analysis in full generality , and not only for the generic case of operators of dirac type in product metrics ( i.e. , we assume neither constant coefficients in normal direction nor symmetry of the tangential operator ) ; ( ii ) to establish the cobordism invariance of the index in greatest generality ; and ( iii ) to prove the continuity of the caldern projection and of related families of global elliptic boundary value problems under parameter variation .",
    "we take our point of departure in the following observations .",
    "most analysis of geometrical and physical problems involving a dirac operator @xmath0 on a compact manifold @xmath2 with smooth boundary @xmath6 acting on sections of a ( complex ) bundle @xmath7 seems to rely on quite a few basic facts which are part of the shared _ folklore _ of people working in this field of global analysis ( e.g. , see boo ",

    "* appendix ) and boo  bavnbek , lesch and phillips @xcite for property ( param ) ) :    wiucp : :    the weak inner unique continuation property ( also called _ weak  to the    boundary _ ) , i.e. , there are no nontrivial elements in the null space    @xmath8 vanishing at the boundary @xmath6    of @xmath2 ; invdoub : :    the existence of a suitable elliptic invertible continuation    @xmath9 of @xmath0 , acting on sections of a    vector bundle over the closed double or another suitable closed    manifold @xmath10 which contains @xmath2 as    submanifold ; this yields a poisson type operator @xmath11    which maps sections over the boundary into sections over    @xmath2 ; and a precise caldern projection @xmath12 ,    i.e. , an idempotent mapping of sections over the boundary onto the    cauchy data space which consists of the traces at the boundary of    elements in the nullspace of @xmath0 ( possibly in a scale of    sobolev spaces ) ; cob : :    the existence of a selfadjoint regular fredholm extension of any total    ( formally selfadjoint ) dirac operator @xmath0 in the    underlying @xmath13-space with domain given by a    pseudodifferential boundary condition ; that implies the vanishing of    the signature of the associated quadratic form , induced by the leading    symbol in normal direction at the boundary ; moreover , that actually is    equivalent to the cobordism theorem asserting a canonical splitting of    the induced tangential operator @xmath14 over    @xmath3 with @xmath15 ; param : :    the continuous dependence of a family of operators , their associated    caldern projections , and of any family of well - posed ( elliptic )    boundary value problems on continuous or smooth variation of the    coefficients .      with the renewed interest in geometrically defined elliptic operators of first order of general type , arising , e.g. , from perturbations of dirac operators ,",
    "we ask to what extent the preceding list can be generalized to arbitrary linear elliptic differential operators with smooth coefficients .",
    "it is hoped that the results of this paper can serve as guidelines for similar constructions and results for hypo- and sub - elliptic operators where the symbolic calculus is not fully available .",
    "there are immediate limits for generalization of some of the mentioned features by counter examples : ucp , even weak inner ucp may not hold for arbitrary elliptic systems of first order , see indications in that direction in pli ( * ? ? ?",
    "* corollary 1 , p. 610 ) and the first - order alinhac type counterexample to strong ucp ( * ? ? ?",
    "* example , p. 184 ) .",
    "moreover , from just looking at the deficiency indices , we see that the formally selfadjoint operator @xmath16 on the positive line does not admit a selfadjoint extension .",
    "this example is instructive because , quite opposite to the half - infinite domain , on a bounded one - dimensional interval _ any _ system of first - order differential equations satisfies property ( cob ) by a deformation argument .",
    "we go through the list .",
    "it seems that the precise domain of validity is unknown .",
    "the local stability of weak inner ucp has been obtained by boo ",
    "bavnbek and zhu in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 3.2 ) . in spite of the _ local _ definition of ucp",
    ", the property ( wiucp ) has a threefold _ global _ geometric meaning : ( i ) there are no ghost solutions , i.e. , each section @xmath17 belonging to the null space @xmath8 over the manifold @xmath2 has a non - trivial trace @xmath18 at the boundary ; ( ii ) equivalently , the maximal extension @xmath19 is surjective in @xmath20 for densely defined closed minimal @xmath21 ; and ( iii ) , as noted by boo ",
    "bavnbek and furutani in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 3.3 ) and in various follow - ups , it seems that assuming weak inner ucp of @xmath0 and @xmath22 is mandatory for obtaining the continuity of cauchy data spaces and the continuous change of the caldern projection under variation of the coefficients , i.e. , property ( param ) .",
    "different approaches are available : one approach ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 9 ) ) has been the gluing of @xmath0 and its formal adjoint @xmath22 to an invertible elliptic operator @xmath9 over the closed double @xmath10 .",
    "this construction is explicit , if the metric structures underlying the dirac operator s definition are product near the boundary . in the selfadjoint case",
    ", it yields at once the lagrangian property of the cauchy data space in the symplectic hilbert space @xmath23 of square integrable sections in @xmath24 .",
    "then ( cob ) follows .",
    "property ( invdoub ) generalizes to the non - product case for operators of dirac type and , as a matter of fact , for any elliptic operator satisfying weak inner ucp under the somewhat restrictive condition that the tangential operator has selfadjoint leading symbol . here",
    "the trick is that this condition permits the prolongation of the given operator to a slightly larger manifold @xmath25 with boundary reaching constant coefficients in normal direction close to the new boundary _ and _ maintaining ucp under the prolongation ( as well as formal selfadjointness of the coefficients , if present at the old boundary ) .",
    "this is explained in the appendix .",
    "but what can be done for general elliptic operators ?",
    "a very general and elegant construction of the caldern projection was given by hrmander in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 20.1.3 ) on the symbol level .",
    "unfortunately , he obtains only an _ almost _ projection ( up to smoothing operators ) which limits its applicability in our context .    in this paper",
    ", we shall exploit another general definition of the caldern projection which is due to seeley ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 1 and appendix , lemma ) .",
    "seeley s construction provides a precise projection , not only an approximate one , and does not require ucp .",
    "first he replaces @xmath0 by an invertible operator @xmath26 by adding the projection onto the finite  dimensional space of inner solutions .",
    "then he extends the operator @xmath27 to the closed double @xmath28 of a slightly extended manifold @xmath25 with boundary .",
    "in general , such a prolongation may , however , destroy weak inner ucp even when ucp was established on the original manifold .",
    "seeley constructs on the symbol level ( and by adding a suitable correction term ) an elliptic extension @xmath29 of @xmath30 over the whole of the closed manifold @xmath31 which is always invertible .",
    "he shows that @xmath29 provides the wanted poisson operator and a truly pseudodifferential caldern projection @xmath32 along the original boundary @xmath6 .",
    "if the tangential operator is formally selfadjoint then @xmath32 has selfadjoint leading symbol and can be replaced by the orthogonal projection which is also pseudodifferential and has the same symbol ( and may be denoted by the same letter @xmath32 ) . in this way , the choices in the _ construction of the invertible double _ are removed totally , as the operation of the resulting @xmath32 is concerned .",
    "this makes @xmath32 a good candidate for property ( cob ) .",
    "however , seeley s general construction , similarly the recent grubb ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 11.1 ) , in difference to the simple gluing in the case of dirac type operators of ( * ? ? ? * chapter 9 ) , does not immediately lead to the lagrangian property of @xmath33 . moreover and more seriously , when working with curves of elliptic problems seeley s construction does not give a hint under what conditions the caldern projections vary continuously when varying a parameter",
    ". there are too many choices involved in seeley s construction .",
    "this motivates our present approach ( inspired by himpel , kirk and lesch @xcite ) , namely the construction of the invertible double as a _ canonically _ given local boundary problem for the double @xmath30 exactly on the original manifold @xmath2 , without any choices , prolongations etc .",
    "this leaves us with full control of the ucp situation ; leads directly to the wanted fredholm lagrangian property ( cob ) ; and , moreover and here most decisively , provides explicit formulas for treating the parameter dependence in property ( param ) .",
    "this program is opened in section [ s : sectwo ] by explaining our basic choice of product structures near the boundary for the sake of comprehensible analysis , even if the original geometric structures are non - product ; moreover , for the convenience of the reader and for fixing our notation we summarize a few basic facts about regular boundary conditions .    to begin with ,",
    "we do _ not _ assume selfadjoint leading symbol of the tangential operator @xmath34 _ nor _ constant coefficients @xmath35 along an inward coordinate @xmath36 .",
    "most of our estimates depend on the single fact that @xmath37 is parameter dependent elliptic for @xmath38 in a conic neighborhood of @xmath39 in the sense of shubin ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section ii.9 ) .",
    "more precisely , we depend on the related concept of sectorial spectral projections introduced in 1970 by burak @xcite and recently further developed in ponge ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 3 ) as part of the current upsurge of interest in spectral properties of non - selfadjoint elliptic operators . because of our interest in the continuous dependence of this kind of generalized positive spectral projections on the input data we found it necessary to develop the concept of sectorial projections once again from scratch .",
    "this is done in section [ s : sectorial ] where we develop an abstract hilbert space framework for the concept of sectorial projections and apply it to tangential operators perceived as parametric elliptic operators .    in section [ s : invdoub ]",
    "we provide the construction and the relevant properties of the invertible double yielded by a local elliptic boundary value problem , induced by fixing an invertible bundle homomorphism @xmath40 over @xmath3 . in section [ s : calderon ] we establish suitable sobolev regularity of the inverse operator which leads to the definition and basic properties of poisson operator and caldern projection , both definitions made dependent of the choice of the above mentioned homomorphism @xmath40 .",
    "we shall show that the range of the caldern projection does not depend on the choice of @xmath40 and is , in fact , equal to the cauchy data space .",
    "that yields the relation between the _ canonical _ caldern projection defined as orthogonal projection onto the cauchy data space , and our _ relative _ caldern projections , which depend on @xmath40 .",
    "however , it is not the canonical , but only the relative definition that establishes the lagrangian property of the cauchy data space and its continuous dependence of the coefficients for general elliptic differential operators of first order .",
    "that is the subject of the two closing sections of this paper , which present the fruits of the analysis endeavour of sections 1 - 5 .      in section [ s : cobord ] , we give a first application of our construction of the caldern projection : we give our reading of ralston @xcite and infer that the arguments of this 1970 paper establish the following findings for any formally selfadjoint differential operator @xmath0 over a compact manifold @xmath2 with smooth boundary @xmath6 :    * the existence of a selfadjoint fredholm extension @xmath41 given by a pseudodifferential boundary condition @xmath42 ; * the vanishing of the signature of @xmath43 on the space @xmath44 of eigensections to purely imaginary eigenvalues of the tangential operator @xmath34 of @xmath0 over the boundary ( or on @xmath45 in the case that @xmath34 is formally selfadjoint ) ; here @xmath43 denotes the form induced by the green form of @xmath0 on the symplectic von neumann space @xmath46 , i.e. , the leading symbol of @xmath0 over the boundary @xmath6 in normal direction ; * and , equivalently , but seemingly never recognized by people working in global analysis , the general cobordism theorem , stating that the index of _ any _ elliptic differential operator @xmath47 over a closed manifold @xmath6 must vanish , if @xmath47 can be written as the left lower corner of a formally selfadjoint tangential operator over @xmath6 induced by an elliptic formally selfadjoint @xmath0 on a smooth compact manifold @xmath2 with @xmath48 .      in section [ s : parameter ] , as a second application of our construction of the caldern projection , we establish that property in great generality .",
    "roughly speaking , we let an operator family @xmath49 and the family @xmath50 of formally adjoint operators vary continuously in the operator norm from @xmath51 to @xmath52 and assume that the leading symbol @xmath53 of @xmath49 over the boundary @xmath6 in normal direction also varies continuously in the @xmath54 operator norm with @xmath55 running in a parameter space @xmath56 .",
    "we assume for all @xmath57 and @xmath58 property ( wiucp ) or , almost equivalently , that the dimensions of the spaces of `` ghost solutions '' without trace at the boundary remain constant under the variation .",
    "then in theorems [ thm4.10 ] and [ thm4.14]a we show that the inverse of the `` invertible double '' and , under slightly sharpened continuity , the poisson operator in respective operator norms vary continuously ; and so does the resolvent of a family @xmath59 of well - posed fredholm extensions of now formally selfadjoint @xmath49 with orthogonal pseudodifferential projections @xmath60 varying in @xmath54 operator norm .",
    "unfortunately , we can neither prove nor disprove the continuous variation of the caldern projection in the same generality .",
    "however , if the leading symbol of the tangential operator is selfadjoint , we can prove the continuous variation of the sectorial projection ( proposition [ p : dependence - pplus - self - adjoint ] ) and so ( corollary [ thm4.14-sa ] ) of the caldern projections by our correction formula and theorem [ thm4.14]b .",
    "our proposition [ p : lower - order ] shows that the difficulties for proving continuous variation of the sectorial projection disappear also for non - selfadjoint leading symbol , if the variation is of order @xmath61 .    in appendix",
    "a we discuss various special cases with emphasis on constant coefficients in normal direction in a collar around the boundary .",
    "the main results of this paper have been announced in @xcite .",
    "we shall begin with a basic observation : _ dirac operators _ emerge from a riemannian structure on the manifold and a hermitian metric on the vector bundle ( together with clifford multiplication and a connection ) .",
    "talking about a _ general differential operator _",
    "it is in our view very misleading to pretend that the operator will depend on metrics and such .",
    "all we need is the operator and an @xmath13structure on the sections .",
    "the latter basically only requires a density ( take @xmath62 in the riemannian case ) on the manifold and a metric on the bundle . in this paper , we prefer to _ choose _ metrics and such as simple as possible and push all complications into the operator .    the message is this : we can always work in the product case and do have to worry only about the operator . in detail :    let @xmath2 be a compact manifold with boundary and @xmath63 a vector bundle . given a hermitian metric @xmath64 on @xmath7 and a riemannian metric @xmath65 on @xmath2 we can form the hilbert space @xmath66 which is the completion of @xmath67 with regard to the scalar product @xmath68 the space of smooth sections of the vector bundle @xmath7 over @xmath2",
    "is denoted by @xmath69 ; the corresponding space of smooth compactly supported sections is denoted by @xmath70 . given another riemannian metric @xmath71 and another hermitian metric @xmath72 on @xmath7",
    "there is a smooth positive function @xmath73 such that @xmath74 and there is a unique smooth section @xmath75 such that for @xmath76 we have @xmath77    with regard to @xmath64 the operator @xmath78 is selfadjoint and positive definite , thus we may form @xmath79 which is again a smooth selfadjoint and positive definite section of @xmath80 .",
    "it is clear that determines @xmath78 uniquely and the claimed smoothness of @xmath81 can be checked easily in local coordinates . in sum , we find for @xmath82 @xmath83 thus we arrive at    [ l2.1 ] the map @xmath84 extends to an isometry from @xmath66 onto @xmath85",

    "we consider here only the smooth case , but so far one can replace `` smooth '' by `` continuous '' or `` lipschitz '' or whatever .",

    "we briefly discuss for the various cases ( i)(v ) whether the construction of @xmath29 can be modified such that the relations continue to hold",

    "in subsection [ ss : product ] we first applied a unitary transformation to our operator .",
    "it remains to clarify what happens if we transform the whole construction back to the original situation .",
    "the result reads as follows :    let @xmath1443 be a compact riemannian manifold with boundary , @xmath1444 a hermitian vector bundle over @xmath2 and @xmath1445 a first order elliptic differential operator which is formally selfadjoint in the hilbert space @xmath85 .",
