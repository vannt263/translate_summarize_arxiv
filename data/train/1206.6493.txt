    "forbidden line ratios are often employed to determine the hardness of the radiation field and the composition and physical state of irradiated gas within star - forming galaxies . of the quantities revealed by these ratios ,",
    "the ionization parameter @xmath3  the ratio of ionizing photon density to hydrogen density  is of special interest , as it measures the dimensionless intensity of ionizing radiation . because @xmath0 controls the ionization state ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it is easily disentangled from other parameters @xcite ; and because it indicates the ratio of ionizing radiation pressure to gas pressure ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it encodes information about the relative importance of these forces in star formation feedback .",
    "it is important , therefore , to understand the physical and observational effects which influence our estimates of @xmath0 in distant galaxies .",
    "when determined on kiloparsec scales , @xmath4 appears to reach a maximum value of about -2.3 in starburst environments , and indeed holds this value throughout the inner 500 pc of m82 @xcite .",
    "these points led @xcite to argue that this maximum @xmath4 is a property of the starburst phenomenon . however , higher values ( up to about -1 ) are sometimes seen in cases where regions are individually resolved @xcite .",
    "why do individual regions not exhibit arbitrarily high ionization parameter , and why are starburst determinations limited to @xmath5 ?",
    "both limits strongly suggest the operation of a saturation mechanism .",
    "we know of four possibilities :    _ dynamics .",
    "_ the characteristic values of @xmath0 could originate in the dynamics of expanding regions .",
    "@xcite  ( @xcite , hereafter d05 ) , in particular , explain the saturation of @xmath0 in terms of the ` stalling ' of expanding regions as they decelerate to the ambient sound speed . under a specific set of assumptions about the dynamics of regions and their interaction with ambient gas ,",
    "this implies a unique value of @xmath0 at the time of stalling , which imprints itself on the line ratios integrated over an entire galaxy . however , there are two problems with the assumptions that enter this explanation .",
    "first , d05 follow @xcite in modeling regions as though they were enclosed stellar wind bubbles and therefore use the @xcite  model to describe their motions .",
    "two pieces of evidence indicate that wind energy escapes regions , contrary to this assumption . trapped",
    "wind would produce x - ray luminosities as much as two orders of magnitude higher than what is observed ( e.g. , in the carina nebula : * ? ? ?",
    "moreover , d05 find that the wind luminosity must be drastically scaled down to reproduce the observed range of @xmath0 values .",
    "( we revisit this issue below in  [ ss : winds ] and  [ conclusion ] . )",
    "second , d05 assume that the ambient gas is the warm ( ionized or neutral ) component of the ism , and therefore has a unique sound speed of roughly @xmath6kms@xmath7 .",
    "although this is plausible , many of the ionizing photons will be consumed as the dense molecular material or cold neutral hydrogen is being cleared away .",
    "as the thermal sound speed of this matter is quite low , the appropriate stalling criterion involves the total ( turbulent , magnetic and thermal ) ambient pressure ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ".    _ homogeneous mixtures . _",
    "a separate explanation has been provided by ( * ? ? ? *",
    "fs01 ) in the context of the central 500pc starburst core of m82 , where their and later observations @xcite demonstrate that @xmath0 is remarkably uniform .",
    "the fs01 model invokes an ensemble of neutral clouds with ionized outer layers , scattered among newly formed stars .",
    "the uniformity of @xmath0 must therefore be sought in the properties of this mixture , which are not part of the @xcite model .",
    "for this reason we do not investigate mixture models further , except to point out that most physical mechanisms limiting @xmath0 in individual regions would also operate here .",
    "_ radiation pressure confinement_. another physical mechanism for the saturation of @xmath0 was introduced by @xcite and elaborated by @xcite  ( @xcite , d02 ) in the context of narrow - line regions in active galactic nuclei . when irradiation is sufficiently intense , ionized gas develops a pressure gradient to oppose the force of photons caught by neutral atoms and dust grains , and is squeezed into a thin layer near the ionization front ( if ) .",
    "this prevents gas pressure from becoming small compared to the ionizing radiation pressure ( as previously argued by @xcite ) .",
    "the corresponding upper limit on @xmath8 depends on the ionizing spectrum and the lines used to infer ionization ; a rough estimate based on pressure equilibrium gives -1.5 .",
    "while this is significantly above the value of -2.3 seen in starbursts , the details of line formation , among other effects , can reduce @xmath0 to about its observed maximum .",
    "_ dust - limited regions_. finally , the observed saturation could simply be a selection effect , caused by the fact that dust absorbs most of the ionizing starlight in regions with @xmath9 , suppressing their line emission .",
    "because extragalactic observations inevitably integrate over a wide range of local conditions , the inferred @xmath0 will be weighted toward regions of lower intensity .",
    "such a ` dust - limited ' state has been shown to successfully reproduce the suppression of fine structure lines relative to far - infrared luminosity in ultra - luminous infrared galaxies @xcite .",
    "our goal in this paper is to evaluate these possibilities and , in the process , to assess whether @xmath0 can be a useful proxy to measure radiation pressure feedback in regions in external galaxies .",
    "we review the physical effects which control the state of ionized gas and the values of @xmath0 inferred from forbidden line ratios , focusing on its saturation in starburst galaxies and the relevance of the last two mechanisms .",
    "because radiation pressure and dust opacity are both proportional to @xmath0 , they occur simultaneously .",
    "but , since they are truly two separate physical mechanisms , we take care not to conflate them . in this paper",
    "we concentrate on the internal structures of regions , only evaluating a very simple model for their dynamics and galactic populations (  [ ss : dust_abs ] ) . a companion paper ( verdolini et al .",
    "2012 , in prep . )",
    "presents a new suite of models for the emission from galactic populations of regions evolved with more sophisticated internal dynamics .",
    "we begin in   [ s : parameters ] by reviewing the parameters of quasi - static , dusty , spherical regions .",
    "we draw here on the models of @xcite ( @xcite , hereafter dr11 ) , examining in detail their planar , radiation - confined limit ( appendix [ appendix : planarregions ] ) , but we also introduce a new parameter to account for an inner , pressurized region of shocked stellar wind . we discuss the scales of dust opacity and radiation pressure in   [ ss : basics ] , confinement by radiation pressure and the maximum @xmath0 in   [ ss : radconfinement ] , and the influence of an inner bounding pressure in   [ ss : pressureparameter ] .",
    "in   [ s : dynamics ] we focus on the extra effects which can reduce the maximum value of @xmath0 , including stellar winds and neutral clumps in the region .",
    "magnetic fields can in principle allow @xmath0 to violate its nonmagnetic upper limit , but this turns out to be difficult to arrange .",
    "we discuss the effects of internal and external dust extinctions on limiting @xmath0 in   [ ss : dust_abs ] . in ",
    "[ s : model ] , we provide a survey of @xmath0 values obtained from modeled mir line ratios within static and internally pressurized dusty regions , and demonstrate how stellar winds act to suppress @xmath10 . in   [ s : implication ] , we use our results to interpret observations on the scales of individual regions and entire galaxies .",
    "in the static or quasi - static state , regions have several well - known limits : classical regions @xcite , which lack significant radiation pressure or dust opacity ; dusty regions @xcite in which radiation pressure is negligible ; and radiation - confined regions @xcite in which both radiation pressure and dust opacity are generally important .",
    "recently , dr11 has thoroughly explored the parameter space of dusty regions with radiation pressure , demonstrating a three - parameter family of models which takes all of these limits .",
    "ionization and force balance within spherical regions are especially simple under the following set of idealizations ( dr11 ) : the ionized gas temperature @xmath12 , the mean energy of ionizing photons @xmath13 , the effective dust opacity per h atom @xmath14 , and the effective recombination coefficient @xmath15 , are all uniform constants ; pressure from reprocessed radiation , such as the lyman @xmath15 line , is unimportant ; the flow is static , so forces must balance ; the pressure from stellar winds is neglected ( which we will relax below in  [ ss : pressureparameter ] and  [ ss : winds ] ) ; and there are no additional forces from gravity or magnetic fields .    with these idealizations",
    ", regions are described by seven dimensional parameters : @xmath16 , the central output of ionizing photons per second ; @xmath17 and @xmath18 , the total force of ionizing and non - ionizing photons refers to the frequency range where the dust opacity is still @xmath19 ; dr11 assumes that the two opacities are equal . ]",

[ [ def : n_em ] ] ) , and @xmath26 the radius of a uniform - density , dust - free strmgren sphere whose gas pressure equals the total , unattenuated radiation pressure @xmath27 at its boundary .",
    "( our @xmath28 differs from @xcite s [ hereafter km09 s ] @xmath29 in that it accounts neither for the effects of dust extinction , nor for the additional pressure from stellar winds . )",
    "yet another is @xmath30 , the ionization front radius .",
    "we focus on three dimensionless ratios which control the structure and appearance of the region .",
    "first of these is the characteristic ratio of ionizing radiation pressure to gas pressure in a classical strmgren sphere , @xmath31 where n@xmath32=10@xmath33 n@xmath34 @xmath35 , @xmath36s@xmath7 , and we have used @xmath37@xmath38s@xmath7 @xcite . here and elsewhere , we use the subscript ` st ' to denote conditions in a classical , uniform strmgren sphere without attenuation , rather than the actual region .",
    "an alternative to @xmath39 foregoes @xmath40 as a dimensional scale in favor of the actual ionization front radius @xmath30 ; @xmath41 this is useful if @xmath30 is observed or derived from the dynamics of the region ( km09 ) ; we use @xmath42 to parameterize our simulation output in ",
    "[ s : model ] .",
    "bear in mind that @xmath42 decreases as radiation pressure becomes more important , whereas @xmath39 increases .",
    "our second parameter is the dust opacity in a classical region , @xmath43 both @xmath39 and @xmath44 are proportional to @xmath45 ; as a result @xmath46 in uniform regions .",
    "the third parameter is the _ dust discriminant _",
    "@xmath47 where @xmath48@xmath49 .",
    "this sets the relative importance of dust and neutral h atoms in absorbing ionizing photons when radiation pressure confines the gas : in a situation where gas pressure matches the ionizing radiation pressure , the dust absorbs a fraction @xmath50 of all ionizing photons .",
    "fiducial parameters ( @xmath51ev ) give @xmath52 .",
    "additional parameters are required to capture the spectral form of the incident starlight and dust opacity , the most relevant of which , @xmath53 , compares the radiation force of non - ionizing starlight to that of ionizing starlight ; see dr11 and appendix [ appendix : planarregions ] .    for emission in a given line , and",
    "therefore for the determination of line ratios and electron temperatures , the ratio of the characteristic density @xmath24 to the transition s critical density @xmath54 is a significant additional parameter .",
    "so long as this ratio is small for all of the lines which are either observed or contribute to the collisional cooling of the region , the density parameter will not be important .",
    "we return to this point in  [ s : model ] .",
    "although the above idealization of regions is reasonable and admits a simple parameter space , we wish to relax its approximations and assumptions when considering observational constraints .",
    "microphysical assumptions , such as the constancy of @xmath12 , can be relaxed through the use of a modern photoionization code like cloudy or mappings ; we take this approach in ",
    "[ s : model ] .",
    "macrophysical issues , such as stellar winds and bulk flow , must be addressed separately (   [ s : dynamics ] ) .",
    "we are especially interested in observational measures of the ionization parameter @xmath55 .",
    "this is directly related to the ionizing radiation - to - gas pressure ratio @xmath56    these are both functions of position @xmath57 , and are each observable only in an integral sense within the region .",

    "@xmath89 determines the importance of dust absorption .      in a classical region ( @xmath100 ) , except for a small region near the ionizing source @xcite , radiation pressure is negligible and has no practical effect on the distribution of ionized gas . in this case",

    "all of the momentum in ionizing starlight , and ( thanks to dust ) some of the momentum in non - ionizing starlight , is transferred to the ionized gas . in a quasi - static region without other forces , the radiation force must be balanced by a gas pressure gradient .",

    "we find in figure [ fig : ne3ne2_2myr ] that @xmath10 derived from a particular [ neiii]/[neii ] line ratio exhibits a maximum at @xmath117 for our fiducial parameters .    because of the effects just described , the saturation of emission line ratios is a feature of the radiation - confined state in which photon momentum dominates over gas pressure gradients in the structure and dynamics of regions . as we shall see in  [ ss : dust_abs ] , however , a selection effect due to dust attenuation (   [ ss : dust_abs ] ) also modulates the apparent value of @xmath10 in large - scale observations of dusty galaxies ( @xmath106 ) .",
    "both effects are important in the interpretation of galactic line ratios .    in appendix [",
    "appendix : planarregions ] and figures [ taudxifion ] and [ xiestimatesplanar ] , we present the properties of regions in the radiation - confined state , i.e. , the planar limit of dr11 s equations in the absence of a finite pressure at the inner boundary . this limit , which corresponds to @xmath111 ( and @xmath118 in the definitions of  [ ss : pressureparameter ] ) , is parameterized only by the dust discriminant @xmath89 and the spectral parameter @xmath53 , which quantifies the non - ionizing radiation pressure .",
    "although these solutions are only a subset of dr11 s three - parameter model family , they improve upon the treatment by @xcite by accounting for the gas density gradient induced by radiation pressure .",
    "they show that : ( 1 ) @xmath119 saturates at a value which is near unity and only logarithmically dependent on @xmath89 .

    "what happens if the mean column density of the ambient medium is less than four times this shell column , so there is not enough matter to achieve it ? in this case , it is easy to show that the initial strmgren sphere forms outside @xmath124 , so that @xmath125 and @xmath126 : the radiation - dominated phase never occurs .",
    "the ionizing sources of regions ( typically stars , star clusters , or agn ) often produce fast outflows which decelerate or are deflected before they reach the if , thereby creating regions of hot and pressurized gas within the photo - ionized zone",

    "the ratio of outer to inner pressures is not appropriate , because the two are equal in a classical region and also in a wind - confined shell .",
    "neither is the volume fraction of the interior zone , because photo - ionized gas can be confined to a thin shell by radiation pressure just as well .",
    "instead we choose @xmath127 where @xmath128 is the difference of the product of pressure and volume between the if and the inner edge of the region ( the outer edge of a pressurized bubble ) .",
    "this combination reflects the strength of the interior pressure , both for classical and radiation - dominated regions .",
    "in fact @xmath79 directly reflects the contribution of the interior bubble to the total kinetic energy of the region , which , according to the virial theorem @xcite , controls the expansion of it and any shell of neutral matter it pushes outward ( e.g. , km09 ) .    in figure",
    "[ fig : parameterspace ] we indicate the physical regimes of spherical , quasi - static , dusty regions surrounding a central wind bubble .",
    "quasi - static hii regions typically have an inward gradient of @xmath0 . for classical regions",
    "this is simply because the ionizing flux is greater at smaller radii , while for radiation - confined regions it is due to the gas density gradient . in either case ,",
    "replacing a region s inner portion with hot gas has the effect of removing its most highly photo - ionized zone .",
    "this effect will be greatest for those lines more which form preferentially in regions of highest @xmath0 .",

    "relatively dust free ( @xmath129 ) regions , low - density ionized gas fills the interior ( appendix [ appendix : planarregions ] ) . because this low - density gas is ideal for the formation of lines sensitive to regions of high @xmath0 , we expect these line ratios to be especially sensitive to interior pressure when @xmath111 and @xmath130 .",

    "most such regions are ionized by hot stars , which inject fast line - driven winds .",
    "however the significance of stellar wind pressure depends on the wind strength , e.g. the ratio @xmath132 between the momentum fluxes of winds and starlight , and the trapping of wind energy within the region .",
    "km09 combine these into a single parameter @xmath133 which encapsulates the contribution from shocked winds relative to the direct momentum flux of starlight .",
    "so long as the combined force of winds and radiation compresses the ionized layer into a thin shell , the enclosed volume is constant and @xmath79 reduces a comparison of pressures . since @xmath134 in this case (",
    "appendix [ appendix : forcebalance ] , ignoring on the last term the factor @xmath135/(1+\\beta)$ ] which accounts for incomplete absorption ) , we expect @xmath136 further , if we consider a typical location where half of the incident radiation has been absorbed and its pressure applied to the gas , the same approximations lead to the estimate @xmath137 although , in the case where confinement is accomplished by radiation alone ( @xmath138 ) , the values of @xmath107 plotted in figure [ xiestimatesplanar ] are more accurate .",
    "we refer to section 3.1 of km09 for a detailed discussion of the characteristic values of @xmath84 and @xmath139 one might expect around massive star clusters . for our purposes",
    ", it suffices to consider three limiting cases : ( 1 ) perfectly trapped , adiabatic bubbles of shocked wind , as envisioned in the models of @xcite and @xcite and employed by @xcite , which have @xmath140 ; ( 2 ) leaky wind bubbles ( @xcite , km09 ) , for which @xmath141 in the case of a very massive cluster of solar metallicity ( km09 ) ; and ( 3 ) very weak wind bubbles with @xmath142 , such as one might expect if the central source consists of low - metallicity or lower - mass main sequence stars .    in the first case ( adiabatic wind bubbles ) @xmath143 and @xmath59 will be limited to values well below @xmath144 .",
    "indeed , @xmath145 can easily be computed from the self - similar solutions of @xcite : using @xmath146 and evaluating for the case of a steady wind in a uniform medium @xcite , @xmath147 the factor of two in the first equality arises because a pressure - confined ionized layer is nearly uniform and optically thin to dust ; therefore @xmath0 drops linearly in radius from the value @xmath69 at its inner edge .",
    "since @xmath148kms@xmath7 from a young cluster which fully samples the imf , equation ( [ ugeominweaver77 ] ) yields @xmath149 . equation ( [ ugeominweaver77 ] ) assumes the ionization front is trapped within the swept - up ambient matter , which requires @xmath150 where @xmath151 is the ambient h density in @xmath35 , @xmath152kms@xmath7 , and @xmath153kms@xmath7 .    in the second case ( leaky bubbles ) , the wind force is of order @xmath154 and is therefore significant when @xmath139 exceeds unity .",
    "so long as the ionized layer is thin , the suppression of @xmath10 relative to @xmath71 is of order @xmath155 as given by equation ( [ xifromftrapw ] ) .    in the last case ( very weak winds )",

    "spherically symmetric , partially - radiative bubbles @xcite , which have @xmath139 lower than the adiabatic case but well above unity , are not especially relevant here because they require slower winds than is typical of ionizing stars .",
    "fast - wind bubbles can also become radiative , however , because of mass entrainment from evaporating clumps ( see  [ ss : clumps ] ) .",
    "note that @xcite argued that this effect prevents the filling factor of shocked wind , and therefore also @xmath139 , from exceeding unity .",
    "as an aside , we note that some ultracompact regions are probably formed in quasi - static layers confined by the ram pressure of protostellar winds , which are both highly collimated and much stronger than radiation pressure . combining the outflow force - luminosity correlation reported by @xcite with the collimation model of @xcite , @xmath157 for an angle @xmath158 from the wind axis and a bolometric source luminosity @xmath159 .",
    "such regions are typically in the first , wind - dominated regime , even well away from the wind axis .",

    "regions are often porous and clumpy instead of spherical , as we invoked above in the context of wind trapping . here",
    "we wish to point out that clumpiness reduces the inferred @xmath10 relative to a spherical region of the same radius .",
    "the net effect is therefore to reduce @xmath10 relative to @xmath114 , although the upper limit does not necessarily change .    in the absence of significant radiation pressure ,",
    "a clump subjected to ionizing radiation is first crushed by the recoil of its photo - evaporative flow @xcite .",
    "if the clump is dense enough to survive the first implosion phase , it comes into a quasi - static equilibrium with the induced pressure @xcite , in which its radius of curvature is @xmath161 ( on the symmetry axis , or the point most directly illuminated by starlight ) .",
    "ionization balance in the presence of this accelerating and diverging photoionized flow implies @xmath162 where @xmath163 is the ionized gas density just outside the clump if at this point , @xmath164 is the distance from the clump to the central source , and @xmath165 @xcite the parameter which describes the characteristic ionizing radiation - to - gas pressure ratio ( @xmath166 ) for this outflow is therefore @xmath167 compared to conditions at a spherical if of radius @xmath30 , @xmath168 a clump generally has a smaller value of @xmath169 , and therefore @xmath0 , than its parent region , because its radius of curvature @xmath161 is significantly less than the ionization front radius @xmath30 of the region .",
    "a clump s photoevaporation flow ends at a deceleration shock caused by the pressure from ionized gas in the parent region , stellar winds , or radiation .",
    "as @xmath170 increases toward unity , radiation pressure requires that the shock approach the sonic point of the photoevaporation flow , and when @xmath171 , radiation impedes the outflow of ionized gas . for @xmath172 ,",

    "the ionized layer of a clump can not be hydrostatic : it must either evaporate away , or be dragged along the clump surface by the tangential component of the radiation momentum flux , and also possibly by the stress from a turbulent boundary layer between photoionized clump gas and shocked stellar winds .",
    "such wind and photon - driven flows are a plausible source of supersonic line widths in giant regions , for photoevaporative flows only produce motions of up to about twice the ionized sound speed @xcite .",
    "it is not at all clear that a dynamical equilibrium exists which would prevent a clump with @xmath174 from being dynamically disrupted , although a magnetic buffer zone may allow this ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "magnetic fields supply an additional form of pressure which is available to balance the force of radiation , and therefore have the potential to raise @xmath10 _ above _",
    "however this is somewhat difficult to arrange .",
    "consider a planar shock of speed @xmath175 running into a medium of hydrogen density @xmath176 , magnetic field perpendicular to the shock normal @xmath177 and alfvn speed @xmath178 .",
    "the post - shocked fluid is in contact with ( and driven forward by the pressure of ) an ionized layer . ignoring any change in pressure across the post - shocked layer as well as streaming of the ionized gas ( both of which can be order - unity effects ) ,",
    "the density of ionized gas at the contact discontinuity is @xmath179 if it is pressure - supported , and @xmath180 if it is magnetically supported .",
    "magnetic pressure support therefore requires @xmath181 where @xmath182kms@xmath7 is the ionized sound speed .",
    "magnetic support is therefore only relevant for shock speeds in excess of about @xmath183kms@xmath7 .",
    "magnetic fields should be relatively more important within clumpy regions , because of the tendency for streaming and turbulent flows to amplify them toward equipartition with the kinetic energy .",
    "our discussion so far has focused on regions which are in force balance because ionized gas resides within them for long enough to be crossed by sound waves .",
    "however , some regions will be too young ( or have crossing times too long ) to develop into this state , such as the regions created in cosmological reionization . in others , ionized gas flows through the region at speeds well in excess of the ionized sound speed ; these include ionized winds and jets , ionized ejecta , ionized zones of supersonic turbulence , and regions around runaway stars .",
    "indeed , champagne flows @xcite are density - bounded to one side and are only approximately in force balance on the side toward the ionization front .",
    "none of these impulsive or inertially - confined flows is limited to @xmath184 and @xmath185 for the reasons we have outlined : therefore , higher values of @xmath10 could be taken as spectral evidence of this state .",
    "loosely speaking , an observation of @xmath10 above @xmath114 implies that either a non - thermal form of pressure , such as ram pressure or magnetic fields , balances radiation pressure , that another force ( such as gravity ) is at play , or that there has not been time to establish equilibrium .",
    "it is worth noting a couple additional effects involving the interaction among light gas , and dust :    _ lyman-@xmath15 trapping and dust absorption_. in the absence of dust , photons from the ly-@xmath15 line scatter many times before escaping .",
    "once the scattered line radiation is sufficiently strong its pressure will augment gas pressure , leading to an _ increase _ of @xmath114 ( see * ? ? ? * for an analysis of line pressure in the agn context ) .",

    "emission lines usually arise from regions large enough to encompass many local environments , so their ratios reflect an average of the local conditions . dust absorption has the effect of dimming high-@xmath0 regions , suppressing their contribution to the average and causing a saturation of the apparent ionization level .",
    "this bias arises from the dust absorption of ionizing radiation within regions , and from the absorption of the forbidden lines themselves , predominantly outside the regions themselves .",
    "if a region is sufficiently dusty , then the dust optical depth will exceed unity before radiation pressure becomes important .",

    "the ionization efficiency @xmath86 drops from unity ( for a classical region ) to an asymptotic value of order @xmath203 ( in the planar limit , when @xmath106 : appendix [ appendix : planarregions ] ) as radiation pressure and dust extinction become significant ; see dr11 s eq .  ( 21 ) . for the parameters of interest , the minimum value of @xmath86 is about 0.3 .",
    "because of this , recombination light from the regions of highest @xmath10 is suppressed by the factor @xmath86  so that , on a galactic scale , @xmath10 is reduced relative to @xmath114 . specifically ,",
    "so long as the extinction of line photons (  [ sss : ext_abs ] ) is negligible , the inferred value of @xmath10 on galactic scales will be approximately the emission - weighted average of all the regions encompassed by the observation : we call this @xmath204 .",

    "however , the decline in @xmath86 accompanying the increase in @xmath44 suppresses the contribution of those regions with highest @xmath10 .",
    "so long as the region population includes a range of intensities and a significant range of @xmath87 and @xmath86 , the net effect will be that @xmath204 is an underrepresentation of the starlight - weighted average of @xmath10 ( the result of taking @xmath212 in eq .",

    "therefore , although dust within the region does not severely attenuate recombination line photons , the surrounding matter poses a thicker barrier .",

    "as expected , the data range up to values which are approximately our estimated maximum value for each method . for individually - resolved regions , the observed upper limit appears to be somewhat higher than our prediction , but we attribute this to the approximate nature of our @xmath282 ( rather than to magnetic fields , say ) . for galactic - scale observations highest",
    "@xmath10 is slightly lower than our @xmath114 , which could be a product of the averaging process .",
    "these results in hand , we turn to the importance of wind pressure in regions .    for a resolved , spherical region with well - constrained observations of @xmath16 , @xmath283 , and @xmath10 , it is possible to estimate the wind parameter @xmath79 by reference to a plot like our figure [ fig : ne3ne2_2myr ] . with only @xmath10 or @xmath69 ,",
    "one obtains an upper limit on @xmath79 . by this logic",
    ", we can state quite firmly that the wind parameter @xmath79 is often small in resolved regions : otherwise , our example values of @xmath10 in the upper panel of figure [ fig : uexamples ] would be much less than the theoretical maximum .",
    "the same argument applies , if somewhat more weakly , to entire galaxies : for them , @xmath284 ranges up to about @xmath285 .",
    "this is far higher than what would be possible if they were adiabatic wind bubbles ( eq .  [ ugeominweaver77 ] ) unless they are exceptionally weak .",
    "this can be seen , for instance , in figure [ fig : ne3ne2_2myr ] , where we use the values of @xmath204 and the product of _ total _ @xmath16 and inferred @xmath286 to place several starburst galaxies within the parameter space of individual regions . because this is an upper limit on the actual values of @xmath271 within each galaxy s regions , and because @xmath204 can not be higher than the typical values of @xmath10 in those regions",
    ", we infer that the characteristic values of @xmath287 can not exceed about @xmath288 .",
    "while wind - dominated bubbles are likely to exist , we find no evidence for them either in individual regions or on galactic scales .",
    "we conclude from this that the leakage of wind energy past the if , either by advection or radiation , is significant .",
    "our primary motivation in this study has been to assess whether the ionization parameter can be used to measure the importance of radiation pressure in the inflation of regions in external galaxies , especially starburst galaxies .",
    "we have been interested in how well the observational estimate @xmath10 reflects the radiation - to - gas pressure ratio @xmath155 in local conditions and its average over galactic scales . because @xmath289 in each parcel of gas , and because @xmath0 controls the ionization state and therefore the emitted spectrum , it is possible , in principle , to derive the role of photon momentum in the kinematic feedback from young star clusters into the nearby dense neutral gas .",
    "( although supernovae tend to inject more energy , they are thought to couple very poorly to dense , star - forming gas ; @xcite . )",
    "because emission line ratios reflect local conditions , this information would be complementary to the global analysis of @xcite .",
    "to this end we explored the properties of strongly radiation - confined layers using the analytical theory of dr11 ( appendix [ appendix : planarregions ] ) , considered a host of physical effects and scenarios which could affect @xmath10 in real regions (   [ s : dynamics ] and   [ ss : dust_abs ] ) , and engaged in a suite of numerical models of dusty regions in quasi - static force balance with an interior pressurized wind bubble (   [ s : model ] ) .",
    "our models , though not meant to probe the full parameter space of regions , are the first to explore a wide range of both the radiation force parameter ( @xmath169 or @xmath42 ) and the wind pressure parameter ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "two effects complicate our plan to measure radiation pressure feedback using the apparent ionization parameter .",
    "first is the fact that strongly radiation - dominated regions compress their ionized gas into thin layers whose internal pressure gradient balances the radiation force @xcite .",
    "the ionization parameter recorded in any line ratio reflects the ratio of radiation to gas pressure where the lines are produced , and in radiation - confined regions @xmath10 saturates at a maximum value .",
    "the resulting values of @xmath290 depend on the lines in question (   [ s : model ] ) and parameters such as the dustiness of the region and the ionizing spectrum , but are roughly @xmath291 , the value for which @xmath292 .",
    "for the particular neon line ratio plotted in figure [ fig : ne3ne2_2myr ] , the upper limit is actually @xmath293",
    ". only significant levels of ram pressure or magnetic pressure , or serious departures from force balance , allow for @xmath10 to exceed this putative maximum (  [ ss : magnetic]-[inertialconfinement ] ) , and this point may be useful in diagnosing the physical states of unresolved regions .",
    "conversely any significant pressure on its inner boundary , such as the pressure due to shocked stellar winds , reduces @xmath155 and @xmath294 ( as well as the dust optical depth @xmath87 ) below their maximal values (   [ ss : winds ] ) .",
    "our limited compilation of ionization parameters in individual regions ( figure [ fig : uexamples ] , top panels ) is consistent with the proposition that @xmath10 varies up to the maximum imposed by radiation confinement ; for instance , @xcite find @xmath295 in individual regions in the antennae galaxies .",
    "another complicating effect is the suppression of the apparent ionization parameter on galactic scales by selective dust absorption of ionizing photons in the regions where @xmath0 is highest .",
    "gas in the local universe is sufficiently dusty ( @xmath296 ) that the dust optical depth @xmath87 exceeds the radiation - to - gas pressure ratio @xmath155 , both of which vary proportionally to @xmath0 : all radiation - confined regions ( and some others ) are dust - limited .",
    "such dust - limited regions convert a large portion of the stellar ultraviolet radiation into far infrared continuum , limiting the efficiency @xmath86 of line production . for observations which span a wide range of local conditions , this biases the inferred estimate of @xmath0 ( which we call @xmath204 in this case ) toward regions of lower @xmath297 and @xmath10 .    within the toy model for galactic region populations we present in  [ sss : int_abs ]",
    ", it appears this selection effect suppresses @xmath204 by a small amount ( @xmath2980.05 dex ) relative to an unbiased ( i.e. , starlight - weighted ) average of @xmath10 , primarily because the line efficiency @xmath86 gradually declines by only 0.5 dex ( to a minimum of about 0.35 ) as radiation confinement becomes strong .",
    "although this result depends on the assumptions in our toy model , it strongly suggests that @xmath204 can be corrected for selective absorption and used to infer the physical characteristics of the galactic region population .",
    "chief among these would be the ratio of radiation and gas - pressure forces averaged over a galaxy s ionized zones , a quantity we plot ( for the toy model ) in the top panel of figure [ fig : uobsgalmodel ] .",
    "it has long been appreciated that the dust - bounded state contributes to the suppression of fine - structure cooling lines relative to the far - infrared continuum in ulirgs @xcite , and that recombination luminosity under - represents the ionizing luminosity in this state ;    these effects provide observational checks on the degree of dust saturation one might infer from recombination line ratios .",
    "the galaxies collected in the bottom panel of figure [ fig : uexamples ] display an upper limit of @xmath299 , with some uncertainty .",
    "this is very close to the upper limit of @xmath293 we found for @xmath10 derived from a [ neiii]/[neii ] line ratio in young regions (  [ s : model ] ) , especially considering the bias induced by dust attenuation .",
    "we infer , therefore , that radiation pressure strongly modifies the ionized zones in these galaxies .",
    "a result of dust - induced bias is that the upper limit of @xmath204 will be weakly anti - correlated with metallicity . to test this",
    ", one must disentangle variations in @xmath0 from variations in the incident spectrum due to changes in stellar metallicity , and possible influences of metallicity on the stellar initial mass function ( and more subtly , on stellar rotation and multiplicity ) .",
    "moreover , our analysis of the radiation - confined state ( appendix [ appendix : planarregions ] ) suggests a change in the properties of radiation - confined regions with metallicity above and below about @xmath300 , , @xmath301 , and @xmath302 . ] corresponding to @xmath303 . for higher values of @xmath89 , as we have already mentioned , dust absorption is significant in all radiation - confined zones .",
    "further , for @xmath106 radiation - confined zones are compact ( the density scale height is much smaller than the radius ) and the lyman-@xmath15 line pressure is negligible .",
    "none of these is true for @xmath304 : regions with significant radiation pressure extend inward toward the central source , are supported by line pressure as well as gas pressure , and are not significantly attenuated by dust .",
    "moreover , the wind pressure will typically be lower on account of the lower opacity of stellar atmospheres .",
    "we leave a full investigation of this transition to future research , but point out that many works on photo - ionization in active galactic nuclei have been carried out in the limit @xmath305 .",
    "we firmly rule out the hypothesis that resolved regions are predominantly the ionized shells of energy - conserving wind bubbles ( as envisioned for giant regions by @xcite ) .",
    "the pressure of shocked winds in such models lowers @xmath0 well below observed values .",
    "although this discrepancy can be remedied by decimating the wind luminosity @xcite , it is more natural to attribute the reduction in wind pressure to leakage of hot gas beyond the ionization front , either via direct outflow or radiative losses . it is preferable to employ models which explicitly account for such leakage ( * ? ? ?",
    "such models form the basis for populations of regions in the toy model of  [ sss : int_abs ] and in a future companion paper ( verdolini et al .  in prep . ) , in which line emission by star - forming galaxies will be reconsidered in greater detail than is possible here .",
    "it is possible to interpret entire galaxies in terms of models of individual regions , as we discussed in ",
    "[ s : implication ] . this must be done with caution , because observations on galactic scales must necessarily average over a wide range of conditions , and are biassed by dust absorption . acknowledging this",
    ", one can nevertheless derive an effective upper limit on the wind pressurization @xmath79 from the fact that a larger value of this parameter would limit @xmath204 below what is observed .    for observational and theoretical studies of the ionization parameter ,",
    "an important point is that the method used to infer @xmath10 affects the result , leading to systematic offsets between methods . traditionally line ratios are compared with suites of simulations in which @xmath10 represents the interior of an ionized layer ( often one of uniform density ) , a definition which corresponds to our @xmath69 so long as the layer is thin .",
    "this definition encounters a couple difficulties .",
    "first , the incident flux is attenuated by recombination and dust within the layer so that the characteristic value of @xmath0 is lower than the incident value ( e.g. , equation [ [ ugeominweaver77 ] ] ) .",
    "second , ionized gas can only be confined to a thin layer by an inner , pressurized region of hot gas , or ( when @xmath106 ) by strong radiation pressure ; however , radiation confinement introduces a pressure and density gradient within the confined layer , and wind confinement limits the maximum values of @xmath155 and @xmath0 well below unity and 0.1 , respectively . for these reasons ,",
    "uniform - slab calculations are physically inconsistent at high values of @xmath0 .",
    "it is preferable to use suites of simulations involving spherical regions in quasi - static force balance , but a single sequence of these excludes the role of a wind pressurization parameter ( our @xmath79 ) .    as an alternate standard",
    ", we advocate using , for @xmath10 , the value of @xmath0 within a uniform mixture of gas photons for which the emitted line ratios match those observed .",
