    "low - energy supersymmetry , which is one of the most prominent candidates of the physics beyond the standard model , may significantly affect the evolution of the universe .",
    "one reason is that , assuming @xmath6-parity conservation , the lightest superparticle ( lsp ) is stable , which becomes a well - motivated candidate of the cold dark matter .",
    "another famous reason , which is very important in the framework of local supersymmetry ( i.e. , supergravity ) , is that there exist various possible very weakly interacting particles in the particle content .",
    "the most important example is the gravitino , which is the gauge field for the local supersymmetry .",
    "since the gravitino is the superpartner of the graviton , its interaction is suppressed by inverse powers of the gravitational scale and hence its interaction is very weak . even though the gravitino is very weakly interacting , however , it can be produced by the scattering processes of the standard - model particles ( and their superpartners ) in the thermal bath in the early universe .",
    "once produced , the gravitino decays with very long lifetime .",
    "in particular , if the gravitino mass is smaller than @xmath7 , the lifetime becomes longer than @xmath8 and hence the primordial gravitinos decay after the big - bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) starts .",
    "the ( unstable ) gravitino is expected to be relatively heavy , and its decay releases energetic particles which cause dissociation processes of the light elements generated by the standard bbn reactions .",
    "since the standard bbn scenario more or less predicts light - element abundances consistent with the observations , those dissociation processes are harmful and , if the abundance of the primordial gravitinos are too much , resultant abundances of the light elements become inconsistent with the observations .",
    "such argument provides significant constraints on the primordial abundance of the gravitino @xcite.constraints on the case with the gravitino lsp have been considered in refs .",
    "@xcite . in the inflationary scenario ,",
    "which is also strongly suggested by the wmap data @xcite , gravitinos are once diluted by the entropy production after the inflation .",
    "even in this case , however , gravitinos are produced again by the scattering processes of the particles in the thermal bath .",
    "since the total amount of the gravitinos produced by the scattering processes is approximately proportional to the reheating temperature @xmath9 , the bbn scenario is too much affected to be consistent with the observations if the reheating temperature is high . in the past",
    ", the bbn constraints on the unstable gravitino have been intensively studied @xcite .",
    "recently , kawasaki and two of the present authors ( k.k . and t.m . ) have studied the constraints on the unstable long - lived particle from the bbn in detail @xcite ; in particular , in this paper , effects of the hadrons produced by the decay of such unstable particles ( as well as the effects of the photo - dissociation ) were systematically studied , for old studies on the effects of the hadronic decay modes , see also @xcite . and",
    "general constraints on the primordial abundance of such unstable particles were presented .",
    "then , the results were applied to the case of the unstable gravitino and the upper bound on the reheating temperature was obtained for several simple cases .    in @xcite",
    ", however , several simplifications and assumptions are made for the properties of the gravitino .",
    "first of all , several very simple decay patterns of the gravitino were considered , which are applicable for very specific mass spectrum of the superparticles .",
    "in addition , for the hadronic branching ratio of the gravitino , only several typical values were used to obtain the constraint .",
    "furthermore , for some cases ( in particular , for the case where the gravitino dominantly decays into the gluon and the gluino ) , effects of the hadrons emitted from the superparticles ( like the gluino ) were neglected .",
    "thus , it is desirable to perform more detailed and complete analysis of the upper bound on the reheating temperature with the unstable gravitino .    in this paper",
    ", we study the effects of the unstable gravitinos on the bbn , paying particular attention to the properties of the gravitino .",
    "compared to the previous works , decay processes of the gravitino ( and the decay chains of the decay products including the superparticles ) are precisely and systematically studied . as a result ,",
    "energy spectra of the hadrons ( in particular , proton , neutron , and pions ) produced by the gravitino decay are studied in detail for various mass spectrum of the superparticles .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section [ sec : model ] , we present the model we consider and summarize the important parameters for our analysis . in section [ sec : decay ] ,",
    "detail of the decay processes of the gravitino is discussed .",
    "some of the important issues in our analysis , which is the secondary decays of the daughter particles from the gravitino decay and their hadronization processes , are discussed in section [ sec : hadronization ] .",
    "then , in section [ sec : abundance ] , outline of our calculation of the light - element abundances is discussed .",
    "our main results are given in section [ sec : results ] , and section [ sec : conclusions ] is devoted for conclusions and discussion .",
    "in this paper , we adopt the minimal particle content to derive the upper bound on the reheating temperature .",
    "thus , the model we consider includes the particles in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) as well as the gravitino .",
    "these particles are listed in table [ table : plist ] .",
    ".list of particles in the mass - eigenstate bases . [ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     although figs .",
    "[ fig : mtr1 ] @xmath10 [ fig : mtr4 ] look roughly the same , the upper bound on the reheating temperature has model dependences . in particular , for a fixed value of the gravitino mass , the upper bound depends on the mssm parameters as one can see in the figures . to see this in more detail , in table [ table : t_r ] ,",
    "we show the upper bound on @xmath9 for the cases listed in table [ table : msugra ] . for",
    "the fixed value of the gravitino mass , the upper bound on @xmath9 may vary by the factor as large as @xmath11 when the gravitino mass is of the order of @xmath12 . when the gravitino becomes heavier than @xmath13",
    ", however , the upper bound becomes insensitive to the model parameters .",
    "this is due to the fact that , in this case , the branching ratios of the gravitino are almost independent of the mssm parameters .",
    "model - dependence of the upper bound on the reheating temperature is mostly from the change of the lifetime and decay modes . for the case 1",
    ", we have chosen the msugra parameters which give relatively light superparticles ( compared to other cases ) . in the case 2 ,",
    "masses of all the superparticles are slightly increased compared to the case 1 .",
    "consequently , we can see some changes of the constraints on the reheating temperature .",
    "compared to the case 1 , scalar masses are significantly increased in the case 3 with the gaugino masses being unchanged . in this case , gravitino is likely to decay into the gauginos , in particular , into the gluino when kinematically allowed .",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ fig : br ] . )",
    "we found that the gluon - gluino final state produces more hadrons ( in particular , protons and neutrons ) than the quark - squark final state .",
    "consequently , in the case 3 , upper bound on @xmath9 becomes lower than that for the case 2 .",
    "we have also studied the case where masses of all the squarks and sfermions are pushed to infinity by hand while keeping the gaugino mass as low as @xmath14 . in this case , the constraint on @xmath9 is almost the same as that for the case 3 .",
    "in addition , in the case 4 , masses of all the superparticles are very large ( @xmath15 a few tev ) . then , lifetime of the gravitino becomes relatively long , which makes the upper bound less stringent for gravitinos with @xmath16 a few tev .",
    "although our main concern is to study the effects of the gravitino decay on the bbn , it is also important to consider other constraints .",
    "one of the important constraints is from the production of the lsp from the decay of the gravitino .",
    "importantly , the lsp is produced with the decay of the gravitino , and the present number density of the lsp is given by the sum of two contributions ; thermal relic , which is calculated with the darksusy package for each cases , and the non - thermally produced lsp from the gravitino decay . since one lsp is produced by the decay of one gravitino , the density parameter of the lsp which has non - thermal origin is given byin fact , entropy production occurs when the gravitino decays , and consequently , primordial lsps are diluted by some amount . for the reheating temperature giving the constraint on the relic density of the lsp , however , the effect of the dilution is negligible .",
    "@xmath17 where we have neglected the logarithmic corrections in eq .",
    "( [ ygrav ] ) . if we require , for example , that the total mass density of the lsp be within the 95  % c.l .",
    "bound of the wmap constraint ( i.e. , @xmath18 @xcite ) , we also obtain upper bound on @xmath19 , which is given by @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 , for the cases 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 , respectively.this bound is sensitive to the choice of the mssm parameters since the abundance of the thermally produced lsps depends on the mssm parameter . if we choose a parameter set which gives @xmath24 much smaller than the wmap value , bound from the production of the lsp may become much weaker . in our numerical analysis , we calculated the abundance of the lsp taking account of the entropy production by the decay of the gravitino ; constraint from @xmath25 is also shown in the figures",
    ".    another constraint may be obtained from the distortion of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) .",
    "an additional injection of the photon into the thermal bath by the decaying particles is severely constrained in order not to disturb the black - body shape of the cmb spectrum @xcite ; numerically , @xmath26 for @xmath27-distortion and @xmath28 for y - distortion are required @xcite . using these constraints",

    "@xmath38 is the photon temperature at present .",
    "constraint from the distortion of the cmb spectrum is also shown in the figures .",
    "so far , we have considered the constraints on the reheating temperature , assuming that the prediction of the standard bbn agrees with observations .",
    "although the standard bbn predicts the light - element abundances which are more or less consistent with the observational constraints , however , it has been pointed out that , if we adopt the baryon - to - photon ratio suggested by the wmap , standard bbn predicts the @xmath39 abundance slightly larger than the observed value .",
    "indeed , if we do not include the additional systematic error added in ( [ eq : li7 ] ) , the standard bbn prediction is found to be more than @xmath40 away from the center value .",
    "if we take this discrepancy seriously , we need some explanation which may include some effect of particle - physics model beyond the standard model @xcite . before closing this section , we comment on this issue .",
    "if the net production of @xmath39 can be somehow suppressed by the decay of the long - lived particle ( like the gravitino ) , the @xmath41 discrepancy may be solved . in the past",
    ", it was discussed that the @xmath39 abundance may be reduced by the photo - dissociation process induced by the _ radiative _ decay of the long - lived particle @xcite .",
    "the scenario with a long - lived particle which decays only radiatively is , however , severely constrained by the @xmath42 constraint ; in such a scenario , photo - dissociation of background @xmath43 is also induced which overproduces @xmath44 .",
    "thus , such a scenario does not work once the constraint on the @xmath42 abundance is taken into account @xcite .    in order to solve the discrepancy ,",
    "recently it was pointed out that the suppression of the @xmath39 abundance may be possible with _ hadronically _ decaying long - lived particles . in @xcite , it was discussed that , when the lifetime of the long - lived particle is @xmath45 , abundance of @xmath41 can become consistent with the observational constraint ( with no additional systematic error ) without conflicting other constraints .",
    "the reduction of @xmath39 is mainly due to the dissociation of @xmath46 ( which decays into @xmath39 ) by slow neutrons produced in the hadronic shower .",
    "( to be more exact , such slow neutrons are supplied by the destruction of @xmath43 , the inter - conversion from protons , and so on . )    to study this issue , we have looked for the parameter region where the @xmath39 abundance becomes consistent with the observational constraint ( [ li7_bonifacio]).note in this case that the @xmath47 of @xmath48 $ ] is calculated by eq .",
    "( [ eq : chi2_1 ] ) ( not eq .",
    "( [ eq : chi2_2 ] ) ) , and 95 @xmath49 c.l . corresponds to @xmath50 .",
    "in addition , because we fix the observational value of @xmath51 , and we adopt the observational value of @xmath52 in ( [ li7_bonifacio ] ) , the observational constraint on @xmath53 is also modified to be @xmath54 ( 2@xmath55 ) .",
    "although dissociation of @xmath46 by slow neutrons , which is the most important process , is taken into account in our numerical calculation , we could not include one of the non - thermal production process of @xmath39 : @xmath56 , followed by @xmath57 .",
    "this is because the experimental data for the energy distribution of the final - state @xmath58 is not available for the first process .",
    "thus , the @xmath39 abundance should be somehow underestimated . with a mild assumption that the kinetic energy of the energetic @xmath58 produced by the process @xmath59 is @xmath60 in the center of mass system independently of the energy of the beam nucleon @xcite",
    ", however , we checked that the resultant @xmath39 abundance is not significantly affected by this non - thermal production process in the parameter region in which we will be interested .",
    "thus , we believe that our calculation gives a reasonable estimate of the @xmath39 abundance ( even though the lower bound on the @xmath41 abundance was not considered in deriving the upper bound on @xmath9 ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : li7crisis ] , we show the region where the @xmath41 becomes consistent with the observational constraint ( [ li7_bonifacio ] ) . in this calculation , we have used the msugra parameters for the case 1 to determine the mssm parameters although the result is insensitive to the choice of the msugra parameters .",

    "then , we calculate the spectrum of the hadrons ( in particular , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 ) . with the hadron spectrum as well as the visible energy emitted from the decay of the gravitino , we calculate the light element abundances as functions of the gravitino mass and the reheating temperature . by comparing the results of the theoretical calculation with the observational constraints",
    ", we derived the upper bound on the reheating temperature after the inflation .",
    "although we have considered several difference mass spectrum of the mssm particles , the resultant constraints on the reheating temperature behave qualitatively the same .",
    "the detailed bound is , however , sensitive to the mass spectrum of the superparticles and the upper bounds on @xmath9 for several cases are summarized in table [ table : t_r ] .",
    "when the gravitino mass is a few tev , in particular , the hadro - dissociation processes provide significant constraints .",
