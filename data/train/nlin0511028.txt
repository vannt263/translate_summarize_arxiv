    "rayleigh - bnard convection ( rbc ) occurs when the temperature difference @xmath3 across a horizontal layer of fluid confined between two parallel plates and heated from below reaches a critical value @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "rotating the sample about a vertical axis at a rate @xmath5 induces a state of spatio - temporal chaos @xcite known as domain chaos .",
    "domain chaos features patches of straight rolls oriented at various angles @xcite .",
    "the orientation of the rolls fluctuates in time and space approximately at discrete angles due to the coriolis force which induces the kppers - lortz instability .",
    "the size and shape of the domains also fluctuates and moving defects pepper the entire pattern creating a state of persistent chaos in both space and time .",
    "figure [ cap : domain_chaos_images ] shows several snapshots of domain chaos .",
    "the theoretical models that describe domain chaos usually neglect the centrifugal force , relying on the coriolis force as the dominant effect brought by rotation .",
    "even when the full boussinesq equations of motion are considered , the centrifugal force often is evaluated on the assumption that the density is constant throughout the sample @xcite . in that case",
    "it has no influence on the neutral curve and on the pattern that forms above it . in this paper",
    "we show , both from experiment and from numerical simulations of the boussinesq equations , that the centrifugal force does have a significant influence on the quantitative features of domain chaos .",
    "this is so even for modest aspect ratios @xmath6 , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the radius and height of the convection sample .",
    "when @xmath9 becomes large enough the centrifugal force qualitatively alters the observed patterns . in order to reproduce these features in the simulation ,",
    "it is necessary to consider the temperature dependence of the density , as is done explicitly in the appendix .",
    "qualitatively the influence of the centrifugal force is readily understood .",
    "the vertical density gradient , resulting from the imposed temperature difference , induces a radial large - scale circulation ( lsc ) .",
    "the wave director of the rbc rolls tends to align orthogonally to the lsc @xcite .",
    "this tendency competes with the kppers - lortz mechanism that tends to create disordered and fluctuating domains .    for samples with @xmath9 up to about 40 we observed patterns in the experiment that were regarded as typical of domain chaos and similar to those found previously @xcite .",
    "however , as observed before @xcite , the patterns contained domains that were significantly smaller than those of simulations of the boussinesq equations . at larger @xmath10",
    "we found experimentally a hybrid state where the centrifugal force was strong enough relative to the coriolis force to qualitatively affect the pattern as shown in fig .",
    "[ cap : hybrid_state ] .",
    "there the central section looked like domain chaos , but the annular region along the perimeter was mostly made up of nearly - stationary nearly - radial rolls .",
    "defects glided azimuthally across the radial rolls ( a movie of this state can be found in the online version ) .",
    "although simulations of the boussinesq equations for such large @xmath9 were not feasible , the inclusion of an enhanced centrifugal force in simulations for @xmath11 showed a similar radial roll structure near the sample boundary .",
    "the outer region of the hybrid state had much in common with undulation chaos @xcite observed in inclined rayleigh - bnard convection . in the inclined system",
    "there is a component of gravity in the plane of the sample .",
    "the undulation chaos consists of defects gliding across straight rolls , with the roll axes aligned parallel to this in - plane component .",
    "similarly , there is an alignment of the roll axes in the rotating case that is nearly parallel to the ( radial ) centrifugal force , with defects gliding azimuthally across the rolls .",
    "the resemblance between these phenomena exists in spite of the fact that these forces possess a very different character because the centrifugal force depends on radial position while gravity is uniform throughout the sample .    in the remainder of this paper",
    "we first give some experimental and theoretical / numerical details , and then present several results of quantitative pattern analysis that characterize the extent of the influence of the centrifugal force for @xmath12 ( @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the angular rotation rate and @xmath15 the kinematic viscosity ) and @xmath16 . on the basis of this analysis",
    "we show for this parameter range that the crossover from the coriolis - force - dominated central region of domain chaos to centrifugal - force - dominated near - radial rolls occurs near @xmath17 ( @xmath18 is the radial coordinate ) when @xmath19 , and at somewhat smaller @xmath20 for smaller @xmath21 .",
    "we conclude that previous samples had been too small to observe the qualitative features of the hybrid state .",
    "unfortunately we also have to conclude that the experimental study of the coriolis - force effect in compressed gases , where large aspect ratios are attainable , will be severely contaminated by centrifugal - force effects when @xmath22 .",
    "the sample exhibiting the large-@xmath9 hybrid state ( see fig .  [ cap : hybrid_state ] ) had a height @xmath23 m with @xmath10 .",
    "it contained sulfur hexa - fluoride ( sf@xmath24 ) at a pressure of 25.44 bars and a mean temperature of @xmath25 where the prandtl number @xmath26 was 0.88 ( @xmath27 is the thermal diffusivity ) .",
    "we used the shadowgraph technique to image the convection patterns in an apparatus described elsewhere @xcite .",
    "although fig .",
    "[ cap : hybrid_state ] shows an image taken at @xmath28 , we observed a similar phenomenon over the entire range @xmath29 of accessible rotation rates that were substantially above @xmath30 .",
    "we also studied a medium and a small sample experimentally that did not exhibit the hybrid state .",
    "the medium sample had @xmath31 , a thickness of 720@xmath2 m , a pressure of 20.00 bars , a mean temperature of @xmath32 , and @xmath33 .",
    "the small sample had @xmath34 , was 1230@xmath2 m thick , operating at 12.34 bars , with a mean temperature of @xmath32 , and @xmath35 .",
    "in addition to the experiment , we also simulated the boussinesq equations to study the system theoretically . a discussion of the relevant equations of motion is given in the appendix .",
    "details of the numerical code are described elsewhere @xcite .",
    "no - slip velocity boundary conditions and conducting lateral thermal boundary conditions were utilized .",
    "we used a spatial resolution of 0.1 and a time resolution of 0.005 . in most simulations that included the centrifugal force ,",
    "the centrifugal term was made larger than would be physically realistic , in the present experimental fluid , in order to model the effect of a larger aspect ratio .",
    "two different configurations were used to compute the precession frequency @xmath36 . in one case , which included both the centrifugal and coriolis force",
    ", we used @xmath11 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and the centrifugal term was twice the physically realistic value in order to model a @xmath9 that would be twice as large . in the other case , where only the coriolis force was included @xcite , we used @xmath39 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 .",
    "we compare the results of these simulations to the experimental results from ref .",
    "@xcite , which also used @xmath39 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 .",
    "we also ran some simulations with the exact parameters of the @xmath34 experimental sample for direct comparison .",
    "finally we ran several additional cases for the @xmath40 simulation using a centrifugal term with various strengths .",
    "although previous theoretical work on domain chaos @xcite neglected the centrifugal force because the froude number @xmath41 ( @xmath42 is the acceleration of gravity ) is small in typical experiments , other research @xcite indicated that the froude number may not be the only relevant parameter .",
    "hart @xcite provided a numerical estimation of the parameter regimes where the centrifugal force is relevant .",
    "he made the approximation that @xmath43 is large ( @xmath44 500 ) , so we can not directly use that estimate because the present @xmath43 values are only about 20 .",
    "we instead consider @xmath45 ( @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the isobaric thermal expansion coefficient ) .",
    "a derivation of the relevant centrifugal and coriolis terms is given in the appendix .",
    "this parameter @xmath48 is the small-@xmath21 approximation to the ratio of the magnitude of the maximum of the centrifugal term , evaluated near the outer edge of the sample , to the magnitude of the coriolis term evaluated where it reaches a maximum in the horizontal direction , @xmath49 .",
    "( note that the temperature of the conduction profile is equal to @xmath50 for our system ) .",
    "the quantity @xmath48 is an indicator of the transition from domain chaos to a hybrid state .",
    "we can obtain an approximate numerical value for @xmath51 by performing a linear stability analysis to get the functional form of the velocity and by using the simulation to get the normalization .",
    "for the case of @xmath39 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 , we find @xmath52 at @xmath53 .",
    "these values should also approximately apply for our experimental parameters , which do not vary significantly from the parameters used to obtain the numerical values , except for @xmath9 whose dependence is explicit . for the @xmath10 sample ,",
    "@xmath54 for @xmath55 , indicating that the centrifugal force is almost as influential as the coriolis force , but for the @xmath34 sample and @xmath55 , @xmath56 indicating that the coriolis force dominates .",
    "both samples have similar values of @xmath43 and @xmath57 , so it is not surprising that we observe a @xmath9-dependent transition to a hybrid state induced by competition between the centrifugal force and the coriolis force .",
    "we qualitatively tested our hypothesis that the centrifugal force is responsible for the hybrid state by simulating the boussinesq equations with centrifugal force included .",
    "it was not possible to reach @xmath10 in the simulation in order to directly reproduce fig .",
    "[ cap : hybrid_state ] .",

    "figure [ cap : domain_chaos_images ] compares examples of the resulting pattern between simulation , with and without the effect of centrifugal force , and experiment . as noted before @xcite , we observed that the domain size was too large when we neglected the centrifugal force as seen by comparing figs .",

    "[ cap : domain_chaos_images]b .",
    "recent experiments @xcite disagreed with the theoretical prediction @xcite @xmath59 for the scaling of the correlation length @xmath60 and @xmath61 with @xmath62 for the scaling of the domain precession frequency @xmath36 .",
    "we do not address the @xmath60 scaling in the present work because finite - size effects cloud the issue @xcite .",
    "however , @xmath2 is unaffected by the finite - size effects @xcite .",
    "the method of determining @xmath36 is discussed in refs .",
    "we find that @xmath36 from the experiment agrees with the simulation when the centrifugal force is included .",
    "the scaling for @xmath36 is shown in fig .",
    "[ prescal ] for simulations both with and without the centrifugal force .",
    "the simulations that neglected the centrifugal force gave a scaling exponent @xmath63 , in good agreement with the prediction of @xmath62 from amplitude equations @xcite which also neglected the centrifugal force .",
    "there is also good agreement between the experimental data and the results of the simulation where both the centrifugal and coriolis force were included .",
    "not only did the numerical simulation yield a scaling exponent of @xmath64 , very close to @xmath65 from the experiment , but it also reproduced the actual values of @xmath36 in the experiment remarkably well .    aside from the dramatic effect on the pattern seen in fig .",
    "[ cap : hybrid_state ] , in the experiment we also observed a downward shift by three or four percent of the critical rayleigh number @xmath66 for the large sample .",
    "previous work @xcite showed that the centrifugal force may either stabilize or destabilize the convective flow depending on the parameter regime , although the range of parameters specifically corresponding to the present case was not directly investigated .",
    "however it was suggested that for small @xmath43 the centrifugal force lowers @xmath67 @xcite .",
    "we did not observe any radial dependence of @xmath67 for the @xmath10 sample .",
    "we measured @xmath67 in both a central circular region of half the sample radius and in the outer annulus surrounding that region .",
    "we accomplished this by computing the time averaged total power in the specified region of the experimental images as a function of @xmath3 .",
    "the total power is proportional to @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the nusselt number . through a quadratic fit we extrapolated to the background value of the total power in order to measure @xmath70 , from which we calculated @xmath67 from knowledge of the fluid properties .",
    "the values for @xmath67 in both regions agreed within the statistical error of the data , with the biggest difference being a bit less than 0.2% , _",
    "i.e. _ an order of magnitude less that the down shift of @xmath67 .",
    "the linear stability analysis @xcite for this system was carried out for a laterally infinite system using the coriolis force only and neglecting the centrifugal force . for @xmath31 ,",
    "our measured @xmath71 agreed well with this analysis as is seen in fig .",
    "[ cap : shiftedrc ] .",
    "similarly good agreement had been found earlier for @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "this is interesting because we do observe other centrifugal effects for @xmath72 , as discussed below . for @xmath73",
    "there was a clear downward shift of @xmath71 , relative to the theory and to experiments for smaller @xmath9 , of roughly 3% .",
    "this trend with @xmath9 indicates that the disagreement with theory can not be attributed to the finite size of the experimental systems because any finite - size effect on the onset should have been larger at smaller @xmath9 .",
    "thus it suggests that for @xmath73 the centrifugal force , which increases with increasing @xmath9 , has become strong enough to affect the onset .",
    "we quantified our analysis of the experimental images by utilizing the angular component @xmath74 of the local wave - director field computed with an algorithm described in ref .",
    "@xcite , but using higher angular resolution .",
    "figure [ cap : hybrid_state ] shows an example of @xmath74 overlayed on top of the shadowgraph pattern in false color .",
    "we used the variance field of @xmath74 , from a time series of consecutive images , to address the issue of which region of the pattern exhibits chaotic dynamics and which region is mostly dominated by near - stationary radial rolls .",
    "chaotic patterns exhibit a large variance because the roll orientation fluctuates constantly , but stationary rolls yield a small variance .",
    "the mean angular sum field is    @xmath75    where @xmath76 is the image index and @xmath77 is the number of images .",
    "the complex exponential introduces the necessary periodicity for summing angles and the factor of 2 treats the field as a director field instead of as a vector field .",

    "the variance field @xmath81 is approximately azimuthally symmetric for several investigated system sizes as shown in fig .",
    "[ cap : full_variance_field ] .",
    "there one sees for the larger two samples that the variance is large near the center and smaller near the side wall .",
    "figure [ cap : experiment_theta_variance ] displays @xmath82 , the azimuthal average of the angular variance field , for several system sizes . for the smallest experimental sample and for a simulation with matching parameters , both with @xmath34 , the large variance across the entire sample revealed the presence of domain chaos throughout .",
    "however , as seen in fig .",
    "[ cap : domain_chaos_images ] , even in this case the centrifugal force has reduced the domain size . likewise , the central region of the largest sample , with @xmath10 , exhibited a large variance .",
    "domain chaos dominated near this central region , but along the perimeter of the sample the variance was very small indicating coexistence with a more nearly stationary pattern .",
    "the variance for both the @xmath31 and @xmath10 samples showed a clear crossover from domain chaos to radial rolls , however the @xmath31 sample did not fully transition out of domain chaos even at the edge of the sample",
    ".    we also measured the size of the domain chaos region of the hybrid state by finding the width @xmath83 of @xmath82 chosen such that @xmath84 .",
    "figure [ cap : bwidth ] shows the @xmath21 dependence of @xmath83 . the behavior of @xmath85 ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : finalratio ] ) at small @xmath21 agrees with such @xmath21 dependence because of the factor @xmath86 in the denominator , associated with the coriolis force , which gives @xmath87 for small @xmath21 . the data in fig .",

    "might be expected due to the action of the coriolis force on the rayleigh - bnard rolls .",
    "the lsc itself would be expected to nearly align with the centrifugal force and thus should be nearly orthogonal to the side wall .",

    "as expected , fig .",
    "[ cap : dotproduct_with_sidewall ] shows that , as @xmath9 increases , the wave director along the edge of the sample indeed does become more nearly , but not perfectly , perpendicular to the sidewall normal . for the largest @xmath9 , @xmath91 reached a plateau around -0.8 , which corresponded to an angle of about @xmath92 , somewhat shy of a perpendicular angle .",

    "such behavior is indicative of the @xmath21 dependence of the relative strengths of the centrifugal and coriolis forces .",

    "this correction results in what is known as an unbiased correlation function , as opposed to the biased correlation function given when @xmath100 .",
    "both approaches have merits , in particular the biased form must be used for computing power spectra , but we prefer the unbiased form in the present case .",

    "[ cap : domain_chaos_images ] .",
    "the slight deviation at large separations should probably be disregarded due to lack of a sufficient quantity of data , even with the help of the unbiased form of the auto - correlation function to mitigate this issue .",
