    "a few definitions of the `` unconventional '' spectral classification of low mass stars and substellar objects are used in this paper : + * m - dwarfs  * are objects ( stars + young brown dwarfs ) with 4000 @xmath0 2200 k. their spectra are governed by molecular bands of tio and vo ( in the optical part of the spectrum ) , h@xmath1o ( in the red ) .",
    "+ * l - dwarfs  * are objects ( brown dwarfs + stars ) with 1000 @xmath2 @xmath3 @xmath2 2200 k ( cf .",
    "martin et al .",
    "optical spectra of l - dwarfs are governed by the k i + na i lines and molecular bands of crh + feh ( in the optical spectrum ) , h@xmath1o ( in the red ) . + * t - dwarfs  * are super - giant , planet - like objects ( big jupiters ? ) with t@xmath4 1000 k. their spectra are formed by the `` dusty opacities '' and methane + h@xmath1o + ... ?",
    "absorption ( strauss et al . 1999 , burgasser et al .",
    "1999 ) + for the time being most of the known brown dwarfs are actually recognized by the detection of the lii resonance doublet in their spectra ( rebolo et al .",
    "1996 , martn et al .",
    "1997a , kirkpatrick et al . 1999 ) .",
    "indeed , temperatures in the interiors of brown dwarfs are not high enough to burn lithium ( rebolo et al .",
    "the computations of synthetical spectra of m- and l - dwarfs are carried out by program wita5 , which is a modified version of the program wita31 used by pavlenko ( 1997 ) .",
    "the modifications were aimed to incorporate `` dusty effects '' that affect the chemical equilibrium and radiative transfer processes in very cool atmospheres .",
    "we have used the set of tsuji s ( 1999 ) `` dusty '' ( c - type ) lte model atmospheres .",
    "these models were computed for the case of segregation phase of dust and gas .",
    "chemical equilibrium was computed for the mix of @xmath5100 molecular species . to take into account the effect of the oversaturation",
    ", we reduced the abundances of those molecular species down to the equilibrium values ( pavlenko 1998 ) .    in l - dwarf atmospheres the additional opacity ( ado ) could appear due to molecular and/or dust absorption and/or scattering .",
    "we have modelled the additional opacity with a simple law of the form @xmath6 , with @xmath7= 1 -4 ( see pavlenko , zapatero osorio & rebolo 2000 for more details ) .",
    "lithium lines observed in spectra of the late m - dwarfs are well known tracers of their evolution .",
    "completely convective m - dwarfs are very effective lithium destroyers , therefore cool pre - main sequence ( pms ) stars are expected to preserve their initial lithium only during their first few million s years ( fig.3 , see also magazzu , rebolo & pavlenko 1992 , oppenheimer et al .",
    "1997 , pavlenko ( 1997 , 1997a ) , pavlenko & oppenheimer 1998 ) .",
    "lithium lines in spectra of m - dwarfs are formed at the background of mighty tio bands ( fig.1 ) .",
    "only cores of the saturated li lines may be observed in the real spectra ( pavlenko et al .",
    "1995 ) . to estimate of the abundance of lithium one may use `` pseudoequivalent widths '' of lithium lines , i.e. @xmath8 measured in respect to the local pseudocontinuum formed by molecular bands around li lines ( see also pavlenko 1997a ) .",
    "sure , the better way of the quantitatively determination log n(li ) is the use of synthetical spectra ( fig .",
    "due to depletion of the ti and vo into grains a structure of the optical spectra of l - dwarfs becomes more simple in comparison with m - dwarfs .",
    "the overall spectral energy distribution ( sed ) is governed by absorption of resonance doublets of k i and na i which have pressure broadened wings extended up to thousands (fig.3 ) .",
    "furthermore , pavlenko et al . ( 2000 ) showed that l - dwarf optical spectra are affected by the additional ( `` dusty '' ) absorption and/or scattering .",
    "our computations show that lithium lines are very sensitive to the additional absorption ( ado ) that we need to incorporate in the spectral synthesis if we want to explain the observed broad spectral energy distribution(fig.4 ) . in table 1",
    "we give the predicted equivalent widths @xmath8 of the lii resonance doublet at 670.8 nm for l - dwarf s model atmospheres ( 20001000k ) considered in this work .",
    "we found : +  in the ado - free case ( second column in the table ) , we would expect for the `` cosmic '' values of log n(li ) rather strong neutral li resonance lines in the spectra of objects as cool as denispj02051159 and gl229b .",
    "+  the chemical equilibrium of li - contained species still allow a sufficient number of li atoms to produce a rather strong resonance feature .     our computations indicate that l -dwarfs with moderate dust opacities should show the lii resonance doublet if they had preserved this element from nuclear burning , and consequently the lithium test can still be applied .",
    " temporal variations of the dusty opacities may originate some kind of `` meteorological '' phenomena occurring in these cool atmospheres .",
    "lithium lines ( as well other lines ) may be severely affected by the effect ( see pavlenko et al .",
    "2000 for more details ) .",
    ".equivalent widths of the lii resonance doublet at 670.8 nm computed for the c - type tsuji s ( 1999 ) model atmospheres , cosmic li abundance ( log@xmath7(li)=3.2 ) and gravity log@xmath9=5.0 .",
    "[ cols=\"^ , > , > , > \" , ]",
    "finally , we have arrived to the following conclusions :    * processes of formation of li lines in l- and m - spectra differ significantly : +  for m - dwarfs the main problem to be solved is blending of lithium lines by molecular lines , +  in the case of l - dwarfs we deal with a menagerie of different processes : depletion of lithium atoms into molecules and grains , `` dusty effects '' , meteorological phenomena , stratification effects , etc ... * we can fit the optical spectra of l - dwarfs in the frame of our simple model . * using our model we may perform a numerical analysis of the l - dwarf spectra ( at least in the sense of the li abundance determination ) . *",
    "the basic algorithm of the `` lithium test '' may be used even for the assessment of the coolest l - dwarfs .",
