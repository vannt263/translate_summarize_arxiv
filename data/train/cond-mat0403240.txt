    "one of the most remarkable recent developments in the study of ultracold bose gases is the observation of a reversible transition from a bose - einstein condensate to a state composed of localized atoms as the strength of a periodic , optical trapping potential is varied @xcite .",
    "this is an example of a quantum phase transition @xcite where quantum fluctuations and correlations rather than energy - entropy competition is the driving force and its theoretical understanding is quite challenging .",
    "the model usually considered for describing this phenomenon is the bose - hubbard model and the transition is interpreted as the superfluid - insulator transition that was studied in @xcite with an application to @xmath2 in porous media in mind .",
    "the possibility of applying this scheme to gases of alkali atoms in optical traps was first realized in @xcite .",
    "the article @xcite reviews these developments and many recent papers , e.g. , @xcite are devoted to this topic .",
    "these papers contain also further references to earlier work along these lines .",
    "the investigations of the phase transition in the bose - hubbard model are mostly based on variational or numerical methods and the signal of the phase transition is usually taken to be that an ansatz with a sharp particle number at each lattice site leads to a lower energy than a delocalized bogoliubov state . on the other hand , there exists no rigorous proof , so far , that the true ground state of the model has off - diagonal long range order at one end of the parameter regime that disappears at the other end . in the present paper",
    "we study a slightly different model where just this phenomenon can be rigorously proved and which , at the same time , captures the salient features of the experimental situation .",
    "the model is that of a hard core gas on a cubic lattice at half - filling ( i.e. , when the particle number is half the number of sites ) .",
    "the ` optical lattice ' is modeled simply by a periodic , one - body potential @xmath3 , where @xmath4 on the a - sublattice and @xmath5 on the b - sublattice .",
    "thus , the hamiltonian , expressed through bosonic creation and annihilation operators , equals @xmath6 the sites @xmath7 are in a @xmath8-dimensional hypercubic lattice , and @xmath9 stands for pairs of nearest neighbors . the case considered in this paper",
    "is the hard - core interaction @xmath10 .",
    "apart from the periodic potential , this is also the bose - hubbard model with infinite on - site repulsion .",
    "note that in our model the troughs of the optical potential correspond to the b - sublattice where the periodic potential is negative , and the crests correspond to the a - sublattice . often in the bose - hubbard model",
    "the whole lattice itself is used to approximate the troughs alone .",
    "roughly speaking , half - filling in our model corresponds to filling factor 1 in the bose - hubbard approximation .",
    "as is well known , the model ( [ hamiltonian ] ) with @xmath10 can also be viewed as the xy model of a spin 1/2 system @xcite .",
    "the periodic potential then corresponds to a staggered magnetic field .",
    "this will be explained in the next section .",
    "we are able to prove the following facts rigorously for 3 or more dimensions .",
    "the @xmath0-@xmath11-phase diagram at half - filling ( e.g. , mean density @xmath12 ) is shown schematically in figure  [ fig1 ] .    1 .",
    "if both @xmath0 and the temperature @xmath11 are small , then there is bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) . in this parameter regime",
    "the one - body density matrix has exactly one large eigenvalue ( in the thermodynamic limit ) , and the corresponding condensate wave function is @xmath13 [ bec ] 2 .",
    "if either @xmath11 or @xmath0 is big enough , then the correlation function ( the one - body density matrix ) decays exponentially , and hence there is _ no bec_. in particular , this applies to the ground state ( @xmath14 ) for @xmath0 big enough .",
    "[ nobec ] 3 .",
    "the mott insulator phase is characterized by a gap , i.e. , a jump in the chemical potential ( at zero temperature ) .",
    "we are able to prove this , at half - filling , for big enough @xmath0 .",
    "more precisely , there is a cusp in the dependence of the ground state energy on the number of particles ; adding or removing one particle costs a non - zero amount of energy .",
    "we also show that there is no such gap whenever there is bec.[item5 ] +    4 .",
    "the interparticle interaction is essential for items  [ nobec ] and  [ item5 ] .",
    "non - interacting bosons _ always display bec _ for low , but positive @xmath11 ( which depends on @xmath0 , of course ) .",
    "[ freegas ] 5 .   for all @xmath15 and all @xmath16 the diagonal part of the one - body density matrix @xmath17 is _ not constant_. its value on the a - sublattice is constant , but strictly less than its constant value on the b - sublattice ( for a finite system with periodic boundary conditions ) and this discrepancy survives in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "in contrast , in the regime mentioned in item  [ bec ] , the off - diagonal long - range order is constant , i.e. , @xmath18 for large @xmath19 .",
    "we give explicit expressions for the curves , sketched in figure  [ fig1 ] , defining the regimes for which the above statements are proved here ( see eqs .",
    "( [ beccurve ] ) and ( [ eq : highlt ] ) below . )",
    "we are not able to make a rigorous statement about the intermediate regime , but we believe that there is only a critical line separating the bec and the mott insulator phases .",
    "we focus here on lattice dimensions @xmath20 but , using the technique employed in @xcite , an extension to the ground state in two dimensions is possible .",
    "other possible extensions are mentioned in the next section .",
    "we write the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) of the lattice gas with @xmath10 in terms of the creation and annihilation operators , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , for particles at lattice site @xmath23 , with @xmath24 a finite hypercubic lattice with @xmath25 sites , @xmath26 being an even integer .",
    "we impose periodic boundary conditions . because of the hard - core condition",
    ", there is at most one particle at each site , and thus the creation and annihilation operators can be represented as @xmath27 matrices with @xmath28 for each @xmath29 .",
    "the correspondence with the spin matrices @xmath30 is @xmath31 and hence @xmath32 . adding a convenient constant to make the periodic potential positive , the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) for @xmath10 is thus equivalent to @xmath33 \\nonumber\\\\ & = & -\\sum_{\\langle { { \\bf x}}{{\\bf y}}\\rangle}(s^1_{{\\bf",

    "we postpone the proof of this assertion to appendix  [ apphalf ] .",
    "the presence or absence of bose - einstein condensation is expressed through the reduced one - particle density matrix @xmath37 where @xmath38 denotes the expectation value in the thermal equilibrium state or the ground state considered .",
    "bec occurs ( by definition ) if the @xmath39 matrix @xmath40 has an eigenvalue of order @xmath41 in the thermodynamic limit @xmath42 , @xmath43 , with @xmath44 fixed .",
    "we shall prove that for @xmath45 and @xmath20 the thermal equilibrium state of shows bose - einstein condensation for small @xmath0 and low temperature @xmath11 , while for large @xmath0 or @xmath11 the condensation disappears .",
    "for @xmath46 this is true only in the ground state . here",
    ", @xmath47 stands for the average density , since we are using the grand - canonical ensemble where the particle number is not fixed .",
    "note that we are not dealing here with a dilute system and the condensation is always depleted , even in the ground state .",

    "half - filling is essential .",
    "our analysis of the system proceeds via the following steps . in the next section  [ becproof ]",
    "we prove infrared bounds on the two - point function @xmath53 in momentum - space .",
    "the essential ingredient here is _",
    "reflection positivity _ of the hamiltonian and the closely related property of _ gaussian domination _ @xcite .",
    "the bound obtained depends on @xmath0 and the temperature .",
    "a sum rule fixes the sum over @xmath54 of the two - point function and the infrared bound leads to the conclusion that for small @xmath0 and low temperatures the contribution from @xmath1 remains non - vanishing in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "this proves bec .",
    "reflection positivity is essential for our proof of bec and forces the periodic potential to have period 2 .",
    "other generalizations can be accommodated , however , such as a more general lattice in which we add hopping to next nearest neighbors @xcite or the addition of nearest neighbor interparticle repulsion @xcite . for simplicity",
    "we concentrate here on the simple cubic lattice with on - site repulsion only .    in section  [ sectgap ]",
    "we show that the existence of bec implies the absence of an energy gap for adding or removing a particle , and that the energy viewed as a function of the density has a unique tangent at @xmath12 , i.e. , the chemical potential is continuous .    the absence of bec for large @xmath0 or high temperatures @xmath11 is proved in section  [ loops ] .",
    "the technique applied here is a path space representation of the two - point function that follows from the trotter product formula .",
    "this representation allows us to derive exponential decay of the two - point function , provided @xmath0 or @xmath11 are sufficiently large , and hence absence of long range order .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath0 or @xmath11 enters through the suppression in the path space integral of long contours connecting a pair of lattice points if these parameters are large .",
    "the same representation is used for proving the existence of a gap , as explained in item  [ item5 ] in the introduction .",
    "this method is quite robust and easily extends to a periodicity of the optical lattice potential different from 2 , for instance .    in section  [ stagdens ]",
    "we show that the particle density ( or @xmath55-component of the spin ) oscillates with the period of the staggered field if @xmath56 , in contrast to the condensate wave function which is independent of @xmath0 and @xmath7 . for this effect",
    "the interaction is essential , as remarked in section  [ sectfree ] . without the interaction",
    "there is _ always _ bec ( for low @xmath11 ) and the condensate wave function is _ never _ constant ( for @xmath56 ) .    in appendix",
    "[ apphalf ] , we shall prove that the ground state of has total spin 0 , which in the lattice gas language means that the lowest energy of is obtained when the particle number is @xmath57 .",
    "the essential ingredient in our proof is again reflection positivity of the hamiltonian .",
    "we also show that the canonical partition function is maximal at half - filling .",
    "in this section we are going to show the occurrence of bec for small @xmath0 and low enough temperature .",
    "the main result is the following .    [ thm1 ]",

    "moreover , if @xmath63 denotes the ( normalized ) eigenfunction corresponding to the largest eigenvalue of @xmath40 , then @xmath64 , implying that the condensate wave function is constant in the thermodynamic limit .    note that @xmath65 is finite for @xmath20 .",
    "since the largest eigenvalue of @xmath40 exceeds @xmath66 , bec is proved if the right side of the expression ( [ beccurve ] ) is positive .",
