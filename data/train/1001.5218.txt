    "big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) provides us with a unique window to the universe at redshifts of order @xmath6 @xcite . with the wmap determination of the baryon density of the universe @xcite",
    ", bbn has become a zero - parameter theory @xcite , leading to relatively precise predictions of the light element abundances of d , @xmath7he , @xmath8he , and @xmath9li @xcite .",
    "in addition to lending itself to scrutiny by comparing the predictions of bbn with observations , the resulting abundances are of significant scientific value in constraining the content and interactions of the universe during bbn @xcite .",
    "these constraints , however , generally require accurate determinations of the light element abundances , particularly in the case of 4 where better than 1% determinations are necessary .",
    "the difficulties in obtaining this precision for 4 is the focus of this paper .",
    "the concordance between bbn and observations of the cmb temperature anisotropies is predominantly due to the agreement between the bbn predicted primordial value of d / h compared with determinations made from observations of high redshift quasar absorption systems .",
    "the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) power spectrum provides a high precision measurement of the baryon density or equivalently the baryon - to - photon ratio , @xmath10 , ( primarily through the first and second acoustic peak heights ) . using the 5-year wmap value of @xmath11 or @xmath12 @xcite , one expects d / h @xmath13 @xcite which should be compared with @xmath14 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath9li is predicted to be substantially higher @xcite than determinations of 7 abundances in the outer layers of halo dwarf stars .",
    "this places extra emphasis on the determination of the primordial helium abundance , y@xmath3 . as a result of the very weak logarithmic relationship between @xmath10 and y@xmath3 , the measured error on y@xmath3",
    "must be very small ( @xmath15 ) to achieve a reasonable constraint on the determination of @xmath10 .",
    "for comparison , the wmap value of @xmath10 enables one to predict the value of y@xmath3 to within 0.08% .",
    "being relatively chemically unevolved , low metallicity h  ii regions in dwarf galaxies can be used to provide a measure of y@xmath3 .",
    "since metallicity only increases with age , these galaxies can be used to fit the helium abundance versus metallicity and therefore allows one to extrapolate back to very low values of o / h , used here as a surrogate for metallicity , corresponding to the primordial helium abundance @xcite . however , after more than three decades of work in determining the abundance using this method , the measurements frequently have not agreed with each other and until recently , post - wmap , have not been in accordance with the wmap value ( see figure [ yp_t ] below ) , @xmath16 , which is based on the bbn calculation of @xcite assuming the wmap determined value of @xmath10 .",
    "the quoted errors in the extragalactic determination of y@xmath3 have been historically very small in comparison to the range in the results ( again see figure [ yp_t ] ) .",
    "the early determinations of y@xmath17 focused on statistical errors in the measured helium line fluxes and , as a result , underestimated the error .",
    "ideally , the target quantity , the helium to hydrogen ratio ( y@xmath18 ) in extragalactic h  ii regions , would directly follow from an observed helium to hydrogen emission line ratio",
    ". however , as a result of interstellar reddening , underlying stellar absorption , optical depth , and collisional corrections , the actual determination of y@xmath19 is complicated , and the true uncertainty can be large .",
    "interstellar reddening occurs as the photons are scattered by dust on their journey . being a wavelength dependent process ,",
    "each line is affected differently .",
    "the stellar continuum juxtaposes absorption features under nebular emission lines .",
    "the h  ii region itself can absorb some of the emitted photons as well .",
    "finally , the total emission fluxes are due to both recombination and collisional excitation . in the case of the hydrogen emission",
    ", only the small fraction of recently recombined neutral atoms can contribute to collisional emission .",
    "unfortunately , these confounding processes can not be directly measured .",
    "in addition , the temperature , which determines the physical rates , can not be determined directly and independently unless it is assumed to be perfectly uniform throughout the h  ii region .",
    "our ignorance of these necessary physical model parameters will necessarily inhibit the determination of y@xmath19 and therefore correspond to potentially large increases in the error on that determination .",
    "the error on y@xmath17 also varies widely due to sample sizes .",
    "the error on the intercept , y@xmath17 , will shrink with increasing number of regression points ; however , poor quality spectra do not allow for a robust estimation of the systematic effects listed above . therefore , this work focuses on a small number of `` high quality '' extragalactic objects .",
    "previous work by @xcite in @xcite and @xcite , following the `` self - consistent '' methods of @xcite in determining the electron density ( used for the collisional correction ) and @xcite in determining the electron temperature ( used for the helium emissivities ) , addressed some of the systematic effects by solving for physical conditions via a minimization of the differences between the values of y@xmath19 calculated from each of the helium lines .",
    "the @xmath20 minimization is accomplished by a down - hill simplex algorithm .",
    "monte carlo simulations over the input fluxes were used to measure the statistical variance with the ultimate effect of further increasing the total uncertainty .",
    "details of the determination of the model parameters and the impact of the monte carlo process on these parameters will be discussed further in section [ determining y ] below .    the purpose of the current work is to explore further refinements to the approach of papers i & ii . first , there now exist improvements to the atomic data ( * ? ? ? * pfm ) that can be incorporated ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter its07 & plp07 respectively ) .",
    "second , previously , the flux ratios of the hydrogen lines were used to solve for reddening and underlying hydrogen absorption , while the flux ratios of the helium lines were used to solve for density , temperature , underlying helium absorption , helium self - absorption , and the helium abundance .",
    "there is no need to solve for these two sets of parameters separately , and doing so artificially suppresses any potential degeneracies between them .",
    "thus , here we explore the effects of combining two separate `` self - consistent '' approaches into one .",
    "third , the previous work assumed identical values of equivalent width of underlying absorption for all h  i or he  i emission lines , regardless of wavelength , and here we investigate the effects of a wavelength dependence in the underlying stellar absorption ( e.g. , its07 ) .",
    "fourth , we study the effects of correcting for the collisional emission from neutral hydrogen ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the second change , the integration of the hydrogen and helium , is a calculational procedure modification , while the other three are improvements in the modeling of the physical processes that impact the observed hydrogen and helium emission lines . detailing the incorporation of these four effects and investigation of their impact is the primary aim of this paper and is discussed in sections [ determining y]-[nhcc ] . in section [ icfs ]",
    ", we discuss the importance of ionization correction factors .",
    "section [ results ] presents a new determination of the primordial helium abundance resulting from the reprocessing of the observations studied in with comparison to those results , and the results reported in its07 and plp07 .",
    "section [ discussion ] details the effect of the enhancements , remaining errors , and possibilities for future improvements .",
    "as described in , six measured helium emission line fluxes ( @xmath213889 , 4026 , 4471 , 5876 , 6678 , and 7065 ) relative to @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) and their equivalent widths ( @xmath24 ) are used to determine the helium abundance .",
    "corrections are made for reddening , underlying absorption , collisional enhancement , and radiative transfer : y^+ = 10^f()c(h ) , where @xmath25 is the emissivity ratio of h@xmath26 to the helium line . in the approach of papers",
    "i and ii , the reddening relative to h@xmath26 ( c(h@xmath26 ) ) and underlying hydrogen absorption ( a@xmath27 ) are determined separately by monte carlo over the three hydrogen line ratios ( @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 ) . ) , are calculated from the extinction fits of @xcite . ]",
    "the optical depth function _",
    "@xmath31 _ , and collisional to recombination emission ratio _",
    "@xmath32 _ are both temperature and density dependent ( the emissivities are also temperature dependent )",
    ". therefore the physical parameters needed for the corrections are electron density ( n@xmath33 ) , underlying helium absorption ( a@xmath34 , corrected for in terms of equivalent width ) , optical depth ( @xmath35 ) , and temperature ( t ) .",
    "the parameters are determined simultaneously with the abundance by minimizing @xmath20 , defined as the weighted difference between each helium line s abundance and the average .",
    "this minimization is performed for each realization in a monte carlo over the input helium line fluxes and equivalent widths .",
    "an important result of the monte carlo analysis was the discovery of degeneracies in the sense that the fit parameters were not always independently constrained",
    ". in particular , the temperature and density exhibited a trade - off whereby increasing the temperature while decreasing the density would leave the @xmath20 relatively unchanged .",
    "the reason for this can be seen in the form of the emissivities ( see  [ updated emissivities ] ) .",
    "four of the lines show similar exponential dependencies on temperature and density . as a result ,",
    "the abundance from these lines shifts correspondingly for changes in temperature and density .    to demonstrate the importance of the degeneracy between temperature and density , characteristic model parameters and a helium abundance were chosen and used to generate synthetic flux data .",
    "@xmath20 was then calculated keeping the abundance and all of the traditional fit parameters fixed except for the density and temperature .",
    "the impact of trading the density against the temperature can be clearly seen in figure [ x2 ] which illustrates a well constrained quotient of density and temperature but a @xmath36 boundary spanning a temperature range of 5500 k , a density range of 275 @xmath37 , and an abundance variation of 10% .",
    "the shallow , extended minimum results in a large range of best fit parameters for the density and temperature upon the monte carlo perturbation , and the abundance gains a much larger uncertainty ( see figure [ y_d_mc ] below ) . only by solving for these two parameters simultaneously can this degeneracy be discovered .    the inclusion of wavelength dependent absorption , now _",
    "a@xmath38 _ and _ a@xmath39 _ , and neutral hydrogen collisional emission , _",
    "@xmath40 _ , will modify the helium to hydrogen ratio as , y^+ = 10^f()c(h ) .",
    "the wavelength dependent absorption is included in order to model variations in the amount of stellar absorption and is represented by a relative coefficient for each line .",
    "the neutral hydrogen collisional emission is included to account for the small population of non - ionized hydrogen which can therefore undergo collisional emission .",
    "this process is composed of the temperature dependent collisional excitation and the cascade of downward transitions and requires the introduction of a new parameter , the neutral to ionized hydrogen density fraction , @xmath41 . in ,",
    "this was assumed to be negligible .",
    "primarily , the neutral hydrogen collisional emission corrects the hydrogen lines but through h@xmath26 shows up in the abundance .",
    "the integration of the hydrogen reddening and helium abundance calculation is in principle accomplished by simply summing their @xmath20 contributions and minimizing over the now expanded set of physical parameters ( n@xmath33 , a@xmath34 , @xmath35 , t , c(h@xmath26 ) , a@xmath27 , @xmath41 ) simultaneously .",
    "the combined @xmath20 is given by , ^2 = _ + _ ( y^+ ( ) - |y)^2 ( ) ^2 [ eq : x2 ] where , x_r ( ) = 10^f()c(h ) |y = _ y^+ ( ) ( ) ^2 / _ 1 ( ) ^2 .",
    "x@xmath42 represents the corrected hydrogen flux , x@xmath43 the theoretical hydrogen emission , @xmath44 the average helium abundance , and @xmath45 is calculated from the measured statistical error and equivalent width error .    in our analysis",
    "below , we use the same dataset of h  ii regions as in for calculating y@xmath19 and extracting y@xmath3 .",
    "those galaxies were chosen from the ( * ? ? ?",
    "* it98 ) sample with screening to minimize uncertainties in underlying absorption , to select only low o / h systems , and to avoid contamination by galactic na  i absorption .",
    "in addition to those seven targets , ngc  346a @xcite , which was also examined in , and i  zw  18 ( its07 ) are analyzed .",
    "this allows for a comparison with each of the five targets used in plp07 .",
    "all nine except ngc  346 are included in the recent large sample of its07 .",
    "the spectrum for mrk  193 originally reported in @xcite and used in @xcite has been reanalyzed and the results of the new analyses are reported in @xcite .",
    "here we use the newly analyzed spectrum for mrk  193 .",
    "each object is analyzed with the new corrections applied successively to the procedure used in .",
    "the analysis is conducted with the parameter space restricted to physically meaningful values , and monte carlo average values and standard deviations are returned for the model parameters and abundance . reflecting a straightforward improvement in the atomic data and modeling ,",
    "first the updated emissivities are used in conjunction with separate hydrogen reddening and helium abundance calculations .",
    "next , the hydrogen and helium calculations are combined into one integrated calculation .",
    "the third change is to introduce the slight wavelength dependence in the underlying absorption .",
    "finally , the correction for neutral hydrogen collisional emission is incorporated . in the following sections , each of these enhancements",
    "is first discussed theoretically and then applied to the dataset .",
    "pfm have recently provided improved helium emissivity fits , as a function of temperature , and collisional contributions , as a function of temperature and density , based upon the most recent atomic data ( see * ? ? ?",
    "they report broad agreement between these emissivities and their plasma simulation code cloudy @xcite of better than 0.03% within the temperature range @xmath46 .",
    "however , the abundance determination also requires the h@xmath26 emissivity . though not in the scope of the published paper , r. l. porter ( private communication ) , provided us with the h@xmath26 emissivity in terms of the published paper s parameterization , e(h ) = [ -2.658410 ^ 5 - 1420.9  ( t)^2 + 35,546  t + ]  t^-1 .    in implementing these new emissivities the following difficulty",
    "was encountered during @xmath20 minimization .",
    "as parameterized by pfm , the density dependence of the emissivities weakens with increasing density , ultimately becoming negligible .",
    "while this occurs at densities which are unreasonably high for our objects , the addition of the temperature - density degeneracy can and does lead to densities that increase nearly without bound . in practice ,",
    "the monte carlo realizations were often found to tend to higher densities that were unconstrained by the form of the emissivities ( in a region beyond their applicability ) .",
    "the resulting @xmath20 for these solutions decreased only marginally with the large increase in density ; so the result is effectively an equivalent solution but which is physically meaningless . upon calculating the monte carlo average , even a small number ( @xmath15 ) bias the returned values , especially the density , to an unacceptable degree . the density dependence in the optical depth function disfavors ever increasing density but only if the optical depth itself does not approach zero .",
    "refitting the emissivities , with the collisional correction , to the form of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* bss ) avoids the pitfall while sacrificing less than 1% accuracy in the region of interest , @xmath47 and @xmath48 , and compares favorably with the bss fit accuracy .",
    "therefore , within the physically applicable region for our objects , the emissivity values themselves are nearly identical to those of pfm . at large densities",
    "however , the exponential dependence on the density relegates ever increasing densities to ever increasing @xmath20 . in effect , the re - parameterized fit protects the @xmath20 minimization from unphysical solutions while retaining the numerical accuracy in the physical region .",
    "figures [ emissivity ] and [ emissivityrelative ] below compare the bss fits used in with the new fits .",
    "the re - parameterized helium emissivities , including the collisional correction and scaled to h@xmath26 , are ,    @xmath49      in addition to the updated helium emissivities , the theoretical hydrogen emission line ratios taken from @xcite , were refit to incorporate the reported ( very weak ) density dependence . in principle , this is included for consistency , but became of particular interest in physically describing the impact of higher density so as to disfavor non - physical solutions .",
    "the previous logarithmic form in temperature was retained and employed for the density fit .",
    "the expanded equations are as follows ( with table [ table : hemiss ] listing the coefficients ) ,    x_t = _ ij c_ij ( ( t_4))^i ( ( d))^j +    .1 in    .coefficients for the hydrogen emissivities , @xmath50 [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      a comparison of the resulting he abundances using bss and pfm is shown in figure [ y_progression_ue ] .",
    "the updated emissivities , including the collisional correction , in general raise the calculated abundance of helium .",
    "however , because the changes in different lines are qualitatively different ( again see figures [ emissivity ] & [ emissivityrelative ] ) , the update does not categorically raise the abundance .",
    "for @xmath214471 , 5876 , and 6678 , the h@xmath26 to he emissivity is increased rather uniformly ( 2 - 3% ) across the relevant temperature range in comparison with those of bss .",
    "all three lines exhibit a gradual increase with temperature .",
    "the behavior of @xmath214026 is similar except that the new emissivity is shifted to lower values .",
    "@xmath213889 is more complicated in that the emissivity is reduced at low temperatures but is enhanced at @xmath51 16,000 k. @xmath217065 is similar , though the enhancement begins at 13,000 k. broadly , @xmath213889 , @xmath217065 , and @xmath214471 track the bss emissivities more closely ( within @xmath5 2% ) than the other three lines .",
    "therefore , upon repeating the analysis with the new emissivities , these lines will favor returning a similar abundance .",
    "the three strongest lines with the smallest relative errors will produce a larger abundance , thus raising the average abundance . to decrease the discrepancy between the @xmath213889 and 7065 and @xmath214471 , 5876 , and 6678 abundances ,",
    "the temperature will decrease , thus lowering the average abundance slightly .",
    "the weak @xmath214026 is shifted opposite to the three strongest lines , but still can have a significant impact as described below .",
    "as anticipated , in most cases , the updated emissivities of pfm raise the abundance ( see figure [ y_progression_ue ] ) .",
    "this was observed by plp07 and its07 .",
    "though , on average , the abundance increases by @xmath51% , three of the objects actually exhibit slightly decreased helium abundances .",
    "the decreased abundances of sbs  940 + 544n and sbs  1159 + 545 can be explained by discrepant high @xmath214026 fluxes .",
    "this has been demonstrated using synthetic data , and using the parameters from for these two objects , we estimate that @xmath214026 fluxes may be high by 15% and 10% respectively .",
    "note that the typical uncertainties in the equivalent widths of the @xmath214026 lines and the corrections for underlying absorption are both comparable in magnitude to this suspected discrepancy .",
    "overall , in comparison to bss , the pfm emissivities favor a compromise whereby the temperature decreases and the average abundance increases .",
    "however , as we have seen , this effect is not uniform and an overly strong @xmath214026 can cause the abundance to decrease .",
    "thus , the regression performed on the seven objects of yields a slightly _ lower _ intercept as indicated in figure [ y_progression_ue ] .",
    "it is also worth noting that for all nine objects the temperature decreases as expected .",
    "since this temperature decrease blunts the abundance increase , calculations based on temperatures not determined simultaneously with the abundance would exhibit a more pronounced abundance increase upon replacing the bss emissivities with those of pfm .",
    "qualitatively very similar to bss , the new emissivities do not dramatically shift the abundances or their pattern .",
    "the more accurate atomic data is a distinct improvement but is not the primary limitation in determining the abundance .",
    "in papers i & ii , the spectra are analyzed in a two step approach .",
    "first the hydrogen lines are used in conjunction with the temperature as determined by [ o  iii ] emission to determine the reddening parameter and underlying hydrogen absorption .",
    "these two corrections are then applied to the helium to h@xmath26 input flux ratios .",
    "subsequently , these corrected lines are used to determine the density , helium absorption , optical depth , and temperature simultaneously with the abundance .",
    "this separation is natural as the dominant hydrogen line correction is for reddening .",
    "this allows the helium spectra to be corrected for interstellar effects before resolving the competing nebular emission and absorption effects on the helium lines .",
    "however , the independence of these calculations is artificially imposed and could impair the abundance calculation . since reddening impacts both the hydrogen and helium fluxes ( and in the same way ) , it should be a minimization parameter for both .",
    "furthermore , even though the hydrogen emissivity ratios are only weakly temperature dependent , the estimated electron temperature is as physically meaningful for the hydrogen emission as for helium .    in order that the calculations be truly self - consistent , the hydrogen and helium based calculations are combined into a single minimization .",
    "this has the advantage of being sensitive to all degeneracies .",
    "conceptually the implementation of combining the two calculations is straightforward .",
    "nine line ratios are now input , and all seven physical parameters ( n@xmath33 , a@xmath34 , @xmath35 , t , c(h@xmath26 ) , a@xmath27 , @xmath41 ) are determined simultaneously with the abundance via a single minimization .",
    "equation [ eq : x2 ] explicitly gives this combined @xmath20 ; though , for this section the neutral hydrogen collisional correction is not yet included .",
    "the previously observed degeneracies provide a further impetus for integrating the hydrogen line based reddening calculation with the actual abundance calculation .",
    "the larger parameter space allows for new degeneracies but the additional calculational effects could break them .",
    "an important detail of this process is that the deblending of he(@xmath213889 ) and h8 can now be done consistently based upon the solution for reddening and temperature .",
    "previously , in the sequential analysis , he(@xmath213889 ) is deblended using a the hydrogen reddening parameters and a fixed temperature . as a result , even though the helium lines are used to determine the temperature , the he(@xmath213889 ) flux could not be adjusted to account for this temperature change .",
    "this effect is very small since the h8/h@xmath26 emissivity is only very weakly temperature dependent ( @xmath52 , from a fit to the data of * ? ? ?",
    ". however , integration allows the blended input flux to be deblended during the @xmath20 calculation using the solved hydrogen underlying absorption , reddening , and temperature . in this way",
    ", the deblending itself affects the @xmath20 and therefore the relevant parameter solutions .",
    "the @xmath53 flux is calculated by correcting the blended input for underlying absorption in h8 , reddening the h8 intensity fraction , and subtracting it , = -0.104  t_4 ^ 0.046  10 ^ -f(3889)c(h ) ( the same fraction is also subtracted from the equivalent width ) .",
    "the error on this flux is not decreased so as to take the most conservative approach . also , the errors on the equivalent widths , not being reported , are taken to be the larger of 10% or twice the fractional error in the flux .",
    "though the theoretical grounds for integrating the helium and hydrogen @xmath20 minimizations are sound , this guarantees no practical benefit , and , in fact , the expansion of monte carlo and parameter space warns of more freedom for non - physical realizations .",
    "synthetic testing provides some insight since the actual physical parameters are known .",
    "characteristic values are chosen and used with the model equations to generate corresponding fluxes for all nine line ratios .",
    "for this analysis , n@xmath33 = 100 @xmath37 , a@xmath34 = 1.0  , @xmath35 = 1.0 , t = 18,000 k , c(h@xmath26 ) = 0.1 , a@xmath27 = 1.0  , and @xmath41 = 1.0 x 10@xmath54 , were used in conjunction with ew(h@xmath26 ) = 250   and y@xmath19 = 0.08 .",

    "each does as do their most strongly coupled parameters , the density and underlying hydrogen absorption .",
    "integration improves the accuracy of the temperature marginally , but with a significantly larger uncertainty due to the added temperature dependence of the hydrogen lines .",
    "the reddening parameter , c(h@xmath26 ) is essentially unchanged . the slight improvement for the reddening results from its weaker sensitivity to perturbation due to its equal impact upon the helium and hydrogen lines .",
    "since both the reddening and the hydrogen absorption affect the weaker hydrogen lines more strongly , they are tightly coupled such that a more accurate and precise reddening correspondingly benefits the hydrogen absorption . the less accurate density with accompanying larger uncertainty stems from the previously discussed temperature - density degeneracy .",
    "the more uncertain temperature leads to the increased density uncertainty ; while the non - linear nature of their trade - off biases the returned density .",
    "the benefit of the more accurate parameters propagates to the abundance determination , improving from 0.08024 @xmath4 0.00268 to 0.07995 @xmath4 0.00324 ( 99.7% to 99.9% ) .",
    "the greater variance in the density and temperature , however , leads to an increased error bar .",
    "overall , the effect of combining the helium and hydrogen calculations , on well - behaved spectra , is weak ( and consistent at a set of higher and lower model parameters , though the sequential algorithm sometimes gives the marginally better abundance ) .",
    "the most notable feature is the similarity in the returned results , excepting a more pronounced effect of degeneracy in the density and temperature uncertainty .    in the above synthetic analysis ,",
    "both the sequential and integrated approaches achieve a well minimized hydrogen and helium @xmath20 .",
    "however , in real data , because the reddening and underlying hydrogen absorption both increase the flux ratio for the wavelengths shorter than h@xmath26 ( and both decrease @xmath28 ) , minimization on the hydrogen lines alone may produce a relatively large @xmath20 .",
    "then upon integration , the combination of the temperature dependent hydrogen emissivities , which were previously evaluated at the fixed [ o  iii ] temperature , and the density - temperature degeneracy may lead the derived temperature to deviate from the sequential value .",
    "the hydrogen @xmath20 exerts new pressure upon the temperature , but the weak ( logarithmic ) temperature dependence requires a large temperature adjustment . as a result , the temperature can slide substantially to reduce the hydrogen @xmath20 while maintaining the helium @xmath20 by inversely adjusting the density .",
    "the possibility for exactly this behavior is a primary example of the necessity of accounting for systematic error via monte carlo in calculating the abundance error .",
    "the resulting changes in the helium abundance in our nine objects due to the integration of the minimization procedure is shown in figure [ y_progression_int ] . as evidenced in the preceding subsection , integration of the hydrogen and helium calculations",
    "could potentially yield significant changes to the temperature or reddening ; however , for all objects , except one , the solved reddening was similar after integration to the result of .",
    "the reddening for ngc  346 decreased from the value of 0.174 to 0.156 , which is a difference of about two sigma .",
    "this raises the helium abundance , as two of the three strong he lines are redder than h@xmath26 .",
    "the temperature changed significantly post integration for the three most metal poor objects ( see figure [ y_progression_int ] ) .",
    "i  zw  18 showed a temperature increase ( 10,700 to 17,300 k ) and a resulting increased abundance .",
    "this difference in temperature is significant , and results in an increase in the helium abundance of about 1.5 sigma .",
    "note , however , that i  zw  18 was not included in the original `` high quality '' dataset of paper ii because it did not meet two of the criteria ( ew(h@xmath26 ) and redshift ) , so this is likely due more to the quality of the spectrum and the looser constraint on the derived temperature .",
    "nonetheless , the newly derived temperature is much more in line with that expected from the temperature derived from observations of the [ o  iii ] emission lines .",
    "however , the derived temperatures for sbs  0335 - 052 and sbs  940 + 544n both decreased significantly ( 16,200 to 10,700 k and 18,500 to 12,800 k respectively ) and showed corresponding helium abundance decreases .",
    "the newly derived temperatures are significantly different from those indicated by the [ o  iii ] emission lines .",
    "the magnitude of the effect on the abundance due to the temperature change for these three objects is apparent in figure [ y_progression_int ] . as discussed above , these shifting temperatures result from the combination of the temperature dependent hydrogen emissivities with the density - temperature degeneracy .",
    "temperature changes allow the hydrogen @xmath20 another degree of freedom for minimization , and the density compensates within the helium @xmath20 .",
    "this is supported by the fact that each of the above objects shows a larger contribution to the total @xmath20 from the hydrogen lines than from the helium lines .",
    "apart from inconsistency between the temperature and density used for the hydrogen based corrections , integration would necessarily decrease the total @xmath20 , in validation of the procedure .",
    "the total @xmath20 of eight of nine objects does decrease ( sbs 1159 + 545 increases from 1.35 to 1.70 ) , but the large parameter variation witnessed is of concern .",
    "this provides further evidence for the importance of addressing the temperature - density degeneracy .",
    "stellar absorption underlying the helium emission lines has long been recognized as potentially leading to underestimates of their measured fluxes . @xcite and @xcite all demonstrated examples of how failure to correct for underlying stellar absorption in the he  i lines resulted in underestimates of nebular helium abundances . however , correcting for the effects of underlying he  i absorption is not straightforward ( see discussions in * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in @xcite , the simplest possible approach",
    "was suggested : namely , the assumption that the equivalent widths of all of the he  i absorption lines were identical and could be obtained through the @xmath57 minimization for that value .",
    "the assumption of identical equivalent widths has merit since these lines are usually saturated in the stars that are producing them , and so the main problem is to essentially find a scaling factor to determine what fraction of the continuum is produced by the stars with these saturated lines . an alternative method is to use model stellar photospheres to produce an estimate of the relative strengths of the underlying absorption . in the second method",
    ", one needs estimates of the ages and metallicities of the stars and , in addition , the fraction of the continuum due to the stars .",
    "note that the large equivalent widths of the balmer lines in the `` high quality '' sample indicate that a significant fraction of the continuum is nebular , so the assumption of a purely stellar continuum is not entirely correct .",
    "there is evidence for two significant departures from the simplest assumption of identical equivalent widths of underlying he  i absorption .",
    "first , observations of stars indicate variations of order a factor of two ( see discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) between different he  i lines , and this is also seen in the model stellar atmospheres .",
    "second , different populations of stars contribute differently to different parts of the spectrum ( i.e. , young blue stars account for more of the blue continuum and older red stars account for more of the red continuum ) .",
    "if the stellar populations in the galaxies observed were single epoch bursts , then one could neglect the contributions to the continuum from different aged stellar populations .",
    "however , it is becoming clear that the bursts of star formation that give rise to the bright h  ii regions typically studied have durations of order 100 myr or longer ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "since the he  i absorption lines are formed in the bluer stars , the red continuum will have larger contributions from older populations , and thus , the equivalent widths of the redder he  i lines will be weaker than predicted from models .    in order to investigate the possible limitations of assuming identical equivalent widths of underlying stellar he  i absorption , we constructed models of the emission from simple stellar populations using the violent star formation legacy tool `` sed@ '' .",
    "the code used the input models from @xcite and @xcite , and he  i absorption line strengths as a function of stellar population age were examined .",
    "we then derived relative equivalent widths which were suitable over a large range of ages and these are presented here .",
    "we also did this for the h  i absorption lines , although the variation is much smaller .",
    "the wavelength dependence of underlying absorption in terms of equivalent width for the hydrogen lines is normalized to h@xmath26 while he @xmath214471 is used for the helium lines .",
    "those normalization values then represent the varying physical model parameters , a@xmath27 and a@xmath34 , @xmath58 the value at h9 is also needed to successfully deblend he(@xmath213889 ) .",
    "a linear fit to the four hydrogen values above provides a value of 0.882 .",
    "our main goal here is to determine the relative importance of a secondary correction to the assumption of identical equivalent widths for underlying absorption .",
    "thus , the precise choice of the wavelength dependence of the underlying absorption is not nearly as important as an assessment of the effect .",
    "figure [ y_progression_ua ] shows the impact of assuming the wavelength dependent absorption given above .",
    "when comparing individual objects , in most cases there is no significant effect on the abundance . for most of the objects",
    "there is a very slight downward shift , presumably due to smaller corrections to the @xmath215876 and @xmath216678 lines .",
    "since this effect is only a small correction to the underlying absorption which itself is relatively weak , the minor impact is in agreement with expectations .",
    "note that the impact is minor in large part due to the selection of targets for the `` high quality '' sample . by requiring large emission line equivalent widths for the targets ,",
    "we ensure that this intrinsically uncertain correction will be small .",
    "note that there are two objects where the difference caused by the new assumption is noticeable : sbs  0335 - 052 and ngc  346 . in the case of sbs  0335 - 052",
    ", we note that the solution changes with almost every small change in assumptions that we test .",
    "this spectrum indicates a significant amount of self absorption in the helium lines , and , for large values of self - absorption our model is very uncertain . for ngc  346 ,",
    "the uncertainties are very small , so even small changes in assumptions have noticeable effects on the solution .",

    "our derived densities are lower than those of plp07 with correspondingly higher abundances .",
    "the only object not in agreement is ngc  346 .",
    "the solution for ngc  346 exhibits susceptibility to large variance , relative to its small uncertainty .",
    "our primary interest is the primordial helium abundance ( mass fraction ) , y@xmath3 . to extrapolate back to a primordial value , the oxygen to hydrogen mass fraction , o / h , calculated in , is used in conjunction with y , the helium mass fraction , including a correction for y@xmath89 .",
    "such that @xmath90 the relevant values are listed in table [ table : ph ] .",
    "analyzed ngc  346 but did not include it in the regression because its more evolved chemical nature invokes more error in assuming a linear relationship between y@xmath19 and o / h .",
    "i  zw  18 was not analyzed in both because of its low equivalent width for h@xmath26 ( @xmath91 ) making it susceptible to large corrections for underlying absorption and because of it s radial velocity making it susceptible to contamination by galactic na  i absorption . a linear regression of y for the seven targets of versus o / h yields , y_p = 0.2561 0.0108 , [ eq : yp ] with slope 9 @xmath4 192 and @xmath20 = 2.0 .",
    "this result is shown in figure [ y_oh ] .",
    "given the large uncertainty , this agrees well with the wmap result of @xmath16",
    ". found @xmath92 .",
    "the increased intercept and error of this work is directly attributable to y@xmath19 increasing for six targets and an uncertainty increase for four .",
    "the slope is similar to that found in ( 54 @xmath4 187 ) and still consistent with zero . given the short baseline , a mean evaluation yields , y_p = 0.2566 0.0028 for seven which is very similar to the bayesian result @xcite of @xmath93 .    because of the large uncertainty in y , equation ( [ eq : yp ] ) is in agreement with plp07 , @xmath94 , using pfm , and its07 , @xmath95 , using bss rescaled to pfm emissivities .",
    "the striking , larger error found here ( as in paper ii ) in comparison to plp07 and its07 is attributable to use of an unrestricted monte carlo , the application of all systematic corrections simultaneously , and a smaller population of objects ( than its07 ) .",
    "i  zw  18 is below the regression line and , being the lowest metallicity point , it would lower the intercept and raise the slope .",
    "ngc  346 would extended the o / h domain and decrease the uncertainty in both the intercept and slope .",
    "if both regions are included , we would find , @xmath96 , with a slope of @xmath97 .    as noted earlier",
    ", the inclusion of the neutral hydrogen collisional correction has a large impact on the result . as seen in figure [ y_progression_nh ] , the same seven object regression performed using the analysis with @xmath41 = 0 yields a lower tighter intercept of , @xmath98 .",
    "though not desirable , the spread of the results with and without the neutral hydrogen correction highlights the dominance of systematic effects and therefore the necessity of quantifying the full effect the associated error .",
    "since the main goal of this paper is an improved assessment of the errors on the helium abundances derived from spectra of metal poor h  ii regions , it is useful to compare the sizes of the error bars determined in this study with those determined from the same spectra in other studies . figure [ y_errs ] shows the sizes of the total errors associated with each helium abundance determination for all of the objects studied here .",
    "one surprising result of this comparison is that the relative size of the errors is a strong function of oxygen abundance for _ all _ studies . to our knowledge , this has never been seen or discussed before .",
    "one possible explanation is that the most metal poor objects with suitably bright h  ii regions are relatively rare , so that the quality of the spectra for these objects may be lower .",
    "note also that typically the errors that we derive for each spectrum are larger than previously derived by others .",
    "the errors derived by its07 are typically the smallest , and this is directly attributable to their method of deriving the electron temperature which limits that value to a relatively small range . plp07",
    "derive electron temperatures in a similar method to ours , but do not include a monte carlo analysis of the errors .",
    "thus , the errors of plp07 are typically intermediate to those of its07 and those presented here .",

    "the preceding work in papers i and ii emphasized the importance of the systematic uncertainties in calculating y@xmath19 and the need for monte carlo analysis . extending that work to allow for self - consistent analysis reflecting the common temperature and reddening parameters between the hydrogen and helium lines does not diminish the importance of the systematic uncertainties or the case for the larger errors determined via monte carlo .",
    "in fact , the addition of the neutral hydrogen collisional emission , introduced with a new physical parameter , the neutral hydrogen fraction , highlights that abundance errors may be even larger than previously thought .",
    "in addition to the need for observations to constrain systematic uncertainty as much as possible , sections [ updated emissivities ] & [ integrated ] both demonstrate the significant impact that relatively small systematic errors in the observed fluxes , even of the weakest lines , can have on y@xmath19 . clearly high quality spectra are critical for meaningful analysis .    given higher resolution spectra ,",
    "the emission line fluxes could be measured separately from the effects of underlying absorption .",
    "this is possible due to collisional broadening of the stellar absorption lines , such that the emission line can be measured relative to its local continuum . in other words ,",
    "the absorption effect in the continuum would be visible in depth and extent with a narrow emission line at the minimum . as a result",
    "the flux could be measured relative to the absorption feature rather than the broader continuum .",
    "the underlying helium and hydrogen ( through @xmath22 ) lines both directly impact the abundance determination .",
    "furthermore , decreasing the number of solution parameters ( by eliminating the parameters associated with underlying absorption ) will in general decrease the uncertainty .",
    "therefore , an improvement in the abundance determination is ensured .",
    "typically , underlying balmer emission is much easier to detect in the spectrum of a metal poor h  ii region than underlying he  i emission , so starting with eliminating the correction for underlying balmer absorption is the most promising .    though difficult to gauge theoretically , some insight into the degree of improvement from more accurate measurements can be gained through synthetic data . assuming a typical value of 1.0   for the underlying hydrogen and helium absorption",
    ", we can generate corresponding fluxes when the remaining parameters are chosen . for @xmath136 , c(h@xmath26 ) = 0.1 , @xmath137 = 18000 k , @xmath138 , and @xmath139 = 0.08 , we generated fluxes to determine the helium abundance when either the underlying absorption is assumed to be known or unknown . at a low density of 10 @xmath37",
    "there was no improvement in the determination of @xmath140 due to a large bias in the monte carlo stemming from the requirement that the density remain positive . at a more characteristic density near 100",
    "@xmath37 the benefit was significant .",
    "the returned value for the helium abundance was y@xmath19 = 0.080997 @xmath4 0.003735 and y@xmath19 = 0.080002 @xmath4 0.002841 for the underlying absorption solved and removed cases respectively .",
    "ultimately , the sensitivity of the determination of the primordial helium abundance demands that analysis be self - consistent and comprehensive ; unfortunately efforts in providing such an analysis yield uncertainties that limit the utility of that determination .",
    "nevertheless , fully understanding the terrain of potential obstacles is necessary to direct further measurement efforts so as to provide a reliable calculation of the primordial helium abundance . apart from improving the spectra , the neutral hydrogen collisional correction for the weaker hydrogen lines can be easily improved from extended principal quantum number collisional strengths .",
    "furthermore the use of a further hydrogen line would benefit the neutral hydrogen fraction and hydrogen absorption since those two parameters are determined exclusively through the three hydrogen lines .",
    "the next balmer line , h@xmath141 ( @xmath213970 ) is blended with ne  iii ( @xmath213967 ) .",
    "the contribution of ne  iii @xmath213967 to the h@xmath141 @xmath213970 could be corrected for by scaling from the stronger ne  iii @xmath21 3868 line , or by observing at sufficiently higher spectral resolution in order to deblend the two lines .",
    "h8 ( @xmath213889 ) , is blended with he  i @xmath213889 , and would not be helpful independent for this type of analysis .",
    "this leaves the relatively very weak h9 ( @xmath213835 ) and h10 ( @xmath213798 ) as the best candidates",
    ". the use of other emission lines which are sensitive to the density may also be useful in reducing the uncertainty due to the degeneracy between density and temperature . however , most candidates with the appropriate electronic structure are not the dominant ionic species in metal - poor h  ii regions ( e.g. , [ s  ii ] , [ o  ii ] ) .",
    "a possible exception is the [ cl  iii ] emission line pair @xmath1425518 , 5538 .    in summary",
    ", it should be emphasized that even though the precision of the primordial helium abundance is not increased , the benefit of the analysis improvements is precisely in demonstrating the full effect of the systematic errors in restricting the abundance determination .",
    "note added : on completion of this paper , we became aware of the newest result of @xcite .",
    "while we find a very similar central value for @xmath143 , we disagree with their conclusion calling for physics beyond the standard model of bbn .",

    "<S> -6 in    umn - th-2838/10 + ftpi - minn-10/07 + january 2010    tests of big bang nucleosynthesis and early universe cosmology require precision measurements for helium abundance determinations . </S>",
    "<S> however , efforts to determine the primordial helium abundance via observations of metal poor h  ii regions have been limited by significant uncertainties ( compared with the value inferred from bbn theory using the cmb determined value of the baryon density ) . </S>",
    "<S> this work builds upon previous work by providing an updated and extended program in evaluating these uncertainties . </S>",
    "<S> procedural consistency is achieved by integrating the hydrogen based reddening correction with the helium based abundance calculation , i.e. , all physical parameters are solved for simultaneously . </S>",
    "<S> we include new atomic data for helium recombination and collisional emission based upon recent work by porter and wavelength dependent corrections to underlying absorption are investigated . </S>",
    "<S> the set of physical parameters has been expanded here to include the effects of neutral hydrogen collisional emission . </S>",
    "<S> it is noted that h@xmath0 and h@xmath1 allow better isolation of the collisional effects from the reddening . </S>",
    "<S> because of a degeneracy between the solutions for density and temperature , the precision of the helium abundance determinations is limited . </S>",
    "<S> also , at lower temperatures ( t @xmath2 13,000 k ) the neutral hydrogen fraction is poorly constrained resulting in a larger uncertainty in the helium abundances . </S>",
    "<S> thus the derived errors on the helium abundances for individual objects are larger than those typical of previous studies . </S>",
    "<S> seven previously analyzed , `` high quality '' h  ii regions are utilized for the primordial helium abundance determination . </S>",
    "<S> the updated emissivities and neutral hydrogen correction generally raise the abundance . from a regression to zero metallicity , we find y@xmath3 as 0.2561 @xmath4 0.0108 , in broad agreement with the wmap result . </S>",
    "<S> tests with synthetic data show a potential for distinct improvement , via removal of underlying absorption , using higher resolution spectra . a small bias in the abundance determination can be reduced significantly and </S>",
    "<S> the calculated helium abundance error can be reduced by @xmath5 25% . </S>"
