    "darwinian evolution on asexual organisms acts by two mechanisms : _ mutations _ , that increase the genetic diversity , and _ selection _ , that fixes and reduces this diversity .",
    "we classify mutations into point ones , corresponding to local displacements on the genotypic space ( defined more accurately in the following ) , and other type of mutations or rearrangements , which imply larger jumps .",
    "mutations are quite rare , so we can safely assume that for each generation at most only one mutation occurs .",
    "from a biological point of view , this discussion applies to unicellular asexual organisms , for which there is no distinction between somatic and germ cells .",
    "moreover , we do not consider the possibility of recombination ( exchange of genetic material ) . for non - recombinant ( asexual ) organisms , the combined effects of reproduction and mutations correspond to a random walk on the genotypic space . even sexual ( recombinant ) populations do transmit asexually some part of their genotype , such as mithocondrial or y - chromosome dna , to which the following analysis applies .",
    "furthermore , we assume a constant environment .    we schematize the effects of selection by the selective reduction of the survival probability .",
    "selection results from several constraints and can affect the frequency of certain genotypes , or even eliminate them from the population .",
    "we classify the components of selection into static and dynamic ones . in the first class we put the constraints that are independent on the population distribution , such as the functionality of a certain protein or the tuning of a metabolic path .",
    "the static part of the selection is equivalent to the concept of `` fitness landscape ''  @xcite .",
    "the dynamic part of the selection originates from to the competition among individuals .",
    "we assume in this schematization that the competition only arises because the population shares some external resource which is evenly distributed , i.e. we disregard the effects of the inter - individual competition  @xcite . in this limit",
    "the effects of competition do not depend on the distribution of genotypes , and simply limit the total size of the population .",
    "the most important effects of the selection can be roughly schematized by assuming that certain genotypes are forbidden , so that they are eliminated from the accessible space .",
    "let us consider for the moment that evolution takes place in a flat fitness landscape . in this frame",
    ", there are no interactions among individuals : the evolution is given by the simple superposition of all possible lineages .",
    "the probability distribution of the population in the genotypic space at a given time can be obtained by summing over all possible individual `` histories '' in a way similar to the path integral formulation of statistical mechanics  @xcite . in this view , the phylogenetic lineage of an individual is given by the path connecting the genotypes of ancestors .",
    "this assumption has to fail somewhere , since otherwise evolution would be equivalent to a diffusion process , without anything favoring the formation of species .",
    "it often assumed that speciation events are rare and occur in a very short time  @xcite , either due to some change in the fitness landscape ( caused by an external catastrophes like the fall of a large meteorite , or by an internal rearrangement induced by coevolution ) or because small isolated populations , escaping from competition , are free to explore their genotypic space ( genetic drift ) and find a path to an higher fitness peak  @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is usually assumed that one can reconstruct the diverging time of two species from their genotypic distance from a single speciation event  @xcite .",
    "it is however known from recent investigations about the small - world phenomenon  @xcite , that diffusion is seriously affected even by a small fraction of long - range jumps  @xcite .",
    "this fact could have dramatic consequences in our understanding of the large - scale evolution mechanism .",
    "if the short - range mutations are dominant , the evolution is equivalent to a diffusion process in the genotypic space . assuming that the fitness landscape is formed by mountains separated by valleys , and that the crests of mountains are almost flat , then the large - scale evolution is dominated by the times needed to cross a valley by chance , while the short - scale is dominated by the neutral exploration of crests  @xcite .",
    "vice versa , if the long - range mutations are important ( eventually amplified by the small - world mechanism ) , the time needed to connect two genotypes does not depend on their distance nor by the shape of the fitness landscape and the fitness maxima are quickly populated .",
    "moreover , in this scenario , the speciation phenomenon should not be ascribed to the `` discovery '' of a preexisting niche , but rather to the formation of that niche in a given ecosystem due to internal interactions ( coevolution ) or external physical changes ( catastrophes ) .",
    "after the formation , the niche is quickly populated because of the long - range mutations . in this framework ,",
    "allopatric speciation  @xcite looses its fundamental importance , and sympatric speciation due to coevolution  @xcite becomes a plausible alternative .    in order to evaluate quantitatively the relevance of these speculations , we introduce an individual - based model of an evolving population .",
    "we assume that the genetic information ( the genotype ) of an individual is represented by a binary string @xmath0 of @xmath1 symbols @xmath2 ( multilocus model with two alleles ) . in this way we are modeling haploid organisms , i.e.   bacteria or viruses or , more appropriately , more archaic , pre - biotic entities .",
    "the choice of a binary code is not fundamental but certainly makes things easier .",
    "it can be justified by thinking at a purine - pyrimidine coding , or to `` good '' and `` bad '' alleles for genes ( units of genetic information ) . in this second version",
    ", @xmath3 represents a good gene and @xmath4 a bad one .",
    "this is a sort of `` minimal model '' which is often used to model the evolution of genetic populations  @xcite . for bacteria",
    ", one can give indications that major and minor codons work in such a way  @xcite .",
    "the genotypic space is thus a boolean hypercube of @xmath1 dimensions , and each individuals sits on a corner of this cube , according to its genotype .",
    "the @xmath5 corners of this hypercube represent all possible genotypes , which are at a maximum distance equal to @xmath1 .    in the next section ,",
    "we formalize the model and introduce the mathematical representation of mutation mechanisms .",
    "then , in section  [ sec : flat ] , we consider the consequences of short and long - range mutations for a flat fitness landscape . in the long - range case",
    "all genotypes are connected , regardless of their mutual distance : this case can be considered the equivalent of a mean - field approximation .",
    "we derive analytically the rate of spreading @xmath6 and the characteristic spreading time @xmath7 of a genetically homogeneous inoculum in the short - range ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 ) and long - range ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) cases . in the first case",
    ", @xmath8 is independent of the genotype length @xmath1 , and @xmath9 grows linearly with @xmath1 ; the opposite happens in the long - range case . clearly , this different behavior has dramatic evolutionary consequences as @xmath1 becomes large .    in general ,",
    "however , only a small set of all possible long - range mutations is observed in real organisms .",
    "we thus compute numerically the rate of spreading @xmath6 in a mixed short - range and sparse long - range case .",
    "a small - world effect can be observed : in the limit of large genotype lengths , a vanishing fraction of long - range mutations cooperates with the short - range ones to give essentially the mean - field results .    in section  [ sec : path ]",
    ", we show that the effects of mutations and selection can be separated in the limit of a very smooth fitness landscape and mean - field long - range mutations . in this approximation",
    "we obtain analytically that the asymptotic probability distribution is a boltzmann equilibrium one , in which the fitness plays the role of of an energy and mutations correspond to temperature .",
    "we compute numerically the asymptotic probability distribution for several fitness landscapes , finding that the equilibrium hypothesis is verified . as a nontrivial example of small - world effects in evolution",
    ", we checked numerically that this scenario still holds for a sparse long - range mutation matrix .",
    "conclusions and perspectives are drawn in the last section .",
    "in order to be specific , let us assume that the genotype of an individual is represented by a boolean string of length @xmath1 .",
    "in this way , the genotypic space is a boolean hypercube with @xmath5 nodes .",
    "the genotype of an individual is represented by a string @xmath12 of @xmath1 boolean symbols @xmath2 .",
    "each position corresponds to a locus whose gene has two allelic forms . in this way we are modeling haploid ( only one copy of each gene ) organisms , i.e.   bacteria or viruses or , more appropriately , more archaic , pre - biotic entities .",
    "the genotype can be also viewed as a spin configuration . in this case",
    "we use the symbol @xmath13 .",
    "we consider two kinds of mutations : point mutations , that interchange a @xmath3 with a @xmath4 , and all other mutations that do not alter the length of the genotype ( transposition and inversions ) .",
    "we define the distance @xmath14 between two genotypes @xmath15 and @xmath16 as the minimal number of point mutations needed to pass from @xmath15 to @xmath16 ( hamming distance ) @xmath17 all possible genotypes of length @xmath1 are distributed on the @xmath5 vertices of an hypercube .",
    "a point mutation corresponds to a unit displacement on that hypercube ( short - range jump ) .",
    "the occurrence of point mutations in real organisms depends on the identity of the symbol and on its position on the genotype ; in the present approximation , however , we assume that all point mutations are equally likely . moreover , since the probability of observing a mutation is quite small , we impose that at most one mutation is possible in one generation .",
    "the probability to observe a point mutation from genotype @xmath16 to genotype @xmath15 is given by the short - range mutation matrix @xmath18 . by denoting with @xmath19 the probability of a point mutation per generation",
    ", we have @xmath20    other types of mutations correspond to long - range jumps in the genotypic space .",
    "the simplest approximation consists in assuming all mutations equiprobable .",
    "let us denote with @xmath21 the probability per generation of this kind of mutations .",
    "the long - range mutation matrix , @xmath22 , is defined as @xmath23 in the real world , only some kinds of mutations are actually observed .",
    "we model this fact by replacing @xmath24 with a sparse matrix @xmath25 .",
    "we introduce the sparseness index @xmath26 , which is the average number of nonzero off - diagonal elements of @xmath25 .",
    "the sum of these off - diagonal elements still gives @xmath21 . in this case",
    "@xmath25 is a quenched sparse matrix , and @xmath24 can be considered the average of the annealed version .",
    "after considering both types of mutations , the overall mutation matrix is @xmath27 or @xmath28 for the quenched version .",
    "we model our population at the level of the probability distribution of genotypes @xmath29 , thus disregarding spatial effects .",
    "the evolution equation for @xmath30 is @xmath31 where the selection function @xmath32 corresponds to the average reproduction rate of individuals with genotype @xmath15 , and @xmath33 is the average reproduction rate of the population  @xcite .",
    "we write @xmath32 in an exponential form @xmath34 , and we denote @xmath35 with the term _ fitness landscape_.    the selection does not act directly on the genotype , but rather on the _ phenotype _ ( how an individual appears to others ) .",
    "the phenotype of a given genotype can be interpreted as an array of morphological characteristics .",
    "we consider the simplest case , in which the phenotype if univocally determined by the genotype @xmath15 , which is not the general case , since polymorphism or age dependence are usually present .",
    "the general mapping between genotype and phenotype is largely unknown and is expected to be quite complex .",
    "the effects of some genes are additive ( non - epistatic ) , while others can interact in a simple ( control genes ) or complex ( morphologic genes ) way .",
    "a possible way of approximating these effects is to use the following form for the fitness @xmath35 : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is a random function of @xmath15 , uniformly distributed between @xmath38 and @xmath4 ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "the `` field '' term @xmath40 represents a non - epistatic contribution to the fitness , in which all genes have equal weight .",
    "the `` ferromagnetic '' term @xmath41 represents simple interactions between pairs of genes ( even though in general those are not symmetric ) and corresponds to a weakly rough landscape .",
    "finally , @xmath42 modulates a widely rough landscape and can be thought as an approximation of the effects of complex ( spin - glass like ) interactions among genes .",
    "in this section we study the case of a flat fitness landscape ( no selection ) , i.e.  @xmath43 . in this way we are modeling the evolution on the crest of a mountain , assuming that all deleterious mutations are immediately lethal ( the part of genotype that can originate this kind of mutations is not considered ) , and that we can neglect the small variation of fitness along the crest .",
    "this landscape is the one usually considered in the theory of neutral evolution  @xcite .",
    "let us assume that this crest is colonized by a founder deme genotypically homogeneous ( a delta peak in the genotypic distribution ) .",
    "we want to obtain the average time needed to populate the crest according with the different mutation schemes .",
    "since the fitness landscape is flat , @xmath44 is a constant .",
    "we are interested in the behavior of @xmath45 , which is the average distance of the population from a given starting genotype @xmath46 , i.e. @xmath47 we introduce the spreading velocity @xmath6 as @xmath48    in appendix a we obtain the spectral properties of the mutational matrices @xmath49 and @xmath24 . the corresponding spreading velocities in the limit of small time interval @xmath50 compared to the characteristic",
    "spreading time @xmath51 ( short - range ) and @xmath52 ( long - range ) are @xmath53 , eq .  ( [ vs ] ) , and @xmath54 , eq .",
    "( [ vl ] ) .",
    "if short and long - range mutations coexists , one has @xmath55 , eq .",
    "( [ v ] ) .",
    "one can approximate the behavior of real biological systems by considering a mixture of short - range mutations , which occur with a relatively high frequency , and sparse long - range mutations , with sparseness index @xmath26 .",
    "we investigated the sparse case by numerical simulations , for some genotype lengths @xmath1 .",
    "as shown in figure  [ figure : spreading ] , as soon as the sparseness index @xmath56 , the numerical value of @xmath6 becomes very close to the mean - field one , eq .  .",
    "notice that the average distance from inoculum , @xmath45 , is rather insensitive to the distribution of @xmath30 .",
    "the actual distribution can be quite different from the one obtained with the mean - field matrix @xmath24 .",
    "this transition may be interpreted as an indication of a small - world effect , and that there exists a first - order transition at @xmath57  @xcite",
    ". however , the fluctuations of the velocity , @xmath58 , appears to diverge at @xmath57 with an exponent @xmath4 , as shown in figure  [ figure : fluctuations ] .",
    "these results suggest the presence of a small - world phenomenon in evolution : the rare and sparse long - range mutations cooperate synergetically with the short - range ones to give essentially a mean - field effect .",
    "we checked that the previous results hold also for a non - flat ( but smooth ) fitness landscape ( @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 ) .",
    "again , as soon as @xmath56 , the spreading velocity increases from the short - range values to the mean - field ones .",
    "in the following we shall study the effects of the cooperation between short - range and sparse long - range mutations on the equilibrium properties of the model .",
    "let us study the model in the presence of a smooth static fitness landscape . in this case the fitness @xmath64 does not depend explicitly on the distribution @xmath65 , and eq .",
    "( [ mutsel ] ) can be linearized by using unnormalized variables @xmath66 satisfying @xmath67 with the correspondence @xmath68 in vectorial terms , eq .",
    "( [ z ] ) can be written as @xmath69 where @xmath70 and @xmath71 .    when one takes into consideration only point mutations ( @xmath72 ) , eq .",
    "( [ z ] ) can be read as the transfer matrix of a two - dimensional ising model  @xcite , for which the genotypic element @xmath73 corresponds to the spin in row @xmath50 and column @xmath74 , and @xmath75 is the restricted partition function of row @xmath50 . the effective hamiltonian @xmath76 ( up to constant terms ) of a possible genealogical history @xmath77 or @xmath78 from time",
    "@xmath79 is @xmath80 where @xmath81 .",
    "this peculiar two - dimensional ising model has a long - range coupling along the row ( depending on the choice of the fitness function ) and a ferromagnetic coupling along the time direction ( for small short range mutation probability ) . in order to obtain the statistical properties of the system one has to sum over all possible configurations ( stories ) , eventually selecting the right boundary conditions at time @xmath82 .",
    "the bulk properties of eq .",
    "( [ ising ] ) can not be reduced in general to the equilibrium distribution of a one dimensional system , since the transition probabilities among rows do not obey detailed balance .",
    "moreover , the temperature - dependent hamiltonian ( [ ising ] ) does not allow an easy identification between energy and selection , and temperature and mutation , what is naively expected by the biological analogy with an adaptive walk .",
    "let us first consider the long - range mutation case .",
    "( [ z ] ) , reformulated according to eq .",
    "( [ mutsel ] ) , corresponds to @xmath83 since it is easier to consider the effects of @xmath84 and @xmath24 separately , let us study in which limit they commute .",
    "the norm of the commutator on the asymptotic probability distribution @xmath30 is @xmath85||=\\sum_{{\\boldsymbol{xy } } }    and it is bounded by @xmath86 , where @xmath87 ( i.e.  a very smooth landscape ) , to first order in @xmath88 we have @xmath89 which is the analogous of the trotter product formula .",
    "when @xmath7 is order @xmath90 , @xmath91 is a constant matrix with elements equal to @xmath92 , and thus @xmath93 is a constant probability distribution . if @xmath21 is large enough , @xmath94 .",
    "the asymptotic probability distribution @xmath95 is thus proportional to the diagonal of @xmath96 : @xmath97 i.e.  a boltzmann distribution with hamiltonian @xmath35 and temperature @xmath21 .",
    "this corresponds to the naive analogy between evolution and equilibrium statistical mechanics . in other words ,",
    "the genotypic distribution is equally populated if the phenotype is the same , regardless of the genotypic distance since we used long - range mutations .",
    "we have checked numerically this hypothesis , by iterating eq .",
    "( [ mutsel ] ) for a time @xmath98 large enough to be sure of having reached the asymptotic state .",
    "we plotted the logarithm of the probability distribution @xmath99 versus the value of the hamiltonian @xmath35 .",
    "we computed the slope @xmath100 of the linear regression .",
    "the quantity @xmath101 is the effective `` temperature '' of the probability distribution according to the equilibrium hypothesis .",
    "the results for the mean - field mutation matrix @xmath24 are shown in figure  [ figure : ml ] .",
    "we see that the equilibrium hypothesis is well verified in the limit @xmath102 ; and that convergence is faster for a rough landscape . in all cases",
    "the effective temperature @xmath101 is close to the expected value , i.e.  to the mutation rate @xmath21 .",
    "the above results only hold qualitatively for pure short - range mutations as shown in figure  [ figure : ms ] .",
    "a small dispersion of points in figure implies that the genotypes can be divided into evenly - populated groups sharing approximately the same fitness .",
    "this is always the case for the additive fitness landscape ( @xmath40 contribution ) , since in this case the position of symbols in the genotype is ininfluent , and the short - range mutations are able to homogenize the distribution inside a group .",
    "this is only approximately valid for the @xmath41 contributions , since in this case the fitness depends on pairs of symbols , while mutations only act on single symbols .",
    "however , as shown in figure  [ figure : ms]-d , the homogeneous state is reached for a sufficiently high mutation probability .",
    "finally , the homogeneous state is never reached for the very rough landscape case ( @xmath40 contribution ) , even though the linear relation is satisfied in average .    in order to obtain a quantitatively correct prediction",
    ", one has to consider that the resulting slope @xmath103 is related to the second largest eigenvalue @xmath104 of the mutation matrix by @xmath105 .",
    "when the fitness only depends on the `` external field '' term @xmath40 , in the asymptotic state the short - range mutations connects group of equal fitness .",
    "this fact is reflected by the vanishing dispersion of points in figure  [ figure : ms]-a and [ figure : ms]-b .    in all cases",
    ", we expect that in the limit of a very smooth landscape , @xmath103 tends towards the limiting value @xmath106 of eq .",
    "( [ msspectrum ] ) .",
    "this limit is reached faster when only the @xmath40 term is present .",
    "this implies that for large genotype , the effective temperature due to short - range mutations is vanishing .    in the opposite case ,",
    "when the selection is strong , the application of the matrix @xmath107 `` rotates '' the distribution @xmath65 in a way which is practically random with respect to the fourier eigenvectors of @xmath108 .",
    "thus , the effective second eigenvalue of the mutation matrix is given by @xmath109 , obtained averaging over all the eigenvalues of eq  ( [ msspectrum ] ) .",
    "consequently , we obtain @xmath110 .",
    "this limit is reached faster in the case of a strongly disordered fitness landscape , i.e.  in the limit of large @xmath42 .",
    "when only the @xmath41 term is present , one observes an intermediate case .",
    "let us now consider the case of a sparse long - range mutation matrix , coupled to a stronger short - range matrix , i.e.  @xmath111 .",
    "we performed simulations with @xmath112 and @xmath113 , @xmath114 , 8 and 10 and varying @xmath26 .",
    "the results are summarized in table  [ table : s ] .",
    "the effects of the two kinds of mutations is additive , implying that , for small @xmath21 , the distributions are visually similar to the short - range case , figure  [ figure : ms ] .",
    "however , as soon as @xmath26 is greater than a threshold @xmath115 , the effective temperature @xmath101 increases by the expected long - range contribution , @xmath21 .",
    "this increment is very relevant when the effect of short - range mutations are vanishing , i.e.  for smooth landscapes ( @xmath40 and @xmath41 contributions ) and large genotypes .",
    "the effect is less relevant in the disordered case , ( @xmath42 contributions ) , since in this case the contribution to the effective temperature by the small - range mutations do not decrease with @xmath1 .    by increasing the weigth of the sparse long - range mutations , also the probability distribution becomes similar to the long - range case , figure  [ figure : ml ] .",
    "we performed simulations with @xmath112 and @xmath116 , @xmath117 varying @xmath26 .",
    "the results are shown in table  [ table : s ] .",

    "( [ boltzmann ] ) through the computation of the average square difference from linear regression , @xmath118 . in figure",
    "[ figure : sparsechi ] we show that @xmath118 becomes very small as soon as @xmath119 , which seems to vanish with @xmath120 .",
    "this implies that , for large genotypes , a vanishing fraction of long - range mutations , coupled to small - range ones , are sufficient to establish the statistical mechanics analogy of selection and mutations .",
    "we studied some simple models of asexual populations evolving on a smooth fitness landscape , in the presence of point mutations ( small - range jumps in genotypic space ) and other genetic rearrangements ( long - range jumps ) .",
    "we have computed analitically the spreading velocity of an initially homogeneous inoculum on a flat fitness landscape , for the short - range and the long - range mean - field ( all mutations equiprobable ) cases . since in the real situation",
    "only a small set of the all possible mutations can occur , we have also considered the quenched version of the long - range mutation matrix . in this case we have shown that a small - world effect is present , since even a small fraction of quenched long - range jumps makes the results indistinguishable from those obtained by assuming all mutations equiprobable .",
    "these results still hold for a smooth fitness landscape .",
    "we have investigated this issue further , studying the equilibrium properties of the system in the presence of a smooth fitness landscape . in this framework , it has been possibile to show that the equilibrium distribution is a boltzmann one , in which the fitness plays the role of an energy , and mutations that of a temperature . we have checked numerically this result for different fitness landscapes , and a mean - field long - range mutation mechanism . as in the previous case , a small - world phenomenon appears , since similar results can be obtained using a combination of sparse long - range and short - range mutations .",
