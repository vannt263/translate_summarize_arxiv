    "although both the chu models with and without strong magnetic field exhibit a narrow depression,@xcite with @xmath222 going to zero at the critical point , the disorder dependence is quite different . with increasing random - magnetic - flux disorder strength , the energy range of the depression gets narrower in the absence of a constant @xmath218 while it increases when a strong perpendicular magnetic field is present .",
    "the appearance of such ` microgaps ' has been attributed to the non - perturbative ergodic regime@xcite of the chiral model , i.e. , the localization length greatly exceeds the sample size so that for time scales large compared to the diffusion time the particle extends over the whole sample . a similar behavior was observed also for the chs model.@xcite we note , however , that dos depressions ( ` microgaps ' ) are absent in our numerical calculations performed for the cho case . for strong disorder , a narrow peak appears instead at @xmath0,@xcite presumably originating from the different type of disorder ( real random hopping ) that in contrast to the complex random phases in the rmf models can lead to isolated sites having eigenenergies around @xmath0 .",
    "this extra peak is observed for both the bricklayer and the square lattice systems .",
    "nevertheless , it is unclear whether the different disorder dependence of the dos around the critical point can account for the observed difference in the critical exponents .",
    "finally , we would like to remind the reader that the presence of a strong magnetic field causes a special topological term in the appropriate field theories.@xcite this extra term is responsible for the occurrence of current carrying states that are essential for the explanation of the integer quantum hall effect , and so it accounts for the difference between the ordinary gaussian unitary ensemble and the quantum hall situation , i.e. , the appearance of critical electronic states in the latter case .",
    "furthermore , the strong magnetic field may effectively restore the particle - hole symmetry that is usually lacking when time - reversal symmetry is broken .",
    "the recovery of the particle - hole symmetry can take place when the scattering between electronic states belonging to different disorder broadened landau bands is suppressed by a large energy separation .",
    "thus , a single landau band model containing a chiral quantum critical point at @xmath0 is effectively created in the chiral unitary case with an additional very strong , spatially constant , perpendicular magnetic field .",
    "we therefore suggest that the presence or absence of particle - hole symmetry is responsible for the different critical exponents found in our numerical calculations of various chiral unitary models .",
    "to check this view , we investigated also chiral unitary models with weaker constant magnetic fields @xmath223 and @xmath224 ( see chu[1/10k , 0.5 ] and chu[1/1k , 0.5 ] in table  [ tabulka2 ] ) and found critical exponents @xmath225 as in the magnetic field free case .    in conclusion , we calculated the two smallest lyapunov exponents of lattice models belonging to the chiral orthogonal , chiral symplectic , and to the chiral unitary class in the presence of a strong spatially constant magnetic field .",
    "we found in all cases a critical exponent @xmath226 that governs the divergence of the localization length at the band center @xmath0 .",
    "this result is in agreement with previous calculations for the diverging energy dependence of the density of states.@xcite it is , however , at variance with the earlier analytically obtained results.@xcite while reasons for this difference were suggested in refs .",
    "( ) , the origin of the numerically@xcite obtained value @xmath227 for chiral unitary lattice models in the absence of a strong perpendicular magnetic field is still an open question .",
    "the latter result was again corroborated in the present study and suggested to be due to the absence of particle - hole symmetry in the rmf - model without a strong spatially constant magnetic field .",
    "however , due to the limited achievable system size in the numerical calculations , a magnetic field induced transition from the ballistic to the diffusive regime as discussed above , can not be completely excluded .",
