    "our own galaxy ( the milky way ) has always represented a challenge for galaxy formation theories .",
    "being the only system for which we can access full phase - space information for a significant number of individual stars , the milky way represents an important benchmark for theoretical models",
    "( perryman et al . 2001 ; beers et al . 2004 ; everdasson et al . 1993 ; steinmetz et al . 2006 ; ivezi et al . 2008 ) . however , it is only one galaxy among many , and may not be representative of ` typical ' spiral galaxies in the same mass range ( hammer et al .",
    "2007 ) . hence",
    ", a statistical analysis of mw type galaxies could help us to understand to which extent we can rely on the milky way to set constrains for galaxy formation models .",
    "the first model for the formation of our galaxy was proposed by eggen , lynden - bell & sandage ( 1962 ) , who argued that the observed relation between the metallicity and the orbital eccentricity of a sample of about 200 stars could be interpreted as a signature of a rapid radial collapse which led to the formation of the stellar halo .",
    "searle & zinn ( 1978 ) later proved this scenario to be inconsistent with the observation of a negligible metallicity gradient for the globular cluster population at large galactocentric distances .",
    "these authors proposed an alternative scenario in which the stellar halo of the galaxy formed through accretion of smaller galactic systems .",
    "this picture is in qualitative agreement with expectations from the cold dark matter ( cdm ) model and with the observed signatures of substructure in the stellar halo of the milky way , which appears to be a complex dynamical system still being shaped by merging of smaller neighbouring galaxies ( e.g. vivas & zinn 2006 ) .",
    "numerical simulations of structure formation in a cdm universe indicate the important role of the merging histories of dark matter haloes in determining the structure and motions of stars within galaxies .",
    "these simulations imply that the last major merger event in our galaxy should have occurred at @xmath2 , otherwise the very thin cold disc observed in the galaxy would have been destroyed ( navarro et al .",
    "2004 ; kazantzidis et al .",
    "bekki & chiba ( 2001 ) have also shown that dissipative mergers with gas rich systems could have generated halo stars before the formation of the galactic disk .",
    "more recent studies using an hybrid approach that combines @xmath3-body simulations and semi - analytic techniques ( font et al . 2006",
    "; de lucia & helmi 2008 ) have suggested that the stellar halo of the galaxy formed from the accretion of a few relatively massive satellites ( @xmath4 ) at early times ( @xmath5 9 gyr ) .",
    "although the basic cosmological paradigm appears to be well established , and supported by a large number of observational results , our understanding of the physics of galaxy formation is still far from complete . within the currently accepted paradigm , galaxies form when gas condenses at the centre of dark matter haloes , which assemble in a ` bottom - up ' fashion with smaller systems forming first and merging later into larger structures .",
    "the evolution of the baryonic components is dominated by complex physical processes ( e.g. star formation , supernovae and agn feedback , chemical enrichment , etc . ) which are poorly understood from both the observational and the theoretical viewpoint .",
    "the morphology , dynamics and chemistry of a galaxy is the result of many intertwined processes . in this complex framework ,",
    "a number of questions still remain to be answered : how did the galaxy assemble ?",
    "how ` typical ' is the galaxy in the local universe ? which physical processes play a role in determining its physical and chemical properties ?",
    "which kind of merging histories lead to the formation of galactic systems similar to our galaxy ?    in this work we will address some of these questions by taking advantage of one of the largest cosmological simulations of structure formation carried out so far , the millennium simulation , which is combined with a semi - analytic model of galaxy formation ( for a recent review on these techniques , see baugh 2006 ) .",
    "the aim of this paper is to explore the formation histories of milky way - type galaxies and to analyse the origin of the dispersion in their physical properties . in order to achieve this goal",
    "we study simultaneously the assembly and chemical evolution of model galaxies , and their location on the well - known correlation between stellar mass and metallicity ( e.g. lequeux et al .",
    "1979 ; tremonti et al .",
    "2004 ; lee et al .",
    "this strong correlation has been proved to evolve with redshift in such a way that , at a given stellar mass , the gas - phase metallicities of galaxies were lower in the past ( e.g. savaglio et al .",
    "2005 ; erb et al .",
    "studying the evolution of the mass - metallicity relation as a function of cosmic time can provide important information on the physical processes responsible for the joint evolution of the chemical and dynamical properties of galaxies , e.g supernovae and agn feedback , star formation and mergers ( e.g. tissera et al .",

    "finlator et al . 2008 ) .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in section 2",
    "we give a brief description of the simulation and of the semi - analytic model used in our study . in section 3",
    "we study the main physical properties of model milky - way type galaxies at @xmath6 , while in section 4 we study their assembly and formation histories . in section 5",
    "we analyse the influence of different assembly histories on the chemical properties of model galaxies , as a function of redshift .",
    "finally , we summarise our findings in section 6 .",
    "this work takes advantage of the millennium simulation database . the millennium simulation ( springel et al .",
    "2005 ) follows @xmath7 particles of mass @xmath8 in a comoving periodic box of 500 mpc @xmath9 on a side , and with a spatial resolution of 5 kpc @xmath9 in the whole box .",
    "the cosmological model is consistent with the first - year data from the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( spergel et al .",
    "2003 ) : @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 . here ,",
    "@xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 denote the total matter density , the density of baryons , and dark energy density at @xmath6 , in units of the critical density for closure ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "@xmath20 is the rms linear mass fluctuation within a sphere of radius 8 mpc @xmath9 extrapolated to the present epoch .",
    "the simulation data were stored in 64 snapshots from @xmath21 to the present day . for each snapshot , dark matter haloes were identified using a standard friends - of - friends ( fof ) algorithm with a linking length of 0.2 in units of the mean inter - particle separation .",
    "the algorithm subfind ( springel et al . 2001 ) was used to decompose each fof group into a set of disjoint substructures .",
    "only substructures retaining at least 20 bound particles ( i.e. corresponding to a mass larger than @xmath22 ) were considered genuine and used to construct merger history trees as described in springel et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and de lucia & blaizot ( 2007 - hereafter dlb07 ) .",
    "these merger trees represent the basic input to the semi - analytic model that is used to generate the publicly available galaxy catalogues .",
    "this methodology was originally introduced by springel et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and de lucia , kauffmann & white ( 2004 ) , and it has been recently updated to include a model for the suppression of cooling flows by ` radio - mode ' agn feedback ( croton et al .",
    "2006 ) . a more detailed description of the physical modelling can be found in croton et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and in dlb07 .    as illustrated in fig .  1 in de lucia et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , each model galaxy is assumed to be made up of four different baryonic components : ( i ) _ stars _ ; ( ii ) _ cold gas _ , which is available for star formation ; ( iii ) _ hot gas _ , which is available for cooling and only associated to galaxies sitting at the centre of fof haloes ; and ( iv ) _ ejected gas _ , which is made up of material that is temporarily ejected outside the galaxy s halo by supernovae winds . for the interpretation of the results presented below ,",
    "it is worth noting that the model adopts an instantaneous recycling approximation ( i.e. it neglects the delay between star formation and the recycling of gas and metals from stellar winds and supernovae ) , and that metals are exchanged between the different components in proportion to the exchanged mass ( for details , see de lucia et al .",
    "in addition , the model assumes that all metals produced by new stars are instantaneously mixed with the available cold gas ( i.e. the model assumes a 100 per cent mixing efficiency ) .    finally , we remind the reader that the model used in this study follows dark matter substructures explicitly , i.e the haloes within which galaxies form are still followed after they are accreted onto larger systems .",
    "this scheme leads to three different types of galaxies : central galaxies of fof groups are referred to as ` type 0 ' , and are the only galaxies fed by gas that is cooling radiatively from the surrounding halo .",
    "galaxies attached to distinct dark matter substructures are called ` type 1 ' , and their orbits are followed by tracking the parent dark matter substructure until tidal stripping reduces its mass below the resolution of the simulation ( de lucia et al .",
    "2004 ; gao et al .",
    "2004 ) . the galaxy at the centre of the dissolving substructure is not affected by tidal stripping , and is assigned a merging time using the classical dynamical friction formula .",
    "these galaxies are referred to as ` type 2 ' .",
    "in this work , we defined as milky way ( mw ) type galaxies those type 0 systems which inhabit haloes with @xmath23 ( li & white 2008 ) , where @xmath24 is the maximum circular velocity , which is estimated directly from the simulation .",
    "this selection provides a total of 130311 systems , which is consistent with the number of @xmath25 galaxies estimated from the observed local luminosity function .",
    "we also restricted the sample to galaxies with @xmath26 with @xmath27 ( @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the bulge and total magnitude in the b - band ) , so as to select galaxies with an sb@xmath30sc morphology ( simien & de vaucouleurs 1986 ) .",
    "the final sample used in this study is made up of 52149 systems that we called mw type galaxies .",
    "we choose the maximum circular velocity and the morphological type to select mw haloes because these two physical properties are observationally better determined than the total stellar mass and cold gas fraction , for example .",
    "we also extend the analysis including observational estimates on these two parameters and refer to this sample as a restricted mw sample ( rmws ) . adopting @xmath31 and @xmath32 ( guesten & mezger 1982 ; kulkarni & heiles 1987 ; boissier & prantzos 1999 ; lineweaver 1999 ; de lucia & helmi 2008 ) , we find that 10.7% of the total model mw type galaxies would constitute a closer representation of our own galaxy .    in fig .",

    "the distributions shown in fig .",
    "[ histodw ] peak close to these observational estimates , but also exhibit a large dispersion .",
    "this shows that , although galaxies have been selected to have a narrow range of circular velocities ( i.e. total mass ) , they had significantly different evolutionary histories , which produced the relatively large scatter in stellar mass and gas content visible in fig .",

    "[ mzr_gral ] shows that there is a well defined correlation between the gas - phase metallicity and the stellar mass .",
    "the gas - phase metallicity increases approximately linearly for stellar masses below @xmath37 , and flattens for more massive galaxies , remaining constant about the solar value .",
    "model mw type galaxies are located around the turnover of the millennium mzr .",
    "their mean metallicity grows with stellar mass with a slightly steeper slope compared to the general trend of the millennium mzr , but with similar slope to that reported by tremonti et al .",

    "the mzr reflects the balance between star formation activity and other physical processes such as supernovae and agn feedbacks , environmental effects , etc .",
    "studying the origin of this relation and of its dispersion can therefore provide important information of the sequence of events which led to the formation of galaxies similar to our own milky way .",
    "in the following , we will analyse the origin of the mzr of model mw type galaxies by studying their assembly and chemical enrichment histories simultaneously .",
    "we constructed the full galaxy merger trees for all our model mw type galaxies and analysed them as in dlb07 .",
    "we remind the reader that , among the different ` branches ' of a galaxy merger tree , the ` main branch ' is special , because it connects a galaxy to its most massive progenitor ( the ` main progenitor ' ) at each node of the tree . in the following , we will refer to all mergers onto the main branch as ` accretion events ' .",
    "major mergers correspond to accretion events in which the stellar mass of the accreted galaxy is at least one third of the stellar mass in the main progenitor at the time of accretion .    for the millennium simulation , springel et al .",
    "( 2005 ) found that the halo mass function can be reliably estimated down to 20 particles .",

    "these authors built up galaxy merger trees and studied the physical properties of the structure along them , in four realization of the same initial condition but with increasing numerical resolution .",
    "their results indicate a very good level of convergence for the range of particle mass of few @xmath39 to @xmath40 .",
    "these previous studies provide evidences that for the mass range studied in this work , merger trees and the properties of galaxies along them are reliably estimated .    for our mw type sample ,",

    "the bottom right panel of fig .",
    "[ mwmp_evol ] shows the mean evolution of the specific star formation rate .",
    "this exhibits a large spread , particularly at low redshifts , indicating that a significant fraction of our mw galaxies have decreased their star formation activity during the last @xmath46  gyrs .",
    "these effects are slightly stronger for galaxies in the rmws ( inset plot ) , which end having star formation rates around @xmath62 , which are now a bit lower than the observational estimations for our galaxy .",
    "this is ( at least in part ) due to the strong agn feedback adopted in the model in order to suppress cooling flows in relatively massive haloes .",
    "this strong agn feedback , combined with a relatively strong supernovae feedback in this particular mass range , seems to exhaust the gas available for star formation on relatively short time scales ( see also discussion in sec",
    ". 6.1 of dlb07 for the brightest cluster galaxies ) .",
    "a possible solution to this issue might be the implementation in the model of a new mechanism capable of re - activating cooling flows at later times but this analysis is out of the scope of this work .    only a small fraction ( about 12 per cent ) of galaxies in our mw type sample suffered at least one major merger event during its life , i.e. all objects accreted onto the main branch have mass smaller than a third the mass of the main progenitor at the time of the merger event .",
    "a more detailed investigation showed that most of the major mergers occurred at @xmath63 , and that only @xmath64 per cent of mw type galaxies had a major merger as their last accretion event .",
    "these results do not change significantly for galaxies in rmws .",
    "therefore , our mw galaxies have a relatively quiet life with no important mergers and a number of minor accretion events that only add a relatively small fraction of the total final mass .    in fig .",

    "in particular , the median cold gas mass at @xmath6 for the rmws is approximately @xmath67 , in good agreement with observations ( blitz 1997 and references therein ) . at @xmath68",
    "we estimate quite large hot gas masses .",
    "this in part due to the cooling flow suppression by agn feedback used to built up the galaxy catalogue .",

    "( 2006 ) tuned the model to reproduce the local relation between the mass of the bulge and the mass of the black hole and it is known that the mw black hole is offset from this relation . then , as expected , for our mw type galaxies we obtained a mean central black hole mass of @xmath69 , which is one order of magnitude above the observational estimations for the milky way galaxy ( schdel et al .",
    "also supernova feedback contributes to build up the hot phase .",
    "although at lower redshifts supernovae are not the main source of heating , the excess of hot gas might suggest that the combination of both type of feedbacks and their relative importance need to be revised .",

    "taking advantage of the publicly available database of merger trees , we studied the assembly and chemical enrichment histories of our model mw type galaxies .",
    "our main results can be summarised as follows :    \\1 .",
    "most of the final stellar mass of model mw type galaxies is formed _ in situ _ from gas infalling from the surrounding halo .",
    "a small fraction of the final stellar mass ( about 15 per cent ) is formed in smaller galaxies that are accreted over the lifetime of the milky way .",
    "only 12 per cent of our model mw type galaxies experienced a major merger during their lifetime , and for only 3.23 per cent of our sample was this major merger the last accretion event .",
    "the distribution of baryons in different components is regulated by feedback processes . at @xmath79 ,",
    "supernovae feedback is effective in ejecting large fractions of the gas outside the haloes ( due to the shallower potential wells ) .",
    "by @xmath45 , a large part of this gas has been re - incorporated and the suppression of cooling flows by agn feedback starts playing a more important role , keeping an important fraction of the baryons in the hot phase .",
    "the mzr of model mw type galaxies has a dispersion of @xmath51 dex , in agreement with the observed results by tremonti et al .",
    "we found that , at a given stellar mass , the main parameter determining this dispersion is the gas richness of the systems .",
    "gas - rich systems tend to be more metal - poor , while gas - poor galaxies have converted most of their cold gas component into stars in the past and , therefore have reached a higher level of chemical enrichment .",
    "the accretion histories of the haloes hosting our mw type galaxies exhibit a large dispersion .",
    "haloes hosting gas - rich mw progenitors at high redshifts tend to experience a higher accretion rate at later times .",
    "these differences in the accretion histories of the parent haloes introduce differences in the star formation rates of the progenitors which , on their turn , modulate the impact of supernovae and agn feedbacks .",
    "this leads to an important dispersion in the stellar masses and metallicities of the z=0 milky way systems .",
    "if we restrict the model mw galaxies to satisfy also observational constrains on stellar mass and gas fractions , we get a smaller sample with similar trends to those of the complete mw type sample reflecting the fact that the dark matter halo is the dominant factor determining the history of assembly of galaxies .",
    "however , the dispersion in the metallicity and gas fraction at a given mass is produced by slightly differences in the accretion rates of substructures which regulate the star formation activity .",
    "our findings suggest that part of the dispersion observed in the mzr could be revealing differences in the histories of formation . also , our results suggest that the galaxy may be consider a typical sb / sc galaxy in the same mass range , providing a suitable benchmark for numerical models of galaxy formation .",

    "<S> we analyse a sample of 52,000 milky way ( mw ) type galaxies drawn from the publicly available galaxy catalogue of the millennium simulation with the aim of studying statistically the differences and similarities of their properties in comparison to our galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> model galaxies are chosen to lie in haloes with maximum circular velocities in the range 200 - 250 km s@xmath0 and to have bulge - to - disk ratios similar to that of the milky way . </S>",
    "<S> we find that model mw galaxies formed ` quietly ' through the accretion of cold gas and small satellite systems . </S>",
    "<S> only @xmath1 per cent of our model galaxies experienced a major merger during their lifetime . </S>",
    "<S> most of the stars formed ` in situ ' , with only about 15 per cent of the final mass gathered through accretion . </S>",
    "<S> supernovae and agn feedback play an important role in the evolution of these systems . at high redshifts , </S>",
    "<S> when the potential wells of the mw progenitors are shallower , winds driven by supernovae explosions blow out a large fraction of the gas and metals . as the systems grow in mass , sn feedback effects decrease and agn feedback takes over , playing a more important role in the regulation of the star formation activity at lower redshifts . </S>",
    "<S> although model milky way galaxies have been selected to lie in a narrow range of maximum circular velocities , they nevertheless exhibit a significant dispersion in the final stellar masses and metallicities . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis suggests that this dispersion results from the different accretion histories of the parent dark matter haloes . </S>",
    "<S> statically , we also find evidences to support the milky way as a typical sb / sc galaxy in the same mass range , providing a suitable benchmark to constrain numerical models of galaxy formation .    </S>",
