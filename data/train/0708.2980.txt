    "some of the most relevant properties of the universe have been established through astronomical data associated to light curves of distant supernova ia @xcite , the temperature anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background radiation @xcite and the matter power spectrum of large scale structures @xcite .",
    "such observations give a strong evidence that the geometry of the universe is flat and that our universe is undertaking an accelerated expansion at the present epoch .",
    "this acceleration is attributed to a dominant dark energy component , whose most popular candidate is the cosmological constant , @xmath0 .",
    "the present days dominance of dark energy make us wonder if this component may affect the formation and stability of large astrophysical structures , whose physics is basically newtonian .",
    "this is in fact an old question put forward already by einstein @xcite and pursued by many other authors @xcite and @xcite . in general , the problem is rooted in the question whether the expansion of the universe , which in the newtonian sense could be understood as a repulsive force , affects local astrophysical properties of large objects .",
    "the answer is certainly affirmative if part of the terms responsible for the universe expansion survives the newtonian limit of the einstein equations .",
    "this is indeed the case of @xmath0 which is part of the einstein tensor .",
    "in fact , as explained in the main text below , all the effects of the universe expansion can be taken into account , regardless of the model , by generalizing the newtonian limit .",
    "this approach allow us to calculate the impact of a given cosmological model on astrophysical structures .",
    "although , there are several candidates to dark energy which have their own cosmological signature , e.g. @xcite and @xcite , in this paper we will investigate the @xmath0cdm model only .",
    "such consideration is in fact not restrictive and our results will be common to most dark energy models . at astrophysical scales and within the newtonian limit one does not expect to find important differences among the different dark energy models .",
    "this , however should not be interpreted as if @xmath0 has no effect at smaller astrophysical scales .",
    "in fact , the effects of a cosmological constant on the equilibrium and stability of astrophysical structures is not negligible , and can be of relevance to describe features of astrophysical systems such as globular clusters , galaxy clusters or even galaxies @xcite .",
    "motivated by this , we investigate the effects of a dark energy component on the newtonian limit of einstein gravity and its consequences at astrophysical scales .    in this article",
    "we investigate how the cosmological constant changes certain aspects of astrophysical hydrostatic equilibrium . in particular",
    "we search for specific imprints which are unique to the existence of a dark energy fluid .",
    "for instance , the instability of previously viable astrophysical models when @xmath0 is included .",
    "we explore such possibility using spherical configurations described by a polytropic equation of state ( e.o.s ) @xmath1 .",
    "the polytropic equation of state derives its importance from its success and consistency , and it is widely used in determining the properties of gravitational structures ranging from stars @xcite to galaxies @xcite .",
    "it leads to an acceptable description of the behavior of astrophysical objects in accordance with observations and numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "the description of such configurations can be verified in the general relativistic framework @xcite and applications of these models to the dark energy problem have in fact been explored @xcite .    the effect of a positive cosmological constant can be best visualized as a repulsive non local force acting on the matter distribution .",
    "it is clear that this extra force will result into a minimum density ( either central or average ) which is possible for the distribution to be in equilibrium .",
    "this minimum density is a crucial crossing point : below this value no matter can be in equilibrium , above this value low density objects exist @xcite .",
    "both effects are novel features due to @xmath0",
    ". we will demonstrate such inequalities , which are generalizations of corresponding inequalities found in @xcite and @xcite , for every polytropic index @xmath2 .",
    "however , the most drastic effect can be found in the limiting case of the polytropic equation of state , i.e , the isothermal sphere where the polytropic index @xmath2 goes to infinity .",
    "this case captures , as far as the effects of @xmath0 are concerned , many features also for higher , but finite @xmath2 . the model of the isothermal sphere is often used to model galaxies and galactic clusters @xcite and used in describing effects of gravitational lensing @xcite .",
    "herein lies the importance of the model . regarding the isothermal sphere",
    "we will show that @xmath0 renders the model unacceptable on general grounds .",
    "this essentially means that the model does not even have an appealing asymptotic behavior for large radii and any attempt to definite a physically acceptable radius has its severe drawbacks .    the positive cosmological constant offers , however , yet another unique opportunity , namely the possible existence of young low density virialized objects , understood as configurations that have reached virial equilibrium just at the vacuum dominated epoch ( in contrast to the structures forming during the matter dominated era , where the criteria for virialization is roughly @xmath3 ) .",
    "this low density hydrostatic / virialized objects can be explained again due to @xmath0 which now partly plays the role of the outward pressure .",
    "the applicability of fluid models , virial theorem and hydrostatic equilibrium to large astrophysical bodies has been discussed many times in the literature . for a small survey on this topic",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite where one can also find the relevant references .",
    "it is interesting to notice that dark matter halos represent a constant density background which , in the newtonian limit , objects embedded in them feel the analog to a negative cosmological constant .",
    "the equilibrium analysis for such configurations has been performed in @xcite .",
    "a negative @xmath0 will just enhance the attractive gravity effect , whereas a positive one opposes this attraction . as a result",
    "the case @xmath4 reveals different physical concepts as discussed in this paper .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we introduce the equations relevant for astrophysical systems as a result of the weak field limit and the non - relativistic limit of einstein field equations taking into account a cosmological constant .",
    "there we derive such limit taking into account the background expansion independently of the dark energy model . in section 3",
    "we derive the equations governing polytropic configurations , the equilibrium conditions and stability criteria . in section 4",
    "we describe the isothermal sphere and investigate its applicability in the presence of @xmath0 . in section 5",
    "we explore some examples of astrophysical configurations where the cosmological constant may play a relevant role .",
    "in particular , we probe into low density objects , fermion ( neutrino ) stars and boson stars .",
    "finally we perform an important comparison between polytropic configurations with @xmath0 and parameterized density of dark matter halos .",
    "we end with conclusions .",
    "we use units @xmath5 except in section 5.4 where we restore @xmath6 and use natural units @xmath7 .",
    "the dynamics of the isotropic and homogeneous cosmological background is determined by the evolution of the ( dimensionless ) scale factor given through the friedman - robertson - walker line element as solution of einstein field equations , @xmath8 , \\hspace{0.5cm}\\left[\\frac{\\dot{a}(t)}{a(t)}\\right]^{2}=h(t)^{2}=\\frac{8}{3}\\pi\\rho(t)-\\frac{k}{a^{2}(t)},\\ ] ] corresponding to the raychaudhury equation and friedman equation , respectively .",
    "the total energy density @xmath9 is a contribution from a matter component - baryonic plus dark matter - ( @xmath10 ) , radiation ( @xmath11 ) and a dark energy component ( @xmath12 with @xmath13 ) .",
    "the function @xmath14 is given as @xmath15 where the term @xmath16 represents the equation of state for the dark energy component .",
    "the case @xmath17 corresponds to the cosmological constant @xmath18 .",
    "the effects of the background on virialized structures can be explored through the newtonian limit of field equations from which one can derive a modified poisson s equation ( see e.g. @xcite ) . recalling",
    "that pressure is also a source for gravity , the gravitational potential produced by an overdensity is given by @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 . where @xmath22 is the local overdensity with respect to the background density @xmath9 .",
    "notice that equation ( [ o ] ) reduces to the usual poisson equation , @xmath23 , when non relativistic matter dominates the universe , and @xmath24 .",
    "however , at present times , when dark energy dominates , the pressure is non - negligible and @xmath25 might even be non zero , such as in the case of quintessence models @xcite . in this work , however , we will focus in the case of an homogeneous dark energy component where @xmath26 . with this in mind , one can then write the modified poisson equation as @xmath27 note that this equation allows one to probe local effects of different dark energy models through the term @xmath28 given in eq.([fri ] ) .    since we will be investigating the configuration and stability of astrophysical objects nowadays ,",
    "when dark energy dominates , it is more instructive to write the above equations in terms of an effective vacuum density i.e. @xmath29 where by using ( [ fri ] ) @xmath30 has been defined as @xmath31{\\rho_{\\rm vac}},\\ ] ] which reduces to @xmath32 for @xmath17 and negligible contribution from the cold dark matter component with respect to the over - density @xmath22 . with @xmath33 being the solution associated to the pure gravitational interaction , the full solution for the potential",
    "can be simply written as @xmath34 which defines the newton - hooke space - time for a scale factor close to the present time ( vacuum dominated epoch ) , @xmath17 and @xmath35 @xcite . for a @xmath0cdm universe with @xmath36 and @xmath37",
    "we get @xmath38 : that is , the positive density of matter which has an attractive effect opposing the repulsive one of @xmath0 reduces effectively the strength of the external force in ( [ pois ] ) .",
    "note that , although in the text we will use the notation @xmath39 which would be vaild in the case of a newton - hook space time , it must be understood that we can replace @xmath32 by @xmath40 for a @xmath0cdm background .",
    "given the potential @xmath41 , we can write the euler s equation for a self - gravitating configuration as @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the ( statistical ) mean velocity and @xmath9 is the total energy density in the system .",
    "we can go beyond euler s equation and write down the tensor virial equation which reduces to its scalar version for spherical configurations .",
    "the ( scalar ) virial equation with the background contribution reads as @xcite @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the gravitational potential energy defined by @xmath46 and @xmath47 is the contribution of ordered motions to the kinetic energy . also , @xmath48 is the moment of inertia about the center of the configuration and @xmath49 is the trace of the dispersion tensor .",
    "the full description of a self gravitating configuration is completed with an equation for mass conservation , energy conservation and an equation of state @xmath50 .",
    "if we assume equilibrium via @xmath51 , we obtain the known virial theorem @xcite @xmath52 ) , which is valid in the case when we define the boundary of the configuration where @xmath53 .    with @xmath54 given in ( [ rhoeff ] )",
    ", one must be aware that an equilibrium configuration is at the most a dynamical one .",
    "this is to say that the external repulsive force in ( [ rhoeff ] ) is time dependent through the inclusion of the background expansion and so are the terms in ( [ virialeq ] ) .",
    "this leads to a violation of energy conservation , which also occurs in the virialization process @xcite ) .",
    "traced over cosmological times , this implies that if we insist on the second derivative of the inertial tensor to be zero , then the internal properties of the object like angular velocity or the internal mean velocity of the components will change with time .",
    "even if in the simplest case , one can assume that the objects shape and its density remain constant .",
    "hence , equilibrium here can be thought of as represented by long time averages in which case the second derivative also vanishes , not because of constant volume and density , but because of stability @xcite .",
    "the expressions derived in the last section , especially ( [ pois ] ) and ( [ virial ] ) can be used for testing dark energy models on configurations in a dynamical state of equilibrium . however , in these cases , one should point out that , in this approach there is no energy conservation within the overdensity : dark energy flows in and out of the overdensity .",
    "such feature is a consequence of the assumption that dark energy does not cluster at small scales ( homogeneity of dark energy ) .",
    "this is in fact the most common assumption in the literature@xcite , with a few exceptions investigated in @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we will concentrate on the possible effects of a background dominated by a dark energy component represented by the cosmological constant at late times ( @xmath551 ) .",
    "it implies that the total density involved in the definitions of the integral quantities appearing in the virial equation can be approximated to @xmath56 . in that case",
    "the poisson equation reduces to the form @xmath57 .",
    "as mentioned before , the symbol @xmath32 has no multiplicative factors in the case of a newton - hooke space time , while for a @xmath0cdm model it must be understood as @xmath58 .",
    "as the reader will see , the most relevant quantities derived here come in forms of ratio of a characterizing density and @xmath32 , and hence the extra factor appearing in the @xmath0cdm can be re - introduced in the characterizing density . for general consideration of equilibrium in the spherical case see @xcite and @xcite , while the quasi spherical collapse with cosmological constant has been discussed in @xcite .",
    "we can determine the relevant features of astrophysical systems by solving the dynamical equations describing a self gravitating configuration ( euler s equation , poisson s equation , continuity equations ) . in order to achieve this goal",
    "we must first know the potential @xmath59 to be able to calculate the gravitational potential energy . to obtain @xmath59",
    ", one must supply the density profile and solve poisson s equation . in certain cases ,",
    "the potential is given and we therefore can solve for the density profile in a simple way . here",
    "we face the situation where no information on the potential ( aside from its boundary conditions ) is available and we also do not have an apriori information about the density profile ( see for instance @xcite for related examples ) . in order to determine both , the potential and the density profile , a complete description of astrophysical systems required .",
    "this means we need to know an equation of state @xmath60 ( here we change notation and we call @xmath9 the proper density of the system ) .",
    "the equation of state can take several forms and the most widely used one is the so - called _ polytropic equation of state _ , expressed as @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the polytropic index and @xmath63 is a parameter that depends on the polytropic index , central density , the mass and the radius of the system .",
    "the exponent @xmath62 is defined as @xmath64 and is associated with processes with constant ( non - zero ) specific heat @xmath65 .",
    "it reduces to the adiabatic exponent if @xmath66 . the polytropic equation of state was introduced to model fully convective configurations . from a statistical point of view , eq .",
    "( [ poly ] ) represents a collisionless system whose distribution function can be written in the form @xmath67 , with @xmath68 being the relative energy and @xmath69 being the relative potential ( where @xmath70 is a constant chosen such that @xmath71)@xcite . in astrophysical contexts , the polytropic equation of state is widely used to describe astrophysical systems such as the sun , compact objects , galaxies and galaxy clusters @xcite .",
    "we now derive the well known lane - emden equation .",
    "we start from poisson equation and euler equation for spherically symmetric configurations , written as @xmath72    le equation for different @xmath73 and different index @xmath2 ranging from @xmath74 ( red , short - dashed line ) , @xmath75 ( blue , long - dashed line ) and @xmath76 ( green , dot short - dashed line).,width=453 ]    this set of equations together with eq .",

    "( [ new1 ] ) in conjunction with eq .",
    "( [ yyy1 ] ) it is clear that @xmath32 will have the effect to increase the value of @xmath79 .",
    "therefore the boundary of the configuration will be located in a greater @xmath80 as compared to the case @xmath81 . in order to determine the behavior of the density profile , we again combine eq([poly+pois ] ) and eq.([poly ] ) in order to eliminate the potential @xmath82 .",
    "we obtain @xmath83 where we defined the function @xmath84 we can rewrite eq ( [ arbigeo2 ] ) by introducing the variable @xmath85 defined by @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is the central density .",
    "we also introduce the variable @xmath88 where @xmath89 is a length scale .",
    "eq.([arbigeo2 ] ) is finally written as @xcite @xmath90 this is the @xmath0-lane - emden equation ( @xmath91 ) .",
    "note that for constant density , we recover @xmath92 as the first non trivial solution of @xmath91 equation .",
    "this is consistent with the results from virial theorem for constant density spherical objects which tell us that @xmath93 @xcite .",
    "note that using eq .",
    "( [ new1 ] ) we can write the solution @xmath94 with the explicit contribution of @xmath32 as @xmath95 so that for a given @xmath96 smaller than the radius we will obtain @xmath97 as already pointed out before . then the differential equation ( [ le ] ) must be solved with the initial conditions @xmath98 , satisfied by ( [ new2 ] ) .",
    "numerical solutions were obtained for the first time in @xcite .",
    "the solutions presented in fig .",
    "[ lanea ] are given in terms of the ratio @xmath99 for @xmath100 and @xmath76 .",
    "this choice of variables are useful also since @xmath32 sets a fundamental scale of density ( the choice @xmath101 will be explored for the isothermal sphere , where figure [ lanea ] will be helpful for discussions ) .",
    "the radius of a polytropic configuration is determined as the value of @xmath96 when the density of matter with the e.o.s ( [ poly ] ) vanishes .",
    "this happens at a radius located at @xmath102 note that equation ( [ le ] ) yields a transcendental equation to determine @xmath103 .",
    "also one notes from fig .",
    "[ lanea ] that not all values of @xmath104 yield allowed configurations in the sense that we can not find a value of @xmath103 such that @xmath105 .",
    "this might not be surprising since for @xmath76 and @xmath106 we find the situation where the asymptotic behavior is @xmath107 as @xmath108 ( we consider this still as an acceptable behavior ) .",
    "there is , however , one crucial difference when we switch on a non - zero @xmath0 . for @xmath109 not only we can not reach a definite radius but the derivative of the density changes sign and",
    "hence becomes non - physical .",
    "the situation for the cases @xmath110 is somewhat similar to the extreme case of @xmath111 ( isothermal sphere ) . clearly , these features are responsible of the last term in eq.([new2 ] ) , which for high values of @xmath112 may become dominant over the remaining ( gravitational ) terms",
    ". we will discuss this case in section four where we will attempt another definition of a finite radius with the constraint @xmath113 .",
    "for now it is sufficient to mention that , as expected , the radius of the allowed configurations are larger than the corresponding radius when @xmath106",
    ".      in this section we will derive the equilibrium conditions for polytropic configurations in the presence of a positive cosmological constant .",
    "we will use the results of last section in order to write down the virial theorem .",
    "the total mass of the configuration can be determined as usual with @xmath114 together with eq.([le ] ) .",
    "one then has a relation between the mass , the radius and the central density : @xmath115 where @xmath116 note that we have introduced the cosmological constant in the equation for the radius , leading to the appearance of the astrophysical length scale @xmath117 ( with @xmath118mpc @xmath119 mpc for the concordance values @xmath120 and @xmath121 ) .",
    "this scale has been already found in the context of schwarzschild - de sitter metric where it is the maximum allowed radius for bound orbits . at the same time it is",
    "the scale of the maximum radius for a self gravitating spherical and homogeneous configuration in the presence of a positive @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "this also let us relate the mean density of the configuration with its central density and/or cosmological parameters as @xmath122 .",
    "similarly we can determine the other relevant quantities appearing in the equations for the energy and the scalar virial theorem ( [ virial ] ) .",
    "for the traces of the moment of inertia tensor and the dispersion tensor @xmath123 we can write @xmath124 where the functions @xmath125 have been defined as @xmath126 using ( [ radius3 ] ) .",
    "these functions are numerically determined in the sequence @xmath127 , such that for a given mass we obtain the radius as @xmath128 .",
    "let us consider the virial theorem ( [ virial ] ) for a polytropic configuration .",
    "the gravitational potential energy @xmath45 can be obtained following the same arguments shown in @xcite .",

    "we recover the condition @xmath134 ( @xmath135 ) for gravitationally bounded configurations in equilibrium . on the other hand , for @xmath136 this condition might not be completely true due to the following reasoning : the two - body effective potential in the presence of a positive cosmological constant does not go asymptotically to zero for large distances , which is to say that @xmath133 is not stringent enough to guarantee a bound system .",
    "therefore , we rather rely on the numerical solutions from which , for every @xmath2 , we infer the value of @xmath137 such that @xmath138 this gives us the lowest possible central density in terms of @xmath39 . the behavior of the @xmath139 , the functions @xmath140 , the solution @xmath141 and the values of @xmath142 are shown in fig [ tablelane2 ] .",

    "a @xmath76 polytrope is highly concentrated at the center @xcite .",
    "no criteria can be written since even for @xmath81 there is not a finite radius .",
    "but it is this high concentration at the center and a smooth asymptotic behavior which makes this case still a viable phenomenological model if @xmath0 is zero . on the contrary for non - zero , positive @xmath0",

    "the polytropic e.o.s describes an ideal gas ( isothermal sphere ) . since in this limit",
    "the expressions derived before are not well definite , this case will be explored in more detail in the next section . in spite of the mathematical differences , the isothermal sphere bears many similarities to the cases @xmath110 and",
    "our conclusions regarding the definition of a radius in the @xmath111 case equally apply to finite @xmath2 bigger than @xmath153 .     and different polytropic index in a modified newton - hook space time with a dark energy equation of state @xmath154 ( black , dots ) and @xmath155 ( red , short dash ) .",
    "compare with fig.[lanea],width=453 ]      in the last section we have explored the effects of a dark energy - dominated background with the equation of state @xmath17 .",
    "other dark energy models are often used with @xmath156 and @xmath154 or even @xmath157 , in the so - called phantom regime , or even a time dependent dark energy model ( quintessence ) . a simple generalization to such models",
    "can be easily done by making the following replacement in our equations @xmath158 where @xmath159 , and where the function @xmath14 is defined in eq.([fa ] ) .",
    "note that for this generalization to be coherent with the derivation of @xmath0le in ( [ le ] ) , one needs to consider that the equation of state is close to @xmath160 , so that there is almost no time - dependence , and the energy density for dark energy is almost constant .",
    "this is indeed the case for most popular candidates of dark energy specially at low redshifts @xmath161 .",
    "also , notice once again , that we are still assuming an homogeneous dark energy component which flows freely to and from the overdensity .",
    "hence , violating energy conservation inside it . clearly , other models of dark energy will posses dynamical properties that the cosmological constant does not have .",
    "for instance , we could allow some fraction of dark energy to take part in the collapse and virialization @xcite , which would lead to the presence of self and cross interaction terms for dark energy and the ( polytropic like ) matter in euler equation , which at the end modifies the lane emden equation . with this simplistic approach",
    ", we see that the effects with a general equation of state are smaller than those associated to the cosmological constant .",
    "in particular , the equation of state @xmath156 displays a null effects since it implies @xmath162 ( note that this equation of state can also resemble the curvature term in evolution equation for the background ) . on the other hand , phantom models of dark energy , which are associated to equations of state @xmath157@xcite ,",
    "have quite a strong effect . in fig . [ laneph ]",
    "we show numerical solutions of lane - emden equations for a background dominated with dark energy with @xmath154 and a phantom dark energy with @xmath155 , with @xmath163 .",

    "clearly equations of state with @xmath164 will generate larger radius than the case described in the main text .",

    "stability criteria for polytropic configurations can be derived from the virial equation . using equations ( [ piner ] ) , ( [ pintener ] ) and ( [ poliwc ] ) we can write the virial theorem ( [ virial ] ) in terms of the radius @xmath80 and the mass @xmath166 : @xmath167 where we have assumed that the only contribution to the kinetic energy comes from the pressure in the form of @xmath168 .",
    "note that for @xmath81 and finite mass , one obtains @xmath169 while for @xmath136 we would obtain a cubic equation for the radius . instead of solving for the virial radius , we solve for the mass as a function of central density with the help of eq ( [ radius3 ] ) . we have @xmath170^{\\frac{3}{2}}.\\ ] ]",
    "the explicit dependence of the mass with respect to the central density splits into two parts : on one hand it has the same form as the usual case with @xmath106 , that is , @xmath171 ; on the other hand the function @xmath172 has a complicated dependence on the central density because of the term @xmath173 . with the help of ( [ radius3 ] ) and ( [ fmas2aa ] ) we can write a mass - radius relation and the radius - central density relation @xmath174 following the stability theorem ( see for instance in @xcite )",

    "it is worth mentioning that by including the corrections due to general relativity , the critical value for @xmath178 is also modified as @xmath182 @xcite and hence for compact objects the correction to the critical polytropic index is stronger from the effects of general relativity than from the effects of the background .",
    "this is as we would expect it .",

    "conditions when this happens were derived . on the other hand , approaching with our parameters these limiting conditions , but remaining still on the side of equilibrium , means that relatively low density objects can be still in equilibrium thanks to the positive cosmological constant . the best way to investigate low density structures is to to use the lowest possible central density . as explained in section 3 , for every @xmath2 there",
    "exist a @xmath142 such that @xmath197 which defines the lowest central density .",
    "certainly , a question of interest is to see what such objects would look like .",
    "we start with the parameters of the configuration .",
    "the radius at the critical value @xmath139 is given by eq.([radius3 ] ) after taking the limit @xmath198 ( see ( [ an ] ) ) .",
    "it is given by @xmath199 from fig .",
    "[ lanecrit ] we can see that the product @xmath200 changes a little round the value @xmath201 as we change the index @xmath2 , so that these polytropic configurations will have roughly the same radius ( for a given mass ) .",
    "this implies that such configurations have approximately the same average density @xmath202 .",
    "that is , such configurations have a mean density of the order of the of the critical density of the universe .",
    "given such a density we would , at the first glance , suspect that the object described by this density can not be in equilibrium .",
    "however , our result follows strictly from hydrostatic equilibrium and therefore there is no doubt that such object can theoretically exist .",
    "furthermore , @xmath203 satisfies the inequalities derived in @xcite and @xcite from virial equations and buchdahl inequalities which guarantee that the object is in equilibrium ( @xmath204 ) .",

    "however , we have not tried to solve explicitly quantities from the virial theorem .",
    "this makes sense as for dark matter halos ( dmh ) the parametrized density profiles go often only asymptotically to zero and the radius of dmh is defined as a virial radius where the density is approximately two hundred times over the critical one .",
    "therefore , an analysis using virial equations seems to be adequate here . for constant density eq.([vpol ] ) can be expressed as a cubic equation @xcite for the radius at which the virial theorem is satisfied ( let us ignore for these analysis any surface terms coming from the tensor virial equation ) . however , if the density is not constant , this expression becomes a transcendental equation for the dimensionless radius @xmath208 .",

    "the resulting average density is then of the order of the value predicted by the top - hat sphericall model : @xmath215 note with the help of eq.([a ] ) and ( [ rque ] ) that the mass can be written as proportional to the parameter @xmath216 ( introduced in the polytropic equation of state eq.([poly ] ) ) .",
    "therefore @xmath217 is equivalent to choosing a small pressure and , at the same time , a small mass which , in case of a relatively small radius , amounts to a diluted configuration with small density and pressure . without @xmath0",
    "such configurations would be hardly in equilibrium .",
    "hence , for the configuration which has the extension of pc , eq.([xxx14 ] ) , with one solar mass we conclude that the equilibrium is not fully due to the pressure , but partially maintained also by @xmath0 .",

    "other mean densities , also independent of @xmath166 are for @xmath218 and @xmath75 , respectively : @xmath219 the first value is close to @xmath220 and therefore also to @xmath39 .",
    "certainly , if in this example we choose a small mass , equivalent to choosing a negligible pressure , part of the equilibrium is maintained by the repulsive force of @xmath0 .",
    "in @xcite we found a simple solution of the hydrostatic equation which has a constant density of the order of @xmath39 .",

    "for this situation one has @xmath232 and @xmath233 . on the other hand , for @xmath224 one",
    "obtains @xmath234 and the radius is given by @xmath235 where @xmath236 is the mean density of the sun .",
    "since for these configurations the ratio @xmath173 is much smaller than @xmath237 we see from fig .",
    "[ tablelane2 ] that the effects of @xmath0 are almost negligible .",
    "the critical value of the ratio @xmath173 gives for @xmath74 the inequality @xmath238 and for @xmath224 the same limit reads @xmath239 .",
    "central densities of white dwarfs are of the order of @xmath240 which corresponds to a deviation of nearly thirty orders of magnitude of @xmath39 .",
    "an interesting possibility is to determine the effects of @xmath241 on configurations formed by light fermions .",
    "such configurations can be used , for instance , to model galactic halos @xcite .",
    "while discussing the phenomenological interest of fermion stars below , we intend to describe such a halo .",
    "clearly , these kind of systems will maintain equilibrium by counterbalancing gravity with the degeneracy pressure as in a white dwarf .",
    "for stable configurations ,",
    "i.e , @xmath224 , one must replace the mass of the electron and nucleon by the mass of the considered fermion and set @xmath242 in ( [ kn ] ) and ( [ fmas2aa ] ) .",
    "we then get for the mass and the radius : @xmath243 on the other hand , for @xmath74 one has @xmath244 the cases represent , among other , possible cosmological configurations when the fermion mass if of the order of ev , for instance , massive neutrinos .     and @xmath224 .",
    "the masses range from @xmath245 ev up to @xmath246 ev.,width=377 ]    in figure [ tablelane244 ] some representative values for the choice @xmath247 ev up to @xmath248 ev are given .",
    "obviously in the case @xmath218 the values for the mass and radius are sensitive to the choice of @xmath249 .",
    "indeed , the dependence on the fermion mass is much stronger than on the central density .",
    "it is justified to speculate that a relative low density objects , affected by @xmath0 , might exist .",
    "if then , as in an example we choose @xmath250 ev and @xmath251 then the mass comes out as @xmath252 solar masses with a radius of the order of magnitude of half mpc which might indeed be the dark matter halo of a galaxy ( or at least part of the halo ) . as pointed out before",
    ", such configurations must have a central density greater than @xmath253 in order to be in equilibrium . from table [ tablelane2a ]",
    "we see that the effect on a configuration with @xmath254 is represented in an increase in the mass by @xmath255 with respect to @xmath256 and an increment of @xmath257 in the radius .",
    "then the conclusion would be that @xmath0 affects such a dark matter halo .",
    "this is to be taken with some caution as the fermions in such a configuration would be essentially non - relativistic .",
    "note also that it is not clear if neutrinos make up a large fraction of the halo , however , we can also speculate about a low density clustering around luminous matter . of course , allowing larger central density might change the picture .",
    "however , the emerging scenario would not necessarily be a viable phenomenological model .",
    "for instance , changing the value of @xmath249 from ev to kev ( mev ) would reduce the mass by twelve ( twenty four ) orders of magnitude which is definitely too small to be of interest . we could counterbalance this by increasing the central density by twenty four ( forty eight ! ) orders of magnitude . such a countermeasure would , however , result in a reduction of the radius by eight ( sixteen ! ) orders of magnitude , again a too small length scale to be of importance for dark matter halos . in other words ,",
    "the example with a fermion mass of the order of one ev and low central density is certainly of some phenomenological interest .",
    "the case @xmath74 is similarly stringent .",
    "a neutrino mass of @xmath258 ev gives a mass for the entire object of the order of ten to the eighteen solar masses which is too large .",
    "a fermion mass of several kev would be suitable for a galaxy halo ( a mass of the order me v and higher would give a too small total mass ) . with a relative low central density as before ( see figure [ tablelane244 ] ) we then obtain the right order of magnitude for the halo .",
    "but then we will have to live with the fact that such halo reaches up to the next large galaxy .",
    "briefly , we touch upon the other possible application of fermions stars which have been discussed as candidates for the central object in our galaxy . if we allow the extension of this object to be @xmath259 au and the mass roughly @xmath260 million solar masses , then the fermion mass would come out as @xmath261 ev for @xmath218 ( @xmath262 ev for @xmath74 ) and the central density as @xmath263 ( @xmath264 for @xmath74 ) .",
    "we end the section by putting forward a speculative question in connection with boson stars .",
    "the latter are general relativistic geons and can be treated exactly only in general relativistic framework i.e. these kind of configurations are based on the interaction of a massive scalar field and gravitation which leads to gravitational bounded systems .",
    "these objects have been also widely discussed as candidates for dark matter @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "variational methods in the connection with the thomas - fermi equations give relatively good results even without invoking the whole general relativistic formalism . by including @xmath0 we essentially introduce into the theory a new scale ,",
    "say in this case a length scale @xmath265 . the basic parameters of dimension length in a theory with a boson mass @xmath266 and a total mass @xmath267 where @xmath268 is the number of bosons are ( for a better distinction of the different length scales , we restore in this subsection the value of @xmath6 ) @xmath269 the resulting radius of the object s extension can be a combination of these scales i.e. @xmath270 and similar combination of higher order . which one of the combination gets chosen , depends on the details of the model . in a close analogy to @xcite",
    "we can examine this taking into account the presence of a positive cosmological constant by considering the energy of such configuration as a two variable function of the mass and the radius @xmath271 @xmath272 the first term corresponds to the total kinetic energy written as @xmath273 and taking @xmath274 .",
    "the second term is the gravitational potential energy and the third term corresponds to the contribution of the background ( see eq .",
    "( [ virialeq ] ) ) . by treating mass and radius as independent variables ( we think this this is the right procedure since the radius will depend on the external force due to @xmath32 ) , we extremize the energy leading to the following values of mass and radius : @xmath275 such values would lead to a mean density of the order of @xmath276 i.e. an extremely low density configuration .",
    "the mass given in the last expression is the so - called kaup limit @xcite . of course",
    ", this relative simple treatment does not guarantee that the full , general relativistic treatment , will give the same results .",
    "therefore we consider it as a conjecture .",
    "however , it is also obvious from the the discussion above that low density boson stars are a real possibility worth pursuing with more rigor ( we intend to do so in the near future ) .",
    "it is of some importance to see whether our results from the examination of polytropic hydrostatic equilibrium or from the virial equations can be applied to dark matter configurations .",
    "n - body simulations based in a @xmath0cdm model of the universe show that the density profile of virialized dark matter halos ( dmh ) can be described by a profile of the form @xcite @xmath277 where @xmath278 is the characteristic radius ( the logarithmic slope is @xmath279 ) , @xmath280 and the index @xmath281 characterizes the slope of the profile in the central regions of the halo .",
    "the mass of the configuration enclosed in the virial radius @xmath282 is given as @xmath283 such that one can write @xmath284 , where @xmath285 is the concentration parameter , @xmath286 is the ratio between the mean density at the time of virialization and the critical density of the universe ( @xmath287 in the top - hat model for a flat einstein - desitter universe , while @xmath288 in the @xmath0cdm cosmological model @xcite ) and @xmath289 .",
    "this _ universal profile _ has been widely used in modeling dmh in galaxy clusters , and the comparison of these models with a stellar polytropic - like profile -without the explicit contribution from the cosmological constant in the lane - emden equation- can be found in @xcite .",
    "some differences can be described between the @xmath0le and the nfw profiles .",
    "first , on fundamental grounds , it is clear that the nfw profile does not satisfy the le equation ; a basic reason for this is that dark matter is assumed to be collisionless and is only affected by gravity .",
    "however , the fact that the real nature of dark matter is still an unsolved issue leaves an open door through which one can introduce interaction between dark matter particles leading to a different equation of state ( see for instance @xcite ) . on functional forms",
    ", one sees that at the central region the difference is abrupt , since the lane - emden equation has a flat density profile at @xmath290 , while the nfw profile has a cuspy profile of the form @xmath291 .",
    "it has been widely discussed how such cuspy profile is inconsistent with data showing central regions of clusters with homogeneous cores ( see discussion at the end of this section ) .",
    "such small slope in the inner regions can be reproduced by the _",
    "universal profile _ for the case @xmath292 , and for the profile derived from the @xmath0le equation ( which is just a consequence of initial conditions , and hence , its independent of @xmath0 ) . in this case , the effects of the cosmological constant can be reduced to explore the outer regions of the halos and compare , for instance , the slope of the profiles and the virial radius predicted by each one .",

    "( blus , solid line ) for four different values of @xmath2.,width=453 ]    we see that the virial radius given by the @xmath0le equation is surprisingly close to the virial radius given by the nfw profile for @xmath74 in the range of masses shown in fig [ raddd ] , and as pointed in eq.([contrast ] ) , this value yields for this model @xmath301 .",
    "however , as can be seen from the plots , the @xmath0le density profile is almost flat until the virial radius . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath292 profile allow us to parameterize it as @xmath302 , where the concentration parameter @xmath65 can be written as @xmath303 .",

    "we see that the virial radius are of the same order of magnitude than the one predicted by the nfw profile . for @xmath294 , these quantities differ by one order of magnitude . in all cases ,",
    "the slope of the nfw profiles changes faster than the @xmath0le profile , which implies that the polytropic configurations enclosed by @xmath282 display almost a constant density .    the comparison we made above between the polytropic configuration and the nfw profiles shows that up to the cuspy behaviour the polytropic results agree with nfw for the polytropic index @xmath74 .",
    "it is worth pointing out here that it is exactly this cuspy behaviour which seems to be at odds with observational facts @xcite .",
    "our result for @xmath74 is then a good candidate to describe dmh .",
    "indeed , the undesired feature of the cuspy behaviour led at least some groups to model the dmh as a polytropic configuration @xcite . sometimes it is claimed that a polytropic model is favoured over the results from n - body simulation @xcite .",
    "however , the oscillatory behavior of the @xmath74 solutions of the @xmath0le represents a disadvantage when compared with the nfw profiles , although the region of physical interest ( below the virial radius ) is well represented by the solutions of @xmath0le .",
    "in this paper we have explored the effects of a positive cosmological constant on the equilibrium and stability of astrophysical configurations with a polytropic equation of state .",
    "we have found that the radius of these kind of configurations is affected in the sense that not all polytropic indices yield configurations with definite radius even in the asymptotic sense . among other ,",
    "the widely used isothermal sphere model becomes a non - viable model in the presence of @xmath0 unless we are ready to introduce an arbitrary cut - off which renders the model unappealing .",
    "indeed , in this particular case we have tried different definitions of a finite radius with the result that none of them seems to be justified , either from the phenomenological or from the theoretical point of view .",
    "this is then an interesting global result : @xmath0 not only affects quantitatively certain properties of large , low - density astrophysical structures , but it also excludes certain commonly used models regardless what density we use .    for polytropic indexes @xmath304 and for _ certain values",
    "_ of the central density we can not find a well definite radius .",
    "these _ certain values _ are encoded in a generalization of the equilibrium condition found for spherical configurations ( i.e , @xmath305 ) written now as @xmath149 .",
    "we obtain @xmath306 , @xmath307 , @xmath308 , @xmath309 .",
    "these values set a minimal central density for a given polytropic index @xmath2 .",
    "we have discussed such minimal density configurations and determined their average density which strongly depend on @xmath2 .",
    "interestingly , the radius of such configurations has a connection to the length scale which appears in the schwarzschild- de sitter as the maximally possible radius for bound orbits @xcite .",
    "in this framework we found also a solution of very low , non - constant density .",
    "indeed , the limiting value of the central density in the above equations is a crucial point . below this value",
    "no matter can be in equilibrium .",
    "however , above this value low density objects can still exist .",
    "both effects are due to @xmath0 : in the first case the external repulsive force is too strong for the matter to be in equilibrium , in the second case this force can counterbalance the attractive newtonian gravity effects ( even if the pressure is small ) .",
    "other examples of low density configuration which we examined in some detail are neutrino stars with mass of the order @xmath310 ev and @xmath310 kev .",
    "in there we found that a nowadays dominating cosmological constant affects both the mass as well as the radius of such exotic objects .",
    "such effect could change those physical quantities several orders of magnitude .",
    "the magnitude of such effects , however , depend on the fermionic masses and on the assumption that the fermions in such a configuration would be essentially non - relativistic .",
    "finally , we made a conjecture regarding boson stars , and used variational methods in connection with the thomas - fermi equations which could give relatively good results even without invoking the whole general relativistic formalism , we then found extremely low density configurations for such astrophysical objects .",
    "notice however , that this conjecture relied purely on arguments based on scales and in fact needs a full general relativistic investigation to confirm the results here obtained .",
    "we have compared polytropic configurations with dark matter density profiles from n - body simulations .",
    "surprisingly , we find a reasonable agreement between both approaches for the polytropic index @xmath74 and restricting ourselves to the virial radius .",
    "our model does not have the the undesired features of the cuspy behaviour of the nfw profiles .",
    "the importance of the astrophysical properties and configurations found in this article is that they are specific features to the existence of a dark energy component .",
    "hence , such configurations ( e.g , low density configurations ) or properties , if ever found in nature would imply a strong evidence for the presence of a dark energy component .",

    "<S> we derive the conditions for equilibrium and stability of such configurations and consider some astrophysical examples where our analysis may be relevant . </S>",
    "<S> we show that in the presence of the cosmological constant the isothermal sphere is not a viable astrophysical model since the density in this model does not go asymptotically to zero . </S>",
    "<S> the cosmological constant implies that , for polytropic index smaller than five , the central density has to exceed a certain minimal value in terms of the vacuum density in order to guarantee the existence of a finite size object . </S>",
    "<S> we examine such configurations together with effects of @xmath0 in other exotic possibilities , such as neutrino and boson stars , and we compare our results to n - body simulations . the astrophysical properties and configurations found in this article are specific features resulting from the existence of a dark energy component . hence </S>",
