    "disorder usually has a strong impact on critical phenomena , a hallmark example being the influence of spatially uncorrelated quenched disorder on the second - order phase transition , the relevance of which is predicted by the harris criterion @xcite .",
    "such a universal result is , however , generally lacking in systems far from equilibrium .",
    "there are few exceptions , and particularly well - studied are driven diffusive systems , in particular the asymmetric simple exclusion process ( asep ) , for which even a version of the harris criterion can be established @xcite .",
    "being exactly solvable @xcite , asep has attracted a lot of attention due to its connection with quantum spin chains @xcite , nonequilibrium phase transitions @xcite and wide range of applications like surface growth @xcite , traffic @xcite and biological transport @xcite .",
    "asep is a simple model describing classical particles hopping in the preferred direction on a discrete lattice and interacting only by the exclusion principle that forbids two particles from occupying the same lattice site ( for reviews , see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "disorder in asep is introduced by assigning random ( but quenched ) hopping rates either to sites or particles . in the simplest case of a single defect particle hopping at rate @xmath4 ,",
    "the exact solution was found @xcite , with the conclusion that the defect induces phase coexistence through the creation of shocks for all particle densities @xmath5 .",
    "a similar conclusion was obtained for a model with an arbitrary number of slow particles solved simultaneously by evans @xcite and ferrari and krug @xcite , who observed that the appearance of shocks is determined solely by the slowest particle in the system . on the contrary ,",
    "asep with a single defect site is still an open problem .",
    "although early studies of this problem in various contexts @xcite provided strong arguments that a single defect always induces phase separation ( i.e. for all @xmath4 ) , several later studies suggested the existence of a threshold value @xmath6 above which the shocks disappear @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "no such `` shock - free '' scenario is possible for the full site - wise disorder , as pointed out by tripathy and barma @xcite in the particular case of a binomial distribution .",
    "the reason behind this is essentially a geometric one , in a sense that disorder creates a long stretch ( `` bottleneck '' ) of slow sites that limits the current and ensures the shocks to appear as soon as this limiting value is reached .",
    "the fact that phase coexistence appears for any distribution of disorder @xcite raises the following question : do such disorder - induced large - scale inhomogeneities in density profiles persist if one relaxes the geometrical constraint by allowing the particles to move around defects ?",
    "the purpose of our paper is to answer this question by considering two different realizations of bypassing in asep with disorder . in the first model",
    "we introduce long - range jumps weighted by a probability that decays with distance @xmath0 as @xmath7 , where @xmath2 to ensure finite current .",
    "the choice for this particular model is motivated by the fact that it may lack the phase coexistence in the presence of a single defect @xcite . from the technical point of view , in the absence of disorder the model retains most of the characteristics of the short - range asep , but is more accurately described by the mean - field approach than in the short - range case @xcite .",
    "the second model we consider is the short - range asep in two dimensions , where disorder is present only in the direction of driving .",
    "this model is far from being just academic .",
    "it may be considered in a broader context of various transport phenomena in random media , ranging from a fluid flowing through a porous medium @xcite , a traffic flow in the presence of obstacles @xcite to , more recently , a transport of microfluidic droplets through various geometries @xcite .",
    "common to all these systems is the nontrivial interplay between driving , mutual interactions and the underlying geometry , which altogether may reduce the conductivity , in some cases even completely @xcite .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "results for the long - ranged asep in one dimension are presented in section 2 .",
    "the short - range asep in two dimensions is introduced in section 3 , where we first analyse the current - density relation and then consider the anisotropic limit of hopping rates .",
    "a summary of results is presented in section 4 .",
    "we consider the model with @xmath8 particles distributed on @xmath9 sites of a one - dimensional ( @xmath10d)lattice with periodic boundary conditions , where each site is either occupied by a particle ( @xmath11 ) , or is empty ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "dynamics is implemented by randomly choosing one particle during an infinitesimal interval @xmath13 and attempting to move it @xmath0 sites to the right , where @xmath14 is taken from the probability distribution @xmath15 , @xmath16 being the partial sum of the riemann zeta function .",
    "if the target site is empty , the move is accepted ; otherwise , it is rejected . additionally , we introduce @xmath17 ( @xmath18 being concentration ) fixed but randomly distributed ( defect ) sites in a way that the rate of hopping is weighted by the additional factor @xmath4 whenever particle jumps either _ to _ or _ from _ a defect site ( see for illustration ) .",
    "this particular choice of disorder fulfils two purposes : first , the particles can bypass the defect sites by the long - ranged jumps and second , the particle - hole symmetry is preserved .",
    "the latter is , in fact , not essential to our conclusions , but makes analysis of results easier .     whenever the particle jumps from , or to a defect site ( red colour ) .",
    "note that not all the possible moves are sketched , but only those that illustrate the implementation of disorder.,height=151 ]      we are interested in the stationary density profiles @xmath19 , @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is defined as @xmath22 , and @xmath23 is the stationary solution of the corresponding master equation .",
    "since the stationary solution is not known , the extensive monte carlo simulations were performed , representative results of which are presented in figures [ fig2a ] and [ fig2b ] .",
    "figure [ fig2a ] shows the density profile typical of low densities @xmath24 , where only the microscopic shocks appear . on the other hand ,",
    "raising @xmath24 above some threshold value @xmath25 induces a macroscopic shock ( i.e. of size @xmath26 ) , as presented in figure [ fig2b ] ( due to the particle - hole symmetry , the same applies for lowering @xmath24 below @xmath27 ) .",
    "so far , this is reminiscent of the behaviour found in the short - range case @xcite , except that @xmath25 appears to depend strongly on @xmath28 .",
    "this fact seems appealing as one may ask whether @xmath25 could reach @xmath29 ( resulting with absence of macroscopic shocks ) by lowering @xmath2 ( as it is the case for a single defect @xcite ) .",
    "one choice of parameters for which this type of change may be observed in monte carlo simulations is presented in figure [ fig3a ] , along with the corresponding histogram , i.e. frequency distribution of densities @xmath19 ( figure [ fig3b ] ) .",
    "this lack of phase coexistence may also be observed in the current - density relation @xmath30 , where the usual plateau is missing ( figure [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , finding @xmath25 for a general choice of parameters @xmath31 , @xmath18 and @xmath28 proves to be an elusive task . even in the short - range case one can only make an estimate , for example , using the so - called fully - segregated model @xcite in which all the defect sites are in a consecutive order forming a large `` bottleneck '' .",
    "this is the approach we pursue in the following section .",
    "( @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 ) obtained by monte carlo simulations ( @xmath35 mcs / site ) for a single disorder realization . for better comparison",
    ", the current has been scaled with the average hopping length @xmath36.,width=283 ]      in the fully - segregated model of tripathy and barma @xcite , all the defects are in a consecutive order forming a large segment ( say @xmath37 ) of size @xmath17 , where the hopping rates are reduced by the factor @xmath31 .",
    "provided this domain is large enough , increasing of density @xmath24 will eventually bring the stationary current @xmath38 to its maximum value for this domain , @xmath39 , which corresponds to density @xmath40 . due to the conservation of current",
    ", @xmath38 has to be matched with the current in the remaining segment ( say @xmath41 )    @xmath42    together with the conservation of particles , @xmath43 , this gives the following ( mean - field ) estimate of @xmath25    @xmath44    later , krug @xcite showed that ( [ rhoc ] ) is actually the upper bound on the exact value of @xmath25 in the disordered model , while the lower bound is given by    @xmath45    note that these two bounds meet in the limit of infinitesimal concentration @xmath46 ( not to be confused with a single defect ! ) giving @xmath47 .",
    "for these results to be applied to the original , fully disordered system , one argues that the largest `` bottleneck '' has diverging length @xmath48 in the limit @xmath49 @xcite , so that the current eventually establishes its asymptotic value @xmath50 . the same is true in the long - range case , except that the current @xmath51 gains an additional factor @xmath52 , @xmath53 .",
    "since this has no effect on ( [ jx = jy ] ) , one expects the same @xmath25 as in ( [ rhoc ] ) .",
    "this means that the absence of a macroscopic shock in figure [ fig3a ] should be a _",
    "finite - size effect _ and should be ruled out in the infinite system .",
    "however , as we shall see later , to observe it in monte carlo simulations would require enormous system sizes @xmath9 ( e.g. @xmath54 , see [ fig5b ] ) .",
    "[ it is worth mentioning that such a slow approach to the thermodynamic limit was found in some other processes in driven diffusive systems @xcite . ] in what follows we therefore adopt the segregated model of tripathy and barma , but with @xmath0 as a free parameter .",
    "i.e. not related to @xmath9 .",
    "the results obtained by increasing @xmath0 at two different values of @xmath28 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 , are presented in figures [ fig5a ] and [ fig5b ] , respectively .",
    "the density profiles are similar to those in the presence of a single defect , where shocks disappear with increasing @xmath31 ( short - range model ) or with decreasing @xmath28 ( long - range model ) .",
    "the main difference is that in the single defect case , the system is able to attain the same value of the maximum current as in the _ pure _ model , which is done by building long - range correlations in the density profile . on the other hand , in the segregated or fully disordered models ,",
    "this is not possible as the largest `` bottleneck '' , whose length diverges with @xmath9 , will force @xmath38 to a value less than in the pure case , provided @xmath0 is large enough . how large @xmath0 is needed to establish",
    "the asymptotic regime is not an easy problem as it depends on the contribution to the current coming from the site - dependent corrections to @xmath57 and @xmath58 ( for example , in figure [ fig5b ] , @xmath59 is still not enough to observe shock ) . instead of calculating these corrections explicitly , in what follows we estimate their leading contribution to the total current as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "let us enumerate lattice sites so that `` bottleneck '' occupies sites @xmath60 . in the long - range model , the current @xmath61 that satisfies local conservation law ,",
    "@xmath62    is defined as the total current of all particles jumping from and over the site @xmath63 ,    @xmath64    where disorder is introduced through @xmath65 equal to @xmath31 or @xmath10 depending on whether a pair of sites @xmath66 contains at least one defect site or not , respectively .",
    "note also that , due to the periodic boundary conditions , @xmath67 , @xmath68 . to calculate the current , we choose the site in the middle of the `` bottleneck '' ( @xmath69 ) and apply the mean - field approximation , @xmath70 . assuming the following density profile    @xmath71    gives four contributions to @xmath38 ( @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 ) coming from the exchange of particles between @xmath41 and @xmath37 segments .",
    "since we are interested only in how fast @xmath38 converges with @xmath0 , we can ignore @xmath76 as they are bounded between @xmath77 and @xmath10 .",
    "it is then straightforward to show that @xmath78    so that contributions ( [ jxy ] ) and ( [ jyy ] ) decay very slowly when @xmath28 is close to @xmath10 .",
    "to conclude , site - wise disorder in one dimension seems too restrictive , even if defects can be bypassed by the long - ranged jumps . as concluded by tripathy and barma",
    ", the reason for this is that disorder in one dimension generates `` bottleneck '' of slow sites that diverges in the limit @xmath49 .",
    "however , such geometric constraint is not to be expected in higher dimensions , which we consider in the rest of this paper .",
    "we consider @xmath79 particles distributed on a two - dimensional ( @xmath80d ) quadratic lattice consisting of @xmath81 sites , where each site holds at most one particle at a time ( @xmath82 ) . at any given moment , a randomly chosen particle attempts to move to the nearest site either in the direction of driving with the probability @xmath83 or in the perpendicular direction with the probability @xmath84 so that @xmath85 .",
    "if the target site is empty , the move is accepted ; otherwise , it is rejected .",
    "in other words , the exclusion process is totally asymmetric in the @xmath86 direction and symmetric in the @xmath87 direction with periodic boundary conditions assumed in both directions . to maximally ease bypassing , disorder is introduced by randomly choosing @xmath88 sites from where hopping in the direction of driving",
    "is forbidden , which could be imagined as if a `` bond '' between the two adjacent sites in @xmath86 direction was broken . in other words ,",
    "a particle at a defect site either moves transverse to the driving with probability @xmath89 ( provided the target site is empty ) or waits with the probability @xmath90 until the next attempt .",
    "two - dimensional exclusion process has been studied previously in various contexts . in @xcite , ramaswamy and barma",
    "have studied a partially asymmetric exclusion process with @xmath91 and @xmath92 , where disorder is introduced by breaking `` bonds '' in both @xmath86 and @xmath87 directions with probability @xmath18 .",
    "the underlying network created in that way is somewhat different from ours , because it creates backbends along which current flows against the driving field .",
    "even closer to our problem is the work of saegusa _ et al _ @xcite , who considered flow of particles in the multi - lane tasep ( @xmath93 ) with fixed obstacles , where the usual plateau in the current - density relation was observed .",
    "alexander and lebowitz @xcite considered the motion of a rod immersed in a fluid of interacting particles described by the symmetric simple exclusion process and observed a macroscopic region of low density behind the rod .",
    "finally , large - scale inhomogeneities in two - dimensional driven diffusive systems , although not induced by disorder but akin to phase coexistence , have been investigated in many works , e.g. by schmittmann _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "our first task is to understand how the presence of disorder affects the stationary current in the @xmath86 direction , which is defined as    @xmath94    where , for a given realization of disorder @xmath95 , @xmath96 if the bond that connects sites at @xmath97 and @xmath98 is present , and @xmath99 otherwise . figure [ fig6 ] shows @xmath30 obtained by monte carlo simulations for various concentrations @xmath18 on @xmath100 lattice with @xmath101 .",
    "compared to the pure case where @xmath102 , we find that , before reaching its maximum , the current can be quite well fitted to the parabolic shape , @xmath103 , but the factor seems nontrivial and decreases with increasing concentration @xmath18 .",
    "more importantly , one observes a plateau around @xmath104 , but its boundaries are less sharp compared to the one - dimensional model .",
    "a naive estimate of height of the plateau can be given by the average number of regular bonds per column times @xmath105 , @xmath106 , which is too high as seen from the third column in table [ tab ] .",
    "this estimate can be improved by looking at the column with the smallest number of regular bonds , which can be either found directly in the particular realization of disorder or calculated using the extreme value theory @xcite . since we could not find any reference in literature to point to this problem explicitly , we present details of this calculation in the appendix and state here only the final result @xmath107\\right\\}\\approx\\nonumber \\\\ & \\approx & l_{\\mathrm{y}}-a_{l_{\\mathrm{x}}}(c , l_{\\mathrm{y}})\\gamma - b_{l_{\\mathrm{x}}}(c , l_{\\mathrm{y}})\\equiv{\\overline{\\omega}}^ { * } , \\label{ab}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]     on @xmath100 lattice with @xmath101 , each obtained by monte carlo simulations ( @xmath108 mcs / site ) for a single disorder realization . dashed lines denote the best estimate of the maximum current given by the expression ( [ jotx_approx]).,width=283 ]    where @xmath109 is euler - mascheroni constant and @xmath110 and @xmath111 are given by the expressions ( [ a ] ) and ( [ b ] ) , respectively , in the appendix .",

    "although the analytical expression ( [ ab ] ) is closer to monte carlo data than @xmath106 , it poorly describes the maximum current overall , especially at higher concentrations @xmath18 . the best estimate , as displayed in the sixth column of table [ tab ] ,",

    "it should be noted that the usefulness of this expression depends on the value of @xmath90 : in the strongly anisotropic limit where @xmath117 , there will be an increasing contribution to the current coming from the particles entering the column at one site and then leaving it from another .",

    "in this work we studied the possibility of avoiding macroscopic phase separation in the exclusion processes with site - wise quenched disorder by allowing particles to bypass defect sites .",
    "bypassing was implemented in a natural way , either by extending the range of hopping or by increasing the dimensionality . in the first example , the performed monte carlo simulations indicated the absence of the macroscopic shock provided the hopping length @xmath0 is taken from the probability distribution obeying the power - law @xmath1 and @xmath28 is close to @xmath10 .",
    "this was a rather surprising result , since the origin of shocks in one dimension is related to the fact that disorder creates a cluster of slow sites whose length diverges in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "however , by studying the entirely segregated model in which all defects are in the consecutive order forming a large `` bottleneck '' , we showed that the absence of shocks is a finite - size effect which decays very slowly with the size @xmath0 of the``bottleneck '' and thus persists for enormously large system sizes , e.g. @xmath190 .    in the second example , we considered the @xmath150 exclusion process , which is totally asymmetric in the longitudinal direction and symmetric in the transverse one , with disorder introduced through obstacles in the driving direction .",

    "if @xmath173 remains finite while @xmath175 , as in the multi - lane tasep with a finite number of lanes , the argument in favour of bottleneck - induced phase separation should be revoked . obviously , the same argument remains valid for more general types of disorder , provided it obstructs flow only in the direction of driving .",

    "first is the upper value of @xmath90 for which the above mapping applies .",
    "second is the mechanism of phase separation for @xmath90 outside this limit and related to that is the finding of threshold density @xmath25 .",
    "last , it would be interesting to examine the case where the bond disorder , whose realization may be found in some microfluidic geometries @xcite , is replaced by the site disorder , appropriate for modelling flow of a fluid through porous media or pedestrians avoiding fixed obstacles .",

    "let @xmath195 be the corresponding cumulative distribution and @xmath196 its right endpoint , @xmath197 .",
    "we are interested in obtaining the maximum value of @xmath198 as @xmath175 ,    @xmath199    where @xmath200 means convergence in probability , since @xmath201 is degenerate in the limit @xmath202 as it converges either to @xmath77 for @xmath203 or to @xmath10 for @xmath204 .",
    "we therefore seek a sequence of positive @xmath205 and real @xmath206 such that @xmath207 exists , where @xmath208 is called the extreme value distribution . a sufficient condition for that",

    "we approximate a binomial distribution with the normal @xmath221 , where @xmath222 and @xmath223 .",
    "numerical error in doing so need not worry us since for cumulative distribution it is of the order of @xmath224 ( berry - essen theorem ) and @xmath173 is large .",

    "the mean and the variance of the gumbel distribution are given by euler - mascheroni constant @xmath109 and @xmath231 , respectively , which gives the mean and the variance of @xmath196    @xmath232    @xmath233    where @xmath234 and @xmath235 are given by    @xmath236 ^ 2\\right\\ } , \\label{a}\\ ] ]    @xmath237    for @xmath238 , @xmath239 can be expanded around @xmath175 , which gives    @xmath240^{1/2},\\ ] ]    @xmath241\\right\\}^{1/2}.\\ ] ]",
