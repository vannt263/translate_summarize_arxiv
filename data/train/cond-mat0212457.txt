    "a standard method to unbind the two strands of a double - stranded dna ( dsdna ) in solution is that of increasing the temperature of the system .",
    "this process , known as dna thermal denaturation or dna melting , has been studied since the sixties as it provides important information about the interaction between base pairs , the stability of the double helix , the effect of the solvent and of the salt concentration ( for a review see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    several techniques are currently available for the investigation of dna thermal denaturation such as uv absorption , differential scanning calorimetry , circular dichroism , nmr , fluorescence emission and temperature gradient gel electrophoresis @xcite . perhaps the most established of these",
    "is the uv absorption method which consists in irradiating the sample with uv light at @xmath3 nm , a wavelength which is preferentially absorbed by single stranded dna ( ssdna ) .",
    "the total fraction of absorbed light , @xmath4 , is therefore simply proportional to the fraction of dissociated base pairs of the sequence and provides a direct measurement of the order parameter of the problem . in experimental studies , rather than analyzing directly @xmath4 , it is customary to consider its temperature derivative : the plot of @xmath5 vs. @xmath6 is known as the differential melting curve @xcite , but we will simply refer to it , in the rest of the paper , as the melting curve .",
    "melting curves can show a single or several peaks ( typical examples , as observed in experiments , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] ) whose positions and heights depend on the sequence length and composition as well as on external parameters as the salt concentration . for very short sequences ,",
    "i.e. of about @xmath7 base pairs ( bps ) , the melting curve shows a single peak indicating a sudden unbinding of the two strands ( see fig . [ fig01](a ) ) .",
    "the peak is rounded by finite size effects and thus can become quite broad for very short chains .",
    "somewhat longer sequences ( @xmath8 bps ) are instead characterized by several peaks of typical width of about @xmath9 or less ( fig . [",
    "fig01](b ) ) .",
    "these peaks are the signatures of sharp transitions of cooperatively melting regions , as for instance inner loop openings or the unbinding of double stranded regions at the edges of the chain .",
    "finally , in very long chains ( @xmath10 bps ) there is again only a single broad peak covering about @xmath11 , which is actually the superposition of many distinct peaks associated with the denaturation of single domains [ fig . [ fig01](c ) ] .",
    "these single peaks can not be resolved anymore for such long sequences and the melting curve becomes again rather featureless .",
    "the computational prediction of dna melting curves is a basic bioinformatics task which is needed for a large variety of applications such as primer design , dna control during polymerase chain reaction or mutation analysis @xcite .",
    "also the denaturation behavior of dna sequences of genomic size is of interest for studies of sequence complexity and evolution and for gene identification and mutation @xcite .",
    "consequently , specialized tools , such as meltsim @xcite , were developed for this purpose .",

    ", height=162 ]    the first attempts to model the dna denaturation dates back from the sixties ( for a recent review see ref .",
    "the simplest model employed for this purpose was the one - dimensional ising model where the two spin states @xmath14 represent the open ( @xmath15 ) or closed ( @xmath16 ) configuration for complementary base pairs @xcite .",
    "this model obviously does not provide a real thermodynamical phase transition but only a smooth crossover between the closed ( dsdna ) and open ( ssdna ) regimes .",
    "the inclusion of an entropic term , which takes into account the number of possible configurations of the denaturated loops , induces an effective long range interaction in the system and thus a genuine phase transition may occur , as shown long ago by poland and sheraga @xcite .    on rather short dna sequences ( @xmath17 bps )",
    "the loop entropy contribution is not very important as loops are rare and rather short and the dna denaturates mainly trough unbinding from the edges .",
    "a description based on the 1d ising model with appropriate experimentally determined energy parameters is therefore sufficient ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . a calculation aimed at reproducing experimental melting curves with several peaks of different heights and widths [ as that shown in fig . [ fig01](b ) ] however needs , besides accurate energy parameters , also a good estimate of the entropy of the denaturated loops .",
    "a broadly known method to calculate dna melting curves for a given input sequence is the poland algorithm @xcite in which the probability for each base pair to be in an open or closed state can be calculated from a set of recursive relations .",
    "the entropy of the denaturated loops is given by counting the number of configurations for a closed self - avoiding walk @xcite .",
    "this approach overestimates the actual entropy as it does not take into account that the number of configurations available to the loop is limited by the presence of the rest of the chain .",
    "recent advances in the statistical mechanics of polymers provided new insight on how to calculate entropies for loops which are embedded in chains @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to discuss whether dna thermal denaturation experiments are able to fix unequivocally the form of the parameters involved in the entropy of denaturated loops .",
    "we analyze the effect of the improved loop entropy estimate on the melting curves for dna sequences of various lengths ( up to @xmath18 base pairs ) and compositions .",
    "we show that the modification of the entropic parameters associated with the loops may have quite a strong effect on the melting curves , especially for sequences of intermediate lengths where several peaks are present [ as in the example of fig .",

    "[ fig02](a ) ) , which in the limit @xmath20 assumes the following form @xcite : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a nonuniversal geometric factor , while @xmath0 , the so called loop closure exponent , is a universal quantity . in eq .",

    "( [ loop_entropy ] ) is still valid , however with a higher value for the exponent @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the reason for the higher value of @xmath0 is the lower number of configurations available for the loop due to the presence of the rest of the chain , compared to the number of configurations available for an isolated loop .",
    "monte carlo simulations on suitable three dimensional lattice models yield @xmath26 @xcite , a value which is also in agreement with analytical estimates , which place this exponent in the range @xmath28 @xcite .",

    "it is clear that accepting @xmath30 as the most appropriate estimate of the loop exponent entering in the partition function ( [ loop_entropy ] ) implies that the existing estimate of the cooperativity parameter @xmath23 has to be revisited as its experimental determinations relied on the choice @xmath31 .",

    "we analyze the melting curves for dna sequences of a wide range of lengths up to the full genome of the e. coli which amounts to @xmath18 bps .",

    "for such a combination of parameters the melting peaks @xmath67 and @xmath78 are shifted from their positions , while peak @xmath68 vanishes in the signal background .",

    "the reason for this is that , as shown from the study of the denaturation maps , the peak @xmath73 corresponds to the opening of a long loop of about @xmath81 bps , thus any modification of the parameters entering in the loop entropy will have a particularly strong effect on it .",

    "the most relevant difference between the melting curves calculated for different values of @xmath0 and @xmath23 is within the region around @xmath84 , where a melting peak doubles its height going from the original choice of @xmath31 to @xmath30 , while keeping the cooperativity parameter fixed at @xmath27 . as in the eif-4 g sequence ,",
    "when @xmath23 is rescaled by a factor @xmath1 we obtain a melting curve running extremely close to the original one in the whole range of temperatures .",
    "it is interesting to take a closer look at the average configurations around the peak at @xmath85 .",

    "[ lamc1](b ) shows a blow up of the denaturation maps @xmath71 and @xmath74 in a region around base pairs @xmath86 , where a loop opening occurs .",
    "while keeping @xmath30 we plot in the inset the maps both for @xmath27 ( thin lines ) and @xmath87 ( thick lines ) .",
    "it is remarkable how little thick and thin lines differ , compared to the big effect of a change of @xmath23 in the differential melting curves of fig .",
    "[ lamc1](a ) .",
    "the `` robustness '' of the denaturation maps with respect to a change of the thermodynamic parameters has also been observed recently by yeramian @xcite .",
    "the curves in the inset clearly demonstrate the increase of cooperativity when @xmath23 is decreased : either loops are suppressed ( case @xmath71 ) or two neighboring loops tend to merge ( case @xmath74 ) in order to minimize the effect of a small value of @xmath23 .",
    "although the peak at @xmath88 c corresponds to the formation of a loop of about @xmath89 bps , as can be seen from the denaturation maps @xmath75 and @xmath90 , a change in the loop parameters @xmath0 and @xmath23 does not seem to modify much this peak , as the transition considered is not an opening of a double helical segment , but rather a merging of two loops with a corresponding enlargement .",
    "we conclude that loops merging transitions are less affected by a change in @xmath0 and @xmath23 as compared to a genuine loop opening .",
    "we notice also that changing the loop parameters do not affect at all the small peak at @xmath91 , because this corresponds to a transition not involving inner loops , but rather the melting of the region @xmath92 through opening from the edges ( see @xmath72 in fig .",

    "longer sequences have the advantage that they develop loops of a broad range of length scales , thus one may test the influence in a change of loop parameters simultaneously for very short and very long loops .",
    "unfortunately a limiting factor in this case is that , as pointed out in the introduction , the melting curves are rather featureless ( as for fig . [ fig01](c ) ) .",
    "figure [ ecoli_fig ] show the calculated melting curves for the full dna of e. coli which is of about @xmath94 bps with a known sequence ( taken from @xcite ) .",
    "the curves are almost continuous , although some irregular structure is still visible , indicating that the discrete sharp peaks of the underlying sequence have not been completely averaged out .",

    "again we find that by changing the loop closure exponent from @xmath31 to @xmath30 while rescaling of @xmath23 by one order of magnitude brings the curve back to the original one .",
    "the two curves obtained in this way are perfectly overlapping . a change of @xmath0 only , while leaving @xmath97 makes the melting curve somewhat sharper as observed previously for shorter sequences",

    ". these differences could be due to some non - equilibrium effects , which are known to be more severe for very long sequences @xcite .",
    "there has been some discussion recently about the influence of the stiffness of the double helix on the exponent @xmath0 @xcite . in the very ideal limit of a loop attached to two infinitely rigid rods ,",
    "the appropriate value of the loop exponent is the same of that of an isolated loop @xmath31 , as the loop does not interact with the rest of the chain .",
    "the dsdna has a persistence length which is typically much larger than that of the ssdna ( @xmath102 ) , therefore it is legitimate to question the applicability of the polymer network theory @xcite , from which a higher loop exponent @xmath103 was derived @xcite , to real dna sequences .",
    "a different persistence length between dsdna and ssdna was incorporated in lattice monte carlo simulations @xcite . in these calculations the exponent @xmath0 , estimated from an analysis of the distributions of the loop lengths using realistic values for @xmath104 and @xmath105 , was found to be consistent with that of the case in which the difference between persistence lengths is neglected .",
    "however these lattice models did not incorporate a cooperativity parameter .    in ref .",
    "@xcite it was estimated that sequences up to @xmath106 bps are still too short to show any interaction effects between a loop with the rest of the chain , so that the appropriate value of the loop exponent should be that of an isolated loop @xmath25 .",
    "there is however still disagreement about this conclusion @xcite .",
    "here we would like to point out some effects which have been overlooked in the present literature .",
    "the main interest in the exponent @xmath0 is that of modeling the dna melting curves and the melting process typically takes place at around @xmath107 c ( see figs .",
    "[ eifg4 ] , [ lamc1 ] and [ ecoli_fig ] ) .",
    "therefore , in order to discuss the applicability of the higher loop exponent @xmath108 to real dna sequence , it is the difference in persistence length of dsdna and ssdna in this range of temperatures which should be investigated . at room temperatures the persistence lengths are @xmath109  , while @xmath110  corresponding to roughly @xmath111 bps and @xmath112 bps , respectively @xcite .",
    "both conformational fluctuations and electrostatic interactions contribute to the persistence length of dsdna in solution @xcite . in the limit of high salt concentrations",
    "electrostatic interactions are totally screened and the persistence length is expected to scale as function of the temperature as in the classical wormlike chain model @xcite , i.e. @xmath113 , with @xmath114 temperature independent . this formula implies a reduction of about @xmath115 of the dsdna persistence length in the melting region compared to the room temperature value . however the assumption that the electrostatic interactions are totally screened may not be fully justified for the range of salt concentrations used here ( @xmath116=0.1$]m or lower ) .",
    "thus the @xmath115 should be rather considered as an upper bound .    a more relevant effect for the reduction of the dsdna persistence length is the proliferation of small denaturated bubbles within a dsdna segment .",
    "within the model considered here the characteristic lengths close to melting , as the loop and double helix segment lengths , scale as @xmath117 . as pointed out before , a large cooperativity ( small @xmath23 ) , would imply typically long loops and long double helical segments .",
    "however , the conclusion that short ( i.e. @xmath118 bps ) loops would be totaly suppressed due to the small @xmath23 , is too simplistic .",
    "several studies showed that the nearest neighbor model largely underestimates the opening probability for small loops ( see the discussion in @xcite and references therein ) , so it can not be a quantitatively reliable tool at too short length scales .",

    "this study was performed on short sequences ( of about @xmath122 bps ) containing an internal at region surrounded on both sides by short cg clamps .",
    "experiments show that the inner at region melts at temperatures in which the cg edges are still bound @xcite .    in fig .",

    "[ bonnet_fig](a ) ) the typical value for the cooperativity parameter used previously in the paper , our calculations show that @xmath125 and @xmath126 are at all temperatures very close to each other , which implies that no loops are formed and that the sequence rather melts from edge openings , although the cg edges are energetically more stable than the inner at region .",

    "we have plotted in fig .",

    "the reduced cooperativity allows for the formation of loops and now produces results closer to what is observed in experiments ( see fig . 2 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) . thus , despite that the small cooperativity parameter ( @xmath128 ) correctly describes long loop ( @xmath129 bps ) formations in dna melting , small loops ( @xmath130 bps ) openings in at - rich domains are still possible .",
    "the importance of small bubbles formation in dna oligomers melting has been recently emphasized in an analysis of the melting of dna oligomers @xcite .    as the ssdna has , at @xmath131 c , an estimated persistence length corresponding to roughly @xmath132 bps",
    ", we expect that the opening of a small loop of about @xmath133 bps would be sufficient to decorrelate completely the two dsdna segments at its two sides . to provide an estimate of the persistence length of the dsdna one would need to know the average density of small loops and their probabilities , which depends on the sequence composition .",
    "it is however conceivable that this effect would make the dsdna at @xmath134c much more flexible , compared to its room temperature behavior , so that the use of the loop embedded exponent for @xmath0 is justified .",
    "in this paper we have analyzed the effect of reparametrizing the loop weight contribution , in the calculation of dna melting curves for sequences of a broad range of lengths , up to the full genome of the e - coli ( @xmath135 bps ) . using the closure exponent for a loop embedded in a chain ( @xmath136 ) we found that in order to reproduce correctly the existing experimental data and melting curves one needs to increase the cooperativity parameter @xmath23 by about one order of magnitude .",
    "an increase of the cooperativity parameter , which is the weight associated with the interruption of an helix to form a loop , implies that loops are more probable within the chain .",
    "it is clear that a simultaneous change of the loop exponent @xmath0 and of @xmath23 can not reproduce two perfectly overlapping melting curves .",
    "we found that rescaling @xmath23 by about one order of magnitude together with a change in @xmath0 from @xmath49 to @xmath50 produces typically very small shifts in peak positions ( @xmath137 ) and heights .",
    "accurate melting experiments would be able to distinguish between the two choices and fix unequivocally both @xmath0 and @xmath23 .",
    "in any case our analysis indicates that the best samples where to test the above effects are sequences of intermediate lengths ( @xmath8 bps ) .",
    "we showed that in these sequences rather large loops may be formed and that the associated melting peaks are extremely sensitive to a change in loop parameters @xmath0 and @xmath23 .",
    "the disadvantage of shorter sequences is that they predominantly melt through end openings ( unless they are designed to do otherwise , as in the example of the preceding section ) .",
    "the melting curves of very long sequences , as we showed for e. coli , are only weakly affected by a change in the parameters @xmath0 and @xmath23",
