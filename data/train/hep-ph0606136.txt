    "photon scattering has the advantage of not being limited by the low scattering cross section , @xmath2 @xcite , in the optical range .",
    "the idea of qed four  wave mixing was first studied by @xcite . further theoretical @xcite and experimental @xcite studies",

    "we show that any two  dimensional ( 2d ) setup is unlikely to produce a signal distinguishable from noise , for presently available power levels .",

    "due to a non  perfect vacuum in the interaction chamber , competing scattering processes such as compton scattering and in principle collective plasma four  wave mixing will be present .",
    "an analysis , with the help of computer simulations , has been carried out in order to give a rough estimate of the signal to noise ratio .",
    "it is found that plasma cavitation caused by the strong laser pulses suppress the competing effects rather effectively close to the interaction region ( see e.g. ref .",

    "next we consider three plane waves , representing the incoming laser pulses , with amplitudes allowed to have a weak space time dependence due to interactions , @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 . due to the cubic non  linearity of ( [ eq : polarization ] ) and ( [ eq : magnetization ] ) , we expect generation of a fourth wave with @xmath27 if the incoming wave vectors satisfy the matching conditions @xmath28 and @xmath29 for some @xmath30 and @xmath31 . in practice the interaction pulses will have a finite spectral width , @xmath32 and equations ( [ eq : wavevector ] ) and ( [ eq : frequency ] ) refers to the central peaks of the spectra .",
    "however , we assume that the spectral width is small ( @xmath33 ) , such that it can be incorporated into slowly varying amplitudes , @xmath34 and the derivatives can be taken to act only on the harmonic parts .",
    "the effect of a finite spectral width is to give a finite interaction time .",

    "the highest power laser systems operates at a rather well  defined frequency , and by using frequency  doubling crystals we also have access to second harmonics , although with some power loss . as will be argued below",
    ", these restrictions in incoming frequencies make a 2d setup less competitive than a 3d setup .",
    "the 3d configuration achievable from a single laser through frequency doubling which is best suited for an experiment ( allowed by the matching conditions ( [ eq : wavevector ] ) and ( [ eq : frequency ] ) ) is given by the wavevectors @xmath45 and is illustrated in fig .",

    "the main advantages of using a configuration defined by ( [ eq : specific - wavevectors ] ) are that the wavelength and the direction of the generated wave are well separated from that of the incoming laser beams .",
    "this is highly desirable since optical components will always scatter and reflect some light , making it difficult to distinguish qed scattered photons of wavelengths close to that of the incoming laser beams .",
    "furthermore , the geometry of the setup is not hindered by the fact that the focused laser beams in reality are cone  shaped .",
    "also , the polarizations can be chosen arbitrary since it is not necessary to prevent any counter propagating laser beam from entering back into the laser .    in order to calculate the geometric factor @xmath40 we define @xmath46 as the angle between the _ z_axis and the polarization vector of the @xmath47field , in such way that it is positive in clockwise direction when looking in the @xmath48direction .",
    "@xmath49 is defined in the same manner but with respect to the _ x_axis . in the case of configurations confined to a plane ,",
    "the wave vectors are given by @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the angle from the _",

    "note that the 2d case describes the general four  wave process in the center  of  mass frame of two incoming photons , with wave vectors @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "thus , the general 3d geometric factor @xmath40 can be found from the 2d one by applying lorentz transformations .",
    "the number of scattered photons can be estimated from modeling the laser pulses as rectangular prisms with length @xmath54 and quadratic cross section @xmath55 , inside which the field amplitudes are constant . although not a completely accurate model of the pulse shape , it has the advantage of making the calculations transparent , and it will give a reasonable estimate of the number of generated photons .    in the 3d case",

    "@xmath74 corresponds to roughly half the angular width of the central interference peak of the generated intensity .",
    "the scaling of the number of generated photons with respect to @xmath60 is decoupled from the pulse model .",
    "hence it is possible to test the theoretical predictions by varying the polarizations of the incoming pulses .",
    "however , changing the linear polarization of one of the laser beams could create a false periodic signal , as the polarization affects the propagation direction of the competing compton scattered photons .",
    "a low noise contribution is therefore a necessity .",

    "a lagrangian of this form affects the geometric factor , and thus the polarization dependence of the signal as described in appendix a. any detected signal that can be fit to follow the polarization dependence of the geometric factors for some @xmath81 and @xmath82 is thus consistent with lorentz invariance .",

    "[ fig : nr - of - photons ] and table [ tab : nr - of - photons ] shows how the scattering number increases with increasing laser power , when the focused beam width is kept constant .",
    "we note that in order to get a statistically sufficient number of scattered photons , the conditions must be reproduced from shot to shot .",
    "the astra gemini system is designed to operate in saturation , so energy fluctuations are likely to be less than 5% on a shot to shot basis . as for the pulse length",
    ", it primarily derives from static and fixed effects and fluctuations are expected to be less than 5% , giving a maximum total fluctuation in power of about 10% .",
    "the most important effect is that of spot and pointing stability . through the use of adaptive optics , there will be active control of the spot size , shape and to some limited extent position . controlling the relative pointing of the three beams",

    "vibration could pose a problem , but the experiment should be designed in such a way that any given mode of vibration produces a similar far field displacement , i.e. all beams move in the same direction vertically or horizontally against a stimulus . furthermore , the astra gemini system has been designed on very thick concrete slabs so vibration after this split is likely to be a minimum problem .",

    "the interaction region will then take the shape of a rectangular prism of width @xmath56 and , with respect to the retarded time , length @xmath96 , and exist for some time interval @xmath57 .",
    "since the pulse length often greatly exceeds the pulse width , this configuration gives an optimal interaction region and also generates the most scattered photons , @xmath97 , for an optimal choice of polarization angles ( @xmath98 and @xmath76 ) .",
    "however , the scattered photons are emitted along the beam axis and have the same wavelength as that of the incoming beams , making detection impossible in practice .",
    "the directions of the incoming and scattered waves can in principle be separated if their frequencies are shifted .",
    "the large cone angle of the laser beams and the need of having a well separated scattered frequency however requires a large deviation from the original configuration , thus destroying its nice features and consequently bringing down the scattering number .",
    "this also requires a greater change in frequency of the incoming beams , which may cause a problem with finding suitable lasers .",
    "there is , however , a possible 2d configuration where only the fundamental frequency and its second harmonic is used , with the wavevectors @xmath99 as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : alternative ] .",
    "the geometric factor for this configuration becomes approximately @xmath100 , for an optimal choice of polarizations angles ( @xmath101 ) .",
    "although this looks superior to the 3d setup , there are some practical problems . to extract the qed photons in this 2d setup , a beam splitter needs to be introduced in the path of @xmath102 , before the interaction region , bringing down the scattering number with a factor 0.25 .",
    "also , the interaction region in this case becomes somewhat smaller than a cubic one , further reducing the scattering number .",
    "consequently , the estimated detectable signal will be of the same order as that of the 3d setup .",
    "the polarization dependence of the signal with this configuration is , however , much more pronounced than for the 3d one and it nearly vanishes at minimum .",
    "this setup could be an alternative to the 3d configuration presented above , but a major remaining problem is to ensure that none of the higher harmonic photons of the fundamental laser beam is reflected by optics back to the detector , drowning the signal in noise .",
    "there are other possible experimental configurations , both 2d and 3d , that we have not investigated in this paper .",
    "it is , for instance , possible to use third harmonics or higher , to construct setups with the scattering direction distinct from the incoming photon directions .",
    "however , this requires additional frequency doubling crystals reducing the power , and we expect these configurations to be less competitive . it is also possible to use configurations consisting of two or more lasers of different frequencies to generate qed scattered photons with wavelengths well separated from the harmonics of the incident beams , as used in the 3d configuration in ref .  @xcite . since present laser systems have sufficient power only at single frequencies ( with harmonics available using frequency  doubling crystals ) we expect these configurations to be less competitive .",
    "hence , the 3d configuration , where just the second harmonic is needed and the scattering direction is distinct from the directions of the incoming photons , seems to be the optimal setup from an experimental point of view .",
    "since a perfect vacuum in the interaction chamber is in practice impossible to achieve , there will be competing scattering processes present .",
    "the effect of these processes will rather effectively be suppressed due to plasma cavitation caused by the strong laser pulses .",
    "below , with the help of computer simulations , we give a rough estimate of the magnitude of the competing scattering events resulting from compton scattering and collective plasma four  wave mixing .",
    "this is in order to determine whether it is theoretically possible to distinguish the qed scattered photons from noise .      to investigate the effect of the ponderomotive force near the focal spot , we have given the laser pulse a gaussian shape . with the beam parameters given for the astra gemini system ,",
    "simulations show that an electron exposed to such a laser pulse near the interaction region will be forced out of the central beam already during the initial part of the pulse .",

    "we now have the tools to make a rough estimate of the number of compton scattered photons .",
    "if the electrons were distributed homogeneously within a pulse of @xmath141 photons , the number of scattered photons during a time @xmath135 would be @xmath142 .",
    "however , because of the ponderomotive force , most of the photons will not be exposed to any electrons in the region near the focal point , where the intensity is the greatest .",
    "we thus introduce a parameter @xmath80 , which is the fraction of photons that do experience electrons . with a maximum intensity of @xmath84 in the interaction region",
    ", we find from fig .",
    "[ fig : intensity ] and [ fig : radialdisplacement ] that the effect of the ponderomotive force is crucial .",
    "we estimate that more than @xmath143 of the beam photons do not encounter any electrons , and we reduce the scattering rate correspondingly , i.e. @xmath144 .",
    "only a fraction of the scattered photons will have energies possible to confuse with qed scattered photons , and within that energy range we introduce the subscript @xmath145 on the cross section @xmath146 . noting that due to plasma cavitation , the intensity felt by the electrons is significantly less than the peak intensity",
    ", we find from fig .",
    "[ fig : radialdisplacement ] the average cross section @xmath147 . from fig .",
    "[ fig : intensity ] and [ fig : radialdisplacement ] we find that the effect of the ponderomotive force is much more crusial for the @xmath103 pulse than for the @xmath104 one .",
    "furthermore , the average cross section @xmath114 is smaller for the @xmath103 photons ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : compton ] ) . guided by this",
    ", we neglect the scattering from the @xmath103 beam compared to that from the two @xmath104 beams .",
    "the number of photons in one beam then becomes about @xmath148 ( 40% of 7.5 j at 400 nm ) .    of the scattered photons ,",
    "only a fraction , @xmath149 , will be scattered into the detector .",
    "electrons accelerated by the laser pulse will oscillate relativisticly in the plane spanned by the polarization vector and the wave vector .",
    "because of the relativistic beaming effect , the compton scattered photons will be confined close to this plane . if we assume that the detector sees all photons from the qed scattered wave within a cone angle of 30 degrees",
    ", this would yield @xmath150 if all photons were scattered isotropically .",
    "however , when considering that electrons are highly relativistic near the interaction region and taking into account the relativistic beaming effect , we estimate @xmath151 .",
    "the expression for the number of compton scattered photons per beam reaching the detector is then @xmath152    we assume that the interaction region is imaged onto the detector in such a way that the detector only sees a part of the interaction region about @xmath153 in diameter .",
    "this gives us an interaction time of about @xmath154 , during which competing compton photons can be scattered into the detector .",
    "we further assume an unperturbed vacuum around @xmath140 torr , giving @xmath155 .",
    "the number of compton scattered photons that the detector might confuse with qed scattered photons , from both of the @xmath104 beams , is then about @xmath156 , about three orders of magnitude lower than the expected number of qed scattered photons . here",
    "the contribution of higher order compton scattering has not been included .",
    "even if the non  linear contribution to the noise exceeds the linear one with an order of magnitude , it is still well below the qed signal .",
    "should the noise level in a real experiment still prove to be too severe , it can be further reduced by ionizing the interaction region with a strong laser pulse and extract the electrons with a static electric field shortly before performing the qed experiment .",
    "in this paper , we have investigated the possibility to detect qed elastic photon ",
    "photon scattering through four  wave mixing . in the suggested 3d experimental setup ,",
    "three colliding laser pulses stimulate emission of a fourth electromagnetic wave with a new frequency and a new direction of propagation . considering that present day",
    "petawatt laser systems only operate at a single frequency ( with harmonics available through frequency doubling crystals ) , it has been shown that a 3d configuration will be able to produce a measurable signal for the astra gemini system and similar high power systems . moreover , by changing the polarization of one of the incoming beams , a unique fingerprint characterizing elastic photon ",
    "photon scattering can be obtained . for given data of the laser beams , together with the coupling coefficients , an estimated number of scattered photons was obtained . with the parameters chosen to fit the astra gemini system at the central laser facility ( rutherford appleton laboratory ) , the estimated number of scattered photons per shot was @xmath157 .",
    "two main obstacles for successful detection were identified , the shot  to  shot reproducibility and the noise from competing scattering events . we have argued that pulse energy fluctuations will be low , and that vibrations are likely to be a small problem due to the inherent structure of the astra gemini system .",
    "means of further improvements to reduce vibrations have also been suggested . due to a non  perfect vacuum in the interaction chamber , there will be competing scattering processes such as compton scattering and collective plasma four  wave mixing present . through the use of computer simulations",
    ", it was found that the competing effects are suppressed rather effectively due to plasma cavitation caused by the strong laser pulses . with the use of ultra ",
    "high vacuum technology , it was found that the noise from competing scattering processes would roughly be about three orders of magnitude lower than the qed signal .",
    "means of further reducing the noise has also been suggested .",
    "we conclude that detection of elastic photon ",
    "photon scattering will in principle be possible with the astra gemini system operational in 2007 .",
