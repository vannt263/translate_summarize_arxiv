    "the luminous infrared galaxies ( ligs ) are a class of objects characterized by high infrared luminosities ( l@xmath2 erg s@xmath3 ) .",
    "both agns and starbursts can power ligs , but the relative contribution of these two energy sources to the bolometric luminosity is still unclear .",
    "x - ray observations in the hard ( 2 - 10 kev ) band can be a powerful tool to unveil the agn emission in the ligs and to estimate its contribution to the total luminosity .",
    "it is at present impossible to analyze a representative ligs sample in the 2 - 10 kev band , because the hard x - ray observations performed up to now are strongly biased in favor of agn  dominated sources . nevertheless , a significant number of ir - selected ligs with x - ray observations is now available both in the literature and in public archives , and therefore a comparison between the x - ray properties of agn  dominated and ir  selected ligs is possible .",
    "we collected the data of all the luminous infrared galaxies observed so far in hard x - rays and studied their x - ray emission and the correlation between their x - ray and infrared properties .",
    "the x - ray properties of our sample of objects are very heterogeneous both in terms of brightness and spectral shape .",
    "most of the objects optically classified as type 1 sys or qsos are characterized by bright x - ray emission ( relative to the ir luminosity ) and their x - ray spectrum does not show indications for significant cold absorption .",
    "a significant fraction of the narrow line agns are also relatively bright in the x - rays and their spectrum is characterized by a photoleletric cutoff ascribed to compton thin absorbing gas ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "the remaining objects optically classified as agns are very weak in the x - rays .",
    "this can be due to the intrinsic weakness of the agn component or to an absorbing column density higher than @xmath5@xmath6 ( compton thick agns ) . finally , a few objects are optically classified as starbursts and are all very weak in the x rays . in fig .",
    "1 we plot the x / ir flux ratio versus the infrared colour defined as c@xmath7 , where f@xmath8 and f@xmath9 are the flux densities at 25 @xmath10 m and at 60@xmath10 m .",
    "a clear correlation is apparent in fig . 1 : type 1 agns are preferentially in the high x / ir ratio and warm infrared colour part of the diagram . moving towards lower 25/60@xmath10 m ratios we find lower x / ir ratios and an increasing fraction of obscured agns at first , and of starbursts afterwards .    a simple model in agreement with this correlation",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "2 : starting from a `` pure seyfert 1 '' point , at the top -right corner in the plot , the oblique rightmost ( light ) line gives the expected location of agn  dominated objects , with an increasing x - ray absorbing column density moving towards the bottom .",
    "the dotted ( dark ) curves give different degrees of mixing of starburst and agn , with the agn contribution lowering moving to the left .    in this model the absorption suffered by the ir radiation is only a small fraction of that inferred from the x - ray column density by assuming a standard dust  to  gas ratio .",
    "indeed , we find that there is no way to explain the correlation if we assume that ( 1 ) the same amount of material obscures both the x - rays and the infrared and that ( 2 ) the dust  to  gas ratio is galactic .",
    "this is because if none out of the two hypothesis above are relaxed , the absorbed model gives a pure  agn curve that is almost horizontal , because the ir colour decreases too fast with respect to the x / ir flux ratio . a simple explanation for the difference between the absorption in the ir and in the x - rays can be the following : if the density in the circumnuclear torus decreases radially , the x  rays , emitted in the very central region , are much more absorbed than the 25@xmath10 m radiation , emitted by the warm dust located along the inner face of the torus , far from the plane of the accretion disk .",
    "besides the optical classification , the simple picture depicted above is supported by additional pieces of evidence : 1 ) broad lines in the polarized spectrum or in the near ir are found only in type 2 objects with warm ir colour , that , according to our model , are the agn - dominated ligs ; 2 ) the large majority of the ir - cold sources have steep ( starburst - like ) x - ray indices while ir - warm sources have flatter ( agn - like ) indices . for a more detailed discussion about these issues , we remind to a forthcoming paper @xcite .",
    "our sample includes a subsample of 13 sources optically classified as type 2 agns and observed by bepposax up to 200 kev .",
    "6 out of the 11 sources that are compton  thick in the 2 - 10 kev range are completely absorbed also in the 10 to 200 kev band , therefore implying a column density n@xmath11 @xmath6 .",
    "only two of the 11 compton thick sources have an excess in the 15 - 100 kev range , while for the remaining three the hard 15 - 100 kev x - ray emission is unconstrained .",
    "the shortage of objects with 10@xmath12@xmath13n@xmath14 @xmath6 already pointed out in a sample of optically selected seyfert 2s @xcite , would have important consequences in the synthesis models of the x - ray background , since this class of sy2 should contribute significantly to the xrb in the 10 kev to 200 kev band , where most of the xrb energy is emitted .",
    "these models are by and large successful in synthesizing the xrb from the contributions of individual agns ; they must however include a dominant contribution from absorbed , type 2 agns , which up to now have been observed only at low redshifts and low luminosities . assuming that type 1 and type 2 agns evolve in the same way ( as predicted by unified models ) , the zero - th order extrapolation has to face several discrepancies , and could be cured only by adding extra type 2 sources at intermediate or high redshifts @xcite .",
    "it has been proposed that ligs could be the required additional sources , thanks to their high luminosity and high spatial density .",
    "however , our work indicates that even those sources in which the presence of a luminous agn is strongly supported by several optical and ir indicators , are on average very dim in the hard x - rays up to 100 kev , because of heavy obscuration .",
    "therefore , the contribution of this class of sources to the xrb is negligible .",
    "much of this work has been don in collaboration with r. gilli , r. maiolino and m. salvati .",
