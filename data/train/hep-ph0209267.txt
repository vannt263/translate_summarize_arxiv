    "calculations of neutrino diffusion in the proto - neutron star show that neutrinos emitted as @xmath2 and @xmath3 types have higher average energies , @xmath4 , than those emitted as electron or anti - electron types , which have @xmath5 and @xmath6 respectively .",
    "the energy distributions can be fit to fermi - dirac spectra , although some calculations show that they differ from fermi - dirac form on their tails @xcite . this has been discussed extensively in @xcite .",
    "the interesting supernova physics conveyed by neutrinos lies in the details of the energy distributions , acquired as the neutrinos are emitted from the supernova core .",
    "neutrino oscillations will mix the spectra in the outer envelope of the supernova .",
    "recent data from the sudbury neutrino observatory ( sno ) and superkamiokande ( superk ) have demonstrated that neutrinos oscillate , implying that they have mass .",
    "superk indicates that atmospheric @xmath2 neutrinos oscillate into objects that are not electron neutrinos , with @xmath7 and a mixing angle of @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "although it has long been known that the flux of electron neutrinos from the sun is smaller than expected , sno has very recently used its sensitivity to neutral - current scattering to measure the total flux from all species of neutrinos .",
    "the flux is approximately the same as predicted by the standard solar model @xcite , confirming that the electron neutrinos are oscillating into some combination of @xmath2 and @xmath3 neutrinos @xcite .",
    "the signal favors the large - mixing - angle ( lma ) solution to the solar - neutrino problem , corresponding to mixing parameters @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the lma will be tested by the reactor experiment kamland @xcite .",
    "if all these results are cast in the form of 3-neutrino mixing , then there is still an unknown mixing angle , which is currently limited by reactor neutrino data to be + @xmath11 @xcite . the lsnd experiment @xcite complicates the picture , requiring a singlet neutrino or cpt violation in the neutrino sector @xcite .",
    "the oscillation parameters inferred from the solar and atmospheric results imply that neutrinos will change flavor in the outer envelope of a supernova .",

    "several existing facilities can detect supernova neutrinos .",
    "if a supernova exploded 10 kpc from the earth with a luminosity of @xmath13 ergs and the energy partitioned equally among neutrino flavors , superk would see about 8300 events from @xmath14 in its water detector @xcite .",
    "kamland would see about 330 events from the same reaction in its scintillator , and sno would see about 360 such events in its light water component @xcite .",
    "kamland may be able to measure the spectrum of the high - temperature neutrinos through neutral - current neutrino - proton elastic scattering @xcite .",
    "sno would also be able to see 80 events from @xmath15 charged - current break - up of the deuteron .",
    "this number would increase in the presence of oscillations .",
    "an additional 500 events in sno would come from the neutral - current break - up of the deuteron @xcite , which has a low threshold .",

    "an analysis of neutrino mass limits from supernova time of flight is done in ref . @xcite .",
    "here we consider a detector based on , e.g.  lead perchlorate ( @xmath16 ) , first proposed by elliott @xcite .",
    "lead had been considered previously as a supernova detector by several groups , e.g.omnis @xcite and land @xcite .",
    "lead has an attractively large neutrino - scattering cross section per nucleon compared with other elements , and",
    "most of the scattering events produce neutrons @xcite . lead perchlorate , which would be sensitive mainly to the higher - energy neutrinos , has the appealing ability to measure energy deposited by the electrons produced in charged - current reactions in coincidence with zero , one , two , or more neutrons , as well as to measure the number of neutrons emitted ( in isolation ) in neutral current reactions . per kt of lead perchlorate ,",
    "for the supernova described above , there would be about 378 electrons produced with one neutron and about 234 with two neutrons , if the oscillations are induced only by the large solar mixing angle and the high - energy neutrinos have a fermi - dirac distribution with temperature @xmath17 and effective chemical potential @xmath18 ( see eqn.([phi2 ] ) ) . in the neutral - current channel",
    ", there would be about 105 one - neutron events and about 72 two - neutron events .",
    "these numbers come from the calculations described below .    in",
    "what follows , we investigate the supernova - neutrino signal in lead perchlorate in more detail .",
    "we discuss how the electrons produced by the charged - current scattering on lead can be used to obtain spectral information on the high - temperature neutrinos .",
    "we then examine the possibility that by using this information together with a comparison of the numbers of charged- and neutral - current events , one could distinguish among the oscillation scenarios discussed below .    in section [ sec :",
    "oscillations ] we discuss the particulars of the neutrino oscillations and what they would mean for the spectrum of electron neutrinos coming from a supernova . in section [ sec : calc ] we describe our calculations of the cross sections for neutrino - induced spallation of neutrons from lead via the charged and neutral currents .",

    "the sign of @xmath30 is unknown as well .",
    "this has important implications for supernova neutrino oscillations , since , depending on the last sign , either electron neutrinos or electron antineutrinos will undergo a resonance associated with @xmath31 .",
    "the msw effect , unlike vacuum oscillations , depends on the sign of the mass difference .",
    "the sign of @xmath32 is determined by the requirement that matter - enhanced oscillations in the sun cause a resonance in the @xmath15 rather than the @xmath33 channel .    by finding the vacuum survival probabilities of electron and muon neutrinos",
    ", one can further associate @xmath34 and translate the limit on the electron neutrino mixing angle from reactor experiments to @xmath35 . finally , one associates @xmath36 with @xmath37 .    what are the consequences of the above analysis for supernova neutrinos ? in the 3 by 3 mixing scheme there are two densities at which resonances can occur @xcite . in some cases ,",
    "shock propagation @xcite and nonaxisymmetric explosions @xcite will cause the neutrinos to encounter their resonance density more than once and thus cause time - dependent features in the profile . here",
    "we consider the problem in the first couple of seconds after the explosion , before the shock has had a chance to propagate to the point where the neutrinos may undergo a particular resonance twice .    at these relatively early times",
    ", there are two main resonances through which the electron neutrinos will propagate . the densities at which the resonances occur are set by the @xmath38 s and the energies of the neutrinos . for a given density ,",
    "the energy that a neutrino must have to undergo a resonant transformation is given by @xmath39 where the potential is @xmath40 $ ] .",
    "the sign of @xmath41 is fixed by the solution to the solar neutrino problem . however , as noted above , the sign of @xmath42 is still unknown . in a  normal hierarchy \" ( @xmath43 ) , electron neutrinos , as opposed to antineutrinos , would undergo a resonance at a density of about @xmath44 .",
    "( this is for a 40 mev neutrino and a mass scale @xmath45 . ) if the resonance were adiabatic , which would be the case if @xmath46 ( see fig .  [",

    "the original @xmath50 would therefore be seen primarily in the neutral current events .",
    "the electron neutrinos would almost all acquire the high - temperature spectrum of the original @xmath48 or @xmath49 .",
    "the @xmath47 would not mix with the other species again in the supernova , so the electron neutrinos would retain the `` hot '' spectrum as they arrive at the earth .",
    "for an electron neutrino with energy 10 mev , 40 mev and 100 mev ( left to right ) , as it goes through the resonance associated with @xmath51 . for values below @xmath52",
    "the neutrinos above 40 mev pass by unaffected , while for values much larger than this , the neutrinos convert .",

    "we assume that this resonance is adiabatic , as implied by the presupernova model profiles of @xcite .",
    "then the electron neutrinos as they would be measured as they arrive at the earth would have @xmath56 of the original @xmath15 spectrum together with @xmath57 of the original @xmath58 spectrum .",
    "the number of charged - current events in the detector would therefore be @xmath56 times the number of events expected with only the lower - temperature spectrum and @xmath59 times the number of events expected with the higher - temperature spectrum .",
    "the spectrum could be further modified by the earth - matter effect if the neutrinos travelled through the earth before reaching the detector .",
    "we do not consider scenarios intermediate between those just described , i.e. a partially adiabatic first resonance , with partial transformation .",
    "in other words , as fig .  [",
    "fig : trans ] shows , we are considering situations where @xmath60 or @xmath53 .",
    "so far we have assumed a normal hierarchy where the third mass eigenstate is the heaviest .",
    "an `` inverted '' hierarchy occurs when this state is the lightest .",
    "this would cause a resonance to occur in the electron _",
    "anti_neutrino channel at the higher density resonance associated with @xmath61 .",
    "since a lead - based detector sees very few @xmath33 s , the inverted hierarchy would produce nearly the same signal from lead in omnis or land as the normal hierarchy with very small @xmath0 .",
    "we limit our discussion to the situation where there is relatively little earth matter effect and are no sterile neutrinos .",
    "in this work we assume a fermi - dirac distribution for the high - energy neutrino component .",
    "the number flux of neutrinos is given by @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "the functions @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the fermi integrals @xmath67 we will assume equipartition of energy between the six neutrinos and antineutrinos , and vary the values of @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "because the total energy in each species is fixed , if the average neutrino energy rises , the number flux of neutrinos decreases .    to calculate the event rate from supernova neutrinos we also need to know the cross sections of the charged- and neutral - current reactions of interest : @xmath70 of course , only half of natural lead is @xmath71pb , but the cross sections from the other isotopes should not be very different because the thresholds are the same to within a couple of mev and the strength distributions depend largely on collective nuclear motion that is not much affected by the addition or removal of a few nucleons .",
    "the reaction rates in the other isotopes can be calculated through slight modifications to the methods described below .    even in @xmath71pb ,",
    "these cross sections have not yet been measured .",
    "we therefore must rely on theoretical predictions .",
    "the cross section for a neutrino with energy @xmath72 to create an electron with energy @xmath73 is @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the effective weak coupling constant , @xmath76 is the angle between the directions of the incident neutrino and the outgoing electron , @xmath77 is the outgoing electron momentum , and @xmath78 is the excitation energy of the @xmath71bi with respect to the ground state of @xmath71pb . the quantity @xmath79 is a combination of matrix elements operators of the form @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and @xmath83 ( these include the usual fermi and gamow - teller operators in the long - wavelength approximation ) where @xmath84 changes a neutron into a proton and @xmath85 is the momentum transferred to the nucleus , which ends up as @xmath71bi .",
    "our calculations are based on the coordinate - space skyrme - hartree - fock method in a 20 fm box , followed by the @xmath86- and @xmath87-matrix version of rpa with the same skyrme interaction in the basis of hartree - fock states .",
    "we actually do the calculations twice , using two different sets of expressions ( @xcite ) for @xmath79 as well as two different hartree - fock and rpa codes . for @xmath88 , @xmath89 neutrinos , the cross sections from the two versions differ only by 8% when one neutron is emitted and 4% when two are emitted .",
    "we include all multipoles up to @xmath90 .",
    "( the contributions of higher multipoles are smaller at these neutrino energies . )",
    "we truncate the hartree - fock spectrum at a value high enough to contain most of the strength ; increasing it by a few mev produces almost no change .",
    "in particular , the configuration space used is large enough to satisfy both the non - energy - weighted and the energy - weighted sum rules .",
    "we reduce the value of the axial - vector coupling constant @xmath91 from 1.26 to 1 in the @xmath92 channel to account for spin - quenching ( this may still be a slight overestimate for lead ; see ref.@xcite ) .",
    "finally , we treat the coulomb interaction of the outgoing electron with the final nucleus as in ref .",
    "( we comment on the procedure for the coulomb corrections below . )",
    "an amount of energy @xmath93 is transferred to the nucleus , so that a number of nuclear states can be excited .",
    "much of the cross section is in giant resonances , e.g.  the gamow - teller ( gt ) resonance , 15.6 mev above the ground state of @xmath71bi , and the dipole and spin - dipole resonances , which make up a broad peak centered about 25 mev above the ground state .",
    "it s important for calculations to reproduce these resonances ; an error of a few mev can make about 20@xmath94 difference in the flux - averaged cross sections @xcite . in our rpa calculations we used two skyrme forces , the venerable siii @xcite and the force sko @xcite with the  time - odd \" terms in the energy functional explicitly adjusted to reproduce gt strength distributions as described in ref .  @xcite ; we refer to the latter as sko+ .",
    "the interactions both correctly locate the isobaric analog state and gt centroid to within an mev , put the dipole and spin - dipole strength in the right region , and give similar results more generally .",
    "[ fig : enu ] shows the total cross sections from the two as a function of energy .",
    "they are nearly identical except at high energies that contribute little to the supernova - neutrino flux .     as a function of neutrino energy , for the skyrme interactions siii ( solid line ) and sko+ ( dashed line ) .",

    "( [ e:1 ] ) still holds provided the outgoing electron is replaced by a neutrino or antineutrino ( the quantity @xmath79 contains different coefficients , and is nt corrected for coulomb effects ) .",
    "we again quench all matrix elements in the @xmath92 channel by @xmath95 , and assume that the nucleon carries no isoscalar ( i.e.  strange ) axial current .",
    "our calculation here follows the same steps as in the charged - current channel except that we use the like - particle rpa instead of the charge - changing rpa .",
    "we want to calculate the individual cross sections for the emission of 0 , 1 , or 2 neutrons .",
    "following ref .",

    "the dipole and spin - dipole states ( @xmath97 , @xmath98 , and @xmath99 ) contribute 62% of the two - neutron cross section but only 15% for one - neutron emission .",

    "although ref .",
    "@xcite uses a different nuclear model , the reasons for the difference in cross sections are more basic . ref .",
    "@xcite pointed to the neglect of terms beyond lowest order in the long - wavelength expansions of the multipole operators in @xmath79 , and to a different treatment of coulomb corrections .",
    "the former increases the cross sections ( compared to ours ) dramatically , while the latter reduces them somewhat , but still leaves them too large .",
    "we have treated the coulomb corrections the same way as in ref.@xcite : at each electron energy we take the smaller of the results with a simple fermi function and the effective momentum approximation @xcite .",

    "even with an uncertainty of @xmath113 ( see the last section ) , the temperature can be determined to within about 1 mev .",
    "if the average energies can be accurately measured , therefore , the temperature of the neutrino distribution can be determined well . on the other hand ,",
    "if one considers only the average energies , a large range of chemical potentials is allowed ( at least for @xmath114 ) , almost independent of how well the average energy can be measured .",
    "one might ask how much we gain by considering the one- and two - neutron contours simultaneously . we could plot the two sets on the same figure , creating a grid that would in theory allow us to determine both @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "unfortunately the contours for the two kinds of events are nearly parallel except at large @xmath69 , so that the such a plot may not provide a stronger constraint on the flux parameters .",

    "this quantity , too , is not sensitive to @xmath69 unless @xmath69 is large .",
    "the @xmath112 and @xmath113 contours depend , of course , on what average energy is measured .",
    "furthermore , a similar analysis , both here and for the average energies , may be performed with deviations from a fermi - dirac spectrum .    , except that here we show contours of the width of electron energy distribution for one ( left figure ) and two ( right figure ) neutrons .",
    "we show contours of @xmath112 and @xmath113 for a width of 12 mev .",

    "we show contours of @xmath112 and @xmath113 for a width of 12 mev .",
    "[ fig : secondmom],width=226 ]    the extent to which the electron spectra are useful for determining the high - temperature component of the spectrum depends very much on the contamination from other neutrino sources . as discussed above , in the case of partial transformation",
    ", the low - temperature component of the spectrum will contribute very little to the average energies of electrons associated with two neutrons , but can make almost an mev difference in the average energy of electrons associated with one neutron .",
    "furthermore , if the lead perchlorate were mixed with water , interactions with chlorine , oxygen and hydrogen would also occur .",
    "oxygen and chlorine have high thresholds for the emission of neutrons , and they also emit protons , so their event rates will be low .",
    "but if the water were 20% of the detector there would be approximately 70 events from @xmath116 ( assuming a normal hierarchy with @xmath117 ) per kt of lead perchlorate .",
    "these events will be difficult to distinguish from the one - neutron charged - current events on lead .",
    "in the case of a normal hierarchy and no earth matter effect , the antineutrino signal would consist of @xmath118 of the original @xmath33 spectrum and @xmath119 of the original @xmath120 spectrum .",
    "if a detector such as superkamiokande or kamland were operating at the time , it would be able to determine the @xmath33 spectrum , making it possible to subtract out that component .",
    "if not , however , one might have to rely on the two - neutron signal . that by itself , though , is enough to get a good handle on the temperature of the high - temperature neutrinos , as discussed above .",
    "we turn finally to the problem of distinguishing between two likely neutrino spectra at the detector : a completely hot spectrum associated with the normal hierarchy and complete conversion at the first resonance , and a @xmath121 hot , @xmath122 cold mixture associated with either the inverted hierarchy or very small @xmath0 .",
    "once the electron energy spectrum has been used to learn about the hot component of the electron - neutrino energy spectrum , we can then use the ratio of charged - current to neutral - current events to get around the problem of not knowing the distance to the supernova .",
    "[ fig : cctonc ] shows the ratio of the number of charged - current events to the number of neutral - current events ( with no electrons ) . since in the charged - current reactions the neutron emission threshold is high , only high energy neutrinos cause events .",
    "furthermore , the neutral current signal is unaffected by oscillations .",
    "therefore , the partial - oscillation scenario results in a ratio that is about 3/4 ( or @xmath119 ) of what complete oscillations yield . clearly , to exploit this result",
    "it is essential to know the reaction cross sections precisely , i.e.to within about 10% .",
    "no calculations , including ours , are that certain but improvements in the model , e.g.  through an exact treatment of coulomb effects , and ( especially ) measurements of neutrino / lead cross sections could get us to that level .",
    "if experimental work on solar neutrinos continues , then at the time a supernova explodes there may well be a detector in place that can see electron antineutrinos through the reaction @xmath123 .",
    "the positron spectrum , which will closely track the incoming antineutrino distribution , could in principle be used in conjunction with lead to determine the difference between the normal and inverted hierarchies .",
    "in this paper , we have analyzed the properties of a lead - based supernova - neutrino detector .",
    "the expected energy distribution of electrons emitted with one or two neutrons peaks somewhere in the low 20 s of mev , depending on the details of the incoming neutrino spectral shape .",
    "we expect a few hundred charged- and neutral - current events per kt of lead .",
    "we have used the random - phase - approximation with effective skyrme forces to calculate neutrino - lead cross sections .",
    "our results are in agreement with those of refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , but lower than the ones in ref .",
    "@xcite , for reasons we understand .",
    "we used two different skyrme forces , siii and a parameterization we call sko+ based on the force sko ; the average electron energies obtained with these two interactions are within a few percent of each other . despite this good agreement , it is difficult to assess quantitatively the overall systematic uncertainties in our cross sections .",
    "we do nt know how much forbidden strength , which is particularly important in the two - neutron channel , is quenched , or even much about how it s distributed .",
    "it s possible , however , to improve the calculations , and additional data from neutrino scattering and electron scattering would help tremendously .",
    "the spectra of neutrinos reaching the earth can be modified by oscillations .",
    "we have argued that in most scenarios , the electron energy spectrum can be used to determine the temperature ( and perhaps the effective chemical potential ) of the hot neutrino spectrum , due to neutrinos that were originally emitted as @xmath48 or @xmath49 .",
    "( we find that lead has little sensitivity to the cold neutrinos originally emitted as @xmath15 , or , in the charged - current channel , to antineutrinos . ) with a @xmath112 theoretical uncertainty in the average energies of the electrons , there would be an approximately 0.5 mev uncertainty in the temperature of the hot neutrino spectrum .",
    "this doubles if the uncertainty is @xmath113 .",
    "these numbers are small enough so that a lead detector would provide crucial information about the proto - neutron star .",
    "we discussed the possibility of distinguishing between the complete and partial neutrino transformation by using the ratio of charged - current to neutral - current event numbers .",
    "although the idea works in principle , it would be hard to use now because of the uncertainty in calculated cross sections .",
    "however , it should be possible to distinguish between the case of no transformation and either partial or complete transformation . since some degree of transformation is expected , either due to the lma or @xmath0 this ability will provide an important check of our understanding of neutrino physics .",
    "a measurement of neutrino cross sections on lead is very important .",
    "as discussed above , we need a reasonable degree of certainty in the average energies to extract information about the incoming neutrino spectrum .",
    "that certainty is even more important if we want to see whether some or all of the original electron neutrinos have oscillated .",
    "the ability to distinguish between the two would let us use supernovae to learn something about the size of @xmath124 or discover whether nature has chosen the normal or inverted hierarchy .",
