    "recent extensive work on transition metal oxides has demonstrated a strong interrelationship between spin order and orbital order , resulting in phase diagrams of great complexity for undoped compounds with active orbital degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "a good example is lamno@xmath0 , the parent compound of colossal magnetoresistance , where thorough experimental work has produced exceptionally detailed information on the phase diagrams of the @xmath5mno@xmath0 manganites ( where @xmath5=lu , yb,@xmath6 , la ) , yet the interplay between spin and orbital degrees of freedom is puzzling and could not be resolved by the theory so far @xcite .",
    "this difficulty follows in general from the coupling to the lattice via the jahn - teller ( jt ) effect and partly from spin - orbital quantum fluctuations @xcite which contribute to superexchange @xcite and are amplified in the presence of spin - orbital entanglement on superexchange bonds @xcite .",
    "the prominent example are the perovskite vanadium oxides where the temperature dependence of optical spectral weights @xcite and the phase diagram @xcite could be understood in the theory only by an explicit treatment of entanglement @xcite .",
    "it is therefore of fundamental importance to consider simultaneously quantum spin and orbital degrees of freedom when investigating the possibility of spin - orbital order .    although ordered spin - orbital states occur in many cases including lamno@xmath0 @xcite , disordered quantum phases are very challenging , such as spin @xcite or orbital @xcite liquids when one of the two degrees of freedom is frozen .",
    "another disordered state is a quantum spin - orbital liquid @xcite , where spin - orbital order is absent and occupied ( by electrons or holes ) spin - orbital states are randomly chosen by electrons .",
    "previous attempts to find a spin - orbital liquid in the kugel - khomskii model @xcite or in linio@xmath7 @xcite turned out to be unsuccessful , and it was established that instead : ( i ) novel types of exotic spin - orbital order emerge from entanglement in the kugel - khomskii model @xcite , and ( ii ) spin and orbital interactions are of quite different strengths in linio@xmath7 and the reasons behind the absence of magnetic long range order are more subtle @xcite . therefore , the right strategy is to investigate whether ordered states may occur and to what extent strong spin - orbital coupling ( including possible entanglement ) influences the spin and orbital phase transitions .    here",
    "we focus on lamno@xmath0 , a mott insulator with mn@xmath8 ions in @xmath9 configuration with high @xmath10 spin state stabilized by hund s exchange .",
    "the singly occupied @xmath3 orbitals are the orbital degrees of freedom which order below an orbital transition at @xmath4 k , recognized as a strong jt instability when cooperative distortions of oxygen octahedra occur and induce alternating orbital ( ao ) order @xcite .",
    "antiferromagnetic ( af ) order of @xmath1-type ( @xmath1-af ) , i.e. , af phase with ferromagnetic ( fm ) @xmath11 planes staggered along the @xmath12 cubic axis , occurs below the nel temperature @xmath13 k @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to provide a comprehensive and unbiased scenario of these two phase transitions starting from the spin - orbital model of ref .",
    "@xcite using the realistic parameters .    up to now , to the best of our knowledge , the phase transitions in lamno@xmath0",
    "were investigated only using classical on - site mean field ( mf ) theory which factorizes intersite spin and orbital correlations .",
    "indeed , the @xmath1-af phase with fm planes was obtained for lamno@xmath0 @xcite , and the orbital excitations were described within the orbital model and investigated at zero temperature @xcite . unfortunately , no thermal analysis of the spin - orbital model for lamno@xmath0 was performed so far beyond the early mf study @xcite , where the importance of orbital interactions induced by jt distortions was pointed out . this result",
    "is confirmed by calculations of the transition temperature from the superexchange mechanism by using the local density approximation combined with dynamical mean field method @xcite .",
    "below we provide evidence that going beyond the on - site mf theory is necessary to get a physically correct insight into the onset of @xmath2-type ao order below the orbital phase transition and its changes below the magnetic one .",
    "we analyze the nature of orbital states occupied by @xmath3 electrons in lamno@xmath0 .",
    "the main purpose of this work is to carry out a systematic and consistent analysis of the effective spin - orbital model for lamno@xmath0 within the cluster mf approach . in particular , of primary importance is to establish the orbital order by working out the value of orbital mixing angle ( and its temperature dependence ) .",
    "the second objective of this work is to evaluate spin - orbital entanglement  both for ( i ) on - site and ( ii ) on - bond correlations . as we show below the obtained results justify _ a posteriori _ the commonly used spin - orbital decoupling approximation .",
    "the third objective is to establish the range for the jt coupling constant .",
    "the complexity of the model gives rise to technical benchmark .",

    "[ fig : sw](a ) , the changes when @xmath89 is approached from @xmath94 are here more pronounced and the ls spectral weight drops from @xmath143 at @xmath94 to @xmath144 at @xmath89 , while simultaneously the hs spectral weight increases from @xmath145 to @xmath146 , i.e. , by a factor close to 3 .",
    "it is quite remarkable that the spectral weight for the hs part is here much higher than the that of the ls part in spite of the onset of the af order at low temperature .",
    "we also note that the ls spectral weight practically does not change when temperature increases within the interval @xmath147 $ ] , and the ls weight is almost isotropic above @xmath71 .",
    "most importantly , we observe that : ( i ) the hs part dominates and is close to 0.11 , while ( ii ) the ls part is much lower and close to 0.05 for both @xmath111 and @xmath12 bond polarization above @xmath71 [ note different vertical scales in figs .",

    "@xmath176 occur as a part of description of the site s surroundings .",
    "one can replace @xmath176 by @xmath177 with ease .    for case ( ii ) we have involved the `` decoupled calculations '' with the hedgehog orbital cluster . in this calculation",
    "values @xmath178 ( and analogous ) occur as a part of the formula for magnetic exchange constants @xmath84 , see eq .",
    "( [ j ] ) .",
    "once more , one can easily replace @xmath178 by the factorized product , @xmath179 .",
    "first , for case ( i ) we obtained the following @xmath89 values : 238 k for the full model and 218k for the model with the artificially broken on - site spin - orbital correlations .",
    "of course both results are overestimated as the model consists of only one site .",
    "nevertheless , the difference should not suffer from this problem to large extent due to the errors cancelation .",
    "quite unexpectedly , the latter model has lower transition temperatures .",
    "we can elucidate this on the basis of the result presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : on_site ] . the absolute value of @xmath177 is lower than the absolute value of @xmath176 and hence the interaction between the site and its surroundings is weaker .",
    "it turns out , that the corresponding difference in @xmath180 is as big as 20k , about 10% of the total value .",
    "second , for case ( ii ) we obtained the following @xmath89 values : 181k for the full model and 201k for model with the artificially broken on - bound orbital correlations .",
    "the difference is equal to 20k .",
    "we may conclude , that the both described correlations have significant impact on nel temperature ( close to 10% of the actual @xmath89 value ) .",
    "however , corresponding corrections have opposite sign . on the grounds of this result",
    "we may draw the conclusion that the simplistic disentangled ( decoupled ) on - site model discussed in earlier chapters works surprisingly well as the two corrections approximately cancel out .",
    "we have investigated spin - orbital order in stoichiometric lamno@xmath0 using the model reported earlier @xcite which consists of superexchange and jahn - teller induced orbital terms . as a preliminary , the simple argumentation was presented that leads to quite detailed ( low temperature ) electronic state description .",
    "it was elucidated that the model used accounts for observed experimentally coexisting @xmath1-af and @xmath2-ao order below the nel temperature , and reproduces phases observed experimentally to some extent . a certain discrepancy between the predicted orbital state and the order deduced from the experimental data",
    "was detected in the value of orbital mixing angle @xmath181 .",
    "some key suggestions were given how to enrich the model  these suggestions include crystal - field effect and anharmonicity of crystal vibrations .",
    "we suggest that these extensions of the present model should be taken into account in future studies .",
    "despite the elucidated discrepancy , for the time being , we suggest the presented analysis of electronic states within this model as insightful and instructive .    to achieve a more realistic description of the lamno@xmath0 electronic state , we introduced some clusters ( entities taken out of the crystal ) and performed unbiased cluster mean field calculations at finite temperature .",
    "this makes , to the best of our knowledge , the first attempt to treat the spin and orbital phase transitions simultaneously in such a complex perovskite system .",
    "cluster approach allows to evaluate the magnetic and the orbital transition temperatures in a more realistic way than within the simple on - site mean field approach .",
    "the obtained nel temperature @xmath182 k is in good agreement with experiment , taking into account the mean field nature of the cluster method .",
    "based on the cluster calculations the value of the effective jahn - teller orbital coupling constant was deduced as reproducing correctly the orbital transition temperature . taking realistic values for all the other parameters ,",
    "we find @xmath183 mev in eq .",
    "( [ hjt ] ) .",
    "although such orbital interactions contribute on equal footing as those which result from superexchange processes for the @xmath3 orbital order , they are reduced from those estimated before due to the present cluster mean field approach .    by a careful analysis of entanglement , we have shown that both entangled on - site spin - orbital correlations and intersite orbital - orbital correlations influence the value of the nel temperature @xmath89 . however , when on - site spin - orbital entanglement is included , @xmath89 increases , while it decreases by a similar amount when intersite orbital - orbital correlations are not factorized .",
    "therefore , the errors generated by decoupling such operators partly compensate each other which explains the apparent success of the simplified effective mean field model for lamno@xmath0 where on - site spin - orbital and intersite orbital - orbital correlations are neglected",
    ".    it would be interesting to perform similar analysis of entanglement for other spin - orbital models .",
    "it is known that entanglement is large for small @xmath75 spins as shown for su(2)@xmath184su(2 ) models @xcite and for more general interactions in one dimension @xcite . here a study of spin - orbital interactions in iron pnictides @xcite would be of interest as for @xmath185 spins one expects larger entanglement than in lamno@xmath0 .",
    "experimental consequences could be quite challenging .    finally , we emphasize that the present realistic spin - orbital superexchange model has to be treated beyond the on - site mean field to extract from it realistic values of magnetic exchange constants .",
    "the obtained values of @xmath85 and @xmath86 explain the spin excitations in the observed @xmath1-type antiferromagnetic phase .",
    "we have presented also the optical spectral weights deduced from the presented model in a broad range of temperature .    summarizing ,",
    "we have shown evidence that spin - orbital entanglement is rather weak in lamno@xmath0 . the performed cluster mean field analysis allows us to establish that the spin - orbital entanglement is small for both on - site and on - bond quantities .",
    "this follows from large @xmath10 spins and explains why calculations based on the separation of spin and orbital degrees of freedom are so successful in providing valuable insights into the experimentally observable quantities for lamno@xmath0 .",
    "the most important prediction of the present theory is that the spectral weights become isotropic above the orbital transition temperature @xmath71 and the high - spin processes dominate over low - spin ones and give much higher spectral weight at low energy .",
    "this prediction could be of importance not only for lamno@xmath0 but also for ( lanio@xmath186/(lamno@xmath187 superlattices investigated recently @xcite .",
