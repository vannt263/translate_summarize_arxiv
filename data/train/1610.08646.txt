    "in this section we introduce the mathematical model describing incompressible isothermal flow in porous medium without reaction .",
    "the considered equations for the velocity and pressure fields are for flows in fluid saturated porous media .",
    "most of research results for flows in porous media are based on the darcy equation which is considered to be a suitable model at a small range of reynolds numbers . however , there are restrictions of darcy equation for modeling some porous medium flows , e.g. in closely packed medium , saturated fluid flows at slow velocity but with relatively large reynolds numbers .",
    "the flows in such closely packed medium behave nonlinearly and can not be modelled accurately by the darcy equation which is linear .",
    "the deficiency can be circumvented with the brinkman  forchheimer - extended darcy law for flows in closely packed media , which leads to the following model : let @xmath0 , @xmath1 , represent the reactor channel .",
    "we denote its boundary by @xmath2 .",
    "the conservation of volume - averaged values of momentum and mass in the packed reactor reads as follows @xmath3 where @xmath4 ,   @xmath5 denote the unknown velocity and pressure , respectively . the positive quantity @xmath6 stands for porosity which describes the proportion of the non - solid volume to the total volume of material and varies spatially in general .",
    "the expression @xmath7 represents the friction forces caused by the packing and will be specified later on .",
    "the right - hand side @xmath8 represents an outer force ( e.g. gravitation ) , @xmath9 the constant fluid density and @xmath10 the constant kinematic viscosity of the fluid , respectively .",
    "the expression @xmath11 symbolizes the dyadic product of @xmath12 with itself .",
    "the formula given by ergun @xcite will be used to model the influence of the packing on the flow inertia effects @xmath13 thereby @xmath14 stands for the diameter of pellets and @xmath15 denotes the euclidean vector norm .",
    "the linear term in ( [ s2eq2 ] ) accounts for the head loss according to darcy and the quadratic term according to forchheimer law , respectively . for the derivation of the equations , modelling and homogenization questions in porous media we refer to e.g. @xcite . to close the system ( [ s2eq1 ] )",
    "we prescribe dirichlet boundary condition @xmath16 whereby @xmath17 has to be fulfilled on each connected component @xmath18 of the boundary @xmath19 .",
    "we remark that in the case of polygonally bounded domain the outer normal vector @xmath20 has jumps and thus the above integral should be replaced by a sum of integrals over each side of @xmath19 .",
    "the distribution of porosity @xmath21 is assumed to satisfy the following bounds @xmath22 with some constants @xmath23 .",
    "a comprehemsive account of fluid flows through porous media beyond the darcy law s valid regimes and classified by the reynolds number , can be found in , e.g. , @xcite . also , see @xcite for simulating pumped water levels in abstraction boreholes using such nonlinear darcy - forchheimer law , and @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite for recent referenes on this model .    in the next section we use the porosity distribution which is estimated for packed beds consisting of spherical particles and",
