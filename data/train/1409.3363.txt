    "direct photons , i.e.  photons not originating from meson decay , represent an important probe of the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) that is assumed to have existed in the early universe and that is currently under experimental investigation in heavy - ion collisions at the cern lhc .",
    "an extraction of the effective qgp temperature from the transverse momentum ( @xmath0 ) spectrum of the thermal photons requires a precise knowledge and the subtraction of the prompt photons produced in the primary hard collisions of quarks and gluons .",
    "these photons originate not only from the hard scattering processes @xmath8 ( qcd compton scattering ) and @xmath9 ( quark - antiquark annihilation ) as shown in an exemplary way in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ( left ) , but also from purely    feynman diagrams for prompt photon production through direct parton scattering ( left ) and fragmentataion processes ( right ) . ]",
    "partonic scattering processes followed by the fragmentation of a quark or gluon into a photon as shown in fig .  [ fig:1 ] ( right ) . at leading order ( lo ) of perturbative qcd ,",
    "these processes are formally of the same order @xmath10 due to the asymptotic @xmath11 dependence of the photon fragmentation function ( ff ) . at next - to - leading order ( nlo )",
    ", they are related through the factorisation of logarithmic mass divergences @xcite .",
    "this procedure introduces a factorisation scale ( @xmath12 ) dependence in the real emission ( @xmath13 ) squared scattering matrix elements through |m^r|^2_abcde=|m^b|^2_abcdp_de(x ) + ... , where @xmath14 represents an altarelli - parisi splitting function . together with the renormalisation scale ( @xmath15 )",
    "dependence inherent in the strong coupling constant @xmath16 through the qcd @xmath17 function and the virtual loop ( @xmath18 ) corrections ,    uncertainty that is typically estimated by independent variations of @xmath15 and @xmath12 by factors of two around the central scale @xmath0 .",
    "phenomenologically , fragmentation processes are usually important at low @xmath0 , i.e.in the same region where the thermal photon signal is expected , whereas direct photons dominate at high @xmath0 .",
    "this is also the case in the alice experiment @xcite performed with lead - lead collisions of @xmath19 tev at central rapidity ( cf .",
    "[ fig:2 ] ) .",
    "relative contributions of direct and fragmentation processes initiated by quarks and gluons as a function of @xmath0 . ]    below @xmath20 gev , direct photons contribute less than 25% , fragmentation photons more than 75% .",
    "since the ffs ( in particular the one of the gluon ) are not known very precisely ( i.e.  with an uncertainty of up to an order of magnitude ) @xcite , similarly to the photon structure function @xcite , they represent a second important source of theoretical uncertainty .",
    "the reduction of this uncertainty , e.g.through dedicated measurements of low-@xmath0 inclusive photons in @xmath21 collisions at rhic , is therefore quite important @xcite .",
    "alternatively , one may resort to slightly off - shell photons which do not have important fragmentation contributions @xcite .",
    "[ fig:2 ] demonstrates that gluon - initiated scatterings dominate over those initiated by quarks in the whole @xmath0 range .",
    "the parton density functions ( pdfs ) of lead nuclei , in particular the one of the gluon , are also not precisely known , as they are affected by so - called cold nuclear effects such as shadowing @xcite .",
    "this introduces a third source of theoretical uncertainty that must be estimated , like the one for the ffs , by variations of different parametrisations that describe the fitted experimental data equally well within one standard deviation .",
    "using the nlo program jetphox @xcite , we have computed all relevant direct and fragmentation processes and compared them to the alice data @xcite in fig .  [ fig:3 ] @xcite . while we find very good agreement in the perturbatively dominated    transverse - momentum distribution of direct photons in central ( 0 - 40% ) lead - lead collisions at @xmath1 tev ( black data points @xcite ) compared to our nlo qcd predictions for prompt photons ( red ) as well as their fragmentation ( blue ) and direct ( green ) contributions .",
    "independent scale ( yellow ) and npdf ( red / blue / green ) uncertainties as well as the ff variation ( magenta ) are shown separately , as are the statistical ( vertical bars ) and systematic ( horizontal brackets ) experimental errors . ]",
    "large-@xmath0 bins , the alice data show a clear excess below 4 gev .",
    "even though the ff uncertainty is indeed very large , it can still not account for the data .",
    "the scale ( yellow ) and pdf ( red ) uncertainties are also quite substantial . with an exponential fit a(-p_t / t ) to the region 0.8 gev @xmath22 2.2 gev",
    ", we extract an inverse slope parameter @xmath23 of 304@xmath24 mev , that is very similar to the value 304@xmath2551 mev obtained by the alice collaboration @xcite . however , the error is now larger as it includes also the various theoretical sources of uncertainty described above .",
    "since the @xmath0 region selected in this fit is somewhat arbitrary , we perform in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ]    difference of experimental direct - photon and theoretical prompt - photon yields using bfg ii ( full circles ) and bfg i ( open circles ) ffs with all other errors added in quadrature . also shown",
    "are exponential fits to the points up to @xmath26 gev ( blue ) and 3.5 gev ( red ) . ]",
    "two additional fits to the ranges 1.5 gev @xmath22 2.2 gev and 1.5 gev @xmath22 3.5 gev . this can , however , only be done after properly subtracting the perturbative contribution , which starts to be substantial at intermediate @xmath0 .",
    "the latter fit is of course more reliable , as it includes more data points , and leads to values of @xmath27 mev and 329@xmath2560 mev using bfg i and ii ffs , respectively .",
    "these values are again similar to those above .",
    "this result may at first sight seem surprising and coincidental .",
    "one must , however , take into account the relative size of the prompt - photon contribution , which falls off like @xmath6 as predicted by our calculations , to the measured direct - photon rate in the different @xmath0 regions , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] .",
    "indeed , we find that prompt photons    ratio of experimental direct - photon and theoretical prompt - photon yields using bfg ii ( full circles ) and bfg i ( open circles ) ffs with all other errors added in quadrature . ]",
    "contribute less than 20% for @xmath28 gev ( less than 10% for bfg",
    "i ffs ) , i.e.  their subtraction and the theoretical error do not strongly modify the exponential fall - off of the experimental data in this region . above 4 gev , we find instead an almost constant ratio of prompt over direct photons that is consistent with one within the uncertainties , i.e.  these observed photons are produced in hard scatterings . in the intermediate region , it was already clear from fig.[fig:3 ] that the prompt - photon contribution is substantial , larger than 20% ( 10% for bfg",
    "i ffs ) , and must indeed first be subtracted from the experimental data .",
    "only then can the excess be described again by an exponential fit , which we found to be in good agreement with the fit to the unsubtracted data at low @xmath0 .",
    "in conclusion , we have performed in this work a first systematic theoretical analysis of the alice measurement of direct - photon production in central lead - lead collisions with a centre - of - mass energy of @xmath1 tev at low values of @xmath0 of 0.8 to 14 gev . based on a next - to - leading order qcd calculation , we found that prompt photon production in this region was largely induced by initial gluons and dominated by fragmentation contributions .",
    "this resulted in large theoretical uncertainties from independent variations of the renormalisation and factorisation scales , nuclear parton densities and fragmentation functions .",
    "nevertheless , we were able to confirm that the experimental data are well fitted in the region @xmath4 $ ] gev by an exponential form @xmath29 with an effective temperature of @xmath30 @xmath25 58 mev , with an only slightly larger uncertainty than the 51 mev quoted by the alice collaboration .",
    "the reason is that in this region prompt photons contribute less than 10 to 20% to the total direct photon rate , so that their subtraction and theoretical error do not influence the fit result very much .",
    "we also verified that already for values of @xmath7 gev the experimental data fall off with approximately @xmath6 as predicted by perturbative qcd . in the intermediate @xmath0-region from 1.5 to 3.5 gev ,",
    "the prompt - photon contribution had to be subtracted from the experimental data before a sensible exponential fit could be performed .",
    "we were able to verify an exponential fall - off with a very similar effective temperature of @xmath3 mev .",
    "the inverse slope parameter of this measurement is significantly higher than the one obtained previously by the phenix collaboration in 0 - 20% central gold - gold collisions with @xmath31 gev at rhic , which resulted in @xmath32 mev @xcite .",
    "the latter was higher than the transition temperature to the qgp of about @xmath33 mev , but 1.5 to 3 times smaller than the initial temperature @xmath34 of the dense matter due to the space - time evolution following its initial formation ; in hydrodynamical models , which describe the data at @xmath35 = 200 gev , @xmath34 ranges from 600 to 300 mev depending on the formation time , assumed to lie between @xmath36 and 0.6 @xmath37 @xcite .",
