    "one of the fundamental problems in coding theory is to find the minimum length of linear codes for the given minimum hamming distance @xmath3 and the given number of codewords @xmath7 , where the length of a linear code means the length of the codewords .    in this paper , we study a variant of this problem : find the minimum length of linear codes @xmath2 which achieves the given minimum hamming distance @xmath3 and the given minimum hamming distance @xmath4 of @xmath5 , where @xmath5 denotes the dual code of @xmath2 . note that the number of codewords @xmath7 is replaced by the minimum hamming distance @xmath4 of @xmath5 in our new problem .",
