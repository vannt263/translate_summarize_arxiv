    "one of the well - known and fascinating mathematical problems is about the existence of integer solutions of polynomial equations of the type @xmath0 according to fermat s last theorem , which has only been proved very recently , the above equation does not have any integer solution for @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 . however , although it took hundreds of years for mathematicians to finally come up with such a proof , this proof may not be valid for similar equations such as @xmath4 many important mathematical problems , such as goldbach s conjecture or the distribution of zeroes of riemann zeta function , can be cast into equivalent problems of whether related polynomial equations with integer coefficients have integer solutions or not . because of this , david hilbert in his famous list of mathematical problems in 1900 included as the tenth problem  @xcite the challenge :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ given any polynomial equation with any number of unknowns and with integer coefficients : to devise a universal process according to which it can be determined by a finite number of operations whether the equation has integer solutions . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    such equations are known as diophantine equations .",
    "never was it anticipated that this tenth problem is ultimately equivalent ( as shown by davis , putnam , robinson and matiyasevich , see  @xcite ) to the halting problem of turing machines of more than 30 years later . on this equivalence basis",
    "it has been concluded that hilbert s tenth is not computable : there is no _ single _ universal process to determine the existence of integer solution or lack of it for arbitrarily given diophantine equations in as far as there is no _ single _ universal machine to determine the halting or not of arbitrarily given turing machine ( which starts with some arbitrarily given input ) .",
    "thus , we would have to consider anew each different case of diophantine equation .    in spite of this widely accepted result",
    ", we have proposed a _ quantum algorithm _",
    "@xcite for solving hilbert s tenth problem . in the next section we briefly summarise the algorithm .",
    "we then next present some preliminary numerical results from the simulations of quantum processes for some very simple diophantine equations as a concrete  proof of concept \" .",
    "it suffices to consider only nonnegative solutions of a diophantine equation .",
    "let us consider the example @xmath5 with unknowns @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 .",
    "starting from the observation that if we can construct the hamiltonian @xmath6 which has a spectrum bounded from below in fact , and if we can obtain the corresponding ground state ( of least energy ) then we can solve the tenth problem !",
    "the ground state @xmath7 of the hamiltonian so constructed has the properties , for some @xmath8 , @xmath9 thus a projective measurement of the energy @xmath10 of the ground state @xmath7 will yield the answer for the decision problem : _ * _ the corresponding diophantine equation has at least one integer solution if and only if @xmath11 , and has not otherwise .",
    "_ * _ ( if @xmath12 in our example , we know that @xmath13 from the fermat s last theorem . )    from the above observation , our ground - state oracle is thus clear :    1 .   given a diophantine equation with @xmath14 unknowns @xmath1 s @xmath15 we need to simulate on some appropriate fock space the quantum hamiltonian @xmath16 2 .",
    "measurement results of appropriate observables in the ground state will provide the answer for our decision problem .",
    "one way , which is by no mean the only way , to obtain the ground state is guaranteed by the quantum adiabatic theorem  @xcite which we will exploit in the next section .      in the adiabatic approach  @xcite ,",
    "one starts with a hamiltonian @xmath17 whose ground state @xmath18 is readily achievable .",
    "then one forms a  slowly \" varying hamiltonian which interpolates between @xmath17 and @xmath19 in the time interval @xmath20 $ ] @xmath21 we will adopt this approach with the proposed ( universal ) initial hamiltonian @xmath22 which admits as the ground state the coherence state @xmath23 where @xmath24    provided the conditions of the adiabatic theorem  @xcite are observed , the initial ground state will evolve into our desirable ground state @xmath7 up to a phase : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the time - ordering operator .",
    "so our problem now is to solve the time - dependent schrdinger equation for @xmath27 $ ] @xmath28,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the initial state being the coherence state  ( [ cohstate ] ) .",
    "we can analytically show in general the two crucial results below  @xcite :    * the ground state of @xmath29 is non - degenerate for @xmath30 . as the minimum energy gap between the ground state and the first excited state is non - zero",
    ", it takes only a finite time @xmath31 for the adiabatic process , as asserted by the quantum adiabatic theorem , to generate a state which has a high probability of being the ground state of @xmath19 . * the probability of the state at time @xmath31 in some number state , @xmath32 , is greater than 1/2 _ iff _",
    "@xmath33 is the ground state of @xmath19 .",
    "that is , we only need to solve the equation for increasing @xmath31 until this majority condition is satisfied in order to _ identify _ the ground state .",
    "the proofs of these important results will be available elsewhere .",
    "* we solve the schrdinger equation numerically in some finitely truncated fock space large enough to approximate the initial coherence state to an arbitrarily given accuracy .",
    "that is , a truncation @xmath34 is chosen such that @xmath35 has a norm less than one by some chosen @xmath36 , @xmath37 .",
    "* at each time step @xmath38 , and up to @xmath39 , @xmath40 thus there are maximally only two creation operators , @xmath41 , and we can explore this fact to _ explore the infinite fock space _ by increasing the size of the truncated fock space by two at every time step .",
    "* we employ the unitary solver , with conjugate gradient method , @xmath42 which approximates @xmath43 to second order in @xmath38 .",
    "this solver , being unitary , preserves the norm of the state vector in the evolution of time even though the size of the underlying truncated fock space is allowed to increase with time if necessary . *",
    "the time step @xmath38 at time @xmath44 is a function of time and is chosen in such a way that halving this @xmath45 only results in @xmath39 correction .",
    "this is an equation resulted from the factoring of the number 15 into two prime factors . because of the nature of the problem we can fix the truncated size of our fock space to be @xmath47 in order to have the norm of the state vector less than unity by an amount @xmath48 at all times . in this and in all other simulations below",
    "we choose @xmath49 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we plot the magnitude square of maximum component ( in terms of the fock states ) of the state vector as a function of the total evolution time @xmath31 in some arbitrary unit . closed to below @xmath50 , the maximum probability components of @xmath51 are dominant by some states , denoted by ( blue ) star and ( green ) triangle symbols , none of which are the ground state .",
    "in fact , they are , respectively , the _ first _ degenerate excited states @xmath52 and @xmath53 of @xmath19 .    corresponding equation @xmath46 ; with intermediate evolution time @xmath31 . ]    with the increase in @xmath31 in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , one of the fock state , @xmath54 denoted by ( red ) box symbol , has probability greater than @xmath55 which is our criterion for being identified as the ground state .",
    "we mark this regime as the quantum adiabatic regime when the ground state wins the battle for dominance .    corresponding equation @xmath46 ; with @xmath31 entering the quantum adiabatic regime . ]    from the ground state so identified we can infer that our diophantine equation has one solution in this domain .",
    "we consider this extremely simple equation as an example which has no solution in the positive integers .",
    "the simulation parameters are as in the previous , except that the truncated size of our fock space , starting with size 8 , is now allowed to vary with time in order to simulate the exploration of the whole infinite space .    in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we plot the probabilities of the dominant components as a function of @xmath31 .",
    "below @xmath57 none of the two components is greater than one - half , and in fact the first excited state , @xmath58 denoted by ( blue ) triangle symbol , clearly dominates in this regime . eventually we enter the quantum adiabatic regime upon when the ( red ) box symbol rises over the one - half mark ; indeed it corresponds to the fock state @xmath59 which is the true ground state and which implies that our original diophantine equation has no integer solution at all .",
    "corresponding equation @xmath60 . ]",
    "we now consider a simple example which nevertheless has all the interesting ingredients typical for a general simulation of our quantum algorithm . here",
    "we choose @xmath62 and the initial fock space has only up to @xmath63 , which does not include the true ground state of @xmath19 .",
    "this is typical in our simulations since we in general would not be able to tell in advance whether our initial fock spaces do contain the true ground states or not .",
    "generally , they do not .",
    "even so , our strategy of allowing the expansion in the size of truncated fock space in time has enabled the true ground state to be found and identified .    in this example , the state @xmath64 , _ which is not included in the initial truncated fock space _ ,",
    "is eventually reached and identified as the ground state as shown as red boxes in fig .",
    "blue triangles and green stars are corresponding to the first two excited states @xmath65 and @xmath66 , which are degenerate eigenstates of @xmath19 .",
    "note that these competing pretenders somehow have unexpectedly probabilities greater than one - half ( around @xmath67 ) , contrary to our analytical result that only the ground state can have probability rising above one - half !",
    "we think that this is only some artefact of finite - size time steps @xmath38 , and expect that it would go away once we employ a more sophisticated method for solving the schrdinger equation .",
    "work is in progress to systematically extrapolate to zero - size time steps to confirm the removal of this type of finite - size effects .    corresponding equation @xmath68 .",
    "]    figs .",
    "[ fig5 ] and  [ fig6 ] depict the expectation values of occupation number and of energy as functions of @xmath31 .",
    "they are , respectively , approaching 20 and zero ( which signify the fact that our equation has an integer solution , namely 20 ) .    the expectation value of occupation number , @xmath69 , as a function of @xmath31 .",
    "]    the expectation value of energy , @xmath70 , as a function of @xmath31 . ]",
    "we here consider the issue of computability in principle , not that of computational complexity .",
    "the simulation results support the idea of implementation and execution of our quantum algorithm with a _ physical _ process  @xcite :    * run the physical process ( corresponding to the diophantine equation in consideration ) for some time @xmath31 .",
    "* repeat the process at this @xmath31 to obtain the statistics through measurements . *",
    "if none of the measurement outcomes exhibits probability of more than 1/2 , ram up the @xmath31 and go back to the step above .",
    "* eventually , at some sufficiently large @xmath31 , the measurement state with more - than - even probability can thus be identified as the ground state , terminating our physical implementation and execution . *",
    "substituting the quantum numbers for the now identified ground state enables us to see if @xmath71 and thus whether the diophantine equation has a solution .",
