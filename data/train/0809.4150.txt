    "heavy flavour production in @xmath2 collisions at hera provides a good testing ground of perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( pqcd ) as the high quark mass provides a hard scale .",
    "furthermore , other hard scales such as @xmath3 , the virtuality of the exchanged boson , or @xmath4 , the transverse momentum of the heavy quark , allow resummation techniques to be tested . measurements of production rate and kinematic properties of heavy quark bound states such as charmonium also give direct access to the non - perturbative part of the production process .",
    "new theoretical models can also be tested by searches for exotic bound states like the @xmath1 resonance .",
    "different kinematic variables are used to describe the @xmath5 interaction at hera : @xmath3 , the bjorken scaling variable , @xmath6 , and the inelasticity , @xmath7 . until 1997 hera ran at a centre - of - mass energy of @xmath8 .",
    "this energy was increased to @xmath9 for data taken from 1998 onwards . due to improvements of the detector and accelerator during a break in the data taking ,",
    "the available dataset is split into two periods . in the herai period from 1996 until 2000",
    "about @xmath10 and between 2003 and 2007 of heraii about @xmath11 per experiment were collected .",
    "the kinematic range of the analysed data can be separated in the following two regimes : photoproduction ( @xmath12 ) , where the exchanged photon in the process is almost real , and deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) , where the exchanged photon is virtual .",
    "experimentally , @xmath12 is defined by the scattered electron not being in the acceptance region of the detector , corresponding to a cut @xmath13 .",
    "there are different approaches for the calculation of heavy flavour production in next - to - leading order perturbative qcd .",
    "the massive approach assumes no initial charm or beauty in the proton ( or photon ) .",
    "heavy flavours are only generated dynamically from the gluon distribution .",
    "this approach is particularly valid if the heavy quark mass is of the order of other hard scales like @xmath3 or the transverse momentum @xmath4 of the heavy quarks . in the massless approach",
    ", the leading - logarithmic and next - to - leading logarithmic terms for example in @xmath14 are resummed .",
    "this approach assumes the heavy quark to be massless and is therefore only valid if other quantities like @xmath3 or @xmath4 provide the dominant scale .",
    "models using the @xmath15 factorisation approach  @xcite are based on non - collinear parton dynamics based on the ccfm  @xcite evolution equations . in heavy quark bound states like charmonium",
    ", only the production of the @xmath16 pair can be described in pqcd , whereas the formation of the @xmath0 bound state which occurs at long distances has to be described by phenomenological models . in the framework of non - relativistic qcd ( nrqcd )  @xcite so - called colour singlet ( cs ) and colour octet ( co ) states coexist . in the spectroscopy of heavy quark",
    "bound states containing only one heavy quark , heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) is used to predict the production and decay properties .",
    "r0.38    an important test of pqcd is provided by open heavy flavour production . in figure",
    "[ beauty ] the measurements of the beauty cross section in photoproduction of both the h1 and the zeus collaborations are shown as a function of the @xmath17 quark transverse momentum , @xmath18 .",
    "the analyses used different datasets , techniques and decay channels providing independent measurements cross - checking each other .",
    "the different measurements agree well with each other and are in reasonable agreement with the nlo prediction from fmnr@xcite .",
    "they cover a wide range in @xmath19 giving a consistent picture of @xmath17 quark photoproduction .",
    "at hera , the charmonium state @xmath0 is produced predominantly by the boson gluon fusion ( bgf ) process .",
    "the theoretical models which are used to compare with the measurements follow either the dglap evolution or use the @xmath15 factorisation approach . after the heavy quark pair ( @xmath16 ) is produced at short distances , the formation of the @xmath0 bound state is described by non - perturbative long distance matrix elements ( ldme ) . in the nrqcd models , contributions from both cs and co states",
    "are predicted ; one aim of the measurements is the extraction of their relative contributions .",
    "r0.38    the h1 collaboration measured inelastic @xmath0 production with decays to @xmath21 in the photoproduction region using @xmath22 from the 2006 - 2007 data , complementing their previous measurement in the dis region  @xcite . in figure  [ jpsi ]",
    "the differential cross section as a function of @xmath23 is shown and compared with monte carlo predictions and the cs calculations at leading order ( lo ) and at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) .",
    "the scaled cascade  @xcite monte carlo , which uses the @xmath15 factorisation in the colour changing flavour mode , is able to reproduce the slope better than the scaled epjpsi  @xcite monte carlo , following the dglap evolution .",
    "while the cs lo calculation is not able to describe the data , there is a good agreement with the nlo calculation within the large normalisation uncertainties . as the cs provides a generally good description of the data when using the @xmath15 factorisation or calculations at higher orders ,",
    "no significant colour octet contribution is required , although there are still large normalisation uncertainties on the prediction .    in order to reduce the effect of the normalisation uncertainty , polarisation measurements are an important testing ground for the nrqcd predictions .",
    "normalised quantities can be measured using helicity parameters to characterise the decay angular distributions .",
    "a measurement of the @xmath0 helicity  @xcite has been performed by the zeus collaboration using the complete hera statistics ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "the angular distributions of the @xmath25 decay can be parametrised as @xmath26  @xcite .",
    "the following integrated helicity formulae are used , depending on the chosen reference frame : +     +    [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     figure  [ spect ] shows the @xmath27 and @xmath28 distributions for the charm meson candidates reconstructed in the given decay channels .",
    "the measured masses of the observed mesons have been found to be in reasonable agreement with the world average values .",
    "in addition to the masses also the widths , helicity and the relative branching fractions could be extracted .",
    "the measured @xmath29 width is @xmath30 mev which is above the world average value of @xmath31 mev .",
    "a larger s - wave admixture at zeus with respect to that in measurements with restricted phase space could explain the differences as already a small s - wave admixture could have sizeable contributions to the @xmath29 width .",
    "the measured value for the helicity parameter of @xmath32 has to be compared with the prediction of the hqet for a pure s - wave ( @xmath33 ) and a pure d - wave ( @xmath34 ) . for the charm - strange meson @xmath35",
    "the measured parameter is @xmath36 which is inconsistent with the prediction for a pure d - wave and more than two standard deviations away from the prediction for a pure s - wave .",
    "so the measurement suggests a significant contribution of both d - wave and s - wave amplitudes to the @xmath37 decay .",
    "in addition , a search for the radially excited charm meson @xmath38has been made , which was reported by delphi as a narrow resonance in the final state @xmath39 at 2637 mev . in the inspected mass range",
    "no signal was observed and according to the expected mass and width the following limit at ( @xmath40 confidence level ) was extracted : @xmath41 .",
    "r0.4    the h1 collaboration observed a narrow signal in the @xmath1 channel at @xmath42 mev in the herai dataset  @xcite . this signal was interpreted as an anti - charm baryon with a minimal constituent quark composition of @xmath43 with a relative contribution of @xmath44 in the identified @xmath45 meson sample .",
    "in contrast to this , no evidence was found by the zeus  @xcite collaboration . using the full hera dataset h1 does not confirm the observation .",
    "the data of 2004 to 2007 correspond to an integrated luminosity of @xmath46 and thus increase the available statistics by a factor of @xmath47 .",
    "in contrast to the previous analysis of the @xmath1 final state no de / dx requirements were used for particle identification . a detailed description of the event selection can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the mass spectrum was reconstructed both for the heraii dataset as well as for the herai dataset using the new selection criteria .",
    "figure  [ pent ] shows the reconstructed invariant mass for the @xmath1 candidates separately for the two datasets . in the reanalysed herai",
    "dataset the previously reported signal is reproduced . under the assumption of the width from the herai measurement",
    "there is no excess in the heraii data visible .",
    "the upper limit at a 95 % confidence limit was calculated to be @xmath48 .",
