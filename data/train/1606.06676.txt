    "among the many notions of smoothness spaces of functions on @xmath1 are spaces of fractional smoothness which may be defined by , or intimately related to , a wavelet expansion .",

    "the reader is invited to consult @xcite and the many references therein .",
    "devore , jawerth , and popov @xcite studied approximation orders for best @xmath0term approximation of functions from these spaces with respect to a given wavelet system ; in particular , it was shown that if @xmath2 is in the triebel  lizorkin space @xmath3 ( where @xmath4 is the smoothness ) then the error of the best @xmath0term approximation in @xmath5 ( for @xmath6 ) via many wavelet systems is @xmath7 .",
    "this article studies @xmath0term approximation of functions in these smoothness spaces from nonlinear spaces associated with different kernels , which are typically related to a spline system or a _ radial basis function_. the motivation for this analysis is the work of devore and ron @xcite , which studies approximation from both linear and nonlinear spaces using kernels that arise as the solution of certain elliptic differential operators .",
    "this technique encompasses some growing kernels , but does not allow the use of some notable examples , such as multiquadrics . additionally , hangelbroek and ron @xcite analyzed best @xmath0term approximations via gaussians .",
    "the analyticity and rapid decay of the gaussian kernel allows for very fast approximation in theory ; however , their analysis does not directly extend to allow kernels of finite smoothness , and certainly not growing kernels . with these beginnings in mind",
    ", we aim to provide sufficient conditions on a family of kernels which yield @xmath7 approximation orders from a related nonlinear space .    more specifically ,",

[ prob ] find sufficient conditions on the family @xmath11 such that for @xmath12 , there exists an @xmath13 such that @xmath14    our main results give sufficient conditions on finite - smoothness kernels ( both decaying and growing ones ) which allow for such approximation orders .",
    "some notable implications of this are that other growing kernels such as the _ multiquadrics _ of all orders may be used , and also our methods allow for the use of so - called _ cardinal functions _ , which gives rise to some new nonlinear methods involving interpolation .",
    "the use of cardinal functions in turn allows for error estimates for sobolev spaces , which can not be achieved directly from the besov and triebel  lizorkin space estimates .",
    "the primary concern of this work is to demonstrate that the approximation orders of the nonlinear spaces @xmath15 associated with a large variety of kernels match the known rates for nonlinear wavelet systems , which are determined by the smoothness of the target functions .",
    "however , in the course of the proof , we exhibit a concrete approximant to a given function @xmath2 which attains the error bound of @xmath7 . as an intermediate step in the procedure , we use the fact that such @xmath12 admits a wavelet expansion of a certain type , though the choice of the wavelet is not overly important .    specifically , we employ a two - stage approximation process as follows :    * step 1 : * form a linear approximation space which provides extremely good error bounds for approximating mother wavelets which are bandlimited schwartz functions . then truncate the approximant .",
