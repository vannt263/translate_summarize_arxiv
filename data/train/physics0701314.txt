    "the single photon double ionization of the helium atom ( coulomb three - body problem ) is by now well stydied .",
    "there are several theoretical approaches and experimental results in good agreement with each other for total as well as for differential cross sections @xcite . at the same time the single photon triple ionization of the lithium atom ( coulomb four - body problem ) is still largely unexplored .    regarding the total triple photoionization cross section from the ground state of li the few existing theoretical results @xcite are in good agreement with experiment @xcite .",
    "however , for differential cross sections of three escaping electrons the theoretical studies are very limited with no experimental results currently available .",
    "the small number of theoretical studies and the current lack of experimental ones is partly due to the very small values of the differential cross sections . with the highest value of the total triple photoionization cross section for li being a few barns , the differential ones are even smaller since they sample only part of the outgoing flux .",
    "however , there are recent experimental results for differential cross sections of three outgoing electrons for the electron - impact double ionization of helium .",
    "these experiments measure the angular distribution of two ionized electrons when the incoming electron is very fast @xcite and more recently measurements were obtained for incident electrons of much lower energy @xcite . the theoretical work on differential",
    "cross sections for triple photoionization from the li ground state include : a ) a study of selection rules for different electron - momenta configurations in the three electron escape @xcite . in this work",
    ", various relative angular distributions of one of the outgoing electrons ( for a given relative angle of the other two electrons ) were presented using correlated 6 c ( coulomb ) final state wavefunctions .",
    "b ) there is also a very recent study of energy differential cross sections for photon energies of 280 , 300 and 320 ev for the triple photoionization of li using the non - perturbative time - dependent close coupling method @xcite .",
    "c ) finally , in ref @xcite the angular correlation probability is evaluated in the framework of classical mechanics .",
    "the angular correlation depends only on the relative angle between any pair of ionized electrons in the three electron escape .    in the current paper , we investigate double energy differential cross sections for the triple photoionization from the li ground state . to our knowledge , it is the first time double energy differential cross sections are formulated classically .",
    "energy differential cross sections for the complete break - up of the li atom are much more difficult to interpret compared to those for the complete break - up of the he atom . for two electron escape , for a given excess energy , there is only one energy differential cross section as a function of one electron s energy . for three electron",
    "escape , for a given excess energy , a different double energy differential cross section , as a function of one electron s energy , is obtained for each energy assigned to one of the electrons ( see below slices through differential cross sections ) .",
    "our results are obtained using a quasiclassical formulation which has been outlined elsewhere but we include it here as well , in section iia , for completeness of the paper .",
    "the classical nature of our investigation results in three distinguishable escaping electrons . in section iib",
    ", we outline how starting from the double energy differential cross sections of the three distinguishable electrons we obtain fully symmetrized ones . note that , in an ab - initio formulation the symmetry properties of the differential cross section are a natural outcome of using a fully antisymmetric wavefunction to describe the three electron state . in section iic",
    ", we discuss how the double energy differential cross sections are computed numerically . in section iii , we present the double energy differential cross sections for four different excess energies . for 115 ev",
    "our results are in very good agreement with the ab - initio double energy differential cross sections in ref@xcite for a photon energy of 320 ev . given that the ionization energy of the li ground state is equal to 203.5 ev , 320 ev photon energy corresponds to an excess energy close to 115 ev .",
    "we find that the  u - shape \" is even more pronounced for an excess energy of 220.5 ev . at 50 ev",
    ", it seems that a transition starts taking place from a ",
    "u - shape \" to a more equal energy sharing configuration .",
    "we find that at 3.8 ev the slices through the double energy differential cross section have transitioned roughly to shapes where equal energy sharing is favored .",
    "the construction of the initial phase space density @xmath0 in our quasiclassical formulation of the triple photoionization of li has been detailed in @xcite , here we give only a brief summary .",
    "we formulate the triple photoionization process from the li ground state ( @xmath1 ) as a two step process .",
    "first , one electron absorbs the photon ( photo - electron ) at time @xmath2 . through electronic correlations ,",
    "the energy gets redistributed , resulting in three electrons escaping to the continuum .",
    "our formulation accounts for the second step .",
    "we first assume that the photon is absorbed by a @xmath3-electron at the nucleus ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "this latter , approximation becomes exact in the limit of high photon energy @xcite .",
    "the cross section for photon absorption from a @xmath3 orbital is much larger than from a @xmath5 orbital @xcite .",
    "hence , we can safely assume that the photo - electron is a @xmath3 electron which significantly reduces the initial phase space to be sampled .",
    "also , by virtue of their different character the electrons become practically distinguishable and allow us to neglect antisymmetrization of the initial state .",
    "we denote the photo - electron by 1 , the other @xmath3 electron by 2 and the @xmath5 electron by 3 .",
    "following photon absorption , we model the initial phase space distribution of the remaining two electrons , @xmath3 and @xmath5 , by the wigner transform of the corresponding initial wavefunction @xmath6 , where @xmath7 are the electron vectors starting at the nucleus .",
    "we approximate the initial wavefunction as a simple product of hydrogenic orbitals @xmath8 with effective charges @xmath9 , to facilitate the wigner transformation .",
    "the @xmath9 are chosen so that they reproduce the known ionization potentials @xmath10 , namely for the 2s electron @xmath11 ( @xmath12a.u . ) and for the 1s electron @xmath13 ( @xmath14a.u . ) .",
    "( we use atomic units throughout the paper if not stated otherwise . ) the excess energy , @xmath15 , is given by @xmath16 with @xmath17 the photon energy and @xmath18 a.u .  the li triple ionization threshold energy . given the above considerations , the initial phase space density is given by @xmath19 with normalization constant @xmath20 .",
    "we next determine which fraction of @xmath0 leads to triple ionization , by following the phase space distribution in time .",
    "the evolution of a classical phase space density is determined by the classical liouville equation @xmath21 with the initial phase space values being @xmath22 and @xmath23 the classical liouville operator which is defined by the poisson bracket \\{h , } , with h the hamiltonian of the system . in our case",
    "h is the full coulomb four - body hamiltonian . in practice ,",
    "( [ eq : liouville ] ) amounts to discretizing the initial phase space , assigning weights to each discrete point @xmath24 according to @xmath25 , and evolving in time each initial condition @xmath26 with the coulomb four - body hamiltonian .",
    "this amounts to propagating electron trajectories using the classical equations of motion ( classical trajectory monte carlo method @xcite ) .",
    "regularized coordinates @xcite are used to avoid problems with electron trajectories starting at the nucleus .",
    "we label as triple ionizing those trajectories with the energies off all three electrons being , asymptotically in time , @xmath27 , with @xmath28 .",
    "our goal is to formulate the double energy differential cross section @xmath29 .",
    "it should be such that when doubly integrating over it the total triple ionization cross section is recovered : @xmath30 @xmath31 is the total photoabsorption cross section at excess energy e , which we take from experimental data for the li ground state @xcite . in what follows ,",
    "we formulate @xmath32 .    as it has already been mentioned in section iia , by considering a product of hydrogenic orbitals as our initial state , we neglect antisymmetrization in the initial state .",
    "the three escaping electrons are distinguishable resulting in three distinct double differential probabilities @xmath33 with the energy of the third electron being @xmath34 from conservation of energy and @xmath35 , @xmath36 .",
    "we next symmetrize each one of the above three double differential probabilities as follows : @xmath33 should be a ) symmetric under exchange of the electron indices , that is , it should have the same value when @xmath37 since electrons @xmath38 and @xmath39 are indistinguishable ; b ) for constant energy @xmath40 the double differential probability , which is now only a function of @xmath41 , should be symmetric with respect to @xmath42 since electrons @xmath39 and @xmath43 are indistinguishable ; for constant energy @xmath41 the double differential probability , which is now only a function of @xmath40 , should be symmetric with respect to @xmath44 since electrons @xmath38 and @xmath43 are indistinguishable ; the double differential probability that satisfies the above properties is of the following form :    @xmath45    it now follows that the symmetrized double differential probability is given by : @xmath46 where the normalization factor follows from @xmath47      to numerically evaluate the three @xmath48 we divide the energy surface @xmath49[0,e]$ ] into @xmath50 equally sized square bins .",
    "we then find the triple ionized trajectories which fall into the bins and add up their weights .",
    "note that from conservation of energy the double energy differential probabilities map out a triangle , see section iii .",
    "in the next section we present results for 220.5 , 115 , 50 and 3.8 ev excess energy .",
    "the size of @xmath51 is chosen so that we have a small standard relative error for each square bin ( the error is inversely proportional to the square root of the number of triple ionizing events in a given square bin @xcite ) . for each of the excess energies currently under investigation the number of triple ionizing trajectories used in our computations was no less than 8000 .",
    "in this section we present results for excess energies of 220.5 , 115 , 50 and 3.8 ev .",
    "our choice of excess energies allows us to investigate the double differential cross sections for energies close to threshold ( 3.8 ev ) , close to the energy where the total cross section is maximum ( 50 ev ) and for higher energies ( 115 ev and 220.5 ev ) .",
    "note , that the 115 and 220.5 ev are in the energy range where our quasiclassical formulation is still valid ( for very high excess energies one has to treat the problem quantum mechanically ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig4contour ] we plot the double energy differential cross section for three excess energies , namely 220.5 , 115 and 3.8 ev .",
    "the figure clearly illustrates that the double differential cross section has the symmetries discussed in section iib .",
    "in addition , one can see that at large excess energies , 220.5 and 115 ev , the differential cross section has a bowl shape ( with the bowl shape at 220.5 ev being more pronounced ) .",
    "that is , for a given energy of one of the electrons the other two electrons share unequally the remaining energy , see below . on the other hand , at 3.8 ev for a given energy of one of the electrons the other two electrons tend to roughly equally share the remaining energy .    to gain more insight into the double differential cross sections , we consider in figures [ fig1:220.5.5 ] , [ fig2:115 ] , [ fig11:50 ] and [ fig3:3.8 ] slices through the double energy differential cross sections for each of the four excess energies",
    ". that is , fixing the energy of one of the three escaping electrons , @xmath52 , we plot the double differential cross section as a function of the energy of another escaping electron , @xmath53 . the energy of the third outgoing electron can be found from conservation of energy . for all excess energies",
    "considered the energy surface @xmath54[0 , e]$ ] is binned in @xmath55 squares with @xmath56 for 220.5 , 115 , 50 ev while @xmath57 for 3.8 ev .",
    "our choice of n accurately accounts for the shapes of the slices through the double differential cross section for the energies considered .",
    "in addition , for excess energies of 115 and 220.5 ev we see that the slices through the double differential cross section have a `` u - shape '' which is more pronounced for the larger excess energy .",
    "the later is the well known characteristic shape of the single energy differential cross section for two outgoing electrons for high photon energies . in ref@xcite ,",
    "the slices through the differential cross sections were all found to be of `` u - shape '' .",
    "we next compare our quasicalssical results with the ab - initio results of ref @xcite for 320 ev photon energy .",
    "the comparison is only an approximate one since our binning restricts the energies @xmath52 we can consider .",
    "the value of @xmath52 we use to compare is the one closer to the energy considered by the quantum calculations .",
    "also note that the photon energy of 320 ev corresponds to a slightly higher excess energy than the 115 ev excess energy favoring a shape of slightly more unequal energy sharing than the ones considered in figs 3a ) , 3b ) , 3c ) .",
    "we compare our results for 12.32 , 28.75 , 53.4 ev respectively with the results of ref@xcite for 10 , 30 , 50 ev ( dashed line ) in figs 3a ) , 3b ) , 3c ) .",
    "our data points are the black circles while the solid lines are a fit to these data points ( the same holds for figs [ fig1:220.5.5 ] , [ fig11:50 ] , [ fig3:3.8 ] ) .",
    "we find that our results for 115 ev excess energy compare very well with those of ref@xcite .",
    "the agreement is very good for intermediate values of @xmath53 while it is not as good close to the edges .",
    "however , close to the edges , as the authors in ref@xcite point out , their results are less accurate due to some lack of convergence . from figs [ fig1:220.5.5],[fig2:115 ] we see that for large excess energies of 115 and 220.5 ev , the smaller @xmath58 is the more pronounced the unequal energy sharing between the two electrons is .",
    "that means that for a very small energy of one electron a highly unequal energy sharing is favored among the other two . for a very large energy of one electron",
    "the unequal energy sharing of the other two is not as pronounced .",
    "we next focus on the slices through the double differential cross sections for excess energies of 50 and 3.8 ev , with the later being very close to threshold , see fig .",
    "[ fig11:50 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig3:3.8 ] .",
    "one notices that at 50 ev for @xmath59 ev ( see fig .",
    "4a ) ) the maximum of the differential cross section shifts to an energy @xmath60 unlike the 115 and 220.5 ev excess energy where the maximum is at @xmath61 . in addition",
    ", one sees from fig .",
    "[ fig11:50 ] that equal energy sharing among two of the electrons is favored for intermediate @xmath53 energies ( hump in the middle of the @xmath53 energy range ) .",
    "it thus , seems , that at 50 ev excess energy a transition starts taking place from a highly unequal energy sharing at 220.5 and 115 ev to a more equal one . at 3.8 ev ,",
    "an energy very close to threshold , the transition to equal energy sharing configurations becomes even more pronounced .",
    "a comparison of figs .",
    "[ fig11:50 ] and [ fig3:3.8 ] shows that the maximum of the differential cross section for 3.8 ev has shifted to energies @xmath53 higher than those for 50 ev and for @xmath62 ev , see fig .",
    "5c ) , equal energy sharing is the favorable configuration .",
    "what is also quite interesting is that at 3.8 ev the slices through the double differential cross sections as the energy @xmath52 is increased , see figs 5a ) , 5b ) , 5c ) , have shapes similar to those of the single energy differential cross sections of the two electron escape for decreasing excess energy close to threshold , see for example @xcite .",
    "it is clear that a thorough study of the slices through the double energy differentials for the three electron escape is needed for a large number of excess energies .",
    "such a study can answer the question of how the transition takes place from a ",
    "u - shape \" at higher excess energies ( 220.5 and 115 ev ) to more equal energy sharing for energies closer to the energy of the maximum of the triple ionization cross section ( 50 ev ) and finally to energies where equal energy sharing is the favorable configuration ( 3.8 ev ) .",
    "understanding how the transition takes place will ultimately help us understand how the behavior of the three escaping electrons changes with decreasing excess energy .",
    "to compare with two electron escape , let us point out that in the latter case a transition of the single energy differential cross section takes place from an unequal energy sharing to an equal sharing one as the photon energy decreases . for the case of",
    "he double ionization , at 100 ev photon energy ( close to the energy where the maximum of the double ionization cross section is ) the single energy differential cross section is flat .",
    "100 ev is the critical energy where the transition from unequal to equal energy sharing starts taking place for two electron escape @xcite .",
    "in addition , for the case of electron - hydrogen scattering @xcite , as the excess energy is decreased ( for energies close to threshold ) it was found that the single differential cross sections have shapes similar to those shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3:3.8 ] . what are the physical implications of this similarity for the three electron case remains to be seen .",
    "we have presented the first to our knowledge quasiclassical study of double energy differential cross sections for the triple ionization of the lithium ground state .",
    "our results for 115 ev are in good agreement with ab - initio calculations , indicating that our simple initial state of a product wavefunction correctly captures the essential features of the triple ionization process by single photon absorption from the li ground state .",
    "we believe that our first results on how the transition towards threshold takes place will be the impetus for future studies of double energy differentials cross sections as the excess energy is reduced down to threshold",
    ". it could be the case that these detailed studies for a large number of excess energies will allow a connection between the shapes of the double energy differential cross sections and the sequences of collisions the three electrons follow to escape @xcite .",
