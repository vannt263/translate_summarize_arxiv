    "we use narrow - band imaging with the wide - field mosaic cameras at kitt peak national observatory ( kpno ) and cerro tololo inter - american observatory ( ctio ) 4-meter telescopes to image a relatively large area ( @xmath11 ) of the sky at once .",
    "this allows us to obtain good statistics on the candidates selected by imaging , and use them to study galaxy formation and evolution at high redshifts .",
    "confirming candidates from narrow - band imaging by spectroscopy requires large telescopes and is a slower process .",
    "but as we show in this and companion papers , the success rate for spectroscopic confirmations is high , so conclusions drawn from mere imaging candidates are probably accurate ( rhoads & malhotra 2001 , hereafter rm01 ; malhotra & rhoads 2002 ; ouchi et al .",
    "the lala survey concentrates on two primary fields in constellations botes ( j142557 + 3532 ) and cetus ( j020520 - 0455 ) .",

    "the lala fields are located within the noao deep wide - field survey ( jannuzi & dey 1999 ) , which provides deep broad - band images in @xmath1 , @xmath3 , and @xmath13 filters that support our narrow - band data .    the @xmath14 search has been conducted in the botes field using two narrow - band filters with central wavelengths @xmath15 of 815 and 823  nm , full widths at half maximum ( fwhm ) transmission @xmath16 , and peak throughputs @xmath17 .",
    "the wavelengths were chosen to fall in a gap in the night sky emission line spectrum , thus minimizing sky noise ( figure 1 ) .",
    "the filter bandpasses deteriorated below these specifications outside a central circle of @xmath18 diameter , resulting in an effective search area of @xmath19 square arcminutes . within this area",
    ", we identified a sample of 18 candidate  emitters based on strong ( @xmath20 ) detections in a narrow - band filter that substantially exceed the continuum flux level ( observer - frame equivalent width @xmath21  and a @xmath22 excess over @xmath13 band ) , and non - detections ( @xmath23 ) in ndwfs @xmath1 and lala @xmath2 filter images .",

    "spectroscopic followup of four lala @xmath7 candidates was conducted at the keck  i 10 m telescope on ut 2002 march 12 , 13 , and 14 .",
    "the observations were made using the low resolution imaging spectrometer ( lris ; oke et al .",
    "1995 ) equipped with the 400 lines / mm grating ( @xmath24   ) and multislit masks with 14 wide slitlets .",
    "the 4 lala z=5.7 candidates were targeted using 2 multislit masks ; lala5 1 - 05 and 1 - 06 were observed on march 12 for @xmath25 110 minutes , and lala5 1 - 01 and 1 - 03 were observed on march 13 and 14 for a total of 175 minutes .",
    "all observations were made with the slitlets oriented at roughly 320@xmath26 ( east of north ) .",

    "this candidate was not detected in the spectra to a @xmath33 upper limit of @xmath34 . since it was a single - filter detection in the photometric survey , it was most likely a noise spike in the narrow - band image and not a real object . given the large number ( @xmath35 ) of independent resolution elements in the images , we expect about 1 false positive at the @xmath33 level per lala imaging field per narrow - band filter , regardless of the number of true emission line galaxies present in the survey",
    ". the number of false positives could be larger if the noise properties of the image are not precisely gaussian .",

    "this asymmetry is characteristic of high redshift  and is physically associated with absorption by neutral hydrogen in outflows from actively star - forming galaxies ( e.g. , stern & spinrad 1999 ; manning et al 2000 ; dawson et al 2002 ) .",
    "this asymmetry is good evidence against an  line identification , because the close doublet structure of  is expected to give the opposite asymmetry from  under normal physical conditions for [ ] .",
    "none of the sources show any clearly detected spectral line besides the primary @xmath60  line .",
    "( the coverage is @xmath61  for lala5  1 - 05 and 1 - 06 , and @xmath62 for lala5  1 - 03 .",
    ") this immediately rules out the  doublet as a possible contaminant .    because the slit size exceeds the apparent angular size of the sources , the measured line widths contain contributions from the physical line width , the angular size of the source , and the seeing .",
    "an upper limit to the physical line width can be obtained by assuming the objects are unresolved at the 07 seeing of the spectroscopic observations , providing an effective instrumental resolution of @xmath63 .",
    "the resulting line widths are given in table  [ spectab ] .",
    "all are @xmath6 .",
    "none of the three sources shows detectable continuum on the blue side of the line in the spectra .",
    "there are marginal detections of the continuum emission on the red side of the line in two of the three sources in our spectra , with formal significance levels of @xmath64 and @xmath22 .",
    "thus , in two of the three sources we have evidence for a continuum break across the line , again supporting the identification as .",
    "these continuum measurements were done using a variance - weighted average of the flux in @xmath65  wide windows on either side of the lines .",
    "these quoted significance levels are based only on random ( photon counting ) error , and should be regarded as upper bounds on the true significance , since systematic errors will increase the uncertainty in the continuum flux .",
    "we now consider the physical implications of our observations , beginning with the properties of the individual sources and then moving on to properties of the galaxy population and of the universe at @xmath0 .",
    "the three spectroscopically confirmed  sources presented here all show very large equivalent widths , with @xmath66 lower bounds of @xmath67  ( rest frame ) and up .",
    "such large equivalent widths are very hard to achieve with only the ionizing flux from a normal stellar population , which can provide an equivalent width beyond 200  for only a few @xmath68 years ( charlot & fall 1993 ) . to produce equivalent widths beyond @xmath69",
    ", the ultraviolet radiation in the galaxies must be harder than usual .",
    "this can be achieved in galaxies with active nuclei , with a stellar metallicity near zero ( @xmath70 , tumlinson & shull 2000 ; bromm , kudritzki & loeb 2001 ) , or with a stellar initial mass function dominated by high mass stars ( malhotra & rhoads 2002 ; kudritzki et al . 2000 ) .",
    "however , conventional ( broad - lined ) active galactic nuclei are excluded by the observed  line widths in these sources , which have upper bounds from @xmath71 to @xmath72 ( table  [ spectab ] ) . thus ,",
    "if the sources are agn , they must be type  ii agns , i.e. , systems whose broad - line regions are hidden from direct view .",
    "even type  ii agn generally have larger  line widths than we observe . for radio galaxies ,",
    "a composite spectrum ( stern et al 1999 ) shows fwhm @xmath73 , while an individual case ( 4c41.17 ; dey et al 1997 ) shows a narrow component of @xmath74 but also a broad component of similar line flux and fwhm @xmath75 . for x - ray selected type  ii agn , we have one measurement at @xmath76 ( stern et al 2002 ) and one upper limit at @xmath77 ( norman et al 2002 ) .",
    "thus , line widths seem to favor star formation activity over active nuclei as the driver for the  line in these lala sources .    the remaining explanations for the observed equivalent widths both suggest star formation in primitive conditions .",
    "low metallicity stars obviously require low metallicity gas , while top - heavy initial mass functions may be a natural consequence of the way low - metallicity gas ( @xmath78 ) cools and fragments ( bromm et al 2001 ) .",
    "a final possibility is that anisotropy in the  radiation biases the equivalent width measurements substantially ( see charlot and fall 1993 ; neufeld 1991 ) , but this explanation would require a very special source geometry .",
    "further tests of the narrow - lined agn hypothesis are possible , including searches for x - ray emission and for other optical emission lines characteristic of agn ( especially civ and heii ) .",
    "such tests are underway for the lala survey s larger @xmath79 sample . to date",
    "we have seen no obvious evidence for agn activity in any of our confirmed high - redshift lala spectra .",
    "the confirmation of 3 @xmath0  emitters among 4 candidates observed allows us to refine the statistics of this population that were presented in rm01 .",
    "there we presented a sample of 18 candidates , based on detection significance , emission line strength , and an absence of blue flux .",
    "a complication in candidate selection is that the measured equivalent widths of high redshift objects may be changed by intergalactic hydrogen absorption of either continuum or line flux .",
    "a `` worst case '' ( and somewhat unrealistic ) scenario is where the broad - band flux is substantially reduced while the narrow - band flux is unaffected . if we assume this case and correct the @xmath13 band fluxes of our 18 candidates for intergalactic hydrogen absorption using a factor of @xmath80 ( based on the prescription of madau 1995 ) , we find that 13 candidates still pass the equivalent width cutoff for selection .",
    "the remaining 5 candidates could in principle be continuum sources at redshift just below @xmath81 , where an apparent narrowband excess of a factor @xmath82 could be produced by igm hydrogen absorption in the blue side of the broad band filter .",
    "we will call the 18 candidates the `` full sample '' and the 13 remaining after our worst case igm absorption correction the `` reduced sample '' in the following discussion . all four candidates with keck spectra belong to the reduced sample .    applying a 3/4 correction factor to the observed source counts for the spectroscopic success rate presented here",
    ", we find a number density of 540 ( 390 )  emitters per square degree per unit redshift for the full ( reduced ) sample .",
    "these counts are above a detection threshold of @xmath83 , where the error bar indicates the range in detection threshold between the two narrow - band filters .",
    "the implied  luminosity density at @xmath0 then becomes @xmath84 ( @xmath85 ) @xmath86 for sources with @xmath87 , based on the full ( reduced ) sample .",
    "( here and throughout this section we assume a cosmology with @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and @xmath90 . )",
    "this number is a lower bound , and the total luminosity density could be substantially increased if the luminosity function rises steeply below our detection threshold .",
    "these  luminosities can be translated into star formation rates under an assumed model for the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) and for the escape fraction of  photons from their parent galaxies . to enable comparison with other work ,",
    "we follow hu , mcmahon , & cowie ( 1999 ) and apply a conversion factor of @xmath91 . this factor",
    "is obtained by taking the  to h@xmath92 ratio for case b recombination and no dust , together with the kennicutt ( 1983 ) conversion between h@xmath92 luminosity and star formation rate .",
    "this corresponds to an imf slope @xmath93 ( close to the salpeter value of @xmath94 ) over the range @xmath95 , continued to a lower mass cutoff of @xmath96 with slope @xmath97 , with solar metallicity for all stars .",
    "we hasten to add that these assumptions appear inconsistent with the observed equivalent width distribution of the lala  emitters ( malhotra & rhoads 2002 ) , but as we can not uniquely determine the correct imf and metallicity from the available data , it is not clear how we should replace these assumptions .",
    "the resulting star formation rate density at @xmath0 is @xmath98 in objects with @xmath99 , for the full ( reduced ) samples after correction for spectroscopic completeness .",
    "the star formation rates per object range from @xmath100 to @xmath101 .    the  luminosities allow us to constrain the metal production rate density in these objects much more reliably than the total star formation rate density .",
    "the ratio of ionizing photon production to metal production depends only weakly on the details of a stellar population , because the most massive stars dominate both production rates ( e.g. , madau & shull 1996 ) .",
    "every observed  photon implies the production of @xmath102 ionizing photons ( where equality is expected in the limit of zero dust attenuation ) .",
    "the metal production rate is approximately @xmath103 , where @xmath104 is the luminosity in ionizing photons and @xmath105 is the mass in elements with atomic number @xmath106 ( madau & shull 1996 ) .",
    "thus , our  luminosity density implies a metal production rate density @xmath107 for the full ( reduced ) sample .",
    "malhotra & rhoads ( 2002 ) suggest that the emitters in the lala sample suffer little dust attenuation , based on their large observed equivalent widths .",
    "our lower bound is then likely to be near the total metal production in  emitting galaxies .",
    "however , malhotra & rhoads ( 2002 ) also note that additional objects ( accounting for @xmath108 of all galaxies ) could be removed from the sample by dust obscuration .",
    "this would result in a total metal production rate @xmath109 times larger . for comparison , we estimate the metal production rate density in lyman break galaxies at @xmath110 to be @xmath111 times larger than that in our observed  sample , based on the uv luminosity densities in steidel et al .",
    "earlier work by madau et al ( 1996 ) , adjusted to our assumed cosmology , gives @xmath112 at @xmath110 , for continuum selected 450  nm dropouts in the hubble deep field .",
    "this is again a lower bound that can be increased by corrections for low luminosity sources and for dust absorption .",
    "our spectroscopic results also reinforce the conclusion of rm01 that the space number density of  emitters with line _ luminosity _ @xmath113 shows little evolution between @xmath114 and @xmath0 .",
    "in contrast , the surface density per unit redshift of  emitters above observed line _ flux _ @xmath115 decreases by a factor of @xmath116 over the same range .",
    "this is in contrast to the baseline model of haiman & spaans ( 1999 ) , which would predict a decrease by at most a factor of @xmath117 over this redshift range .",
    "finally , the spectroscopic confirmation of these low - luminosity sources at @xmath0 secures the conclusion ( rm01 ) that the reionization redshift @xmath9 .",
    "the basic physics underlying this conclusion is simple .",
    "photons propagating through intergalactic gas with a substantial neutral fraction are subject to resonant scattering by atomic hydrogen .",
    "thus , even flux on the red side of line center can be hidden by the red damping wing of a substantially neutral igm ( miralda - escude 1998 ; miralda - escude & rees 1998 ) .",
    "this would obscure the  line from view , so that detection of the line at some redshift @xmath118 implies a predominantly ionized medium around the line source , and suggests @xmath119 ( haiman & spaans 1999 ) . while the resonantly scattered photons will eventually redshift in the hubble flow and escape to infinity , their effective photosphere ( or last scattering surface )",
    "is expected to subtend an angle @xmath120 ( loeb & rybicki 1999 ) , reducing their surface brightness by a factor @xmath121 and thereby rendering them undetectable to surveys like lala .",
    "this test was first applied by rm01 to show that @xmath9 , and subsequently by hu et al .",
    "( 2002 ) to argue for @xmath122 . to make these reionization limits firm , several nuances in the above physical argument deserve close consideration .",
    "in particular , these objects have to produce ionizing photons in order to generate the  line by recombination .",
    "if the escape fraction @xmath123 for the ionizing flux is large , the source will be surrounded by an ionized bubble in the igm .",
    "the size of this bubble is limited by the ( time - integrated ) ionizing photon production of the source .",
    "rm01 show that the ionized bubble ( in the dust - free case ) will be large enough for  photons to escape freely ( i.e. , @xmath124 ) if @xmath125 , where @xmath126 and the source is @xmath127 years old , but that @xmath128 for the observed @xmath0 lala sources . the critical constraint on @xmath129 and @xmath123 is derived from the equivalent widths of the  sources , which can only achieve their large observed values in young galaxies with modest escape fractions .",
    "the hu et al .",
    "( 2002 ) source , hcm  6a , has a more modest equivalent width ( @xmath130  rest frame ) that could be produced in systems with @xmath131 and @xmath132 , but also shows lower line luminosity @xmath133 .",
    "it therefore fulfills @xmath134 , where the last inequality comes from the age of the universe at this redshift .",
    "this should be compared with a bound @xmath135 to produce a stromgren sphere of radius @xmath136 in the denser igm at @xmath137 .",
    "thus , it again appears unlikely that hcm  6a could ionize a sufficiently large bubble in a fully neutral igm to allow its  photons to escape freely to infinity .",
    "it is possible , of course , for any particular  source near @xmath138 to be more luminous than we think and have its  flux substantially attenuated an effective  optical depth of a few .",
    "thus , hcm  6a al object may be consistent with @xmath139 ( e.g. haiman 2002 ) .",
    "however , the  luminosity function is quite steep at these flux levels , so the number of detectable  sources is still expected to drop sharply at @xmath138 . haiman ( 2002 ) estimates that the suppression of observed  flux would be a factor @xmath109 if hcm  6a is in a fully neutral igm .",
    "this would imply an intrinsic line luminosity @xmath140 , making hcm  6a more luminous than any object found by the lala survey in a volume @xmath141 greater than surveyed by hu et al .",
    "we therefore regard this possibility as unlikely .",
    "other possible loopholes involve the detailed kinematics of the  emitters and the neutral igm , including the possible effects of gas infall , galactic peculiar motions , and galactic winds . detailed consideration of these effects is beyond the scope of the current paper .",
    "however , we can make quick estimates of these effects .",
    "first , infall of the igm to a newly forming galaxy can blueshift the gas nearest the galaxy outside the  line core , but there must be some point along the line of sight where infalling gas gives way to the hubble flow and the igm has zero velocity relative to the emitted line photons . hence",
    ", infall will not greatly reduce the resonant scattering opacity .",
    "next , note that the required velocity scale to allow free escape of  is @xmath142 .",
    "peculiar velocities of this magnitude are restricted to the richest clusters of galaxies today , and should be vanishingly rare in the @xmath143 universe .",
    "finally , a spherically symmetric galactic wind with ( peculiar ) velocity @xmath142 at the source , smoothly decreasing to match the hubble flow with zero peculiar velocity at @xmath144 , would require a total energy @xmath145 .",
    "spread over a hubble time at @xmath143 , this corresponds to a mechanical luminosity of @xmath146 , substantially exceeding the total uv / optical light output of these objects ( @xmath147 ) .",
    "the required energy would of course be reduced in an igm with substantial clumping or ionization . however , mechanical energy is typically @xmath148 and at most @xmath149 of the starlight in a starburst ( leitherer & heckman 1995 ) , a factor of @xmath150 below the nave calculation above .",
    "thus , while galactic winds are common features of starbursts and probably play a role in  escape from local galaxies ( kunth et al 1998 ) , they may not be able to `` save ''  emission in a substantially neutral igm .",
    "a final concern is the possibility that a low - luminosity  source may be visible at @xmath151 if it is located within the ionized bubble of a more luminous neighbor .",
    "in this case , the neighbor might be visible to the  survey itself or to a lyman break survey of the region ( such as the ndwfs ) .",
    "the required luminosity corresponds to @xmath152 , for a stromgren sphere radius @xmath3 and a normal starburst ionizing spectrum .",
    "this number is only a lower bound because it assumes @xmath153 , which is almost certainly false for the ionizing photons .",
    "a search for ndwfs sources with @xmath154 and nondetections at the @xmath66 level in both @xmath3 and @xmath1 filters finds no viable candidates within @xmath155 ( projected physical separation ) of any of the three spectroscopically confirmed sources .    in any case",
    ", stromgren spheres of bright neighbors may explain an isolated  emitter prior to reionization ( such as the hu et al .",
    "source at @xmath137 ) , but these stromgren spheres include a minority of the volume before the overlap phase of reionization .",
    "thus , a statistical sample of  emitters such as the lala survey provides should still see a drop in counts by a factor of @xmath156 at the overlap phase .",
    "the fact that we see no such drop in our @xmath7 sample ( rm01 ) reinforces the argument that @xmath9 on the line of sight to the lala bootes field .",
    "the neutral fraction required to effectively scatter most of the flux from low - luminosity  sources can be estimated by setting @xmath157 at a velocity @xmath158 on the red side of line center .",
    "rm01 find that this requires a homogeneously mixed neutral fraction @xmath159^{-3/2}$ ] .",
    "figure  [ rei_sum ] summarizes our present observational understanding of reionization by combining this estimate for the neutral fraction limits placed by  sources with the mass - averaged neutral fraction evolution that fan et al ( 2002 ) infer from gunn - peterson trough searches in high redshift quasars ( becker et al 2001 ; pentericci et al 2002 ) .",
    "more detailed modeling that combines the  luminosity function with a more realistic , inhomogeneous igm is planned and will reduce the uncertainties in figure  [ rei_sum ] . still , because the gunn - peterson trough can not effectively probe the @xmath160 regime , it is already clear that the  emitting galaxies have a role to play in extending our knowledge of reionization to @xmath161 .    to summarize ,",
    "we have presented spectra confirming redshifts @xmath162 for three  emitting galaxies selected from the large area lyman alpha ( lala ) survey .",
    "these objects were among four candidates observed from a total sample of 18 candidates .",
    "this implies a total sample of @xmath163 real @xmath0 galaxies , easily the largest uniformly selected galaxy sample at @xmath164 .",
    "these  emitters all have narrow lines ( inconsistent with broad - lined quasars ) and very weak to absent continuum emission .",
    "they belong to the class of high equivalent width  sources found in the lala survey at @xmath79 .",
    "the population properties of these high equivalent width objects are reasonably explained by young galaxies with comparatively low metal and dust content ( malhotra & rhoads 2002 ) .",
    "the @xmath162 population is similar to the @xmath114 one in its number counts .",
    "this suggests that the sources reside in a predominantly ionized universe and hence that the reionization redshift @xmath165 .",

    "<S> narrow - band searches for  emission are an efficient way of identifying star - forming galaxies at high redshifts . </S>",
    "<S> we present keck telescope spectra confirming redshifts @xmath0 for three objects discovered in the large area lyman alpha ( lala ) survey at kitt peak national observatory . </S>",
    "<S> all three spectra show strong , narrow emission lines with the asymmetric profile that is characteristically produced in high redshift  emitters by preferential hi absorption in the blue wing of the line . </S>",
    "<S> these objects are undetected in deep @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4  narrow - band images from the noao deep wide - field survey and from lala , as expected from lyman break and  forest absorption at redshift @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> all three objects show large equivalent widths ( @xmath5  in the rest - frame ) , suggesting at least one of the following : a top - heavy initial mass function , very low stellar metallicity , or the presence of an active nucleus . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the case for an active nucleus to be weak in all three objects due to the limited width of the   emission line ( @xmath6 ) and the absence of any other indicator of quasar activity . </S>",
    "<S> the three confirmed high redshift objects were among four spectroscopically observed targets drawn from the sample of 18 candidates presented by rhoads & malhotra ( 2001 ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , these spectra support the emitter population statistics from our earlier photometric study , which imply little evolution in number density from @xmath7 to @xmath8 and provide strong evidence that the reionization redshift @xmath9 . </S>"
