    "since the very first quantitative studies of tunnelling in a chaotic system  @xcite , it has been clear that a minute scrutiny of the associated classical dynamics was required in order to understand even the most coarse features of the quantum behaviour of such systems . in essence , tunnelling is a semiclassical concept since it refers to a quantum process  typically a decay or the oscillation of an averaged observable  that is forbidden at a classical level .",
    "but , despite the numerous successes of semiclassical computations in quantum chaos , the questions of which and how classical objects can be used to understand tunnelling and to compute , say , their characteristic time scales , have been remaining widely open for sixteen years .",
    "the stakes in the battle are important since non - integrability is the generic rule of multidimensional systems and tunnelling may play a crucial rle in their transport properties .",
    "moreover , it is one of its signatures that chaotic tunnelling can be modified on several orders of magnitude by the slightest variation of any classical or quantum parameter ; therefore a deep understanding of chaotic tunnelling is required to control the process , what may be an advantage in delicate quantum experiments and , hopefully , give rise to an extremely sensitive quantum tool .",
    "some promising clues have been provided in this direction by numerical studies and experiments with cold atoms  @xcite but also with microwave cavities  @xcite where tunnelling signatures for processes that are forbidden by ray optics were observed .    of course , in order to capture the typical exponentially small tunnelling effects , it is expected that the classical dynamics should be complexified .",
    "it is well - known  @xcite that the complex solutions of hamilton s equations are actually involved in the interpretation of tunnelling of autonomous systems with one degree of freedom . in the mid 90 s , the first observations  @xcite that complex periodic orbits allow one to reproduce quantitatively some feature of chaotic tunnelling gave hope that a semiclassical strategy was indeed possible , even though the complexified classical tori are generically destroyed in chaotic systems @xcite . but to deal with tractable semiclassical trace formulae  la gutzwiller , a general criterion for selecting the complex periodic orbits was still lacking ; this need became an emergency when it was unexpectedly discovered  @xcite that chaos reveals itself in the complex phase - space through some fractal structures , the so - called laputa islands , that look like agglomerates of complex trajectories .",
    "it is only recently that some encouraging significant steps were done for retaining the relevant semiclassical skeleton  @xcite .",
    "a lot of work remains to be done in that direction , especially if one wants to deal with continuous systems where time can ( and must ) be complexified as well , unlike what occurs in discrete maps .    the second strategy to cope with chaotic tunnelling",
    "is not purely semiclassical but rather calls up random matrix theory . since the seminal work presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , a fruitful approach of quantum chaos is to replace a chaotic but deterministic hamiltonian by a random element of an ensemble of matrices that only encapsulates the global symmetries .",
    "these hybrid techniques , with both semiclassical and statistical ingredients , first allowed us to qualitatively understand the so - called chaos - assisted tunnelling , _",
    "i.e _ the observation  @xcite that tunnelling is increased _ on average _ as the transport through chaotic regions grows  @xcite .",
    "however , the extreme sensitivity of tunnelling renders the predictions very difficult even if just an order of magnitude is required .",
    "this is also true for the seemingly simple case of _ near - integrable _ dynamics where it was shown , on a discrete quasi - integrable quantum map , that the internal resonances may enhance the transitions by several orders of magnitudes  @xcite .",
    "this resonance - assisted tunnelling is also at work in discrete systems where chaos is much more developed  @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to show that the ideas in refs .",
    "@xcite are strengthened , now in a continuous system , by a systematic analysis of level dynamics and the phase - space representation of the quantum states .",
    "we shall begin in section  [ sec : model ] with a short presentation of the general framework of chaotic tunnelling and the model we choose in order to study it .",
    "we will be concerned with a typical signature of tunnelling , namely the period of rabi oscillations between two wells that are separated by a dynamical barrier",
    ". then we will show ( section  [ sec : internalstructure ] ) with a simple argument , that the attempt to reproduce the average tunnelling periods presented in ref .",
    "@xcite is far from being complete precisely because it ignores the resonances , among other things . in section  [ sec : multilevels ]",
    "we will give an illuminating illustration of a characteristic feature of chaotic tunnelling  @xcite : it appears to be a collective effect in level dynamics where not just one third state crosses a tunnelling doublet .",
    "we will give a phase - space picture of resonance - assisted tunnelling and confirm , that taking into account the resonances is unavoidable if we want to reproduce or predict the average behaviour of tunnelling transitions .",
    "in section  [ sec : rat ] , we show that the ideas of refs .  @xcite actually provide a good estimate for the average tunnelling rate in our model .",
    "the simplest non - integrable hamiltonian models are either time - dependent one - dimensional ( 1d ) systems or , equivalently , autonomous systems with two degrees of freedom where the hamiltonian is the only constant of motion .",
    "seen from the classical point of view , a generic potential induces a cascade of non - linear resonances whose overlap generates chaos  @xcite .",
    "one minimal continuous model that encapsulates these typical properties is a 1d time - dependent system whose hamiltonian is @xmath0 where @xmath1 and  @xmath2 denote canonical action - angle variables that are coordinates on a phase - space having the topology of a cylinder : it is @xmath3-periodic in position ( angle )  @xmath2 and infinitely extended in the momentum ( action ) direction .",
    "the model   can be seen as the most natural normal form where we keep only two overlapping resonances _ i.e. _ the first two time - dependent fourier components of the potential .",
    "the hamiltonian  @xmath4 can also be interpreted , provided a change of frame is performed , as a pendulum driven by a periodic wave .",
    "moreover , it is actually very similar to the effective hamiltonian that can be realised in experiments on cold atoms @xcite .",
    "we shall consider the period @xmath5 in the following .",
    "the two parameters  @xmath6 control the size of the two stable islands  @xmath7 located in phase - space near  @xmath8 respectively .",
    "when increasing the  @xmath9 s from zero , we leave the quasi - integrable free - like motion and rapidly ( at  @xmath10 ) reach a mixed regime where the two stable resonance islands are fully surrounded by a chaotic sea . if an initial condition lies inside one island , the classical motion will remain trapped forever within a very thin quasi - one dimensional layer without the possibility of escape ( this evasion is the forbidden process that tunnelling will be concerned with  @xcite ) .",
    "alternatively , a trajectory starting in between the two islands is chaotic : without being fully ergodic since it can not enter the islands , the absence of a sufficiently large number of constants of motion allows the system to explore large areas and to develop an exponential sensitivity on initial conditions . still increasing the  @xmath9 s ,",
    "the cascade of secondary resonances inside the islands erode gradually the regular zones and make them dissolve completely in the chaotic sea .",

    "increasing  @xmath9 , between @xmath13 and  @xmath14 , the two resonances at  @xmath15 start to significantly overlap , and the systems enter in a mixed regime where both regular and chaotic dynamics coexist . from @xmath16 to @xmath17 , the two stable islands  @xmath7",
    "are completely surrounded by a chaotic sea , and although they are related by the time - reversal symmetry , they are disconnected from each other at a classical level , since dynamical barriers prevent the real classical trajectories starting in one island to escape from it . for  @xmath18 ,",
    "@xmath7 have developed a relatively wide @xmath19 resonance , which is not the case for  @xmath20 where the corresponding @xmath19  resonance chain is hardly visible .",

    "the time - dependence is implemented within the floquet theory where the phases  @xmath21 of the eigenvalues of the evolution operator at time @xmath22 play the rle of the energies for autonomous systems .",
    "the eigenvectors associated with these so - called quasi - energies @xmath21 will be called the ( eigen)states of the system . when  @xmath23 is small enough compared to the typical size of the stable islands , some states , the _ regular _ states  @xmath24 ,",
    "appear to have their husimi distribution localised on the two main stable islands while other states , the _ chaotic _ states , are found to be delocalised in the chaotic sea .",
    "following the same route that is explained in great detail in ref .",
    "* & iii ) , we will keep a discrete two - fold symmetry , namely the time - reversal symmetry , by considering  @xmath12 throughout this paper  @xcite .",
    "this allows us to clearly identify the tunnelling process through the existence of small energy scales , the doublet splittings  @xmath25 , which are associated with large time scales , namely the periods  @xmath26 of tunnelling oscillations between the stable islands . in other words , the magnitude of the splittings  @xmath27 between the states that are symmetric ( @xmath28 ) and antisymmetric ( @xmath29 ) with respect to the time - reversal symmetry measure the importance of tunnelling between the two stable islands .",
    "the actual challenge of chaotic tunnelling is to understand and hopefully predict the behaviour of  @xmath25 as a classical  ( @xmath9 ) or quantum ( @xmath23 ) parameter is varied within a regime where the quantum scales are small enough to resolve the classical scales of the chaotic structures .",
    "unlike what occurs for integrable multidimensional systems where @xmath25 is a smooth monotonic function given by @xmath30   @xcite with @xmath31 being a typical classical action that characterizes the tunnelling barriers , the splittings can display huge fluctuations in the mixed regular - chaotic case , which were soon identified as a signature of chaos  @xcite .",
    "but as far as _ isolated _ fluctuations are observed this point of view must be amended .",
    "one isolated fluctuation is clearly associated with a third state whose ( quasi)energy nearly degenerates with the doublet  @xcite as @xmath9 or @xmath23 is varied .",
    "chaos is not necessarily relevant here since such fluctuations can be observed when the chaotic layers are too small ( and  @xmath23 too large ) to be resolved by the quantum waves .",
    "it may happen that the third state is also a regular state localised on another regular ebk torus , possibly belonging to another stable island .",
    "what deserves the name of chaotic tunnelling is a radical change of regime where the fluctuations are not isolated anymore and where the coarse - grained behaviour of  @xmath32 does not follow a monotonic law .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , that there actually exists a rather abrupt transition between a quasi - integrable tunnelling regime and a chaotic regime and that this transition occurs precisely when the quantum eyes can resolve the chaotic classical structures .",
    "while the study of statistics of the splittings is necessary to give an insight into chaotic tunnelling  @xcite , we will focus here on the _ average _ behaviour of the splittings .",
    "it is far from obvious that we can conceptually justify the distinction between `` large '' scales ( the average ) and `` small '' scales ( the fluctuations ) in the variations of  @xmath32 .",
    "most probably , there may exist a whole hierarchy of such variations . from the numerical point of view",
    ", however , there seems to be an overall modulation of  @xmath32 , both observed in maps ( ( * ? ? ?",

    "@xcite where the areas  @xmath31 of the stable islands are of the same order .",
    "more recent calculations within the `` kicked harper '' model , however , revealed substantial deviations between eq .   and the exact quantum tunnelling rates in the semiclassical regime , where a reasonable agreement was only found in the deep quantum limit of large @xmath23 @xcite .",

    "we have plotted here the splitting  @xmath40 between the two `` central '' states  @xmath43 localised in the two islands ; more precisely , they both were selected by the criterion of having the maximal overlap with a coherent state that is located on the central stable periodic orbit of period  @xmath22 .",

    "not only the fluctuations of  @xmath40 hardly match , but also the average behaviour is completely distinct in a semiclassical regime where  @xmath45 . a discrepancy of about five orders of magnitude can be clearly observed for @xmath46 : for  @xmath41 , we have  @xmath47 compared to  @xmath48 for  @xmath42 . at @xmath49 , on the other hand , the splittings for @xmath41 are about @xmath50 smaller than for @xmath42 .    in any case , no estimate formula  @xmath51 , which would produce approximately the same graphs for  @xmath42 and @xmath41 , can be satisfactory . at this stage",
    "it is more than plausible that the internal structure of  @xmath7 must be taken into account in any attempt to estimate  @xmath25 with the help of classical ingredients .",
    "to obtain more insight , we analyze in this section the `` level dynamics '' , _",
    "i.e. _ the changes of the quasi - energy spectrum as @xmath44 or  @xmath9 is varied .",

    "as far as the average of  @xmath32 is concerned , we can also establish a correspondence between its behaviour as a function of @xmath52 and some features of the level dynamics .",
    "first , a technical point should be mentioned at this stage . for @xmath22-periodic systems",
    "whose classical phase - space is unbounded , it is expected that the quasi - energy spectrum becomes a dense set because of the foldings of an infinite spectrum in the finite floquet zone  @xmath53-\\pi\\hbar/\\tau,\\pi\\hbar/\\tau]$ ] .",
    "hence , we need a criterion to select only those states that are relevant in the level dynamics .",
    "numerically the truncation of the floquet matrices at high @xmath54 s is not sufficient , especially for small  @xmath23 , since more and more regular and chaotic states are _ a priori _ potentially implicated in the tunnelling dynamics . to select the levels that are actually involved",

    "whose  @xmath55 is larger than a given threshold  @xmath58 will filter the levels that are the best candidates to play a rle in the tunnelling process , precisely because their wave - functions are not negligible in the area where the tunnelling doublet wave - functions live .",
    "let us fix the classical dynamics at  @xmath41 where , as we have seen in the previous section , the internal @xmath19-resonance is suspected to provoke the enhancement of average tunnelling for @xmath59 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : comparison ] ) .",
    "when we look at this plateau more carefully , we can identify two `` bumps '' that are visualised in fig .",
    "[ fig : multilevel ] .",
    "one corresponds to  @xmath60 followed by a wider one for  @xmath61 .",
    "these two bumps are in one - to - one correspondence with two bunches of levels with significant overlaps  @xmath55 crossing the tunnelling doublet  @xmath62 . more generally , we have observed in many cases , with such a level - dynamics point of view , that there seems to be a clear change of regime : for a given  @xmath58 , when the average of  @xmath25 stops decreasing , the states  @xmath56 whose quasi - energies are in the neighbourhood of  @xmath63 and whose  @xmath55 are larger than @xmath58 become significantly more numerous .",

    "[ fig : multilevel ] more states are plotted since we take a smaller  @xmath65 .",
    "when looking at the crossings with the tunnelling doublet , there still is a clear transition of regime for  @xmath67 below or above  @xmath68 , which corresponds to the end of the plateau in  @xmath40 .",
    "the three upper views show the husimi distribution of the state , @xmath69 , whose quasi - energy is  @xmath70 , for  @xmath71 .",
    "a comparison with the poincar surface of section in the neighbourhood of the stable island  @xmath72 is shown .",
    "the three lower views ( which are , actually , very similar to the upper ones at this resolution ) correspond to @xmath73 , the symmetric state whose quasi - energy is  @xmath74 can be followed for every  @xmath67 . unlike @xmath75 ,",
    "the doublet @xmath76 does not cross and has no influence on the tunnelling doublet .",
    "@xmath69 ( resp .",
    "@xmath73 ) is localised near the boundary of the two islands and indeed corresponds to the symmetric combination of the 7th ( resp .",
    "5th ) excited regular state in  @xmath77 . , width=491 ]    in order to be more convincing , this qualitative observation can be strengthened by a phase - space analysis .",
    "in addition to the unresolved tunnelling doublet  @xmath78 , we can clearly see , in the level dynamics in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratl7 ] , two other unresolved doublets  @xmath79 and  @xmath80 for  @xmath66 whose husimi distribution is mainly located near the boundary of the stable islands  @xmath81 .",
    "in fact , the doublet  @xmath79 can be followed along a quasi - continuous line even for  @xmath82 whereas the other one can not be identified unambiguously in that region of  @xmath23 corresponding to the plateau : when  @xmath44 is decreased from about  @xmath83 , the doublet line  @xmath80 encounters many avoided crossings and ramifies into the bunch of levels we have precisely associated with the bump .",
    "therefore , even if their husimi plots both look very similar , one doublet is dramatically involved in the tunnelling process while the other remains a bystander .",
    "if we compute the overlap of these states with the harmonic states inside the islands , that is , the eigenstates of the harmonic approximation of the hamiltonian   near the corresponding stable periodic orbits , we find that the bystander doublet  @xmath79 is indeed the 5th excited doublet in  @xmath7 whereas the other  @xmath80 is the  7th .",
    "this can also be checked in the floquet spectrum .",
    "indeed , we expect that the levels of the local eigenmodes of the island ( which is locally equivalent to a harmonic oscillator ) approximately differ from each other by multiples of @xmath84 where @xmath85 denotes the frequency oscillations around the center of the island at  @xmath86 .",
    "this yields @xmath87 modulo a floquet width  @xmath88 for the levels .",
    "the fact that it is precisely the quantum number  @xmath89 which is involved in the emergence of the plateau is not a coincidence .",
    "this  @xmath90 is exactly the order of the resonance  @xmath19 that dominates in  @xmath7 for  @xmath41 .",
    "the quantitative details of how the classical resonances may be implemented in order to reproduce the average behaviour of  @xmath40 will be described in the next section .",
    "even though the approximations that are involved are not always under rigorous control , we can see here the resonances at work .",
    "suppose that the classical parameters are such that one _ classical _ resonance  @xmath91 dominates the others in the stable islands  @xmath7 ( @xmath92 being an integer and @xmath90 a strictly positive integer , the order of the resonance ) .",
    "this precisely means that one torus is actually broken into a chain of  @xmath90 sub - islands centered about a stable periodic orbit of period  @xmath93 .",
    "a _ quantum _",
    "resonance occurs when two quasi - energies  @xmath94 and  @xmath95 are nearly degenerate , _",
    "i.e. _ differ by an integer number  @xmath96 of floquet widths : @xmath97 .",
    "as mentioned above , we also have @xmath98 from a semiclassical argument ( @xmath99 being an integer ) .",
    "hence , we immediately see that  @xmath100 must be an integer multiple of  @xmath90 .",
    "the analysis given so far , however , shows that the tunnelling enhancement can not be explained with just one crossing of the @xmath62 doublet by  @xmath101 .",
    "this global crossing is actually made up of many elementary crossings whose contributions can not be individually distinguished . in effect , this game involves many players among which are the states that are completely delocalised in the chaotic sea .",
    "there are also states ( `` beach '' states @xcite or `` janus '' states ) that are strongly coupled on one side to the regular states and on the other side to the chaotic ones .",

    "we can now prediagonalize the upper left `` regular '' block of the hamiltonian .",
    "this yields , in lowest nonvanishing order in the perturbation strength @xmath136 ( which is much smaller than all relevant energy differences ) , the modified central state as @xmath137 this perturbed central now exhibits a nonvanishing matrix element with one of the states that are contained within the chaotic domain : we obtain @xmath138 which can be interpreted as the effective resonance - induced matrix element between the central state and the chaotic domain . in this way , our effective hamiltonian matrix can be related to the phenomenological matrix models that constitute the starting point of the statistical theory of chaos - assisted tunnelling @xcite .",

    "this distribution is characterized by the scale @xmath141 which contains the most dominant effective matrix element ( [ eq : veff ] ) between the island s central state and one of the chaotic states , the total number @xmath142 of chaotic states , as well as the mean level spacing @xmath143 in the chaos block . in our case of a periodically driven system ,",
    "the latter is given by @xmath144 , due to the fact that the chaotic states are , in the framework of the floquet approach , uniformly distributed at random in an energy window of the size @xmath145 ( we recall that the period of the driving equals @xmath146 ) .",
    "as a consequence , we obtain @xmath147 .",
    "the distribution ( [ eq : cauchy ] ) is , strictly speaking , valid only for @xmath148 and exhibits a cutoff at @xmath149 @xcite , which ensures that the statistical expectation value @xmath150 does not diverge .",

    "@xcite , we compute for this purpose the trace of the monodromy matrix associated with a stable or unstable periodic point of the 3/7 resonance , as well as the phase space areas that are enclosed by the inner and outer separatrices of the resonance .",
    "indeed , those quantities remain invariant under the canonical transformation to the action - angle variables @xmath159 , which means that the latter need not be explicitly evaluated in order to obtain the effective coupling matrix element @xmath160 .",
    "we see that the semiclassical theory reproduces quite well the two plateaus that arise in the quantum splittings .",
    "the drop in the semiclassical splittings at @xmath161 occurs due to the fact that the island supports more than seven locally quantized eigenstates beyond this critical value of @xmath52 ; hence , two perturbative steps instead of one are required in order to connect the central state of the island to the chaotic domain .",
    "this drop is considerably softened in the quantum splittings , but can still be identified , which confirms the relevance of the resonance - assisted coupling mechanism in this tunnelling process . since nonlinear resonances represent a general feature of nonintegrable hamiltonian systems , we expect that the appearance of such step - like sequences of plateaus is a _",
    "generic _ phenomenon , which is not restricted to one particular system , but arises in various chaos - assisted tunnelling processes .",
    "this expectation is indeed confirmed by previous studies on the kicked harper @xcite , on the decay of nondispersive wave packets in driven hydrogen @xcite , as well as on the dynamical tunnelling process of cold atoms @xcite , where significant plateau structures were encountered in numerically calculated tunnelling rates .",
    "in addition to the mean value for the splittings , the probability distribution ( [ eq : cauchy ] ) can also be used in order to calculate the expectation value for their _ logarithmic variance _ characterizing the average size of fluctuations on a logarithmic scale ; we obtain @xmath162 this result is _ universal _ in the sense that it does not depend on system - specific parameters nor on @xmath23 .",

    "being an entirely classical ( @xmath23-independent ) quantity , the system - dependent prefactor @xmath36 was set equal to unity .",
    "we clearly note a substantial disagreement between this semiclassical estimation and the quantum splittings .",
    "the theory of resonance - assisted tunnelling does not reproduce the splittings in the deep quantum regime of larges values of @xmath23 , where a different mechanism , possibly in the spirit of ref .",
    "@xcite , might induce the transition to the chaos .",
    "moreover , the critical value of @xmath167 at which the drop of the splittings from the first to the second plateau occurs is significantly overestimated by our semiclassical approach .",
    "this could be due to the presence of _ partial barriers _ in the chaotic phase space domain , such as `` cantori '' @xcite , which are known to inhibit the quantum flux at not too small values for @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "if such a cantorus is manifested in the vicinity of the regular island , the effective `` quantum '' size of the island could be considerably enhanced as compared to @xmath31 , which would reduce the value of @xmath167 at which exactly @xmath90 quantum states are localized around the island .",
    "this observation is indeed in accordance with the manifestation of janus states @xcite in the spectral analysis ( see section [ sec : multilevels ] ) .",
    "significant deviations of the splittings from the semiclassical prediction are also to be expected in the deep semiclassical regime where a multitude of steps ( @xmath168 ) would be needed to connect the central state to the chaotic domain according to the expression . in this regime , the coupling via the @xmath169 resonance",

    "@xcite  can again be assisted by the presence of another nonlinear @xmath170 resonance , as long as this is permitted by the associated selection rule ( @xmath171 ) .",
    "such a @xmath170 resonance would generally exhibit a lower effective coupling strength @xmath172 and is typically of higher order than the @xmath169 resonance ( i.e. , @xmath173 and @xmath96 are typically larger than @xmath90 and @xmath92 , respectively ) .",

    "this is different , however , for @xmath174 . at this value of the coupling parameter ,",
    "the regular island @xmath7 exhibits two nonlinear resonances of almost equal importance : a @xmath19 resonance , located closer to the center of the island than at @xmath176 , and a @xmath175 resonance , located close to the chaos border ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : ps67 ] ) .",
    "this implies that a two - step tunnelling process involving both resonances can be encountered at finite values for @xmath52 . assuming that each resonance contributes with one single perturbative step ( which is the case at the values of @xmath52 considered here ) , the corresponding matrix element that connects the central state to the chaotic domain would read @xmath177 here",
    ", @xmath178 represents the pendulum coupling strength of the effective hamiltonian , and @xmath179 denote the energies in the co - rotating frame that is defined with respect to the @xmath180 resonance .",
    "this expression requires that the @xmath181th excited state , i.e.  the first state to which the central state of the island is coupled via the @xmath19 resonance , is located _ in between _ the two resonances , which implies that the action variable @xmath182 of this state ought to be lower than the action variable @xmath183 of the @xmath175 resonance .",

    "as in the case of @xmath41 , the overall agreement between the semiclassical and the quantum splittings is quite good , with significant deviations arising only in the deep quantum regime at @xmath187 as well as in the vicinity of the cross - over between the single- and the two - step process , which is artificially sharp in the semiclassical calculation .",
    "striking evidence for the validity of the two - step process is the appearance of a pronounced peak in the quantum splittings at @xmath188 , which arises due to a vanishing denominator in eq .  , i.e. , due to the fact the central state and the @xmath181th excited state become near - degenerate in the co - rotating frame .",
    "the position and height of this peak are fairly well reproduced by the semiclassical theory .",
    "in summary , we provided clear evidence of the significance of nonlinear resonances in the dynamical tunnelling process within the driven pendulum .",
    "indeed , the signature of the 3/7 resonance that is dominantly manifested in the regular island at @xmath41 is identified in various ways : ( a ) the characteristic plateau structure in the level splittings sensitively depends on whether or not the resonance is well developed within the regular island , ( b ) floquet states that exhibit an appreciable overlap with the central husimi wavefunction of the island energetically correspond to the 7th excited eigenstate within the island , and ( c ) a semiclassical expression for the tunnelling - induced splittings that is based on the resonance - assisted coupling scheme is in good agreement with the exact quantum data .",
    "the validity of the resonance - assisted tunnelling mechanism is furthermore confirmed by a striking peak in the quantum splittings at @xmath174 , which arises due to a two - step process involving two different nonlinear resonances within the regular island .",
    "both in the spectral analysis and in the semiclassical comparison , we identify traces of janus states that are located in the chaotic vicinity of the islands .",
    "this indicates that partial barriers in the chaotic domain could still be relevant in our system at the values of @xmath23 under consideration .",
    "the present approach is presumably not suited for a full - blown semiclassical theory of mixed regular - chaotic tunnelling in terms of complexified orbits , for which the ansatz of refs .",
    "@xcite provides a more convenient framework .",
    "our findings , however , provides essential ingredients to the _ interpretation _ of such semiclassical theories , in the sense that `` direct '' and `` resonance - assisted '' processes ought to be somehow represented in relevant combinations of such complex orbits .",
    "moreover , specific quantitative predictions for tunnelling rates , using only easily accessible quantities of the classical dynamics of the system , can be made on the basis of our approach , provided @xmath23 is small enough for the most dominant resonance to become relevant ( which is roughly the case if @xmath189 states fit into the island ) .",
    "we therefore believe that the principle of resonance - assisted couplings will represent the relevant paradigm also in the context of more complex dynamical tunnelling processes , e.g. , within systems that have two or more degrees of freedom .",
