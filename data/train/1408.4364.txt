    "given a connected graph @xmath2 , with vertices or nodes @xmath3 and edges @xmath4 , we imagine a random walker situated at a node @xmath5 , moving to another node @xmath6 in a single discrete time step .",
    "the choice of @xmath7 is random and has probability , @xmath8 the matrix @xmath9 is the transition matrix of a markov chain which in this paper , is assumed to be irreducible and aperiodic ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath10 is the number of nodes and as in @xcite the spread of information is described in terms of a process that is dual to the movement from informed to uninformed nodes .",
    "a random walk begins outside a pre - determined set @xmath11 of informed target nodes and ends at @xmath11 .",
    "starting at node @xmath12 , a random walker first reaches the set @xmath11 at a hitting time @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the node occupied by the walker at time @xmath15 .",
    "the hitting time is closely related to the rate of convergence in a leader - follower model of clark et al . , as well as other consensus models @xcite",
    "the effectiveness of a set a in the spread of information by random walks can then be measured by , @xmath16 where @xmath17 $ ] , is the expected number of steps to @xmath11 starting at node @xmath18 .",
    "when @xmath19 is small , @xmath11 is a desirable choice of informed nodes , but is a poor choice if @xmath19 is large . a standard result in markov chain theory",
    "tells us that @xmath20 is the ith component of the vector @xmath21 , which solves the linear equation . @xmath22 where @xmath23 is a column vector of @xmath24 ones and @xmath25 is the matrix that results from crossing out the rows and columns of @xmath26 corresponding to the nodes of @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "limited resources can constrain the maximum size of the subset to be selected so it makes sense then to ask for the most effective spreader subject to a cardinality constraint , i.e. @xmath27 borkar et al .",
    "@xcite showed that for arbitrary subsets @xmath28 , @xmath29 , that is , @xmath0 is a supermodular function .",
    "clark et al . in @xcite discussed a continuous time leader - follower problem where a set @xmath11 of leader nodes are assigned fixed function values and the remaining follower nodes update their function values by weighted exchange with their neighbors with weights defined by equation ( [ e : probtrans ] ) .",
    "if @xmath30 is strongly connected , the node function values converge to a consensus value ( vector ) determined by the leader nodes and the rate of convergence has a connection to precisely the random walk problem we are describing . in @xcite , two optimization problems are posed .",
    "the first , is to select up to @xmath31 leaders in order to minimize the convergence error . given the random walk connection the problem in clark is equivalent to the the problem posed in equation ( [ e : opt ] ) .",
    "since @xmath0 is supermodular , both references @xcite,@xcite make use of the work of @xcite to devise a greedy algorithm that builds an approximate solution to the optimization problem ( [ e : opt ] ) in a stepwise fashion until a set of cardinality @xmath31 is reached . recall that at the first stage of construction , the node with the smallest value of @xmath0 among the nodes is selected . at the @xmath32th stage",
    "the node is added to the set that results in a set of cardinality @xmath33 with the smallest value of @xmath0 . using the results of @xcite , borkar et al .",
    "were able to give some guarantee of the quality of the approximation of a weaker version of the optimization problem with the additional constraint that the set contain an element @xmath34 .",

    "+   + * example 1 * figures [ fig : jw8k1]-[fig : jw8k5 ] show the picture of a graph @xmath30 with @xmath39 nodes including the nodes of the optimal set of cardinality @xmath40 for @xmath41 through @xmath42 . in this example",
    "the optimal set of a given cardinality does not contain an optimal subset that is one element smaller .",
    "thus , for example the optimal @xmath43 element set can not be obtained from the ( unique ) @xmath44 element set . in turn",
    "the @xmath44 element set does not contain the @xmath45 element optimal set .",
    "therefore the greedy algorithm does not produce optimal sets .",
    "+   + in this paper , the optimization problem is reformulated with a view towards improving the guarantees of the greedy algorithm proved in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we seek solutions or approximations of the problem for some cardinality @xmath31 where @xmath46 where @xmath40 fixed , is the cardinality of a vertex cover of the graph .",
    "a vertex cover is an optimal set for its cardinality , so we first seek solutions of problem ( [ e : opt ] ) that are subsets of the cover .",
    "this is done in section [ s : newsolution ] in order to provide motivation for our method . since ( as we show ) it is not always possible to find optimal subsets in an arbitrary vertex cover , the search space is enlarged to a class of optimal and near optimal sets of a specified degree of optimality relative to the vertex cover ( see the definition in ( [ e : lck ] ) ) .",
    "these sets are introduced in section [ s : optnopt ] .",
    "our main result is a sufficient condition for the existence of a gredoid structure containing optimal and near optimal sets ( see theorem [ t : structure ] and corollaries [ c : case1 ] and [ c : case2 ] ) .",
    "the properties of the greedoid enable one to make local moves ( for example by adding or deleting certain elements of a set ) that preserve the optimality or near optimality of feasible sets . we have observed that solutions of the original optimization problem are well approximated by high ranking near optimal sets and the quality of the approximations can exceed the @xmath1 factor guaranteed by the greedy algorithm . in section [",
    "s : method ] we show an illustrative example .",
    "the key is the ability to improve the approximations by searching the greedoid structure .",
    "this is formalized in section [ s : graph ] , where we briefly introduce the greedoid graph whose nodes are feasible sets",
    ". properties of adjacent nodes in this graph enable local moves among sets that can be used to improve approximations and thus lay the groundwork for deterministic local search methods such as branch and bound on the one hand or stochastic search on the other .",
    "the paper concludes in section [ s : concl ] with a summary of the results and questions for further research .",
    "the optimization problem as posed in equation([e : opt ] ) assumes no advance knowledge about the optimal set or other possibly related subsets of @xmath30 . in this section",
    "we seek to explore alternative formulations of the problem that could lead to better approximations of the optimal set .",
    "the next definition will be helpful in the discussion that follows :    a of a graph @xmath2 is a set of vertices that are incident to every edge in @xmath4 .",
    "[ vcopt ] let @xmath11 be a vertex cover of the graph @xmath30 , with @xmath47 .",
    "then @xmath11 solves the optimization problem ( [ e : opt ] ) for @xmath48 .",
    "* proof : * since every edge of @xmath30 is incident to an element of @xmath11 , a random walker starting at a vertex @xmath18 outside of @xmath11 must hit @xmath11 at the first step . that is @xmath49 .",
    "now equation ( [ e : lineq ] ) implies that @xmath50 so it follows that @xmath11 must be an optimal set for its own cardinality .",
    "@xmath51    thus the problem of finding an optimal subset is partially resolved if one can construct a vertex cover .",
    "fortunately , there is a simple greedy algorithm ( sometimes called the two opt algorithm ) for constructing a maximal match , whose vertices are a vertex cover .",
    "a of a graph is a set of edges that are non - adjacent ( i.e. they do not share a common vertex ) .",
    "the set is maximal in the sense that there is no larger set with this property .    as is well known @xcite , the vertices of a maximal match form a vertex cover . to see why note that every edge @xmath52 in @xmath4 is either an edge of a maximal match or is adjacent to such an edge .",
    "thus @xmath52 contains a vertex in the match .",
    "that is , @xmath52 is incident to some vertex in the match so the definition of vertex cover is satsified .",
    "now let @xmath53 be the set of vertices of the maximal match that was constructed using the two opt algorithm .",
    "it can be shown ( @xcite ) that , @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the cardinality of the minimal vertex cover .",
    "the run time of two opt is @xmath56 @xcite . because supersets of a vertex cover are optimal sets and since we observe that optimal sets are often subsets of a vertex cover , it is natural to seek solutions of the optimization problem among the subsets of @xmath53 : @xmath57 recall that the graph in example 1 has optimal sets which can not be found by application of the greedy algorithm .",
    "however when the two opt algorithm is used to obtain edges of a maximal match @xmath58 , the vertices @xmath53 , contain optimal subsets for @xmath59 .",
    "in contrast to the greedy approach of building up to an optimal set , we start with a maximal match and obtain optimal sets of smaller cardinality as subsets . unfortunately as the next example illustrates , this approach is not always successful .",
    "+   + * example 2 : * + the vertices of two maximal matches for a graph are shown in figure [ fig : jw6vc - all ] .",
    "the figure on the left shows a maximal match whose vertex set @xmath53 contains no optimal subsets except itself while the match shown on the right contains subsets that are optimal sets for @xmath60 through @xmath61 .",
    "both maximal matches were obtained using the two opt algorithm .",
    "+ do we have a way to predict when optimal sets of predetermined cardinality are contained in a maximal match ?",
    "presently we do not .",
    "the reason is that optimality is not always preserved by adding or removing elements from a single optimal set .",
    "however as discussed in the next section and [ s : graph ] there is a greedoid containing optimal and near optimal sets ( see the definition in [ e : lck ] ) with a structure that is preserved under such operations .",
    "moreover in section [ s : proofs ] we prove sufficient conditions for a vertex cover to contain optimal and near optimal subsets ( proposition [ p : matchtowatch ] ) .      in section 1 a measure of the spread effectiveness of sets",

    "we will order all non - empty subsets @xmath62 such that @xmath63 with a ranking function @xmath64 defined as , @xmath65 where @xmath66 , and @xmath67 is the corresponding minimum .",
    "@xmath67 can be calculated by computing @xmath0 for a maximal match of cardinality @xmath40 , while @xmath68 is the maximal value of @xmath0 among all one element subsets .",

    "if this were not the case , @xmath19 would have the same value for any non - empty subset @xmath11 with @xmath70 .",

    "for a constant @xmath74 and @xmath40 , the non - empty set @xmath75 defines a set of optimal and near optimal subsets , with the degree of near optimality depending of course on @xmath76 .",
