    "the coherent potential approximation ( cpa)@xcite is a widely used method for treating disordered systems . within the cpa , the problem is first averaged over all possible disorder configurations in an attempt to regain the translational invariance lost due to disorder . then non - local correlations of the disorder potential are neglected leading to a self consistent single - site approximation ( like the weiss mean field theory of magnetism ) .",

    "it is perhaps worth pointing out that the labor involved in solving step 4 of the dca cluster problem of size @xmath34 is comparable to that of exactly solving a disordered open cluster or a disordered supercell of size @xmath34 for the same distribution of disorder",
    ". the open cluster corresponds to fixing @xmath147 . whereas , in case of the supercell , wherein a distribution of disorder over a cluster of size @xmath34 is periodically repeated , @xmath48 will be a good quantum number , and for each separate value of @xmath48 , one has a disordered cluster problem with @xmath148 .",
    "however , the consequences of disorder averaging in the different treatments are radically different .",
    "this becomes especially clear if one contemplates what the approximations correspond to for @xmath149 . while the dca for @xmath150 reduces to the cpa , the ( `` disorder averaged '' ) supercell for @xmath150 would correspond to averaging the properties due to a periodic band , and the open cluster to averaging the properties of a sharp localized level , over the distribution of the chemical potential ! analogs of these differences",
    "would persist to finite @xmath34 .",
    "the differences would show up even more glaringly in two particle properties .",
    "while the dca provides a clean prescription leading to a finite conductivity , calculation of the conductivity for the disordered open cluster requires ad - hoc smoothing procedures because of its inherently discrete spectrum , whereas the supercell would give divergent results for the conductivity because of its periodicity .",

    "an alternate way of justifying the dca in the context of disordered systems is to use the replica ( or other such ) trick for disorder averaging @xcite . for , this maps the disorder averaged problem into what looks like an interacting problem , whence the dca formalism developed by us earlier @xcite",
    "can simply be transcribed for this case , to arrive at the appropriate self consistent cluster problem . for the effective cluster problem , the replica trick can be `` un - done '' , and we recover the algorithm presented earlier in this paper .",
    "the same procedure also works for problems involving _ both disorder and interactions_. we detail this below .",
    "as is well known , for problems involving _ quenched _ disorder , as for example corresponding to the hamiltonian : @xmath151 where @xmath152 , and @xmath153 is the random potential distributed according to a given probability distribution @xmath7 , complications arise because the disorder averaging has to be done on the _ free energy _ @xmath154 and the _ green functions _",
    "@xmath155 / z .\\ ] ] here @xmath156 $ ] is the partition function , and @xmath157 represents the imaginary - time ordering operator .    in the replica trick @xcite , one writes @xmath158 and _ assumes _ that the order of taking the limit @xmath159 and disorder averaging can be interchanged .",
    "then for any positive integer @xmath160 , the resulting disorder averaged quantities such as @xmath161 , @xmath162 , etc .",
    ", can be represented in terms of an _ interacting _ problem involving @xmath160 replicas of the original electronic degrees of freedom , which we index with the subscript @xmath163 .    for example , using the standard fermionic ( grassmann variable ) functional integrals @xcite to represent the traces above , we can write @xmath164 } \\\\   \\left < g_{\\k}(\\tau ) \\right > & = & - \\int d\\ , c^ * d\\ , c \\ ; \\ ; c_{\\k,\\sigma,1}(\\tau ) \\ ; c^*_{\\k,\\sigma,1}(0 ) \\ ;   \\exp { [ -\\beta \\psi ] } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath165 is an effective free energy functional which arises from the disorder averaging , and can be written as @xmath166 where , @xmath167 and @xmath168 } = \\left < \\exp { ( - v_i \\tilde{n}_i ) } \\right >   = \\int { dv_i p(v_i ) exp { ( - v_i \\tilde{n}_i ) } } \\ ] ] in terms of the cumulants @xmath169 of the disorder distribution @xmath170 , one can write @xmath171 so , clearly , w introduces ( local in space but non - local in time ) interactions between electrons belonging to arbitrary replicas .",
    "if one re - expands @xmath172 } $ ] in powers of the cumulants @xmath169 one can perform the fermionic traces using the standard techniques of diagrammatic perturbation theory . then",
    ", order - by - order in perturbation theory , the dependence on @xmath160 is explicit and analytic , and the @xmath173 can be evaluated precisely .",
    "the resulting terms are in exact , one - to - one correspondence with the terms obtainable by writing out the diagrams from a direct perturbation expansion in powers of @xmath6 and then disorder averaging as discussed in section ii .",
    "the @xmath159 limit eliminates the diagrams ( in the interacting problem ) containing internal loops with free sums over the replica indices ( as required , since such diagrams never appear in the direct disorder averaged perturbation theory formalism of section ii ) .    for the `` replicated interacting problem '' obtained above , one can transcribe exactly the dca formalism discussed in refs .",
    "if one assumes that the self - consistent host propagators do not break replica symmetry , then the effective cluster problem corresponds to a fermionic functional integral involving an effective , self consistent cluster free energy functional given by @xmath174 but , as is easy to see using the same procedure as outlined earlier in this appendix , such an effective free energy functional is exactly what one would obtain if one were to disorder average ( using the replica trick ) a cluster problem with @xmath175 sites which are dual to the cluster momenta @xmath37 , a bare ( retarded ) cluster propagator @xmath176 , and a random potential @xmath6 distributed according to @xmath117 at every site @xmath3 of the cluster .",
    "hence we have an alternate justification for the disorder - dca algorithm set down in section iii .",
    "the above route also enables one to quickly extend our discussions in ref.@xcite regarding the 2-particle propagators , ward identities , etc .",
    ", to the disorder - dca context .",
    "most significantly , the dca estimate of the lattice self energy is minimized by the choice @xmath177 .",
    "we note that the arguments presented in the main text and in this appendix are also easily extended to problems involving _ interactions and disorder_. for example , for the case of the hubbard model with diagonal disorder , one would add to the starting hamiltonian the interaction term @xmath178 .",
    "going through exactly the same procedures as outlined above , it is not hard to see that the only change is that the effective free energy functionals for the lattice and the cluster pick up the additional terms @xmath179 and @xmath180 .",
    "the resulting cluster problem now has both interactions and disorder on the cluster of @xmath175 sites which are dual to the cluster momenta @xmath37 : a bare ( retarded ) cluster propagator @xmath181 , a random potential @xmath6 distributed according to @xmath117 , and the hubbard interaction u at every site @xmath3 of the cluster .",
    "one can resort to any technique of one s choice to solve this problem for the disorder- averaged cluster green functions @xmath84 and cluster self - energies @xmath182 and go through with the rest of the dca iteration ."
