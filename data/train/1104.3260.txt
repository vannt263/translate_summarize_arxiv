    "    the jack superpolynomials were introduced in 2003 @xcite as the orthogonal eigenfunctions of a quantum mechanical many - body problem that had been formulated a decade before , namely the supersymmetric calogero - moser - sutherland model @xcite ( see also @xcite for more results and references on this model ) .",
    "as their name suggests , the jack superpolynomials generalize jack s symmetric polynomials @xcite by incorporating both commuting and anticommuting variables .",
    "the presence of anticommuting variables obviously makes computations and demonstrations more involved than in the classical theory of symmetric polynomials . but",
    "despite this apparent complexity , the jack superpolynomials share many elegant properties with their classical counterparts @xcite , such as orthogonality with respect to two different scalar products , and duality .",
    "the aim of the article is to further develop the strong analogy between the properties of the jack superpolynomials and those of the jack polynomials . before presenting the most relevant results ,",
    "let us review some elements of the theory of symmetric superpolynomials .",
    "superpartitions were first introduced in 2001 @xcite , but it was later noticed @xcite that they could be interpreted as overpartitions @xcite or as macmahon standard diagrams @xcite .",
    "here we adopt the following definition :    [ defsuperpart ] a superpartition @xmath0 of degree @xmath1 and length @xmath2 is a pair @xmath3 of partitions @xmath4 and @xmath5 such that    1 .",

    "note that we follow macdonald s notation for partitions , diagrams and skew - diagrams ( see section  [ sectintro ] and @xcite ) . obviously , if @xmath10 , then @xmath11 can be interpreted as the partition @xmath12 .    a very convenient way to represent superpartitions",
    "was introduced in @xcite .",
    "concretely , the ferrers diagram of a superpartition @xmath13 is obtained by    1 .",
    "drawing the diagram of @xmath4 , and 2 .   replacing the cells that belong to @xmath8 by circles .",
    "figure 1 illustrates this procedure for the case @xmath14 and @xmath15 . to distinguish them from the circles ,",
    "the cells corresponding to those of @xmath5 in the diagram of @xmath0 will be called squares .",
    "because the circles form a horizontal and a vertical strip , two circles can not appear in the same column nor in the same row .",
    "in other words , two rows or two columns ending with a circle can not have the same length .",
    "this situation is clearly reminiscent of the pauli exclusion principle for fermionic states in quantum physics .",
    "for this reason , rows and columns that terminates with a circle are called fermionic , the other ones being said to be bosonic .",
    "the bosonic content of a superpartition , denoted by @xmath16 , is defined as the set of squares in the diagram of @xmath0 that do not belong at the same time to a fermionic row and a fermionic column .",
    "the fermionic content of @xmath0 is given by the complement of the bosonic content in the diagram @xmath4 , that is , @xmath17 .",

    "the only additional information we need concerning the symmetric monomials is the following stability property : @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the homomorphism @xmath51 that sends the indeterminates @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 to zero and acts as the identity on the remaining ones .",
    "note that by definition , @xmath55 is zero whenever the length of the superpartition is greater than the number of bosonic variables .    the stability property together with the fact that @xmath56 and @xmath57 for all @xmath58 , enable us to take the inverse limit : @xmath59 we can then identify @xmath60 with the following bi - graded vector space : @xmath61 given that the symmetric superpolynomials in @xmath47 bosonic and @xmath47 fermionic variables form a ring , the componentwise product between elements of @xmath62 is well defined , and so @xmath62 also carries the structure of a bi - graded algebra .",

    "definition [ defjacksusy ] is in fact a slightly more precise version than the one presented in @xcite in that the dominance order controlling the triangular decomposition is now more restrictive .",

    "we first stress that in the evaluation of a superpolynomial , only the commuting variables @xmath64 are specialized at 1 .",
    "clearly , the anticommuting variables can not be set equal to a common anticommmuting value since every fermionic monomial of degree larger than 1 would then vanish .",
    "the necessity of factorizing a vandermonde determinant is also easily understood .",
    "a homogeneous symmetric superpolynomial is of the form where @xmath103 is antisymmetric with respect to @xmath104 so that these variables can not be set equal to 1 without causing the direct vanishing of the whole expression .",
    "hence , before specializing each term , one has to factorize its antisymmetric core , that is , divide it by a vandermonde determinant of order @xmath9 .      before plunging into the different steps leading to the proof of theorems [ maint ] and [ maint2 ] , we need to review further results concerning superpartitions and symmetric superpolynomials .",
    "this is the subject of section 2 .",
    "the derivation of the evaluation formula relies on establishing in section [ slr ] the necessary conditions for the non - vanishing of the pieri - type coefficients .",
    "the relevant results in that regard are propositions  [ propgi ] and [ propgii ] ( proved in appendix  [ appenb ] ) .",
    "another required new tool is what might be called the analogue of the `` column - by - column '' decomposition of a jack polynomial ( cf .",
    "5.1 ) ) . in the present context , where a column might be either fermionic or bosonic",
    ", this requires the introduction of two distinct operations described in section  [ facpro ] : the stripping of a bosonic column and the transmutation of a fermionic column into a bosonic one    ( see figure  [ figc ] ) . at the core of these column decompositions",
    "is the following remarkable property : removing / transmuting a leftmost column of a jack superpolynomial in the right number of variables generates another jack superpolynomial , up to a proportionality factor in the non - monic case .",
    "these factors are the building blocks of the expression for the combinatorial norm as shown in section [ snorm ] . such proportionality factors ,",
    "being the ratio of two polynomials , are most readily computed when the polynomials are specialized to particular values of their variables .",
    "the proof of the evaluation formula given in theorem [ maint ] is presented in section [ spe1 ] . as explained above , before implementing the evaluation , one must first divide by a vandermonde determinant of order @xmath9 .",
    "remarkably , when @xmath97 this order can be reduced from @xmath9 to @xmath105 , which leads to the second non - trivial evaluation formula given in theorem  [ maint2 ] and whose proof is presented in section  [ spe2 ] .    as an aside",
    ", we mention that before obtaining the evaluation formula expressed in terms of skew diagrams , a quite different - looking version had been obtained by experimentation .",
    "since this might be of independent interest , it is presented in appendix  [ appd ] , where the connection between the two formulas is also sketched .",
    "finally , it should be clear from the remark following theorem [ maint2 ] that the evaluation formula for jack polynomials in superspace is actually an evaluation formula for ordinary jack polynomials with mixed symmetry ( or with prescribed symmetry in the terminology of @xcite ) .",
    "this implies that our evaluation formula must agree with the one presented in ( * ? ? ?",
    "3.6 ) ( yet another expression is given in @xcite ) .",
    "it is remarkable that the very complicated looking - form of the latter evaluation formula can be reexpressed in the simple form presented here .",
