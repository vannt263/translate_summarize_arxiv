    "molecular alignment and orientation induced by an intense laser field continue to be a challenge to both experiment and theory . on the experimental side",
    ", it has already been shown that these processes have a large variety of applications extending from chemical reactivity to nanoscale design @xcite . from the theoretical point of view ,",
    "several basic mechanisms aiming at limiting the angular range of the molecular rotational motion have been derived in order to improve their control @xcite . in this context ,",
    "one of the most efficient mechanism is the `` kick mechanism '' @xcite , which consists in a sudden angular momentum transfer to the molecule by a so - called half - cycle pulse , which features a large asymmetry in the magnitude of the positive and negative peak values .",
    "the positive part , which is of interest in the process , is of short duration as compared to the free rotational period of the molecule , and the negative part is a weak and long tail that has a limited effect on the dynamics and can be neglected as a first approximation @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that , no matter the intensity of such a field , a small parameter can be introduced by rescaling the time in the schrdinger equation and that perturbative methods can therefore be applied with respect to this parameter @xcite .    in other respects",
    ", it has recently been shown that time - dependent problems generated by short pulses can be treated by a time - dependent unitary perturbation theory ( tdupt ) @xcite , which is the time - dependent version of the perturbation theory using averaging techniques @xcite .",
    "analogous in its spirit to the interaction picture , this theory consists of a series of unitary transformations , which are aimed at rewriting the evolution operator as a product of other propagators .",
    "moreover , order by order ( van vleck ) and superexponential ( kolmogorov - arnold - moser ) algorithms can be derived .",
    "a detailed calculation scheme is provided in recent papers @xcite and its efficiency has been shown for a two - level hamiltonian .    the main purpose of the present article is to extend this study and to test the efficiency of the procedure as applied to the orientation dynamics of a diatomic molecule driven by an ultra - short electromagnetic field as a prototype .",
    "we demonstrate that the first order propagator can reproduce the time evolution in satisfactory agreement with exact results .",
    "we also show that an appropriate choice for a free parameter available in the tdupt can help improving the accuracy of the approximate propagator . finally , we use the resulting perturbative propagator to investigate the postpulse molecular dynamics and to reveal its principal features . in this paper , we consider short pulses with no asymmetry in their temporal shape , which means that the time average of the electromagnetic field over this short duration is zero .",
    "such pulses are actually those which are experimentally achievable @xcite . as the standard sudden impact approximation @xcite is not a good starting point in this case",
    ", we construct a perturbative propagator using tdupt .",
    "this enables us to determine the relevant parameters which control the orientation dynamics and to show that noticeable orientation can be obtained in this case .",
    "we also investigate the robustness with the temperature of such a mechanism and we remark that an efficient orientation may be reached for temperatures not exceeding 5 k for the licl molecule ( which represents ten @xmath0 states mainly initially populated ) .",
    "the remainder of this article is organized as follows : we outline the principles of tdupt in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , paying special attention to the flexibility of the method . starting from the expression of the hamiltonian describing the molecule licl ( within a rigid - rotor approximation ) interacting with a linearly polarized laser pulse , we derive several propagators from tdupt and compare them to the exact ( numerical ) one in sec .",
    "[ molor ] .",
    "the connections to other perturbation methods , like the magnus expansion or the sudden impact approximation , are also presented .",
    "section [ oridyn ] is devoted to a discussion of the parameters which control the orientation dynamics for experimentally available short pulses .",
    "for a temperature @xmath1 , noticeable orientation lasting over 1 ps ( or approximately one tenth of the rotational period ) is obtained in the case of a strictly zero time averaged pulse .",
    "the results are also presented at @xmath2 and in spite of temperature effects which tend to decrease the orientation , it is shown that an efficient orientation can be obtained , but for shorter durations as compared to those observed at @xmath1 .",
    "this section recalls the principles of tdupt as constructed in @xcite .",
    "the presentation followed here highlights the analogy of this procedure with the spirit of the interaction picture .",
    "we restrict ourselves to the first order , which we shall consider explicitly in the subsequent sections .",
    "to first order , it is worth noting that the general scheme described in this section is common to a time - dependent version of the van vleck and the time - dependent kam perturbation procedures .",
    "the two methods differ however at higher orders .",
    "the reader is referred to refs .",
    "@xcite for details .",
    "let @xmath3 be a time - dependent hamiltonian , and @xmath4 the corresponding evolution operator .",

    "+ the first step of the procedure consists in rewriting the propagator @xmath4 in the interaction picture . actually , one can introduce an additional parameter @xmath15 ( the standard interaction picture being obtained for @xmath16 ) @xcite @xmath17 it turns out that the truncation of tdupt at any order is strictly independent of @xmath15 @xcite .",

    "however , a time - dependent version of unitary perturbation theory can be derived allowing the iteration through a series of unitary transformations .    following this scheme ,",

    "is that this solution is not unique : the perturbation procedure offers the flexibility to control what part of @xmath20 should be retained in @xmath23 by a judicious choice of @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "we consider explicitly several such choices in the next section .    to summarize , with the help of the unitary transformation @xmath29 we have shown that the evolution operator @xmath34 satisfies the following schrdinger equation @xmath38 formally similar to eq ( [ cpt5 ] ) , but with a hamiltonian @xmath24 [ given by eq .",
    "( [ cpt6 ] ) ] decomposed as @xmath10 [ eq .",

    "@xmath42 is the solution of the following equation similar to eq .",
    "( [ cpt5 ] ) @xmath43 up to this point , the procedure involves no approximation as it is just a sequence of unitary transformations .",
    "the first order approximation consists in replacing the evolution operator @xmath44 by the identity since it is associated with an hamiltonian of order @xmath45 and is therefore equivalent to @xmath46 . combining eqs .",
    "( [ cpt4 ] ) , ( [ cpt7 ] ) and ( [ cpt12 ] ) , we finally obtain @xmath47 equation ( [ cpt14 ] ) together with the various choices of @xmath26 considered in the next section will be applied for studying molecular orientation through sec .",
    "[ molor ] .      as it has been mentioned in the previous section , the principal point one can play with to favor",
    "the convergence of the perturbation procedure is the control of the terms of @xmath20 to be kept in @xmath23 through the choice of @xmath26 .",
    "three possibilities are considered :    * for a finite duration , examination of eq .",
    "( [ cpt10 ] ) shows that no term must necessarily be kept in @xmath26 to ensure a finite operator @xmath23 .",
    "the simplest perturbative propagator is therefore obtained by taking @xmath48 . referring to eq .",
    "( [ cpt14 ] ) , one is thus left with an evolution operator , @xmath49 , of the form @xmath50 in this case , we remark that the first order propagator @xmath49 is completely equivalent to the usual first order propagator obtained with the magnus formula for the hamiltonian @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "the general relation between magnus expansion and tdupt has been derived in @xcite . *",
    "although not mandatory , secular terms , noted @xmath51 , can be taken into account in the definition of the operator @xmath26 . in the next section",
    ", we will see through numerical tests the role of such terms in the convergence of the perturbative propagator .",
    "using an averaging method for time - dependent hamiltonians @xcite , @xmath52 can be defined by the following expression @xmath53 if @xmath20 is an operator constant in time up to a time @xmath41 and with an arbitrary uniformly bounded dependence on time for @xmath54 , then it has been shown @xcite that @xmath55 .",
    "the choice @xmath56 allows one to determine the corresponding propagator as @xmath57 * owing to the reduction of the error upon addition of secular terms in the definition of the operator @xmath26 , the question that naturally arises concerns the reduction of the error upon inclusion of other terms . keeping in mind that the operator @xmath26 can be a solution of our problem as long as one is able to calculate the propagator @xmath27 , we see that this second step is , however , far from being as obvious as the first one .",
    "nevertheless , another simple and efficient solution consists in choosing the operator @xmath26 such that @xcite @xmath58 where @xmath59 is a free parameter . moreover , since @xmath26 does not depend on time , the calculation of @xmath27 turns out to be very simple .",
    "we shall see that @xmath59 plays a significant role which can enhance the accuracy of the procedure by several orders of magnitude .",
    "this possibility , already present at the first order considered here , stems from the fact that to preserve unitarity we do not expand the exponentials , retaining thereby terms of higher orders .",
    "having determined the operator @xmath26 , we can calculate the generator @xmath23 from eq .",
    "( [ cpt10 ] ) and apply the general scheme of the procedure . however , we shall point out an additional adjustment possibility of this approach which is of crucial importance with the intention of improving the accuracy of the approximate propagator .",
    "this possibility consists in writing the hamiltonian @xmath20 defined by eq .",

    "this article has focused on the application of the tdupt for studying orientation dynamics of diatomic molecules driven by pulsed laser fields .",
    "numerical tests have demonstrated the efficiency of the proposed procedure .",
    "a basic feature and advantage of the method under consideration , where the small perturbation parameter is the short pulse duration , is that it allows , through an analytical description of the molecular dynamics , for a thorough interpretation of intense laser induced orientation .    until now molecular orientation with short laser pulses had been only envisaged with non - zero time - average of the electric field as the standard sudden impact propagator predicts no post - pulse orientation when this time - average vanishes .",
    "since a free propagating electromagnetic wave must posses a zero time - averaged electric field , half - cycle pulses have been used .",
    "they are composed of a short intense pulse with non - zero time - average ( which induces the molecular orientation ) , and a long weak tail ( which is neglected ) . in this paper",
    "we considered symmetrical short laser pulses with zero time - average which are easier to produce experimentally .",
    "we constructed a perturbative propagator that enables us to elucidate the post - pulse orientation dynamics . for zero time averaged short pulses and low rotational temperatures , we have shown that the orientation may be significant depending on two leading parameters .",
    "on the one hand there is the adimensional parameter @xmath223 where @xmath72 is the rotational constant and @xmath85 the pulse duration , and on the other hand , @xmath224 , the fourier transform of the pulse area evaluated at the rescaled frequency between the first two rotational levels .",
    "the orientation is proportional to @xmath195 which for a prototype of symmetrical pulses is itself proportional to the peak amplitude and inversely proportional to the frequency . finally , we investigated the effect of temperature and showed that a good orientation with a shorter duration can be achieved for finite but low temperatures ( e.g. , up to @xmath225 in the case of licl ) by an adequate choice of these pulse parameters .",
