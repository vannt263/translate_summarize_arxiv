    "stationary or static axially symmetric exact solutions of einstein equations describing relativistic thin disks are of great astrophysical importance since can be used as models of certain stars , galaxies , accretion disk and universes .",
    "theses were first studied by bonnor and sackfield @xcite , obtaining pressureless static disks , and then by morgan and morgan , obtaining static disks with and without radial pressure @xcite . in connection with gravitational collapse , disks were first studied by chamorro , gregory and stewart @xcite .",
    "disks with radial tension have been also recently studied @xcite .",
    "several classes of exact solutions of the einstein field equations corresponding to static and stationary thin disks have been obtained by different authors [ [ bib : lp ]  [ bib : gl2 ] ] , with or without radial pressure .    in the case of static disks without radial pressure , there are two common interpretations .",
    "the stability of these models can be explained by either assuming the existence of hoop stresses or that the particles on the disk plane move under the action of their own gravitational field in such a way that as many particles move clockwise as counterclockwise .",
    "this last interpretation , the `` counter - rotating model '' ( crm ) , is frequently made since it can be invoked to mimic true rotational effects . even though this interpretation can be seen as a device , there are observational evidence of disks made of streams of rotating and counter - rotating matter @xcite",
    ".    disklike sources in presence of electrogmatic fields , specially magnetic fields , are also of astrophysical interest mainly in the study of neutron stars , white dwarfs and galaxy formation . in the context of general relativity models of disks for kerr - newman metrics",
    "@xcite , static axisymmetric spacetimes with magnetic fields @xcite and corformastationary metrics @xcite , have been considered recently . following the ref .",
    "@xcite the resultating disks can also be interpreted either as rings with internal pressure and currents or as two counter - rotating streams of freely moving charged particles , i.e. which move along electrogeodesics ( solution to the geodesic equation in the presence of a lorentz force ) .",
    "the aim of this paper is to perform a detailed study of the crm for generic electrostatic ( magnetostatic ) axially symmetric thin disks without radial pressure .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "2 we present a summary of the procedure to obtain thin disks models as rings with a purely azimuthal pressure and currents using the well - known `` displace , cut and reflect ''",
    "method extended to solutions of einstein - maxwell equations .",
    "in particular , we obtain expressions for the surface energy - momentum tensor and the electrostatic ( magnetostatic ) current density of the disk .",
    "next , in sec . 3 ,",
    "the disks are interpreted in terms of the crm .",
    "we find a general constraint over the counter - rotating tangential velocities needed to cast the surface energy - momentum tensor of the disk as the superposition of two counter - rotating charged dust fluids .",
    "we then show that this constraint is satisfied if we take the two counter - rotating streams as circulating along electrogeodesics with equal and opposite tangential velocities .",
    "we also find explicit expressions for the energy densities , electrostatic ( magnetostatic ) current densities and velocities of the counter - rotating fluids . in following section , secs . 4 ,",
    "three specific examples are considered based in simple solutions to the einstein - maxwell equations .",
    "the considered solutions are reissner - nordstrm in the electrostatic case , its magnetostatic counterpart , and two solutions generated from taub - nut and kerr solutions . in particular , we study the tangential velocities , mass densities and electrostatic ( magnetostatic ) charge densities of both streams .",
