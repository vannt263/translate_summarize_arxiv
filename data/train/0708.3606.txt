    "in 1998 , the discovery that the accelerated expansion of the universe is driven by the dark energy ( de ) from the type ia supernovae ( sn ia ) observations @xcite greatly astonished the world .",
    "the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe @xcite , combined with more accurate sn ia data @xcite indicates that the universe is almost spatially flat and the dark energy accounts for about 70% of the total content of the universe .",
    "however , we know little about the nature of dark energy except for its negative pressure .",
    "therefore , a large number of works have been done in recent years to explain this mystery .",
    "the variable cosmological constant ( hereafter vcc ) @xcite is one of the phenomenological ways to explain the dark energy problem , because it is a straightforward modification of the cosmological constant @xmath4 which enable itself to be compatible with observations .",
    "looking back to the history , we can see that a lot of theorists have done numerous works to search for the theoretical foundation of the vcc models and also investigate the properties of the vcc models @xcite . in @xcite , a model of @xmath5",
    "was proposed , requiring that the cosmic density @xmath6 would equal to the einstein - de sitter critical density @xmath7 , which leads to a closed universe , without singularity , horizon , entropy and monopoly problems @xcite .",
    "after that , it was also suggested a model @xmath5 ( @xmath4 should be independent of @xmath8 ) with different initial conditions by @xcite , which firstly pointed out that time - dependent @xmath4 leads to the creation of matter or radiation . besides",
    ", a lot of work were done to propose straightforward models relating @xmath4 to the hubble parameter @xmath9 : @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , people also constructed a large number of phenomenal vcc models to describe the dynamics of the universe and there is a list in ref .",
    "@xcite summarizing the proposed models @xcite .",
    "there are also several papers concerning the observational constraints about the vcc models amendola06 .",
    "in addition to the vcc models , scalar fields such as `` quintessence '' peebles88 , `` phantom '' @xcite and `` quintom '' @xcite have been introduced to effectively describe the dynamic dark energy , which are distinguished by the effective equation of state ( hereafter eeos ) : @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 across @xmath14 respectively .",
    "these models are inspired by the fact that a decaying vacuum energy which has the very high energy density at early time should be sufficiently small at present to meet the current observation requirement , so they should evolve dynamically . in order to obtain the corresponding quintessence potentials , the reconstruction equations were derived and addressed the feasibility of the approach by monte - carlo simulation @xcite ; it was also constructed the general scalar - field dark energy model @xcite and developed a method to construct them directly from eeos function @xmath15 guo05,lima03 .",
    "moreover , some works have been done to reconstruct the scalar potential from the scalar - tensor theory and investigate the modified newton theory @xcite .    as a major part of our work",
    ", we analyze the eeos and reconstruct the potentials for two main types of vcc models the @xmath0 power law and the @xmath16 power law models from the point of view of dynamic scalar fields .",
    "this work is necessary for people who are interested in the coupled dark energy and dark matter @xcite , because such models may avoid a lot of realistic problems such as the coincidence problem .",
    "in addition , it is discussed how such phenomenological models can be explained as a classical scalar field decaying into a perfect fluid which might be interested by those who want to search for the gravitational theory other than the general relativity , because the lagrangian in vcc should be different from the einstein - hibert action in general relativity .",
    "thus , this part should be essential for people to see the possible forms of vcc models and its corresponding scalar fields which are expected from string theory or supergravity .",
    "another main part of this paper is to give an observational constraint on the vcc models and explain the properties of cosmological parameters .",
    "this part of work is the basic analysis to determine the right form of vcc models from the observational requirement .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we search for the eeos , the reconstruction equation and effective potentials for all the @xmath0 power law models , generalizing previous work from ref .",
    "next , we use the current observational data , including 307 high - quality `` union '' sn ia data set , baryon acoustic oscillation from sdss , 9 observational data and cmb shift parameter from three years result , to constrain the index in this model . in addition , we analyze the properties of the dark energy density , the dark matter density and the deceleration parameter in this model . in section 3 , parallelling to section 2 , we generalize the work from ref .",
    "@xcite and discuss the eeos , the reconstruction equation and reconstructed potentials for all of the @xmath1 power law models .",
    "in addition , we also give one example of this type of model to prove the effectiveness of our method .",
    "then , we use data to constrain the cosmological parameters of this type of models and analyze the properties of the dark matter density , hubble parameter and the deceleration parameter .",
    "the concluding remark will be presented in the last section .",
    "for a generalized vcc related to the scale factor @xmath0 , we can write @xmath17where @xmath18 is a constant with the dimension of mass square and we call it the dark energy amplitude .",
    "we assume the vcc is proportional to the scale factor power @xmath19 , and power index @xmath2 plays a significant role in determining the dark energy behavior as discussed below .",
    "then , the dark energy density and the friedmann equation can be written as ( note that @xmath20 , @xmath21 . )",
    "@xmath22@xmath23for simplicity of calculations we assume spatial flatness @xmath24 which is motivated by theoretical considerations , such as inflation , and also confirmed by current observations such as three years result @xcite .",
    "our results can be easily generalized to the case with a spatial curvature .",
    "we denote @xmath25 as the reduced planck mass and use superscript @xmath26 here to denote @xmath0 power law model , we will also use superscript @xmath27 to denote @xmath1 power law model in the next section .",
    "@xmath28is the dust matter density with the present value @xmath29thus , we get @xmath30 in our practice , there is clearly only one degree of freedom in the @xmath0 power law model , which is the power index @xmath2 . as for the vcc models , it is rather natural to consider the interaction between the dark matter and dark energy @xcite",
    ". therefore , we should introduce an interacting term @xmath31 with @xmath32@xmath33and the total energy conservation equation@xmath34still holds .",
    "since vcc is the generalized from of cosmological constant , so it satisfies @xmath35 .",
    "( [ int energy ( a ) ] ) leads to @xmath36where @xmath37which means that the interaction is explicitly determined only by the evolution of dark energy density .      the anterior eqs .",
    "( [ int matter ( a ) ] ) and ( [ int energy ( a ) ] ) are the standard interacting dark energy equations and the function @xmath31 represents the interaction between dark energy and dark matter .",
    "since the interaction may not be directly observable , it is interesting to search for the phenomenologically equivalent potentials which encode some properties of the interaction .",
    "one way to search for such a theory is to express the vcc models in a field theory language , so the most straightforward way might be the scalar field description . if one could find such a description of the vcc models , it is natural to extend the scalar field description to other space - time and other gravitational theory like superstring theory .",
    "in addition , this description is very useful since it provides a path to quantize the scalar field , which can help people to understand the fundamental theory of the phenomenological vcc models .",
    "furthermore , the procedure to obtain a scalar field description of a phenomenological model could be applied to other models .    from this point of view , we want to see what are the eeos and dark energy potentials in the @xmath0 power law models . changing the form of eq .",
    "( [ int energy ( a ) ] ) , we have @xmath38so we could see the interaction @xmath31 contribute to the effective pressure @xmath39so the eeos of dark energy is @xmath40so we obtain this result from the point of view of interacting dark energy @xcite . in eq .",
    "( [ eos - alaw ] ) , the power index @xmath2 is a constant , so the eeos in the @xmath0 power law models are all constants .",
    "we will see in the following subsection that the best - fit of index @xmath2 constrained by current combined observational data is @xmath41 , which means @xmath42 , so vcc is phantom - like @xcite .",
    "however , for @xmath43 confidence level we can not rule out the possibility that @xmath44 ( quintessence - like ) , so we should consider both the phantom and quintessence scalar field potentials for the vcc model .    for a spatially homogeneous and isotropic scalar field , the effective energy density @xmath45 and pressure @xmath46 can be written as @xmath47@xmath48respectively , where upper ( lower ) sign represents the phantom ( quintessence ) scalar field , and @xmath49 is the effective scalar field potential for the @xmath0 power law models . at the same time , the effective energy density @xmath45 and pressure @xmath46 are given by the interacting dark energy equations @xmath50@xmath51where @xmath52and @xmath53we define the dimensionless quantities @xmath54thus , the scalar field potential can be written as a function of redshift @xmath55 @xmath56where @xmath57combining eqs .",
    "( [ rho lamda ] ) and ( [ p lamda ] ) , we have @xmath58^{\\frac{1}{2 } } } ,   \\label{diff for phi}\\]]where @xmath59^{\\frac{1}{2 } } ,   \\label{c1}\\]]@xmath60the upper ( lower ) sign in eq .",
    "( [ diff for phi ] ) represent @xmath61 @xmath62 .",
    "in fact , the sigh is arbitrarily determined by assumption , as it can be changed by @xmath63 we choose the upper sign in the following discussion .",
    "if we shift @xmath64 value , the potential in the following figure will be shifted horizontally , but the shift does nt influence the whole shape of the potential .",
    "the field could be integrated analytically as @xmath65 ,   \\label{phi for a}\\]]where @xmath66^{\\frac{1}{2}}. \\label{c4}\\]]we let the integral constant equals to zero since the initial value of field is meaningless . solving this for @xmath67 and substituting the result into ( [ veff for a ] )",
    ", we obtain the potential of the @xmath0 power law model @xmath68^{\\frac{m}{3-m}}\\text{. } \\label{alaw potential}\\ ] ]    we use the best fits value for @xmath2 in the next section to draw the pictures for the @xmath0 power law models equivalent potentials .",
    "there are three main characteristics for these potentials : first , they are all runaway type and the whole shape does nt change if @xmath69 is shifted horizontally .",
    "second , eqs .",
    "( [ veff for a ] ) and ( [ phi for a ] ) determine that @xmath69 increases and @xmath49 increases as the redshift @xmath55 decreases from large value to @xmath14 , which means that the dark energy potentials increase as the universe expands . from the figure",
    ", we could see that more negative the value of @xmath2 is , the sharper the potentials will increase as the field evolves .",
    "one of the possible explanation for this phenomenon is that the more negative value of @xmath2 means the dark matter `` decays '' into dark energy quicker , so the dark energy increase its potential value and energy density faster .",
    "third , the hyperbolic @xmath70 function in the expression ( alaw potential ) makes the @xmath0 power law potentials have the asymptotic value .",
    "this is very interesting because one could obtain such behavior in general in the supersymmetric qft .",
    "this runaway form of potential is also the one expected in the unstable d - brane system in superstring theory sen05 .      in this subsection , we want to constrain the parameter @xmath2 from combined observational data , so we should obtain the hubble parameter and the luminosity distance .",
    "we can change the variable @xmath71 to redshift @xmath55 in the eq .",
    "( int matter ( a ) ) to figure out the analytical expression for the matter density @xmath72 , \\label{rho alaw}\\]]where @xmath73we can easily note that the effect of vcc is just like a small perturbation to the evolution of the matter density .",
    "if the evolution behavior of the matter density does nt deviate much from @xmath74 behavior ( @xmath4cdm ) , the value of @xmath2 should be very near zero , which indicate that even though the dark energy is not constant through the evolution of the universe , it at least should evolve very slow .",
    "this property will be convinced through observational constraints on power index @xmath2 in the following subsection .",
    "this equation is essential for our purpose to solve the hubble parameter in the following subsection .",
    "as there is only one free parameter in this kind of power law models , it is rather easy to obtain the best fit value from the current observational data .",
    "we do this fitting using the high quality type ia supernovae , baryon acoustic oscillation from sdss , observational @xmath9 data and the the shift parameter of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) given by three years results .",
    "we discuss this problem in the framework of interacting dark energy and accelerating universe ( see relevant work @xcite ) .    integrating the eq .",
    "( [ friedmann for a ] ) , we have the following equation @xmath75^{\\frac{1}{2 } } ,   \\label{hubble alaw}\\]]where @xmath76then we integrate the eq .",
    "( [ hubble alaw ] ) and follow the guideline in appendix ( b ) to obtain the @xmath77 formula to do numerical fitting .     versus @xmath78 in the @xmath0 power law model .",
    "green dashed lines represent sn+bao , blue lines represent sn+bao+ohd , and red lines represent sn+bao+ohd+cmb.,width=307,height=316 ]    our result is much tighter than the previous fitting results silveira97 due to the more precise data we use . under the combined data sets sn+bao+ohd+cmb constraints , the @xmath79 values for the power index @xmath80 are @xmath81from the above results , we are still not able to rule out the positive @xmath2 value within @xmath43 confidence level , so we need more precise data to constrain the vcc models power index in the future .",
    "however , no matter whether the @xmath2 is negative or positive , it is very near zero , suggesting that even though the dark energy is not a constant , it should evolve very slow .",
    "the results for the best - fit and @xmath82 values are shown in table 1 .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     to conclude this subsection , we derive the evolution of the matter density , hubble parameter and the deceleration parameter in the @xmath1 power law models .",
    "we note that the index @xmath3 is just like the index @xmath2 in the @xmath0 power law models , which not only reflects whether the dark energy `` decays '' into dark matter , but also affects the acceleration of the universe the deceleration parameter @xmath83 and transition redshift @xmath84 .",
    "in this paper , we develop a method to reconstruct potentials in the vcc models directly from the definition of the energy density and pressure of the scalar field .",
    "we also give one example of the reconstruction for the @xmath1 power law models .",
    "first , these potentials have some relationship with the exponential function , which is expected in supersymmetry theory and unstable d - brane system in superstring theory @xcite .",
    "second , as the universe is expanding , the value of @xmath69 becomes large and the field slowly rolls upon the potential . at the same time , the dark matter field gradually `` decays '' into dark energy , so the matter density dilutes more sharply than the standard @xmath74 behavior .",
    "it is worth noticing that the reconstruction equations presented here are not limited to searching for the scalar field description of such phenomenological vcc models .",
    "generally , it could give people the possibility to find the scalar field versions of other phenomenological models and even quantum gravity models such as holographic models @xcite and vacuum fluctuation model @xcite .",
    "we also investigate constraints on the vcc models the @xmath0 power law and the @xmath1 power law models from current combined cosmological observations , using high quality supernovae , baryon acoustic oscillation from sdss , observational @xmath85 data derived from gemini deep deep survey ( gdds ) and the cmb shift parameter from three years result .",
    "we consider a spatially flat frw universe with matter component and vcc component .",
    "for the vcc models , such as the @xmath0 power law and the @xmath1 power law models , the power indices @xmath2 and @xmath3 play a very significant role in determining the evolutionary behavior of the space - time as well as the ultimate fate of the universe .",
    "according to the combined constraints , the best fit , @xmath82 , @xmath43 and @xmath79 values for the indices @xmath2 and @xmath3 are @xmath86 , @xmath87 respectively .",
    "these results can not fix the value of @xmath2 and@xmath3 , but at least indicate even though the dark energy may change with time , it will evolve very slow since the value of @xmath2 and@xmath3 are always very near zero .",
    "the indices of vcc models suggest the interaction between dark energy and dark matter : first , @xmath44 and @xmath88 represent that the dark energy `` decays '' into dark matter , while @xmath89 and @xmath90 represent the inverse process .",
    "the more negative the indices @xmath2 and @xmath3 are , the faster such transitions happen .",
    "second , the indices @xmath2 and @xmath3 affect the deceleration parameter and the transition redshift @xmath84 .",
    "the more negative the indices @xmath2 and @xmath3 are , the more portion dark energy takes in the whole universe budget in the future due to the matter `` decays '' ; thus , faster the universe will be accelerating .",
    "also , the more negative the indices @xmath2 and @xmath3 are , the less portion they took into the whole universe budget in the past and the smaller value of transition redshift @xmath84 is .",
    "therefore , the indices @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the important signatures to judge whether the universe accelerates more drastically than the @xmath4cdm model .",
    "third , the indices @xmath2 and @xmath3 are also the essential indicators to understand the properties of vcc . for one thing , the best fit values for @xmath2 and @xmath3 suggest that the eeos of dark energy are real numbers or functions of redshift @xmath55 at the region @xmath91 $ ] , indicating that the dynamic scalar fields of vcc are phantom - like .",
    "for another thing , there are still some probabilities for the @xmath0 power law and the @xmath1 power law models that the dynamic scalar field of vcc is quintessence - like , so the vcc models are the phenomenal models representing a variety of other dynamic dark energy models . moreover , the eeos of the @xmath0 power law models are constant , while those of the @xmath1 power law models are functions of redshift @xmath55 but have the asymptotic values when redshift @xmath55 becomes large , so at the early stage , the vcc models have some properties of the quiessence model .",
    "the different fate indicated by the two models are , if redshift @xmath55 tends to be @xmath14 , the eeos in @xmath1 power tends to be @xmath92 so the universe enter a de - sitter phase in the future .",
    "however , the eeos of @xmath0 power law model is always a negative constant , indicating the universe will enter the `` big rip '' phase in the future .",
    "the cosmological constant problem is still one of the serious problem that puzzles the physical world and we are still far away to go to its nature .",
    "thus , we expect that a more sophisticated combined analysis of various observations will be capable of determining the indices value of vcc models and revealing more properties of the vcc dark energy models .",

    "he also thanks guo - xing ju , hao yin , lei zhang , nan zhao and tie - yan si for helpful direction of computer program and hao wei , hong - sheng zhang , hui li , li - ming cao , xing wu for revision and yan gong for suggesting high quality supernovae data sets .",

    "<S> in this paper we first give a brief review of the variable cosmological constant model and its scalar field description . </S>",
    "<S> we mainly discuss two types of variable cosmological constant models : @xmath0 power law and @xmath1 power law models . </S>",
    "<S> a method to obtain all of the equivalent scalar field potentials and the effective equation of state of the two models is presented . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the dynamics of such scalar field potentials and effective equation of state are discussed in detail . </S>",
    "<S> the parameters of the two models are constrained by current 307 high - quality `` union '' sn ia data set , baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) measurement from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , 9 observational data derived from the gemini deep deep survey ( gdds ) and the shift parameter of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) given by the three - year wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( ) observations . </S>",
    "<S> we also calculate and draw the picture of the hubble parameter , the deceleration parameter and the matter density of the two models . </S>",
    "<S> then , we show that the indices @xmath2 and @xmath3 in the two models have specific meaning in determining properties of the models . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the reasons that indices @xmath2 and @xmath3 may also influence the behavior of effective equation of state and scalar field potentials are presented . </S>"
