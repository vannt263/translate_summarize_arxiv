    "2002 ) , but we emphasize that we can not statistically rule out other spectral shapes .",
    "however , bremsstrahlung models provide un - physical temperatures as already mentioned in kong et al .",
    "( 2002 ) . for h",

    "as the values obtained ( table 1 ) are consistent with results from previous x - ray outbursts ( 9 @xmath0 10@xmath16 @xmath15 ; tomsick et al .",
    "2001 ) , we also fixed the column density of  to this value .",
    "this column density is inconsistent with the value inferred from the interstellar absorption lines ( snchez - fernndez et al .",
    "1999 ) , but agrees with the hydrogen column density deduced from x - ray spectra of  or its associated x - ray jets ( tomsick et al .",
    "2001 , 2003a ; kaaret et al .",
    "2003 ) , and also with the galactic column density along the line of sight ( jain et al .",
    "the difference when compared to the optical measurement of snchez - fernndez et al .",
    "( 1999 ) may be explained in various ways .",
    "one possibility is that the x - ray absorption column density may be intrinsically higher than the optically - inferred value due to additional local material covering the x - ray source .",
    "another possibility is that the absorption column density deduced from the interstellar absorption lines are artificially lower ( due to saturation for example , hynes et al .",
    "we believe that the latter is more likely as  and its x - ray jets ( which are separated by up to 30 ) have similar column densities .",
    "in addition , it is interesting to point out the absence of variation of the hydrogen column density between outburst and quiescence .    for h ,",
    "the best - fit photon indices are 1.3@xmath17 , 1.6@xmath18 and 2.2 @xmath5 0.6 for the observations on mjd 53048 , 53089 and 53091 , respectively .",

    "its x - ray spectrum is better constrained .",
    "the fit results of the individual observations are reported in table  1 . to provide the best constraint on the spectral parameters , we simultaneously fit all seven datasets simultaneously ( again allowing the normalization to vary ) . leaving the hydrogen column density as a free parameter leads to n@xmath13 = ( 8.8 @xmath5 1.0 )",
    "@xmath19 10@xmath16 @xmath15 , which is consistent with previous estimates . with n@xmath13 frozen to 9 @xmath0 10@xmath16 @xmath15 ( tomsick et al . 2001 ) , we obtain the best constraint on the photon index for  in quiescence , @xmath20 = 2.25 @xmath5 0.08 ( with 90% confidence errors ) .",
    "figure 2 shows the 68% , 90% and 99% error contours allowing two parameters ( n@xmath13 and @xmath20 ) to vary .",
    "the results indicate that these parameters are very well constrained by our observations .    the photon indices in all _ chandra _ observations of  ( figure 3 ) are consistent with the value obtained by fitting the spectrum from the observation with the brightest flux ( on mjd 52345 ) alone .",
    "this indicates that the x - ray spectra of  are consistent with the same spectral shape for all the observations , even though the flux varies by a factor of at least 16 .",
    "the fact that the x - ray flux varies between the observations indicates that accretion onto the black hole has not stopped in quiescence .",
    "we use the _ chandra _ observations of  on mjd 52344 to construct a light - curve of  with a time resolution of 1 ks ( figure 4 ) .",
    "a fit with a constant level leads to a @xmath21 of 74 for 27 degrees of freedom , clearly indicating that there is also significant x - ray variability on short ( @xmath8 ks ) time - scale .",
    "the un - absorbed 0.510 kev fluxes for h  and  are reported in table 1 . for h ,",
    "we fixed the power - law photon index to a value of 2.0 , whereas for , the photon index was left at its fitted value .",
    "for both sources , the column densities were fixed as indicated previously .",
    "the quoted errors are based on the numbers of source and background counts and poisson statistics .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      most of the x - ray novae have not been observed / detected in x - rays in their quiescent state .",
    "however , we note that the softening of their x - ray spectra has been seen at flux level well above quiescence . in the decay phase of their recent outburst ,  ( corbel et al 2004 ) , as well as xte  j1908@xmath22094 ( jonker et al .",
    "2004 ) , are first observed to harden significantly in the hard state ( we note that this is also the case for  at intermediate luminosity , possibly related to compton reflection , nowak et al .",
    "however , a clear softening ( @xmath20 = 1.96 @xmath5 0.09 ) , like in , is then observed in  in the decay at a luminosity of 2 @xmath0 10@xmath23 erg s@xmath3 ( tomsick et al .",

    "_ xmm - newton _ confirmed this softening with a photon index of @xmath20 = 1.94 @xmath5 0.04 at a luminosity level of 4 @xmath0 10@xmath23 erg s@xmath3 ( 10@xmath24 l@xmath25 ) ( la palombara & mereghetti ( 2005 ) .",
    "4u  1543@xmath1147 was not in its true x - ray quiescence phase ( at the time of the _ xmm - newton _ observation ) which is believed to occur below 3 @xmath0 10@xmath4 erg s@xmath3 ( garcia et al .",
    "however , the optical / infra - red monitoring ( buxton & bailyn 2004 ) indicates that 4u  1543@xmath1147 reached its quiescent optical level only ten days after the _ xmm - newton _ observations . it is unlikely that the x - ray flux could have decayed by three orders of magnitude on timescale of ten days .",
    "this may possibly point out that the optical emission settled down to its quiescent level much before the x - rays .",
    "other examples of similar softening at intermediate luminosity during the decay phase include xte  j1748@xmath11288 ( kotani et al .",
    "2000 ) and gs  1124@xmath1168 ( ebisawa et al .",
    "1994 ) .",
    "one of the main results from our study is that a significant fraction of bhs have an x - ray spectrum that softens at lower luminosity .",
    "the emission of quiescent bhs is usually consistent with an extension of the hard state properties to lower luminosities ( corbel et al . 2000 , 2003 ; kong et al .",
    "2000 ; tomsick et al .",
    "2004 ) , and hard state models have been applied to explain the emission in the quiescent state .    among these models ,",
    "mcclintock et al . ( 2003 ) explained the power - law photon index of @xmath20 = 2.02 @xmath5 0.16 of  ( one of the best studied black holes in quiescence ) with an advection dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) located inside a truncated standard thin disk .",
    "however , a pure adaf model was insufficient to reproduce the x - ray spectrum of  and they had to reduce the mass accretion rate close to the black hole .",
    "specifically , they assumed that the mass accretion rate varies as a function of radius as @xmath26 and obtained adequate fits only for @xmath27 .",
    "the fate of the  missing mass \" is not described in mcclintock et al .",
    "( 2003 ) but could possibly takes the form of an outflow ( e.g. quataert & narayan 1999 ) , which is then like the adios model ( blandford & begelman 1999 ) .",
    "this is also quite similar to yuan et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , who added a jet contribution to the standard adaf model in order to fit the spectral energy distribution of  in the hard state . within this context",
    ", an x - ray power - law photon index of @xmath8 2 is predicted for bh in quiescence ( yuan & cui 2005 ) .",
    "however , at low luminosity the accretion flow is known to be convectively unstable ( igumenshchev & abramowicz 1999 ; quataert & gruzinov 2000 ) , and this convection - dominated accretion flow ( cdaf ) has a very different structure than the standard adaf , as convection significantly reduces the mass accretion rate ( equivalent to setting adaf p parameter to 1 in eq . 1 of mcclintock et al .",
    "2003 ) . in this cdaf framework",
    ", the x - ray spectra are expected to soften significantly at very low luminosity ( ball et al .",
    "2001 ) as observed in our study .",
    "so , it is likely that adaf models would be able to reproduce the soft and hard spectra described above , by tuning the amount of outflow or convection with the p parameter . to reproduce the harder spectra of longer orbital period systems , such as v404  cyg , larger values of the @xmath28 parameter , corresponding to stronger outflow or stronger convection , would be required .",
    "alternatively , in standard sphere@xmath22disk model , a softening of the x - ray spectra would also be expected due to a decrease of the coronal optical depth as the mass accretion rate decreases ( see , for example , the discussion in tomsick et al .",
    "2004 ) . in the magnetic corona model ,",
    "active regions above the disk are responsible for producing the hard x - ray emission and constitute the base of the outflow ( merloni & fabian 2002 ) . in that model",
    ", the x - ray spectrum is expected to soften at lower accretion rate as the accretion power is carried away into the jets rather that being used to heat the electrons ( merloni & fabian 2002 ) .",
    "such a model could easily explain the soft spectra of our sources in quiescence .",
    "however , in this model , the inner boundary of the accretion disk does not vary with mass accretion rate .",
    "the characteristic frequencies of qpos and of broad - band timing noise are known to vary at state transitions and in the hard state ( tomsick et al .",
    "2004 ; kalemci et al .",
    "2005 ) , with lower frequencies generally occurring at lower luminosities .",
    "this is easy to understand in models where the inner disk radius increases at low mass accretion rates , but is difficult to explain in the models where the inner disk radius is constant .",
    "alternatively , a new possibility for the origin of x - ray emission has emerged in recent years . indeed , a strong correlation is observed between the radio and x - ray emission of  and v404  cyg in the hard state , and this correlation seems to extend down to the quiescent level for these two sources ( corbel et al .",
    "2003 ; gallo et al . 2003 ) .",
    "the radio emission originates from a powerful self - absorbed compact jet ( corbel et al .",
    "2000 ) , and it also seems possible that this jet may contribute to the high energy emission ( markoff et al .",
    "2001 , 2003 ) of bh in the standard hard state .",
    "furthermore , radio observations show that the compact jet ( at least for v404  cyg ) is maintained in quiescence ( gallo et al .",
    "2004 ) . even if the debate is still open regarding the contribution of the compact jet ( markoff & nowak 2004 , homan et al .",
    "2005 , markoff et al .",
    "2005 ) at high energy , we can check if the jet model could explain the softening of x - ray spectra for bh in quiescence . to explain the x - ray spectra in the hard state",
    ", the electron energy distribution should have an energy index of the order of 2.22.4 ( markoff et al .",
    "if the electrons that could be responsible for the x - ray emission of bh in quiescence are above the cooling break due to spectral ageing , then the energy index of the electron distribution ( above the break ) would be 3.23.4 , therefore increasing ( by 0.5 ) the photon index to @xmath29 2.1 as observed in a large part of the sources from our sample . in this picture , the reason for the change would be that the particles are not sufficiently re - accelerated at low accretion rate , which is indeed quite reasonable .",
    "alternatively , the compact jet contribution may vanish at low luminosity giving the possibility that thermal emission from the nozzle dominates the x - ray band and therefore gives a different spectral shape .",
    "the hard spectra ( @xmath29 1.6 ) would easily be explained if the compact jet properties are similar to the standard hard state .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that these kind of spectra are observed for the sources ( v404  cyg ,  and v4641 sgr ) that have a large accretion disk , and which may be a necessary condition to sustain a powerful compact jet .",
    "similarly , it is of some interest to note that acceleration processes are also believed to be inefficient in the jets of the low luminosity ( 10@xmath30 l@xmath25 ) supermassive black hole , sgr  a@xmath31 , located in the center of our galaxy ( melia & falcke 2001 ) .",
    "we have observed and detected  and h  during their quiescent states at their faintest level of x - ray emission with a 0.510 kev luminosity of 2 @xmath0 10@xmath1 ( d/5 kpc)@xmath2 erg s@xmath3 for  and 9 @xmath0 10@xmath4 ( d/8",
    "kpc)@xmath2 erg s@xmath3 for h. such levels of x - ray emission are in the upper range compared with the levels observed in other black hole systems .",
    "the _ chandra _ observations also provide the best constraint on the power - law index of  with an index of 2.25 @xmath5 0.08 .",
    "we focused our analysis on the power - law model as this spectral shape is typically seen for black holes in quiescence and can represent an approximation for most theoretical emission mechanisms , but we emphasize that we can not statistically rule out other spectral shapes .",
    "all _ chandra _ spectra of  are consistent with a soft power - law ; therefore , indicating that the x - ray spectrum softens at lower luminosity .",
    "we bring to light that all systems with short orbital period ( @xmath8 @xmath32 60 hours ) are consistent with a softening of their x - ray spectra in quiescence",
    ". however , the long orbital period systems may be consistent with a hardening of their x - ray spectra , but confirmation of this trend is required",
    ". a possible and realistic test would be to obtain _ xmm - newton _ or _ chandra _ observations of long orbital period systems , like v4641  sgr or with a long exposure during quiescence .",
    "in addition , , with an orbital period of 833 hours , may be a very good target if it returns to quiescence .",
    "simultaneously , further observations of short orbital period systems ( like , or 4u  1543@xmath1147 at lower luminosity ) should be performed in order to test the softening of their spectra .",
    "we found that various classes of models ( adaf corona + jet , cdaf , sphere@xmath22disk , magnetic corona or jet models ) are able to reproduce the softening of the spectra in quiescence , but we note that most of them need the presence of powerful outflow or significant convection in order to reproduce these soft x - ray spectra .",
    "this may increase the likelihood that outflows are present in the most frequent phase ( quiescence ) of black hole binary s activity and have significant influence on the physics of these systems and neighbooring environment ( fender et al .",
