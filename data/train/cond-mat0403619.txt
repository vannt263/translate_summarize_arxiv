    "a central topic in non equilibrium statistical physics is the quantitative and qualitative understanding of long - time phenomena in strongly interacting many - body systems without long range order .",
    "such systems are characterized by a whole hierarchy of degrees of freedom @xcite , which generate for example a broad distribution of relaxation times .",
    "the different levels relax in series resulting in an extreme slowing - down of dynamical processes .",
    "these processes and other singular behavior is in contrast to the critical slowing - down observed in the vicinity of conventional phase transitions . as a consequence of the mentioned hierarchy strongly disordered systems display a high degree of cooperativity of local processes .",
    "thus , a signature for a broad class of dense systems are autocorrelation functions that can be fitted by a stretched exponential decay law for sufficiently long times or by a non - arrhenius temperature dependence of relaxation times .",
    "although it remains an open problem whether these phenomena are universal , they are , at least , a characteristic feature for many systems , in particular , when the systems are far from thermal equilibrium . for instance , such scenarios arise for the main glass transition process in supercooled liquids .",
    "+ one way to model the hierarchy of relaxation processes is given by kinetic constraints .",
    "due to that constraint a local dynamical process is free to evolve after changing its environment .",
    "a rather simple realization is given by facilitated kinetic spin systems which offer the typical slowing - down of dynamical processes , caused by an increasing cooperativity of local spin - flip processes with decreasing temperature .",
    "in the present paper our interest is focused on the analysis the f - spin facilitated kinetic ising models @xcite , originally introduced by fredrickson and andersen .",

    "the basic dynamic of the facilitated kinetic ising model is given by stochastic spin - flip processes @xmath5 .",
    "additional to these stochastic glauber dynamics @xcite the system is subjected to self - induced topological restrictions .",
    "the origin of the imposed constraints becomes evident when one considers the local spin variable @xmath2 as coarse - grained local density variable .",
    "the down - state is associated to a low - density region while the up - state represents a high - density region . whereas the local stochastic spin - flip processes are controlled by the thermodynamic gibbs measure ,",
    "the constraints reflect the mentioned cooperativity arising at low temperatures .",
    "an elementary spin - flip process at lattice point @xmath1 is only possible after an appropriate rearrangement of the spins in the neighborhood of the site @xmath1 . in other words ,",
    "a given spin @xmath2 has to wait until the degrees of freedom in its environment have reached a certain configuration specified below .",
    "insofar , the kinetic restrictions are related to the hierarchy of degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "+ to be specific , the restrictions are explicitly taken into account by choosing the local flip rates depending on the orientation of its neighbors .",
    "a spin at the lattice point @xmath1 can only undergo a flip process in case the number @xmath6 of nearest neighbored lattice point in an up state @xmath7 is equal or exceed the restriction number @xmath8 with @xmath9 . such kind of models @xcite are denoted as f - spin facilitated ising models . for a realization on a d - dimensional lattice",
    "we use the abbreviation sfm[f ,  d ] . notice that in the original version the sfm[f ,  d ] comprises a system of noninteracting ising spins .",
    "a coupling is realized only via the kinetic constraints .",
    "identifying the spin variables as local density variables as done above , the restrictions lead inevitably to cooperative rearrangements of the whole spin systems . due to the kinetic constraints glassy effects arise at low temperatures @xcite .",
    "+ the sfm[f , d ] allows also another interpretation in terms of chemical reactions .",
    "to that aim let us identify the spin - up state as a molecule of type @xmath10 and the down - state as a molecule of type @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "then the spin facilitated model can be considered as a reversible auto catalytic chemical reaction @xmath12 on a d - dimensional lattice .",
    "the molecule changes its constitution from @xmath10 to @xmath11 and/or from @xmath11 to @xmath10 only in case , when at least @xmath8 molecules of type @xmath10 are situated in the nearest environment .",
    "+ obviously the dynamics of the sfm[f ,  d ] may not only determine by the restriction number @xmath8 , but also by the range of the kinetic active environment of a certain spin @xmath2 .",
    "in particular , the long time behavior of the sfm should be changed significantly , when the number of spins in the neighborhood is enlarged .",
    "one aim of the paper is to extend the original version of the spin facilitated ising model in such a manner that a long range interaction will be included into the model . to realized a minimal extension of the sfm we define a quantity @xmath13 as the environment of an arbitrary spin @xmath2 situated at the lattice point @xmath1 . here",
    ", the new parameter @xmath14 is , so to say , the radius of the neighborhood .",
