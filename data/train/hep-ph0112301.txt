    "it turns out that , near the quasi ",
    "fixed points , all @xmath0 and all @xmath1 are proportional to @xmath27 and @xmath99 , respectively .",
    "thus , we have shown that , in the parameter space region considered here , the solutions to the renormalization group equations for the trilinear coupling constants and for some combinations of the scalar particle masses are focused in a narrow interval within the infrared region .",
    "since the neutral scalar field @xmath65 is not renormalized by gauge interactions , @xmath127 and @xmath128 are concentrated near zero ; therefore they are still dependent on the initial conditions . the parameters @xmath146 and @xmath147 show the weakest dependence on @xmath85 and @xmath120 because these parameters are renormalized by strong interactions .",
    "by considering that the quantities @xmath283 are virtually independent of the boundary conditions , we have calculated , near the quasi ",

    "is increased , the trilinear coupling constants and the above combinations of he scalar particle masses approach quasi ",
    "fixed points . the formation of the straight lines and planes can be traced by considering the examples of an exact ( at @xmath154 ) and an approximate ( for @xmath284 ) solution .",
    "although the approximate solution for the parameters of a soft breaking of supersymmetry in a nonminimal susy model ( this solution has been obtained here for the first time ) describes the evolution of @xmath127 and @xmath128 very poorly , it leads to qualitatively correct results .",
    "however , our analysis of the behaviour of solutions to the renormalization group equations within the nmssm in the regime of strong yukawa coupling has revealed that the @xmath3 and @xmath4 dependence of the trilinear coupling constants and the above combinations of the scalar particle masses dies out quite slowly , in proportion to @xmath267 , where @xmath46 and @xmath268 is the minimal eigenvalue of the matrix @xmath216 . as a rule , @xmath268 is positive and much less than unity .",
    "for example , @xmath285 at @xmath140 and @xmath286 at @xmath287 .",
    "the above is invalid only for the solutions @xmath0 and @xmath1 that correspond to universal boundary conditions for the parameters of a soft breaking of supersymmetry and to the initial values of @xmath191 and @xmath131 for the yukawa coupling constants at the grand unification scale .",
    "they correspond to quasi ",
    "fixed points of the renormalization group equations for @xmath202 .",
    "as the yukawa coupling constants are increased , such solutions are attracted to infrared quasi ",
    "fixed points in proportion to @xmath48 .",
    "it is precisely because of the inequality @xmath288 that straight lines in the @xmath185 and @xmath186 spaces , rather than infrared quasi ",
