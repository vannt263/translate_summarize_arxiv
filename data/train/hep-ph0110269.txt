    "<S> production of @xmath0 mesons in heavy ion collisions is considered within the statistical coalescence model . </S>",

    "<S> the original picture @xcite ( see also @xcite for a modern review ) assumes that charmonia are created exclusively at the initial stage of the reaction in primary nucleon - nucleon collisions . during the subsequent evolution of the system , </S>",
    "<S> the number of hidden charm mesons is reduced because of : ( a ) absorption of pre - resonance charmonium states by nuclear nucleons ( normal nuclear suppression ) , ( b ) interactions of charmonia with secondary hadrons ( comovers ) , ( c ) dissociation of @xmath3 bound states in deconfined medium ( anomalous suppression ) . </S>",
    "<S> it was found @xcite that @xmath0 suppression with respect to drell - yan muon pairs measured in proton - nucleus and nucleus - nucleus collisions with light projectiles can be explained by the so called _  normal  _ ( due to sweeping nucleons ) nuclear suppression alone . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the na50 experiment with a heavy projectile and target ( pb+pb ) revealed essentially stronger @xmath0 suppression for central collisions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this _ anomalous _ @xmath0 suppression was attributed to formation of quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) @xcite , but a comover scenario can not be excluded @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> a completely different picture of charmonium production was developed recently within several model approaches @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the standard approach , hidden charm mesons are supposed to be created at the hadronization stage of the reaction due to coalescence of @xmath4 and @xmath5 quarks created earlier . in this case </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0 yield is not restricted from above by the normal nuclear suppression curve . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , neither anomalous suppression nor enhancement are excluded .    in the present letter </S>",
    "<S> we consider the statistical coalescence model ( scm ) @xcite of charmonium production . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that @xmath4 and @xmath5 are created at the initial stage of the reaction in primary hard parton collisions . </S>",
    "<S> we neglect creation of @xmath3 pairs after the hard initial stage as well as their possible annihilation . </S>",
    "<S> then , the number of charmed quark - antiquark pairs remain approximately unchanged during subsequent stages . </S>",
    "<S> they are distributed over final hadron states at the hadronization stage in accord with laws of statistical mechanics . </S>",
    "<S> the scm provides an excellent quantitative description of the na50 data on centrality dependence of @xmath0 production in pb+pb collisions at sps , provided that the number of nucleon participants is not too small ( @xmath6 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the peripheral collision data can be explained qualitatively .    </S>",
    "<S> if creation of heavy quarks is indeed a hard process only , the average number @xmath7 of produced @xmath3 pairs must be proportional to the number of primary nucleon - nucleon collisions . </S>",
    "<S> then the centrality dependence of @xmath7 can be calculated in glauber s approach : @xmath8 here @xmath9 is the impact parameter , @xmath10 is the nuclear overlap function ( see appendix ) and @xmath11 is the @xmath3 production cross section for nucleon - nucleon collisions . as discussed in ref.@xcite , deconfined medium can substantially modify charm production in hard collisions at sps . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , @xmath11 in a+b collisions can be different from the corresponding cross section measured in a nucleon - nucleon collision experiment . </S>",

    "<S> the drell - yan muon pair multiplicity ( either measured or calculated from the minimum bias data ) is used as a reference for the @xmath0 suppression pattern . similarly to @xmath3 pairs , the number drell - yan pairs is proportional to the number of primary nucleon - nucleon collisions : @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the nucleon - nucleon production cross section of @xmath54 drell - yan pairs . </S>",

    "<S> the neutral transverse energy of produced particles @xmath65 was used to measure centrality of the collisions . </S>",
    "<S> this variable , however , provides a reliable measure of the centrality only if it does not exceed a certain maximum value : @xmath66 gev ( see also ref.@xcite ) . to show this we have calculated the dependence of the average number of participants on the transverse energy @xmath67 .    </S>",
    "<S> the conditional probability to measure some value of @xmath65 at fixed impact parameter @xmath9 is given by a gaussian distribution : @xmath68 ^ 2}{2 q^2 a n_p(b ) } \\right).\\ ] ] analyzing the experimental situation , we are interested in a quite opposite question : how events with fixed @xmath65 are distributed with respect to the centrality . </S>",
    "<S> the answer is @xmath69 where @xmath70 stands for the probability ( see appendix ) that two nuclei at fixed impact parameter @xmath9 interact ( at least one pair of nucleons collides ) . </S>",
    "<S> the average number of participating nucleons at fixed @xmath65 is then given by the expression : @xmath71 the parameter values @xmath72 gev and @xmath73 @xcite are fixed from the minimum bias transverse energy distribution .    </S>",
    "<S> the result is shown in fig.[npet ] . </S>",
    "<S> as is seen , the transverse energy is simply related to the number of participants @xmath74 in the domain @xmath66 gev . outside of this domain @xmath75 does not change essentially as @xmath65 grows . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the data at @xmath76 gev do not represent centrality dependence of the @xmath0 suppression pattern but rather its dependence on fluctuations of the stopping energy at _ fixed _ number of participants . in principle , influence of such fluctuations on @xmath0 multiplicity can be studied in the framework of our model , but information concerning the corresponding fluctuations of the chemical freeze - out parameters @xmath27 and @xmath36 would be needed . </S>",
    "<S> experimental data that would allow to extract this information ( hadron yields at extremely large transverse energy ) are not available at present . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we restrict our analysis to centrality dependence of @xmath0 production and do not use the data corresponding to large transverse energies @xmath77 gev .    on the other hand , the scm is not expected to describe small systems . </S>",
    "<S> this can be seen from @xmath78 data @xcite . in the framework of scm </S>",
    "<S> the multiplicity of @xmath78 is given by the formula ( [ jpsi ] ) with the replacement @xmath79 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the @xmath78 to @xmath0 ratio as a function of centrality should be constant and equal to its thermal equilibrium value . the experimental data @xcite ( see also a compilation in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) are consistent with this picture only at rather large ( @xmath6 ) numbers of participants @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> hence , the applicability domain of the model is limited to @xmath80 note that the most precise and abundant na50 data ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ f1 ] ) correspond to this kinematical region .    at @xmath66 gev the formula ( [ rbc ] ) and the equation @xmath81 give a parametric dependence of the ratio @xmath82 on the transverse energy . </S>",

    "<S> the model demonstrates excellent agreement with the fitted data ( @xmath84 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> extrapolation of the fit to peripheral collisions reveals sharp increase of the ratio ( [ rb ] ) with decreasing @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> such behavior in the scm can be understood as the following . </S>",

    "<S> [ f1 ] , this is not supported by the data : the scm curve lies above the experimental points in the low @xmath65 region . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , the normal nuclear suppression model also fails to explain the leftmost point from the 1996 standard analysis set and two leftmost points from the 1996 minimum bias set . </S>",
    "<S> those theoretical calculations underestimate the experimental values . </S>",
    "<S> it is natural to assume that an intermediate situation takes place suppression pattern in ( semi)central collision region . ] . </S>",
    "<S> some fraction of peripheral pb+pb collisions result in formation of deconfined medium . in these collisions </S>",
    "<S> charmonia are formed at the hadronization stage , and their multiplicities are given by scm . </S>",
    "<S> the rest collisions ( we shall call them normal collisions ) do not lead to color deconfinement , therefore charmonia are formed exclusively at the initial stage and then suffer normal nuclear suppression . </S>",
    "<S> the experiment measures the average value , which lies between the two curves .    </S>",
    "<S> the fraction of normal events decreases with growing centrality . </S>",
    "<S> their influence on @xmath0 production becomes negligible at @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> to check this we repeated the above fitting procedure using only the experimental data corresponding to @xmath85 . </S>",
    "<S> the quality of the fit is only slightly better : @xmath86 , the parameter values @xmath87 and @xmath88 @xmath58b are consistent with the analysis of the full data set ( [ parset ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> our picture is also supported by @xmath78 data . the normal nuclear suppression influence nascent charmonia before the formation of meson states . </S>",
    "<S> therefore its effect on @xmath78 is the same as on @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the multiplicity ratio of @xmath78 to @xmath0 in normal nuclear - nuclear collisions should be the same as in nucleon - nucleon collisions and should not depend on the centrality . in the framework of scm , the @xmath78 to @xmath0 ratio , as was explained above , should be equal to its thermal equilibrium value , which is a few times smaller than the corresponding value for normal collisions . as the fraction of normal events decreases , the measured ratio should decrease and then become constant and equal to its thermal value . the experimental data @xcite indeed demonstrate such behavior @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the present analysis predicts strong enhancement of the total number of charm . from a pqcd fit of available data on charm production in p+n and p+a collisions </S>",
    "<S> , one could expect @xmath89  @xmath58b at @xmath90 gev . </S>",
    "<S> our result ( [ parset ] ) is larger by a factor of @xmath91 , which is around the upper bound of the charm enhancement estimated in ref.@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> formation of deconfinement medium can change not only the total number of charmonia and open charm particles but also their rapidity distributions . for direct charmonium production in hard parton collisions , </S>",
    "<S> dimuon pairs satisfying the kinematical conditions ( [ rapidity ] ) and ( [ angle ] ) account for a fraction of about @xmath92 in the total number of pairs originating from @xmath0 decays . </S>",
    "<S> ( the value was found using schuler s parameterization @xcite . ) </S>",
    "<S> our result ( [ parset ] ) corresponds to @xmath93 , which is by a factor of about @xmath94 smaller . </S>",
    "<S> this difference can be attributed to broadening of the @xmath0 rapidity distribution . </S>",
    "<S> it is natural to expect similar modification of the open charm rapidity distribution . </S>",
    "<S> because of this modification the open charm enhancement within a limited rapidity window can , in general , differ from the one for the total phase space . assuming that the broadening for the open charm is approximately the same as that for @xmath0 , one obtains open charm enhancement by a factor of about @xmath95 within the rapidity window ( [ rapidity ] ) , which is consistent with the indirect experimental result @xcite multiplicity data @xcite , which were extracted from the na50 data @xcite assuming narrow rapidity distribution of @xmath0 . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , the charm enhancement in the total phase space is by a factor of about @xmath96@xmath97 and does not differ from the enhancement in the limited rapidity domain , but the number of @xmath3 pairs should grow faster than the number of nucleon - nucleon collisions . either data on rapidity distribution of @xmath0 or precise data on centrality dependence of the open charm multiplicity would help us to decide , which of these two versions is preferable . ] .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have shown that the na50 data on centrality dependence of the @xmath0 and @xmath78 production in pb+pb collisions @xcite are consistent with the following scenario :    the deconfined medium , which is formed in a pb+pb collision , prevents formation of charmonia at the initial stage of the reaction . instead </S>",
    "<S> , hidden charm mesons are created at the hadronization stage due to coalescence of created earlier @xmath4 and @xmath5 quarks . within this scenario , </S>",
    "<S> the color deconfinement does not necessary lead to suppression of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> both suppression and enhancement are possible @xcite . if the number of nucleon participants is not too small ( @xmath6 ) , the number of produced @xmath0 is smaller than in the case of normal nuclear suppression , therefore _ </S>",
    "<S> anomalous suppression _ is observed . </S>",
    "<S> as color deconfinement is present in most collision events for @xmath98 , our model reveals excellent agreement with the experimental data in this centrality domain . </S>",
    "<S> the statistical coalescence model does not describe the na50 data for the peripheral pb+pb collisions . </S>",
    "<S> it seems that the fraction of events producing the deconfinement medium is not dominating there and most of peripheral collisions follow the normal nuclear suppression scenario . </S>",
    "<S> still , the presence a fraction of abnormal events could reveal itself in the deviation of the @xmath0 data up from the normal nuclear suppression curve .    </S>",
    "<S> our model analysis predicts rather strong enhancement of the open charm . </S>",
    "<S> this effect can also be related to the color deconfinement @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the enhancement within the rapidity window @xmath99 is consistent with the indirect na50 data @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . a direct measurement of the open charm would be very important for checking the above scenario .    </S>",
