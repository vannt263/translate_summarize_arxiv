    "we will treat a class of models of ` dense ' random graphs , that is , simple graphs on @xmath0 vertices in which the average number of edges is of order @xmath1 .",
    "more specifically we will consider exponential random graphs in which dependence between the random edges is defined through some finite graph , in imitation of the use of potential energy to provide dependence between particle states in a grand canonical ensemble of statistical physics .",
    "exponential random graphs have been widely studied ( see @xcite for a range of recent work ) since the pioneering work on the independent case by erds and rnyi @xcite .",
    "we will concentrate on the phenomenon of phase transitions which can emerge for dependent variables .",
    "following analyses using mean - field and other uncontrolled approximations ( see @xcite ) there has recently been important progress by chatterjee and diaconis @xcite , including the first rigorous proof of singular dependence on parameters .",
    "we will extend their result both in the class of models and parameter values under control and provide an appropriate formalism of phase structure for such models .",

    "[ two ] if in theorem [ one ] the graph @xmath5 is a @xmath25-star , @xmath26 , the analogous result also holds for @xmath27 .",
    "a @xmath25-star has @xmath25 edges meeting at a vertex .    .1truein",
    "[ corr ] the parameter space @xmath28 of each of the models consists of a single phase with a first order phase transition across the indicated curve and a second order phase transition at the critical point @xmath21 .    to explain the language of phase transitions in corollary [ corr ] we first give a superficial introduction to the formalism of classical statistical mechanics within @xmath29-dimensional lattice gas models ; for more details see for instance @xcite .",
    "assume each point in a @xmath29-dimensional cube @xmath30 is randomly occupied ( by one particle ) or not occupied , and assume there is a ( many - body ) potential energy of value @xmath31 associated with every occupied subset of @xmath32 congruent to a certain @xmath33 .",
    "the interaction is attractive if @xmath34 and repulsive if @xmath35 .",
    "we define the probability that the occupied sites in @xmath32 are precisely @xmath36 by @xmath37 } }    { { \\mathbb z}_n},\\ ] ] where the parameter @xmath38 is called the inverse temperature , the parameter @xmath39 is called the chemical potential , the normalization constant @xmath40 is called the partition function , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are subsets of @xmath32 with @xmath4 a singleton and the cardinality @xmath41 , and @xmath42 is the number of copies of @xmath43 in @xmath36 .",
    "( we are using ` free ' boundary conditions . )",
    "one of the basic features of the formalism is that the free energy density , @xmath44/n^d$ ] , contains all ways to interact with or influence the system , so that ` all ' physically significant quantities can be obtained by differentiating it with respect to @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "for instance @xmath47 the ( average ) particle density . to model materials in thermal equilibrium , calculations in this formalism normally require that the system size be sufficiently large , and in practice one often resorts to using @xmath48 . with this as motivation we tentatively define a ` phase ' as a set of states ( i.e. probability distributions ) corresponding to a connected region of the @xmath49 parameter space , which is maximal for the condition that @xmath50 are analytic in @xmath45 and @xmath46 for all @xmath51 .",
    "intuitively one associates a ` phase transition ' with singularities which develop in some of these quantities as the system size diverges .",
    "an important simplification was proven by yang and lee @xcite who showed that the limiting free energy density @xmath52 always exists and that certain limits commute : @xmath53 this implies that phases and phase transitions can be determined from the limiting free energy density , and so a phase is commonly defined ( see for instance @xcite ) as a connected region of the @xmath54 parameter space maximal for the condition that @xmath55 is analytic .    using the obvious analogues for random graphs , with @xmath15 playing the role of @xmath56 and @xmath16 the role of @xmath57 ( and therefore positive if and only if the model is ` attractive ' ) , @xmath7 plays the key role of free energy density .",
    "we will show in theorems [ a ] and [ b ] below that the limiting free energy density @xmath58 exists , and the proof of theorem 2 by yang and lee @xcite , on the commutation of limits , then goes through without any difficulty in this setting , so we can again define phases and phase transitions through the limiting free energy density , as follows .",
    "a phase is a connected region , of the parameter space @xmath28 , maximal for the condition that the limiting free energy density , @xmath58 , is analytic .",
    "there is a @xmath59-order transition at a boundary point of a phase if at least one @xmath59-order partial derivative of @xmath60 is discontinuous there , while all lower order derivatives are continuous .",
    "theorems [ one ] and [ two ] thereby justify our interpretation in corollary [ corr ] that each of our models consists of a single phase with a first order phase transition across the indicated curve except at the end ( or ` critical ' ) point @xmath61 , where the transition is second order , superficially similar to the transition between liquid and gas in equilibrium materials .",
    "chatterjee and diaconis have proven that the main object of interest , @xmath62 , exists for all @xmath15 and nonnegative @xmath16 and is the solution of a certain optimization problem :    [ cd ] fix one of our models and assume @xmath5 has @xmath26 edges .",
    "then for any @xmath63 and @xmath64 , the pointwise limit @xmath65 exists : @xmath66 } \\big(\\beta_1u+\\beta_2u^p-\\frac{1}{2}u\\log    u-\\frac{1}{2}(1-u)\\log(1-u)\\big).\\ ] ]    the following detailed analysis of this maximization problem is therefore fundamental to understanding the phase structure of our models , and we now address it .",
