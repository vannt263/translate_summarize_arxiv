    "in this symposium , we have learned how the progresses in detector technologies , with the development of schottky mixers , insb hot electron bolometers and finally sis mixers led to spectacular discoveries on the chemical diversity and physical properties of the interstellar medium .",
    "the role of the interstellar medium in the life cycle of baryonic matter has been gradually uncovered in the last century .",
    "following the discovery of the metallic lines in the spectra of reddened stars , the first molecules were recognized in the late 1930 s .",
    "as these spectral features were extremely narrow , with velocity dispersions of a few kms@xmath2 at most , the perspectives of radioastronomy and heterodyne spectroscopy for studying the interstellar medium , and especially its coldest and densest regions was quickly recognized .",
    "molecular lines offer a wealth of diagnostics of the physical conditions , the chemical composition and the gas dynamics from the regions where they are formed .",
    "molecular clouds themselves play a special role in the life cycle of interstellar matter , as the birth places of the new generation of stars but also as the main sites for interaction of stars with their environment .",
    "stars affect their environment through their radiative ( through their x and uv radiation ) , mechanical ( winds , shocks ) and chemical ( nucleosynthesis ) feedback .",
    "the understanding of the properties of molecular clouds , their structure and their relation to the formation of stars has triggered the development of millimeter and submillimeter astronomy .",
    "measuring the cooling radiation from molecular clouds is a key issue that determines our ability to detect the interstellar matter and understand how it can collapse and form stars .",
    "t. phillips and his co - workers have brought a decisive contribution to this field , by making pioneering detections of the submillimeter lines of co , atomic carbon and hydrides .",
    "his prediction of the spectrum of a typical interstellar cloud @xcite has been vastly cited and reproduced to illustrate the scientific discovery potential of submillimeter astronomy .",
    "the neutral interstellar gas cools through line emission , the most intense lines being the fine structure lines of ionized carbon , atomic oxygen and carbon , together with the rotational lines of co and water . molecular hydrogen ( h@xmath3 ) itself can be an important coolant , especially in dense photon - dissociation regions ( pdrs ) and shocks .",
    "averaged over the whole interstellar medium of a galaxy , this line cooling radiation from pdrs makes a significant contribution to the total line emission at large scales @xcite .",
    "@xcite have pioneered this field by mapping the atomic carbon line across the edge of two well known pdrs , s  140 and m  17 .",
    "they showed that the atomic carbon line emission is very extended , and does not show the expected spatial pattern for a uniform density , plane parallel cloud .",
    "they discussed how the knowledge of the source geometry and spatial structure are particularly important for understanding their line emission .",
    "the horsehead nebula is one of the most well known example of a molecular cloud .",
    "it appears as a dark patch against the bright emission from the hii region ic  434 at visible wavelengths , and as a bright line and continuum emission source at ir and ( sub)millimeter wavelengths . following the mapping of the co(32 ) line emission with the cso ,",
    "we have started investigating the physical and chemical structure of the horsehead nebula .",
    "the source was chosen as it is a good template of photon dissociation region ( pdr ) , where molecular gas is heated and photodissociated by far uv ( fuv ; @xmath4ev @xmath5ev ) radiation from nearby massive stars .",
    "the horsehead nebula is particularly interesting as its geometry is simple .",
    "the illuminated edge is viewed very close to edge - on and the illuminating star ( @xmath6 ori ) lies at the same distance .",
    "the properties of the horsehead nebula are summarized in table [ tab : id ] .",

    "[ fig : pdbi ]      the electron abundance ( [ e@xmath22 = @xmath23 ) plays a fundamental role in the chemistry and dynamics of interstellar gas .",
    "it can not be directly measured in fuv shielded gas but can be derived from abundances and abundance ratios of key molecular species , which are sensitive to the presence of electrons .",
    "stable molecular ions such as dco@xmath1 and hco@xmath1 have been traditionally used to estimate the electron abundance in cold cores because ( i ) they are abundant and easily observable ( ii ) dissociative recombination is their main destruction route , and thus their abundances are roughly inversely proportional to the electron abundance ( e.g. @xcite ) . on the other hand , the presence of reactive ions ( species such as hoc@xmath1 or co@xmath1 that react rapidly with h@xmath3 ) indicates high electron abundance regions , e.g. , the uv irradiated cloud surfaces ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the electron abundance is predicted to steeply decrease in a pdr from @xmath24 at the cloud edge where the fuv radiation field is intense , down to @xmath25 in the cold and well shielded gas .",
    "the magnitude and shape of this gradient is sensitive to the elemental abundances , especially sulfur , to the cosmic ray ionization rate , and to the efficiency of recombination reactions and electron attachment processes with pahs and grains @xcite .    by combining pointed observations and maps of h@xmath0co@xmath1 , dco@xmath1 , hoc@xmath1 and co@xmath1 ,",
    "@xcite have investigated the electron abundance gradient across the edge of the horsehead nebula .",
    "they showed that a consistent fit of both the pdr edge and the adjacent cold core can be obtained with a cosmic ray ionization rate of @xmath26 s@xmath2 , assuming a low metal abundance of @xmath27 = 10 ^{-9}$ ] .",
    "the electron abundance in the horsehead edge follows a steep gradient , with a scale length of @xmath280.05pc ( or @xmath2825@xmath29 ) , from [ e@xmath22@xmath3010@xmath31 times @xmath2810@xmath32 in the core .",
    "low metal abundances are required in the core , namely @xmath27 < 4\\times 10^{-9}$ ] ( with respect to h nuclei ) , to enable a significant deuterium fractionation of hco@xmath1 .",
    "this implies a very significant depletion of metals onto dust grains as the solar abundance of metals is @xmath27 \\simeq 8.5 \\times 10^{-5}$ ] ; @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of pahs in the chemical model modifies the electron abundance gradient and decreases the metal depletion required in pure gas - phase models as a good agreement is obtained with metal abundance @xmath27 = 3\\pm1 \\times 10^{-6}$ ] for a standard pah abundance of 10@xmath33 .",
    "indeed , pah@xmath34 anions acquire large abundances , being more efficient in neutralizing atomic ions than electrons .",
    "pahs have a significant impact on the negative charge budget of cold gas if their abundance is significant ( [ pah]@xmath3510@xmath36 ) .",
    "molecular line emission does not directly probe the abundances of a given species , even when several lines of the same species are detected . a minimum treatment of the molecular excitation and line radiative transfer is often needed to distinguish `` excitation gradients '' from true `` chemical variations '' .",
    "our strategy is always to observe several rotational lines of the same species ( sometimes with line maps , sometimes using high signal to noise ratio spectra at representative positions ) . in addition",
    ", we also try to observe molecular isotopologues , if possible , when the main line opacities can complicate the interpretation and lead to large errors on the derived abundance .",
    "molecular excitation in pdrs is always far from lte and different collisional and radiative effects compete at rates that depend on the physical conditions and on the molecule under study . in the last years",
    ", we have always tried to consistently link the observed line intensities with the abundances predicted by our chemical models by detailed non - lte excitation and radiative transfer modeling adapted to the horsehead geometry ( see appendix in @xcite ) .",
    "table [ tab : chem1 ] and [ tab : chem2 ] list the molecular abundances for the pdr region and the dense core respectively , derived following the method described above .",
    "it is obvious , when comparing the maps of various molecules shown in fig . 1 and 2 that the molecular abundances are not uniform across the horsehead nebula .",
    "molecular species like hco and cch closely delineate the western illuminated edge of the nebula . on the contrary , h@xmath0co@xmath1 and the deuterated species dco@xmath1 and dnc are mostly located in the dense cold core .",
    "finally the dust continuum emission , as well as c@xmath37o trace the bulk of the core , but do not show a sharp peak associated with the dense core .",
    "these maps have been discussed in detailed , and molecular abundances in our previous papers .",

    "[ fig : model ]    photo - dissociation models have been used to compute the physical and chemical structure of geometrically simple interstellar clouds , exposed to fuv radiations .",
    "because of its well known geometry and fuv radiation field , the horsehead nebula is a good template source for comparing model predictions with actual data .",
    "these comparisons have been extremely interesting in identifying the strong points of the present generation of models , and their remaining weaknesses , and in triggering new improvements .",

    "the hco , cch and c@xmath59h radicals are much more abundant in the pdr than steady state model predictions . @xcite and @xcite have suggested directions for improvements .",
    "they include i ) the need to include more neutral - neutral reactions in the chemical networks , that may have a significant impact on the chemistry ( e.g. the o + ch@xmath3 reaction in the hco case ) , and ii ) the need for considering the coupling of gas phase and solid phase chemistry as the photodesorption of molecular ices and/or the erosion of carbon grains may release significant amounts of radicals in the gas phase , that can modify current model predictions .",
    "because of the steep gradients in the physical parameters and chemical abundances in pdrs such as the horsehead nebula , an accurate comparison of observations with models can not be performed without information on the spatial variation of the molecular line intensities . due to the small spatial scales",
    "involved , a combination of ( sub)millimeter interferometer maps with short spacings from single dishes appears to be the best method for obtaining this spatial information at the required physical resolution .",
    "however , many interesting species show relatively weak lines , which are bearly detectable with the iram pdbi in a strong and nearby source like the horsehead nebula ( for instance the c@xmath59h lines ) . to access a more complete sample of molecular tracers ,",
    "a more sensitive instrument is needed . with its larger number of antennas ( 12 vs 6 ) , and wide instantaneous bandwidth ( 16ghz ) ,",
    "the noema project ( northern extended millimeter array ) for the iram plateau de bure interferometer , will be able to produce high quality images of a much larger sample of molecules and sources , enabling the possibility to study the fuv chemistry in a wide diversity of physical conditions .",
    "these data will complement the information on the dust spectral energy distribution and gas thermal balance , which will be provided at unprecedented sensitivity and spatial distribution by alma .",
    "this will allow to probe for the first time the steep gradients in temperature and densities at pdr edges , as well as the gradients in elemental abundances induced by freeze - out on grains .",
    "furthermore , hydrides play a key role in most chemical networks , as they are at the root of the formation pathways of most interstellar molecules ( see the discussion by lis et al . in this proceeding ) , but are however not accessible from the ground due to the large opacity of the earth atmosphere at thz frequencies . with the full opening of the far infrared and submillimeter wavelength domain by the herschel satellite , the spatial distribution of important hydrides such as water vapor h@xmath3o , oh , ch , ch@xmath1 ,",
    "nh , hf and many others including the isotopologues will be investigated .",
    "although lacking spatial resolution , and sensitivity , the pioneering detections of water by the iso , swas and odin satellite have demonstrated the added value of detecting hydrides for improving the pdr models @xcite .",
    "the launch of the herschel space observatory in may 2009 has concretized many decades of efforts for proposing a spatial submillimeter and far infrared telescope with direct detection detectors and heterodyne receivers .",
