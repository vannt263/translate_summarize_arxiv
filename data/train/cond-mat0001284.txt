    "the understanding of the role played by quenched impurities on the nature of phase transitions is one of the significant subjects in statistical physics , and it has been a topic of substantial interest for many authors in the last two decades @xcite . according to the harris criterion@xcite ,",
    "quenched randomness is a relevant perturbation at the second - order critical point when its specific - heat exponent @xmath4 of the pure system is positive . following the earlier work of imry and wortis@xcite who argued that a quenched disorder could produce rounding of a _ first - order _ phase transition and thus induce _ second - order _ phase transitions , the introduction of randomness to systems undergoing a first - order phase transition is comprehensively considered .",
    "it was shown by hui and berker that the bond randomness can have a drastic effect on the nature of a first - order phase transition by phenomenological renormalization group arguments @xcite , and the feature has been placed on a firmer basis with the rigorous proof of vanishing of the latent heat @xcite .",
    "their theory was numerically checked with the monte carlo ( mc ) method by chen , ferrrngberg and landau ( cfl ) @xcite , where the eight - state potts model was studied with random - bond disorders .",
    "experimental evidence in two - dimensional systems was found that in the order - disorder phase transitions of absorbed atomic layers , the critical exponents are modified , in the addition of disorder , from the original four - state potts model universality class in the pure case @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "no modification is found when the pure system belongs to the ising universality class @xcite .",
    "the theoretical study of such kinds of disordered systems is also an active field where a resort to intensive mc simulations is often helpful @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the pure potts model in two - dimensions ( 2d ) has a second order phase transition when the number of potts state @xmath5 and is first order for @xmath6 . as the specific heat exponent @xmath4 of the pure system",
    "is always positive for @xmath7 , the disorders will be the relevant perturbation for the potts model . as a result ,",
    "all the transitions are second order for all 2d @xmath8-state potts models in the presence of quenched disorders , and the impurities have particularly strong effect for @xmath6 , even changing the order of the transitions .    in this paper , we discuss the dynamic scaling features of random - bond potts model ( rbpm ) through mc simulations , to estimate the critical exponents .",
    "we consider the important questions of whether there exists an ising - like universality class for the rbpm and how is the critical behavior affected by the introduction of disorder into the pure system @xcite .",
    "the large - scale mc results by the cfl and in ref.@xcite suggest that , in 2d , any random systems should belong to the pure ising universality class .",
    "these results are also coherent with experiment @xcite . in recent papers@xcite",
    ", however , cardy and jacobsen studied the random - bond potts models for several values of @xmath8 with a different approach based on the connectivity transfer matrix ( tm ) formalism of blte and nightingale @xcite their estimates of the critical exponents led to a continuous variation of @xmath1 with @xmath8 , which is in sharp disaggreement with the mc results for @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "we hope that the resulting critical behavior measured in this paper will play a role in settling this controversy .",
    "furthermore we will test the _ short - time dynamic _ ( std ) mc approach for the first time , to study the spin systems with the quenched disorder and to show its efficiency by numerical studies , which is also one of our main aims of this paper .",
    "the hamiltonian of @xmath8-state potts model with quenched random interactions can be written , @xmath10 where the spin @xmath11 can take the values 1,@xmath12 , @xmath13 the inverse temperature , @xmath14 is the kronecker delta function , and the sum is over all nearest - neighbor pairs on a 2d lattice .",
    "the dimensionless couplings @xmath15 are selected from two positive ( ferromagnetic ) values of @xmath16 and @xmath17 , with a strong to weak coupling ratio @xmath18 called as _ disorder amplitude _ , according to a bimodal distribution , @xmath19 when @xmath20 , the system is _ self - dual _ and the exact critical point can be determined by @xcite , @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the corresponding critical values of @xmath16 and @xmath24 respectively at the transition point . while @xmath25 corresponds to the pure case and the critical point",
    "is located at @xmath26 and the phase transitions are first - order for @xmath6 . with additional random - bond distribution , however , new second - order phase transitions are induced for any of @xmath8-state potts models and the new critical points are determined according to eq.([eq3 ] ) for different values of disorder amplitude @xmath27 and state parameter @xmath8 .    in this work we chose @xmath9 , which is known to have a strong first - order phase transition , in the hope that we would find a new second - order phase transition caused by the quenched disorder to show the effect of impurities on the _ first - order _ systems .",
    "the strength of the disorder was chosen for several values of @xmath27 , as was done in @xcite , to check the ising - like universality class . to minimize the number of bond configurations needed for the disorder averaging",
    ", we confined our study to the bond distributions in which there are the same number of strong and weak bonds in each of the two lattice directions .",
    "this procedure should reduce the variation between different bond configurations , with no loss of generality .",
    "we performed our simulations by the std method @xcite on the 2d square lattices with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "this dynamic mc simulations have been successfully performed to estimate the critical temperatures @xmath28 and the critical exponents @xmath0 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and dynamic exponent @xmath2 for the 2d ising model @xcite and the 2d 3-state potts model @xcite , since for both models there exist second order phase transitions .",
    "recently this approach has also been extensively applied for the fully frustruated xy model and spin glass systems to study the critical scaling characteristics to estimate all the dynamic and static critical exponents @xcite .",
    "traditionally it was believed that universality and scaling relations can be found only in the equilibrium stage or _ long - time _ regime . in ref.@xcite",
    ", however it was discovered that for a magnetic system in states with a very high temperature @xmath31 which is suddenly quenched to the critical temperature @xmath28 and then evolve according to a dynamics of model a @xcite , there emerges a universal dynamic scaling behavior already within the short - time regime , which satisfies , @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the @xmath3th moment of the magnetization , @xmath34 is the reduced temperature , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the well known static critical exponents and @xmath35 is a scaling factor .",
    "the variable @xmath36 , a _ new independent _ exponent , is the scaling dimension of initial magnetization @xmath37 .",
    "this dynamic scaling form is generalized from finite size scaling in the equilibrium stages@xcite .",
    "importantly the scaling behavior of eq.([eq4 ] ) can be applied to both dynamic exponent measurements and the estimates of the static exponents originally defined in equilibrium .",
    "we begin our study on the evolutions of magnetization in the initial stage of the dynamic relaxation starting at very high temperature and small magnetization ( @xmath38 ) . for a sufficiently large lattice ( @xmath39 ) , from eq.([eq4 ] ) by setting @xmath40 , @xmath41 , it is easy to derive that @xmath42 when @xmath43 we get the most important scaling relation on which our measurements of the critical exponent @xmath0 are based , @xmath44 as a result , the magnetization undergoes an initial increase at the critical point @xmath45 after a microscopic time @xmath46 .",
    "this prediction is supported by a number of mc investigations which have been applied to detect all the static and dynamic critical exponents @xcite as well as the critical temperatures @xcite .",
    "the advantage of the dynamic mc simulations is that it may eliminate critical slowing down since the measurements are performed in the early time stages of the evolution where the spatial and time correlation lengths are small .      to study the scaling behavior of the second moment of magnetization , we have to take the initial states of @xmath57 to start the relaxation processes .",
    "because the spatial correlation length in the beginning of the relaxation is small compared with the lattice size @xmath58 in the short - time regime of the dynamic evolition , the second moment behaves as @xmath59 .",
    "then the finite size scaling eq.([eq4 ] ) induces a power - law behavior at the critical temperature , @xmath60 from the scaling analysis of the spatial correlation function we easily realize the non - equibrium spatial correlation length @xmath61 . therefore @xmath62 .    in the above considerations the dynamic relaxation process was assumed to start from a disordered state or with small magnetization @xmath37 .",
    "another interesting and important process is the dynamic relaxation from a completely ordered state .",
    "the initial magnatization locate exactly at its fixed point @xmath63 , where scaling of the form , @xmath64 is expected .",
    "this scaling form looks to be the same as the dynamic scaling one in the long - time regime , however , it is now assumed already valid in the macroscopic short - time regime .    for the magnetization itself , @xmath65 yields , for a sufficiently large lattice ,",
    "@xmath66 this leads to a power - law decay behavior of @xmath67 at the critical point ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "the formula can be used to calculate the critical exponents @xmath1 and @xmath2 . for a small but nonzero @xmath69 ,",
    "the power - law behavior will be modified by the scaling function @xmath70 , which has been used to determine the critical temperatures @xcite .",
    "furthermore , by introducing a binder cumulant @xmath71 a similar power - law behavior at the critical point induced from the scaling eq.([eq8 ] ) shows that , @xmath72 on a large enough lattice . here , unlike the relaxation from the disordered state ,",
    "the fluctuations caused by the initial configurations are much smaller . in pratical simulations , these measurements of the critical exponents and critical temperature are better in quality than those from the realization process starting from disordered states .",
    "0.5 cm    .",
    "the tendency and measured values of @xmath0 as a function of the disorder amplitude @xmath27 for different initial @xmath37 at the critical points @xmath45 on the lattice @xmath73 lattice . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in this paper we have investigated the short - time critical dynamics of the random - bond potts model on 2d lattices to verify whether it has a second order phase transition in the ising - like universality class , by a std study .",
    "dynamic scaling haviour was found , and has been used to estimate the critical exponents @xmath0 , @xmath2 and @xmath1 .",
    "our main results are summarized in table 2 , which are obtained from the slopes of power - law curves of @xmath47 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 in the double - log scales by least ",
    "square fits .",
    "our work shows that for the rbpm , there exists a power - law behavior , which is the typical feature of a continuous phase transition in the std processes .",
    "the @xmath27-dependence characteristics of the dynamic exponent @xmath0 gives evidence that their dynamic mc behavior is different from the pure ising model , and the values of magnetic exponent @xmath1 in our calculation seems to be the same as that given by the tm formula @xcite , but not as that by the cfl @xcite .",
    "furthermore we found that the values of dynamic exponent @xmath0 depend on the disorder amplitude @xmath27 , and it suggests that the dynamic exponent @xmath2 may also depend on the @xmath27 , which would be interesting to examine for future study .    in conclusion",
    ", this study presents numerical evidence that the quenched impurities in the rbpm can induce new second - order phase transitions , but they appear not always to belong to ising - like universality class , although the result of new critical exponent @xmath0 is the same for both the @xmath76 rbpm and the ising model within errorbars by present calculations .",
    "second , as the effect of critical slowing down in the equilibrium stage for the rbpm is more severe than that for the pure systems , the cluster algorithms , up to now , have been frequently used in mc simulations of the 2d rbpm @xcite . in present paper , however , we have applied the std mc simulations which use local updating schemes for the 2d rbpm , and the fact that dynamic mc simulations can avoid the critical slowing down in the std processes , where the spatial correlation length is still small , makes it easier to calculate the critical exponents .",
    "an important subject for further study is , for example , how the dependence of dynamic critical exponent @xmath1 on the state parameter @xmath8 and the disorder amplitude @xmath27 by a systematic simulation using the std method in order to clarify the crossover behaviour from the random fixed point to a percolation - like limit @xcite .",
    "this is being studied at present .",
    "we acknowledge the helpful discussions with y. aoki and h. shanahan .",
    "this research was initiated during the visit to university of tsukuba ( hpy , who also acknowledge the center for computational physics for hospitality where the mc simulations were performed on the dec workstations ) .",
